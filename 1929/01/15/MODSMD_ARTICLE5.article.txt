# COAST LEAGUERS OF FACULTY NINE MAY S.O. VARSITY
## 
### DON OSWILL 
The so-called faculty baseball team,
under the direction of Charles Davis,
has high hopes of trouncing the var
sity this afternoon at 3 o'clock on the
varsity diamond. According to the
line-up, it would seem that the fac
ulty is endeavoring to slip in a few
ringers. About half of the faculty
team is faculty, and the other half
has exceedingly good faculties for
playing baseball.
Nevers and Sypher will be the bat
teries for the teachers. This combina
tion worked successfully for the Mis
sion Club of the P.C.L. last season,
and should show the undergraduates
some fancy twirling. "Dink" Temple
ton will hold down the first sack, the
keystone combination will be com
posed of Pratt and Busch (more ring
ers), and Davis will hold down the
torrid corner.
Hunt, Winterburn, and Zwierlein
will be seen cavorting around the
outer pasture. These men are touted
as heavy hitters, and are planning to
put on a fence-busting exhibition this
afternoon. Whether or not the boys
endanger the fences, they should at
least expect a good workout.
Coach Harry Wolter plans to give
all his boys a chance this afternoon.
A large squad has turned out this
year, and Wolter will use this first
touch of competition to get a line-up
on his players. The tentative list of
starters will undoubtedly be changed
a lot before the last inning of the
game.
Taylor and Hardy will start against
the instructors, and will endeavor to
teach them a lesson. Both players are
in pretty good shape for the contest
and the faculty shouldn't expect easy
pickings. Cook, Staley, Johnson, and
Laird will be the starting infield for
the varsity, and Wilton, Wright, and
Hunken will play the outfield.
Pity the umpire if the coaches get
griped.
