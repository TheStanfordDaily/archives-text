# Stanford Professor Is Member of LaFayette Dam Consulting Board
## 
### 
Charles D. Marx, Professor-emeritus
of Civil Engineering, was a member
of the consulting board which last
Friday made a report to the East Bay
Municipal Utility District on "Causes
of (lie Failure and Proposed Methods
of Reconstruction of the LaFayette
Dam."
The dam failed last September. The
report indicates the failure was due
to compression causing the squeezing
out of a layer of yellow clay sand
located some ten feet or so below the
ground level. The board recommended
reconstruction of the dam, which in
volves a 40-foot lowering of the dam
from the original contemplated height
with a flatter slope and a consequent
decreased loading of foundation ma
terial.
