# Senate Split On Voting Date For Kellogg Treaty
## Appropriation Bill for War Department, Tariff Are House Problems 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. (/P)—An
| other week began for Congress today
with the Senate still unable to agree
j on a voting time for the Kellogg Anti-
War Treaty and with the House back
i
at its principal task, that of enacting
! appropriation bills. Notwithstanding
! repeated failures of moves to get
i Senators into agreement on the
' treaty, the secret meetings continued
'and, as on other days hope was ex
: pressed that some way might be
found to bring ratification of the pact
| to a vote before long.
Not worried by international affairs
the House buckled down with the pur
pose of quickly disposing with the
War Department appropriation bill
and sending it to the Senate. One of
the first things it did was to insert
into the bill an item of $10,000,000 for
inland waterways barge line develop
ment. The proposed appropriation has
the backing of President Coolidge who
requested that, the funds be available.
Iron and steel formed the subject
of discussion before the House Ways
and Means Committee which is con
sidering tariff revision. Witnesses
told the committee that the industry
needed more adequate protection. Be
fore a Senate committee retail coal
merchants opposed the bill drawn in
an effort to stabilize the bituminous
coal industry. There was a brief flare
up there when John L. Lewis, of the
United Mine Workers, objected to the
remarks of a witness who used the
term "discredited" in referring to his
union.
Another Senate committee, that
which investigated the Vare Election
case, cited a list of irregularities in
the election in Philadelphia and of
fered Senator-elect Vare, or his repre
sentatives, an opportunity to testify
on January 24. Vare is ill in Florida.
The plan of Senators Edge and
Jones to have an investigation of
Prohibition enforcement by a com
mittee appointed by President Hoover
after he takes office, was sidetracked
for the present at least, by a Senate
committee which questioned the pro
priety of a Coolidge Congress in di
recting the action of the Hoover Ad
ministration.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. (/P)—An
| other week began for Congress today
with the Senate still unable to agree
j on a voting time for the Kellogg Anti-
War Treaty and with the House back
i
at its principal task, that of enacting
! appropriation bills. Notwithstanding
! repeated failures of moves to get
i Senators into agreement on the
' treaty, the secret meetings continued
'and, as on other days hope was ex
: pressed that some way might be
found to bring ratification of the pact
| to a vote before long.
Not worried by international affairs
the House buckled down with the pur
pose of quickly disposing with the
War Department appropriation bill
and sending it to the Senate. One of
the first things it did was to insert
into the bill an item of $10,000,000 for
inland waterways barge line develop
ment. The proposed appropriation has
the backing of President Coolidge who
requested that, the funds be available.
Iron and steel formed the subject
of discussion before the House Ways
and Means Committee which is con
sidering tariff revision. Witnesses
told the committee that the industry
needed more adequate protection. Be
fore a Senate committee retail coal
merchants opposed the bill drawn in
an effort to stabilize the bituminous
coal industry. There was a brief flare
up there when John L. Lewis, of the
United Mine Workers, objected to the
remarks of a witness who used the
term "discredited" in referring to his
union.
Another Senate committee, that
which investigated the Vare Election
case, cited a list of irregularities in
the election in Philadelphia and of
fered Senator-elect Vare, or his repre
sentatives, an opportunity to testify
on January 24. Vare is ill in Florida.
The plan of Senators Edge and
Jones to have an investigation of
Prohibition enforcement by a com
mittee appointed by President Hoover
after he takes office, was sidetracked
for the present at least, by a Senate
committee which questioned the pro
priety of a Coolidge Congress in di
recting the action of the Hoover Ad
ministration.
