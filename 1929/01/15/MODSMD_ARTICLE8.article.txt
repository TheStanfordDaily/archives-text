# THREE VETERANS BACK AGAIN FOR 1929 GYM TEAM
## 
### 
With only three veterans reporting
for the 1929 varsity gym team, Coach
Royce Long will have to rely on sev
eral promising sophomores for points
in this season's meets. While last
year Stanford's freshman team out
numbered the varsity, the opposite
will be true this year, since only a
| few 1932 men have reported to Coach
; Long.
Clarence Naff, who won first tum
-1 bling honors in the California meet
land in lite Minor Sports Conference
last year; Louis Shaw, who was kept
| out of last year's major events by an
| injury; and John Andrews, a con
sistent point-winner last year, are the
, Lliree veterans who will form the nu
cleus of this year's team.
Of the sophomores, Gene Puthoff is
the outstanding performer. Coach
■ Long expects great things from him
when ho gains the necessary experi
ence. Wilson Phelps and Jan Ridley
I are two other sophomores who should
| make good varsity material.
Bob Morrow, Fred Hines, and Craw
ford Sullivan are three of the fresh
men who are working for positions on
I the 1932 team.
Hal Coleman, manager of the gym
team, is planning several meets for
this year. Stanford will meet Califor
nia about the middle of March, and
; the Minor Sports Conference is sched
uled to be held in Sacramento during
the first week of April. Plans are now
under way for a practice workout
with California to be held in San
| Francisco, preliminary to arrange
jments for a joint exhibition with the
[California team about the middle of
February.
Coleman would like several sopho
mores to try out for the managership
of the gym team.
