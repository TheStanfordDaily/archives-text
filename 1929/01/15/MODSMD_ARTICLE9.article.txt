Piling up the largest score to date i
in the mural basketball tourney, J
Sigma Chi walloped Theta Chi by a
42 to 5 score in a one-sided game at
the Pavilion yesterday. The winners I
tossed in baskets at will, as the Theta
Chi boys didn't know what defense j
meant. Elliot, lanky center on the
Sigma Chi outfit, was high-point man
with 17 points. Klabau and S. Nye |
each sank four shots for the victors.
The last quarter developed into a
"comedy of errors," when Carr, of the
losing squad, shot a couple of times
at the wrong goal.
A fast-moving Encina 4W team up- !
set the dope yesterday afternoon to i
di ub the Alpha Delta by a 39 to 15
score. The hall boys displayed a classy
brand of floorwork and their shots i
just couldn't miss the hoop. Fisher,
center and "dead eye" for Encina,
sank eight field goals and two free j
throws for a total of 18 points. Linsey
starred at guard for the hall team. !
The score at half time was 21 to 5.
In a hectic fracas full of football
thrills, El Toro clipped and blocked |
its way to victory over a fast-charging ;
Phi Delt team. The game was close
as well as rough during the first half ,
and the score was only 4 to 1 at the |
end of the initial period. El Toro tal
lied first when Krause sneaked in a j
sucker shot. Krause ,by the way, was
the only one who could find the bas- !
ket, and looped in six points. "Joe" I
Bush and Rowley showed up well for j
the losers
Sequoia 1 played a great defensive
game to win from Encina 2E. The
freshmen were able to garner only
one bucket during the entire contest. ;
Palmberg played a neat game at for
ward for Sequoia and sank four pretty
shots. Cook ,at center, also showed j
up well for the victors. Weyman
played a flashy game for the Encina |
team and was high-scorer for the j
losers. At half time Sequoia led by a |
score of 8 to 3.
In the slowest game of the evening, j
Delta Chi fell before a better passing
S.A.E. team. Both outfits fumbled a ;
lot and neither squad could find the
basket consistently. Hedge, elongated j
center, starred for the winners and j
was high-point man of the contest
with seven markers to his credit, j
Pearson looked good for Delta Chi.
The Lawyers had an easy time scor
ing a lop-sided win from a ragged
D.K.E. team. The fraternity players j
couldn't seem to get going, while the
lawyers displayed some smooth team
work in the second period. Sayre and
Wisdom were the outstanding players,
and each tossed in four field goals for
the victors.
Encina 3E walked all over a speedy
Japanese squad. The latter players
were too short to cope with the fresh- !
men, and were lucky to get their i
hands on the hall. Nakano put in the \
only shot for the losing team. Kelly
tallied 10 of the hall boys' points,
while Dibble played a strong game at
standing guard for the winning outfit. |

Palmberg played a neat game at for
ward for Sequoia and sank four pretty
shots. Cook ,at center, also showed j
up well for the victors. Weyman

losers. At half time Sequoia led by a |
score of 8 to 3.
In the slowest game of the evening, j
Delta Chi fell before a better passing
S.A.E. team. Both outfits fumbled a ;
lot and neither squad could find the
basket consistently. Hedge, elongated j
center, starred for the winners and j
was high-point man of the contest
with seven markers to his credit, j
Pearson looked good for Delta Chi.
The Lawyers had an easy time scor
ing a lop-sided win from a ragged
D.K.E. team. The fraternity players j
couldn't seem to get going, while the
lawyers displayed some smooth team
work in the second period. Sayre and
Wisdom were the outstanding players,
and each tossed in four field goals for
the victors.
Encina 3E walked all over a speedy
Japanese squad. The latter players
were too short to cope with the fresh- !
men, and were lucky to get their i
hands on the hall. Nakano put in the \
only shot for the losing team. Kelly
tallied 10 of the hall boys' points,
while Dibble played a strong game at
standing guard for the winning outfit. |

Piling up the largest score to date i

Sigma Chi walloped Theta Chi by a
42 to 5 score in a one-sided game at
the Pavilion yesterday. The winners I
tossed in baskets at will, as the Theta
Chi boys didn't know what defense j
meant. Elliot, lanky center on the
Sigma Chi outfit, was high-point man
with 17 points. Klabau and S. Nye |
each sank four shots for the victors.
The last quarter developed into a
"comedy of errors," when Carr, of the

A fast-moving Encina 4W team up- !
