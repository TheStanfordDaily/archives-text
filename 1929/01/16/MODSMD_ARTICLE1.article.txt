# SENATE PASSES KELLOGG TREATY WITH VOTE 85-1
## Borah Yields Senate Report; Makes Pact Vote Possible Despite Offensive Attacks Blaine, Wisconsin, Only Solon In Negative; Nine Absent: All in Favor of Treaty 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. (/P) —
America's adherence to the Kellogg
multilateral treaty pledging the na
tions of the world to renounce war,
was voted today by the Senate, 85
to 1.
Applause of the women-filled gal
leries echoed the announcement of
the overwhelming vote. Mumblings
and some hisses from the galleries
greeted the reading by the Senate
clerk of the name of Senator Blaine,
Republican, of Wisconsin, as the only
one recorded in the negative.
A vote was made possible when
Chairman Borah of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, in charge of the
treaty's two weeks' journey through
the Senate, acceded to the demand
for the submission of an interpreta
tive report by his committee. He
made the report with the stipulation
that it was not to be considered as
changing the treaty in any way or
as effectuating any reservation* of it.
The report reiterated the previ
ously expressed views of Senator
Borah that the treaty did not curtail
America's right of self defense and
that the Monroe Doctrine was a part
of this country's system of national
defense. The report was laid before
ilie Senate but not acted upon.
Last-minute attacks on the treaty
were made by Senators Johnson, Re
publican, of California, and Glass,
Democrat, of Virginia, who described
it as "nothingness" and "not worth
the price of a postage stamp."
This resulted in Senator Borah ris
ing in defense of the treaty which
was signed last summer at Paris by
the representatives of the leading
powers of the world. The simple
worded instrument negotiated by
Secretary Kellogg has since been ac
cepted by sixty of the sixty-four in
dependent nations of the world.
"When you come to analyze what
is behind this treaty," roared Senator
Borah to the crowded chamber wait
ing to vote, "and consider what there
is behind all the other treaties of the
world, why should this be considered
as impractical or as an ideal beyond
the power of man to attain?"
Of the nine Senators absent, it was
announced that all would have voted
for ratification had they been present.
Senator Blaine, the lone opponent,
had offered a resolution declaring
that the Senate had not considered
the correspondence of the other pow
ers in connection with the treaty ne
gotiations as granting them any reser
vation under the treaty, Senator
Borah insisted this was not necessary
and without a record vote Blaine's
resolution was rejected overwhelm
ingly.

announced that all would have voted
for ratification had they been present.
Senator Blaine, the lone opponent,
had offered a resolution declaring
that the Senate had not considered
the correspondence of the other pow
ers in connection with the treaty ne
gotiations as granting them any reser
vation under the treaty, Senator
Borah insisted this was not necessary
and without a record vote Blaine's
resolution was rejected overwhelm

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. (/P) —
America's adherence to the Kellogg
multilateral treaty pledging the na
tions of the world to renounce war,
was voted today by the Senate, 85
to 1.
Applause of the women-filled gal
leries echoed the announcement of
the overwhelming vote. Mumblings
and some hisses from the galleries
greeted the reading by the Senate
clerk of the name of Senator Blaine,
Republican, of Wisconsin, as the only
one recorded in the negative.
A vote was made possible when
Chairman Borah of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, in charge of the
treaty's two weeks' journey through
the Senate, acceded to the demand
for the submission of an interpreta
tive report by his committee. He
made the report with the stipulation
that it was not to be considered as
changing the treaty in any way or
as effectuating any reservation* of it.
The report reiterated the previ
ously expressed views of Senator
Borah that the treaty did not curtail
America's right of self defense and
that the Monroe Doctrine was a part
of this country's system of national
defense. The report was laid before
ilie Senate but not acted upon.
Last-minute attacks on the treaty
were made by Senators Johnson, Re
publican, of California, and Glass,
Democrat, of Virginia, who described
it as "nothingness" and "not worth
the price of a postage stamp."
This resulted in Senator Borah ris
ing in defense of the treaty which
was signed last summer at Paris by
the representatives of the leading
powers of the world. The simple
worded instrument negotiated by
Secretary Kellogg has since been ac
cepted by sixty of the sixty-four in
dependent nations of the world.
"When you come to analyze what
is behind this treaty," roared Senator
Borah to the crowded chamber wait
ing to vote, "and consider what there
is behind all the other treaties of the
world, why should this be considered
as impractical or as an ideal beyond
the power of man to attain?"
