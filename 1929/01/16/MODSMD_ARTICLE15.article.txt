# EFREM ZIMBALIST NOT TO PLAY AT A.S.S.U. CONCERT
## Illness Forces Cancellation of Recital; Spalding to Appear April 4 
### 
Efrem Zimbalist will not appear in |
I the A.S.S.U. concert which was |
scheduled for tomorrow night, ac
cording to Sid Madden, concert man
ager. No concert will be held in its
place tomorrow, but Albert Spalding,
world-famous violinist, has been ob
tained to appear at Stanford on April
4. Tickets for the Zimbalist concert
I will give admittance to the Spalding
I concert April 4, and the seating ar
-1 rangement will remain the same.
| Zimbalist was forced to cancel all
his engagements for this season since
he has been very ill, and will not be
: able to appear for the remainder of
; the year.
It was considered fortunate that!
Spalding could be obtained at this
: time since he is much in demand, and
it was necessary to get a closed date '
} for the concert. Spalding is 40 years |
old, and an American. He made his
debut in Paris in 1905, and three years
I later made his American debut in |
New York City with the Damrosch i
j orchestra. He has securely estab- i
lished his reputation in Europe, hav- ,
ing been received enthusiastically in
England, France, Belgium, Holland,!
Germany, Italy, Austria, and Russia.
During the war he was a commis-
I sioned lieutenant in the Aviation
Corps of the United States Signal I
Service. He has composed a "Prelude ;
and Fugue," a set of variations of:
j "My Old Kentucky Home," and a i
j "Concerto quasi fantasia."
