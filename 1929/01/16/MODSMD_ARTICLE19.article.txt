## Visitors in Lead 23 to 9 at Middle of Second Period; Card Fight Brings Victory Fawcett Plays Outstanding Game at Forward; Varsity Outclassed in First Half 
### ANSON REEDER 
Stanford's basketball team rose to the
occasion again last night and staged a
great last minute comeback to triumph
over a fast, well-drilled quintet from
Santa Clara College by a 28-27 score.
The Cards football teams, not so long
ago, were nationally famous for their
second-half rallies, but no football team
representing this Institution ever came
from behind to overcome greater odds
than the Redshirts did no the court last
night.
With the score favoring the Brones
23 to 9 at the middle of the last half,
the Cards scored 13 consecutive points
before the visitors realized what had hap
pened. Then it was a battle to the finish.
With seven minutes to go Schuppert,
Santa Clara guard, sunk a basket to put
the visitors ahead three points. Berg
and Fawcctt retaliated with a field goal
apiece in quick succession; putting Stan
ford in the lead for the first time during
the contest. At this point Tampcke re
placed Berg at forward.
The pace was beginning to show on the
Bronc quintet. They called for extra
time out, a technical foul, giving the
Cards a free throw which Tampcke
failed to convert. But a moment later
Hawkins took a short pass from Fawcett
under the basket to sink another field
goal and put Stanford on the long end
of the count by three points. Connelly,
Santa Clara center, countered with a
bucket for the visitors on the next tip
off, but it was too late. The game end
ed a few seconds later with the Red
shirts leading by a lone marker.
It was a wonderful contest from the
spectators' point of view, with the Bronc
five showing a beautiful offense. The
Cards were completely outclassed during
the first half, and it looked as though
they were going to spoil the record set
by them so far this year. Conelly, of
the visitors, was high point man for the
game with twelve poits, but Fawcett was
not far behind with a total of ten. Al
though Santa Clara showed better team
work and passing, the Cards made up
for this deficit by determination and
fight. Tyler, a newcomer playing his
first game for Stanford showed plenty
of speed during his short stay in the
game. Rothert and Reynolds had a bad
evening, failing time and again to re
cover the ball off of the backboard.
Fawcett's floorwork was especially out
standing. Although he did not seem to
overtax himself, he was always there
when an emergency presented itself, and
that was often last night.
Santa Clara's quintet contributed about
five personal fouls to every two com
mited by Stanford. Each team con
verted approximately half of the free
throws allowed, although the Redshirts
looked rather bad the first half when
they failed to make good in their first
five attempts.
The Cards Lower Division trio, Haw
kins, Fawcett, and Reyolds, accounted
for twenty-one of the twenty-eight
counts.

five attempts.
The Cards Lower Division trio, Haw
kins, Fawcett, and Reyolds, accounted
for twenty-one of the twenty-eight
counts.
Stanford's basketball team rose to the
occasion again last night and staged a
great last minute comeback to triumph
over a fast, well-drilled quintet from
Santa Clara College by a 28-27 score.
The Cards football teams, not so long
ago, were nationally famous for their
second-half rallies, but no football team
representing this Institution ever came
from behind to overcome greater odds
than the Redshirts did no the court last
night.
With the score favoring the Brones
23 to 9 at the middle of the last half,
the Cards scored 13 consecutive points
before the visitors realized what had hap
pened. Then it was a battle to the finish.
With seven minutes to go Schuppert,
Santa Clara guard, sunk a basket to put
the visitors ahead three points. Berg
and Fawcctt retaliated with a field goal
apiece in quick succession; putting Stan
ford in the lead for the first time during
the contest. At this point Tampcke re
placed Berg at forward.
The pace was beginning to show on the
Bronc quintet. They called for extra
time out, a technical foul, giving the
Cards a free throw which Tampcke
failed to convert. But a moment later
Hawkins took a short pass from Fawcett
under the basket to sink another field
goal and put Stanford on the long end
of the count by three points. Connelly,
Santa Clara center, countered with a
bucket for the visitors on the next tip
off, but it was too late. The game end
ed a few seconds later with the Red
shirts leading by a lone marker.
It was a wonderful contest from the
spectators' point of view, with the Bronc
five showing a beautiful offense. The
Cards were completely outclassed during
the first half, and it looked as though
they were going to spoil the record set
by them so far this year. Conelly, of
the visitors, was high point man for the
game with twelve poits, but Fawcett was
not far behind with a total of ten. Al
though Santa Clara showed better team
work and passing, the Cards made up
for this deficit by determination and
fight. Tyler, a newcomer playing his
first game for Stanford showed plenty
of speed during his short stay in the
game. Rothert and Reynolds had a bad
evening, failing time and again to re
cover the ball off of the backboard.
Fawcett's floorwork was especially out
standing. Although he did not seem to
overtax himself, he was always there
when an emergency presented itself, and
that was often last night.
Santa Clara's quintet contributed about
five personal fouls to every two com
mited by Stanford. Each team con
verted approximately half of the free
throws allowed, although the Redshirts
looked rather bad the first half when
they failed to make good in their first
five attempts.
