						Practical Plan for Student Forums
## 
### 
Ihe Daily is forever calling for reform, we know. Alx)lish cheating,
bonfires, rooting rottenness, high-priced peanuts, etc., has often been
shouted from this housetop. Yet one proposal still remains to be given
utterance to: viz., that provision be made for periodically holding student
forums.
The need for popular assemblies where questions of both local and
extra-campus interest may be discussed will readily be recognized; when
and where to hold such forums is a problem not so easy to solve. We pro
pose that once every fortnight, or once a month, they be held in the Assem
bly Hall at some morning hour, say ten o'clock. These would not be Uni
versity assemblies, for which classes would be excused ; they would simply
be enlarged bullsessions at which any student might drop in to listen and
to express his opinion, upon the subject of the moment, or upon any sub
ject. Ihe forum ought to be informal, save that a chairman should preside
to prevent a Babel of asides from interrupting a speaker. Participants in
the discussion ought to have a sort of senatorial privilege of saying any
thing about anybody, but the audience ought to have a similar privilege of
groaning or catcalling at the speaker. Speeches might well be limited by
common consent to eight minutes, and anyhow not speeches, but simply
remarks, ought to be made. If the groups were at first small, the speaker
would need only to rise in his seat to make his comment.
Successive forums could be held at different hours on different days,
in order that those whom classes prevented from coming to one assembly
might attend the next. An hour which one often wastes could thus be
profitably employed.
You will ask, "Why start forums?" The answer is, because we have
none now, yet some place where questions can be mulled over would be ex
tremely useful. Student opinion is a very important thing; that is, it
would be if it existed. But who knows what it is? This paper is supposed
to express it, yet to the Daily, student opinion is usually the quite fallible
judgment of the editor. From time to time, letters to Campus Opinion
come in, filling perhaps a column and a half per day. Now it is certain that
if there is one who will take the trouble to write down bis opinion, there
are fifty who would willingly speak theirs. Does anyone think the Board
of Athletic Control is corrupt, that the honor system is impossible, that
the Executive Committee is too slow to act in its affairs? Let him stand
and say why he so believes, and find an answer. Has someone a grievance
against the faculty, or against some professor, or against some course?
Let him air it.
There always are topics to talk about—if the campus doesn't provide
them, we can discuss California or U.S.C. or the national government or
women's rights or prohibition or companionate marriage, ad infinitum.
The point is, that Stanford is a small community wherein everyone is
relatively well acquainted and congenial. Hence, if we would think gre
gariously, as well as live that way, we would do ourselves great good.
What do the student body and its officers seriously think of the forum
plan ?
