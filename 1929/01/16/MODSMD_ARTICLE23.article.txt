The Daily Californian, our esteemed back-bay contemp'ry, commenced
the second semester last Saturday with an enlarged, eight-column, ten-page
edition. The sheet is now of metropolitan size, and, influenced by this, its
editors seem to sigh after metropolitan influence, quantities of advertising,
and bewilderingly complete coverage of everything under the sun.
All the Daily can do is to offer its congratulations and look on in envy,
for it is considerably behind the Calif ornian in bulk.
With righteous swelling of the bosom, the Calif ornian cackles over its
new-laid egg:
"Now we have adopted the true "metropolitan size." All this growth
speaks plainly of the enormous increase in advertising volume which has
made this possible, and along with this development has come the notable
professionalization of the editorial staff to result in interesting, better
written news stories.
"The Calif ornian has ever been 'loath to concede a backward step.' "
As far as our limited observation of the Calif ornian has extended, it
has ever been loath to concede anything—which pertains to Stanford su
l>eriority, at least. But how is it going to reconcile its loathing with the
recent exploit of Mr. Riegels?
