# Undoubtedly a Prize Worth Going After
## 
### 
The Daily lias noted with intense satisfaction the fine play of Coach
Husky Hunt's basketball team. With the gang playing that sort of ball
and with the price of peanuts down to five cents again (as a result, we
modestly believe, of our editorial complaint), winter quarter begins to be
tolerable. However, the team's ability to shoot fouls is distressingly
weak. In order to encourage proficiency, we are offering a bound file of
the quarter's editorials to the team if in any three games it succeeds in
shooting 75 per cent of the free throws it is awarded.
We gathered from the tenor of the arguments presented in Monday
night's debate that as a result of modern advertising the installments of
the fathers shall be visited upon the children of the third and fourth gen
erations of them that read the Saturday Evening Post.
