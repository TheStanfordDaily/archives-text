THE PROGRESSIVE MEXICAN
And now the Mexican, whose mis
management in things governmental
has been the classic joke among na
tions for many a year, suggests a so
lution to the liquor problem hereto
fore passed by or unknown by these
same laughing nations.
His "gringo" brother to the north
seized the bull by the horns and at
tempted to throw him by one gigantic
twist Being a novice at throwing
such animals, his effort proved to be
nothing more than a "noble experi
ment." He would legislate a custom
of the ages into oblivion in one fell
swoop, the Eighteenth Amendement.
With less rash action, the Mexican
proposes to attain prohibition by a
gradual process. He will provide other
diversions for his people and educate

them to its establishment. He knows
that his people are musical and that
they enjoy sports. By encouraging
these and by enlightenment, he will
make prohibition a fact and not a
farce.
Fortunately for him, the peasants
drink sparingly and the upper classes
with moderation. Drinking is still an
art among them. The worst thorn in
his side will be the foreigner who,
unlike the peasant craves drink and
unlike the higher classes doesn't
know the meaning of moderation.
The superior "gringo" might note
well this move and learn a lesson in
the ways of progress. A mechanical
device may be invented in a day and
bring about an immediate change to
ward progress, but a social trait can
not be eradicated in so sudden a man
ner. â€”Calvin D. Wood.
