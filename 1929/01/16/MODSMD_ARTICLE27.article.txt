The Far East. A Political and Diplo
matic History. By Payson J.
Treat. Harper's Historical Series.
(New York: Harper & Bros. $5.)
A specialist in this subject, Profes
sor Treat of the History department,
has devoted twenty years to the study
and teaching of the political develop
ment of the chief nations of the Far
East and their international relations.
This book he has prepared for the
double purpose of furnishing a text
book for students and providing the
general reader with a work of refer
ence which will simplify and illumi
nate the many puzzling questions
which constantly disturb those who
try to read intelligently the masses of
dispatches and letters from the Orient
increasingly appearing in the news
papers.
In the first sections he surveys
China and Japan in a birds-eye view
of their development to 1895. The
third and last section deals with both
nations and their internal and inter
national developments from 1895 to
1927, with additional chapters on the
United States and the Philippines and
Orientals in the United States.
The work is scholarly and thorough
in its presentation, while the refer
ences at the end of each chapter, the
ten pages of bibliographical notes and
the full index, filling almost twenty
pages, greatly enhance its usefulness
for both the student and the general
reader. Another gratifying feature is
the series of outline maps, numbering
over a dozen. —Clifford F. Weigle.

Our Daily Bread. Frederick Philip
Grove. (New Yotk: Macmillan
Co. 1928.)
Right at present novels by Scandi
navian writers are immensely popu
lar with the reading public. Undset's
"The Axe" and Rolvaag's "Giants in
the Earth" are the most outstanding.
In "Our Daily Bread" we have a book
by an American concerning an Ameri
can family to remind us that it is not
alone sturdy foreign blood that dedi
cates itself in the new world to the
toil and hardships of farming and
raising a big family.
Like the novels of the above dis
tinguished foreign writers, "Our Daily
Bread" is characterized by power and
sternness. They are certainly not
light books. However, the first two are
penetrated with a quality of idealism
that gives even their somberness a
glamour, while in Grove's book there
is no romantic idealism, no glamour
—only a stark portrayal of family life
with the weary montonous details of
farming for a background.
There is not a single line of humor
in the entire book. Because of this, it
is not pleasant reading, for its grim
realism —powerful though it is—un
relieved by subtlety or by humor, robs
the book of vitality and leaves it
drably sordid.
The story is built around John El
liot and his life's dream of seeing
about him a large and devoted fam
ily, made a circle of harmony and
strength by their common love of the
soil and each other. But after the

death of his wife slow disintegration
jcomes to the family he has founded.
; The lives of all the children are
; shadowed by tragedy. Failure over
j takes one, death another, and dis
grace a third, so that John Elliot dies
j a lonely, broken old man realizing
j that his children whose lives he had
tried to mould have grown away from
|liim so far that they are utter stran
• gers to him, and enemies to each
' other.
j All of this is told with a rigorous
! simplicity pushed almost to the point
of rawness. The annals of a family
I are put down, bald and unadorned,
with degeneration as the keynote
j throughout. Seldom will one find a
I book so strongly depressing as this
: one. —M. L. R.

Bread" is characterized by power and
sternness. They are certainly not
light books. However, the first two are
penetrated with a quality of idealism
that gives even their somberness a
glamour, while in Grove's book there
is no romantic idealism, no glamour
—only a stark portrayal of family life
with the weary montonous details of
farming for a background.
There is not a single line of humor
in the entire book. Because of this, it
is not pleasant reading, for its grim
realism —powerful though it is—un
relieved by subtlety or by humor, robs
the book of vitality and leaves it
drably sordid.
The story is built around John El
liot and his life's dream of seeing
about him a large and devoted fam
ily, made a circle of harmony and
strength by their common love of the
soil and each other. But after the

death of his wife slow disintegration
jcomes to the family he has founded.
; The lives of all the children are

j a lonely, broken old man realizing
j that his children whose lives he had
tried to mould have grown away from
|liim so far that they are utter stran

' other.
j All of this is told with a rigorous
! simplicity pushed almost to the point

The Far East. A Political and Diplo
matic History. By Payson J.
Treat. Harper's Historical Series.
(New York: Harper & Bros. $5.)
A specialist in this subject, Profes
sor Treat of the History department,
has devoted twenty years to the study
and teaching of the political develop
ment of the chief nations of the Far
East and their international relations.
This book he has prepared for the
double purpose of furnishing a text
book for students and providing the
general reader with a work of refer
ence which will simplify and illumi
nate the many puzzling questions
which constantly disturb those who
try to read intelligently the masses of
dispatches and letters from the Orient
increasingly appearing in the news
papers.
In the first sections he surveys
China and Japan in a birds-eye view
of their development to 1895. The
third and last section deals with both
nations and their internal and inter
national developments from 1895 to
1927, with additional chapters on the
United States and the Philippines and
Orientals in the United States.
The work is scholarly and thorough
in its presentation, while the refer
ences at the end of each chapter, the
ten pages of bibliographical notes and
the full index, filling almost twenty
pages, greatly enhance its usefulness
for both the student and the general
reader. Another gratifying feature is
the series of outline maps, numbering
over a dozen. —Clifford F. Weigle.
