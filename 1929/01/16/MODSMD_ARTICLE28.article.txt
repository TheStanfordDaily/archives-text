Though Stanford has a beautiful
campus, that of the University of Illi
nois would be superior if the climate
there were as good as that of Northern
California. So "Butch" Nowack, cap
tain of the 1928 Illinois football team
and a mpmber of the All-Eastern
eleven which played in the Shrine
game December 29, declared in a re
cent interview printed in the Daily
Illini.
Quoting from the Illini: "The Cali
fornia universities all have beautiful
campuses, according to Captain Now
ack, especially Leland Stanford; but
he attributes their beauty to the
southern climate and feels that Illi
nois would far surpass Stanford as
far as campuses are concerned if the
Illinois climate were as good.
"The Leland Stanford buildings are
all made of a cream-colored stone, and
are all set fairly close together. The
cathedral with its walls of variegated
colors, was one of the most impres
sive sights he had ever seen, accord
ing to 'Butch.' Captain Nowack wan
chiefly impressed by the western hos
pitality."
