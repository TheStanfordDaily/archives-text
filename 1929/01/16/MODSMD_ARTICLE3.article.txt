# HOLY SEE PLANNED AS NEW TERRITORY UNDER PAPAL RULE
## 
### 
ROME, Jan. 15. (;P)—Methods of
I; notifying all powers which have repre
sentatives accredited to the Holy See
of the agreement between the church
j and the Italian State for a solution
iof the Roman question, were dis
j cussed in Vatican circles today. It
was understood when the agreement
»J is concluded by the signatures of
j Cardinal Gasparri, as Secretary of
s | State for the Holy See, and Benito
! Mussolini, as Foreign Minister of
1 ! Italy, a concordat would be adopted
j for transmission to all governments
concerned.
Previous to this notification a com
munication would be sent to the same
- I powers through regular diplomatic
: channels that an agreement had been
-; reached whereby the Holy See would
. i thereafter constitute a completely
> | free and independent territory under
j the sovereignty of the Roman Pontiff.
- ! There still is considerable iudeci-
C sion, in view of the Pope's repeated
s wish that he have no "subjects" as
i | to how the new State would be in
i habited; it is generally supposed the
, ! Vatican authorities would gradually
r ! endeavor to group all outlying offices
within the newly defined territory for
i reasons of convenience and centrali
-1 zation. Then it would intimate to
powers having embassies or legations
; at the Holy See that it might be ex
! peditious to erect their buildings
within the confines of that territory.
Thus the inhabitants of the new
defined tract would, in the main, be
of non-Italian nationality. There
would then be no need for burdening
the Pontiff with administrative duties
|in connection with civil courts and
similar institutions.
The Vatican grounds already has
its own fire department and its own
j soldiers —such as the Swiss guards
and the Palatine guards. Therefore
, little or no change is contemplated in
j the organization of the internal af
fairs of the Pope's domain as it now
i exists.
Vatican circles are giving consider- l
j able credit for the favorable outcome ;
|of the negotiations with the Fascist I
| government, or for first formulating'
! the ideas on which those negotiations
j were based, to Cardinal Franpis
Bourne, Archbishop of Westminster,
England. They say that in 1911 he de
livered an address before the annual
Catholic congress at Newcastle-on-
Tyne in which he said:
"There is no desire on the part of
i the papacy for temporal dominion as
such. There is no lust for territory
and no wish to play a part as one of
the leading powers of the earth in
competition for increased worldly pos
sessions."
