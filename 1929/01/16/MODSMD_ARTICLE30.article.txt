# Sorority Bidding Will Be Held Late This Afternoon
## 
### 
The final period of women's rush
ing ended with dinner last night. This
second period lasted six days, during
which the sorority women entertained
the new women at both lunch and
dinner. Today is a day of silence,
when no sorority woman may com
municate in any way with a new
woman. The definite time of bidding
is not yet known, though it will take
place at Roble Hall sometime late
today.
