# UNIVERSITIES SHOULD HAVE SCHOOLS OF ADMINISTRATION, DURANT STATES
## Author of "The Story of Philosophy" and of "Transition" Wants Public Officials Education for Office

By GUNNAR NORBERG
"Every university should have a j
school of administration —state as j
well as municipal administration —a
school that should correspond to a j
pood school of medicine, a school
practical as well as theoretical —like ;
a good medical school." So says Will
Durant.
Seated at a little table —a type- j
writer at his elbow —in the room in ;
which he was doing his writing, Dr. |
Durant, the author of "The Story of ,
Philosophy" and of "Transition" i
spoke early Monday afternoon at the
Hotel St. Francis, San Francisco, dur
ing an interview given the Daily—
spoke of a new sort of school open
only to holders of bachelor degrees, a
school where future tenants of public
offices —in city, state, or nation —
would have to be educated before
they could even be candidates for
any public post they might wish to
hold.
Not Eligible Unless Trained
"Like a good medical school, for i
instance. We have some pretty good !
medical schools, haven't we? But we !
did not always have good medical
schools, did we?" Durant answered
his own questions. "No, but we did
not always have good medical schools
—but, we have some pretty good ones
today.
"Just as no one now is permitted
to prescribe medicines unless he has
received specific and extended prepa
ration —just so, ultimately the hope
would be, that nobody would be eligi
ble to public office unless he had first !
been trained in such a way as I pro
pose, in such a school of administra- I
tion as I would have in every univer- !
sity." j
"This school of administration: I
what would you have in its curricu
lum?" Durant was asked.
"Curriculum? That is not for me
to say. The city managers, the may
ors: they would have to decide what
that would be." Durant smiled. Not
so long ago had it been since he, Dur
ant, had spoken naught too highly of '
mayors, and such. Though he would j
say nothing of what the curriculum !
of the school he proposed should :

have in it, he said this: "I would
have the course of study cover a
j period of four years, and further that
he would have established as a pre
requisite to matriculation in a school
of administration graduation from a
college.
Eliminate Nominations
"Not only would I have these
, schools established in the universi
ties, but I would also build up public
; opinion so that the voters would in
j elections prefer men graduated from
these schools of administration.
"The final goal would be the elimina
tion of nominations. People would be
free to vote for anyone, properly
trained, who would offer himself as a
candidate for office —the lower grades
of public office at first, of course. You
would not have a man just graduated
from a school of administration run
ning for mayor of New York City.
Would you? No.
"A successful career in a lesser
public office would be demanded of a
man who would offer himself for a
I higher one."
This limitation of those who might
| hold public office to graduates of
schools of administraton would have
a profound effect on a certain concep
tion, more or less current in America
touay, of what democracy here in
these United States entitles a man to.
Restrict Democracy
Said Durant, "Of course, the demo
cratic right to be elected to office
would be restricted. To offset this,
we should have equality of education
al opportunity. There should be pro
-1 vided municipal and state scholar
ships that would make possible the
I sending on to higher institutions of
! those best fitted to go on.
| "Every adult should have the right
! to vote and every person should have
an equal opportunity to fit himself
i for office. But public office should be
cpen only to the fit.
"I do not pretend to solve any eco
nomic problem. I do not urge rule of
the strong by the weak. What I do
! say is this: a person who would hold
public office should be at least trained
as well in his way as a person who
would practice medicine must in an
other way be trained."

"Every university should have a j

a good medical school." So says Will

only to holders of bachelor degrees, a
school where future tenants of public
offices —in city, state, or nation —
would have to be educated before
they could even be candidates for
any public post they might wish to
hold.
Not Eligible Unless Trained
"Like a good medical school, for i
instance. We have some pretty good !
medical schools, haven't we? But we !
did not always have good medical
schools, did we?" Durant answered
his own questions. "No, but we did
not always have good medical schools
—but, we have some pretty good ones
today.
"Just as no one now is permitted
to prescribe medicines unless he has
received specific and extended prepa
ration —just so, ultimately the hope
would be, that nobody would be eligi
ble to public office unless he had first !
been trained in such a way as I pro
pose, in such a school of administra- I
tion as I would have in every univer- !
sity." j
"This school of administration: I
what would you have in its curricu
lum?" Durant was asked.
"Curriculum? That is not for me
to say. The city managers, the may
ors: they would have to decide what
that would be." Durant smiled. Not
so long ago had it been since he, Dur
ant, had spoken naught too highly of '
mayors, and such. Though he would j
say nothing of what the curriculum !
of the school he proposed should :

have in it, he said this: "I would
have the course of study cover a
j period of four years, and further that
he would have established as a pre
requisite to matriculation in a school
of administration graduation from a
college.
Eliminate Nominations
"Not only would I have these
, schools established in the universi
ties, but I would also build up public
; opinion so that the voters would in
j elections prefer men graduated from
these schools of administration.
"The final goal would be the elimina
tion of nominations. People would be
free to vote for anyone, properly
trained, who would offer himself as a
candidate for office —the lower grades
of public office at first, of course. You
would not have a man just graduated
from a school of administration run
ning for mayor of New York City.
Would you? No.
"A successful career in a lesser
public office would be demanded of a
man who would offer himself for a
I higher one."
This limitation of those who might
| hold public office to graduates of
schools of administraton would have
a profound effect on a certain concep
tion, more or less current in America
touay, of what democracy here in
these United States entitles a man to.
Restrict Democracy
Said Durant, "Of course, the demo
cratic right to be elected to office
would be restricted. To offset this,
we should have equality of education
al opportunity. There should be pro
-1 vided municipal and state scholar
ships that would make possible the
I sending on to higher institutions of
! those best fitted to go on.
| "Every adult should have the right
! to vote and every person should have
an equal opportunity to fit himself
i for office. But public office should be
cpen only to the fit.
"I do not pretend to solve any eco
nomic problem. I do not urge rule of
the strong by the weak. What I do
! say is this: a person who would hold
public office should be at least trained
as well in his way as a person who
would practice medicine must in an
other way be trained."
By GUNNAR NORBERG
"Every university should have a j
school of administration —state as j
well as municipal administration —a
school that should correspond to a j
pood school of medicine, a school
practical as well as theoretical —like ;
a good medical school." So says Will
Durant.
Seated at a little table —a type- j
writer at his elbow —in the room in ;
which he was doing his writing, Dr. |
Durant, the author of "The Story of ,
Philosophy" and of "Transition" i
spoke early Monday afternoon at the
Hotel St. Francis, San Francisco, dur
ing an interview given the Daily—
spoke of a new sort of school open
only to holders of bachelor degrees, a
school where future tenants of public
offices —in city, state, or nation —
would have to be educated before
they could even be candidates for
any public post they might wish to
hold.
Not Eligible Unless Trained
"Like a good medical school, for i
