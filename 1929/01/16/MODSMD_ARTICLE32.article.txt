In a desperate fourth-quarter rally the
Phi Sigs overcame El Capitan's 14-8 lead
to tie the score 14-14 and win by a single
field goal in an overtime period. This game
was the most rousing of the day. At no
time except in the extra period did the
Phi Sigs forge to the lead.
Delta Tau Delta won from Encina 1W
in a slow and ragged contest. Passing
was bad, shooting worse, and teamwork
was decidedly missing on both sides. Per
liaps the best man on the floor was
Sachse for the Delts, who played guard
and broke up consistently the Hall team's
attempts to score.
Playing tiie best basketball of the day,
Encina 3W trampled over a fiat-footed
Zete five. Stump was by all odds the best
man on the floor and was high-point man
for the Encina team as well, with a total
of 13 points. The passing attack com
pletely fooled the Zetes, and the Encina
five sank baskets from all parts of the
court.
Encina IE forfeited its match with the
Alpha Sigs by failing to appear on the
court when the game was called.
