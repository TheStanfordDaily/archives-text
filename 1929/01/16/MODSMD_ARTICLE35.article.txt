# SPORTS OF 1929
## An Olympic Baby 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
About a year and a half ago the
sophomore class of Thornton Town
ship High School, near Chicago, held
a picnic. A girls' race was one of the
events put on as part of the day's
amusement, and it was won by a
pretty little lass whom everyone knew
as "Babe."
The following winter this same
Babe put on a nifty exhibition of plain
and fancy sprinting to catch a street
car. She caught it, of course, and one
of her teachers observed her puffing
and panting and was reminded of her
race at the sophomore picnic. "Why
don't you take up running seriously?"
he asked her. "There's an indoor
sixty-yard race for girls in Chicago in
a couple of weeks. Do a little training
and see how you make out."
So "Babe" trained seriously for her
first real race by running up and

I down the corridors of the school, and
iin the competition a little later
finished second, only six inches be
; hind the famous Helen Filkey. Next
i she entered an outdoor 100-meter
dash, and ran the distance in the
phenomenal time of twelve flat, de
feating her indoor conqueror by five
i or six yards. That won her a trip to
Newark and the final Olympic try
! outs, where she finished two inches
' behind Elta Cartwright and made the
United States team.
That is the track experience previ
ous to the Olympic Games of Eliza
beth Robinson, America's one girl
winner in the games at Amsterdam.
The rest is history—her victory over
I the German and the two Canadians in
world's record time —and her triumph
al return to the country she so ably
j represented.
