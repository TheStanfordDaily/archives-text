All those romantic "Sally" songs
find their embodiment in the person
o£ witty little Sally O'Neil, moving
picture flapper. If you have been won
dering what's become of Sally lately,
take a run up to Oakland —she's mak
ing personal appearances for Fan
clion and Marco there this week.
Sally is not just a flapper; begorra,
she's wearing a green chip on her
shoulder. A real Irish disposition is
hers, and that's why she is so cute.
Black is black and white is white
when Sally talks. The Irish fear no
one.
Had to Come West
Four years ago, she told me, her
family—which includes a generous
number of brothers and sisters —
moved to California because Sally
had a weak heart and was threatened
with rheumatism. (Shall we credit
the climate with her present vim and
vigor?) Sally was just an average
pretty girl with no suspicions of what
the future was to bring. She and her
brother happened to go to the Metro-
Goldwyn studio one day with a friend
wlio had business with Marshall Nei
lan, the director.
Neilan had a story called "Mike"
for which he had to have a star. Mary
Pickford at first planned to play the
leading role —that of an Irish tomboy
—but changed her mind. Neilan spied
Sally waiting for her friend and told
her to come down for a test next
morning. The evening of the next day
Sally, absolutely inexperienced in
ways cinematic, was cast in the role
Mary Pickford had been slated for,
and was given a five-year starring
contract! Who says there isn't a
Santa Claus?
Was Lucky
Sally admits it was just pure luck
that got her into the movies, but
she's always believed in the luck of
the Irish! She began at the same time

! as Joan Crawford and William Haines
J did, playing with them in "Sally, Irene,
■ and Mary," and other popular hits,
i Then, when Sally's name drew crowds
I
I into the theatres, Metro Goldwyn
| started to put her into poor pictures.
Sally got fighting mad and finally got
the company to cancel her contract.
Now she is free-lancing—under con
tract only for one picture at a time.
"Lots of the others would walk out,
too," she told me, "but they haven't
enough backbone. I got along fine
with everyone but the front office.
They gave me the most inappropriate
roles —I woukln't stand for it! I'd
rather not earn another penny than
do things I'm not suited for."
Sally is an avid picture fan herself.
Richard Dix is her favorite hero, and
Gloria Swanson her ideal actress.
"Gloria got started right. She never
got into the type rut —played all sorts
of characters," she explained. Sally
thinks that once a star is definitely
accepted by the public as a certain
type that it is practically impossible
for the player to be successful in
other kinds of parts.
Likes Football
When football is mentioned, Sally
knows her gridiron. Her brother is
Jerry Noonan, former all-American
hero at Notre Dame. Sally was official
mascot for Notre Dame at one of the
big games with U.S.C., and she is a
rabid supporter of her brother's alma
mater.
Sally, who is in her early twenties,
pretty, and an exceptionally good
dancer, was asked by the producers '
if there were any more at home like
her. So she obligingly introduced one
of her sisters to Hollywood, and that
sister is now well-known as Molly
O'Day, leading lady for Richard Bar- i
thelmess.
After several months of a personal
appearance tour, Sally goes to New
York to make a talking picture. The
movies can't spare her anv lonerer.
