, ; Helen Masters Bunting, head of the
| women's physical education depart
' ment, recently elected member of the
Executive Committee of the Women's
. I Division of the National Amateur Ath
letic Federation, explained yesterday
[ the origin, purpose, and ideals of the
; j Federation. Miss Bunting has been
j very active in national women's ath
letic affairs, having just returned from
a conference of the Federation in New
| York City.
"The Women's Division of the Na
tional Amateur Athletic Federation
was organized in 1923 in Washington,
D.C., under the leadership of Mrs.
I Herbert Hoover who became chair
man of the executive committee of the
organization as formed at that time,"
Miss Bunting explained. "The purpose
was to endeavor to establish nation
ally the right standards for conduct
of women's athletics."
Miss Bunting went on to say that
Mrs. Hoover remained chairman of
the executive committee for several
years until the press of duties in
other lines caused her to give up the
position. Mrs. Hoover then was made
vice-chairman of the Board of Direc
tors which was formed last year, com
posed of 17 members, a Board whose
purpose it is to make contacts in the ,
United States. Mrs. Henry Alva 1
Strong of Washington, D.C., is chair- !
man. Miss Julia George of San Fran-!
Cisco and Miss Elizabeth Alley of
Santa Barbara represent the West on
the committee.
The present Executive Committee
to which Miss Bunting was recently
i elected consists of nine members
chosen from all over the United
States, and handles the technical de
tails of the organization. Ethel Per
rin, director of the American Child
Health Association, is chairman.
"The Federation wishes to empha- i
| size mass participation and 'sports for j
all.' not for a few star athletes," Miss !

! Bunting pointed out. "It also empha
; sizes the need for proper leadership,
i leadership by women in girls' sports;
the need for adequate medical exami
nation and medical follow-up work
| for all women taking part in athletics
in the United States; the adaptation
I of activities to the individual accord-;
! ing to age, health .strength, and physi
cal capacity; the prevention of com-I
! mercialized sports for women; the
i educational aims and objectives of
| women's sports; and the advisability
j of simplicity of awards for athletic
achievement. The Federation lays em-'
! phasis on the sport rather than the
individual competitor."
j As a summarization Miss Bunting
1 explained that the main ideal may be ]
; put in these words: "Wholesome mass
: participation for all under the right
kind of leadership."
