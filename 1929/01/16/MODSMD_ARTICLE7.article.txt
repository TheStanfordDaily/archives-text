# SHOW ENGINEERS MOVIES OF NEW CASCADE TUNNEL
## 
### 
Motion pictures of America's long- j
jest railway tunnel were shown at (
I the Assembly Hall last night by the j
' Stanford branch of the American In- j
stitute of Electrical Engineers. Carl
Koch, an electrical engineering gradu-
J ate, made a short preliminary talk
I on the history of the use of electric
power on the Great Northern railroad
|in Washington on which the seven
; and one-half mile tunnel was built.
The Cascade tunnel was construct
!ed at a cost of $15,000,000 and the \
work took three years. It eliminates
many curves and several miles of
| snow sheds. The work was hindered
by shale formations under the moun
tain and by the presence of large ,
underground streams of water.
Two reels of pictures, showing the
construction of the great generators
necessary in the production of elec- ,
trie power at high voltage, were ex- j
hibited. The largest generators are j
! said to weigh 100 tons, and some have j
! 100 miles of wire in them. Pictures
of the production of artificial light- j
! ning and other experimental work in
j electricity were included in the two ;
reels.
Next Wednesday evening another
set of motion pictures will be ex- I
hibited at the Little Theatre. These i
1 pictures will show the development
of some of the larger generating
; plants of the West, and some of the
major accomplishments of electrical :
engineering.
