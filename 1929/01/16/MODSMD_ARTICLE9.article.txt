### 
"Voting a $50 contribution to the
Hammer and Coffin Society's theatre
fund and promising another $50 "on
the condition that ten other fraterni
ties donate an amount of $50 or more
each," the members of Theta Xi yes
terday added new impetus to the stu
dent fund for a new Stanford theatre.
The following let,ter was received
by Jack Shoup, president of Hammer
and Coffin:
"The Theta Xi Fraternity, desiring
to promote interest in the new thea
tre among the Stanford fraternities,
has voted a fifty-dollar contribution
to the existing fund. You will find the
check enclosed.
"An additional fifty dollars has
been voted to be given, on the con
dition that ten other Stanford fraterni
ties donate an amount of fifty dollars
or more each.
"Sincerely,
"Ed Smith, President."
Commenting on the fraternity's con
tribution, Shoup said:
"It's a mighty fine idea, and I'm
glad to see Theta Xi come through
that way. I hope that the other fra
ternities and sororities and other so
cieties will follow the lead."
The Old Boy stressed the idea that,
though the contributions are earnest
ly solicited, they are to be purely
voluntary on the part of those con
tributing. Hammer and Coffin Society
feels that every one on the campus
should be interested in the fund.
The contributions received by the
society to date are as follows: $100,
Hammer and Coffin Society; $1,000,
anonymous; $50, El Cuadro; $125,
Stanford Studios; and $50, Theta Xi,
making a total of $1,325.
