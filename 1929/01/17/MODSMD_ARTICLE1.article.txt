# VARSITY CAGERS LEAVE FOR S. C. FRIDAY EVENING
## Coach Husky Hunt Plans to Take Squad of Fourteen Men to Battle With Troy Team's Efficiency Lowered By Playing of Fawcett While Weak From Illness 
### ANSON REEDER 
Stanford's miracle team, the big
surprise in Coast basketball, will en
train here tomorrow night on the
Lark for Los Angeles where they will
meet the Southern California Trojans
on their home court, in the second
conference game of the season, Sat
urday night. With the exception of
Red Thompson, guard, who is still out
because of ineligibility, the entire
squad will make the trip.
Those who will go south are Coach
Husky Hunt, Manager Major Godsol,
.and forwards, Fawcett, Berg, Lawry,
Sexson, Moffatt, and Loomis; guards,
Tyler, Tampcke, Reynolds, Captain
Rothert, and Stewart; centers, Mc-
Candless, Hawkins, and Mears.
Is Miracle-Working Outfit
Now that a few hours have elapsed
and everyone is able to look at the
lesults of the Stanford-Bronc battle
with a more or less unbiased point of
view, they begin to wonder just what
kind of a miracle-working outfit this
Card quintet is. With the exception of
the last ten minutes of the contest,
Stanford was outplayed by the visi
tors, who displayed better teamwork
and better passing. But in that last
ten minutes the Cards crept up, and
finally passed the Broncs on the home
stretch in a basket-shooting barrage.
There were several things which
contributed to Stanford's inability to
get started. One was that the team
had only one day to prepare a de
fense against the Bronc attack, which
was different from any encountered
so far this season. The fact that the
Cards had worked hard all last week
in preparation for the U.C.L.A. game,
and were affected by the letdown,
may have been another cause.
Fawcett Plays While HI
The Card offense was undoubtedly
weakened, too, by the illness of Vance
Fawcett, who, disregarding his own
condition, played the whole game.
And granting that he played a whale
of a game, which he did, the efficiency
of himself and the team as a whole
was cut down because of his incapaci
tation.
Stanford showed especial weakness
in the Bronc game at recovering the
ball off the backboard, following in on
long shots, and making free throws.
As the season progresses they will
probably improve in all three depart
ments, but if they don't display some
rapid improvement in making free
throws, they may lose to the Trojans
by a margin representing the number
missed.
In studying the box score of Tues
day's contest, it was interesting to
note that the Cards committed only
one personal foul against ten for the
visitors.

Card quintet is. With the exception of
the last ten minutes of the contest,
Stanford was outplayed by the visi
tors, who displayed better teamwork
and better passing. But in that last
ten minutes the Cards crept up, and
finally passed the Broncs on the home
stretch in a basket-shooting barrage.
There were several things which
contributed to Stanford's inability to
get started. One was that the team
had only one day to prepare a de
fense against the Bronc attack, which
was different from any encountered
so far this season. The fact that the
Cards had worked hard all last week
in preparation for the U.C.L.A. game,
and were affected by the letdown,
may have been another cause.
Fawcett Plays While HI
The Card offense was undoubtedly
weakened, too, by the illness of Vance
Fawcett, who, disregarding his own
condition, played the whole game.
And granting that he played a whale
of a game, which he did, the efficiency
of himself and the team as a whole
was cut down because of his incapaci
tation.
Stanford showed especial weakness
in the Bronc game at recovering the
ball off the backboard, following in on
long shots, and making free throws.
As the season progresses they will
probably improve in all three depart
ments, but if they don't display some
rapid improvement in making free
throws, they may lose to the Trojans
by a margin representing the number
missed.
In studying the box score of Tues
day's contest, it was interesting to
note that the Cards committed only
one personal foul against ten for the
visitors.
Stanford's miracle team, the big
surprise in Coast basketball, will en
train here tomorrow night on the
Lark for Los Angeles where they will
meet the Southern California Trojans
on their home court, in the second
conference game of the season, Sat
urday night. With the exception of
Red Thompson, guard, who is still out
because of ineligibility, the entire
squad will make the trip.
Those who will go south are Coach
Husky Hunt, Manager Major Godsol,
.and forwards, Fawcett, Berg, Lawry,
Sexson, Moffatt, and Loomis; guards,
Tyler, Tampcke, Reynolds, Captain
Rothert, and Stewart; centers, Mc-
Candless, Hawkins, and Mears.
Is Miracle-Working Outfit
Now that a few hours have elapsed
and everyone is able to look at the
lesults of the Stanford-Bronc battle
with a more or less unbiased point of
view, they begin to wonder just what
kind of a miracle-working outfit this
Card quintet is. With the exception of
the last ten minutes of the contest,
Stanford was outplayed by the visi
tors, who displayed better teamwork
and better passing. But in that last
