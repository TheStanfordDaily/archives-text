Kappa Sigma played good basket
ball yesterday to beat a strong Encina
4E team. The fraternity players
showed better teamw.ork and led dur
ing the entire contest. Scoring half
of his team's points and working well
at center, Mann was easily the star
of the game. Morton, at guard, showed
up well for the winners. Smith was
the main cog of the Encina outfit.
A smooth-passing Phi Kappa Psi
squad piled up 28 points to trim
Alpha Tau Omega. The latter play
ers fumbled every time they had the
ball. Weaver led the attack for the
Phi Psi's by sinking seven goals and
two free throws for a total of 10
points. Davis, rangy center for the
victors, handled the ball well, as did
Hossan of the A.T.O.'s.
Missing a large number of cinch
shots, an eratie Breakers team was
lucky to score a 14 to 6 victory over
Theta Xi. Goldsmith, at running
guard for Breakers, was the outstand
ing player of the contest. E. Smith
stood out for Theta Xi.
After holding Independent 1 on
even terms during the initial period,
Los Arcos' defense went to pieces
and the club outfit went down to de
feat by a score of 14 to 9. Robins, of
the winning squad, displayed some
fancy dribbling in the second half.
Valentine and Eberhard starred for
Los Arcos, the latter being high
scorer with 5 points.
Encina 5 ran up a big lead in the
first half to defeat the Chi Psi's in
a close battle. Although Van King
tossed in 15 tallies for the fraternity
outfit, Chi Psi Lodge was unable to
overtake the flashy hall team. Bart
lett scored 10 points for the winners.
In a see-saw fumbling match, Sigma
Nu nosed out the Businessmen by a
single basket. The first half ended
in a 5-all tie. Fuhriman, at forward
for the Businessmen, sank two bas
kets from the center of the court.
A speedy Independent 2 team ran
away from El Cuadro in a ragged
contest. Lacking anything that re
sembled an offense, the eating club
boys were able to loop in but a single
field goal. How was high-point man
of the game with 7 markers to his
credit.
