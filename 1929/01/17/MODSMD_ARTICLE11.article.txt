# FACULTY-VARSITY BASEBALL GAME SET FOR TODAY
## 
### 
The faculty-varsity baseball game, j
' which was postponed last Tuesday be- !
j cause of rain, will be played this j
afternoon at 3 o'clock on the varsity |
' diamond. Coach Harry Wolter will !
! start the same lineup as was original
ly announced, and plans to use as |
i many of his men as possible during
i the contest.
Sypher, formerly scheduled to catch
for the faculty, will be unable to play
today, but Charles Davis has pro-
I cured a worthy substitute in the per
! son of Fisher. The latter used to play
j for the Portland Beavers, and is
i nated as a good hitter as well as a
! consistent backstop. Nevers will do
the chucking for the teachers, and he j
expects to let the varsity hitters |
down with very few hits. The remain- j
der of the faculty squad is rarin' to i
j go, so the game should be a battle i
from start to finish.
