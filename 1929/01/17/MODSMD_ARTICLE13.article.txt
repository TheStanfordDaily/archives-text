# Hoover Promises Thorough Inquiry Of Dry Situation
## Non-Partisan Committee To Conduct Investigation, Make Suggestions 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16. (/P) â€” A
j far-reaching investigation of all
' phases of prohibition is planned by
! President-elect Hoover early in his
| administration. His views were out
' lined today to prominent in
! the almost continuous wet and dry
controversies in the Senate who were
! told that he proposed to appoint a
non-partisan commission to conduct
an inquiry and make such recom
: mendations as it might deem advis
i oble.
The scope of the investigation would
! be almost unlimited, with the com
mission carefully studying the Vol
stead Act itself to determine whether
the difficulties in enforcement are in
! lierent in that law.
News of this intention of the
President-elect constituted the princi
pal development in the ninth day of
his conferences here with party
leaders, although many other sub
jects besides prohibition came under
discussion.
Naval affairs formed the topic of
a rather extended conversation Mr.
Hoover had with Chairman Britten
of the House Naval Committee. With
other callers he took up the political
situation in New York, the restric
tion of legislation at the special ses
sion of the New Congress to farm re
lief and tariff revision, cabinet and
( other appointments, the San Francisco
Bay bridge, Indian affairs, and some
details of farm problems.
i Cabinet and other major appoint
| ments were brought into the confer
| ences by several of the more than
a score of callers at headquarters dur
i ing the day, but there still was no in
! dictation from the President-elect as
to whether he had formed any final
conclusions on the personnel of his
] official family.
