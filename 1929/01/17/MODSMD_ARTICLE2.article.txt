# Dr. C. Alsberg Publishes "Wheat Studies," Book on Crop Forecasting System
## 
### 
Dr. Carl L. Alsberg, director of
Stanford's Food Research Institute,
has just published his first issue of
"Wheat Studies," which contains an
analysis of the forecasting problem of
interest and importance to all who
are concerned in securing accurate
and timely crop forecasts
In the words of the author, the pur
pose of the study "is to bring to
gether what is known concerning the
forecasting of yields of wheat from
the weather and to present as simple
and as lucid a picture as possible of
the status of existing knowledge of
this problem. This demands in the
first place consideration of weather
as an environmental factor, consider
ation of the biology of the wheat
plant as the basis of its reaction to
the weather, consideration of the
methods used in forecasting yields
from the weather, and finully a dis
cussion of how these methods have
been applied to wheat"
Incidental reference is made to
other crop plants when data on any
particular point are lacking for the
