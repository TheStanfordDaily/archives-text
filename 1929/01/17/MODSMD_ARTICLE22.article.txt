# It Rests With The Maintenance Company To Improve The Janitors' Conditions
## 
### 
That's the spirit! The janitors have commenced open agitation for
betterment of their squalid living conditions. In the adjacent columns
is a letter from an "old-timer and an ex-janitor" under Mr. John M.
Brown, foreman of the local mop crew, and in the letter are set forth
specifically the principal causes of complaint about the present quarters.
The communication is well worth reading through, for not only does it
describe in detail the conditions of the "shacks and shanties," but also it
illustrates that there is intelligence represented in the corps—a mental
quality which Mr. Brown insinuated his men did not possess, when he
referred to them as being "only janitors."
Comptroller Roth has declared that the responsibility of the American
Building Maintenance Company for maintenance of buildings actually
extends, indeed, to the very buildings wherein its employes are housed—
a conclusion unthinkable to Mr. Brown, who attempted to lay the blame
for the squalor of those shacks at the doorstep of the University.
Since the Maintenance Company is responsible, it should
effect an immediate improvement in conditions, if only as an
evidence of good faith in the face of all this discussion and
agitation, and even if nothing permanent can be done at the
time. After all, hath not a janitor eyes, feelings, and sensi
bilities?
