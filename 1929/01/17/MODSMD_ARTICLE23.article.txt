(A dclicate bit of irony from that urbane campus up the bay, which
is so eminently the beacon of enlightenment hereabouts. The subtle piccc
is a Daily Californian editorial.)
THE WOMEN AT STANFORD HAVE MANY
CONCESSIONS FOR WHICH TO BE THANKFUL
And now Stanford co-eds will be allowed to remain out nights
until the late hour of 11:30 o'clock merely by filing a written re
quest. This is a concession on the part of the authorities for which
women should be thankful.
They will be able to have such a good time in this day of ten
o'clock dances and eight o'clock shows. Of course, trips to San
Francisco and neighboring cities will be impossible. But, then
there are always the town "movies," an unlimited amount of fizzy
soda water to be consumed and long walks down country lanes, to
provide all the amusement necessary.
While it is unlikely that the editor of the Daily Californian will ever
have occasion to take out a Stanford woman, if he should, he would dis
cover that his "babe" could stay out until as early as 1:30 without
jeopardizing her standing with the authorities. But then, our editor
probably would have no more respect for Stanford authorities than he
has for Stanford women.
