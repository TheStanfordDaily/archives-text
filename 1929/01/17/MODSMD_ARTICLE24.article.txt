This is a day of broken hearts.
Roble Hall is full of them.
The last returns are in, and yester
day numerous young ladies wept
tears of joy as, entering - their future
Stanford homes amidst general oscu
lation, they were greeted as pledges
by the Sisterhoods.
But many another young lady, in
the darkness of her room at Roble,
wept tears of bitterness last night,
knowing at last that her dream of
many years was shattered, that she
would never wear the cherished Pin,
that tho Roble Bastille would be her
home throughout her Stanford days.
A few, a very few, stay in Roble
because they want to. Some Btay be
cause they would have only one Pin
and no other, and it was not offered
to them. Others stay—just because.
Next year some of them will not
come back. They will take their
bioken hearts somewhere else. The
rest will return, philosophical, apa
thetic or defiant.
This morning, between the room
mate who pledged and the roommate
who did not, the relationship is some
how different; and as weeks pass the
gulf will widen. The new sister-to-be
will be dropping up to the House for
lunch, and there will be the flurry of
affairs and, finally, initiation. Their
college worlds will be different.
Stanford is supposedly famous for
Its democracy. Among the men this
is true. But it is absolutely impos
sible for Stanford women to be demo

cratic, even though they may wish to
be, under the present Roble —or —Row
situation.
There is a definite boundary line
between the sororities and Roble,
whereas there is no such demarca
tion between the fraternities and the
halls. A Stanford man is judged by
his fellows for himself alone, regard
less of where he chooses to live. A
great percentage of men living in the
halls or in Palo Alto are there in
preference to the Row. There are
some, of course, who were disap
pointed at rushing time; but the man
who did not join a fraternity, al
though wishing to do so, can ex
plain it by saying, "I didn't want to
go Row."
The disappointed woman can't uso
this alibi. As someone has said, "It's
easier to pledge a sorority than to
spend all your time explaining why
you didn't." And even when she does
explain, though she may have sincere
convictions against going Row ,are
her reasons believed?
In one way, sororities are a bene
fit: they provide small living groups
which allow half of the women at
Stanford to escape the repressive
boredom of four years in Roble. I3ut
there will be no decent democracy
among Stanford women until there
are small living units for the entire
Five Hundred —and with the Greek
letters rubbed off the doorsteps.
In other words, sororities at Stan
ford should be abolished.
