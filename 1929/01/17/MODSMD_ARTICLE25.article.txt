## AN EX-JANITOR REPLIES TO MR. BROWN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As an old-timer and an ex-janitor
who knows the ropes of the janitorial
service, and one who has the inter
ests of the janitors at heart, and who
has recently observed the several
news items and the editorials in your
Daily regarding the janitors' unsightly
and unsanitary premises, properly
named by Mr. Erwin "Shacks and
Shanties," and especially your edi
torial yesterday, viz.: "Brown Sees
No Slums," and as such I wish to ex
press my indignation at the stand
and explanation of Mr. John Brown,
the foreman who directs the work of
the janitors on the University
grounds, and who also represents the
American Building Maintenance Com
pany with head office in San Fran
cisco, and as such I wish to reply as
follows:
Mr. Brown says "that he would like
to see improvements made." Well, let
me ask Mr. Brown why it is that he,
as foreman and representative for his
company, has not had the milk of
human kindness in his heart and
looked after the interests and com
forts of his forty men, previous to
this wet, cold, and dreary winter, and
long before his attention was called
to the sad conditions of the janitors'
shacks and shanties by the Stanford
Daily.
I am indeed glad, Mr. Editor, that
you have made several suggestions
for Mr. Brown to follow, and I trust,
carry out, and thus help to bring
comfort and cheer to the janitors who
are laboring for Mr. Brown, without
whose help he would not be able to
hold his big, fat position.
You have rightly suggested that
Mr. Brown provide heat for the jani
tors' quarters in order to obviate the
necessity of the janitors building an
open fire each morning in the yard
in order to keep warm.
I think you have also struck the
keynote when you suggest that Mr.
Brown provide a suitable number of
shower baths for the janitors because
these are sadly lacking, and the con
dition of the present system is such
that the janitors are compelled to go
to the different students' quarters in
order to take their baths.
I have good information that some
thing formerly called mattresses used
by the janitors for their bedding are
in such a worn-out condition that they
should have been condemned long
ago, discarded and others used in
their place. While this condition
exists, Mr. Brown makes no attempt
at making any replacement, even
though the janitors pay for service
and comfort.
I trust the agitation just started in
your paper, seeking for the better
ment of the janitors' quarters will
continue until either the University
or the American Building Mainten
ance Company will be compelled to
take action, and make the necessary
repairs and improvements for the wel
fare and health of the janitors, even
though Mr. Brown says "that the
money for making such improvements
would have to come from somewhere."
Mr. Brown says: "I think these
quarters we got aren't so bad," and
yet he again says "the only thing I
see that could be done would be to
grow a hedge to keep these quarters
out of sight." I would like Mr. Brown
to answer me why it is that if these
quarters, shacks or shanties, the only
home the janitors have, are not so
bad, a hedge should be grown about
them in order to shut them from
public gaze.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Brown, if
your company has had the contract to
render janitorial service to Stanford
University for the past eight years,
why is it that you have not taken
action ere this to properly house and
care for your janitors as they should
have been housed and cared for?
Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, why
it is that your company contracts
with the Stanford University to sup
ply janitorial service at the rate of
50 cents'per hour per man, to $4.00
per day for 8 hours' service, and yet
your company pays the janitors only
25 cents per hour, plus board and
room. Thus the janitors received $2.00
per day with board and room for the
past 8 years, and all this time the
premises have been deteriorating and
going from bad to worse, and yet you
have made no attempt to better con
ditions for your janitors until the
Stanford Daily called your attention
to the conditions existing today. Let
me remind you that the janitors'
Bhacks and shanties are given free
by the University and yet the enor
mous rate you charge the men for
room and board is outrageous and
should be reduced. This high rate
really needs an explanation.
Mr. Brown says "that the janitors
are only janitors." What does ho
mean? I am at a loss to understand
what he means by such a statement
unless he thinks that the janitors are
interior beings and are not welcome
in good society.
Mr. Brown also says "that condi
tions are about as good as are to be
found anywhere." I am sorry that Mr.
Brown has such a distorted vision; I

think he must have a very severe
case of astigmatism and perhaps he
is correct from his own viewpoint,
taking things into consideration from
his past experience apart from Bome
janitors who were privileged to ren
der service in Stanford University,
and have moved on and upward into
other fields of usefulness. Perhaps
Mr. Brown's olfactory organs are out
of repair, and if such be the case, I
would suggest that he immediately
see a surgeon and this without delay.
Mr. Brown says "that most of his
men have been with him for years,
and that he gets a new one now and
then who doesn't stay long." Let me
ask Mr. Brown what he means by
making such a statement, "most of
his men." Out of the 40 janitors now
in his employ I understand I can
count on both hands every man who
has been employed on the University
buildings for over one year. Mr.
Brown is correct when he says, "He
gets a new man now and then who
doesn't stay long." This is largely
due to the fact that the newcomers
are accustomed to much better condi
tions and accommodations elsewhere.
Mr. Brown says "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man, they're
good healthy men, the men he gets."
Mr. Brown is quite right; I know he
is when he states "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man" be
cause instead of waiting for the ar
rival of the new man, he should have
a fumigated blanket ready to give him
upon his arrival, which system at this
place I don't think is in operation.
Mr. Brown says "the kind of men he
gets are good healthy men." Let me
ask Mr. Brown how he knows this to
be true. Does his company in San
Francisco who send the janitors to
Stanford from the employment office
or elsewhere in San Francisco em
ploy a physician to examine each
man, and provide him with a medical
certificate to present to Mr. Brown
upon his arrival? No, it does not;
then why does Mr. Brown take it for
granted, and give unhealthy men the
bedding, blankets, and comforts to be
used later by healthy men, without
any attempt made at fumigation?
Due to the lack of fumigating, the
blankets, comforts, and bedding in
general permit me to state that I
stand ready at any time to present
to Mr. Roth and Mr. Erwin the sum
of $50.00 in cash, which amount is to
be given to Mr. John M. Brown upon
the presentation of receipts to
Messrs. Roth and Erwin, giving dates
and places, showing where and when
and how many times the blankets,
comforts, and bedding now being
used by the janitors have been fumi
gated during the past four years, this
period being the term of service Mr.
Brown has been here as representa
tive for his company on the campus.
This offer of cash is made on condi
tion that Mr. John M. Brown also
place a cash deposit with Messrs.
Roth and Erwin to be given to the
undersigned, provided he cannot show
the required receipts giving the neces
sary information pertaining to the
fumigation process.
Mr. Brown informed the reporter
"that he stood shivering upon emerg
ing from a janitor's room." Then let
me ask Mr. Brown if he would like
to be the lonely occupant of such a
tireless shanty or shack which is
worse, I feel certain, than the heated
cell in San Quentin prison for a
felon.
Mr. Brown states "that most of his
men have provided themselves with
electric heaters." Well, I don't know
that Mr. Brown is correct when he
says "most of the men," it is true
that some of them, who have person
ally paid for them and not Mr. Brown
nor his company.
Let me ask Mr. Brown if he has
made any provision for light at nights
to retire by, and to rise in the morn
ing when it is dark and the electric
light system so deficient has refused
to give light ? No, he has not, not
withstanding the fact that on several
occasions when the electric light went
out I understand requests were made
for candles but none were available,
and yet Mr. Brown charges the jani
tors for suitable, efficient service and
accommodations. How long, Mr.
Brown, is this condition of affairs
going to exist? Surely there is a djiy
of reckoning coming and let us hope
it will come soon. Why don't you,
Mr. Brown, knowing as you do, that
the lighting system in your janitors'
shacks and shanties is poor, provide
a candle and matches for your jani
tors in case of emergency?
"The glorious one shower bath,"
Mr. Brown has stated, "can be sup
plemented by an additional one, and
a bathroom, the janitors may use."
Permit me to state that until your
valuable paper had taken an interest
in the janitors' quarter, this addi
tional bathroom I learn has been
under lock and key and in a remote
part of the building, far away and
apart from the main lavatory, in a
private room where janitors were not
supposed to go.

I wish if Mr. Brown would please
inform the janitors through your valu
able paper why it is that the 40 jani
tors have to leave their warm beds '
and pile into the dining room each
morning and sit down to breakfast,
shivering with the cold, and no pro- !
vision made for their comfort by in- \
stalling some sort of a heating appa- ;
ratus by which the dining room could
be made warm or at least take the
chill out of the room? I wonder if i
Mr. Brown thinks the janitors should i
purchase a heating apparatus for the '
dining room, when their salary is the j
big sum of $2 per day.
Permit me, Mr. Editor, before clos- j
ing this letter, to offer a suggestion, |
and that is, that an order be issued
by the Stanford medical authorities
to Mr. Brown to collect all the blan
kets, comforts, and bedding now be- !
ing used by the janitors, and taken
immediately to a proper fumigating
plant, and there treated as they
should be by a fumigating process.
In addition to the previous sugges
tion, I would also suggest that the
Stanford University Medical Board
take Mr. John M. Brown's janitorial

shacks and shanties under its obser
vation and give the place a regular
monthly inspection, until such time
as a more suitable residence be pro- !
vided for each janitor.
Sincerely yours, James Tronan.

place a cash deposit with Messrs.
Roth and Erwin to be given to the
undersigned, provided he cannot show
the required receipts giving the neces
sary information pertaining to the
fumigation process.
Mr. Brown informed the reporter
"that he stood shivering upon emerg
ing from a janitor's room." Then let
me ask Mr. Brown if he would like
to be the lonely occupant of such a
tireless shanty or shack which is
worse, I feel certain, than the heated
cell in San Quentin prison for a
felon.
Mr. Brown states "that most of his
men have provided themselves with
electric heaters." Well, I don't know
that Mr. Brown is correct when he
says "most of the men," it is true
that some of them, who have person
ally paid for them and not Mr. Brown
nor his company.
Let me ask Mr. Brown if he has
made any provision for light at nights
to retire by, and to rise in the morn
ing when it is dark and the electric
light system so deficient has refused
to give light ? No, he has not, not
withstanding the fact that on several
occasions when the electric light went
out I understand requests were made
for candles but none were available,
and yet Mr. Brown charges the jani
tors for suitable, efficient service and
accommodations. How long, Mr.
Brown, is this condition of affairs
going to exist? Surely there is a djiy
of reckoning coming and let us hope
it will come soon. Why don't you,
Mr. Brown, knowing as you do, that
the lighting system in your janitors'
shacks and shanties is poor, provide
a candle and matches for your jani
tors in case of emergency?
"The glorious one shower bath,"
Mr. Brown has stated, "can be sup
plemented by an additional one, and
a bathroom, the janitors may use."
Permit me to state that until your
valuable paper had taken an interest
in the janitors' quarter, this addi
tional bathroom I learn has been
under lock and key and in a remote
part of the building, far away and
apart from the main lavatory, in a
private room where janitors were not
supposed to go.

I wish if Mr. Brown would please
inform the janitors through your valu
able paper why it is that the 40 jani
tors have to leave their warm beds '
and pile into the dining room each
morning and sit down to breakfast,
shivering with the cold, and no pro- !
vision made for their comfort by in- \
stalling some sort of a heating appa- ;
ratus by which the dining room could
be made warm or at least take the
chill out of the room? I wonder if i
Mr. Brown thinks the janitors should i
purchase a heating apparatus for the '
dining room, when their salary is the j
big sum of $2 per day.
Permit me, Mr. Editor, before clos- j
ing this letter, to offer a suggestion, |
and that is, that an order be issued
by the Stanford medical authorities
to Mr. Brown to collect all the blan
kets, comforts, and bedding now be- !
ing used by the janitors, and taken
immediately to a proper fumigating
plant, and there treated as they
should be by a fumigating process.
In addition to the previous sugges
tion, I would also suggest that the
Stanford University Medical Board
take Mr. John M. Brown's janitorial

shacks and shanties under its obser
vation and give the place a regular
monthly inspection, until such time
as a more suitable residence be pro- !
vided for each janitor.
Sincerely yours, James Tronan.

The Editor, Sir:
As an old-timer and an ex-janitor
who knows the ropes of the janitorial
service, and one who has the inter
ests of the janitors at heart, and who
has recently observed the several
news items and the editorials in your
Daily regarding the janitors' unsightly
and unsanitary premises, properly
named by Mr. Erwin "Shacks and
Shanties," and especially your edi
torial yesterday, viz.: "Brown Sees
No Slums," and as such I wish to ex
press my indignation at the stand
and explanation of Mr. John Brown,
the foreman who directs the work of
the janitors on the University
grounds, and who also represents the
American Building Maintenance Com
pany with head office in San Fran
cisco, and as such I wish to reply as
follows:
Mr. Brown says "that he would like
to see improvements made." Well, let
me ask Mr. Brown why it is that he,
as foreman and representative for his
company, has not had the milk of
human kindness in his heart and
looked after the interests and com
forts of his forty men, previous to
this wet, cold, and dreary winter, and
long before his attention was called
to the sad conditions of the janitors'
shacks and shanties by the Stanford
Daily.
I am indeed glad, Mr. Editor, that
you have made several suggestions
for Mr. Brown to follow, and I trust,
carry out, and thus help to bring
comfort and cheer to the janitors who
are laboring for Mr. Brown, without
whose help he would not be able to
hold his big, fat position.
You have rightly suggested that
Mr. Brown provide heat for the jani
tors' quarters in order to obviate the
necessity of the janitors building an
open fire each morning in the yard
in order to keep warm.
I think you have also struck the
keynote when you suggest that Mr.
Brown provide a suitable number of
shower baths for the janitors because
these are sadly lacking, and the con
dition of the present system is such
that the janitors are compelled to go
to the different students' quarters in
order to take their baths.
I have good information that some
thing formerly called mattresses used
by the janitors for their bedding are
in such a worn-out condition that they
should have been condemned long
ago, discarded and others used in
their place. While this condition
exists, Mr. Brown makes no attempt
at making any replacement, even
though the janitors pay for service
and comfort.
I trust the agitation just started in
your paper, seeking for the better
ment of the janitors' quarters will
continue until either the University
or the American Building Mainten
ance Company will be compelled to
take action, and make the necessary
repairs and improvements for the wel
fare and health of the janitors, even
though Mr. Brown says "that the
money for making such improvements
would have to come from somewhere."
Mr. Brown says: "I think these
quarters we got aren't so bad," and
yet he again says "the only thing I
see that could be done would be to
grow a hedge to keep these quarters
out of sight." I would like Mr. Brown
to answer me why it is that if these
quarters, shacks or shanties, the only
home the janitors have, are not so
bad, a hedge should be grown about
them in order to shut them from
public gaze.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Brown, if
your company has had the contract to
render janitorial service to Stanford
University for the past eight years,
why is it that you have not taken
action ere this to properly house and
care for your janitors as they should
have been housed and cared for?
Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, why
it is that your company contracts
with the Stanford University to sup
ply janitorial service at the rate of
50 cents'per hour per man, to $4.00
per day for 8 hours' service, and yet
your company pays the janitors only
25 cents per hour, plus board and
room. Thus the janitors received $2.00
per day with board and room for the
past 8 years, and all this time the
premises have been deteriorating and
going from bad to worse, and yet you
have made no attempt to better con
ditions for your janitors until the
Stanford Daily called your attention
to the conditions existing today. Let
me remind you that the janitors'
Bhacks and shanties are given free
by the University and yet the enor
mous rate you charge the men for
room and board is outrageous and
should be reduced. This high rate
really needs an explanation.
Mr. Brown says "that the janitors
are only janitors." What does ho
mean? I am at a loss to understand
what he means by such a statement
unless he thinks that the janitors are
interior beings and are not welcome
in good society.
Mr. Brown also says "that condi
tions are about as good as are to be
found anywhere." I am sorry that Mr.
Brown has such a distorted vision; I

think he must have a very severe
case of astigmatism and perhaps he
is correct from his own viewpoint,
taking things into consideration from
his past experience apart from Bome
janitors who were privileged to ren
der service in Stanford University,
and have moved on and upward into
other fields of usefulness. Perhaps
Mr. Brown's olfactory organs are out
of repair, and if such be the case, I
would suggest that he immediately
see a surgeon and this without delay.
Mr. Brown says "that most of his
men have been with him for years,
and that he gets a new one now and
then who doesn't stay long." Let me
ask Mr. Brown what he means by
making such a statement, "most of
his men." Out of the 40 janitors now
in his employ I understand I can
count on both hands every man who
has been employed on the University
buildings for over one year. Mr.
Brown is correct when he says, "He
gets a new man now and then who
doesn't stay long." This is largely
due to the fact that the newcomers
are accustomed to much better condi
tions and accommodations elsewhere.
Mr. Brown says "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man, they're
good healthy men, the men he gets."
Mr. Brown is quite right; I know he
is when he states "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man" be
cause instead of waiting for the ar
rival of the new man, he should have
a fumigated blanket ready to give him
upon his arrival, which system at this
place I don't think is in operation.
Mr. Brown says "the kind of men he
gets are good healthy men." Let me
ask Mr. Brown how he knows this to
be true. Does his company in San
Francisco who send the janitors to
Stanford from the employment office
or elsewhere in San Francisco em
ploy a physician to examine each
man, and provide him with a medical
certificate to present to Mr. Brown
upon his arrival? No, it does not;
then why does Mr. Brown take it for
granted, and give unhealthy men the
bedding, blankets, and comforts to be
used later by healthy men, without
any attempt made at fumigation?
Due to the lack of fumigating, the
blankets, comforts, and bedding in
general permit me to state that I
stand ready at any time to present
to Mr. Roth and Mr. Erwin the sum
of $50.00 in cash, which amount is to
be given to Mr. John M. Brown upon
the presentation of receipts to
Messrs. Roth and Erwin, giving dates
and places, showing where and when
and how many times the blankets,
comforts, and bedding now being
used by the janitors have been fumi
gated during the past four years, this
period being the term of service Mr.
Brown has been here as representa
tive for his company on the campus.
This offer of cash is made on condi
tion that Mr. John M. Brown also
place a cash deposit with Messrs.
Roth and Erwin to be given to the
undersigned, provided he cannot show
the required receipts giving the neces
sary information pertaining to the
fumigation process.

have made no attempt to better con
ditions for your janitors until the
Stanford Daily called your attention
to the conditions existing today. Let
me remind you that the janitors'
Bhacks and shanties are given free
by the University and yet the enor
mous rate you charge the men for
room and board is outrageous and
should be reduced. This high rate
really needs an explanation.
Mr. Brown says "that the janitors
are only janitors." What does ho
mean? I am at a loss to understand
what he means by such a statement
unless he thinks that the janitors are
interior beings and are not welcome
in good society.
Mr. Brown also says "that condi
tions are about as good as are to be
found anywhere." I am sorry that Mr.
Brown has such a distorted vision; I

think he must have a very severe
case of astigmatism and perhaps he
is correct from his own viewpoint,
taking things into consideration from
his past experience apart from Bome
janitors who were privileged to ren
der service in Stanford University,
and have moved on and upward into
other fields of usefulness. Perhaps
Mr. Brown's olfactory organs are out
of repair, and if such be the case, I
would suggest that he immediately
see a surgeon and this without delay.
Mr. Brown says "that most of his
men have been with him for years,
and that he gets a new one now and
then who doesn't stay long." Let me
ask Mr. Brown what he means by
making such a statement, "most of
his men." Out of the 40 janitors now
in his employ I understand I can
count on both hands every man who
has been employed on the University
buildings for over one year. Mr.
Brown is correct when he says, "He
gets a new man now and then who
doesn't stay long." This is largely
due to the fact that the newcomers
are accustomed to much better condi
tions and accommodations elsewhere.
Mr. Brown says "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man, they're
good healthy men, the men he gets."
Mr. Brown is quite right; I know he
is when he states "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man" be
cause instead of waiting for the ar
rival of the new man, he should have
a fumigated blanket ready to give him
upon his arrival, which system at this
place I don't think is in operation.
Mr. Brown says "the kind of men he
gets are good healthy men." Let me
ask Mr. Brown how he knows this to
be true. Does his company in San
Francisco who send the janitors to
Stanford from the employment office
or elsewhere in San Francisco em
ploy a physician to examine each
man, and provide him with a medical
certificate to present to Mr. Brown
upon his arrival? No, it does not;
then why does Mr. Brown take it for
granted, and give unhealthy men the
bedding, blankets, and comforts to be
used later by healthy men, without
any attempt made at fumigation?
Due to the lack of fumigating, the
blankets, comforts, and bedding in
general permit me to state that I
stand ready at any time to present
to Mr. Roth and Mr. Erwin the sum
of $50.00 in cash, which amount is to
be given to Mr. John M. Brown upon
the presentation of receipts to
Messrs. Roth and Erwin, giving dates
and places, showing where and when
and how many times the blankets,
comforts, and bedding now being
used by the janitors have been fumi
gated during the past four years, this
period being the term of service Mr.
Brown has been here as representa
tive for his company on the campus.
This offer of cash is made on condi
tion that Mr. John M. Brown also
place a cash deposit with Messrs.
Roth and Erwin to be given to the
undersigned, provided he cannot show
the required receipts giving the neces
sary information pertaining to the
fumigation process.
Mr. Brown informed the reporter
"that he stood shivering upon emerg
ing from a janitor's room." Then let
me ask Mr. Brown if he would like
to be the lonely occupant of such a
tireless shanty or shack which is
worse, I feel certain, than the heated
cell in San Quentin prison for a
felon.
Mr. Brown states "that most of his
men have provided themselves with
electric heaters." Well, I don't know
that Mr. Brown is correct when he
says "most of the men," it is true
that some of them, who have person
ally paid for them and not Mr. Brown
nor his company.
Let me ask Mr. Brown if he has
made any provision for light at nights
to retire by, and to rise in the morn
ing when it is dark and the electric
light system so deficient has refused
to give light ? No, he has not, not
withstanding the fact that on several
occasions when the electric light went
out I understand requests were made
for candles but none were available,
and yet Mr. Brown charges the jani
tors for suitable, efficient service and
accommodations. How long, Mr.
Brown, is this condition of affairs
going to exist? Surely there is a djiy
of reckoning coming and let us hope
it will come soon. Why don't you,
Mr. Brown, knowing as you do, that
the lighting system in your janitors'
shacks and shanties is poor, provide
a candle and matches for your jani
tors in case of emergency?
"The glorious one shower bath,"
Mr. Brown has stated, "can be sup
plemented by an additional one, and
a bathroom, the janitors may use."
Permit me to state that until your
valuable paper had taken an interest
in the janitors' quarter, this addi
tional bathroom I learn has been
under lock and key and in a remote
part of the building, far away and
apart from the main lavatory, in a
private room where janitors were not
supposed to go.

I wish if Mr. Brown would please
inform the janitors through your valu
able paper why it is that the 40 jani
tors have to leave their warm beds '
and pile into the dining room each
morning and sit down to breakfast,
shivering with the cold, and no pro- !
vision made for their comfort by in- \
stalling some sort of a heating appa- ;
ratus by which the dining room could
be made warm or at least take the
chill out of the room? I wonder if i
Mr. Brown thinks the janitors should i
purchase a heating apparatus for the '
dining room, when their salary is the j
big sum of $2 per day.
Permit me, Mr. Editor, before clos- j
ing this letter, to offer a suggestion, |
and that is, that an order be issued
by the Stanford medical authorities
to Mr. Brown to collect all the blan
kets, comforts, and bedding now be- !
ing used by the janitors, and taken
immediately to a proper fumigating
plant, and there treated as they
should be by a fumigating process.
In addition to the previous sugges
tion, I would also suggest that the
Stanford University Medical Board
take Mr. John M. Brown's janitorial

shacks and shanties under its obser
vation and give the place a regular
monthly inspection, until such time
as a more suitable residence be pro- !
vided for each janitor.
Sincerely yours, James Tronan.

The Editor, Sir:
As an old-timer and an ex-janitor
who knows the ropes of the janitorial
service, and one who has the inter
ests of the janitors at heart, and who
has recently observed the several
news items and the editorials in your
Daily regarding the janitors' unsightly
and unsanitary premises, properly
named by Mr. Erwin "Shacks and
Shanties," and especially your edi
torial yesterday, viz.: "Brown Sees
No Slums," and as such I wish to ex
press my indignation at the stand
and explanation of Mr. John Brown,
the foreman who directs the work of
the janitors on the University
grounds, and who also represents the
American Building Maintenance Com
pany with head office in San Fran
cisco, and as such I wish to reply as
follows:
Mr. Brown says "that he would like
to see improvements made." Well, let
me ask Mr. Brown why it is that he,
as foreman and representative for his
company, has not had the milk of
human kindness in his heart and
looked after the interests and com
forts of his forty men, previous to
this wet, cold, and dreary winter, and
long before his attention was called
to the sad conditions of the janitors'
shacks and shanties by the Stanford
Daily.
I am indeed glad, Mr. Editor, that
you have made several suggestions
for Mr. Brown to follow, and I trust,
carry out, and thus help to bring
comfort and cheer to the janitors who
are laboring for Mr. Brown, without
whose help he would not be able to
hold his big, fat position.
You have rightly suggested that
Mr. Brown provide heat for the jani
tors' quarters in order to obviate the
necessity of the janitors building an
open fire each morning in the yard
in order to keep warm.
I think you have also struck the
keynote when you suggest that Mr.
Brown provide a suitable number of
shower baths for the janitors because
these are sadly lacking, and the con
dition of the present system is such
that the janitors are compelled to go
to the different students' quarters in
order to take their baths.
I have good information that some
thing formerly called mattresses used
by the janitors for their bedding are
in such a worn-out condition that they
should have been condemned long
ago, discarded and others used in
their place. While this condition
exists, Mr. Brown makes no attempt
at making any replacement, even
though the janitors pay for service
and comfort.
I trust the agitation just started in
your paper, seeking for the better
ment of the janitors' quarters will
continue until either the University
or the American Building Mainten
ance Company will be compelled to
take action, and make the necessary
repairs and improvements for the wel
fare and health of the janitors, even
though Mr. Brown says "that the
money for making such improvements
would have to come from somewhere."
Mr. Brown says: "I think these
quarters we got aren't so bad," and
yet he again says "the only thing I
see that could be done would be to
grow a hedge to keep these quarters
out of sight." I would like Mr. Brown
to answer me why it is that if these
quarters, shacks or shanties, the only
home the janitors have, are not so
bad, a hedge should be grown about
them in order to shut them from
public gaze.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Brown, if
your company has had the contract to
render janitorial service to Stanford
University for the past eight years,
why is it that you have not taken
action ere this to properly house and
care for your janitors as they should
have been housed and cared for?
Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, why
it is that your company contracts
with the Stanford University to sup
ply janitorial service at the rate of
50 cents'per hour per man, to $4.00
per day for 8 hours' service, and yet
your company pays the janitors only
25 cents per hour, plus board and
room. Thus the janitors received $2.00
per day with board and room for the
past 8 years, and all this time the
premises have been deteriorating and
going from bad to worse, and yet you
have made no attempt to better con
ditions for your janitors until the
Stanford Daily called your attention
to the conditions existing today. Let
me remind you that the janitors'
Bhacks and shanties are given free
by the University and yet the enor
mous rate you charge the men for
room and board is outrageous and
should be reduced. This high rate
really needs an explanation.

torial yesterday, viz.: "Brown Sees
No Slums," and as such I wish to ex
press my indignation at the stand
and explanation of Mr. John Brown,
the foreman who directs the work of
the janitors on the University
grounds, and who also represents the
American Building Maintenance Com
pany with head office in San Fran
cisco, and as such I wish to reply as
follows:
Mr. Brown says "that he would like
to see improvements made." Well, let
me ask Mr. Brown why it is that he,
as foreman and representative for his
company, has not had the milk of
human kindness in his heart and
looked after the interests and com
forts of his forty men, previous to
this wet, cold, and dreary winter, and
long before his attention was called
to the sad conditions of the janitors'
shacks and shanties by the Stanford
Daily.
I am indeed glad, Mr. Editor, that
you have made several suggestions
for Mr. Brown to follow, and I trust,
carry out, and thus help to bring
comfort and cheer to the janitors who
are laboring for Mr. Brown, without
whose help he would not be able to
hold his big, fat position.
You have rightly suggested that
Mr. Brown provide heat for the jani
tors' quarters in order to obviate the
necessity of the janitors building an
open fire each morning in the yard
in order to keep warm.
I think you have also struck the
keynote when you suggest that Mr.
Brown provide a suitable number of
shower baths for the janitors because
these are sadly lacking, and the con
dition of the present system is such
that the janitors are compelled to go
to the different students' quarters in
order to take their baths.
I have good information that some
thing formerly called mattresses used
by the janitors for their bedding are
in such a worn-out condition that they
should have been condemned long
ago, discarded and others used in
their place. While this condition
exists, Mr. Brown makes no attempt
at making any replacement, even
though the janitors pay for service
and comfort.
I trust the agitation just started in
your paper, seeking for the better
ment of the janitors' quarters will
continue until either the University
or the American Building Mainten
ance Company will be compelled to
take action, and make the necessary
repairs and improvements for the wel
fare and health of the janitors, even
though Mr. Brown says "that the
money for making such improvements
would have to come from somewhere."
Mr. Brown says: "I think these
quarters we got aren't so bad," and
yet he again says "the only thing I
see that could be done would be to
grow a hedge to keep these quarters
out of sight." I would like Mr. Brown
to answer me why it is that if these
quarters, shacks or shanties, the only
home the janitors have, are not so
bad, a hedge should be grown about
them in order to shut them from
public gaze.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Brown, if
your company has had the contract to
render janitorial service to Stanford
University for the past eight years,
why is it that you have not taken
action ere this to properly house and
care for your janitors as they should
have been housed and cared for?
Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, why
it is that your company contracts
with the Stanford University to sup
ply janitorial service at the rate of
50 cents'per hour per man, to $4.00
per day for 8 hours' service, and yet
your company pays the janitors only
25 cents per hour, plus board and
room. Thus the janitors received $2.00
per day with board and room for the
past 8 years, and all this time the
premises have been deteriorating and
going from bad to worse, and yet you
have made no attempt to better con
ditions for your janitors until the
Stanford Daily called your attention
to the conditions existing today. Let
me remind you that the janitors'
Bhacks and shanties are given free
by the University and yet the enor
mous rate you charge the men for
room and board is outrageous and
should be reduced. This high rate
really needs an explanation.
Mr. Brown says "that the janitors
are only janitors." What does ho
mean? I am at a loss to understand
what he means by such a statement
unless he thinks that the janitors are
interior beings and are not welcome
in good society.
Mr. Brown also says "that condi
tions are about as good as are to be
found anywhere." I am sorry that Mr.
Brown has such a distorted vision; I

think he must have a very severe
case of astigmatism and perhaps he
is correct from his own viewpoint,
taking things into consideration from
his past experience apart from Bome
janitors who were privileged to ren
der service in Stanford University,
and have moved on and upward into
other fields of usefulness. Perhaps
Mr. Brown's olfactory organs are out
of repair, and if such be the case, I
would suggest that he immediately
see a surgeon and this without delay.
Mr. Brown says "that most of his
men have been with him for years,
and that he gets a new one now and
then who doesn't stay long." Let me
ask Mr. Brown what he means by
making such a statement, "most of
his men." Out of the 40 janitors now
in his employ I understand I can
count on both hands every man who
has been employed on the University
buildings for over one year. Mr.
Brown is correct when he says, "He
gets a new man now and then who
doesn't stay long." This is largely
due to the fact that the newcomers
are accustomed to much better condi
tions and accommodations elsewhere.
Mr. Brown says "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man, they're
good healthy men, the men he gets."
Mr. Brown is quite right; I know he
is when he states "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man" be
cause instead of waiting for the ar
rival of the new man, he should have
a fumigated blanket ready to give him
upon his arrival, which system at this
place I don't think is in operation.
Mr. Brown says "the kind of men he
gets are good healthy men." Let me
ask Mr. Brown how he knows this to
be true. Does his company in San
Francisco who send the janitors to
Stanford from the employment office
or elsewhere in San Francisco em
ploy a physician to examine each
man, and provide him with a medical
certificate to present to Mr. Brown
upon his arrival? No, it does not;
then why does Mr. Brown take it for
granted, and give unhealthy men the
bedding, blankets, and comforts to be
used later by healthy men, without
any attempt made at fumigation?
Due to the lack of fumigating, the
blankets, comforts, and bedding in
general permit me to state that I
stand ready at any time to present
to Mr. Roth and Mr. Erwin the sum
of $50.00 in cash, which amount is to
be given to Mr. John M. Brown upon
the presentation of receipts to
Messrs. Roth and Erwin, giving dates
and places, showing where and when
and how many times the blankets,
comforts, and bedding now being
used by the janitors have been fumi
gated during the past four years, this
period being the term of service Mr.
Brown has been here as representa
tive for his company on the campus.
This offer of cash is made on condi
tion that Mr. John M. Brown also
place a cash deposit with Messrs.
Roth and Erwin to be given to the
undersigned, provided he cannot show
the required receipts giving the neces
sary information pertaining to the
fumigation process.
Mr. Brown informed the reporter
"that he stood shivering upon emerg
ing from a janitor's room." Then let
me ask Mr. Brown if he would like
to be the lonely occupant of such a
tireless shanty or shack which is
worse, I feel certain, than the heated
cell in San Quentin prison for a
felon.
Mr. Brown states "that most of his
men have provided themselves with
electric heaters." Well, I don't know
that Mr. Brown is correct when he
says "most of the men," it is true
that some of them, who have person
ally paid for them and not Mr. Brown
nor his company.
Let me ask Mr. Brown if he has
made any provision for light at nights
to retire by, and to rise in the morn
ing when it is dark and the electric
light system so deficient has refused
to give light ? No, he has not, not
withstanding the fact that on several
occasions when the electric light went
out I understand requests were made
for candles but none were available,
and yet Mr. Brown charges the jani
tors for suitable, efficient service and
accommodations. How long, Mr.
Brown, is this condition of affairs
going to exist? Surely there is a djiy
of reckoning coming and let us hope
it will come soon. Why don't you,
Mr. Brown, knowing as you do, that
the lighting system in your janitors'
shacks and shanties is poor, provide
a candle and matches for your jani
tors in case of emergency?
"The glorious one shower bath,"
Mr. Brown has stated, "can be sup
plemented by an additional one, and
a bathroom, the janitors may use."
Permit me to state that until your
valuable paper had taken an interest
in the janitors' quarter, this addi
tional bathroom I learn has been
under lock and key and in a remote
part of the building, far away and
apart from the main lavatory, in a
private room where janitors were not
supposed to go.

I wish if Mr. Brown would please
inform the janitors through your valu
able paper why it is that the 40 jani
tors have to leave their warm beds '
and pile into the dining room each
morning and sit down to breakfast,
shivering with the cold, and no pro- !
vision made for their comfort by in- \
stalling some sort of a heating appa- ;
ratus by which the dining room could
be made warm or at least take the
chill out of the room? I wonder if i
Mr. Brown thinks the janitors should i
purchase a heating apparatus for the '
dining room, when their salary is the j
big sum of $2 per day.
Permit me, Mr. Editor, before clos- j
ing this letter, to offer a suggestion, |
and that is, that an order be issued
by the Stanford medical authorities
to Mr. Brown to collect all the blan
kets, comforts, and bedding now be- !
ing used by the janitors, and taken
immediately to a proper fumigating
plant, and there treated as they
should be by a fumigating process.
In addition to the previous sugges
tion, I would also suggest that the
Stanford University Medical Board
take Mr. John M. Brown's janitorial

shacks and shanties under its obser
vation and give the place a regular
monthly inspection, until such time
as a more suitable residence be pro- !
vided for each janitor.
Sincerely yours, James Tronan.

worse, I feel certain, than the heated
cell in San Quentin prison for a
felon.
Mr. Brown states "that most of his
men have provided themselves with
electric heaters." Well, I don't know
that Mr. Brown is correct when he
says "most of the men," it is true
that some of them, who have person
ally paid for them and not Mr. Brown
nor his company.
Let me ask Mr. Brown if he has
made any provision for light at nights
to retire by, and to rise in the morn
ing when it is dark and the electric
light system so deficient has refused
to give light ? No, he has not, not
withstanding the fact that on several
occasions when the electric light went
out I understand requests were made
for candles but none were available,
and yet Mr. Brown charges the jani
tors for suitable, efficient service and
accommodations. How long, Mr.
Brown, is this condition of affairs
going to exist? Surely there is a djiy
of reckoning coming and let us hope
it will come soon. Why don't you,
Mr. Brown, knowing as you do, that
the lighting system in your janitors'
shacks and shanties is poor, provide
a candle and matches for your jani
tors in case of emergency?
"The glorious one shower bath,"
Mr. Brown has stated, "can be sup
plemented by an additional one, and
a bathroom, the janitors may use."
Permit me to state that until your
valuable paper had taken an interest
in the janitors' quarter, this addi
tional bathroom I learn has been
under lock and key and in a remote
part of the building, far away and
apart from the main lavatory, in a
private room where janitors were not
supposed to go.

I wish if Mr. Brown would please
inform the janitors through your valu
able paper why it is that the 40 jani
tors have to leave their warm beds '
and pile into the dining room each
morning and sit down to breakfast,
shivering with the cold, and no pro- !
vision made for their comfort by in- \
stalling some sort of a heating appa- ;
ratus by which the dining room could
be made warm or at least take the
chill out of the room? I wonder if i
Mr. Brown thinks the janitors should i
purchase a heating apparatus for the '
dining room, when their salary is the j
big sum of $2 per day.
Permit me, Mr. Editor, before clos- j
ing this letter, to offer a suggestion, |
and that is, that an order be issued
by the Stanford medical authorities
to Mr. Brown to collect all the blan
kets, comforts, and bedding now be- !
ing used by the janitors, and taken
immediately to a proper fumigating
plant, and there treated as they
should be by a fumigating process.
In addition to the previous sugges
tion, I would also suggest that the
Stanford University Medical Board
take Mr. John M. Brown's janitorial

shacks and shanties under its obser
vation and give the place a regular
monthly inspection, until such time
as a more suitable residence be pro- !
vided for each janitor.
Sincerely yours, James Tronan.

The Editor, Sir:
As an old-timer and an ex-janitor
who knows the ropes of the janitorial
service, and one who has the inter
ests of the janitors at heart, and who
has recently observed the several
news items and the editorials in your
Daily regarding the janitors' unsightly
and unsanitary premises, properly
named by Mr. Erwin "Shacks and
Shanties," and especially your edi
torial yesterday, viz.: "Brown Sees
No Slums," and as such I wish to ex
press my indignation at the stand
and explanation of Mr. John Brown,
the foreman who directs the work of
the janitors on the University
grounds, and who also represents the
American Building Maintenance Com
pany with head office in San Fran
cisco, and as such I wish to reply as
follows:
Mr. Brown says "that he would like
to see improvements made." Well, let
me ask Mr. Brown why it is that he,
as foreman and representative for his
company, has not had the milk of
human kindness in his heart and
looked after the interests and com
forts of his forty men, previous to
this wet, cold, and dreary winter, and
long before his attention was called
to the sad conditions of the janitors'
shacks and shanties by the Stanford
Daily.
I am indeed glad, Mr. Editor, that
you have made several suggestions
for Mr. Brown to follow, and I trust,
carry out, and thus help to bring
comfort and cheer to the janitors who
are laboring for Mr. Brown, without
whose help he would not be able to
hold his big, fat position.
You have rightly suggested that
Mr. Brown provide heat for the jani
tors' quarters in order to obviate the
necessity of the janitors building an
open fire each morning in the yard
in order to keep warm.
I think you have also struck the
keynote when you suggest that Mr.
Brown provide a suitable number of
shower baths for the janitors because
these are sadly lacking, and the con
dition of the present system is such
that the janitors are compelled to go
to the different students' quarters in
order to take their baths.
I have good information that some
thing formerly called mattresses used
by the janitors for their bedding are
in such a worn-out condition that they
should have been condemned long
ago, discarded and others used in
their place. While this condition
exists, Mr. Brown makes no attempt
at making any replacement, even
though the janitors pay for service
and comfort.
I trust the agitation just started in
your paper, seeking for the better
ment of the janitors' quarters will
continue until either the University
or the American Building Mainten
ance Company will be compelled to
take action, and make the necessary
repairs and improvements for the wel
fare and health of the janitors, even
though Mr. Brown says "that the
money for making such improvements
would have to come from somewhere."
Mr. Brown says: "I think these
quarters we got aren't so bad," and
yet he again says "the only thing I
see that could be done would be to
grow a hedge to keep these quarters
out of sight." I would like Mr. Brown
to answer me why it is that if these
quarters, shacks or shanties, the only
home the janitors have, are not so
bad, a hedge should be grown about
them in order to shut them from
public gaze.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Brown, if
your company has had the contract to
render janitorial service to Stanford
University for the past eight years,
why is it that you have not taken
action ere this to properly house and
care for your janitors as they should
have been housed and cared for?
Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, why
it is that your company contracts
with the Stanford University to sup
ply janitorial service at the rate of
50 cents'per hour per man, to $4.00
per day for 8 hours' service, and yet
your company pays the janitors only
25 cents per hour, plus board and
room. Thus the janitors received $2.00
per day with board and room for the
past 8 years, and all this time the
premises have been deteriorating and
going from bad to worse, and yet you
have made no attempt to better con
ditions for your janitors until the
Stanford Daily called your attention
to the conditions existing today. Let
me remind you that the janitors'
Bhacks and shanties are given free
by the University and yet the enor
mous rate you charge the men for
room and board is outrageous and
should be reduced. This high rate
really needs an explanation.
Mr. Brown says "that the janitors
are only janitors." What does ho
mean? I am at a loss to understand
what he means by such a statement
unless he thinks that the janitors are
interior beings and are not welcome
in good society.
Mr. Brown also says "that condi
tions are about as good as are to be
found anywhere." I am sorry that Mr.
Brown has such a distorted vision; I

think he must have a very severe
case of astigmatism and perhaps he
is correct from his own viewpoint,
taking things into consideration from
his past experience apart from Bome
janitors who were privileged to ren
der service in Stanford University,
and have moved on and upward into
other fields of usefulness. Perhaps
Mr. Brown's olfactory organs are out
of repair, and if such be the case, I
would suggest that he immediately
see a surgeon and this without delay.
Mr. Brown says "that most of his
men have been with him for years,
and that he gets a new one now and
then who doesn't stay long." Let me
ask Mr. Brown what he means by
making such a statement, "most of
his men." Out of the 40 janitors now
in his employ I understand I can
count on both hands every man who
has been employed on the University
buildings for over one year. Mr.
Brown is correct when he says, "He
gets a new man now and then who
doesn't stay long." This is largely
due to the fact that the newcomers
are accustomed to much better condi
tions and accommodations elsewhere.
Mr. Brown says "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man, they're
good healthy men, the men he gets."
Mr. Brown is quite right; I know he
is when he states "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man" be
cause instead of waiting for the ar
rival of the new man, he should have
a fumigated blanket ready to give him
upon his arrival, which system at this
place I don't think is in operation.
Mr. Brown says "the kind of men he
gets are good healthy men." Let me
ask Mr. Brown how he knows this to
be true. Does his company in San
Francisco who send the janitors to
Stanford from the employment office
or elsewhere in San Francisco em
ploy a physician to examine each
man, and provide him with a medical
certificate to present to Mr. Brown
upon his arrival? No, it does not;
then why does Mr. Brown take it for
granted, and give unhealthy men the
bedding, blankets, and comforts to be
used later by healthy men, without
any attempt made at fumigation?
Due to the lack of fumigating, the
blankets, comforts, and bedding in
general permit me to state that I
stand ready at any time to present
to Mr. Roth and Mr. Erwin the sum
of $50.00 in cash, which amount is to
be given to Mr. John M. Brown upon
the presentation of receipts to
Messrs. Roth and Erwin, giving dates
and places, showing where and when
and how many times the blankets,
comforts, and bedding now being
used by the janitors have been fumi
gated during the past four years, this
period being the term of service Mr.
Brown has been here as representa
tive for his company on the campus.
This offer of cash is made on condi
tion that Mr. John M. Brown also
place a cash deposit with Messrs.
Roth and Erwin to be given to the
undersigned, provided he cannot show
the required receipts giving the neces
sary information pertaining to the
fumigation process.
Mr. Brown informed the reporter
"that he stood shivering upon emerg
ing from a janitor's room." Then let
me ask Mr. Brown if he would like
to be the lonely occupant of such a
tireless shanty or shack which is
worse, I feel certain, than the heated
cell in San Quentin prison for a
felon.
Mr. Brown states "that most of his
men have provided themselves with

are only janitors." What does ho
mean? I am at a loss to understand
what he means by such a statement
unless he thinks that the janitors are
interior beings and are not welcome
in good society.
Mr. Brown also says "that condi
tions are about as good as are to be
found anywhere." I am sorry that Mr.
Brown has such a distorted vision; I

think he must have a very severe
case of astigmatism and perhaps he
is correct from his own viewpoint,
taking things into consideration from
his past experience apart from Bome
janitors who were privileged to ren
der service in Stanford University,
and have moved on and upward into
other fields of usefulness. Perhaps
Mr. Brown's olfactory organs are out
of repair, and if such be the case, I
would suggest that he immediately
see a surgeon and this without delay.
Mr. Brown says "that most of his
men have been with him for years,
and that he gets a new one now and
then who doesn't stay long." Let me
ask Mr. Brown what he means by
making such a statement, "most of
his men." Out of the 40 janitors now
in his employ I understand I can
count on both hands every man who
has been employed on the University
buildings for over one year. Mr.
Brown is correct when he says, "He
gets a new man now and then who
doesn't stay long." This is largely
due to the fact that the newcomers
are accustomed to much better condi
tions and accommodations elsewhere.
Mr. Brown says "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man, they're
good healthy men, the men he gets."
Mr. Brown is quite right; I know he
is when he states "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man" be
cause instead of waiting for the ar
rival of the new man, he should have
a fumigated blanket ready to give him
upon his arrival, which system at this
place I don't think is in operation.
Mr. Brown says "the kind of men he
gets are good healthy men." Let me
ask Mr. Brown how he knows this to
be true. Does his company in San
Francisco who send the janitors to
Stanford from the employment office
or elsewhere in San Francisco em
ploy a physician to examine each
man, and provide him with a medical
certificate to present to Mr. Brown
upon his arrival? No, it does not;
then why does Mr. Brown take it for
granted, and give unhealthy men the
bedding, blankets, and comforts to be
used later by healthy men, without
any attempt made at fumigation?
Due to the lack of fumigating, the
blankets, comforts, and bedding in
general permit me to state that I
stand ready at any time to present
to Mr. Roth and Mr. Erwin the sum
of $50.00 in cash, which amount is to
be given to Mr. John M. Brown upon
the presentation of receipts to
Messrs. Roth and Erwin, giving dates
and places, showing where and when
and how many times the blankets,
comforts, and bedding now being
used by the janitors have been fumi
gated during the past four years, this
period being the term of service Mr.
Brown has been here as representa
tive for his company on the campus.
This offer of cash is made on condi
tion that Mr. John M. Brown also
place a cash deposit with Messrs.
Roth and Erwin to be given to the
undersigned, provided he cannot show
the required receipts giving the neces
sary information pertaining to the
fumigation process.
Mr. Brown informed the reporter
"that he stood shivering upon emerg
ing from a janitor's room." Then let
me ask Mr. Brown if he would like
to be the lonely occupant of such a
tireless shanty or shack which is
worse, I feel certain, than the heated
cell in San Quentin prison for a
felon.
Mr. Brown states "that most of his
men have provided themselves with
electric heaters." Well, I don't know
that Mr. Brown is correct when he
says "most of the men," it is true
that some of them, who have person
ally paid for them and not Mr. Brown
nor his company.
Let me ask Mr. Brown if he has
made any provision for light at nights
to retire by, and to rise in the morn
ing when it is dark and the electric
light system so deficient has refused
to give light ? No, he has not, not
withstanding the fact that on several
occasions when the electric light went
out I understand requests were made
for candles but none were available,
and yet Mr. Brown charges the jani
tors for suitable, efficient service and
accommodations. How long, Mr.
Brown, is this condition of affairs
going to exist? Surely there is a djiy
of reckoning coming and let us hope
it will come soon. Why don't you,
Mr. Brown, knowing as you do, that
the lighting system in your janitors'
shacks and shanties is poor, provide
a candle and matches for your jani
tors in case of emergency?
"The glorious one shower bath,"
Mr. Brown has stated, "can be sup
plemented by an additional one, and
a bathroom, the janitors may use."
Permit me to state that until your
valuable paper had taken an interest
in the janitors' quarter, this addi
tional bathroom I learn has been
under lock and key and in a remote
part of the building, far away and
apart from the main lavatory, in a
private room where janitors were not
supposed to go.

I wish if Mr. Brown would please
inform the janitors through your valu
able paper why it is that the 40 jani
tors have to leave their warm beds '
and pile into the dining room each
morning and sit down to breakfast,
shivering with the cold, and no pro- !
vision made for their comfort by in- \
stalling some sort of a heating appa- ;
ratus by which the dining room could
be made warm or at least take the
chill out of the room? I wonder if i
Mr. Brown thinks the janitors should i
purchase a heating apparatus for the '
dining room, when their salary is the j
big sum of $2 per day.
Permit me, Mr. Editor, before clos- j
ing this letter, to offer a suggestion, |
and that is, that an order be issued
by the Stanford medical authorities
to Mr. Brown to collect all the blan
kets, comforts, and bedding now be- !
ing used by the janitors, and taken
immediately to a proper fumigating
plant, and there treated as they
should be by a fumigating process.
In addition to the previous sugges
tion, I would also suggest that the
Stanford University Medical Board
take Mr. John M. Brown's janitorial

shacks and shanties under its obser
vation and give the place a regular
monthly inspection, until such time
as a more suitable residence be pro- !
vided for each janitor.
Sincerely yours, James Tronan.

The Editor, Sir:
As an old-timer and an ex-janitor
who knows the ropes of the janitorial
service, and one who has the inter
ests of the janitors at heart, and who
has recently observed the several
news items and the editorials in your
Daily regarding the janitors' unsightly
and unsanitary premises, properly
named by Mr. Erwin "Shacks and
Shanties," and especially your edi
torial yesterday, viz.: "Brown Sees
No Slums," and as such I wish to ex
press my indignation at the stand
and explanation of Mr. John Brown,
the foreman who directs the work of
the janitors on the University
grounds, and who also represents the
American Building Maintenance Com
pany with head office in San Fran
cisco, and as such I wish to reply as
follows:
Mr. Brown says "that he would like
to see improvements made." Well, let
me ask Mr. Brown why it is that he,
as foreman and representative for his
company, has not had the milk of
human kindness in his heart and
looked after the interests and com
forts of his forty men, previous to
this wet, cold, and dreary winter, and
long before his attention was called
to the sad conditions of the janitors'
shacks and shanties by the Stanford
Daily.
I am indeed glad, Mr. Editor, that
you have made several suggestions
for Mr. Brown to follow, and I trust,
carry out, and thus help to bring
comfort and cheer to the janitors who
are laboring for Mr. Brown, without
whose help he would not be able to
hold his big, fat position.
You have rightly suggested that
Mr. Brown provide heat for the jani
tors' quarters in order to obviate the
necessity of the janitors building an
open fire each morning in the yard
in order to keep warm.
I think you have also struck the
keynote when you suggest that Mr.
Brown provide a suitable number of
shower baths for the janitors because
these are sadly lacking, and the con
dition of the present system is such
that the janitors are compelled to go
to the different students' quarters in
order to take their baths.
I have good information that some
thing formerly called mattresses used
by the janitors for their bedding are
in such a worn-out condition that they
should have been condemned long
ago, discarded and others used in
their place. While this condition
exists, Mr. Brown makes no attempt
at making any replacement, even
though the janitors pay for service
and comfort.
I trust the agitation just started in
your paper, seeking for the better
ment of the janitors' quarters will
continue until either the University
or the American Building Mainten
ance Company will be compelled to
take action, and make the necessary
repairs and improvements for the wel
fare and health of the janitors, even
though Mr. Brown says "that the
money for making such improvements
would have to come from somewhere."
Mr. Brown says: "I think these
quarters we got aren't so bad," and
yet he again says "the only thing I
see that could be done would be to
grow a hedge to keep these quarters
out of sight." I would like Mr. Brown
to answer me why it is that if these
quarters, shacks or shanties, the only
home the janitors have, are not so
bad, a hedge should be grown about
them in order to shut them from
public gaze.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Brown, if
your company has had the contract to
render janitorial service to Stanford
University for the past eight years,
why is it that you have not taken
action ere this to properly house and
care for your janitors as they should
have been housed and cared for?
Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, why
it is that your company contracts
with the Stanford University to sup
ply janitorial service at the rate of
50 cents'per hour per man, to $4.00
per day for 8 hours' service, and yet
your company pays the janitors only
25 cents per hour, plus board and
room. Thus the janitors received $2.00
per day with board and room for the
past 8 years, and all this time the
premises have been deteriorating and
going from bad to worse, and yet you
have made no attempt to better con
ditions for your janitors until the
Stanford Daily called your attention
to the conditions existing today. Let
me remind you that the janitors'
Bhacks and shanties are given free
by the University and yet the enor
mous rate you charge the men for
room and board is outrageous and
should be reduced. This high rate
really needs an explanation.
Mr. Brown says "that the janitors
are only janitors." What does ho
mean? I am at a loss to understand
what he means by such a statement
unless he thinks that the janitors are

to see improvements made." Well, let
me ask Mr. Brown why it is that he,
as foreman and representative for his
company, has not had the milk of
human kindness in his heart and
looked after the interests and com
forts of his forty men, previous to
this wet, cold, and dreary winter, and
long before his attention was called
to the sad conditions of the janitors'
shacks and shanties by the Stanford
Daily.
I am indeed glad, Mr. Editor, that
you have made several suggestions
for Mr. Brown to follow, and I trust,
carry out, and thus help to bring
comfort and cheer to the janitors who
are laboring for Mr. Brown, without
whose help he would not be able to
hold his big, fat position.
You have rightly suggested that
Mr. Brown provide heat for the jani
tors' quarters in order to obviate the
necessity of the janitors building an
open fire each morning in the yard
in order to keep warm.
I think you have also struck the
keynote when you suggest that Mr.
Brown provide a suitable number of
shower baths for the janitors because
these are sadly lacking, and the con
dition of the present system is such
that the janitors are compelled to go
to the different students' quarters in
order to take their baths.
I have good information that some
thing formerly called mattresses used
by the janitors for their bedding are
in such a worn-out condition that they
should have been condemned long
ago, discarded and others used in
their place. While this condition
exists, Mr. Brown makes no attempt
at making any replacement, even
though the janitors pay for service
and comfort.
I trust the agitation just started in
your paper, seeking for the better
ment of the janitors' quarters will
continue until either the University
or the American Building Mainten
ance Company will be compelled to
take action, and make the necessary
repairs and improvements for the wel
fare and health of the janitors, even
though Mr. Brown says "that the
money for making such improvements
would have to come from somewhere."
Mr. Brown says: "I think these
quarters we got aren't so bad," and
yet he again says "the only thing I
see that could be done would be to
grow a hedge to keep these quarters
out of sight." I would like Mr. Brown
to answer me why it is that if these
quarters, shacks or shanties, the only
home the janitors have, are not so
bad, a hedge should be grown about
them in order to shut them from
public gaze.
As a matter of fact, Mr. Brown, if
your company has had the contract to
render janitorial service to Stanford
University for the past eight years,
why is it that you have not taken
action ere this to properly house and
care for your janitors as they should
have been housed and cared for?
Let me ask you, Mr. Brown, why
it is that your company contracts
with the Stanford University to sup
ply janitorial service at the rate of
50 cents'per hour per man, to $4.00
per day for 8 hours' service, and yet
your company pays the janitors only
25 cents per hour, plus board and
room. Thus the janitors received $2.00
per day with board and room for the
past 8 years, and all this time the
premises have been deteriorating and
going from bad to worse, and yet you
have made no attempt to better con
ditions for your janitors until the
Stanford Daily called your attention
to the conditions existing today. Let
me remind you that the janitors'
Bhacks and shanties are given free
by the University and yet the enor
mous rate you charge the men for
room and board is outrageous and
should be reduced. This high rate
really needs an explanation.
Mr. Brown says "that the janitors
are only janitors." What does ho
mean? I am at a loss to understand
what he means by such a statement
unless he thinks that the janitors are
interior beings and are not welcome
in good society.
Mr. Brown also says "that condi
tions are about as good as are to be
found anywhere." I am sorry that Mr.
Brown has such a distorted vision; I

think he must have a very severe
case of astigmatism and perhaps he
is correct from his own viewpoint,
taking things into consideration from
his past experience apart from Bome
janitors who were privileged to ren
der service in Stanford University,
and have moved on and upward into
other fields of usefulness. Perhaps
Mr. Brown's olfactory organs are out
of repair, and if such be the case, I
would suggest that he immediately
see a surgeon and this without delay.
Mr. Brown says "that most of his
men have been with him for years,
and that he gets a new one now and
then who doesn't stay long." Let me
ask Mr. Brown what he means by
making such a statement, "most of
his men." Out of the 40 janitors now
in his employ I understand I can
count on both hands every man who
has been employed on the University
buildings for over one year. Mr.
Brown is correct when he says, "He
gets a new man now and then who
doesn't stay long." This is largely
due to the fact that the newcomers
are accustomed to much better condi
tions and accommodations elsewhere.
Mr. Brown says "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man, they're
good healthy men, the men he gets."
Mr. Brown is quite right; I know he
is when he states "that it is not
necessary to fumigate the blankets
every time he gets a new man" be
cause instead of waiting for the ar
rival of the new man, he should have
a fumigated blanket ready to give him
upon his arrival, which system at this
place I don't think is in operation.
Mr. Brown says "the kind of men he
gets are good healthy men." Let me
ask Mr. Brown how he knows this to
be true. Does his company in San
Francisco who send the janitors to
Stanford from the employment office
or elsewhere in San Francisco em
ploy a physician to examine each
man, and provide him with a medical
certificate to present to Mr. Brown
upon his arrival? No, it does not;
then why does Mr. Brown take it for
granted, and give unhealthy men the
bedding, blankets, and comforts to be
used later by healthy men, without
any attempt made at fumigation?
Due to the lack of fumigating, the
blankets, comforts, and bedding in
general permit me to state that I
stand ready at any time to present
to Mr. Roth and Mr. Erwin the sum
of $50.00 in cash, which amount is to
be given to Mr. John M. Brown upon
the presentation of receipts to
Messrs. Roth and Erwin, giving dates
and places, showing where and when
and how many times the blankets,
comforts, and bedding now being
used by the janitors have been fumi
gated during the past four years, this
period being the term of service Mr.
Brown has been here as representa
tive for his company on the campus.
This offer of cash is made on condi
tion that Mr. John M. Brown also
place a cash deposit with Messrs.
Roth and Erwin to be given to the
undersigned, provided he cannot show
the required receipts giving the neces
sary information pertaining to the
fumigation process.
Mr. Brown informed the reporter
"that he stood shivering upon emerg
ing from a janitor's room." Then let
me ask Mr. Brown if he would like
to be the lonely occupant of such a
tireless shanty or shack which is
worse, I feel certain, than the heated
cell in San Quentin prison for a
felon.
Mr. Brown states "that most of his
men have provided themselves with
electric heaters." Well, I don't know
that Mr. Brown is correct when he
says "most of the men," it is true
that some of them, who have person
ally paid for them and not Mr. Brown
nor his company.
Let me ask Mr. Brown if he has
made any provision for light at nights
to retire by, and to rise in the morn
ing when it is dark and the electric
light system so deficient has refused
to give light ? No, he has not, not
withstanding the fact that on several
occasions when the electric light went
out I understand requests were made
for candles but none were available,
and yet Mr. Brown charges the jani
tors for suitable, efficient service and
accommodations. How long, Mr.
Brown, is this condition of affairs
going to exist? Surely there is a djiy
of reckoning coming and let us hope
it will come soon. Why don't you,
Mr. Brown, knowing as you do, that
the lighting system in your janitors'
shacks and shanties is poor, provide
a candle and matches for your jani
tors in case of emergency?
"The glorious one shower bath,"
Mr. Brown has stated, "can be sup
plemented by an additional one, and
a bathroom, the janitors may use."
Permit me to state that until your
valuable paper had taken an interest
in the janitors' quarter, this addi
tional bathroom I learn has been
under lock and key and in a remote
part of the building, far away and
apart from the main lavatory, in a
private room where janitors were not
supposed to go.

I wish if Mr. Brown would please
inform the janitors through your valu
able paper why it is that the 40 jani
tors have to leave their warm beds '
and pile into the dining room each
morning and sit down to breakfast,
shivering with the cold, and no pro- !
vision made for their comfort by in- \
stalling some sort of a heating appa- ;
ratus by which the dining room could
be made warm or at least take the
chill out of the room? I wonder if i
Mr. Brown thinks the janitors should i
purchase a heating apparatus for the '
dining room, when their salary is the j
big sum of $2 per day.
Permit me, Mr. Editor, before clos- j
ing this letter, to offer a suggestion, |
and that is, that an order be issued
by the Stanford medical authorities
to Mr. Brown to collect all the blan
kets, comforts, and bedding now be- !
ing used by the janitors, and taken
immediately to a proper fumigating
plant, and there treated as they
should be by a fumigating process.
In addition to the previous sugges
tion, I would also suggest that the
Stanford University Medical Board
take Mr. John M. Brown's janitorial

shacks and shanties under its obser
vation and give the place a regular
monthly inspection, until such time
as a more suitable residence be pro- !
vided for each janitor.
Sincerely yours, James Tronan.
