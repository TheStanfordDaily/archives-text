# YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER GETS AIRPLANE RIDE
## 
### 
Peggy Ann Reid, year-old daughter
of Professor Elliott G. Reid of the
Guggenheim Aeronautics Foundation,
took a flight at the Palo Alto School
of Aviation last Sunday, in company
with her father. Mr. Goddard, presi
dent of the school, acted as pilot on
the trip. This is the youngest passen
ger that has made a flight at the
school since its inception nearly two
years ago.
Last Tuesday, Mrs. Phyllis M. God
dard, wife of Lieutenant Goddard, and
James W. Mac Donald passed the gov
ernment test for private pilot's li
censes. They are the first from Palo
Alto to receive their licenses this
year.
