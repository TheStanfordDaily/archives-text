CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 16.—The
theory of the American student of
the eighteenth century, and the seven
teenth century —was "so incurably ad
dicted to studious piety that he found
little time for play and none for dis
sipation" suffered a severe jolt re
cently through revelations of student
habits in diaries and records now in
the possession of Harvard University.
Among these records is an incident
recorded by one Ezra Clapp, a stu
dent at Yale in 1738, who writes:
"Last night some of the freshmen
got six quarts of rum and about two
pavls of syder, and about eight pounds
of sugar and made it into Samson,
and invited every scholar in the col
lege into Curtis' room, and we made
such prodigious rough that we raised
the tutor, and he ordered us all to
our rooms and some went and some
tarried, and they gathered again and
went to old father Monsher's dore and
drummed against the dore and
screamed so that a body would have
thought they were killing dogs there."
