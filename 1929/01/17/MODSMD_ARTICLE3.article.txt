# CRUISER PROPOSAL FOLLOWS KELLOGG TREATY TO SENATE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16. (/P)â€”IThe1 The
Administration's cruiser bill, propos
ing the addition of fifteen cruisers
and an airplane carrier to the Ameri
can Navy, was placed before the Sen
ate today in the wake of the Kellogg
Treaty to renounce war as a national
policy.
Like the treaty, which was ratified
yesterday, the cruiser bill was de
scribed by the first Senator to speak
upon it as a measure with a peaceful
purpose. Senator Swanson, of Vir
ginia, a Democrat, who opened the
debate, declared it really held out
the olive branch of peace. The Vir
ginian expressed the belief that it
might be an object lesson to Great
Britain and might result in further
moves for arms limitations.
The House received from its ap
propriations committee the supply
bill for the various independent of
fices of the government, including the
Veterans Bureau, which was allotted
$499,975,000 to handle the problems
of World War Veterans and others
who come within its jurisdiction.
Action in the Senate was not con
fined entirely to the treaty. Senator
Sheppard, of Texas, author of the
Prohibition Amendment, was given
time to speak in commemoration of
(he tenth anniversary of the law
which he said was "forever anchored
in the heart and purpose of Almighty
God." The committee activity cen
tered largely around the Ways and
Means Committee and its hearings on
tariff revision.
