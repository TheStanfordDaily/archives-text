# SPORTS OF 1929
## An Uncrowned King 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Sports history is full of stories of
uncrowned champions. Such a man is
Irving Jaffee of the Iceland Skating
Club of New York, winner of the
Olympic 10,000-meter ice champion
ship, but not the official title-holder.
Officials at the Olympic winter sports
suddenly canceled the race (after
Jaffee had made the best time) giving
"soft ice" as their excuse. The race
was never reskated, and the Ameri
can boy was deprived of a title
through no fault of his own. Irv's
time was better than that of IJernt
Evonsen, of Norway, who finished
second to Thunberg, of Finland, in
the 1500 and 500 meter races.
When the race was canceled, after
six contestants had completed their
hents, because of the soggy condition
of the ice, America's official repre
sentative, Gus Kirby, protested and
finally the executive commission of

the International Olympic committee
recognized Jaffee as official champion.
After much bickering and disputing,
it was agreed to reskate the race, as
Eddie Murphy of Chicago, among
others, had not yet had a chance to
compete. But this was impossible and
the International Skating Federation
refused to name an official Olympic
champion for that distance. Jaffee's
time was 18 minutes, 3(5 5-10 seconds.
At the Middle Atlantic Skating As
sociation speed championships, held
at Newburgh, N.Y., on New Year's
Hay, Jaffee won the mile event, but
fell at the last turn of the half mile,
when a victory would have given him
the title, with Hixty points, instead
of Hialis winning it with fifty. Even
second place would have given him a
tie with the ultimate winner.
Perhaps Fate will be a little kinder
to this uncrowned champion in the
I future.
