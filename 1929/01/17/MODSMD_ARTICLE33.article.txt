### PHILIP SPACE 
Yesterday's column had to be omit
ted, since it was "The Day of Si
lence," and we didn't want to jeop
ardize our chance of getting into one
of the best sororities on the campus,
even if it IS only through the back
door.
Today's saddest spectacle is the
jhouse that rushed a very large car
only to find that it was a driv-ur-self.
A Mister Norman, on today's edi
torial page, says that sororities ought
to be abolished. He is not very ob
serving. We saw a couple of fraternity
houses hidden behind a clump of
trees yesterday.
After the brawl is over
After the clans are done
After the nuggets leaving
After the gamut's run
Many a heart is aching
—Not hard to count them all—
Many a promise has vanished
After the brawl.
Then there was the sorority who
j pledged three legacies only to find
| out they were going under assumed
I names.
Oh there's a road from Roble
As plain as plain can be
And from the Row to Roble
A chain of legacy.
For some the road to Roble
Is short and lined with smiles
But for the independent gal
It's fifty thousand miles.
Sequoia's posters announce an "Ori
ental Dance." Now come, come —'fess j
up, fellers —this is really the Bon-
Odori Festival, isn't it?
Don't be ashamed of the title you
picked, boys—a dance by any other |
the name could never smell as sweet. <
