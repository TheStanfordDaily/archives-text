Ten Commandments of Popularity"
were drawn up recently by the co-eds
of the University of Cincinnati, led
hy the president of the Young Wo
men's Christian Association, who is
also sports editor of the college
paper. They are:
I. Always be a lady. Use good taste
in selecting your clothes and do not
let actions belie that taste.
11. Always be a good sport. Do what
the majority wants, but not to the
detriment of your own convictions
and ideals.
111. Handing a line is helpful. Even
if you are not the type, this "you
great-big-wondert'ul-boy" stuff does get
over, used in moderation, of course.
IV. Play tennis, golf, bridge, swim,
and dance. If not all, then do these
two certainly—play bridge and dance.
V. Read the papers. Know your
current events, politics, and athletics.
It is well to be able to converse on
serious subjects as well as light ones.
VI. Do not "neck." If a girl is
charming and peppy enough to in

about being the gold-digger type.
VII. Do not kiss promiscuously.
There is no harm in kissing a boy of
whom you are particularly fond.
VIII. Dress attractively but not
necessarily expensively.
IX. A boy notices the general ef
fect you produce, so be as pretty as
you can, but do not make up heavily.
X. First, last, and always—be femi
nine.
