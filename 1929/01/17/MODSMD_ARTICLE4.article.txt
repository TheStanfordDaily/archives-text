# ILLNESS CAUSES CANCELLATION OF A.S.S.U. CONCERT
## 
### 
The Zimbalist concert scheduled
for tonight under the auspices of the
Associated Students has been called
off, according to Sid Madden, A.S.S.U.
concert manager. Efrem Zimbalist
had to cancel all his engagements
for the season since he has been very
ill and will not be able to appear for
the rest of the season.
No concert will be held in place
of this one tonight, but Albert Spald
ing, world-famous violinist, has been
obtained to play here 011 April 4.
Tickets for the Zimbalist concert will
give admittance to the Spaulding con
cert April 4, and the same seating
arrangement will be used.
According to Madden, it is very for
tunate that Spalding could be ob
tained at this time, since his sched
ule was very full. Spalding is an
American, but made his debut in
Paris in 1905, and his American debut
three years later in New York in the
Damrosch orchestra.
The only A.S.S.U. concert to be
held this quarter is the one scheduled
for February 11, when Margaret Mat
zenauer will sing. The Spalding con
cert, and the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra concert will be
given spring quarter.
