### 
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Jan. 16. (A 3 ) â€”
The present rule in basketball which
calls for a toss-up at center to put the
hall in play today was termed un
sportsmanlike by Dr. Walter Mean
well, University of Wisconsin basket
ball coach.
The Wisconsin-Chicago game in

which the former beat the Maroons,
was an example, said l)r. Mean well.
The fact that tin; Wisconsin center
was two and a half inches taller than
his opponent and consequently out
jumped him won the game for Wis
consin, the coach said.
A Virginia sweet potato grew
through the hole in a key to spread
i generously on all sides.
