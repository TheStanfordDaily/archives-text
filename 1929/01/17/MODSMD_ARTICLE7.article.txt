## France Is Expected To Lead European Nations In Signing Pact 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 16. (JP) — A j
White House ceremony was arranged j
today by President Coolidge for his j
| formal signing at 10 o'clock tomorrow !
| morning of the document of ratifica- I
tion of the Kellogg Treaty pledging
I the nations of the world to renounce ,
war. .
Members .of the Senate who yes- j
! terday ratified the treaty by a vote I
of 85 to 1 were invited to attend by ;
Mr. Coolidge who also will have with j
him the members of the Cabinet. The j
ceremony will be held in the east J
i room of the White House.
PARIS, Jan. 16. (/P) —European na
tions which, out of diplomatic cour- :
tesy have been waiting for the United
j States to ratify the Kellogg-Briand
| Pact for the renunciation of war, will
now make haste to follow the exam
[ pie in the opinion of diplomatic cir
{ cles in Paris. Those circles today
gave America ample credit for lead
ership in the move for peace.
Prance probably will be, the first
; country of the Old World to give the
pact the stamp of Parliamentary ap
proval.
The satisfaction in French official '
|
j circles over the action at Washing- j
| ton was all the greater because it !
| was believed that the almost unani- ,
j raous vote of the United States Sen- !
ate would checkmate the policy cred-!
ited to Moscow of exploiting the !
multilateral treaty for Soviet political
purposes among the Baltic States and j
{ in the Balkans.
