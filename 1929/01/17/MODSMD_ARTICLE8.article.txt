# STANFORD FROSH PLAY ONLY HOME TILT HERE FRIDAY

### WHITNEY WRIGHT 
While the varsity basks in Southern
California sunshine (advt.) prepara
tory to clashing with the U.S.C.
hoopsters, Stanford's yearling quintet
will be the center of attention on the
Farm when it meets the Richmond
High School basketball team in their
fifth game of the season tomorrow
night at 7:15 o'clock.
Although their record has been
marred by a last-minute defeat at the
hands of the Santa Clara freshmen,
hopes for a successful season are still
high among followers of the Cardinal
youngsters. Judging by the brand of
basketball which they have displayed
in all the games to date, they should
have an easy time against the Rich
mond cagers tomorrow night.
With the return of Jim Shrader,
star forward, who has been laid up
by an injured ankle for the past week,
the squad will be intact for the first
time. Just who will start at forward
tomorrow is still in doubt, since
Coach Rradshaw has three equally
good candidates for the positions.
Both Ray and Kelly, who have been
carrying on the brunt of the attack
in the past few games, have proved
themselves invaluable. Ray is fast
and tricky and a good shot; while
Kelly is an accurate passer and
equally good on offense and defense.
Shrader has seen very little action
this season, but is known to be a fast
player and a "dead-eye" on short
shots.
