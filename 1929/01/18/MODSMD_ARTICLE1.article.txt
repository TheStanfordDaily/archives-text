### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 17 (/P).—
Bearing the signature of President Coo
lidge, a brief but portentous document
reposed tonight in the archives of the
State Department to attest that the Uni
ted States has given its full and uncon
ditional approval to the Kellogg treaty
for the renunciation of war.
The paper, known officially as the in
strument of ratification, was signed today
by the chief executive in the midst of
ceremonies imposing in their simplicity,
and surrounded by an atmosphere of
solemnity befitting the supreme impor
tance which Mr. Coolidge attaches to the
pact.
U.S. First to Sign
To America fell the distinction of be
ing the first of the fifteen original signa
tory nations to ratify the pact, but be
fore it can become effective it must be
approved by the fourteen other powers
in the manner prescribed by their respec
tive constitutions, and their own instru
ments of ratification must be deposited
with the Washington government, which
is custodian of the original treaty.
Seven nations have now virtually com
pleted their acceptance of the treaty.
They are Afghanistan, Austria, Domini- j
can Republic, Ethiopia, Soviet Russia, |
Siam, and the United States. Siam'j ad
herence was deposited yesterday by the
Siamese minister. Seven other countries
have ratified the treaty, documents of
ratification being en route here from Al
bania, Cuba, Liberia, Panama, Haiti,
Paraguay, and Portugal.
LONDON, Jan. 17 (/P). —Commenting
on the ratification of the Kellogg pact,
the Times said today that the "achieve
ment associated with Kellogg's name may
be regarded as registering and promising
a definite change in the course of the
world's history."
Regarding the interpretations, the pa
per said: "It would be anything but rein
forcement of security if the new dispen
sation appeared to challenge such an in
stitution as the Monroe Doctrine or any
arrangement similarly vital to a signa
tory state."
