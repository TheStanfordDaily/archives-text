### SYLVA WEAVER 
"The limitations of dramatics merely as a student activity are now evident,"
said Gordon Davis yesterday in an interview on the plan for Stanford's new
theatre. "It has come to the point where we must either go forward into a position
of leadership or drop behind those other institutions which are recognizing the
modern relationship between university and theatre."
Davis traced the history of the theatre movement in the universities. "We are
undergoing a period of transition in the theatre. Twenty years ago the first chair
of playwriting was endowed at Harvard. Hitherto the drama had been the object
of historical literary study only. From this single beginning the student of the
contemporary theatre can trace the influence which is rapidly transforming the
theatre.

"All over the country theatres are
springing up in the colleges and universi
ties, and departments of speech and oral
expression are being organized around
them into Schools of the Theatre, with
the living drama as a focal point for their
allied courses. Yale has already taken the
foremost position with a splendid theatre
and a highly trained faculty, the result
of the million-dollar gift of Edward S.
Harkness for a drama department.

Stanford Should Lead
"Stanford is the logical university to
undertake the leadership of the Pacific
Coast," continued Davis. "We have a
remarkable history of dramatics here.
When older universities were staging
ephemeral musical extravaganzas, Stan
ford was producing revivals of the clas
sics as well as the best of contemporary
drama. The university has always given
great encouragement to dramatics as a
student activity, but Stanford has now
outgrown that period.

"Stanford is the logical university to
undertake the leadership of the Pacific
Coast," continued Davis. "We have a
remarkable history of dramatics here.
When older universities were staging
ephemeral musical extravaganzas, Stan
ford was producing revivals of the clas

drama. The university has always given
great encouragement to dramatics as a
student activity, but Stanford has now
outgrown that period.

springing up in the colleges and universi
ties, and departments of speech and oral

the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Drama.
