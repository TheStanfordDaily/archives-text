# U.C.L.A. QUINTET WILL MEET BEARS TONIGHT

IOS ANGELES, Jan. 17. â€” Deter
mined the Berkeley Bears shall not spike
its guns as Stanford did last week-end,
"Caddy" Works' U.C.L.A. Blue Brigade
entrains tonight at Glendale for a two
game basketball series in the north. The
Bears, fresh from two triumphs over
U.S.C., will be heavily favored to take
both the Friday and Saturday night tus
sles.
If fight will win, the Blueshirt may
come through with a win either Friday
or Saturday. But it will take more than
fight alone to down the Bears, as those
who saw them play in the Southland can
attest.
Works has put his men through stiff
paces this vyeek. The usual "big guns"
of the U.C.L.A. attack collapsed against
Stanford and he wants no repetition.
