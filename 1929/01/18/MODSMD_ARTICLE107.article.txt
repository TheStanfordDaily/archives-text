The Cardinals of Stanford Univer
sity, under the football guidance of
Glenn (Pop) Warner have made the
reverse play their principal offensive |
â€¢weapon but the famous coach who
criminated the play remembers when j
his own team had little confidence |
in it.
That was back years ago wheu
Coach Warner was at Haskell. War
ner said it was the old criss-cross
play that started him to thinking
sbout a play that led to the reverse.
Didn't Always Work
"You know the criss-cross largely !
depended on deception to fool the op- j
posing ends. And sometimes that j
didn't work. I decided that if the ends i
rould be taken out on the play it !
would add greatly to the effective- 1
uesfl, by removing largely the ele- J
ment of chance in deceiving the
other team."
So, he says, he decided that his
guards could get to the ends in time
to cut them out of the play and thus
clear the way for the runner, who is i

escorted by proper interference.
"We worked this in practice but
the Indians didn't have confidence in
i the play. We went through a game
! and our quarterback didn't use It a
time. After the game, I asked him
i about it and he replied that he forgot
to use it.
"Of course, if he forgot it that was
I proof that little confidence was placed
in it. And a play that hasn't the con
confidence of the players can't bring
results.
Reverse Last Resort
"Then, we played Harvard and they
were giving us a severe beating. The
Indians used everything they had ex
! cept the reverse without gain and
then as a desperate chance they tried
it.
"We gained 15 yards the first, time
it was tried. We used it again and
gained 15 more. And the rest of the
afternoon it gained great yardage.
"The next morning the Boston
critic wrote 'Harvard was fooled time
and again by the moth-eaten criss
' cross.'
"From then on, it was a favorite
I play of the Indiana."
