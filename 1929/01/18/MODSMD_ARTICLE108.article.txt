FORT MYERS, Fla., Jan. 17. (A J )~
Thomas A. Edison, electrical wizard,
was back at his winter estate here
♦oaay for a resumption of his re
search work in a new field —search
lor a plant capable of producing suf
ficient rubber to supply the United
States in case of a national emer
gency.
Welcomed last night by several
hundred friends when he arrived from
his New Jersey home, the aged in
ventor planned to be up early today
to inspect his many experimental
plants.
Several changes greeted the creator
of the talking machine and the in
candescent electric light this morn
ing, chief among which was a new
laboratory, a surprise present from

his wife. The old building, in which
the experiments were made on mod
ern electric light globes, was re
moved last summer to the Detroit
Museum ot' American History.
Will Be 82 Next Month
Mr, Edison will be 82 years old
February 11, and a party is planned
for that occasion, with the guest list
to include Mr. Ford, Harvey Firestone,
and probably President-elect Hoover.
All except Mr. Hoover have accepted.
Meanwhile Mr. Edison will confine
his activities to his research for rub
ber He will examine plants at the
rate of 04 a day.
One thing which impressed the in
ventor on his arrival last night was
the relegation of his old 1914 "Flivver"
to the role of a baggage van.
