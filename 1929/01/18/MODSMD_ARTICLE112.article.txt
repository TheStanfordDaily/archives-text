anced in its historical, critical, and crea

the literature of the drama.
Dramatic Writing
"In the School Stanford could train
leaders for the amateur stage every
where. All types of drama could be
presented as an adjunct to classroom
study. Professional traveling companies
could lie accommodated, and the work of
Stanford's own students of dramatic
writing could be brought forth.
"We do not hope for all of it at once,
however, and the $.550,000 set by Hammer
and Coffin as the total for the student
fund will put us well on our way to
dramatic achievement," Davis concluded.
