Kappa Alpha came from behind a
7-1 score to tie the count 9-all at the
half and from then on steadily in
creased its lead in a well-played game.
Davis of Kappa Alpha was high-point
man with 12 tallies.
Phi Kappa Sigma walked over an
Encina team with very little competi
tion. Hervey scored 14 points for the
Phi Kaps to be high man on both
teams.
In the best game of the evening El
Campo nosed out a strong and fast
playing Beta team after trailing 12-8
at the half. Both teams played a rous
ing game throughout. There were no
individual stars. Doug Lewis at guard
played a fine game for the Betas and
Gatzert of El Campo was high-point
man, scoring 9 points.
El Cuadro won from Sequoia II in
a light workout. Button was high
man with 16 tallies for the winning
team.
Encina 2W opened up in the final
quarter to win what had been a fairly
even game 20-12 from El Tigre. The
game was moderately fast and closely
fought.
The A.K.L.'s upset a dazed Fiji
quintet in a rough and slow game.
The shooting on both sides was er
ratic. Thomas of the Fijis played a
good game at running guard and
broke up several scoring attacks of
the victors.
In the final game of the evening
Delta Upsilon rushed a plucky but
ineffectual Chinese Club team. Huls
man of D.U. was high with ten points,
while Fong scored 6 points for the
club.
