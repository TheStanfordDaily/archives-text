# VARSITY CAGERS HEAD SOUTH FOR TROJAN CONTEST
## Stanford Quintet Is Favorite Over Southerners; Victory Will Prove Card Strength Mortensen, Cano, and Nibley Are Strongest Scorers of Coach Leo Calland's Team 
### ANSON REEDER 
Stanford supporters will get their first
chance of the season to judge the com
parative abilities of the Card and Bear
cagers when the RedsHirts meet the Tro
jans in Los Angeles tomorrow night.
The Stanford squad will leave for the
south on the Lark tonight.
Last week-end the Golden Bears de
cisively waxed the Sons of Troy on the
same court in two contests, 43-38 and 33-
27. So the Southerners are now holding
down the cellar position. But one must
not overlook the fact that Coach Leo
Calland's squad is always dangerous, and
though the Cards are slight favorites in
tomorrow's tilt, they will not find a bed
of roses waiting for them when they ar
rive at the portals of old S.C.
S.C. Defense Strong
Mortensen, center, Cano and Nibley,
forwards, are the main scoring strength
of the Trojans. Mortensen was high
point man for his team in both of the
Bear contests. The Southerners stress a
strong offense, and depend upon the in
genuity of their guards to recover the
ball out of the mad scramble under the
visitors' basket.
At the present time California is lead
ing the Conference with two games won
and none lost. Stanford is second with
one game and no losses. U.C.L.A. has
won none and lost one. The Trojans have
lost two and won none.
Bears Should Win
In the games this week-end California
is the favorite to win over her shadow
from Los Angeles when they meet for
their two-game series in Oakland tonight
and tomorrow. Stanford is given a good
chance to beat Southern California, not
so much because of her own showing so
far this season, hut because of the drub
bing which the Bears handed Troy.
Coach Husky Hunt drilled his men
on a fast breaking offense yesterday af
ternoon in the hope that they will be able
to use it tomorrow night. So far this
season this style of play has not worked
out because of the failure of the guards
to recover the ball off of the board
quick enough to get it started down the
floor before the visiting team had its de
fense in position. Part of the time was
spent on fundamentals, practicing free
throws, pivoting, and so forth.

participated in the four games played

Calland's squad is always dangerous, and
though the Cards are slight favorites in
tomorrow's tilt, they will not find a bed
of roses waiting for them when they ar
rive at the portals of old S.C.
S.C. Defense Strong
Mortensen, center, Cano and Nibley,
forwards, are the main scoring strength
of the Trojans. Mortensen was high
point man for his team in both of the
Bear contests. The Southerners stress a
strong offense, and depend upon the in
genuity of their guards to recover the
ball out of the mad scramble under the
visitors' basket.
At the present time California is lead
ing the Conference with two games won
and none lost. Stanford is second with
one game and no losses. U.C.L.A. has
won none and lost one. The Trojans have
lost two and won none.
Bears Should Win
In the games this week-end California
is the favorite to win over her shadow
from Los Angeles when they meet for
their two-game series in Oakland tonight
and tomorrow. Stanford is given a good
chance to beat Southern California, not
so much because of her own showing so
far this season, hut because of the drub
bing which the Bears handed Troy.
Coach Husky Hunt drilled his men
on a fast breaking offense yesterday af
ternoon in the hope that they will be able
to use it tomorrow night. So far this
season this style of play has not worked
out because of the failure of the guards
to recover the ball off of the board
quick enough to get it started down the
floor before the visiting team had its de
fense in position. Part of the time was
spent on fundamentals, practicing free
throws, pivoting, and so forth.
A total of individual points scored,
with average per game, for all men who
participated in the four games played
so far this year, follows:

Stanford supporters will get their first
chance of the season to judge the com
parative abilities of the Card and Bear
cagers when the RedsHirts meet the Tro
jans in Los Angeles tomorrow night.
The Stanford squad will leave for the
south on the Lark tonight.
Last week-end the Golden Bears de
cisively waxed the Sons of Troy on the
same court in two contests, 43-38 and 33-
27. So the Southerners are now holding
down the cellar position. But one must
not overlook the fact that Coach Leo
Calland's squad is always dangerous, and
though the Cards are slight favorites in
tomorrow's tilt, they will not find a bed
of roses waiting for them when they ar
