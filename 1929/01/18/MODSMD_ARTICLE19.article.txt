# Dr. Jordan Adds Another Year
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will he able to celcbrate his seventy-eighth birthday to
morrow with the consciousness that he is still a force in the nation, still
a battler; feared by a few, and admired by most. Within the past year
proof has been given of the terror which Dr. Jordan's acts and words
can strike into craven hearts and misguided minds. The Daughters of
the American Revolution "dinged" him—struck him off their speaking
lists —because, it is assumed, his incessant repetition of his common-sense
views on peace conflicted quite definitely with the America First and
Last, Right or Wrong doctrine subscribed to by that venerable organi
zation.
Perhaps one of the triumphs of his life, which the Chancellor most
fondly regards upon the passing of his seventy-seventh year, is the elec
tion to the presidency of Herbert Hoover. There is no denying it is
hard for a student of our day to imagine the cordiality of relations be
tween the undergraduates and the faculty which obtained in Hoover's
time. Great was the influence of Dr. Jordan's character upon all the
students in those early days; great was his example; and since then, great
has been the admiration of Dr. Jordan for his protege. The depth of his
pride in-Mr. Hoover was plain to see in the Chancellor's face as he took
his seat in the grandstand last August on Notification Day.
Dr. Jordan is known as an "educator, author, and-naturalist," his par
ticular field being ichthyology. He has enjoyed the reputation of being the
ranking authority on fishes, but it is the universality of his knowledge
that astonishes the average person who attends his conferences. He can
go from St. Thomas Aquinas to Henry Ford, returning by way of Plato,
with charming facility and unwaning interestingness. He is yet, though
far advanced in life and yearly growing more feeble, the mentor of
Stanford students. His home is the academy to which a throng goes on
Thursday nights to listen to the wisdom of the teacher.
Dr. Jordan is the patriarch of the Stanford tribe. May his white hair
continue to blow in die Luft dcr Freihcit!
