# DANCE DRAMA WILL BE PRESENTED MARCH 12
## 
### 
At a meeting of the class in dance
composition last night, March 12 was
chosen as the date for the presenta
tion of the dance drama. As in the
two previous years, the drama will
he sponsored by the dance composi
tion class and will be open to the
public.
Plans for the presentation include
the main drama and several short
dances independent of the principal
theme. The greatest simplicity in cos
tumes and lighting effects will be
maintained throughout the produc
tion, and the stage settings will be
distinctly modern.
