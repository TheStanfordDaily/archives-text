# The 						Aga Khan Bottling Works
## 
### 
It is hard for the occidental mind to comprehend the religious fervor
of the Mohammedan. Whenever the Aga Khan of India takes a bath,
the bathwater is carefully preserved, bottled, and shipped to Mohamme
dan communities throughout the world. Thus the faithful arc provided
â– with a priceless boon, holy water in which a descendant of the prophet
Mohammed laved himself.
The Aga Khan receives a mere pittance for this great service, his
weight in gold. Assuming that the Khan weighs 160 pounds or so, his
yearly income would amount to some $50,000. It's sad that many an
American matron can't sell her undesircd weight which she pays to have
removed.
Will Durant, not to mention I'lato, suggests a college of political
administration, specifically established to train men for governmental
office and in this way to obviate elections. The recent presidential elec
tion cost thirty cents a vote, a total of $11,618,000. Such a college might
be an economy.
