# The 						Bullsession

### 
Said Professor Harry Elmer Barnes
t the convention of the American

Association for the Advancement of
Science, "Sin is scientifically indefin
able and unknowable We must
cease talking of God. We must sup
plant theology by menltal hygiene.
Science has shown it difficult to prove
the very existence of God."
A whoop and a holler went up from
the ranks of the theologians at this.
Here was a man denying the very es
sence of their doctrine. The bulwark
of their faith was being attacked.
Yet the same thing has been said
for centuries and the theologians
have reacted in the same manner,
with the exception that they used to
burn heretics.
If the church stops worrying about
the hereafter and the problems of
sin and the existence of God and
turns its whole vitality to the end of
social betterment in the present,
there will be no need of fearing that
anything can threaten its position in
the world.
When two thousand citizens of the
sovereign state of Mississippi rise up
in wrath and revenge and after the

manner of medieval inquisitors burn
a negro to death as they did last
week, there is 110 doubt of the practi
cal work to be done by the church.
When education to the end that
man may be enlightened is bulked by
law as it is in Tennessee and Arkan
sas because it expounds theories in
the light of truth, the church has an
other practical problem to cope with.
The belief in God and sin may help
many but the disbelief in both hin
ders many another not at all.
Psychiatrists in the pulpits and
texts of mental hygiene in place of
prayer books would meet a hostile
world. Two thousand years of clergy
and Bible can not be supplanted in a
day. Yet problems of the mind influ
ence every phase of human endeavor
and mental hygiene is one means of
solving these problems. Let the
church be aware of this and take ad
vantage of the work of science to im
plant itself deeper in the lives of man
kind.
It is undeniable that the church to
live must keep abreast progress, and
progress and science are closely al
lied. â€”Calvin D. Wood.
