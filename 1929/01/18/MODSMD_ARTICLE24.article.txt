The White Robe. A Saint's Sum
mary. By James Branch Cabell. (New
York: Robert M. Mcßride & Co. $10.)
For some reason or another, James
Branch Cabell is especially popular with
college students and middle-aged mem
bers of female "literary" societies. Hence,
we look with interest at any new opus
from his famoufc pen.
But the latest morsel of his creating
is, comparatively speaking, a "flop" in
spite of its artistic accessories in the way
of a beautiful approximation of a me
dieval leather and oaken-board cover,
spacious lettering, and formal illustration.
It will not add a single iota to the colos
sus stride with which he arches the nar
row world of the pastiche.
"The White Robe" is nothing more
than an attenuated and considerably wat
ered account of the rise of a certain Odo
Le Noir to the pearly gates of a Cabel
lian heaven. Even the most devoted Ca
bell admirer—if he brings to a reading
of this latest book any honest memories
of "The Cream of the Jest" or "Jurgen"
—will be compelled to admit the rela
tively feeble quality of these newest
double entendres, the thinness of these
latest insinuations.
The book is a parable, probably many
parabk's, with as many different faces as
the truth usually wears. Among other
things, it shows once more that all ecsta
sies are akin, whether they be those of
saint or satanist. Again and again there
is emphasized the ease with which Odo
slips from his activities as a practicing
lycanthropist into those of a practicing
saint.
The ascent of Odo to his Elysium is
planned to buttress the beliefs of those
who hold that, after all, religion is a
matter of glandular predisposition. The
Black Odo's life had little to do with
abstract reason. In the beginning he
satisfied his unwholesome desires by
coursing the countryside as a wolf and
gloating in a variety of abominations.
Later he became a monk, taking pecu
liar pleasure in learning what was hateful
TO the Lord, solely that he migjit know
what to shun and what to punish in oth
ers. Eventually he lost his faith, if he
ever had any, but he continued to preach
redemption and an eternity of harp psalm
ody to his parishioners. For, he argued,
if people arc comforted by a falsehood, is
not the falsehood justified?
Finally the bland and middle-aged Odo
dies. He floats off to a misty jasper city
on a flimsy cloud. Here are further com
plications ; more of those queer twists
typical of Cabell allegory.
But the book, as a whole, is weak and
rather simpcry. The black things that
Odo delights in both as a sinner and a
man of God are only vaguely hinted.
There is no courage of expression. If
we had ten dollars to spend for pure
luxury, we would like to have a copy of
"The White Robe" because it would look

so nice in our bookcase. But as far as
the contents are concerned we aren't at
all interested.

THEATRES'
"The Silver Cord"—Geary.
The best current attraction in the city,
closing tomorrow night. It is a problem
drama, raising the novel question of how
far mother love has a right to influence
men's lives. Nance O'Neil, big-time star,
is excellent as the mother.
"Lombardi Ltd."—Alcazar.
Leo Carillo ends his long run tomorrow
night. Duffy has given this perennial
comedy a lavish production. Cast in
cludes Helen Ferguson of the movies and
Barbara Luddy, a half-pint pippin. Very
funny.
"This Thing Called Love"—President.
Built for laughs—a new solution to the
great domestic problem. One of the cur
rent hits in New York. San Francisco
cast is headed by Tom Moore, the movie
star. Fine entertainment.
"Gay Paree"—Curran.
Glorifying the feminine form. Charles
"Chic" Sale's remarkable rube imperson
ations compensate for the low comedy
which is all too prevalent. If you like an
evening of elaborate vaudeville, allez.
We recommend these shows in the
order listed. At the other legitimate the
atres —the Green Street advertises the
twentieth week of "Fasy for Zee Zee," a
"riskay" French farce. The Columbia is
showing an adventure picture at road
show prices, and the New Capitol is dark
for the present.
With three plays closing tomorrow
night, the new week brings an equal num
ber of new shows. The Alcazar leads
the procession, opening Sunday afternoon
with Kmma Dunn in a comedy called
"Courage." Monday night the Curran
presents "The Beggar's Opera" direct
from London, and its sister theatre—the
Geary—offers "Her Cardboard Lover."
This last-named play was originally a
starring vehicle for Jeanne Fagels, and
an amusing movie adaptation was made
recently by Marion Davies. The prin
cipal role in this production is taken by
Hazel Whitmore, leading lady for Guy
Bates Post last fall.
Two excellent talking pictures are
playing in the city this week. At the
Embassy "On Trial" is Vitaphoned with
such noted stars as Pauline Frederick,
Lois Wilson, and Bert Lytell. At the
Warfield the first Fox all-talkie makes
its appearance—"ln Old Arizona" fea
turing Fdmund Lowe.
Speaking of talkies, those who saw the
stage production of "The Royal Family"
here last fall will be interested to know
that Frederic March, who played the
John Barrymore role, has been chosen as
Gara Bow's leading man in her first all
talking picture—"The Wild Party."

"This Thing Called Love"—President.

"Gay Paree"—Curran.
Glorifying the feminine form. Charles

evening of elaborate vaudeville, allez.
We recommend these shows in the
order listed. At the other legitimate the
atres —the Green Street advertises the
twentieth week of "Fasy for Zee Zee," a
"riskay" French farce. The Columbia is
showing an adventure picture at road
show prices, and the New Capitol is dark
for the present.
With three plays closing tomorrow
night, the new week brings an equal num
ber of new shows. The Alcazar leads
the procession, opening Sunday afternoon
with Kmma Dunn in a comedy called
"Courage." Monday night the Curran
presents "The Beggar's Opera" direct
from London, and its sister theatre—the
Geary—offers "Her Cardboard Lover."
This last-named play was originally a
starring vehicle for Jeanne Fagels, and
an amusing movie adaptation was made
recently by Marion Davies. The prin
cipal role in this production is taken by
Hazel Whitmore, leading lady for Guy
Bates Post last fall.
Two excellent talking pictures are
playing in the city this week. At the
Embassy "On Trial" is Vitaphoned with
such noted stars as Pauline Frederick,
Lois Wilson, and Bert Lytell. At the
Warfield the first Fox all-talkie makes
its appearance—"ln Old Arizona" fea
turing Fdmund Lowe.
Speaking of talkies, those who saw the
stage production of "The Royal Family"
here last fall will be interested to know
that Frederic March, who played the
John Barrymore role, has been chosen as
Gara Bow's leading man in her first all

The White Robe. A Saint's Sum
mary. By James Branch Cabell. (New
York: Robert M. Mcßride & Co. $10.)
For some reason or another, James
Branch Cabell is especially popular with
college students and middle-aged mem
bers of female "literary" societies. Hence,
we look with interest at any new opus
from his famoufc pen.
But the latest morsel of his creating
is, comparatively speaking, a "flop" in
spite of its artistic accessories in the way
of a beautiful approximation of a me
dieval leather and oaken-board cover,
spacious lettering, and formal illustration.
It will not add a single iota to the colos
sus stride with which he arches the nar
row world of the pastiche.
"The White Robe" is nothing more
than an attenuated and considerably wat
ered account of the rise of a certain Odo
Le Noir to the pearly gates of a Cabel
lian heaven. Even the most devoted Ca
bell admirer—if he brings to a reading
of this latest book any honest memories
of "The Cream of the Jest" or "Jurgen"
—will be compelled to admit the rela
tively feeble quality of these newest
double entendres, the thinness of these
latest insinuations.
The book is a parable, probably many
parabk's, with as many different faces as
the truth usually wears. Among other
things, it shows once more that all ecsta
sies are akin, whether they be those of
saint or satanist. Again and again there
is emphasized the ease with which Odo
slips from his activities as a practicing
lycanthropist into those of a practicing
saint.
The ascent of Odo to his Elysium is
planned to buttress the beliefs of those
who hold that, after all, religion is a
matter of glandular predisposition. The
Black Odo's life had little to do with
abstract reason. In the beginning he
satisfied his unwholesome desires by
coursing the countryside as a wolf and
gloating in a variety of abominations.
Later he became a monk, taking pecu
liar pleasure in learning what was hateful
TO the Lord, solely that he migjit know
what to shun and what to punish in oth
ers. Eventually he lost his faith, if he
ever had any, but he continued to preach
redemption and an eternity of harp psalm
ody to his parishioners. For, he argued,
if people arc comforted by a falsehood, is
not the falsehood justified?
Finally the bland and middle-aged Odo
dies. He floats off to a misty jasper city
on a flimsy cloud. Here are further com
plications ; more of those queer twists
typical of Cabell allegory.
But the book, as a whole, is weak and
rather simpcry. The black things that
Odo delights in both as a sinner and a
man of God are only vaguely hinted.
There is no courage of expression. If
we had ten dollars to spend for pure
luxury, we would like to have a copy of
"The White Robe" because it would look

so nice in our bookcase. But as far as
the contents are concerned we aren't at
all interested.

things, it shows once more that all ecsta
sies are akin, whether they be those of
saint or satanist. Again and again there
is emphasized the ease with which Odo
slips from his activities as a practicing
lycanthropist into those of a practicing
saint.
The ascent of Odo to his Elysium is
planned to buttress the beliefs of those
who hold that, after all, religion is a
matter of glandular predisposition. The
Black Odo's life had little to do with
abstract reason. In the beginning he
satisfied his unwholesome desires by
coursing the countryside as a wolf and
gloating in a variety of abominations.
Later he became a monk, taking pecu
liar pleasure in learning what was hateful
TO the Lord, solely that he migjit know
what to shun and what to punish in oth
ers. Eventually he lost his faith, if he
ever had any, but he continued to preach
redemption and an eternity of harp psalm
ody to his parishioners. For, he argued,
if people arc comforted by a falsehood, is
not the falsehood justified?
Finally the bland and middle-aged Odo
dies. He floats off to a misty jasper city
on a flimsy cloud. Here are further com
plications ; more of those queer twists
typical of Cabell allegory.
But the book, as a whole, is weak and
rather simpcry. The black things that
Odo delights in both as a sinner and a
man of God are only vaguely hinted.
There is no courage of expression. If
we had ten dollars to spend for pure
luxury, we would like to have a copy of
"The White Robe" because it would look

so nice in our bookcase. But as far as
the contents are concerned we aren't at
all interested.

THEATRES'
"The Silver Cord"—Geary.
The best current attraction in the city,
closing tomorrow night. It is a problem
drama, raising the novel question of how
far mother love has a right to influence
men's lives. Nance O'Neil, big-time star,
is excellent as the mother.
"Lombardi Ltd."—Alcazar.
Leo Carillo ends his long run tomorrow
night. Duffy has given this perennial
comedy a lavish production. Cast in
cludes Helen Ferguson of the movies and
Barbara Luddy, a half-pint pippin. Very
funny.
"This Thing Called Love"—President.
Built for laughs—a new solution to the
great domestic problem. One of the cur
rent hits in New York. San Francisco
cast is headed by Tom Moore, the movie
star. Fine entertainment.
"Gay Paree"—Curran.
Glorifying the feminine form. Charles
"Chic" Sale's remarkable rube imperson
ations compensate for the low comedy
which is all too prevalent. If you like an
evening of elaborate vaudeville, allez.
We recommend these shows in the
order listed. At the other legitimate the
atres —the Green Street advertises the
twentieth week of "Fasy for Zee Zee," a
"riskay" French farce. The Columbia is
showing an adventure picture at road
show prices, and the New Capitol is dark
for the present.
With three plays closing tomorrow
night, the new week brings an equal num
ber of new shows. The Alcazar leads
the procession, opening Sunday afternoon
with Kmma Dunn in a comedy called
"Courage." Monday night the Curran
presents "The Beggar's Opera" direct
from London, and its sister theatre—the
Geary—offers "Her Cardboard Lover."
This last-named play was originally a
starring vehicle for Jeanne Fagels, and
an amusing movie adaptation was made
recently by Marion Davies. The prin
cipal role in this production is taken by
Hazel Whitmore, leading lady for Guy
Bates Post last fall.
Two excellent talking pictures are
playing in the city this week. At the
Embassy "On Trial" is Vitaphoned with
such noted stars as Pauline Frederick,
Lois Wilson, and Bert Lytell. At the
Warfield the first Fox all-talkie makes
its appearance—"ln Old Arizona" fea
turing Fdmund Lowe.
Speaking of talkies, those who saw the
stage production of "The Royal Family"
here last fall will be interested to know
that Frederic March, who played the
John Barrymore role, has been chosen as
Gara Bow's leading man in her first all
talking picture—"The Wild Party."

The White Robe. A Saint's Sum
mary. By James Branch Cabell. (New
York: Robert M. Mcßride & Co. $10.)
For some reason or another, James
Branch Cabell is especially popular with
college students and middle-aged mem
bers of female "literary" societies. Hence,
we look with interest at any new opus
from his famoufc pen.
But the latest morsel of his creating
is, comparatively speaking, a "flop" in
spite of its artistic accessories in the way
of a beautiful approximation of a me
dieval leather and oaken-board cover,
spacious lettering, and formal illustration.
It will not add a single iota to the colos
sus stride with which he arches the nar
row world of the pastiche.
"The White Robe" is nothing more
than an attenuated and considerably wat
ered account of the rise of a certain Odo
Le Noir to the pearly gates of a Cabel
lian heaven. Even the most devoted Ca
bell admirer—if he brings to a reading
of this latest book any honest memories
of "The Cream of the Jest" or "Jurgen"
—will be compelled to admit the rela
tively feeble quality of these newest
double entendres, the thinness of these
latest insinuations.
The book is a parable, probably many
parabk's, with as many different faces as
the truth usually wears. Among other
things, it shows once more that all ecsta
sies are akin, whether they be those of
saint or satanist. Again and again there
is emphasized the ease with which Odo

starring vehicle for Jeanne Fagels, and
an amusing movie adaptation was made
recently by Marion Davies. The prin
cipal role in this production is taken by
Hazel Whitmore, leading lady for Guy
Bates Post last fall.
Two excellent talking pictures are
playing in the city this week. At the
Embassy "On Trial" is Vitaphoned with
such noted stars as Pauline Frederick,
Lois Wilson, and Bert Lytell. At the
Warfield the first Fox all-talkie makes
its appearance—"ln Old Arizona" fea
turing Fdmund Lowe.
Speaking of talkies, those who saw the
stage production of "The Royal Family"
here last fall will be interested to know
that Frederic March, who played the
John Barrymore role, has been chosen as
Gara Bow's leading man in her first all
talking picture—"The Wild Party."
