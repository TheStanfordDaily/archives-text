# Curry Bill Is Favored By House Military Committee
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 17 (/P).—
The House Military Affairs Committee
today favorably reported the Curry bill
to authorize the Secretary of War to
grant a right of way to the Southern
Pacific Railroad Company across the
Benicia Arsenal military reservation in
California.

Wilbur has considered putting a bit of
that latest million dollars into sonic build
ings for non-Row men, graduate women,
and for all of the Five Hundred.
Maxine Gushing

The Editor, Sir:
Now that Roble has emerged from the
social quarantine that goes with rushing
and the way is open at last for genuinely
friendly relations between the hall and
the Row, it behooves those men who sin
cerely wish to promote those friendly
relations, to stop accentuating the situa
tion by calling Roble "the Bastile." If
Roblc is a prison it is the attitude of the
men that makes it one. Agitation on
their part for abolition of sororities only
stirs up unnecessary ill-feeling, and hurts
rather than helps the girls whom they
are trying to champion. The houses—
though conceivably they might some day
cease to exist—are apparently here to
stay a good while longer. In the mean
while, for those men who arc interested,
there is a readier remedy at hand :
If you like a girl who lives in Roble,
don't be afraid to show it. If you resent
her disappointment at not going Row,
don't expose her broken heart in a Bull
Session. Ignore her tears and ask her to
the Mark Hopkins.
