WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 17 (/P).—
Throwing open the woods schedule of the
tariff act for inspection, the House ways
and means committee today received a
variety of pleas from lumber interests
for protection from what they termed
ruinous foreign competition.
Lumber now enters the United States
duty free, and witnesses testified that this
was causing higher prices to American
consumers because of increasingly long
hauls from foreign forests.
