### 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Jan. 17. (/P)
â€”The mysterious death of an 18-year
old girl, Helen Haskew, an inmate of
the New Mexico Girls' Welfare Home,
a state institution, today became sub
ject of an official inquiry by a legis
lative committee headed by Governor
R. C. "Dick" Dillon.
Closely following an announcement
by Prosecutor Lujan of Albuquerque,
that charges would be filed in connec
tion with the girl's sudden death, the
Chief Executive opened an investiga
tion at the institution and heard the
testimony of Faye Graves, another
girl inmate. Miss Graves testified that
"twilight sleep" had been adminis
tered to her eight times as far back
a? last October. Prosecutor Lujan
said he was not prepared to disclose
the nature of charges he expected to
file in the case against Superinten
dent Bertha Lips and Dr. Evelyn
Frisbie, who are alleged to have ad
ministered the "twilight sleep."
At the coroner's inquest yesterday
a verdict was returned declaring that
Miss Haskew came to her death from
administration of the sedative, com
bined with lack of water in her sys
tem. Testimony at the inquest, showed
Miss Haskew and five other girls had
been placed on a bread and water diet
last Friday when they were recap
tured soon after having run away
from the institution.
