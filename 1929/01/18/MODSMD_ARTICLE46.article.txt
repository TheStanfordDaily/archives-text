# PROCEEDINGS OF MOOT COURT CASES CHANGED
## 
### 
The second round of arguments in
the Moot Court competition will initi
ate several changes from the proce
dure of the cases held last quarter,
according to John Hamlyn, member
of the Moot Court board. All cases
will be of the type held in superior
courts, and will be original cases, not
appellate, as were those argued last
quarter. Instead of outside lawyers
and judges trying the cases, all judges
will be professors of the Law School.

The first arguments in the second
round will be held Tuesday night.
Draper and Vincenti meet Linneman
and Newton in Room 12 at 7 o'clock
before Professor C. B. Whittier, and
Hamlyn and Hiatt will oppose Call
and Armour in Room 10 at 8 o'clock
before Professor Stanley Morrison.
The public is invited to attend the
arguments.
