## 
### 
BERKELEY, Jan. 17. (/P)â€”To dis
prove charges that he was unable to
earn $26.50 he claimed as wages from
a painter, Estes H. Westover, 81, to
day turned a few handsprings in po
lice court here, leaped upon a desk,
and did a few other acrobatic stunts.
The display continued until stopped
by a court bailiff. Decision on the
claim was reserved, the court saying
proof was needed that Westover can
climb a ladder and paint, which his
former employer denied. The court
will personally inspect the premises
where the old man said he worked.
