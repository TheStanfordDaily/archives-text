## 
### 
Rainy weather, in spite of its many
disadvantages, has at least one ad
vantage, as any visitor to the shores
of Stanford's part-time lake in the
last few days might have noticed.
Lagunita is filling up.

It will soon be time to drag that
old canoe out of its winter hibernat
ing place and give it its annual coat
of paint and varnish. It won't be
long now before the time will come
to get the old bathing and boating
paraphernalia out of hock.

The dam at Searsville has been
full for several weeks, but it has not
been till recently that any great
amount of water has begun to over
flow and to run down the creek into
Lagunita. According to Roy H. Button,
supervisor of buildings and grounds,
the lake is three or four weeks behind
its schedule of last year, but at the
present rate will soon be full enough
for its customary usage.
