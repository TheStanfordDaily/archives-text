# FACULTY NINE LOSES HECTIC DIAMOND TILT
## Varsity Scores Four Runs in Sixth Period to Win by Count of 9 to 6 
### 
A four-run rally in the sixth inning j
enabled the varsity baseball team to score
a win over the faculty nine by count of
9 to 6. Temple ton walked Sampson to
start the inning, and Hardy singled him
on to second. Johnson then singled to
right, scoring Sampson and putting Har
dy on third. Nevers replaced Templeton,
and Cook greeted the new chueker with
a clean bingle to right field, scoring Har
dy. Two infield hits filled the bases, and
Nevers walked the next two men to force
in the winning runs. Hunken forced
McGrath at second to end the inning.
"Dink" Templeton, who started in the
box for the faculty, fore a pair of plaid
plus fours and red tie, sweater, and sox
to match, while Ed Walker in right field
was clothed in a football uniform. Tem
pleton's unusual makeup didn't interfere
with his pitching, however, as he threw j
winning ball for the first four innings, i
Too many cigarettes between the rounds i
are attributed to have been the cause of
his blowing up in the sixth.
Faculty Bunch Hits
Ross started the game with a clean hit,!
and was sacrificed to second by Fisher.
Zweirline was hit by a pitched ball and
Nevers fanned. Dyer came through with
a Texas Leaguer to score Ross, but j
Davis fell a victim to Taylor's curves to [
end the scoring for the first inning. The j
faculty tallied again in the second when j
Walker made a single, went to second on j
an error, and scored on a fielder's choice. |
Walker just escaped being put out at the (
plate by taking the ball on the back of j
I his neck, but the blow didn't seem to
affect him any. Two hits, a wild pitch,
a walk, and an error gave four more runs
to the faculty before the third out was
1 chalked up.
j The varsity scored two runs in their
1 half of the second inning, when Cook
| tripled, Wilton was walked and stole sec
ond, and both scored on Wright's single.
| Again in the seventh the Cards shoved
' over two more runs on four singles in a
row by Sampson, Johnson, Cook, and
Smalling. The final tally was made in
the eighth when Davis gut a bingle, went
to third on Walker's error, and tallied
on a single by Sampson.
Rally Fails
The faculty rallied in the last inning,
but fell short by three runs. Busch got
to first on an error by McGrath and was
sacrificed to second by Templeton. He
scored from second on a single by Ross,
' but the next two men made infield outs.
! The game was called at the end of the
j eighth because of darkness.
The varsity showed up well in the first
game of the season, and demonstrated
more batting power than has been seen
around here for some time. Smalling
i looked good in the pitcher's box and
! should liave a good season. The fielding
| and haserunning was pretty ragged, but
; should improve with a little more prac
j tice. This is the first time that a varsity
j team has ever trimmed the faculty, but
j they did that yesterday in spite of the
I fact that over half of the faculty team
!
were ringers.
Umpire Takes Beating
Wallace Denny, as umpire, took a lot
of unnecessary comment from the teach
! ers in yesterday's contest. In the third
inning, when Templeton was pretty well
fagged out from smoking two cigarettes,
Denny couldn't seem to call them right
for the pitcher, but he managed to
weather the gripe-fest.
