The highest that man lias ever ascend
ed is 44,000 feet, but the man who went
up that unbelievable distance from the
earth never came down alive! His name
was Captain H. C. Gray, of the United
States air service, and on November 4,
1927, he made a flight of more than eight
and one-half miles up from Scott Field,
Illinois, in a balloon, which was found
near Sparta, Tennessee, the next day with
the army officer's body in it. Death was
attributed to a broken connection with
the oxygen tank. In May of the same
year, Captain Gray was credited with a
balloon flight of 42,470 feet, which stands

as the official record.
The official altitude record for a plane i
varies, according to where you look for j
it. Some say it is only 38,792 feet, made
by Renato Donati, the Italian, in Decern- j
her, 1927; while others give the palm to
Lieutenant Johnny Macready, of the Uni
ted States Army, who went up 40,800 feet
at Dayton, Ohio, in 1921. But the rec- j
ords show that Jean Callizo, of Paris, as-1
cended to a height of 13,000 meters (42,-:
651 feet) on August 30, 1927.
Next comes mountain climbing. Lieu
tenant-Colonel E. F. Norton and T. H.
Somervell of the Britist Mount Everest

expedition, climbed up to within 1,000:
feet of the top in 1924, reaching approxi
mately 28,100 feet. General C. Geoffrey
Bruce and G. I. Finch (also Britishers)
climbed to a height of 27,500 in 1922.
The record previous to then was held by
the Duke of Abruzzi at 24,600 feet. G. L.
Mallory and A. C. Irvine, of the 1924
British expedition, lost their lives some- |
where above 27,000 feet in another effort
to conquer the "Goddess Mother of the
World," Mt. Everest, in 1924.
Some months ago J. R. Hamilton sent
in some dope on Ed Haley, late of Wil
liams College, suggesting that I do a car

toon on him as "The Highest Champ,"
since he had won the Swiss golf title in
1927. But a little research among atlases,
timetables, and encyclopedias revealed the
fact that Samaden, where Mr. Haley
won his championship, is many feet near
er sea level than numerous other golf
courses where tournaments are held. At
Colorado Springs, Colorado, where Jim
my Gullane once drove 470 yards, the
altitude is .5,975, 305 feet higher than
Samaden. Gallup, Raton, and Santa Fe,
all in New Mexico, have golf courses
over the 6,500- foot level, as has Flag
staff, Arizona.
