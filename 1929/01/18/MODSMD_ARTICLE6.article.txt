tory is to be the topic of interest.

! present.
Thirty-eight years ago, on the
recommendation of Dr. Andrew D.
White, the president of Cornell, Gov
ernor Stanford chose Dr. Jordan to 1
become the first president of the Uni-j
versity. From that time until he be- '
j came chancellor emeritus in 1916, he ;
| was responsible for the University's
rise to prominence. Dr. Jordan is
world-known as a writer, educator,
and scientist, and has continued his
activities in these directions since
liis retirement. He is a recognized
authority on biology, economics, gen-
I etics, and histories of international
ism. "The Days of a Man," Dr. Jor
dan's autobiography, and many other
books by him on science are well
| known.
Particularly is he known in connec
tion with his work on the problem of i
world peace. The Herman prize for a !
plan on this subject went to Dr. Jor
dan. He was Chief Director of the
; World's Peace Foundation from 1010
to 1914, and president of the World's |
Peace Congress in 1915.
Dr. Jordan's childhood was spent
in the little village of Gainsville, New
York. On his father's farm he mani
fested more interest in watching the
wild life, plant and animal, than in
carrying out the duties falling to a
farmer's son. In 1872 he received his
master's degree from Cornell Univer
sity, and later served there as pro
fessor of botany. At the University
of Indiana he was professor of
zoology, and then became president
| of that institution,
