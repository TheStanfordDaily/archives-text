# CARD YEARLINGS FACE RICHMOND QUINTET TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's yearling basketball team,
Btill smarting from their 31 to 29 de
feat at the hands of the Santa Clara
babes last Tuesday, will be given
their first chance to redeem them
selves tonight when they clash with
the Richmond High School team at
7:15 o'clock in the Cardinal Pavilion.
Although nothing is known of the
ability of the visitors, the Card
youngsters should have an easy time
handing them a first-class beating,
particularly since Jim Shrader, for
mer Los Angeles all-city forward, will
be back on the job. Shrader has been
laid up for the past week and a half
with an injured ankle and only played
a few minutes in the Santa Clara
fracas.
Coach Bradshaw is going to have a
hard time deciding between his three
star forwards, Ray, Kelly, and Shra
der, although Doub is certain to start
at center, with ltintala and Baker in
the guard positions.
With the Santa Clara game a thing
of the past, the babes' principal com
petition before the California serieH
has been narrowed down to the San
Mateo Junior College and Stockton
High School, both of whom are ex
pected to put strong teams on the
floor.
