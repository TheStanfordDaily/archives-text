# EXPEDITION TO SEARCH FOR LOST INDIAN POSSE
## 
### 
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Jan. 17 (JP). â€” A
rescue expedition to search for the band
of citizens which Francisco Fimbres led
into the mountainous country near here
to wipe out a gang of marauding Apache
Indians, today was being organized in
the province of Bacerac in the Mexican
state of Sonora.
Apprehension over the fate of the
punitive expedition became pronounced
when word of the success of the vigi
lantes' search failed to reach here. Presi
dent Loreta of Agua Prieta, in the state
of Sonora, said that President Acuna of
Bacerac province offered today to send
a detachment of troops and Indian trail
ers into the mountains to learn of the
expedition's fate. President Acuna vol
unteered to lead the rescue party, which
would include twelve members of the
Mexican border patrol.
