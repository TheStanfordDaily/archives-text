# DR. JORDAN CLAIMS AMERICA'S RATIFICATION OF KELLOGG PEACE PACT WAS GREAT ACHIEVEMENT
## 
### WILLIAM GRACE 
"The ratification of the Kellogg
Peace Pact by the United States
Senate was one of the greatest
things which has happened," said Dr.
David Starr Jordan at his home yes
terday, reviewing events at the ap
proach of his seventy-eighth birth
day.
"This pact is being talked of all
over the world, and that is where the
power of its good lies. In 1913 this
move would have made a big hole in
the war propaganda. Now there are
a thousand people talking peace
where there was only one a decade
ago. I felt sure that the Senate
would pass on it.
"I am certain that the ratification
of this pact will not be considered a
change in our attitude by European
nations. The most intelligent people
across the sea understand that differ
ent elements exist in a big country
like this, and make allowances for
it. Certain classes and groups of
people want war; but never all the
people.
When asked if the pact was not a
"back door entry to the League of
Nations," Dr. Jordan said: "No.
Right now the back door to the.
League is like the front door—al
ways open. If we want to go into
the League, we can go up the front
steps. We did not join the League
of Nations because the Treaty of
Versailles was attached to it, and
that was a most unfair document.
"The honor system is not based
on the right principle," Dr. Jordan
stated. "A professor should not give

an examination in which cheating is
I possible. I don't think you can make students testify against each other. It is not human nature. Men and women who will
1 cheat do not belong here. The sooner they are weeded out, the better. It was my policy not to punish such persons, but to
send them home.
"I am getting what is reckoned to be a pretty old man," he concluded. Thirty-eight years ago I was brought here by
Governor Stanford, a wise and forcible man, to make a real university; a university to be considered less by numbers or
athletics than by its intelligent and forceful students—by their ability to undertake real work. Herbert Hoover is an ex
ample of the type of man we had in mind to develop. Governor Stanford's idea in founding the University was to begin
where the University of California left off. The business and research departments are the type of thing we planned to
i develop.
"A university cannot be a place where students just whoop it up when called upon. This University will die if it is con
tented with teaching all kinds of people." Dr. Jordan had the Lower Division in mind when he made this statement. "The
ideals of university training are not so that students can pass examinations. We want to train men to work out additional
i truths and to have opinions of their own. Men and women are not really educated until they have opinions of their own.
"Our aim when coming to Stanford was to start right, and I think we did. As for the future, I have great faith in the
; ultimate fate of the student body here. In every class I have seen someone rise to national or international prominence as
Hoover has done."

"I am getting what is reckoned to be a pretty old man," he concluded. Thirty-eight years ago I was brought here by
Governor Stanford, a wise and forcible man, to make a real university; a university to be considered less by numbers or
athletics than by its intelligent and forceful students—by their ability to undertake real work. Herbert Hoover is an ex
ample of the type of man we had in mind to develop. Governor Stanford's idea in founding the University was to begin
where the University of California left off. The business and research departments are the type of thing we planned to
i develop.
"A university cannot be a place where students just whoop it up when called upon. This University will die if it is con
tented with teaching all kinds of people." Dr. Jordan had the Lower Division in mind when he made this statement. "The
ideals of university training are not so that students can pass examinations. We want to train men to work out additional
i truths and to have opinions of their own. Men and women are not really educated until they have opinions of their own.
"Our aim when coming to Stanford was to start right, and I think we did. As for the future, I have great faith in the
; ultimate fate of the student body here. In every class I have seen someone rise to national or international prominence as
Hoover has done."

"The ratification of the Kellogg
Peace Pact by the United States
Senate was one of the greatest
things which has happened," said Dr.
David Starr Jordan at his home yes
terday, reviewing events at the ap
proach of his seventy-eighth birth
day.
"This pact is being talked of all
over the world, and that is where the
power of its good lies. In 1913 this
move would have made a big hole in
the war propaganda. Now there are
a thousand people talking peace
where there was only one a decade
ago. I felt sure that the Senate
would pass on it.
"I am certain that the ratification
of this pact will not be considered a
change in our attitude by European
nations. The most intelligent people
across the sea understand that differ
ent elements exist in a big country
like this, and make allowances for
it. Certain classes and groups of
people want war; but never all the
people.
When asked if the pact was not a
"back door entry to the League of
Nations," Dr. Jordan said: "No.
Right now the back door to the.
League is like the front door—al
ways open. If we want to go into
the League, we can go up the front
steps. We did not join the League
of Nations because the Treaty of
Versailles was attached to it, and
that was a most unfair document.
"The honor system is not based
on the right principle," Dr. Jordan
stated. "A professor should not give

an examination in which cheating is
I possible. I don't think you can make students testify against each other. It is not human nature. Men and women who will
1 cheat do not belong here. The sooner they are weeded out, the better. It was my policy not to punish such persons, but to
send them home.
