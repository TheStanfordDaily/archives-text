DETROIT, Jan. 17. (>P)—Sumner C.
Sleeper, chief of the customs border
patrol here, asserted today when in
formed he had been ordered to a
Florida post, that the "wide open"
activities of rum runners on the De
troit liver were a direct result of in
efficient policies in Washington.
He told Ernest W. Camp, national
commissioner of customs, he would
resign rather than accept a transfer
with the implication that an alleged
collapse of prohibition activities here
was due to local inefficiency.
"Under present circumst<uices," he
said, "it is virtually impossible to
stop rum-running on the Detroit
river." He charged that men employed
in the border patrol were not in sym
pathy with prohibition and so were
easily susceptible to graft.
