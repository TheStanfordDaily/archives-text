PARIS, Jan. 17 (IP).—EI Ouafi, the I,
little French Arab winner of the Olym- ] j
pic marathon, who is engaged in a pro- i <
fessional running tour in America, writes j.
that he is lonelier in America than in the ■
Moroccan desert. The reason is that so J
few Americans speak his language.
"I haven't spoken fifty words in Arabic j
since arriving here," he wrote to a for
mer fellow worker in the automobile
plant at Levallois.
Concerning his opponent in his profes
sional races, he wrote: "Wray is a good
runner for 25 kilometers (a little over
15 miles) but I can beat him from 40
kilometers up. I should like to run him
100 kilometers (more than 60 milts)."
