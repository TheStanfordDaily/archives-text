BELGRADE, Jugoslavia, Jan. 17. (/P)
â€” Indications that King Alexander is
already planning an end of the dic
tatorship became apparent today. The

Marinkovitch, foreign minister, draw
up a new constitution to replace the
present military decrees as the minis
ter returns from his convalescence in
Switzerland.
