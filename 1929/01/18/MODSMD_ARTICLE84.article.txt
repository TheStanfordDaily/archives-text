# CARD TRACK PROSPECTS APPEAR BRIGHT
## Eighteen Lettermen From Last Year's Champion Track, Field Team Return for Third IC.4-A. Victory 
### 
With eighteen lettermen from last . I
year's championship track and field
team available, Coach "Dink" Temple- ,
ton can look forward with consider
able optimism to another great track
year for Stanford and possibly a vie- !
tory in the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet for the
third consecutive year.
The preeminence of the Cardinal
track and field men in the realm of
college athletics was undisputed last
year. In the 1.C.4-A. meet at Boston, ;
Stanford met and overwhelmed the i
pick of college track men from all
parts of the United States, winning I
the meet with 43 points, 18 more than !i
their nearest opponent, Yale. Against
the Middle-Western colleges in the j
N.C.A.A. meet in Chicago some weeks !
later the Sons of the Stanford Red '
scored a total of 72 points, more than |
double the number of points made by
the second-place team.
Graduation Hits Squad
Graduation removed eight consist- J
ent point-winners, including Captain
Emerson Spencer, holder of the :
world's record of 47 seconds in the
400-meter run, and Bob King, victor '
in the high jump in the 1928 Olympic I
Games, from the Stanford squad. The ;
others lost by graduation were Kim
Dyer, one of the Pacific Coast's great- J
est broad-jumpers; Clarence West, !
hurdler par-excellent; Henry Coe, !
two-miler; Tom Joaquin, javelin
thrower; Tom McGuire, half-miler;
and Jack Bullis, hurdler. Herbert
Fleishhacker, weight man', is not
registered this quarter.
The absence of King in the high
jump will probably be felt the most.
Austin of last year's freshman team
is the best possibility in this event.
He can do better than six feet as a
rule, but to replace King with his
regular 6 ft. 4 or 5 in. performances
is a pretty big order to fill.
Nichols Should Star
Captain Ross Nichols, assisted by
Don Nelson of last year's varsity, and
Dyer and Smith of the 192S freshman

, team, will look after the Cardinal in
terests in the hurdle events and with
suitable meet conditions should turn
in some record breaking perfor
| mances.

A1 Forster, Leo Kibby, Bill Sparling,

Morrison, Alex McKinnon, Wait Huls
man, Dick French, Cedric Madison,
Stewart Way, Jack Dales, Bob Syer,
and John Lauritzen completing the
list of returning lettermen, "Dink"
I should have little to worry about.
I This afternoon at 4 o'cloek one oC
I the weekly practice meets will be
! held.
