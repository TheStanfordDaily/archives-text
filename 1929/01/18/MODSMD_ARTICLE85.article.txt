# MUSSOLINI TELLS ALUMNI TO HELP UNIVERSITY FUNDS
## Government Decrees Every Degree Holder Must Pay Small Sum 
### 
HOME, Jan. 17. (/P) â€”American col
lege presidents and treasurers of uni
versity alumni funds can look with
euvy on t'heir Italian counterparts.
The government has decreed that
every holder of an Italian university
degree, who is still exercising the
profession to which that degree ad
mits him, must fill out a form telling
all about himself and forward it to
liis alma mater accompanied by $1.30.
If any parsimonious old graduates
refuse to comply they will be fined.
It is planned to make these contribu
tions regular annual obligations as
long an graduates remain in their pro
fessions, although by the payment of
approximately $10.50 he may become
a "life supporting member."
The sums required may seem small
to American* university officials, who
usually talk with alumni in terms of
millions for the construction of sta
diums, dormitories,
chapels. Hut in Italy all the universi
ties, save a few Catholic institutions,
are affairs of state. They are sup
ported by the taxpayers and by a few
donations that date from many cen
turies.
