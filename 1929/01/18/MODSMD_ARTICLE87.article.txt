### 
BOISE, Ida., Jan. 17 (/P). —A tax on
bottle caps was suggested today .by Sena
tor Charles F. Baker of Custer County
as a new source of revenue to relieve
real estate of some of its tax burden.
Senator Baker said a tax of one-half
cent on each bottle cap put into use
"would only increase the price of a case
of soda pop six cents —and think of the
immense amount of revenue that would
be brought in."
