# MILES DISCOVERS MAN MAY SLEEP WITH EYES OPEN
## 
### 
Sleeping with your eyes open! Al
though probably no one has ever called
your attention to the facj:, there is not a
small chance that at some time or other
you went to sleep with your eyes open.
This remarkable discovery was an
nounced by Professor Miles, of the psy
chology department.
Originally Professor Miles experi
mented to determine the exact moment
when sleep begins. Subjects were asked
to look from right to left and back be
tween two points 40 degrees apart. These
alternations were timed with a metro
nome to a speed of about one a second.
When the rays of an arc lamp were pro
jected against the eye, they were re
flected to a moving photographic plate,
upon which was recorded each minute
move of the eyeball. This thin pencil of
light traveled regularly from left to right
for hours.
At one time, after two hours of regu
lar oscillation, instead of traveling to the
right, stopping, moving to the left, stop
ping, and returning to the right, the mov
ing finger of light swayed without halt
ing for a few seconds. Then it stopped,
and disappeared.
Analysis of the photographic plates
leads to the conclusion that the brain
went to sleep and muscular control was
lost, but that the eyes remained open for
a few seconds longer.
While we normally induce sleep by
closing our eyes, according to Professor
Miles, in cases of intense mental effort,
when we try at all costs to remain awake,
we shut our eyes after falling asleep.
Detailed descriptions and photographic
diagrams of the experiment, which it is
believed is the first of its kind, will be
published in an early issue of the Scien
tific American.
