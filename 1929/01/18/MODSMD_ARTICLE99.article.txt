### 
FREDERICK, Okla., Jan. 17. (/P)â€”
Granting that Asia was the cradle of
man, southwest Oklahoma asserts it
provided his first toddling ground.
Out of a gravel pit near here have
come what are declared by scientists
to be unmistakable human artifacts.
These have been found in strata de
clared by geologists to belong to the
Pleistocene age, or between 500,000
and 750,000 years old.
Pit In Daily Use
The pit, although a veritable treas
ury of paleontological and geological
specimens, is in daiy commercial use.
It ig owned by A. H. Holloman, Fred
erick contractor and real estate
dealer.
The most conclusive proofs of human
habitation found are arrowheads, pro
nounced by Harold J. Cook, curator
of the Colorado Museum of Natural
History, as undoubtedly manufactured
by man. In addition, numerous stones
suggesting Uie heads of war clubs,
spears and hammers; pottery trays
and vessels, and clay tablets suggest
ing crude attempts at writing, have
been unearthed.
Carvings Found
Among the most interesting are
two clay tablets. On one is carved an
unmistakable fish; on the other the
form of a man.
Two small objects closely resem
bling the hand and foot of an infant
were found close together. The
fingers and toes are well-defined.
