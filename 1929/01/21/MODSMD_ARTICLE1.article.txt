# INCREASE IN DRY ENFORCEMENT IS PLEA OF CHIEFS
## Presidential Commission May Use Quarter Million Fund For Study of Prohibition Senate Will Vote Tomorrow On Nomination of Ray West As Secretary of Interior 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20. (/P)â€” Pub
lic appeals by three prominent Dry
leaders for the proposed $25,000,000
increase for prohibition enforcement
has added a new complication to this
controversy in the Senate and new
zest in the already protracted debate
is anticipated.
Before getting to the Prohibition
question again, however, the Senate
will vote tomorrow afternoon at 2:30
o'clock on the nomination of Roy O.
West, of Chicago, as Secretary of the
Interior.
All of this is adding to the tangled
Senate situation which daily is grow
ing more foreboding for the long
pending cruiser construction bill. The
naval measure is the last of the im
portant propositions of President
Coolidge still unacted upon and ad
ministration leaders are beginning to
show some concern over its outlook.
Senator Sheppard, Democrat, Texas,
the father of the Eighteenth Amend
ment, threw new fuel on the Prohibi
tion fire yesterday when he read into
the record an attack against the posi
tion taken by Secretary Mellon that
the $25,000,000 increase for dry en
forcement In an amendment to the
first deficiency appropriation bill was
inappropriate at this time.
The attack was made by Bishop
James Cannon and Eugene L. Craw
ford, chairman and secretary, respec
tively, of the Board of Temperance
and Social Service of the Methodist
Episcopal Church South, and by
Bishop Thomas Nicholson, president
of the Anti-Saloon League.
Regardless of the vote on the
$25,000,000 Prohibition increase .lead
ers believe at least that the proposal
of Senator Glass, Democrat, Virginia,
lor appropriation of $250,000 to be
used by a Presidential commission in
a study of Prohibition will be adopted.
President-elect Hoover has indi
cated very clearly that he intends to
order such an investigation and this
$250,000 is intended to meet the ex
penses of the proposed commission.
