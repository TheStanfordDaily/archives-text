# CARD TRACKMEN IMPROVE MARKS IN SECOND MEET
## 
### 
Stanford trackmen again turned in
a group of creditable performances in
their regular practice meet last Fri
day, proving that they are getting .
into shape for their early-season I
meets. Almost every mark made a
week ago was lowered yesterday.
John Morrison, '30, of last year's
varsity, raced around the track in
51 s. to win the quarter-mile, turning
in the best time of the day. Morrison,
who backed up Captain Bud Spencer
with a second or third in almost
every meet last year, has done close
to 48 s. and should consistently finish
under 50 s. this year. Schove, '31, and
Hay, '32, were second and third in
the 440 Friday.
Edmonds Shines
Ward Edmonds, '29, varsity pole
vaulter for two years, seems to have
definitely decided to take up high
hurdling as a sideline. Friday he
again won the high stick event, finish
ing ahead of Podge Smith and Cap
lain Ross Nichols in the time of :
15 4-5 s. Edmonds then went over to j
the pole vaulting pit and cleared the |
bar at 12 ft. C in. Berry, junior col- |
lege transfer, was second at 12 ft., j
and Johns, '32, third at 11 ft.
Loofbourow, '29, lowered his last j
week's mark of 10 m. 17 2-5 s. to 10m. j
12 4-5 s. Inasmuch as Brown, '31, was ,
not running, Loofbourow had little
competition.
Kibby Tosses Spear
In the javelin Kibby tossed the
spear 177 ft., an excellent throw for ,
this time of year. Perelli-Minetti, '31, !
was second with 158 ft. 11% in. and I
Welch, '32, third with 143 ft. 1 in.
Eric Krenz, Stockton giant of
Olympic Games fame, put the shot 4G
ft. 4in- and hurled the discus 133
it. for firsts in both events. Krenz
i was a double winner in almost every
meet last, year and should repeat this
| year.

it. for firsts in both events. Krenz
i was a double winner in almost every
meet last, year and should repeat this
| year.
Stanford trackmen again turned in
a group of creditable performances in
their regular practice meet last Fri
day, proving that they are getting .
into shape for their early-season I
meets. Almost every mark made a
week ago was lowered yesterday.
John Morrison, '30, of last year's
varsity, raced around the track in
51 s. to win the quarter-mile, turning
in the best time of the day. Morrison,
who backed up Captain Bud Spencer
with a second or third in almost
every meet last year, has done close
to 48 s. and should consistently finish
under 50 s. this year. Schove, '31, and
Hay, '32, were second and third in
the 440 Friday.
Edmonds Shines
Ward Edmonds, '29, varsity pole
vaulter for two years, seems to have
definitely decided to take up high
hurdling as a sideline. Friday he
again won the high stick event, finish
ing ahead of Podge Smith and Cap
lain Ross Nichols in the time of :
15 4-5 s. Edmonds then went over to j
the pole vaulting pit and cleared the |
bar at 12 ft. C in. Berry, junior col- |
lege transfer, was second at 12 ft., j
and Johns, '32, third at 11 ft.
Loofbourow, '29, lowered his last j
week's mark of 10 m. 17 2-5 s. to 10m. j
12 4-5 s. Inasmuch as Brown, '31, was ,
not running, Loofbourow had little
competition.
Kibby Tosses Spear
In the javelin Kibby tossed the
spear 177 ft., an excellent throw for ,
this time of year. Perelli-Minetti, '31, !
was second with 158 ft. 11% in. and I
Welch, '32, third with 143 ft. 1 in.
Eric Krenz, Stockton giant of
Olympic Games fame, put the shot 4G
ft. 4in- and hurled the discus 133
