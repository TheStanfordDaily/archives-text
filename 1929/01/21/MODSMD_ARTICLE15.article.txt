# HONOR SYSTEM DEFECTS TOPIC OF ASSEMBLY NEXT THURSDAY
## 
### 
'TIIE first shot in the campaign to rectify Honor System imperfections will
be fired at a University Assembly to be held at 10 o'clock Thursday morn
ing. Phil Cavalero, President of the A.S.S.U., will preside at the meeting,
which will be turned into an open forum to sound student opinion on various
aspects of the question.
Students will be asked to vote on two questions of general policy. The
first is, whether or not names of students found guilty of cheating shall be
published instead of following the custom of referring to them as "a certain
student." The other is whether the name "Honor System" shall be retained

>or changed to a new and more ap
plicable term.
Tonight the A.S.S.U. Committee for
the Investigation of the Honor System
will meet to draw up its final report
which will be read at the assembly
Thursday.
In a preliminary report addressed
to the faculty, Templeton Peck, chair
man of the investigating committee,
made the following summary of exist
ing evils in the methods of conduct
; ing courses:
" Among other discov
ies, the committee has learned
that there are certain courses in
which it is difficult to cheat, cer
tain in which it is easy.
"I. The courses in which cheat
ing is easy are in general:
"a. 'Pipes,' where a stiff exam
ination asking minute details
leads the unprepared student to
cheat, e.g., certain Classical Liter
ature courses.
"b. Courses like 'Painters,'
where the class average is so
high that some have recourse to
cheating in order to get the al
most-perfect grade which is re
quired for passing."
Peck also pointed out that reports
and term papers offer uunlimited op
portunities for spurious practices and
recommended that specific require
ments of the paper clearly be stated.
The time element in examinations
also came in for criticism. "It is
recommended," the report states,
"that the length of examinations be
increased so that the student will
have to work full time ,or that the
time of the examination be de
creased."
Opportunities for the faculty to co
operate in obviating cheating were
cited as follows: "Abolition of read
ing slips; abolition of 'trick' questions
which encourage cheating by a dis
gusted student; attempting to vary
questions from year to year; refrain
ing from returning L. D. English
compositions .... ;and abolition of
plus-minus examinations."
The reforms are merely proposals
as the first step in making the Honor
System again effective.
Phil Cavalero is anxious to hear a
free expression of opinion on these
questions at Thursday's assembly.

Tonight the A.S.S.U. Committee for
the Investigation of the Honor System
will meet to draw up its final report
which will be read at the assembly
Thursday.
In a preliminary report addressed
to the faculty, Templeton Peck, chair
man of the investigating committee,
made the following summary of exist
ing evils in the methods of conduct
; ing courses:
" Among other discov
ies, the committee has learned
that there are certain courses in
which it is difficult to cheat, cer
tain in which it is easy.
"I. The courses in which cheat
ing is easy are in general:
"a. 'Pipes,' where a stiff exam
ination asking minute details
leads the unprepared student to
cheat, e.g., certain Classical Liter
ature courses.
"b. Courses like 'Painters,'
where the class average is so
high that some have recourse to
cheating in order to get the al
most-perfect grade which is re
quired for passing."
Peck also pointed out that reports
and term papers offer uunlimited op
portunities for spurious practices and
recommended that specific require
ments of the paper clearly be stated.
The time element in examinations
also came in for criticism. "It is
recommended," the report states,
"that the length of examinations be
increased so that the student will
have to work full time ,or that the
time of the examination be de
creased."
Opportunities for the faculty to co
operate in obviating cheating were
cited as follows: "Abolition of read
ing slips; abolition of 'trick' questions
which encourage cheating by a dis
gusted student; attempting to vary
questions from year to year; refrain
ing from returning L. D. English
compositions .... ;and abolition of
plus-minus examinations."
The reforms are merely proposals
as the first step in making the Honor
System again effective.
Phil Cavalero is anxious to hear a
free expression of opinion on these
questions at Thursday's assembly.
'TIIE first shot in the campaign to rectify Honor System imperfections will
be fired at a University Assembly to be held at 10 o'clock Thursday morn
ing. Phil Cavalero, President of the A.S.S.U., will preside at the meeting,
which will be turned into an open forum to sound student opinion on various
aspects of the question.
Students will be asked to vote on two questions of general policy. The
first is, whether or not names of students found guilty of cheating shall be
published instead of following the custom of referring to them as "a certain
student." The other is whether the name "Honor System" shall be retained

>or changed to a new and more ap
plicable term.
