# HISTORY OF QUAD SHOWS CONTRAST TO BOOK IN 1894
## 
### 
Many changes in the customs and
traditions of the University can be
traced in studying the transition of
the first Stanford Quad of a red cloth
binding and rough pages to the pres
ent year-book of the embossed art
cover, full-page color plates, and an
tique stock paper.
The first Quad in 1894 was dedi
cated in gratitude and reverence to
the "happy memory of Leland Stan
ford Junior whose early death opened
for us an avenue to higher life." The
second Quad was dedicated to Sena
tor Stanford, and the third to Mrs.
Stanford.
In the opening editorial of that first
annual is found the statement that
(lie book was "christened the Stan
ford Quad because the name is pe
culiar to this institution only, because
of its snap and vigor, and because in
it is embodied the nucleus of the Uni
versity settlement and sentiment —
the quadrangle.
In those days each class had its
own colors and yell. The class of '94
had chosen for its colors, "dregs of
wine and pink." The class yell of
'95 was "Zah! Zah! Zeer! We're right
here! '95, '95 Pioneer! The class of
I '95 was proud of herself and claimed
(and rightly) that they were the
pioneer class —the first one to start
land finish from freshman to senior
| year. "We invented the Stanford
i Quad, started the example of burning
the midnight fallow in Encina, got
| smiles from Roble, and won the water
! tank in the rush with '96. Although
we sorrowfully admit that '93, with
malice, prepense, and aforethought
did steal our lemonade at the class
reception at Roble." The Roble of '94
| is now Sequoia Hall.
