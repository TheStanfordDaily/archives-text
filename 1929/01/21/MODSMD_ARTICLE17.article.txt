# DOLLAR LINER STRANDED ON ISLAND BANK
## 81 Passengers Transferred to Munson Liner After Day of Waiting 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 20. (£>)— Held j
fast on a hidden reef, 200 miles off j
the Florida coast, the President Gar- i
field, Dollar round-the-world liner, was j
grounded yesterday on the middle !
shoals of the Bahama banks.
After a day of impatiently waiting
to be rescued from the stranded ship,
her passengers, 81 in number, were
transferred to Munson liner Pan-
America.
Radio advices indicated that the
10,000-ton liner was in no immediate
danger, but it also was indicated that :
the ship was so fast upon the Manta
nilla reef as to make moving her im
possible before today.
The Pan-America, according to ad- '
vices received, reached the side of j
the stranded liner shortly before eve- i
ning yesterday. The removal of pas- j
sengers, luggage, and mail from the
President Garfield was quickly accom- !
piished.
Immediately thereafter a radio mes- j
sage was sent out by Captain David
(Fairweather) Quinn, master of the
liner. It read:
"President Garfield ran ashore Man
tanilla shoal 7:10 a.m. Fast fore and
aft. Passengers, baggage, and mail
transferred to Pan-America. All well. |
Fine weather. Smooth sea."
Advices to Robert E. Duff, operat- j
ing manager of the Dollar Line in |
New York, said that the President i
Garfield was not leaking and that
therefore it had been unnecessary to
man the pumps.
Although admitting that the ship j
probably would be damaged to some !
extent, Duff said he did not regard !
the accident as serious.
The Navy's sea-going tug, Umqua;
a United States Coast Guard cutter
from Miami, and another vessel un- j
identified by radio dispatches, were I
standing by to aid in hauling the
President Garfield from the reefs.
Yesterday's disaster marked the ;
second time in as many years that
the President Garfield has grounded,
and the third time it has been in- ;
volved in an accident.

America.
Radio advices indicated that the
10,000-ton liner was in no immediate
danger, but it also was indicated that :
the ship was so fast upon the Manta
nilla reef as to make moving her im
possible before today.
The Pan-America, according to ad- '
vices received, reached the side of j
the stranded liner shortly before eve- i
ning yesterday. The removal of pas- j
sengers, luggage, and mail from the
President Garfield was quickly accom- !
piished.
Immediately thereafter a radio mes- j
sage was sent out by Captain David
(Fairweather) Quinn, master of the
liner. It read:
"President Garfield ran ashore Man
tanilla shoal 7:10 a.m. Fast fore and
aft. Passengers, baggage, and mail
transferred to Pan-America. All well. |
Fine weather. Smooth sea."
Advices to Robert E. Duff, operat- j
ing manager of the Dollar Line in |
New York, said that the President i
Garfield was not leaking and that
therefore it had been unnecessary to
man the pumps.
Although admitting that the ship j
probably would be damaged to some !
extent, Duff said he did not regard !
the accident as serious.
The Navy's sea-going tug, Umqua;
a United States Coast Guard cutter
from Miami, and another vessel un- j
identified by radio dispatches, were I
standing by to aid in hauling the
President Garfield from the reefs.
Yesterday's disaster marked the ;
second time in as many years that
the President Garfield has grounded,
and the third time it has been in- ;
volved in an accident.
NEW YORK, Jan. 20. (£>)— Held j
fast on a hidden reef, 200 miles off j
the Florida coast, the President Gar- i
field, Dollar round-the-world liner, was j
