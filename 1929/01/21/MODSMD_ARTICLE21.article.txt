# CARDS FACE U.C., OLYMPIC CLUB IN TILTS THIS WEEK
## Basketball Squad Will Meet Winged O Outfit in Pavilion Tuesday, Bears in Oakland Team Returns From Contest In Los Angeles With 33-26 Victory Over S.C. Trojans 
### ANSON REEDER 
This morning the Card basketball
| team returns from Los Angeles, with
! a 33 to 26 victory over the Southern
i California Trojans, to prepare for the
I hectic week which confronts them. In
j the Olympic Club and the University
!of California, Stanford meets two
! teams which, in speaking over a
■ period of years, might be termed the
| peers of Pacific Coast basketball. The
Cards will face the Club team in the
i Pavilion tomorrow night, and the
I Bears in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
| urday night.
The tilt tomorrow night against the
Winged O outfit will be hard-fought
from start to finish, with such veter
ans as Minor and Mcllose facing
Stanford's Lower Division five. Every
I year the Club team comes down here
with a group of stars to pit against
j the best the Farm has to offer, and
I for the past four years they have
! emerged victorious. This year, how
j ever, the Redshirts look as though
they have a fair chance to win, that
is, judging by their performances so
j far this season.
Card-Bear Tilt
The game with the Club, though it
i will be a real test of Card ability on
I the court, does not carry with it the
| importance, nor does it have the as
pect of the game Saturday with Cali
fornia. For when Cards meet Bears,
no matter what the occasion may be,
lit takes precedent over all others.
And in this case it is not just the
I supremacy of Card over Bear which
is involved, the Conference title is at
: stake. At present, it looks as though
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. were out of the
race, with three defeats apiece to
their credit. California is leading the
Loop with four won and none lost, and
Stanford is second with two won and
nothing lost.
In the game with the Trojans, the
' Cards proved to themselves and their
j supporters that they are slowly round
ing into the much-desired mid-season
form. The offensive attack, which had
! been so woefully lacking in some of
the previous games, also came to
light in Los Angeles, and the Red
! shirts steamed to victory. Reynolds
and Captain Rothert showed a notice
able improvement at retrieving the
ball off the backboard, and Hawkins,
I Berg, and Fawcett did the scoring.
Fawcett was again high-point man
with thirteen markers, running his
; total for the last five games played
j to fifty-nine.
i Fawcett's play throughout the game
was outstanding, as has been the case
in every game so far this season. His
ability to do the right thing at the
right time has been one of the things
which have kept the Cards in the
running thus far. His floor-work is
j fast and tricky, his passing and shoot
ing, as a rule, are accurate, his team
! work is exceptional, and he is an ex-
perienced player, despite his age, hav- j
ing played for the Hollywood Athletic
Club between the time he graduated
from high school, and when he began
attending here. Regardless of tlie fact
that this is only his first year as a
varsity player, Fawcett should be
classed as one of the best forwards j
in the collegiate circle of Pacific j
Coast basketball. If he continues the
season at his present pace, he should
have no trouble grabbing off one of :
the mythical all-Coast forward posi- '
tions.
While the Cards were vieing with !
(he Trojans, the Bears and Bruins |
were clawing it out in a two-game \
series at the Oakland Auditorium.
The Bears emerged victorious in both
affairs, winning the latter one by vir- I
tue of their ability to make free
throws. In that contest they accounted
for twelve of their thirty-five points
in this manner, missing only two out
of fourteen tries. It must have been
quite a rough-and-tumble battle with
thirty-one fouls being called during
its course. All of which goes to show
fchat the Cards will have to get busy,
if they plan on competing with the
Bears in this department. In the Tro
jan game they showed a great deal
of improvement, but there is still
plenty of room for more.

i Fawcett's play throughout the game
was outstanding, as has been the case
in every game so far this season. His
ability to do the right thing at the
right time has been one of the things
which have kept the Cards in the
running thus far. His floor-work is
j fast and tricky, his passing and shoot
ing, as a rule, are accurate, his team
! work is exceptional, and he is an ex-
perienced player, despite his age, hav- j
ing played for the Hollywood Athletic
Club between the time he graduated
from high school, and when he began
attending here. Regardless of tlie fact
that this is only his first year as a
varsity player, Fawcett should be
classed as one of the best forwards j
in the collegiate circle of Pacific j
Coast basketball. If he continues the
season at his present pace, he should
have no trouble grabbing off one of :
the mythical all-Coast forward posi- '
tions.
While the Cards were vieing with !
(he Trojans, the Bears and Bruins |
were clawing it out in a two-game \
series at the Oakland Auditorium.
The Bears emerged victorious in both
affairs, winning the latter one by vir- I
tue of their ability to make free
throws. In that contest they accounted
for twelve of their thirty-five points
in this manner, missing only two out
of fourteen tries. It must have been
quite a rough-and-tumble battle with
thirty-one fouls being called during
its course. All of which goes to show
fchat the Cards will have to get busy,
if they plan on competing with the
Bears in this department. In the Tro
jan game they showed a great deal
of improvement, but there is still
plenty of room for more.
This morning the Card basketball
| team returns from Los Angeles, with
! a 33 to 26 victory over the Southern
i California Trojans, to prepare for the
I hectic week which confronts them. In
j the Olympic Club and the University
!of California, Stanford meets two
! teams which, in speaking over a
■ period of years, might be termed the
| peers of Pacific Coast basketball. The
Cards will face the Club team in the
i Pavilion tomorrow night, and the
I Bears in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
| urday night.
The tilt tomorrow night against the
Winged O outfit will be hard-fought
from start to finish, with such veter
ans as Minor and Mcllose facing
Stanford's Lower Division five. Every
I year the Club team comes down here
with a group of stars to pit against
j the best the Farm has to offer, and
I for the past four years they have
! emerged victorious. This year, how
j ever, the Redshirts look as though
they have a fair chance to win, that
is, judging by their performances so
j far this season.
Card-Bear Tilt
The game with the Club, though it
i will be a real test of Card ability on
I the court, does not carry with it the
| importance, nor does it have the as
pect of the game Saturday with Cali
fornia. For when Cards meet Bears,
no matter what the occasion may be,
lit takes precedent over all others.
And in this case it is not just the
I supremacy of Card over Bear which
is involved, the Conference title is at
: stake. At present, it looks as though
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. were out of the
race, with three defeats apiece to
their credit. California is leading the
Loop with four won and none lost, and
Stanford is second with two won and
nothing lost.
In the game with the Trojans, the
' Cards proved to themselves and their
j supporters that they are slowly round
ing into the much-desired mid-season
form. The offensive attack, which had
! been so woefully lacking in some of
the previous games, also came to
light in Los Angeles, and the Red
! shirts steamed to victory. Reynolds
and Captain Rothert showed a notice
able improvement at retrieving the
ball off the backboard, and Hawkins,
I Berg, and Fawcett did the scoring.
Fawcett was again high-point man
with thirteen markers, running his
; total for the last five games played
j to fifty-nine.

Card-Bear Tilt
The game with the Club, though it
i will be a real test of Card ability on
I the court, does not carry with it the
| importance, nor does it have the as
pect of the game Saturday with Cali
fornia. For when Cards meet Bears,
no matter what the occasion may be,
lit takes precedent over all others.
And in this case it is not just the
I supremacy of Card over Bear which
is involved, the Conference title is at
: stake. At present, it looks as though
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. were out of the
race, with three defeats apiece to
their credit. California is leading the
Loop with four won and none lost, and
Stanford is second with two won and
nothing lost.
In the game with the Trojans, the
' Cards proved to themselves and their
j supporters that they are slowly round
ing into the much-desired mid-season
form. The offensive attack, which had
! been so woefully lacking in some of
the previous games, also came to
light in Los Angeles, and the Red
! shirts steamed to victory. Reynolds
and Captain Rothert showed a notice
able improvement at retrieving the
ball off the backboard, and Hawkins,
I Berg, and Fawcett did the scoring.
Fawcett was again high-point man
with thirteen markers, running his
; total for the last five games played
j to fifty-nine.
i Fawcett's play throughout the game
was outstanding, as has been the case
in every game so far this season. His
ability to do the right thing at the
right time has been one of the things
which have kept the Cards in the
running thus far. His floor-work is
j fast and tricky, his passing and shoot
ing, as a rule, are accurate, his team
! work is exceptional, and he is an ex-
perienced player, despite his age, hav- j
ing played for the Hollywood Athletic
Club between the time he graduated
from high school, and when he began
attending here. Regardless of tlie fact
that this is only his first year as a
varsity player, Fawcett should be
classed as one of the best forwards j
in the collegiate circle of Pacific j
Coast basketball. If he continues the
season at his present pace, he should
have no trouble grabbing off one of :
the mythical all-Coast forward posi- '
tions.
While the Cards were vieing with !
(he Trojans, the Bears and Bruins |
were clawing it out in a two-game \
series at the Oakland Auditorium.
The Bears emerged victorious in both
affairs, winning the latter one by vir- I
tue of their ability to make free
throws. In that contest they accounted
for twelve of their thirty-five points
in this manner, missing only two out
of fourteen tries. It must have been
quite a rough-and-tumble battle with
thirty-one fouls being called during
its course. All of which goes to show
fchat the Cards will have to get busy,
if they plan on competing with the
Bears in this department. In the Tro
jan game they showed a great deal
of improvement, but there is still
plenty of room for more.
This morning the Card basketball
| team returns from Los Angeles, with
! a 33 to 26 victory over the Southern
i California Trojans, to prepare for the
I hectic week which confronts them. In
j the Olympic Club and the University
!of California, Stanford meets two
! teams which, in speaking over a
■ period of years, might be termed the
| peers of Pacific Coast basketball. The
Cards will face the Club team in the
i Pavilion tomorrow night, and the
I Bears in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
| urday night.
The tilt tomorrow night against the
Winged O outfit will be hard-fought
from start to finish, with such veter
ans as Minor and Mcllose facing
Stanford's Lower Division five. Every
I year the Club team comes down here
with a group of stars to pit against
j the best the Farm has to offer, and
I for the past four years they have
! emerged victorious. This year, how
j ever, the Redshirts look as though
they have a fair chance to win, that
is, judging by their performances so
j far this season.
