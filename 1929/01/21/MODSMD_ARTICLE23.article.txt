# The 						Campaign Is Now Begun
## 
### 
Much discussion was held during the fall quarter about the Honor
System, where it stands, what needs to be done about improving it, and
whether, indeed, it ought to be kept at all. The Senior Class went the
farthest of any official body in remedying the apparent defects, when it
went on record as proposing tiiat students stand and say "someone is
cheating in this room" upon detecting a malefactor. Many letters came
into Campus Opinion; the councils looked into their methods of appre
hending and dealing with cheaters; and the Daily itself urged various
means for bettering academic conduct.
Now the time has come to mull over and consider the Honor System
in the light of the facts which have been brought out. It is imperative
that a definite attitude toward it be expressed by the student body. The
committee for the investigation of the Honor System has completed its
fact-finding and tonight will draw up a report of its work, with recom
mendations to the students as to a course of action. On Thursday, an
assembly will be held whereat the report will be read; following this, dis
cussion from the floor will take place, and whatever amendment of the
report is made will be included in what will then be rightfully considered
the Stanford Honor Code. The code will be published and re-published
as time goes on, setting forth to after generations, not by word of mouth,
but in writing, precisely what is expected of a student in his academic
conduct.
In a higher sense, of course, all prattle about "strengthening" the
Honor System and "making it more workable" simply obfuscates the
real point: that a gentleman doesn't cheat. Stanford men and women are
well-enough bred to know that; when they recollect it and practice it, the
cheating problem will cease, as already it has ceased at Princeton and the
University of Virginia.
