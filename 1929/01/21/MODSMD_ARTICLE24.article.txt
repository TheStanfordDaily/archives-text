# To Boo Is Taboo

More criticism is being heaped upon the much-discussed Stanford
rooting section. The criticism is not coming from President Wilbur, but
from Stanford students and alumni. It is not pointed at profane language
and disorderly conduct, but at the unnecessary booing at basketball games.
Every time an official penalizes Stanford on a close decision, he is the
object of numerous catcalls and jeers. Every time an opposing team
endeavors to keep its slight lead in the closing moments of play by passing
the ball around in its end of the court, a loud roar of disapproval arises
from the Stanford supporters.
Stanford prides itself on its courteous treatment of opponents, and
its record is at present clean. But if this booing continues, Stanford will
lose the admiration of its opponents, and even of its supporters. So far
the pleas of the yell-leaders to stop the booing have not been heeded.
Spontaneous cheering is a great thing, but its aim should be solely
to encourage the Cardinal basketball team.
