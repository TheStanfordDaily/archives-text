Whilst it has not been the policy of the Daily editorially to speak in
the controversy aroused by Winston Norman's Bullsession 011 "The
Caste System" (for we prefer to let Air. Norman himself unscramble his
eggs), yet we have a definite answer to make to Mr. Allen Emery, '17,
author of a letter in today's Campus Opinion column.
Mr. Emery takes exception to Norman's Bullsession because (1) a
report of it appeared in the San Francisco Examiner (which is bad, bad) ;
(2) since the utterance appeared close upon the heels of sorority rushing
season, it is unfair, as well as untrue; (3) it was a cheap bid for pub
licity on Norman's part; and (4) it was decidedly in bad taste. Where
fore, "publication of such an article at such a time by your paper leads
to the conclusion that perhaps it would be just as well to censor your
columns and especially to censor the material gleaned from your columns
and sent out by the campus correspondents of the San Francisco news
papers."
The reader can well appreciate how deeply wounded were our sensi
bilities when we read that Mr. Emery felt our columns ought to be
censored. Dash it all, friends, we try as hard as ever we can to make
this sort of paper you could let your seventeen-year-old sister read.
Any reader may take issue with any opinion or policy herein set forth,
and his objections will be published. But we are just unbrideled enough
to highly resent suggestions in Campus Opinions that we be censored.
