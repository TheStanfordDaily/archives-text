# Honest Students Rise Up In China

(From The Daily Trojan)
Outburst against the honor system, instead of being confined to this
campus, seems to be world-wide, as evidenced by the uproar recently in
Nanking, China, when civil examinations were disrupted by cries of
"Cheat." In defiance of the honor system, many students came to the
examination room with notes hidden in their hats, shoes, socks, and oven
with textbooks concealed in their voluminous sleeves.
Honest students, upon spying the deceptive methods, began snatching
away the papers of the cheaters and a free-for-all battle was waged in
the classroom, to be quelled only by the arrival of the police.
The honor system was maintained because the next day all students
were carefully searched as they entered the room, and the supervised
.students resumed their examination in pcace, according to an acount in
the Times. That Chinese methods of defying the honor system will not be
adopted by American university students is not greatly feared, since their
coat sleeves will not permit concealment of texts and they wear no hats in
which to conceal their notes.
