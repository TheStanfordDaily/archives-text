# The 						Bull session
## AS WE WERE SAYING 
### 
As usual with most controversies
hereabouts, discussion aroused by our
article, "The Caste System," has de
[ veloped into a mixture of 10% argu
j ment and 90% personalities. Right
i here and now we admit and agree
with all the nasty things folks have
said about us. That leaves us free to
reiurn to the original subject: name
ly, the advisability of abolishing
sororities at Stanford.
Active belligerents in this question
to date are about evenly divided. But
wo will venture to guess that nine
tenths of the women in sororities (in
cluding, perhaps, a goodly percentage
of those who have publicly flayed us)
agree, when nobody is looking, that
sororities should disappear; just as
nine in ten Row men feel secretly
that fraternities should be abolished.
To admit such belief would be so
cial suicide for the pin-wearer. For
the non-Row man or woman the
questoin is taboo, since his or her
motives would be questioned; there
fore, until we so foolishly put our
neck in a noose last Thursday, the
subject had x'emained underground.
Would that it were now.
Do not make the mistake of sup
posing that the undersigned iB sit
ting all by his lonesome in this con
troversy, holding the proverbial sack.
"A Sorority Member," in her classic
reply published last Friday, italicizes
thusly: "If Roble is a prison it is the
attitude of the men that makes it
one."
Bunk. Bosh. Folderol. Stanford men
—with the exception of a negligible
few who have the idea that Greek
letters spell social success —do not
discriminate between Row and Roble.
If the sororities rate more dates, it is
because, being small and compact,
they are more convenient dating bu
reaus.
It is perfectly true that many wo
men in Roble have stayed there in
preference to going Row. It is per
fectly true that there are some whose
parents sent them to Stanford with

stern instructions that they could not
go Row (a fine form of unintentional
cruelty). Rut that does not prove
that they all like Roble. Many of
them hate it. Roble is more conven
ient and comfortable, to be sure, but
it lacks the homelike atmosphere that
a smaller living group would have,
and it is too big for intimate social
contact among its occupants.
Perhaps we were thinking of this
when we so innocently nosed into a
hornet's nest by terming Roble a
"Bastille." But we were thinking of
something more besides —a further
factor which makes each sorority
just as much a Baatille. Stanford wo
men are mentally imprisoned. They
are carefully restricted and watched
and burdened with rules and admoni
tions, like young boarding-school
girls, until, unconsciously, they take
to watching and restricting one an
other. Individuality withers and dies
in such a system, and the woman who
expresses a radical or unusual notion
is likely to be looked upon as "queer."
The result is that most Stanford wo
men lack gumption enough to be "dif
ferent."
It is regrettable that Mrs. Stanford
limited the number of women to 500.
With odds five to one against them,
Stanford women are at great disad
vantage. That would seem to be all
the more reason why they should for
get group distinctions and rivalries
and get together.
And that is just one reason why
small living groups, situated close to
gether and without Greek letters,
would be vastly superior to the pres
ent Row-Roble arrangement.
Five hundred women is too small a
number for caste distinctions.
In spite of all the resultant hubbub,
perhaps it is a good thing that this
whole discussion has arisen, because,
with the coming abolition of the
Lower Division, sororities and fra
ternities at Stanford will face a crisis.
It may be the handwriting on the wall.

ly, the advisability of abolishing
sororities at Stanford.
Active belligerents in this question
to date are about evenly divided. But
wo will venture to guess that nine
tenths of the women in sororities (in
cluding, perhaps, a goodly percentage
of those who have publicly flayed us)
agree, when nobody is looking, that
sororities should disappear; just as
nine in ten Row men feel secretly
that fraternities should be abolished.
To admit such belief would be so
cial suicide for the pin-wearer. For
the non-Row man or woman the
questoin is taboo, since his or her
motives would be questioned; there
fore, until we so foolishly put our
neck in a noose last Thursday, the
subject had x'emained underground.
Would that it were now.
Do not make the mistake of sup
posing that the undersigned iB sit
ting all by his lonesome in this con
troversy, holding the proverbial sack.
"A Sorority Member," in her classic
reply published last Friday, italicizes
thusly: "If Roble is a prison it is the
attitude of the men that makes it
one."
Bunk. Bosh. Folderol. Stanford men
—with the exception of a negligible
few who have the idea that Greek
letters spell social success —do not
discriminate between Row and Roble.
If the sororities rate more dates, it is
because, being small and compact,
they are more convenient dating bu
reaus.
It is perfectly true that many wo
men in Roble have stayed there in
preference to going Row. It is per
fectly true that there are some whose
parents sent them to Stanford with

stern instructions that they could not
go Row (a fine form of unintentional
cruelty). Rut that does not prove
that they all like Roble. Many of
them hate it. Roble is more conven
ient and comfortable, to be sure, but
it lacks the homelike atmosphere that
a smaller living group would have,
and it is too big for intimate social
contact among its occupants.
Perhaps we were thinking of this
when we so innocently nosed into a
hornet's nest by terming Roble a
"Bastille." But we were thinking of
something more besides —a further
factor which makes each sorority
just as much a Baatille. Stanford wo
men are mentally imprisoned. They
are carefully restricted and watched
and burdened with rules and admoni
tions, like young boarding-school
girls, until, unconsciously, they take
to watching and restricting one an
other. Individuality withers and dies
in such a system, and the woman who
expresses a radical or unusual notion
is likely to be looked upon as "queer."
The result is that most Stanford wo
men lack gumption enough to be "dif
ferent."
It is regrettable that Mrs. Stanford
limited the number of women to 500.
With odds five to one against them,
Stanford women are at great disad
vantage. That would seem to be all
the more reason why they should for
get group distinctions and rivalries
and get together.
And that is just one reason why
small living groups, situated close to
gether and without Greek letters,
would be vastly superior to the pres
ent Row-Roble arrangement.
Five hundred women is too small a
number for caste distinctions.
In spite of all the resultant hubbub,
perhaps it is a good thing that this
whole discussion has arisen, because,
with the coming abolition of the
Lower Division, sororities and fra
ternities at Stanford will face a crisis.
It may be the handwriting on the wall.

sororities should disappear; just as
nine in ten Row men feel secretly
that fraternities should be abolished.
To admit such belief would be so
cial suicide for the pin-wearer. For
the non-Row man or woman the
questoin is taboo, since his or her
motives would be questioned; there
fore, until we so foolishly put our
neck in a noose last Thursday, the
subject had x'emained underground.
Would that it were now.
Do not make the mistake of sup
posing that the undersigned iB sit
ting all by his lonesome in this con
troversy, holding the proverbial sack.
"A Sorority Member," in her classic
reply published last Friday, italicizes
thusly: "If Roble is a prison it is the
attitude of the men that makes it
one."
Bunk. Bosh. Folderol. Stanford men
—with the exception of a negligible
few who have the idea that Greek
letters spell social success —do not
discriminate between Row and Roble.
If the sororities rate more dates, it is
because, being small and compact,
they are more convenient dating bu
reaus.
It is perfectly true that many wo
men in Roble have stayed there in
preference to going Row. It is per
fectly true that there are some whose
parents sent them to Stanford with

stern instructions that they could not
go Row (a fine form of unintentional
cruelty). Rut that does not prove
that they all like Roble. Many of
them hate it. Roble is more conven
ient and comfortable, to be sure, but
it lacks the homelike atmosphere that
a smaller living group would have,
and it is too big for intimate social
contact among its occupants.
Perhaps we were thinking of this
when we so innocently nosed into a
hornet's nest by terming Roble a
"Bastille." But we were thinking of
something more besides —a further
factor which makes each sorority
just as much a Baatille. Stanford wo
men are mentally imprisoned. They
are carefully restricted and watched
and burdened with rules and admoni
tions, like young boarding-school
girls, until, unconsciously, they take
to watching and restricting one an
other. Individuality withers and dies
in such a system, and the woman who
expresses a radical or unusual notion
is likely to be looked upon as "queer."
The result is that most Stanford wo
men lack gumption enough to be "dif
ferent."
It is regrettable that Mrs. Stanford
limited the number of women to 500.
With odds five to one against them,
Stanford women are at great disad
vantage. That would seem to be all
the more reason why they should for
get group distinctions and rivalries
and get together.
And that is just one reason why
small living groups, situated close to
gether and without Greek letters,
would be vastly superior to the pres
ent Row-Roble arrangement.
Five hundred women is too small a
number for caste distinctions.
In spite of all the resultant hubbub,
perhaps it is a good thing that this
whole discussion has arisen, because,
with the coming abolition of the
Lower Division, sororities and fra
ternities at Stanford will face a crisis.
It may be the handwriting on the wall.
