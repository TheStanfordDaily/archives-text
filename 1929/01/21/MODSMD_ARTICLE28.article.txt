## PROPOSES CENSORSHIP FOR ARTICLES LIKE NORMAN'S 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The first reaction from the article
by Winston Norman has hit San
Francisco.
The story in the Examiner, which I
herewith enclose, states that Win
ston Norman, registered at Stanford
from Toronto, Canada, contributed an
article, which I would assume was
published in your public forum col
umn, to the effect that Stanford Unit
versity sororities breed class distinc- j
tion, and lead to "broken hearts" I
and disrupted college careers for
girls.
Following the end of the sorority j
rushing season, as this utterance ;
dc.es, Mr. Norman's article is decided- !
ly unfair, as well as untrue.
Comments I have heard from sen- |
sible Stanford alumni are to the effect
that this is simply a bid for cheap
publicity on the part of Mr. Norman.
Comments from men unfamiliar
with Stanford are to the effect that |
this is an article which would give a S
very unfavorable impression of the J
University and of Stanford girls.
Ladies are supposed to be entitled
to a little extra consideration in this !
world. This article is not considerate, j
Do you think Mr. Norman's article j
article has helped to smooth ruffled |
feelings?
Is it not possible that many girls
are in Roble Hall today of their own
free choice or that of their parents,

perhaps because of non-approval of
the sorority idea? If you do not con
cede this, do you not think that the
} general admission of such a possibil
ity would be balm for wounded feel
| ings?
Is not Roble Hall a very pleasant
jhome? Might not young women pre-:
| fer to live there because of its su
j perior comfort?
Mr. Norman's article is in decidedly
| bad taste. Let him stick to his knit- j
i ting, which so far as can be deduced, |
: should not include intrusion into the ;
! sorority system at Stanford.
Publication of such an article at !
' such a time by your paper leads to |
the conclusion that perhaps it would
Ibe just as well to censor your col
j umns and especially to censor the
material gleaned from your columns
and sent out by the campus corre- j
spondents of the San Francisco news- j
papers.
I am writing this as a Stanford j
i graduate, a member of the Alumni i
j Association, a former member of the
| Daily Palo Alto staff, and contributor !
i to Chaparral.
A copy of this letter is being sent
ito Mr. J. E. McDowell, Stanford j
j alumni secretary.
With best wishes to yourself for
j a successful term as Editor-in-Chief
of the Stanford Daily,
Very truly,

! sorority system at Stanford.
Publication of such an article at !
' such a time by your paper leads to |
the conclusion that perhaps it would
Ibe just as well to censor your col
j umns and especially to censor the
material gleaned from your columns
and sent out by the campus corre- j
spondents of the San Francisco news- j
papers.
I am writing this as a Stanford j

A copy of this letter is being sent

The Editor, Sir:
The first reaction from the article
by Winston Norman has hit San
Francisco.
The story in the Examiner, which I
herewith enclose, states that Win
ston Norman, registered at Stanford
from Toronto, Canada, contributed an
article, which I would assume was
published in your public forum col
umn, to the effect that Stanford Unit
versity sororities breed class distinc- j
tion, and lead to "broken hearts" I
and disrupted college careers for
girls.
Following the end of the sorority j
rushing season, as this utterance ;
dc.es, Mr. Norman's article is decided- !
ly unfair, as well as untrue.
Comments I have heard from sen- |
sible Stanford alumni are to the effect
that this is simply a bid for cheap
publicity on the part of Mr. Norman.
Comments from men unfamiliar
with Stanford are to the effect that |
this is an article which would give a S
very unfavorable impression of the J
University and of Stanford girls.
Ladies are supposed to be entitled
to a little extra consideration in this !
world. This article is not considerate, j
Do you think Mr. Norman's article j
article has helped to smooth ruffled |
feelings?
Is it not possible that many girls
are in Roble Hall today of their own
free choice or that of their parents,

perhaps because of non-approval of
the sorority idea? If you do not con
cede this, do you not think that the
} general admission of such a possibil
ity would be balm for wounded feel
| ings?
Is not Roble Hall a very pleasant
jhome? Might not young women pre-:
| fer to live there because of its su
j perior comfort?
Mr. Norman's article is in decidedly
| bad taste. Let him stick to his knit- j
i ting, which so far as can be deduced, |
: should not include intrusion into the ;
! sorority system at Stanford.
