# WOMEN SHOULD THINK CLEARLY ON HALL-ROW QUESTION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There is a certain religious sect in
San Francisco that wears hoods and
jumps, by way of showing devotion
to its deity. They have been subject
to a good deal of criticism for the
high state of mystic fanaticism that
accompanies their activities — but
there have been moments in the past
two weeks when we felt they would
appreciate and admire meeting their
masters in the gentle art of emo
tionalism —the Stanford Women.
But now that the annual Chautau
qua is past, and the precious bric-a
brac and door prizes have been given
out —for a year at least —the time has
come for the Five Hundred to emerge
from their forg, and show —if possible
—some symptoms of clear thinking.
The moot question of Roble and Row
was introduced by Mr. Norman in a
Bull Session recently. If you remem

ber, his article was not pointed pri
marily at either the Bastille or at the
Sisters —his criticism was of the ex
isting living group arrangement of
the Five Hundred.
In spite of the fact that the soro
rity question is one of the most pop
ular subjects for covert bull sessions
among the women, no sister or non
sister has yet had the courage to in
j itiate it herself. The way is now open
—how's for a little clear thinking,
and analysis instead of hisses, tears,
! and scratches?
And as for accepting the premise,
from the beginning, that whether or
| not you will ultimately decide the
| Pan-Hellenic world is the best or the
; worst, the situation is open to criti
| cism. Even the best psychopathic
wards and rooting sections are open
to reform, you know!
