# JUST ANOTHER CASE OF THE GRIPE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Now that it seems fashionable to |
moralize or criticize I would like to j
add another item to (he already long
list of problems that is troubling this j
sorority-infested campus. I apologize j
most profusely for not carrying on
some of the idealistic arguments that j
have been advanced by contemporary

"opinionists," but I must admit that j
iny mind is only capable of embracing j
very rudimentary and commonplace !
ideas.
However, I would like to know what !
is going to be done about regulating
the parking in areas adjacent to the I
Quad.
Word comes from Pasadena that j

Stanford very efficiently handled the
traffic in and about tho Rose Bowl,
and yet I defy any Pasadenan to de
; cipher the system used in handling
i the traffic around the Quad. The prob
lem certainly does not arise from a
lack of space but from a lack of or
ganization. Anyone who has tried to
park in the area next to the library
knows that even though the area is
apparently full there are many open
J spaces which are useless because the
, cars are parked in a manner that
! would do credit to a Chinese puzzle.
Even when one is lucky enough to
get into a space, there is usually
some very considerate latecomer who
manages to "box" your car.
Some bright students have sug
| gested that we abandon automobiles,
t or buy Fords, but when slightly late
to class even these reformers have
; been known to use automobiles. How
j ever, I do not think that anything as
j drastic as this need be done, and I
even believe that a little planning and
a few lime marks would remedy the
situation. If we can handle thousands
of automobiles at some of our football
j games, why can't we handle a few
hundred right in the heart of our
own campus?
After all we must have some
thought for the future, and we must
evolve an efficient parking plan to
provide for the horde of machines
that will be used by future genera
tions who, scientists tell us, will be
born without legs. â€”A. E.
