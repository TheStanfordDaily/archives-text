Question and Answer Box:
Query: What would you do if
you had a million dollars:
Today's answer: (by R. L. Wil
bur, educator) Well I don't know
I guess I would get myself a
couple of pairs of socks and a
rooter's cap as the one I got is
soiled. I guess the school needs
some new buildings and some
"labs" as I have nicknamed them.
Yes, I guess some new buildings
is about what we need. Theatre?
Well, I don't know. A guy can see
some pretty good movies in
"Paly" and besides I guess none
of us is going to get a million
smacks (ha ha).

old Stanford home.
The janitors are scouring the Se
quoia halls today after the success
of the 8.0. Festival.
One of the Daily's delightful anony
mous stories saysâ€”
"Women's Council .... fined one
woman one dollar for improper park
ing."
A relapsation, so to speak, of the
usual penalties.
