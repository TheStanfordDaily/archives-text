# DOLORES DEL RIO ADDS EVANGELINE ROLE TO MANY CHARACTERIZATIONS
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
Exotic Dolores Del Rio is one of
the outstanding figures in the moving
picture world, and an afternoon with
her "on location" is one to be long
remembered. Since the stunning
Mexican star did so well by Ramona,
United Artists have decided to let
her give lasting fame to Evangeline,
the heroine of Longfellow's poem. And
so the Monterey peninsula is getting
a tremendous thrill from the big com
pany of actors and technicians that
are spending all of January making
exteriors for "Evangeline" at Point
Lobos.
One of the pleasures of a week-end
spent in Monterey was a talk with
Miss Del Rio. She was dressed in the
quaint costume of the long-ago period,
and on the afternoon I spent "on lo
cation" was leading a picturesque
wedding festival dance. The entire
village of Grand Pre, the dream town
of Longfellow's verse, has been
erected at Point Lobos. The company
was working at Evangeline's home
this particular day.
"1 play so many foreign characters
that I think it necessary for me to
travel a lot," Miss Del Rio told me
in mentioning a European tour from
which she has just recently returned.
"No, I did not go to make personal
appearances — just for pleasure. It
was my third trip abroad and I visited
thirteen countries this time." But her
presence in various European cities
took on the look of a public recep
tion, if we are to believe newspaper
accounts of the enthusiastic way in
which she was received whenever her
admirers spotted her.
Miss Del Rio wears very little
make-up when working before the
carea, and to my surprise speaks ex
cellent English. She looks just as she
does qn the screen —lovely big dark
eyes, black hair slicked back severe
ly, pretty smile, and a perfect com
plexion which adds to her personal
charm.
She is absolutely democratic. Her
meteoric success in the movies has
not given her the high-hat. Four years
ago she was a society leader in Mex
ico City, reputedly one of the wealth
iest women in Mexico. Came an ur
gent request that she take a film
test. At first she thought she would
just do picture work for fun.
Then came her great hit as Char
ma ine in "What Price Glory." After
that Hollywood captured her heart
completely, and for the past three
years she has devoted all her inter
ests to the screen. In the short time
that she has been in pictures she has
risen high in the scale of favorites —
this past year she was the fifth most
popular woman star, according to box
office returns.
Her best roles have been those in
which she was permitted to charac
terize, "Ramona" being an outstand
ing success. And so she believes in
traveling to get first-hand informa
tion about the persons she is called
upon to portray.
In her current production she is
supported by Alec B. Francis, Roland

Drew, anil Donald Reed. Mr. Francis,
who is beloved everywhere for his
character roles —he starred in "The
Return of Peter Grimm" and "The
Music Master" and many other equal
ly big films —talked to me at some
length. He plays the faithful old
priest who flees south with Evange
line after the Acadian village is
burned to the ground. Mr. Francis'
long association with the movies
make him most interesting.
Point Lobos, one of the beauty spots
of the world, is a gorgeous setting
for the "ideal" village of Longfellow.
The cottages and church that have
been built so recently look so mellow
and peaceful in the warm sun that
one would like to move right into one
of them.
The public Is allowed to watch the
movie people work —and if you've
never had an opportunity to get a
close-up view of "how it's done" I ad
vise a trip to Monterey.
