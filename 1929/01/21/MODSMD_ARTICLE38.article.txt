# MURAL FAVORITES TOPPLED IN RACE FOR CAGE HONORS
## 
### 
In a series of hectic upsets and
lop-sided victories, the second round
of intramural basketball was played
off last week at Encina Gym and the
Pavilion. Three favorites were prac
tically knocked out of the champion
ship race, when they went down to
defeat at the hands of supposedly
weaker teams.
Coming from behind in the last
minute of play, El Campo rallied to
nose out Beta Theta Pi by a single
point and in doing so furnished the
biggest surprise of the week. Alpha
Delta Phi looked like certain champs
of league three, until they were
soundly trounced by a strong Encina
4W squad last Monday. El Toro put
the Phi Delts out of the running by
chalking up a one-sided win over
their Row opponents.
Sigma Chis Triumph
Piling up the largest score to date
in the mural hoop tourney, Sigma Chi
walloped Theta Chi by a 42 to 5
margin and established itself as "the
team to beat." The Sigma Chi boys
not only displayed a flashy passing
attack, but looped the ball in from
all angles.
Phi Kappa Sigma looked good on
Thursday night when it trampled on
Encina Basement to win by 25 points.
Delta Upsilon had an easy time run
ning up a big lead on the Chinese
Club. Ringing the bucket time after
time, Phi Kappa Sigma ran away
from the A.T.O.'s in an uninteresting
game.
Leaders Win Easily
Sequoia 1, Kappa Alpha, and Break
ers each scored a victory to keep at
the top of their respective leagues.
Missing an ample number of sucker
shots, Breakers was lucky to win
over Theta Xi. Kappa Alpha, win
ners of last year's basketball tourna
ment, was hard pressed to beat a
weak Theta Delta Chi outfit.
A couple of "dead-eye dicks" came
to the front in last week's play. Fish
er, lanky center on the speedy En
cina 4W squad, became high scorer
of the tourney by tossing in eight
field goals and two free throws dur
ing the game with Alpha Delta Phi

for a sum total of 1& points. Elliot,
of Sigma Chi, followed with 17 tal
lies, which is not half bad for an eve
ning's workout. Weaver, Phi Kappa
Psi sharpshooter, and Van King, "ea
gle eye" of Chi Psi Lodge, were next
in line with 16 and 15 points respec
tively.
Guards Show
Several guards stood out because
of their defensive work. Goldsmith
played a classy floor game for the
Breakers, as did Klabau of Sigma
Chi. Morton showed up well on the
Kappa Sig team. Linsey, at standing
guard for Encina 4W, starred for the
hall squad in its game with the Al
pha Delts.
Only one team failed to show up
fo 7 * its game in the second round.
Alpha Sigma Phi won by default
from Encina lE. The third round of
games opens with tonight's contests,
featuring El Toro, Breakers, Phi
Delts, and Alpha Sigma Phi.
The custom of wearing berets has
been adopted by senior men in engi
neering, architectural, commercial,
and applied arts courses at the Uni
versity of Cincinnati.

Alpha Sigma Phi won by default
from Encina lE. The third round of
games opens with tonight's contests,
featuring El Toro, Breakers, Phi
Delts, and Alpha Sigma Phi.
The custom of wearing berets has
been adopted by senior men in engi

In a series of hectic upsets and
lop-sided victories, the second round
of intramural basketball was played
off last week at Encina Gym and the
Pavilion. Three favorites were prac
tically knocked out of the champion
ship race, when they went down to
defeat at the hands of supposedly
weaker teams.
Coming from behind in the last
minute of play, El Campo rallied to
nose out Beta Theta Pi by a single
point and in doing so furnished the
biggest surprise of the week. Alpha
Delta Phi looked like certain champs
of league three, until they were
soundly trounced by a strong Encina
4W squad last Monday. El Toro put
the Phi Delts out of the running by
chalking up a one-sided win over
their Row opponents.
Sigma Chis Triumph
Piling up the largest score to date
in the mural hoop tourney, Sigma Chi
walloped Theta Chi by a 42 to 5
margin and established itself as "the
team to beat." The Sigma Chi boys
not only displayed a flashy passing
attack, but looped the ball in from
all angles.
Phi Kappa Sigma looked good on
Thursday night when it trampled on
Encina Basement to win by 25 points.
Delta Upsilon had an easy time run
ning up a big lead on the Chinese
Club. Ringing the bucket time after
time, Phi Kappa Sigma ran away
from the A.T.O.'s in an uninteresting
game.
Leaders Win Easily
Sequoia 1, Kappa Alpha, and Break
ers each scored a victory to keep at
the top of their respective leagues.
Missing an ample number of sucker
shots, Breakers was lucky to win
over Theta Xi. Kappa Alpha, win
ners of last year's basketball tourna
ment, was hard pressed to beat a
weak Theta Delta Chi outfit.
A couple of "dead-eye dicks" came
to the front in last week's play. Fish
er, lanky center on the speedy En
cina 4W squad, became high scorer
of the tourney by tossing in eight
field goals and two free throws dur
ing the game with Alpha Delta Phi

for a sum total of 1& points. Elliot,
of Sigma Chi, followed with 17 tal
lies, which is not half bad for an eve
ning's workout. Weaver, Phi Kappa
Psi sharpshooter, and Van King, "ea
gle eye" of Chi Psi Lodge, were next
in line with 16 and 15 points respec
tively.
Guards Show
Several guards stood out because
of their defensive work. Goldsmith
played a classy floor game for the
Breakers, as did Klabau of Sigma
Chi. Morton showed up well on the
Kappa Sig team. Linsey, at standing
guard for Encina 4W, starred for the
hall squad in its game with the Al
pha Delts.
Only one team failed to show up
fo 7 * its game in the second round.
