# SPORTS OF 1929
## No Ugly Duckling 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Leon Allen Goslin, outfielder of the I
: Washington Senators, got a nice
Christmas present this year. On De
cember 17th, or thereabouts, the of
ficial American League averages were
released, and these showed that Mr. I
Goslin had beaten out Mr. Manush j
of the St. Louis Drowns by the slim
margin of one point. Now one point
j is a lot in a game of hockey or polo,
| or on a pin, but it's not so much as
I far as baseball averages go. Before
! the release of the official averages
I the championship was in doubt, as
| A1 Elias, the demon statistician, had
j told the world that Heinie Manush 1
j had won, while Irving Howe, likewise
| a demon statistician, had jumbled his J
best figures around to prove that Gos- j
lin was the leader| It happens that
1 Howe is the official figure-jumbler of
the American League, so Manush and ,
Elias lost.
Some folks prefer Turkey for
Christmas, but Washington likes its
I Goose. Leon got that name from the

! shape of his beak, or horn. In the
Washington-Pittsburgh world series
of 1925, Mr. "Oil" Smith was so gar
rulous on the subject of Mr. Goslin's
proboscis, or nose, that it was some
I time before the indignant Senators
could see the ball through his rage.
But he managed to bat .308 for the
series in spite of Mr. Smith's best
inaults.
"The Goose hangs high" right now,
and is quite naturally proud of his
first batting championship. He's only
27, and has already made 1,277 hits
for Washington in eight seasons, and
| scored 635 runs. He's not a Bad Egg
to have around, this Goslin fellow!
