# BABE HOOPSETRS ROUT RICHMOND HIGH FIVE 54-12
## Bill Doub High-Point Man in Lopsided Card Victory; Shrader Second 
### 
Stanford's Pavilion bore a close re- I
semblance to a race track with near
ly all of the running being done in ;
one direction last Friday night when
the Cardinal yearling basketball
team (or would it be better to say 1
squad?) spent a pleasant evening!
taking the Richmond High School
cagers into camp by a score of 54 to
12.
Coach Bradshaw was not partial j
and allowed twelve of his charges to
share the glory, all but one of whom '
scored at least one point apiece. Bill i
Doub, center, ran away with high
point honors, accounting for 20 of his
team's tallies, while Shrader was sec
ond with 10.
Listless First Half
During the first quarter the year
lings spent most of the time passing '
the ball around under the visitors' j
basket, now and then taking a shot 1
just to keep in practice. The score i
at the end of the first period was 16 j
to 0. In the second quarter, however, j
they scored only 15 tallies, while the !
Richmond players slipped in a field
goal and a free throw to bring their j
total up to three.
The third quarter was a repetition
of the first, the Stanford team scor
ing 14 points, and holding the visitors
scoreless. In the last period, while !
most of the first and second string
Cardinals were taking their showers,
the Richmond quintet came through
with a rally, chalking up 9 more
points before the referee called a j
halt.
Subs Shine
Among the babe substitutes who :
made a good showing were Giberson,
a tricky guard, Lambert and Clough,
forwards, and Grey, center.
Tomorrow evening the yearlings I
will take on the Stockton High
School quintet, winners of last year's
state championship. This will prob
ably be one of the hardest teams the
Card youngsters are to face before
the California series and a close game
is expected.
