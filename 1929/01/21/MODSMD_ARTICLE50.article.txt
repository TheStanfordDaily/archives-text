# NEW DEVICE SETS TYPE BY TELEGRAPH

### 

The teletypesetter, designed to shorten by another step, the time and work involved in transmit
ting news from its source to the printed page. The small boxlike object on a table, through which
the white tape runs, is the transmitting distributor that enables the typesetting machine to set in
metal lines the news transmitted to it directly from an automatic telegraph printer wire. An auto
matic receiving machine punches the tape, and the distributor machine, taking the place of a human
typesetter, translates it into electrical energy that operates the typesetting machine. Both linotype
and intertype machines may be equipped. The invention was initiated by Frank E. Gannett of
Rochester, N. Y., and by Walter W. Morey of East Orange, New Jersey.
