## 
### 
Spreading his long grey beard in
: front of his face to hide a flush of
mortification, the Old Boy broke
down yesterday and confessed that
he needs copy for his next number
j of the Chaparral. Anything, he wails,
anything will do, for the next issue
is to be simply an "Ordinary Num
; her," and will consist of a conglomera
, tion of hetrogeneous matter. Art, two
line and longer jokes, quips, or puns
i on any subject on or under the sun
j will be gratefully received.
"But," said the aged gentleman as
:he lifted his head to proudly assert
some authority, "all contributions,
j art or literary, must be in by tomor-
I row. Drop them in the box on my door
| in the Press Building or mail them
jto Box 15. And remember, copy in
j today will get more consideration
than that which is turned in tomor
! row."
