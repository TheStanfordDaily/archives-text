# SENATE ACCEPTS ROY O. WEST IN SECRET SESSION
## Vote Reported as 54 to 27; Independents Attempt to Make Proceedings Public Secretary's Connection With Insull Companies Is Main Objection to Appointment 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. (^)— Roy
O. West, of Chicago, was confirmed
today as Secretary of the Interior by
the Senate by an overwhelming vote
after three days of discussion of his
■nomination in secret session.
The vote was reported as 54 to 27,
but there were many conflicting re
ports on the actual number of ballots
received by West, the range being be
tween 52 and 55.
Republican independents who op
posed the nominee because of his pre
vious connections with the Samuel In
sull Power Utility interests, made a
determined last-minute effort to have
the proceedings, including the roll
•call and the committee reports, made
public. But they failed by close votes.
Appointed last August by President
Coolidge to succeed Secretary Work
when he became chairman of the Re
publican National Committee, Mr.
West's nomination was sent to the
Senate early in December. He ap
peared at open hearings before the
Senate Lands Committee and re
ceived a vote of 9 to 4 for confirma
tion there.
A number of Democrats joined with
the Republican majority in the vote
lor confirmation. Senator Deneen re
called the testimony of West before
the Lands Committee that the nomi
nee had sold his investments in the
Insull companies at the time he was
appointed to the Cabinet. He said
that over a period of twenty-six years
West had invested about $67,000 in
the Insull stocks which were sold for
about $118,000.

Testifying before the Lands Com
mittee, West said that his law busi
ness for the Insull companies had
been only of a "casual" nature.

On his behalf, it was recalled that
he had consented to withdraw from
participation in any cases coming be
fore his department involving the
Insull companies.
