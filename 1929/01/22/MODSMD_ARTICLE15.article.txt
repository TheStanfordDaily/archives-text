# STANFORD BABES MEET STOCKTON QUINTET TONIGHT
## Game Will Show Comparative Abilities of Cardinal And Bear Frosh 
### 
Followers of Stanford's freshman
basketball team will have their first
opportunity to compare the respective
abilities of the Cardinal and Bear
babe quintets when the redshirt young
sters clash with the Stockton High
School team at 6:45 o'clock tonight in
the Pavilion.

Last Friday the Stockton players
trounced the California freshmen by
the overwhelming score of 29 to 17,
and the cubs were considered to be
a strong team. The California and
Stanford youngsters will meet in the
first of a three-game series next Sat
urday night as a preliminary to the
varsity contest.
Coach Bradsliaw has announced the
starting lineup for tonight's game as
foilows: Kelly and Shrader, forwards,
Doub, center, and Rintala and Baker,
guards. Alvin Ray, speedy little for
ward, is also certain to see action,
and possibly Giberson and Lambert,
if the regulars fail to get going.
Shrader, who has been handicapped
by an injured ankle, is now rounding
back into shape and is expected to
play a good game tonight. As usual,
the offense will center around Bill
Doub, husky center, who has been
the mainstay of the team in all of
their games to date.
The Stockton team which will come
on the floor tonight is practically the
same one which won the state cham
pionship last year. The visitors' of
fense will be led by Jack Hancock,
6 foot, 200 pound center, who has
been one of the team's outstanding
players for the past two years.
