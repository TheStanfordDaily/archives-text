When the Card basketball team
i takes the floor against the strong
' Olympic Club quintet here tonight,
they will start without the services of
three men who were instrumental in
the Trojan defeat at the hands of
Stanford Saturday.
Coach Husky Hunt will start Johnny
McCandless at center, and Phil Mof
fatt and Vard Loomis at the two for
ward positions. Reynolds and Captain
Rothert will hold down the guard
positions as usual.
Berg, Fawcett Out
The varsity squad returned from
; the South yesterday morning with
j two men, Vance Fawcett and Red
I Berg, the Card forward combination,
j both on the casualty list. Fawcett was
i suffering from a sprained ankle and
Berg was hobbling around with a pair
! of badly blistered feet. Although nei
ther is likely to play tonight, it is
probable that both will be in the line
up when the Cards tangle with the
Bears in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
;urday night.
McCandless, Moffatt, and Loomis,
, who will start the game, are all ex
perienced players and should give
the seasoned Winged "O" outfit a
j good battle. McCandless started the
season at center, but was replaced by
Hawkins because he couldn't seem
to find the basket. In practice he has
been showing improvement in thi3
department, so he should come
I through in great style tonight.
Starters Aid Offense
Coach Hunt believes that Moffatt
and Loomis have earned the right to
start the contest against the Winged
"O." Both are fast, good shots, and
i work well together.
In the Olympic Club five, the Cards
will face the toughest opponents they
; have met so far this season. All are
| experienced players. Kennedy, Dixon,
Minor, and McHose, a former Stan
ford star, are all court veterans, hav
ing played together on the Club team
j for several seasons past. McHose and
Minor at the forward positions are ex
pected to furnish plenty of thrills for
the patrons. Ford is a newcomer.
If Stanford beats this team tonight,
von can bet your shirt on them against
; the Bears Saturday night.

When the Card basketball team
i takes the floor against the strong
' Olympic Club quintet here tonight,
they will start without the services of
three men who were instrumental in
the Trojan defeat at the hands of
Stanford Saturday.
Coach Husky Hunt will start Johnny
McCandless at center, and Phil Mof
fatt and Vard Loomis at the two for
ward positions. Reynolds and Captain
Rothert will hold down the guard
positions as usual.
Berg, Fawcett Out
The varsity squad returned from
; the South yesterday morning with
j two men, Vance Fawcett and Red
I Berg, the Card forward combination,
j both on the casualty list. Fawcett was
i suffering from a sprained ankle and
Berg was hobbling around with a pair
! of badly blistered feet. Although nei
ther is likely to play tonight, it is
probable that both will be in the line
up when the Cards tangle with the
Bears in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
;urday night.
McCandless, Moffatt, and Loomis,
, who will start the game, are all ex
perienced players and should give
the seasoned Winged "O" outfit a
j good battle. McCandless started the
season at center, but was replaced by
Hawkins because he couldn't seem
to find the basket. In practice he has
been showing improvement in thi3
department, so he should come
I through in great style tonight.
Starters Aid Offense
Coach Hunt believes that Moffatt
and Loomis have earned the right to
start the contest against the Winged
"O." Both are fast, good shots, and
i work well together.
