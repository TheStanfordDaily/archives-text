# SCOTCH DIALECT FOUND PROBLEM IN BARRIE PLAY
## 
### 
The difficulty of mastering a Scotch
dialect is the problem facing the cast
of Sir James Barrie's play, "What
Every Woman Knows." The Masquers'
play will be presented by Gordon
Davis to the campus February 8.
The first act of the Barrie drama
is laid in the home of the Wylies in
Scotland. Maggie's brothers, Alick,
David, and James Wylie, are planning
her future. The Wylie family is as
Scotch as can be, and Lionel Wal
ford, Herbert Wenig, and Arthur
Hurt, as the brothers, are studying
the Scotch dialect in preparation for
their roles.
Katherine Keho, who plays the
leading role of Maggie in the play,
has her Scotch accent well in hand.
From her previous appearance in the
.sophomore play last quarter, Miss
Kcho promises well for the part
which Maude Adams played so many
years
Difficulty with a Scotch accent is
not the only language problem of
"What Every Woman Knows." The
Countess de la Briere, played by
.Louise Buxton, speaks French inces
santly, and Maggie, too, learns to use
French conversation so she can be a
credit to John Shand, the rising young
English politician.
