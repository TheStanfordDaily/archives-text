# Rushing Methods Under Fire
## 
### 
Apropos of the tumult and the shouting over the suggested abolition
of sororities and the threatened intrusion of fraternity rushing into win
ter quarter, it is to be noted that other campi resound to the same or simi
lar yowlings. At colleges where the sodalitious controversy rages, it
appears from the student newspapers that dissatisfaction does not so
much attach to fraternity or sgrority life as to rushing methods. Ay!
there's the mud.
At Washington, the Daily labels its fraternity governing body "the
catch-as-catch-can Inter-Fraternity Council" and proceeds to recommend
that it emulate the University of Minnesota Council, which lays down a
fine of $500 or a penalty of secession of rushing privileges to houses
breaking the rules. Filching of dinner invitations after they had been
placed in mail boxes was the chief "irregularity" practiced by Minnesota
fraternities last year. The $500 fine is intended to stop that.
The Cornell Daily Sun, in turn, views with alarm the unfailing ability
of miscarried fraternity initiations to arouse sentiment against fraterni
ties. A Michigan honor society recently succeeded in scalding three of its
neophytes in an attempt to impress them with a proper degree of hu
mility ; this prank, linked in the public's mind with the Delta Kappa Epsi
lon disaster at the University of Texas not long ago, Wherein a pledge
died of shock, will cause a further bias against the fraternity system.
Prevention of such accidents which put fraternities in a bad light is
simply a matter of using common sense, the Sun says.
At Ohio Wesleyan University, the problem is stated by the Transcript
to be the breaking down of the prejudice and elimination of the stigma
which attach to the man who breaks his pledge, no matter how inconsid
erately or in how great inebriety it was made. Such a one is an outcast,
the subject of whispers when he approaches fraternity men.
Surveying the status of fraternities elsewhere, one can sec that Stan
ford is fairly well off in this respect. Initiations are no longer particu
larly brutal, although they are in many cases inane to a disgraceful
degree; and rushing is fairly honestly carried on in its regular period. A
good deal of illegal rushing goes on in winter quarter, which the Inter
fraternity Council seems to fail to come down hard enough on, but that
men are afraid to break their pledges is certainly not the case —many a
"sewed-up" nugget vanishes on Bidding Day.
Nevertheless, if Stanford fraternities hope to maintain the reputation
for integrity which they now possess, they should look to the need of
enforcing the rules against the under-cover rushing that prematurely
takes place.

Apropos of the tumult and the shouting over the suggested abolition
of sororities and the threatened intrusion of fraternity rushing into win
ter quarter, it is to be noted that other campi resound to the same or simi
lar yowlings. At colleges where the sodalitious controversy rages, it
appears from the student newspapers that dissatisfaction does not so
much attach to fraternity or sgrority life as to rushing methods. Ay!
there's the mud.
At Washington, the Daily labels its fraternity governing body "the
catch-as-catch-can Inter-Fraternity Council" and proceeds to recommend
that it emulate the University of Minnesota Council, which lays down a
fine of $500 or a penalty of secession of rushing privileges to houses
breaking the rules. Filching of dinner invitations after they had been
placed in mail boxes was the chief "irregularity" practiced by Minnesota
fraternities last year. The $500 fine is intended to stop that.
The Cornell Daily Sun, in turn, views with alarm the unfailing ability
of miscarried fraternity initiations to arouse sentiment against fraterni
ties. A Michigan honor society recently succeeded in scalding three of its
neophytes in an attempt to impress them with a proper degree of hu
mility ; this prank, linked in the public's mind with the Delta Kappa Epsi
lon disaster at the University of Texas not long ago, Wherein a pledge
died of shock, will cause a further bias against the fraternity system.
Prevention of such accidents which put fraternities in a bad light is
simply a matter of using common sense, the Sun says.
At Ohio Wesleyan University, the problem is stated by the Transcript
to be the breaking down of the prejudice and elimination of the stigma
which attach to the man who breaks his pledge, no matter how inconsid
erately or in how great inebriety it was made. Such a one is an outcast,
the subject of whispers when he approaches fraternity men.
Surveying the status of fraternities elsewhere, one can sec that Stan
ford is fairly well off in this respect. Initiations are no longer particu
larly brutal, although they are in many cases inane to a disgraceful
degree; and rushing is fairly honestly carried on in its regular period. A
good deal of illegal rushing goes on in winter quarter, which the Inter
fraternity Council seems to fail to come down hard enough on, but that
men are afraid to break their pledges is certainly not the case —many a
"sewed-up" nugget vanishes on Bidding Day.
Nevertheless, if Stanford fraternities hope to maintain the reputation
for integrity which they now possess, they should look to the need of
enforcing the rules against the under-cover rushing that prematurely
takes place.
