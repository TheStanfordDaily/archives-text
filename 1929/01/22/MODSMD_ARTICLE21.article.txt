While Mr. Emery's happy suggestion that the Daily be censored is
still fresh, let us pause to consider how admirably censorship is carried
out at Stanford. The Deans of Men and Women and the President have
the censorial privilege, yet that ancient instrument is rusty with disuse.
The Chaparral, a publication inherently likely to offend almost anybody
at almost any time, rates highly with the deans and the President, simply
because the editors will not print every joke they receive—or think of.
Certain stories in the Literary Magazine we have at times thought ought
to be wastebasketed, but not censored. As for the Daily, it has found
that students moan and howl about what it prints long before the faculty
chops.
Freedom of the press for which we may heartily give thanks!
