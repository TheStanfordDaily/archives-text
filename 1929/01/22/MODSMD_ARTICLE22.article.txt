# No Need Yet Seen for an A.G.W.S.

A handful of graduate women met yesterday to discuss the advisa
bility of organizing into a separate group. Nobody seemed to know what
the purpose should be or what type of organization should be formed.
There was a general attitude of unresponsiveness to any suggestions
offered.
If in future meetings graduate women should decide that a separate
organization would better accord with their interests, then they would
be wise to organize. However, they are now a part of the Associated
Women Students, and unless they have a definite aim, which they have
as yet been unable to find, there is no need for further organization.
Once again attention of contributors to Campus Opinion is called to
the fact that communications must be signed. Although letters may ap
pear anonymously or under an alias, the Daily will not undertake to
publish opinions of which the author is unknown.
The editorial staff will meet at 1 o'clock today.
The University of California and Folsom are indulging in a chess
contest via telegraph. This friendly rivalry between these two great state
institutions is a fine thing.
