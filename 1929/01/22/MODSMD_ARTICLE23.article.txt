A REFERENDUM
The Editor, Sir:
Lest campus opinions run riot on
this mutter of sororities I feel urged
to make something of an investi
gator's report.
1. In regard to the million-dollar be
quest which it was suggested might
be used for new dormitories, Dr. Wil
bur in a personal interview said that
the amount was uncertain and the
will itself entangled in litigation, so
that Dr. Lawrence's funds will not be
immediately available. However, new
dormitories are high up on the Uni
versity building program (rough plans
have already been drawn for a series
of quadrangles containing living
groups of different size), the adminis
tration is doing its best to procure
endowments, but nothing can be done
until these funds materialize —and he
implied that such gifts do not come
out of thin air
2. If it desired to be very radical
the administration could aim a death
blow at both fraternities and sorori
ties by refusing to rent land for their
houses.
3. Last winter after rushing, two
Row and two Roble women went to
Miss Yost a.nd asked her advice in
the matter of eliminating sororities
(the Dean is getting used to it, she
says). Her suggestion was this: pro
vided that the sentiment is now
strong enough on the Row to abolish
sororities (about four years ago a
vote was four to six in favor of re
taining them), each group would vol
untarily relinquish its charter, and its
house would be taken over by the

ON SORORITIES
University and put under the same
management as Roble. Women would
have their choice of living in the
Hall or in any one of the houses (and
there are some who insinuate that
without their Greek glamour certain
of the houses would be little in de
mand); readjustment at stated inter
vals would allow interchange and
prevent permanent cliques. Such an
arrangement, would be only tempor
ary, but in the event that Row women
voluntarily and decisively abolished
sororities Miss Yost believes that con
struction of adequate housing facili
ties for the whole campus would in
evitably be hastened.
4. The whole matter simply bolls
down to this: Do Stanford women
WANT to abolish sororities? It mat
ters little what alumni (especially
alumnae) think; the administration
evidently has decided not to force the
issue; Roble women can not act; the
men have their own problem. It is up
to the Row women alone to determine
their own opinion on the subject, by
an individual secret ballot.
Clearly the next step in the matter
so conveniently brought into the open
by Mr. Norman's bullsession is the
following: Pan-Hellenic as the or
ganization peculiar to the Row should
conduct a ballot of every Row woman
and find out exactly how much sup
port there is to a move for abolition
of sororities. With this information
agitation would either calm down for
lack of a point or be givea new in
centive toward definite action. May
we please have a vote?
—Maxine Cushing—Roble.

Miss Yost a.nd asked her advice in
the matter of eliminating sororities
(the Dean is getting used to it, she
says). Her suggestion was this: pro
vided that the sentiment is now
strong enough on the Row to abolish
sororities (about four years ago a
vote was four to six in favor of re
taining them), each group would vol
untarily relinquish its charter, and its
house would be taken over by the

ON SORORITIES
University and put under the same
management as Roble. Women would
have their choice of living in the
Hall or in any one of the houses (and
there are some who insinuate that
without their Greek glamour certain
of the houses would be little in de
mand); readjustment at stated inter
vals would allow interchange and
prevent permanent cliques. Such an
arrangement, would be only tempor
ary, but in the event that Row women
voluntarily and decisively abolished
sororities Miss Yost believes that con
struction of adequate housing facili
ties for the whole campus would in
evitably be hastened.
4. The whole matter simply bolls
down to this: Do Stanford women
WANT to abolish sororities? It mat
ters little what alumni (especially
alumnae) think; the administration
evidently has decided not to force the
issue; Roble women can not act; the
men have their own problem. It is up
to the Row women alone to determine
their own opinion on the subject, by
an individual secret ballot.
Clearly the next step in the matter
so conveniently brought into the open
by Mr. Norman's bullsession is the
following: Pan-Hellenic as the or
ganization peculiar to the Row should
conduct a ballot of every Row woman
and find out exactly how much sup
port there is to a move for abolition
of sororities. With this information
agitation would either calm down for
lack of a point or be givea new in
centive toward definite action. May
we please have a vote?
—Maxine Cushing—Roble.
A REFERENDUM
The Editor, Sir:
Lest campus opinions run riot on
this mutter of sororities I feel urged
to make something of an investi
gator's report.
1. In regard to the million-dollar be
quest which it was suggested might
be used for new dormitories, Dr. Wil
bur in a personal interview said that
the amount was uncertain and the
will itself entangled in litigation, so
that Dr. Lawrence's funds will not be
immediately available. However, new
dormitories are high up on the Uni
versity building program (rough plans
have already been drawn for a series
of quadrangles containing living
groups of different size), the adminis
tration is doing its best to procure
endowments, but nothing can be done
until these funds materialize —and he
implied that such gifts do not come
out of thin air
2. If it desired to be very radical
the administration could aim a death
blow at both fraternities and sorori
ties by refusing to rent land for their
houses.
