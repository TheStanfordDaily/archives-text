# MR. NORMAN'S REPLY TO MR. EMERY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to the undersigned that
Mr. Allen Emery, '17, became a bit
too excited and personal in his con
tribution —published yesterday under
Campus Opinion—to the discussion oC
the sorority problem at Stanford. I
can appreciate and admire the spirit
which impelled his criticism, but not
its manner. Some of his misstate
ments, I think, need answering:
Had Mr. Emery read the Bullses
sion in question (and his letter seems
to indicate that he did not) he might
have saved himself a number of mis
takes. Let him present proof, to begin
with, that the article was "untrue."
I am sorry that he considered it also
"unfair" by reason of its appearance
just after pledging, a time chosen by
the writer as being most appropriate
to a discussion of this sort. One pur
pose of the article was to arouse some
constructive consideration of the
Row-Roble situation. Results have

been chiefly disappointing.
"Comments I have heard from sen
sible Stanford alumni are to the ef
fect that this is simply a bid for
cheap publicity on the part of Mr.
Norman." It is regrettable that the
article in question, intended for Cam
pus readers only, should have reached
city papers, but it was not my doing
My name was signed to the article
only because that is a rule of the
Stanford Daily with regard to Bull
sessions. I don't crave unpopularity
But the purpose was worth the risk.
It would seem that the number of
folks on this planet who go about
solving problems in the ostrich fash
ion, at risk of having their plumage
amputated, is only equalled by the
number whose natures are so suspi
cious that they cannot ascribe sincere
motives to anyone.
Bloody but unbowed, and trusting
that the future will furnish sufficient
knitting for all concerned,
Sincerely, Winston Norman, 28.
