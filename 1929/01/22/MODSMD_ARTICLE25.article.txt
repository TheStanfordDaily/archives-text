# THE 						PRESIDENT OF ROBLE DEFENDS THE HALL
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
This is just another answer to Mr.
Norman's Bullsession entitled The
Caste System. I was very disappointed
to see his discussion in the paper the
day after pledging. It painted a very
black and disagreeable picture of
Roble for the women who had made
up their minds to stay in the Hall —
far blacker and more disagreeable
than life there really is. Roble is no
Bastille; it is very probably the freest
place on the cjmpus. It is the atti
tude of men like Mr. Norman that
label Roble as a thing to be shunned
as was the Bastille of old.
I credit the sororities on this cam
pus with having a democratic spirit
ai least equal to that which Mr. Nor
man claims of the fraternities. The
houses do not bar intercourse with
Roble; the old line of boundary be

1 tween Roble and the Row is not as
1 definite as it seemed even four years
jago; I think there is an almost unani
mous desire on the part of all the
Five Hundred to break down the arti
; licial barriers that separate House
from House and Row from Roble.
If Mr. Norman's idea is that Stan
ford is too small for sororities, I agree
with him. But I am very sorry to have
had presented to the campus and
I especially to the women who have
just gone through this rushing season
such an exaggerated idea of the situa
tion as a fraternity man has given
us. Such an article does not help the
heart-breaks; it creates or deepens
them. Finally I should like the privi
lege of telling the new women that
there is a democracy among the Stan
ford women which includes in it no
Bastille or thought of one.
