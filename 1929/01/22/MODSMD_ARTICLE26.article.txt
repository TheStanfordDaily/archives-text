# DISGUSTED AT THE PICTURE DISPLAY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
When I looked at the back page of
Monday's Dippy, I was disgusted at
seeing half of it taken up with "Cur
rent News Events In Pictures." Is
The Stanford Daily going to deterior
ate into a tabloid? Is it possible that
the readers of The Dippy are so lazy
that it is necessary to put the news
of the day before them with news
pictures? Or has The Dippy staff be
come so incompetent that it can find
nothing else to fill the space? To me
a good advertisement would be better

| than a group of irrelevant pictures.
Better still would be interviews with
a few of the leading men who visit
l the Bay Region; or even with those
who live near us. Often half the front
! page of The Crimson —an excellent
| college newspaper—is devoted to in
terviews. So I would like to suggest
1 that The Dippy might deign to offer
j its readers something of more value
and interest than pictures of Texas
beauties, divorcees, and backwoods
diplomats.
Yours truly, Dean Morrison.
