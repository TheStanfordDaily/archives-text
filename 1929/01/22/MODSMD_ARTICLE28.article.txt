Racing the Moon (and Winning). By
John Henry Mears. (New York:
Rae D. Henkle Company, Inc.)
This is the account of a race with
the moon around the world, in which
Luna was beaten by four days. Fif
teen years ago Mr. Mears made a
new record in circumnavigation of the
world by airplane, ship, and automo
bile, doing the trick in thirty-five
days. That record stood for thirteen
years, when Wells and Evans cut it
down by more than seven days.
At once Mears decided he must
win the championship again and be
gan working out methods and sched
ules. He soon decided that it could
bo done easily merely by making more
use of the airplane, and the fact
seemed to make it so much less of a
sporting proposition that for a time
he lost interest
Then one night the full moon seemed
to sneer a challenge at him and he
sprang to the task of beating its un
touched record of countless centuries.
From that moment he forgot what
other human beings had done or
might do and was absorbed by his
determination to circle the earth in
less time than the queen of the
heavens.
The story we remember from the
newspapers, how he started with Cap
tain Collyer as his pilot and Tail
Wind, a Sealyham terrier pup, as mas
cot on that journey around the globe
last summer which he completed in
a trifle over twenty-three and a half
days.
They crossed the two oceans by
steamship, but used an airplane for
crossing the continents. From start
to finish it was a marvelous adven
ture, and Mears has written a de
tailed account that is graphic and
vital. He was evidently in a state of

j tense emotion throughout the Jour
j ney, and he has injected this feeling
I into the narrative so that the reader
i is carried along in an atmosphere of
L apprehension and excitement.
The Constitution of the United States.
1 By Gaspar G. Bacon. (Cambridge:
' j Harvard University Press. $2.)
- ! Another book on the Constitution —
i it is simple, readable, and orthodox
i j to the last degree. This author holds
it to be apparent that the majority of
j the Supreme Court have always been
: j right, except in the Dred Scott case,
• where they were dead wrong. More
• I over, the court merely asserts against
I the will of the legislature "that of
! . the people," as declared in the Con
: J etitution."
l I That the people often do not know
i what they have thus declared until
the Supreme Court tells them what
[ they meant is too irrelevant a fact
s to be mentioned. By this system of
■ ; judicial review "we in America keep
I
. j the sovereignty in our own hands."
: ; The Supreme Court is only the mouth
• • piece of the people.
i ! The division of powers between
i the nation and the states must have
> been of divine origin, for the Federal
government was given only "an ir
! Ireducable minimum of functions." All
■ j other powers belong "normally" to the
1 ' states. It is, for example, "peculiarly
■ the province of the states to remedy
! j the evils of child labor, and any in
l : direct encroachment upon this right
: and duty is a serious assault upon
| our system of government." And so
' j on.
• | Many people who agree with Mr.
; Bacon will do so for other and more
■ j realistic reasons than those he ad
• ' vances; many people will violently
[ 1 disagree with him for equally good
! 1 reasons. —Clifford F. Weigle.
