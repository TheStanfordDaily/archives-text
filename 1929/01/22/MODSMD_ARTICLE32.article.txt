# CARD NINE FACES HARDEST SEASON IN WINTER GAMES
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
faces one of the most difficult sched
ules that they have had in years. Be
ginning next Saturday with Granat
Brothers, leading team in the San
Francisco Winter League, the Cards
will have a game every Wednesday
and Saturday until the middle of
spring quarter. There will be games
with three semi-pro and two club
teams before the regular conference
league starts.
During spring vacation, the varsity
will take the usual barnstorming'trip.
This year they have four contests
scheduled for the week. There will be
two with U.S.C. on March 26 and 27,
and two with U.C.L.A. on the 28th
and 29th. This trip obviously means
real work for the team, as four games
on five consecutive days is a task
worthy of any college organization.
For the first time in many years,
Coach Harry Wolter has more in
fieldere than outfielders. There are
twenty-one candidates for the inner
diampnd positions, whereas only four
teen men are seeking places in the
outfield. Seven pitchers and three
catchers complete the squad. Wolter
is still lamenting the fact that he has
not yet found a left-handed pitcher,
tor nearly the whole Bear varsity
bats from the port side.

Jan. 26 —Granat Brothers
