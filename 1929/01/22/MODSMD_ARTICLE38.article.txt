# SPORTS OF 1929

It's Nurmi, the "Finn, Ag'in"! The
"Phlying Phantom" is at it once more,
and expects to smash records from
now until the Olympic Games in 1932,
all the way from Brooklyn to Los An
geles. Soon he'll be racing Leo Ler
mond in Boston, and perhaps at the
Millrose Games on February Sth we'll
find him arrayed against Wide, Con
ger, and Purje, the last-named being
Finland's latest gift to America — a
man who, incidentally, defeated Nur
mi in the Olympic tryouts in his na
tive land in 1928. Nurmi, according to
those closest to him, wants to win the
Marathon at the 1932 Olympic Games
in Los Angeles, and will remain in
this country until that time.
The A.A.U., having taken Paavo's
"Finn-ger" prints, as it were, and

O.K'd his latest tour, will see to it
that more Finn-esse and less Finn
ance is used by those who deal with
the Abo Antelope during his present
stay in America.
Abo, Nurmi's home town, was
founded by Eric the Saint in the
twelfth century, used to be the capitol
of Finland, and the Russians and the
Swedes signed a Peace treaty there
in 1743. Finland —called Suomi, or
"Swampy Land," by the Finns them
selves —exports mainly timber, butter
—and' distance runners to other coun
tries. Certainly that small Northern
Republic has Finnicized the art of dis
tance running. The Finns scored
eleven places in the five distance runs
at the last Olympics. They have plenty
of others besides Nurmi.
