AURORA BOREALIS
Mr. Enoch Bagshaw, who —accord-
ing to latest reports—is still head
football coach at the University of
| Washington, has discovered to his in
; tense disgust that a long-delayed arc
tic storm has broken about his head,
i The storm certainly is an arctic one:
i it is large, it is noisy, and it is seri
ous —so they say. But it undoubtedly
| is not cold. Were the ten thousand or
so Washington students and the im
posing number of assorted boards,
councils, and committees each to
place a thermometer under a respec
tive collar, the amount of good glass
tubing ruined would be phenomenal.
It seems that the Washing
tonians have tired of their name
—the Purple Tornado, outstand
ing threat of the Pacific Coast
Conference. The Northerners,
quite naturally, would prefer to
ruin some of their opponents,
rather than merely menace them.
And since many of their recent
rivals have gone away unscathed,
action is demanded. Such as—Out
with Mr. Bagshaw!
The demand is not unusual nor un
precedented. Coaches, like doctors, are
hired to do certain things. If they
don't do them, their reputations fall
accordingly.
Unfortunately, however, there seems
to be a wide variance of opinion on
1 the Washington campus. The student
body of control has already decided
that Mr. Bagshaw is to leave. The
faculty athletic committee has reached
the decision that Mr. Bagshaw will
I spend three years more teaching the
young Huskies how to play football.
President Spencer, not know
ing whether to side with the stu
dents or to thumb his nose at
< them, is at a total loss. He has
called for a lawyer; but it takes
more than a bar certificate to set
tle a football argument.
The Washington Huskies have had
but meagre pickings in the conference
races to date. In 1924, when Stanford
broke the regime of the California
"Wonder Teams," the Huskies finished
in third place. But in 1925, led by
that hectic wonder of football, "little
George" W r ilson, they mopped up
Stanford for conference honors.
The flood broke in 1926. Stan
ford finished on the top, while
Washington landed in fifth place.
In 1927 the Huskies made a
noble bid for fame, but the breaks
were on leave from the Seattle
gridiron. California fell before
the onrush of the Washington
ians, 6-0. But Stanford handed
them a heart-breaking 13-7 de
feat. U.S.C. took Pat Wilson, idol
of the Husky fans, out on the
opening kickoff, and then gloated
in an undeserved 33-13 triumph.
Last year, the Huskies, hit heavily
by graduation but led by Chuck Car
roll, met California on a Washington
mud field —and lost, 6-0. They came
to Palo Alto, and after outcharging,
S outgaining, and outpassing the Cardi
nals, left the field on the short end
j of the score.
; And now —1929. The Northerners

have only a bleak past to give them
consolation. For the future, they have
Stombaugh, a line of medium experi
ence —already griping in an in tea-fra
ternity war, and Mr. Bagshaw.—
maybe. —Milton Silverman.

The Washington Huskies have had
but meagre pickings in the conference
races to date. In 1924, when Stanford
broke the regime of the California
"Wonder Teams," the Huskies finished
in third place. But in 1925, led by
that hectic wonder of football, "little
George" W r ilson, they mopped up
Stanford for conference honors.
The flood broke in 1926. Stan
ford finished on the top, while
Washington landed in fifth place.
In 1927 the Huskies made a
noble bid for fame, but the breaks
were on leave from the Seattle
gridiron. California fell before
the onrush of the Washington
ians, 6-0. But Stanford handed
them a heart-breaking 13-7 de
feat. U.S.C. took Pat Wilson, idol
of the Husky fans, out on the
opening kickoff, and then gloated
in an undeserved 33-13 triumph.
Last year, the Huskies, hit heavily
by graduation but led by Chuck Car
roll, met California on a Washington
mud field —and lost, 6-0. They came
to Palo Alto, and after outcharging,

AURORA BOREALIS

football coach at the University of

; tense disgust that a long-delayed arc
tic storm has broken about his head,
i The storm certainly is an arctic one:
i it is large, it is noisy, and it is seri
ous —so they say. But it undoubtedly
| is not cold. Were the ten thousand or
so Washington students and the im
posing number of assorted boards,
councils, and committees each to
place a thermometer under a respec
tive collar, the amount of good glass
tubing ruined would be phenomenal.
It seems that the Washing
tonians have tired of their name
—the Purple Tornado, outstand
ing threat of the Pacific Coast
Conference. The Northerners,
quite naturally, would prefer to
ruin some of their opponents,
rather than merely menace them.
And since many of their recent
rivals have gone away unscathed,
action is demanded. Such as—Out
with Mr. Bagshaw!
The demand is not unusual nor un
precedented. Coaches, like doctors, are
hired to do certain things. If they
don't do them, their reputations fall
accordingly.
