# RECRUITS NEEDED AS YEARLING NINE FACES FIRST GAME
## 
### 
Coach Ernie Nevers will soon be
pending out a distress signal for
freshman baseball unless more men
turn out. As the roster now stands,
there isn't a single outfielder or a
catcher. If more men do not report
lor baseball Nevers will have to make
over some good pitchers into out
fielders or catchers. There are only
fifteen men now out for the frosh
team; these are all infielders and
pitchers.
If pitchers alone can make a team,
the frosh should have a winning out
fit, as Nevers has an unusual amount
of good material. McLane, McGary,
Spence, Goedel, and Waterman all
look like good moundsmen.
White and Fox look like the best
infielders on the squad. The former is
the best hitter on the field, and a con
sistent fielder as well. Fox has had
quite a bit of experience around first
base, and handles the ball nicely.
Earsomini looks to be the best man
at second, but he is a pretty weak
hitter and Nevers is hard pressed for
consistent batsmen.
The frosh have their first game on
January 29, against Mission High
from San Francisco. Ordinarily this
would not be a hard contest, but the
small turnout will place the Cards on
the field under a handicap.
