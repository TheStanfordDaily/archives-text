## 
### 
Second-round arguments in the
Moot Court competition will start to
night when two eases will be heard
in the Law building. Linnemun and
' Newton meet Draper and Vincenti in
1 Room 12 at 7 o'clock before Professor
j C. B. Whittier, and Hamlyn and Hiatt
I oppose Call and Armour in Room 10
. at 8 o'clock with Professor Stanley
Morrison presiding.
i Members of the Moot Court board
I believe that the new procedure will
; be more interesting for spectators this
; quarter than last, since the cases are
j of the type that are heard in superior
; courts instead of appeals.
