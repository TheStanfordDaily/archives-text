# Richard Washburn Child Declares Mussolini Has No Imperial Policy
## Diplomat Sees Solution of Reparation Problems In Near Future 
### PHILIP STOCKTON 
"Mussolini has no imperialistic pol
icy," declared Richard Washburn
Child in an interview given to the
Stanford Daily yesterday, "for he al
ready has territories in Africa to
colonize and develop." Mr. Child, one
of our foremost diplomats, has repre
sented the United States at the
Genoa and Lausanne conferences and
until recently was United States Am
bassador to Italy. He is speaking to
night in San Francisco at the Scot
tish Bite Auditorium on "Mussolini —
Man of Action."
"The economic progress of Italy
under Mussolini is unquestioned. He
has greatly reduced unemployment
and the workmen are satisfied with
their jobs. He has cut bureaucrats off
the government payroll by the tens
of thousands. It is well to remember
that with all the repressive measures
Mussolini is supposed to have taken,
he has conducted a political revolu
tion without putting a single person
to death. Contrast this record with,
say, Russia's wholesale executions."
In speaking of the Kellogg treaty,
Child pronounced it valuable as a
psychological gesture toward world
peace. To a question concerning our
cruiser program, he replied, "There
is no possibility of a naval race be
tween Great Britain and the United
States. Each nation will build inde
pendently for its own needs.
"Without a question, a reparations
settlement will be made between
France and Germany at the forthcom
ing meeting of experts. Our experi
ence in the course of the debt settle
ments goes to prove that a single
small group is more effective in deal
ing with this question than a large
conference of politicians.
"If any idea of a League of Na
tions is to be successful it will be suc
cessful first on a zone basis. There is
today a definite tendency toward a
United States of Europe. In the New
World we are being drawn closer and
closer to our Latin American neigh
bors by our bond of common political
and economic interests."
