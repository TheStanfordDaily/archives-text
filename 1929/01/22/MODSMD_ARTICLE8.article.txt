i committee report.
Two points will be voted upon on
i printed ballots during the assembly.
The first is whether the name "Honor

it shall be changed to "Honor Code."
"By some the word 'system' is thought
to bo material and to lessen the seri
cusness of the attitude of the stu
dents toward honor," said Peck, in
explaining this question. "Some think
that this difficulty will be done away
with if the word 'code' is used in
j stead." The sc'cond question to be
voted upon by secret ballot is whether
the names of violators shall be pub

] lished by the Councils. A majority of
rhe committee was not in favor of
publishing the names of offenders, but
it was decided to have it settled by
| popular vote.
i The wording of the Honor Pledge
! has been revised, and from now on
each student will have to sign it only
once, at the time he enters the Uni
versity. In connection with the re
port, an exposition of the Honor Sys
tem and its purposes will be read,
and it is the suggestion of the com
mittee, according to Peck, that this
exposition be incorporated in the
I A.S.S.U. Handbook, and published in
the Daily from time to time as a
reminder of what the System really
j means.
The committee has recommended in
