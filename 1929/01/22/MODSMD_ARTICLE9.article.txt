Displaying a vastly improved offense,
El Toro soundly trounced Delta Tau
Delta yesterday afternoon in the opening
game of round three in the mural basket
ball tourney. Krause led the attack for
the "flying bulls" by sinking in 10 points.
Burrel played a good game at center for
the club team and looped in a couple of
nice baskets. Outstanding for Delta Tau
Delta were "Bob" King, of Olympic
Game fame, and Crary.
Breakers Win Easily
The Breakers didn't even get a good
sweat up last night when they walked
all over a weak Encina IE outfit to win
by a one-sided score. The club quintet
started the scoring in the first minute of
play, when J. Cook sank a long one
from the center of the court. S. Cook
was the "eagle eye" of the contest with
16 tallies to his credit. But the Breakers
missed enough sucker shots to have at
least tripled the score. Goldsmith played
his usual good game at running guard
for the winners.
Upsetting the dope and keeping the
crowd in a fit of chuckles at all times, the
A.T.O.'s nosed out Encina 5 in a basket
hall comedy full of spectacular fumbles.
! Both squads handled the ball as though
I it were a "hot potato." Boomer, A.T.O.
forward, furnished the real thrills of the
fumble fest when he looped in a couple
of one-handed baskets from quite difficult
angles. Fox also fumbled well for the
victors. The only player who could hit
the basket with any consistency was Zai
ser of Encina 5, who was high point man
with 7 tallies.
Phi Sig's Surprise
Phi Sigma Kappa broke into the win
| column by out-roughing the Alpha Sigs
Ito win by a 15 to 11 score. Muller, next
»
I year's football captain, featured the game
with some classy dribbling, besides scor
j ing all of his team's points. Thompson,
| at forward, starred for the Phi Sigs and
sank 9 points for the winning squad. The
j score at half time was 6 to 4 in favor
| of the Phi Sigs.
In a closely contested game Theta Xi
managed to heat out El Capitan by a two
j point margin. The final score was 14
to 12. E. Smith was the outstanding play
er on the floor and made four baskets for
the fraternity team. Worsley played a
good floor game for the winners, as did
Van Nuys of El Capitan.
Encina 3W won from Encina 1W by
forfeit as only four of the latter team's
players showed up in suits. Both Zeta
Psi and Phi Delta Theta lost by for
feits, when neither squad put in an ap
pearance.

El Toro soundly trounced Delta Tau
Delta yesterday afternoon in the opening
game of round three in the mural basket
ball tourney. Krause led the attack for
the "flying bulls" by sinking in 10 points.
Burrel played a good game at center for
the club team and looped in a couple of
nice baskets. Outstanding for Delta Tau
Delta were "Bob" King, of Olympic
Game fame, and Crary.
Breakers Win Easily
The Breakers didn't even get a good
sweat up last night when they walked
all over a weak Encina IE outfit to win
by a one-sided score. The club quintet
started the scoring in the first minute of
play, when J. Cook sank a long one
from the center of the court. S. Cook
was the "eagle eye" of the contest with
16 tallies to his credit. But the Breakers
missed enough sucker shots to have at
least tripled the score. Goldsmith played
his usual good game at running guard
for the winners.
Upsetting the dope and keeping the
crowd in a fit of chuckles at all times, the
A.T.O.'s nosed out Encina 5 in a basket
hall comedy full of spectacular fumbles.
! Both squads handled the ball as though
I it were a "hot potato." Boomer, A.T.O.
forward, furnished the real thrills of the
fumble fest when he looped in a couple
of one-handed baskets from quite difficult
angles. Fox also fumbled well for the
victors. The only player who could hit
the basket with any consistency was Zai
ser of Encina 5, who was high point man
with 7 tallies.
Phi Sig's Surprise
Phi Sigma Kappa broke into the win

Ito win by a 15 to 11 score. Muller, next

I year's football captain, featured the game
with some classy dribbling, besides scor

| at forward, starred for the Phi Sigs and
sank 9 points for the winning squad. The
j score at half time was 6 to 4 in favor
| of the Phi Sigs.
In a closely contested game Theta Xi
managed to heat out El Capitan by a two
j point margin. The final score was 14

er on the floor and made four baskets for
the fraternity team. Worsley played a
good floor game for the winners, as did
Van Nuys of El Capitan.
Encina 3W won from Encina 1W by
forfeit as only four of the latter team's
players showed up in suits. Both Zeta
