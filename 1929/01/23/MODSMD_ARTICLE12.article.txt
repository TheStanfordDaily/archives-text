###

Lawrence, who recently bequeathed
approximately $2,000,000 to the Uni
versity, has not been located, accord
ing to a statement issued yesterday
by President Hay Lyman Wilbur.
> Attorneys are searching for the
estate but have not been able to lo
cate anything but a small portion of
the fortune which Dr. Lawrence was
supposed to have possessed.
According to the provisions of the
will, Stanford University would re
ceive $1,000,000 without reservation
and is also entitled to half the re
siduary estate which would amount

Administrator Appointed
There is some question as to
whether Dr. Lawrence had as much
of an estate as he thought he had.
His right to a forty per cent interest
in a $10,000,000 petroleum refining
process has been questioned and a
long litigation may ensue. Curt von
Boettinlier, executor of the Lawrence
estate, has said that lack of legal
proof of Dr. Lawrence's ownership of
40 per cent of the invention and his
own inability to get the widely scat
tered heirs together to take action
made the appointment of a temporary
administrator necessary.
The Surrogate's Court in New York
appointed the American Trust Com
pany of New York temporary admin
istrator.
The executor said that Dr. Law
rence, just before his death, stated
that lie owned the oil refining process
in partnership with a Samuel B.
B Coley who had purchased it from
George B. Gifford, the inventor.
Has Made Other Gifts
Dr. Lawrence was graduated from
Stanford in 1892 with the first class.
He was famous as a neurologist and
was the author of many medical
books.
In recent years Dr. Lawrence made
Stanford a number of small dona
tions. Two years ago he gave $5000
for the purpose of having a history
of the University written.
Dr. Lawrence died on December 29,
1925, in New York, from pneumouia.

There is some question as to
whether Dr. Lawrence had as much
of an estate as he thought he had.
His right to a forty per cent interest
in a $10,000,000 petroleum refining
process has been questioned and a
long litigation may ensue. Curt von
Boettinlier, executor of the Lawrence
estate, has said that lack of legal
proof of Dr. Lawrence's ownership of
40 per cent of the invention and his
own inability to get the widely scat
tered heirs together to take action
made the appointment of a temporary
administrator necessary.
The Surrogate's Court in New York
appointed the American Trust Com
pany of New York temporary admin
istrator.
The executor said that Dr. Law
rence, just before his death, stated
that lie owned the oil refining process
in partnership with a Samuel B.
B Coley who had purchased it from
George B. Gifford, the inventor.
Has Made Other Gifts
Dr. Lawrence was graduated from
Stanford in 1892 with the first class.
He was famous as a neurologist and
was the author of many medical
books.
In recent years Dr. Lawrence made
Stanford a number of small dona
tions. Two years ago he gave $5000
for the purpose of having a history
of the University written.
Dr. Lawrence died on December 29,
1925, in New York, from pneumouia.
The fortune of Dr. George Alfred
Lawrence, who recently bequeathed
approximately $2,000,000 to the Uni
versity, has not been located, accord
ing to a statement issued yesterday
by President Hay Lyman Wilbur.
> Attorneys are searching for the
estate but have not been able to lo
cate anything but a small portion of
the fortune which Dr. Lawrence was
supposed to have possessed.
According to the provisions of the
will, Stanford University would re
ceive $1,000,000 without reservation
and is also entitled to half the re
siduary estate which would amount
to $1,250,000.
