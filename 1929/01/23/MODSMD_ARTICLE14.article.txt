# Italy's Dictator Is Chief Danger To Peace--Eddy
## Lecturer Says China Is Not Danger Zone; Russia Is Social Laboratory 
### 
"Mussolini has proved himself the j
chief individual menace to peace in j
Europe," declared Sherwood Eddy in
his lecture last night in the Assem- j
bly Hall on "Danger Zones of the !
World —Italy, China, and Russia."
"The Dictator has done all a man, I
or superman, could do to avert revo- j
•lution in Italy, establish law and [
order, promote industry and provide
an efficient government—at the cost
of taking the liberties of forty-two
million men. After his death, Italy will
again sink into chaos, and must slow* !
ly rebuild a new democracy."
Eddy declared China at present is |
not in the category of danger zones.|
After seventy years of war, she is at 1
last united under her own national i
government. The aim of the great
Sun-Yat-Sen, whose watchword was I
"Liberty, Equality, and Justice," has
been achieved and China is safe.
"Russia is a sort of laboratory for I
social experiments," he averred.
"They have instituted a severe
abridgement of liberties; they are ;
dogmatic, unscientific, blatant athe- j
ists. They foster the belief that the
end justifies the means and that the
world must be changed through a
great world revolution. But 1 have
never seen the leaders of a people
ho rise above private or party pur
poses and indulge in such a passion j
for sharing, devoting all their inter
ests to help the workers and the
poor."
