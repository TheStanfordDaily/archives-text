# SINGLE JANITOR SHOWER IN STATE OF 'OSIFICATION,' COMMITTEE HEARS
## 
### 
Spud Harder, senior member of the
Executive Committee, presented a let
ter sent to him by one of the janitors
; on the campus at a meeting of the
j Committee last night. Harder was
addressed in the letter as a member
of the Civic Improvement Associa
tion, and was asked to bring the mat
ter of the janitors' living conditions
before the body.
The Daily on January 8 stated that
"one bath serves for 40 shivering
men," and concerning this the janitor
in his letter writes: "Permit me to
| state that the ONE bath is in a state
of osification (sic), or in other words,
the shower head has seen better days,
land should be retired from active ser
j vice, due to the fact that the perfora
tions in the shower-head are nearly
all closed tip, and only 2 or 3 holes
are permitted to let tlie water es
cape."
Later in his letter he says, "Recent
ly several times when the janitors
have come home weary and tired after
9 p.m. and have sat down in their

I cold rooms to read the daily paper or
magazine, the electric liplits have
gone out, and the janitors have had
to go to bed by means of a flash light
or the use of matches.
"And yet Mr. Brown is not forget
: fill to deduct the sum of $35.00 per
! month from each janitor, 45 of them,
making a total of $1575.00, and all
this for so-called accommodations."
The janitor quotes Mr. Brown as
| saying that "he doesn't want any jani
tor to make a kick for the man who
does kick will kick himself out of a
i job," and that "he has no love for
the janitors and doesn't want the
J janitors to have any love for him, and
! that all he wants is to set the work
; out of the men.
"The place in general is a disgrace
1 to the Stanford University and dras
j tic measures should immediately be
j taken to remedy all and every defect."
Detailed information concerning the
i living conditions was included in the
letter, which was read before the
i Executive Committee by Harder.
