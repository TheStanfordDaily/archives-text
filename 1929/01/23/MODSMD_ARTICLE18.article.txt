# Sorority Status May Face Vote
## 
### 
Ellen Woerner, president of Pan-
Hellenic, and Janet Harris, president
of Associated Women Students, were
interviewed yesterday concerning the
possibility of having sorority women
vote 011 the abolition of sororities.
This action was suggested in a Cam
pus Opinion in yesterday's Daily.
Ellen Woerner refused to make a
statement regarding the possibility of
voting on the question. She explained
that she would confer with Dean Mary
Yost today and would be in position
to make a statement after the con
ference.
Janet Harris declared the move
ment toward the abolition of sorori
ties should come from the Row wo
men. Roble women can do very little.
She also said that she, in her posi
tion as President of A.W.S., had prac
tically nothing to do with the matter
and that Pan-Hellenic organization
was in full control of the movement.
