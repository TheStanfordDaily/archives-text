# CARDINALS TRIM OLYMPIC CAGERS BY 32-27 SCORE
## Card Second String Displays Strength in Game; Only Two Regulars See Action Nip McHose Stars for Club Team; Don Tyler Scores Nine Points for Stanford 
### ANSON REEDER 
j The Stanford basketball team,
j minus the services of three of its
i regulars, defeated the Olympic Club
! quintet here last night in a listless
j game, 32-27.
At least it seemed like a listless
[game after seeing the Cards play
I such close contests with Santa Clara
and St. Mary's during the last fort
: night. The Winged "O" did not have
j the team they were reputed to have,
j and it is easy to see why they have
been unable to go through the season
undefeated. It is not on a par with
the cage squad which they have pre
sented during the last three or four
| years.
Tyler Is "Find"
Coach Husky Hunt found out one
thing from his experiments last night,
Tyler, former Menlo Junior College
star, who has been tried at nearly
all the positions on the court, is one
of the best basket-shooters he has on
the squad. Replacing Loomis at one
of the forward positions early in the
first half, Tyler proceeded to give the
game what little excitement it had by
: his fast floor-work and accurate bas
ket-shooting. He and McHose, former
Card star and now a member of the
Poststreeters squad, were the fastest
| men on the court.
A noticeable improvement in the
| Cards' new quick-breaking offense
was evident, as was the work of the
i guards on the defense. Captain Roth
ert, Reynolds, and Tampcke all played
| a great game at the defense positions
I recovering the ball off the backboard
and breaking up the short passes of
the visitors under the basket time and
time again. If they play the same
kind of a game Saturday night the
Bears will be forced to shoot at long
range.
Score of Personal Fouls
"Nip" McHose of the Olympics was
I high-point man for the night with
i four field goals and two free throws
for a total of ten markers. Tyler was
next with nine. It is interesting to
note that there was a total of twenty
| personal fouls committed in last
| night's fray, eight by Stanford and
twelve by the Club team. Three of
those on the Olympics were double
fouls, as was one on the Cards, total
ing twenty-four attempts at free
