# The 						Honor System at Stanford
## 
### 
(l'rom the report of the committee for investigation of the Honor
System.)
Honorable conduct in academic work is the spirit of conduct at Stan
ford University.
Such is the fiat of the Associated Students; upon it rest both the
tradition of honor and the machinery by which offenders of the tradition
are brought to an accounting.
Defined, honorable conduct means "the refraining from giving or
receiving unpermitted aid in examinations, class exercises, reports, or any
other work that is to be used by the instructor as a basis of grading." It
is the antithesis of cheating; so defined, it is to be recognized, even by
those unfamiliar with the Stanford Honor System, as simply the code of
a gentleman.
Every Stanford student subscribes to the spirit of honorable conduct
when he first registers in the University. In his first registration book is
included a statement which he is expected to sign, to wit:
"I hereby acknowledge that I am fully aware of the fact that
honorable conduct in academic work—i. e., the refraining from
giving or receiving unpermitted aid in examinations, class exercises,
reports, or any other work that is to be used by the instructor as a
basis of grading—is the spirit of conduct in this University.
(Signed) "
On every examination book appears:
HONORABLE CONDUCT
in academic work is the spirit of conduct in this University.
SUGGESTIONS FOR CONDUCT
1. Occupy alternate seats where possible.
2. When in doubt as to the meaning of a question, consult the
instructor. He will be found in his office.
. Inasmuch as enforcement of the Honor System is the concern of
everyone (for under the competitive grading system a grade bettered by
unfair means raises the class average), it is the interest and the duty of
a student to proceed against a cheater, once detected. Accordingly, the
Associated Students recommend the following course of action:
Tap on your desk with your pen, in order to warn the one cheating
that he is discovered. It is his place to leave the examination room with
out turning in his paper. You should investigate to see whether he com
plies. If he turns in his paper, then you should report him to the Council.
If upon trying the case, the Council finds the offender guilty, he is
automatically suspended from the University.
If he does not turn in his paper, there is no need of further prosecu
tion, for it is considered that by forfeiting his chance for a grade he has
not completed the act of cheating.
The existence and enforcement of the Honor System rest with every
student. The institution was originally wrested by the students from the
faculty as a substitute for the proctor system. It has at times reached a
high peak of effectiveness, and although it is not now dangerously ailing,
it needs renewed support. The committee pleads that this be given.
