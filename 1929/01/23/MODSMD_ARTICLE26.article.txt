Rooters' tickets for the first California-Stanford basketball game will
be on sale from 10 to 12 and from 1:30 to 5 o'clock today in the Asso
ciated Students office at the Old Union. The rooter's ticket sale will be
held only one day, but the same tickets which will sell today for fifty
cents will retail for $1 tomorrow, under the title of reserved seats.
Stanford was allotted only 1000 seats for the game. Of these, 250
are in the regular rooting section while the remainder are reserved seats
in the balcony, directly above the rooting section. Since the early buyers
get the best seats, and since it will undoubtedly be impossible to get any
thing except standing room the night of the game, students are urged to
buy today. Bring A.S.S.U. cards.
Two ancient rivals, both undefeated and both aspiring for a basket
ball championship, will be playing the first game of their P>ig Series.
California is confidently expecting to regain the title which it held for
many years previous to last year. Stanford isn't saying what it intends
to do, but its team has demonstrated what it is capable of doing. What
could be more thrilling?
