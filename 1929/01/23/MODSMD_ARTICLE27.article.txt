# The 						Pot of Gold Disappears

### 
Sad is the word received by Dr. Wilbur that the estate of Dr. George 1
Alfred Lawrence, donor of a million dollars or more to the University,
cannot be located. 1 low can the theater, the new women's gym, le ncw
dormitories, be built; the medical school enlarged; or laboratories be
equipped ?
The apparent loss of the money will well nigh take the heart out of
some of the department heads who, with the melon in sight, were hoping
to boost their budgets just a leetle. It certainly quashes Miss Cushing's
proposal to to build new dormitories for the women. And it surely de-1
stroys our faith in high finance. But after all it is likely that the missing
stocks, bonds, or coupons (whatever they are) will show up at some
time or other, and then the willing spenders may again commence to plan
how the money ought to be disposed of.
