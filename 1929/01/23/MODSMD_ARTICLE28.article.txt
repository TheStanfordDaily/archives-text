## SORORITIES, FRATERNITIES INEVITABLE 
### 
Abolish the "caste system" and pro- i
vide small living groups for all Stan- j I
ford women. This is the substance of , i
Winston Norman's argument on the i
! revived Hall-Row enigma.
Abolish six and replace it with half, i
a dozen. Mr. Norman contradicts him- 1
self. What, if not a "caste system," i
would small living groups be? How ;
would this move further democracy I
among the student body? It would
not. 1
Whether by birth, wealth, mental 1
endowment, or personal achievement 1
men are classified, rated, placed on j:
different levels. Democracy is an i i
idealistic concept. That the abolition j (
of sororities or fraternities would es- j i
tablish democracy here is beyond
probability. ]
This is not a plea for the Row. Look (
over the list of alumni and it will bo i
seen that the Row is not the mark of 1
excellence or the guarantee of future j 1
success. For the present it is a classi- ; r
fication and a superficial, collegiate
one. Beyond the campus its import- i
ance dwindles. 1
Freshmen imbued with the philo- f
sophy of College Humor and Percy \
Marks believe that their success in
the University and their standing p
among their fellows are dependent r
upon their moving to the Row in i
sophomore year. Let these same fresh- j a
men analyze the situation, look past j

the immediate present, and they will
be sanely disillusioned. They will see
the actual place of the fraternity in
the scheme of things.
Relating sororities and lock-out
rules to the mental status of Stanford
women, Mr. Norman said, "They are
mentally imprisoned." Free-thinking
and the capacity to be individual in
thought and action are a far cry from
living in or out of sororities and
farther from the hours required for
women by the University. Undoubted
ly the system is onerous and not be
fitting intelligent women, but likewise
it seems beside the point of abolition
or maintenance of sororities, not to
mention mental capability.
The sanest, most practical comment
made on the situation to date is con
tained in Maxine Cushing's letter to
the Daily in yesterday's paper. If
women want living groups with or
without Greek letters, who cares?
They do. Let them decide.
The "broken hearts" of freshmen,
if they exist, may well be kept whole
by correctly informing these same
freshmen, before they enter the Uni
versity, about the Hall-Row values.
Fraternities, sororities, living
groups are undemocratic; such is their
nature: the exclusion of many to
inclusion of a few. Nevertheless they
are inevitable. Make the most of it.
