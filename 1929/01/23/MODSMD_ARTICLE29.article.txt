## FIGHTING WINDMILLS AGAIN

The Editors, Sir and Madam:
Now that this woman problem is
assuming properly humorous propor
tions, let an old gonfalonier air his
rabid views.
In the first place let me mention
the fact that since Messer Norman's
first article (mebbe his second) no
one has even touched on the most im
portant phase of the confab —con-
venience. Why do men prefer to call
up a house for a date? Because they
don't, if they call up during a meal
hour, when the dear girl is most apt
to be around, meet with a blank at
the other end of the line; because
they don't have to run the gamut of
a dozen sponsorial and guardianorial
(if you will permit) eyes, and the
wondering gaze of two or three girls
each of whom is wondering why he
isn't taking her out tonight; because
if he doesn't want to go someplace
that particular evening, he's not up

I against the problem of finding six
j square feet of privacy.
The last-mentioned difficulty is
| more than a matter of convenience—
,it may be a matter of morals and
: virtue —tsk! tsk! Consider well all the j
| arguments in favor of the home and i
fireside, how much better for the !
young folk it is to stay at home in
! stead of chasing out to these horrible
1 speakeasies, and dog-dramas of the
modern age, or tearing about the
: country in high-powered motor cars,
killing chickens, and endangering the !
life of who-knows-how-many women
and children. It is this kind of an
existence that those who would teach
us to be better men and women de
plore.
Is it not better, then, to have a !
! more home-like place for the young !
j men and women of this campus to
j meet, so as to obviate the necessity
! of such wild goings-on?
—Don Quixote, again.

portant phase of the confab —con-
venience. Why do men prefer to call
up a house for a date? Because they
don't, if they call up during a meal
hour, when the dear girl is most apt
to be around, meet with a blank at
the other end of the line; because
they don't have to run the gamut of
a dozen sponsorial and guardianorial
(if you will permit) eyes, and the
wondering gaze of two or three girls
each of whom is wondering why he
isn't taking her out tonight; because
if he doesn't want to go someplace
that particular evening, he's not up

I against the problem of finding six
j square feet of privacy.
The last-mentioned difficulty is
| more than a matter of convenience—
,it may be a matter of morals and
: virtue —tsk! tsk! Consider well all the j
| arguments in favor of the home and i
fireside, how much better for the !
young folk it is to stay at home in
! stead of chasing out to these horrible
1 speakeasies, and dog-dramas of the
modern age, or tearing about the
: country in high-powered motor cars,
killing chickens, and endangering the !
life of who-knows-how-many women
and children. It is this kind of an
existence that those who would teach
us to be better men and women de
plore.
Is it not better, then, to have a !
! more home-like place for the young !
j men and women of this campus to
j meet, so as to obviate the necessity
! of such wild goings-on?
—Don Quixote, again.
