# HONOR SYSTEM CONTROVERSY "ASSININE"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to the writer that this
whole controversy about the honor
systems may be classified briefly as
unnecessary, almost assinine, imma
terial, and insulting to the intelli
gence of a Stanford freshman —let
alone a senior!
But of all this conversation, which
I have so named thru delicacy, the
most decidedly ridiculious is the fact
that a student assembly has been ac
tually called to consider the question
of whether or not the names of stu
dents found guilty of cheating shall
be published . Inotlierwords, Stan
ford men and women are seriously
considering discrediting and virtu
ally branding a man for life as a
cheat because a ccrtain group of stu
dents think that sufficient evidence is
sliown by the accuser to prove him
guilty of copying one or more sen
tences. This smacks of Salem witch
burning, and to what justifiable end!
No student with any kind of aver
age will flunk out because someone
raises the class average by of 1%
of a point and if they will it is better
that they flunk out before they spend
more time or money here.
What possible good can such pub
lication of names do? None. It would
defeat its own purpose, if one dares
to say it has one, and the writer
doesn't. Naturally, tnere will be less

cases reported because no decent, re
spectable, honorable, Stanford gentle
man wants to be the cause of brand
ing a fellow comarade for life. Of
course less people will plead guilty,
and it will be exceedingly difficult to
definitely prove guilt otherwise. Stu
dents are not going to be so clumsy
to make it easily proved. And, as a
result, less people will be proved
guilty, even though guilty. Virtually
none if the members of the men's
council are of reasonable tolerance —
for why should they brand a man for
life!
Such publication would stigmatize
than man's living group, his friends,
his parents, and it would serve no
useful purpose.
A return to the watchdog system
would be more satisfactory than such
a thing, but after all the whole con
versation is nothing but rot, tommy
rot, because one would have to be a
scientific investigator with the scent
of a bloodhound to discover a violator
of the honor system, for after all most
of us are not from Chicago's under
world —even though some of these
conversationalists would make us out
as such! The only cheating worth
noticing has been in the catus gar
dens! —George F. Mott, Jr., '29.

rot, because one would have to be a
scientific investigator with the scent
of a bloodhound to discover a violator
of the honor system, for after all most
of us are not from Chicago's under
world —even though some of these
conversationalists would make us out
as such! The only cheating worth
noticing has been in the catus gar
dens! —George F. Mott, Jr., '29.
(Editor's Note: A faithful attempt
has been made to print the above
letter so as to preserve the quaint
spelling of the original.)
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to the writer that this
whole controversy about the honor
systems may be classified briefly as
unnecessary, almost assinine, imma
terial, and insulting to the intelli
gence of a Stanford freshman —let
alone a senior!
But of all this conversation, which
I have so named thru delicacy, the
most decidedly ridiculious is the fact
that a student assembly has been ac
tually called to consider the question
of whether or not the names of stu
dents found guilty of cheating shall
be published . Inotlierwords, Stan
ford men and women are seriously
considering discrediting and virtu
ally branding a man for life as a
cheat because a ccrtain group of stu
dents think that sufficient evidence is
sliown by the accuser to prove him
guilty of copying one or more sen
tences. This smacks of Salem witch
burning, and to what justifiable end!
No student with any kind of aver
age will flunk out because someone
raises the class average by of 1%
of a point and if they will it is better
that they flunk out before they spend
more time or money here.
What possible good can such pub
lication of names do? None. It would
defeat its own purpose, if one dares
to say it has one, and the writer
doesn't. Naturally, tnere will be less

cases reported because no decent, re
spectable, honorable, Stanford gentle
man wants to be the cause of brand
ing a fellow comarade for life. Of
course less people will plead guilty,
and it will be exceedingly difficult to
definitely prove guilt otherwise. Stu
dents are not going to be so clumsy
to make it easily proved. And, as a
result, less people will be proved
guilty, even though guilty. Virtually
none if the members of the men's
council are of reasonable tolerance —
for why should they brand a man for
life!
Such publication would stigmatize
than man's living group, his friends,
his parents, and it would serve no
useful purpose.
A return to the watchdog system
would be more satisfactory than such
a thing, but after all the whole con
versation is nothing but rot, tommy
rot, because one would have to be a
scientific investigator with the scent
of a bloodhound to discover a violator
of the honor system, for after all most
of us are not from Chicago's under
