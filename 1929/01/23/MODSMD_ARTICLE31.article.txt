Bride's Progress. By Harold Weston.
(New York: William Morrow and
Company, 1928.)
The action of Mr. Weston's book
is extraordinarily concentrated, being
concerned with the events that take
place at a luncheon in an Italian cafe
given in honor of a bride and bride
groom. Novels are written about
events encompassed, but to find an
, entire book devoted to a single ineal
is rather unusual.
Originality in the overcrowded book
world of today is always welcome, 1
hut any departure from the ordinary
demands some form of superior tech
nique in the handling. Mr. Weston
does not possess this superiority. Ap- ]
parently, his book as a result is a <

frank waste of time.
It has few points to recommend it.
It attempts to be brilliantly sophisti
cated, and succeeds only in being
silly and improper in some parts, and
Hat in most of the others. While it
has its spots of clever dialogue and
shrew characterization, there are so
many intervening pages of futile in
nuendos and inanities that the
reader's weary brain rebels and re
jects even these "spots."
Madame Cheyene, the French wife
of an English consul, gives promise
at first of being an interesting charac
ter, but somehow fails. She is a
painted, selfish creature, a curious
product of French social life, who, of
course, despises her husband. Almost

I
| her masculine counterpart is Gerald, i
the English bridegroom, a man bank- j
nipt in health, finances, reputation, [
' and ideals. These two are passably
' entertaining figures, but the remain
ing four included in the luncheon are
I dispiritingly innocuous.
In a certain way the book might be
taken as an education in human rela
tionships. A scarcely uplifting educa- '
tion, however. The disillusioned
Madame Cheyene remarks, for exain
; pie, that the surest way to lose a man
I is to marry him. All of this sophisti- i
cated enlightenment is for the bene- |
fit of the bride, who in the final chap
ter, responds nobly. Yes, the book has
a happy ending. —M. L. R.
"Her Cardboard Lover" —Geary.
Artificial French society comedy !
which manages to be amusing enough :
most of the time. It concerns an un- ;
faithful husband whose wife cannot :
forget him even though she gets a
j divorce. She is resolved not to humble i
I herself and overlook his philander- j
ings again—she knows that she will
go back to him unless someone stops
her —so he hires a gigilo to "protect" ;
j her from herself.
It is the duty of "the carboard
lover" to be present whenever the
| lady meets her ex-husband, and to
I back to him. She foresees she will prob-'
see that she does not weaken and go i
ably be unable to resist her husband's
appeals for a reconciliation, so she!
orders the "cardboard" man to keep |
her from relenting—even if she should
in a moment of passion try to dis- j
miss him.
From the middle of the first act on,
i the lady tries to escape her conscien
tious guardian and return to her for
mer husband. But the "cardboard"
man has fallen in love with her, so
he carries out his end of the contract
despite all her protestations.
Hazel Whitmore plays Simone, the
wife, and makes her a semi-hysterical, j
highly emotional creature. Miss Whit
more really saves the show, for the
! play itself is unreal and drags often.
She wears some strikingly distinctive
gowns, and speaks with an unusual
and attractive musical lilt.
It took us some time to accustom
i ourselves to her Simone, for in the
moving picture adaptation Jetta Gou
j dal made the character much more
mysterious and vampish. The play,
however, bears little resemblance to
the movie.
Most all the talking is done by!
Miss Whitmore and Anderson Lawler !
f und Carl Miller, who play the lover!
: and the husband, respectively. Law- :
ler makes his role stand out.
On the whole, "Her Cardboard ;
Lover" is entertaining—but nothing
out of the ordinary. It is hard to make i
yourself believe the story as it is
I staged—the moving picture put the '
idea over more effectively.

Short Circuits. By Stephen Leacock. !
(New York: Dodd, Mead & Co.)
There must be something about fol- j

] lowing a perfectly humorless trade
| thut brings out all the best humor in
I a man. That one of our very greatest
humorists, Lewis Carroll, should have
been a mathematician is remarkable,
but that another, Mr. Leacock, should
. be a professor of Political Science at
McGill University, Toronto, is amaz
ing.
"Short Circuits" is a collection of
■ sketches satirizing various things in
our much be-satired present-day
i v/orld. Hut it is to the credit of the
author that he seldom hits an over
j abused note, and certain of his sub
jects are delightfully without prece
dent.
Stephen Leacock is a good humorist
because he is many-sided. He can
stick excruciatingly funny absurdi
j ties into the story at odd intervals, as
Mr. Blencliley does; he can moralize

so well that the moral goes down like
a cocktail; he can even be senti
mental and full-throatedly humorous
at the same time.
His smooth changes of style and
blendings of style are effective by rea
son of the kindly tolerance that lies
behind them. There is nothing of the
blatant smart-aleck in the man, nor
is there anything of the thin intellec
tual, rather there is a good ileal ot
that substantiality to be found in
Mark Twain. —V. It.
