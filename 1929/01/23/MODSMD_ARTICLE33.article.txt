# CARD BABE FIVE DOWNS STOCKTON TEAM 31 TO 23
## Yearlings Clearly Outplay Victors Over California Freshman Quintet 
### 
Stanford freshman basketball stock
took a decided rise last night when
tin: Cardinal babes outplayed and out
scored the Stockton High School quin
tet, victors over the California fresh
men, by a count of 31 to 23 after the
Tarzans had succeeded in tying the
score at 14-14 late in the third quar
ter.
Except for the first few minutes of
play, the Cardinal youngsters were
never trailing and clearly outplayed
their opponents despite the fact that
the Stockton team last Friday de
feated the Bear Cubs by a score of
29 to 17 and are considered the like
liest candidates for the state cham
pionship, which they won last year.
Taking advantage of the Cardinals'
slowness in getting started, the visi
tors piled up a lead of 5 to 1 in the
first few minutes of play, which was
soon overcome, the Redshirts leading
6-5 at the end of the quarter. The
second period was a nip-and-tuck af
fair, both teams playing heads-up bas
ketball and taking advantage of all
the breaks. The half ended with the
Cardinals in the lead, 14 to 13.
A few minutes after the start of
the second half a Stockton player
sank a free throw, tying the score at
14 to 14. From this point on, however,
the Stanford quintet had things their
own way, the Tarzans being unable to
get the ball within close scoring dis
tance of the yearlings' goal.
Rudy Rintala, shifty Cardinal
guard, walked off with high-point
honors, scoring 9 tallies; while Rob
erts of the visitors was second with
S. Ohashi, speedy Stockton guard,
played a good game, as did DeMartini,
his running mate.
Bill Doub, Stanford center, was up
to his usual form, scoring six points
and picking the ball off the visitors'
backboard consistently. Kelly, Ray,
and Shrader showed up well on the
offense, although the latter seemed
to have difficulty in finding the bas
ket.
Baker, Cardinal guard, played a
good defensive game as well as ac
counting for 5 of his team's tallies.
Coach Bradshaw used only one sub
stitute during the game, putting Ray
in Shrader's place for the majority of
the second half.
Next Saturday evening the year
lings will face the Bear Cubs in the
Oakland Auditorium as a preliminary
to the varsity contest, but after their
victory tonight they should have lit
tle trouble with the Californians.
