# WINTER JOYS

### Feg Murray 
Skating is one of the oldest of all
sports and, like yachting, developed
from the necessity for moving about
from place to place on the water —the 1
water being frozen in one case and
not in the other. The origin of skat
ing is, like the origin of golf, shrouded j
in mystery. St. Liedwi, of Scheidam, |
Holland, was badly hurt by a fall on
the ice in 1396, but skates have been
definitely known to have been used
much earlier than this date, as bone
relics have been dug up near London
that were used as skates about 1100
or even earlier, and certainly the

Scandinavians skated long before j
then.
Skiing originated in Norway and
1 is the national sport of that country, j
It is not uncommon there to see chil
dren three years old, as well as
i grandmothers and grandfathers, going
j around on skis. Another method of ;
propelling oneself on the snow is with
| snowshoes. The Finns and the Lap
landers are said to have worn snow
shoes as early as 200 A.D. Procopius
referred to them as "Gliding Finns"
; in the year 500. Sledding and sleigh
riding are other popular winter snow

j sports, and tobogganing has a thou- j
jsand thrills for those who enjoy the
slides at Quebec, Lake Placid, St.
! Moritz, or Chamonix.
Thus we find that the snow pro
vides us with snowshoeing, sledding,
I sleigh-riding, and skiing, which last 1
in turn has its subdivisions such as
ski-joring (being towed by horses),
ski-sailing, and racing with an air
plane motor strapped to your back,
or getting a tow from a kite, motor- '
cycle, auto, or plane. Not forgetting
the merry sport of snowballing!
The ice, in turn, gives us speed and

; fancy skating, ice-boating, with sail !
boat and motor boat (one of the most 1
thrilling of all sports), hockey (the
fastest game), curling, skate-sailing,:
and barrel-jumping. Tennis, golf, 1
baseball, horse-racing, and other I
j sports have also been held on the
ice with the contestants wearing i
skates —except in the case of the !
horses. And man has also invented j
such hybrid contraptions as "snow- j
mobiles," "ice-flivvers," "aerosleighs," i
and other winter chariots, capable of
; going under their own power on
either ice or snow.

Skating is one of the oldest of all
sports and, like yachting, developed
from the necessity for moving about
from place to place on the water —the 1
water being frozen in one case and
not in the other. The origin of skat

in mystery. St. Liedwi, of Scheidam, |
Holland, was badly hurt by a fall on
the ice in 1396, but skates have been
definitely known to have been used
much earlier than this date, as bone
relics have been dug up near London
that were used as skates about 1100
or even earlier, and certainly the

Scandinavians skated long before j
then.
Skiing originated in Norway and

It is not uncommon there to see chil
