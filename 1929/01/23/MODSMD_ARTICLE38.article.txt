# NEW PERSONAL RATING BLANK USED IN SELECTING STANFORD APPLICANTS
## 
### 
The Committee of Admission to
I Stanford has adopted a new form of !
personal rating blank to be filled out
for students wishing to enter the Uni
versity. The new blank, which gives
room for closer gradation, was worked
out during fall quarter by the Admis- j
sion Committee consisting of Profes
sors W. R. Miles, J. P. Mitchell, W.
M. Proctor, F. G. Tickell, E. K. Strong, |
Jr., and Dean Yost. The personality
! rating scale was used for the first j
j time for admission this winter quar- j
J ter.
The new.blank is modeled on that!
made by a sub-committee of the !
American Council on Education, of
which Professor Strong of Stanford
is a member. The chief difference in
this blank is in the addition of three
questions: "What special training;
I does the candidate possess as the j
result of travel, employment, or busi- !
ncss experience? What do you con- j
I sider as the candidate's outstanding
weakness? What characteristics do |
you consider need special develop
ment?" A statement as to the physi
cal condition of the candidate is also j
added.
The present personal rating blank
has five questions to be answered in
a definite form. The questions are:
1(1) How does his manner and ap
pearance affect others? He is to be
rated under these heads: Avoided,!
tolerated, unnoticed, well-liked, or
sought by others? (2) Does he need
constant prodding or does he go ahead
with his work without being told?
Much prodding, occasional prodding,
1 dees ordinary assignments of his
own accord, completes suggested sup
plementary work, or seeks and sets
for himself additional tasks? (3) Does
he get to do what he wishes? Prob
ably unable to lead his fellows, satis
| fled to have others take lead, some- ,
times leads in minor sports, some
times leads in important affairs, or i
displays marked ability to lead his
fellows? (4) Does he control his emo
tions? Responsive, well-balanced, or |
j unusual balance of responsiveness j
and control? (5) Has he a program
j with definite purposes in terms of
I which he distributes his time and j
i energy? Aimless trifler, aims just to
i "get by," has vaguely formed objec
tives, directs energies effectively, or
! engrossed in realizing well-formulated 1
! objectives?
The rating blank used in previous
years lists the qualities or charac
, teristicß of the candidate for admis
sion and rates him as unsatisfactory
as university applicant, questionable
university material, below average of
university applicant, average univer
sity applicant, upper 25% of a group!

of 100 or more applicants for univer- 1
sity admission, and upper 5% of a (
similar group. Qualities listed are: ,
scholarship, personality, industry, i
judgment and common sense, relia- ]<
bility, initiative, co-operation, native .
ability, leadership, physical vitality, ; <
and all-around promise as a student.. (

the rating blank in helping freshman ' j
and sophomore women to decide upon ]
