# Daily Completes Investigation Of Student Living Group Distribution
## 
### JOE GORDON 
There are 3352 students enrolled
this quarter at Stanford, according to
the new bawl-outs. This is 107 less
than last quarter, and of this number
only 493 are women while the remain
der, 2859, are men.
Although the winter quarter bawl
outs which go on sale today contain
a mass of information including
everything from the number of stu
dents enrolled from Alaska to a map
of the campus, there are no compo
site statistics on where the Stanford
students are living. Because of many
requests The Daily has made an at
tempt to compile these and submits
the following figures as a result.
493 Women Enrolled
The figures concerning the women
are accurate, but because not all the
statistics regarding the men have been
compiled for this quarter, these are
only approximately correct in the
present case.
The "500" are not the "500" this
quarter, but only the "493" for they
are seven short of their regular num
ber. Of this number 72 live' off the
campus, 19 on the campus but not in
living groups, 211 in Roble, 14 in
Madrona Hall, and 177 in sororities.
The numbers in the sororities vary
from 10 in the smallest to 29 women
in the largest.
Statistics concerning the men show

that although there is about a 20 per
cent overload on the halls, over one
third of the men are living off the
campus.
Of the 2859 men, 1037 are living off
the campus or, at least, outside of the
regular living groups. Of the 1822
who live on the campus, 850 live in
Encina, 178 in Toyon, IGI in Branner,
IG3 in Sequoia, and 117 in the Union,
while 623 live in the twenty-four fra
ternity houses.
Fraternity Average 24
The numbers in the fraternity
houses vary from 13 in the smallest
to 35 in the largest and the average
is about 24. This is approximately
seven more than the sorority average
per house.
The fact that, whereas the normal
combined capacity of the halls is 977,
there are 1199 men living in them, is
not as remarkable as may first ap
pear because the entire overload is
voluntary. Only a certain number of
men are assigned to each hall but
they have the privilege of having a
guest in their rooms, a privilege which,
judging from the figures, is used to a
great extent.
As the figures stand, then, there
are G23 men in fraternities, 177 girls
in sororities, 1199 men in the halls,
225 girls in the halls, while 1037 men
and 91 girls live outside the organ
ized living group.
There are 3352 students enrolled
this quarter at Stanford, according to

only 493 are women while the remain

campus.

there are 1199 men living in them, is
not as remarkable as may first ap
pear because the entire overload is
voluntary. Only a certain number of
men are assigned to each hall but
they have the privilege of having a
guest in their rooms, a privilege which,
judging from the figures, is used to a
great extent.
As the figures stand, then, there
are G23 men in fraternities, 177 girls
in sororities, 1199 men in the halls,
225 girls in the halls, while 1037 men
and 91 girls live outside the organ
ized living group.
There are 3352 students enrolled
this quarter at Stanford, according to
the new bawl-outs. This is 107 less
than last quarter, and of this number
only 493 are women while the remain
der, 2859, are men.
Although the winter quarter bawl
outs which go on sale today contain
a mass of information including
everything from the number of stu
dents enrolled from Alaska to a map
of the campus, there are no compo
site statistics on where the Stanford
students are living. Because of many
requests The Daily has made an at
tempt to compile these and submits
the following figures as a result.
493 Women Enrolled
The figures concerning the women
are accurate, but because not all the
statistics regarding the men have been
compiled for this quarter, these are
only approximately correct in the
present case.
The "500" are not the "500" this
quarter, but only the "493" for they
are seven short of their regular num
ber. Of this number 72 live' off the
campus, 19 on the campus but not in
living groups, 211 in Roble, 14 in
Madrona Hall, and 177 in sororities.
The numbers in the sororities vary
from 10 in the smallest to 29 women
in the largest.
Statistics concerning the men show

that although there is about a 20 per
cent overload on the halls, over one
third of the men are living off the
campus.
Of the 2859 men, 1037 are living off
the campus or, at least, outside of the
regular living groups. Of the 1822
who live on the campus, 850 live in
Encina, 178 in Toyon, IGI in Branner,
IG3 in Sequoia, and 117 in the Union,
while 623 live in the twenty-four fra
ternity houses.
Fraternity Average 24
The numbers in the fraternity
houses vary from 13 in the smallest
to 35 in the largest and the average
is about 24. This is approximately
seven more than the sorority average
per house.
The fact that, whereas the normal
combined capacity of the halls is 977,
there are 1199 men living in them, is
not as remarkable as may first ap
pear because the entire overload is
voluntary. Only a certain number of
men are assigned to each hall but
