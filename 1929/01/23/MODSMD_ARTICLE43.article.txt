## 
### 
Wildcats are roaming our fair
; campus! At least such is the emphatic
! statement of one of the Five Hundred.
Last Monday night, house meeting
I was merrily proceeding at a certain
j sorority, when all other noises were
j suddenly obliterated by a long-drawn
I Me-e-ou-wr-rr-rrr. The sisters were i
I distinctly startled. Perhaps the recol
j lection of Various catty remarks re-
J turned to trouble their consciences.
Then a venturesome and animal- j
J loving sister begged to be allowed to
introduce the new cat to the meeting.
She departed in the direction of the ,
front door, but very soon returned, !
followed by some lusty howls. There j
J were two cats outside, which was one j
more than she had bargained for. '
j Then, too, they seemed to be in the
: midst of a slight disagreement, and
i it is always well not to interfere with 11
the affairs of others.
