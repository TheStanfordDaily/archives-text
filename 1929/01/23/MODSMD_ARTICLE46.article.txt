# WOMEN WINNERS IN ATHLETICS TO RECEIVE AWARDS
## 
### 
Women's Athletic Association Board
voted last night to award a Script
"S" to the winner of 600 points in
athletics and a blanket to the winner
of 1400 points. These awards are in
addition to the numerals given to
members of class teams, the Block
"S" for 1000 points, and the star for
400 points over the Block "S."
By action of the Board last spring
Script "S" 's were abolished in order
to make awards less complicated and
to afford more interest in sports, but
the desire to return to the Script
"S" 's was expressed by the women
in general and by the Block "S" So
ciety. The Block "S" Society was also
in favor of the award of blankets.
The motion carried by the Board is
retroactive.
