# JUNIOR COLLEGE MEN SHOW WELL IN U.C. ATHLETICS
## Bears Have Many Two-Year Institution Tracksters; Stanford But One 
### LEONARD BARTLETT 
"Junior college athletes are begin
ning to assert their athletic prowess,"
said President Wilbur yesterday after
noon in referring to an article pub
lished Monday on a San Francisco
sport page.
"At the University of California
they seem to have discovered the
value of junior college athletes. The
transfers from two-year institutions
are coming to the front."
The story, giving some advance
predictions on the Golden Bear ma
terial for the 1929 season, brings out
the fact that eight former junior col
lege athletes are working out daily
on the U.C. squad of tracksters and
appear to be promising material.
Four From Modesto
Four of the track men hail from
Modesto Junior College where they
were developed and trained by
Charles S. Morris, '09, former Stan
ford athlete and one-time holder of
the national high hurdling record.
Alfonso Pogolotti, breaker of both
hurdling records in the junior college
conference, is once again in trim and
is out to garner some points for the
Cal team. He ran the high barriers in
15 s. flat consistently last season. His
best time in the low hurdles is 24.3 s.
Raymond Brennon, blonde and
lanky half-miler, has been circling the
cinder track in practice runs which
treaten to eclipse the best time he
made while in junior college, 2:02.
One Star to Stanford
Garlen Smith, Riverside, and Spen
cer Bisbee, Modesto, are two former
junior college speedsters who have
been running the century dash in
10 s. flat.
Bob Patton, Riverside, and Eckert,
Davis Farm, will make their bid for
honors in the broad jump and the
high jump.
The only former junior college ath
lete whom the Cardinal squad can
boast of this season is Wesley Berry,
pole-vaulter. This sorrel-topped skv
jumper did 13 feet, establishing a
new junior college mark.
