# Date For Military Ball Is Changed To March 8
## 
### Executive Committee 
March 8 was formally approved as
the date tor the Military Ball by the
Executive Committee at its meeting
last night. The Military Ball was pre
viously scheduled to he held in April,
but since no formal dance is to be
given this quarter, and several for
mals come in the spring, Scabbard
and Blade, which sponsors the ball,
decided to change the date to this
quarter.
James E. Frank, general chairman,
has shifted the committee formerly
anonunced, appointing Hub Moffitt as
sistant chairman of the general com
mittee, and Dixon Chubbock chair
man of the program committee. Ex
tensive plans for the ball are being
made.
In one of Paris' busiest streets a
$50,000 pearl necklace lay unnoticed
for six days.
