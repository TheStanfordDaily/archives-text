What Has Vitaphone Done?
M It has revolutionized the motion picture industry.
Stars of the cinema, for the first time, have become
_ audible. New faces and great personalities have been
F brought to motion picture audiences. A new art has
been created —an art that combines the best features
Oof the cinema and speaking stage. Now a person can
view the pantomime of the screen and hear the voice of
the character in clear resonant tones. Vitaphone has
made possible the showing of vibrant dramas of the
day at a ridiculously low cost to the public. Broadway
Dhits have been reproduced to picture audiences for a
small charge.
