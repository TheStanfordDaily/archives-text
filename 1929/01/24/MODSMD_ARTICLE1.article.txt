# UNSCATHED CARD CAGE SQUAD SET FOR 'BIG SERIES'
## Nebraska Marrs U.C. Record; Hunt Proves He Can Rely On Reserves in Offensive Bear Five Has All Veteran Players; Corbin, Fawcett High-Point Competitors 
### ANSON REEDER 
Slated for the cellar at the begin
ning of the year the Cardinal basket
hall team has upset all predictions
<and, one might say, traditions) to
come through the Conference season
■unscathed for the annual Big Series
~with the University of California, the
tirst game of which is scheduled for
the Oakland Auditorium Saturday
Tiight.
In the Bears, the Stanford team will
meet the stiffest opposition they have
run up against this season. At pres
ent, the Californians seem to rule
slight favorites because of their past
and present season record, and be
cause they boast a veteran team.
Since the new year, the Redsliirts
have not had a setback, while the
Golden Bears succumbed to the lowly
Nebraska five by a single marker in
the third game of a three-game series.
Husky Has Ample Reserves
Tuesday's exhibition against the
Olympic Club proved to Coach Husky
Hunt that he could depend on his re
serves to come through when needed.
On the offensive end of the court
Tyler was especially outstanding, with
McCandless, Mears, and" Moft'att al
ways on hand when necessity de
manded. At the other end of the court
three guards, Captain Rothert, Rey
nolds, and Tampcke, put on a beauti
ful exhibition of defensive basketball.
If the Card defense plays like it did
against the Winged "O," the Califor
nia short pass artists will not be able
to pierce it.
Fawcett vs. Corbin
It" should be a great battle for high
point honors between Captain Corbin
of California, and Vance Fawcett, the
Cards' scoring ace. Both are great
basket-shooters and clever in floor
■work and team play.
From all indications the game Sat
urday night will be the first of the
series that decides the winner of the
Southern Division of the Conference,
tor U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. appear defi
nitely out of the running with three
defeats apiece.
Stanford has shown improvement
in every game played so far this sea
son. The five men who will start the
game are not the veterans that will
start for California, but they are
smart and they are fast.
If the Card sopliomores can stand
itp under the strain, it should be one
of the liveliest battles seen in thii
vicinity for some time.

urday night will be the first of the
series that decides the winner of the
Southern Division of the Conference,
tor U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. appear defi
nitely out of the running with three
defeats apiece.
Stanford has shown improvement
in every game played so far this sea
son. The five men who will start the
game are not the veterans that will
start for California, but they are
smart and they are fast.
If the Card sopliomores can stand
itp under the strain, it should be one
of the liveliest battles seen in thii
vicinity for some time.
Slated for the cellar at the begin
ning of the year the Cardinal basket
hall team has upset all predictions
<and, one might say, traditions) to
come through the Conference season
■unscathed for the annual Big Series
~with the University of California, the
tirst game of which is scheduled for
the Oakland Auditorium Saturday
Tiight.
In the Bears, the Stanford team will
meet the stiffest opposition they have
run up against this season. At pres
ent, the Californians seem to rule
slight favorites because of their past
and present season record, and be
cause they boast a veteran team.
Since the new year, the Redsliirts
have not had a setback, while the
Golden Bears succumbed to the lowly
Nebraska five by a single marker in
the third game of a three-game series.
Husky Has Ample Reserves
Tuesday's exhibition against the
Olympic Club proved to Coach Husky
Hunt that he could depend on his re
serves to come through when needed.
On the offensive end of the court
Tyler was especially outstanding, with
McCandless, Mears, and" Moft'att al
ways on hand when necessity de
manded. At the other end of the court
three guards, Captain Rothert, Rey
nolds, and Tampcke, put on a beauti
ful exhibition of defensive basketball.
If the Card defense plays like it did
against the Winged "O," the Califor
nia short pass artists will not be able
to pierce it.
Fawcett vs. Corbin
It" should be a great battle for high
point honors between Captain Corbin
of California, and Vance Fawcett, the
Cards' scoring ace. Both are great
basket-shooters and clever in floor
■work and team play.
From all indications the game Sat
urday night will be the first of the
series that decides the winner of the
Southern Division of the Conference,
tor U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. appear defi
nitely out of the running with three
