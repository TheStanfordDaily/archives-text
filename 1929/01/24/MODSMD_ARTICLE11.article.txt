# REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF THE HONOR SYSTEM:
## 
### 
At other colleges and universities,
exhaustive studies, whose results fill
formidable pamphlets, have been
made of the Honor System, and ef
forts have been made to so instill it
in the student bodies of those places
that it would be effective.
That sort of an investigation has
not appealed to this committee, not
alone because it would be laborious,
but also because it would be unpro
ductive of the results which are
sought in the present instance. The
committee has devoted itself to three
projects: discovering what the stu
dents may do to bolster the Honor
System, discovering what the faculty
may do, and drawing up a definite
statement of the purpose and ideal
working out of the Honor System, so
that all students may understand it
fully.
In accordance with that plan, the
committee submits today some of its
findings as they pertain to the stu
dents. (The gist of the report to the
faculty, and the statement of the
Stanford honor code have appeared in
previous issues of the Daily this
week.)
Since 1922, thirty-two men, and no
women, have been found guilty by the
councils for student control of viola
tion of the Honor System. During the
period 1922-24, more cases were
brought up than in the period 1924-
1928, but there were more convictions
in the latter time than in the former.
In what courses does the cheating
occur? Most of it has occurred in
English, economics, history, physics,
mathematics, social science, geology,
entomology, biology, medicine, French,
classical literature, and psychology
courses. The Law School and the En
gineering School are notably exempt.
Most cheating is done, not in
courses, but in term papers and re
ports. Where it is done in class, it
happens mostly in the Lower Division
required courses; where it happens
outside of class, it is committed by
Upper Division students.
That cheating which is done in
courses is confined largely to "pipes,"
where a stiff examination asking mi
nute details leads the unprepared stu
dent to cheat. Also, high competition
is a factor in cheating; e.g., in courses
like "Painters" and certain Military
Department courses, the class aver
age is so high that some feel they
have to cheat in order to get the
almost-perfect grade required for
passing.
Crowded classrooms are conducive
to cheating. The committee recom
mends that students insist on taking
examinations in rooms where the rule
of occupying alternate seats can be
observed. The professor should be de
manded to comply with this rule.
Reading slips are a flagrant source
of cheating, and it has been recom
mended that they be abolished.
The committee favors allowance of
as many cuts per quarter as the
course represents units. Classes which
cannot be cut are an aggravation to
the man likely to descend to cheating.
The committee recommends that
students do not group together out
side of the examination room while
tiiey are in the course of taking the
examination. Such aggregation is al
most prima l'acie evidence of inten
tion to cheat.
The committee has recommended
to the facult ythe following oppor
to the faculty the following oppor
nating cheating.
a) That requirements of term
papers be clearly stated when assign
ments are first made; and quotable
material ought definitely to be ex
plained.
b) That inasmuch as cheating is
furthered in examinations for the
writing of which too long a time is
given, the length of examination be
increased, so that the student will
have to work the full time, or that
the time of examination Ue decreased.

c) That "trick" questions, which
encourage cheating by a disgusted
student be abolished.
d) That plus-minus examinations be
abolished. Signals are easily given
and comprehended in such examina
tions.
£-) And finally that professors, par
ticularly those having freshman
classes, go out of their way to ex
plain the true purpose and ideal
operation of the honor system during
the course of the quarter. The point
needs continually to be made that the
Honor System applies only to aca
demic work and that infractions of
it are the concern of all.

The committee recommends that
students do not group together out
side of the examination room while
tiiey are in the course of taking the
examination. Such aggregation is al
most prima l'acie evidence of inten
tion to cheat.
The committee has recommended
to the facult ythe following oppor
to the faculty the following oppor
nating cheating.
a) That requirements of term
papers be clearly stated when assign
ments are first made; and quotable
material ought definitely to be ex
plained.
b) That inasmuch as cheating is
furthered in examinations for the
writing of which too long a time is
given, the length of examination be
increased, so that the student will
have to work the full time, or that
the time of examination Ue decreased.

c) That "trick" questions, which
encourage cheating by a disgusted
student be abolished.
d) That plus-minus examinations be
abolished. Signals are easily given
and comprehended in such examina
tions.
£-) And finally that professors, par
ticularly those having freshman
classes, go out of their way to ex
plain the true purpose and ideal
operation of the honor system during
the course of the quarter. The point
needs continually to be made that the
Honor System applies only to aca
demic work and that infractions of
it are the concern of all.
At other colleges and universities,
exhaustive studies, whose results fill
formidable pamphlets, have been
made of the Honor System, and ef
forts have been made to so instill it
in the student bodies of those places
that it would be effective.
That sort of an investigation has
not appealed to this committee, not
alone because it would be laborious,
but also because it would be unpro
ductive of the results which are
sought in the present instance. The
committee has devoted itself to three
projects: discovering what the stu
dents may do to bolster the Honor
System, discovering what the faculty
may do, and drawing up a definite
statement of the purpose and ideal
working out of the Honor System, so
that all students may understand it
fully.
In accordance with that plan, the
committee submits today some of its
findings as they pertain to the stu
dents. (The gist of the report to the
faculty, and the statement of the
Stanford honor code have appeared in
previous issues of the Daily this
week.)
Since 1922, thirty-two men, and no
women, have been found guilty by the
councils for student control of viola
tion of the Honor System. During the
period 1922-24, more cases were
brought up than in the period 1924-
1928, but there were more convictions
in the latter time than in the former.
In what courses does the cheating
occur? Most of it has occurred in
English, economics, history, physics,
mathematics, social science, geology,
entomology, biology, medicine, French,
classical literature, and psychology
courses. The Law School and the En
gineering School are notably exempt.
Most cheating is done, not in
courses, but in term papers and re
ports. Where it is done in class, it
happens mostly in the Lower Division
required courses; where it happens
outside of class, it is committed by
Upper Division students.
That cheating which is done in
courses is confined largely to "pipes,"
where a stiff examination asking mi
nute details leads the unprepared stu
dent to cheat. Also, high competition
is a factor in cheating; e.g., in courses
like "Painters" and certain Military
Department courses, the class aver
age is so high that some feel they
have to cheat in order to get the
almost-perfect grade required for
passing.
Crowded classrooms are conducive
to cheating. The committee recom
mends that students insist on taking
examinations in rooms where the rule
of occupying alternate seats can be
observed. The professor should be de
manded to comply with this rule.
Reading slips are a flagrant source
of cheating, and it has been recom
mended that they be abolished.
The committee favors allowance of
as many cuts per quarter as the
course represents units. Classes which
cannot be cut are an aggravation to
the man likely to descend to cheating.

courses. The Law School and the En
gineering School are notably exempt.
Most cheating is done, not in
courses, but in term papers and re
ports. Where it is done in class, it
happens mostly in the Lower Division
required courses; where it happens
outside of class, it is committed by
Upper Division students.
That cheating which is done in
courses is confined largely to "pipes,"
where a stiff examination asking mi
nute details leads the unprepared stu
dent to cheat. Also, high competition
is a factor in cheating; e.g., in courses
like "Painters" and certain Military
Department courses, the class aver
age is so high that some feel they
have to cheat in order to get the
almost-perfect grade required for
passing.
Crowded classrooms are conducive
to cheating. The committee recom
mends that students insist on taking
examinations in rooms where the rule
of occupying alternate seats can be
observed. The professor should be de
manded to comply with this rule.
Reading slips are a flagrant source
of cheating, and it has been recom
mended that they be abolished.
The committee favors allowance of
as many cuts per quarter as the
course represents units. Classes which
cannot be cut are an aggravation to
the man likely to descend to cheating.
The committee recommends that
students do not group together out
side of the examination room while
tiiey are in the course of taking the
examination. Such aggregation is al
most prima l'acie evidence of inten
tion to cheat.
The committee has recommended
to the facult ythe following oppor
to the faculty the following oppor
nating cheating.
a) That requirements of term
papers be clearly stated when assign
ments are first made; and quotable
material ought definitely to be ex
plained.
b) That inasmuch as cheating is
furthered in examinations for the
writing of which too long a time is
given, the length of examination be
increased, so that the student will
have to work the full time, or that
the time of examination Ue decreased.

c) That "trick" questions, which
encourage cheating by a disgusted
student be abolished.
d) That plus-minus examinations be
abolished. Signals are easily given
and comprehended in such examina
tions.
£-) And finally that professors, par
ticularly those having freshman
classes, go out of their way to ex
plain the true purpose and ideal
operation of the honor system during
the course of the quarter. The point
needs continually to be made that the
Honor System applies only to aca
demic work and that infractions of
it are the concern of all.
At other colleges and universities,
exhaustive studies, whose results fill
formidable pamphlets, have been
made of the Honor System, and ef
forts have been made to so instill it
in the student bodies of those places
that it would be effective.
That sort of an investigation has
not appealed to this committee, not
alone because it would be laborious,
but also because it would be unpro
ductive of the results which are
sought in the present instance. The
committee has devoted itself to three
projects: discovering what the stu
dents may do to bolster the Honor
System, discovering what the faculty
may do, and drawing up a definite
statement of the purpose and ideal
working out of the Honor System, so
that all students may understand it
fully.
In accordance with that plan, the
committee submits today some of its
findings as they pertain to the stu
dents. (The gist of the report to the
faculty, and the statement of the
Stanford honor code have appeared in
previous issues of the Daily this
week.)
Since 1922, thirty-two men, and no
women, have been found guilty by the
councils for student control of viola
tion of the Honor System. During the
period 1922-24, more cases were
brought up than in the period 1924-
1928, but there were more convictions
in the latter time than in the former.
In what courses does the cheating
occur? Most of it has occurred in
English, economics, history, physics,
mathematics, social science, geology,
entomology, biology, medicine, French,
classical literature, and psychology
courses. The Law School and the En
gineering School are notably exempt.
