### 
This morning at 10 o'clock the stu
dent body will meet in the Assembly
Hall to discuss the report of the
A.S.S.U. Committee for the Investiga
tion of the i Honor System, and to
vote upon two questions concerning
the system.
The first question is whether the
name "Honor System" shall be re
tained or changed to "Honor Code."

with the argument that it lessens the
seriousness of the attitude of the stu
dents toward honor, and think that
"code" would do away with this dif
ficulty.
The second question is whether
names of violators shall be published.
A majority of the investigating com
mittee was not in favor of doing this,
but decided to put the matter to a
vote of the student body.
Phil Cavalero will preside, and
Templeton Peck, chairman of the in
vestigating committee, will open the
meeting with a report of the work
and findings of that body. A discus
sion of the report will follow, and
suggestions, additions, or amend
liunts may be made; it will then be
submitted to a vote of the student
l>odJ\ All questions will be decided by
a standing vote.
Students are advised to sit down
stairs if possible so that they can
hear the discussion from the floor.
