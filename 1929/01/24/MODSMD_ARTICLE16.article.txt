## 
### 
Lyman Baker, former Watson
ville High School star, was yes
terday afternoon elected to cap
tain Stanford's 1929 freshman bas
i
ketball team during the remain
i der of the season. Baker is a
guard and has played a consist
ent brand of ball in every game
to date.
Saturday evening the Cardinal
babes will face the California year
lings in the Oakland Auditorium as
a preliminary to the varsity contest.
Judging by comparative scores, the
Redshirts should be able to win over
their traditional l'oes, although it is a
| well-known fact that comparative j
scores mean little in Stanford-Cali- j
Ifornia contests.
Coach Bradshaw intends to start i
' Shrader and Kelly at forwards, Doub
! at center, and Baker and Rintala in
j tiie guard berths. Ray and Lambert '
| are two other forwards who are likely I
| to see action during the fray, particu
! larly the former.
The Bear Cubs have an unusual
number of tall men on the squad and
will probably depend on this fact for |
a victory. The Californians play a
man-to-man defense; while the Cardi- '
nals use a shifting zone style. In
other respects their type of play is
1 nearly the same.
