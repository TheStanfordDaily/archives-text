# PAN-HELLENIC TO MEET TO DISCUSS VOTE
## 
### 
As a result of a conference with
I Dean Mary Yost on the question of
i having sororities vote on their own
i abolition, Ellen Woerner, president of
! Pan-Hellenic, yesterdav decided to
i
: (all a meeting of that body for Mon
day afternoon to discuss the matter.
Pan-Hellenic will decide whether or
not the question will be voted upon
| by the Row women. If there is a de
sire for a vote, the sorority houses
| will take up the matter in house meet
! ings Monday evening. Pan-Hellenic
I consists of two representatives from
| each sorority.
Dean Yost explained to Ellen Woer
ner that the Administration of the
University had nothing to do with the
movement toward abolition of the
Greek letter living groups. Action
i must come from the Row women en
; tirely.
It was suggested by Dean Yost that
iif Pan-Hellenic decides to put the
I question to a vote, the voting should
I be done by individuals on signed bal
i lots rather than by each living group
as a whole. When the same subject
| came up for a vote several years ago,
no individual vote was taken, but
each sorority cast its ballot as a
i whole. At that time six houses voted
! in favor of keeping sororities on the
i campus, and the other four were in
favor of abolition. The proposed elec
-1 tion would not be like the regular
I Quad election; some unprejudiced
; person would probably be entrusted
| with the counting of the votes.
In the case of such a vote, a large
| majority in favor of the abolition of
sororities will be necessary to put
them off the campus, Ellen Woerner
I declared.
