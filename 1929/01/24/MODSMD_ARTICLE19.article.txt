## 
### DON OSWILL 
Saturday afternoon will usher in
I the return of baseball season when
1 the varsity meets the Granat Brothers
i nine of San Francisco in what prom
ises to be a hard-fought battle. Last
year in an initial contest against the
Kenealy Seals, the Cards were easily
outclassed by the smart winter
leaguers, but this time a better-hitting
team will take the field for Stanford.
The Granat Brothers' organization
is now leading the San Francisco
Midwinter league. They have consist
i ently been a first-division club, and
will put a hard-hitting nine on the
I diamond Saturday afternoon, but they
will not be able to use their star
pitcher, however, because of an im
portant league game Sunday.
Since last week's fracas between
the varsity and the faculty. Coach
i Horry Wolter has been putting his
| men through some intensive practice
j drills in both hitting and fielding.
Weakness at the bat has been a
black eye to Stanford teams for the
last few years, but the fact that the
; Cards garnered thirteen hits from
ITc mpleton and Nevers last week
shows that they are overcoming the
; hitting weakness.
Wolter has not yet decided what
I chucker he will use against the semi-
I pro outfit. Kern, Taylor, and Lewis
are the most experienced pitchers on
' the squad, but they will have to work
hard to keep Smalling on the bench.
