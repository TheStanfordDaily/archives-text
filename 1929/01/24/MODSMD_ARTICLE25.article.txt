# Walls With Ears and Pictures That Talk

What with Greta Garbo lisping in Scandinavian, Emil Jannings roar
ing in German, babies yowling, guns barking, and the succulent noise of
garbage men at work, the movie has taken another step toward that Utopian
day of absolute realism. Yitaphone comes to Paly Sunday. No more can
the Rough heckle the screen stars, no more can he supply doubtful music
by stamping feet and whistling, for he must listen or miss the story.
We look forward now to the time when as the stage coach passes on
the screen, a spray of dust will shower the audience, frying ham and eggs
on the screen will fill the air with pungent odor, and a pictured brewery
will cause the male portion of the audience to rise as one man and leave
for the nearest speakeasies.
Just as those jerky, blind-staggering images that were cast on a screen
some twenty-five years ago were met with jeers, laughter, and the scoffing
of the multitude, so the talkie is hailed. Give the little lady a hand. In a
year's time the talkie has been developed from an ordinary picture with
brief snatches of incoherent sound to pictures devoid of subtitles and filled
with dialogue. The machinery of producing them and of reproducing them
has been improved and perfected. It won't be long until those who scoff
now will be looking to them for legitimate entertainment. At present they
are above all else amusing and then there's the hope that the infant will
grow up.
