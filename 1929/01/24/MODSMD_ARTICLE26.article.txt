# Putting the Won in Wonder
## 
### 
A spectacular and amazing string of victories has brought about a
feeling that Stanford has been favored with a Wonder Team in basketball.
So far, this idea has not l>een generally accepted, and most of the wonder
has been confined to speculation on the probable reasons for the success
of this year's cage team and whether it will continue to be successful.
Stanford, at least in the memory of the present generation, has always
been a contender for cellar position. A victory over California in the Big
Series was always mentioned, but not seriously.
And now, unheralded, comes Captain Rothert and his small band of
basketeers to lead Stanford out of the Land of Darkness and into Victory.
Most of his sharpshooters are only sophomores, yearning for the day
when they can don a pair of cords. A veteran is a man with one season's
experience.
This team has already taken the measure of two conference opponents.
Saturday night it will meet the third and by far the most dangerous. Stan
ford's chances for a victory in the California series can be measured to a
certain degree by the outcome of the Saturday's contest.
As the string of Cardinal victories has grown, so has the student inter
est and attendance at games. And as the string of victories grows, the
number of skeptics decreases. Stanford's Wonder team may be more of a
Mystery Team, but it has certainly been pleasant to read the scoreboard
after each game. A silent prayer is hereby offered that three previous silent
prayers for victory over California in basketball be answered.
