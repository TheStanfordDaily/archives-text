failing blurp from the Anaheim High School Anoranco anent the
curse of sodality:
A fine, well organized team goes through a season undefeated.
There is one game remaining, an easy one. Everyone is joyous and
exultant at the thought of a championship; rooters yell louder; the
stands are fuller; everyone is predicting a championship.
Then like a douse of ice water on a tired sleeper the team is
broken in spirit. It plays without pep or heart because every bit
of fight it had is gone.
What causes this sudden reverse in the spirit of the players?
A player on the team, a very much needed one, was declared in
eligible because of his belonging to a FRATERNITY. This dis
aster happened in the case of the Pasadena middle weights. Their
hopes for a championship were blasted sky high.
There is another case of more hopes being blown to atoms
when a player gave a false age one year and his correct age the
next. The discrepancy was not found out until the season was half
over, and all of the games his team had played were forfeited.
This player could not have had any school spirit or loyalty what
ever.
Fellows! Anaheim High School has not had any disasters like
this befall her teams and certainly would not want one to ruin all
chances of a title.
Athletes, stop before >ou start! Stay away from the fellows gj
you think or know belong to a Frat because when they are discov
ered yon wouldn't want it to be known that you were a friend of
those who put selfish interests first.
Stay out of Frats, fellows. They arc not worth it.
