# The 						Bullsession
## JUST GOOD CLEAN FEELING 
### 
Now that everybody is agreed that
sororities should be abolished, we can
cease panting and look about us to
discover what has been going on
I since the dam burst last Thursday.
And sure enough, we discover that
the luterfraternity Council has made
one of the most constructive moves
of recent months by authorizing Sun
day "open houses" to promote friend
ship and good feeling between the
Row and the freshmen ,
Further praise should go to the
luterfraternity Council for the fact
that by a sweeping vote they passed
a regulation forbidding rushing in any
of its ramifications at these informal
"get-togethers." Had this latter step
not been taken there might have
arisen misunderstanding which would
have led to a bit of rushing here and
there. But the Council, by definitely
forbidding such dishonest practice,
has eliminated this possibility.
Undoubtedly one result of these
''open house" get-togethers will be,
between Row men and freshmen, a
spirit of good feeling which, in many
cases, will verge on Brotherly feeling.
But the greatest benefit will, of
course, be for the freshman who,
through some unforeseen accident, al
ready has a pledge button stowed
away in his drawers. No doubt he
has been as busy as a beaver for two
or three months picking out lapels
upon which pledge buttons similar to
his own would look graceful.
But how is he to know that his
choice of future button-wearers will
be approved by the Brotherhood? The
"get-together" solves this problem for

liim. He is able to line up his choices

and march them up to the House for
a Sunday afternoon cup of tea. Later
in the evening the Brotherhood can
assemble for a short game of black
ball, soon after which their research
worker will know how well he has
chosen. Perhaps the Brotherhood will
ask him, if possible, to eradicate a
recruit or two from the squad.
It may readily be seen that these
winter quarter "get-togethers" will
eliminate much of the clerical work
of actual Rushing Season, making
that time more pleasant and fruitful
for all. Spring rushing will hereafter
be simply a succession of pleasant
bridge hands and pingpong games,
ended by general hearty handclasp
ing when, on Pledging Day, the Nug
gets have transferred their pledge
buttons from their B.V.D.'s to public
view on their lapels.
It has been suggested that those
Houses which do not have a pledge
or two drumming up trade for them
in Encina, go through the following
ritual at special Sunday night meet
ings:
The Brotherhood join hands, form
ing a circle. Then one man kicks the
Brother next to him viciously on the
shin, and so on around the circle
until all are kicked. Then reverse the
process in the opposite direction. The
Brotherhood will, as a result, know
better next Winter Quarter.
Of course it isn't necessary, but just
as a matter of form the Interfrater
nity Council might have passed a fur
ther regulation forbidding initiation
of freshmen during these Sunday get
togethers. â€”Winston Norman.
