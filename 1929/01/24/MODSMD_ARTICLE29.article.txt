"Disraeli." By Andre Maurois. (New:
York: Appleton. $3.)
Apropos of the publication, within [
a fortnight or so, of a book, a bit of !
satiro, called "A Voyage to the Isle j
of the Articoles," written by one j
Andre Maurois, it seems fitting to re
view another book written by this |
same French author.
Maurois' "Disraeli," published last
year, still a best seller, is a book well J
worth a reading—if you have not yet
read it —though grown quite old, !
aged a year now, almost. While the
brief volume, "A Voyage to the Isle
of the Articoles," a satire on creative!
artists, is hardly one of significance |
at all, that older one, "Disraeli," a
biography, is one of some signifi
cance. Let us look into this —this
"Disraeli."
"I have climbed to the top of the
greasy pole."
With little feeling, a trifle ironically
perhaps, Disraeli speaks these words
to a friend. He entered his own draw
ing room, but a few minutes before,
entered with the Princess of Wales
on his arm. He was Prime Minister
he compared to the achievement of a |
man who had reached the top of a
pole—a greasy pole.
Though Disraeli had spent much of
his time in what is termed pursuit of i
pleasure, much of his energy in win- 1
ning for himself fame as a novelist,,
he had wished above all else to be- j
come Prime Minister.
Now his goal is gained. He is Prime j
Minister. Yet this supreme success,!
become his own, evokes no more than j
a smile, the smile of a cynic, the |
smile of a man finding life but moder-;
ately pleasing when those lesser than \
he look on him, the holder of an ex- j
alted place, as one who would live to |
the full, as one who would find life j
much more than merely moderately
pleasing.
Maurois shows to the reader clear
ly, a Jew, Disraeli, a man of genius,
one whom the English nation had
been loath to have hold the highest
political post in the British Empire, i
For many years, Maurois tells us, the
House of Commons had listened, often
with delight, to this unusually able
orator among them, this Disraeli, had j
listened to this creator of apt meta-'
phor and felicitous simile, this novel
ist whom they had known aspired to
be a statesman. This they had done,
the members of the House of Com
mons. They had listened. Yet the
House had not believed he would one
day be Prime Minister —as he did be
come.
Written much as a novel might be, j
this biography of Maurois' is easy to j
read. Disraeli is the hero, of course.
Disraeli accomplished many actions,
assumed many attitudes, conceived!
many thoughts, quite ignoble ones, I
all of "vhich were not of a part with
doings—thoughts put into action — j
doings of his truly noble and fine. 1
However, Maurois has rationalized
them all so well that the whole of all
DlC*aeli was, all Disraeli did, is made
to appear homogeneous. Maurois has
connived so well —or ill—at all un- j
worthy aspects of Disaeli's career
that, with the eye of his mind, the ,
reader sees before him a fine, sensi- [
tive, misunderstood man whose many 1

I intimate feminine relations were
! never soiled by one single indiscre
| lion, whose many loves were all pla
! tonic, whose marriage was due only
| to an aesthetic affection for a woman
j a decade older than he and not due
at all to the woman's possession of
, large means when he, himself, was a
j man only of large debts. Maurois has
written beautifully, convincingly.
What story of "cobbler made sultan
! could be more picturesque," writes
Maurois. Written much as an eulogy,
alteit a rational one to a degree, Dis
raeli's life is made to seem indeed
| picturesque! —Gunnar Norberg.
