# SLOT MACHINE GOES ACROSS STATE LINE TO EVADE SHERIFFS
## 
### 
KENOSHA, Wis., Jan. 23. (/P)
The Illinois-Wisconsin State
line runs right through the mid
dle of Charles Crittenden's road
house. Sheriff Steve Robinson of
Kenosha, informed that a slot
machine was being operated at
the roadhouse contrary to the
law and the statutes, went there
to do his duty. Crittenden saw
him coming and moved the slot
machine over to the Illinois side
of the house.
Sheriff Lawrence Doolittle of
Waukegan, 111., learning of it,
went forth to the roadhouse,
bent upon enforcing the laws of
Illinois. Crittenden saw him com
ing, too, and moved the slot ma
chine back into Wisconsin.
Law, however, is inexorable,
and right will prevail.
The two sheriffs went back to
the roadhouse last night, to
gether.
