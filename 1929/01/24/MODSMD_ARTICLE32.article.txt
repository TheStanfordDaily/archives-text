Looping in the highest score to
date, Beta Theta Pi smashed the
mural hoop record last night by run
ning up a 47 to 3 victory over the
Chinese Club. Teague and Lewis
shared high-point honors with 16
markers apiece. The Chinese boys
never had a chance, and were lucky
to get a half dozen shots at the bucket
during the entire game.
Independent 2 players hung up a
new record themselves when they
held I*os Arcos to a single goal. In
the last minute of play McCormick
sank one from the center of the court
to give the club boys their sum total
of two points. The score at half time
was 7 to 0. How was high-point man
of the contest with 11 tallies to his
credit Ward Smith played a good
floor game for the winners, besides
ringing up 7 points. Strange as it
may seem, not a single player stood
out for Los Arcos.
Garibotto Scores 19 Points
"Nap" Garibotto drubbed the Theta
Delts single handed by tossing in nine
field goals and one free throw to pile
up 19 points for El Tigre. The "dead
eye" forward of the club outfit also
displayed some classy floorwork, and
his playing featured an otherwise
mediocre contest. Leland showed up
best for the fraternity quintet.
Coming back with a rush in the
second half, Kappa Alpha swept a
fighting A.K.L. team off its feet to
win by an ample margin. The initial
period was closely contested and
ended in a 9-all tie. Long, flashy for
ward for the K.A.'s, and Rawliiigs,
lanky center on the losing squad, each
sank five baskets. Hall played a
strong game at standing guard for the
victors.
Phi Kapps Get Easy Game
Phi Kappa Sigma had an easy time
beating a ragged D.U. quintet in the
slowest game of the day. Led by
Ward Edmonds, the Phi Kapps piled
up an early lead and were never in
danger. Evans, at forward, scored 9
points for the winning team, while
Link Clark showed up well at stand
ing guard.
The Fiji's nosed out Encina 2W in
a closely contested fracas. The fra
ternity outfit cinched the game in the
last few minutes of play on goals by
Thomas and Skillern. The latter, by
the way, starred at guard. Bugg, of
Encina 2W, was high-scorer with 11
points.
El Campo won by default, as En
cina Basement failed to put in an
appearance.

second half, Kappa Alpha swept a
fighting A.K.L. team off its feet to
win by an ample margin. The initial
period was closely contested and
ended in a 9-all tie. Long, flashy for
ward for the K.A.'s, and Rawliiigs,
lanky center on the losing squad, each
sank five baskets. Hall played a
strong game at standing guard for the
victors.
Phi Kapps Get Easy Game
Phi Kappa Sigma had an easy time
beating a ragged D.U. quintet in the
slowest game of the day. Led by
Ward Edmonds, the Phi Kapps piled
up an early lead and were never in
danger. Evans, at forward, scored 9
points for the winning team, while
Link Clark showed up well at stand
ing guard.
The Fiji's nosed out Encina 2W in
a closely contested fracas. The fra
ternity outfit cinched the game in the
last few minutes of play on goals by
Thomas and Skillern. The latter, by
the way, starred at guard. Bugg, of
Encina 2W, was high-scorer with 11
points.
El Campo won by default, as En
cina Basement failed to put in an
appearance.

Looping in the highest score to

mural hoop record last night by run
ning up a 47 to 3 victory over the
Chinese Club. Teague and Lewis
shared high-point honors with 16
markers apiece. The Chinese boys
never had a chance, and were lucky
to get a half dozen shots at the bucket
during the entire game.
Independent 2 players hung up a
new record themselves when they
held I*os Arcos to a single goal. In
the last minute of play McCormick
sank one from the center of the court
to give the club boys their sum total
of two points. The score at half time
was 7 to 0. How was high-point man
of the contest with 11 tallies to his
credit Ward Smith played a good
floor game for the winners, besides
ringing up 7 points. Strange as it
may seem, not a single player stood
out for Los Arcos.
Garibotto Scores 19 Points
"Nap" Garibotto drubbed the Theta
Delts single handed by tossing in nine
field goals and one free throw to pile
up 19 points for El Tigre. The "dead
eye" forward of the club outfit also
displayed some classy floorwork, and
his playing featured an otherwise
mediocre contest. Leland showed up
best for the fraternity quintet.
