EUGENE, Ore., Jan. 22. (P.I.P.)— j
"Organized cheering, especially if it 1
is well organized, is one of the most j
important factors making for success
in athletics," says Dr. Arnold Bennett |
Hull, president of the University of ■
Oregon. Commenting on the recent
statement of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
of Stanford University against organ- j
ized rooting, Dr. Hall says he ap
proves of this practice for the very
reasons that Dr. Wilbur opposes it.
"Organized rooting has been op
posed on the grounds that it leads to j
rough remarks and that it is likely |
to stir up trouble and antagonism, but j
if it is really well organized and di- j
rected by intelligent students just the
opposite will be the case," says Dr. I
Hall. "Through such efforts students
can best show their friendship and
goodwill for their opponents, and any
tendency toward disrespect can be
controlled. The emotional and inspira- j
tional phase of athletics demands !
some sort of outlet, and it is much
better that this be controlled in a way j
that will do the most good. There is
no better way than by organized |
cheering sections.
"Athletics, and particularly football,
are highly important in university j
life in that they give an opportunity i
of expression to sentiments such as |
loyalty and enthusiasm for the institu
tion. They center the emotions of all ;
students and give them a common
interest and a common goal to strive I
for."
