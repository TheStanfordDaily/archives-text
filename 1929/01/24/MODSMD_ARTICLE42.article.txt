"I would rather be a dead atheist,

manity than sit smug, selfish, a lazy
member of a privileged class," de
clared Sherwood Eddy at an informal j
j dinner at the Union last night. Eddy
attacked the people who remain pas
sionless and unmoved before "vast, i
congested, selfish wealth unshared; j
poverty unrelieved, a vindicative pa
gan penal system."
Addressing his hearers as "fellow
students," he offered two alternatives,
I "a world of brotherhood, with unsel
fish human co-operation—or a world
of battle, red in tooth and claw." He ;
presented as the solution for human-!
ity's problems the brotherhood of
| man.
j "We can stop war just as truly as
i slavery was stopppd. Public sentiment j
is changing; a world consciousness is
awakening. We should be alert, pre-,
pared, instructed to do something. I j
do not mean the simple, empty word, |
brotherhood; rather do I mean the
full sharing" of life, creation's final !
] law."
The most sensitive part of the body is
