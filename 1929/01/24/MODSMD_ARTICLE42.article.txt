# SHERWOOD EDDY ATTACKS EGOISTS IN DINNER SPEECH
## 
### 
"I would rather be a dead atheist,
who had sacrificed his life for hu
manity than sit smug, selfish, a lazy
member of a privileged class," de
clared Sherwood Eddy at an informal
dinner at the Union last night. Eddy
attacked the people who remain pas
sionless and unmoved before "vast,
congested, selfish wealth unshared;
poverty unrelieved, a vindicative pa
gan penal system."
Addressing his hearers as "fellow
students," he offered two alternatives,
I "a world of brotherhood, with unsel
fish human co-operation—or a world
of battle, red in tooth and claw." He
presented as the solution for human-
ity's problems the brotherhood of
man.
"We can stop war just as truly as
slavery was stopppd. Public sentiment
is changing; a world consciousness is
awakening. We should be alert, pre-,
pared, instructed to do something. I
do not mean the simple, empty word,
brotherhood; rather do I mean the
full sharing" of life, creation's final
law."
The most sensitive part of the body is
the tip of the tongue.
