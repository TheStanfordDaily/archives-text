PULLMAN, Wash., Jan. 23. (P.1.P.)
- Glenn S. (Pop) Warner, great Stan
lord grid mentor and perhaps the ace
of football strategists of the country,
baa consented to give a two weeks'
coaching course at Washington State
College from June 17 to June 29, in
clusive, according to a wire received
today by J. Fred (Doc) Bohler, direc
tor of athletics.
Professor Bohler and other W.S.C.
authorities have been trying to obtain
Warner's consent to give a course in
football coaching at Washington State
during the summer school since the
opening of the football season last
September, but until recently the
Stanford coach had said he wouldn't
conduct a course this coming summer.
Last year, Warner and Howard Jones,
Trojan mentor, gave a coaching
<x>urse at the Colorado Agricultural
College.
"Northwest coaches should feel ex
trf mely fortunate in getting a man
of the caliber of Warner here to han
dle the classes in football coaching,"
Bohler says. "He has had more than
:10 years of continuous experience in
football tutoring and no less a grid
master than the famous Knute
Kockne, Notre Dame coach, has called
him the craftiest and most outstand
ing football coach in the United
States. He has developed more s}'s
tems and types of football than any
other grid teacher who has ever
lived."
