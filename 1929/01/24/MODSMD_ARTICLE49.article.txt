# REVOCATION OF CATHOLIC CHURCH WILLIAMS' THESIS
## 
### 
Basing his talk on the thesis that
the Catholic Church is up-to-date, that
its revivification during recent years
has been a source of wonder to all
observers, and that it is now making
significant contributions to world
thought, Michael Williams, addressing
last night members of the Junipero
Serra Club and an audience which
filled the Women's Clubhouse, pre
sented many interesting and signifi
cant views of the modern church.
The great turning-point in Catholic
and world history occurred in 1922 at
the election of the present Pope,
where Mr. Williams was present as a
newspaper correspondent. It was at
that time that the new Pope, as a
symbol of the preparation of the
church to emerge from the isolation
which had bound it since the unifica
tion of Italy in 1870, addressed the
multitudes of Rome from the balcony
of St. Peters, instead of limiting his
auditors to the few who could gain
admittance. At the present time this
emergence is being consumated by
the- agreement with the Italian gov
ernment which is now attracting the
attention of the world.
