# California Honor System Farce, Says History Fellow
## 
### 
The honor system at the University
of California is a farce, according to
a letter in yesterday's Daily Cali
fornian, written by George Tays, fel
low in the department of history.
The letter said that in the final ex
â– j animations last December, in the po
litical science class of Former Presi
dent David P. Barrows, practically all
the students in the class were sitting
on the steps of Wheeler Hall, reading
the questions and checking the an
swers in their books.
"Cheating in the finals was flagrant
and without precedent," the letter
I concluded.
