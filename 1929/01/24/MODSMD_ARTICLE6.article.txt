# BARRIE DRAMA IS ONE OF HARDEST EVER DONE HERE
## 
### 
Three hundred pounds for a college
education!
This sum of money, promised by
the three Wylie brothers in Scotland
to the young and ambitious John
Shand in return for his promise to
marry their sister Maggie, is the
starting-point of Sir James Barrie's
play, "What Every Woman Knows,"
as well as the beginning of John
Shand's political career.
Shand, whose love for books is so
great that it impels him to steal into
the Wylie library, is discovered by
the brothers, Alick, David, and James.
As Maggie has always been rather a
plain little woman, the brothers in
their affection for her make Shand
promise to marry Maggie in return
for his college education.
Jack McDowell will make his first
campus appearance as John Shand,
whose political fortunes rise to great
heights mostly by the secrets that
"every woman knows." The Shand
role is difficult in that it requires a
characterization of an Englishman
Mho is stubborn enough to insist on
his own way. but is not quite sensi
tive enough to see that it is Maggie
who suggests all his actions that lead
to the greatest success.
"The Barrie play is one of the most
difficult things I have ever done,"
said Gordon Davis last night at re
hearsal. "The parts are all quite diffi
cult as they require a great deal of
characterization, and a Scotch dialect
which is not easy to acquire. Then,
too, there is a definite rhythm about
the lines that is extremely hard to
express in the action."
