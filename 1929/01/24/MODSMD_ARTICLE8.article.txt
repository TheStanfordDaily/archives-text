WASHINGTON, Jan. 23. (Jp)—'Tar- !
iff, taxes, and prohibition put addi
tional thousands of words today into j
the Congressional Record and at the j
end of the day the Senate passed the j
bill containing an item of $24,000,000 j
for prohibition enforcement and $75,-
000,000 for tax refunds.
In approving this measure the de
ficiency appropriation bill, a stipula
tion was made that hereafter tax re- j
funds of more than $10,000 shall be j
made only after public hearings be
fore a treasury committee.
Inasmuch as the Senate approved
the prohibition item yesterday, the !
wet and dry discussion was largely
on the House side of the Capital
where varying views were expressed
by leaders. The House must approve
the action and its membershin today
was busily engaged in discussing pos
sible action on the measure.
Cramton, of Michigan, a leader of
the Drys, expressed the opinion that j
the Senate had acted unwisely, while
Laguardia of New York, a Wet, was
in favor of the plan. The New Yorker
advanced the theory that modification
of the dry law might be brought about
through its strict enforcement. Cram
ton held the prohibition unit had not
asked for funds.
Tax refunds occupied most of the
Senate's session with Senator McKel
lar of Tennessee, talking in favor of
a proposal to have tax refund;* in ex
cess of $10,000 handled by tho Board
of Tax Appeals rather than by the
Internal Revenue Commissioner. Con
siderable opposition, however, devel
oped to the plan which recently was
opposed by Secretary Mellon.
