# SENIORS DECIDE TO MAKE STUDY OF CAMPUS LIFE
## 
### 
That the Senior Class should send
I out a questionnaire on various fea
j tures of University life was favored
by the members of the class at the
meeting held last night in Room 214.
| This questionnaire will include ques
tions on various popular topics includ
ing that of abolishing the Lower Divi
sion.
The question of the Endowment
Fund was discussed and three plans
j of endowment were brought up which
were: that the general University
j fund be endowed, that a special chair
'be endowed for research material,
and that the fund go toward building
the theatre. There was much discus
i sion as to the character of the fund,
i It was decided, however, to create a
j fund for a specific purpose. It is not
certain whether or not this action in
! eludes a gift to the University witli
i out "strings" attached to it.
For the benefit of those not pres-
I ent at the meeting it should be
pointed out that the endowment fund
is a voluntary gift made by members
of the class. Each member pledges a
certain amount to be given by him
each year after his graduation.
Milliard Gift'en, Beverly McAnear,
and Richard Guggenhime have been
j appointed to investigate the various
I types of funds suggested and will re
port. at a meeting of the class to
held within two weeks for final con
! federation of the matter.
