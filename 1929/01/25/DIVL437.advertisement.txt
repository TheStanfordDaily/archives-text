Gentlemen:
The tobacco samples you sent me
have been received, and they are great.
If you can picture in your mind the
lonesomeness of a traveling man in a
small town on a rainy night, not a
friend in a hundred miles, nothing to
do and no place to go:
That was the position I was in when
your samples of Edgeworth came. It
was like a voice from above when I
opened the package and got the old
pipe steaming.
I have smoked various brands of
tobacco for the past fifteen years, but
never in my life have I found a to
bacco at any price that will equal
Edgeworth. It does not bite the
tongue, and a beautiful aroma follows.
With the good old friend pipe and a
can of Edgeworth you can dream of
the rainbow's end.
Please count me in the future as an
Edgeworth booster.
Very truly,
(Signed) A1 Stanley
