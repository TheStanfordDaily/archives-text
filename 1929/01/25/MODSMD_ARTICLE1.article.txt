# CARNEGIE BUILDS LABORATORY FOR PLANT RESEARCH
## Fifty Acres on Campus Are Leased for Plant Study; Photosynthesis Chief Aim Dr. H. A. Spoehr, Famous for Organic Chemistry, Head; May Learn Sugar Secret 
### 
By WILLIAM GRACE
'['he Stanford Farm is to be the new
home for the Carnegie Institute's Coastal
Laboratory, it was announced last night.
The building is to be on Governor's Ave
nue, back of the Museum toward the old
Stanford residence.
Dr. H. A. Spoehr, nationally known
expert on plant chemistry and leading j
authority on photosynthesis, is head of
the laboratory. For the past seven years
it has been situated at Carmel, but it was
found that the faculties and equipment
•of a university were necessary for satis
factory work.
University Land Leased
Fifteen acres of land have been leased
to Dr. Spoehr by the University for
building a hundred-thousand-dollar labo
ratory which will have a staff of eight or
ten technicians. The enterprise is inde
pendent of the University, except for
such co-operation as may be found ad
vantageous. Dr. Spoehr may give an
advanced chemistry course, but nothing
definite has been decided.
Study of organic application of light
is the chief purpose of the Coastal Labo
ratories. Most of its work will be de
voted to an attempt to produce laboratory
photosynthesis, a feat which has never
been accomplished. The new institution
will be a laboratory of plant physiology,
equipped to study all the chemical proc
esses which occur in plant life.
Spoehr Is Author
Photosynthesis is the action in plant I
leaves, of sunlight and chlorophyl, re
sulting in the production of plant sugar.
Synthetic chlorophyl has never been pro
duced in a laboratory. If Dr. Spoehr's
project is succcssful, it will mean that
actual synthesis of sugar will be pos
sible.
One of Dr. Spoehr's books, "Photosyn
thesis," was chosen in 1926 as one of the
twelve best books of the year by the j
American Library Association. It was
the only technical book to receive this
honor.

sulting in the production of plant sugar.
Synthetic chlorophyl has never been pro
duced in a laboratory. If Dr. Spoehr's
project is succcssful, it will mean that
actual synthesis of sugar will be pos
sible.
One of Dr. Spoehr's books, "Photosyn
thesis," was chosen in 1926 as one of the
twelve best books of the year by the j
American Library Association. It was
the only technical book to receive this
honor.
