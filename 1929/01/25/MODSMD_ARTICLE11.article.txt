$50; HI Cuadro, $50; Sequoia, $50; Bran
ner, $75; Hammer and Coffin, $100;
anonymous donor, $1000.
Further donations to the fund should
be made either to Comptroller Roth or
mailed to Box 15. According to Dick
Holt, who is a member of the Hammer
and Coffin committee behind the new the
atre movement, a committee will soon
be named to start working of! the cam
pus in an effort to enlarge the fund at a
more rapid pace.
An innovation in the social practices of
Toyon Club was made at the meeting
when it was decided to inaugurate Toyon
Club jolly-lips in the near future. If the
first one is a success the custom will be
continued.
It was also voted to give a main
moth smoker for the freshmen on Feb
ruary 27 in conjunction with Brainier
Club. Several local improvements were
authorized by the club and the meeting
was closed after a nomination commit
tee for the nominating of the second term
Toyon Club officers had been appointed.
