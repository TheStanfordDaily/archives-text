# Klamath River Committee To Investigate Value of Proposed Power System
## 
### 
Concluding the two days' session of
the California Development Associa
tion's Klamath River Study Commit
tee yesterday in Dean Hoover's of
fice, four special committees were ap
pointed to carry on further investi
gation. Five people connected with
Hie mining business in the Klamath
Basin testified before the committee
on the present mining situation, on
the estimated life of mining in the
Basin, and on the value of a power
system to the region.
According to Dean Hoover there
are three interested factions in the
Klamath situation: the California
sporting element who want the ter
ritory left open for hunting and fish
ing; the rural population of the Basin
who do not want sportsmen in the
vicinity of their homes; and the peo
ple of the Northern California cities
who want additional power plants on
the Klamath River because they be
lieve their cities will develop indus
trially if electric power is plentiful.
The last two factions opposed the
initiative measure four years ago by
which the state closed the river to
power development.
