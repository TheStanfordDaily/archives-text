# COACH HUSKY HUNT, ROTHERT CONFIDENT ON EVE OF BATTLE
## 
### 
Confidence in a favorable out
come in tomorrow's game—the first
of the Big Series— with California
was expressed last night by Coach
Husky Hunt and Captain Harlow
Rothert of the Card five.
"Judging by the improvement
which the team has made so far
this season," said Hunt, "they are
still on the upgrade. A great deal
depends on the three sophomores
who will start against California's
veterans. The way they stand up
under the Bear attack may decide
the issue."
Rothert said, "We h»ive been
pointing all season to this game.
Tomorrow night we arc going in
there for a fight to the finish."
