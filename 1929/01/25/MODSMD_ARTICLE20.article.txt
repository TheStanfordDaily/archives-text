# YEARLING QUINTET FAVORED IN GAME WITH BEAR CUBS
## Baker, Rintala, Doub, Kelly, Shrader Will Start in Tomorrow's Fray 
### 
Led by their newly elected captain,
Phil Baker, and with a record marred
i by only one defeat, Stanford's fresh
j man basketball quintet will take on
I the California Cubs at 7 o'clock to
morrow night in the Oakland Audi
! torium in the first of a three-game
series. The contest will be played as
a preliminary to the varsity-Bear
clash.
Comparative scores give the Card
| yearlings a good chance to win tomor
row night, the Blue and Gold five al
ready having been defeated by two
teams that have fallen before the
| Stanford team's onslaught. In an
J early-season game the Card babes
1 easily downed the St. Mary's frosh
by a score of 44 to 24; while last
Tuesday night the Gael youngsters
j succeeded in defeating the Califor
nians 17 to 13. The Stockton High
i School quintet, which recently tri
umphed over the Bear Cubs 29 to 17,
was also defeated by the Redshirts,
i3l to 23.
Bear Attack Tricky
Both teams play an entirely difTer
| ent type of basketball, the Stanford
ites using the shifting zone defense
and set offense; while the Bears de
pend on a man-to-man defense and
the "grape-vine" type of offense,
j Coach Bradshaw has been familiariz
ing his charges with the California
! attack, and they will enter the fray
tomorrow night fully prepared.
The Cards' probable starting lineup
j has been announced as follows; Kelly
j and Shrader, forwards, Doub, center,
I and Baker and Rintala, guards.
