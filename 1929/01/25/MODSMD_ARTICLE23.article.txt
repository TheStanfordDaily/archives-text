# CARDS GIVEN CHANCE TO WREAK VENGEANCE ON BEARS TOMORROW
## Redshirts May Stop Long String of California Victories; "Lower Division Five" Will Meet Crucial Test in Tilt With Nibs Price s Veteran Blue and Gold Cage Team 
### ANSON REEDER 
\ITHEN Card meets Bear tomorrow night in the Oakland Auditorium, it will
be a meeting of two undefeated Conference teams, one of which will
emerge victorious and the favorite to take the Southern Division of the
Pacific Coast loop.
Stanford will be handicapped to a great extent by injuries. Moffatt, second
string forward, was hurt last night in practice when he fell on his right elbow,
breaking a blood vessel, and automatically putting himself out of the line-up
for a few days.
Sexson, another forward, injured his shoulder in a fall during practice
Wednesday night, and is taking it easy around the court. Coach Hunt has
been keeping Tampcke, one of the guards, on the sidelines because of a bruised

$foot which he received in the Winged
! "O" game last Tuesday, while Faw
! cett, kingpin of the Card offense, has
been keeping Tampcke company a
good part of the time, nursing a
sprained ankle and a bad case of
I charleyhorse.
Reports from Berkeley show the
Californians to be "set" for the first
game of the "Big Series" which takes
place tomorrow. The Bears have suf
fered no injuries all season with the
exception of "Frenchy" Larrieu, star
forward, who was forced out of the
| second game of the Cal-U.S.C. series
with a broken arm. The remainder of
their squad is in A1 condition.
Offense Planned
In the game with California, Coach
Hunt will probably use the fast break
j ing offense which was so successful
against the Trojans last Saturday,
i Their defense will consist of the same
: five-man zone affair that they have
| been developing all season.
California's specialty offense are
: long shots by the guards, or Stevens,
at forward, with Captain Corbin, and
Teneyck, the other forward, following

in. Corbin is six feet two inches, and
I Teneyck is six feet four. They usually
take it off the backboard and sink a
I sucker shot —unless there are a cou-
I
pie of good guards there to stop them.
•On the defense the Bears play a regu
: lar five-man defense with the three
; biggest men in the front line attempt
i ing to break up the passing attack
before the opposing team gets in near
the basket.
Depends on Sophs
A great deal depends on the three
sophomores who are playing their
first varsity game against California
i tomorrow night. If they come through
as they have so far this season and
play the whole game without a let
down, the Cards may win. Beyond
j that it is impossible to make any pre-
I dictions.

| second game of the Cal-U.S.C. series
with a broken arm. The remainder of
their squad is in A1 condition.
Offense Planned
In the game with California, Coach
Hunt will probably use the fast break
j ing offense which was so successful
against the Trojans last Saturday,
i Their defense will consist of the same
: five-man zone affair that they have
| been developing all season.
California's specialty offense are
: long shots by the guards, or Stevens,
at forward, with Captain Corbin, and
Teneyck, the other forward, following

in. Corbin is six feet two inches, and
I Teneyck is six feet four. They usually
take it off the backboard and sink a
I sucker shot —unless there are a cou-
I
pie of good guards there to stop them.
•On the defense the Bears play a regu
: lar five-man defense with the three
; biggest men in the front line attempt
i ing to break up the passing attack
before the opposing team gets in near
the basket.
Depends on Sophs
A great deal depends on the three
sophomores who are playing their
first varsity game against California
i tomorrow night. If they come through
as they have so far this season and
play the whole game without a let
down, the Cards may win. Beyond
j that it is impossible to make any pre-
I dictions.
The line-up:
Stanford— California—

\ITHEN Card meets Bear tomorrow night in the Oakland Auditorium, it will
be a meeting of two undefeated Conference teams, one of which will
emerge victorious and the favorite to take the Southern Division of the
Pacific Coast loop.
Stanford will be handicapped to a great extent by injuries. Moffatt, second
string forward, was hurt last night in practice when he fell on his right elbow,
breaking a blood vessel, and automatically putting himself out of the line-up
for a few days.
Sexson, another forward, injured his shoulder in a fall during practice
Wednesday night, and is taking it easy around the court. Coach Hunt has
been keeping Tampcke, one of the guards, on the sidelines because of a bruised

$foot which he received in the Winged
! "O" game last Tuesday, while Faw
! cett, kingpin of the Card offense, has
been keeping Tampcke company a
good part of the time, nursing a
sprained ankle and a bad case of
I charleyhorse.
Reports from Berkeley show the
Californians to be "set" for the first
game of the "Big Series" which takes
place tomorrow. The Bears have suf
fered no injuries all season with the
exception of "Frenchy" Larrieu, star
forward, who was forced out of the
| second game of the Cal-U.S.C. series
with a broken arm. The remainder of
their squad is in A1 condition.
