What did the assembly for consideration of the Honor Code accom
plish ?
After hearing the reports of the investigation committee, it
J Voted almost unanimously not to publish names of violators
of the Code.
2 Voted to change the name of the Honor System to the Honor
Code.
Adopted the "program" of the committee, reserving the right
of future discussion of it before clothing it with official rai
ment as the Stanford Honor Code.
The assembly was successful; another will serve to make firm the
foundation of our new Code. What we need is some Organic Act which
shall set up the Honor Code to endure. Past'experience has shown that
a mere supposed honor spirit weakens in time; it has 110 definite expres
sion; it shifts like the shorelines. Constant vigilance, constant repetition
to incoming students of the Honor Code is the way by which the University
can be made safe for examinations.
You may talk high ideals till the sun goes down and you may shout
shibboleths such as "the proctor system as soon as student police," lnrt
you cannot get away from the fact that unless there is a recognized way
in which one may proceed against a person he sees cheating, 110 one will
attempt to see the Honor Code enforced. Such a procedure the commit
tee has outlined.
In order to re-present the case, we take the liberty of again printing
the statement of the Honor Code:
Honorable conduct in acadcmic work is the spirit of conduct at Stanford Uni
versity.
Such is the fiat of the Associated Students; upon it rest both the tradition of
honor and the machinery by which offenders of the tradition are brought to an
accounting.
Defined, honorable conduct means "the refraining from giving or receiving
unpermitted aid in examinations, class exercises, reports, or any other work that is
to be used by the instructor as a basis of grading." It is the antithesis of cheating;
so defined, it is to be recognized; even by those unfamiliar with the Stanford Honor
System, as simply the code of a gentleman.
Every Stanford student subscribes to the spirit of honorable conduct when he
first registers in the University. In his first registration book is included a state
ment which he is expected to sign, to wit:
"I hereby acknowledge that I am fully aware of the fact that honor
able conduct in academic work—i.e., the refraining from giving or receiving
unpermitted aid in examinations, class exercises, reports, or any other work
that is to be used by the instructor as a basis of grading—is the spirit of
conduct in this University.
(Signed) "
On every examination book appears:
HONORABLE CONDUCT
in academic work is the spirit of conduct in this University.
SUGGESTIONS FOR CONDUCT
1. Occupy alternate seats where possible.
2. When in doubt as to the meaning of a question, consult the in
structor. He will be found in his office.
Inasmuch as enforcement of the Honor System is the concern of everyone (for
under the competitive grading system a grade bettered by unfair means raises the
class average), it is the interest and the duty of a student to proceed against a cheat
er, once detected. Accordingly, the Associated Students recommend the following
course of action:
Tap on your desk with your pen, in order to warn the one cheating that he is
discovered. It is his place to leave the examination room without turning in his
paper. You should investigate to see whether he complies. If he turns in his
paper, then you should report him to the Council.
If upon trying the case, the Council finds the offender guilty, lie is automatically
suspended from the University.
If he does not turn in his paper, there is 110 need of further prosecution, for it
is considered that by forfeiting his chance for a grade he has not completed the
act of cheating.
