Elizabeth Jackson, freshman debater, comes out bitterly in Campus
Opinion against the way yesterday's assembly was conducted by Presi
dent Cavalero during the last few minutes. He railroaded the motions
through, and actually allowed the motion to accept the committee's report
to be passed after a motion to adjourn bad been passed, says Miss Jack
son. As a matter of fact, the motion to adjourn was never declared
carried; so the motion to accept the report was in order. Cavalero also
is charged with having been biased. To I>e sure, strict impartiality is
desirable in a chairman, but yet to be biased in favor of the honor spirit
is a wholesome vice. Miss Jackson's charges do not persuade us.
