One hundred and fifty members of the Young Australia League are
to visit the campus today to see the University and to be entertained by
Stanford students.
Those of the Stanford student body who play baseball learned a good
deal about the Antipodes on their tour last summer; it is to be hoped that
the Australians will receive as good an impression of us as our men did
of them.
