## A FRESHMAN OBJECTS TO THE ASSEMBLY
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A freshman, coming into the Uni
versity with a memory of the defects
and frequently rather childish proce
dure of high school self-government,
naturally anticipates with some inter
est the prospect of university student
rule. Perhaps, however, he is too
hopeful in expecting a more deliber
ate and adult attitude, or better ob
servance of parliamentary rules, or
less "railroading" of issues, in the
university assembly.

Knowing that many students think
as I do on this point, I should like to
raise an objection to the unfair, con
fused, not to mention infantile way
in which the business at the end of
the assembly of Thursday morning
was dispatched.

There was little time left; the two
previous measures before the assem
bly had been discussed to everyone's
satisfaction, and passed. There re
mained the question of the adoption
of the Committee's report. The Presi
dent of the student body, acting as
chairman, asked if it was ready to be
put to a vote .There was some discus
sion, then discussion of adjournment.
The President again asked if all were
ready for the question. Three men
stood up; of these one was recognized
and his objection (to the "railroad
ing" through of an issue on which fur
ther discussion was desired) was
overruled by the chairman himself.
A motion for adjournment was made;
it was seconded and carried. Then,
for the third time, the assembly was
asked to consider the question of the
Committee's report. Again three men
arose; of these one was recognized,
and it was his suggestion upon which
the vote was finally taken. This was:

the temporary acceptance of the Com
mittee's report without actual adop
tion of it as part of the honor institu
tion (alternately called "code" and
"system").
So the assembly (or what was left
of it), with two men still yvanting
recognition, several desiring further
discussion, and the motion so con
futed and so modified that many had
only a faint idea of the exact word
ing of the measure, was hurried to
a vote.
General assembly and open forum
is, perhaps, the most ideal function
of student self-government, but there
is a profound difference between dis
cussion supervised by an impartial
chairman and confused mob opinion
hurried into a premature vote by a
chairman obviously biased. That the
time should have been limited and
that the students should have felt
that they could not remain overtime
was unfortunate, but in such a case,
with nearly half the assembly wish
ing further discussion of the question,
a vote should have been postponed
until another student assembly could
have been called.
A disorderly, partially broken-up
meeting such as the end of this as
sembly was, handled by a chairman
who was distinctly unfair to certain
members and who helped to increase
the general confusion by accepting a
motion for adjournment when there
was a motion previously before the
house, and then by returning to the
first motion, not only tends to dis
illusion the student who expects well
organized and adult procedure, but
puts the whole mechanism of serious
student self-rule in a ridiculous and
trivial light. â€”Elizabeth Jackson.
