# WHAT? RUIN COLLEGE ATMOSPHERE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
When this squabble over the Row-
Roble situation started, I thought
that some damn fool must be trying
to ruin what little we have left here
of college atmosphere.
That sentence is wrong in two
places. First there is no Roble-Row
situation. Everyone is adjusted, and
there wasn't a bit of fuss until some
other boy tried to tell the girls what
to do.
Second, the fool part seems to be
out because some really intelligent
people are quite worked up over a
vote on something or other. We ought
to have some co-operation in promot
ing the advancement of both Roble
and the Row, instead of starting a
good fight so we can stand by and
watch it.
Of course people are trying to make
the world a better place for the 500
to live in, but what happens to our

| college? A threatened end is already
;on as in the plan to abolish the
Lower Division. College atmosphere,
as it is now at staid old Harvard, is
threatening to die out. Who is it that
| doesn't believe that the peppy youth
isn't better off because of the free
dom, fun, and life of our college?
Take away sororities and a college
institution and feature is gone.
Then, too, we can appeal to the wo
-1 men. Stanford women are rated un
, favorably as social assets by the men
of the various colleges. We all admit
that they have nice personalities, but
| that the majority of them are "A"
students. Of course we all know some
nice girls, but then, too, the Dumbar-
I ton Bridge wasn't built entirely for
j looks. Why take away one of the
I things that our poor, little, over-man
-1 handled five hundred has in common
I with girls of other universities?
Yours for sanity, Soph.
