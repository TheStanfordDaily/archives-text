# AN OFFER TO BOYCOTT THE B.A.C.
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
If the sorority question has been
sufficiently aired, may I bring up
again the matter of behavior at foot
ball games, which I can hardly con
sider to have been satisfactorily set
tled, in spite of the gentle hints
dropped to rooters by the Associated
Students. For one thing, drinking and
bad language among the onlookers is
by no means confined to the rooting
section. Alumni set a very bad exam
ple.
I make this suggestion. Alumni and
members of the faculty who prefer
decency can secure it by refusing to
apply for tickets for the Big Game
until the Board of Athletic Control
gives assurance that the games will
be properly policed and order main
tained. If one or two drunken row
dies, men and women, were summar
ily ejected, the trouble would soon
be over.
Possibly the Board is afraid to un
detake this. We can drive them to it
with a greater fear —one that will
touch their treasury. There is a suf
ficient number of those who usually
attend the Big Game who would pre
fer to have order maintained, even
if they had to remain away from the
1929 game to secure such a result. I,
for one, pledge myself to make no
application for the tickets to which
I um entitled until assured that ordi
nary decency will be observed. Who
is next? —Finem Respice.
