The Editor, Sir:
I have been reading the Dippy for
three years and I have never seen a
more attractive issue than the one
which the boy so vehemently objected
to in Tuesday's Campus Opinion.
Roy! That was a daisy! What we
need around here is more of that
stuff. Some of us don't get to read
the leading city dailies, and so miss
some of tho important current hap
penings in this happy land of ours.
What I mean is that the camera can
tell the story very often in much less
space than the most flowery writers
can.
I bet there ain't many around here
who would rather read als of the
big corporations, which after all is
just apple-polishing; or announce
ments of the latest fads in the ladies'

footwear, than rest their eyes on such
suave bits of the camera man's handi
work which you printed the other
day. That was just like sitting down
after running a mile.
As for interviews, there are fine
interviews in the Dippy which Ben
and Phil write, and it is much more
better that our paper be Cardinal
rather than crimson.
Yours for more Texas beauties and
aviatrices! —Country Boy.
