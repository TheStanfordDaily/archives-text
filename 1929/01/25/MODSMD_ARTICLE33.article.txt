# "SOMEONE IS CHEATING IN THIS CABINET"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Those of us who have heen some
what disappointed with the action of
certain politicians in the past admin
istrations are greatly relieved to see
that such eminent men as Dr. Wilbur
are being at least considered as pos
sible members of the cabinet. As much
as we would regret the great loss of
Dr. Wilbur, it would be very gratify
ing to feel that everything would be
absolutely correct. We might even
allow ourselves to imagine that Dr.
Wilbur would stand up at some cabi
net meeting and exclaim, "Someone
is cheating in this cabinet; will he
kindly leave?"
Yours for more men of the caliber
of our nationally known president,
â€”Frank It. Sauliere, *29
