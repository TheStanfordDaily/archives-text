# ANOTHER INVESTIGATION CALLED FOR
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Have you ever had occasion to visit
the men's washroom in the Library?
Without a doubt it is one of the most
unclean places that I have ever
visited. If you don't agree with my
statement just go around some after
noon about four o'clock. Can't some
thing be done to remedy this situa
tion? This is short and "sweet" but
to the point. â€”K.
