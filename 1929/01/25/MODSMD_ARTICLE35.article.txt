"The Beggar's Opera"—Curran.
So unique is this ballad opera that
it deserves special recommendation.
It is a nonsensical satire of Old Eng
land, and presents the most unusual
and colorful array of characters ever
assembled on one stage.
There is a prologue in which a tat
tered beggar explains to the audience
that the opera he has written has not
a respectable character in it —every
| man and woman is a thief of the first
| rank. And then the fun begins when
| Mrs. Peachum, a silly old sinner, re
j veals her daughter's secret marriage
; to a handsome highwayman, to Peach
j um, stellar rogue.
I Quaint Old English music is one of
i the most attractive features of this
J show—a women's orchestra accom
j panies the band of hold-up people in
J their merry songs and dances. The
; jollity of the "disreputables" is truly
contagious. The audience of 1929
laughs as whole-heartedly as the Lon
don theatre-goers of 172S did.
It is impossible to describe "The
Beggar's Opera"—you must see it for
! yourself. Thoroughly delightful bur
lesque with a pleasing cast is our
j summary. —Ben Maddox.
