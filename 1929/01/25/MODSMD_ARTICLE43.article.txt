Tomorrow night the Cards will
meet the Bears in the first game
of the 1929 annual Big Series.
The date is January 25, and
whether it is a coincidence or
commemoration of a certain
event which took place just thir
teen years ago tomorrow, no one
seems to know or cares much
less to investigate. Notwithstand
ing, the memorable event took
place, and to those bulging
muscled, high-minded hoop stars
of that day, it was a victory more
precious than a conference flag.
For on January 26, 1916, basket- ,
ball was made a major sport at
Stanford.
Previous to that time the Redshirts
had passed through three mediocre
seasons with the court game still a '
minor sport. They played in a loop .
then known as the Northern Califor
nia League, composed of such teams ,
as Santa Clara, St. Ignatius, St. Marys, ,
and California.
It was in 1913 that Stanford first
had a basketball team, and then it
was an unofficial representation, the j
team being called the Encina Gymna- I
sium quintet. February 14 of that I
year the trustees passed a resolution
allowing basketball games to be
played on the Encina Gym court. An- I
nouncement was made that enough of
a charge would be made to defray the j
expenses of the visiting teams. "It i
was best," the paper stated, "that
women do not attend these contests."
To the quaint co-ed of 1913 the reason !
seemed evident.
On March 7 of that year, California !
and Stanford met on the court for the i
first time. The game was played at j
Harmon gym in Berkeley, the Bears !
winning 28-14. Two weeks later they j
won the second and last game of the j
series 22-13.
In 1914, the Cards and Bears had !
their first official meeting. The Red- |
shirts, after passing through a mildly j
successful season, succumbed to a j
bewildering Bear attack in two hard
fought games. i
One of the things which was instru- '
mental in making basketball a major
instead of a minor sport was the or
ganization of the California-Nevada
league in 1916. Practically the same
members as belonged to the Northern
California league with the addition of
the University of Nevada, and College
of Pacific, made up this new organiza
tion. Nevada at that time had a crack ;
hoop squad.
With the organizing of the
Pacific Coast Conference in 1919-
20, additional interest in cage
teams became widespread. Walter |
Powell was made basketball
coach, and the Cards began build
ing a team which was destined to
take the Conference and the Cali
fornia series in 1921.
During that year the team traveled
up and down the coast for series after
series, eliminating the individual
teams rather than a section at a time
as is now the t case. It was a tough
season and by the time the Cal series

was reached it looked as though the
squad would not be able to finish the
grind, at least in tiie lead. The first
game of the group the Bears won
handily. The Cards left soon after the
contest for Seattle where they won
one game over the Cougars, and lost
two to the Huskies. Curtains would
have been the proper setting when
the Redshirts returned home, but they
still had a chance to take the con
ference if they whipped California in
the remaining two games. These con
tests were played on two successive
nights, Stanford winning both of
them, the first 30-25, and the second
25-21. Two men, one of them now
basketball coach at the College of the
Pacific, and the other a San Fran
cisco broker, were mainly responsible
for these two brilliant victories, the
latter making seventeen of the Cards'
twenty-five points in the final tilt.
Like the team this year, the
1921 varsity has a great second
half team, winning most of their
games in that period, after trail
ing the opposing team through
out the early part of the game.
They were a great offensive team
depending on speed and a daz
zling short pass attack to over
come their opponents' defense.
That was the last year Stanford
won a basketball series from Cali
fornia. Since that time the Card hoop
teams have been just that and noth
ing more. They were seldom a threat,
and little feared in the race for Con
ference honors.
This year critics believed it was
the same thing over again, only prob
ably a little worse than usual, with
all the new material to mold into
something resembling a cage squad.
People shook their heads in dismay
and wondered how many more years
it would be before Stanford had a
winning basketball team. Then the
team started the new year by winning
a couple of close decisions, and every
one began to sit up and take note.
Not long after they played their first
conference game with the U.C.L.A.
and won handily. The next victims
were the Trojans of Southern Cali
fornia, and the Olympic Club team.
As the season progressed people be
gan to attend the contests and show

some interest in the great indoor
sport. After the defeat of the Winged
"O" the count for the new year stood:
games won, Stanford 6, opponents 0,
and the first tilt of the Big Series
only four days away. So from the ap
pearance of things the game tomor
row night should be a great test for
Stanford's Lower Division five, and
the veterans from east of the Campa
nile.
