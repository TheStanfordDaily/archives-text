# APPROPRIATION IN HOUSE; SENATORS DEBATE CRUISERS
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 25 (/P).â€” j
I The Senate got down to real business j
j today with the cruiser building bill which '
the House sent over a year ago, while!
i the House prepared to grapple with the ;
| $24,000,<X)0 prohibition enforcement pro-j
I posal which the Senate inserted in the I
! deficiency appropriation bill earlier this j
j week.
It was clear that consideration of both j
of these measures would be attended by
I much oratory. A mention in the House j
| that the Senate had returned the defi- |
i ciency hill resulted in requests from vari- j
ous quarters for information as to when j
and how the question would be handled, j
presaging a renewal in that branch of j
] Congress of the prohibition argument
which has been occupying the Senate on I
recent days.
The preliminary expressions from j
House members indicated an unusual
lineup, with wets and drys grouped in
some instances in favor of the Senate
plan, and in other quarters opposing it.
Secretary Mellon lias disapproved of i
such an increase in dry funds until a j
survey could be made.
