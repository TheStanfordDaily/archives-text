# Student Body Opposes Publicity For Violators Of "Honor Code"
## Report of Investigation Committee Accepted at Special Assembly; Name "System" Changed to "Code" 
### ALICE INGRAHAM 
Names of violators of the Honor
Code will not be published, it was
decided by a unanimous vote of the
student body in assembly yesterday
morning. Furthermore, the name
"Honor System" was changed to
"Honor Code," and the program pro
posed by the A.S.S.U. Committee for
the Investigation of the Honor System
was accepted with the provision that
further discussion will be held at an
assembly in the near future, when the
program will be open to suggestion,
addition, or amendment.
The program accepted was the one
which Phil Cavalero read at the be
ginning of the meeting, and included
the following four points: 1. A re
definition of the code, narrowing its
application to work to be used as a
basis of grading. 2. A revised pledge.
3. Rules concerning student conduct
during examinations. 4. Methods of
procedure in case of violation of the
code.
Committee Reports
Templeton Peck, chairman of the
investigating committee, reported the
findings of that body, and enlarged
upon the program presented to the
student body by Cavalero.
The discussion from the floor con
tained the following arguments: that

people were trying too hard to find !
cheating, that the reputation of Stan- ;
ford depends upon the honesty of its
graduates, and thus determines the
worth of our diplomas; that publish
ing the name of a violator will punish
his family and ruin him; that under
j this rule it would be hard to convict
j a violator. In the discussion of
j whether the name should be Honor
j System or Honor Code, the following
j arguments were used: that a Stanford
student should have a code, not a
system; that honor, not the honor
j system, is an institution.
Faculty Blamed
One student placed the failure of
I the Honor System on the faculty.
! Another suggested that the seniors
| explain the honor code to the fresh
men. Some students felt that it made
no difference whether the name "Sys
! tem" or "Code" was used; that those
! who believe in honor will carry out
i the rules no matter what the name is.
The date for an assembly for fur
! ther discussion of the program sub
-1 niitted by the committee has not been
determined. Campus Opinions con
| cerning the honor code, if they are to
the point, will be very helpful in tell
ing the reaction of the student body,
which is the information that the com
mittee is trying to get, according to
j Cavalero.

no difference whether the name "Sys
! tem" or "Code" was used; that those
! who believe in honor will carry out
i the rules no matter what the name is.
The date for an assembly for fur
! ther discussion of the program sub
-1 niitted by the committee has not been
determined. Campus Opinions con
| cerning the honor code, if they are to
the point, will be very helpful in tell
ing the reaction of the student body,
which is the information that the com
mittee is trying to get, according to
j Cavalero.
Names of violators of the Honor
Code will not be published, it was
decided by a unanimous vote of the
student body in assembly yesterday
morning. Furthermore, the name
"Honor System" was changed to
"Honor Code," and the program pro
posed by the A.S.S.U. Committee for
the Investigation of the Honor System
was accepted with the provision that
further discussion will be held at an
assembly in the near future, when the
program will be open to suggestion,
addition, or amendment.
The program accepted was the one
which Phil Cavalero read at the be
ginning of the meeting, and included
the following four points: 1. A re
definition of the code, narrowing its
application to work to be used as a
basis of grading. 2. A revised pledge.
3. Rules concerning student conduct
during examinations. 4. Methods of
procedure in case of violation of the
code.
Committee Reports
Templeton Peck, chairman of the
investigating committee, reported the
findings of that body, and enlarged
upon the program presented to the
student body by Cavalero.
The discussion from the floor con
tained the following arguments: that

people were trying too hard to find !
cheating, that the reputation of Stan- ;
ford depends upon the honesty of its
graduates, and thus determines the
worth of our diplomas; that publish
ing the name of a violator will punish
his family and ruin him; that under
j this rule it would be hard to convict
j a violator. In the discussion of
j whether the name should be Honor
j System or Honor Code, the following
j arguments were used: that a Stanford
student should have a code, not a
system; that honor, not the honor
j system, is an institution.
Faculty Blamed
One student placed the failure of
I the Honor System on the faculty.
! Another suggested that the seniors
| explain the honor code to the fresh
men. Some students felt that it made
no difference whether the name "Sys
! tem" or "Code" was used; that those
! who believe in honor will carry out
i the rules no matter what the name is.
