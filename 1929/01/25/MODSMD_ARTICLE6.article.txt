### 
Granat Brothers, Winter League
leaders, will meet the Stanford base
ball nine tomorrow afternoon at 2:150
o'clock on the varsity diamond. Man
ager Frank Sears of the San Fran
cisco team has announced that Prince
Oana, graduate of St. Louis College
in Honolulu, will start on the mound
for the visitors. Oana has an impres
sive record, and is expected to pitch
a good brand of ball.
Kern and Hardy will be the start
ing battery for the Cards. The former
has had two years of varsity experi
ence, and has a large assortment of
curve balls. Hardy, last year's fresh
man catcher, is a good hitter, and
has a good throwing arm. Ralph Cook
will hold down first base for the var
sity. Cook demonstrated that he can
hit by getting three for three in the
contest with the faculty last week.
The keystone positions will be
filled by Johnson and Sampson. Both
are fair hitters, and they work well
together in the field. Paul Magee will
play third base to complete the in
field lineup for the Cards.
Captain Frank Wilton will play
ctnterfield in tomorrow's game. Wil
ton has not quite been up to par in
his playing this year; last season lie
was one of the most consistent hit
ters on the team. The other two out
fielders, Hunken and Wright, are
about the best hitters on the team.
In selecting his lineup, Coacli Harry
Wolter has picked his men on hitting
rather than fielding ability, so he ex
pects the team to gather many bingles
tomorrow despite the fact that he is
putting a rather green team on the
diamond.
