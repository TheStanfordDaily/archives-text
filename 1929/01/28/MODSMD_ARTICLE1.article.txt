# PAN-HELLENIC TO DECIDE SORORITY ABOLITION VOTE
## Row Organization Will Meet At 5 O'Clock to Determine Sorority Action on Campus Proposed Balloting System Includes Individual Signed Ballots From Ten Houses 
### 
Whether or not Stanford's sororities
will vote on the question of their own
abolition will be decided by Pan-
Hellenic today.
If Pan-Hellenic in its meeting at 5
o'clock today rules to test the sorority
sentiment, the houses on the Row will
take up the problem in their indi
vidual meetings tonight. The Row
vote on the matter will definitely
open or close the question of the
existence of women's sororities on
this campus.
Sorority Question
In the case of a vote, it will be the
Row women alone who will cast bal
lots on the matter. Janet Harris,
president of A.W.S., recently stated
that the question of the abolition of
sororities rested with the sorority
women themselves. The administra- '
tion, according to Dean Yost, can do I
nothing in the matter, and all action
on this problem must be initiated on
the Row.
Kllen Woerner, president of Pan- j
Hellenic, announces that a large ma
jority in favor of the proposed aboli- j
tion will be necessary to do away with
the ten sorority groups. The details of ,
the balloting will be determined by
Pan-Hellenic's action.
Individual Ballots
It has been suggested that the bal- j
loting, provided it is desired by Pan- j
Hellenic, be done individually by the i
women on the Row. It is proposed I
that individual ballots be secured on ,
the question, rather than the entire j
living group's casting its vote as a
body with an affirmative or negative !
vote.
Several years ago, the sorority ;
question came up before the campus
and the individual living groups cast
their ballots as a single unit. It was
felt that this vote did not adequately
express the sentiment of the Row.
At that time, six out of the ten houses
voted for their own maintenance at
the University.

that individual ballots be secured on ,
the question, rather than the entire j
living group's casting its vote as a
body with an affirmative or negative !
vote.
Several years ago, the sorority ;
question came up before the campus
and the individual living groups cast
their ballots as a single unit. It was
felt that this vote did not adequately
express the sentiment of the Row.
At that time, six out of the ten houses
voted for their own maintenance at
the University.
