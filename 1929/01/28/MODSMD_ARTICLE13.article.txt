# CALIFORNIA DEFEATS CARDINALS 41-23 IN HOOP SERIES OPENER
## Stanford Overwhelmed by Baffling Attack in Second Half; Poor Shooting Proves Bane to Redshirts, Missing Nineteen Of Twenty-Six Free Throws and Scoring Only Eight Goals 
### ANSON REEDER 
I OAFFLED by a slashing second half attack, the Cardinal basketball team
! was completely overwhelmed by its old rival, the Golden Bear, at the
| Oakland Auditorium Saturday night after leading 14 to 12 at the end of
the first period. The Stanford youngsters could not compete with the veteran
| Blue and Gold quintet in the final round and as a result lost the tilt by a
j 41-23 score.
At half time it looked like the affair might develop into a real contest,
! but the Bears returned to the game with something they had lacked previ
! ously, and proceeded /to annihilate the Stanford defense, scoring sixteen
! points before the Cards made a marker. Although Stevens, Bear forward, was

high-point man and individual star of the game, it was a young man named
I Coffield who started festivities for the Californians. Coffield plays one of the

£ guard positions regularly on Coach
Nibs Price's team but last night Price
chose to keep him out of the game,
for some unknown reason. The forced
lay-off must have instilled Mr. Coffield
with a desire to be heroic, for im
| mediately upon his entrance into the
1 fray things began to happen. This
J dark-haired gentleman seemed always
I to be at the end of the court at which
I he was needed, but his work, though
neat and methodical, bordered on
roughness at times. Soon after his ap
pearance in the game he made four
| free throws and a field goal in rapid
i succession to start the rally which
' put the Cards so far behind that they
never had a chance to recuporate.
First Half Close
Stanford, usually a second-half
j team, played its game during the first
j half Saturday, and when the final
period came around it had nothing to
show the huge crowd which packed
the Auditorium. The five-man defense
I which had stopped the Bears, re
| nowned tliree-man attack all during

' the first half went to pieces and the
; Californians began shooting them
from under, around, and before the
. basket.
i Another thing which aided Califor
nia, besides the fact that the Cards
went cold both offensively and de
! fensively the last half, was the Red
shirts' inability to make free throws.
! Figures for the game show that Stan
: ford was successful in only seven out
of twenty-six attempts, while the
Bears converted seven out of ten. If
! the Cards had made as many in pro
! portion to the number tried as Cali
fornia, it might have been a different
j story.
Week's Rest
This week will be a week of rest
for the Cardinals. No games are
scheduled except with U.C.L.A. in
! Los Angeles Friday and Saturday
