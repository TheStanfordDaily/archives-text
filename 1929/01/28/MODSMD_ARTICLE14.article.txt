# Freshman Cage Team Trounces Bear Cubs In Preliminary, 26-19
## 
### WHITNEY WRIGHT 
Setting a precedent which their ;
! elders failed to follow, the Stanford i
freshman cage team walloped the
California Cubs to the tune of 26-19
Saturday night as a preliminary to j
the Bear-Card varsity tilt. After a j
j nip-and-tuck first period in which the j
; Stanford boys clearly established
i their superiority, California came ,
i back in the second half to outplay i
their rivals from the "Farm," but I
were too weak a team to take advan
; tage of their position.
The game was a fight from the tip- j
off when Fran Smart, stellar Cub for
ward, slipped in to loop a shot from
the foul line before the game was fif-

teen seconds old. Before another fif- |
teen seconds liad ticked off, Rudy j
Rintala evened the score by sinking a ;
icng one from the center of the court.
California's "grapevine" offensive |
combined with their short bounce ■
passes gave Baker and Rintala, the
Cardinal guards, considerable trouble. j
Although Stanford early in the game
ran up a seven-point lead, the Bears
gradually recovered and the score
stood 8-11. Morris, substitute center, '
then put the Berkeleyites in the lead
when in quick succession he twice
dribbled into the goal for "sucker" j
shots. Shrader quickly put the Cards i
back in the lead, where they remained
the rest of the evening, by sinking a J
long shot from the sidelines. At half
time the score favored Stanford 19-12. j
The second half was much slower j
than the opening period. Each team
scored seven points. California gave '
the Cardinal rooters a bad three min
utes when they took shot after shot.
The Stanford youngsters apparently !
couldn't get possession of the ball. |
None of these shots, however, "hit j
the mark."
Fred Smart of California took high
point honors with seven counters to
his credit. Shrader, Rintala, and Lam- j
bert of Stanford were not far behind,
each scoring six points. Rintala and j
Doub were the best men on the floor
for Stanford. Rintala not only played
his consistently good game at guard
position but frequently dribbled inside j
the foul line for a try at the basket, i
Doub proved himself again to be a
fine defensive player, and he was also
an important part of the Cardinal at
tack.
The two teams will meet again
early next month.

Fred Smart of California took high
point honors with seven counters to
his credit. Shrader, Rintala, and Lam- j
bert of Stanford were not far behind,
each scoring six points. Rintala and j
Doub were the best men on the floor
for Stanford. Rintala not only played
his consistently good game at guard
position but frequently dribbled inside j
the foul line for a try at the basket, i
Doub proved himself again to be a
fine defensive player, and he was also
an important part of the Cardinal at
tack.
The two teams will meet again
early next month.

Setting a precedent which their ;
! elders failed to follow, the Stanford i
freshman cage team walloped the
California Cubs to the tune of 26-19
Saturday night as a preliminary to j
the Bear-Card varsity tilt. After a j
j nip-and-tuck first period in which the j
; Stanford boys clearly established
i their superiority, California came ,
i back in the second half to outplay i
their rivals from the "Farm," but I
were too weak a team to take advan
; tage of their position.
The game was a fight from the tip- j
off when Fran Smart, stellar Cub for
ward, slipped in to loop a shot from
the foul line before the game was fif-

teen seconds old. Before another fif- |
teen seconds liad ticked off, Rudy j
Rintala evened the score by sinking a ;
icng one from the center of the court.
California's "grapevine" offensive |
combined with their short bounce ■
passes gave Baker and Rintala, the
Cardinal guards, considerable trouble. j
Although Stanford early in the game
ran up a seven-point lead, the Bears
gradually recovered and the score
stood 8-11. Morris, substitute center, '
then put the Berkeleyites in the lead
when in quick succession he twice
dribbled into the goal for "sucker" j
shots. Shrader quickly put the Cards i
back in the lead, where they remained
the rest of the evening, by sinking a J
long shot from the sidelines. At half
time the score favored Stanford 19-12. j
The second half was much slower j
than the opening period. Each team
scored seven points. California gave '
the Cardinal rooters a bad three min
utes when they took shot after shot.
The Stanford youngsters apparently !
couldn't get possession of the ball. |
None of these shots, however, "hit j
the mark."
