# Asserted Evils of Sororities Could Not Be Eradicated By Only Abolishing Sororities
## 
### 
Pan-Hellenic meets today to decide whether a referendum on sorori
ties shall be held. The proposal is that the members of the women's ten
Greek letter societies vote, by secret ballot, on the abolition of their
groups.
A number of reasons urge the taking of such a vote, and a number
urge that it be not taken. The question of whether or not Stanford
women believe in the sorority system has a right to he settled. \ et,
Pan-Hellenic proposes to take the opinions of only the Row women,
leaving the llall women no voice in the matter. But how shall anyone
say what Stanford women want unless all of them are allowed to vote:'
To be sure, someone will reply, shouldn't sorority women alone be per
mitted to settle the question whether their houses should continue- No.
It seems to us that all the women ought to be allowed an expression as
to the system under which they are to live.

Assume that all of the 500 are given a voice in the settlement of the
issue; and, further, assume that the chorus shouts "Abolition" (the
issue would not necessarily be so decided by the fact of the 1 ln.ll women s
voting, we maintain), WHAT THEN? (Apologies to Brisbane.) As
long as living conditions remain as tney are, certain groups will have to
be housed in the edifices on Lasuen street; certain in Roble. Even with
the Greek letters erased and forever expunged from the doorsteps of
the former, the cliques would remain, though perhaps they would not be
as strong as some believe they now are.

But 011 the other hand, as soon as dormitory accommodations for
the women are provided, a ten-word bulletin coming from the President's
office will send the maids scurrying from their present quarters.
So, what will Pan-Hellenic's proposed vote decide? Nothing, my
lords and gentlemen. Jf it is restricted to sorority women, it will
answer the interesting question: do the said women believe in their
sororities? If it is extended to include the votes of all women, it will
show the administration what it is probably not the least concerned
about knowing, to-wit: whether or not, in building dormitories and
abolishing sororities, it will be popular. But the Pan-Hellenic vote can't
possibly speed our ultimate destiny.
