Thirteen editors of "Hell's Bells," U.C.L.A. scandal sheet, have been
suspended, among them being Captain Sam Baiter of the Bruin basketball
team and Monte Harrington, editor of the Daily Bruin. Faculty censor
ship of the pink outrage published by them was necessary. It was
simply "off with their heads!" when the Academic Council examined the
thinly-disguised smut which made up the content of the edition.
Anyone reading "Hell's Bells" would back the faculty's act of turn
ing thumbs down. There is no excuse for pornography, even though by
its very audacity it strikes one as amusing. Better had the U.C.L.A.
journalists kept on issuing Daily Bruins than have attempted to get
reader-interest by spreading dirt and moronic remarks over their front
page.
