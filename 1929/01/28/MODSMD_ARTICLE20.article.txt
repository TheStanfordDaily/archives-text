# Taking Advantage of Campus Opinions
## 
### 
Dr. Meyer's letter in today's Campus Opinion is an excellent opinion
on the Honor Code, which it is hoped the student body will read and
ponder. Our purpose here is not to expatiate upon the article, however,
but to invite faculty opinions to be expressed in letters to the Daily.
Campus Opinion is probably the most widely read column in the paper;
does it not attract members of the faculty wishing to give expression to
their thoughts on sailing ships and sealing wax? Campus Opinion wields
considerable influence, we believe. Pedagogues with points to make are
welcome to take advantage of it.
