Richard Washburn Child, diplomat and ambassador, and Sherwood
Eddy, writer and political scientist, within a day of each other present two
views of Mussolini, dictator and "big boss" of Italy.
Mr. Child in an interview Monday declared, "Mussolini has no imperi
alistic policy,'* and continued to cite the benefits the dictator has brought
to the Italian people. Mr. Eddy in a lecture Tuesday night said of the same
man, "He has proved himself the chief individual menace to peace in
Europe."
From such stuff is history woven. The student who one hundred years
from now is laboring over the history of Italy will be in the same quandary
as to the character of Mussolini as the lad now who reads in one history
that Fremont was a pretty rough customer and in another that he was a
man of high purpose and jjreat achievement.
The years to come will prove the militarism or the pacifism of Musso
lini, but should he die and leave behind conflicting views such as those of
Mr. ( hild and Mr. Eddy a true evaluation will be difficult to be made. So
are created history's Jantises.
