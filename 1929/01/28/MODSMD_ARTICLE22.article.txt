## HONORABLE CONDUCT IS EXPECTED IN ALL THINGS

letter by Professor Meyer of the
anatomy department was ad

Honor System, hut on account of
Its appropriateness as an expres
sion of opinion by a member of

; Members of the Honor System Com- ,
mittee:
I like your suggestion to abandon
| the term Honor System and take '
' pleasure in responding to your request '
for an expression of opinion regard- |
ing it and your report. As most of the :
examinations in the Department of
Anatomy are oral and practical, the
suggestions for improvement of the
Honor System which you make are
unlikely to accomplish much towards
preventing dishonesty in this depart- '
ment. However, I am willing to be- |
lieve that they nevertheless are per
tinent, although if all of the sugges- j
tions were adopted, they merely would j
stop the holes and crannies of temp
tation ,while leaving the windows and
doors wide open.
As long as the so-called Honor Sys
tem remains in force at Stanford, with
the approval of the Academic Council, j
| you are entirely right in expecting
and asking co-operation from all mem- !
| hers of the Faculty, but this should i
not imply that those who doubt its
| wisdom should abdicate their judg- j
ment or maintain silence regarding ;
; its admitted weaknesses.
At the time the Honor System was
adopted at Stanford, fraud in exami- J
nations was asserted to be common,
and the appointment of your Commit
tee, and your report indicate that it
is believed to be common still. During
the six years concerned, approximate- !
ly 200,000 individual examinations
: were taken and you state that only ;
thirty-two students —all of them men j
—were found guilty of fraud. These ,
are eloquent figures, and I cannot
think of anything that can better in
dicate the value of the Honor System
in holding those guilty of dishonesty i
te strict accountability!
You wisely recognize that dishon- (
esty in examinations is very largely ,
a student problem ,and emphasize the
fact that "infractions are the concern :
of all." Although relatively little
fraud can occur without the knowl
edge of students, your minutes and
your report unfortunately imply that
they cannot be expected to make ef
fective use of their knowledge of
wrong-doing. This very apparently is
the main reason why the Honor Sys- j
tem has been ineffective, as you state. '
The suggestion that the guilty shall
be left to punish themselves, disre- !
gards the fact that this demands a
height of moral stature which only
the most virtuous can attain. To rest
the punishment for infractions with
the guilty, that is, with those who
have demonstrated a lack of moral
fibre and ethical standards, would be
to disregard the whole history of or- j
ganized society and he who would
suggest that contemporary life be or
ganized on such a basis would un
doubtedly be laughed to scorn or have i
his sanity questioned.

| But I know that a student body is
i nc t a true section of modern society,
land wholly agree with you that stu-
I dent sentiment can easily reduce dis
| honesty to a minimum. But it can do j
| this only it' the student body is willing
!to assume the very responsibilities*
| which it has been suggested are to
ibe shifted to the offenders them
| selves. As far as I am aware, no so- j
! ciety has been able to formulate a
i self-executing system of conduct and, j
before the advent of Utopian days, 110
society could survive under such an j
idealistic system. And if, as alleged,
| the presence of an instructor, also in
| terested in preventing fraud during j
examinations, is a temptation to it, j
then it follows that the presence of ,
a large number of students similarly !
interested must greatly multiply temp
tation and make fraud practically in
' evitable.
| As the old phrase "in urbe univer- j
; sitatis" attests, university life has j
! from its very beginnings been artifi-
J cial in some respects. Even today,
j student offenders seldom are left to
i face the lull rigors of the law, as
must their fellow-men at large. This !
in itself tends to foster double stand- j
ards of conduct in the very places '
| where moral leadership should pre- j
vail. Yet your report urges that "the ;
! point needs continually to be made
! that the Honor System applies only
!to academic work," and you define
j the Honor System as honorable con
] duct in the new pledge.
j Surely, in our day honorable con
, duct is expected of all sane persojis,
upon all occasions, in all places, and
1 at all times, and to imply that young
I people ready to enter Stanford are
1 not aware of this, is to indict our !
homes, schools, churches, and to mis
: apprehend the standards of contem
porary life. Entrants to Stanford who
; are unaware of these simple stand- i
; ards of modern life probably are men
tally deficient or morally defective,
and what could be more subversive of j
the very purpose it is hoped to
achieve, or more significant, than to
! feel obligated to announce that hon- j
' orable conduct is expected; that the !
t Honor System applies only to aca
i demic work, and that it is suggested
'that punishment for infractions will;
, be left in the hands of offenders.
Any one at all familiar with similar
problems in modern society, heartily
welcomes any wise attempt to raise
j standards of conduct. For the problem
of fraud in examinations is but a part
of the larger problem of dishonesty
in life, and since human frailty is
I ineradicable, except perhaps in a very
! long span of time indeed, it is heart- !
j ening that you found the problem
, "complex and hard to solve."
As long as the Honor System re
mains in effect with us, I shall always
be ready to support any wise measure |
for mitigating its fatal defects, and
1 shall be among the first to applaud
any group that can effectively use it.
I shall also speed the day when aca
i demic life shall be less artificial and
i hope for the time when cant shall be
less vocal and prevalent in our aca
| domic, as well as in our national, life, j
Very truly yours,
Dr. A. W. Meyer.

; Members of the Honor System Com- ,
mittee:
I like your suggestion to abandon
| the term Honor System and take '
' pleasure in responding to your request '
for an expression of opinion regard- |
ing it and your report. As most of the :
examinations in the Department of
Anatomy are oral and practical, the
suggestions for improvement of the
Honor System which you make are
unlikely to accomplish much towards
preventing dishonesty in this depart- '
ment. However, I am willing to be- |
lieve that they nevertheless are per
tinent, although if all of the sugges- j
tions were adopted, they merely would j
stop the holes and crannies of temp
tation ,while leaving the windows and
doors wide open.
As long as the so-called Honor Sys
tem remains in force at Stanford, with
the approval of the Academic Council, j
| you are entirely right in expecting
and asking co-operation from all mem- !
| hers of the Faculty, but this should i
not imply that those who doubt its
| wisdom should abdicate their judg- j
ment or maintain silence regarding ;
; its admitted weaknesses.
At the time the Honor System was
adopted at Stanford, fraud in exami- J
nations was asserted to be common,
and the appointment of your Commit
tee, and your report indicate that it
is believed to be common still. During
the six years concerned, approximate- !
ly 200,000 individual examinations
: were taken and you state that only ;
thirty-two students —all of them men j
—were found guilty of fraud. These ,
are eloquent figures, and I cannot
think of anything that can better in
dicate the value of the Honor System
in holding those guilty of dishonesty i
te strict accountability!
You wisely recognize that dishon- (
esty in examinations is very largely ,
a student problem ,and emphasize the
fact that "infractions are the concern :
of all." Although relatively little
fraud can occur without the knowl
edge of students, your minutes and
your report unfortunately imply that
they cannot be expected to make ef
fective use of their knowledge of
wrong-doing. This very apparently is
the main reason why the Honor Sys- j
tem has been ineffective, as you state. '
The suggestion that the guilty shall
be left to punish themselves, disre- !
gards the fact that this demands a
height of moral stature which only
the most virtuous can attain. To rest
the punishment for infractions with
the guilty, that is, with those who
have demonstrated a lack of moral
fibre and ethical standards, would be
to disregard the whole history of or- j
ganized society and he who would
suggest that contemporary life be or
ganized on such a basis would un
doubtedly be laughed to scorn or have i
his sanity questioned.

| But I know that a student body is
i nc t a true section of modern society,
land wholly agree with you that stu-
I dent sentiment can easily reduce dis
| honesty to a minimum. But it can do j
| this only it' the student body is willing
!to assume the very responsibilities*
| which it has been suggested are to
ibe shifted to the offenders them
| selves. As far as I am aware, no so- j
! ciety has been able to formulate a
i self-executing system of conduct and, j
before the advent of Utopian days, 110
society could survive under such an j
idealistic system. And if, as alleged,
| the presence of an instructor, also in
| terested in preventing fraud during j
examinations, is a temptation to it, j
then it follows that the presence of ,
a large number of students similarly !
interested must greatly multiply temp
tation and make fraud practically in
' evitable.
| As the old phrase "in urbe univer- j
; sitatis" attests, university life has j
! from its very beginnings been artifi-
J cial in some respects. Even today,
j student offenders seldom are left to
i face the lull rigors of the law, as
must their fellow-men at large. This !
in itself tends to foster double stand- j
ards of conduct in the very places '
| where moral leadership should pre- j
vail. Yet your report urges that "the ;
! point needs continually to be made
! that the Honor System applies only
!to academic work," and you define
j the Honor System as honorable con
] duct in the new pledge.
j Surely, in our day honorable con
, duct is expected of all sane persojis,
upon all occasions, in all places, and
1 at all times, and to imply that young
I people ready to enter Stanford are
1 not aware of this, is to indict our !
homes, schools, churches, and to mis
: apprehend the standards of contem
porary life. Entrants to Stanford who
; are unaware of these simple stand- i
; ards of modern life probably are men
tally deficient or morally defective,
and what could be more subversive of j
the very purpose it is hoped to
achieve, or more significant, than to
! feel obligated to announce that hon- j
' orable conduct is expected; that the !
t Honor System applies only to aca
i demic work, and that it is suggested
'that punishment for infractions will;
, be left in the hands of offenders.
Any one at all familiar with similar
problems in modern society, heartily
welcomes any wise attempt to raise
j standards of conduct. For the problem
of fraud in examinations is but a part
of the larger problem of dishonesty
in life, and since human frailty is
I ineradicable, except perhaps in a very
! long span of time indeed, it is heart- !
j ening that you found the problem

; Members of the Honor System Com- ,
mittee:
I like your suggestion to abandon
| the term Honor System and take '
' pleasure in responding to your request '
for an expression of opinion regard- |
ing it and your report. As most of the :
examinations in the Department of
Anatomy are oral and practical, the
suggestions for improvement of the
Honor System which you make are
unlikely to accomplish much towards
preventing dishonesty in this depart- '
ment. However, I am willing to be- |
lieve that they nevertheless are per
tinent, although if all of the sugges- j
tions were adopted, they merely would j
stop the holes and crannies of temp
tation ,while leaving the windows and
doors wide open.
As long as the so-called Honor Sys
tem remains in force at Stanford, with
the approval of the Academic Council, j
| you are entirely right in expecting
and asking co-operation from all mem- !
| hers of the Faculty, but this should i
not imply that those who doubt its
| wisdom should abdicate their judg- j
ment or maintain silence regarding ;
; its admitted weaknesses.
At the time the Honor System was
adopted at Stanford, fraud in exami- J
nations was asserted to be common,
and the appointment of your Commit
tee, and your report indicate that it
is believed to be common still. During
the six years concerned, approximate- !
ly 200,000 individual examinations
: were taken and you state that only ;
thirty-two students —all of them men j
—were found guilty of fraud. These ,
are eloquent figures, and I cannot
think of anything that can better in
dicate the value of the Honor System
in holding those guilty of dishonesty i
te strict accountability!
You wisely recognize that dishon- (
esty in examinations is very largely ,
a student problem ,and emphasize the
fact that "infractions are the concern :
of all." Although relatively little
fraud can occur without the knowl
edge of students, your minutes and
your report unfortunately imply that
they cannot be expected to make ef
fective use of their knowledge of
wrong-doing. This very apparently is
the main reason why the Honor Sys- j
tem has been ineffective, as you state. '
The suggestion that the guilty shall
be left to punish themselves, disre- !
gards the fact that this demands a
height of moral stature which only
the most virtuous can attain. To rest
the punishment for infractions with
the guilty, that is, with those who
have demonstrated a lack of moral
fibre and ethical standards, would be
to disregard the whole history of or- j
ganized society and he who would
suggest that contemporary life be or
ganized on such a basis would un
doubtedly be laughed to scorn or have i
his sanity questioned.

| But I know that a student body is
i nc t a true section of modern society,
land wholly agree with you that stu-
I dent sentiment can easily reduce dis
| honesty to a minimum. But it can do j
| this only it' the student body is willing
!to assume the very responsibilities*
| which it has been suggested are to
ibe shifted to the offenders them
| selves. As far as I am aware, no so- j
! ciety has been able to formulate a
i self-executing system of conduct and, j
before the advent of Utopian days, 110
society could survive under such an j
idealistic system. And if, as alleged,
| the presence of an instructor, also in
| terested in preventing fraud during j
examinations, is a temptation to it, j
then it follows that the presence of ,
a large number of students similarly !
interested must greatly multiply temp
tation and make fraud practically in
' evitable.
| As the old phrase "in urbe univer- j
; sitatis" attests, university life has j
! from its very beginnings been artifi-
J cial in some respects. Even today,
j student offenders seldom are left to
i face the lull rigors of the law, as
must their fellow-men at large. This !
in itself tends to foster double stand- j
ards of conduct in the very places '
| where moral leadership should pre- j
vail. Yet your report urges that "the ;
! point needs continually to be made
! that the Honor System applies only
!to academic work," and you define
j the Honor System as honorable con
] duct in the new pledge.
j Surely, in our day honorable con
, duct is expected of all sane persojis,
upon all occasions, in all places, and
1 at all times, and to imply that young
I people ready to enter Stanford are
1 not aware of this, is to indict our !
homes, schools, churches, and to mis
: apprehend the standards of contem
porary life. Entrants to Stanford who
; are unaware of these simple stand- i
; ards of modern life probably are men
tally deficient or morally defective,
and what could be more subversive of j
the very purpose it is hoped to
achieve, or more significant, than to
! feel obligated to announce that hon- j
' orable conduct is expected; that the !
t Honor System applies only to aca

; Members of the Honor System Com- ,
mittee:
I like your suggestion to abandon
| the term Honor System and take '
' pleasure in responding to your request '
for an expression of opinion regard- |
ing it and your report. As most of the :
examinations in the Department of
Anatomy are oral and practical, the
suggestions for improvement of the
Honor System which you make are
unlikely to accomplish much towards
preventing dishonesty in this depart- '
ment. However, I am willing to be- |
lieve that they nevertheless are per
tinent, although if all of the sugges- j
tions were adopted, they merely would j
stop the holes and crannies of temp
tation ,while leaving the windows and
doors wide open.
As long as the so-called Honor Sys
tem remains in force at Stanford, with
the approval of the Academic Council, j
| you are entirely right in expecting
and asking co-operation from all mem- !
| hers of the Faculty, but this should i
not imply that those who doubt its
| wisdom should abdicate their judg- j
ment or maintain silence regarding ;
; its admitted weaknesses.
At the time the Honor System was
adopted at Stanford, fraud in exami- J
nations was asserted to be common,
and the appointment of your Commit
tee, and your report indicate that it
is believed to be common still. During
the six years concerned, approximate- !
ly 200,000 individual examinations
: were taken and you state that only ;
thirty-two students —all of them men j
—were found guilty of fraud. These ,
are eloquent figures, and I cannot
think of anything that can better in
dicate the value of the Honor System
in holding those guilty of dishonesty i
te strict accountability!
You wisely recognize that dishon- (
esty in examinations is very largely ,
a student problem ,and emphasize the
fact that "infractions are the concern :
of all." Although relatively little
fraud can occur without the knowl
edge of students, your minutes and
your report unfortunately imply that
they cannot be expected to make ef
fective use of their knowledge of
wrong-doing. This very apparently is
the main reason why the Honor Sys- j
tem has been ineffective, as you state. '
The suggestion that the guilty shall
be left to punish themselves, disre- !
gards the fact that this demands a
height of moral stature which only
the most virtuous can attain. To rest
the punishment for infractions with
the guilty, that is, with those who
have demonstrated a lack of moral
fibre and ethical standards, would be
to disregard the whole history of or- j
ganized society and he who would
suggest that contemporary life be or
ganized on such a basis would un
doubtedly be laughed to scorn or have i
his sanity questioned.

| But I know that a student body is
i nc t a true section of modern society,
land wholly agree with you that stu-
I dent sentiment can easily reduce dis
| honesty to a minimum. But it can do j
| this only it' the student body is willing
!to assume the very responsibilities*
| which it has been suggested are to
ibe shifted to the offenders them
| selves. As far as I am aware, no so- j
! ciety has been able to formulate a
i self-executing system of conduct and, j
before the advent of Utopian days, 110
society could survive under such an j
idealistic system. And if, as alleged,
| the presence of an instructor, also in
| terested in preventing fraud during j
examinations, is a temptation to it, j
then it follows that the presence of ,
a large number of students similarly !
interested must greatly multiply temp
tation and make fraud practically in
' evitable.
| As the old phrase "in urbe univer- j
; sitatis" attests, university life has j
! from its very beginnings been artifi-
J cial in some respects. Even today,
j student offenders seldom are left to
i face the lull rigors of the law, as
must their fellow-men at large. This !
in itself tends to foster double stand- j
ards of conduct in the very places '
| where moral leadership should pre- j
vail. Yet your report urges that "the ;
! point needs continually to be made
! that the Honor System applies only
!to academic work," and you define
j the Honor System as honorable con
] duct in the new pledge.
j Surely, in our day honorable con
, duct is expected of all sane persojis,
