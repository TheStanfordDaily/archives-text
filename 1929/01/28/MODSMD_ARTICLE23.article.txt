The Editor, Sir:
Glaring spotlights on the women!
Women's rushing has finished, and
since that time the women have been
placed on the witness stand while the
very institutions of their existence
have been scrutinized and questioned.
Not only Roble, but the sororities
also have become "Bastilles." The
wcmen are "mentally imprisoned."
The five-hundred has been made a
target for the intellectual exercise of
the campus. Women are, evidently,
the root of the University's evil.
With their rushing system, they leave
a trail of broken hearts, and they be
come intellectual prisoners in their
living groups. That is the picture; let
us examine it.
Admittedly the system of living
groups and of rushing has deep and
serious faults. In fact it is believed
rather generally that the faults out
weigh the benefits. The women ARE
mentally imprisoned. Roble women
distrust the motives of Row women,
and Row women are never given
credit for anything but ulterior mo
tives by those on the Row. True, the
system is wrong.
But, are the evils in the system
peculiar to the women? Are the men's
living groups so infinitely superior to
the women's that they are able to
evade the mental imprisonment at
tendant on the system? Is there a
jolly spirit of comraderie and demo
cracy practised between the Row and
the non-fraternity men? Why has the
Stanford man remained in dark ob
scurity while the Stanford women's
hearts are broken in newspaper pub
licity?
The present agitation for a vote
abolishing sororities is a result of
! three tilings. First came Women's
Rushing with its happiness and mis
| ery; then Winston Norman's "Caste
, System" which brought the contro-

I versy to campus and then public at- j
| tention. Thirdly, the evils of the sys
j torn are made much more apparent by
the smallness of the group involved, j
The five-hundred serves as a micro- j
| scope for Stanford's Hall-Row com
' pit*x and shows in close relief what j
j goes on in a larger and blacker scale ,
among the men.
Stanford's chief trouble is its essen- i
i tial lack of unity. The students are :
; broken up into little pieces and
welded together superficially by the
larger unit of Stanford University, i
j They are required to be democratic
j in a system essentially undemocratic. I;
i The greatest evil in the system is
| the Hall-Row feeling. When this bar
: rier is broken down and the real, all
enveloping Stanford spirit expresses h
itself in such all-University events as
the Bonfire and the Ilig Game, all the ,
| students are happier and they wist- j
fully wish it could continue. But no,
the grooves are cut deep and the divi
sions again appear.
%
And now, lo and behold, the women
I are contemplating the abolition of
sororities. Feeling the error in the
present situation (hey are ready to
| test the Row's attitude by seeing if
Pan-Hellenic wishes to vole on the
question. It is such a serious move
and is so intimately connected with
the future of the University that it
i.-j necessary to consider it from every
possible angle.
Will the abolition of sororites, pro
vided it is passed, actually help the
general situation of lack of unity, or
will such a move merely create a i
larger and all-inclusive "Bastille" i
(against which all men's living groups!
can hurl invectives? Will the aboli
tion of sororities merely mean the j!
suicide of numbers of charming rela- ■
tionships or will it actually lead the j
way to a larger unity of men and ;
! women?

For the women want to be an in
tegral part of the University life and
; not a separate distinct unit set apart.
They want to take their places next i
1 J
I to the men, in work and in play, in
unity and in spirit, and they want to
i lit lp make Stanford University the
finest in the nation. And will not the
| abolition of sororities merely make
the campus geography number 30 liv
ing groups instead of 40? Will it be
u constructive act in the life of the
, University as a whole or will it simply
. be a "beau geste" in vain?
The practical consequences of the
abolition of sororities are as follows: [
next year the present living groups
j plus the freshmen recently pledged
will occupy the houses on the Row.
I The following year if expenses are not
| too high the same group can go on
with no additional members and ob
! viously no Greek letters. The third
! year, groups of junior and senior wo
men, arbitrarily chosen, will live in
l the houses for a quarter at a time,
i This condition would last until the
new dormitories around Roble were
; built. These dormitories are well up
on the University building schedule
and would care for groups of sixty
women as the unit for a wing or a 1

division of the building.
When those dormitories are built —
and they will be built regardless of
Pan-Hellenic's decision—the houses
will simply be taken over by the Ad
ministration and the women will be
given their choice at that time on the
sorority question, provided no action
precedes that time, and they will be
lodged accordingly. The dormitories
form an integral part of the new Stan
ford University of graduate schools
and the abolition of sororities is
merely a question of time. The hand
writing is on the wall. Do the women
, want to give them up now, or do they
want to wait until the buildings are
finished?
So in view of all these facts let the
women stop and think before they
plunge ahead into a Row-less future,
if they think that the abolition of
sororities will be of immediate benefit
to the Hall-Row situation as a whole,
let the abolition go on. If they think
that hand-picked groups will be more
congenial, let the sororities await
their doomsday. Let the women show
their freedom from mental imprison
ment in this choice.

Admittedly the system of living
groups and of rushing has deep and

rather generally that the faults out
weigh the benefits. The women ARE
mentally imprisoned. Roble women
distrust the motives of Row women,
and Row women are never given
credit for anything but ulterior mo
tives by those on the Row. True, the
system is wrong.
But, are the evils in the system
peculiar to the women? Are the men's
living groups so infinitely superior to
the women's that they are able to
evade the mental imprisonment at
tendant on the system? Is there a
jolly spirit of comraderie and demo
cracy practised between the Row and
the non-fraternity men? Why has the
Stanford man remained in dark ob
scurity while the Stanford women's
hearts are broken in newspaper pub
licity?
The present agitation for a vote
abolishing sororities is a result of
! three tilings. First came Women's
Rushing with its happiness and mis

and is so intimately connected with
the future of the University that it
i.-j necessary to consider it from every

Will the abolition of sororites, pro

general situation of lack of unity, or
will such a move merely create a i
larger and all-inclusive "Bastille" i
(against which all men's living groups!

tion of sororities merely mean the j!
suicide of numbers of charming rela- ■
tionships or will it actually lead the j
way to a larger unity of men and ;
! women?

For the women want to be an in

They want to take their places next i
1 J
I to the men, in work and in play, in
unity and in spirit, and they want to
i lit lp make Stanford University the

| abolition of sororities merely make
the campus geography number 30 liv
ing groups instead of 40? Will it be
u constructive act in the life of the
, University as a whole or will it simply
. be a "beau geste" in vain?
The practical consequences of the
abolition of sororities are as follows: [
next year the present living groups
j plus the freshmen recently pledged
will occupy the houses on the Row.
I The following year if expenses are not

with no additional members and ob
! viously no Greek letters. The third
! year, groups of junior and senior wo
men, arbitrarily chosen, will live in
l the houses for a quarter at a time,
i This condition would last until the
new dormitories around Roble were
; built. These dormitories are well up
on the University building schedule
and would care for groups of sixty
women as the unit for a wing or a 1

division of the building.
When those dormitories are built —
and they will be built regardless of
Pan-Hellenic's decision—the houses
will simply be taken over by the Ad
ministration and the women will be
given their choice at that time on the
sorority question, provided no action
precedes that time, and they will be
lodged accordingly. The dormitories
form an integral part of the new Stan
ford University of graduate schools
and the abolition of sororities is
merely a question of time. The hand
writing is on the wall. Do the women
, want to give them up now, or do they
want to wait until the buildings are
finished?
So in view of all these facts let the
women stop and think before they
plunge ahead into a Row-less future,
if they think that the abolition of
sororities will be of immediate benefit
to the Hall-Row situation as a whole,
let the abolition go on. If they think
that hand-picked groups will be more
congenial, let the sororities await
their doomsday. Let the women show
their freedom from mental imprison

Will the abolition of sororites, pro

way to a larger unity of men and ;

For the women want to be an in

They want to take their places next i

I to the men, in work and in play, in
unity and in spirit, and they want to

The practical consequences of the
abolition of sororities are as follows: [
next year the present living groups

will occupy the houses on the Row.
I The following year if expenses are not

with no additional members and ob
! viously no Greek letters. The third
! year, groups of junior and senior wo
men, arbitrarily chosen, will live in
l the houses for a quarter at a time,
i This condition would last until the
new dormitories around Roble were
; built. These dormitories are well up
on the University building schedule
and would care for groups of sixty
women as the unit for a wing or a 1

division of the building.
When those dormitories are built —
and they will be built regardless of
Pan-Hellenic's decision—the houses
will simply be taken over by the Ad
ministration and the women will be
given their choice at that time on the
sorority question, provided no action
precedes that time, and they will be
lodged accordingly. The dormitories
form an integral part of the new Stan
ford University of graduate schools
and the abolition of sororities is
merely a question of time. The hand
writing is on the wall. Do the women
, want to give them up now, or do they
want to wait until the buildings are
finished?
So in view of all these facts let the
women stop and think before they
plunge ahead into a Row-less future,
if they think that the abolition of
sororities will be of immediate benefit
to the Hall-Row situation as a whole,
let the abolition go on. If they think
that hand-picked groups will be more

question. It is such a serious move

the future of the University that it
i.-j necessary to consider it from every
possible angle.
Will the abolition of sororites, pro
vided it is passed, actually help the
general situation of lack of unity, or
will such a move merely create a i
larger and all-inclusive "Bastille" i
(against which all men's living groups!
can hurl invectives? Will the aboli
tion of sororities merely mean the j!
suicide of numbers of charming rela- ■
tionships or will it actually lead the j
way to a larger unity of men and ;
! women?

For the women want to be an in
tegral part of the University life and
; not a separate distinct unit set apart.
They want to take their places next i
1 J
I to the men, in work and in play, in
unity and in spirit, and they want to
i lit lp make Stanford University the
finest in the nation. And will not the
| abolition of sororities merely make
the campus geography number 30 liv
ing groups instead of 40? Will it be
u constructive act in the life of the
, University as a whole or will it simply
. be a "beau geste" in vain?
The practical consequences of the
abolition of sororities are as follows: [
next year the present living groups
j plus the freshmen recently pledged
will occupy the houses on the Row.
I The following year if expenses are not
| too high the same group can go on
with no additional members and ob
! viously no Greek letters. The third
! year, groups of junior and senior wo
men, arbitrarily chosen, will live in
l the houses for a quarter at a time,
i This condition would last until the
new dormitories around Roble were
; built. These dormitories are well up
on the University building schedule
and would care for groups of sixty
women as the unit for a wing or a 1

division of the building.
When those dormitories are built —
and they will be built regardless of
Pan-Hellenic's decision—the houses
will simply be taken over by the Ad
ministration and the women will be
given their choice at that time on the
sorority question, provided no action
precedes that time, and they will be
lodged accordingly. The dormitories
form an integral part of the new Stan
ford University of graduate schools
and the abolition of sororities is
merely a question of time. The hand
writing is on the wall. Do the women
, want to give them up now, or do they
want to wait until the buildings are
finished?
So in view of all these facts let the
women stop and think before they
plunge ahead into a Row-less future,
if they think that the abolition of
sororities will be of immediate benefit
to the Hall-Row situation as a whole,
let the abolition go on. If they think
that hand-picked groups will be more
congenial, let the sororities await
their doomsday. Let the women show
their freedom from mental imprison
ment in this choice.

The Editor, Sir:
Glaring spotlights on the women!
Women's rushing has finished, and
since that time the women have been
placed on the witness stand while the
very institutions of their existence
have been scrutinized and questioned.
Not only Roble, but the sororities
also have become "Bastilles." The
wcmen are "mentally imprisoned."
The five-hundred has been made a
target for the intellectual exercise of
the campus. Women are, evidently,
the root of the University's evil.
With their rushing system, they leave
a trail of broken hearts, and they be
come intellectual prisoners in their
living groups. That is the picture; let
us examine it.
Admittedly the system of living
groups and of rushing has deep and
serious faults. In fact it is believed
rather generally that the faults out
weigh the benefits. The women ARE
mentally imprisoned. Roble women
distrust the motives of Row women,
and Row women are never given
credit for anything but ulterior mo
tives by those on the Row. True, the
system is wrong.
But, are the evils in the system
peculiar to the women? Are the men's
living groups so infinitely superior to
the women's that they are able to
evade the mental imprisonment at
tendant on the system? Is there a
jolly spirit of comraderie and demo
cracy practised between the Row and
the non-fraternity men? Why has the
Stanford man remained in dark ob
scurity while the Stanford women's
hearts are broken in newspaper pub
licity?
The present agitation for a vote
abolishing sororities is a result of
! three tilings. First came Women's
Rushing with its happiness and mis
| ery; then Winston Norman's "Caste
, System" which brought the contro-

I versy to campus and then public at- j
| tention. Thirdly, the evils of the sys
j torn are made much more apparent by
the smallness of the group involved, j
The five-hundred serves as a micro- j

' pit*x and shows in close relief what j
j goes on in a larger and blacker scale ,
among the men.
