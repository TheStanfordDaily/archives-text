# RECEPTION OF AUSTRALIANS INDIFFERENT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir: j
I hope the indifferent attitude and
reception accorded the visiting Austra
lians by the University will be over
! looked by the boys from the continent
below the equator.
For once I felt embarrassed for our
University; we have grown so smug
! ana self-contained that we seem to j
have overlooked the little courtesies I
that should have been extended to j
such a representative group.
I have been in Australia and know
that any similar group of American
students visiting Australia would
i have been accorded a hearty, warm \
welcome.
This is not written to excuse our
! conduct to our visitors —undoubtedly
they drew erroneous conclusions —but
to arouse us from our typically West

, ern attitude. We are drastically in
need of a little polish —we have the
real material —the he-man role is all
right in the movies, but I greatly de
i plore the lack of courtesy, chivalry,
j and unobtrusive understanding that
after all is the prime requisite for a
gentleman—and you know college
men are supposed to be gentlemen.
If anyone resents these words please
I picture the contrast when the football
| team arrived home, to the indifferent
attitude shown to the Australian Band
as it marched with waving banners to
our door —the Memorial Court —from
a window in the Chemistry Depart
ment I did count six or eight persons
looking on.
One reception was born of enthusi
' asm, the other should have been stim
ulated by that most graceful of all
I gestures—courtesy. —J. R. U.
