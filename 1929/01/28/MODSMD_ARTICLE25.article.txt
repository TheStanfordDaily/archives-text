# BUT MY DEAR!
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Honestly, isn't it awful when you
can't sleep because of the noise? Why
it was actually three o'clock before
the male quartet next door toddled
oil to their pile of straw —or should
I have said piles? I mean, it isn't so
bad to be kept from one's studies —
in fact quite pleasant oftimes —but
SLEEP! Why my dear I simply LOVE
sleeping between twelve and three!
And tell me the truth, wouldn't you
be disgusted if you stood around for
three solid hours holding the cat?
Why 1 can see the anguished look in
poor little Ephram's eyes even now!
My dear, it was positively cattish!
And can you believe it, I finally lost
my patience and, holding poor little
Ephram by his dear little scruff, I
forced my writhing features into the
hall (I could have said wall! Tsb!
Tsh!) and gently called out:
"Sirs! For goodness sake, won't you
please be quiet?"
Lighting a cubeb I waited nervous
ly for the sudden hush, but, truth
fully, could you countenance? more
came! You won't believe it when I tell
you, but honestly—some of the re
marks! I almost swooned! Why actu

ally, then as never before, I wished I
had taken one of those impossible
I courses in self-defense —such as fenc
! ing or law. Why, as I softly closed
! the door, anyone could have told I
was annoyed by the expression on
my face. Even little Ephram, dangling
like a sponge, suffered with me. I
mean he had no choice. He's such a
sympathetic animal —simply killing!
Well, before I work myself into an
1 enthusiasm I'll tell you now. They
finally did trickle home but —as if
| things weren't complexed enough! —
someone threw taunts at my tran?
bome! Can you picture anything more
excruciatingly absurd? And wouldn't
it SLAY you? Can you imagine his
terror and those bashful glances if
he had heard my retort as follows?
"Ohmygoodnessshutup!"
But what I mean is; there ought to
; be a rule or code (that's a nice word
1 ain't it, and SO popular!) limiting
j vocal entertainment at such hours (at
j SUCH hours) to solos or duets. I
mean there really oughtn't to be any
chorus work. Don't you think so?
■Come! Say yes. Oh sugar!!! (I must
! coax!)
