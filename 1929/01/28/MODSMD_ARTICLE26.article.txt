## STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS NOTES 
### 
The Stanford Press has started a
program for expansion into the gen
eral non-fiction book publishing field.
While the Press will continue as its
chief function the publications of
books of an academic nature, it has
extended its program to include "any
book that will promote human wel
fare."
Along with its expansion into a
broader field, the Press is launching
an aggressive selling campaign for
its publications of general interest.
This includes advertising in a number
of National magazines, development
of a direct-mail department, and ap
pointment of traveling representa
tives throughout the country.
The business of the Press has
tripled in the past year and the num
ber of books bearing the imprint of
the institution now give it the largest
general list west of the Rockies.
The two volumes of Dr. Lewis M.
T( rman's notable study of child
genius, published by the Press under
the title of Genetic Studies of Genius,
will form part of an exhibit of 900
books in the American building in the
Ibero-American Exposition to be held
in Seville next spring and summer.
The collection will consist of books
"illustrative of American life and cul
ture." After the exposition closes it
is proposed that the books be used as
the nucleus for a permanent Ameri
can library in Seville.
Three now numbers of the Univer
sity Series have been published re
cently by the Press. Two are in biolo
gical sciences, and one in language
and literature.
Dramatische Situationsbilder und—

bildtypen, by August C. Mahr, assist
ant professor of Germanic languages,
is a treatise on the construction of
drama from a stylistic point of view,
demonstrating the use of certain basic
situations in the drama of various
times and peoples, from the Attic tra
gedians to the drama of "young Ger
many." The study is in German.
Dr. Gordon L. Ferris, associate pro
fessor of zoology, has contributed a
study of The Principles of Systematic
Entomology." This is the first compre
hensive treatment of the subject, a
critical survey of existing conditions
in systematic entomology.
The first number of Volume 6 of
the Biological Sciences is A Contribu
tion Toward a Monograph of the
Acelginae (Phylloxeridae) of North
America, by P. N. Annand, Ph.D., of
the Department of Biological Sciences,
San Mateo Junior College. The adel
ginae are small insects which attack
spruce, fir, and pine, and have done

considerable damage in the forests
and parks of the West, and other
parts of the United States having
j coniferous forests. The present study
| is of special value as it leads to a
'more complete knowledge of the in
sect and may result in establishing
j methods of control.
