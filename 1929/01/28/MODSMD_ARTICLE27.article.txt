# CARD BALL NINE DEFEATS WINTER LEAGUE CHAMPS
## 
### 
Playing the best brand of ball wit
nessed here for some time, Stanford's
varsity baseball nine defeated Granat
Brothers by a score of three to one.
A one-base blow by Sampson, a dou
ble by Cook, and a single by Johnson
in the tirst inning gave the Cards two
runs, and that margin would have
been sufficient to win the contest. Al
though the Cards gathered only five
safeties, they hit when the blows
were needed, and tlie pitchers allowed
the Winter Leaguers but six scattered
hits.
A number of times during the con
test, the Granat organization threat
ened to score, but tight fielding and
good pitching prevented a marker un
til the fourth inning when Oana tal
lied on a wild pitch by Kern. Three
times during the game Granats had
three men on bases and failed to
score.
In the fifth inning, Stanford made
their final run. Laird got a single to
right and stole second. Churchill ad
vanced him to third on a ball hit to
the infield and he scored on a wild
pitch by Bahr. The next two men
fanned to finish the inning.
Captain Frank Wilton made a beau
tiful catch of Matzen's hard-hit fly in
the eighth inning to prevent a score
for the San Francisco team. Wilton
also made a nice hit into centerfield.
The whole Card outfit looked good in
the field and but one error was made
throughout the contest.
Smalling, Kern, Taylor, and Lewis
all looked good on the mound in Sat
urday's game. Next Wednesday they
will get a chance to prove their worth
when the varsity meets the Lee
Haberdashery team of Berkeley. This
organization boasts such players as
Red Kress of St. Louis and last year I
leader of the American League in bat
ting. Fenton and Lombardi of Oak- ,
land, ("hie Hafey of St. Louis, Cy Cun- I
ningham of Boston, and others of !
equal note.
