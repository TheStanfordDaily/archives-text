# FOUR TEAMS COP LEAD OF MURAL BASKET TOURNEY
## 
### 
i
I Four teams stood out in last week's
mural basketball play and are just
i about "cinches" to cop the champion
ship of their leagues. The series was
also featured by a couple of upsets
and a new high scoring record.
Kappa Alpha, last year's winner,
! came through with its third straight
I victory and looks to be a threat again
this season. El Toro won a lop-sided
| victory from Delta Tau Delta to gain
'Die undisputed lead of League 5.
; Breakers swamped a weak Encina
quintet and thereby entrenched itself
at the top of League 6.
A new scoring record was made by
| Encina 4W, when it trounced the Japa
nese Club by a score of 57 to 5. The |
hall boys have won all of their games
I by a wide margin and are certain to
reach the final playoffs.
Another goodly sized score was run
( up by the Betas in a game with the j
j Chinese Club. The fraternity players
looped in 47 points, and at the same |
I time held their opponents to 3 tallies, j
Independent 2 played great defensive i
| ball to hold Los Arcos to a single!
I goal, and in doing so established a 1
low scoring record.
Encina 2E pulled the biggest sur
prise of the whole series, when it up
set the Sigma Chi's in a hard-fought
contest. Heretofore the losers had
been labeled as "the team to beat" j
for the mutual title. A fumbling A.T.O. |
squad nosed out a ragged Encina 5 j
outfit in a rough-and-tumble fracas to
provide the second big upset of the j
week.
A new individual scoring record !
was made during the Encina-Japanese ;
game. Fisher, lanky center on the hall
team, sank fourteen baskets for a
total of 28 points. Mott, of the same
squad, tossed in twelve field goals j
and a free throw to tally 25 markers. !
Several other "sharpshooters" found ;
the basket consistently and piled up
ample points. Kim Dyer, rangy track
star, displayed considerable shooting j
ability by sinking in 20 points for the
Sigma Nu's. Garibotto, forward for El
Tigre, beat the Theta Delts single- i
handed, when he looped in nine field
goals and one foul shot.
Three guards stood out because of
their fine defensive work. Mann ;
played a good floor game for the !
Kappa Sigs and was a "stonewall" at
guard. Goldsmith, of the Breakers,
and Link Clark, of the Phi Kaps, both j 1
starred at running guard.
The fourth round of games opens '
with tonight's contests, featuring j i
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sig's, Fiji's, and i
Sigma Nu. i
