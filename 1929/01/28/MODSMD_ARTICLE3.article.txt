# Kaiser's Birthday Recalls Glamour Of German Court
## Dutch Government Anxious Lest Allies Object to Demonstrations 
### 
DOORN, Holland, Jan. 27. (JP)—' The j
| round of celebrations in honor of for- j
| mer Emperor Wilhelm's 70th birthday !
which has been going on for the past j
week was climaxed this morning in j
an official ceremony of congratulation ,
followed by divine services and a I
birthday meal.
Memories of glorious bygone days 1
I were once again conjured up for the
i aged and dethroned ruler when all I
the male participants, garbed in gala j
uniforms of their military rank with
spiked helmets, decorations, and high
boots, saluted the head of the Hohen
zollern family who was resplendent
lin a field marshal's uniform of the
! First Royal Guards and wearing upon :
his breast the highest decorations j
within the gift of the German and'
many other nations. The women, while
wearing modern dresses, nevertheless j
j gave a flavor of the old court days
! by having gowns with trains and exe- i
j euting low court curtsies.
Most of the Hohenzollern clan re- |
fuses to recognize Princess Hermine j
as "Her Imperial Majesty," conceding ;
her merely the title of the Kaiser's j
spouse. It is rumored that she is out j
of sympathy with the policy of secrecy j
! and the ban on photographers on j
J such occasions as this. All this is em- j
| phatically denied however, at Doom J
! Castle, where it is stated that Her- j
j mine is ill with what at first seemed j
I chicken-pox but probably only grippe. !
Among the thousands of telegrams i
: there were those from the Danish
| K'ng, the Queen of Sweden, and most
i of the former German Princes of the ,
Federated States. President von Hin
! dcnburg in his capacity as a private 1
• citizen and former field marshal un
j der the Kaiser, sent a hand-written
1 letter.
I
The Dutch Government has been
quite anxious these past few days j
] lest the Kaiser's birthday led to po-1
litical demonstrations to which the
| Allies might object. It is reported that:
the Government brought pressure to
j bear on Doom Castle to keep the j
party strictly within the limits of a
family affair.
