# SPORTS OF 1929
## "300" Scorers 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Which would you rather do, make |
a liole-in-one or bowl a perfect game? |
There is more luck connected with j.
the former than the latter, and there !
are more aces made on the links than
there are 300 games bowled. A golfer !
has been known to make two holes-in- I
one in succession, and likewise Frank j
Caruana, of Buffalo, N.Y., lias bowled
two consecutive perfect games.
Caruana turned the trick on March
5, 1924, at the Floss-Main-Burton al
leys in Buffalo as a member of the
Pollack Poster Prints team. His
three-game total was 847, which the j
American Bowling Congress accepted
us a world's record, and his score for
four games was 1115! Caruana's feat
was perfectly legal in every way, as i
the alleys were quite new, and sane- !
tioned and measured by the Buffalo i
Bowling Association. Previously he |
bad bowled a 300 in a match against j
Count Gengler at the Old Floss Palace j
Alleys in Buffalo.
According to T. S. Andrew's Sport- !
ng Record Book, William D. Roach,
jf Wilmington, Del., bowled 300, 300,
and 269 in 1906, but evidently not in

| a sanctioned league series. Mickey
| Frey, of Oshkosh, Wis., turned in two
I-300 scores in a five-game series in
11916. Mrs. Goldie Greenwald, Cleve
land, 0., is the only woman to roll a
perfect score in a match game. (1920)
A Mrs. Hables has bowled 299 twice!
Jimmy Smith, of New York and
, elsewhere, has bowled sixteen 300
1 scores, while John Roster, winner of
the Greater New York individual
1 championship in 1911, '12, and '13, has
fifteen to his credit. Barney Spenelli
has rolled nine, and Jimmy Blouin
| about the same number. Both Smith
. and Blouin are hailed as "the world's
champion bowler" now and then, and
"ach Jimmy holds numerous records,
i Smith was twice A.B.C. international
! champion, Blouin once, and Blouin
| was once National Bowling winner for
| a three-game series.
| Eva Le Gallienne recently stopped
jat Columbia University to give her
interpretation of Barrie's "Peter Pan"
before large audiences of theatre
lovers. She was traveling in a troupe
of Carolina players.

has been known to make two holes-in- I
one in succession, and likewise Frank j
Caruana, of Buffalo, N.Y., lias bowled
two consecutive perfect games.
Caruana turned the trick on March
5, 1924, at the Floss-Main-Burton al
leys in Buffalo as a member of the
Pollack Poster Prints team. His
three-game total was 847, which the j
American Bowling Congress accepted
us a world's record, and his score for
four games was 1115! Caruana's feat
was perfectly legal in every way, as i
the alleys were quite new, and sane- !
tioned and measured by the Buffalo i
Bowling Association. Previously he |
bad bowled a 300 in a match against j
Count Gengler at the Old Floss Palace j
Alleys in Buffalo.
According to T. S. Andrew's Sport- !
ng Record Book, William D. Roach,
jf Wilmington, Del., bowled 300, 300,
and 269 in 1906, but evidently not in

| a sanctioned league series. Mickey
| Frey, of Oshkosh, Wis., turned in two
I-300 scores in a five-game series in
11916. Mrs. Goldie Greenwald, Cleve
land, 0., is the only woman to roll a
perfect score in a match game. (1920)
A Mrs. Hables has bowled 299 twice!
Jimmy Smith, of New York and
, elsewhere, has bowled sixteen 300
1 scores, while John Roster, winner of
the Greater New York individual
1 championship in 1911, '12, and '13, has
fifteen to his credit. Barney Spenelli
has rolled nine, and Jimmy Blouin
| about the same number. Both Smith
. and Blouin are hailed as "the world's
champion bowler" now and then, and
"ach Jimmy holds numerous records,
i Smith was twice A.B.C. international
! champion, Blouin once, and Blouin
| was once National Bowling winner for
| a three-game series.
| Eva Le Gallienne recently stopped
jat Columbia University to give her
interpretation of Barrie's "Peter Pan"
before large audiences of theatre
lovers. She was traveling in a troupe
of Carolina players.

Which would you rather do, make |
a liole-in-one or bowl a perfect game? |
There is more luck connected with j.
the former than the latter, and there !
are more aces made on the links than
there are 300 games bowled. A golfer !
has been known to make two holes-in- I
