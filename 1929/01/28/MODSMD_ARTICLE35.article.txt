# OLD QUADS TELL SPORTS, CUSTOMS OF EARLY YEARS

### 
Old Quads of bygone years tell
I much of the early history, sports,
i customs, and traditions of the Uni
! versity, although those first year
i books had no art work, senior pic
tures, or sport and administration re
| views to vivify the life in the "good
I old days."
I The first Quad in '94 published a
I full roster and group pictures of the
football teams of '92, '93, and '94.
Among the names is that of Clemans,
the hero of the first Big Game in
March 1892 when the first Stanford
! team of history, green and uncoached,
defeated a highly touted Blue and
I Geld eleven 14-10. Baseball, tennis,
and track were the other sports.
! Track meet events were the same as
' those of the present day except that
a two-mile bicycle race and a "throw
ing league ball" event were included.
Women's sports of '29 are identical
; with those of '94 save that hockey
has been substituted for bicycling.
Interclass sports were very popular
and some class teams played out
siders from Stockton and San Jose. I
] An account of the Irish Marathon
is found in the 1910 Quad, and from 1
! the write-up, the men made the Mar

jis today. All four undergraduate

, and appeared in regular track attire,
' but the "Holdover Brigade" of '08
j came out in Greek togas, bathrobes,

I group managed to secure an early !
lead by using bicycles and later by

before. Nightshirts abounded and

The bonfire was merely a piled-up
