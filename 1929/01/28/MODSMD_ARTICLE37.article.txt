# LEATRICE JOY TO START VAUDEVILLE WORK BUT WILL NOT LEAVE MOVIES
## 
### 
By BEN MADDOX
Lea trice Joy, who appeared in per
son at the San Francisco Orpheum
last week, passes my personal inter
view test with exceptional honors.
She is a witty and intelligent conver
sationalist.
For the past eight years Leatrice
has been Cecil De Mille's brightest
fillum star. She has been the glamor
ous lady of his most ultra-ultra gilded
fancies, the heroine of his most suc
cessful production — "The Ten Com
] mandments."
Several months ago, while between
pictures, she took a flyer in stage
work as leading lady for Edward Ev
erett Horton at his Hollywood the
atre. That interested her so much
that she decided to do some more
when she finished her long-term con
| tract.
Before she could look over prospec
tive plays, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer got
her to play the lead in their first
talkie —"The Bellamy Trial." Then
; the Orpheum offered her a ten weeks'
contract.
Like a wise little actress, Leatrice
refused to sign such a long contract
J until she had "tried out" her act. So
this week in the city is really a trial
j debut. She sings and gives dramatic
j characterizations —the best personal
j appearance act I've ever seen —and
there is little doubt of her making the
tcur now.
What she would really like to do
this spring is to go to Europe for
personal appearances. She can speak
French, and her songs are being
translated.
Vaudeville, the legitimate, the talk
j ies, and the "silents" are all very
i different, she claims. In her present
act a spotlight is centered on her
most of the time, and she says she
can't see whether there's anyone out
there across the footlights.
"One gets the same silly sensation
speaking over the radio. You don't

I know whether you're being heard, or
' whether you're just being kidded.
1 You talk into an instrument and won
der if anyone is listening in.
"No, I am not going to leave the
movies. They are my life now."
It you've ever been curious as to
why movie stars are so often cast in
poor pictures, Leatrice can explain.
"I had the right to complain when
, ever I was given a poor story. But it
: didn't do me any good because I
couldn't find anyone to listen to me!
j Mr. De Mille was always busy, and
! there was no one else to hear my
tale of woe!"
For the past year Leatrice lias un
doubtedly had inferior roles. Now
that she is free to pick and choose
she should get along better. Al
! though she is amusing in light and
; sophisticated comedies, I suspect she
j prefers serious characters. She is
really an emotional person, and ca
pable of playing real drama.
This vaudeville business is so new
; that she hasn't accustomed herself
to it. She starts worrying at dinner
time about getting to the theatre on
I time, yet the novelty of acting at
j regular hours is fun for a change,
i She has abandoned the extreme
■ boyish bob she helped to popularize
i for a natural-length, wavy one. And
she is as vivacious and peppy as the
movies make her out to be. Heart
fiee since her divorce from John Gil
bert several years ago, she devotes
much of her time now to her four
year-old daughter, Leatrice Joy Gil
bert.
This is one star who should be as
big a success on the screen orally as
1 she has been visually. Leatrice Joy
jis an actress with personal charm
plus actual dramatic ability.
Insects have been on the earth fifty
i million years, while the human race is
' only 500,000 years old.

work as leading lady for Edward Ev

For the past year Leatrice lias un
doubtedly had inferior roles. Now
that she is free to pick and choose
she should get along better. Al
! though she is amusing in light and
; sophisticated comedies, I suspect she
j prefers serious characters. She is
really an emotional person, and ca
pable of playing real drama.
This vaudeville business is so new
; that she hasn't accustomed herself
to it. She starts worrying at dinner
time about getting to the theatre on
I time, yet the novelty of acting at
j regular hours is fun for a change,
i She has abandoned the extreme
■ boyish bob she helped to popularize
i for a natural-length, wavy one. And
she is as vivacious and peppy as the
movies make her out to be. Heart
fiee since her divorce from John Gil
bert several years ago, she devotes
much of her time now to her four
year-old daughter, Leatrice Joy Gil
bert.
This is one star who should be as
big a success on the screen orally as
1 she has been visually. Leatrice Joy
jis an actress with personal charm
plus actual dramatic ability.
Insects have been on the earth fifty
i million years, while the human race is
' only 500,000 years old.
