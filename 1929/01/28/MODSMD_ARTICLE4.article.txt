# WYLIE PORTRAITS FOR SET PAINTED BY HELVENSTON
## 
### 
Three portraits of the Wylie broth
ers have been painted by Harold Hel
venston to be hung in the living-room
of the Wylie home which is the first
set in Barrie's play, "What Every
Woman Knows." The Masquers drama
will be presented to the campus Feb
ruary 8. The seat sale for the play
will take place Thursday of this week.
Helvenston has painted these por
traits from life, and they are supposed
to be the type of family pictures
which hang in every Scottish home.
Herb Wenig, Lionel Walford, and Ar
thur Hurt posed for Helvenston and,
according to the painter, the pictures
resemble the Wylie brothers as close
ly as family portraits ever resemble
the living persons.
Four sets done in the realistic style
are being constructed for the play.
There are a number of technical dif
ficulties to be overcome in the produc
tion on the Assembly Hall stage. A
certain amount of rapidity is neces
sary in the changing of the four sets,
and due to the limited space, the
changes will be hard to handle.
Modern stage handling will be em
ployed in the shifting of the scenes.
By the use of lights and properties
the changes are being made as simple
I as possible in the wide range of set
tings from a London drawing room
study to a barber shop in Scotland.
The costumes of the play promise
! to be unusually interesting. They will
t represent the period of 190S, and an
attempt is being made at present to
I secure real dresses of the period from
various people over the peninsula.
Helen Ward as the young lady of
fashion, Sybil, and her aunt, the
Countess de la Briere, played by
Louise Buston, will be seen in the
j.lay in the very smartest and most
i attractive frocks of the earlier day.
Katherine Keho as Maggie will wear
some of the plainer as well as the
more elaborate styles of that day.
