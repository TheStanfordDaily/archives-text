! tage. Word comes from Toyon's
(dance manager that the Toyon For

- ing with the hunting lodge decora
-1 tions but also will be encouraged.
Bob Bolshevik Paine, winner of the
Whiskerino two years ago, and judge
of this year's contest, makes the state
ment that an entrant should not be
discouraged if his bush does not look
as black as another's. "I won the con
gest only after patient waiting, fre
jquent combing, and application of
grease," said Paine, "and although I
| was almost out of the running until
1 a few days from the end, I succeeded
in taking first prize by blackening the
curly locks with ink."
Hammer and Coffin is considering
giving the results of the contest to
the city papers and newsreels.
