THE WELL DRESSED
YOUNG MAN
on the highways of New \ ork, San l'rancisco, oi right
at home, is rather sedately arrayed in dark clothes, neat
black shoes (sometimes gray spats) with a bowler hat
to top the picture. With the exception of his cravats
and shirts his appearance is rather demure. So says a
celebrated style critic—and going farther lie says that
this conservative attitude has brought into vogue the
more simple styles in shoes. "Shoes after the Knglish
Manner'' are and are going to he what these young men
demand. Although many are shown with wing tips and
muchly perforated yet progressive outfitters agree that
a modified shape and rather plain tip will be most aris
tocratic.
We are showing now a generous assortment of shoes of
this character in both Imported and Domestic makes,
priced from $8.50 to $16. Come in and look them over.
