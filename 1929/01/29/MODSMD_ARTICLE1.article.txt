# WILBUR FAVORS $5,000,000 FOR COAST AIR BASE
## Secretary of Navy Proposes Congress' Appropriations; Thousand Acres for Field Western Airport Is Logical Supplement to Lakehurst In Caring for Dirigibles 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 28. (/?)—The
navy department took the first step
today toward establishment of a base
for lighter-than-air craft on the Pacific
Coast with a proposal to Congress by
Secretary of the Navy Curtis I). Wil
bur that $5,000,000 be appropriated
for such an air field.
The location of the air field would
be decided by a board of navy of
ficers, Secretary Wilbur said, dis
cussing the proposal, and a tract of
about 1,000 acres would be required
for it.
The action follows the letting of
contracts by the government last fall
for construction of two new airships
lor the navy and recalls the state
ment made by Assistant Secretary
Edward P. Warner in which he said
a second air base is necessary to
supplement the Lakehurst field in
caring for the lighter-than-air craft.
The opinion was expressed then that
the Pacific Coast was the logical
place for the new base. The depart
ment already has received several of
fers of sites in that section, some of
which amounted to almost a gift of
land to the government.
Meteorological conditions will have
an important bearing on the ultimate
selection of the site, this type of air
craft being especially dependent upon
stable air currents and the absence
of thunderstorms.
