Twelve bouts in the preliminary

j tournament were fought yesterday af
-1 ternoon in the boxing room of Encina
j gym. Four middleweigts, four light

featherweight survived their first, com
! petition and will box in the semi
finals and finals Wednesday evening
; in the Pavilion. No preliminary bouts
' were necessary in the bantamweight,
light-heavyweight, or heavyweight
' classes.
I Bouts consisted of three rounds of
one and a half minutes each. Harry
Maloney, boxing coach, refereed; the
judges were Jake Irwin, former Stan
ford boxing captain and middleweight
champion, and Myron Sprague, var
sity swimming coach.
Fourth Round Needed
The best bout of the afternoon was

that in which Milt Cohen defeated
Fred Johnson. Both men proved to
be hard sluggers, and the referee or
dered a fourth round when the judges !
could not agree at the end of the
third. Cohen and Johnson are middle
weights.
The second bout of the afternoon
was one of the most interesting and
hardest fought of the preliminaries; j
Mark Overton and Fred Gist, light- !
weights, started out fast and staged !
a real slugfest before Overton was
awarded the bout by the referee on a j
technical knockout in the third round. |
Gist held his own in the first two j
rounds, but Overton, who had an ad
vantage in his long reach, came in too !
strong for the loser at the start of !
the last round.
Two featherweights, Carl Eardley
and Carrol Sanborn, staged a scrappy
fight in which Sanborn's defense and i
his left punches proved too much for
Eardley.
John Dawson won a fourth-round
refree's decision from John Williams
in the welterweight division. The de
cision was a close one, and Williams
lost partly because he continued to
hit with his open glove, which is
against the rules, after being warned
not to by the referee at the end of
the third round.
