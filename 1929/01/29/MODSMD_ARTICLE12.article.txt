# Roble In Revolt; Or Nicotine Advances Another Notch
## 
### 
Two motions, one that smoking be
allowed to both men and women dur
ing dances, and that it be permitted
in the music room, were passed last
night at Roble. A third motion, that
smoking be allowed in the lobby at
any time, was tabled until next week.
It was felt that the women should
extend the smoking privilege to the
men during dances, and that there
should also be one general room
downstairs where both men and
women could indulge in cigarettes.
Voting on the motion in regard to
smoking at all times in the lobby
was held over until next week for
consideration on the part of the wom
en. Sentiment expressed against it
was that older people entering the
hall might object, and that the fur
niture might be injured because of
carelessly placed cigarettes.
