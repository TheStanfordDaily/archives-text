Sigma Nu played hard, fast ball to
win over Independent 2 in the intra
mural basketball tourney last night,
i The losers put up a hard fight but
I were outclassed when it came to loop
! ing in baskets. Woodward, forward,
and Kim Dyer, center, each made 6
I points for the fraternity team. Van
Etten, Independent forward, did some
j fancy shooting and tossed in three
goals.
Coming from behind in a last-min
i ute spurt, Phi Gamma Epsilon upset
j the dope sheet to beat out Kappa
Alpha by two points in a game filled
with football thrills. At times the
! contest degenerated into a hectic
brawl of fisticuffs. Davis tossed in
I five tallies for the K.A.'s before he
was removed from the game for "un
gentlemanly conduct." One of the
Fiji boys was also ejected because of
his rough play. Roberts stood out at
guard for the winners.
Phi Psi's Win
Weaver led the Phi Psi's to victory
over the Kappa Sigs in a rough-and-
I tumble game. The lanky forward sank
| five baskets for a total of 10 points.
| "Cy" Mann starred for the losing
| quintet and featured an otherwise
slow game with his guarding and
dribbling.
When a desperate last-minute rally
fell short by two points of tying the
score, Alpha Tau Omega was nosed
out by the Chi Psi Lodge team yes
terday afternoon. Hossom, at center,
stood out for the losers and was high
! point man of the ragged contest with
II tallies. D. Russ, for Chi Psi, also
! played a nice game at center and
j scored 7 markers for his outfit.
Encina 5 loafed in to an easy win
from Encina 4E. Bartlett, flashy for
ward on the winning squad, was high
scorer with 11 points. Besides looping
in a couple of long shots, he displayed
a classy brand of floorwork. Encina 5
piled up an early lead and then took
things easy to win by a comfortable
margin.
Two Games Are Slow
In the slowest game of the day In
dependent 1 ran away from a slug
gish Sequoia 2 quintet. The Independ
ent boys missed enough sucker shots
to have at least doubled the score.
Sagal, at forward, was the outstand
ing player on the floor and tossed in
i 9 of the winning team's points. Leven
| also showed up well for the Independ
ents by his floorwork and timely
shooting.
Los Arcos out-fumbled and out
roughed El Cuadro to take a 7 to 2
j victory in the worst-played game of
i the mural tourney to date. Only one
1 field goal was made during the entire
1 fracas. El Cuadro failed to sink a
j single basket and had to be content
j with two free throws as its total
score. Two "fighting fumblers," one
from each outfit, were thrown out
of the game on four fouls.

slow game with his guarding and

When a desperate last-minute rally
fell short by two points of tying the
score, Alpha Tau Omega was nosed
out by the Chi Psi Lodge team yes
terday afternoon. Hossom, at center,
stood out for the losers and was high
! point man of the ragged contest with
II tallies. D. Russ, for Chi Psi, also
! played a nice game at center and
j scored 7 markers for his outfit.
Encina 5 loafed in to an easy win
from Encina 4E. Bartlett, flashy for
ward on the winning squad, was high
scorer with 11 points. Besides looping
in a couple of long shots, he displayed
a classy brand of floorwork. Encina 5
piled up an early lead and then took
things easy to win by a comfortable
margin.
Two Games Are Slow
In the slowest game of the day In
dependent 1 ran away from a slug
gish Sequoia 2 quintet. The Independ
ent boys missed enough sucker shots
to have at least doubled the score.
Sagal, at forward, was the outstand
ing player on the floor and tossed in
i 9 of the winning team's points. Leven
| also showed up well for the Independ
ents by his floorwork and timely
shooting.
Los Arcos out-fumbled and out
roughed El Cuadro to take a 7 to 2
j victory in the worst-played game of
i the mural tourney to date. Only one
1 field goal was made during the entire
1 fracas. El Cuadro failed to sink a
j single basket and had to be content
j with two free throws as its total
score. Two "fighting fumblers," one
from each outfit, were thrown out
of the game on four fouls.
