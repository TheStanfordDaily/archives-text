# PAN-HELLENIC WAIVES VOTE ON ABOLITION OF SORORITIES
## Nine Senior Committee Women on Board Vote Not to Meet Campus Housing Problem; One in Favor of Individual Vote; Group Asks "Concrete" Evidence of Dormitories 
### 
r)AN-HELLENIC yesterday afternoon went on record as being in favor of
"not meeting the problem of the abolition of sororities until dormitories
can be presented to Stanford women in concrete form." The vote of the ten
houses cast by their senior representatives was nine in favor of a motion to
this effect, and one opposed. This decision was reached after a vote, which
resulted in a tie, was taken on a motion that a sorority vote on abolition
should not be held. Five of the houses favored and five opposed the motion.
Discussion during the meeting was heated. Ellen Woerner, president of
Pan-Hellenic, introduced the problem by explaining the conditions under
which a vote would be taken: there would have to be large majority in favor
of the abolition of sororities in the case of a vote before any definite steps
would be taken; that a vote of the pledges of the sororities would be held
— — <$> separately; that the vote would be

either by signed ballots with a neu
tral person counting, or by secret bal
lot with the polls conducted by im
i partial alumnae.
Questions Suggested
Miss Woerner then explained that
if the vote were taken it would prob
ably be in the form of two or three
questions, and suggested the follow
ing: first, are you in favor in princi
ple of sororities on the Stanford cam
pus? Second, if in five years the
Board of Trustees guaranteed that
dormitories would be ready for the
women, would you be willing to
pledge no more members after this
class has been initiated? Third, if
this guarantee were not given, would
you be in favor of the abolition of
sororities?
The discussion began immediately.
Arguments cited in favor of not hold
ing a vote on abolition ran as fol
lows: that Pan-hellenic was being
forced into taking a vote by people
entirely outside; that the position of
Pan-hellenic would be weakened if it
presented the question to the women,
because by so doing it would show
that it was considering abolition; that
the administration is trying to put
the sororities and fraternities off the
campus, and is working to get them
to do it of their own accord.
Opposing Arguments
Those who argued for holding a
vote of sorority women on the ques
tions, gave the following reasons:
that the question had been brought
up because there was considerable
feeling among Row as well as other
people, that sororities should be abol
ished; that a vote should be taken to
see exactly what the opinion of the
Row women is; that a committee
should he appointed to get informa
tion from the Board of Trustees con
cerning the possibility of building
dormitories, and how long it will tako
to accomplish this.
