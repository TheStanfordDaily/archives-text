# WEEK-END CRASH VICTIMS IMPROVE; ONE IN HOSPITAL
## Milligan Convalescing After Early Sunday Morning Wreck on Drive 
### 
Four students injured in automobile
accidents over the week-end were re
ported to be recovered or convalescing
today.
They are:
Kenneth Milligan, Kappa Sigma,
fractured ribs and torn shoulder liga
ments.
Elizabeth Doyle, Pi Beta Phi, frac
tured ribs.
Phebe Ward, Palo Alto, cuts and
abrasions.
Austin Clapp, Encina, fractured
wrist.
Milligan rceived his injuries early Sun
day morning when his car struck a tree
on Palm Drive. Police found him un
conscious in the wrecked car and re
moved him to the Palo Alto Hospital
where he is expected to be confined for i
several days. Hospital attendants report
his condition as not serious.
Elizabeth Doyle was also treated in the j
Palo Alto Hospital but was dismissed j
yesterday. She is suffering from three j
fractured ribs received in an automobile j
collision on Palm Drive at 1:30 o'clock j
Saturday morning.
She was riding with another girl and j
Donald Wright in a light roadster driven 1
by Nelson Mills when Mills attempted to j
make a left turn at an intersection and
collided with a car driven by J. C. Sny
der. Mills' car overturned several times j
and was demolished while Snyder's car j
crashed into a tree. The men were treat
ed at the hospital for slight cuts and ;
bruises. The other passengers in Snyder's ,
car were uninjured.
Phebe Ward, an Enguish graduate, was j
treated at the Beresford Community Hos- !
pital for cuts and abrasions which she |
received when the car in which she was j
riding was struck by a hit-run driver on J
the highway near San Carlos. The driver â– 
was later captured and is being held with 1
his companions in the Redwood City jail.
Miss Ward's injuries were not serious
enough to prevent her from returning to
Palo Alto.
Austin Clapp, freshman swimmer, sus- !
tained his injury when he fell from the 1
side of an automobile on which he was ,
riding near the postoffice.
