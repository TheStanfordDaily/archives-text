# BASEBALL TEAM WILL PLAY "PRO" STARS TOMORROW
## 
### 
The greatest collection of professional
stars ever to grace a Stanford diamond
will meet the varsity here tomorrow af
ternoon as representatives of the Lee
Haberdashery team of Berkeley. Five
major and seven minor leaguers will com
prise the visiting squad, and nearly all
of these men are the class of their
leagues.
Coach Harry Woltcr is rather pessi
mistic about the chances of the Cards, hut
after their victory over Gran,it Brothers
last week, and in view of the fact that the
professionals will probably he in pretty
poor condition, it is likely that the var
sity will make it an interesting contest.
Without doubt, the Card batters will
undergo a severe nervous strain at their
first taste of big league pitching.
