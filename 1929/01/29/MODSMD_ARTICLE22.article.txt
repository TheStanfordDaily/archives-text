# Discretion, If Not Valor

The sororities will not vote upon the question of their abolition, Pan
-1 lellenic decided yesterday after a protracted argument. On the first
vote, five members favored and five opposed putting the question of
abolition to ballot. Much talk ensued; finally, the body went on record,
by a vote of nine to one, that it was in favor "of not meeting the problem
until dormitories can be presented in concrete form to Stanford women."
The motion neatly sidesteps the present crisis. But sidestepping, we
think, is wise, although it seems to be far from courageous. If a vote to
abolish sororities were passed, a temporary arrangement, pending the
building of dormitories, would have to be made to house the women in
the present sorority houses. Such a condition of living would give rise
to new evils which would in turn have to be eradicated. Cliques would
form, just the same as now, and only the bane of rushing would be elimi
nated. But in the sorority-boarding house, uncongeniality would flourish
where it is practically nonexistent now. And at best the arrangement
would be temporary.
If the vote were to have turned out in favor of retaining the sororities,
the action would have set an obstacle in the way of the women's making
an honestly arrived at decision when the dormitories are "in concrete
form." (By the way, Pan-Hellenic, suppose the Trustees build those
dormitories out of brick or sandstone. What then?)
When the dormitories are definitely promised, and the time for mak
ing a decision is come, all Stanford women should have a voice in the
question of the retention or abolition of sororities. Sorority women will
object to the non-Greeks having a decision, because they assume the Hall
women will be biased. Are not sorority women themselves quite biased
upon the question? And should not the occupants of Roble have a right
to say whether or not they want Greek letter societies lodged in their
halls? For if the sororities are not willing, at the time the dormitories
are built, to abolish themselves, they will presumably move into the halls
and continue to exist as separate societies.
It's a hard knot to untangle, but when the time comes to untangle it,
every Stanford woman should be given a part in the solution.

and continue to exist as separate societies.
It's a hard knot to untangle, but when the time comes to untangle it,
every Stanford woman should be given a part in the solution.
The sororities will not vote upon the question of their abolition, Pan
-1 lellenic decided yesterday after a protracted argument. On the first
vote, five members favored and five opposed putting the question of
abolition to ballot. Much talk ensued; finally, the body went on record,
by a vote of nine to one, that it was in favor "of not meeting the problem
until dormitories can be presented in concrete form to Stanford women."
The motion neatly sidesteps the present crisis. But sidestepping, we
think, is wise, although it seems to be far from courageous. If a vote to
abolish sororities were passed, a temporary arrangement, pending the
building of dormitories, would have to be made to house the women in
the present sorority houses. Such a condition of living would give rise
to new evils which would in turn have to be eradicated. Cliques would
form, just the same as now, and only the bane of rushing would be elimi
nated. But in the sorority-boarding house, uncongeniality would flourish
where it is practically nonexistent now. And at best the arrangement
would be temporary.
If the vote were to have turned out in favor of retaining the sororities,
the action would have set an obstacle in the way of the women's making
an honestly arrived at decision when the dormitories are "in concrete
form." (By the way, Pan-Hellenic, suppose the Trustees build those
dormitories out of brick or sandstone. What then?)
When the dormitories are definitely promised, and the time for mak
ing a decision is come, all Stanford women should have a voice in the
question of the retention or abolition of sororities. Sorority women will
object to the non-Greeks having a decision, because they assume the Hall
women will be biased. Are not sorority women themselves quite biased
upon the question? And should not the occupants of Roble have a right
to say whether or not they want Greek letter societies lodged in their
halls? For if the sororities are not willing, at the time the dormitories
are built, to abolish themselves, they will presumably move into the halls
and continue to exist as separate societies.
