# Smoke Will Now Issue Through the Bars
## 
### 
Roble jolly-ups will henceforth be smoke-ups following a motion
passed there last night that smoking by both men and women be allowed
during dances. A second motion that it be permitted' in the music room
was also successful, but the voting on a third motion that smoking
be allowed in the lobby at any time will be postponed until next week, so
that "serious consideration" may be given the matter before final action
is taken.
At last another step has been taken toward the emancipation of these
Roble women. At last men will be able to enjoy a cigarette with the lady
fair within the privacy of the music room. No longer will men be forced
to go outside during a dance in order to light up, or, when it is raining
without, be forced to forego the pleasure of a smoke.
But Roble women are not yet sure whether they wish smoking in the
lobby or not. They are afraid, for instance, that the furniture may suffer
from cigarette butts laid indiscriminately about. They are afraid, too,
that the wrong impression may be given to older people entering the hall,
on seeing a smoke-filled room.

The same objections were raised when the smoking question was
brought up a few years ago, yet women have smoked since then in perfect

safety to themselves and the woodwork. Roble has not burned down
and we doubt if any of the furniture has been ruined.
Smoking in the lobby will come eventually; why not now? It's up
to you, women of Roble, to let down the bars of the "Bastille."
