# Lo! The Poor Professor

### 
(From the Cornell Daily Sun)
President Angell's announcement that Yale University has not only
proffered its impecunious faculty a special group life insurance but has
undertaken to pay a substantial part of the premiums involved, is a strik
ing commentary upon the low economic level occupied by the average
professor today.
By this action, the faculty of one of the country's leading universities
is placed in a class —economic only, it is true, but still a class—with day
laborers and factory hands whose slender earnings supply diurnal bread
and blankets, but suffice not for any more forward-looking necessities.
The professors of most of the other leading universities would undoubt
edly jump at a similar chance to join this classification, but the humiliating
quality of this category nevertheless remains.
The educational system in America is in a decidedly bad way when
scholastic salaries are so low that only semi-charitable assistance can in
sure the children and future widows of Yale's impoverished doctors of
philosophy an even chance in life. It is indeed gratifying that the trustees
of Yale have arranged to reward their professors fittingly after they are
dead, but it still remains for some educational Einstein to figure out a
Method for suitably recognizing professional merit among the living.
The editorial stuff of the Daily will meet at 1 o'clock today.
