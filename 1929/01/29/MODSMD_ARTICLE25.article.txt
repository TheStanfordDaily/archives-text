## ROBLE IS A BASTILLE 
### 
I Mr. Norman, Sir:
You're right, the sorority member j
is right, and Maxine Gushing is right, I
hut you are all also wrong. Roble is a \
Bastille —to the woman who resents '
having but one alternative if she |
doesn't "go Row." The men are partly
responsible for Roble's forbidding as- i
pect to the woman who likes frivolity, j
Rather, a small group of men, espe- j
! cially of those men who are most as
siduous in the pursuit of feminine j
company, because they have a little
way of trying to influence women to
join some Greek-letter society. On the i
other band, Roble has distinct advan
tages in superior material comfort,
and in the possibility of getting away j
from people.
You, Mr. Norman, are a fraternity
man. Have you never become thor- ;
oughly annoyed at the thought of
never being able to get away from I
|"the brothers"? Have you never felt
i like throwing out your usually accep- j
I table roommate and locking the door j
behind him? I have frequently heard
the expression of such sentiments on
| the part of sorority women, although
I dare say they wouldn't Put them
j down in black and white. That brings
us, I see, back to your assertion that
the women have too many rules,

] where again you are right.
Do not take it from the above that
! I am dead set against the sororities.
I As a matter of fact I am one of those i
j non-sorority women who admit a sort
of fondness for the Greek letter so
j cieties, but while I admit it, I must
I also confess that my intelligence (as
: I like to think) tells me that the
| sororities as a whole, as they are at
| present, are of no use, and if anything
! are a bane .
After all, all I am trying to do, Mr.
| Norman, is to offer my slight support
to your own campaign, which I think
i in the main a pretty sane one. Don't
cease firing! You may yet find un
expected support from some brave
Grecian maiden who will consent to
' blame her organization under the I
benevolent veil of anonymity which
the Daily is indeed according me in
printing this letter. I join with Sam
Pepys' Little Niece, whom I hereby
greet as not at all defunct but very
j much alive, in pleading for a real air- j
j ing of the question, even if it does
necessitate some of those hisses, 1
tears, and scratches which she be
wails. Maybe Allen Emery, Stanford
'IV, will feel better if the matter wins ,
through to daylight and the result
also appears in the Examiner!

the women have too many rules,

] where again you are right.
Do not take it from the above that
! I am dead set against the sororities.
I As a matter of fact I am one of those i
j non-sorority women who admit a sort
of fondness for the Greek letter so
j cieties, but while I admit it, I must
I also confess that my intelligence (as
: I like to think) tells me that the
| sororities as a whole, as they are at
| present, are of no use, and if anything
! are a bane .
After all, all I am trying to do, Mr.
| Norman, is to offer my slight support
to your own campaign, which I think
i in the main a pretty sane one. Don't
cease firing! You may yet find un
expected support from some brave
Grecian maiden who will consent to
' blame her organization under the I
benevolent veil of anonymity which
the Daily is indeed according me in
printing this letter. I join with Sam
Pepys' Little Niece, whom I hereby
greet as not at all defunct but very
j much alive, in pleading for a real air- j
j ing of the question, even if it does
necessitate some of those hisses, 1
tears, and scratches which she be
wails. Maybe Allen Emery, Stanford
'IV, will feel better if the matter wins ,
through to daylight and the result
also appears in the Examiner!

I Mr. Norman, Sir:
You're right, the sorority member j
is right, and Maxine Gushing is right, I
hut you are all also wrong. Roble is a \
Bastille —to the woman who resents '
having but one alternative if she |
doesn't "go Row." The men are partly
responsible for Roble's forbidding as- i
pect to the woman who likes frivolity, j
Rather, a small group of men, espe- j
! cially of those men who are most as
siduous in the pursuit of feminine j
company, because they have a little
way of trying to influence women to
join some Greek-letter society. On the i
other band, Roble has distinct advan
tages in superior material comfort,
and in the possibility of getting away j
from people.
You, Mr. Norman, are a fraternity
man. Have you never become thor- ;
oughly annoyed at the thought of
never being able to get away from I
|"the brothers"? Have you never felt
i like throwing out your usually accep- j
I table roommate and locking the door j
behind him? I have frequently heard
the expression of such sentiments on
| the part of sorority women, although
I dare say they wouldn't Put them
j down in black and white. That brings
us, I see, back to your assertion that
the women have too many rules,

] where again you are right.
