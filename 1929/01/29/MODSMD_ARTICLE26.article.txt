# REASONS FOR THE HONOR SYSTEM BREAKDOWN
## 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
It is time that we went to the base
of the trouble to find why our honor
| system has broken down in the last
i few years.
During the last few years the ad
ministration has "let down the bars"
and we have had an influx of trans- :
\ fers from other universities. At the
1 same time the administration has |
! "raised the tariff" on freshmen and
j we are receiving them in smaller
number each year.
A Stanford man is still thought of j
as one who has lived up to the ideals
of Stanford, a man who is socially re-<
sponsible, and a man who has been
| educated at least four years at Stan#
; tord. Our reputation will indeed suffer
when it is learned that one year of
work here will enable a man to be
classed as a Stanford graduate.
The head of the present adminis
(tration will do much better to put the

ideas in the interior of his head into
| practice in the "interior department"
rather than at Stanford.
j By letting in so many transfers and
because of there being only one year
of work at Stanford required for
graduation, we are potentially able
to graduate four times as many stu
dents as we have in past years. Is
| this a carefully thought-out plan con-
I ceived by the administration for the
purpose of getting a potential endow
! ment four times as large as would
otherwise be possible?
Many of these transfers are from
♦ "lounge lizard" colleges and do not
accept the honor system with the
spirit of a true Stanford man. A trans- i
! fer laughs at the system —a freshman
! reveres it as he does a senior woman.
When we keep out transfers and
i let in only freshmen, only ..then can '
* |
we look for a true observance of the |
honor system. —'26.
