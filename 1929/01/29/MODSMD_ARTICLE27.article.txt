# ALL TYPES OF PIPSQUEAKS ON THIS CAMPUS

### 
The Editor, Sir: [
Stanford men are very conceited.
They say condescendingly that the
members of the Five Hundred are all
"wet smacks." To quote from a Cam
pus Opinion:
"Stanford women are rated unfa
vorably as social assets by the men
of the various colleges. We all admit
that they have nice personalities, but
that the majority of them are 'A' stu
dents. Of course we all know some
nice girls, but then, too, the Dumbar
ton Bridge wasn't built entirely for
looks."
Sometimes one wonders whether ;

I the majority of the 2859 were built
entirely for looks. An extremely com
plete collection of all types of pip
squeaks wanders about this campus.
I wish the man who disparaged the
| Five Hundred would look about him
the next time he is on the Quad. I
think that even he would admit that
the Stanford men, taken collectively,
are just another case of "just too
bad." One doubts whether a Stanford j
man has a sense of humor. He surely j
hasn't a sense of the ridiculous if he
pusses judgment on the appearance i
;of others.
â€”One of the Five Hundred.
