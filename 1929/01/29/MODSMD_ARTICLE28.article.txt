# ANY MALE CAN GROW WHISKERS
## 
### 
jThe Editor, Sir:
We of the so-called "weaker sex"
have gleaned the information that
dear old Chappie is sponsoring an- !
other whisker-growing contest —for :
| men only. We have been pondering ;
on this subject very deeply of late, !
I and have arrived at the conclusion j
that this type of contest is entirely |
unworthy of Stanford men. Any male
1 can grow whiskers —or almost any.
We are quite certain of that. In fact,
! even in this day and age, we are still j
able to recognize a male without the j
aid of the aforesaid growths. This is j
perhaps due to the fact that we have
not yet adopted permanently your |
J trouser custom. When a girl is asked j
if she is letting her hair grow, she
can blush more or less prettily and
say, "Yes, don't you think it will look :
becoming?" But when a man is asked j
i if he is letting his beard grow, he
must perforce nonchalantly throw out !
his chest and answer, "Oh! I can't |
help it ,you know!"
Yes, yes, men! We know you can't
help it and that the beards will grow
, in spite of everything (providing you ]

leave the roommate's razor on the '
i shelf), but. why think you are so
'clever to ilo it? That is what we ob
i ject to. You might at least show a
little originality! Just think of the
: field that is open to you! You might
j shave your beards in spots so making
! designs as they do on French poodles. „
IWe are sure that a tassel here and
| there would add to the general effect.
I You might even go so far as to shave
I the insignia of your fraternity on one
side. Think of the saving that would
| be, since it would eliminate all neces-,
i sity for a pin. Also there would be
| no danger of theft or loss. It would
always be there so lhat we could have
i tlie full benefit of it. Or again, you
I might shave your initials among the
bristles. Still better, you might shave
the initials of your lady-love. Just
think of the thrill she would get,
| knowing that you are wearing her
; name, not only on your heart, but 011
j your face!
Absolutely, gentlemen. We of the
! fair sex advocate bigger and better
whisker-growing contests — provided
you use your imaginations!
Hopefully yours, Gil Ette.

Absolutely, gentlemen. We of the

jThe Editor, Sir:
We of the so-called "weaker sex"
have gleaned the information that
dear old Chappie is sponsoring an- !
other whisker-growing contest —for :
| men only. We have been pondering ;
on this subject very deeply of late, !
I and have arrived at the conclusion j
that this type of contest is entirely |
unworthy of Stanford men. Any male
1 can grow whiskers —or almost any.
We are quite certain of that. In fact,
! even in this day and age, we are still j
able to recognize a male without the j
aid of the aforesaid growths. This is j
perhaps due to the fact that we have
not yet adopted permanently your |
J trouser custom. When a girl is asked j
if she is letting her hair grow, she
can blush more or less prettily and
say, "Yes, don't you think it will look :
becoming?" But when a man is asked j
i if he is letting his beard grow, he
must perforce nonchalantly throw out !
his chest and answer, "Oh! I can't |
help it ,you know!"
Yes, yes, men! We know you can't
help it and that the beards will grow
, in spite of everything (providing you ]

leave the roommate's razor on the '
i shelf), but. why think you are so
'clever to ilo it? That is what we ob
i ject to. You might at least show a
little originality! Just think of the
: field that is open to you! You might
j shave your beards in spots so making
! designs as they do on French poodles. „
IWe are sure that a tassel here and
| there would add to the general effect.
I You might even go so far as to shave
I the insignia of your fraternity on one
side. Think of the saving that would
| be, since it would eliminate all neces-,
i sity for a pin. Also there would be
| no danger of theft or loss. It would
always be there so lhat we could have
i tlie full benefit of it. Or again, you
