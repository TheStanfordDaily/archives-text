# A 						Time And A Place

(From the Mcliill Daily)
Is there any necessity for students (if this University to satisfy their
epicurean desires by the absorption into their system of quantities of a|
botanical shrub of the genus and variety commonly known as garlic?
If there is may we ask again why it is also necessary for some of them
to betake themselves on such occasions into the sacred precincts of our
Library and there exhale, in the general direction of other harmless stu
dents, the questionable and yet unquestionable fragrance of their out-j
poured breath? Such, also, has been the case coming to the attention of
members of our staff during the recent migration to the Library prior to 1
examinations. Need this continue? We ask you.
