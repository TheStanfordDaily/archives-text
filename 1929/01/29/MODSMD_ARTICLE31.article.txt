OUR MUDDLED MESSIAH
We used to have a theory that Ar
thur Brisbane, that peculiar Ameri
can phenomenon, was really a high
and massive intellect who found it j
necessary, for bread and butter rea- ,
sons, to demean himself by grinding
out several yards of platitudes per
week.
Hut our theory lias suffered woe
fully since we became a convert and
took to perusing him daily. Granting
the fact that Mr. Hearst, who knows
how to peddle his papers, is the only
; person rightfully entitled to chide
Mr. Brisbane, nevertheless we cannot
help jumping up and down and com
menting on a couple of recent Bris
banalities.
To begin with, Mr. Brisbane has
been making himself something of a j
menace lately with his propaganda in
favor of preparation for war as the
best means of insuring peace. He
points to France as an example of
; the virtue of armament, stating that
if France had not been well-armed in
I 1014, Europe might now be ruled by
a certain Central Power. He seems |
to forget that general armament and
mutual fear constituted a prime cause ;
■
of the World War, with France per- j
j haps as much at fault as any nation
| in Europe.
Brisbane is spreading dangerous
propaganda. He should be told to con- i
| fine himself to such harmless plati- i
tudes as his recent dictum that "hot
: dogs," eaten in moderation pnd tlior
j oughly chewed, are good for men; but,
j carelessly chewed, are a cause of the
dyspepsia from which, he would have
us believe, 50 per cent of us Ameri- |

--- - i
cans suffer.
Wall Street seems to exercise an
irresistible fascination for our syndi
cated messiah. It is a rare day which
passes without generous comment
| trom him on the evils of the ticker
i tape habit. If some philanthropist
would present Mr. Brisbane with a
seat on the Exchange, so that he
might sit into the game and conquer
what seems to be a gnawing repres
sion, maybe we would cease to be so
postered with high finance in the
left-hand column.
We can forgive all this, for perhaps
it is just an indication of senility or
something, but the other day came
a Brisbanality which is just too ,
much:
He tells us that exclusion of Orien
tals is an issue vital to both the white
i and yellow races, on account of the
rapidly increasing number of Mongo
lian idiots!
Almost anyone who has struggled
through the sixth-grade primer knows
that "Mongolian idiot" is a classifica
tion given by psychiatrists to idiots |
with certain peculiar facial and physi
' cal characteristics, and has nothing
to do with the subject's race. In
| other words, the Mongolian idiot
I could be an Irishman, a Flying Dutch
man, or a blue-blooded descendant of
a long line of Caucasians named, for
example, Brisbane.
In these days when the Government
i is doing its best to increase eduea
i tional efficiency throughout the Uni
j ted States, it is a pity that we must
be burdened with an individual who
has such extensive facilities at his
command for the dissemination of ig
| nerance. —Winston Norman.
