Harness. By A. Hamilton Gibbs. (Bos
ton: Little, Brown and Company.
$2.50.)
We got around to a rather belated
reading of this one of the 1928 novel
crop, and found it to be well worth
I one's attention for an enjoyable eve-
I ning of relaxation. There is an air of
naturalness about the characters and
the plot that makes the story ring
I true.
It is the love story of Michael Gor
don, a one-woman man, in the first
years of married life. After strenuous
years in the War, Gordon marries
Patricia Wade and looks forward to
happiness and leisure for writing. The
present is an idyllic happiness in a
little cottage in the suburbs of Lon
don. The future brings just enough
turbulence to make a good story, with
out being melodramatic with too
■ much action, or on the other hand,
without being one of these introspec
, tive psychological pieces on account
i of too little concrete action.
Mr. Gibbs, however, is not solely
| concerned with telling a story. He
: does more. He gives us an authentic
j picture of the post-war era —the
generation that fought.—the younger
I generation that missed fighting—the
reaction to armed conflict —the jazz
mania. All these elements that we
are familiar with are integrated in
the light of Mr. Gibbs* varied experi
| ences.
Yes, there is a considerable under
current. of solid thought in this book.
The reader cannot help hut feel that
the author is terribly serious about
the ideas he expounds through Mi
chael Gordon. There is effective anti
war argument, and what seems to be
[ a plea for less hectic jazz-emotional
ism and more quiet hearth-stone hap
piness.
