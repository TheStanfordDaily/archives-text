# Jeanne. By Theda Kenyon. (New York: Ives Washburn. $2.50.)

### 
One would be hard set to find a
more ambitious theme than the one
chosen by Theda Ken yon. The
"Jeanne" of her title is none other
than the justly famous Maid of Or
leans, the maid whom so many have
tried to draw convincingly and well,
and have failed.
Unfortunately, it cannot he said
that the present author has succeeded
where so many of her predecessors
have failed. Her theory is that Jeanne
D'Arc, in the beginning, was the un
conscious tool of crafty men who for
their own rather vague purposes used
the belief in witchcraft and fairies to
make Jeanne first the "Elfame of
Domremy" and later the Maid who
was to save France.
Then Jeanne proved less docile
than they had expected; so they plot
ted for her ruin. The author gives the
story an entirely different ending
from the one usually accepted by his
tory, for in this version the one who
perishes in the flames at Rouen is
not Jeanne, but the man who is the
villain of the tale.
And then, there is also included a
love story with Jeanne for its heroine
and the good-looking, high-born
squire, Henri de Tours, for its hero.
A long bibliography appended to
the book indicates that the author has
studied her period carefully, but her

characters seem modern rather than J
medieval and there is too little of the j
spirit and flavor of the times to be
found in the narrative.
