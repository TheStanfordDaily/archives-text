# Technique of the Love Affair. (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1928.)

The reader will enjoy this book
more if she does not take it seriously, j
In fact I think that if the reader does
make the mistake of taking it seri- j
ously, she will not enjoy it at all — j
her peace of mind will be too seri
ously disturbed.
I say "she" purposely in referring
to the reader. This is most emphati
cally not a man's book. It is written
by an anonymous author, who frankly
admits that she has no sympathy for
a man's point of view, on the theory
that a man is able to take care of
himself with perfect success in any
of the problems which she covers.
No, it is for the women, those unfor- \
tunately handicapped creatures, whom
men have at such a disadvantage,
that this book is written.
The author's entire point of view
is based on this assumption: men are
more necessary to women than wo
men are to them, giving them an !
ascendancy with which women can
cope only by employing superior
guile. Honesty is never the best policy
for a woman, she maintains..
The book is rather upsetting be- j
cause all of its rules are a throw- ;
back to Mid-Victorian days, and thus
are counter to all present ideas. The i
"comrade-pal" relationship is scoffed i
at. intelligence is discounted, and
feminine weaknesses and vanities are
put at a premium. It is a splendid
hook to laugh over —providing that it (
doesn't make the college woman a
little uncomfortable. There is always
a chance that the author might know
what she is talking about.
Whether she does or not, she has
a delightful way of expressing her
astonishing views, introducing her
theories by a cleverly ridiculous take- 1
off on Socrates' renowned question
and answer method. In her book
teacher and pupil are represented by
Cypria and Sacharissa, the one a
young debutante, and the other a de
lightful woman of forty, who gives
her protege a great deal of witty and
subtle advice.
