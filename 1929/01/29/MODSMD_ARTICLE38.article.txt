It has always been Bill's ambition to
be a politician and make long speeches.
One day there came a committee of stu
dents to ask Bill if he would run for
Evanston alderman. It seems that alder
men sit and tell the mayor what to do.
Bill did not hesitate because of his youth,
but decided that "the sooner I start the
sooner I'll get there."
Alderman Knapp, who is now alder
man of the seventh district, has been
holding down the job for eighteen years.
Bill decided that he had gone to sleep on
the job, so now his campaign lias started
and his managers arc making dates for
him to speak before the various women's
organizations in the city.
