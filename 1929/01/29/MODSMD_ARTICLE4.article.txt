# Michio Ito Will Give Dance Poems Tonight
## 
### 
One of the foremost exponents of j
i the dance in this country will appear !
here tonight at 8:15 o'clock when
Michio Ito, famous Japanese dancer,
will offer a program of "Dance Poems"
in the Assembly Hall, under the aus-:
pices of the Peninsula Musical Asso- 1
! ciation.
Five of his most promising pupils
! will accompany Mr. Ito in his pre
sentation, all of whom have already j
been successful either in Broadway
productions in New York or in re- J
citals in this country and Europe. !
Three of them are American girls,
1 one is Russian and one Hungarian;
and they will assist in a program
which includes Spanish as well as
Oriental numbers.
Music is an integral thread of
I Michio Ito's compositions. Debussy,
Ravel, Yamada, and Tschaikowsky 1
: are among the composers with whose j
| melodies his dances are interwoven,
and several bits of purely Oriental
music will form part of the program.
! These two arts, allied as they are in
| the expression of rhythm and bar-1
mony, are made one in the art of Ito,
j every inflection of whose dancing re-,
sponds to another in the music.
Many pupils trained by Ito are
among the best-known dancers today, j
Ruth St. Denis, Florence O'Deni
j shawn, Ganna Walska, Ruth Page,
j Maria Gambarelli, and a host of
; others now famous have worked un
| der him and still follow his school.
He is the creator of almost all the j
j dances to be presented tomorrow, and :
has spent several years abroad study-!
ing the folk dances of European na- '
tions, many of which he has adapted
to concert use. â– 
Tickets for the recital tonight are i
on sale at Crandall's in Palo Alto. All j
seats downstairs are $1.50, and those 1
i in the balcony are $1.00.
