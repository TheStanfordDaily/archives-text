## IN MEMORIAM 
### 
Stanford is still in a bit of a daze
today following the catastrophe of
last Saturday evening when Cardinal
fans watched their basketeers take a
dreary beating from the Golden Bears
of California.
It was a swift, stunning blow
to the Stanford clan—and* that's
putting it mildly. After seven con
secutive victories, after seven
games of A1 basketball, after
seven whirlwind finishes those
from the Farm expected some
thing better than the 41 to 23
score of the nightmare game last
Saturday.
So campus wiseacres, sideline
coaches, and sincerely devoted Cardi
nal fans are taking stock of things;
trying to sum up the assets and defi
cits of tlie Cardinal crew and glean
out of that mess some inkling of jusl
why things turned out as they did.
Perhaps there are some valid
alibis which could be offered by
those from the Farm. Something
might be said about the officiat
ing or about the lighting of the
floor or the skidding baskets. But
alibis, after a 41 to 23 score, seem
pretty mean and puerile. And
after all, California probably has
just as much room for criticism
on that same score.
A two-year-old or a blind man could
see clearly enough that something !
was haywire with the Stanford hope
fuls Saturday. They had looked like 1
an honest-to-God basketball team pre
viously. And they still resembled one
somewhat during the first half of the
J California brawl. Those of us who
! were optimistic had begun to believe
! that a new day had arrived for Stan
! ford basketball.
But Husky Hunt, his players,
and the bewildered Cardinal fans
' found, shortly after the second
half began, that a two-point mar
gin isn't enough to sef up a bas
ketball game. A Bear offense—
the same Bear offense that has
been beating Stanford for years
—made the Stanford gestures at
defense look addled. Time after
time Stevens stood under the
Stanford basket, snagged a long
pass, and dropped the ball
through the hoop, while the Red
shirts were merrily chasing phan
tom Bears at the other end of the
court.
And all the time the Californians
were blithely committing fouls and
giving Stanford nice free shots at the
basket —twenty-six in all. The Cardi
nal sharpshooters made something of
a record in that connection by sinking
eight of them.
Why?
Maybe it was untimely substitu
tion. Perhaps it was poor plays; or
it might have been some of the pos
sible alibis already mentioned. That's
beside the point. Whatever the rea
son, the result was pretty awful.
Stanford players, we still believe, are
equal to any on the Coast. That elu
sive something which is holding them
back must be ironed out — and
promptly.
The season isn't over. Stanford
! gets a couple of cracks at Cal's little
! brother in Los Angeles over next
j week-end. There are yet two games
of the Big Series to be played. Let
us have a few moments of silent
prayer for what might have been and
what is to come.

W.C.S., writing in "The Morning I
After" column of the Daily Califor- j

nian, brings to mind another angle
which was almost forgotten. He says:
One of the San Francisco after
noon sheets topped off the orgy
last week by declaring, "Stanford
has a fair team down at the Farm
this year but they cannot be rated
in the same class as the super
team over at California." High
words of praise, that.
But to get down to the fact of
the matter. Stanford has won its
last seven games and has shown
bewildering pass work. Two
nights ago they handily defeated
the Olympic Club quintet with
three regulars sitting on the
bench. California also has won its
games, but in no contest have
they outclassed their opponents
as befits a "super-team," or even
look like good championship ma
terial.
Still the metropolitan sport
pages carry the same stuff that
thew started out with at the start
of the season.
A reputation is a funny thing.
That's a thought. The worthy ink
slingers up San Francisco way are
al fault, it's true, but they aren't the
only ones. Plenty of pseudo Stanford
supporters right here on the Farm
are of the same mind as the City
newspaper man. The opinion is freely
expressed that Stanford always has
been lousy at basketball, is lousy, and

I always will be lousy.
Perhaps if a few more people told
1 the Cards how good they are they
j might begin to believe it themselves.

which was almost forgotten. He says:
One of the San Francisco after
noon sheets topped off the orgy
last week by declaring, "Stanford
has a fair team down at the Farm
this year but they cannot be rated
in the same class as the super
team over at California." High
words of praise, that.
But to get down to the fact of
the matter. Stanford has won its
last seven games and has shown
bewildering pass work. Two
nights ago they handily defeated
the Olympic Club quintet with
three regulars sitting on the
bench. California also has won its
games, but in no contest have
they outclassed their opponents
as befits a "super-team," or even
look like good championship ma
terial.
Still the metropolitan sport
pages carry the same stuff that
thew started out with at the start
of the season.
A reputation is a funny thing.
That's a thought. The worthy ink
slingers up San Francisco way are
al fault, it's true, but they aren't the
only ones. Plenty of pseudo Stanford
supporters right here on the Farm
are of the same mind as the City
newspaper man. The opinion is freely
expressed that Stanford always has
been lousy at basketball, is lousy, and

I always will be lousy.
Perhaps if a few more people told
1 the Cards how good they are they
j might begin to believe it themselves.

Stanford is still in a bit of a daze
today following the catastrophe of
last Saturday evening when Cardinal
fans watched their basketeers take a
dreary beating from the Golden Bears
of California.
It was a swift, stunning blow
to the Stanford clan—and* that's
putting it mildly. After seven con
secutive victories, after seven
games of A1 basketball, after
seven whirlwind finishes those
from the Farm expected some
thing better than the 41 to 23
score of the nightmare game last
Saturday.
So campus wiseacres, sideline
coaches, and sincerely devoted Cardi
nal fans are taking stock of things;
trying to sum up the assets and defi
cits of tlie Cardinal crew and glean
out of that mess some inkling of jusl
why things turned out as they did.
Perhaps there are some valid
alibis which could be offered by
those from the Farm. Something
might be said about the officiat
ing or about the lighting of the
floor or the skidding baskets. But
alibis, after a 41 to 23 score, seem
pretty mean and puerile. And
after all, California probably has
just as much room for criticism
on that same score.
A two-year-old or a blind man could
see clearly enough that something !
was haywire with the Stanford hope
fuls Saturday. They had looked like 1
an honest-to-God basketball team pre
viously. And they still resembled one
somewhat during the first half of the
J California brawl. Those of us who
! were optimistic had begun to believe
! that a new day had arrived for Stan
! ford basketball.
But Husky Hunt, his players,
and the bewildered Cardinal fans
' found, shortly after the second
half began, that a two-point mar
gin isn't enough to sef up a bas
ketball game. A Bear offense—
the same Bear offense that has
been beating Stanford for years
—made the Stanford gestures at
defense look addled. Time after
time Stevens stood under the
Stanford basket, snagged a long
pass, and dropped the ball
through the hoop, while the Red
shirts were merrily chasing phan
tom Bears at the other end of the
court.
And all the time the Californians
were blithely committing fouls and
giving Stanford nice free shots at the
basket —twenty-six in all. The Cardi
nal sharpshooters made something of
a record in that connection by sinking
eight of them.
Why?
Maybe it was untimely substitu
tion. Perhaps it was poor plays; or
it might have been some of the pos
sible alibis already mentioned. That's
beside the point. Whatever the rea
son, the result was pretty awful.
Stanford players, we still believe, are
equal to any on the Coast. That elu
sive something which is holding them
back must be ironed out — and
promptly.
The season isn't over. Stanford
! gets a couple of cracks at Cal's little
! brother in Los Angeles over next
j week-end. There are yet two games
of the Big Series to be played. Let
us have a few moments of silent
prayer for what might have been and
what is to come.

ketball game. A Bear offense—
the same Bear offense that has
been beating Stanford for years
—made the Stanford gestures at
defense look addled. Time after
time Stevens stood under the
Stanford basket, snagged a long
pass, and dropped the ball
through the hoop, while the Red
shirts were merrily chasing phan
tom Bears at the other end of the
court.
And all the time the Californians
were blithely committing fouls and
giving Stanford nice free shots at the
basket —twenty-six in all. The Cardi
nal sharpshooters made something of
a record in that connection by sinking
eight of them.
Why?
Maybe it was untimely substitu
tion. Perhaps it was poor plays; or
it might have been some of the pos
sible alibis already mentioned. That's
beside the point. Whatever the rea
son, the result was pretty awful.
Stanford players, we still believe, are
equal to any on the Coast. That elu
sive something which is holding them
back must be ironed out — and
promptly.
The season isn't over. Stanford
! gets a couple of cracks at Cal's little
! brother in Los Angeles over next
j week-end. There are yet two games
of the Big Series to be played. Let
us have a few moments of silent
prayer for what might have been and
what is to come.

W.C.S., writing in "The Morning I
After" column of the Daily Califor- j

nian, brings to mind another angle
which was almost forgotten. He says:
One of the San Francisco after
noon sheets topped off the orgy
last week by declaring, "Stanford
has a fair team down at the Farm
this year but they cannot be rated
in the same class as the super
team over at California." High
words of praise, that.
But to get down to the fact of
the matter. Stanford has won its
last seven games and has shown
bewildering pass work. Two
nights ago they handily defeated
the Olympic Club quintet with
three regulars sitting on the
bench. California also has won its
games, but in no contest have
they outclassed their opponents
as befits a "super-team," or even
look like good championship ma
terial.
Still the metropolitan sport
pages carry the same stuff that
thew started out with at the start
of the season.
A reputation is a funny thing.
That's a thought. The worthy ink
slingers up San Francisco way are
al fault, it's true, but they aren't the
only ones. Plenty of pseudo Stanford
supporters right here on the Farm
are of the same mind as the City
newspaper man. The opinion is freely
expressed that Stanford always has
been lousy at basketball, is lousy, and

I always will be lousy.
Perhaps if a few more people told
1 the Cards how good they are they
j might begin to believe it themselves.

The University of California lost

checks.
Stanford is still in a bit of a daze
today following the catastrophe of
last Saturday evening when Cardinal
fans watched their basketeers take a
dreary beating from the Golden Bears
of California.
It was a swift, stunning blow
to the Stanford clan—and* that's
putting it mildly. After seven con
secutive victories, after seven
games of A1 basketball, after
seven whirlwind finishes those
from the Farm expected some
thing better than the 41 to 23
score of the nightmare game last
Saturday.
So campus wiseacres, sideline
coaches, and sincerely devoted Cardi
nal fans are taking stock of things;
trying to sum up the assets and defi
cits of tlie Cardinal crew and glean
out of that mess some inkling of jusl
why things turned out as they did.
Perhaps there are some valid
alibis which could be offered by
those from the Farm. Something
might be said about the officiat
ing or about the lighting of the
floor or the skidding baskets. But
alibis, after a 41 to 23 score, seem
pretty mean and puerile. And
after all, California probably has
just as much room for criticism
on that same score.
A two-year-old or a blind man could
see clearly enough that something !
was haywire with the Stanford hope
fuls Saturday. They had looked like 1
an honest-to-God basketball team pre
viously. And they still resembled one
somewhat during the first half of the
J California brawl. Those of us who
! were optimistic had begun to believe
! that a new day had arrived for Stan
! ford basketball.
But Husky Hunt, his players,
and the bewildered Cardinal fans
' found, shortly after the second
half began, that a two-point mar
gin isn't enough to sef up a bas
ketball game. A Bear offense—
