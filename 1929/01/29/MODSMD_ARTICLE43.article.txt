# SPORTS OF 1929
## From Campus To Big Time 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
It is customary every year for nu-
merous college football heroes to join
up with major league ball clubs, with
much accompanying ballyhoo and
| snapping of cameras and clicking of j
1 typewriters. Some of these boys make
I good and become even more famous ,
on the diamond than they were on;
I the gridiron, while others fail dis- I
mally and are soon in the minor
leagues or out selling bonds or in
surance. Others, like Jim Thorpe,
1 stick in the Big Time partly because
they are colorful and their names at
tract customers, although they are
not first-class baseball players.
What will be the fate of Ed Halicki,
i
! brightest diamond star of Bucknell
College since Christy Mathewson, and
Johnnie Niemiec, of Notre Dame, who
"graduate" to the Cardinals and White
j Sox, respectively, next June? Both
have made good reputations in each j
sport at college. Fate will soon de- ;
1 cide whether they are to be second |

, Frisches or Collinses or Overalls or
â€¢'Matty's," or "False Alarms," like
] many another college gridiron hero I
j could name.
Then there's Fay Thomas, alias
i Collins (Eddie Collins, remember,
was "alias Sullivan" when he was at
; Columbia and playing for the Ath
| letics). Fay was football captain of
1 the Southern California team in 1925,
but got the air beteause it was learned
that he was a pro baseballer during
the summer. In the minors he played
for awhile as "P. G. Collins," but in
stead of reporting to Oklahoma City
lie had a tryout with the Giants under
his real name. Judge Landis heard of
I all this, and gave Fay a year to think
it over. Then the Yankees bought him
from Oklahoma City. Will he make
; good as Larry Bettencourt of St.
Mary's College and the Browns did,
| or fail like Ernie Nevers, of Stanford,
j who is back in the minors after a
| trial with the same St. Louis team?
