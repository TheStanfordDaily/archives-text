# Y.M.C.A. PLACES ANNUAL BUDGET GOAL AT $6550
## 
### 
With a sum of $6550 as a goal, the 1929
| Young Men's Christian Association an
| nual budget drive was launched today.
Since the policies of the Stanford j
i Y.M.C.A. are controlled primarily by the ;
' students and its program is developed in
large part by the student cabinet, it is felt
that the responsibility for at least a part
lof the money necessary for the work
; should be assumed by the students, an- ;
| nounces Secretary Ben Culver.
It is planned that $500 will be con- i
I tributed by students, $500 by the faculty,
$3000 by alumni and parents, and $1500,
by the Palo Alto residents and friends of I
j the association.
A special fund has been secured from \
j friends to provide for a refurnishing plan !
which will include a c<*nfortable reading
; room and lounge, where home-town pa
j pers, current magazines, and books will j
i be provided.
i Activities of the Y.M.C.A. for which
j funds are expended include room listing,
| information service, boys' work, fresh
i man orientation conference, reading room,
j social service, Asilomar and Montezuma
conferences, freshman council, friendly
relations committee, speakers, discussions
and forums, and co-operation of other
organizations in the promotion of activi
ties of common interest.
