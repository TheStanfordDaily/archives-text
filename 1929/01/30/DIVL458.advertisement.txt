C/IDVERTISING plays no favorites—it makes I
friends of you and for you. It is constantly *
offering kindly assistance by introducing worthy 1
merchandise to you. It tells you of the best
clothes; of the newest time and labor-saving
devices; of opportunities to save money by j
making certain purchases at certain stores on
specified days. It even points the way that
enables you to keep yourself physically fit and .
mentally alert.
Advertising is, unconsciously to you per
haps, your steadfast friend. It has established
an era of good feeling between you, the stores,
the manufacturers and their products. Adver
tising is honest and sincere. You can believe it
and believe in the product it calls to your at
tention. Advertising is a real friend-maker.
