### 
MADRID, Jan. 29 (/P> â€” Prompt |
measure by the Government of Premier j
Primo de Rivera today nipped in the bud i
another military revolt against the dic
tatorship.
Although the rebelion was planned to
break out simultaneously throughout \
Spain and indeed did crop out in several !
of the larger cities of the south, its only |
foothold was gained in the provincial
capital of Ciudad Real.
A regiment of field artillery at Ciudad j
Real rolled out their cannon so as to i
command the roads an daprpoaches of I
the walled city.
The government, blaming only the
officers, sent a squadron of airplanes over
th city to drop proclamations promising
that only the leaders would be punished ,
it the soldiers surrendered before scri- {
ous fighting occurred
While waiting the outcome of these !
peace overtures several squadrons of
cavalry clattered out of the ancient city j
of Alcala, and a large force of civil
guards, heavily armed, proceeded south I (
in motor buses. J,
General Orgaz led an infantry brigade j
from Madrid. The Premier announced j.
tonight that the General was expected to .
reach Ciudad Real at midnight and would : (
take charge of the situation. (
During their brief control of the city j ,
the mutineers prevented all trains from
entering and leaving Ciudad Real. They |
occupied the barracks of the gendarmes, j (
Ciudad Real is about 100 miles south of t ,
Madrid.
The revolt also was reported to have 1
shown itself at Valencia, Barcelona and [
Corunna without gaining headway in any
of these cities however.
Premier Primo de Rivera informed the
National Assembly today that the Gov- j
eynment had completely suppressed the !
rebellion which had been planned for i
midnight throughout Spain.
He stilted that the subversive move
ments had been completely frustrated
and that the entire country was quiet.
The Premier added that stern meas
ures would be taken against the organ
izers of the movement at Ciudad Real,
but not against soldiers who had blindly ,
followed their leaders.
The session of the National Assembly
was extremely tense as a special meeting ,
of the Cabinet had been held at the Min
istry of War this morning and rumors (
of trouble had spread.
