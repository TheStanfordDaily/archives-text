# BRUIN SERIES IS CAUSE OF CARD WORRY
## Regular Lineup Will Start Against Southern Team Friday Night 
### ANSON REEDER 
Now that tlie last post-mortem of
the California game has been held,
supporters of the Stanford basketball
team are looking with some anxiety
toward the two clashes with UCLAns
this week-end in Los Angeles.
Saturday the Trojans of Southern
California put the kibosh on the
UCLAns after a feverish argument,
but the Bruins were minus the ser
vices of their captain and mainstay
of their offense, Sammy Baiter. It
seems Sammy participated in the
publishing of a very sour sheet called
"Hells Bells." This publication is is
sued once each semester for the pur
pose of razzing various local authori
ties, both student and otherwise.
Faculty Disapproves
The faculty decided that this par
ticular issue was very, very naughty,
and that certain portions of it bor
dered on smut. As a result the thir
teen men responsible for the publish
ing felt the sharp edge of the faculty
axe. Sammy was among the thirteen,
and unless he is reinstated before
tins week-end the Bruins will go into
the game at a disadvantage.
The fact that UCLA, in the two
games which they played against
California, was not beaten by more
than five points in either contest,
shows that they are a team to be
feared even when they are without
the services of their captain.
Stanford's defense, judging by past
performances, could stand a great
deal of improvement. In the game Sat
urday they were nearly always slow
in getting back down the court to aid
the guards in halting California's
three-man offense. This made Captain
Hothert and Reynolds look like a cou
ple of high school kids trying to flag
a train. These two guards, both more
than six feet tall and weighing around
190 pounds, should be feared by every
forward on the coast, but their games
to date have been just mediocre.
Regular Lineup to Start
The same line-up that started
against the Bears will take the floor
against the Bruins Friday night. Mc-
Candless, Moffatt, and Tyler will prob
ably see plenty of action, too. A great
deal depends on the series this week
ened, for if the Cards take these two
games without much trouble they
should have a good chance with the
Californians when the two teams meet
here for their second tilt February 9.
The Bears will undoubtedly find the
going a little harder when they play
on a good floor. But they should con
sole themselves, for though the
shingled backboards and the barrel
hoop baskets of the home court will
be missing, they will still have their
gridiron training to fall back on.
