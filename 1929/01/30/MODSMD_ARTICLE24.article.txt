# Oyez! Oyez!

Mid-year appointments to positions on the editorial staff of the Daily
were made yesterday by the Editorial Board, in anticipation of the change
of regime which will come next Tuesday when Volume 74 will close and
a new editor will be elected for the remainder of the college year.
The system of making appointments for the ensuing term of editor
ship, before the editor has been elected, was incorporated into the re
vised A. S. S. U. constitution, adopted last June, and is working out on
the Daily for the first time. It is designed to eliminate the "spoils
system" and, along with that, odious staff politics. Such harmony has
actually been fostered by the arrangement that the two candidates for
editor in next Tuesday's election have agreed that the man who is de
feated will stay on the staff as managing editor. Thus, whatever the
outcome, a valuable man is saved who under the old custom would have
been lost, for defeated candidates used immediately to retire from ac
tivity on the paper. The candidates in the forthcoming election are Jack
] lodges, managing editor, and Calvin Wood, associate editor.
The aides-de-camp of the next editor will be Merle Emry and Milton
Silverman, associate editors, and Margaret Cummings, women's editor.
Faithful and uncommonly good work has put Miss Cummings at her
goal, one of the most prominent positions for women on the campus, and
likewise the same sort of service has boosted Silverman and Emry to
within striking distance of their ultimate plum (or green grape), the
editorship, for which they will—in the course of events —contend at the
elections this spring. It seems a bit forced for us to be praising these
lads, whom we are so accustomed to roasting, but we feel a modicum of
laud will do them no harm.
As to the new night editors, they are such as might spring up any
where. Alice Ingraham, Sylva Weaver, Carroll O'Meara and Marvin
Skipwith were obviously chosen for lack of better choices. But then,
putting out the Daily is such a sinecure in these days of lots of pictures
and no news, that they probably will hobble to press well enough when
the time comes.
Joe Gordon, Allan Hart, Mary Edith Jones, Donald Oswill and Mary
Lee Richmond were appointed to be copy editors for no good reason at
i:ll, since there is already a plethora to cover up the more glaring mis
takes which these will make.
Seriously, there is something to be said in favor of the new system:
it has eliminated politics, to all appearances. That is certainly a seven
league step toward Utopia.
