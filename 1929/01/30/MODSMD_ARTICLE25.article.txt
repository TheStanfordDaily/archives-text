An inquisitive soul by the name of Lois Steele on Monday asked in
a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle what five to the hundredth power
was.
Yesterday, a deluge of answers descended upon the head of the editor
of the Safety Valve, attempting to show the answer. Among them were
two from Stanford readers and one from a Palo Alto correspondent.
These were the correct answers of the lot, and as an educational center,
we may take pride in our mathematical skill. R. W. Anient, of Stanford,
brought out that five to the hundredth power is seven million eight hun
dred and eighty-eight thousand six hundred septillions of decillions.
William B. Nute, of Palo Alto, showed that:
5 to the 100 th power equals 100 log. 5
Log. 5 equals 0.69897
100 log. 5 equals 0.69897 X 100 = 69.897
Anti-log. .897 equals 7.89
5 to the 100 th power equals 7.89 * 10 to the 69th power.
Which is to say that 5 to the 100 th power is 789 followed by sixty
seven digits, an altogether useless number to anyone but a bacteriologist
taking inventory or a Ripley seeking something startling to give the
public.
