# See the Coming Masters of the Sour Science

Semi-finals and finals in seven weights will be run off tonight in the
Pavilion as the closing events of the Novice Boxing Tournament, spon
sored by Circle S society. The gate charge is twenty-five cents, which is
praiseworthily modest for the amount of action provided. Moreover, the
cause for which the proceeds go is worthy: the purchase of a trophy case
tor minor sports trophies. When this case is a reality, it will be placed
in the trophy room of Encina Gym, for your grandchildren to see.
The fights are your money's worthâ€”make no mistake.
