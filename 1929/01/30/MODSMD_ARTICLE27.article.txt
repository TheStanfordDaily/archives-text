# The 						Democratic Female
## 
### 
(From the Providence, R. 1., Bulletin)
Young Mr. Winston Norman, student, journalist, and defender of women, who
knows his Stanford University, its tears and laughter, like a book, comes out
roundly in his college daily against sororities. He vows that they are embittering
the sweet female life of the campus. He wants to have them—sororities, that is—
abolished.
Roble Hall, whither the rejected sisterhood carry their sorrows, is today a wail
jng place. For pledge day is just over. Some of the maidens have !>ecn elected to
membership in sororities, welcomed across the lighted threshold with a kiss, and
others who had set their hearts upon the bright distinction have been turned away
Thus has a subtle rift, which will widen into a yawning chasm with the years, been
started. "The new sister-to-l>e," crics Winston, "will drop away from her less
fortunate room-mate. Their college world will be different."
Alas, it is true. Yet if this grievous parting didn't come on the campus at
Stanford it would come later on. So it is just as well to get it over with. Among
Stanford men, he says, democracy prevails because it is the nature of man to judge
his fellow "for himself alone, regardless of where he chooses to live." Women arc
different. They arc, oh, they are!
We bleed along with Mr. Norman over the unhappy situation. But wc see no
way out of it. If he thinks that abolishing sororities would make any difference,
let him study the situation abroad, where sororities are not known. He will observe
less stupid, but equally cruci distinctions drawn between one woman and another—
between one group of young women and another. I>et him look on the spectacle of
later life and see the same phenomenon repeated despite a heroic effort to overcome
it. Only at the zoo will he find the situation reversed. There the males tear one
another, while the females docilely congregate.
The thing for Roble Hall to do is to patch up its wounds, unfurl its own stand
ard of democracy and march gaily against the chosen ones. Scholastic honors,
medals, men await them. If they can go forward in this triumphant spirit and not
shortly break up into new divisions they will, of a surety, establish on the Stanford
campus a democracy the like of which the world has never seen.

Alas, it is true. Yet if this grievous parting didn't come on the campus at
Stanford it would come later on. So it is just as well to get it over with. Among
Stanford men, he says, democracy prevails because it is the nature of man to judge
his fellow "for himself alone, regardless of where he chooses to live." Women arc
different. They arc, oh, they are!
We bleed along with Mr. Norman over the unhappy situation. But wc see no
way out of it. If he thinks that abolishing sororities would make any difference,
let him study the situation abroad, where sororities are not known. He will observe
less stupid, but equally cruci distinctions drawn between one woman and another—
between one group of young women and another. I>et him look on the spectacle of
later life and see the same phenomenon repeated despite a heroic effort to overcome
it. Only at the zoo will he find the situation reversed. There the males tear one
another, while the females docilely congregate.
The thing for Roble Hall to do is to patch up its wounds, unfurl its own stand
ard of democracy and march gaily against the chosen ones. Scholastic honors,
medals, men await them. If they can go forward in this triumphant spirit and not
shortly break up into new divisions they will, of a surety, establish on the Stanford
campus a democracy the like of which the world has never seen.

Young Mr. Winston Norman, student, journalist, and defender of women, who
knows his Stanford University, its tears and laughter, like a book, comes out
roundly in his college daily against sororities. He vows that they are embittering
the sweet female life of the campus. He wants to have them—sororities, that is—
abolished.
Roble Hall, whither the rejected sisterhood carry their sorrows, is today a wail
jng place. For pledge day is just over. Some of the maidens have !>ecn elected to
membership in sororities, welcomed across the lighted threshold with a kiss, and
others who had set their hearts upon the bright distinction have been turned away
Thus has a subtle rift, which will widen into a yawning chasm with the years, been
started. "The new sister-to-l>e," crics Winston, "will drop away from her less
fortunate room-mate. Their college world will be different."
