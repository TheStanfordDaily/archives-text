## HONOR CODE A FACULTY RESPONSIBILITY, TOO 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Though Thursday's assembly can
not be said to have been productive
of any decisive results regarding the
Honor Code it nevertheless was of
value in that it stimulated thought
in the minds of many who previously
have been but little concerned with
the matter. For this reason, if for
no other, the assembly was of de
cided value.
In my own thoughts regarding the
matter there ts one fact of paramount
importance and this fact has been
touched upon but superficially—it
seems to have escaped attention.
That fact is that the success or fail
ure of the Honor System rests not
alone with the students of this Uni
versity, but with the faculty and ad
ministration as well —even more with
them, perhaps. I believe it is largely
within the power of the faculty to
make or break the Honor System
through their methods of class ad
ministration.
There are far too many instructors
in this University who are seemingly
oblivious of the fact that studentß
enrolled in their individual course are
taking three or four other courses
besides that one, and give out such
large assignments that the student is
positively unable to complete his
other work. He is forced to neglect
one of his courses because of the fact
lhat he simply has not the time to do
all that is expected of him. Then he
must face an examination in the
course he has been forced to neglect.
He enters the examination room
knowing nothing of the subject in
question. He must cheat or else flunk
the course. Which alternative will he
choose?
This is one way in which the fac
ulty has a strong bearing on the
working of the Honor Code. There
are several other ways.
The connection between Adminis
tration and Honor Code is a more
deep-rooted and abstract one, how

ever. Its source lies deep down in
custom, submerged by convention and
covered by conditions. Its workings
are obsolete, behind the times, anti
quated. I refer to the Lower Division
requirements.
I believe that just as long as a
student is required by the University
administration to take courses in
which he has absolutely no interest,
which are odious, and therefore use
less to him, which are often almost
impossible for him to assimilate —
just so long will the Honor Code be
a failure.
For some students the sciences,
such as biology or chemistry, are ex
tremely difficult and violently unin
teresting. Other sturents react similar
ly to the languages —they just can't
get them. These students practically
drive themselves to the study of such
subjects. Often they lose all will
power and give it up completely.
Then they must face examinations
in the subjects. What is there for
them to do but cheat? They've got to
or else stay in the Lower Division for
the remainder of their days. And so,
they cheat.
This is not to say that cheating is
not carried on by Upper Division stu
dents, as well. It is, undeniably; but
I doubt whether it is done to so
great an extent as in the first two
years.
There is no denying that our pres
ent Lower Division system is weak
and, in many cases, does not benefit
the student. Let us hope for the day
of the "liberal" college, when the
student will be able to concentrate
on the subjects which interest him
most, and not be forced to attempt to
stuff himself with a thousand-and-one
facts concerning things about which
he doesn't give a rap. When his
studies concern only things of inter
est to him it is hardly likely that he
will find it necessary to cheat in order
to pass his examinations. Then the
Honor Code should succeed!

subjects. Often they lose all will
power and give it up completely.
Then they must face examinations
in the subjects. What is there for
them to do but cheat? They've got to
or else stay in the Lower Division for
the remainder of their days. And so,
they cheat.
This is not to say that cheating is
not carried on by Upper Division stu
dents, as well. It is, undeniably; but
I doubt whether it is done to so
great an extent as in the first two
years.
There is no denying that our pres
ent Lower Division system is weak
and, in many cases, does not benefit
the student. Let us hope for the day
of the "liberal" college, when the
student will be able to concentrate
on the subjects which interest him
most, and not be forced to attempt to
stuff himself with a thousand-and-one
facts concerning things about which
he doesn't give a rap. When his
studies concern only things of inter
est to him it is hardly likely that he
will find it necessary to cheat in order
to pass his examinations. Then the
Honor Code should succeed!

The Editor, Sir:
Though Thursday's assembly can
not be said to have been productive
of any decisive results regarding the
Honor Code it nevertheless was of
value in that it stimulated thought
in the minds of many who previously
have been but little concerned with
the matter. For this reason, if for
no other, the assembly was of de
cided value.
In my own thoughts regarding the
matter there ts one fact of paramount
importance and this fact has been
touched upon but superficially—it
seems to have escaped attention.
That fact is that the success or fail
ure of the Honor System rests not
alone with the students of this Uni
versity, but with the faculty and ad
ministration as well —even more with
them, perhaps. I believe it is largely
within the power of the faculty to
make or break the Honor System
through their methods of class ad
ministration.
There are far too many instructors
in this University who are seemingly
oblivious of the fact that studentß
enrolled in their individual course are
taking three or four other courses
besides that one, and give out such
large assignments that the student is
positively unable to complete his
other work. He is forced to neglect
one of his courses because of the fact
lhat he simply has not the time to do
all that is expected of him. Then he
must face an examination in the
course he has been forced to neglect.
He enters the examination room
knowing nothing of the subject in
question. He must cheat or else flunk
the course. Which alternative will he
choose?
This is one way in which the fac
ulty has a strong bearing on the
working of the Honor Code. There
are several other ways.
The connection between Adminis
tration and Honor Code is a more
deep-rooted and abstract one, how

ever. Its source lies deep down in
custom, submerged by convention and
covered by conditions. Its workings
are obsolete, behind the times, anti
quated. I refer to the Lower Division
requirements.
I believe that just as long as a
student is required by the University
administration to take courses in
which he has absolutely no interest,
which are odious, and therefore use
less to him, which are often almost
impossible for him to assimilate —
just so long will the Honor Code be
a failure.
For some students the sciences,
such as biology or chemistry, are ex
tremely difficult and violently unin
teresting. Other sturents react similar
ly to the languages —they just can't
get them. These students practically
drive themselves to the study of such
subjects. Often they lose all will
