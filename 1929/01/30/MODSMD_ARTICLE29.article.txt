# DEFENSE BY A TRANSFER STUDENT OF THE HONOR CODE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A most startling and singular edi
torial appeared in yesterday's Campus
Opinion in which the writer ventures
to ascribe the present weakening of
the Honor System to the increasing
number of transfer students! That
any Stanford graduate could hazard
such a blind condemnation of the
transfer student, most clearly sug
gests the need of a delicate readjust
ment of our present, so-styled honor
able mode of conduct and thought.
The writer of that article states
that "when we keep out transfers and
let in only freshmen, only then can
we look for a true observance of the
lienor system." How is it in any de
gree logical to sweep aside the whole
order of transfer students upon the
contention of their inferiority to the
annual class of freshmen? Does prior
college training and experience count
for so little that the completely un
trained male import far outshines an
older student in honor, provided that
fellow student be a transfer? But
strangely just such twaddle has been
advanced as the final sweeping cause
of the stagnation of the honor spirit
at Stanford University!
It was further suggested in this
same, anonymous article, that the for
mer university training of the trans
fer student was not an asset, but had
actuallly weakened the student. To
use the exact words "many of these
transfers are from 'lounge lizard' col
leges and do not accept the honor
system with the spirit of a true Stan
ford man." If such has been the re

action of Mr. Blank, may I suggest
that he change his friends among the
transfer students rather than attack
the entire collective group! The coun
sel of Descartes was particularly
sound when he cautioned men to at
tempt to change their individual view
points rather than the world itself.
We may actually begin to wonder
at this stage, at what institution the
freshmen have been inculcated with
the spirit, so much at a premium. The
disparagement of other universities is
decidedly unwise. It is safe to say
that because Mr. Blank is nourishing
a grudge against some particular col
lege, and its transfer student, is no
reason for assailing the entire aggre
gate of transfers.
It is just such an attitude as ap
pears in the above quoted article that
denotes the need for a wholesale re
vision of the so-called honor code.
The defects of the honor system do
not lie with any particular group of
students, but exist in the dormant
morale of the entire student body.
A combined movement toward honor
able conduct in the preparation of
classwork can only flourish if based
tiopn the esprit du corps of the en
tire University. As the article of yes
terday well indicates, although unin
tentionally, a blind attack upon the
honor of transfer students is little
calculated to impress one with the
writer's logic, or honorable motives.
It is but one o£ numerous traces of
decline in our respect for the funda
mentals of the honor system.
