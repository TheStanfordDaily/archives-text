# IN WHICH THE MALIGNED TRANSFER IS DEFENDED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There are a few remarks I would
like to make about the article signed
—" '26," appearing in the Daily on
January 29. The writer expressed the
opinion that the "transfers" were re
sponsible for the failure of the Honor
Code. I would think him utterly a
fool had he not had his name with
held from publication. In that, at
least, he showed wisdom.
Mr. '26 evidently forgot that most
of the Bchools from which the "trans
fers" come, have the Honor System
in effect. In the school I transferred
from, the Honor System was a suc
cess. Similarly, it is probably a suc
cess in the other colleges that the
"transfers" attended before coining to

Stanford. Does it seem logical that
we should be responsible for the fail
ure of the Honor Code at Stanford
when most of us have attended col
leges where its merits were unques
tioned?
If Mr. '26 counts himself a real
Stanford Man, I sincerely believe he
is deceiving himself and, probably,
only himself. His is the type that laid
the rottenness in our rooting section
to outsiders. Too bad he didn't think
of the "transfers" then; it would have
sounded so much more convincing to
have laid the blame on them. Now,
he tries to blame the "transfers" for
the failure of the Honor Code. Let
him keep guessing; he may hit a
plausible alibi for his own type yet.
