# MR. EMERY RESPONDS TO MR. NORMAN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir: ,
f note, in your issue of January
22nd, Mr. Norman's reply to my letter
published in your columns.
Since writing that letter, I have had
the opportunity of reading Mr. Nor
man's full article, as originally pub
lished in the Stanford Daily.
His criticism that I became too
excited and personal may have had
some justification. His admiration of j
the spirit which prompted the letter
Is appreciated. The further statement
that there were misstatements in my
writing will bear looking into.

He infers quite correctly the reason
why the Norman article was thought
unfair, i.e., because it appeared just
after sorority pledging, when the
happiness of the sorority members j
and pledges, and the unhappiness of
those who did not join sororities, as :
Mr. Norman declares, demanded that j
a period of time be allowed to elapse j
before the issue of Mr. Norman's arti
cle be raised.
As to its being untrue, the article
was considered untrue from the
standpoint of giving what the writer
thought were not conclusions coincid- i

iug with fact, even though these con
clusions were formed from a sincere
point of view.
What is there about the Roble-Row
situation, as the original introducer
of the subject terms it, that seems to
need so much constructive thinking?
Do the sororities wish to hold a de
bate with themselves as to the rea
son for their existence? Do the girls
of Roble wish to have a general cam
pus discussion of their situation? The
letters from ltoble, as published in
your paper, would seem to be to the
contrary.
It is understood that Mr. Norman
did not write the Bullsession article j

for release to the San Francisco
press.
As to suspicious natures, is that
not, after all, merely a matter of rela
tivity?
I did not consider that the field of
pcrority welfare or of lioble welfare
was one for any but the properly con
stituted authorities, or those directly
' concerned, to delve into. If this idea
be true, both the gentleman and my
self are automatically excluded from
further concern in the cause celebre.
Please do not think that I hold any
personal animus agaiust Winston
Norman. Yours very truly,
Allen Emery.

As to suspicious natures, is that
not, after all, merely a matter of rela
tivity?
I did not consider that the field of
pcrority welfare or of lioble welfare
was one for any but the properly con
stituted authorities, or those directly
' concerned, to delve into. If this idea
be true, both the gentleman and my
self are automatically excluded from
further concern in the cause celebre.
Please do not think that I hold any
personal animus agaiust Winston

The Editor, Sir: ,
f note, in your issue of January
22nd, Mr. Norman's reply to my letter
published in your columns.
Since writing that letter, I have had
the opportunity of reading Mr. Nor
man's full article, as originally pub
lished in the Stanford Daily.
His criticism that I became too
excited and personal may have had
some justification. His admiration of j
the spirit which prompted the letter
Is appreciated. The further statement
that there were misstatements in my
writing will bear looking into.

He infers quite correctly the reason
why the Norman article was thought
unfair, i.e., because it appeared just
after sorority pledging, when the
happiness of the sorority members j
and pledges, and the unhappiness of
those who did not join sororities, as :
Mr. Norman declares, demanded that j
a period of time be allowed to elapse j
before the issue of Mr. Norman's arti
cle be raised.
As to its being untrue, the article
was considered untrue from the
standpoint of giving what the writer
thought were not conclusions coincid- i

iug with fact, even though these con
clusions were formed from a sincere
point of view.
What is there about the Roble-Row
situation, as the original introducer
of the subject terms it, that seems to
need so much constructive thinking?
Do the sororities wish to hold a de
bate with themselves as to the rea
son for their existence? Do the girls
of Roble wish to have a general cam
pus discussion of their situation? The
letters from ltoble, as published in
your paper, would seem to be to the
contrary.
It is understood that Mr. Norman
did not write the Bullsession article j

for release to the San Francisco
press.
