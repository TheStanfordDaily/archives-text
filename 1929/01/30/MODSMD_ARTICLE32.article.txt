The Founding of Western Civilization.
By George C. Sellery and A. C.
Krey. (New York: Harper &
Brothers. 1929.)
In this book a professor of history
in the University of Minnesota and
a dean in the University of Wiscon
sin have packed in less than 600 pages
about 1400 years of history. That is
not a new feat; it has been done
many times before in school text
books. The singular feature of "The
Founding of Western Civilization" is
that in writing of medieval history
the authors have kept an eye on the
present-day results of the events
which transpired between the end of
the fourth century and the year 1660.
In the editorial foreword, Dean Guy
Stanton Holt, who edits the Harper
Historical Series, of which this book
is a volume, says:
"Despite all our modernity, we be
tray our medieval origins; whatever
the New World may have added to
us, we are yet basically the heirs of
European peoples and the modified
jiroducts of European history. So
much of what seems essentially Euro
pean in this heritage took shape in
the ages covered by this volume that
the thoughtful student will have a
groAving sense that its pages are in
a real sense an introduction to Ameri
can history."
In many current histories, the ac
counts of medieval times are broken
up and shelved in sections, as poli
tics, religion, art, and social customs.
"The Founding of Western Civiliza
tion" attempts to show that the varied
aspects of this period are inevitably
parts of a whole. A broad picture is
pointed, bringing out the essential
.unity of medieval history.
But in so doing, the authors have
not neglected to furnish a vivid and
intimate picture of people and events.
They have included in their book
many of the interesting details which
they relate to their classes. An exam
ple of this attention to accurate de
tail is the personal description of
: Mohammed. One learns that "he was
very gentle, loved children, and
| hated the sight of blood. Evil odors

. were offensive to him, and he ab
. j liorred garlic and onions."
L | The book closes with this thought,
I pertinent particularly for us who live

west of the Rockies:
"The Mediterranean and the Baltic
were the important seas of Europe in
tiie Middle Ages. The Atlantic has
been the dominant ocean of the mod
ern epoch. Its western shores now
rival its eastern in world importance.
Is the Pacific about to take over
' oceanic ascendency? That question
| raises the problem of the effects of
the geographical discoveries upon the
nutive peoples of the outlying parts of
the earth. It is a problem which
thoughtful men of good will are now
considering with anxiety."
