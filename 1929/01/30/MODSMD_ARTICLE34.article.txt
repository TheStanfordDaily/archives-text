# FINAL BOUTS OF BOXING TOURNEY STAGED TONIGHT
## Twenty-Four Will Contest in Finals, Semi-Finals Of 1929 Tourney 
### 
The finals and semi-finals of Stan
ford's 1929 Novice Boxing Tourna
ment will take place tonight in the j
Pavilion at 7:30 o'clock, when ten,
Bemi-final and seven final bouts will
be fought by twenty-four contestants.
The tourney is staged each year
under the auspices of the Circle "S"
Society. The proceeds are used to
award medals for the winners in each
of the seven weight classifications, |
the balance going toward a minor
sports trophy case in the trophy
room. Admission tonight will be 25 (
c.cnts with student body cards and 50
cents for outsiders.
Two exhibition bouts will be boxed |
during the evening. Ed Dillon, varsity |
heavyweight, will mix with Myron
Schall, assistant boxing coach, in a .
three-round go; and John Hromadka j
will meet A1 Boerr, both lightweights
on the varsity team, in a similar bout, j
Drawings for the bouts will take j
place this morning and will be posted !
in Encina gym. Peter Flannigan, for- j
mer middleweight amateur champion j
of Australia, will referee tonight. Mort
Blackburn, former amateur heavy
weight champion of Wisconsin, and
Wells Goodenough of Palo Alto, will
judge. Fred Free will be head timer.
Harry B. Smith, sport editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle, will award
the medals to the new champions, j
There will be two semi-final bouts
in the welterweight class. Ted East
man. John Dawson, Frank Hopper, !
and Ira Jones will scrap it out for the
championship. All four of these men j
are clever boxers, especially Dawson j
and Jones, and some good boxing I
should result.
The featherweight championship
will lie between Art Black, Vance
Rogers, Carrol Sanborn, and Francis j
Gundry. Sanborn's clever boxing in 1
the preliminaries Monday afternoon
make him something of a favorite in j
this class.
Mark Overton, Phil Stockton, John
Doyle, and Ralph Malcolm will box
for the lightweight championship. Mai-j
colm's heavy slugging, which he
showed in his preliminary bout, will
be hard for the other lightweights to
get around. Overton will probably
prove his closest competitor.

A bout filled with real slugging
should result if Milt Cohen and Mar
shall Brown mix blows in the middle
weight class, and these two men will
probably win their way to the finals
unless they meet in the semi-finals.
They will box George Lawry and Jack
Barbour.
None of the potential light-heavy
weight novice champions have as yet
been seen in action. Three have en-!
tered in this class; these are John
Craig, Thad McNamara, and Nason
Hall.
Only two heavyweights will be seen '
in action tonight. Fred Voight, who is
turning out for the varsity squad, and
Gordon Gilbert will swap blows for
this championship.
Hugh Israel, Ben Anderson, and
Leonard Kullmann are the only three
bantamweights in the tournament.
Israel is known to combine speed
with hard-hitting, and is a slight fa
vorite to win the medal.
The seconds in tonight's bouts will
be John Hromadka, Ed Dillon, A1
Doerr, and Harry Burch.
