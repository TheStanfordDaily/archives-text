The second sorority on the campus

was Delta Delta Delta, which last j
| night donated $50 to the fund. Chi '
Omega led the sororities with a $60

' $1850, other contributions having
been made as follows: Hammer and j
Coffin, $100; Anonymous, $1000; Stan
for Studios, $125; El Cuadro, $50; j
Theta Xi, $50; Sequoia, $50; Branner, j
$75; Toyon, $800; Chi Omega, $60. j
This action of the sororities in sup- j
porting the Theatre Fund is con- !
sidered very encouraging by Dick '

Holt, business manager of Chaparral, i
Holt feels that the interest of both
men's and women's living groups in- 1
dicates a constructive interest in the j
project which should accelerate the j
plans for building the theatre.
