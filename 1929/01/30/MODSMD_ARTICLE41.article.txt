# SPORTS OF 1929
## Versatile Athletesâ€”No. 1 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
George Owen, who recently turned
"pro" to play with the Boston Bruins
Hockey Club, for a reported annual
I salary of $12,000, plus an $8,000 bojius
I for signing, is probably the greatest
! athlete who ever wore the crimson of
! Harvard on the battlefields of sport.
( George won nine H's during his three
i years of varsity competition as a stu-
I dent at Cambridge, three each in
football, hockey, and baseball, and
! he came close to being Harvard's best
| player of all-time in those three
I sports.
I George Owen was born in 1901 in
j Hamilton, Ontario, where his father
was a famous yacht designer, and,
like all Canadian youngsters, played
hockey almost as soon as he could
walk. At Harvard his skating and

stick work were so sensational that
I he was twice elected captain of the
| team, and he played the entire time
of all of Harvard's games during three
years. In baseball, as captain during
his senior year, he made one of the
most phenomenal "last appearances"
of any famous college athlete, as de
scribed in the accompanying drawing.
George claimed that he got no pleas
ure out of football, that he only
played the game as a duty to his
| alma mater, but he was just as good
| at it as at other sports. In the Yale
game of 1922, he ran sixty yards
through the entire Eli team, and
| scored the winning touchdown a mo
; ment larer.
i Quite a versatile chap, this Georgius
J Rex. "Ask the man who Owens one!"
