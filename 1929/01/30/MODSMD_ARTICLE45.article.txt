# Plan Student Yukon Trip Latter Part of Summer For Hunting Big Game
## 
### 
A party of Stanford men to hunt
big game in the Yukon territory the
latter part of this summer is being t
organized by Joseph W. Ferrebee.
Large numbers of moose, mountain
sheep and goats, caribou, and grizzly
! bear are found in the territory to be
hunted, while fish and smaller game
are also plentiful. Some heads ob-1
tained last summer may be seen j
among the decorations at the coming
Toyon dance.
An added attraction is the ocean
trip from Seattle to Skagway by
steamer through the scenic inland
pasage which is considered one of
j the world's most beautiful voyages.
Anyone interested in taking this
hunt, whether or not he has had pre-1
vious experience in hunting, should
! see Mr. Ferrebee at 747 Dolores at
| once.
