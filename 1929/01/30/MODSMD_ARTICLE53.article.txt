# Hoover's Inauguration To Be In Sound Film
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 29. (JP)â€”For
the first time in history the words
and movements of a president-elect
taking the oath of office are to be
recorded in sound picture.
When Herbert Hoover is inaugu
rated the ceremony will be graphi
cally recorded for future generations,
much as though the words and figure
of Abraham Lincoln, with one hand
upraised and the other on the Bible,
could be heard and seen today in
motion-talking pictures.
