SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 29. (/P)â€”
Nine army planes from Crissy Field
today subjected San Francisco to a
hypothetical air attack. The recent
arrival of a new Douglas 02-H makes
nine planes of the same type avail
able. Led by Captain Floyd N. Shu-
Itnacker, the group flew over the city
several hours in formations with ac
companying planes for photographic
purposes.
