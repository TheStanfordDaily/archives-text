# CARD VARSITY FACES STARS OF BAY NINE
## Combination of Major and Minor Leaguers Appear For Haberdashers 
### DON OSWILL 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
; will take on an extra heavy dose of
j competition this afternoon when they
meet the Lee Haberdashery nine from
Berkeley on the varsity diamond at
2:30. It would be well worth anyone's
time to drop out to the diamond and
see some famous stars in action. Hit
ters and fielders of championship
caliber will participate for the visit
ing outfit.
Either Cunningham of Boston, or
Miller of the House of David team,
I
will do the chucking for the visitors.
In case the latter pitches, he will
probably wear the flowing beard that
is characteristic of the cult of which
he is a member. Lombardi of Oak
land will catch. He was one of the
leading hitters of the Coast League
last year.
Infield Is Strong
Fenton of Oakland will play fir£t
! sack for the Haberdashery outfit, and
Connoly of Indianapolis at second is
expected to show some classy field
ing. Red Kress of the St. Louis
Browns is slated to start at shortstop.
This gentleman was a consistent
leader of the American League in hit
ting last season. To complete the in
field, Mellana of the Dallas team in
the Texas League will play third.
' A classy combination of major and
minor leaguers will play the outfield.
Chic Hafey and Larry Betteneourt of
the St. Louis Browns, Cronin of the
Mission Bells, Burke of Sacramento,
and Sunseri of Tulsa complete the
roster.
As it will take some high brand
pitching to offset these champion hit
ters, Coach Harry Wolter will use
four pitchers in today's contest. Tay
lor, Kern, Smalling, and Lewis will
all get a chance on the mound, each
throwing hard for a couple of innings,
llardy will catch for the Cards.
The same infield that finished
against the Granats will start today.
Cook at first, Churchill at second,
Johnson at short, and Laird at third,
play well together, and should show
I the pros some classy fielding. Wilton
and Hunken are sure to start in the
outfield, but one position has not yet
been assigned.
Visitors Are Considerate
To make the game more interesting,
the visitors have consented to pitch
I any man that Wolter shall name. This
! is very considerate of them, consider
ing that they have some of the best
hitters in organized baseball. If the
varsity can overcome the natural
stagefright at their first taste of big
, league pitching, the contest may be
! fairly close after all.

llardy will catch for the Cards.
The same infield that finished
against the Granats will start today.
Cook at first, Churchill at second,
Johnson at short, and Laird at third,
play well together, and should show
I the pros some classy fielding. Wilton
and Hunken are sure to start in the
outfield, but one position has not yet
been assigned.
Visitors Are Considerate
To make the game more interesting,
the visitors have consented to pitch
I any man that Wolter shall name. This
! is very considerate of them, consider
ing that they have some of the best
hitters in organized baseball. If the
varsity can overcome the natural
stagefright at their first taste of big
, league pitching, the contest may be
! fairly close after all.
Stanford's varsity baseball team
; will take on an extra heavy dose of
j competition this afternoon when they
meet the Lee Haberdashery nine from
Berkeley on the varsity diamond at
2:30. It would be well worth anyone's
time to drop out to the diamond and
see some famous stars in action. Hit
ters and fielders of championship
caliber will participate for the visit
ing outfit.
Either Cunningham of Boston, or
Miller of the House of David team,
I
will do the chucking for the visitors.
In case the latter pitches, he will
probably wear the flowing beard that
is characteristic of the cult of which
he is a member. Lombardi of Oak
land will catch. He was one of the
leading hitters of the Coast League
last year.
Infield Is Strong
Fenton of Oakland will play fir£t
! sack for the Haberdashery outfit, and
Connoly of Indianapolis at second is
expected to show some classy field
ing. Red Kress of the St. Louis
Browns is slated to start at shortstop.
This gentleman was a consistent
leader of the American League in hit
ting last season. To complete the in
field, Mellana of the Dallas team in
the Texas League will play third.
' A classy combination of major and
minor leaguers will play the outfield.
Chic Hafey and Larry Betteneourt of
the St. Louis Browns, Cronin of the
Mission Bells, Burke of Sacramento,
and Sunseri of Tulsa complete the
roster.
As it will take some high brand
pitching to offset these champion hit
ters, Coach Harry Wolter will use
four pitchers in today's contest. Tay
lor, Kern, Smalling, and Lewis will
all get a chance on the mound, each
throwing hard for a couple of innings,
llardy will catch for the Cards.
