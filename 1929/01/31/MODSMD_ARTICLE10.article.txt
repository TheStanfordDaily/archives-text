# FOURTEEN CARD CAGERS ENTRAIN FOR SOUTHLAND
## Stanford Quintet Will Have Hard Time Beating UCLA Even Though Baiter Is Out 
### 
By ANSON REEDER
Undaunted by their defeat at the
liands of the California basketball
I players, Coach Husky Hunt and his
fourteen Cardinal cagers will entrain
; tonight for Los Angeles where they
will clash with the U.C.L.A. Bruins in
a crucial two-game series.
Those making the trip are Coach
Husky Hunt, Manager Major Godsol,
forwards, Fawcett, Berg, Tyler, Sexon,
Lawry, Moffatt, Loomis; centers,
Mears, Hawkins, McCandless; guards,
J Captain Rothert, Reynolds, Tampcke,
1 Stewart.
Hard Games Ahead
If the Cards should make a clean
sweep on this Southern tour, they
â– I would have a record of four confer
j ence games won and only a single
loss chalked against them when they
I meet the Bears here on February 9
j for the second game of the "Big
j Series." But they will have no easy
time in Los Angeles despite the fact
that Captain Sammy Baiter, leader
and star guard of the Bruins, will be
watching the game from the sidelines.
Two men have been alternating in
Baiter's place, A1 Sunseri, a bespec
tacled young gentleman who is a
whizz on the floor but a little weak
011 basket-shooting, and "Lanky"
Lubin, a six-and-a-half-foot sophomore
who spends most of his time loafing
under the basket catching rebounds.
The latter proved to be plenty of
trouble to the California and Trojan
offenses especially on follow shots.
"Sammy" Good
When they miss their Sammy most
I is in his position as key man on the
j offense. He is fast, tricky, and an ex
j perienced player, capable of handling
his share of the work at both ends of
the court. So despite his absence the
Redshirts will have their hands full
keeping the Bruins from winning at
least one of the contests.
Practice this week has disclosed
a decided improvement in several
members of the squad who have had
a hard time finding themselves this
! season. These men are McCandless,
Mears, and Sexson, and all three may
see action in one or the other of the
| games down South.
To Use Reserves
Although the regular line-up will
| start the first game against the
Uclans, Coach Hunt plans to use a
good many of his reserves, if pos
sible, in order that the first five will
i be in shape for the tough week which
! will confront them on their return
j from Los Angeles.
On Tuesday the Cards will meet St.
j Ignatius, the only team in this vicinity
that has defeated the Bears so far
I this season, and on the following Sat
! urday they will meet the Bears in
I the second contest of the series.
