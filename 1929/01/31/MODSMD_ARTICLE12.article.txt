# WOMEN WILL HAVE LADY NICOTINE FOR CONSTANT SOLACE
## 
### 
Lady Nicotine scores again!
Stanford women are slowly but
surely widening their field of
smoking.
By an action of Women's Con
ference last night, the clause of
Women's Regulations in the
A.W.S. handbook stating that
women were urged not to smoke
"in public gatherings on the
campus, and in the vicinity of
University buildings" was struck
out with one "blow."
This means that Stanford's
five hundred can now smoke the
"filthy weed" in the Cellar, at
dances, and around the Univer
sity buildings. Whether or not
women will be allowed to smoke
in individual living groups is
still left to the decision of the
groups, and it is still recom
mended that women do not
smoke in Palo Alio or vicinity.
