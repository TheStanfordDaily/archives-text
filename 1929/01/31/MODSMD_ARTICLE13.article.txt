# Campus Leaders' Views Differ On Bonfire Question
## Cavalero, Rothert, and Wool Against Fire; Cushing, Sears Favor Blaze 
### 
Opinion among leaders in various
campus activities is divided on the
wisdom of discontinuing the Annual
Big Game Bonfire which is to be put
to a vote in the Quad election sched
uled for February 12, according to
responses received after questioning
on the part of a Daily reporter last
night.
Phil Cavalero, president of the as
sociated students, made the following
statement: "I favor the discontinu
ance of the Big Game bonfire. It
has become more of a spectacle for
the people on the Peninsula than a
true student rally. I believe that far
more desirable results could be ob
tained by directing part of the energy
that is expended on the bonfire to
ward some good student rallies. True
spirit does not have to be dragged
fgrth by a spectacle of this sort."
Rothert Doubtful
"Although I believe that the annual
Big Game bonfire does materially in
crease the enthusiasm of the student
body and the freshman class, there is
a doubt in my mind as to whether it
is worth the waste of time, materials,
and expense that necessarily attends
the construction of the fire. I think
we should seriously consider whether
the bonfire should be saved or not,"
was the opinion of Harlow Rothert,
captain of the basketball team.
Bob Sears, associate editor of the
Stanford "Lit," said: "The material
which goes into the bonfire is wasted
anyway and chltters up various places
on the Peninsula. The fire offers a
relief from the deadly grind of school
and I believe that it should be built
in two or three days by all students."
Favoring the discontinuance of the
fire, Fred Wool, chairman of the
Men's Council, stated: "I believe that
the fire is a useless tradition which
opens up opportunities for misconduct
and glorified shop-lifting which could
well be dispensed with."
Urge Smaller Fires
Maxiue Cusliing, secretary of the
A.W.S., believes "it seems pointless
co make the bonfire so large that en
thusiasm can't last." She would vote
to build smaller fires.
Merle Emry and Milton Silverman,
newly appointed associate editors of
the Daily, are agreed that the fire
should be retained.
"Although I am in favor of the re
tention of the bonfire as it adds to
the spirit of the school, I believe that
a modification should be made, limit
ing both the size of the fire and the
amount of time spent in its construc
tion. The time limit should not exceed
two or three days and all students
should assist," was the comment of
Emry.
"The opportunity for students to
get together which is offered by the
building of an all-University bonfire
should not be eliminated," said Sil
verman. "However, a strict limit on
time and the size of the fire should
be made before construction begins
and rigidly adhered to."

is worth the waste of time, materials,
and expense that necessarily attends
the construction of the fire. I think
we should seriously consider whether
the bonfire should be saved or not,"
was the opinion of Harlow Rothert,
captain of the basketball team.
Bob Sears, associate editor of the
Stanford "Lit," said: "The material
which goes into the bonfire is wasted
anyway and chltters up various places
on the Peninsula. The fire offers a
relief from the deadly grind of school
and I believe that it should be built
in two or three days by all students."
Favoring the discontinuance of the
fire, Fred Wool, chairman of the
Men's Council, stated: "I believe that
the fire is a useless tradition which
opens up opportunities for misconduct
and glorified shop-lifting which could
well be dispensed with."
Urge Smaller Fires
Maxiue Cusliing, secretary of the
A.W.S., believes "it seems pointless
co make the bonfire so large that en
thusiasm can't last." She would vote
to build smaller fires.
Merle Emry and Milton Silverman,
newly appointed associate editors of
the Daily, are agreed that the fire
should be retained.
"Although I am in favor of the re
tention of the bonfire as it adds to
the spirit of the school, I believe that
a modification should be made, limit
ing both the size of the fire and the
amount of time spent in its construc
tion. The time limit should not exceed
two or three days and all students
should assist," was the comment of
Emry.
"The opportunity for students to
get together which is offered by the
building of an all-University bonfire
should not be eliminated," said Sil
verman. "However, a strict limit on
time and the size of the fire should
be made before construction begins
and rigidly adhered to."
Opinion among leaders in various
campus activities is divided on the
wisdom of discontinuing the Annual
Big Game Bonfire which is to be put
to a vote in the Quad election sched
uled for February 12, according to
responses received after questioning
on the part of a Daily reporter last
night.
Phil Cavalero, president of the as
sociated students, made the following
statement: "I favor the discontinu
ance of the Big Game bonfire. It
has become more of a spectacle for
the people on the Peninsula than a
true student rally. I believe that far
more desirable results could be ob
tained by directing part of the energy
that is expended on the bonfire to
ward some good student rallies. True
spirit does not have to be dragged
fgrth by a spectacle of this sort."
Rothert Doubtful
"Although I believe that the annual
Big Game bonfire does materially in
crease the enthusiasm of the student
body and the freshman class, there is
a doubt in my mind as to whether it
is worth the waste of time, materials,
and expense that necessarily attends
the construction of the fire. I think
we should seriously consider whether
the bonfire should be saved or not,"
