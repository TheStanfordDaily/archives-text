# A. W. S. TO DISCUSS UNIFIED HOUSING IN ASSEMBLY MONDAY
## 
### 
A women's assembly to discuss the
possibility of permanent housing
which will permit the unification of
Stanford's five hundred will be held
Monday evening at 7 o'clock in Room
214, it was decided at a meeting of
Women's Conference last night. No
house meetings will be held Monday
evening.
The assembly is planned in answer
to a petition received by Janet Harris,
president of A.W.S., which read as
follows: "In accordance with Article
IX, Section 1, subsection (d) of the
A.W.S. Constitution, we, the under
signed women students of Stanford
University petition the President of
A.W.S. to call an assembly of all wo
men to formulate a request that the
University authorities supply as
promptly as possible permanent hous
ing in order to permit the unification
of Stanford's five hundred women."
Janet Harris stressed the fact that
the assembly would be to decide
whether or not University women de
sired centralized housing quarters,
and that the assembly would have
nothing to do with the idea of aboli
tion of sororities. Sororities would be
able to continue under the proposed
plans. The University building pro
gram provides for construction of a
quadrangle of small dormitories west
of Roble which, combined with this
first hall, would form a women's liv
ing unit capable of housing all of the
five hundred.
