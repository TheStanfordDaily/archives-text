# PETITION ASKING FOR NEW ROBLE GYM PRESENTED
## Request Counter to Petition Proposing Use of Funds For Dormitories 
### 
Proposing that University funds, in
stead of going to build dormitories
for women, be used to construct a
women's gymnasium, a petition signed
by fifty-five Stanford women was last
night submitted to Janet Harris, presi
dent of A.W.S. This petition, which
runs counter to the one published in
the Daily yesterday, is as follows:
"Whereas: We feel the building of
dormitories sufficient to house all Uni
versity women is unnecessary since
the Stanford Women are at present
adequately housed; and if the Uni
versity is willing to spend money to
improve the women's comfort, and
since the present women's gymna
sium is in a deplorable condition; we,
theu ndersigned women students of
Stanford University, in accordance
with Article IX, section 1, subsection
(d) of the Asscoiated Women Stu
dents' Constitution, do hereby peti
tion the president of the Associated
Women Students to call an Assembly
of all Stanford women students to
formulate a request that the Univer
sity authorities supply as promptly
as possible a new Women's Gymna
sium in accordance with the plans
which have been submitted thereto.
