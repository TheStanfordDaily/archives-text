In reference to the headline on the .
story in Tuesday's Daily telling of j
Pan-Hellenic's waiving a vote on the ;
abolition of sororities, the member
from Alpha Omicron Pi declared yes
terday that the phrase "One in Favor j
of Individual Vote" was erroneously ;
applied. Alpha Omicron Pi voted
against the motion not to meet the j
problem of the abolition of sororities j
for the reason that it believed passing
it would simply open the way for the j
Administration to step in to settle
the affair. The negative vote was by
no means cast with the intention of
implying a favorable attitude toward I
an individual vote. The story correct
ly interpreted the negative vote; the
headline alone was misleading.
