bert.
The Novice tournament is spon
sored each year by the Circle "S"
Society, the proceeds to be used for
the purchase of a minor sports trophy
case for the trophy room.
Middleweight Best Fight
The best fight of the evening was
the one between Marshall Brown and
Milt Cohen in the finals of the mid
dleweight class. Brown was probably
the hardest hitter of the evening, tak
ing full advantage of every pound of
weight he had. Cohen was the shif
tier of the two, and was an aggres
sive, hard hitter. The bout turned out
to be a contest as to which could
stand the most punishment, and
Brown succeeded in landing a few
more blows than Cohen.
Ralph Malcolm won the lightweight
championship from Mark Overton
when Overton caught a hay-maker on
the chin and went to the floor. The
referee awarded Malcolm a technical
knockout. The bout had been a real
slugfest up to this time, with Overton
using his left with devastating effect
and dancing out of reach except when
the winner rushed him.
Eastman Stages Burprise
Ted Eastman defeated John Daw
son to win the welterweight cham
pionship on a close decision that
case as a complete surprise to the
spectators, who thought that Dawson
had the best of it by a rather wide
margin. Eastman landed some hard
lefts to the head, but Dawson usually
retaliated with a left-right in one-two
order.
Vance Rogers' advantage in extra
reach enabled him to win the cham
pionship in the featherweight division
by defeating Carrol Sanborn, who
proved himself a game and scrappy
fighter, but found himself met by a
hard left when he attempted to get
within hitting distance.
Gordon Gilbert pulled something of
a surprise when he defated Fred
Voight in the heavyweight class. Gil
bert lived up to his nickname of
"Slip,"'dodging the slower Voight's
blows and slipping in hard hits on his
own account.
Jack Craig used his left to good ad
vantage to defeat Nason Hall for the
light-heavyweight championship. Craig
had something of an advantage in
extra reach. Hall staged a comeback
in the third round and landed several
good blows to the head.
Israel Takes Bantamweight
Hugh Israel was too shifty 011 his
feet and too hard a hitter for Leon
ard Kullman, the former winning the
bantamweight championship. Kull
mann put up a scrappy fight, but was
no match for Israel.
Several good fights were seen in
the semi-finals of the tournament, es
pecially in the lightweight class. Mark
Overton shot his left in an out with
telling effect to defeat John Doyle,
and Ralph Malcolm was awarded a
technical knockout when a hard right
to the face left Phil Stockton too
groggy to continue the fight. Stock
ton showed himself a heady fighter,
having a slight edge during the first
round. *
The bout between Ted Eastman
and Ira Jones, in the welterweight
division, proved exciting when Jones
rushed Eastman with both hands hit
ting and hitting hard. Once having
weathered the storm of the first
round, Eastman used his longer reach
to good advantage and won the buut.
In the featherweight classification
Sanborn defeated Art Black and
Vance Rogers defeated Francis Gun
dry. Sanborn's speed and shiftiness
gave him a real advantage, and
Rogers' aggressiveness kept Gundry
011 the defensive most of the time.
Milt Cohen was too heavy a hitter
tor George Lawry, in the middle
weight class; Cohen won 011 a tech
nical knockout at the end of the sec

ond round; in the other middleweight!
semi-finals Marshall Brown had little
trouble defeating Jack Harbour. Jack
Craig won from Thad McNaraara in
a close decision in the light-heavy
weight class. McNamara loosened up
a bit in the third round.
Hugh Israel showed some clever
boxing to defeat Ben Anderson in the
semi-finals of the bantamweight class.
Anderson landed some effective blows j
in the third round.
The bouts in the semi-finals were
three rounds of a minute and a half
each, while in the finals the bouts
were two minutes long. George Daw
son of Los Angeles and Fred Frehe
of Palo Alto were timekeepers. Peter
Flannigan, former middleweight ama
teur champion of Australia, refereed
the bouts. The judges were Mort
Blackburn, former amateur heavy
weight champion of Wisconsin, and
Wells Goodenougli of Palo Alto.
A1 Doerr and John Hromadka, var- !
sity lightweigths, boxed three rounds ,
a3 an exhibition, and Ed Dillon, var-'
sity heavyweight, showed his wares '
with Myron Schall, assistant boxing
coach.

So many new words have been
coined that thirty pages in the new
Oxford dictionary are needed to re
cord those starting in "A" alone.
