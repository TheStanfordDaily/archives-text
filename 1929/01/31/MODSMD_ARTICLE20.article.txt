bert.
The Novice tournament is spon
sored each year by the Circle "S"
Society, the proceeds to be used for
the purchase of a minor sports trophy
case for the trophy room.
Middleweight Best Fight
The best fight of the evening was
the one between Marshall Brown and
Milt Cohen in the finals of the mid
dleweight class. Brown was probably
the hardest hitter of the evening, tak
ing full advantage of every pound of
weight he had. Cohen was the shif
tier of the two, and was an aggres
sive, hard hitter. The bout turned out
to be a contest as to which could
stand the most punishment, and
Brown succeeded in landing a few
more blows than Cohen.
Ralph Malcolm won the lightweight
championship from Mark Overton
when Overton caught a hay-maker on
the chin and went to the floor. The
referee awarded Malcolm a technical
knockout. The bout had been a real
slugfest up to this time, with Overton
using his left with devastating effect
and dancing out of reach except when
the winner rushed him.
Eastman Stages Burprise
Ted Eastman defeated John Daw
son to win the welterweight cham
pionship on a close decision that
case as a complete surprise to the
spectators, who thought that Dawson
had the best of it by a rather wide
margin. Eastman landed some hard
lefts to the head, but Dawson usually
retaliated with a left-right in one-two
order.
Vance Rogers' advantage in extra
reach enabled him to win the cham
pionship in the featherweight division
by defeating Carrol Sanborn, who
proved himself a game and scrappy
fighter, but found himself met by a
hard left when he attempted to get
within hitting distance.
Gordon Gilbert pulled something of
a surprise when he defated Fred
Voight in the heavyweight class. Gil
bert lived up to his nickname of
"Slip,"'dodging the slower Voight's
blows and slipping in hard hits on his
own account.
Jack Craig used his left to good ad
vantage to defeat Nason Hall for the
light-heavyweight championship. Craig
