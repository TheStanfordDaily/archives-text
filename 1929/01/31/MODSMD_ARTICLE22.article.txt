# Students Ought To Vote "Yes" Or "No" On The Bonfire, According As They Would Be Willing To Work
## 
### 
The Executive Committee has done a courageous and at the same
time democratic tiling in putting the question of the Big Game bonfire
discontinuance (which is admittedly a euphemism for "abolition,"
thought to be a dangerous word in these iconoclastic times) to a general
student body vote. Last quarter the Daily expressed itself in favor of
a referendum on the bonfire and it is glad to see that this will he held.
The one thing chiefly to be hoped for is that students wilt vote
according to their honest opinions, leaving out that sort of sentiment
which is only strong enough to cause them to shed crocodile tears, but
not to bring them out to build the fire.
What we have said before on the subject of the bonfire, we shall say
again, as follows:
The Daily's opinion is that the bonfire has outgrown its period
of usefulness. In the heyday of Stanford bonfires, when everyone
took a deep dislike for the University of California along about the
third week in November, and when something gigantic like an 80-
foot pyre was needed to arouse interest in what it was hoped the
varsity would do, there was good cause to ask, nay demand, that
freshmen devote fifteen or twenty hours to building and guarding
bonfires. But now changed circumstances argue the need for abol
ishing this ancient institution:
| The Lower Division is to be steadily reduced; so that the work
of construction will become an increasingly great burden upon
each freshman.
2 No longer is there need of igniting many cubic yards of good
wood to inflame interest in a game which receives such universal
attention. We believe that time and talent would be better spent in
organizing good rally programs than in heaping up railroad ties
and packing boxes.
The attitude of the student body at large is such that it would be
fairly impossible to get the services of all students in building a
great, official A.S.S.U. Bonfire.
Many prate endlessly about Stanford spirit fostered by a bonfire.
In the years when the pyre escapes premature combustion, the sopho
mores and upperclassmen stroll out to watch the flames lick up
the California coffin, then stroll home again. No hearty interest is
shown. In the years when the whole student body has to turn out at
the last minute and build the fire, everyone is so tired by the time
the thing burns that he refuses to shout evangelically for team,
coach and college.
Couldn't we get just as much enthusiasm for the Great Athletic Orgy
by going to a good rally, at which we might see a "wow" program, such
as that which was presented at the Washington game rally in 1926, when
Boom Drumm appeared? Are there not enough events of Big Game
week to boost our spirits without asking a few to toil for weeks in
drudgery? The Big Game would assume a large enough place in our
lives even with the pyrotechnics eliminated.
As 'tis, we are but bunglers in this pyre-building business. As long
ago as 323 B. C., Alexander the Great burned a stack 200 feet high to
celebrate the funeral of his lieutenant, Hephaestion. And there weren't
even railroad ties then.

by going to a good rally, at which we might see a "wow" program, such
as that which was presented at the Washington game rally in 1926, when
Boom Drumm appeared? Are there not enough events of Big Game
week to boost our spirits without asking a few to toil for weeks in
drudgery? The Big Game would assume a large enough place in our
lives even with the pyrotechnics eliminated.
As 'tis, we are but bunglers in this pyre-building business. As long
ago as 323 B. C., Alexander the Great burned a stack 200 feet high to
celebrate the funeral of his lieutenant, Hephaestion. And there weren't
even railroad ties then.
The Executive Committee has done a courageous and at the same
time democratic tiling in putting the question of the Big Game bonfire
discontinuance (which is admittedly a euphemism for "abolition,"
thought to be a dangerous word in these iconoclastic times) to a general
student body vote. Last quarter the Daily expressed itself in favor of
a referendum on the bonfire and it is glad to see that this will he held.
The one thing chiefly to be hoped for is that students wilt vote
according to their honest opinions, leaving out that sort of sentiment
which is only strong enough to cause them to shed crocodile tears, but
not to bring them out to build the fire.
What we have said before on the subject of the bonfire, we shall say
again, as follows:
The Daily's opinion is that the bonfire has outgrown its period
of usefulness. In the heyday of Stanford bonfires, when everyone
took a deep dislike for the University of California along about the
third week in November, and when something gigantic like an 80-
foot pyre was needed to arouse interest in what it was hoped the
varsity would do, there was good cause to ask, nay demand, that
freshmen devote fifteen or twenty hours to building and guarding
bonfires. But now changed circumstances argue the need for abol
ishing this ancient institution:
| The Lower Division is to be steadily reduced; so that the work
of construction will become an increasingly great burden upon
each freshman.
2 No longer is there need of igniting many cubic yards of good
wood to inflame interest in a game which receives such universal
attention. We believe that time and talent would be better spent in
organizing good rally programs than in heaping up railroad ties
and packing boxes.
The attitude of the student body at large is such that it would be
fairly impossible to get the services of all students in building a
great, official A.S.S.U. Bonfire.
Many prate endlessly about Stanford spirit fostered by a bonfire.
In the years when the pyre escapes premature combustion, the sopho
mores and upperclassmen stroll out to watch the flames lick up
the California coffin, then stroll home again. No hearty interest is
shown. In the years when the whole student body has to turn out at
the last minute and build the fire, everyone is so tired by the time
the thing burns that he refuses to shout evangelically for team,
coach and college.
Couldn't we get just as much enthusiasm for the Great Athletic Orgy
by going to a good rally, at which we might see a "wow" program, such
as that which was presented at the Washington game rally in 1926, when
Boom Drumm appeared? Are there not enough events of Big Game
