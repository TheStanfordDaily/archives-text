Here are a few facts to illuminate the argument over the question
whether or not transfers are responsible for the breakdown of the
Honor Code:
Out of thirty-three Honor Code violations during the past five years,
twenty-five have been committed by "native Stanford students" and
eight by transfer students.
This information comes from the Registrar's Office. In an effort to
get facts relating to the proportion of Honor Code violations by "native"
students (those who have taken all their college work at Stanford) and
transfers (students who have been enrolled in some other college or
university for at least one year) compilations over a period of five years
were made. Statistics show that approximately 57 per cent of the stu
dent body during the last three years has been composed of transfer
students, forty-three per cent being the "native" population.
Considering the relative percentages, the expectation of violations by
transfer students, if transfer and "native" Stanford students were equally
honest, would be eighteen in number. The Registrar's report proves that
only eight violations were made by transfers.
The following is a tabulation of violations by "transfers" and "na
tives" during five years:
Year "Native" (43%) Transfers (57%)
Ist 6 0

Total 25 • 8
One "native" student violated the Honor Code twice, once during his
freshman year and once during his junior year.
The significance of the report is that 75 per cent of the infractions
of the Code have been by "native" Stanfordites, who comprise but 43
per cent of the student body; whilst 25 per cent have been committed by
transfers, who comprise 57 per cent of the student body.
