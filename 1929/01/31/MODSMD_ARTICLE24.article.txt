# Campus Opinion
## WHAT A JOLLY LETTER! 
### 
i The Editor, Sir:
One of the five hundred appears to
he of the opinion that men should not
criticize the purchritude of the campus
babies for the profound reason that
most of the males themselves would
be better doubles for Lon Chaney than
j for Ramon Navarro. This argument
would give even a moron a tummy
ache. In short, it is to say that women
i should not criticize football games
; because they could hardly beat Pop
Warner's seventh team.
Beauty with women is a business j
With men it is as important as the |
ability to translate Bringing Up
Father into Greek. May I remind the
lady whose notions I here refute that
he-dolls, from Paris to Valentino,
made enough trouble in their earthly ]
sojourn to give Hon. Mr. Kellogg a j
temperature of 104 plus acute indi
gestion,
Surely a woman who commands the
grades to enter Stanford does not go
Farming for the purpose of amourous
interludes. Or if she does except in
possibly one case out of every ninety
nine, she is precisely nothing but an
intelligent damn fool.
I allow that the Stanford co-eds !
wax indignant when the men, for
campus dates, especially, import such !
notables as madamoiselles from j
Mills, blososm-time cuties from the
Mills, blossom-time cuties from the '
comedies, social secretaries to oil 1
company presidents and Fancho and '
Marco booters. However, for Roble j
and Row women to wail about the
situation is only to confess complete j
defeat.
To crab and propose no remedy is
ill-logical. So her egoes. I suggest ■
that the odd two hundred of the half
thousand who might be presentable 1
after some research by Patou, extra- |
vagances from Tiffany, odors by Coty, ;

i minute artistic touches of setting by
Joseph Urban, submerges by La Ru
benstein, personality flavorings by
Italian vermouth, and general recon
ditioning by the female editor of the
; MacFadden Magazines ... go easier
•on the books and do a right-about
; face toward the horizon of beauty
| culture. Then let them hock all their
ritzy chocomotives by Fisher, Fleet
wood, and Murray and supplement
this fund by their personal bank roll
' to invest in a Parisian cabaret in the
! vicinity whose hostesses they shall
; be. Exclusively, if they choose, for
Stanford men. Slide a little Green
j wich Village atmosphere into the
; rendezvous from twilight on. There
one could immediately forget the sad
mementos of the classrooms. Aes
i thetic dancing by the Stanford female
entertainers would displace the
hoochie-coochie splashings by third
rate Broadway revues one usually
meets in the Coast night clubs. Serve
ginger ale cold without synthetic ice.
Have corked tipped cigarets in abun
dance. Let the collegiana from the
Farm prowl here on Wednesday and
| week-end nights. Permit Cactus Gar
| dens to fade into the past of high
school escapades. Make love an art.
And be artful in love.
What's the sense of all this moonlit
madness? Simply this . . . the women
will prove they have something be
( sides straight "A's" and the direct re
' suit of oil stock dividends.
I realize that Roble and the Row
will think as kindly of this plan as
Lindbergh thinks of anti-aircraft
guns. Howbeit, I moo contentedly as
a cow looking for a milkmaid. The
present situation continues until
remedied. And so far no one has ad
vanced any other way to fix it.
My best personal regards to the
five hundred. —Martin Frankel.

i The Editor, Sir:
One of the five hundred appears to
he of the opinion that men should not
criticize the purchritude of the campus
babies for the profound reason that
most of the males themselves would
be better doubles for Lon Chaney than
j for Ramon Navarro. This argument
would give even a moron a tummy
ache. In short, it is to say that women
i should not criticize football games
; because they could hardly beat Pop
Warner's seventh team.
Beauty with women is a business j
With men it is as important as the |
ability to translate Bringing Up
Father into Greek. May I remind the
lady whose notions I here refute that
he-dolls, from Paris to Valentino,
made enough trouble in their earthly ]
sojourn to give Hon. Mr. Kellogg a j
temperature of 104 plus acute indi
gestion,
Surely a woman who commands the
grades to enter Stanford does not go
Farming for the purpose of amourous
interludes. Or if she does except in
possibly one case out of every ninety
nine, she is precisely nothing but an
intelligent damn fool.
I allow that the Stanford co-eds !
wax indignant when the men, for
campus dates, especially, import such !
notables as madamoiselles from j
Mills, blososm-time cuties from the
Mills, blossom-time cuties from the '
comedies, social secretaries to oil 1
company presidents and Fancho and '
Marco booters. However, for Roble j
and Row women to wail about the
situation is only to confess complete j
defeat.
To crab and propose no remedy is
ill-logical. So her egoes. I suggest ■
that the odd two hundred of the half
thousand who might be presentable 1
after some research by Patou, extra- |
vagances from Tiffany, odors by Coty, ;

i minute artistic touches of setting by
Joseph Urban, submerges by La Ru
benstein, personality flavorings by
Italian vermouth, and general recon
ditioning by the female editor of the
; MacFadden Magazines ... go easier

; be. Exclusively, if they choose, for
Stanford men. Slide a little Green
j wich Village atmosphere into the
