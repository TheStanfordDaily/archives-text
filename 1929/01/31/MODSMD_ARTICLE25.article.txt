# TRANSFER KEEPS OUT OF MISCHIEF WELL ENOUGH

The Editor, Sir: <
Does Mr. '26 indulge himself in the ]
manifestly absurd opinion that honor i
and honesty are virtues peculiar to j
the four-year Stanford student? Girls j
and boys are made into ladies and
gentlemen not only by the colleges j
they attend, but also —strange as it !
may seem to Mr. '26 —by their early i
home training. If a student is morally
rotten four, or even seven, years at 1
Stanford won't make an honest man
of him. If he is morally sound even j
the "luonge-lizard" college will not
debase him. Mr. '26 could have most j
probably retained and flaunted his j
virtue through all these years at an- j
other institution.
I transferred from a Junior College, |
an institution which also has an
honor system. For Mr. '26's informa
tion, that honor system worked as
well as the one we have here, and
covered more ground.

i When I registered here for the first
J time, did Mr. '26 or some of his
friends attempt to educate me, the
' lowly transfer, or instill in me the
holy principles of the Stanford Honor
Sj r stem? They did not!, Not even a
| Frosh handbook did I get. I had heard
! of the Stanford Honor System before,
however, and by applying my Junior
i College system, and my own (per
verted, Mr. '26?) sense of honor, I
i have lasted four quarters without lay
j ing myself open to charges of "A Cer
tain Student," etc.
If Mr. '26 would stop calling us
| dirty names and do a little construc
j tive work, the transfers might not be
' the moral liability he thinks them to
be. On registration day there is a
window marked "New Students."

' lowly transfer, or instill in me the
holy principles of the Stanford Honor
Sj r stem? They did not!, Not even a
| Frosh handbook did I get. I had heard
! of the Stanford Honor System before,
however, and by applying my Junior
i College system, and my own (per
verted, Mr. '26?) sense of honor, I
i have lasted four quarters without lay
j ing myself open to charges of "A Cer
tain Student," etc.
If Mr. '26 would stop calling us
| dirty names and do a little construc
j tive work, the transfers might not be
' the moral liability he thinks them to
be. On registration day there is a
window marked "New Students."
Sincerely,
Charles Browne, Jr.,
