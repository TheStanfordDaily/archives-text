# THE 						COURSE AND BOUNDARIES OF HONOR ARE WELL DEFINED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Honor is straight and narrow, and
its boundaries are well defined. In the j
mind of the honor student there is j
absolutely no question regarding the j
boundaries of honor. The limits of j
honor do not fade off into some ob
scure, confusing argument; they are •
sharp and definite. A cheater is of
low character. He has no moral liber. >
He is useless and worthless to the .
students. If left alone he will poison j
their characters with his degeneracy, i
and ultimately with his band will be- j
come stronger than they. In the name |
of justice there can be no leniency
in dealing with the cheater. He must
be severely dealt with. In the cases
of the people versus the criminal, are ,
they concerned with the fate of the
criminal, or the dishonor brought j

upon his family so long as justice is
delivered? Honor works on severe
laws. To maintain it these laws must
i be obeyed. A cheater cannot be re
-1 formed by coaxing. He must have the
! whip used on him. If he is forced into
the routine of honor, it might become
a habit with him. Talk of changing
the courses, the examinations, and
! even the name of that honorable cus- I
: torn does not sound like a very noble
society. Those who talk this way, be
| ware lest you be accused of uphold-
S ing a creed different from that of
I honor. This way of talking is wliin
i ing, crying at the real issue. We are
j citizens of Stanford University, and
; we must keep the family clean. The
honor system can be made to enforce |
i itself only by cleaning out all of the
cheaters, exposing them, and expel
j ling them indefinitely. —'29.
