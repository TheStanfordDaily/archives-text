# OUR PRAYER, TOO
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have been reading the various
articles which have been published in
•
"Campus Opinion" of late concerning j
Roble and the Row, the heart-broken !
members of the 500 who were not [
bid, etc., etc. Every morning since
the sixteenth of January, when the j
bidding took place, I have looked into
the aforementioned column; and,
every morning I have found articles
upon these subjects.
I see no reason why this discussion
needs to continue. The sororities are ,

jliere; and, as far as all indications
go, they will be here for quite some
time, regardless of all that anyone
! has to say. The power of the alumni
| from the Row is too great for any j
I move toward the abolishment of
j sororities to be successful.
| As for the possessors of broken
I hearts, if there be such, argumenta- ,
j tion and discussion will only serve to
i augment their sorrow.
Let us, therefore, refrain from fur
ther comment along the lines of Roble
I and the Row.
