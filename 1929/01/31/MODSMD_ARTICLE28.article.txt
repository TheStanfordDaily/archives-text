The Editor, Sir:
Well, now Isn't this the cutest dis
cussion concerning the relative physi
ognomy of the campus men and wo
men? Reminiscent of lovely High
School debates and things! The de
nunciation of the Stanford men by
one oL our Five Hundred smacks pe
culiarly of the things we used to say
when we argued over marbles. "Well,
if I'm a 'wet smack' you're a 'pip
squeak'—and your relatives are no
roses either," is the context of the
discussion.
In the first place it must be admit
ted that the man who made the state
ment that Stanford Women (God
Bless 'Em) are not "social assets"

was not only all wet but would have i
been unnecessarily brutal even had
he been correct. And in the second i
place the woman with the flashy
J comeback added little to her cause |
j for this reason. By some queer and
! unfortunate decision of fate it has so
I evolved that while a woman must
! ever strive to make herself physically ,
presentable in order to keep her place |
in society, the survival of men in con-.
tact with others is dependent to a
large extent upon the presence or ab
sence of gray matter (witness the
uniformity of dress in men as com
pared to the individuality in that of
women); and although this concept
is slowly being weakened by the ele- j

ment of thought which has been try-'
ing to creep into the world since the
partial emancipation of women, we
still have it to face. Therefore a slap,
no matter how justly deserved, at the
appearance of the men about the cam
pus, is entirely irrelevant to the ques
tion. Personally, I see no reason for
either the men or the women, what
ever their opinion, to do any more
nose-thumbing. The men who want
intellect and personality can get it
right here at Stanford (and some of
the fortunate may rate the good-look
ing ones.) While the men who like
I heir beauty unadulterated with
brains can go to some of the other
universities in the immediate vicinity
where I understand it is on tap at a
premium. Finally, the women never
had any trouble getting dates ("such
as they are," they may shout) and the
Phi-Betes will stay home anyway. All
things being equal I see no reason
why everyone shouldn't be happy and
Dumbarton Bridge filled to overflow
ing. Respectfully,
A Pipsqueak. j

cussion concerning the relative physi
ognomy of the campus men and wo
men? Reminiscent of lovely High
School debates and things! The de
nunciation of the Stanford men by
one oL our Five Hundred smacks pe
culiarly of the things we used to say
when we argued over marbles. "Well,
if I'm a 'wet smack' you're a 'pip
squeak'—and your relatives are no
roses either," is the context of the
discussion.
In the first place it must be admit
ted that the man who made the state
ment that Stanford Women (God
Bless 'Em) are not "social assets"

was not only all wet but would have i
been unnecessarily brutal even had
he been correct. And in the second i
place the woman with the flashy
J comeback added little to her cause |
j for this reason. By some queer and
! unfortunate decision of fate it has so
I evolved that while a woman must
! ever strive to make herself physically ,
presentable in order to keep her place |
in society, the survival of men in con-.
tact with others is dependent to a
large extent upon the presence or ab
sence of gray matter (witness the
uniformity of dress in men as com
pared to the individuality in that of
women); and although this concept
is slowly being weakened by the ele- j

ment of thought which has been try-'
ing to creep into the world since the
partial emancipation of women, we
still have it to face. Therefore a slap,
no matter how justly deserved, at the
appearance of the men about the cam
pus, is entirely irrelevant to the ques
tion. Personally, I see no reason for
either the men or the women, what
ever their opinion, to do any more
nose-thumbing. The men who want
intellect and personality can get it
right here at Stanford (and some of
the fortunate may rate the good-look
ing ones.) While the men who like
I heir beauty unadulterated with
brains can go to some of the other
universities in the immediate vicinity
where I understand it is on tap at a
premium. Finally, the women never
had any trouble getting dates ("such
as they are," they may shout) and the
Phi-Betes will stay home anyway. All
things being equal I see no reason
why everyone shouldn't be happy and
Dumbarton Bridge filled to overflow
ing. Respectfully,
