! "Courage"—Alcazar
Excellent comedy of American fam- ;
i ily life with a perfect cast. It con
cerns an ambitious and loving mother
, who is determined that her seven
children shall have every opportunity
to become great successes in life. Her
efforts to give her family the best
cultural advantages have resulted in
! financial troubles, but through all the
( complications that ensue she remains
I the same splendid character.
The very cast of "Courage" is un
usual, for it includes but three other
i people besides the mother and the
j children. The action takes place in
I Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the
Colonial house that Mary Colebrook
has leased for her family. There is a
clever little prologue.
Much contrast is made between the
, proud mother and her hard-hearted
sister-in-law who tries to break up
| the family for which Mary Colebrook
! has sacrificed her personal happiness.
Everything about the play savors
of reality—the situations and the
lines are genuine. Emma Dunn is
splendid as the mother —by the end
of the first act the audience is com
pletely under the spell of her lovable
personality. Edwin Mills, a youngster
of eight or nine, plays one of the
leading roles and is excellent as "my
son Willum,',' the most loyal of all
the children.
The rest of the cast is worthy of
much praise, too. Each member is
exactly suited for his role. Flora
.Bramley, Wampus Baby Star of 1928,
does good work as the oldest daugh
ter, and Joseph De Stefani is impres- j
sive in a relatively small role.
"Courage" is an inspiring play, a ,
clean play, a riotously funny play. It
is a show you cannot help enjoying
hugely. —Ben Maddox.
