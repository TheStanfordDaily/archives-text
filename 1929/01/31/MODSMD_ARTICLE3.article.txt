# SEATS FOR BARRIE COMEDY TO GO ON SALE AT 1 O'CLOCK
## 
### S. W 
Seats for Barrie's subtle comedy,
! "What Every Woman Knows," will go
!on sale at 1 o'clock today in front
!of the Women's Clubhouse. The
1 Masquers' play will be given a week
! from tomorrow night by an excep
j tionally good cast and will open the
I dramatic season of Winter quarter.
Gordon Davis picked a timely vehi
cle for a lively campus subject when
he selected "What Every Woman
j Knows" for production. The Univer
; sity intelligentsia which has been
delving into the woman problem since
j the "broken hearts of Roble" were re
| voaled, will now have an opportunity
jto actually discover "What Every
Woman Knows." At least, those mem
bers of the campus who have been
i extraordinarily disturbed over the
woman question can find out what
! Barrie thinks is the secret of femi-
I . .
| nimity.
Play Is Subtle
The Barrie play is one of charm
! and subtlety. The whimsical quality
of the lines and the situations them
; selves make the play delightfully
1 amusing. When Maggie Shand says
to her husband: "Romance, John, all's
told and gray without it; those that
; have had it have dipped in and out
| of heaven," the delicacy of the per
| coptions is seen. Barrie has etched
his characters and his play in silver.
Davis has been particularly fortu
! nate in getting a cast well-adapted to
| the play. Katherine Keho made her
campus debut last quarter in "The
; Haunted House" and from her work
j in rehearsals promises to give one of
! the finest pieces of work seen on the
i Stanford stage for some months. The
: part of Maggie is difficult as she is
| required to be extremely practical
and extremely romantic at the same
1 time. Miss Keho puts an understand
j ing into her role, and a charm in the
charming parts of Maggie's person
! ality.

Promises to Marry

Jack McDowell will make his initial
; appearance as John Shand, the poor
! Scotch student who cares so much
' for education that he is willing to
promise to marry Maggie for 300
pounds. Shand's part requires confi
l dence in his own ability and an in
! sensibility in the finesse of diplomacy
which Maggie valiantly covers up.
Herbert Wenig, Arthur Hurt, and
Lionel Walford as the two brothers
and the father, show promise in their
| interpretations. Louise Buxton is giv
! ing her countess role a spirited char
i acterization. Helen Ward plays the
! young society lady of the 1908 day.

Play Is Subtle
The Barrie play is one of charm
! and subtlety. The whimsical quality
of the lines and the situations them
; selves make the play delightfully
1 amusing. When Maggie Shand says
to her husband: "Romance, John, all's
told and gray without it; those that
; have had it have dipped in and out
| of heaven," the delicacy of the per
| coptions is seen. Barrie has etched
his characters and his play in silver.
Davis has been particularly fortu
! nate in getting a cast well-adapted to
| the play. Katherine Keho made her
campus debut last quarter in "The
; Haunted House" and from her work
j in rehearsals promises to give one of
! the finest pieces of work seen on the
i Stanford stage for some months. The
: part of Maggie is difficult as she is
| required to be extremely practical
and extremely romantic at the same
1 time. Miss Keho puts an understand
j ing into her role, and a charm in the
charming parts of Maggie's person
! ality.

Promises to Marry

Jack McDowell will make his initial
; appearance as John Shand, the poor
! Scotch student who cares so much
' for education that he is willing to
promise to marry Maggie for 300
pounds. Shand's part requires confi
l dence in his own ability and an in
! sensibility in the finesse of diplomacy
which Maggie valiantly covers up.
Herbert Wenig, Arthur Hurt, and
Lionel Walford as the two brothers
and the father, show promise in their
| interpretations. Louise Buxton is giv
! ing her countess role a spirited char
i acterization. Helen Ward plays the
! young society lady of the 1908 day.
Seats for Barrie's subtle comedy,
! "What Every Woman Knows," will go
!on sale at 1 o'clock today in front
!of the Women's Clubhouse. The
1 Masquers' play will be given a week
! from tomorrow night by an excep
j tionally good cast and will open the
I dramatic season of Winter quarter.
