# KOFOID TO GIVE TALK ON RADIUM TUESDAY EVENING
## 
### 
"The Effect of Radium on Normal
Cells and on Those From Cancer" will
be illustrated in a lecture Tuesday
evening at 7:30 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall by Professor Charles A.
Kofoid, hetd of the Department of
Zoology, University of California.
Professor Kofoid will interpret the
film made by Dr. Reginald Canti of
St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London,
in connection with the laboratory and
the Imperial Research Institution. Be
cause of Dr. Kofoid's personal con
ferences with the author, he was per
mitted to bring home the first copy
of the film for exhibition purposes.
The film was presented during the
past year at the Lister Anniversary
meeting of the British Medical Asso
ciation in Edinburgh and also at the
eleventh Zoological Congress in Buda
pest. In both cities a repetition of the
showing was demanded, and this was
the case also at Pomona College re
cently when Professor Kofoid inter
preted the film of the Pacific Coast
Division of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science.
