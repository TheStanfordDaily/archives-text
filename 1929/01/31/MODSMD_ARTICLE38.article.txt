# SPORTS OF 1929
## The 						Rough-House Kid 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Ma Stribling's boy, Bill, is settling
down to the serious (or is it comic?)
business of getting ready to scuttle
that ex-sailor, Jack Sharkey, when he
goes South next month to fight the
"Affair of the Itching Palms" at
Miami Beach, Florida. After hopping
over Solly Montgomery, ex-Centre
College football star, on January 21
at Memphis, Tenn., "Strib" brought
his knockout list to 110, or there
abouts, all of which means absolutely
nothing, as there never was a K.O.
list so padded with set-ups, push
overs, divers, tankers, Kellermans,
and Pete des Jardineses as the pride
of Macon, Georgia, boasts of.'
Still, Brother Stribling packs 'em

I in, even though the customers know
that it is only a case of some ready
and willing ham doing a running for
ward, standing-sitting dive for a few
hundred smackers. It must be that
they like to see Stribling in action.
The worst fight I ever saw was be
tween Stribling and Berlenbach, with
the Southerner using every style of
hold and tackle known to wrestling
j and football, and not doing any fight
ing at all. But I like to watch Strib
ling in the ring, because he is the
nearest thing to a Greek god in
physical perfection that's running
around today, and a treat to the eye,
even if his actions do offend the lover
j of real fighting.
