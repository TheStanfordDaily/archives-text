### 
Times turned in yesterday at the
weekly competitive swimming meet in
! Encina pool were very encouraging
j for this time of year. Pre-season prac
tice records show that the men are
j rounding into good shape preparatory
for the opening of the season. In the
j 100-yard free-style swim Iladley Bra
mel barely beat Reggie Harrison to
win in 56 2-5 seconds, which is good
j competitive time for this tank. Milt
Burns showed good pre-season form
in defeating Bill Cundall in the 100-
I yard breast stroke. His time was 1:15
flat. Driggs barely touched out Frank
Booth in the 150-yard back stroke,
winning in 1:49 flat. Booth is a fresh
i man who shows considerable promise.
Today the weekly varsity-frosh

4:30 o'clock. These regular weekly
games are in addition to the daily
practice. At this game and at all
; other practice meets no women are
