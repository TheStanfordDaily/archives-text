# Congress Spends Day In Debating Cruiser Measure
## Reed of Missouri Pleads for Strong Navy in Final Extended Speech 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 30. (JP)â€”lt
was Navy Day today in Congress, the
subject of cruisers and supplies for
that branch of the national defense
crowding nearly all other issues out
of the places they have occupied on
recent days.
Senator Reed of Missouri, in per
haps the last extended speech of his
senatorial career, made a plea for a
strong navy and, with sharply worded
thrusts and bits of sarcasm he at
tacked "Pacifists" and persons he said
were dreaming of a world of brotherly
love while other nations were build
ing cruisers.
In the House the appropriation for
the Navy Department, carrying $347,-
000,000 was reported from the Appro
priations Committee. It would provide
funds for the building of eight new
ships, in addition to the money neces
sary to run the navy for the next'
year.
The Senate found time in the midst
of the debate over the bill to add 15
cruisers and an aircraft carrier to
the navy to pass the appropriation
bill for the Department of Agriculture
which carried 1145,792,541.
