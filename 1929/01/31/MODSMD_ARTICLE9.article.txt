# RESEARCH GROUP HAS CAPITALISM DISCOURSE
## 
### 
The discussion of income and in
dustrial inequalities at the meeting of
the Industrial Research Group last
! night ,led by Professor 11. Hotelling,
emphasized the fact that the increas
ing control of the public by capitalism
I through newspapers and other organs
of opinion formed the "vicious circle"
which threatens to widen the gap be
tween the classes. It was thought that
the apathy of the people, caused by
synlcism of the war and by apparent
prosperity, could only be remedied by
the crusading spirit of the younger
generation.
