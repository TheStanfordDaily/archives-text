Gentlemen:
About five years ago, after trying
out many different styles of pipes
from the Missouri meerschaum to the
genuine meerschaum, including the
upside-down style made popular by
Vice-President Dawes, and experi
menting with just about all the to
baccos then on the market except
Edge worth, I finally decided that pipe
smoking was not for me.
For the last year or so I noticed the
boys around the office here using
Edgeworth to the exclusion of all
other tobaccos and evidently getting
real pleasure from their pipes.
In April of this year I was in Canada
on a business trip and decided to take
another whirl at pipe-smoking. So I
! invested a good share of my savings
j in a pipe and a few cents additional
for a can of Edgeworth.
From then on I have been figura
-1 tively kicking myself around the block
about once each day when I think of
j the five lean years I put in trying to
get along without a pipe. However, I
am trying to make up for lost time
and am succeeding quite well. Why
I failed to try Edgeworth long ago will
have to go down in history as an
unsolved question. But now that I
have found it, the years ahead look
rosy to me.
Very truly yours,
Ben Bayer
