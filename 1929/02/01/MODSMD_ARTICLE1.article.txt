# JOHNSON PLEAS FOR INCREASE IN NAVAL STRENGTH
## Prohibition and Cruisers Are Subjects Under Discussion In House, Senate Meetings Proposed $24,000,000 'Dry' Appropriation Increase Is Sent to Conference Body 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31.
hibition and cruisers were the two
subjects in the foreground in Con
gress today with the House voting to
send the $24,000,000 increase in pro
hibition enforcement proposal to a
conference committee for considera
tion and the Senate continuing to talk
on the warship construction program.
After long hours of debate the
House got in a voting mood late in
the day and sent the prohibition item,
embodied in the deficiency supply
bill, to a conference body despite the
protests of those clamoring for imme
diate approval of the appropriation al
ready adopted by the Senate. Just
before this House members lined up
240 to 141 against a move designed to
prevent such action.
Mellon Plan Backed
This balloting in the House showed
that the members supporting the view
of Secretary Mellon that the money
should not be appropriated without a
definite plan of allocation held a
whip-hand. The group differing with
the treasury head had sought imme
diate approval. The proposal as
worded, would place the expenditure
of the money in the hands of the
president.
Meanwhile the Senate continued
consideration of the bill to add 15
cruisers and an aircraft carrier to the
lleet. Senator Johnson of California
made a two-hour plea for a stronger
navy for America and declared that
in a brief period of time as the time
of man goes, the world's drama would
be played upon the Pacific ocean.
