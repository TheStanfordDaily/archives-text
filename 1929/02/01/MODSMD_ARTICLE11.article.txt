# GYMNASIUM, DORMITORY FUNDS NOT FROM SAME SOURCE-HARRIS
## Both Petitions Requesting A.W.S. Assembly To Be Discussed, Explained at Women's Meeting Monday Night 
### 
DOTH of the petitions requesting a women's assembly will be discussed in
the A.W.S. meeting scheduled for Monday evening at 7 o'clock in Room
214, according to Janet Harris, A.W.S. president. No house meetings will
be held at this time.
"The women must not think that the gymnasium and dormitory funds are
procured from the same source," said Miss Harris in regard to the two
petitions. "At present there is a committee working on the gymnasium
question, and this is communicating with the Board of Athletic Control
regarding funds for the gymnasium. This matter will be explained and dis
cussed in detail at the assembly in answer to the request of those who
petitioned concerning the gymnasium. The question of the dormitories,

> which involves an entirely different
fund, will also be explained."
Gymnasium Committee
The committee working on the
question of a new gymnasium is under
the chairmanship of Ruth Lansburgh.
Chesterlyn Thomas, president of
W.A.A., collaborating with the opinion
of Miss Harris, stated: "The plan for
the new gymnasium, on which the
committee has been working for three
quarters, has nothing to do with the
petition for the new dormitories.
There is no necessity for either of
them to be brought up together. The
women need and want a new gymna
sium, and whether or not they want
dormitories is an entirely separate
matter. We will go to different sources
tor the money, and there is no rea
son why the two should conflict in
any way."
The petition submitted to Janet
Harris on January 29 reads: "In ac
cordance with Article IX, Section 1,
subsection (d) of the A.W.S. Consti
tution, we, the undersigned women
students of Stanford University peti
tion the President of A.W.S. to call
an assembly of all women to formu
late a request that the University
authorities supply as promptly as pos
sible permanent housing in order to
permit the unification of Stanford's
five hundred women."
Second Petition
The petition submitted on the fol
lowing day was: "Whereas: We feel
the building of dormitories sufficient
to house all University women is un
necessary since the Stanford Women
are at present adequately housed; and
if the University is willing to spend
money to improve the women's com
fort, and since the present women's
gymnasium is in a deplorable condi

Chesterlyn Thomas, president of
W.A.A., collaborating with the opinion
of Miss Harris, stated: "The plan for
the new gymnasium, on which the
committee has been working for three
quarters, has nothing to do with the
petition for the new dormitories.
There is no necessity for either of
them to be brought up together. The
women need and want a new gymna
sium, and whether or not they want
dormitories is an entirely separate
matter. We will go to different sources
tor the money, and there is no rea
son why the two should conflict in
any way."
The petition submitted to Janet
Harris on January 29 reads: "In ac
cordance with Article IX, Section 1,
subsection (d) of the A.W.S. Consti
tution, we, the undersigned women
students of Stanford University peti
tion the President of A.W.S. to call
an assembly of all women to formu
late a request that the University
authorities supply as promptly as pos
sible permanent housing in order to
permit the unification of Stanford's
five hundred women."
Second Petition
The petition submitted on the fol
lowing day was: "Whereas: We feel
the building of dormitories sufficient
to house all University women is un
necessary since the Stanford Women
are at present adequately housed; and
if the University is willing to spend
money to improve the women's com
fort, and since the present women's
gymnasium is in a deplorable condi
tion; we, the undersigned women stu
dents of Stanford University, in ac
cordance with Article IX, section 1,
subsection (d) of the Associated Wo
men Students' Constitution, do here
by petition the president of A.W.S.
to call an assembly of all Stanford
women students to formulate a re
quest that the University authorities
supply as promptly as possible a new
women's gymnasium in accordance
with the plans which have been sub
mitted thereto."
DOTH of the petitions requesting a women's assembly will be discussed in
the A.W.S. meeting scheduled for Monday evening at 7 o'clock in Room
214, according to Janet Harris, A.W.S. president. No house meetings will
be held at this time.
"The women must not think that the gymnasium and dormitory funds are
procured from the same source," said Miss Harris in regard to the two
petitions. "At present there is a committee working on the gymnasium
question, and this is communicating with the Board of Athletic Control
regarding funds for the gymnasium. This matter will be explained and dis
cussed in detail at the assembly in answer to the request of those who
petitioned concerning the gymnasium. The question of the dormitories,

> which involves an entirely different
fund, will also be explained."
Gymnasium Committee
The committee working on the
question of a new gymnasium is under
the chairmanship of Ruth Lansburgh.
