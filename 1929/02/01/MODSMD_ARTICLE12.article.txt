# BASEBALL TEAM MEETS OLYMPIC CLUB TOMORROW
## Professional Stars; Former College Men Play For Post Street Club 
### 
In their contest with the Berkeley pros
last Wednesday, Stanford's varsity base
ball team looked like the real goods. They
will have another chance to demonstrate
their effectiveness tomorrow afternoon
when they meet the Olympic Club tossers
at 2:30 o'clock on the varsity diamond.
This year the Club has an amateur team
composed of professional stars and for
mer college men.
Jack Nounnan, former captain of the
University of California baseball team,
whom Carl Zamloch, the Bear coach, sent
to the Detroit Tigers, will probably start
on the mound for the Post Street organi
zation. Other players include pitchers
Bud De Never, Ray McCormick, and
Bobby Minty; outfielders John Clymer,
Heinie Thompson, and Ed Coopman; in
fielders Ira Robie, Joe Collins, Dutch
Thompson, Bill Maguire, and Don Gari
baldi. The last two formerly played for
the Stanford varsity.
Kern Will Start â€¢
Gene Kern will probably start on the
mound for the varsity, as Lewis and Tay
lor worked Wednesday. Kern has been
twirling a good brand of ball and should
show the Clubmen some fancy pitching.
Spud Hardy will do the catching. Dur
ing the last two games, Hardy has caught
six different pitchers, which is a plenty
tough job for any catcher.
Cook, Churchill, Johnson, and Laird
have been named as the starting infielders.
This combination did some neat fielding
last week and cut off several hits. Cap
tain Frank Wilton is the only outfielder
sure to start. Hunken has an infected
arm, and Coach Harry Wolter has not
yet decided who will till the open posi
tions.
