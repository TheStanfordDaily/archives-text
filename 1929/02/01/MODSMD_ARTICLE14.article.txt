# PLEA MADE FOR MORE BABE TRACK ASPIRANTS
## 
### 
Another plea for more freshman track
candidates was made yesterday by the
managers. There arc several events in
which no freshmen are working out and
several more in which no performances
capable of placing in the Little Big Meet
have been turned in.
Especially in the mile, two-mile, and
jumps is there room for more candidates,
while in almost any of the fourteen
events a man will have an excellent
chance of making tlie team. The regular
weekly practice meet for both varsity and
freshman squads will be held this after
noon at 4:15 o'clock.
