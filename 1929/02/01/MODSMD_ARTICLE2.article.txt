# REALISTIC SCENES BEING MADE FOR BARRIE'S COMEDY
## 
### 
Four realistic sets are being constructed
by Harold Helvenston for the production
of "What Every Woman Knows," to be
given next Friday night in the Assembly
Hall. Seat sale for the play will continue
today at the Old Union from 1 to 5 o'-
clock.
The four changes for the different
scenes make the technical end of the pro
duction difficult on the campus stage.
Modern stage handling will be employed
to shift the scenes between acts, in order
that the waits will not be long.
The first act takes place in the living
room of the Wylie home in Scotland, and
has a quaint charm of tradition about it.
On the walls will be three Scotch por
traits.
The second act is the one of John
Shand's triumph, and takes place in a
barber shop. Posters cover the walls, and
placards are scattered over the room. The
scene of the third act is the London draw
ing-room study of the Shands, a charm
ingly decorated room, revealing the good
taste of Maggie Shand. The fourth act
occurs in the living room of the country
home of the Countess de la Briere.
