# VARSITY CAGERS HEAD SOUTH FOR BRUIN CONTESTS
## John McCandless to Start in Place of Bud Hawkins as Pivot Man for Cardinals Verne Corbin, Bear Captain, Leads Southern Scorers With Total of 48 Points 
### ANSON REEDER 
Well folks, they've gone. Fourteen
determined young men, the Stanford
basketball squad, checked out late
yesterday aboard the Lark, bound for
Los Angeles where they will engage
the Bruins in a crucial two-game
series this week-end.
Last night they worked in the Pa
vilion until after dark perfecting a
defense against the Uclan basketeers.
In fact they worked so late that they
just had time to eat dinner before
grabbing the rattler for the South
land.
Before he embarked Coach Husky
Hunt made one change in the lineup
which is scheduled to take the court
against the Bruins tomorrow night.
Johnny McCandless, because his work
has shown so much improvement dur
ing the past ten days, will start at
center in place of Hawkins.
Although some of the players were
inclined to be downhearted for a few
days following the team's defeat at
the hands of California, the whole
bunch had reached the right psycho
logical aspect (or something like
that) before their embarkation last
night. They were going south to
trounce the Bruins.
The squad is in good shape physi
cally with the exception of Phil Mof
fatt, who is still nursing an ankle
injury received in the game last Sat
urday. The starting line-up:
Stanford— U.C.L.A.—
Fawcett F Wilds
Berg F Linthicum
McCandless C Woodruff
Reynolds G Baker
Rothert (C) G Sunseri
At present the University of Cali
fornia is leading the southern division
of the Coast Conference with five
wins and no defeats. This includes
one victory over Stanford, two over
Southern California and U.C.L.A.
However, the Bears proved that they
were not invulnerable Tuesday night
when, on their own court, they fell
before the scintillating attack of the
St. Ignatius cagers for the second con
secutive year. And it was not just one
of those lucky breaks, either, for the
Bears were outplayed, and whipped
by the decisive score of 34 to 22.
Verne Corbin, captain and center
on the California team, is leading
Conference basket-shooters in the
southern division with a total of
forty-eight points for five games. Mor
tenson of Southern California is sec
ond with thirty-six in four games,
and Stevens of the Bears is third
with thirty-three.
The next three are: Linthicum,
U.C.L.A., 32; Woodruff, U.C.L.A., 31;
Fawcett, Stanford, 29. Although Faw
cett rates sixth on this list he leads
Corbin by the fraction of a point in
average number of baskets per game.
Stanford has only played three Con
ference games, while Cal has played
five, and S.C. and U.C.L.A. have each
played four.
