# Put The Question Baldly
## 
### 
Suggestion has been made that on the ballot having to do with the
a l,ol —pardon, discontinuance —of the bonfire, three choices be allowed:
retention, discontinuance, or modification.
The Daily does not favor offering the choice of modification, because
it believes that the Executive Committee itself should determine the size
of, and manner of building, the bonfire. If a "yes" vote on the fire should
be registered by the students in the election on the 12th, it would remain
for the Executive Committee properly to regulate the next bonfire; if a
"no" vote is registered, no one will have to bother his head about any
thing. Yet if the modification plan were offered on the ballot, most likely
the majority would favor that, refusing out of sentiment to vote for
abolition when it might so easily have just a suuill bonfire. But since, if
retention of the bonfire is voted, the Executive Committee would have to
regulate the building of it, we are just as well off if given only the
choices "ves" and "no" on the question of retention.
