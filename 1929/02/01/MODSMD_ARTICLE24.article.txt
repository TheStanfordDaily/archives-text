# Another Precedent Is Born
## 
### 
Matching Hammer and Coffin's original ante, the Class of 1930 yes
terday voted $100 to the New Theatre for Stanford Fund. By this ac
tion, a precedent has been set for other classes and student organizations
to follow.
The Theatre Fund now stands at $1950, which is a commendable total,
considering the fact that no odious "drive" has been made, no "litera
ture" poured into the Postoffice, and no high pressure bleeding of the
turnip yet commenced.
A lucrative source of money for the fund will be the Masque Ball,
which the Rally Committee is to stage next quarter. All proceeds are to
go to the new theatre.
It is fast becoming true that an organization cannot be considered to
be "on the boat" unless it has given till it hurts to the fund.
