# Matins Give Place To Vespers
## 
### 
The ascetic life holds no appeal for the Stanford student, if we
properly interpret the abolition of morning chapel. Seven-fifty in the
morning is too monastic an hour for pilgrims seeking the church's shelter
to be about on these misty, moist mornings. Even the Early Fathers
demanded that at least two or three be gathered together in His name
before requests would be granted. So, during the present quarter, morn
ing chapel has been abolished (it's growing to be a custom of our era)
and vesper services following the organ recitals substituted. The change
ought to be welcomed, for vespers are less hurried and more contem
plative than matins.
