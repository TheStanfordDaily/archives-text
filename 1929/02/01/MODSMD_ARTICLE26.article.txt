# The 						Same Old Duster

In the first place, we are not writing a pufF for the Columbia Theatre.
But when the long-awaited Gilbert and Sullivan Company suddenly
looms so large on the Horizon of Things Worth While, what can one do?
Those who relegate Gilbert and Sullivan to the Theatrical Past have
not yet seen the D'Oyly Carte's production of "The Mikado." The tune
ful music was just as fresh, and the nonsensical plot and lyrics just as
bright, as when Henry Lytton first played Ko-Ko, the Lord High Exe
cutioner, on the Savoy stage in 1885, under the watchful eye of William
Swenck Gilbert himself.
And this same Lytton, believe it or not, is still playing the role! lie
played it this week, and he will follow it with equally famous character
izations in "The Gondoliers," "The Pirates of Penzance," "Jolanthe,"
and "Ruddigore," with "Trial by Jury" thrown in for good measure.
This is an opportunity that should certainly not be missed. It is a
chance to see the great comic operas put on in the Gilbertian tradition,
just as they were presented before Gilbert and Sullivan and D'Oyly
Carte, the manager, years ago.
The operas will go on forever, but not at the Columbia Theatre. Only
a week or so more remains. Look in the nearest metropolitan theatrical
columns, and make a quick dash for San Francisco.
Remember, you saw it in the columns of the Daily, (adv.)
The Oracle of the Chronicle Sporting Green comes about on a new
tack. 'Twas he who last fall argued that the Idaho-Stanford football
game should be played in Kezar Stadium rather than here, where it was
originally scheduled. Yesterday Oracle Harry B. Smith declared that
"as much as possible college sports competition should be confined to the
campus."
Well, it's a great life, mates.
California authorities are having difficulty in securing enough students
to live at I'owles dormitory, new hall for men. Since the charge is $50 a
month for room and board and a $10 breakage deposit, it doesn't seem as
if the Berkeley authorities are going out of their way to encourage dormi
tory life.
