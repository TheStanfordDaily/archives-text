## STEINBECK ARGUES FOR THE BONFIRE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We have on hand a proposition that
I believe merits quite as much discus
sion as some of the recent subjects
that are being put in the limelight.
Shall we discontinue the Big Game
Bonfire? My reason for bringing this
up is two-fold: first to bring out some
real constructive discussion both pro
and con on the matter, and secondly
to present my view on the question.
I do not believe that the bonfire
symbolizes solely a hate for Califor
nia. I believe that the spirit behind
it is far above that. I think that the
idea is that we want everyone in
California, in the United States, to
know that Stanford University is on
the map, that we still have some en
thusiasm left for our athletics and
affairs outside our academic curricu
lum, to show this especially to our
alumni, and to get as many of them
here for that occasion as possible so
that we can inspire them again with
the school spirit and have them still
feel they are here in spirit though
perhaps not in body.
My idea is first to stop having just
(he freshmen build the bonfire. Let's
have the whole University turn out
for a day and a night to build it. I
deny that our spirit is such that we
will not turn out in a body to do so.
We have done it twice in the last i

, four years and the result lias been â– 
i much more successful than the origi
| nal. Why should we push the whole
I thing onto the freshmen? Let's do
, away with crabbing at them. It is not j
I a fair demand on the freshman class,
j After we have been here one year we !
j are much better fitted to arrange our
1 program for the occasion than our
freshmen.
Let's not put any premium on the ;
size, build our bonfire, and the result j
plus the spirit that is really Stan- ,
ford's will produce the rest.
Then, let's have a real rally at the
bonfire. We all go there from the j
Pavilion, watch it for a little while,
and then go home. Let's put the bon
fire on one end of the field so that !
we can have a big space for the audi- j
ence, then install some loud speakers |
for the yell leaders and speakers, and !
then we &ill have everyone in on
the rally. Everyone realizes that but
a small number hear the rally, in com
parison with those who would really
like to. If we will follow this idea we
will have all outdoors for room, and
with the loud speakers everyone will
hear, and the result will be bigger
and better even than the rallies of
the past have been.
I hope everyone will get in this
discussion and that it will be on the
subject and not at me.
Sincerely, Steinie Steinbeck.
