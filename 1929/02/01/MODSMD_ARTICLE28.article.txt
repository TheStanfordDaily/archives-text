# SUGGESTS UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE FLYING INSTRUCTION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Returning to tlie Farm after a cou- j
pie of years' absence I was delighted
to find the old Alma Mater had be
come so air-minded that a flying
bchool is now part of the institution. J
I made speedy tracks to the airport ;
to become acquainted and to see what ;
sort of a school we had, and incident
ally, because of my interest in flying,
to find the cost and requirement for
entrance. 1 strolled about the premises
for a few moments; then approached
one of the aviators (whom I after
wards learned to be the chief) to ask
a few questions. 1 received a rather
blunt answer and was given a cold j
shoulder. 1 then obtained a pamphlet !
and went on my way.
It was on reading this pamphlet j
that I received my first jolt. The
school is privately owned; and the!
cost of the primary course is $300.
(This primary course does not give a
license of any kind or even take the j
student far beyond the point of his
first solo). Since, by talking with sev
eral University students who have
taken the course, I find that it is not
all that it is made out to be.
What a disillusioned person I was!
After all, the flying school had abso
lutely no connection with the Uni
versity. It is a profit making estab
lishment merely leasing University j
property, and its tuition fees are so
large that it would be a waste of
money and time to take the course.

j Aviation has a great field. It needs
I well-trained young men, and young
j men in a few years will need avia
; tion. There is no time like a man's
| college career which is more oppor- !
j tune for aviation training, and there |
! is no better situation than the Stan- <
; ford campus for a flying school. But !
: why must we have a privately owned, ]
profit-making school when the Uni
versity could have its own aviation :
school managed efficiently on a non- 1
profit basis in connection with the |
! already established aerodynamics de
partment? A certain amount of aca
demic credit might well be given to
students who complete the course.
| With such a flying school, where at- |
| tendance to classes was compulsory
;as in other courses, where hours to
\ ward graduation were given, and
where the price was $150 rather than
; $300, many more students would j
] grasp the opportunity for primary
| training and many more would ad- 1
i vance to private pilots or even to !
j commercial pilots. On enquiring from- i
I aviators in San Francisco and Oak
i land I find that the actual cost of
| giving a primary course of fifteen
J hours, which is given here, should |
amount to $150 at the most.
Such a University flying school !
would give opportunity to many who
desire to fly but cannot or will not ■
under present conditions. And a great |
amount of prestige in this great field
j would come to Stanford.
Sincerely, Air-Minded Grad.

school is privately owned; and the!
cost of the primary course is $300.
(This primary course does not give a
license of any kind or even take the j
student far beyond the point of his
first solo). Since, by talking with sev
eral University students who have
taken the course, I find that it is not
all that it is made out to be.
What a disillusioned person I was!
After all, the flying school had abso
lutely no connection with the Uni
versity. It is a profit making estab
lishment merely leasing University j
property, and its tuition fees are so
large that it would be a waste of
money and time to take the course.

j Aviation has a great field. It needs
I well-trained young men, and young
j men in a few years will need avia
; tion. There is no time like a man's
| college career which is more oppor- !
j tune for aviation training, and there |
! is no better situation than the Stan- <
; ford campus for a flying school. But !
: why must we have a privately owned, ]
profit-making school when the Uni
versity could have its own aviation :
school managed efficiently on a non- 1
profit basis in connection with the |
! already established aerodynamics de
partment? A certain amount of aca
demic credit might well be given to
students who complete the course.
| With such a flying school, where at- |
| tendance to classes was compulsory
;as in other courses, where hours to
\ ward graduation were given, and
where the price was $150 rather than
; $300, many more students would j
] grasp the opportunity for primary
| training and many more would ad- 1
i vance to private pilots or even to !
j commercial pilots. On enquiring from- i
I aviators in San Francisco and Oak
i land I find that the actual cost of
| giving a primary course of fifteen
J hours, which is given here, should |
amount to $150 at the most.
Such a University flying school !
would give opportunity to many who
desire to fly but cannot or will not ■
under present conditions. And a great |
amount of prestige in this great field
j would come to Stanford.

Returning to tlie Farm after a cou- j
pie of years' absence I was delighted
to find the old Alma Mater had be
come so air-minded that a flying
bchool is now part of the institution. J
I made speedy tracks to the airport ;
to become acquainted and to see what ;
sort of a school we had, and incident
ally, because of my interest in flying,
to find the cost and requirement for
entrance. 1 strolled about the premises
for a few moments; then approached
one of the aviators (whom I after
wards learned to be the chief) to ask
a few questions. 1 received a rather
blunt answer and was given a cold j
shoulder. 1 then obtained a pamphlet !
and went on my way.
