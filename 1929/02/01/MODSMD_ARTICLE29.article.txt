The Editor, Sir:
Don't you think that the average
loyal and satisfied sorority member
should be considered? Unfortunately
she is overlooked, while all eyes are
focussed upon the idle statement of a
fraternity man, and upon the out
bursts of the few who always break
into print on like occasions. Head
quarters is the logical source of in
formation, and in this instance head
quarters constitutes the whole body
of sorority women who are prone to
believe that their twenty years of or
ganization at Stanford plus their
strong national backing, have been in
vain if a few sentiments must cause
them to rate. Should it be necessary
at any time to defend herself by bal
lot, she would comply willingly. But
why cheapen that privilege by using
it merely to squelch a few ill-timed
and ineffectual fire-crackers?
Let us appeal to the Stanford
women, if they must commit them
selves on "concrete dormitories," to
at least be consistent. The battle-cry
so far has been "the movement must
come from the Row." Well, it came,
but if there is to be any following up,

! it should come from the Administra- !
tion or the Row. The petition to the |
Administration, that appeared on the i
front page of Wednesday's edition,
was signed by "fifty women." Can we -
be blamed for a pardonable curiosity J
as to the identity of these fifty? j
i Whether they are Roble or Row wo- |
| men doesn't matter, but in either case !
I they are not playing fair to the rest i
j of us.
Therefore we, the undersigned, peti- 1
tion the almighty heavens that our
| beloved sisters in Pan-Hellenic, whom i
we look upon more in sorrow than in
I anger, shall use a little more thought j
when called upon to vote on hasty
j ill-considered "compromises" that are
I obvious invitations to the Administra- \
j tion to make a move toward the re
j moval of sororities.
The moral of this story is that co
; operation is a wonderful thing, but :
j while we are co-operating we might j
just as well co-operate to keep our- j
selves on the campus, rather than to
prepare a path which we have no in
tention of following.

The Editor, Sir:
Don't you think that the average
loyal and satisfied sorority member
should be considered? Unfortunately
she is overlooked, while all eyes are
focussed upon the idle statement of a
fraternity man, and upon the out
bursts of the few who always break
into print on like occasions. Head
quarters is the logical source of in
formation, and in this instance head
quarters constitutes the whole body
of sorority women who are prone to
believe that their twenty years of or
ganization at Stanford plus their
strong national backing, have been in
vain if a few sentiments must cause
them to rate. Should it be necessary
at any time to defend herself by bal
lot, she would comply willingly. But
why cheapen that privilege by using
it merely to squelch a few ill-timed
and ineffectual fire-crackers?
Let us appeal to the Stanford
women, if they must commit them
selves on "concrete dormitories," to
at least be consistent. The battle-cry
so far has been "the movement must
come from the Row." Well, it came,
but if there is to be any following up,

! it should come from the Administra- !
tion or the Row. The petition to the |
Administration, that appeared on the i
front page of Wednesday's edition,
was signed by "fifty women." Can we -
be blamed for a pardonable curiosity J
as to the identity of these fifty? j
i Whether they are Roble or Row wo- |
| men doesn't matter, but in either case !
I they are not playing fair to the rest i
j of us.
Therefore we, the undersigned, peti- 1
tion the almighty heavens that our
| beloved sisters in Pan-Hellenic, whom i
we look upon more in sorrow than in
I anger, shall use a little more thought j
when called upon to vote on hasty
j ill-considered "compromises" that are
I obvious invitations to the Administra- \
j tion to make a move toward the re
j moval of sororities.
