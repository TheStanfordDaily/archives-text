Mikado. By Gilbert Sullivan. Columbia. |
A performing toe shared honors with ■
the marvelous right elbow of Katisha i
("on view Tuesdays and Fridays") and 1
the persecution complex of "The Em
peror of Japan" at four notable per
formances of "The Mikado" by the
very English D'Oyly Carte Gilbert and
Sullivan Company this week at the
Columbia.
The aforementioned pedal digit was i
owned by Hendy Lytton, and waved ■
hopelessly and double-jointedly during
the more hilarious portions of the fa
mous "Flowers That. IJloom in the ,
Sprang," when Ko-Ko, the Lord High
Executioner, was prone nn the ground,
stricken with grief at the prospect of

| marrying the elderly Katisha, who is
i "an acquired taste," by her own con-
! fession.
' Tliis may he Sanskrit to the reader
who is not a Gilbert-Sullivan fan, but
it' you're not don't expect any sym- j
pathy from us. Go ahead and enjoy
your "Good News" and "Gay Paree" —
you'll never know what you're miss
ing.
| "Pooh pooh for facial beauty," says
! Katisha. "I have a right shoulder
blade thai is the envy of eonnoiseurs."
: A fine philosophy, surely, for the
j much-maligned "500" —if they were
only such as some folks think they
are.
The D'Oyly Carte Company pre

sents "The Mikado" in the Gilbertian I
tradition, and pronounce "vase" as it
is pronounced in professors' homes, i
behind locked doors. Yes, the produc- !
i
i tion is English—typical if you like, |
bui well-nigh perfect.
j From the opening chorus of "gen- j
tlenien of Japan," through that mag- j
| nificent first act finale, past each ,
reminiscent musical milestone, till the I
time that the audience's applause
drowns the final notes, "The Mikado"
i is a splendid, colorful, heart-warming
| show.

Every role is given its full value, j

Leslie Rands' Pish Tush and Pauline !

I roles, step right up with the princi- !
I pals. Miss Wooten was a pretty sou- |
I brette, and combined with Marjorie |
j Eyre as Yum-Yum and Beatrice El- i
! burn as Peep-bo to do the "Three !
: Little Maids from School" number |
j charmingly. Miss Eyre scored with i
"The Moon and I," though the song
j is far more effective with a dark stage
I and spotlight.
A little of the boisterousness that
| DeWolf Hopper brings to the role of
Ko-Ko was absent in Henry Lytton's
performance. The English are more
concerned with playing the character
as it was meant to be played, rather
than attempting to make a comedian's
show out of it. Lytton was truly the
[ humble little tailor, elevated to the
post of Lord' High Executioner
"through a set of curious chances."
His love scene with the mountainous
Katisha (Bertha Lewis) was very
funny. So was his rendition of the
well-known "Tit-Willow."
Pooh-Bah, who is all the high of- [
fieers of state "rolled into one," was i
solidly played by Sydney Granville.
Darrell Fancourt made a ridiculous
demon out of the Mikado, and stopped
the show with that excruciating solo
—"to let the punishment fit the
crime." The quartet madrigal, "Bright
ly Dawns Our Wedding Day," scored
heavily. The pianissimo was vastly |
j effective.
Charles Goulding missed the dreamy j
! quality in "The Wandering Minstrel,"
but made an excellent Nanki-Pooh, I
nevertheless. The chorus sang as '
every chorus should sing; the cos-i
tumes were unusually colorful, even .
for "The Mikado"; and there was a ;
real English orchestra leader, who j
demanded attention from the audi- |
ence as well as from the orchestra.
It was an evening thoroughly worth- i
while, and if that scares you, it was !
plenty of fun, too. —Burnell Gould. !

than 100,000 narcotic users in the United j

performance. The English are more
concerned with playing the character

show out of it. Lytton was truly the
[ humble little tailor, elevated to the
post of Lord' High Executioner
"through a set of curious chances."
His love scene with the mountainous
Katisha (Bertha Lewis) was very

Darrell Fancourt made a ridiculous

heavily. The pianissimo was vastly |
j effective.
Charles Goulding missed the dreamy j

but made an excellent Nanki-Pooh, I
nevertheless. The chorus sang as '

for "The Mikado"; and there was a ;
real English orchestra leader, who j
demanded attention from the audi- |
ence as well as from the orchestra.

Mikado. By Gilbert Sullivan. Columbia. |
A performing toe shared honors with ■
the marvelous right elbow of Katisha i
("on view Tuesdays and Fridays") and 1
the persecution complex of "The Em
peror of Japan" at four notable per
formances of "The Mikado" by the
very English D'Oyly Carte Gilbert and
Sullivan Company this week at the
Columbia.
The aforementioned pedal digit was i
owned by Hendy Lytton, and waved ■
hopelessly and double-jointedly during
the more hilarious portions of the fa
mous "Flowers That. IJloom in the ,
Sprang," when Ko-Ko, the Lord High
Executioner, was prone nn the ground,
stricken with grief at the prospect of

| marrying the elderly Katisha, who is
i "an acquired taste," by her own con-
! fession.
' Tliis may he Sanskrit to the reader
who is not a Gilbert-Sullivan fan, but
it' you're not don't expect any sym- j
pathy from us. Go ahead and enjoy
your "Good News" and "Gay Paree" —
you'll never know what you're miss
ing.
| "Pooh pooh for facial beauty," says
! Katisha. "I have a right shoulder
blade thai is the envy of eonnoiseurs."
: A fine philosophy, surely, for the
j much-maligned "500" —if they were
only such as some folks think they
are.
