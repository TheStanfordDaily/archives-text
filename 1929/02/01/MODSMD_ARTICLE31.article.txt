# ORDNANCE CORPS RESERVES PLAN TRAINING SCHOOL
## Twenty-Five Men From Both Army, Navy Will Take Intensive Course 
### 
Approximately twenty-five army and
navy ordnance officers from Oregon,
Washington, and California will at
tend the third annual training school
at Stanford from February 3 to 16,
according to Thedore J. Hoover, dean
of the School of Engineering and
Faculty Executive Officer of the train
ing school.
The men who will attend the school
have either the A.13. degree or degree
of engineer. They are required to per
ioral a minimum number of hours of
active duty during the five-year
periods between reappointments. At
tendance at the training school here
is considered active duty.
Both the army and navy officers
will report to Colonel E. R. Warner
McCabe, the military commander of
the school. They will enter upon an
intensive two weeks' course during
which they will accomplish one quar
ter's work with an extensive report
in addition. The courses include metal
lurgy, mechanical engineering, and
the chemistry of explosives. It is ex
pected that the navy officers, of whom
there will be about five, are to con
centrate on the metallurgy course.
During the first training school held
on the campus the reserve officers
on the faculty had to conduct the spe
cial classes as well as their regular
classes, the extra teaching being
â€¢counted as active duty. Last year the
men who had attended the first ses
sion were added to the special fac
ulty, thus lessening the burden placed
upon any one man.
