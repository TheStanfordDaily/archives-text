# CARD, CALIFORNIA BOXERS WILL NOT ENTER N.Y. MEET
## University Presidents Agree To Withhold Permission For Eastern Trip 
### 
BERKELEY, Jan. 31. (/P)â€”Boxers
of the University of California and
Stanford will not participate in the
Intercollegiate National A.A.U. con
tests in Madison Square Garden, New
York, March 21 to 25.
This was announced here today by
President W. W. Campbell of the Uni
versity of California. He said he had
conferred with President Ray Lyman
Wilbur of Stanford University and
they agreed not to send teams East.
The students' executive council of
the University had granted permis
sion for the team to go, but President
Campbell declined to approve the ac
tion for the reason that he believes
boxing is not yet a proved sport and
because he believes the A.A.U. com
tests will be more in the nature of a
grandstand display before a non-col
lege audience rather than bona-fide
intercollegiate competition.

Harry Maloney, varsity boxing
coach, when informed of the announce
ment of President Wilbur's decision
expressed his keen disappointment
that the proposed meet might not
take place.
Maloney explained that when he
v/as East in November to attend the
national convention of the Athletic
Association he had talked with Major
Fleming of West Point on the possi
bility of Stanford and California meet
ing the Cadets in New York some
time in early spring.
West Point decided that it was un
able to finance such a meet, so Ma
loney conferred with the president of
the metropolitan section of the A.A.U.,
who said that, though it would be a
severe financial venture, he knew of
no better cause for which the as
sociation could expend its funds and
suggested that the meet be enlarged
to include New York University and
Annapolis.
The association president extended
an invitation to Stanford which ar
rived on the campus about two weeks
ago, offering to pay the entire ex
penses of seven boxers and either a
coach or manager to and from New
York.
