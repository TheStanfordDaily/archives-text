# Dr. Kofoid Of California Will Interpret Scientific Picture Tuesday Evening
## 
### 
Professor Charles A. Kofoid, head
of the Department of Zoology at the
j University of California, will inter
: pret a film made by Dr. Reginald
Canti of St. Bartholmew's Hospital,
London, dealing with the behavior and
1 activities of living cells in the normal
' state and in the cancer tissues, Tues
day evening in the Assembly Hall.
The film deals with the growth of
living cells in culture media in sterile
! containers carried at the body tem
perature, detached from the bodies
| from which they come. It shows
their behavior and division, their
movements, and the different activi
! ties of different kinds of cells, both
normal cells of growing bodies and
the cells of cancer grown in culture
media, both before and after treat
ment with radium.
