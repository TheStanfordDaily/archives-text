# CAMPUS LEADERS PRESENT OPINIONS ON 'BONFIRE CONTINUANCE' QUESTION
## 
### 
Should the bonfire be abolished?
In consideration of the advisability of
discontinuing the annual Big Game bon
fire, leaders in various campus activities
are divided in opinion. The fate of the
yearly "big fire" will be voted upon at the
Quad election scheduled for February 12.
Various responses were received yes
terday when a Daily reporter questioned
a number of prominent students.
John Wheatley, secretary of the
A.S.S.U.: "As far as I am concerned, I
would like to sec it abolished. It has out
grown its usefulness."
Helen Thompson, prominent in cam
pus dramatics: "It's a waste of energy
and doesn't create enough enthusiasm for
the amount of work put into it."
George Bodle, president of Class of
1930: "I think the bonfire should l>c abol
l ished. It is an artificial means of arous
ing enthusiasm. It's a waste of time and
energy."
John Lauritzen, varsity sprinter: "I'm
in favor of limiting its size. It's all right
to arouse spirit, but too much useless ef
fort is expended. Students are too irre
sponsible about where they get wood for
the fire. We can be more sensible in ac
tion toward arousing spirit."
Ted Krough, vice-presidcnt of the

A.S.S.U.: "The little extra enthusiasm
which the bonfire arouses is hardly worth
the tremendous amount of effort required
to build such a pyre. If an equal amount
of energy were spent in preparing a
worthwhile rally, the results would be
far more effective."
R. Frank Baker, former editor of the
Stanford Daily: "I am in favor of abol
ishing the fire. It wastes too much of the
frosh time, and doesn't hold a great deal
of interest for the general student body.
It seems to be a lot of horseplay for spec
tators from all parts of the peninsula."
Spud Harder, varsity football man:
"I'm in favor of keeping the bonfire.
We're losing all of our traditions. I
think it ought to be built faster and the
burden should not be placcd on one
group."
Biff Hoffman, captain of 1028 varsity
football squad: "Keep the bonfire, by all
means. They're doing away with too
many customs. It has a great effect on
the fellows just before they go into se
clusion before the Big Game. The fel
lows don't forget the bonfire."
Janet Harris, president of A.W.S.:
"I am opposed to continuing the bonfire.
1 believe that it's better to put the time
and energy on a good rally."

terday when a Daily reporter questioned
a number of prominent students.
John Wheatley, secretary of the
A.S.S.U.: "As far as I am concerned, I
would like to sec it abolished. It has out
grown its usefulness."
Helen Thompson, prominent in cam
pus dramatics: "It's a waste of energy
and doesn't create enough enthusiasm for
the amount of work put into it."
George Bodle, president of Class of
1930: "I think the bonfire should l>c abol
l ished. It is an artificial means of arous
ing enthusiasm. It's a waste of time and
energy."
John Lauritzen, varsity sprinter: "I'm
in favor of limiting its size. It's all right
to arouse spirit, but too much useless ef
fort is expended. Students are too irre
sponsible about where they get wood for
the fire. We can be more sensible in ac
tion toward arousing spirit."
Ted Krough, vice-presidcnt of the

A.S.S.U.: "The little extra enthusiasm
which the bonfire arouses is hardly worth
the tremendous amount of effort required
to build such a pyre. If an equal amount
of energy were spent in preparing a
worthwhile rally, the results would be
far more effective."
R. Frank Baker, former editor of the
Stanford Daily: "I am in favor of abol
ishing the fire. It wastes too much of the
frosh time, and doesn't hold a great deal
of interest for the general student body.
It seems to be a lot of horseplay for spec
tators from all parts of the peninsula."
Spud Harder, varsity football man:
"I'm in favor of keeping the bonfire.
We're losing all of our traditions. I
think it ought to be built faster and the
burden should not be placcd on one
group."
Biff Hoffman, captain of 1028 varsity
football squad: "Keep the bonfire, by all
means. They're doing away with too
many customs. It has a great effect on
the fellows just before they go into se
clusion before the Big Game. The fel
lows don't forget the bonfire."
Janet Harris, president of A.W.S.:
"I am opposed to continuing the bonfire.
1 believe that it's better to put the time
and energy on a good rally."
Should the bonfire be abolished?
In consideration of the advisability of
discontinuing the annual Big Game bon
fire, leaders in various campus activities
are divided in opinion. The fate of the
yearly "big fire" will be voted upon at the
Quad election scheduled for February 12.
