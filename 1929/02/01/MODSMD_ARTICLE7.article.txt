# Juniors Donate $100 To Drive; Total Is $1950
## 
### 
The Junior Class voted $100 toward
the Hammer and Coffin Theatre Fund
at their meeting yesterday afternoon,
thus setting a precedent for other
classes to follow. This brings the total
sum, including yesterday's donation,
up to $1950.
The class went on record as sup
porting the Honor Code, adopting the
resolution: That the Junior Class is
in accord with the principle of the
Honor Code and pledges itself in
maintenance of the honor spirit at
Stanford.
Two dollars was decided upon as
class dues to be paid at the time of
the Junior Prom. Plans for the Cord
Ball and another jolly-up were dis
cussed, and it was proposed that both
be given at Roble. The Cord Ball will
not be given during Junior Week as
lias heretofore been the custom.
