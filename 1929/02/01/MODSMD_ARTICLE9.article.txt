# Council Begins Campaign To Stop Long Distance Calls On Local Phones
## 
### 
A vigorous campaign to stop long
distance telephone calls over local
phones in the hails has been started
by the Men's Council. Attempts on
the part of the students to charge the
halls for long distance calls will not
be tolerated.
"A Certain Student" was sentenced
to ten hours at the Convalescent
Home for not using a pay phone for
a long distance call and other cases
of this sort will be severely dealt
with, says Fred Wool, chairman of
the council. There are pay phones in
all the halls; these only should be
used for long distance calls, Wool
said.
