other of Wolf Hounds, snapping, lurching,
straining to go. Five men are needed to hold the
sled. They're ready to go.
The dog teams will race each day from Truckee
to Tahoe and back, 30 miles a day, or a total of
90 miles for the event. Observation trains carry
ing All-Day Lunch cars, will follow the teams as
they race, so that spectators, in warmth and com
fort, can watch their favorites.
Everything is made easy for you. You can plan
your trip with little worry as to details.
An Inexpensive Outing

snows won't cost you much. Your expenditure

Winter sports equipment can be rented at
