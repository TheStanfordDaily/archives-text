# HOOVER PONDERS CABINET CHOICE; FINISHES FISHING
## Selection Is Discussed With Callers; Will Spend Next Few Days Finishing Work President-Elect Is Silent as Inaugural Day Looms; May Retain Seven Incumbents 
### 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla„ Feb. 3. (!■P)—
With the make-up of his cabinet still
incomplete, President-elect Hoover is
Riving increased thought to the selec
tions he still must make before his
inauguration next month.
He discussed this subject today
with some of those who called on him
and is expected to talk to others
about it during the next few days,
which he will spend at his offices
here cleaning up an accumulation of
work which he found awaiting him
last night upon his return from his
second fishing expedition to Long
Key.
Many of the suggestions that have
been made to him by party leaders
already have been rejected and some
of the closest friends of the next
President believe he will make his
own independent judgment of ten
men who will sit about the counsel
table with him in the White House.
If Mr. Hoover has confided to his
friends the names of those whom he
already has made up his mind to ap
point they have maintained a rigid
silence about it. He himself is de
termined to make no announcement
until he sends the nominations to the
Senate on March 4 immediately after
he has delivered his inaugural ad
dress.
The probabilities are that Mr.
Hoover will retain seven of the
Coolidge cabinet at least during the
<?arly days of his administration and
it is known that he will turn to the
Far West for his Secretary of the
Interior. There also is a rather gen
eral expectation that he will name
one man from the South in recogni
tion of the support he received from
that section.
