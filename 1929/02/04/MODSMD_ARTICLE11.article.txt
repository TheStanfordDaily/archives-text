# NECESSITY FOR MORE HOUSING STRESSED IN ANNUAL REPORT
## President Outlines General Plan for Readjusting Scope of University to Meet Changing Needs of Times 
### 
A GENERAL outline of the plan for readjusting the scope of the University j
to meet the changing needs of the times, a discussion of the hopes for ,
improving the campus housing conditions, and the need for further additions S
to Stanford's endowment are embraced in the annual report of President
! Wilbur which was issued Saturday to the trustees of the University for the
â–  year ending August 31, 1928.
1 The need for more adequate housing arrangements is covered in the report:
I "Experience makes it increasingly important that satisfactory fireproof
I buildings containing well-lighted and well-lieated rooms be made available for
i student lodgings. In Toyon and Branner halls the way has been pointed, and
| similar buildings need to be erected to meet our needs. The present housing
j of several hundred students in wooden buildings is most unsatisfactory. Each
year there have been fires in some of the fraternity and sorority houses.
! Every reasonable precaution is taken, but we cannot rest content until

housing is made available. We \
have sufficient area available. We I
need funds though to provide a large
part of the expense of building, so !
that the rooms can be rented on a :
reasonable basis. It will be compara- j
tively easy to work out plans for the
housing of the fraternities in such |
buildings."
Junior Colleges Grow
The growth of junior colleges is :
discussed by Dr. Wilbur:
"Since there are already a number j
of institutions in the state competing
with our Lower Division and offering, ;
practically without tuition, the same '
work for which we demand about
three hundred dollars per year, and ;
since the number of these institutions |
is growing steadily, readjustment i
must be made in time and in accord- j
ance with the events occurring about'
us. Careful estimates indicate that j
there will be an increase in the popu- !
lation of California at the rate of i
about 200,000 a year, that there will
be a marked increase in the number j
of high-school students, and that with |
in 10 years the number of students j
doing work in junior colleges or in
the Lower Divisions of state institu
lions will be in the neighborhood of
50,000. About 10 per cent of t,he gradu- |
ates of these institutions have been j
coming to Stanford. In all probability
some such percentage will be main- !
tained in the future. We can therefore j
look forward to a student body of ap- ;
proximately the present size made up |
of students selected from these exten
sions of the high schools in the state 1
or from institutions offering similar
work in other parts of the United
States or the world."
Endowments Discussed
The need for future endowment is j
explained by the President:
"The future development of Stan
ford depends upon additional endow-1
ment. Since the policy has been
adopted of not taking up new work j
until new funds are in sight for main
tenance, the securing of additional
resources is one of the prime func- j
tions of the University management. j
Funds given for specific purposes are |
of real advantage, but they are in a
sense locked up because the income j
from such funds has lost its flexibil- J
it y. The development of the Univer- j
sity can best take place with large
fluid funds which can be diverted
from more active and new fields of j
education and which can also be used
in administration and in making more i
effective gifts for specific purposes." !
Discussion of the University's many j
problems, including the building of a
new science building, the adjusting of
! the changes in the faculty, the junior
i college sites, and an appeal to the !
: alumni to aid in completing the gath
i ering of the "First Million for Stan
ford" appear in the report.
