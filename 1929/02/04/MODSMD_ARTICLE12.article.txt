With a double win over UCLA
J chalked to their credit, the Stanford
j basketball team returns from a vic
torious southern tour this morning to
prepare for the hectic week that con
fronts them. Tomorrow night they
meet St. Ignatius College of San Fran
cisco, and on Saturday night the Uni
versity of California, in the second
i game of the "Big Series."
With only two meaker practice ses
| sions to prepare for the Gray Fog of
| St. Ignatius, Coach Husky Hunt will
! be forced to put his Redshirts through
; some stiff defensive drill. The visitors
i turned in their eleventh straight vic
-1 tory of the season Saturday night
i against Loyola College of Los An
geles, and last Tuesday night trounced
lhe Bears on their own court by the
j decisive score of 34 to 22. Hale, cen
ter, and Bareilles, guard, are the star
performers of the visiting team. The
latter is considered by many to be the
i best guard on the Coast. Hale is one
of these basket-shooters that seems
Ito have an intuition for finding the
bucket. His uncanny ability for toss
ing them in from over his shoulder,
no matter what speed or in what
direction he may be traveling at the
: time, always labels him a dangerous
I man.
The games in the South, judging
by reports, were enlightening inas
' much as they proved Hawkins the
logical regular for the center posi
-1 tion. He was responsible for both
rallies that were instrumental in put
ting the Uclans on the short end of
the score, and although playing only
| a portion of each game he was high
point man for both performances.
Tyler, playing part-time at one of
the 'forward positions, also looked
! good. Berg and Fawcett, Card regu
lars, played their usual consistent
game. Reynolds and Captain Rothert
i were a much-improved pair of guards
if they may be judged by their per
formance against California last Sat
j urday.
