# B.A.C. Cancels Student Charge In Coast Games
## Contests With California and U.S.C., Special Events Made Exceptions 
### 
Student body cards will be suffi
j dent to admit Stanford students to
j the Pacific Coast Conference inter
collegiate athletic contests hp'd at
Stanford next year.
This was the decision of the Board
I of Athletic Control in their meeting
; Friday night when the motion was
! unanimously passed to do away with
| the admission fees ranging from '
| twenty-five cents to $1.50 that have |
been charged all students who have i
attended the games in the past.
Exception was made, however, to '
contests with the University of Cali- i
fornia, the University of Southern j
California, post-season games and spe- '
; cial events such as the Pacific Coast |
j Conference track meet. At these the
regular admission charge will be
; made.
The new scheme was first suggested !
Iby Philip Cavalero, student repre- |
i sentative on the board, last quarter,
| but it was worked out and presented !
|at the board meeting by A1 Masters,
j Graduate Manager. It is in use at
J several other schools on the coast.
That the new system will save the
| students a considerable sum of money :
j is shown by the fact that the board
! estimates that it will lose approxi
. mately $6000 by it. The board, at the
; present time, is engaged in making
out its budget for next year and as
I yet no way has been found to take '
care of the loss that will be incurred i
by the free student admissions.
