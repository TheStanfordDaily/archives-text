# U.C. BASKETBALL GAME TICKETS ON SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Rooters' tickets for the second
California-Stanford basketball game,
Saturday, February 9, will go on sale
at the A.S.S.U. offices in the Old I
Union Tuesday from 9 to 12 o'clock :
and from 1 to 5 o'clock .AH seats are i
to be reserved at the price of 50 cents i
and can only be procured by present- j
ing Student Body cards.
Since there are only enough avail- |
able seats to care for approximately
50 per cent of the Student Body, it is
improbable that any general admis- '
sion tickets will be sold. Any tickets
remaining unsold after Tuesday will j
be placed on sale to students and
alumni at $1 each.
In order to save delay and loss of
time, arrangements have been made
to allow any one student to purchase
one rooter's ticket for each Student
Body card presented. Thus each club, !
fraternity, or sorority can delegate i
one person to buy all the tickets for |
that particular organization. All Stu- i
dent Body cards must be presented by j
him, and, if possible, all cash to cover ;
the amount in one check.
