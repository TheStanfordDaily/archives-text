### 
A black and white "Lit," the third
issue of the year, will be on sale on

rather than the fantastic theme one
frequently finds in the Stanford
Literary Magazine.

murder stories and one concerning a
suicide. Lincoln Hobson's "Shadows"

imagines shadows and overcome by
a dementia praecox, kills himself.

murder, and "The Obsidian Giant"
