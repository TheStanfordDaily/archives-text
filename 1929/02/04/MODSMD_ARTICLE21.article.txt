# Boxing Is Apparently the Cinderella of Our Athletic Family

### 
That boxing is not as beloved a child of the University as football
is about all that can be deduced from the administration's refusal to
allow the Board of Athletic Control to accept the invitation profefed
the New York A.A.U. for boxing bouts in New York during the spring
holidays. California and Stanford boxing teams were separately invited
to meet West Point and Annapolis in Madison Square Garden, with
expenses fully to be paid by the A.A.U. As for our prudence in meeting
such competition, it was thought that at least Captain Dillon and John
Hromadka would have a good chance of success in their events, and that
California would be able to perform creditably in certain other weights,
with the result that the W r est would support its already favorable reputa
tion in the metropolis.
Now President Wilbur and President Campbell have refused the
invitation. California has a tolerably logical basis for turning it down,
because of the fact that the athletes would have to absent themselves from
college. Not so as regards Stanford. The men going to New York would
lose no college time whatever.
What is the basis of Dr. Wilbur's refusal? Probably in great part
the disapproval of the trip which has been expressed by Dr. Thomas A.
Storey, head of the Department of Physical Education and Hygiene and
chairman of the faculty athletic committee. Dr. Storey says that the
bouts in the Garden would be "great public spectacles for the wrong kind
of crowd; one not at all comparable to a football crowd, for example."
Millions of citizens of New York State are opposed to the boxing policy
of the state, and if Stanford participated in bouts in that place where
the evils of professional pugilism are imagined to center, great odium
would attach to its name. "It would be unfortunate for Stanford Uni
versity to influence the general public to a belief that it was taking part
in a public prize fight." Furthermore, Dr. Storey is none too well dis
posed toward the organization sponsoring the proposed bouts, the A.A.U.
It seems to the Daily that a more sympathetic recognition of boxing
as an intercollegiate sport ought to be held by the authorities of the
University. Coach Harry Maloney puts out good and unquestionably
sportsmanlike teams; boxing is the most popular minor sport, and indeed
draws larger crowds and incites more enthusiasm than either baseball or
tennis; and finally, it is even more highly regarded by collegians in the
East than by those here. West Point and Annapolis are both accustomed
to fight in New York City—must we always box within cloisters? Per
haps the Madison Square Garden crowds are rough and tough; would
that interfere with our performing creditably? Are not basketball games
occasionally held in Kezar Pavilion and football games in Kezar Stadium?
The Stanford track team is allowed and encouraged to compete in meets
held under the auspices of the A.A.U. before crowds that are anything
but collegiate.
Before we fight, does a guarantee have to be made that our boxers
will be viewed through lorgnettes?

posed toward the organization sponsoring the proposed bouts, the A.A.U.
It seems to the Daily that a more sympathetic recognition of boxing
as an intercollegiate sport ought to be held by the authorities of the
University. Coach Harry Maloney puts out good and unquestionably
sportsmanlike teams; boxing is the most popular minor sport, and indeed
draws larger crowds and incites more enthusiasm than either baseball or
tennis; and finally, it is even more highly regarded by collegians in the
East than by those here. West Point and Annapolis are both accustomed
to fight in New York City—must we always box within cloisters? Per
haps the Madison Square Garden crowds are rough and tough; would
that interfere with our performing creditably? Are not basketball games
occasionally held in Kezar Pavilion and football games in Kezar Stadium?
The Stanford track team is allowed and encouraged to compete in meets
held under the auspices of the A.A.U. before crowds that are anything
but collegiate.
Before we fight, does a guarantee have to be made that our boxers
will be viewed through lorgnettes?
That boxing is not as beloved a child of the University as football
is about all that can be deduced from the administration's refusal to
allow the Board of Athletic Control to accept the invitation profefed
the New York A.A.U. for boxing bouts in New York during the spring
holidays. California and Stanford boxing teams were separately invited
to meet West Point and Annapolis in Madison Square Garden, with
expenses fully to be paid by the A.A.U. As for our prudence in meeting
such competition, it was thought that at least Captain Dillon and John
Hromadka would have a good chance of success in their events, and that
California would be able to perform creditably in certain other weights,
with the result that the W r est would support its already favorable reputa
tion in the metropolis.
Now President Wilbur and President Campbell have refused the
invitation. California has a tolerably logical basis for turning it down,
because of the fact that the athletes would have to absent themselves from
college. Not so as regards Stanford. The men going to New York would
lose no college time whatever.
What is the basis of Dr. Wilbur's refusal? Probably in great part
the disapproval of the trip which has been expressed by Dr. Thomas A.
Storey, head of the Department of Physical Education and Hygiene and
chairman of the faculty athletic committee. Dr. Storey says that the
bouts in the Garden would be "great public spectacles for the wrong kind
of crowd; one not at all comparable to a football crowd, for example."
Millions of citizens of New York State are opposed to the boxing policy
of the state, and if Stanford participated in bouts in that place where
the evils of professional pugilism are imagined to center, great odium
would attach to its name. "It would be unfortunate for Stanford Uni
versity to influence the general public to a belief that it was taking part
in a public prize fight." Furthermore, Dr. Storey is none too well dis
posed toward the organization sponsoring the proposed bouts, the A.A.U.
