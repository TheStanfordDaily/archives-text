# Quo Vadit Universitas?

With the multiplications of rumors that President Wilbur will take
a post in Hoover's cabinet and the assertion of the president to his friends
that he will not go to Washington, not only confusion obtains as to what
the administration of the University will he a month hence, but also
speculation arises upon the question whither the University is drifting.
The abolition of the Lower Division of course makes the most smoke on
the horizon, but endowment, replacement of the fast-depleting faculty,
and the building program loom up, too.
The president's interpretation of these matters is clearly set forth,
for the edification of those who are interested, in the President's Report,
released Saturday. In it is stressed a fact which is too little considered
by opponents of Lower Division abolitionâ€”that the financial structure of
the University is so precarious that adjustment must be made to the
rapidly developing junior college; in other words, Stanford lias no choice.
Whether one believes that or not, the following discussion of the point
in the report is informing:
At Stanford there is a growing emphasis both in the numbers applying \
and in the work done in the upper reaches of university instruction. With
the striking development of the junior colleges in California and elsewhere !
there is less call for elementary work and more for advanced work. Since j
this movement is of comparatively recent origin and now getting into full
stride, it is quite evident that the decade ahead will be one of utmost signifl- !
cance to the future of all of our American universities. Since Stanford is an
institution of limited endowment, with a limited student group, it is vital that
its plans for the future be made with unusual care. Three-quarters of a
million dollars of the present academic budget comes from tuition fees. It is
imperative that this financial structure be maintained on a sound basis for
the protection of our faculty and of our pension plans. Since there are
already a number of institutions in the state competing with our Lower j
Division and offering, practically without tuition, the same work for which
we demand about three hundred dollars per year, and since the number of
these institutions is growing steadily, readjustment must be made in time J
and in accordance with the events occurring about us. Careful estimates
indicate that there will be an increase in the population of California at the
rate of about 200,000 a year, that there will be a marked increase in the
number of high-school students, and that within 10 years the number of
students doing work in junior colleges or in the Lower Divisions of state
institutions will be in the neighborhood of 50,000. About 10 per cent of the j
graduates of these institutions have been coming to Stanford. In all proba- :
bility some such percentage will be maintained in the future. We can there- i
fore look forward to a student body of approximately the present size made
up of students selected from these extensions of the high schools in the
state or from institutions offering similar work in other parts of the United
States or the world.
By following out the plan for reducing the number of students admitted j
to the lower division and admitting larger numbers to the upper division, it (
seems likely that Stanford University can go through this period of financial j
adjustment without undue strain. It is interesting to note that, with the ;
reduction in the number of new students admitted to the Lower Division for
the academic year J928-29, practically all of the men students applying, who
reached the standard adopted by the committee on admission, were accepted.
The question of the junior college has always seemed to its too

complicated to settle even to our own satisfaction. We should prefer to
see Stanford remain an undergraduate school, devoted almost wholly to'
teaching:, and but incidentally to research. This is a far cry from the 1
present ideal, to he sure, and we are not throwing it out with the expecta
tion that it will instantaneously be adopted. We are not even sure that
President W ilbur is not right in believing abolition of the L.D. inevitable.
\\ hatever is the final decision concerning the Lower Division, it is to
be hoped that the issue will not be decided upon consideration of so
relatively unimportant a thing as athletics. The alumni, as might be ;
expected, are prepared to go to bat upon that point. An article in the last
Illustrated Review points out that not yet has Stanford got an athlete for
varsity football or track as a graduate of a junior college. Students have
transferred here after a year or so in junior college and then become
athletes, but no final production of the junior college has made good
under Warner or Templeton.
Citing the fact that Chicago and Johns Hopkins are coming back
frantically to the good, red-blooded American system, after having tried!
the abolition of the Lower Division, the Rcznew goes on to say that, as j
soon as it shall be shown that abolition of the Lower Division means the j
defection of athletics, "we can proceed to amortize our athletic plant or j
arrange to turn it over as a field for scientific experiments upon the habits 1
and emotions of white mice whe napproaching a piece of cheese on a j
circular course."
