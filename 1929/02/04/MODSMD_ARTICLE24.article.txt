## INGENUITY OUGHT TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Because of the publicity which the
Daily has given to various student
comments upon the recent action
taken by the Student Body on the
tubject of Honor, I turn to its col
umns for answers to several disturb
ing questions.
I have heard, to date, nothing re
garding the procedure a student shall
take if he detects a violation of the
Honor Code in any case except dur
ing an examination. If one has knowl
edge of a person cheating on a term
paper, how shall he warn the guilty
party? He cannot very well tap on
the desk with his pencil, and to per
sonally warn the student may cause
hard feeling. In the class room where
the test is being taken, the identity
of the one who warns is not neces

isarily disclosed, as it must be in this
case. An anonymous note would
! avoid this evil, but would not neces
' .sarily prove effective. After the warn
ing it might be quite difficult to de
termine whether or not the paper
had been turned in.
Occasionally, a violation of the
honor system is not known until the
I papers have been corrected. Should
• the guilty student's name be turned
in to the proper officers? Would he.
if proved guilty, be subject to the
I usual penalty when he has not had
the advantage of a warning? If the
instructor or corrector has evidence
of violation of the Honor Code, is it
his duty to bring the offender to
' light?
i I eagerly await an answer.
Sincerely,
—Louis Janin
