# IN WHAT WAY DOES THIS LETTER DECREASE THE VERBIAGE?
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I am happy to notice that I have
at last found a brother sufferer. A
certain Mr. Born expressed my sen
timents exactly in his "Campus
Opinion" last Thursday. Every morn- j
ing I have looked at the long articles j
pro and con on the question of the !
Bastille vs. Row, and I have long
withheld my disgust from publica- j
tion. Now that Pan-Hellenic has
tabled the issue until women's halls
are built, let us permit the torn
hearts to grieve in peace.
The Honor discussions, too, are I
alp-mingly increasing in length and !
foolishness. They are all full of j
sound and fury signifying absolutely |

I nothing. I would also like to throttle
| all these transfers who persist in de
j fending their name from the accusa
j tion that they are the violators of
! the Code in spite of last Thursday's
i editorial which should end all argu
j ment. I have the same feeling to
j ward all these "pipsqueaks" and their
! feminine opponents.
And while I'm on the subject of
] beautifying the Daily, may I suggest
that on those lean days when the ads
are low, we may have news, features,
or pictures of world events rather
| than those big "fillers" to "patronize
our advertisers, for the Frosh to turn
; out for the Daily staff, or to send the
j Daily home for $2.00 a year"?
I â€”H. H. M.
