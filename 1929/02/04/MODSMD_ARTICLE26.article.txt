# STANFORD WOMEN CAN TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It's just too bad that a lot of she
men should butt in on this Row-Ro
ble question, to say nothing about
who started it.
Mr. Norman and others seem to
feel the ancient and banal urge to j
take care of what they consider to j
be the poor and helpless weaker sex. j
Personally I believe that most Stan- j
ford women can take care of them- |
selves, but if male nurses feel they
are needed they might try to get ap
pointments as sponsors at Roble and
house-FATHERS on the Row.
Why not let the girls run their own
show as they let the men run theirs?
As soon as the girls want to change

| the Row-Roble situation (if there is
i one), they'll do it, and what's more,
; they won't give a public airing of it
| and make a journalistic mountain out
j of a campus molehill.
I second Mr. Horn's motion to leave
I
j the women s affairs to the women,
j even if we have to fill our columns
j with educational (?) articles giving
| Arthur Brisbane definitions of Mon-
I golian Idiots, etc.
—Pax Vobiscum '32
P.S. —I just don't see how we'd get
along without Mr. Norman's senile
j satires, and he is such an inspiration
! for adverse criticism.
Yours,
I —P. V.
