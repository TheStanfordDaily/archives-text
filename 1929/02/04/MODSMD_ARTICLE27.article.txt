# The 						Bullsession
## PUTTING A CHIP ON OUR SHOULDER 
### 
Almost any minute now the Senate i
can be expected to cease orating and
pass the Cruiser Bill, whereupon the
lame ducks and other legislative
quacks will turn to new subjects and
Senators Hiram Johnson and James
Reed can shut up and take a well
earned rest. Most of the few sincere
, Senators who oppose the bill will |
■ probably not vote. For no reason at ;
, all the United States will begin to
build fifteen new cruisers.
Granting that all this American
Eagle speech-making over the bill is
j intended for the ears of constituents,
j nevertheless the advocacy of cruisers
as weapons for prevention of war is;
a pernicious doctrine. The present
I cruiser farce is, on the contrary, a j
definite step toward starting the next
war.
Just what war is this that we are
going to build cruisers to prevent?

I Just where does any immediate pos
! sibility of war exist, except in the
chaotic mind of William Randolph
Hearst? We have sufficient navy no«v
for intimidating South American coun
tries, which is probably the nearest
thing to war that this country will
face for a couple of decades.
The United States is cordially dis
liked by practically every nation in
the world, and tho cruiser farce is
| just a means of adding distrust to
| dislike. A great trouble with our gov
iemmental system is that in addition
to permitting such windbags as Sen
ator Hiram Johnson to toy with
| cruisers and other dangerous play
things, it allows legislative blunders
to receive worldwide publicity. It is
jthe motives attributed to the cruiser
bill by other nations, and not. the
| cruisers themselves, which cause the
| damage.

Hearst has accomplished many
beneficial reforms during his career,
but the good which he has done does
not balance the evil. The fact that
his newspapers have so great effect
upon foreign opinion of us makes
Hearst a menace to America. And
he has returned to his old favo
rite pastime of baiting John Hull,
hinting at possibilities of war with
our best friend, Great Britain.
More than ever lately it would seem
that Hearst, who failed in his person
al ambition to be a Senator, is endeav
oring to set up a supergovernment by
using his papers and his power to
lead legislators by the nose.
When we do get into a war, it
won't be for lack of cruisers, but be
cause of an oversupply of Hearsts and
Johnsons. And this country might be
tlit "Germany" of the next big con
flict. —Winston Norman.
