Nothing Is Sacred. By Josephine
Herbst. (New York. Coward-Mc-
Cann. 1928.)
Harry Norland was far more inter
ested in his life as an executive in
his lodge than as an executive in the j
Fintella breakfast food concern. So
interested, in fact, that his family
and relatives were rudely jolted one j
morning by the news that he had
been using the lodge money for his I
own purposes.
A stereotyped situation, and you
would expect to find this family hang- i
ing over the traditional black abyss !
of ruin and disgrace that seems es- j
sential to "family" type novels. But
Josephine Herbst doesn't have any
use for black abysses. Resentfully and
cynically the Norlands accept their
loss of prestige in the community,
but there is neither tragedy nor drama
in their position. The plot is at all j
times a secondary concern with the
author. She is interested primarily in
revealing ethics of modern married
life as she sees them.
For subject matter she uses three
sisters, their relations with their hus
bands and with each other. She re
fuses to be exciting or idealistic or
emotional about any of these three
families. One household is drab and
loveless, one is openly bitter and an
tagonistic, and the third is torn by i
infidelity.
Three tragedies, it would seem. But
there is no tragedy, for the author j
writes with a direct lucid pen, simply, ;
almost disinterestedly, so that —seen
through her eyes—even the thwart
ing of individual life and the disinte
gration of married life take on a com- i
monplace aspect. Her matter-of-fact
ness about the entire subject of mar- ,
jiage is a little terrifying. Marriage
is abandonment of dreams, compro
mise, disappointment, she generalizes. I
What of it?
The book is good, for it undoubtedly j
is real, yet there is little to laugh at
or thrill over in the ruthless picture !
of life that it gives. Its title was well- )
chosen. —M. L. R.

The Spectacles of Mr. Cagliostro. By
Harry S. Keeler. (New York: E. i
P. Dutton and Company.)

The Dutton mystery book for Janu
ary deals with the sad fate of one
Jerome Middleton, who was undeser
vedly east into a madhouse upon his
arrival from Australia to claim the
ten million dollar estate of his father,
a hig pill and tonic man in Chicago.
Rut alas! Not only did his father
cut him off with but seventy-five dol
lars a month, but he was required to
wear a pair of hideous blue glasses
lor a year. And as though this were
not enough, his girl jilted him, and ,
he was sent to an insane asylum, ;
where numerous eminent psychia- j
trists pronounced him unquestionably
looney.
Since it is not proper to reveal the !
plot of a mystery book, it wouldn't be |
fair to tell you that along about Chap- '
ter XXX these psychiatrists got
shown up dreadfully, affording the au
thor opportunity to make numerous
jibes at psychology „and its practi
tioners.
The book makes intense strains on
one's credulity—so intense, in fact,
that it snaps quite early in the book,
after which you can start enjoying |
the fantastic story, provided you can j
overlook the rather mediocre style
and stilted conversation. —M. S.

Bambi. By FeTix Salten. (New York:
Simon and Schuster. 1928.)

Felix Salten is an outstanding mod- j
ern German playwright and journal- j
ist, as well as a brilliant novelist. His j
"Bambi" has been translated from !
•he German by Whitaker Chambers,
whose English version possesses a I
smoothness and beauty of style rare J
in translations.
Upon first thought, "Bambi's" amaz
ing reception in this country is a lit- j
tie unaccountable. Judging by the !
books that at present rank as best- '
sellers, it would seem that the Ameri- !
can taste was too sophisticated to ac- i
cept this German idyll. .
"Bambi" is quaint, simple, and
charming. It is the story of the life !
of a male deer —all of the adventures i
that he has and all the philosophy ,
that he learns or works out as he 1
grows up in a forest near the Danube. |

Although "Bambi" is sometimes com
pared to Kipling's "Jungle Book," the 1
: two are essentially different. While
"Bambi" is more childlike and naive,
and misses the vitality and dramatic
strength of Kipling, it is far superior
to the "Jungle Book" in grace and
subtlety of thought.
Taking it simply as the annals of
woodland life, it is a lovely thing, for
Felix Salten has an intimate and sym
pathetic knowledge of wild animals.
The quality that makes the book so
delicious, however, is the delicate,
spontaneous humor that runs through
it. The delightful piquancy of this
humor lies in the fact that when the
author on the surface is poking gen
tle fun at the squirrel or the blue
| jay or the rabbit he is underneath
drawing a picture of men and women
that the reader meets and laughs at
j every day. The author feels nature
very deeply, but "Bambi" is some
thing more than a little masterpiece I
among animal tales. It is symbolic of
our own life, and this symbolism is j
moving and beautiful. —M. L. R. i
