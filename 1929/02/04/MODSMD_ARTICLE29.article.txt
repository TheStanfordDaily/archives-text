# BOARD ACCEPTS NORTHWESTERN'S SWIM CHALLENGE
## 
### 
Stanford will accept the challenge j
of Northwestern University to a wa- |
ter polo match and dual swimming
meet, it was decided at the meeting
of the Board of Athletic Control Fri
day night. This decision must be ap
proved by the Faculty Athletic Com- |
mittee. Northwestern will meet the j
Card swimmers in the Encina pool
February 14, at 2:30 o'clock, if proper
arrangements are made.
The Northwesterners are cham- j
pions of the Big Ten both in water i
polo and swimming. With some of ,
the best swimmers in the country, ;
they are touring the west, meeting j
all strong Pacific coast teams. Last
year Stanford defeated their water j
polo team to win the National Inter- \
ccllegiate Championship. With the j
Stanford and Northwestern teams of !
last year practically intact, the battle
is sure to be closely contested
throughout. Captain Reggv Harrison
went with Strong and Thornton to
the Olympic games last year. Two ;
Northwestern men, Schwartz and ;
Colbath, were also on the American
team.
Best in U.S.
In the swimming meet, which will
be held before the water polo game, j
Northwestern will enter what is prob-1
ably the best team in the United ;
States. Stanford's team, although j
weakened by the loss of Pete Des- j
jardins, has been making a very good j
showing in pre-season practice. The j
Stanford boys are counting on an ad- |
vantage over the Eastern team in j
the extra length of the Encina tank, j
The pool here is 100 feet long, where- j
ar the Big Ten rules specify a 60- |
foot pool, With fewer turns in the
longer pool, times will be slower.
Every man on the Northwestern j
team is fairly certain to make points. ;
Ca, ain Walt Colbath, Olympic div-1
ing star, is a very good water polo
man, and strong in the relay. Dick j
Hinch is one of the outstanding back- I
stroke men in the country. Omar j
Miller, another back-stroke swimmer,
is a sophomore and more or less a j
dark horse. A1 Schwartz, who swam
the free style in the Olympics, is J
good for the 100- and 220-yard sprints. 1
He is star forward on the water polo ;
team, and is quite evenly matched I
with Harrison of Stanford. Harrison j
beat hirn in the 1928 Intercollegiate ]
meet, while the tables were turned in j
the Stanford-Northwestern dual meet, l
in which Sc hwartz defeated Harrison, j
Peterson New
Don Peterson, another free style j
swimmer, is a new man about whom
little is known. Mark Wicks and Bill
Covode, Northwestern's other free ;
style men, can be counted upon as j
dependable performers. Eddy Lennox j
is a breast-stroke star of the first i
magnitude. But the longer pool may j
l'ool him.
Against this powerful aggregation,
Stanford will enter an imposing team.
Captain Reggy Harrison, Hal Bramel, |
Dave Morey, and Dick Lucy will take j
care of the sprints. Ogden Driggs :
and Barret Brown can be counted on j
for points in the distance swims..
With Jimmy Penfield and Sandy
Smith they will do the same in the
back-stroke race. In the breast-stroke
Stanford will accept the challenge j

ter polo match and dual swimming
meet, it was decided at the meeting
