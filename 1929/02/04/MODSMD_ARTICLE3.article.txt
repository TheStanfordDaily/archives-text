# Wilbur Is Silent Over Rumor Of Cabinet Position
## Dr. Robert Swain Considered As Possible Successor To University Post 
### 
President Wilbur, in spite of in
creasing "authoritative" reports, con
tinues to maintain silence regarding
the assertion that he wifl be appointed
to Hoover's Cabinet as Secretary of
the Interior. He has refused to make
(any statements concerning the Cabi
i net post, or whether he will resign
from the presidency of the University
I if he joins Hoover in Washington.
It is believed here that this will be
one of the questions to be decided by
the Stanford Board of Trustees when
it meets in San Francisco Thursday,
February 14.
Reports Unofficial
No official reports concerning the
matter have been released for publi
cation to date. What little informa
tion that has been obtained is based
more on conjecture than fact. Some
of these unofficial reports declare
that Dr. Wilbur will receive the ap
pointment and that he will accept the
position. It is believed, however, that
he will not resign from his position
as head of the University, but that
lie will apply to the Board of Trustees
for a leave of absence during the term
of his duties in Washington; and that
j an acting president will be appointed
| in his place for the period of his ab-
I sence.
That Robert E. Swain, head of the
i Department of Cliemistdy, will be
| chosen "acting president" of the Uni
i vcrsity in President Wilbur's absence,
j is the belief of one San Francisco
i newspaper that purports to have "au
! thoritative information." Dr. Swain
1 lias frequently served as acting presi
dent of the University in recent ab
| sences of Dr. Wilbur on University
I and governmental business.
Hoover's Election
It is generally understood, accord
ing to the report, that President-elect
Hoover has a definite reorganization
plan in mind for the Department of
the Interior and that he desires to
have his close friend, Dr. Wilbur, un
dertake the task. It has been pointed
out that I)r. Wilbur might not care
to continue for a long period as a
member of the Cabinet and that his
successor in office at Stanford would
for a time be designated only as the
"acting president."
Until Dr. Wilbur has adjusted him
self to the new order of things as a
member of the Cabinet, the dispatch
continues, he would be granted a

leave of absence from his university
duties, making it possible for him to
I return to the presidency of Stanford
j if he so desired.
It will be possible for Dr. Wilbur
| to avail himself of a leave of absence
without severing his connection with j
Stanford and thereby giving up future 1
retirement privileges under the Car
negie Foundation.
Dr. Swain holds advanced degrees
; from Yale as well as his diploma
lrom Stanford. He has also studied
at Strassburg and Heidelberg. lie
has been a member of the Stanford I
faculty since 1898 and has won pro- .
motion through the professorial grades 1
! to the executive position in the chem
| istry department.
He is a member of many national |
| educational bodies, of Phi Beta Kappa
scholarship faternity; was lecturer
and medalist at Columbia University
in 1923, and visiting lecturer at the 1
University of Arizona in 1925.
Dr. Swain was born at Hollister,
San Benito county.
