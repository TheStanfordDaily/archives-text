# SPORTS OF 1929
## A
						Marvel of the '80's 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Lawrence E. Myers, more familiarly |
known as "Lon," is merely a name
on the record books to most followers
of track athletics, but to those who
lived in the Eighties he was the sen
sation of two hemispheres and easily |
the greatest and most versatile of all
runners.
Most of us are interested when we
first read his name as the winner of i
the national hundred-yard champion
ship in 18S0 and 1881, and as 220-,
yard champion in '79, '80, '81, and '84, |
although Bernie Wefers won that ;
many outdoor sprint titles. But when |
we notice that L. E. Myers also won
llie 440-yard run in 1879, 18S0; '81, '82,
'83, and '84, Ave begin to realize what !
a great runner he was, and when we ,
see his name enrolled as half-mile
champion in 1879, 1880, and '84, our
interest and admiration gives way to
astonishment and wonder. What a j

| man he was! Fifteen times United
States champion, as well as holder
of ten Canadian and three English
titles!
After he won the 220, 440, and 880-
yard races at the American cham
pionships in 1879, authorities and ex
perts predicted his early demise, as
serting that he could not possibly last
at that pace. So the next year he ran
seven times in one day at the "Na
tionals," winning the two sprints and
the quarter and half, and a week later
| won the same four races at the Cana
dian championship.
i Six years later he was still good
enough to defeat W. G. George, the
famous Englishman, who held the
I world's mile record of 4:12%, in the
| half, three quarters, and mile at Madi
son Square Garden. George had pre
viously beaten Myers in two out of
three races in 1882, when botli were
J amateurs.
