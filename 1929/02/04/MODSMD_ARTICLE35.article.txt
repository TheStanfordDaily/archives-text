# FEBRUARY ISSUE OF CHAPARRAL ON SALE THIS WEEK
## 
### 
"I have been so overwhelmed, the
last few weeks, by the contributions
to the theatre fund and have spent
so much time in counting: all the
scheckels," said the Old Boy yester- !
day as he closed the door of his safe
on his long gray beard, "that I was
not able to specialize in our line for
the February Chaparral nor confine i
my wit to any certain channel."
Chappie's next issue will be out in
(laming red sometime this week and
will be a conglomeration of heterogene- J
ous humor. Link Malmquist, art editor
of the publication, has drawn a bril- J
liant conception of the Chappie sales- j
lady exhibiting her wares â€”just one
of those covers that go on and on
forever. That rising young etcher, j
Burnell Gould, has made a full page j
of illustrated puns and Herb Hey- j
nolds has spread his hen tracks to j
form a border around a poem by
Helen Stanford.
Nelson Carter has written an arti- |
cle on "some very interesting old I
French tapestries." The tapestries, it
is understood, have been recently un
covered and were immediately buried i
again. Another contribution is that of
Bob Paine entitled "The Mauve Mur-1
der Case," and among the editorials
is found a complete list of the theatre i
fund contributions and a diagnosis of
the future outlook toward the com-<
pletion of the long-awaited campus
theatre.
