# FRESHMAN HOOP TEAM WINS FROM MENLO JR. FIVE
## 
### 
Stanford's yearling basketball quin
tet added another scalp to its already |
bountiful collection last Friday night
when it defeated the Menlo Junior
College five by a score of 45 to 11 in
the Cardinal pavilion.
The visitors were a little slow in
getting started, the count standing at |
I 25 to 0 before the junior college team :
made its initial basket. At this point
the cheering lasted for nearly five j
minutes, and the freshmen took time
out to talk things over. The rally -
! was stopped short, however, the first |
! half ending with the score at 29 to 2. â€¢
A1 Ray, babe forward, took high ;
j point honors with 9 tallies; while j
j Shrader and Doub were close behind j
with 8 points each. Phil Baker, year- |
ling captain, did not play, being kept |
out of the game by a bad foot.
The Menlo offense looked good un
til it got to the middle of the fioor, at
; which point the forwards had to ei- j
ther shoot or loose the ball. Heatly \
and Keenan were outstanding for the |
i visitors, scoring 4 points apiece.
