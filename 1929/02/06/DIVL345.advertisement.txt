are no longer confined to the
tender messages of the love-sick
swain or the fond maiden. They
now run through all the emo
-1 tions from love to laughter.
Our stock is large and
varied, ranging from the
antique to modernistic.
Here you will find sentiments
that fit the entire human fam
ily, from father to flapper, not
forgetting, of course, the sweet
heart —and they are all very
reasonably priced.
Come in and look them
over. You will find them
entertaining.
