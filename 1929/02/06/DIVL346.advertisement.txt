Serial Vtew of Chicago, 111.
The Metropolitan City of the West |
Chicago is a wonder city. It has grown like the proverbial mush- ||
room — prairie giving place to pavement and tall buildings rising p
on every side.
The Otis organization has contributed in no small degree to this
amazing record of growth. Jn keeping with the fact that "most of the J*
famous buildings of the world are Otis-equipped" Chicago's major H
commercial structures reflect the trend toward safe and speedy Verti
cal Transportation with maximum safety.
State Street, Broadway, Picadilly — every famous street through- ||
out the world—is lined with buildings wherein Otis Elevators are giving p
daily service in a safe, trouble-free manner—concrete examples of this
company's determination to build nothing but the best — and the best m
is none too good to bear the world-famous Otis trade mark. p
