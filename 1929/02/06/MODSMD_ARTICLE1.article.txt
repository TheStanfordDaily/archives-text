A Gray Fog settled over Stanford
last night and when it lifted the Card
inal basketball team was left de
feated 30 to 23 for the twelfth con
secutive victory for the St. Ignatius
players.
Although the Gray Fog threatened
to overcome the Cardinal cagers dur
ing the first half and the beginning
of the second, the Redshirts pulled
themselves out of it and drove
through the fog to amass nine points
in the final four minutes of play. An
estimated crowd of 3000 basketball
fans saw the Cards whip themselves
into action and stage a great come
back.
The one man for Stanford who
helped ward oft' the St. Ignatius inva
sion in the first half was Don Tyler,
who scored nine points for the Cardi
nals. The Gray Fog team had made
eighteen digits when the bell rang,
ending the first period.
Lead Changes Often
Starting out with a conservative
brand of basketball, the Cardinals bat
tled on even terms with Jimmy
Needles' team in the opening minutes
of the game. The lead changed hands
lour times with the Stanford players
in the open twice. It looked as if the
Kedshirts were going to take their
second straight victory over St. Igna
tius, but the Gray Fog men were not
to be denied.
Captain Rothert, who had been the
mainstay of the Stanford defense by
virtue of his jumping higher on the
tip-off and getting the ball to a Card
player, was pulled out of the game
and Reynolds substituted for him. The
More stood at 14 to 9 at this point
in favor of the visitors.
The Gray Fog players came back
with a smooth passing attack laid
down behind a barrage of shots at
the basket and counted for four more
points before the period ended.
The St. Ignatius quintet came back
in the second half and increased their
lead to 27 points while the Cards
made an additional basket to raise
their count up to eleven. Combining
smooth passing with long range shots,
the Gray Fog players raised their bal
ance to 30 with the Redshirts trail
ing at 16. Then Fawcett, forward,
found his eye and broke through the
opposing defense to sink three bas
kets, while Reynolds made a foul
shot good to give the Cardinals their
final score of 23.
Tyler was the high-point man for
Stanford and for the evening, making
12 counts in all. Maloney, Gray Fog
forward, was a close second with 11
points.
Considering that Stanford was up
against the supposedly strongest
team on the Pacific Coast, her play
ers gave a good account of them-
J selves. St. Ignatius beat California
i li 2to 24, which might indicate that
the Cards have a narrow edge to win
j Saturday night's battle with the
! Golden Bear, if comparative scores
j mean anything. However, it is a safe ;
j f-'uess of all the sideline coaches that
! the Bears will have tougher sledding
I this time than they did two weeks I
I ago, if the Cardinals play the kind of
; ball they played tonight.
