# WILBUR SUBMITS FACULTY REPORT ON HONOR CODE
## Regulation of Examination Type Called Student Responsibility 
### 
President Wilbur yesterday read to
1 the Honor Code committee a report
; which serves as a faculty reply to
j the committee's recommendations as
i to what the faculty might do to aid
! in strengthening of the Honor Code.
The President's reply traces the his
tory of the establishment of the
Honor System in 1921, in which it is
set forth that the responsibility for
conduct in academic work was ac
cepted by the students. Arguing from
t his, Dr. Wilbur declared that regula-1
: tion of the type of examination is an
; evasion of the problem, which is
simply a student responsibility to
conduct examinations honestly. The
report may be regarded as an expres
sion of the faculty attitude toward the
Honor Code.
Addressed to the chairman of the
I Honor System committee, it follows:
"Pursuant to the request of your
committee, your communication to
the faculty under date of January 4,
1929, was read at a recent meeting
of the Academic Council and referred
to the Executive Committee of the
Council. At a meeting of the Execu
tive Committee held January 31st,
your communication and the Honor
System at Stanford were the subjects
| of discussion. The Committee unani
mously requested me to communicate
| with you to the following effect:
"The Honor System was established
at Stanford University by action of
! the Academic Council on May 23, 1921,
in accordance with the following plan:
"1. Responsibility for honesty in
the conduct of examinations is as
sumed by the students of the Univer
sity, such responsibility to be known
i as the Honor System.
"2. The primary responsibility for
j the Honor System rests upon each in
i dividual student who is pledged not
1 to receive or give aid in examina-1
tions.
1 "3. Collective responsibility for the !
Honor System within a department of ,
the University should be accepted by 1
the major students of that depart
ment. Through existing departmental
organizations or otherwise such ma
jor students should take special cafe
that the system is conserved and
strengthened within the department.
It is hoped that they may receive the
encouragement and co-operation of
the instructors in the department in
their efforts to this end.
"4. The Student Councils shall have
general supervisory control over the
conduct of examinations, and may
adopt regulations and suggestions for
the same. Such control may be exer
cised through the department groups
of major students, wherever such
method is found to be effective. Hut
when need arises, the Council shall
take direct control of the conduct of
examinations in a particular course or
group of courses.
"5. The Student Council shall, with
the approval of the President of the
University, prepare a statement for
all new students to sign, such state
ment to be included among the Regis
trar's matriculation blanks; and rules
and suggestions for the conduct of
examinations to be printed upon the
examination blanks furnished by the
University.
"6. Infractions of the Honor Sys
tem shall be dealt with by the Stu
dent Councils in the same manner as
other cases of discipline.
"7. The upper division students
shall create a committee to be known
as the Honor System Committee,
which shall arrange for assemblies of
new students early in each quarter for
the purpose of explaining the Honor
System; shall promote the organiza
in the departments; -shall prepare a
students to conserve the system with
in the dpeartments; shall prepare a
statement concerning the Honor Sys
tem to be printed in the freshman
handbook; and shall assume leader
ship in developing and strengthening
student opinion and responsibility
with regard to the Honor System.
"8. Responsibility for honesty in
examinations is hereby placed upon
the students of the University.
"9. The instructor shall provide a
room where the examination may be
held without crowding, or two sets of
questions may be used in alternate
seats, or examinations in two differ
ent courses may be given in the same I
room, the students in different courses :
alternating. After the questions have '
been presented and inquiries an
swered the instructor shall withdraw
from the room.
"You will note from the above that
the responsibility for honesty in ex-,
animations is placed upon the stu- j
dents of the University. It was so ac- j
cepted by the students and for some ;
years there has been a relaxation in
student responsibility for the main
tenance of the Honor System, and an
increasing number of violations. This |
has been due to a failure of the stu-!
dents to meet the obligation and re-j
sponsibility which they accepted.
"Insofar as the criticism which
your communication contained, and:
the suggestions there made, are con- j
cerned, they have reference to edu- 1
rational standards or the technique j
of examinations. Whatever they are, l
and whether they are incomplete or |
faulty, they apply equally and alike j
to all members of the student body. ;
Changes may or may not facilitate the j
detection of cheaters; but the essen- |
tial thing is honesty on the part ot' J
the students and individual accept- j
ance of their responsibility To pre-;
sent various excuses for cheating is
not to meet the spirit of the Honor
System. The control of this System
is in the hands of the students, and j
they are in the position to attempt j
such measures as they think neces- !
sary to detect and discard those who j
are unable to deal honestly with j
their fellow students. Any plans which i:
the Honor System Committee or the j
Student Council will suggest will be ;
given earnest consideration by the! i
University authorities. i
"The essence of the whole question i
is this: Do the students want to play :
fair with each other and with thej.
University and maintain and enforce j
a uniform Honor System or Code? If ;
they do, they can readily bring this ;
about; but they cannot do so by try-]
ing to unload the responsibility on '
to the faculty or on to anyone else. 1
"The Stanford diploma of last year j
had a dusky hue; the one this year j
will not be white. It is entirely within
the power of the students to make j
this right.
"I am informed by the Executive j
Committee of the Academic Council
that there is no desire on the part of i
the faculty to take over the control
of examinations. If the students will
not meet the situation, however, a
system of proctors will have to be
installed, and the University will ,
have to do the best that it can to pro
tect the Stanford degree.
"For myself, I might say that quib
bling about pledges, "systems," hard
examinations, trick questions, and
that sort of thing, are natural enough;
but they indicate a failure to grasp
the essential thing, which is: Do the
students of Stanford want to have
the great satisfactions and advan- ,

tapes of a universal and successful
Honor System ,or do they not?
"1 shall be very glad to assist in
working out conditions that will pro
tect the weakling from undue tempta
tion. If the weakling or the new stu
dent finds in his classroom and his 1
residence hall, or fraternity house, 1
the proper honor spirit attitude, the I
number of violations will be few, and
the violators easily shown the edge j
of the campus.
"Very truly yours,
"RAY LYMAN WILBUR, i
"President." !

take direct control of the conduct of

examinations to be printed upon the

alternating. After the questions have '
been presented and inquiries an
swered the instructor shall withdraw
from the room.
"You will note from the above that
the responsibility for honesty in ex-,
animations is placed upon the stu- j
dents of the University. It was so ac- j
cepted by the students and for some ;
years there has been a relaxation in
student responsibility for the main
tenance of the Honor System, and an
increasing number of violations. This |
has been due to a failure of the stu-!

sponsibility which they accepted.
"Insofar as the criticism which
your communication contained, and:
the suggestions there made, are con- j

rational standards or the technique j
of examinations. Whatever they are, l

faulty, they apply equally and alike j
to all members of the student body. ;
Changes may or may not facilitate the j

the students and individual accept- j

are unable to deal honestly with j

the Honor System Committee or the j
Student Council will suggest will be ;

is this: Do the students want to play :
fair with each other and with thej.
University and maintain and enforce j
a uniform Honor System or Code? If ;
they do, they can readily bring this ;
about; but they cannot do so by try-]
ing to unload the responsibility on '

of examinations. If the students will
not meet the situation, however, a
system of proctors will have to be
installed, and the University will ,
have to do the best that it can to pro
tect the Stanford degree.
"For myself, I might say that quib
bling about pledges, "systems," hard
examinations, trick questions, and
that sort of thing, are natural enough;

The President's reply traces the his

set forth that the responsibility for

simply a student responsibility to

President Wilbur yesterday read to
1 the Honor Code committee a report
; which serves as a faculty reply to
j the committee's recommendations as
i to what the faculty might do to aid
! in strengthening of the Honor Code.
The President's reply traces the his
tory of the establishment of the
Honor System in 1921, in which it is
set forth that the responsibility for
conduct in academic work was ac
cepted by the students. Arguing from
t his, Dr. Wilbur declared that regula-1
: tion of the type of examination is an
; evasion of the problem, which is
simply a student responsibility to
conduct examinations honestly. The
report may be regarded as an expres
sion of the faculty attitude toward the
Honor Code.
Addressed to the chairman of the
I Honor System committee, it follows:
"Pursuant to the request of your
committee, your communication to
the faculty under date of January 4,
1929, was read at a recent meeting
of the Academic Council and referred
to the Executive Committee of the
Council. At a meeting of the Execu
tive Committee held January 31st,
your communication and the Honor
System at Stanford were the subjects
| of discussion. The Committee unani
mously requested me to communicate
| with you to the following effect:
"The Honor System was established
at Stanford University by action of
! the Academic Council on May 23, 1921,
in accordance with the following plan:
"1. Responsibility for honesty in
the conduct of examinations is as
sumed by the students of the Univer
sity, such responsibility to be known
i as the Honor System.
"2. The primary responsibility for
j the Honor System rests upon each in
i dividual student who is pledged not
1 to receive or give aid in examina-1
tions.
1 "3. Collective responsibility for the !
Honor System within a department of ,
the University should be accepted by 1
the major students of that depart
ment. Through existing departmental
organizations or otherwise such ma
jor students should take special cafe
that the system is conserved and
strengthened within the department.
It is hoped that they may receive the
encouragement and co-operation of
the instructors in the department in
their efforts to this end.
"4. The Student Councils shall have
general supervisory control over the
conduct of examinations, and may
adopt regulations and suggestions for
the same. Such control may be exer
cised through the department groups
of major students, wherever such
method is found to be effective. Hut
when need arises, the Council shall
take direct control of the conduct of
examinations in a particular course or
group of courses.
"5. The Student Council shall, with
the approval of the President of the
University, prepare a statement for
all new students to sign, such state
ment to be included among the Regis
trar's matriculation blanks; and rules
and suggestions for the conduct of
examinations to be printed upon the
examination blanks furnished by the
University.
"6. Infractions of the Honor Sys
tem shall be dealt with by the Stu
dent Councils in the same manner as
other cases of discipline.
"7. The upper division students
shall create a committee to be known
as the Honor System Committee,
which shall arrange for assemblies of
new students early in each quarter for
the purpose of explaining the Honor
System; shall promote the organiza
in the departments; -shall prepare a
students to conserve the system with
in the dpeartments; shall prepare a
statement concerning the Honor Sys
tem to be printed in the freshman
handbook; and shall assume leader
ship in developing and strengthening
student opinion and responsibility
with regard to the Honor System.
"8. Responsibility for honesty in
examinations is hereby placed upon
the students of the University.
"9. The instructor shall provide a
room where the examination may be
held without crowding, or two sets of
questions may be used in alternate
seats, or examinations in two differ
ent courses may be given in the same I
room, the students in different courses :
alternating. After the questions have '
been presented and inquiries an
swered the instructor shall withdraw
from the room.
"You will note from the above that
the responsibility for honesty in ex-,
animations is placed upon the stu- j

President Wilbur yesterday read to
1 the Honor Code committee a report
; which serves as a faculty reply to
j the committee's recommendations as
i to what the faculty might do to aid
! in strengthening of the Honor Code.
The President's reply traces the his
tory of the establishment of the
Honor System in 1921, in which it is
set forth that the responsibility for
conduct in academic work was ac
cepted by the students. Arguing from
t his, Dr. Wilbur declared that regula-1
: tion of the type of examination is an
; evasion of the problem, which is
simply a student responsibility to
conduct examinations honestly. The
report may be regarded as an expres
sion of the faculty attitude toward the
Honor Code.
Addressed to the chairman of the
I Honor System committee, it follows:
"Pursuant to the request of your
committee, your communication to
the faculty under date of January 4,
1929, was read at a recent meeting
of the Academic Council and referred
to the Executive Committee of the
Council. At a meeting of the Execu
tive Committee held January 31st,
your communication and the Honor
System at Stanford were the subjects
| of discussion. The Committee unani
mously requested me to communicate
| with you to the following effect:
"The Honor System was established
at Stanford University by action of
! the Academic Council on May 23, 1921,
in accordance with the following plan:
"1. Responsibility for honesty in
the conduct of examinations is as
sumed by the students of the Univer
sity, such responsibility to be known
i as the Honor System.
"2. The primary responsibility for
j the Honor System rests upon each in
i dividual student who is pledged not
1 to receive or give aid in examina-1
tions.
1 "3. Collective responsibility for the !
Honor System within a department of ,
the University should be accepted by 1
the major students of that depart
ment. Through existing departmental
organizations or otherwise such ma
jor students should take special cafe
that the system is conserved and
strengthened within the department.
It is hoped that they may receive the
encouragement and co-operation of
the instructors in the department in
their efforts to this end.
"4. The Student Councils shall have
general supervisory control over the
conduct of examinations, and may
adopt regulations and suggestions for
the same. Such control may be exer
cised through the department groups
of major students, wherever such
method is found to be effective. Hut
when need arises, the Council shall
take direct control of the conduct of
examinations in a particular course or
group of courses.
"5. The Student Council shall, with
the approval of the President of the
University, prepare a statement for
all new students to sign, such state
ment to be included among the Regis
trar's matriculation blanks; and rules
and suggestions for the conduct of
examinations to be printed upon the
examination blanks furnished by the
University.
"6. Infractions of the Honor Sys
tem shall be dealt with by the Stu
dent Councils in the same manner as
other cases of discipline.
"7. The upper division students
shall create a committee to be known
as the Honor System Committee,
which shall arrange for assemblies of
new students early in each quarter for
the purpose of explaining the Honor
System; shall promote the organiza
in the departments; -shall prepare a
students to conserve the system with
in the dpeartments; shall prepare a
statement concerning the Honor Sys
tem to be printed in the freshman
handbook; and shall assume leader
ship in developing and strengthening
student opinion and responsibility
with regard to the Honor System.
"8. Responsibility for honesty in
examinations is hereby placed upon
the students of the University.
"9. The instructor shall provide a
room where the examination may be
held without crowding, or two sets of
questions may be used in alternate
seats, or examinations in two differ
ent courses may be given in the same I
room, the students in different courses :
alternating. After the questions have '
been presented and inquiries an
swered the instructor shall withdraw
from the room.
"You will note from the above that
the responsibility for honesty in ex-,
animations is placed upon the stu- j
dents of the University. It was so ac- j
cepted by the students and for some ;
years there has been a relaxation in
student responsibility for the main
tenance of the Honor System, and an
increasing number of violations. This |
has been due to a failure of the stu-!
dents to meet the obligation and re-j
sponsibility which they accepted.
"Insofar as the criticism which
your communication contained, and:
the suggestions there made, are con- j
cerned, they have reference to edu- 1
rational standards or the technique j
of examinations. Whatever they are, l
and whether they are incomplete or |
faulty, they apply equally and alike j
to all members of the student body. ;
Changes may or may not facilitate the j
detection of cheaters; but the essen- |
tial thing is honesty on the part ot' J
the students and individual accept- j
ance of their responsibility To pre-;
sent various excuses for cheating is
not to meet the spirit of the Honor
System. The control of this System
is in the hands of the students, and j
they are in the position to attempt j
such measures as they think neces- !
sary to detect and discard those who j
are unable to deal honestly with j
their fellow students. Any plans which i:
the Honor System Committee or the j
Student Council will suggest will be ;
given earnest consideration by the! i
University authorities. i
"The essence of the whole question i
is this: Do the students want to play :
fair with each other and with thej.
University and maintain and enforce j
a uniform Honor System or Code? If ;
they do, they can readily bring this ;
about; but they cannot do so by try-]
ing to unload the responsibility on '
to the faculty or on to anyone else. 1
"The Stanford diploma of last year j
had a dusky hue; the one this year j
will not be white. It is entirely within
the power of the students to make j
this right.
"I am informed by the Executive j
Committee of the Academic Council
that there is no desire on the part of i
the faculty to take over the control
of examinations. If the students will
not meet the situation, however, a
system of proctors will have to be
installed, and the University will ,
have to do the best that it can to pro
tect the Stanford degree.
"For myself, I might say that quib
bling about pledges, "systems," hard
examinations, trick questions, and
