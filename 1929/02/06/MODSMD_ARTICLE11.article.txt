After playing: ordinary basketball I
; lor the first three quarters of the con- j
| test, Stanford's freshman cage quintet |
i managed to rouse itself in the final |
! five minutes of play to score a hard, !
i j
[ but well-earned victory over the St. J
Ignatius babes. The final count was
j 25-17. The game was a fight from the
1 tip-off and the Gray Fog youngsters
i led most of the time. At half-time i
I
i the score was tied at 10-10.
Bill Doub, sturdy Cardinal center,
j was high-point man of the contest 1
; with seven counters to his credit. A1
Ray, who was substituted at forward -
position for Jim Kelly, tied for second
place with Bud Garigan of the Saints. ;
j Each man scored five points.
At no time was it to be denied that
Stanford had the superior team, but
during the majority of the contest the 1
boys from San Francisco received the
i "breaks" of the game. Rarely did the
Gray Fog forwards break through the :
Cardinal defense, but practically all
I their points were scored from long j
j SllOtS.
As the basis of the Stanford de
fense are Captain Phil Baker and
J Rudy Rintala, these two men well
j demonstrated their ability last night, j
Seldom St. Ignatius allowed a "fol- [
j low-up" shot. Rintala also proved a i
I real scoring threat. Twice he looped
difficult shots from the center of the
j floor.
Bud Garigan and "Red" Maloney
[ starred for St. Ignatius. The Gray
i Fog five were outweighed by Stan-
I ford, but had sufficient speed to over-
I come this handicap.
