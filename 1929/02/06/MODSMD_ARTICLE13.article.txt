# Use Of Radium In Cancer Cure Puzzles Doctors
## Dr. Kofoid Lectures on Film Illustrating Effect of Mineral on Cells 
### 
"Science accepts the treatment of can- j
cer by radium, but the technique of its j
application is the chief field for research j
in that line," declared Dr. Charles A. j
Kofoid, head of the Department of Zool- |
ogy at the University of California, in !
his presentation last night of the Canti ,
film on "The Effect of Radium on Nor- j
mal Cells and on Those from Cancer."
The film, which demonstrated the prac- j
ticability for scientific and educational
purposes of the photographing of dynam- j
ic phenomena under the microscope, was I
made by Dr. Canti of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, London, in connection with the |
laboratory and the Imperial Research In- I
stitution. It shows that while radium i
kills both healthy and diseased cells, it ;
causes the death of the latter much more \
rapidly.
Three reels dealing with normal cells, I
cancer cells, and radium treated cells |
were shown by Dr. Kofoid. The last reel, |
which was recently sent Dr. Canti to re- I
place an older one, contained some of the ;
remarkable movements of pigment gran- !
ules, the structures in the cells of the j
retina of the eye, and the movements of
the amoeba of amoebic dysenteriae.
The cells shown were magnified 48,000'
times, and the action of the cells was j
speeded up 960 times to accentuate their j
progress. Three years of intensive work i
on the part of many men were needed to
produce this photography of living cells ;
in the culture media, it was pointed out !
by Dr. Kofoid. The motion pictures bring ;
a fourth dimension, that of time, to ex- j
ploration. The cells arc real in the pic
tures, but unreal in their rate of growth
as presented on the screen.
The film has been shown at the Lister
Anniversary meeting of the British Med
ical Association in Edinburgh, at the
eleventh Zoological Congress in Buda
pest, and recently at Pomona College. A :
repetition of the showing was demanded I
at these places.

stitution. It shows that while radium i
kills both healthy and diseased cells, it ;
causes the death of the latter much more \
rapidly.
Three reels dealing with normal cells, I
cancer cells, and radium treated cells |
were shown by Dr. Kofoid. The last reel, |
which was recently sent Dr. Canti to re- I
place an older one, contained some of the ;
remarkable movements of pigment gran- !
ules, the structures in the cells of the j
retina of the eye, and the movements of
the amoeba of amoebic dysenteriae.
The cells shown were magnified 48,000'
times, and the action of the cells was j
speeded up 960 times to accentuate their j
progress. Three years of intensive work i
on the part of many men were needed to
produce this photography of living cells ;
in the culture media, it was pointed out !
by Dr. Kofoid. The motion pictures bring ;
a fourth dimension, that of time, to ex- j
ploration. The cells arc real in the pic
tures, but unreal in their rate of growth
as presented on the screen.
The film has been shown at the Lister
Anniversary meeting of the British Med
ical Association in Edinburgh, at the
eleventh Zoological Congress in Buda
pest, and recently at Pomona College. A :
repetition of the showing was demanded I
at these places.

"Science accepts the treatment of can- j
cer by radium, but the technique of its j
application is the chief field for research j
in that line," declared Dr. Charles A. j
Kofoid, head of the Department of Zool- |
ogy at the University of California, in !
his presentation last night of the Canti ,
film on "The Effect of Radium on Nor- j
mal Cells and on Those from Cancer."
The film, which demonstrated the prac- j
ticability for scientific and educational
purposes of the photographing of dynam- j
ic phenomena under the microscope, was I
made by Dr. Canti of St. Bartholomew's
Hospital, London, in connection with the |
laboratory and the Imperial Research In- I
stitution. It shows that while radium i
kills both healthy and diseased cells, it ;
causes the death of the latter much more \
rapidly.
