The faculty neatly answered the honor committee's objections to its
way of conducting examinations by pointing out that the objections were
directed at educational methods, whereas all students need to be con
cerned about is not cheating—the responsibility is entirely theirs to up
hold.
And that is the bald truth of the Honor Code situation. President
Wilbur says in his letter, printed today, that "the essence of the whole
question is this: Do the students want to play fair with each other and
with the University and maintain and enforce a uniform Honor System
or Code? If they do, they can readily bring this about; but they cannot
do so by trying to unload the responsibility onto the faculty or onto any
one else." That's calling the turn. We are glad to see the point empha
sized. It is so simple for every Stanford student to understand, upon
learning for the first time of the existence of the Honor Code, that his
fellows —peers, they are called in law —do not want him to cheat. Even
tually, one comes to conceive of the problem as being a bare matter of
choice —honor or dishonor. When that light dawns on him, he realizes
that asking the faculty to put the jam on a shelf that can't be reached is
evasion of the moral responsibility.
As for the Plan of Establishment of the Honor System which Presi
dent Wilbur quotes in his letter, it is news to us and to most students.
But it is valuable news. Wise is the provision that Upper Division stu
dents shall create a committee which shall arrange assemblies of new
students for the purpose of explaining the Honor System, promote or
ganization of students within major -departments to conserve it, and
assume leadership in developing student opinion to support it. The
Executive Committee, we are assured, will immediately set about organiz
ing a permanent Honor Committee of the very sort. This body will l>e
fairly large and ought to be self-perpetuating, like the Rally Committee,
in order to give it the much-needed continuity with which the plan must
be furnished in order to function successfully.
If an Honor Committee goes seriously, yet rather quietly, about its
job, the few causes for complaint against the 1 lonor Code will be reduced,
and maybe the day will come again when one may know that if he misses
a B grade in an examination, he lost it through his own fault, and not
because someone took advantage of him.
