# More Frequent Assemblies Might Help Unify the Women
## 
### 
The Associated Women decided definitely at Monday's assembly,
first, that the University should be requested to provide adequate housing
for graduate women students, and secondly, that sororities cannot exist
in dormitories. This, then, is the way matters stand for the time being.
The assembly was useful. It brought together the women of the
campus and gave them the opportunity to discuss a question of general
interest. That there was vagueness of thought, and that everyone became
rather muddled as the evening progressed, can readily be explained by
the fact that Stanford women have had only too few occasions to air
their views to the group as a whole.
Because the women voted in favor of their present living conditions
rather than for geographical unity which would result from housing in
dormitories, should not deter any of them from making conscientious
efforts to act together as a compact group in the future. Frequent as
semblies, which allow freedom of discussion, will bring this unity of
feeling and action sooner than by any other means. For it is this pulling
together that a group as small as Stanford's five hundred women should
aim for.
