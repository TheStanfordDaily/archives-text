The present editorial reign ceases with this issue. Volume 74—our
volume —gives place to Volume 75—Wood's volume. We are not at all
tearful about ringing in the new, for getting out this paper has been for
us no sinecure. But while it has been work, at the same time it has been
pleasure, not a little of the latter deriving from association wit a host
of editors and reporters and, yes, even business managers of this v ner
able sheet.
We are happy to leave the Daily in the hands into which it is being
delivered. Calvin Wood has ever done his work faithfully, and he is
deserving of the editorship. At the same time, Jack Hodges, who as
managing editor contested with Wood for the jxisition, has been an able
worker, to whom our thanks go. And then there is that best of all pos
sible women's editors, Elsa Krotozyner. She has displayed such a dis
position as would do credit to Florence Nightingale.
Alas, we find ourself weeping softly over our typewriter. Time out.

THE INCOMING editor wants his staff to meet in the Daily oflicc
at 1:00 o'clock today. Following this, an important session of the After
noon Club is expected to be held.
