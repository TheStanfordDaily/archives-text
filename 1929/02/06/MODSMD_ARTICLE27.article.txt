## ROUGH UNWELCOME AT ROBLE AS WELL AS AT TOYON 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I feel moved to write. It goes with
out saying that I find ample cause for
doing so; hence I ask you to bear 1
with mo. In writing this I speak for
several persons who, like myself, were
"roughing" the Jolly-up at lloble last j
Saturday night. Aside from the total
ignoring of the Stanford Rough tra
dition, this must be necessarily a dis
sertation upon courtesy.
Suffice it to say that Stanford prides ;
itself upon the good breeding of its |
students, and admire signs of that
same good breeding in others. Hack
in the days when we played marbles
in the old brick gutters our mothers
taught us to say please, and did their
best to instill in us that intangible
something called good-breeding. From
then on it has been a tough world.
We learned to say "thank you," and '
noted with mild interest that our dads J
raised their hats when passing lady '
acquaintances.
Now, instead of boys and girls, we
are gentlemen and ladies. Pretty soon
we will have another Roble Jolly-up
and will blossom forth in the clothes

best suited to suit the time and en
hance our personal charm.
To get down to cases, we are forced
to make an example of certain oc-
currences at the last affair. At the
close of a most enjoyable evening
with our acquaintances, several of
us, out of courtesy, thanked the chape
rone for the pleasant evening. We, in
turn, were courteously told that men
were not welcome at the hall who
were not dressed according to the
dictates of fashion or in words to
that effect. "What is wrong with this
picture?" Since when has the Stan
ford rough been subject to criticism?
Does this tradition hold any water,
or is it to be made a farce as some
of the others have been?
This occurrence brings us to the
point of upholding Winston Norman
in his belief that Roble is being made
a Bastille if guests are summarily
courtmarshalled in such manner. It
stands to reason that if the male ele
ment on the campus is to help
remedy the Roble situation such ac
tion will not forward this aim. Out
with a Bullsession. —A ROUGH.

are gentlemen and ladies. Pretty soon
we will have another Roble Jolly-up
and will blossom forth in the clothes

best suited to suit the time and en
hance our personal charm.
To get down to cases, we are forced
to make an example of certain oc-
currences at the last affair. At the
close of a most enjoyable evening
with our acquaintances, several of
us, out of courtesy, thanked the chape
rone for the pleasant evening. We, in
turn, were courteously told that men
were not welcome at the hall who
were not dressed according to the
dictates of fashion or in words to
that effect. "What is wrong with this
picture?" Since when has the Stan
ford rough been subject to criticism?
Does this tradition hold any water,
or is it to be made a farce as some
of the others have been?
This occurrence brings us to the
point of upholding Winston Norman
in his belief that Roble is being made
a Bastille if guests are summarily
courtmarshalled in such manner. It
stands to reason that if the male ele
ment on the campus is to help
remedy the Roble situation such ac
tion will not forward this aim. Out
with a Bullsession. —A ROUGH.
The Editor, Sir:
I feel moved to write. It goes with
out saying that I find ample cause for
doing so; hence I ask you to bear 1
with mo. In writing this I speak for
several persons who, like myself, were
"roughing" the Jolly-up at lloble last j
Saturday night. Aside from the total
ignoring of the Stanford Rough tra
dition, this must be necessarily a dis
sertation upon courtesy.
Suffice it to say that Stanford prides ;
itself upon the good breeding of its |
students, and admire signs of that
same good breeding in others. Hack
in the days when we played marbles
in the old brick gutters our mothers
taught us to say please, and did their
best to instill in us that intangible
something called good-breeding. From
then on it has been a tough world.
We learned to say "thank you," and '
noted with mild interest that our dads J
raised their hats when passing lady '
acquaintances.
Now, instead of boys and girls, we
are gentlemen and ladies. Pretty soon
we will have another Roble Jolly-up
and will blossom forth in the clothes

best suited to suit the time and en
hance our personal charm.
