# THE 						SHATTERING OF A BEAUTIFUL IDEAL
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
My dear Editor, this serves as an
apology, an explanation, and an inter
rogation to those whom it might in
terest.
Being a transfer from a college
whose football teams haven't defeated
the United States Army, nor produced
a President of the United States, 1
have, rooted within me, a notion that
all college campuses are alike funda
mentally, and that the cardinal prin
ciples of loyalty, co-operation, and !
courtesy would serve as well at Stan
ford as at old Podunk.
I have acquired the Stanford spirit
with all of its traditions. I have be
come accustomed to ten-minute hikes
between classrooms, lunches at the
Union, and the traditional "lifts" to
Paly and back. I have found the Stan
ford co-ed as pleasant as she is in
telligent. I frothed with loyal indigna
tion when California's funeral pyre
was prematurely ignited. I worked all
night to build a more imposing con
flagration on the ashes of the old. I
shouted myself hoarse at the rallies,
and lost my head as completely as
any Card rooter when tne scored play
tied us with Cal. A happy four months
of Stanford have found my confidence

in the guiding principles, Loyalty,
Co-operation, and Courtesy, unshaken.
Then I went, to a Iloble Jolly-up.
Having noted with interest that a
part of the male population was pres
ent at all Stanford functions be
sweatered and be-corded as is the
vogue of the rough, I dropped in at
this Jolly-up an hour before it ended,
wearing cords (clean), coat (im
pressed) shoes (shined), socks (silk),
and shirt (without tie). I noted with
relief that I was only one of a dozen
i roughs. After a pleasant dance or two
I helped replace the rugs and pro
ceeded to make my adieus. I consider
this last act a mistake in view of
what was said.
Tell me, Mr. Editor, should I have
said good-bye? Has Roble a back
door? Is the remark, "Guests are not
welcome at my house who are not
dressed up," to be regarded as a play
ful dig, or is it really delightfully
original Stanford repartee to be used
when a stranger Hashes his best com
j pany smile and says, "Had a wonder
ful time; thanks awf'ly"?
You see, I am only a transfer from
Bumholdt State who has found him
self at a loss on a campus where even
one of three old faithful principles
does not work. â€”G. O. R., '30.
