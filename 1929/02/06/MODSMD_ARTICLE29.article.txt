The Editor, Sir: 1
May we have more articles of the |
kind that appeared in Monday's Bull- I
session relative to the proposed build
ing of fifteen new cruisers? When Mr. i
Norman intelligently discusses such
questions of not only national hut in
ternational policy, he earns his East- j
ern fame as a journalist. And let us i
not forget that it may be the privilege i
of a journalist to help persons—even j

only a few college students —to know
the truth regarding our national
status.
Just one word of caution: Mr. Nor
man almost implies that the Hearst
papers are our chief, if not sole,
jingoists; but as one reads some of
the more counterbalanced dailies and
weeklies, it is hard to think that, Mr.
Norman intended such an implication.
Yours for World Peace.
