# BOXING RIGHTLY DUBBED "CINDERELLA"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
You certainly hit the nail on the
head when you dubbed boxing the
"Cinderella" of our athletic family in
your editorial Monday. I was amazed
as well as amused at the inconsistent
stand taken by the authorities with
regard to boxing. As a devotee of the
sport and as an interested member
of the student body, 1 question seri
ously the justification of the action
taken by the faculty in forbidding
members of the varsity boxing team
from participating in their much-an
ticipated series of bouts with repre
sentatives of the U.S. Naval Academy.
Your editorial states that "the kinu
of crowd" which gathers at Madison
Square Garden, New York City, where
the fights were to have been staged
is beneath the dignity of Stanford's
amateur performers, or words to that
effect, and that "it would be unwise
to influence millions of citizens of
New York State who are opposed to
the boxing policy of that state, that
Stanford was taking part in a public
prize fight." These are the ostensible
objections to the proposed bouts with
the Middies, and to me they seem ab
solutely facetious.
As for the "kind of crowd" which
gathers at the Garden, it is positively
no different from the sports-loving,
dignified men and women who assem
bled in the Yankee Stadium in De
cember to witness the Cardinal foot
ball team in its clash with the Army.
Moreover, this crowd is not one whit
less respectable than the one which
entered the Stanford Pavilion a few
days ago from Palo Alto to witness
the Novice Tournament. Furthermore,
as for "influencing millions of people
in New York that Stanford is taking
part in a 'public prize fight'" and a
clean, healthy exchange of blows be
tween virile young collegians. In
other words, intercollegiate "boxing"
is a whale of a lot different from pro
fessional "slugfestß." In the first place,
the boys are fighting for the love of
the sport; there's no money involved.
It's a case of "art for art's sake," in

[this great sport which exhibits manly
! physical and moral qualities at their
highest development. Now the aver
age "thug" who is satiated by blood
thirsty professional fights isn't the
least bit interested in this compara
tively tame activity, and hence he is
usually conspicuous by his absence
at an amateur performance.
Since the "crowd" argument is very
shallow, possibly the real reason for
the faculty's attitude is their personal
objections to boxing as a sport. Maybe
they think it's bad intrinsically. If it
is, then let us by all means abolish
it from the University. I'm sure we
don't want our youth contaminated by
its evil effects. But, if boxing is good
enough to have on this campus, then
it's good enough to have our boys en
gage in it in San Francisco, New
York, or Kalamazoo. If it's good
enough to display here, I don't think
we ought to feel the slightest bit
ashamed or the least bit hesitant
about letting the people of New York
State or any other state for that mat
ter, see what our University is pro
ducing in the way of clever youth
trained in the science of manly de
fense. In fact, we ought to be proud,
very proud indeed, to send our boxers,
just as we are proud to send our foot
ball or baseball men, to perform in
any part of the country. The boys on
the boxing squad are representative
of the best students on the campus,
and to deny them the opportunity of
representing the University in their
chosen sport seems to me to be a
gross injustice as a failure to recog
nize the high status which Coach
Hary Maloney has given the boxing
game at Stanford. Now, possibly I
misunderstand the authorities, per
haps they think boxing at Stanford
is all right. Maybe it's just a matter
of policy to send only football or
track teams back East. If so, I should
like to question the fairness of such
a policy—this policy of encouraging
certain sports or activities to the re
straint of others.

State or any other state for that mat

trained in the science of manly de

very proud indeed, to send our boxers,
just as we are proud to send our foot
ball or baseball men, to perform in
any part of the country. The boys on
the boxing squad are representative
of the best students on the campus,
and to deny them the opportunity of
representing the University in their
chosen sport seems to me to be a
gross injustice as a failure to recog
nize the high status which Coach
Hary Maloney has given the boxing
game at Stanford. Now, possibly I
misunderstand the authorities, per
haps they think boxing at Stanford
is all right. Maybe it's just a matter
of policy to send only football or

a policy—this policy of encouraging
certain sports or activities to the re

The Editor, Sir:
You certainly hit the nail on the
head when you dubbed boxing the
"Cinderella" of our athletic family in
your editorial Monday. I was amazed
as well as amused at the inconsistent
stand taken by the authorities with
regard to boxing. As a devotee of the
sport and as an interested member
of the student body, 1 question seri
ously the justification of the action
taken by the faculty in forbidding
members of the varsity boxing team
from participating in their much-an
ticipated series of bouts with repre
sentatives of the U.S. Naval Academy.
Your editorial states that "the kinu
of crowd" which gathers at Madison
Square Garden, New York City, where
the fights were to have been staged
is beneath the dignity of Stanford's
amateur performers, or words to that
effect, and that "it would be unwise
to influence millions of citizens of
New York State who are opposed to
the boxing policy of that state, that
Stanford was taking part in a public
prize fight." These are the ostensible
objections to the proposed bouts with
the Middies, and to me they seem ab
solutely facetious.
As for the "kind of crowd" which
gathers at the Garden, it is positively
no different from the sports-loving,
dignified men and women who assem
bled in the Yankee Stadium in De
cember to witness the Cardinal foot
ball team in its clash with the Army.
Moreover, this crowd is not one whit
less respectable than the one which
entered the Stanford Pavilion a few
days ago from Palo Alto to witness
the Novice Tournament. Furthermore,
as for "influencing millions of people
in New York that Stanford is taking
part in a 'public prize fight'" and a
clean, healthy exchange of blows be
tween virile young collegians. In
other words, intercollegiate "boxing"
is a whale of a lot different from pro
fessional "slugfestß." In the first place,
the boys are fighting for the love of
the sport; there's no money involved.
It's a case of "art for art's sake," in

[this great sport which exhibits manly
! physical and moral qualities at their
highest development. Now the aver
age "thug" who is satiated by blood
thirsty professional fights isn't the
least bit interested in this compara
tively tame activity, and hence he is
usually conspicuous by his absence
at an amateur performance.
Since the "crowd" argument is very
shallow, possibly the real reason for
the faculty's attitude is their personal
objections to boxing as a sport. Maybe
they think it's bad intrinsically. If it
is, then let us by all means abolish
it from the University. I'm sure we
don't want our youth contaminated by
its evil effects. But, if boxing is good
enough to have on this campus, then
it's good enough to have our boys en
gage in it in San Francisco, New
York, or Kalamazoo. If it's good

is, then let us by all means abolish
it from the University. I'm sure we
don't want our youth contaminated by
its evil effects. But, if boxing is good
enough to have on this campus, then
it's good enough to have our boys en
gage in it in San Francisco, New
York, or Kalamazoo. If it's good
enough to display here, I don't think
we ought to feel the slightest bit
ashamed or the least bit hesitant
about letting the people of New York
State or any other state for that mat

ducing in the way of clever youth
trained in the science of manly de
fense. In fact, we ought to be proud,
very proud indeed, to send our boxers,
just as we are proud to send our foot
ball or baseball men, to perform in
any part of the country. The boys on
the boxing squad are representative
of the best students on the campus,
and to deny them the opportunity of
representing the University in their
chosen sport seems to me to be a
gross injustice as a failure to recog
nize the high status which Coach
Hary Maloney has given the boxing
game at Stanford. Now, possibly I
misunderstand the authorities, per
haps they think boxing at Stanford
is all right. Maybe it's just a matter
of policy to send only football or
track teams back East. If so, I should
like to question the fairness of such
a policy—this policy of encouraging
certain sports or activities to the re
straint of others.

The Editor, Sir:
You certainly hit the nail on the
head when you dubbed boxing the
"Cinderella" of our athletic family in
your editorial Monday. I was amazed
as well as amused at the inconsistent
stand taken by the authorities with
regard to boxing. As a devotee of the
sport and as an interested member
of the student body, 1 question seri
ously the justification of the action
taken by the faculty in forbidding
members of the varsity boxing team
from participating in their much-an
ticipated series of bouts with repre
sentatives of the U.S. Naval Academy.
Your editorial states that "the kinu
of crowd" which gathers at Madison
Square Garden, New York City, where
the fights were to have been staged
is beneath the dignity of Stanford's
amateur performers, or words to that
effect, and that "it would be unwise
to influence millions of citizens of
New York State who are opposed to
the boxing policy of that state, that
Stanford was taking part in a public
prize fight." These are the ostensible
objections to the proposed bouts with
the Middies, and to me they seem ab
solutely facetious.
As for the "kind of crowd" which
gathers at the Garden, it is positively
no different from the sports-loving,
dignified men and women who assem
bled in the Yankee Stadium in De
cember to witness the Cardinal foot
ball team in its clash with the Army.
Moreover, this crowd is not one whit
less respectable than the one which
entered the Stanford Pavilion a few
days ago from Palo Alto to witness
the Novice Tournament. Furthermore,
as for "influencing millions of people
in New York that Stanford is taking
part in a 'public prize fight'" and a
clean, healthy exchange of blows be
tween virile young collegians. In
other words, intercollegiate "boxing"
is a whale of a lot different from pro
fessional "slugfestß." In the first place,
