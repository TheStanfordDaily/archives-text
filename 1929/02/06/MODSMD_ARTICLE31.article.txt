# LET THE UNIVERSITY BUILD ITS OWN PLANES
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
i The plaint of the "Air Minded Grud"
which appeared in your columns last
| Friday should, I think, receive some
recognition due a very potent idea.
The same being the installation of a
course in air-piloting to supplement
| the work of our Aeronautical School.
There are possibilities in that! The
fulfillment of such an idea seems not
alone highly desirable, but equally
practicable. 1 should like to re-point
; out the fact that we have here on the
| campus extremely facilitating condi
| tions for the step, including an air
port, excellent weather conditions,
! and an ever-increasing number of
healthy men who are desirous of
I learning to fly but most of whom can
| not under the present conditions.
That's a fair start. But let's look
into other possibilities. Regardless of
the stimulating natural factors, which
work toward the fulfillment of our
premise, we simply must have an air
plane, and 'planes cost money. A rub —
in fact, two healthy rubs. But —the
major part of the cost of an airplane
lies in the design work done by the
engineer plus the labor overhead
which runs in most factories any
where from 100 to 200 per cent of the
cost of raw materials. The answer is
so simple it hardly seems worth men
tioning. However, for those ignorant
of the fact, let me state that we have
in our faculty four gentlemen with
many years of both theoretical and
practical knowledge, par excellence,
in the field of aviation. We have also
some budding aeronautical engineers.
What's wrong with the idea of hav
ing the latter design and build a
plane under the able and sure direc
tion of Professors Durant, Leslie,
Niles, and Reid? The cost of building
[ in this way—less motor —would be of
! such an order as could be met easily
; in, I feel confident, a number of ways
open to those in charge of construc
tion.
It might well be asked where the 1
rest of the interested student body

| comes in. One obvious path lies
; through the auspices of the R.O.T.C.
under the guidance of Army officers.
• There is in existence, 1 believe, a
course in aviation ground work,
j Would it not be possible for the
R.O.T.C. to obtain air officers to in
struct in flight training, and to have
flight courses as part of the curricu
lum? The fees for such a course, to
cover construction and maintenance
of the plane, most probably would
| not run over five dollars per student
flight hour.
Someone may have noticed in the
! paragraph preceding the last, that
j there was mention made of the cost
iof an airplane "less motor," and in
sc passing may have lifted a knowing
eye-brow. In answer to that I make
jtlie wild guess that the gentle yet
| persistent efforts of some of the pow
ers that be within our cloistered midst
—were they sufficiently interested
could obtain from the Air Service the
loan(?) of not only one but several
serviceable motors to be used in con
nection with the R.O.T.C.
The actual working out of some
such scheme would certainly carry
practical advantages to those of the
student body who availed themselves
of the opportunity to learn the art of
flight. Such advantage would be sec
ond only to those who had aided in
the design and construction of the
ship they were flying. The work car
ried on in the Guggenheim Labora
tory of Aviation would be furthered
by the extra facilities at hand, as
would also the courses of the R.O.T.C.
But there is still another phase that
appears of merit. How about dividends
I for the University as a whole? Sup
i pose there were to be a Flight team
j organized to compete in races, acro
batics, and performances with similar
organizations of other institutions.
Possibilities? Rather!
Besides, some of the boys would
j look pretty cute with a winged "S" on
I tlieir manly chests.

The Editor, Sir:
i The plaint of the "Air Minded Grud"
which appeared in your columns last
| Friday should, I think, receive some
recognition due a very potent idea.
The same being the installation of a
course in air-piloting to supplement
| the work of our Aeronautical School.
There are possibilities in that! The
fulfillment of such an idea seems not
alone highly desirable, but equally
practicable. 1 should like to re-point
; out the fact that we have here on the
| campus extremely facilitating condi
| tions for the step, including an air
port, excellent weather conditions,
! and an ever-increasing number of
healthy men who are desirous of
I learning to fly but most of whom can
| not under the present conditions.
That's a fair start. But let's look
into other possibilities. Regardless of
the stimulating natural factors, which
work toward the fulfillment of our
premise, we simply must have an air
plane, and 'planes cost money. A rub —
in fact, two healthy rubs. But —the
major part of the cost of an airplane
lies in the design work done by the
engineer plus the labor overhead
which runs in most factories any
where from 100 to 200 per cent of the
cost of raw materials. The answer is
so simple it hardly seems worth men
tioning. However, for those ignorant
of the fact, let me state that we have
in our faculty four gentlemen with
many years of both theoretical and
practical knowledge, par excellence,
in the field of aviation. We have also
some budding aeronautical engineers.
What's wrong with the idea of hav
ing the latter design and build a
plane under the able and sure direc
tion of Professors Durant, Leslie,
Niles, and Reid? The cost of building
[ in this way—less motor —would be of
! such an order as could be met easily
; in, I feel confident, a number of ways
open to those in charge of construc
tion.
It might well be asked where the 1
rest of the interested student body

| comes in. One obvious path lies
; through the auspices of the R.O.T.C.
under the guidance of Army officers.
• There is in existence, 1 believe, a
course in aviation ground work,
j Would it not be possible for the
R.O.T.C. to obtain air officers to in
struct in flight training, and to have
flight courses as part of the curricu
lum? The fees for such a course, to
cover construction and maintenance
of the plane, most probably would
| not run over five dollars per student
flight hour.
Someone may have noticed in the
! paragraph preceding the last, that
j there was mention made of the cost
iof an airplane "less motor," and in
sc passing may have lifted a knowing
eye-brow. In answer to that I make
jtlie wild guess that the gentle yet
| persistent efforts of some of the pow
ers that be within our cloistered midst
—were they sufficiently interested
could obtain from the Air Service the
loan(?) of not only one but several
serviceable motors to be used in con
nection with the R.O.T.C.
The actual working out of some
such scheme would certainly carry
practical advantages to those of the

The Editor, Sir:
i The plaint of the "Air Minded Grud"
which appeared in your columns last
| Friday should, I think, receive some
recognition due a very potent idea.
The same being the installation of a
course in air-piloting to supplement
| the work of our Aeronautical School.
There are possibilities in that! The
fulfillment of such an idea seems not
alone highly desirable, but equally
practicable. 1 should like to re-point
; out the fact that we have here on the
| campus extremely facilitating condi
| tions for the step, including an air
port, excellent weather conditions,
! and an ever-increasing number of
healthy men who are desirous of
I learning to fly but most of whom can
| not under the present conditions.
That's a fair start. But let's look
into other possibilities. Regardless of
the stimulating natural factors, which
work toward the fulfillment of our
premise, we simply must have an air
plane, and 'planes cost money. A rub —
in fact, two healthy rubs. But —the
major part of the cost of an airplane
lies in the design work done by the
engineer plus the labor overhead
which runs in most factories any
where from 100 to 200 per cent of the
cost of raw materials. The answer is
so simple it hardly seems worth men
tioning. However, for those ignorant
of the fact, let me state that we have
in our faculty four gentlemen with
many years of both theoretical and
practical knowledge, par excellence,
in the field of aviation. We have also
some budding aeronautical engineers.
What's wrong with the idea of hav
ing the latter design and build a
plane under the able and sure direc
tion of Professors Durant, Leslie,
Niles, and Reid? The cost of building
[ in this way—less motor —would be of
! such an order as could be met easily
; in, I feel confident, a number of ways
open to those in charge of construc
tion.
It might well be asked where the 1
rest of the interested student body

| comes in. One obvious path lies
; through the auspices of the R.O.T.C.
under the guidance of Army officers.
• There is in existence, 1 believe, a
course in aviation ground work,
j Would it not be possible for the
R.O.T.C. to obtain air officers to in
struct in flight training, and to have
flight courses as part of the curricu
lum? The fees for such a course, to
cover construction and maintenance
of the plane, most probably would
| not run over five dollars per student
flight hour.
