"Music Box Review"—Curran.
Dancing, girls, chorus singing,
risque sketches —the new show at the
Curran is the average musical revue.
If you liked "Gay Faree" you probably
will enjoy this. Lupino Lane, star of
two-reel movie comedies, is the fea
tured actor. He is really most amus
ing, has a good line, and falls all over
the stage in a marvelous manner. Mr.

Lane is just about the only reason for
seeing the "Music Box Revue" —he is
the diamond shining in a mediocre
setting.
The show is divided into two acts
and twenty-two scenes. It begins with
a spectacular specialty dance by Tut
Mace, a very agile young lady. Mr.
Lane makes a sudden jack-in-the-box
antrance from the stage floor, and

then the choruses and sketches come
thick and fast.
"Credits," a skit wherein each char
acter pauses after his speech to duly
credit the clothes he is wearing and
!the articles under discussion, Ls origi-
I nal and diverting. Mr. Lane makes
| much laughter in a skit entitled "The
I Dentist." He is at his best in the
j cleverest of all the sketches—"When
! Women Go to War." This one is a
riot.
| The other skits are so-so, some be
| ing rather amateurish and others de
| cidedly risque. Bert Levy is a clever
' man who does some extraordinary
j cartooning on a small glass which
j reflects on a big white curtain. His
| comments on prohibition, however,
'are most certainly out of place--and
J he drags in the ancient Aimee gags.
The "Music Box Revue" is not near
ly so elaborate a production as "Gay
Paree"; it is not so vulgar as its
predecessor, either. This new revue
has been playing in Hollywood for
several months, but will be in San
Francisco only this and next week.
Pardon —we almost forgot Doris
Eaton, the featured dancer and singer
of the show. She is pretty and she
dances well. But as a vocalist —she
"isn't." —Ben Maddox.

A Little Clown Lost. By Barry Ben-
field. New York: Century Com
pany. 1928.)

"A Little Clown Lost" is like a
breath of fresh air. Fresh air does in
duce a good feeling. Hut simply to sit
and take deep breaths of fresh air is
not terrifically exciting, unless you
are a convalescent Of course, if you
| have made yourself a little sick
| through an over-indulgence from one
j of those bookshelves labeled "sophis
ticated" you could hardly find a bet
ter antidote than Benfield's latest
book.
"Wholesomeness" sticks out at you
from practically every page. Yet this
quality is not nearly as objectionable
as it might be, for Benfield is a charm
ing story-teller, and apparently lets
his whimsical fancy have its way. He
draws two really fine characters in
the vivid, youthful Shep Tideboy and
his sweetheart, Phoebe.
Their meeting and romance are all
the more appealing from being whol
ly illogical. Throughout the first half
the story is fascinating because of its
! sheer unreasonableness. Surprising
I people do surprising things in a sur
prising way; there is no big central
situation —the book is only a pleasant,
series of graceful, pretty fragments.
The final chapters are disappoint
! ing. In spite of all of its undoubted
genuineness and simplicity, the book
is faulty, perhaps because it is too
much like a radio bedtime story.
