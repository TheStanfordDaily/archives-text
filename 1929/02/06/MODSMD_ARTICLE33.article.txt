# HANDS

### Feg Murray 
On the wall of the Garden City
Country Club, Long Island, N.Y.,
hangs a plaster cast of Harry Var
don's hands. These hands won six
British championships, among other
titles, and there probably never was
a liner pair of hands in golf. The
mitts, paws, dukes, or lunch hooks
are the most important factor in a
golfer's make-up. Bobby Jones hasn't !
as big hands as Harry Vardon, but |
he is just as great a golfer, or even
greater. He has big paws though. ;
very strong, and with a rare feeling
of touch so necessary to golf. Phillips
Finlay, one of the longest drivers in
the game today, has gigantic mitts, j

while Tommy Armour, former open
champion, has very long and strong
fingers.
In boxing, the hands are naturally
all-important. Dempsev hasn't the
biggest Anns in the world, but they
are plenty big enough, and practi
cally unbreakable. Firpo. Robertl,
Willard, all have huge mitts, as have
many wrestlers.
The best forward-passers in foot
ball's history had large hands. Brick
; Muller could handle a football as you
i and I would handle an indoor base
ball. Benny Oosterbaan, too. Eddie
Dooley, formerly of Dartmouth, can
I still throw long passes, and keeps his

hands in shape by tearing up a tele
phone book occasionally. Snively,
former Princeton captain, has im
mense mitts. Ned Glass, old-time Yale
player, and one of the best guards
that ever wore the blue of Eli, used
to purposely leave a gap in the line
and then stop the play that came his
way by merely sticking out his huge
paw.
Baseball gives the prize for tlie big
gest hands to Hans Wagner, whose
human scoop shovels hardly ever let
a ground ball get by him. "Chief"
Bender and Ilube Waddell both had
big powerful hands. Among present
day players, Art Jahn and Rube

Lutzke are supposed to have the big- j
gest paws.
The freakiest stunt I ever heard of
was vouched for by Bud Houser,
Olympic champion in the discus
throw. He saw Jules Noel, French ;
champion, take much pride in show-'
ing how he could hold a discus with i
his fingers, so that the "platter" was
almost lost in his big hand. You'll ap
preciate that stunt better, if you try ;
it sometime.
