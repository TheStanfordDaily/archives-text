# Old Boy Glorifies Good, Clean Fun In "Ordinary Issue," Out Tomorrow
## 
### 
Once again the Old Boy has delved
I into the depths of despair and risen
j to the heights of glory in the interests
j of Good, Clean Fun. He is presenting
tomorrow for his numerous readers
' and admirers such a conglomeration
jof jokes, puns, and rhymes as has
never before been put before the
| credulous eyes of the public. The best
| in campus wit and humor has been
collected together with appropriate
drawings and sketches in a superb
! effort to stir the mechanical soul of
the engineer, to stimulate the keen
analytical minds of the medics and
lawyers, and to uplift the aesthetic
i Five Hundred, of whom there are
! none better, God bless 'em. There are
! jokes for the young, jokes for the old,
j and jokes every young man and young
woman should know.
This, gentle readers, is the text of
the Ordinary Issue with which Chap
arral makes its second appearance of
the new year.
Don't forget the date, folks —tomor-
row, February 7, on the Quad from 8
Ito 12 o'clock —and the price? Why,
! the price is two-bits, twenty-five
cents, one quarter dollar. Thank you,
j one and all, for your kind attention
to our little message of good cheer.
Partake of it and rejoice.
