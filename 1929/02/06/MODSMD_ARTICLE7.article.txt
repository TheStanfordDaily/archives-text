# Record Set For Non-Stop Flight Cross Continent
## Captain Frank Hawks Holds Average Speed of 150 Miles Per Hour 
### 
ROOSEVELT FIELD, NEW YORK,
Feb. 5 —Captain Frank Hawks set
a new record for a non-stop transconti
j nental flight today.
Maintaining an average speed of almost
150 miles an hour, despite snow and fog
and rain that drove him high into the sky
and for a time threw him off his course,
he made the journey 36 minutes and one
second faster than the only other plane
that ever flew without halt from the
west coast to the east.
Hawks, piloting a scarlet torpedo-
I shaped Lockheed monoplane and accom
■ panied by Oscar E. Grubb, a mechanic,
j left Los Angeles at 5:37:30 o'clock, Pa
j cific time, yesterday afternoon. He land
! Ed here at 2 :59 :29 o'clock, Eastern time,
this afternoon, giving him a flying time
of 18 hours, 21 minutes and 59 seconds.
The only other west-east transcontinental
non-stop flight ever accomplished was
made late last summer by Col. Arthur
] Goebel in another Lockheed with Harry
I Tucker as passenger, in 18 hours and 58
i minutes. Tucker and C. B; D. Collyer
were later killed attempting to beat Goe
bel's time.
There have been two easi»west trans
continental non-stop flights. The first,
which took almost 27 hours, was made
by Lieutenants John Macready and Oak
ley Kelley in 1923 and the other was made
| by Tucker and Collyer in just under 25
hours after Goebel had set his west-east
mark.
Aside from being somewhat tired by
the strain of lighting the elements, which
he said were the only reasons he did not
beat Goebel's record by a full two hours,
Hawks seemed physically lit when he
landed.
Roosevelt Field has seen the beginning!
of many famous flights, notably the]
transatlantic flights of Lindbergh and!
Chamberlin and Byrd, but tociay was the I
first time it had been the scene of the !
ending of an important flight. Incoming!
planes on such flights for one reason or
another have in the past landed at Curtiss j
or Mitchell fields.

The only other west-east transcontinental
non-stop flight ever accomplished was
made late last summer by Col. Arthur

I Tucker as passenger, in 18 hours and 58

were later killed attempting to beat Goe
bel's time.
There have been two easi»west trans
continental non-stop flights. The first,
which took almost 27 hours, was made
by Lieutenants John Macready and Oak
ley Kelley in 1923 and the other was made
| by Tucker and Collyer in just under 25
hours after Goebel had set his west-east
mark.
Aside from being somewhat tired by
the strain of lighting the elements, which
he said were the only reasons he did not
beat Goebel's record by a full two hours,
Hawks seemed physically lit when he
landed.
Roosevelt Field has seen the beginning!
of many famous flights, notably the]
transatlantic flights of Lindbergh and!
Chamberlin and Byrd, but tociay was the I
first time it had been the scene of the !
ending of an important flight. Incoming!
planes on such flights for one reason or
another have in the past landed at Curtiss j
or Mitchell fields.
ROOSEVELT FIELD, NEW YORK,
Feb. 5 —Captain Frank Hawks set
a new record for a non-stop transconti
j nental flight today.
Maintaining an average speed of almost
150 miles an hour, despite snow and fog
and rain that drove him high into the sky
and for a time threw him off his course,
he made the journey 36 minutes and one
second faster than the only other plane
that ever flew without halt from the
west coast to the east.
Hawks, piloting a scarlet torpedo-
I shaped Lockheed monoplane and accom
■ panied by Oscar E. Grubb, a mechanic,
j left Los Angeles at 5:37:30 o'clock, Pa
j cific time, yesterday afternoon. He land
! Ed here at 2 :59 :29 o'clock, Eastern time,
this afternoon, giving him a flying time
