# KENEALLY SEALS PLAY CARD NINE THIS AFTERNOON
## 
### 
After a week's layoff because of bad
weather, Stanford's varsity baseball
team will play the Keneally Seals of
San Francisco this afternoon at 3:15
on the varsity diamond. The Seals are
holding down second place by a com
fortable margin in the Midwinter
League, and are the closest competi
tors of Granat Brothers, the leaders. }
Although the Cards were unable to j
practice last week, they are installed j
as favorites by virtue of their win I
over Granat Brothers. Last year the
Keneally Seals trounced the varsity
by a substantial score, and the Red- j
shirts will be out for revenge this af
ternoon. As there is no league game
for the semi-pros until Sunday, they
will use their best pitcher who should
show the Stanford batter some fancy
twirling.
Gene Kern will probably start in
the box for the varsity, as Lewis and
Taylor worked in the last contest. (
Kern has a large assortment of balls ;
and is one of the headiest pitchers on
the squad. Chuck Smalling will un
doubtedly throw a few innings also,,
because Coach Harry Wolter has not
yet worked any one chucker the whole j
route. Hardy is slated to start in the !
catching position.
Cook at first is showing rapid im
provement, and is distinguishing him
self as the most consistent hitter on
the squad. Johnson and Churchill
form a fast fielding keystone combina
tion which Laird fills out well at
third. Wilton and Hunken will be in
the outfield, and the third man is yet
to be named.
