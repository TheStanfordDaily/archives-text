# HUNT OPTIMISTIC AS CARDS WORK FOR BEAR CLASH
## Redshirts Stiffer Opponents For Ignatian Cagers Than California, "Husky" Avers Hunt Puts Charges Through Stiff Campaign Stressing Three Points in Practice 
### 
"St. Ignatius had to play harder to
win against Stanford than it did to
beat California." This is the opinion
of Coach Husky Hunt as expressed
yesterday afternoon in regard to the
Gray Fog-Card basketball game Tues
day night, which may mean little or
much in predicting the outcome of
(lie California contest here Saturday
night.
Coach Hunt has mapped out a
strenuous campaign to prepare his
charges for the coming fracas. His
plans emphasize three points: getting
the ball off of the backboard; passing
it more frequently when the offense
is breaking, instead of stalling and
lofting the opposition defense get set;
and cashing in on as many chances
for shooting free throws as possible.
Coach Is Optimistic
Hunt believes that if the Cards will
strengthen these departments of the
game they will be the favorites to
win, inasmuch as the game will be
on their home court. He plans to use
little scrimmage during the next two
days, and is rather optimistic about
the outcome.
"In the middle of the second half
the St. Ignatius team appeared to be
pretty tired," he said yesterday, "and
if the Stanford defense had been
working properly, the outcome might
have been a little different."
When asked what was the trouble
with the defense, Hunt replied that
the guards were not passing the ball
quick enough to the forwards but
were dribbling down the court and
stalling before the St. Ignatius de
fense. "The guards were not getting
the ball off the backboard and were
not up to par as they were in the
two TT.C.L.A. contests. Reynolds was
sent in with these instructions, as
Rothert was not playing as good as
he generally does," Hunt said.
Hunt figured that Reynolds would
be able to get the ball on the tip-off,
us well as Rothert had been doing,
for in practice the former generally
jumps higher than the Card captain.
The Cards showed up fairly well in
hitting the basket from long range
yesterday afternoon, and should be
"'bet" Saturday night. In practice Rey
nolds hade five out of six goals from
the middle of the floor, and Tampcke
made three straight. With the fighting
Bears rushing them Saturday night
it will be somewhat different, and the
Redshirts will have to be on their
toes all the time, if they want to do
any scalping.
