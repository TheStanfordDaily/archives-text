# HOOVER REMAINS IN FLORIDA TILL INAUGURAL WEEK
## 
### 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla., Feb. G. (J?)â€”
; President-elect Hoover has the pres
! ent intention of returning to Wash
i ington only a few (lays before his
i inauguration on March 4th. He plans
| to hold such conferences as may be
, necessary at his home, 2300 S street.
By the time of his return he hopes
to have both the inaugural address
and his Cabinet slate practically in
their final forms. His first address to
the people of the nation as President
rapidly is taking shape.
The determination of Mr. Hoover to
make no statements concerning his
Cabinet before the nominations are
sent to the Senate on March 4th was
further evidenced today with his flat
declination to comment upon the
statement made at Manila by Henry
L. Stimson, Governor General of the
Philippines, that at the request of the
President-elect he was leaving Manila
to take up another post.
Nor would the next Chief Executive
have anything to say about recurring
reports that Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
President of Stanford University,
would be appointed Secretary of the
Interior for the two years' period of
hir. leave of absence from Stanford.
Despite the silence of the Presi
i dent-elect, there is now a general be
| lief among most members of his party
; that the post Mr. Stimson is to take
j is that of Secretary of State and that
! Dr. Wilbur, if not appointed to the
I Cabinet, will undertake some highly
; important official mission for the
Hoover administration.
