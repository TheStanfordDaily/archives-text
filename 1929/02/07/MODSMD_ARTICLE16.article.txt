## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 6. (/P) â€”Disease has
cut short a life which triumphed over
some of the greatest hazards of war
and aviation.
Death came last night to Baron
Elirenfried Gunther von Huenefeld,
one of the three men who made the
first westward air passage of the
North Atlantic. He died on the oper
ating table at a Berlin sanatarium last
night as surgeons sought to remedy
a stomach and intestinal ailment
which had marred his last years. His
heart failed to withstand the shock
of the operation.
