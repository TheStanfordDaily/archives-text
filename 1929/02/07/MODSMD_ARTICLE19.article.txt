### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6.
sideration of the $417,000,000 annual
War Department supply bill consumed
the major portion of the Senate's time
today, but it failed to pass the meas
ure before adjournment. The bill, how
ever, is expected to be approved early
in tomorrow's session.
Before suspending business for the
day the Senate adopted a resolution (
requesting the Shipping Board to I
postpone its sale of the United States ;
and Merchant Marine lines and order
ing an inquiry of the bids for the ves
sels. The Caraway measure for the
regulation of cotton and grain sales
on futures markets was laid aside for
the War Department bill which occa- ■
sioned scant debate.
An effort will be made to have the I
House accept changes made by the '
Senate in the Naval measure at the
outset of the session so that the bill
can be sent to President Coolidge
without further delay. Representative
Britten said he would offer an amend
ment to the pending Naval Appropria
tions bill for funds to start the con
struction authorized in the next fiscal
year.
