# A 						New Galley Slave
## 
### 
The tumult and the shouting having died, we find ourself faced with
the prosaic task of pirouetting down this double column, this editorial
galley, five times a week in all manner and means of mental gymnastics.
In back of us we feel the presence of Volume 74. Try and do better,
that estimable volume admonishes us. Such is the spirit of the Daily.
Each editor steps behind the editorial desk determined to surpass the
efforts of his predecessor. With this in mind we bind ourself to this
venerable typewriter and swear never to leave it until \ olume 75 patteis
off to its grave.
Judging by the number of verbal riots precipitated by Templeton
Peck, our late boss, the Daily under his regime assumed an unprece
dented position in campus affairs. In the internal workings of the paper,
smooth-running efficiency was the rule. Political intrigue lapsed into
nothingness and fair play was an actuality. The new editor congratulates
the old and hopes for an equal record.
