# Bigger and Better Battleships
## 
### 
William Randolph Hearst may now sit back and smile complacently.
The Senate voted 68 to 12 to pass the cruiser bill, which he so ardently
supported. Its passage was a sad day for world peace.
Speaking of the bill, J. Ramsay Mac Donald, former prime minister
of Great Britain, said in the Nation: "The execution of that program will
be a great blow to the nation from which the Kellogg Pact originated."
Not only will it be a great blow to the United States in its relations
with the world, but it cannot help but be a great blow to world peace as
well. Great Britain looks askance at this militaristic move. Whether
that nation will consider it a first step toward an armament race and
begin to make its own bid for pre-eminence remains to be seen. A navy
building contest between two influential nations points to one thing, strife.
And strife between the nations in question would sound the doom of
world peace.
What sort of a nation is it that promotes world peace among the na
tions and builds bigger and better battleships in its own backyard ? The
same sort that passes Prohibition and winks at it with one eye when it is
passed. Let the men who promulgated the Kellogg Pact look to their
work that these dangerously real battleships do not make it an innocuous
ideal.
