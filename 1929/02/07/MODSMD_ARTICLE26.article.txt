The flood of campus opinions that has deluged the editor's office these
past months is high praise. For every campus opinion sent in, the editor
can figure fifty contemplated but not written, and any number of opinions
merely cast into the flow of casual conversation. These letters, be they
praise or denunciation, serve as an admirable barometer measuring the
campus reaction to the Daily.
But, there is a definite number of column inches on the editorial page.
There are bullsessions and reviews to be printed. Space is limited. Let
those who would express their views be sparing of words. For the editor
hereafter will reserve the right to refuse to print any opinions exceeding
two hundred words in length. One more thing: no anonymous letters
will be printed.
