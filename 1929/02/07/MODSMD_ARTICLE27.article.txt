# The 						University President and Public Opinion

Were the president of Stanford to express a belief in birth control,
oppose the narrow nationalism of the Daughters of the American Revo
lution, invite Prohibition authorities on the campus to arrest student
violators of the Eighteenth Amendment, and open the university to all
kinds of opinions, would he continue to maintain his position?
Clarence C. Little of the University of Michigan did these things and
was ousted by the regents. The case brings up the problem of what
leeway a university president should have in the matter of freedom of
thought and expression of opinion. Mr. Little was undoubtedly a capable,
liberal executive. Being a liberal with views different from those of the
regents, lost him his position. From this it would be concluded that the
president of a state university cannot express any opinion contrary to
that of his board of regents, which in turn is controlled by public opinion.
His views then must coincide with those of the voting public.
This reduces the matter to an absurdity, yet it demonstrates a fallacy
in the state university system, namely that a university president, a man
who must be of outstanding ability and intelligence to command that
position in the first place, must not oppose the opinions, beliefs, and
; udices of the masses.
