## LORD HELP THE LEGITIMATE? 
### 
Now that Mr. Arkush —whose name,
we imagine, was originated by an
early ancestor while eating soda
crackers —is dishing out canned
classics at the New Stanford Theatre,
and, being deprived during a large
part of each evening's entertainment
of the reassuring vista of the neck of
Mr. Lachelle, whose organ is in a
fair way of becoming rusty with dis
use, we, doggone it all, take this oc
casion to organize a society of one
to protest feebly against the invasion
of Palo Alto by the new Fidgeting
Phonograph.
It isn't that we object so strenuous
ly to this newfangled contraption per
se (particularly since we have been
spared so far from Mr. Jolson's bleat
ing about departed offspring), or that
we mind billboard statements that
Richard Dix eats, sleeps, walks, and
talks in his latest Look & Listen fea
ture, but, plague take it, ve are con
cerned about the dim and dissonant
future of the legitimate stage.
It may be that when the General
Electric Company, plus Sam Warner,
so suddenly relegated the movies from
their infancy to their embryology,

these innovators sounded the knell of
our little Nell, the legitimate.
"When a team of troupers have im
mortalized their turn for the Phono
graphies, they are done and finished.
And furthermore, now that the Del
Rios and such are being introduced
to the asbcan by reason of the need
for talent in the moviegroans, many
of the best Broadway names are being
seduced, by means of that frogskin
we all love to touch, into the Holly
wood Horrors. It looks like curtains
for the footlights.
Is it just the novelty of the thing, or
will people continue to patronize the
Pickled Passions? If so, it is a dark
day for such as we, who like our
voices in person.
Now honestly, don't you prefer the
knowledge, when Mr. Jolson irks you,
that you could if the spirit moved
you shy an egg at his reality, rather
than resorting to hisses by mail? And
don't you prefer to know, when a
shapely leg both dances and sings in
the chorus, that it is there in the
flesh —something which you could put
your hand on? Tut, tut, of course you
do. —Winston Norman.
