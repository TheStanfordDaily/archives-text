## PLOWSHARES OR BUTCHERKNIVES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Norman seems rather unfortu
nate in choosing subjects for his edi
torials. The one on Monday is an
outstanding example. Sometimes I
doubt his sincerity. It may well be
that he is baiting the student body
merely to hear the growls that ensue.
In respect to the armament ques
tion, he is rather unreasonable. There
are few people in the United States
who do not wish for immediate and
lasting peace in the world. They are,
unfortunately, divided in three fac
tions: the Protectionist Pacifists, the
Total Disarmament Pacifists, and the
Passive Pacifists. The latter we can
dismiss with the customary shrug.

If all the nations of the world
turned their swords into plowshares,
the balance of power would rest with
the nations that had the largest
butcherknives. Why can't the Protec
tionists and the disarmament faction
get together and form a plan that
would prevent even this? It is be
cause persons like Mr. Norman on
each side persist in making attacks
upon the other instead of upon war.
The Protectionists have rather the
best of it, because they advocate the
policy of strength until security is
guaranteed.
My dear Delilah, we don't care for
a haircut today!
Sincerely, F. S. A.
