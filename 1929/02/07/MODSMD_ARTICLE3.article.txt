# OLD BOY DISCOVERS DAILY IS TOO FAST FOR HIS AGED WAYS
## 
### 
It was erroneously stated in
yesterday's Daily that the Old
Boy would today bring before
the care-worn minds of this cam
pus his monthly potation of wit,
in the form of the far-sung Ordi
nary Number.
He desires to announce that
the famous sheet will appear on
the Quad tomorrow morning at
8 o'clock, and to say that this
error was not one of his little
jokes. He explains it by saying
that he gave the copy boy his
customary day and a half to get
the story to the Daily, and the
durned little brat fooled him by
taking only half a day. For once
the poor old Chuckler is silent
and solemn; he has been at a
loss, ever since to determine
whether the joke is on him or
on the campus populace who
must eagerly wait a day longer.
Be that as it may, Chappie will
be on the Quad tomorrow morn
ing. Don't fall down between
now and then.
