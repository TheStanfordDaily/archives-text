# ANOTHER SLEEPY STUDENT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I wish I could sleep. Each night I
am disturbed by the clicking of vocal
cords in the rooms around me, dis
cussing the sorority question. I think
someone wants the things abolished
or something. I wish they would for
get it and let me sleep.
Last night I had the most peculiar
experience. I walked in my sleep. I
went to the window. I saw hundreds
ol' workingmen and they were chisel
ing—chiseling rock and stone. I did
not know that workmen chiseled with
such persistence. I wished that they
would stop the noise. It hurt my ears.
But imagine my surprise when these
stones rose into a large quadrangle
of dormitories. From my position I
could see into the windows of the

structure. I did not know that Bastilles
had windows. I could see into the
dining room. There were groups of
girls scattered at tables throughout
the place. Each group was separated
icily from the other by means of a
strong rope set up around the tables.
They were eating their bread and
milk from different bowls. I did not
know that girls in dormitories were
not one united body. I noticed, too,
that each girl had cotton stuffed in
both ears. This I gathered was to
[ stifle the sound of the sipping of soup
| and the breaking up of crackers. I
| did not know that noise in a dormi
tory dining room bothered some girls.
Again it is late. People are still talk
ing. I wish they would stop. I want
to sleep. —Claire MacGregor.
