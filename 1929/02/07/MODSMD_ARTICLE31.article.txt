Here's How Again! By Judge Jr.
(New York: The John Day Com
pany. $1.)
Freedom-loving Americans, even as
you and I, who like occasionally to
go out and make boom-boom without
benefit of law will welcome with open
mouths this new and second volume
of "XJere's How" by our good friend
Judge Jr.
It is just a pocket-size, artistic,
mauve book; but it has between its
covers the potentiality of a Missouri
mule.
We read the purpose of the book in
the foreword. "Here's How"is dedi
cated "to the delicate art of drink
mixing in the hope of renewing an
interest in a lost art and in that way
doing its bit toward alleviating the
suffering of mankind both legislative
and physical."
What book could have a nobler pur
pose? And to make this high purpose
more easily fulfilled, "this edition has
been divided, for the convenience of

I our little readers, into sections accord
-1 ing to the different base liquors, so
I that anyone with nothing but gin in
I the house, for example, may look un
! der that department and not have to
I go through the whole book."
In accordance with this plan, the
■ book is divided into such as "Apple
jack Drinks," Bacardi Drinks, Brandy
, Drinks, Gin Drinks, Rye, Scotch, and
! miscellaneous.
Quite intriguing are the names of
Rome of the concoctions. We find
drinks called Eve's Apple, The Red
Flag, The Upanattem, The Cloven
Hoof, The Kummel Ye Faithful, The
Hooperdooper, The Green-eyed Mon
ster, The Snake-in-the-grass, The
Kitchen Stove, Hell's Belles, and The
Sweet Mama. There are many more
delightful mixtures, probably as po
tent as the names are interesting.
Not only do we find recipes, but a
host of wise-cracks that you really
ought to glance at, even if the recipes
are useless to you.
