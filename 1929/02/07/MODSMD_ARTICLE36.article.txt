If a Beries of tentative proposals
are carried out, Stanford University
may soon have an eighteen-liole golf
eours#.
A 12-inch water main running from
the campus to Searsville Lake has
been operating at its maximum capa
city for the past two years, according
to Almon E. Roth, comptroller of the
University. Owing to the increased
demand for water brought about by
growth of athletic field requirements
and the increased number of resi
dences on the campus, the 12-inch
Searsville line is inadequate.
May Use Felt Lake
In order to furnish the necessary
increased supply, the University will
face the alternatives of building an
other line to Searsville Lake, six miles
away, or enlarging Felt Lake, three
miles due south of the Quad, and
laying a 12-inch main to the latter
body of water.
It is believed that the cost of en
larging Felt Lake and laying a pipe
line to that point will not be any
greater than the expenditures neces
sary to construct a sceond 12-inch
main to Searsville Lake. F. A. Herr
mann has been engaged by the Uni
versity to prepare plans and specifica
tions for the enlargement of Felt
Lake. It is thought that bids will soon
be available on that project.
Lack of water supply has previous
ly hindered the construction of a
Stanford golf course. The proposed
Felt Lake line would practically dou
ble the water supply and would pass
directly through one proposed loca
tion for the golf course.
Sites Ideally Located
The suggested sites for the pro
posed golf course are ideally located.
Nine holes would be placed near the
location of the old stock farm build
ings, along the lake, and then to
Roble Creek. The second nine holes
would be laid on a section of land
west of the county road and would
continue westward beyond the Lath
rop home. A variety of topography
and natural hazards is presented on
the proposed courses. Soil conditions
are excellent.
The suggested enlargement would
increase the bounds of Felt Lake to
approximately fifteen times its pres
ent capacity. The storage space of
this lake would then be almost equal
to that of Searsville. Another advan
tage of the dual system of water lines
Ls that one branch could be shut down
and thoroughly cleaned out during
the winter months.
No definite steps have been taken
as yet by the University toward the
laying out of the proposed golf
courses.

other line to Searsville Lake, six miles
away, or enlarging Felt Lake, three
miles due south of the Quad, and
laying a 12-inch main to the latter
body of water.
It is believed that the cost of en
larging Felt Lake and laying a pipe
line to that point will not be any
greater than the expenditures neces
sary to construct a sceond 12-inch
main to Searsville Lake. F. A. Herr
mann has been engaged by the Uni
versity to prepare plans and specifica
tions for the enlargement of Felt
Lake. It is thought that bids will soon
be available on that project.
Lack of water supply has previous
ly hindered the construction of a
Stanford golf course. The proposed
Felt Lake line would practically dou
ble the water supply and would pass
directly through one proposed loca
tion for the golf course.
Sites Ideally Located
The suggested sites for the pro
posed golf course are ideally located.
Nine holes would be placed near the
location of the old stock farm build
ings, along the lake, and then to
Roble Creek. The second nine holes
would be laid on a section of land
west of the county road and would
continue westward beyond the Lath
rop home. A variety of topography
and natural hazards is presented on
the proposed courses. Soil conditions
are excellent.
The suggested enlargement would
increase the bounds of Felt Lake to
approximately fifteen times its pres
ent capacity. The storage space of
this lake would then be almost equal
to that of Searsville. Another advan
tage of the dual system of water lines
Ls that one branch could be shut down
and thoroughly cleaned out during
the winter months.
No definite steps have been taken
as yet by the University toward the
laying out of the proposed golf
courses.
If a Beries of tentative proposals
are carried out, Stanford University
may soon have an eighteen-liole golf
eours#.
A 12-inch water main running from
the campus to Searsville Lake has
been operating at its maximum capa
city for the past two years, according
to Almon E. Roth, comptroller of the
University. Owing to the increased
demand for water brought about by
growth of athletic field requirements
and the increased number of resi
dences on the campus, the 12-inch
Searsville line is inadequate.
May Use Felt Lake
In order to furnish the necessary
increased supply, the University will
face the alternatives of building an
other line to Searsville Lake, six miles
away, or enlarging Felt Lake, three
miles due south of the Quad, and
laying a 12-inch main to the latter
body of water.
