# AVIATION SCHOOL WILL INSTALL TURF RUNWAYS
## 
### 
Turf runways, to replace the oiled
runways now in use at the Palo Alto
School of Aviation, will soon be ready
for use, according to Mrs. Phyllis M.
Goddard, secretary. The seeding has
been going on for the last few weeks.
The school's experience with oiled
runways has proven that they are not
suitable for a field where much flying
is done, as they cut up easily, and in
summer become very dusty unless
re-oiled at short intervals. The school's
practice field, which is turf-covered,
has none of these drawbacks, and it
is expected that grass runways will
overcome these troubles on the home
field.

The Rev. R. Robert Crawford of
Portland, Oregon, uses an airplane to
cover his evangelical territory.
