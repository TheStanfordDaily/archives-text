### 
Margaret Matzenauer, leading con
tralto of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, will give the third concert of
the A.S.S.U. Concert Series on Mon
day evening at 8:15 o'clock in the
Pavilion.
Mine. Matzenauer was born in
Temesvar, Hungary, in 1881. Her
father was an orchestral leader and
her mother a dramatic soprano, so
that her youth was spent in an en
vironment of music. She was educated
by her parents and later studied with
Georgine Neuendorff in Graz and with
Antonia Mielke and Franz Emerich in
Berlin.
She made her debut as "Puck" in
Weber's "Oberon" at the Stad theatre
in Strassburg, Germany, in 1901. Her
success was so great that she was
immediately signed up for a three
year engagement. From 1904 to 1911
she sang at the Royal Opera House
at Munich, appearing also at this time
iu the Wagner festivals held at Bay
reuth.
Her American debut was made at
the Metropolitan Opera House in 1911,
with a marvelous impersonation of
Amneris in Verdi's "Aida." This debut
greatly augmented her fame and
brought her into popular favor.
One of the most astounding feats
of this extraordinary singer occurred
when she sang the role of Kundry in
Wagner's "Parsifal" with only one
hour's notice and without any orches
tral rehearsal.
Seats will be distributed today to
holders of season tickets from 8:30 to
12 and from 1 to 5 o'clock at the Old
Union. Additional seats will be on
sale to those not subscribing to the
entire A.S.S.U. series at prices rang
ing from $ 1.50 to $2.50.
