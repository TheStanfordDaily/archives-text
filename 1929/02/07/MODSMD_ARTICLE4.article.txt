# CARD FRESHMEN PLAY BEAR CUBS IN SECOND GAME
## Previous Win Gives Stanford Babes Edge in Crucial Game of Series 
### 
With everything to gain and nothing
to lose, Stanford's freshman basket
ball quintet will meet the California
yearlings in the Pavilion next Satur
day night in the second game of their
series, the Cardinal babes having al
ready one the first contest by a score
of 26 to 19. The game will be prelimi
nary to the varsity clash.
Although the Stanford five should
come out on the long end of the score
by virtue of its previous victory, the
Bear Cubs will be fighting hard up
to the final whistle, since defeat will
mean the loss of the series. Another
fact in favor of the visitors is the
evident slump that the Cardinal
youngsters have been experiencing
during the past few days.
Coach Bradshaw has not announced
the starting line-up as yet, although
Doub, Baker, aud Rintala are certain
of the pivot and guard positions.
Choice of forwards lies between Ray,
Kelly, and Shrader.
California's probable lineup is as
follows: Smart and Leavell, forwards,
Bondshu, center, and Fifield and Bart
lett, guards. Smart is easily the out
standing player of the squad, having
taken high-point honors in the year
lings' first game. Fifield and Bartlett
are both capable men, the former
being an accurate shot; while Bart
lett is particularly good on defensive
work.
The Blue and Gold youngsters use
the grapevine type of offense, a fact
that gave the Cardinal guards con
siderable trouble during the last game.
Bradshaw has been training his squad
in breaking up this type of offense,
however, and they will probably be
more successful Saturday.
