Displaying a strong five-man de
fense, Breakers had an easy time
trouncing a week Alpha Sigma Phi
team by a one-sided score last night
in the mural basketball tourney.
Phi Psi played a speedy floor game
to run away from Encina 5. The win
ners piled up a big lead in the first
few minutes of play and then took
things easy to win by a comfortable
margin. Weaver, forward for Phi Psi,
sank 8 baskets to be high-scorer of
(he contest. Bartlett showed up well
for the losers, as did Perelli-Minetti
for the fraternity outfit.
Alpha Tau Omega upset the dope
again last night and won from the
Kappa Sigs in a listless tilt. Boomer
and Hossom both played good ball
for the A.T.O.'s, while Mann was just
about the whole Kappa Sig team.
Coming from behind in the last min
ute of play, Phi Sigma Kappa tossed
in two goals to beat out Theta Xi by
a 15 to 13 score.
In a rough and ragged fracas Chi
Psi .Lodge managed to nose out En
cina 4E. F. Russ, at forward for the
Chi Psi'a, looped in 4 buckets and was
high-scorer with 8 markers.
