### 
At a second meeting held yesterday
to discuss formation of a campus ad
vertising club later to affiliate with
i Alpha Delta Sigma, national profes
sional advertising fraternity, it was i
decided that affiliation with this or-!
| ganization would be of no benefit. \
There will be no advertising club
formed here, but those who desire to
get into an organization of this char- \
acter should associate themselves
I with the Stanford Advertising Club of
Palo Alto.
