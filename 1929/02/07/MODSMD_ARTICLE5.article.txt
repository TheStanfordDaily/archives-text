# WEEK REMAINING IN CHAPARRAL'S BIG BEARD RACE
## 
### 
Now that there is only one week
to grow in Chaparral's mammoth
Whisker Marathon, the Old Boy is
making elaborate preparations for the
finish. Practically all the contestants
have turned the half-inch post and
are commencing the long raise down
the home stretch.
At present Jess DeLucchi of the
El Toro outfit and Ed Yeazell, the
AT O. representative, look like the
best bets. None of their rivals is wor
ried, however, and say that a DeLucchi
victory is only "bull" and Yeazell will
soon be "all tuckered out."
Due to the intense excitement of
the general student body, especially
from the sororities and Roble, the
Daily will publish interviews from the
leading bushwhackers and will com
pile a betting guide for the bleacher
fans. Watch this paper for a bristle
by bristle account.
