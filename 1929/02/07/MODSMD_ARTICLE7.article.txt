# UNIQUE IDEA EMPLOYED IN PLAY SCENES
## Semi-Permanent Settings Are Created by Helvenston For Barrie Play 
### 
For the first time on the Stanford j
stage, and, Harold Helvenston thinks, !
for the first time in a Barrie play, a
semi-permanent set will be used
when "What Every Woman Knows"
is presented tomorrow night. In less
technical terms, this means that the
actual structure of the three sides of 1
the setting are never changed or dis-j
mantled, but by the use of inter
changeable units and wall panels the
entire appearance of the one set is
transformed into four different scenes.
In the Winthrop Ames production
of "The Merchant of Venice," which
appeared in San Francisco two months
ago, this idea was used, but in the
Masquers' play Helvenston, the scenic
director, has carried the method to !
practically its ultimate perfection. A
window is slid away and a door is j
put in its place, only to become, in i
the next act, a fireplace or a blank
wall. It sounds like a modern apart
ment or a mystery play instead of a j
Barrie comedy.
This novel scheme has to be em
ployed because the drama calls for
four "box" sets, which is one more
than the usual number and hence has
caused Helvenston and his stage crew
more work than any other campus j
production. The first act takes place :
in the interior of a middle-class resi- j
dence in Glasgow; the second is in a j
tonsorial parlor in that city. Then the j
action of the third occurs in a well- j
to-do drawing room in London, whence j
the scene changes to the living-room I
of an English country house. To give j
further the sense of four different !
settings, a stipple treatment of five ;
colors on the walls enables them, by i
merely changing the lights, to turn a |
different color.
The women's costumes are exquisite i
Paris gowns of the period of 1905- j
1910, which have been loaned by an J
Atherton resident for the occasion. '
About fifteen beautiful dresses are \
worn in the play. And Helvenston's :
assistants have ransacked the Penin- ]
sula for any furnishings that smack ,
of the period following the Mauve De- i
cade. "What Every Woman Knows" j
promises to be one of the few pro
ductions in which artistry and actu- j
ality of the settings most nearly ap
proach perfection.
