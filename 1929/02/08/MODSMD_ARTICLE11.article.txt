# WRANGLERS CLUB IS REORGANIZED; OFFICERS CHOSEN

### 
Wranglers, women's debating society
which has been disbanded for the past
year, was reorganized last night at a
dinner held in the Women's Clubhouse.
Violet Crosbie was clected president and
Helen Smith secretary.
The sixteen members present decided
to meet at dinner every Thursday at 5 :30
in the Women's Clubhouse to discuss
current topics. A debate with Euphronia
on the question, "Resolved, That the
Lower Division be retained," has been
scheduled for Wednesday, February 27.
A triangular debate with California
and College of the Pacific will be held
sometime in March. Next quarter mem
bers of the society are to meet women
debaters from U.S.C.
Eleanor Davidson, who coached the
women debaters for last quarter's con
test with California, will probably act
as mentor for Wranglers.
