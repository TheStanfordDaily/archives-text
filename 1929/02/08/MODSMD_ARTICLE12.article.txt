# METROPOLITAN OPERA COMPANY STAR TO SING IN A.S.S.U. CONCERT MONDAY
## 
### 
Margaret Matzenauer, leading con
tralto of the Metropolitan Opera Com
pany, will appear in the Pavilion Mon
day evening at 8:15 in the third concert
of the A.S.S.U. Series. Edward Hart
will be the accompanist.
Mme. Matzenauer was born in Tcmcs
var, Hungary, in 1881. Her early edu
cation was undertaken by her mother and
father, both of whom were talented mu
sicians. As a girl, she desired to become
an actress, but inflnenccd by her musical
environment she continued to study under
such famed people as Antonia Mielke and
Franz Emerich in Berlin.
Her debut was made as "Puck" in
Weber's "Obcron" in Strassburg, Ger
many, in 1901. Her success was so great
that it resulted in a three years' engage
ment. From 1904 to 1911 she sang at
the Royal Opera at Munich, appearing
also at this time in the Wagner festivals

at Bayreuth.
Mine. Matzen&uer's American debut at
the Metropolitan Opera House in 1911
was a sensation. She has ever since been
one of the leading as well as one of the
most dependable singers of this organi
zation. She repeated her New York tri
umphs the following summer at Buenos
Aires. In 1912 she was called upon to
sing the role of Kundry in Parsifal at
the Metropolitan with only an hour's
notice, and her triumph was memorable.
She has frequently sung important roles
on short notice and has invariably scored
a tremendous success.
Seats will be distributed tomorrow and ;
Monday to holders of season tickets from j
8:30 to 12 and from 1 to 5 o'clock at the |
Old Union. Additional scats will be on
sale to those not subscribing to the entire
A.S.S.U. Series at prices ranging from
$1.50 to $2.50.
