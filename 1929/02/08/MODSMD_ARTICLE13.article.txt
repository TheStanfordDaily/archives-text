# RELATIONS OF POPE, STATE ARE REVEALED
## Pope Pius XI, Mussolini End Ancient Church-Italy Row With Pact 
### 
ROME, Feb. 7 (/P). â€”Conclusion of an
agreement between the Holy See and
Italy, settling the question raised by the
fall of the Papal States and providing in
detail for the future relations between
church and state, was formally announced
by Cardinal Gasparri, Papal Secretary of
State, today to the Vatican diplomatic
body.
The Cardinal and Premier Mussolini j
will sign the agreement and concordat on ,
Sunday at the Lateran palace. Simul- j
taneously the Pope will distribute to the ;
Cardinals the printed text of the docu- |
ments. These will be published Monday. ;
Some believe Pope Pius XI will leave !
the Vatican under the freedom of the new i
order for the first time at Easter. There
is speculation as to whether lie will choose
to celebrate mass at the Church of St.
John in Lateran in keeping with old papal
traditions, or at the Church of St. Charles
where, as a newly ordained priest, he
said his first mass fifty years ago.
Solution of the Roman question was
rendered possible, according to Vatican
and Fascist circles, by the exceptional
coincidence of the presence of strong
men on the chair of St. Peter and at
the helm of the Italian Government. Al
lowing for the differences of the two
epochs, Pius Xi is said to resemble much
his predecessor of the sixteenth century,
Sixtus V, in his dictatorial system of
ruling the Holy See, his indefatigable
work, austerity of life, and extreme in
dependence.
Another dictator, Premier Mussolini,
equally stem and inflexible in his deci
sions, happens to have been governing
Italy since 1922, one year after Cardinal
Ratti was raised to the pontificate.
Hence, on the Vatican side during the
negotiations there has been no foreign
interference permitted, no meddling of
Cardinals, no intrigues of courtiers, and
on the side of Italy there has been no j
discussion in the press, no opposition in J
Parliament( and no pandering to public
opinion.
"It seems God's will 1" the Pope is re
ported to have exclaimed.
Immediately after the meeting of the
diplomats at the state apartment in the
Vatican, Cardinal Gasparri was received
by Pope Pius, who said that he was ex
ceedingly pleased.
