Yesterday's intramural basketball was
featured by clumsy play and lopsided
scores. How of Independents II turned
in the only mentionable performance
when he made a total of 27 against a
dazed Sequoia team.
A fourth-quarter rally by the Encina
2W team barely failed to overcome a ten
point lead held by the K.A.'s at the
close of the third period. The play was
rough and uneven, the hall team's guard
ing ridiculous, but the game was the
liveliest of the evening.
Sigma Nu nosed out the Independents
in a slow game. Fijis took a dull con
test fro mthe club team.
