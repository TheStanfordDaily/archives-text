# U.G. IS FAVORED IN SECOND GAME OF BIG "SERIES"
## Tyler Selected by Hunt to Replace Berg; No Changes Expected in Bear's Lineup Varsities Meet at 8 O'Clock Tomorrow Night; Frosh Play Preliminary Contest 
### ANSON REEDER 
"When dog bites man, that's not
news, but when man bites dog, that
is news," so goes an old newspaper
maxim. As to the second court battle
of the "Big Series" to be played in
the Pavilion at 8 o'clock tomorrow
night, it might be said that if Bear
bites Card, that will not be news, but
it' Card bites Bear that will be news,
for it will be a deep bite, and one as
memorable as when the Bears' last
great "Wonder Team" of the gridiron
failed to bite back in 1925 and drop
ped the first tilt of innumerable sea
sons to the boys from the Farm.
Coach Husky Hunt has been spend
ing his evenings at home figuring out
a way to make his team nineteen
points stronger than they were when
they met the bamboozling Bears in
their own lair two weeks ago. At that
time the Californians featured a
slashing defense which completely
baffled or, it might be said, annihi
lated the Stanford attack. But this
time Coach Hunt's squad will be pre
pared for the back-biting tactics of
their opponents. The huddle system
will be used before each play.
Tyler To Start
The Une-up will appear intact with
the exception of Don Tyler, who by
virtue of his showing during the past
few games, will replace Berg at one
of the forward positions. Vance Faw
cett will be seen as Tyler's running
mate. Hawkins, at center, and Cap
tain Ilothert and Mike Reynolds at
guard, will complete the starting
line-up.
Since their showing in the South
last week, Coach Hunt has been
working this five regularly every
night. They have developed into a
fast, smooth-working outfit. Their
basket-shooting, both from the field
and on free throws has shown steady
improvement. The offense is breaking
faster, and the guards are getting the
ball from under the basket before the
opposing forwards get tired of shoot
ing. In other words it is a different
looking team than met California two
weeks ago.
Since Card and Bear met in their
last conflict the Conference leaders
have suffered two letdowns, one at
the hands of St. Ignatius College and
one at the hands of the Santa Clara
Drones. Stanford also succumbed to
the Gray Fog in a hectic tilt last
Tuesday night, but seemed to be more
of a match for them than California
had been the week previous. However
Santa Clara had previously bowed to
the Redshirts when the two teams
met on the Farm several weeks ago.
All of which proves very little in any
nport, especially basketball.
Crucial Game
It will be a very important evening
for the Stanford varsity. If they de
feat California they will be a step
nearer the Conference championship.
If they lose the contest, the Confer
ence honors as well as the "Big
Series" will be over for the year.
Many basketball critics believe that
California had her big evening when
the teams met on the Oakland Audi
torium court two weeks ago. If this
belief holds true the Cards may come
through without any trouble, on the
other hand .
At the present time the Bears have
an undisputed hold on first place with
six wins and no losses. If California
should win tomorrow, they have only
to trim UCLA who has not yet won a
Conference game this season. The
Redshirts in order to finish on top
must dispose of the Bears tomorrow
and on February 23, besides putting
the Trojans away in a two-game series
here next week-end.
Nibs Price will doubtless send the
same line-up against the Cards that
he has used so successfully thus far
this season.
