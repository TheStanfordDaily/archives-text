# The 						Class of 1929 Will Endow

### 
Fifty members of the Senior Class gathered to discuss the matter of
an endowment gift. There are six hundred in the class. Three propo
sitions were considered. Ihe first would give aid to instruction and re
search 111 schools and departments, the second would aid in establishing
a research library in a single department, and the third would aid the New
Theatre Fund. The latter was dropped as of too little interest to the
fifty members present and hence to the whole class. Ihe other two piopo
sitions were believed acceptable and will be voted on at Tuesday's election.
In fairnss, all three propositions should he presented on the ballot.
llow can fifty members of the class decide what the interests of six hun
dred are? I>e that as it may, consider the other two.
The plan to endow instruction and research in schools and depart
ments offers an incentive broad enough to motivate the entire class. The
single department library endowment does not. The first looks to the
future and offers a plan that may be adapted to the conditions that the
future will present. The second cannot provide for future developments.
Departments die. Interests in the field of education move from one field
to another. Single departments are often endowed by graduates from
those departments. The plan does not recognize the element of change.
Furthermore, from the practical dollar and cents viewpoint, endow
ment given for use in instruction and research is a splendid investment
because there are foundations and endowment funds that will match dol
lar for dollar gifts of this nature.
The matter of incentive is paramount. The amount of money given
by the class is directly dependent upon this. Next to this in importance
are the needs of the University. Many departments are balked in their
expansion plans by the lack of funds. \\ ho is to decide which department
is most in need?
These are matters that will cause no end of strife should the single
department endowment plan be adopted. Fastern universities are piling
up endowment more rapidly than Stanford. As a result they can raise
their professorial salaries and thus obtain and retain the best academic
personnel. If Stanford wishes to keep its standard high in this vital phase
of its existence, it must have sufficient funds to pay adequate salaries.
Second to professors, a university can have no more crying need than
that of adequate equipment. The laboratory is as essential to the pro
fessor as the scalpel is to the surgeon.
Place the class endowment in the hands of the administrative officers,
who are here on the ground looking to the future, to use as they see fit,
and the class can render an invaluable and lasting service to the Uni
versity.
It is the University as a whole that we want to help, not a segment of
it. From this broader point of view and with an eye to the future, the
class should endow a fund for use in instruction and research.

to another. Single departments are often endowed by graduates from
those departments. The plan does not recognize the element of change.
Furthermore, from the practical dollar and cents viewpoint, endow
ment given for use in instruction and research is a splendid investment
because there are foundations and endowment funds that will match dol
lar for dollar gifts of this nature.
The matter of incentive is paramount. The amount of money given
by the class is directly dependent upon this. Next to this in importance
are the needs of the University. Many departments are balked in their
expansion plans by the lack of funds. \\ ho is to decide which department
is most in need?
These are matters that will cause no end of strife should the single
department endowment plan be adopted. Fastern universities are piling
up endowment more rapidly than Stanford. As a result they can raise
their professorial salaries and thus obtain and retain the best academic
personnel. If Stanford wishes to keep its standard high in this vital phase
of its existence, it must have sufficient funds to pay adequate salaries.
Second to professors, a university can have no more crying need than
that of adequate equipment. The laboratory is as essential to the pro
fessor as the scalpel is to the surgeon.
Place the class endowment in the hands of the administrative officers,
who are here on the ground looking to the future, to use as they see fit,
and the class can render an invaluable and lasting service to the Uni
versity.
It is the University as a whole that we want to help, not a segment of
it. From this broader point of view and with an eye to the future, the
class should endow a fund for use in instruction and research.
Fifty members of the Senior Class gathered to discuss the matter of
an endowment gift. There are six hundred in the class. Three propo
sitions were considered. Ihe first would give aid to instruction and re
search 111 schools and departments, the second would aid in establishing
a research library in a single department, and the third would aid the New
Theatre Fund. The latter was dropped as of too little interest to the
fifty members present and hence to the whole class. Ihe other two piopo
sitions were believed acceptable and will be voted on at Tuesday's election.
In fairnss, all three propositions should he presented on the ballot.
llow can fifty members of the class decide what the interests of six hun
dred are? I>e that as it may, consider the other two.
The plan to endow instruction and research in schools and depart
ments offers an incentive broad enough to motivate the entire class. The
single department library endowment does not. The first looks to the
future and offers a plan that may be adapted to the conditions that the
future will present. The second cannot provide for future developments.
Departments die. Interests in the field of education move from one field
to another. Single departments are often endowed by graduates from
those departments. The plan does not recognize the element of change.
