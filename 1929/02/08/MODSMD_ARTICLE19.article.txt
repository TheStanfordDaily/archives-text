Cut as you will is the dictum of the University of Idaho faculty. Stu
dents have been put 011 their own responsibility in regard to attendance.
Much maligned, Francois Rabelais, writer of no Victorian pailoi
literature, and keen satirist of a former day, placed over the gateway of
his ideal university this motto, "Do what you will." The slothful and the
lazy have greeted this with hearty acclaim these many years, believing in
their way that here would be a haven for the spineless.
These lazy-bones little knew that Rabelais, no siesta-seeker himself,
saw such a university as the only place for those who revel in delving
into the depths of knowledge, to work untrammeled by prejudice, rule,
or the chains of authority.
And now the potato-state's stronghold of higher learning has taken a
step toward that ideal school of the plain-spoken I' rcnchman. A good
move it is and one that we would shout banzai for, were it instituted at
Stanford.
How many students have drowsed through dozens of classes only to
rush out and read the text and pass the course. Attendance at class is
essential, but the freedom to attend or not would add zest to a course and
would make the student get what he missed in class on his own hook.
Cut as you will, a dream come true.
