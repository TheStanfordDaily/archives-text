AT THE THEATRES
Week-end visitors to the city have a
variety of shows to pick for their eve
ning's entertainment. There are four
comedies and two musical attractions now
being staged in the legitimate theatres.
Henry Duffy's two playhouses have the
best comedies, ami it is urgently recom
mended that you see both "This Thing
Called Love" at the President and "Cour
age" at the Alcazar. Both arc current
hits in New York City, and are set for
long runs here. Tom Moore and Kay
Hammond head the' cast of the Presi
dent's show, which concerns an ultra
modern solution of "the great marriage
problem." Emma Dunn, distinguished
character actress, is excellent in the
leading role of "Courage." These two
plays are unusually good as regards lines
and situations —and they have been splen
didly cast.
Closing this week-end at the Geary is
"Her Cardboard Lover," a Frenchy and
fairly amusing comedy. Hazel Whitmore
is interesting as the lady who hires a
gigolo to keep her from returning to her
divorced husband. Some rather clever
dialogue in this, but it is artificial and
misses fire as a whole. The Geary has
a much better play opening next Monday
night—"The Guardsman," starring Low
ell Sherman.
The Curran is presenting Lupino Lane's
"Music Box Revue" for another week.
This is just a so-so assemblage of risque
sketches, chorus girls, and dancers. Lu
pino Lane, himself, is good.
And,* of course, "Easy for Zee Zee"
runs on and on at the Green Street. In
its sixth month now. Such popularity
must have a reason —but we won't tell
you here what it is. You undoubtedly
know the Green Street type.
Comic opera lovers will certainly en
joy "lolanthe," the Gilbert & Sullivan
opera at the Columbia. An excellent com
pany is putting on revivals at thi& the
atre.

"The Pirates of Penzance" and "Trial
by Jury"—Gilbert & Sullivr.n, Co
lumbia.
When the coster's finished jumping on
his mother—
He loics to He a-hasking in the sun.
Oh take one consideration with another—
A policeman's lot is not a happy one.
Forty years ago this laid 'em in the
aisles at the Old Savoy, in London. And
this week (1929) in the Columbia The
atre, San Francisco, the D'Oyly Carte
Gilbert & Sullivan Company presented
the famous "Pirates of Penzance" with

all the verve, color, and hilarious comedy
that featured the original production.
"The Pirates of Penzance" is not a
polite comic opera, it is a glorious bur
lesque on Duty, Officiousness, Politics,
Police, and Pirates — and the English
brought out comic values that have lain
hidden for all the years that Americans
have been warping Gilbert's own ideas.
Tor the D'Oyly Carte Company is car
rying on the old tradition, and D'Oyly
Carte, the younger, is now managing the
company that his father made famous.
"Trial by Jury," given on the same bill,
is one act of amusing complications in a
courtroom, involving a breach of promise
suit. The judge, tired of trying to effect
a compromise, decides to marry the dis
appointed bride himself.
But "The Pirates of Penzance" was
the real dish of the evening. The plot is
perhaps the most ridiculous of all the
Gilbert & Sullivan series. Frederic, a
"slave to duty," is apprenticed to the Pi
rates until his twenty-first birthday, due
to an "error." But he was born on the
29th of February and so will not be
twenty-one until 1940.
This thwarts his plans to exterminate
the Pirates, and lie is forced, through
"duty," to turn against Mabel, his dearly
loved one, and Major-General Stanley,
her father, who described himself as an
orphan to escape the tender-hearted Pi
rates. He is not an orphan. "Moreover,"
says Frederic, "he never was one." But
everything is untangled and a swinging
chorus bring the curtain down.
Every characterization was good, with
Pauline Wooten again revealing herself
as an accomplished comedienne in the sub
ordinate role of Kate. Blossom Gelsthorpe
is the sixteen-year-old Mabel to perfec
tion and sang the role extraordinarily
well. Her coloratura solo, "Poor Wan
dering One," and a lovely duet with Fred
eric—"He loves thee—lie is here," were
tremendous lye ffective.
That amusing number concerning the
"most ingenious paradox" and the big
policeman's chorus, "When the Foeman
Bares His Steel" were highlights.
Lytton was excellent as Stanley who
"still in matters vegetable, animal, and
mineral" is "the very model of a mod
ern major-general."
The settings were the finest this re
viewer lias ever seen for a Gilbert &
Sullivan show. The D'Oyly Carte pro
ductions, assuredly, show that a Gilbert
& Sullivan opera, if produced for the
first time today, would sweep aside all
the Rose Maries and Vagabond Kings
and become the reigning favorite out of
sheer merit.
