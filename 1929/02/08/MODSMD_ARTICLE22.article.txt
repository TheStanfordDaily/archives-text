AN APOLOGY TO THE ROUGH

The Editor, Sir:
The inmates of the Bastille are as '
indignant as the mistreated roughs at j
the alarming farewell accorded them I
at Roble's recent Jolly-up. Surely the j
French Revolution was justified if
the Louis ever approached the aggres- I
sive tactlessness of a Stanford war
den.
The Stanford Rough is as indispens
able as the cactus gardens or the
postoffice—as hallowed by tradition
as the Memorial Chapel. "A dance

; without Roughs is not a dance." Seri- i
ously, we could not feel more hurt
had guests been turned away discour
teously from our own homes.
We apologize, Stanford Roughs. We ;
I ask you not to consider the incident
I a.i typical of Roble Spirit or Stanford
j ideals. Hut the cause of the trouble j
i is beyond our control —so long as we
are treated as irresponsible minors, j
|so long will such occurrences con- S
; tinue to be the rule.
—Eight Irritated Inmates.
