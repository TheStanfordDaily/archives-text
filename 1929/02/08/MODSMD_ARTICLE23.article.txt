Evidence that Stanford men would be
at home anywhere is gleaned in a head
line from the Daily Californian —
TODAY LAST TIME
TO DROP COURSES
WITHOUT PAYING FEE

"Spacc is limited," says a sen
tence from yesterday's editorial
column. It is true that we have not
appeared 011 certain days recently,
but this is due to a hunger strike
we arc conducting against the
Campus Opinion column.
No, sir, we are not limited, we—
"like Tennyson's brook"—go on for
ever.

Song for the Future:
Come join the band
Although our rooting section's gone
On ev'ry hand
The transfer brain has replaced
brawn
Stanford for few
Each clever proctor, watching you
With might and main
Cries "Please refrain
From cribbing in your blue book,
Stanford Red."

OR—Song for Finals
On, men of Stanford,
The vict'ry awaits you
Our profs take pity
As our pallor they see.
Fight for the bane
Of the all-conquering minus-
Honor Forever! Rings our cry of
Honesty!

And, of course, anything else you
might think of.

The recent dropping of chapel, one
realizes, is only part of a vespering cam- :
1 paign.
