# Cardinal Ball Team To Meet Athens Nine Tomorrow Afternoon
## 
### DON OSWILL 
A big game hunter, former college
stars, and some professional ball players
will be included in the line-up of the
Athens Athletic Club which meets the
Cardinal nine here tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30 on the Varsity diamond. Coach
Harry Wolter put his men through a
stiff workout yesterday afternoon despite
the soggy condition of the ball park, and
the lack of practice has apparently not af
fected their hitting ability.
Three good catchers arc included on
the Oakland team's squad. Bill Rodgers
will join the Mission Coast League Club
in the middle of February, Sid Snow
is a former St. Mary's catcher and fa
mous as an African wild animal hunter,
and Gene Nisson was formerly a Stan
ford backstop. Rodgers will probably get
the call tomorrow because of his greater
experience.
Earl Jones, who will start in the box
for the Qub team, is one of the best
pitchers in the Bay region. He has been
a consistent winner in the Oakland Win
ter League, and should offer the Cards
some real throwing. Bert King, Gus
Owen, Jack Lubbock, and "Lefty"
Hermle are the former University of
California men on the Athens squad.
The latter is one of the best first base
men in the semi-pro ranks.
Billy Yore and Arnold Cardoza are a
couple of heavy hitting outfielders whose
respective alma maters are Notre Dame
University and St. Mary's College. Pete
Starsnich, the third man in the field, is
claimed to be the best sticker out of or
ganized baseball. Starsnich has been play
ing for the Oakland Independents.
The starting battery for the Varsity
tomorrow will be Kern and Hardy. Kern
has been showing up well in the box
lately, and Hardy is a reliable man behind
the plate. Cook, Churchill, Johnson, and
Laird will play the infield for the var
sity, and Wilton and Hunken the out
field. The third outfielder has not yet
been named by Wolter.
