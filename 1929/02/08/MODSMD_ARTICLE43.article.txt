# T. X. HOUSE IS ENTERED Yegg Is Nonchalant in Crisis PURSUER FALLS IN MUD
## 
### 
Nonchalance was effectively dis
played yesterday morning not by light
ing a Murad but by tieing a shoe
lacing.
As Stan Milne stepped out from his
room in the Theta Xi house at seven
yesterday morn, he beheld an uncouth
stranger in the hallway. His curiosity
aroused, Stan asked the young man,
"What do you want?"
"I work here," said the unknown as
he nonchalantly stooped to tie a shoe
string. Stan was perplexed and hesi
tant. A moment's pause was all the
agile stranger needed, for he leaped
from the spot and bolted to the door
with a burst of speed that would have
made the famous Paddock turn green
with envy.
Stan's attire consisted of a bath
robe and a pair of slippers, but he
gave chase. The youthful filcher
breezed through the front door like
a wild March wind, and ran to the
rear of the house. Milne pursued the
yegg. Around the corner he roared,
but a gooey mass of chocolate mud
snared the pursuing Milne, and the
chase ended.
The incident was reported to the
sheriff, but no trace of the culprit
could be found.
Members of Theta Xi report that
nothing had been taken by the marau
der.
