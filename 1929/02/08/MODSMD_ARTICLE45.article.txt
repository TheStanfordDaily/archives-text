# CALIFORNIA CREW MENTOR CHANGES VARSITY BOATING
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Feb. 7.—Evidence that
Ky Ebright, coach of the varsity and
jayvee crews at the University of
California, is getting down to brass
tacks has been furnished by the first
big shake-up in the varsity boatings.
Only three of the seven veterans of
the 1928 season are now in the var
sity shell, Ebright having unceremoni
ously revised his first combination
this week in an effort to improve per
formance.
Pete Donlon at stroke, Bill Thomp
son at No. 5, and Fran Fredericks at
No. 4 were the only members of last
year's world champion eight to sur
vive the reorganization. Von Tillow,
member of the 1926 and 1927 varsi
ties, returned to college this year and
has been assigned No. 7 oar, while
Fratessa, a former jayvee man has
the No. G seat. The balance of the
boat is composed of Bob Woodward,
No. 3; Bob Smith, No. 2 and Lee
Pope, bow. Woodward and Pope were
in last year's first freshman boat,
while Smith is an ex-jayvee man.
Montgomery is now coxing.
The Jayvee is now boated with
Workman at stroke; Judah No. 7;
Herb Smith No. 6; Dally No. 5;
Brinck No. 4; Hayes No. 3; Stlmson
No. 2 and Silva, bos. Logan is cox.
Workman, Dally, and Brinck were all
in the 1928 Olympic crew.
It is not believed that either of
these boatings will be permanent, as
it is a policy of Ebright's to change
the boatings frequently, giving every
man a chance in the effort to find
a perfect combination.
All' varsity crews have been put
through Btiffer workouts each night,
and are now clipping off from six to
eight miles. Coach Russ Nagler has
also been tightening up on his fresh
men.

The Jayvee is now boated with
Workman at stroke; Judah No. 7;
Herb Smith No. 6; Dally No. 5;
Brinck No. 4; Hayes No. 3; Stlmson
No. 2 and Silva, bos. Logan is cox.
Workman, Dally, and Brinck were all
in the 1928 Olympic crew.
It is not believed that either of
these boatings will be permanent, as
it is a policy of Ebright's to change
the boatings frequently, giving every
man a chance in the effort to find
a perfect combination.
All' varsity crews have been put
through Btiffer workouts each night,
and are now clipping off from six to
eight miles. Coach Russ Nagler has
also been tightening up on his fresh
men.

the 1928 season are now in the var
sity shell, Ebright having unceremoni
ously revised his first combination

formance.
Pete Donlon at stroke, Bill Thomp
son at No. 5, and Fran Fredericks at
No. 4 were the only members of last
year's world champion eight to sur
vive the reorganization. Von Tillow,

the No. G seat. The balance of the
