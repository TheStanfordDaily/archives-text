# OLD BOY'S WARES WILL BE HAWKED ON 'FARM' TODAY

"Chappie! Chappie! Who wants a.
Chappie?"
Once again, this time in flaming j
red, will the girls hold sway at the !
Engineering corner to wring the al- j
mighty quarter from the unwary. At j
S o'clock this morning, the Old Boy
will pour out his monthly potation of j
wit and humor to the populace in the
form of the famed Ordinary Number,
one of the best issues yet, so he says,
and a very extraordinary one at that.
The celebrated sheet will contain
articles by many of the well-known
campus jokesters. Burnell Gould ex- '
hibits low wit in his illustrated Pun j
Page, but shows his poetic instinct in
"The Walrus and the Carpenter," a
take-off on Curtis and Hoover. Por- j
traits of famous criminals are brought!
to light by Nelson Carter. He is also
the author of "C'est la Guerre," con-;
cerning a recent unearthing of some
old French tapestries. The tapestries
were immediately buried again, so |
that Carter's account is the only one 1
in existence today. A burlesque on
Van Dine's Philo Vance mysteries has j
been written by Bob Paine and bears
the title of "The Mauve Murder Case." J
Tnis thrilling story also contains a ;
minute sketch of where the body was
found. And last but not least there is i
an appeal ,to every loyal American by
the president of the society for pro- \
mulgation of reading subtitles aloud. !
This touching plea urges all to stop 1
the "talkies" that subtitle readers
may have some pleasure out of life.
An instrument has been invented to ;
test one's sensitiveness to sunburn.
