# FROSH BASEBALL TEAM WILL PLAY POLY TOMORROW
## 
### 
The Stanford freshman baseball team
will play the San Francisco Polytechnic
high school team Saturday morning at
10:00 o'clock on the frosh diamond. This
will be the second game of the season for
the Card babes. They beat the Mission
high school squad by the score of 5-2 last
week.
The freshmen do not have the strong
all-around team that represented the year
lings last year, but they shine brilliantly
in spots. The pitching is well taken care
of with Cadell, McLain, and Spencer.
Cadell, especially, has lots of smoke,
which he combines with a clcver change
of pace. In the game with the Missions
last week, he had the high school boys
well in hand during the entire contest.
Evans has been doing most of the
work behind the plate for the frosh. He
is a good hitter as well as a steady back
stop and will undoubtedly start against
Poly. Either McLain or Cadell will start
on the mound.
The infield is pretty inconsistent, Bar
stnnian at second base being its strongest
player. He is fast, covers a large terri
tory, and rarely bobbles one. Third base
is the weak spot just at present, but
Coach Ernie Ncvers is breaking in sev
eral new men for the hot corner.
Nevers, who has been iti the hospital
for the past week on account of a tonsil
operation, was back at his post last night
and put the men through a stiff workout.
A practice game was played with the
Varsity second team, which the freshmen
won by a 4-3 score. Cadell and Evans
worked for the frosh.
