# LAGUNITA FILLS AS RAIN FALLS; AGUA FLOATS UKELELES
## 
### MARION HASTE 
That lovely rain that went
down the back of your neck this
week was just a "wee bit" of
Nature's Great Scheme â€”each
little drop helped to float a
ukelele. For Lagunita, it is bruited
about, will officially open tomor
row.
Gallons and gallons of agua,
more or less pura, have covered
the pleasant green bottle-strewn
meadows, as Dread Winter has
swept in and out, and now the
musical clink of coins will ac
company the launching of canoes
as the season starts.
Paddles, badly split from emer
gency uses in initiation, will
swing merrily and nightfall will
find the croaking of frogs and
the groaining of music-lovers
smothering the sweet sound ot
portable phonographs.
The management wishes us to
announce that canoe space will
be rented. The editor wishes ua
to anonunce that hereafter the
Daily will take its cut on all
publicity.
