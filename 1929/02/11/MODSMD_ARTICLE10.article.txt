## Aviator Leaves Panama on Return Air Mail Trip To United States 
### 
MANAGUA, Nic., Feb. 10. (JP) â€”Col.
Charles A. Lindbergh, flying one of
two mail planes which left Panama
this morning, arrived here this after
noon.
Lindbergh swooped down on the
landing field at 1:35 p.m. (2:20 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time) three hours
before he had been expected. There
was no one at the field to greet him,
except the Marine Aviation personnel.
Brief stops were made at David,
Panama, and Puntarenas, Costa Rica,
after leaving France Field, Canal
Zone at 6 o'clock this morning. The
Colonel had as a passenger Vice-
President John Hambleton, of the
Pan-American Airways. Another plane
accompanied them and shared the
burden of GB9 pounds of mail.
Colonel Lindbergh will spend the
night here and depart at daylight for
Tela, Honduras. He will be accom
panied by Lieutenant Christian Schilt,
L T .S.M.C., who is going to Miami on
three months' leave of absence to lie
come temporarily district superintend
ent of the airmail route.
After a few days' rest in the Canal
Zone, during which he watched the
naval maneuvers off shore and went
fishing with fellow aviators, Col. Lind
bergh is winging his way home. He
has been invited to attend the inau
guration of Herbert Hoover on March
4.
On his three-day southward flight
from Miami by way of Havana, Belize,
Tela, Managua, Puntarenas, and
David, he covered 2100 miles over sea,
land, and high mountains, a journey
heretofore requiring nearly two weeks.
In reversing his route, he bettered his
time for the Canal Zone-Managua leg
by about two hours.
