# ATHENS DEFEATS VARSITY IN TEN INNING CONTEST
## Many Mistakes, Ragged Play Mar Game; Club Team Makes 8 Errors 
### DON OSWILL 
Although the Athens Club made
eight errors and allowed the varsity
baseball team to score its first five
runs on but two hits, it was able to
defeat the Cards in a tenth-inning
rally which netted them two runs and
the "old ball game." The whole con
test was a comedy of errors, marked
by innumerable bad throws and boots,
ragged fielding, and ending by the
best-hitting team winning 10 to 8.
In the tenth inning with the score
eight all, Taylor fanned the first bat
ter and it looked as if the game was
due for many sjxtra innings. Then
Tierney walked, Mack walked, Jones
advanced both runners on an infield
out, Liechmat, walked, and then Bill
Yore buried the apple out in left field
to score tww men. Taylor fanned
Starsnich to -etire the Clubmen, but
the Cards we«e unable to touch Jones
in their half of the inning.
J. Bill knocKed the ball clear over
into the football field to start the
scoring in the first inning. The Club
men tallied again in the second on a
walk, a wild throw, and a single. In
the third the visitors scored three
more runs when Yore walked, J. Bill
singled, Hardy made a beautiful catch
of Starsnich's foul fly, Bill was trap
ped between second and third and
Churchill trying for Yore at the plate
threw wild, allowing both runners to
score. A hit and a sacrifice added one
more run. Two runs scored in the
seventh on a single by J. Bill and a
home run by Starsnich.
Cards Score in Fourth
Only nine Stanford batters faced
Jones in the first three innings. In
the fourth Wilton was safe on an
error, but was forced at second by
Churchill. Hunken was safe on Tier
ney's error, Cook sacrificed to third
and he stored on Johnson's single.
Hardy hit an easy pop fly to Liech
inan who dropped it and allowed two
men to score. The next inning Laird
singled and scored all the way from
iirst on a wild throw by Jones. In the
sixth Churchill hit the ball three
inches and made three bases when
the catcher threw all the way to
light lield. Two more errors gave the
Cards another run. Stanford made an
other in the eighth and one in the
ninth.
Sid Snow, the wild animal hunter,
had his finger broken by a foul tip in
the seventh inning. There were 110
peanuts for sale, and what's a base
ball game without peanuts. A tree
fell down in the middle of the contest
and all the spectators rushed out for
a moment to see if it had fallen on
an automobile. Anyway, it was a funny
game to watch, and everybody left
satisfied.
