# YEARLING QUINTET CINCHES '29 CUB SERIES 32 TO 17
## Cards Prove Superiority in Second Game to Win Babe Championship 
### 
Chalking up its second consecutive
victory over the California Cubs in
the Cardinal Pavilion last Saturday
night, Stanford's yearling basketball
quintet cinched the 1929 little "big
series" and made the playing of a
third game unnecessary. The Red
shirts were clearly superior and had
little trouble in piling up a lead of 32
to 17 before the end of the contest.

At no time during the game were
the Bear babes in the lead or even
dangerously close, Rintala, Cardinal
guard, started the scoring soon after
the opening whistle when he sank
two baskets in quick succession. From
this point on the Stanford youngsters
steadily increased their lead, except
for a short period in the second half
when the visitors seemed to rally. The
count at half time stood 17 to 8, with
A1 Ray, Card forward, doing a big
majority of the scoring.

In the second period the California
youngsters, led by Kintana, lanky cen
ter, put up a determined fight but
were unable to do more than tem
porarily check the Cardinal advance.
The last half of the second period was
a one-sided affair, the Stanford offense
having little trouble in getting the
ball down the floor at will.
Ray captured high-point honors
with 8 points; although all his scor
ing was done in the first half. Doub
was second with 7 tallies; while Rin
tala and Kelly of Stanford and Kin
tana of California tied for third hon
ors with 6 points each.
Baker and Rintala played consist
ently good games in the defense posi
tions; while Doub succeeded in get
ting the tip-off at will and proved
himself a tower of strength both on
the offense and defense. Giberson,
Cardinal guard, who was substituted
for Rintala in the second half, also
played a good game; although some
what handicapped by his size.
The Stanford youngsters' greatest
strength was in their defense; while
with the Californians conditions were
just reversed, the offense proving the
most capable. Kintana, who showed
himself to be the hardest fighter on
the Bear team, starred for the visi
tors despite the fact that he was play
ing opposite Doub, the most valuable
player on the Stanford five.
