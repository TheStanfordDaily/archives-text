# BEARS DEFEAT CARDS 19-17 TO CINCH P.C. CONFERENCE TITLE
## Harlow Rothert Outstanding Player, High-Point Honors Go to Fawcett in Contest Stanford's Poor Free-Throw Shooting Is Weakest Point; McCandless and Berg Excel 
### 
In a great defensive court battle,
the Stanford basketball team suc
cumbed to the eagers of the Univer
sity of California 19 to 17 in the sec
ond game of the Big Series Saturday
night. Although the Bears proved
their prowess and won the right to
represent the Southern Division in
the Pacific Coast Conference play-off,
the Redshirts, even in defeat, were a
great team.
By sheer aggressiveness they kept
the Bears from duplicating their first
victory of the series. Captain Harlow
Rothert was the outstanding player
of the contest, displaying an uncanny
ability that would have marked him
an all-Coast guard had he uncorked
it earlier in the season.
Bears Excel
Superiority in two fundamentals of
the court game led primarily to the
Bear victory. They were, ability to
make free throws and well-drilled
floorwork.
In free throws California led with
nine out of a possible thirteen, while
Stanford was able to gather only five
in fifteen attempts. This apparent
weakness probably contributed more
to a California victory than to any
other one thing. Once, just before the
final gong with the Bears leading 19-
17, Mike Reynolds, who had replaced
Captain Rothert at guard, had a
chance to cover himself with glory
when he was given two free throws
on a foul committed by Ten Eyck, op
posing center, but he missed both
tries.
Only once during the contest did
the Cards compare with the visitors
in their floorwork, that was when Mc-
Candless was playing at center in
place of Hawkins, and Berg had re
placed Tyler. This new combination
seemed to function more perfectly
than any other. Berg and Fawcett
naturally worked better together as
they have been running mates
throughout the season. And McCand
less, at the pivot position, seemed
better able to cope with the Califor
nians than Hawkins. He was more
susceptible to team play, and followed
in the long shots better than his pre
decessor.
Officiating Questioned
There was some question raised as
to the officiating at the game, and
although the officials made a couple
of questionable decisions and neglect
ed to call a great many personal
fouls, what they did call were pretty
evenly distributed. The decision that
seemed to bother Stanford supporters
most was the one called in the closing
minutes of play by Umpire Bill Hol
lander.
The Cards were trailing 17 to 19
when Tyler got the ball, dribbled
down the court, and passed to Faw
cett who sank a beauty from under
the basket to tie the count —so the
audience thought. But Hollander in
sisted that he had waved his arms
and blown his whistle designating a
foul, before the shot was made. It is
true that lie waved his arms, and the
whistle was probably blown too, but
could not be heard above the roar of
the crowd.
The guards were the outstanding
| stars of the contest. Besides Captain i
ltothert, Tampcke, his running mate, |
played a great game as did the Cali* i
j t'ornia defense men. Tampcke was re- j
| sponsible for the rally in the first '
period, when with the Cards trailing i
10 to 5 he sank two long shots from [
near the center of the floor to put I
them in the running again.
Fawcett was high-point man for the
game scoring eight markers on three
field goals and two free throws. Cap- i
tain Corbin led the Bears with seven. 1
Despite their defeat the Cards scored
six field goals to California's five.

ond game of the Big Series Saturday
night. Although the Bears proved
their prowess and won the right to
represent the Southern Division in
the Pacific Coast Conference play-off,
the Redshirts, even in defeat, were a
great team.
By sheer aggressiveness they kept
the Bears from duplicating their first
victory of the series. Captain Harlow
Rothert was the outstanding player
of the contest, displaying an uncanny
ability that would have marked him
an all-Coast guard had he uncorked
it earlier in the season.
Bears Excel
Superiority in two fundamentals of
the court game led primarily to the
Bear victory. They were, ability to
make free throws and well-drilled
floorwork.
In free throws California led with
nine out of a possible thirteen, while
Stanford was able to gather only five
in fifteen attempts. This apparent
weakness probably contributed more
to a California victory than to any
other one thing. Once, just before the
final gong with the Bears leading 19-
17, Mike Reynolds, who had replaced
Captain Rothert at guard, had a
chance to cover himself with glory
when he was given two free throws
on a foul committed by Ten Eyck, op
posing center, but he missed both
tries.
Only once during the contest did
the Cards compare with the visitors
in their floorwork, that was when Mc-
Candless was playing at center in
place of Hawkins, and Berg had re
placed Tyler. This new combination
seemed to function more perfectly
than any other. Berg and Fawcett
naturally worked better together as
they have been running mates
throughout the season. And McCand
less, at the pivot position, seemed
better able to cope with the Califor
nians than Hawkins. He was more
susceptible to team play, and followed
in the long shots better than his pre
decessor.
Officiating Questioned
There was some question raised as
to the officiating at the game, and
although the officials made a couple
of questionable decisions and neglect
ed to call a great many personal
fouls, what they did call were pretty
evenly distributed. The decision that
seemed to bother Stanford supporters
most was the one called in the closing
minutes of play by Umpire Bill Hol
lander.
The Cards were trailing 17 to 19
when Tyler got the ball, dribbled
down the court, and passed to Faw
cett who sank a beauty from under
the basket to tie the count —so the
audience thought. But Hollander in
sisted that he had waved his arms
and blown his whistle designating a
foul, before the shot was made. It is
true that lie waved his arms, and the
whistle was probably blown too, but
could not be heard above the roar of
the crowd.
The guards were the outstanding
| stars of the contest. Besides Captain i
ltothert, Tampcke, his running mate, |
played a great game as did the Cali* i
j t'ornia defense men. Tampcke was re- j
| sponsible for the rally in the first '
period, when with the Cards trailing i
10 to 5 he sank two long shots from [
near the center of the floor to put I
them in the running again.
Fawcett was high-point man for the
game scoring eight markers on three
field goals and two free throws. Cap- i
tain Corbin led the Bears with seven. 1
Despite their defeat the Cards scored
six field goals to California's five.

victory of the series. Captain Harlow
Rothert was the outstanding player
of the contest, displaying an uncanny
ability that would have marked him
an all-Coast guard had he uncorked
it earlier in the season.
Bears Excel
Superiority in two fundamentals of
the court game led primarily to the
Bear victory. They were, ability to
make free throws and well-drilled
floorwork.
In free throws California led with
nine out of a possible thirteen, while
Stanford was able to gather only five
in fifteen attempts. This apparent
weakness probably contributed more
to a California victory than to any
other one thing. Once, just before the
final gong with the Bears leading 19-
17, Mike Reynolds, who had replaced
Captain Rothert at guard, had a
chance to cover himself with glory
when he was given two free throws
on a foul committed by Ten Eyck, op
posing center, but he missed both
tries.
Only once during the contest did
the Cards compare with the visitors
in their floorwork, that was when Mc-
Candless was playing at center in
place of Hawkins, and Berg had re
placed Tyler. This new combination
seemed to function more perfectly
than any other. Berg and Fawcett
naturally worked better together as
they have been running mates
throughout the season. And McCand
less, at the pivot position, seemed
better able to cope with the Califor
nians than Hawkins. He was more
susceptible to team play, and followed
in the long shots better than his pre
decessor.
Officiating Questioned
There was some question raised as
to the officiating at the game, and
although the officials made a couple
of questionable decisions and neglect
ed to call a great many personal
fouls, what they did call were pretty
evenly distributed. The decision that
seemed to bother Stanford supporters
most was the one called in the closing
minutes of play by Umpire Bill Hol
lander.
The Cards were trailing 17 to 19
when Tyler got the ball, dribbled
down the court, and passed to Faw
cett who sank a beauty from under
the basket to tie the count —so the
audience thought. But Hollander in
sisted that he had waved his arms
and blown his whistle designating a
foul, before the shot was made. It is
true that lie waved his arms, and the
whistle was probably blown too, but
could not be heard above the roar of
the crowd.
The guards were the outstanding
| stars of the contest. Besides Captain i
ltothert, Tampcke, his running mate, |
played a great game as did the Cali* i
j t'ornia defense men. Tampcke was re- j
| sponsible for the rally in the first '
period, when with the Cards trailing i
10 to 5 he sank two long shots from [
near the center of the floor to put I
them in the running again.
Fawcett was high-point man for the
game scoring eight markers on three
field goals and two free throws. Cap- i
tain Corbin led the Bears with seven. 1
Despite their defeat the Cards scored
six field goals to California's five.
