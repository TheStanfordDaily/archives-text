# The 						Bonfire Becomes a Question
## 
### 
Abolish the bonfire!
Build it to the skies!
No, away with it, it's a waste of time!
(>ll the contrary, don't kill our last tradition!
Such will be the hue and cry until tomorrow's balloting silences it.
Practically, the anti-bonfire faction stands on firmer grounds. It is a
wast of time, a waste of energy, and a waste of lumber! For the
freshmen it is a sentimental running around in circles to accomplish
what? A largish fire. For the rest of the student's body its a prelude to
a largish week-end.
But then, Big Game is Big Game, says the bonfire faction, and it
conies but once a year. Enthusiasm is one of its prime factors, and the
old fire expresses this in rip-roaring fashion. The team may be inspired
toward rallying several more touchdowns, who knows? And it's a whale
of a big time.
Consider for a moment whose efforts produce this monster flame.
Incoming freshmen. But who'll build the prayer for victory when these
same freshmen step beside the dodo 011 the shelf of extinct animals? It s
a terrific strain on the imagination to believe that juniors and seniors
will do it. What with the demands of campus activities and those casual
glances into textbooks, one can't visualize these gentlemen casting aside
everything to labor long hours among railroad ties and boxes. The
passing of the bonfire was forecast when abolition of the Lower Division
was first proposed.

Until that time when freshmen cease to be, let those who sweat and
get splinters in their hands make the decision. It's really up to them.
It will be said that that's leaving things as they are, that each class will
want to prove itself as full of spirit as its predecessor, and will decide
to build a fire. That is to be expected. While there still are enough
freshmen with the desire to build a fire, let them do it, but let them
decide themselves, and further put a limit on the thing.
Give the freshmen the week before Big Game to build it in. This
time limitation will naturally limit its size and cut down on time expended
in its construction. The class can turn out as a whole and build up class
spirit while they're stacking up wood for their fire.
Greyed with two bonfires built in freshman year, having lived
through two others, and seen a second fire burned by some pep en
thusiast or embryonic pyromaniac, we can't deny a sentimental attachment
to the old holocaust to victory, yet sobered a bit by the bitter experience
of the two burnt prematurely and the labor of the others, we do see it as
waste and collegiate folderol. So we would pass it on to the next
generation, and let them decide, and let them build within limitations.
