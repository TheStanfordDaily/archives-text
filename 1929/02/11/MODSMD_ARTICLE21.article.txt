# Is This Sportsmanship?

Booing, the old curse of rooting sections, is upon us again. Saturday's
game was a trying event for those who saw it from the Stanford angle,
yet whatever the outcome of the game, it was quite evident that booing
not only failed to gain the end it had in the doing, but proved a definite
detriment. Aside from its effect on the game, it was rotten poor sports
manship. No team can get very far with a bunch of poor sports
backing it.
