# Campus Dramatics Scores
## 
### 
Congratulations are in order. Gordon Davis and Harold Helvenston
turned out one of the finest plays this campus has seen in a blue moon
Friday last. Those who didn't see it are sorry; those who did want to
see it again. From curtain to curtain the play clicked off with profes
sional precision. The cast was excellent. The costumes and settings were
well done. In fact one can't do more than express praise for it.
Now with such a production accomplished under the physical handi
caps of the Assembly Ilall stage, what can be expected when that New
Theatre is an actuality? We mull the idea over in our head and revel in
the imagining.
To date the fund has swelled over the two thousand mark. A drop
in the bucket perhaps when compared to the required $3(30,000, yet being
young, we still believe that mighty oaks from little acorns grow, and
we aren't anticipating disillusionment.
Oyez, oyez, have you given your mite to the Theatre Fund?
But back to the subject of this editorial, Friday's play, it was a top
notcher and we're glad to know that we are most unoriginal in saying
that, because there are a thousand other people who, having seen it, say
the same thing.
