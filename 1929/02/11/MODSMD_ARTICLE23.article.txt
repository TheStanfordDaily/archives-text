Today's masthead carries the news of a promotion. Adele Smith and
Leonard Bartlett have moved up the ladder another rung. They will
henceforth serve as copy editors. Both have proved by their splendid
service to the Daily that they not only merit the advancement but, now
that they have gained it will prove themselves capable of their new jobs.
Congratulations.
