# Leaders Discuss Points Involved In Class of '29 Endowment Vote
## 
### RICHARD GUGGENHIME BEVERLEY McANEAR 
114 EMBERS of the Class of 1929 will decide at tomorrow's Quad election to
what purpose the senior endowment will be put. Out of a mass of
preliminary suggestions, two major propositions have emerged for the choice
of the graduating class itself.
The proposals to be voted upon by the senior class tomorrow are: 1. An
endowment for instruction and research; 2. An endowment for.a research
library in a particular department.
To facilitate a clearer understanding of the two propositions to be voted
upon tomorrow, leaders of the two factions have prepared the following
discussions of the various points involved:

The Instruction and Research plan
seeks to establish a fund which can
be used by the administration for the
purposes embodied in the title to
meet the needs of the various depart
ments of the University as the needs
arise.
The expenditures of the University
are divided under two general heads:
the Comptroller's Budget and the
President's Budget. All matters of
maintenance are taken care of under
the Comptroller's Budget. The Presi
dent's Budget is subdivided into three
parts:
Academic* Administration and Gen
eral (including such items as the
president's office, registrar's office,
lower division, alumni secretary, dean
of women, dean of men, pension fund,
publicity, scholarships, etc.).
Instruction and Research Schools
and Departments (under which divi
sion come all the regular departments
of the University such as law, busi
ness administration, journalism, en
gineering, biology, languages, history,
economics, political science, mathe
matics, physics, chemistry, psychol
ogy, and philosophy).
Independent Departments and Divi
sions, Academic (gymnasiums, libra
ries, university museum, and Memo
rial Church).
By endowing a fund for Instruction
and Research the expenditure of the
money so given would be limited to
equipment and salaries in the regular
departments of the University. The
needs of the various departments vary
from year to year and such a fund
would allow the administration to put
the money to use where it is most
needed. It should be remarked that in
any progressive university the future
of any one department cannot be
prophesied with any degree ol' accu
iacy. Twenty-five or even ten years
from now the organization and needs
of the various departments may be
vastly different.

Various national education bodies
such as the General Education Board
and the Carnegie Institute offer to the
University from year to year what
are known as contingent funds. This
year, for example, the General Educa
tion Board will contribute one dollar
for every dollar which Stanford can
raise for instruction and research.
The conditions under which these
contingent funds are offered differ
from year to year, and by endowing a
fund which is not pinned down to a
particular department the administra
tion is enabled to use the money
where there is the most favorable con
tingent offer.

The attitude and desire of the ad
ministration favoring an endowment
for Instruction and Research rather
than one for a particular department
is well set forth in a letter to one of
the members of the Senior Endow
ment Committee from Comptroller
Roth printed below:
February 6, 1929
Dear Sir:
Confirming our conversation of to
day, I am sending you herewith a
copy of the Annual Report of the
President and Comptroller of Stan
ford University.
On page 66 of this Report you will
find an anlysis of the expenditures of
the University, under various classi
fication covering the different depart
ments and divisions.
You will note that there is a spe
cial division entitled "Instruction and
Research Schools and Departments"
which covers salaries and equipment
expenditures of the various schools
and departments of the University,
exclusive of independent departments,
such as the Library and gymnasium.
Items of maintenance, including
such general items as heating, light
ing, insurance, maintenance of
grounds, etc., are included in a sepa
rate division under "Business Admin
istration and General" on page 69.
It is my opinion that any gift to the
University for the purpose of instruc
tion and research would have to be
expended under the direction of the
President and departmental heads for
salaries and equipment, and could not
be expended for any of the purposes
under the Comptroller's division.
The greatest need which any uni
versity faces is the need for funds for
general academic purposes. At Stan
ford the future growth of the Univer
sity, and the maintenance of the high
standard of present departments, de
pend absolutely upon securing addi
tional gifts with which to meet sal
ary increases at other institutions,
and special equipment necessary in
various fields.
It has been the experience of many
of the older universities that the most
useful gift which the university can
receive is a gift for general academic
purposes, as this permits shifting to
any particular department which may
be in need of special funds.
Yours very truly,
(Signed) A. E. ROTH

The proposal to endow a special de
partment or school for the purpose of
creating a great library collection in
a fairly limited field would provide,
in twenty-five years, for a library that
would be famous throughout the na
tion. Fields could be chosen —five
have been suggested—which would
make its value, permanent.
To this University, graduate stu
dents would be attracted to work in
the collection; faculty members could
have their research facilitated, thus
bringing added note to the name of
the University; new members of the
faculty would be of a constantly
higher level as the value of the col
lection to their work became more
patent as the collection grew larger.
Such collections are needed in every
school and department of the Univer
sity; they are of primal necessity to
any work In the School of Arts and
Letters: they cannot be dispensed
with in the various schools of sci
ences. In the latter group, it is tra«
that the laboratory appears to play
the primary role, but in reality the
library is as important as the labora
tory, for projected work is always
checked in the library to prevent
duplication of effort. Yet the Univer
sity has only one great collection in
any school —the Hoover War Library
—and it is significant that it was
given by special endowment. It is
true that our money could not build
such a library as that, but in a less
extended field it would build one as
fine.

It is evident, then, that the Univer
sity would find great value from the
library our endowment might create.
Nor would such use of our endow
ment lessen the ability of the Uni
versity to match funds with our con
tributions. Now, at the last class
meeting, the statement was made that
a large sum of money was available
for matching this endowment at a
$7-$5 ratio. However, there is at the
present time, according to Mr. Sel
lards, who handles the raising of gifts
for Stanford, but one fund available
for matching. This fund —of $750,000
—must be matched dollar for dollar
and may only be applied to the fields
of chemistry, physics, mathematics,
and biology. And, if the class so de-

sired, funds, spent under this plan,
could be turned to matching this sum
until, in three or four years, the whole
amount could be secured from this
and other sources. This aim, accord
ing to Mr. Sellards, could be accom
plished by the simple device of en-

dowing the Department of Biology for
library uses. Later, when the sum had
been matched, our endowment could
continue to build one of the greatest
biological libraries in the West.

The suggestion that this endowment
could be used indefinitely to match
various sums is questionable, for not
only are there no other such funds in
sight, but also such gifts are intended
to attract new endowment and the ap
plication of money already pledged
would not be ethically above re
proach. Further, the meeting of any
such sums as might later be endowed
could be met by later classes.

And, if this class shall create such
a library collection as has been sug
gested, later classes will follow to es
tablish like collections in other fields.
For it seems that the desire to build,
to actively, personally create will
move them as fully as it will move us
in years to come. Nor will that be
the only influence that will bind this
class to a library collection more
tightly than to an "Instruction and
Research" fund. As years pass, seri
ous changes will be made in the Uni
versity and many people shall find the
school they remembered vanishing.
Many such people are likely to re
fuse to give money to that administra
tion in order to carry out the changes
they dislike; to such people, a spe
cific fund such as this would seem to
be independent of administrative
havoc.
Such people are not in the majority,
however, and to most that considera
tion cannot appeal. But the majority
who have left the school and its prob
lems at one stroke will find far more
interest in such a library collection as
this. For they will have the feeling
they are doing the job well, building
a perfect unit in the school to loave
to posterity. No vain vaunting would
it be to point to such a collection,
rather would there be the quiet satis
faction of perfection.

And it is such a memorial —a per
l feet unit in itself that it is suggested
, we leave to the University. It shal
i build for the school; it shall add to
world thought; it shall build a me
morial to our school life. We are not
building a memorial to ourselves, it
' must be remembered, but to our
school life, soon to be ended, and we
J therefore are building to fin ideal.
| Perfectionism seems the truest ex
| pression of an ideal; and such a col
i lection as this endowment would ere

ate would be our nearest approach to
perfection.
