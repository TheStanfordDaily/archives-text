# The 						Bull session
## AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT COOLIDGE 
### 
(With apologies to Will Rogers)

Dear Mr. President:
Well, you now have on your desk,
to say nothing of your mind, the
Cruiser Bill. Or that is, you have
what's left of it now that the Sena
torial filibuzzards have festooned it
with amendments.
We know how irked you must be,
Mr. President, at having that time
claure run in on your white hope.
Here everything was going nicely
down the home stretch of your term,
and, although nobody knows what to
do with fifteen cruisers, it looked like
it would be a fine, Republican sort
of gesture to build them.
And then what happened? Well,
contrary to all laws of man and na
ture, a flock of Democrats tried to
ruin everything by agreeing with the
Republicans. They supported the bill,
too.
And next, what do they do but tack
on an amendment specifying that all
these shiny new cruisers must be
started before July 1, 1931. Even if
that only means starting the hulls,
and letting them lay around unfinished
for twenty years or so, it's a nuisance
to have to think about hulls when
the fish are biting so fine.
That ought to make you pretty mad,
Mr. President. We bet you are itching
to veto that bill.

Well, why not? Of course you will
probably wait until next Saturday,
just to let hard feelings calm down,
but, when the ten-day limit is up, why
not veto it?
You're almost through, Mr. Presi
dent. It's been a tough job, and you've
earned lots more than your seventy
ilve grand per year, even if you were
sort of sparse with the smiles and the
cowboy suit wouldn't lit. And here
John is going to marry a mighty fine
girl, and pretty soon you can get
away from all the ax-grinders and
wander around, fishing and resting,
without a trouble in the world. You
haven't a thing to lose now, Mr. Presi
dent. Why not veto it?
We've always counted on you, Mr.
President. We knew you were going
to do something great, and now your
chance has come. Maybe a few Sena
tors would feel insulted, but the fish
wouldn't. They're broad-minded, and
they'll keep right on biting for you no
matter what you do.
And so, Mr. President, we hope that
you will send your name clanging
down in history louder than a fire
alarm by getting into a first-class
Vermont huff and vetoing the Cruiser
Bill.
Yours, Winston Norman.

and, although nobody knows what to
do with fifteen cruisers, it looked like
it would be a fine, Republican sort
of gesture to build them.
And then what happened? Well,
contrary to all laws of man and na
ture, a flock of Democrats tried to
ruin everything by agreeing with the
Republicans. They supported the bill,
too.
And next, what do they do but tack
on an amendment specifying that all
these shiny new cruisers must be
started before July 1, 1931. Even if
that only means starting the hulls,
and letting them lay around unfinished
for twenty years or so, it's a nuisance
to have to think about hulls when
the fish are biting so fine.
That ought to make you pretty mad,
Mr. President. We bet you are itching
to veto that bill.

Well, why not? Of course you will
probably wait until next Saturday,
just to let hard feelings calm down,
but, when the ten-day limit is up, why
not veto it?
You're almost through, Mr. Presi
dent. It's been a tough job, and you've
earned lots more than your seventy
ilve grand per year, even if you were
sort of sparse with the smiles and the
cowboy suit wouldn't lit. And here
John is going to marry a mighty fine
girl, and pretty soon you can get
away from all the ax-grinders and
wander around, fishing and resting,
without a trouble in the world. You
haven't a thing to lose now, Mr. Presi
dent. Why not veto it?
We've always counted on you, Mr.
President. We knew you were going
to do something great, and now your
chance has come. Maybe a few Sena
tors would feel insulted, but the fish
wouldn't. They're broad-minded, and
they'll keep right on biting for you no
matter what you do.
And so, Mr. President, we hope that
you will send your name clanging
down in history louder than a fire
alarm by getting into a first-class
Vermont huff and vetoing the Cruiser
Bill.
Yours, Winston Norman.

Dear Mr. President:
Well, you now have on your desk,
to say nothing of your mind, the
Cruiser Bill. Or that is, you have
what's left of it now that the Sena
torial filibuzzards have festooned it
with amendments.
We know how irked you must be,
Mr. President, at having that time
claure run in on your white hope.
Here everything was going nicely
down the home stretch of your term,
and, although nobody knows what to
do with fifteen cruisers, it looked like
it would be a fine, Republican sort
of gesture to build them.
