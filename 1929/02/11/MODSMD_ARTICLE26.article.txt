# TRACK PROSPECTS RISE IN PRACTICE CONTEST FRIDAY
## Time in Century Is 9 4-5 s. Nichols Beats Edmonds In High Hurdles 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
Some outstanding early season per
formances in the regular practice
meet last Friday indicate that Stan
ford's varsity track and field men are
rapidly rounding into form for an
other victorious year, to eliminate
perhaps in a third 1.C.4-A. champion
ship in as many years. Despite the
cold weather, some exceptional pre
season times were made Saturday.

Johnny Morrison, successor to Cap
tain Bud Spencer in the quarter-mile
event, ran the single lap Friday in
50 4-5 s. Last year he ran consistently
50 s., getting down to 48 s. on several
occasions and should do even better
this year. Schove, Hay ('32), and
Syer finished behind in the order
named.
John Lauritzen, varsity sprinter for
two years, ran one heat of the cen
tury in 10 flat and a few minutes later
repeated his win, this time in 9 4-5 s.
Dyer and McDermott, sophomores,
were right behind in both races and
Dyer finished ahead of Lauritzen in
the 220-yard dash in the time of 22 s.
Apparently, Coach "Dink" Templeton
has little to worry about in the
sprints.
Don Nelson, '29, won the low hur
dles in 24 1-5 8. which is good enough
to win in most of the dual meets the
Cards will engage in this year.
Captain Robs Nichols, after trailing
Ward Edmonds in the high hurdles
event for several weeks, came through
yesterday to win two heats in 15 2-5 s.
In each heat "Podge" Smith, sopho
more, and Edmonds were second and
third, respectively.

Bob Brown, sophomore distance
man, won the two-mile, running the
eight laps in 10 m. 10 2-5 s. Alex Mc-
Kinnon, varsity miler for the last two
years, has been shifted to the half
mile and finished first Friday in 2 m.
4 2-5 s. He has lots of speed and
endurance and should pull this time
down under two minutes before the
opening meet with the Olympic Club
March 9.

In the field events, Eric Krenz of
Olympic fame, turned in his usual
double win, putting the shot 45 ft.
10% in. and tossing the discus 139 ft.
6 in.
In the broad jump, high jump, and
pole vault the marks Friday were not
exceptional. Perelli-Miuetti hurled the
javelin 177 ft. 5 in. for a first in this
event.
