## Big Names in Golf 
### BY "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
A mighty name in golf is Smith,
mightier than any other, with the pos
sible exception of Jones. Could the
Smith golfers beat the Jones golfers?
I don't mean to match all the golfers
named Smith against all the golfers
named Jones —that would be too much
of a good thing—but for the four or
five best Smiths to tangle with the
four or five best Joneses.
Horton Smith is the latest sensa
tion among the golf professionals.
Until this winter he was an unknown
pro in Joplin, Missouri. He jumped
into fame overnight, so to speak, by
beating Walter Hagen by one stroke
in the $2500 Catalina Island open
tournament, and since then he's been
going like a house afire. Sir Walter
the Great chose his conqueror as a
member of the United States Ryder
Cup team, which plays at Leeds, Eng
land, in April.

Macdonald Smith, Great Neck, U.Y.,
cannot be on the Ryder Cup team, as

|he was born in Carnoustie, Scotland.
' Mac was winning American tourna
ments back in 1910, and his recent
i feat of successfully defending his title
;as winner of the 1928 Los Angeles
$10,000 open was no small feather in
j his cap. He would oppose Bobby
| Jones in the Smith-Jones tournament,
i and might win — but probably
j wouldn't. Horton Smith would oppose
Dick Joues, semi-finalist ir. the 192f>
I U.S. amateur tournament Alex Smith,
j Mac's older brother, and L T .S. open
j champion in 1906 and 1910, would op
pose Rowland Jones, famous English
j pro of hole-in-one fame. As to the
rest of this Smith-Jones feud, pair the
competitors as you see fit and toss a
coin to decide the winner.
