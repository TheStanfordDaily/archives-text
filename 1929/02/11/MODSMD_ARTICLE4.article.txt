# NINE PEOPLE TAKE ACCIDENTAL PLUNGE INTO ICY LAGUNITA
## 
### 
Lagunita's icy waters baptized
nine persons over the week-end.
Closely following the formal
opening of the big pond last
Saturday, two women and seven
men inagurated, for this year,
the ancient gripe ot' getting into
hot water —or rather, in this
case, extremely cold water. Three
tasted the muddy aqua on the
opening day and six more yes
terday.
None of fie victims had rub
ber boots or were suitably
clothed for the occasion, and
loud were the wails at the un
expected soaking of the trousers
and dresses. It all goes to show,
freshmen, that one should keep
two hands on the paddle.
