# BUDDY ROGERS ALTERS JOURNALISTIC AMBITIONS TO BECOME MOVIE STAR
## Leading Man of "Wings" Enters Paramount School for Six Months' Intensive Training; Takes Lead in Three Box Office Hits Immediately 
### BEN MADDOX 
Three years ago a junior at the
University of Kansas, majoring in
journalism and making collegiate
boom-boom with his fellow brothers
of Phi Kappa Psi. Today the most
popular young male star in the mov
! ies.
Buddy Rogers, star of "Wings" and
| many other big hits of the past two
S years, was in the city recently and
we had quite a talk up at the Sir
Francis Drake where he was staying.
"It feels fine," he says when you ask
him how it seems to be suddenly
pyramided into worldwide fame, lie's
just twenty-four and you can easily
imagine how much fun it would be to
be sitting 011 top of the theatrical
! world at that age.
He is not a smarty, and the fact
i that he's being paid some hundreds
a week has not affected his good na
! ture. Buddy is something new in the
way of screen stars —he's not an
"import" nor is he a Merton at last
fulfilling his dreams. He grew up
. much as you and I —in the little town
of Olathe, Kansas, where his father
owns the newspaper.
Played His Way
When it came time to go on to col
: lege, Buddy picked the state univer
sity. He plays five musical instru
ments, specializing on the trombone,
piano, and drums, and he made his
pocket money by playing in a college
! dance orchestra.
And just to show you how regular
i he is, I'll tell you about his trip to
i Europe. "Did I go first class? I
| should say not! A dozen of us fel
iows got a job chauffeuring a boat
load of mules across to Spain," he
reminisces. "That sot us over, but
staying was the real problem. We or
ganized a dance orchestra and played
ourselves around France."
When the fall of his senior year
opened, the home town theatre man
ager entered Buddy's picture with ap
plications for the Paramount training
school. Forty thousand ambitious
I young men and women tried to enroll
I in this novel school. The Paramount
1 company, in quest of new faces, de
cided 011 the twelve best of each sex
and proceeded to give them a six
; months' intensive preparation for
| screen acting in New York City. The
"baby stars" assembled from all parts
of the country, and the roster includ
ed Buddy Rogers, of Kansas, much to
that young man's astonishment. "I
never had any idea when I was in
college that I'd be good in dramatics,"
he admits now.
Does a Horatio Alger
And, like a true Horatio Alger hero,
Buddy was chosen to be the leading
j man in the picture made at the end
I of the six months' training. It was
j called "Fascinating Youth" and all
: twenty-four of the "babes" had roles.
Buddy, who is unusually nice-look
; ing in person, screened like the pro
verbial million. He has never played
i anything less than the lead —no sup
porting or extra roles. He was the
j Paramount school's foremost gradu

ate, and after playing in two pro
gram pictures in Ilollyood, he was
awarded a great plum, the lead oppo
site Mary Pickford in "My Best Girl."
That picture put Buddy definitely 011
the Hollywood map. He was reward
ed with the lead in "Wings," Clara
Bow pursued him in "Get Your Man,"
and Anne Nichols' "Abie's Irish Itose"
was expensively produced with young
Mr. Rogers featured.
He was terribly lucky, and he says
so himself, to play in these three hits.
And his popularity at the box-office
grew by such leaps and bounds that
Paramount has made him a star in
his own right. He has been seen in
two of his own stellar productions al
ready, Mary Brian —who is his idea of
The Perfect Weakness — being his
leading lady in both.
Is In Talkies Now
Having just completed an all-talkie,
"Close Harmony," he is now doing
another vocal picture—"Young Sin
ners." If you have suffered from the
talkies you'll be glad to know that
Buddy doesn't think much of them
either. But he has to do them, and
right now he's taking piano lessons —
that's one thing we uncelebrated es
cape! He sings well, his voice is okay,
he admitted in a moment of absent
mindedness that he could play all
those instruments —and now the talk
ies have got him!
"I've learned a lot about different
sports since I've been in the movies,"
he says. "I learned to ski and ice
skate for 'Fascinating Youth,' and I
did more than a hundred hours of ac
tual flying for 'Wings.' My younger
brother, who graduated from high
school this year, is going to Kansas
for three years and then try pictures
—doing just as I did.
"I don't go around a lot with the
movie crowd." He doesn't want to
lose his sense of perspective — and
anyone getting several thousand "fan"
letters a day is liable to —so he lives

with a fraternity brother and this
{ friend's mother and sister.
He is unanimously praised by all
j the Hollywood celebrities, and his fu
ture should be a great one because
, the feminine theatre-goers think him
the ideal "hero," and the men all wish
they looked like him.
And I shouldn't have called him
i Buddy—his real name is Charles and
jhe thinks Buddy souuds silly—"just
I like you're calling a dog!" I'm afraid
i this friendly nickname is going to
I stick, however.
Don't be too surprised if one of
your friends turns out to be a movie
idol four years from now. It can be
j done!
