# NEARING PREDICTS SOCIAL REVOLT IN CAPITALISTIC U.S.
## Socialist Chuckles at Idea Of "Liberal" Stanford; Flays Big Business 
### 
"A long series of depressions, un
employment, and war will bring about
a social revolution in the United
States," said Scott Nearing, socialist
lecturer and writer, in an interview
last Saturday morning. "The people
will stand just so much, and then they
will kick it over.

"The social change will not be
brought about by education —but by
revolution as in Russia. Who controls
education? Big business interests in
fluence and direct our school systems.
There can be no social evolution
through education, because instruc
tors who teach such a change are dis
missed. Big business gets rid of
those it doesn't like."
Nearing, who is well-known
throughout the nation as a free
thinker, was speaking from experi
ence. In 1915 he was discharged from
the faculty of the University of
Pennsylvania because of his "radical
teachings," and a few years later he
was dismissed from Toledo Univer
sity, Ohio, on similar charges.
"Colleges are business propositions,
just like banks and factories. Big
business men run our universities.
Private colleges are not necessarily
more broadminded than public ones.
The University of Wisconsin, for ex
ample, is quite liberal —as colleges
go."
When asked what he thought of
Stanford as being a liberal university,
Nearing slapped his knee and
chuckled, "Just stop and consider
what type of men compose the ad
ministration board of Stanford.
"What do I think of Hoover as
president? Mr. Hoover is a perfect
representative of the United States —
an unscrupulous, aggressive executive
in an unscrupulous, aggressive em
pire."
Nearing believes that the United
States is becoming too imperialistic
and that our foreign policy will ulti
mately lead to war with Great Britain.
We are gaining more and more con
trol over Canada through investments.
And even today New York business
interests are consulted before the
Canadian government makes a move.
"The Kellogg Peace Treaty is a
marked preparation for war. The
United States is lining up against
Great Britain. The recent affair be
tween Bolivia and Paraguay is an ex
ample of the growing antagonism—a
political struggle cropping out because
of differences between English and
American oil concerns. The Cruiser
Bill means that we will have the larg
est navy in the world —a direct pre
paration for the next war."

"The Kellogg Peace Treaty is a
marked preparation for war. The
United States is lining up against
Great Britain. The recent affair be
tween Bolivia and Paraguay is an ex
ample of the growing antagonism—a
political struggle cropping out because
of differences between English and
American oil concerns. The Cruiser
Bill means that we will have the larg
est navy in the world —a direct pre
paration for the next war."
"A long series of depressions, un
employment, and war will bring about
a social revolution in the United
States," said Scott Nearing, socialist
lecturer and writer, in an interview
last Saturday morning. "The people
will stand just so much, and then they
will kick it over.

"The social change will not be
brought about by education —but by
revolution as in Russia. Who controls
education? Big business interests in
fluence and direct our school systems.
There can be no social evolution
through education, because instruc
tors who teach such a change are dis
missed. Big business gets rid of
those it doesn't like."
Nearing, who is well-known
throughout the nation as a free
thinker, was speaking from experi
ence. In 1915 he was discharged from
the faculty of the University of
Pennsylvania because of his "radical
teachings," and a few years later he
was dismissed from Toledo Univer
sity, Ohio, on similar charges.
"Colleges are business propositions,
just like banks and factories. Big
business men run our universities.
Private colleges are not necessarily
more broadminded than public ones.
The University of Wisconsin, for ex
ample, is quite liberal —as colleges
go."
When asked what he thought of
Stanford as being a liberal university,
Nearing slapped his knee and
chuckled, "Just stop and consider
what type of men compose the ad
ministration board of Stanford.
"What do I think of Hoover as
president? Mr. Hoover is a perfect
representative of the United States —
an unscrupulous, aggressive executive
in an unscrupulous, aggressive em
pire."
Nearing believes that the United
States is becoming too imperialistic
and that our foreign policy will ulti
mately lead to war with Great Britain.
We are gaining more and more con
trol over Canada through investments.
And even today New York business
interests are consulted before the
Canadian government makes a move.
