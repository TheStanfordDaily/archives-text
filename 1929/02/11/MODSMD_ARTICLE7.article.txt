# Barrie Comedy Is Dramatic Staff, Campus Triumph
## Katherine Keho as "Maggie Wylie" Responsible for Unusual Success 
### JOHN ROGERS 
"What Every Woman Knows" was
not a single triumphâ€”it was a series
of them. What might have been just
another campus play was turned into
! the most outstanding production the
| present generation has witnessed,
both dramatically and pictorially.
There was Katherine Keho's beauti
lul interpretation of Maggie Wylie,
and the general excellence of the rest
of the cast, and Gordon Davis' even
better than usual directing, and Har
old llelvenston's ingenious settings,
not to mention the Helen Hayes* con
cise version of Sir James Carrie's ro
mantic comedy.
Katherine Keho carried the show,
and it is she who is most responsible
for the unusual success of the produc
tion. Without her, it would have been
a better-than-average University play,
but she brought the production up to
professional heights. Miss Keho, in
spite of the sentimental appeal of her
part, did not exceed the bounds of re
straint, and the quiet smoothness of
her acting set the tempo for the play.
She succeeded in establishing a dis
tinct, sympathetic bond between her
self and the audience which is a re
markable achievement for a campus
actor.
McDowell Praised
Secohd honors go to Jack Mc-
Dowell, who, as John Shand, gave an
excellent interpretation of the egotis
tical, humorless husband. His was a
difficult role to portray, appearing al
most negative in character beside
that of Maggie, and that he made it
as natural and effective as he did was
due entirely to his own dramatic abili
ties.
Louise Buxton, as the Comtesse de
Briere, played the mature, sophisti
cated French noblewoman with both
vigor and finesse. Helen Ward, the
young Lady Sybil Lazenby, did her
best campus work to date. She played
the superficial butterfly most grace
fully.
Of the three Wylie brothers, Her
bert Wenig and Lionel Walford, as
David and Alick, outshone Arthur
Hurt, who played James, largely be
cause theirs were the better parts,
though Hurt did good comedy work.
Marvin Freedman, as Mr. Venable of
Parliament, managed well the diffi
cult task of portraying a gushing,
middle-aged Englishman.
Helvenston's Sets Lauded
Certainly too much cannot be said
in praise of Harold Helvenston's sets,
the first (and best) of which earned
applause. He produced wonders with
his semi-permanent set, in which
doors, windows, fireplaces, and blank
walls were interchangeable. And in
the matter of costumes and furnish
ings, the period of 1906 was excellent
ly suggested.
And lastly it is to be hoped that
members of Friday night's audience
will take Templeton Peck's talk on
the Theatre Fund to heart, for if Gor
don Davis and Harold Helvenston can
put on such an excellent production
in the Assembly Hall, their efforts in
a decently equipped theatre should be
epoch-making.
