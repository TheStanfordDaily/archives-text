## Famous Inventor Believes It Possible to Compete With Tropics in Rubber Growing Although Eighty-Two Years Old, Electric Wizard to Continue Present Work 
### 
FORT MYERS, Fla., Feb. 11. (/P)—
Thomas Alva Edison became 82 years
old today, and received congratula
tions from President-Elect Hoover,
who made a 48-hour journey by auto

interview in the morning and then at
noon took the next President, Ford,
and Firestone, one a motor tour of this
vity.
For the first time since he concen
trated his energy three years ago on
the problem of finding a plant capa
ble of producing within the United
States the nation's rubber supply,
Mr. Edison admitted that "it might be
possible in the future to grow rubber
and compete with the tropics."
"Is it true that you have found a
plant that promises to solve the rub
ber production problem in the United
States and do you hope to develop it
this winter?" reporters asked Edison.
To this Mr. Edison replied:
"I have found over 1200 plants to
produce rubber. About forty of them
will be cultivated on a large scale."
