# J. Earl Baker Will Speak On 'China Revisited'
## Famine Relief Worker to Describe Chinese Life, Customs Tonight 
### 
John Earl Maker, a noted relief worker |
in China, will speak on "China Revisited" [
in the Assembly Hall this evening at
7:30 o'clock. His lecture will be based .
on the perilous trips he made through j
China last year in order to make a survey -
of the famine conditions.
Baker was probably the first for- j
eigner to make the overland trip from j
Shanghai to Peking after the close of
military operations. He traveled for the ;
greater portion of his journey without j
escort or interpreter and was forced to j
depend on his own limited vocabulary in J
his relations with the people. He carried j
famine relief money into bandit territory ,
and had many near escapes from attack
by these "little brothers."
The purpose of Baker's trip was to ob- j
tain first-hand information on the famine j
situation in China, for even missionaries
in the field were dependent on reports
from their Chinese associates rather than
upon their own observations.
In his position of Adviser on Railway
Administration of the Chinese Ministry
of Communications from 1916 to 1926,
Baker effected the consolidation of six
teen railways and compiled the first nine
statistical reports of the Chinese gov
ernment. He was appointed Controller of
Famine Relief Transportation in 1920,
when lie was able to deliver twice as great
an amount of foodstuffs as Herbert Hoo
ver had estimated possible.
Baker was director of the American
Red Cross China Famine Relief Commis- j
sion, and in 1923 he was made treasurer j
of the China International Relief Com
mission, which carries out famine pre
vention measures in ten provinces.
