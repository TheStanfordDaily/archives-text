# ROBLE CLUB DONATES $175 TO HAMMER AND COFFIN THEATRE FUND
## 
### 
Roble Club unanimously voted $175
to the Hammer and Coffin Society
Theatre Fund last night. With the
Iwenty-five dollars added by the
Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority to its
original contribution of $100, and two
individual donations of five dollars,
the total is now brought to $2,283.27.
The individual contributions were
made by Dorothy Garnier, '28, and
A. L. Makle, '30. Miss Gamier, who
played leads in a number of campus
productions and is now doing pro
fessional stage work in the South,
comments in her letter, "This con
tribution is given with gratitude for
the training which I received in dra
matics at Stanford."
Makle, inclosing his donation,
writes, "The theatre is of primary
importance to the students them
selves," and expresses the hope that
ether individual student contributions
will follow.
