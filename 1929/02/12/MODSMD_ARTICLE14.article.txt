# The 						Senior Endowment
## 
### 
The question of class endowment faces the senior who votes today.
He lias heard both plans. Yesterday's Daily carried articles on both.
Now he must decide. Consider the facts.
First of all, the Instruction and Research plan offers an opportunity
to duplicate the class gift dollar for dollar through contingent funds of
various national education bodies. The Special Department Library
plan does not.
Second, the Instruction and Research plan provides an incentive gen
eral enough and of wide enough appeal to gain support from every
member of the class. Whereas the Special Department Library plan
offers incentive only to those who have worked in or contacted that par
ticular department to which the money would be finally given.
Third, the Instruction and Research plan takes into consideration the
element of change; it looks to the future. The Special Department Li
brary plan by its very nature excludes provision for changes in depart
mental activity. That department which is essential today may be un
heard-of tomorrow.
Lastly, if as students we are willing to trust our education and the
conditions under which we study at Stanford in the hands of the ad
ministration, if we trust the administration in this, why should we doubt
its ability and foresight to handle the paltry five dollars we each will
give toward helping the University? Administrative officers of this
institution will be chosen for their pre-eminence in the field of educa
tion always; should we then doubt their ability to use the funds we will
give in the best possible manner?
To do the greatest good to the University as a whole and to do this
with a look to the future, the Senior Class has one choice in placing its
endowment, the endowment for instruction and research.
