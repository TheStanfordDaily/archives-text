t> <S>
Somewhere a little girl named Bar
bara is waiting for a letter. But be
| cause it was addressed in large child
' ish printing simply "From Jean to
I Barbara," it has been unclaimed In
the Stanford postoffice display case
since January 28, and now probably
Barbara thinks she has been forgot
ten. Jean must learn to address his
letter more completely after this, so
that, he won't disappoint his little
friend again.
