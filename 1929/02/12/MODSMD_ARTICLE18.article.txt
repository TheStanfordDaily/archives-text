# CARD BASEBALL NINE WILL MEET OLYMPIC CLUB PLAYERS TODAY
## Professional Players, Former College Stars Will Be On O.C. Roster 
### DON OSWILL 
Stanford's varsity baseball team will
celebrate Lincoln's Birthday by having a
game with the Olympic Club of San
Francisco this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock
on the local diamond. The visiting out
fit is callcd an amateur team, but is com
posed of professional players and former
college stars. Despite the confusing stat
us of the players, the Clubmen have the
material of which a good ball team is !
made.
Jack Nounnan, former Bear captain
and now pitching for the Detroit Tigers,
will probably start on the mound for the
Post Street organization. The Club has
three other good pitchers in Bud De
Neyer, Ray McCormack, and Bob Minty,
so Nounnan will not have to go the
whole route.
Former Cards Appear
The appearance of Bill Maguire and j
Don Garibaldi in the Olympic line-up will
give rise to a little friendly rivalry, as
these men played first and second base j
for last year's varsity. Ira Robie, for- i
mcr Seattle player, is holding down the j
short stop position for the Club. The i
other infielders are Dutch Thompson and
Joe Collins. John Clymer, Heine Thomp
son, and Ed Coopman are the outfielders.
Coach Harry Wolter has decided to
pitch Bill Simpkins against the Club this
afternoon. Simpkins has showed an un
usual amount of ability this year, and has
only been kept off the mound by the large
amount of available pitevhing material.
He has a good battery-mate in "Spud"
Hardy who has turned in some neat
catching performances in the early games.
Third Outfielder Not Named
Hunken and Wilton are sure to start
in the outfield. This pair covcr a lot of
ground in the outfield, and have cut off
quite a few hits during the first three
contests. Hunken has been in a batting
slump, but should soon be recovering his
hitting ability. Wolter has been trying
different men for the third outfield posi
tion, and cither Wright, Allen, or Davis
may start.
The varsity infield has played almost
errorless ball in their games to date.
Laird has been stopping them all on the
torrid corner and makes some fine throws
to first. Johnson and Churchill pull some
fast plays around second, while Cook is
as nice a first baseman as anyone would
want to see.

to first. Johnson and Churchill pull some
fast plays around second, while Cook is
as nice a first baseman as anyone would
want to see.
Stanford's varsity baseball team will
celebrate Lincoln's Birthday by having a
game with the Olympic Club of San
Francisco this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock
on the local diamond. The visiting out
fit is callcd an amateur team, but is com
posed of professional players and former
college stars. Despite the confusing stat
us of the players, the Clubmen have the
material of which a good ball team is !
made.
Jack Nounnan, former Bear captain
and now pitching for the Detroit Tigers,
will probably start on the mound for the
Post Street organization. The Club has
three other good pitchers in Bud De
Neyer, Ray McCormack, and Bob Minty,
so Nounnan will not have to go the
whole route.
Former Cards Appear
The appearance of Bill Maguire and j
Don Garibaldi in the Olympic line-up will
give rise to a little friendly rivalry, as
these men played first and second base j
for last year's varsity. Ira Robie, for- i
mcr Seattle player, is holding down the j
short stop position for the Club. The i
other infielders are Dutch Thompson and
Joe Collins. John Clymer, Heine Thomp
son, and Ed Coopman are the outfielders.
Coach Harry Wolter has decided to
pitch Bill Simpkins against the Club this
afternoon. Simpkins has showed an un
usual amount of ability this year, and has
only been kept off the mound by the large
amount of available pitevhing material.
He has a good battery-mate in "Spud"
Hardy who has turned in some neat
catching performances in the early games.
Third Outfielder Not Named
Hunken and Wilton are sure to start
in the outfield. This pair covcr a lot of
ground in the outfield, and have cut off
quite a few hits during the first three
contests. Hunken has been in a batting
slump, but should soon be recovering his
hitting ability. Wolter has been trying
different men for the third outfield posi
tion, and cither Wright, Allen, or Davis
may start.
The varsity infield has played almost
errorless ball in their games to date.
Laird has been stopping them all on the
torrid corner and makes some fine throws
to first. Johnson and Churchill pull some
fast plays around second, while Cook is
as nice a first baseman as anyone would
want to see.
