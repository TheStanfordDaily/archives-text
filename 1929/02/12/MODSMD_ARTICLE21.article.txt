# BONFIRE ABOLITION IS TOPIC OF EUPHRONIA SOCIETY OPEN FORUM
## 
### 
Herbert Wenig, campus debater, ]
speaking in favor of the abolition of i
the bonfire at the open forum con
ducted last night by Euphronia De- â– 
bating Society, stated that the bon
fire is now built by the Southern
Facific Company and not by the Fresh
man Class. The expenditure of money
and time, he continued, is not justi- :
fied by results. Doubt of sincere mo
tive for the bonfire is shown by sug-!
gestions for its being made smaller. !
The importance of maintaining the
bonfire as a tradition and as a spec
tacle for alumni and people of the
peninsula, were stressed by "Spud" i
Harder in his argument for keeping
the bonfire. Abolition of the fire would I
set a precedent for doing away with
even more traditions until "our chil-1
dren won't even be allowed to wear
cords."
If the fire is retained, Harder
thought that most of the present
evils could be eliminated by building
the fire in a week and a half, and
having it guarded by the Scalpers
Society instead of the overburdened
Rally Committee.
