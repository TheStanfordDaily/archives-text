# Hall or Row? Neither
## 
### 
It is bruited about that today's election will fall into the rut followed by
many past elections, the rut of voting on Hall or Row partisan alignments.
That there are factions in political affairs is a universality. That these
factions look to things for their foundation as superficial as the campus
Hall-Row division is another truism. But in national, state, and local poli
tics, balloting is the counting of noses of high-grade morons as well as
intelligent people. The high-grade moron is loyal to a party, not because
of an issue, nor because of a strong leader, but merely because it is that
particular party to which he has always been loyal. Such superficial think
ing and voting can l>e anticipated among high-grade morons, but the like
on a college campus is ridiculous.
In today's voting consider the individuals, their records their abilities;
forget whether they are Hall or Row. Pride in the student body govern
ment or in the class should raise the voter above narrow partisanship, if
intelligence won't. Forget this collegiate Hall-Row complex and vote for
the man.
