# Concerning Suggestions by Campus Opiner
## 
### 
In that easer of the public wrath, the Campus Opinion column, there
is to be found today a letter containing sundry suggestions for the consid
eration of the Daily editor. The editor considers:
1. A news Ixjx for the Daily to be placed at a convenient point and
contributed to by thoughtful students and faculty members would make
an excellent receptacLe for orange peels, chewing gum wrappers, anony
mous diatribes concerning everything, and perhaps an absent-mindedly
placed letter to the girl back home. The idea is fine, but the public is a
fickle beastie with a perverted sense of humor on such occasions. The sug
gestion, were it directed toward the immediate notification of the Daily
editorial office of all news, would be an excellent one. Although the Daily
would love to boast that it knows all, sees all, it can't. So right here and
now it appeals to the public spirited to phone 647 any time any news hap
pens anywhere that the Daily might miss.
Concerning the next suggestions:
2. A review of the Sunday church service printed in Monday's paper
from this newspaper's policy would not be of general enough interest to
merit a half column or so of space. We do not limit publicity on services
before they are given.
3. A receptacle for the return of books during Library closed hours
would l>e a capital idea. This suggestion merits investigation.
4. A new department on the Daily to write short sketches of faculty
members, emphasizing their work, is under way.
5. Steps taken to beautify Lagunita by such means as colored lights
etc. â€”now, now, really, what about the Five Hundred or those spring
moons or the stars or . . . let's kill off the mosquitoes first.
Even though we can heartily agree with only one of the suggestions,
they are appreciated. Criticism, suggestion, news, these make three wel
come visitors to the editor's mail-box.
