# The 						Bonfire Again
## 
### 
That sad, sad day has arrived when the bonfire must he cither abolished
or kqit in status quo. Modification is not to be considered. Bonfire or no
bonfire it is. Upperclassmen are indifferent, underclassmen have built
theirs. Three hundred fifty freshmen will enter the University next fall
filled with no end of enthusiasm for just such things as bonfires. Don't
abolish it. them build their fire, or have the opportunity to refuse to
build if they want. Time, energy, and lumber can be saved by limiting its
construction to the week before its burning. Keep the bonfire!
