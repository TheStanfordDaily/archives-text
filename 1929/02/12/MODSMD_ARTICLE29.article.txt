# The 						Daily's Bold Face
## 
### 
Upheaval in the editorial ranks of the Daily last spring culminated in
the adoption of light-face type for use in smaller headlines. '1 he change
was a step toward making the Daily make-up entirely light face. How
ever, the move got no farther than the eighteen- and fourteen-point sizes
of type. No top-column light-face type was forthcoming. And so the
Daily was left much like the gentleman at a formal affair in blue jeans and
a full dress coat.
Argument could extend far into the night on the respective merits of
the light and the bold and accomplish nothing. The present change is made
to give consistency to the make-up.
