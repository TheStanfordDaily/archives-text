# S. C. GAME TICKETS ON SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Rooters' tickets for the Stanford-
Southern California basketball games to
be played on Friday and Saturday nights,
February 15 and 16, will go on sale to
morrow in the Old Union from 9 to 12
and from 1 to 5 o'clock.
Any student may purchase one rooter's
ticket for each student body card pre
sented. The pricc will be 50 cents.
This will be the only time rooters'
tickets will be available at the student
rate. When the sale closes Wednesday
evening the remaining tickets will be put
on sale to the alumni at one dollar apiece.
Due to the limited number of scats
available in the pavilion, students will not
be able to purchase tickets for the game
after tomorrow. Queeners are to have
their innings, at last, since none of the
scats are reserved and no special sections
are provided for men or women.
