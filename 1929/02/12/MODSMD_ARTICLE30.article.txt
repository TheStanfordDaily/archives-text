The wealthiest nation in the world pauses a moment today to pay
homage to the man who rising from humble origin disdained the achieve

raised in luxury and instilled with materialism, cynicism, and the success
mania, we might well contemplate the life of this great man and learn
from it that the finest values of life transcend the dollar, materialistic
striving, and the futility of cynicism.
