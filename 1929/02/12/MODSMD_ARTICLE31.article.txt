# The 						Bullsession

### WHY DISCRIMINATE 
Six weeks ago Gordon Davis started ,
cast rehearsals for a new play, and
Harold Helvenston began to design
sets and direct their construction.
Publicity and ticket sales were set in
motion by the dramatic manager and !
his staff. Dozens of people spent thou- j
sands of hours in preparation for that j
play.
The results of the six weeks' work
were embodied in last Friday's per- j
formance of "What Every Woman
Knows," perhaps the finest dramatic j
production ever staged at Stanford.
It seems a shame that that is the j
end of the story. "What Every Woman j
Knows" was a finished production, j
worthy of being done professionally
with the same cast. We predict that
it would be a success professionally,
and that outside producers would be J
interested in it.
Why will authorities not permit i
campus casts to "take the road" or
to do stands in San Francisco? We
can't explain that, but we do know
several good reasons why they should j
permit it.
"What Every Woman Knows" is J
not by any means the first Stanford
play which has deserved a chance off
which did also, and the one exception j
to the stay-at-home rule, production j

■ campus. We have seen many others,
of "The Angel in the House" at the
New Stanford Theatre during the
' summer of 1927, was well received by
i a large audience.
The Dramatics Department deserves
' the money, for improvement facilities,
which professional runs of campus
; plays would bring.
Stanford University has had plenty
of publicity through athletics, but it
it is woefully short on publicity for
| its cultural attainments, which, again,
! outside appearances would bring.
Gordon Davis and Harold Helven
j ston, who work faithfully and skil
j fully to produce plays of high caliber,
deserve the recognition whicli they j
' would receive from such off-campus
J stands.
Stanford actors and actresses who
intend to follow this work would have :
i a much easier time breaking into the
professional field with the background |
j and notice provided by work before j
[ public audiences.
Harvard and Yale now and then
( produce plays in New York, and make
J a success of it. Many other Eastern !
and Mid-western colleges permit their i
j dramatic productions to forage in
j nearby cities. Why not Stanford?

"What Every Woman Knows" is J

to the stay-at-home rule, production j

■ campus. We have seen many others,
of "The Angel in the House" at the
New Stanford Theatre during the
' summer of 1927, was well received by
i a large audience.
The Dramatics Department deserves
' the money, for improvement facilities,
which professional runs of campus
; plays would bring.
Stanford University has had plenty
of publicity through athletics, but it
it is woefully short on publicity for
| its cultural attainments, which, again,
! outside appearances would bring.
Gordon Davis and Harold Helven
j ston, who work faithfully and skil
j fully to produce plays of high caliber,
deserve the recognition whicli they j
' would receive from such off-campus
J stands.
Stanford actors and actresses who
intend to follow this work would have :
i a much easier time breaking into the
professional field with the background |
j and notice provided by work before j
[ public audiences.
Harvard and Yale now and then
( produce plays in New York, and make
J a success of it. Many other Eastern !
and Mid-western colleges permit their i
j dramatic productions to forage in
j nearby cities. Why not Stanford?
—Winston Norman.
Six weeks ago Gordon Davis started ,
cast rehearsals for a new play, and
Harold Helvenston began to design
sets and direct their construction.
Publicity and ticket sales were set in
motion by the dramatic manager and !
his staff. Dozens of people spent thou- j
sands of hours in preparation for that j
play.
The results of the six weeks' work
were embodied in last Friday's per- j
formance of "What Every Woman
Knows," perhaps the finest dramatic j
production ever staged at Stanford.
It seems a shame that that is the j
end of the story. "What Every Woman j
Knows" was a finished production, j
worthy of being done professionally
with the same cast. We predict that
it would be a success professionally,
and that outside producers would be J
interested in it.
Why will authorities not permit i
campus casts to "take the road" or
to do stands in San Francisco? We
can't explain that, but we do know
several good reasons why they should j
permit it.
