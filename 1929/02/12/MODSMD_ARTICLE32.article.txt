# Campus Opinion
## FOR COURTESY'S SAKE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Speaking in behalf of the several
Roughs who had met with diseour- I
tesy at the Roble Jolly-up on Febru- !
ary second, I, the writer, sincerely
feel it my duty to accept the apolo- !
gies of those Roble women who felt
indignant about the incident, and, !
furthermore, I wish to state that, since
we have felt that the women them- i
selves were not responsible for the |
occurrence, we appreciate their atti
tude 011 the matter.
The purpose of our previous attack ,

! upon the situation was to enlist pub
{lie opinion as an aid to removing one
iof the outstanding obstacles in the
i way of better understanding between
Roble and the rest of the campus
Let us hope that the situation can be
speedily remedied by the process oi
! co-operation and loyalty to the prin
c-iples of courtesy and tact, and apply
i the old adage: "Courtesy is the best
paymaster on earth!" Let this stand
as a pledge of faith between the
Stanford Rough and Roble.
Sincerely, "A Rough."
