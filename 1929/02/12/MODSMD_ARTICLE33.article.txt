The Editor, Sir; 1
In view of the prolonged discussion
of the honor system: who is responsi- :
hie and who is not, may I cite a case, !
inviting and making comment later?
In a certain Economics course given j
last fall quarter the instructor was I
also a student working for his M.A. 1
His method of instruction was of a !
nature ridiculous even to apply to a
high school class. He would spend j
the greater part of the hour each
day, reading from the text, as if we
came for instruction in vo(;al expres
sion. The consensus of opinion in the j
class is that the numerous replies of
"I don't know," to questions asked !
by the students, are —well, draw your
own conclusions.
Not much comment was made ex- :
cept that the next quarter we would j
know who would conduct our classes
before we paid the $99.00 again.
All the foregoing is merely to give
one a better understanding of the ,
point to be made.
The final examination papers were
handed in, and I doubt if they were

.graded. The instructor passed out of
1 our minds until the grades were re-
I ceived, and it seems that they showed
j evidence of unfair discrimination. At
the instructor's first appearance on
the campus after vacation, members
| of the class requested the blue books. !'
:He answered that he had burned j'
[ them, and became quite indignant
! when it was remarked that such ac
tion left the class without means of
j seeing the justification of the grades i
1 given.
Other students can recall similar
j conditions in other classes in the Uni
versity, and it seems nothing but fair
[ that in adhering to the honor code, j
; the students should receive equal j
consideration from the faculty. I am
in favor of strict observance of the !
' honor code, but feel that it is a bit ;
j one-sided.
Inasmuch as the said instructor is ;
not a member of the faculty this |
quarter, but is registered as an Econ. i
, Clrad. I invite him to attempt to jus- j
tify, in this column, his actions of j
burning the final examination papers, j

nature ridiculous even to apply to a
high school class. He would spend j
the greater part of the hour each
day, reading from the text, as if we
came for instruction in vo(;al expres

class is that the numerous replies of
"I don't know," to questions asked !
by the students, are —well, draw your
own conclusions.
Not much comment was made ex- :
cept that the next quarter we would j
know who would conduct our classes
before we paid the $99.00 again.
All the foregoing is merely to give
one a better understanding of the ,
point to be made.
The final examination papers were
handed in, and I doubt if they were

.graded. The instructor passed out of
1 our minds until the grades were re-
I ceived, and it seems that they showed
j evidence of unfair discrimination. At
the instructor's first appearance on
the campus after vacation, members

:He answered that he had burned j'
[ them, and became quite indignant
! when it was remarked that such ac
tion left the class without means of
j seeing the justification of the grades i
1 given.
Other students can recall similar
j conditions in other classes in the Uni
versity, and it seems nothing but fair
[ that in adhering to the honor code, j
; the students should receive equal j
consideration from the faculty. I am
in favor of strict observance of the !
' honor code, but feel that it is a bit ;
j one-sided.
Inasmuch as the said instructor is ;
not a member of the faculty this |

tify, in this column, his actions of j
burning the final examination papers, j
