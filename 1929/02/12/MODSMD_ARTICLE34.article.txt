# SUGGESTIONS TO THE EDITOR
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I wish to make the following sug
gestions:
(1) That a news box for the Daily
be put at some convenient corner of
the Quad (perhaps, the Engineering) '
into which the students and faculty j
would be invited to drop such news
items as they care to do. I suggest ;
that collections from this box be made j
twice a day.
(2) That a review of the Sunday !
church service be given in Monday's ;
paper. This is a regular department
in most newspapers, and one which
I feel has been overlooked in the
Daily.
(3) That the Librarian install a re
ceptacle for the return of books dur
ing those hours when the Library is
closed. I have in mind especially the
inconvenience inflicted on some stu

dents who must wait for the doors to |
open at eight, and then rush to their '
eight o'clock class.
(4) That the Daily inaugurate a j
new department which shall, from
time to time, give short sketches of
the members of our faculty. These
could be made interesting as well as
serving to increase the student-body
respect and admiration.
(5) That steps be taken to beautify
Lagunita by such means as colored
lights, etc.
These suggestions may be printed
in Campus Opinion, over my signature,
if the Editor thinks them of sufficient
value. I would like, personally, to see
the suggestion in regard to the Li
brary realized. I send the new Editor
my best wishes for a successful vol
ume.
Respectfully yours,
Gerald O. Williams, "25.
