# DISQUALIFIED BY A TECHNICALITY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
BecauHe of a technicality in the by
laws of the A.S.S.U. Constitution, the
name of John Lauritzen will not ap
pear 011 the 1929 ballot this morning,
although the circumstances surround
ing this election make the application
of the ruling almost ridiculous.
Because of circumstances surround- 1
ing elections last year, rules wen
drawn up whereby anyone on the \
Election Committee who might be
nominated for any office must resign
eight days before the day of election
in order to be listed on the ballot.
John 'Lauritzen was nominated last
Thursday, February 7, for president !
of the senior class, just 5 days before
the day of election. It was thus im- j
possible for him to resign from the i
Election Committee and fulfill the re
quirements of the election by-laws.
Under the present ruling Lauritzen's

name cannot appear on the ballot, so
that to appear at all, his name must
be written on the '29 ballot in ink.
I hope that the Executive Commit
tee, or the Constitution Revision Com
mittee, will realize that the conditions
of this ruling are ridiculous when the
last day of nominations is only five
days from election clay, and I hope
that members of the class of '29 who
would like to see Lauritzen as presi
dent will write his name on the ballot
as I intend to do.
Sincerely, '29.
