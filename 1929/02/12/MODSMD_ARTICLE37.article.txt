Aimee Villard. By Charles Silvestre. '
(New York: The Macmillan Com
pany. 1928.)
"Aimee Villard was beautiful and
! did not know it: a stalwart girl grown j
j up in the open; tall, strong, graceful,,
j with well-shaped limbs; a perfectly!
proportioned body. Her eyes, under
1 their long lashes, were soft and grey,
like the weather, and set among regu- 1
lar features She dressed
neatly, without coquetry, and with an
innate modesty."
We read thus in the first chapter
of this book that its heroine is physi
j cully beautiful —and yet the story
makes this seem a rather irrelevant
fact! Extraordinarily enough, from
tins page to the end of the book there
is not a single reference to the girl's
appearance. So clearly does the pic- ;

Her characterization is a rather
j perfect thing—achieved by the sim

j life of the Villard family on their
; farm. There is no subtle analysis, or
deep introspection. Aimee Villard is
' like a crystal, reflecting from the in
; side her own sweet, fine nature and
lon the outside somehow drawing
forth tjie best that is in every one
I whose life touches hers.

"Aimee Villard was beautiful and

j up in the open; tall, strong, graceful,,
j with well-shaped limbs; a perfectly!
proportioned body. Her eyes, under

like the weather, and set among regu- 1
lar features She dressed
neatly, without coquetry, and with an
innate modesty."
We read thus in the first chapter
of this book that its heroine is physi
j cully beautiful —and yet the story
makes this seem a rather irrelevant
fact! Extraordinarily enough, from

is not a single reference to the girl's
