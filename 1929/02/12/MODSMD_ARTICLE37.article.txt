Falsehood in War Time. By Arthur through the revelation of her charac
Ponsonby. (New York: E. P. Dut- Iter, however, that there is no need fo

j the other. You "feel" her rather than
! set her, and it is enough.
Her characterization is a rather
j perfect thing—achieved by the sim
ple narration of daily incidents in the
j life of the Villard family on their
; farm. There is no subtle analysis, or
deep introspection. Aimee Villard is
' like a crystal, reflecting from the in
; side her own sweet, fine nature and
lon the outside somehow drawing
forth tjie best that is in every one
I whose life touches hers.
Rather illogically, I think, the book
reminded me of Willa Cather's "My
Antonia." There is a small similarity
in general tone or style, Willa Cath
j er's book is far deeper and more mov-
I ing. Aimee Villard has a simplicity
! and a slowness that brings to mind
a grammar school primer, more than
j anything else. There are no high
! points in it and no thrills. It is as
| obvious as a looking-glass. Yet it is
| also as true. Like Miss Cather's
' novel, its sincerity, and the rare
beauty of the character of its heroine,
relieve its greyness of action and
style, while as a picture of French
peacant life, it has unmistakable ap
peal. —M. L. R.

Now that the great American Eagle
has swept triumphantly through Con
gress with the Cruiser Bill clutched
in his visious talons, and new war
; rumblings are heard here and there,
we can most appropriately consider
j "Falsehood in War Time."
The book shows what rank foola !
we are in time of war. It shows how
we sincerely believe the nastiest of
lies, and leaves you wondering if
we will again .be the same naive
goops when the next barbarous liola- '
cuußt embroils us.
That factory where the Germans
boiled down human corpses, using the 1
| products to make soap; the Canadian !
crucified against a Belgian barn door; \
j the English baby with its hands cut !
off; the Kaiser's reference to the
j "contemptible" little British army; I
the faked photographs; the inysteri- !
j cus Russian reserves passing through !
j Britain in August 1914—these and a '
| host of other war-time legends are !
dealt with by Arthur Ponsonby, one
time Under Secretary for Foreign Af
! fairs in London.
He digs them up, and quotes the
gentlemen who circulated the malig
nant stories, and then elaborately
proves their falsity. It is an almost
incredible tale, yet there is a still
more incredible tale which Mr. Pon
-1 sonby omits.
t We have, by this time, become i
! cynically familiar with the fact that ;
government officials lie, deliberately :
; and cold-bloodedly, in war-time and j
possibly even in peace-time, and the !
j generation grown up since the War 1
is bored with new proof that even '
tlie Allied rulers in 1914 were not as
white as doves. But why did anybody '
ever believe them? Will everybody)
believe them again, despite all that \
Mr. Ponsonby proves beyond doubt?

Aimee Villard. By Charles Silvestre. '
(New York: The Macmillan Com
pany. 1928.)
"Aimee Villard was beautiful and
! did not know it: a stalwart girl grown j
j up in the open; tall, strong, graceful,,
j with well-shaped limbs; a perfectly!
proportioned body. Her eyes, under
1 their long lashes, were soft and grey,
like the weather, and set among regu- 1
lar features She dressed
neatly, without coquetry, and with an
innate modesty."
We read thus in the first chapter
of this book that its heroine is physi
j cully beautiful —and yet the story
makes this seem a rather irrelevant
fact! Extraordinarily enough, from
tins page to the end of the book there
is not a single reference to the girl's
appearance. So clearly does the pic- ;
ture of Aimee grow on the reader |
