Much gasping and glubbering lias |
| been heard around the campus since :
I the memorable battle, with California !
!on the home court last Saturday
' night, and many of the don't-be sur-
I prised ones have turned I-told-you-so j
I boys.
After the extraordinary reception
I which the Cards gave the Hears, j
j everyone should feel more or less !
satisfied that Stanford hasn't such a!
: bad basketball team after all. It must
i he remembered that the Callfornians i
have a great team, as their record for
I the season will plainly show. But the
j wise ones, as usual, have taken it j
; upon themselves to place the blame !
; for Stanford's defeat.
Various people have been cred
ited with the Cards' two-point
loss, but about the most unrea- !
sonable and illogical accusation
is that Mike Reynold's failure to
toss in two free throws allowed
him, a moment before the game
ended, was responsible for the re- 1
suit. He cannot be held account
able any more than the men who
made the other eight attempts at
free throws during the course of |
the game, and missed.
Reynolds was under a severe nerv-1

ous strain. He had Just entered the
same In place of Captain Rothert, and
was still cold. And then to walk into
a situation where his success or fail
ure would decide the game—Well -
that was just a little too much.
The incident reminds us of the Big
Series in 1926 when Kred Price was
captain and forward on the varsity
team. After passing through a medi
ocre season, the Cards met the Bears
in the Pavilion in the first game of
the series on January 30. Despite the
dreary rainy night the place was
packed.
It was a see-saw contest from
start to finish. During the second
half California began a spurt
which finally netted them a six
point lead. The Cards trailed con
sistently during the second period
until about five minutes before
the end of the game. Then a last
minute offense made the score
Stanford 17, California 18. With
about a half minute to play the
Redshirts began shooting from all
sides of the court in an attempt
to sink a basket and sew up the
game. They failed in this, but just
as the gong rang for the end of
the game, a California man fouled
Price, giving him a free throw
and a chance to tie the game,
thereby making an extra period
affair of it.
After a minute's rest the Card
captain walked to the foul line
and prepared to make the throw.
Three thousand pairs of eyes were
watching him. Cool as he usually
was on the court, Price was evi
dently nervous, as he stood poised
there with the ball raised in front
of him ready to make the shot.
Not a sound was heard from the
three thousand as the ball sailed
toward the basket. It hit the edge
of the hoop, rolled along toward
the backboard, and finally dropped
off to the side.
The Card captain was quite broken
up about it, but he could not be
blamed for the loss of the game any
more than other members of the team
who had failed to convert free throws
during the course of the contest.

packed.
It was a see-saw contest from
start to finish. During the second
half California began a spurt
which finally netted them a six
point lead. The Cards trailed con
sistently during the second period
until about five minutes before
the end of the game. Then a last
minute offense made the score
Stanford 17, California 18. With
about a half minute to play the
Redshirts began shooting from all
sides of the court in an attempt
to sink a basket and sew up the
game. They failed in this, but just
as the gong rang for the end of
the game, a California man fouled
Price, giving him a free throw
and a chance to tie the game,
thereby making an extra period
affair of it.
After a minute's rest the Card
captain walked to the foul line
and prepared to make the throw.
Three thousand pairs of eyes were
watching him. Cool as he usually
was on the court, Price was evi
dently nervous, as he stood poised
there with the ball raised in front
of him ready to make the shot.
Not a sound was heard from the
three thousand as the ball sailed
toward the basket. It hit the edge
of the hoop, rolled along toward
the backboard, and finally dropped
off to the side.
The Card captain was quite broken
up about it, but he could not be
blamed for the loss of the game any
more than other members of the team
who had failed to convert free throws
during the course of the contest.

I the memorable battle, with California !
!on the home court last Saturday
' night, and many of the don't-be sur-
I prised ones have turned I-told-you-so j
I boys.
After the extraordinary reception
I which the Cards gave the Hears, j
j everyone should feel more or less !
satisfied that Stanford hasn't such a!
: bad basketball team after all. It must
i he remembered that the Callfornians i
have a great team, as their record for
I the season will plainly show. But the
j wise ones, as usual, have taken it j
; upon themselves to place the blame !
; for Stanford's defeat.
Various people have been cred
ited with the Cards' two-point
loss, but about the most unrea- !
sonable and illogical accusation
is that Mike Reynold's failure to
toss in two free throws allowed
him, a moment before the game
ended, was responsible for the re- 1
suit. He cannot be held account
able any more than the men who
made the other eight attempts at
free throws during the course of |
the game, and missed.
Reynolds was under a severe nerv-1

ous strain. He had Just entered the
same In place of Captain Rothert, and
was still cold. And then to walk into
a situation where his success or fail
ure would decide the game—Well -
that was just a little too much.
The incident reminds us of the Big
Series in 1926 when Kred Price was
captain and forward on the varsity
team. After passing through a medi
ocre season, the Cards met the Bears
in the Pavilion in the first game of
the series on January 30. Despite the
