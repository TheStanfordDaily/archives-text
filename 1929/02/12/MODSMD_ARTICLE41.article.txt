# ENGLISH CLUB PLANS PRODUCTION OF IBSEN DRAMA, 'WILD DUCK'
## Davis Says Play Includes Strong Interweaving of Humor, Tragedy 
### 
Contrary to general opinion, the "Wild
Duck," to fx- presented on the campus
March 1 under the auspices of the Eng
lish Club, is one of Henrik Ibsen's finest
plays, although it is more rarely pro
duced than "Ghosts" or the "Doll's
House." Symbolism is prominent in this
drama of an idealist who desires to right
the world's wrongs by showing people the
truth.
"Although the play calls for strong,
emotional, and tragic acting," Gordon
Davis, director of dramatics, said, "there
also are many opportunities for good un
conscious comedy, which art often over
looked when the drama is produced.
When we present the "Wild Duck," it
will not be played in a somber, com
pletely tragic manner, but there will be
a strong interweaving of the humorous
and the tragic."
"Wild Duck" will offer as many op
portunities for uniqueness in costumes
and furnishings as "What Every Woman
Knows" did, for the period of the Ibsen
drama is laid in the end of the nineteenth
century.
