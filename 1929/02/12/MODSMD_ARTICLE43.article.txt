# HAIR TONIC, INK COME TO AID HAIR RAISERS
## 
### HERR BRUSH 
With the finish only one day off,
contestants in the mammoth Whisker
Marahton have doubled the applica
tions of hair tonic and have bought
out all the ink in the bookstore to
darken their hirsute decorations and
fool the judges tomorrow. Excitement
is running high, and it is rumored
that clandestine betting in the bushes
near the boathouse is rampant.
The Old Boy has helped the staff
to compile a Better's Guide which ap
pears below. He, himself, is the proud
possessor of a long gray beard and
knows all of the growths and short
comings of the game. "Never, since I
was a janitor over in Sequoia," he
says, "have I seen such a tine bunch
of roughs."
DeLucchi looks like a first place
man but Durbin, Holtz, and Nunes are
coming right along. Out of the origi
nal nineteen entrants, only ten re
main. Ed Yeazell looked like a cinch
for first place, but he cleared off the
shrubbery to see a boat off to Europe.
Others who have succumber to the
call of decency are Ament, Dennis,
French, Gay, Giberson, Lercari, Rowe,
and Thornton. Dances and other vani
ties were the causes of their with
drawal.
