# ROBLE REJECTS MOVE TO SMOKE IN LOBBY
## 
### 
The motion to permit men and wo-j
men to smoke freely in the Roble
lobby was voted down at Roble Club ;
| House meeting last night. That the
administration would object to mis- i
I cellaneous smoking in the public j
| rooms of the hall because girls who
disliked cigarettes could not then
| avoid having smoky private rooms
I was the outstanding reason for the
rejection of this motion.
A second motion, reconsidered from j
: last week's meeting, to permit smok-;
[ ing by both men and women at dances
was upheld by a decisive vote. The
1 entire question was closed with the
1 passage of a motion allowing smok-
I ing in the corridors.
