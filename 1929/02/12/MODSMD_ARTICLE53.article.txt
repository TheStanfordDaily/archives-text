# SPORTS OF 1929
## Tree-Cutters Both 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
"Pretty" Paulino, otherwise known
as "Umsidum" and "Upsidedown," has
I been given the match with K. O.
! Cliristner, conqueror of Knute Han
sen, and the man who gave Sharkey
| the battle of his life recently in Madi
| son Square Garden, New York. Match
j maker McArdle of the Garden must
have had his tongue in his cheek
when he signed the Basque tree-chop
per to fight on the birthday of a
famous warrior who is supposed to
have K.O'd a cherry tree with his
little hatchet when he was a kid.
Well, it's a cinch Paulino Uzcudun
won't lie about it, if he cuts down

| K. O. Christner, that bis spare tire
of Akron, Ohio. He'll tell the truth
; and admit he did it. They do soy that
' Tom Heeney was offered the Christ
ner match first, but wanted too much
dough, so the "Beezark ol' the Basque,"
who has beaten Heeney, stepped in
and grabbed it. The winner, it is
rumored, will meet terrible Tom, or
what is left of him from the Tunney
massacre, while the victor of that
, fracas will take on Max Schmeling,
the Hamburg Hammerer. Then the
winner of that one meets the winner
i of the Miami monkey-business, if any.
Then, I suppose, Dempsey is the re
ward for the ultimate victor of all
this elimination.
Good old Paulino may be a little
1 shy on science and boxing skill, but
| he's always in there trying, is as
i tough as an ox, and is a good show
! man, to boot. I'd like to see him in
I there with Dempsey, at that.
