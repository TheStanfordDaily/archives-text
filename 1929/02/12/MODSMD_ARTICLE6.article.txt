# 'ERLKONIG' RECEIVES MOST APPLAUSE OF MATZENAUER SONGS
## Concert Program Includes Selections in German, French, Italian 
### ADELE SMITH 
"Erlkonig," by Schubert, received
the most enthusiastic applause of the
selections sung by Margaret Matzen
auer last night in the third of the
A.S.S.U. concert series. Her program,
which included songs in French, Ger
man, Italian, and English, admirably
displayed her command of language.
Mme. Matzenauer sang in a strictly
conventional manner, using the typi
cal gestures and manner of the tradi
tional prima donna. Though her pres
ence was not impressive, her voice
was remarkably powerful and clear,
and had a full upper register.
Her program was well selected to
display the versatility of her tones.
It included such well-known selections
as "Lusinghe pui care" by Haendel,
Brahms' "Sappische," Rachmaninoff's
"In the Silent Night," and Resplghi's
"In alto mare." Edward Hart, Mme.
Matzenauer's accompanist, played two
numbers by Debussy.
The San Francisco Symphony Orch
estra, conducted by Alfred Hertz, will
be the last of the A.S.S.U. concerts
to be given this year on April 10.
