# EVANSTON SWIMMERS TO ARRIVE THURSDAY FOR CARDINAL MEET
## Visitors' Captain Is National Fancy Diving Champion; On Olympic Team 
### REID BRIGGS 
Stanford's outstanding "big game"
of the water sports season is immi
nent. Northwestern University, who
: for years has been turning out cham
pions, is sending her swimmers to
meet the Stanford mermen here at
2:30 o'clock Thursday afternoon.
During sixteen years of inter
collegiate competition, the Purple
swimming teams have won 67 out of
80 dual meets. Just before leaving
i their home pool at Evanston, Illinois,
| the Northwestern team broke several
national relay records. Now they are
j eager to avenge the Cardinal water
; polo victory in the national champion
ship meet last year.
Colbath Is Diving Champion
The brilliant group of swimmers
who will invade the Pacific Coast are
headed by Captain Wally Colbath, na
tional fancy diving champion. Colbath
was a member of the Olympic team
which won the world's championship
at Amsterdam last summer. Another
intercollegiate record-holder on the
Purple team is Dick Hinch, champion
in the 150-yard backstroke. His time
1 in that event is 1:41. A1 Schwartz
holds the national intercollegiate rec
ord in the 100-yard crawl, and will
1 compete in that event here. A former
national high school champion in the
brcaststroke, Eddie Lennox, is ex
pected to make a good showing in
! the coming contest.
Three speedy free-style swimmers
[ are Don Petersen, Mark Wicks, and
; Bill Covode. The former is also a
capable breaststroke swimmer and
will probably be used in that event
| Thursday.
i Against this powerful aggregation,
! Stanford will enter an imposing list
of stars, headed by Ogden Driggs, who
in the California meet last year made
two new records, in the 220-yard free
style and in the 100-yard backstroke.
The times chalked up were 2:26:4
and 1:08, respectively. In the last na
tional intercollegiate meet he placed
third in the 440-yard free-style.
Card Leader Good in Sprints
Captain Reggy Harrison is a swim
mer of national reputation in the
j sprints, and has won many places in
i the N.A.A.U. meets. He was third in
| the 100-yard free-style in the last na
! tional intercollegiate competition, and
; was a member of the victorious Ameri-
I can Olympic swimming team in 1028.
Hal Bramel was on the relay team
which last year took second in the
national intercollegiate races.
Supplementing these star perform
ers, Ed Throndson, veteran diver of
; the first rank, is being counted on to

j bring points in the meet. Milt Burns, |
| one of last year's freshmen, who'
! placed fourth in the N.A.A.U. breast
stroke race, will be helped in that
| event by Bill Cundall, another fast
j and dependable swimmer. With him
will swim Barret Brown, who has also
improved greatly since practice began
: this quarter.
Dave Morey and Dick Lucy are
! other probable entries in the sprints. I
Herb Marsh, who broke his nose sev-'
eral weeks ago, may be sufficiently
recoverd to help Ed Throndson in
I the diving part of the meet.
More than 50 colleges and univer- j
| sities questioned by the student coun
i cil of Oregon State College, replied i
unanimously in favor of the honor
system rather than the proctor sys
