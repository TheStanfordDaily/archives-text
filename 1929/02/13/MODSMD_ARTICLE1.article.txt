# DAWES PLAN IS CAUSE OF ROW AT PARIS MEET
## Germany Provokes Questions As She Pushes Protest on Present Plan of Payment United States Is Expected to Oppose Any Alteration in Work of Colonel Dawes 
### 
PARIS, Feb. 12. </P)—The chief
bone of contention in the reparation
question, whether the Dawes plan re
quires completion or revision and
how, was reached in today's session
of the "Young committee."
Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, president of
the German Reichsbank, who had the
floor all day presenting his version of
Germany's economic strength, pro
voked questions from the other dele
gates as to the rate of taxation in
Germany compared with other coun
tries and as to the wages, while it
prompted the remark by Owen D.
Young, chairman of the committee,
that the working of the Dawes plan
seemed to show up so satisfactorily
that the question might be posed:
"Why is the new committee here?"
Germans Want Revision
The Reichsbank president retorted
that it must not be supposed from his
presentation of the situation that the
Dawes plan was all that could be de
sired and that he would produce evi
dence to show why it was not. This
evidence, which it is expected will be
produced at least in part tomorrow,
will doubtless furnish material for
our or two immediately succeeding
sessions.
Dr. Schacht, in a three-hour talk,
explained his view why Germany
could not continue paying the yearly
amounts that it has hitherto paid. In
the course of a ten-minute address
Young is reported as having answered
Dr. Schacht: "Thanks for the implied
appreciation of the Dawes plan pay
ments."
Young Defends Plan
The question thus raised was felt
to show that Young, although speak
:ug in the most diplomatic terms, ap
peared to defend the work of the first
Dawes committee on which he played
so prominent a part, and the manner
in which it has been carried out by
S Parker Gilbert, agent-general for
reparations.
The impression of several of the
delegations was that the United
States would oppose any radical
change in the letter and spirit of the
Dawes plan.
It is understood that when Dr.
Schacht resumes his exposition of
Germany's viewpoint, he will take oc
casion to reply to some of Young's
financial arguments.

PARIS, Feb. 12. </P)—The chief
bone of contention in the reparation
question, whether the Dawes plan re
quires completion or revision and
how, was reached in today's session
of the "Young committee."
Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, president of
the German Reichsbank, who had the
floor all day presenting his version of
Germany's economic strength, pro
voked questions from the other dele
gates as to the rate of taxation in
Germany compared with other coun
tries and as to the wages, while it
prompted the remark by Owen D.
Young, chairman of the committee,
that the working of the Dawes plan
seemed to show up so satisfactorily
that the question might be posed:
"Why is the new committee here?"
Germans Want Revision
The Reichsbank president retorted
that it must not be supposed from his
presentation of the situation that the
Dawes plan was all that could be de
sired and that he would produce evi
dence to show why it was not. This
evidence, which it is expected will be
produced at least in part tomorrow,
will doubtless furnish material for
our or two immediately succeeding
sessions.
Dr. Schacht, in a three-hour talk,
explained his view why Germany
could not continue paying the yearly
amounts that it has hitherto paid. In
the course of a ten-minute address
Young is reported as having answered
Dr. Schacht: "Thanks for the implied
appreciation of the Dawes plan pay
ments."
Young Defends Plan
The question thus raised was felt
to show that Young, although speak
:ug in the most diplomatic terms, ap
peared to defend the work of the first
Dawes committee on which he played
so prominent a part, and the manner
in which it has been carried out by
S Parker Gilbert, agent-general for
reparations.
The impression of several of the
delegations was that the United
States would oppose any radical
change in the letter and spirit of the
Dawes plan.
It is understood that when Dr.
Schacht resumes his exposition of
Germany's viewpoint, he will take oc
casion to reply to some of Young's
financial arguments.
