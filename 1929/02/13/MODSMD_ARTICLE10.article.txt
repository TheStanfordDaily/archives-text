# PONTIFF GIVES OPEN BLESSING TO THOUSANDS
## Conclusion of Church-State Pact, Seven Year's Papal Service Observed 
### 
ROME, Feb. 12. (£>)—'"Pius the Con
soler," was the name given today to
Tope Pius XI by a throng of more
than 100,000 persons who received
from the pontiff the first open bless
ing given from the balcony of St.
Peter's in seven years.
They had come to catch a glimpse
of their spiritual leader, while some
60,000 more crowded the famous basi
lica for the celebration of the pon
tiff's seven-year service as head of the
church, the conclusion of the Vati
can's pact with the government of
Italy and the fiftieth year of the
Pope's priesthood.
When the Pope, attended by Cardi
nals and Chamberlains, appeared on
the balcony of St. Peter's, the throng
first cried "Viva II Papa" or "Long
live the Pope." Then some members
of the crowd, inspired by the peace
pact with the government of King
Victor Emanuel, began shouting
"Viva II Papa Consolatore."
The great throng quickly took up
the appelation until a steady beat of
"consolatores" could be heard. The
new name spread about the streets
afterward and a few hours later Pius
XI was more or less generally known
in Rome as "Pius the Consoler."
The royal house of Italy was given
a full share of the demonstrations in
honor of the signing of the accord.
The square before the Quirinal Palace
was jammed this afternoon with per
sons who shouted their loyalty and
would not be satisfied until King Vic
tor Emmanuel had appeared on the
balcony with Queen Helen, Secretary
Turati of the Fascist party, and
Prince Boncompagni, Governor of
Rome. The monarch saluted the
crowd repeatedly.
Everywhere the papal flag, as well
as the Italian flag, was shown on pub
lic and private buildings. The emblem
of the Vatican was hoisted over the
Chigi Palace, which contains Musso
lini's office, this being the first time
that the papal flag has appeared on a
government building since the fall of
the temporal power in IS7O.

When the Pope, attended by Cardi
nals and Chamberlains, appeared on
the balcony of St. Peter's, the throng
first cried "Viva II Papa" or "Long
live the Pope." Then some members
of the crowd, inspired by the peace
pact with the government of King
Victor Emanuel, began shouting
"Viva II Papa Consolatore."
The great throng quickly took up
the appelation until a steady beat of
"consolatores" could be heard. The
new name spread about the streets
afterward and a few hours later Pius
XI was more or less generally known
in Rome as "Pius the Consoler."
The royal house of Italy was given
a full share of the demonstrations in
honor of the signing of the accord.
The square before the Quirinal Palace
was jammed this afternoon with per
sons who shouted their loyalty and
would not be satisfied until King Vic
tor Emmanuel had appeared on the
balcony with Queen Helen, Secretary
Turati of the Fascist party, and
Prince Boncompagni, Governor of
Rome. The monarch saluted the
crowd repeatedly.
Everywhere the papal flag, as well
as the Italian flag, was shown on pub
lic and private buildings. The emblem
of the Vatican was hoisted over the
Chigi Palace, which contains Musso
lini's office, this being the first time
that the papal flag has appeared on a
government building since the fall of
the temporal power in IS7O.
