# The 						Bonfire Is Saved
## 
### 
Seven to four the student body voted to retain the bonfire. It is well.
Now that the stringent move to abolish it is quieted for the nonce, at least,
let the modificationists have their say. It has been pointed out that the fire,
as it has been handled, has not been totally satisfactory. Too much time
has been spent 011 it, too much distraction from study has resulted from it,
and too much material lias been wasted in the building.
The suggestion has been made in this column that limitation of the
bonfire be accomplished by confining its construction to the week prior to
its burning. It is reasonable that this time limit will bring about a limitation
of energy and material expended in its construction.
Let the Ixmlire be a phase of Big Game rally in spirit and in fact, not
an ordeal. The spirit of the thing is not the building of a Gargantuan pyre
mile high. Size, superlativeness, the mania to outdo the preceding class in
piling boxes cause the great waste, so loudly decried by the alxilitionists.
The week before Big Game is one of keen excitement. With but one
week to build in, the whole Freshman Class would turn out and make the
building of it a regular rally.
Now that the tradition is saved, let steps lie taken toward conserving
those three essentials: time, energy, and material. Prevent its becoming a
Roman holiday, but keep the old fight and enthusiasm.
