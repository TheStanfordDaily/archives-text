# For Conservatism's Sake

"For conservatism's sake," wail two old-timers in today's Campus
Opinion, "for conservatism's sake, we decry your progress in the opposite
direction." Woe is me! The change to bold face make-up has caused these
old-timers to "thrust out their beagles" (see Webster: small dog or con
stable) and to "root around in a brand-new Edit. Board's business."
God is good. We have a fight. Ours was the first move. Then the
enemy countered and smote us resoundingly in the Campus Opinion, a
sensitive spot. And now we thrust back.
Messrs. Peck and Baker, do you really see this change as an effort to
imitate those "many tabloid and screaming sentinels of sin that beset the
modern American reader?" But then we should not deprive you of the
chance to say, now that you have left, "the Daily's going to the dogs."
Another question, would not a fair "perusal of all the newspapers in
this country, both metropolitan and country, not to say collegiate" disclose
a few, just a paltry few, which use bold face make-up and "merit the
name ?"
What of those twenty-five Scripps-lloward newspapers that have
hewed themselves a niche in the hall of journalistic fame these last few
years? Unfortunate that they should use bold face make-up, they are ac
cording to Messrs. Peck and Baker headed "in the opposite direction from
progress." Too bad.
Then there's the S.F. Chronicle, the L.A. Times, the St. Louis Post-
Dispatch, the Chicago Tribune, the Detroit News, the New York Herald
Tribune. But, ah me they cannot go toward progress, they use bold face
make-up.
We weep. The Editorial Board has broken faith with the forefathers
(the last two). The Daily has chosen its path, a bold, dark blackish path
leading in the "opposite direction from progress." W r c are using bold face
make-up. And now having made our bed, we must lie in it. Sad indeed.

cording to Messrs. Peck and Baker headed "in the opposite direction from
progress." Too bad.
Then there's the S.F. Chronicle, the L.A. Times, the St. Louis Post-
Dispatch, the Chicago Tribune, the Detroit News, the New York Herald
Tribune. But, ah me they cannot go toward progress, they use bold face
make-up.
We weep. The Editorial Board has broken faith with the forefathers
(the last two). The Daily has chosen its path, a bold, dark blackish path
leading in the "opposite direction from progress." W r c are using bold face
make-up. And now having made our bed, we must lie in it. Sad indeed.
