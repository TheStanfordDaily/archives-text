# The 						Automoton Boom Drum

### 
Gone arc the days of Boom Drum, dear old Boom Drum. What will a
track meet be without the sonorous, megaphoned voice of that tradition,
announcing that Bob King has broken a world record, or that Bud Spencer
breasted the tape to the tune of forty-seven flat, but like Boom Drum gone
are these record-taking track men of yesteryear.
Enter Automaton Boom Drum, the Public Address System. Track
meets this year will l>e broadcast to the bleacher-warmers in stentorian,
loudspeaker fashion. Each event will be announced and followed through
by the giant voice. The grandstand will know who's ahead in the sprints,
who's leading in the vaults, who's winning the discus; the field will be
covered by the new system.
This is progress and an excellent move toward making a track meet
intelligible to the mass of onlookers. Not only will it be a boon to them,
but it will keep tab on all events for the benefit of those who know what it's
all about. An excellent innovation, but alas a tear falls for old Boom Drum.

The freshman members of the Daily staff will meet in the editorial
