Drink a toast to the Synthetic Age.
Reigning supreme: Everything
pynthetic, from booze to blondes. Mr.
Volstead and fellow spinsters caused
the former evil; Anita Loos created
a demand for the latter.
The modern trend is to accept as
genuine only what is synthetic. And
therein lies the Economist's best il
lustration of the law of supply and
demand.
Well-meaning reformers, speaking
ex cathedra and e pluribus unum, de
clared null and void all beverages
more violent than buttermilk, thereby
creating a great demand for liquor.
The increasing demand resulted in the
creation of the world's newest and
most popular profession, that of the
esteemed social mixer, the Bootician
(name, courtesy of H. L. Mencken).
Joe the Bootician faces a critical
situation in decreased supply and in
creased demand for his commodity.
Rather than disappoint his clientel,
Joe resorts to the ingenuity of his
profession and concocts a synthetic
mixture which sells at a reduced
price, produces more eloquent results,
and resembles liquor only insofar as
color and viscosity are concerned.
Economic Theory: The more likely
is the liquor to come up the more
likely is the price to go down.
A female Columbus discovers Amer
ican gentry's preference of the fickle
sex. Again supply fails demand, but
what difference? Is there 110 substi
tute for blondes? (Here insert Milt
Gross' brief edwice to de curious.)
As a result, brunette debutantes, tight
rope walkers, telephone operators,
box lunch venders, co-eds (no espe
cial insinuations toward Mr. Norman's
"undemocratic 500"), actresses and

even moving-picture stars blossom
forth suddenly—and without \yarning
—with sparkling blonde tresses, as
crisp and beautiful as the new-mown
hay.
Another writer discovers that yel
low curls are inadequate as an attrac
tion unless the wearer possesses the
Essential Pronoun. There results a
demand which is satisfied with syn
thetio appeal, complete course by
mail, $2.98.
With similar encouragement, plain
old asparagus becomes fancy rhubarb,
plants yield wool, glass factories yield
diamonds, and cans yield milk. All's
well until there arises a demand for
substitutes of substitutes, which is
quite inevitable when one considers
that substitutes might fail to sub.
Henry Ford's secret inhibition is to
perfect a mechanical cow that will
produce fresh milk when needed;
which will observe the conventional
ity of refraining from waking neigh
bors at night by mooing; which will
have the courtesy to separate milk
from cream. Imagine the hurrying
commuter's embarrassment on Mon
day morning when his kitchen cow
refuses to register contentment.
Even demure little Calvin Coolidge,
capitol cowboy, patronizes the craze
for the synthetic. Each morning be
fore breakfast he dons one of his
many Western sombreros, mounts his
mechanical horse and mentally "goes
for a ride" about Washington while
his horse see-saws back and forth in
the parlor.
Add to this list of synthetics, false
teeth, canned music, artificial flavor
ing, portable complexions ad infinitum
and you will have just started.
Moral: Accept no substitutes for
substitutes. —Carroll O'Meara.

day morning when his kitchen cow
refuses to register contentment.
Even demure little Calvin Coolidge,
capitol cowboy, patronizes the craze
for the synthetic. Each morning be
fore breakfast he dons one of his
many Western sombreros, mounts his
mechanical horse and mentally "goes
for a ride" about Washington while
his horse see-saws back and forth in
the parlor.
Add to this list of synthetics, false
teeth, canned music, artificial flavor

and you will have just started.
Moral: Accept no substitutes for
substitutes. —Carroll O'Meara.
Drink a toast to the Synthetic Age.
Reigning supreme: Everything
pynthetic, from booze to blondes. Mr.
Volstead and fellow spinsters caused
the former evil; Anita Loos created
a demand for the latter.
The modern trend is to accept as
genuine only what is synthetic. And
therein lies the Economist's best il
lustration of the law of supply and
demand.
Well-meaning reformers, speaking
ex cathedra and e pluribus unum, de
clared null and void all beverages
more violent than buttermilk, thereby
creating a great demand for liquor.
The increasing demand resulted in the
creation of the world's newest and
most popular profession, that of the
esteemed social mixer, the Bootician
(name, courtesy of H. L. Mencken).
Joe the Bootician faces a critical
situation in decreased supply and in
creased demand for his commodity.
Rather than disappoint his clientel,
Joe resorts to the ingenuity of his
profession and concocts a synthetic
mixture which sells at a reduced
price, produces more eloquent results,
and resembles liquor only insofar as
color and viscosity are concerned.
Economic Theory: The more likely
is the liquor to come up the more
likely is the price to go down.
A female Columbus discovers Amer
ican gentry's preference of the fickle
sex. Again supply fails demand, but
what difference? Is there 110 substi
tute for blondes? (Here insert Milt
Gross' brief edwice to de curious.)
As a result, brunette debutantes, tight
rope walkers, telephone operators,
box lunch venders, co-eds (no espe
cial insinuations toward Mr. Norman's
"undemocratic 500"), actresses and

even moving-picture stars blossom
forth suddenly—and without \yarning
—with sparkling blonde tresses, as
crisp and beautiful as the new-mown
hay.
Another writer discovers that yel
low curls are inadequate as an attrac
tion unless the wearer possesses the
Essential Pronoun. There results a
demand which is satisfied with syn
thetio appeal, complete course by
mail, $2.98.
With similar encouragement, plain
old asparagus becomes fancy rhubarb,
plants yield wool, glass factories yield
diamonds, and cans yield milk. All's
well until there arises a demand for
substitutes of substitutes, which is
quite inevitable when one considers
that substitutes might fail to sub.
Henry Ford's secret inhibition is to
perfect a mechanical cow that will
produce fresh milk when needed;
which will observe the conventional
ity of refraining from waking neigh
bors at night by mooing; which will
have the courtesy to separate milk
from cream. Imagine the hurrying
commuter's embarrassment on Mon
day morning when his kitchen cow
refuses to register contentment.
