## THE 						FOREFATHERS FROWN 
### 
THE EDITORIAL BOARD,
Sirs and Madam:
Two old-timers hate to thrust out
their beagles and root around in a
brand-new Edit. Board's business, but
we too, like to see consistency in
makeup. Not only in makeup, but also
in policy and progress.
A perusal of all the newspapers in
this country, both metropolitan and
country, not to say collegiate, will
disclose that the ones which merit
the name have adopted what is known
as a light-face makeup. Perhaps this
is an effort to break away from, and
make a contrast to, the many tabloid
and screaming sentinels of sin that
beset the modern American reader. If
it is that, it is also an effort such as
Gretchen in the Kitchen makes after
the recalcitrant Ronald comes home
after school and tracks mud all over
her shiny, clean linoleum. Take a look
at this morning's Daily, and you can
hardly escape the fact that the seven
teen heads below the tops are in just
such relief as those very tracks which
Briggs has immortalized in his fa
mous "When A Feller Needs A
Friend."
Now to comment on this matter of
consistency. You say you have shifted
back to these black monstrosities in

I the great cause of consistency. All
J right. The second line of heads is
blacker by far than the very tops
: you hail as too black. Is this con
: sistent? Then take a look at your
masthead, which is finally a masthead
to be proud of, and compare it to the
18 Pt. Hlack. Then turn over to pages
! two and three, and compare the black
ness of the few heads you have on
I three with the necessary lightness of
two.
You bewail the fact that you haven't
j any light heads for the tops. Natur
' ally, when the policy was instituted
j this was quite impossible, but it was
j hoped that within a short time such
I type could be procured. We under-
I stand that James E. Frank, your busi
; ness manager, has been expecting to
i buy this very type. Did it ever occur
I to you to ask htm about this?
' Now, it is your own business, this
j change, but when you justify it on
j the basis of consistency, and the fact
I that you haven't lighter type for the
tops, you are way off. Your makeup
is less consistent now, and your
progress toward a modern conserva
tive journal (which the Daily rightly
and of necessity must be) is in the
opposite direction.

Now to comment on this matter of
consistency. You say you have shifted
back to these black monstrosities in

I the great cause of consistency. All
J right. The second line of heads is
blacker by far than the very tops
: you hail as too black. Is this con
: sistent? Then take a look at your
masthead, which is finally a masthead
to be proud of, and compare it to the
18 Pt. Hlack. Then turn over to pages
! two and three, and compare the black
ness of the few heads you have on
I three with the necessary lightness of
two.
You bewail the fact that you haven't
j any light heads for the tops. Natur
' ally, when the policy was instituted
j this was quite impossible, but it was
j hoped that within a short time such
I type could be procured. We under-
I stand that James E. Frank, your busi
; ness manager, has been expecting to
i buy this very type. Did it ever occur
I to you to ask htm about this?
' Now, it is your own business, this
j change, but when you justify it on
j the basis of consistency, and the fact
I that you haven't lighter type for the
tops, you are way off. Your makeup
is less consistent now, and your
progress toward a modern conserva
tive journal (which the Daily rightly
and of necessity must be) is in the
opposite direction.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD,
Sirs and Madam:
Two old-timers hate to thrust out
their beagles and root around in a
brand-new Edit. Board's business, but
we too, like to see consistency in
makeup. Not only in makeup, but also
in policy and progress.
A perusal of all the newspapers in
this country, both metropolitan and
country, not to say collegiate, will
disclose that the ones which merit
the name have adopted what is known
as a light-face makeup. Perhaps this
is an effort to break away from, and
make a contrast to, the many tabloid
and screaming sentinels of sin that
beset the modern American reader. If
it is that, it is also an effort such as
Gretchen in the Kitchen makes after
the recalcitrant Ronald comes home
after school and tracks mud all over
her shiny, clean linoleum. Take a look
at this morning's Daily, and you can
hardly escape the fact that the seven
teen heads below the tops are in just
such relief as those very tracks which
Briggs has immortalized in his fa
mous "When A Feller Needs A
Friend."
