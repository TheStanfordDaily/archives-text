Evangelized America. By Grover C.
Loud: Lincoln MacVeagh. (The
Dial Press.)
The story of evangelism in America
is no small part of the history of
religion in America. Out of revival
meetings have sprung such move
ments for moral regeneration as
Methodism and the Salvation Army.
Nurtured in the swirl of their fer
vency were the forerunners of Billy
Sunday and Mrs. McPherson, them
selves strange contrasts to the simple
gospellers who turned the attention of
frontiersmen from Indians to sawdust
trails.
Grover C. Loud's comprehensive
review of evangelism shows how
great has been the influence of evan
gelism upon American religion, and
how inconspicuously its emphasis be
came centered on political matters
under the guise of "moral issues."

Mr. Loud begins his lucid narrative
with a definition of "conversion" and
an annlysis of the psychology of the
revivalist and his methods. The re
vival lias come "when the 'Fire' has
descended and circled through the
'Camp' consuming guilt and fear and
slmme and hate, purifying and then
exalting as it Rproads from one human
consciousness to another till at last
the single mind of all is ablaze in
one intense sacrificial flame."

Jonathan Edwards was the first in
America to call the "Fire" and inflame
innumerable "Camps" with those emo
tional outpourings which he and his
followers believed to witness the preH

ence of the Holy Spirit. Aimee Mc-
Pherson is the modern exponent of
apocalyptic religion. To the stirring
oratory of old times, says Mr. Loud,
she has added the auxiliaries of high
pressure super-salesmanship, stage
craft, and publicity carefully arranged
to make the most dramatic appeal to
the hearts, minds, and (last but by
no means least) the purses of her
congregations.
Between Edwards and McPherson
ranks a phalanx of revivalists —As-
bury, Dow, McGee, and Moody to
name but four —whose influence con
tinues to rule a great segment of
religious America.
With commendable frankness, with
challenging insight and in the terms
of a vivid imagination Mr. Loud has
truly affected an "objective, journal
istic record" of this nation's moat
interesting phenomenon. His book Is
of definite historical value. Above all,
it reveals the forces which have
made "Evangelized America."

innumerable "Camps" with those emo
tional outpourings which he and his
followers believed to witness the preH

ence of the Holy Spirit. Aimee Mc-
Pherson is the modern exponent of
apocalyptic religion. To the stirring
oratory of old times, says Mr. Loud,
she has added the auxiliaries of high
pressure super-salesmanship, stage
craft, and publicity carefully arranged
to make the most dramatic appeal to
the hearts, minds, and (last but by
no means least) the purses of her
congregations.
Between Edwards and McPherson
ranks a phalanx of revivalists —As-
bury, Dow, McGee, and Moody to
name but four —whose influence con
tinues to rule a great segment of
religious America.
With commendable frankness, with
challenging insight and in the terms
of a vivid imagination Mr. Loud has
truly affected an "objective, journal
istic record" of this nation's moat
interesting phenomenon. His book Is
of definite historical value. Above all,
it reveals the forces which have
made "Evangelized America."
Evangelized America. By Grover C.
Loud: Lincoln MacVeagh. (The
Dial Press.)
The story of evangelism in America
is no small part of the history of
religion in America. Out of revival
meetings have sprung such move
ments for moral regeneration as
Methodism and the Salvation Army.
Nurtured in the swirl of their fer
vency were the forerunners of Billy
Sunday and Mrs. McPherson, them
selves strange contrasts to the simple
gospellers who turned the attention of
frontiersmen from Indians to sawdust
trails.
Grover C. Loud's comprehensive
review of evangelism shows how
great has been the influence of evan
gelism upon American religion, and
how inconspicuously its emphasis be
came centered on political matters
under the guise of "moral issues."

Mr. Loud begins his lucid narrative
with a definition of "conversion" and
an annlysis of the psychology of the
revivalist and his methods. The re
vival lias come "when the 'Fire' has
descended and circled through the
'Camp' consuming guilt and fear and
slmme and hate, purifying and then
exalting as it Rproads from one human
consciousness to another till at last
the single mind of all is ablaze in
one intense sacrificial flame."

Jonathan Edwards was the first in
America to call the "Fire" and inflame
innumerable "Camps" with those emo
tional outpourings which he and his
followers believed to witness the preH

ence of the Holy Spirit. Aimee Mc-
Pherson is the modern exponent of
