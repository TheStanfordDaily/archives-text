# The 						Guardsman. By Ferenc Molnar. The Geary Theatre.
## 
### 
The San Francisco Repertory Thea
tre came into existence Monday night
with the successful production of the
first of a season's series of notable
New York Theatre Guild plays. And
coincident with the creation of the
new Repertory Theatre, Lowell Sher
man returned to his home town a star,
after several years before the Kleig
light's of Hollywood.
If you're tired of depressing tragedy,

and are weary of broad and obvious ;
comedy we strongly recommend that
you go to the Geary for the quiet,
satire-tinged comedy that makes you
smile always, chuckle often, and guf
faw not once.
The play itself has very little ac
tion, it is chiefly a word-parrying con
cerning the domestic difficulties of a
famous Hungarian actor and his wife.
Lowell Sherman is, as Molnar in
tended, an actor acting—and doing it
admirably. His wife is a famous act
ress, and beautiful, who has had '
seven or nine loves and now shows
signs of tiring of her husband after
six months of wedded life.
To test his wife's fidelity, and to re
gain her love by an indirect procedure,
the actor disguises as a Russian ;
guardsman and violently woos his !
own wife. She reacts deliciously, but
in the end swears that she knew from
the start who the Guardsman was.
Molnar leaves that question up to
you, did she recognize her husband,
or did she cleverly get out of a diffi- \
cult situation by a sudden inspira- !
tion?
Doris Lloyd, as the wife of the j
actor, we remember from "Interfer- j
ence" and "The Marriage Bed." She
gave a colorful and interesting in
terpretation of the part. She, of the
red hair, was especially effective in
the second act where she appears
beautifully — but not profusely —
gowned in an enticing evening gown
of white.
We must thank Betty Middleton for
a humorous and true characterization
of lackadaisical adolescence in Liesl,
the maid. The way that she dusts the
living room is particularly remini
scent of little sisters.
The Repertory Theatre is planning
to produce, in addition to "The Guards
man," four successes of the New York
Theatre Guild, and also to bring the
New York cast intact to San Fran
cisco for four more of the Guild's
recent hits. —Clifford F. Weigle.

the actor disguises as a Russian ;
guardsman and violently woos his !
own wife. She reacts deliciously, but
in the end swears that she knew from
the start who the Guardsman was.
Molnar leaves that question up to
you, did she recognize her husband,
or did she cleverly get out of a diffi- \
cult situation by a sudden inspira- !
tion?
Doris Lloyd, as the wife of the j
actor, we remember from "Interfer- j
ence" and "The Marriage Bed." She
gave a colorful and interesting in
terpretation of the part. She, of the
red hair, was especially effective in
the second act where she appears
beautifully — but not profusely —
gowned in an enticing evening gown
of white.
We must thank Betty Middleton for
a humorous and true characterization
of lackadaisical adolescence in Liesl,
the maid. The way that she dusts the
living room is particularly remini
scent of little sisters.
The Repertory Theatre is planning
to produce, in addition to "The Guards
man," four successes of the New York
Theatre Guild, and also to bring the
New York cast intact to San Fran
cisco for four more of the Guild's
recent hits. —Clifford F. Weigle.
The San Francisco Repertory Thea
tre came into existence Monday night
with the successful production of the
first of a season's series of notable
New York Theatre Guild plays. And
coincident with the creation of the
new Repertory Theatre, Lowell Sher
man returned to his home town a star,
after several years before the Kleig
light's of Hollywood.
If you're tired of depressing tragedy,

and are weary of broad and obvious ;
comedy we strongly recommend that
you go to the Geary for the quiet,
satire-tinged comedy that makes you
smile always, chuckle often, and guf
faw not once.
The play itself has very little ac
tion, it is chiefly a word-parrying con
cerning the domestic difficulties of a
famous Hungarian actor and his wife.
Lowell Sherman is, as Molnar in
tended, an actor acting—and doing it
admirably. His wife is a famous act
ress, and beautiful, who has had '
seven or nine loves and now shows
signs of tiring of her husband after
six months of wedded life.
To test his wife's fidelity, and to re
gain her love by an indirect procedure,
the actor disguises as a Russian ;
guardsman and violently woos his !
own wife. She reacts deliciously, but
in the end swears that she knew from
the start who the Guardsman was.
