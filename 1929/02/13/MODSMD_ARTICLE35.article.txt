Although "East is East and West
is West," the twain will meet tomor
row afternoon when Northwestern
University's eight-man swimming
team clashes with Stanford's crack
aquatic squad in Encina pool.
The Northwestern swimmers
are making a barnstorming tour
of the Pacific Coast. Any East-
West contest attracts a great
deal of attention, particularly
since some of the Western foot
ball players showed the Eastern
ers that they could play the great
American game as well as chase
Indians. While swimming is not
a major sport, Northwestern has
a chance to regain some of the
swimming fame of the East's ath
letic prowess.
With winning track and football ,
teams, to say nothing of a world's i
championship crew, Western universi- i
ties have gained recognition of their '
more "cultured brothers" of the East
and Middlewest. It will be ample j
proof of the West's athletic superior-j
ity if the Stanford water polo and
swimming team can beat the best the
East has to offer in this sport.
The Purple polo team will be
out to settle a personal grudge
they hold against the Card polo
squad. The Cardinals defeated
the Northwesterners 12 to 9 last
year, thereby copping the nation
al championship. It was a dis
puted title, however, for the Pur
ples' claimed they had beaten the
Redshirts in a previous contest.
This was true insofar as North- !
western won 4 to 3, but the game
was an exhibition match played in the j
Evanston pool. The Card swimmers '

agreed to meet the Wildcats at th»
last minute "to accommodate the
crowd." The agreement further stated
that if Northwestern won, another
game would be played because the
Evanston pool was not of regulation
size. The width of the tank was only
twenty feet. Further, if the Cards won
they have a right to claim the cham
pionship without playing another
game. A smart enough bargain to do
credit to C. C. Pyle himself. The
Wildcats won and so the "champion
ship match" was played in the Illinois
Athletic Club tank where the Cards
won an exciting victory.
Tomorrow's water polo contest
will decide beyond doubt the real
champion. The majority of swim
mers on both sides, who were in
last year's meet, will line up
against each other in the Encina
Pool. This feature alone should
be well worth seeing, not to men
tion the swimming meet in which
a galaxy of stars will perform.
An additional attraction announced
yesterday—ladies are invited to at
tend. —Merle Einry.
