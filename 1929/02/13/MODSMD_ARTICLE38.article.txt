# STANFORD BASEBALL NINE HANDS OLYMPIC CLUB 11-2 TROUNCING
## Bill Simpkins Holds Club Batters; Varsity Makes Eleven Clean Hits 
### DON OSWILL 
Displaying unusual hitting ability,
and some fast fielding, the varsity
baseball team trounced the Olympic
Club by an 11 to 2 score yesterday
afternoon. At no time after the third
inning were the Cards in danger of
losing the ball game, as Bill Simpkins
had the Club batters hopelessly in
hand, while the Stanford sluggers
were pounding out the offerings of
Bud DeMeyer.
The Cards started the scoring in
the second with one out, when Hardy
was walked and singled to third by
Laird. Hardy scored on an infield hit
by Purkiss, but Laird was out at
tempting to make third on the play,
and Purkiss was caught stealing. Two
more runs scored in the third on two
singles and an error.
Cards Hit Nounnan
At the beginning of the eighth with
the varsity leading by six runs, Jack
Nounnan was sent in to pitch for the
Post Street organization. The former
Bear captain did not fare so well
against the Stanford batters. He
walked Purkiss, the first man to face
him, and Simpkins laid down a neat
bunt to advance the runner. Churchill
walked, then Hunken and Cook
rapped out a couple of safeties and
three runs scored.
The Olympic Club made their two
tallies in the second inning, but only
with the help of a couple of infield
errors. DeMeyer singled, and then the
Stanford keystone combination fum
bled up what should have been two
easy double plays. Coopman doubled ;
to left field and scored two men. Then,
the infield worked, and the side was
retired on a double play.
Complete Double Plays
Aside from the second inning, the j
Card infield functioned perfectly.
Cook and Johnson completed three !
double plays, and Laird and Cook a !
fourth. In the sixth, Dutch Thompson ,
hit safely. The next batter hit a liner j
over Laird's head, which Laird re- j
irieved by jumping high in the air j
and spearing the ball with one hand, j
He then doubled Thompson off first '
base. It was one of those plays that
you read about, but seldom see.

Displaying unusual hitting ability,
and some fast fielding, the varsity
baseball team trounced the Olympic
Club by an 11 to 2 score yesterday
afternoon. At no time after the third
inning were the Cards in danger of
losing the ball game, as Bill Simpkins
had the Club batters hopelessly in
hand, while the Stanford sluggers
were pounding out the offerings of
Bud DeMeyer.
The Cards started the scoring in
the second with one out, when Hardy
was walked and singled to third by
Laird. Hardy scored on an infield hit
by Purkiss, but Laird was out at
tempting to make third on the play,
and Purkiss was caught stealing. Two
more runs scored in the third on two
singles and an error.
Cards Hit Nounnan
At the beginning of the eighth with
the varsity leading by six runs, Jack
Nounnan was sent in to pitch for the
Post Street organization. The former
Bear captain did not fare so well
against the Stanford batters. He
walked Purkiss, the first man to face
him, and Simpkins laid down a neat
bunt to advance the runner. Churchill
walked, then Hunken and Cook
rapped out a couple of safeties and
three runs scored.
The Olympic Club made their two
tallies in the second inning, but only
with the help of a couple of infield
errors. DeMeyer singled, and then the
Stanford keystone combination fum
bled up what should have been two
easy double plays. Coopman doubled ;
to left field and scored two men. Then,

Displaying unusual hitting ability,
and some fast fielding, the varsity
baseball team trounced the Olympic
Club by an 11 to 2 score yesterday
afternoon. At no time after the third
inning were the Cards in danger of
losing the ball game, as Bill Simpkins
had the Club batters hopelessly in
hand, while the Stanford sluggers
were pounding out the offerings of
Bud DeMeyer.
The Cards started the scoring in
the second with one out, when Hardy
was walked and singled to third by
Laird. Hardy scored on an infield hit
by Purkiss, but Laird was out at
tempting to make third on the play,
and Purkiss was caught stealing. Two
more runs scored in the third on two
singles and an error.
Cards Hit Nounnan
At the beginning of the eighth with
the varsity leading by six runs, Jack
Nounnan was sent in to pitch for the
Post Street organization. The former
Bear captain did not fare so well
against the Stanford batters. He
walked Purkiss, the first man to face
him, and Simpkins laid down a neat
bunt to advance the runner. Churchill
walked, then Hunken and Cook
rapped out a couple of safeties and
three runs scored.
The Olympic Club made their two
tallies in the second inning, but only
with the help of a couple of infield
errors. DeMeyer singled, and then the
Stanford keystone combination fum
bled up what should have been two
easy double plays. Coopman doubled ;
to left field and scored two men. Then,
the infield worked, and the side was
retired on a double play.
Complete Double Plays
Aside from the second inning, the j
Card infield functioned perfectly.
Cook and Johnson completed three !
double plays, and Laird and Cook a !
fourth. In the sixth, Dutch Thompson ,
hit safely. The next batter hit a liner j
over Laird's head, which Laird re- j
irieved by jumping high in the air j
and spearing the ball with one hand, j
He then doubled Thompson off first '
base. It was one of those plays that
you read about, but seldom see.
