# TROJANS TURN NORTH PREDICTING WIN OVER CARDS IN FINAL TILT
## Cards Work on Free Throws To Supplement Airtight Defensive Plays 
### ANSON REEDER 
With two victories over the Uclans
Ito their credit, the University of
Southern California basketeers turn
j north this week-end looking for new
I fields of conquest. On Friday and Sat-
I urday nights they will meet the Stan
i ford quintet in the Pavilion in the
i last court contests of the year be
j tween these two institutions.
j The Trojan five started their sea
! son out in a bad way when they sue-
I cumbed to the Bears and Cards in
j three straight games. Pre-season pre
| dictions were that the Trojans would
! repeat their performance of last year
; and win the Southern Division of the
â–  Conference as only one regular was
; lost from the 1928 squad.
Then illness began to slow them up.
; Coach Callaiul says his men are back
to normal, and that they have lost
their last game this season. "They are
coming north to defeat the Cards in
i both games and thereby cinch second
i place in this division."
Jess Mortensen, center, is the big
1 noise of the visitors. He has been
j high-point man in nearly every game.
Those who have seen him in action
this season say that he's all-coast.
The Trojans, with the exception of
i Bruner at center, will start the same
line-up Friday as they used against
! the University of Washington last
year in the play-off for the Conference
championship. Frank Smith, who was
mainly responsible for the Northern
ers' defeat, will be at one forward,
with "Uncanny" Cano or Nibley at the
other. Lloyd Thomas, of grid fame,
and Lehners will handle the guard
duties.
Against California Saturday night,
the Cards showed that they had per
fetced an airtight defense. If they
can improve on their free throws and
smooth out their offense, they should
force Mr. Calland to alter his predic
tion of a late come-back.
The squad was practicing free
throws again last night and made
from fifteen to eighteen out of a pos-
I sible twenty as they did last week
J before the California game.
