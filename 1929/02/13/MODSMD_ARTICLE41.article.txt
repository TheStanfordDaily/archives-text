# WHISKER TOURNEY ENDS Beards To Be Judged Today WOOL STOCK GOES DOWN
## 
### HERR BRUSH 
Two weeks of anxious waiting and
extreme embarrassment will have its
reward today at 2:30 o'clock when;
ten be-whiskered, he-men stand face
J to face at Chappie's great judgment
seat in front of the Press Building.
The five judges who will hold sway J
in the reviewing stand are Jack
Trotzky Shoup, Florence Delilah
j Cooper, Mel Tolstoi Carter, Bob 80l- j
i shevik Paine, and A1 Bluebeard Es- !
! berg. To introduce a Shavian element'
in the contest, efforts were made to
obtain the services of George Ber
nard Shaw as a judge, but Mr. Shaw ,
unfortunately could not be obtained, j
The coffers of the Hammer and |
I Coffin Society are nearly exhausted
I by the outlay of "hush money" for
| the bushy anarchists. Ten dollars and
a shaving brush goes to the man with I
the thickest and most beautiful shrub
bery. Other prizes are: second, a gold
plated Schick razor; third, a five dol
! lar pair of golf hose from Phelps
Terkel; fourth, a carton of cigarettes
; from Moreys; and fifth, a box of
j "Miss Saylor's" chocolates from "Biff"
; Hoffman's. In addition all prize-win
i ners will receive a free shave at the
Block "S" Barber Shop.
Negotiations are under way with
the Peninsula Railway to run a spe-
I cial car from the Bookstore to the
judging stand at the end of the line. ,
; Those who have lost their student!
j body cards may see the finish of the i
; marathon from the roof of the Roble [
! Gym.
The Quad photographer will be on
hand to shoot the forest scenes from i
all angles and will even make micro- i
scopic studies of the individual
bushes.
