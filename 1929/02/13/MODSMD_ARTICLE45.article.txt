# SPORTS OF 1929
## Back to Washington 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Mr. H. Hoover arrives officially in
the White House on March 4th. Mr.
C. Myer arrives in its vicinity in
i April. Mr. Hoover will be first in war,
first in peace, etc., and Mr. Myer will
play third on a team which hopes to

been under way with the Santa Clara
managers for a meet on Thursday,
! have fallen through entirely.

I short for Washington that spring, but
! he was only 23 then. He has been
I starring at third for the Red Sox.
Charles Solomon Myer—paste that
; name in your hat for future reference
j as a coming young infield star.
