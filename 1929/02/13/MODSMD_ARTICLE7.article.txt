# Unified Control To Bring Peace In China-Baker
## Revival of National Feeling Being Actively Carried Out by Education 
### ADELE SMITH 
"The present condition of China has
that unity of direction which may
bring about permanent peace," said
John Earl Baker in his lecture on
"China Revisited" in the Assembly
Hall last night. "Frankly, I don't
know what chances of lasting peace
there really are. Remember that these
men who are in unified direction of
the government at present, were only
a few months ago in active rivalry.
They may once more desire to strike
out for themselves."
Baker went on to give a general
idea of the political situation in
China. Peace is the principal thing
which is desired by the Chinese.
Propagandists are working to instill
the people with a love of their coun
try and a desire to keep internal re
lations on a tranquil basis, so that
they will hate those who in any way
disturb the peace. Even if the present
state lasts only a couple of years, it
will set a precedent for the future
settlement of affairs.
Famine in China has been caused
by various misfortunes; drought, in
vasion of crops by locusts, and muti
lation of the land by continual war
fare. The Nationalist government has
just voted a $10,000,000 bond issue,
the proceeds to be devoted to famine
relief in the affected districts where
twelve million people are stricken as
a result of crop failures. Baker con
siders that an important step toward
aiding conditions is effective river
control and organization. At present
the continental water system is so
worn out that floods are more easily
formed and the irrigation system is
less efficacious against drought.
"If we can start in a small way the
idea of financing local improvements,"
concluded Baker, "we will bring to
the Chinese an instrument usable by
themselves for their own aid."
