## Budget Bureau Recommends Expending $35,000,000 For Current Use 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13. (/p)—Over
| looking his objection to its time re
i striction clause, President Coolidge
! today approved the Naval Construc
j rion Bill under which 15 cruisers and
I one aircraft carrier will be laid down
bnfore July 1, 1931.
The measure was signed shortly af
ter the President had conferred with
leaders of both parties in Congress
j on means of providing money for be
ginning the construction, and of pre
venting the enactment of other meas
ures calling for expenditures in the
present fiscal year.
The Budget Bureau has recom
mended that $35,000,000 to $40,000,000
be appropriated under the bill for use
;in the 1929-1930 fiscal year, with a
| small amount, as yet unspecified,
available for the current year. Chair
man Hale of the Senate Naval Com
mittee, who attended today's confer
ence, predicted that the appropriation
would be included in the annual Navy
Department Supply bill which is now
in conference.
Under the terms of the measure,
five cruisers of 10,000 tons each, the
maximum tonnage allowed by the
; Washington Treaty, must be laid
I down to each of the fiscal years of
J1929, 1930, and 1931, with work start
| ed on the aircraft carrier, a vessel of
; 13,800 tons, before the expiration of
\ that period.
President Coolidge was sternly op
' posed to this time provision and
: urged that it be eliminated by the
I Senate on the ground that it called
for expenditures in future years with
!no advance knowledge of what the
budget situation may be at those
! times. The Senate, however, disre
| garded the Chief Executive's recom
mendation and the bill was sent to
! him with the time clause intact.
In addition to Senator Hale, those
| who attended today's conference were
| Senators Curtis and Robinson, the Re
publican and Democratic leaders in
j the Senate, Representatives Tilson of
Connecitcut and Garert of Tennessee,
Speaker Longworth, and Chairman
Snell.
