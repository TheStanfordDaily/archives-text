Kappa Alpha piled up an early lead
to nose out El Toro in the only quar
ter-final game played yesterday in
the mural basketball tourney. The
hall quintet staged a desperate rally
in the closing minutes of play, hut fell
short by two points of tying the score.
Both teams missed a large number of
sucker shots, although the Iv.A.'s
played one of the best defensive
games seen on the campus this year.
Besides playing a great floor game
for the winners, Pease sank three
pretty buckets to be liigh-scorer of
the evening with 6 tallies. Krause,
flashy forward on the El Toro outfit.,
scored 5 points for the eating club
squad. Goldie and Hall both stood out
at guard for Kappa Alpha.
Sigma Chi qualified for the quarter
finals yesterday afternoon by down
ing Sequoia 1 in a fast, rough fracas.
The first part of the game was "nip
and tuck" and at half time the score
stood at. G all. Joujon-Roclie found his
eye in the third quarter and looped
in three baskets in rapid succession
to give the fraternity team a substan
tial lead. Elliot played a stellar game
at center for Sigma Chi, as did Kla
bau at running guard. Cook, at center,
was the outstanding player for the
losers.
By winning this encounter the Sig
ma Chi hoys captured the title of
League IV. They will tangle with Phi
Kappa Psi tomorrow afternoon at
5:10 in the gym to determine which
outfit will qualify for the semi-finals.
