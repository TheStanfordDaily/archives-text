tre Fund, are being formulated by the !
three campus dramatic societies — ;

Ihey decided to try to secure a date
early in March, after the presentation
of "The Wild Duck," if the Commit- j
tee on Public Exercises will permit.
Preliminary plans for the show in- '
dicate that it will be a miniature
"Gaities." Only members of these
three organizations will be eligible to J
appear in the vaudeville, which will
include many old favorites of former:
"Big Game Gaieties" and Junior i
Operas.

of five dollars each have been added i
!o the Theatre Fund, bringing the
total to $2,318.27. The donors prefer
to remain anonymous, but they ex
pressed hope that other individual i
contributions will be sent in.
