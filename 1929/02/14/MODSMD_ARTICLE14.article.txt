# CARDINAL HOOPSTERS WORK OUT OFFENSE AGAINST U.S.C. TEAM
## 
### 
General admission tickets to
the U.S.C. basketball games to
morrow and Saturday nights are
available today at the Board of
Athletic Control building during
the regular office hours. No more
rooters' tickets can be bought, ac
cording to Jake Irwin, in charge
of the tickets sales.
The Stanford basketball squad
spent most of the afternoon yesterday
working out an offense against the
Trojan quintet whom they are sched
uled to meet tomorrow and Saturday
nights in the Pavilion.
Coach Husky Hunt was still unde
cided as to his starting line-up for the
first game. At the present time he
seems to favor Hawkins at center
with Tyler and Pawcett at the two
forward positions. Tampcke and Cap
tain Rothert are almost sure to start
as guards.
According to word received from
the South, the Trojans are quite cocky
about the two contests this week-end.
They feel that they have at last hit
their stride and nothing can stop
them from winning the rest of their
games. Judging by the results of the
two tilts with the Uclans this does
not seem at all improbable.
The Southern California team will
start their regular line-up against the
Uedshirts with Nibley and Lehners
at the two guard positions. Prank
Smith, star of the two Bruin con
tests, will not start because of a re
cent illness, hut undoubtedly will see
action during the game.
