# CARDINAL, PURPLE AQUATIC STARS TO CLASH TODAY IN DUAL MEET
## Northwestern Champions Will Meet Stanford in Encina Pool At 2: 30 P.M.; Rival Teams to Renew Water Polo Feud; Visitors Given Edge in Swimming With Galaxy of Stars 
### REID BRIGGS 
IIHIEN Cardinal and Purple mix in Encina pool this afternoon at 2:30
; o'clock, Stanford swimming fans will see in action the flashiest mermen
|in the United States. Northwestern's team, headed by three national inter
| collegiate champions, A1 Schwartz, Wally Colbath, and Dick Hinch, arrives
. flushed with its Tuesday victory over the University of Oregon. In that
meet their SOO-yard medley relay team broke the world's record in 3:03.4.
I Four coast conference records were unofficially bettered by the Northwstern
| squad. While Northwestern has the edge on reputation and past performance,
i a strong Stanford team will give them the stillest competition they will meet

B>on their tour. Nip-and-tuck battles are
I promised in many events.
I Comparative dope in each event
i follows:
Four-man relay, 800 feet—North
| Avesterners Don Petersen, Bill Covode,
! Dick Hinch, and A1 Schwartz oppose
j Reggy Harrison, Barrett Brown, Og
| den Driggs, and Hal Bramel. Three ctf
| the Card men were on the team plac
| ing second in national intercollegiate
I competition last year. Brown, who
takes Van den Akker's place, is a
j good man. A pretty close event, with
considerable hope for Stanford.
Breast-stroke, 100 yards — Whitey
Burns and Bill Cundall will be opposed
|by Eddie Lennox and Don Petersen
: of Northwestern. Lennox has a nation
wide reputation in this event, but
Petersen was used instead of him in
the medley relay with Oregon this
i week, and made a very fast showing.
I Whitey Burns, on the Card team, took
j fourth place in N.A.A. meet in 1928.
; Northwestern may take this event,
but not without a hard struggle.
Crawl, 50 yards—Al Schwartz and
Bill Covode oppose Reggy Harrison
, and Dave Morey. This sprint is Har
rison's race. He has done some very
consistent swimming in A.A.U. meets,
but will face a champion sprinter. In
such a short race almost anything can
happen.
Free-style, 440 yards—Northwest
i ern will probably use Mark Wicks and
Omar Miller, who are about on a par
with Captain Driggs and Hadley
Bramel of Stanford. Captain Driggs
placed third in the N.I.C. race last
year, and seems to have a slight pre
ference. On the strength of Bramel's
time trials, he has a chance of win
ning.
Back-stroke, 100 yards—Dick Hinch,
N.I.C. champion, seconded by Omar
Miller, seems to have a clear edge
over Stanford, but Barret Brown, who
i was a sensation in the senior 220
championship P.A.A. races, shines in
competition. He is a very spectacular
swimmer, was second high-point win
ner in the interclass meet a week
ago, and may be expected to put up
a good fight.
Free-style, 100 yards—Nortliwest
ern's A1 Schwartz, rated the best in
tercollegiate sprint swimmer in 1928,
appears to have the edge on Reggy
Harrison, but Harrison is such a con
sistent man in A.A.U. races that he
might turn in a surprise. If Hadley
Bramel isn't too tired after the gruel
ling 440 he will make good time
against Bill Covode of the visiting
team.
Diving—ln the light of past per
formance, Wally Colbath, Purple cap
tain and national champion, has the
preference over Ed Throndson. Bill
Covode is the other probable North
western entry. He will face Herb
Marsh, who has missed a lot of train
ing on account of His broken nose. If
Marsh can succeed in getting back
into form, he should win from Covode
in this event.
Medley relay, 300 yards—lt looks
bad. The Purple swimmers established
a new world's record Tuesday in this
event, and are eager to demonstrate
their ability in the local tank.
Water Polo —Both teams of 1928 are
practically intact. The Card polo men
won the national championship last
year from Northwestern, 12-9. They
have a good chance of retaining the
title, in a game which promises to be
one of the most closely contested ever \
played in Encina pool.

i a strong Stanford team will give them the stillest competition they will meet

B>on their tour. Nip-and-tuck battles are
I promised in many events.
I Comparative dope in each event
i follows:
Four-man relay, 800 feet—North
| Avesterners Don Petersen, Bill Covode,
! Dick Hinch, and A1 Schwartz oppose
j Reggy Harrison, Barrett Brown, Og
| den Driggs, and Hal Bramel. Three ctf
| the Card men were on the team plac
| ing second in national intercollegiate
I competition last year. Brown, who
takes Van den Akker's place, is a
j good man. A pretty close event, with
considerable hope for Stanford.
Breast-stroke, 100 yards — Whitey
Burns and Bill Cundall will be opposed
|by Eddie Lennox and Don Petersen
: of Northwestern. Lennox has a nation
wide reputation in this event, but
Petersen was used instead of him in
the medley relay with Oregon this
i week, and made a very fast showing.
I Whitey Burns, on the Card team, took
j fourth place in N.A.A. meet in 1928.
; Northwestern may take this event,
but not without a hard struggle.
Crawl, 50 yards—Al Schwartz and
Bill Covode oppose Reggy Harrison
, and Dave Morey. This sprint is Har
rison's race. He has done some very
consistent swimming in A.A.U. meets,
but will face a champion sprinter. In
such a short race almost anything can
happen.
Free-style, 440 yards—Northwest
i ern will probably use Mark Wicks and
Omar Miller, who are about on a par
with Captain Driggs and Hadley
Bramel of Stanford. Captain Driggs
placed third in the N.I.C. race last
year, and seems to have a slight pre
ference. On the strength of Bramel's
time trials, he has a chance of win
ning.
Back-stroke, 100 yards—Dick Hinch,
N.I.C. champion, seconded by Omar
Miller, seems to have a clear edge
over Stanford, but Barret Brown, who
i was a sensation in the senior 220
championship P.A.A. races, shines in
competition. He is a very spectacular
swimmer, was second high-point win
ner in the interclass meet a week
ago, and may be expected to put up
a good fight.
Free-style, 100 yards—Nortliwest
ern's A1 Schwartz, rated the best in
tercollegiate sprint swimmer in 1928,
appears to have the edge on Reggy
Harrison, but Harrison is such a con
sistent man in A.A.U. races that he
might turn in a surprise. If Hadley
Bramel isn't too tired after the gruel
ling 440 he will make good time
against Bill Covode of the visiting
team.
Diving—ln the light of past per
formance, Wally Colbath, Purple cap
tain and national champion, has the
preference over Ed Throndson. Bill
Covode is the other probable North
western entry. He will face Herb
Marsh, who has missed a lot of train
ing on account of His broken nose. If
Marsh can succeed in getting back
into form, he should win from Covode
in this event.
Medley relay, 300 yards—lt looks
bad. The Purple swimmers established
a new world's record Tuesday in this
event, and are eager to demonstrate
their ability in the local tank.
Water Polo —Both teams of 1928 are
practically intact. The Card polo men
won the national championship last
year from Northwestern, 12-9. They
have a good chance of retaining the
title, in a game which promises to be
one of the most closely contested ever \
played in Encina pool.

takes Van den Akker's place, is a
j good man. A pretty close event, with
considerable hope for Stanford.
Breast-stroke, 100 yards — Whitey
Burns and Bill Cundall will be opposed
|by Eddie Lennox and Don Petersen
: of Northwestern. Lennox has a nation
wide reputation in this event, but
Petersen was used instead of him in
the medley relay with Oregon this
i week, and made a very fast showing.
I Whitey Burns, on the Card team, took
j fourth place in N.A.A. meet in 1928.
; Northwestern may take this event,
but not without a hard struggle.
Crawl, 50 yards—Al Schwartz and
Bill Covode oppose Reggy Harrison
, and Dave Morey. This sprint is Har
rison's race. He has done some very
consistent swimming in A.A.U. meets,
but will face a champion sprinter. In
such a short race almost anything can
happen.
Free-style, 440 yards—Northwest
i ern will probably use Mark Wicks and
Omar Miller, who are about on a par
with Captain Driggs and Hadley
Bramel of Stanford. Captain Driggs
placed third in the N.I.C. race last
year, and seems to have a slight pre
ference. On the strength of Bramel's
time trials, he has a chance of win
ning.
Back-stroke, 100 yards—Dick Hinch,
N.I.C. champion, seconded by Omar
Miller, seems to have a clear edge
over Stanford, but Barret Brown, who
i was a sensation in the senior 220
championship P.A.A. races, shines in
competition. He is a very spectacular
swimmer, was second high-point win
ner in the interclass meet a week
ago, and may be expected to put up
a good fight.
Free-style, 100 yards—Nortliwest
ern's A1 Schwartz, rated the best in
tercollegiate sprint swimmer in 1928,
appears to have the edge on Reggy
Harrison, but Harrison is such a con
sistent man in A.A.U. races that he
might turn in a surprise. If Hadley
Bramel isn't too tired after the gruel
ling 440 he will make good time
against Bill Covode of the visiting
team.
Diving—ln the light of past per
formance, Wally Colbath, Purple cap
tain and national champion, has the
preference over Ed Throndson. Bill
Covode is the other probable North
western entry. He will face Herb
Marsh, who has missed a lot of train
ing on account of His broken nose. If
Marsh can succeed in getting back
into form, he should win from Covode
in this event.
Medley relay, 300 yards—lt looks
bad. The Purple swimmers established
a new world's record Tuesday in this
event, and are eager to demonstrate
their ability in the local tank.
Water Polo —Both teams of 1928 are
practically intact. The Card polo men
won the national championship last
year from Northwestern, 12-9. They
have a good chance of retaining the
title, in a game which promises to be
one of the most closely contested ever \
played in Encina pool.
IIHIEN Cardinal and Purple mix in Encina pool this afternoon at 2:30
; o'clock, Stanford swimming fans will see in action the flashiest mermen
|in the United States. Northwestern's team, headed by three national inter
| collegiate champions, A1 Schwartz, Wally Colbath, and Dick Hinch, arrives
. flushed with its Tuesday victory over the University of Oregon. In that
meet their SOO-yard medley relay team broke the world's record in 3:03.4.
I Four coast conference records were unofficially bettered by the Northwstern
| squad. While Northwestern has the edge on reputation and past performance,
i a strong Stanford team will give them the stillest competition they will meet

B>on their tour. Nip-and-tuck battles are
I promised in many events.
I Comparative dope in each event
i follows:
Four-man relay, 800 feet—North
| Avesterners Don Petersen, Bill Covode,
! Dick Hinch, and A1 Schwartz oppose
j Reggy Harrison, Barrett Brown, Og
| den Driggs, and Hal Bramel. Three ctf
