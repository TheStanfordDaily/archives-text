						Vaudeville, The Gods Willing
## 
### 
Masquers, Sword and Sandals, Ram's Head, triumvirate of campus
dramatics, are out to do their bit toward the young and ambitious Theatre
Fund. Being Thespians, they have the new theatre movement close to
heart.
So it came to pass that these three groups put their heads together and
from the sanctum sanctorum of their powwow came a capital idea. Pro
duce a vaudeville, a vaudeville containing all the quips and sallies and
bright spots of real entertainment, a vaudeville to be presented at a nomi
nal price and worth twice the money, a vaudeville to pack the Assembly
Hall and swell the Theatre Fund's pocketbook.
It is a brave idea and one worth the support of the student body. The
value of a new theatre has been emphasized again and again but not too
often. Whole hearted support by the student body in the movement and
in every effort to further it will accomplish much toward its final success.
