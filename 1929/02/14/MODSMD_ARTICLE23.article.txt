# The 						Bull Session, A Priceless Possession
## 
### 
Of traditions that come and go there are a score, but there is one that
the college man should seize and pass on with unfailing zeal, it is the bull
session. Perhaps it isn't a tradition, perhaps it is an art. The Intercolle
guin dubs it so and in a word of advice to a hypothetical freshman defines
it admirably.
There is another art, close-linked to the art of making super
lative friendships. The fine art of the bull session. It is a demand
ing art, and like the actor's profession it cuts into one's evenings
dreadfully. But by all means become an adept therein. A bull
session, hotly contested, that leaves you scowling pensively into the
dark for long before you drop off to sleep may be bad for your
health ; but it builds mental sinew.
You have a sense of humor, Bob, that you must bring with you
to college. For sometimes you will swell overmuch with the vast
import of new ideas. And the sting of laughter is a first-rate rem
edy for too much of that.
These, then, seek you, Bob: the habit of eager searching after
the stuff to build your own philosophy; the mental bravery to de
fend your finished temple; the knack of making priceless friends;
the gift of talking with them when you find them; and a saving
sense of humor. And all of these to be found in four short but
glorious years!
Tradition or art, the bull session can be counted priceless among the
experiences co-incidental with a college education.
