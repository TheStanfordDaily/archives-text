# Lost Drawings
## 
### 
Things quietly disappear now and then on the campus. Perhaps they
are lost, mayhap they have strayed, and on occasion they are stolen. Of
recent occurrence is the disappearance of several original drawings made
for the play, "What Every Woman Knows." They cannot be replaced.
No pictures of the sets, worth the keeping, are left.
A drawing like a story or any of the things that talent creates is highly
prized by its owner and more so by the man who draws it. In the case
of these drawings there is this value that is involved as well as the histori
cal value the drawings hold for the dramatic department itself. Perhaps
in a week or so the pictures may return. Unless they do, the pictorial
record of the sets of the play is lost for good.
