## GRANDFATHER TO THE RESCUE 
### 
THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Sirs and Madam:
Now that former editors of the
Dally are thrusting out beagles and
rooting around In your business after
Ihe fashion of testy parents when
their children have come of age, allow
a figurative grandfather to remark
that the make-up of the Daily is no
body's business but the editorial
board's.
Headlines are merely a matter of
taste, custom, and public demand. It
would seem that you have a taste for
bold, bad, blatant headlines while
your immediate predecessors liko
them sober, steadfast, and demure.
Custom in that regard Is not estab
lished. And so far as public opinion
is concerned I venture the remark
that not one undergraduate in twenty
knows there has been any change.
Aside from serving the Stanford

public with news, the duty of the
editorial board is to itself. It is en
titled to learn by experiment what
, seems best in make-up and style. In
' that respect the Daily is as much of
a laboratory as any in the University.
Were you to conform to the judgment
of past editors, the Daily would still
be a dinky bulletin with headlines
after the fashion of a Cockney dodger.
Journalistic practice has its changes
and you, above all people, are entitled
to make them.
I take pleasure in commending your
rccently-condemned taste in headlines
and sincerely hope that you will be
able to go even further toward mak
. ing the front page of the Daily read
! able. â€”Tom Irwin, '23.
