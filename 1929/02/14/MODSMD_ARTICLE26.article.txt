# The 						Bullsession
## AN "X" OR A LAUNDRY MARK 
### 
Once upon a time somebody incor
porated into the A.S.S.U. by-laws a
complete and utter piece of stupidity
with regard to elections, and since
that time each succeeding Executive
Committee has been equipped with
too much inertia to eliminate those
rules.
In other words, ballots are still
being thrown out because they are
marked in pencil.
What the devil! Can't a group of
intelligent Stanford students see and
understand the significance of marks
made with so common an implement
as the pencil? And isn't a choice a
choice, regardless of whether it is in
dicated by an "X," a check, a circle,
n dash, a triangle, a Chinese laundry
mark, or any other sort of gadget or
arabesque? And, so long as the re
quired choice is indicated, what dif
ference does it make if the voter
chooses to embellish the ballot with
sketches of cows, rabbits, the Memor
ial Church, calculus problems, letters
to the folks for more money, or any
other sentiment, inspired or obscene?
To prevent someone from leaping
onto a high horse and galloping up to
point out that the rules in question
were made for the protection of Elec
tion Boards, since pencil marks can

be changed and sour grape addicts j
would thereby be enabled to hint at
corruption, we admit the fact. How
ever, if an Election Board, singly or
collectively, chose to cheat, it could
do so by:
J. Throwing away correctly marked ,
ballots;
2. Making desired marks on unused
ballots not approved of;
3. Purposely miscounting;
4. Drawing pictures on correct bal
lots to nullify them;
5. A lot of other ways we haven't
time to think of just now.
Any fear that the honesty of Elec
tion Boards will be questioned is need
less. Stanford students seem perfect- j
ly willing to entrust a group of fellow
students with the duty of counting
ballots, and so far as we know no
Election Board has ever been sus
pected of cheating.
There is plenty of campus disgust
each time the announcement appears I
that a block of ballots has been de-!
clared void because the pupils did J
not do their exercises quite right.
Maybe the present Executive Com- j
mittee will cover itself with glory by
depositing these by-law rules in a
convenient ashcan.
