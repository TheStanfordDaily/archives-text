College Life in the Old South. By E.
Merton Coulter. (New York: The
Macmillan Company. $3.)
"If any scholar shall assault, strike,
or wound the President, a Professor,
or a Tutor, or shall designedly break
their doors or windows, he shall be
expelled."
Regardless of the indictment of
modern youth as being carefree and
wild, we must admit that times have
changed from the old days when men
were men and students were ruffians.
This quotation is one from the Uni
versity of Georgia's bulky code of
rules and laws, commands, and prohi
bitions which covered sixteen pages
in a large ledger.
And after this sixteen pages on what
conduct should be, we read, rather
ironically, "Whereas the laws of the
College are few and general," in cases
not covered by the code the faculty
"shall proceed according to their best
discretion."
In "College Life in the Old South"
Mr. Coulter gives most entertaining
glimpses of many phases of life in
the University of Georgia from its
founding down to 1870. Faculty min
utes which he cites will give college
students of today useful ammunition
which may be hurled at elders who
deplore the iniquities of modern
youth.

Wcrlds Within Worlds. By Stella
Benson. (New York: Harper &
Brothers.)

"When I was young I traveled by
mistake, but now I do it on purpose"
—is the beginning of Stella Benson's
new book of observations on worlds
within worlds. Don't make the mis
take of thinking that this is a "travel
book." True, Miss Benson goes seven
leaguing all over the globe but you'll
find no museums or sights-of-interest
to-tourists in this sprightly, slightly
caustic group of essays and anecdotes
about the people and places and pre
judices she has encountered in her
intellectual forays into "The vast
open spaces."
"Worlds Within Worlds" is made up
of very much the same kind of
sketches as was the author's "The
Little World," with the difference that
Stella Benson has becomfe slightly
less geographically volatile since the
first book was written, and has been
observed to concentrate her observa
tions more firmly upon the Far East.
Her new book deals mostly with
two different aspects of China —the
furthest southwest and the furthest
northwest. It beckons the reader aside
occasionally into Japan, the United
States, and the British West Indies,
and some of the "asides" wander out
side geography altogether and ex
plore only people, against a more or
less ambiguous background.
By way of illustrations, there are
about a dozen pen and ink sketches
drawn by the author.

The Whirligig of Taste. By E. E.
Kellett. (Harcourt, Brace and
Company. New York, 1929. 51.25.)
Mr. Kellett considers that "literary
taste, like every other human faculty,
is the creature of the age, circum
scribed by its limitations, stirred by
its passions, warped by its defects."
He proceeds to illustrate his position
by successive examination of Primi
tive Criticism, Latin Criticism, the
the Classicists, the Ro
mantics, and the Victorians.
With a facile and fluent deftness
lie clearly limns the progress of man's
literary appreciation from the earliest
poetry, with its crude, blunt brevity,
to the nuances of taste expressed in
the last century. We begin to under

stand with a new sympathy the intro
duction of forms and styles by men
who, with an ever-growing realization
of literary values, rebelled against
traditional ideas and searched for bet
ter ways of expressing their thoughts
and emotions. The continuous moving
picture of literature assumes a new
; perspective and depth when it is
! viewed with frequent glances at con-
I temporary social and political ten
! dencies. When expression in litera
ture is considered as much a part of
life as expression in battle or in par
liament or in architecture, it does
not lack its true charming value,
j The closing words of the author
; soften the reader's reception of some
j of his earlier statements:
"We find today not one or two
critics but many . . . who, as if they
! were so many Olympian or Stygian
deities, deal out slices of immortality
to this writer, and doses of Lethe to
that, in sublime unconsciousness that
merit is not to be discerned by one
: man. The trump of Aeolus blows
'shrew6d fame' to those that may well
have deserved good, good to those
who have deserved bad, and often
none at all to those that have the best
right to expect a lasting renown."
So, after all, he returns to his start
i ing point, for he began by remarking
that:
L'homme eclaire suspend l'elogc et la
censure:
II sait que sur les arts, les esprits, et
les gouts,
Le jugement d'un seul n'est point la
loi de tous.

The Whirligig of Taste. By E. E.
Kellett. (Harcourt, Brace and
Company. New York, 1929. 51.25.)
Mr. Kellett considers that "literary
taste, like every other human faculty,
is the creature of the age, circum
scribed by its limitations, stirred by
its passions, warped by its defects."
He proceeds to illustrate his position
by successive examination of Primi
tive Criticism, Latin Criticism, the
the Classicists, the Ro
mantics, and the Victorians.
With a facile and fluent deftness
lie clearly limns the progress of man's
literary appreciation from the earliest
poetry, with its crude, blunt brevity,
to the nuances of taste expressed in
the last century. We begin to under

stand with a new sympathy the intro
duction of forms and styles by men
who, with an ever-growing realization
of literary values, rebelled against
traditional ideas and searched for bet
ter ways of expressing their thoughts
and emotions. The continuous moving
picture of literature assumes a new
; perspective and depth when it is
! viewed with frequent glances at con-
I temporary social and political ten
! dencies. When expression in litera
ture is considered as much a part of
life as expression in battle or in par
liament or in architecture, it does
not lack its true charming value,
j The closing words of the author
; soften the reader's reception of some
j of his earlier statements:
"We find today not one or two
critics but many . . . who, as if they

deities, deal out slices of immortality
to this writer, and doses of Lethe to
that, in sublime unconsciousness that
merit is not to be discerned by one
: man. The trump of Aeolus blows
'shrew6d fame' to those that may well
have deserved good, good to those
who have deserved bad, and often
none at all to those that have the best
right to expect a lasting renown."
So, after all, he returns to his start
i ing point, for he began by remarking
that:

"If any scholar shall assault, strike,

Regardless of the indictment of

changed from the old days when men
were men and students were ruffians.
This quotation is one from the Uni
versity of Georgia's bulky code of

Regardless of the indictment of

ironically, "Whereas the laws of the
College are few and general," in cases
not covered by the code the faculty
"shall proceed according to their best
discretion."
In "College Life in the Old South"
Mr. Coulter gives most entertaining
glimpses of many phases of life in
the University of Georgia from its
founding down to 1870. Faculty min
utes which he cites will give college
students of today useful ammunition
which may be hurled at elders who
deplore the iniquities of modern
youth.

Wcrlds Within Worlds. By Stella
Benson. (New York: Harper &
Brothers.)

"When I was young I traveled by
mistake, but now I do it on purpose"
—is the beginning of Stella Benson's
new book of observations on worlds
within worlds. Don't make the mis
take of thinking that this is a "travel
book." True, Miss Benson goes seven
leaguing all over the globe but you'll
find no museums or sights-of-interest
to-tourists in this sprightly, slightly
caustic group of essays and anecdotes
about the people and places and pre
judices she has encountered in her
intellectual forays into "The vast
open spaces."
"Worlds Within Worlds" is made up
of very much the same kind of
sketches as was the author's "The
Little World," with the difference that
Stella Benson has becomfe slightly
less geographically volatile since the
first book was written, and has been
observed to concentrate her observa
tions more firmly upon the Far East.
Her new book deals mostly with
two different aspects of China —the
furthest southwest and the furthest
northwest. It beckons the reader aside
occasionally into Japan, the United
States, and the British West Indies,
and some of the "asides" wander out
side geography altogether and ex
plore only people, against a more or
less ambiguous background.
By way of illustrations, there are
about a dozen pen and ink sketches
drawn by the author.

The Whirligig of Taste. By E. E.
Kellett. (Harcourt, Brace and
Company. New York, 1929. 51.25.)
Mr. Kellett considers that "literary
taste, like every other human faculty,
is the creature of the age, circum
scribed by its limitations, stirred by
its passions, warped by its defects."
He proceeds to illustrate his position
by successive examination of Primi
tive Criticism, Latin Criticism, the
the Classicists, the Ro
mantics, and the Victorians.
