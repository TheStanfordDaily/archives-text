### PHILIP SPACE 
The cause of this department's ab
sence for a couple of days is easily
exp' 5 *' ed. We were afflicted with a
seve. a case of nausea while reading
this very paper. A "feature" story
brought it all about —almost up, in
fact.
"Somewhere a little girl named Bar
bara is waiting for a letter," it be
gan, and ended —"Jean must learn to
address his letter more completely
after this, so that he won't disappoint
his little friend again."
Burp!
The thing must be read to get the
full effect.
Here is only one of the tender let
ters we have received since last Fri
day:
MR. PHILIP SPACE, Sir: I have
missed you for several days, since my
old eyes ain't what they used to be,
and besides these new-fangled peep
sights don't work much good.
Signed: Dan'l Boom.
This column, like so many
others, has not supported any
thing in particular. It has in
tended to be a daily column and
has proved to be a column for the
Daily. But. now we are resolved
on a driving campaign. Retain
the Bonfire! Preserve our Tradi
tions! Put a nickle in the slot and
sound the marching song!
Later: A friend has tipped us
off that the Bonfire is going to
be retained. Just another proof
of the power of this column.
The next move will be linked with
the proposed abolition of sororities.
Another friend —one of a host, of
course, suggests that one sorority be
burned each year, and the rally be
held at the scene.

Of course, the bonfire might be pre
maturely set off in some instances.
THEN, TOO, THERE IS THE MAT- '
TEIt OF FIRE INSURANCE.
Perhaps the whole matter ought to
I be dropped, as the freshman said as

lie looked down the stair-well from
the fourth floor with a bag of eggs
j in his hand.
We have been thinking it over. Is
the famous Roble span a suspension
bridge?

MANY A PROPOSAL HAS BEEN
MADE THERE.
Shakespeare would stand aghast at
his well-known statement if he knew
that Northwestern's star diver is
named Colbath.
