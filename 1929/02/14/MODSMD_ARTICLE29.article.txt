# FIFTEEN MEN QUALIFY TO COMPETE IN CLASS EVENTS OF MARATHON
## 
### 
Fifteen men ran their qualifying
heats yesterday for the class relay

teams to compete in the Irish Mara
thon to be held next Tuesday after
noon, together with the annual Inter
class Track and Field Meet, in the
Stadium. W. G. French, '29, turned
in the best time of the day for the
quarter-mile, running the distance in
53 1-5 s. John Jennings, '30, ran his
heat in 53 3-5 s. for the second fastest
qualifying time made yesterday.
Of the fifteen men that qualified,
four are seniors, two juniors, two
sophomores, and seven freshmen. In
asmuch as each team will be com
posed of twenty-four men, there is
still plenty of opportunity for many
men to qualify in every class. Anyone
registered in the University is eligi
ble to compete, graduates and hold
overs competing as seniors in the
marathon and interclass meet. Quali
fying heats for the marathon may be
run this afternoon from 3:30 until 5
o'clock, tomorrow from 3:30 until 4
o'clock and Monday afternoon from
3:30 until 5 o'clock.
The preliminary and semi-final
heats of all track and field events,
except the half-mile, mile, and two
mile, will be run off tomorrow after
noon on the practice track, beginning
at 4 o'clock.
The class of '29 relay team, which
came through with a strong finish to
win the Irish Marathon last year from
the freshman ('3l) team, is again
favored to annex this race with the
sophomores doped to furnish most of
the competition and possibly to score
a victory. Medals will be awarded for
the best varsity and non-varsity times
made in the marathon.
Twenty-five cents admission will be
charged for the interclass meet and
marathon.
