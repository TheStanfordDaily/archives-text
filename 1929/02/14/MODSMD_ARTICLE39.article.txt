# "WILD DUCK" SETS ARE MORE DIFFICULT THAN SCENES IN LAST PLAY
## 
### 
Although there are only two set
tings in "The Wild Duck," to be pre
sented March 1, they will entail just
as much work as the four used in
"What Every Woman Knows," ac
cording to Harold Helvenston. They
will be more detailed and complicated
than the comparatively simple sets
of the last play, and a semi-perma
nent structure will not be employed,
so two complete scenes will have to
be built.
Work has already begun on the
construction of the sets. The scene
lor the first two acts is laid in the
living-room of a wealthy merchant's
home, and the rococo gingerbread ef
fect, so fashionable at the end of the
last century, will be accentuated. The
setting for the third act is in a pho
tographer's studio, which is more se
vere in line than the first; a contrast
of light and dark will be used for
this scene. The colors of the scenes
are dulled, to fit the rather somber
tone of the play.
The Ibsen drama is laid in Norway,
in about 1890 —fifteen years earlier
than the Barrie romance —so that cos
tumes aud furnishings will be even
more ornate than in the last produc
tion. Helvenston requests that any
one who has costumes, particularly
men's clothes, or furniture of that
period, telephone him at the Green
Room, Local 76U2, or write him at
Box 2182, Campus.
