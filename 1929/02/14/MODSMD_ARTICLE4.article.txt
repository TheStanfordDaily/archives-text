By LEONARD BARTLETT
As Hoover's March 4th inaugura
tion looms nearer and Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur's silence remains impenetra
ble, conjectures, postulations, and
fuumisals continue to hover about the
University president and the Secre
tary of Interior post.
Comprehensive reorganization of
the interior department is purported
as being the reason for Hoover's se
lection of Dr. Wilbur. Advocates of
this theory feel that Hoover contem
plates a sweeping change throughout
the entire Department of Interior. It
is thought that the new secretary will
face the problem of classifying the
present hodge-podge of heterogenei
ties into four big sub-departments.
Interior activities would be grouped,
new ones added to the scheme, and a
systematic administration of internal
affairs of the nation worked out.
Such a plan was considered by the
Harding administration, but it ad
vanced no farther than a few minor
readjustments.
The proposed four new sub-depart

ments would probably be organized
niong the following trend:
1. Conservation, under wliicb would
come forests, oil, waterpower, and
water. Possibly the Bureau of Mines,
| now under Commerce, would be trans-
I ferred to the Interior.
2. Education, which would probably
jlake the place of the proposed, but
now abandoned, separate Department
j of Education.
| 3. Public health.
4. Recreation, under which might
possibly be national parks, now in
i the Department of Agriculture.
Where, under this plan, Alaska, In
| dian affairs and other activities would
i come, is not known, but the general
j aspects of the proposal are said to be
j under consideration by President-elect
j Hoover.
Now comes the consideration —why
j would Hoover select Wilbur for the
J Secretaryship of Interior? It is doubt
j tul if there is any man in America
; who could be considered more capa
| ole of untangling the scrambled skein
' of Interior affairs than Ray Lyman
Wilbur. Wilbur is an ardent conserva- j
tionist, and a member of the State
Park Commission. He is an educator
of a new school, and is continually
; looking into the future.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, as a doctor of
medicine and a past president of the i
, American Medical Association, is a;
j leader in public health movements,
j And lastly, as one of California's lead
! ing social workers, he is deeply con
: cerned with matters of recreation.
Stanford University has been a
| long-standing bond between 'Bert
; Hoover and Ray Wilbur, as they used I
! to call each other in the days of En
j cina life. Bullsessions they enjoyed
| together. Confidants, they were. The
World War brought Hoover and Wil
bur into close contact once again. And
for the past decade or more they have ,
; worked together, solving the prob-1
j leras of Stanford.
i Life-long friends they are, and when
1 the stentorian cabinet-call rings l
across the nation from the banks of |
i the Potomac to the sunny lands of
,' Eldorado, a lanky, quiet educator-1
, physician-conservationist may be say-1
: ing adieu to the Cardinal campus he j

As Hoover's March 4th inaugura
tion looms nearer and Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur's silence remains impenetra
ble, conjectures, postulations, and
fuumisals continue to hover about the
University president and the Secre
tary of Interior post.
Comprehensive reorganization of
the interior department is purported
as being the reason for Hoover's se
lection of Dr. Wilbur. Advocates of
this theory feel that Hoover contem
plates a sweeping change throughout
the entire Department of Interior. It
is thought that the new secretary will
face the problem of classifying the
present hodge-podge of heterogenei
ties into four big sub-departments.
Interior activities would be grouped,
new ones added to the scheme, and a
systematic administration of internal
affairs of the nation worked out.
Such a plan was considered by the
Harding administration, but it ad
vanced no farther than a few minor
readjustments.
The proposed four new sub-depart

ments would probably be organized
niong the following trend:
1. Conservation, under wliicb would
come forests, oil, waterpower, and
water. Possibly the Bureau of Mines,
| now under Commerce, would be trans-
I ferred to the Interior.
2. Education, which would probably
jlake the place of the proposed, but
now abandoned, separate Department
j of Education.
| 3. Public health.
4. Recreation, under which might
possibly be national parks, now in
i the Department of Agriculture.
Where, under this plan, Alaska, In
| dian affairs and other activities would
i come, is not known, but the general
j aspects of the proposal are said to be
j under consideration by President-elect
j Hoover.
Now comes the consideration —why
j would Hoover select Wilbur for the
J Secretaryship of Interior? It is doubt
j tul if there is any man in America
; who could be considered more capa
| ole of untangling the scrambled skein
' of Interior affairs than Ray Lyman
Wilbur. Wilbur is an ardent conserva- j
tionist, and a member of the State
Park Commission. He is an educator
of a new school, and is continually
; looking into the future.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, as a doctor of
medicine and a past president of the i
, American Medical Association, is a;
j leader in public health movements,
j And lastly, as one of California's lead
! ing social workers, he is deeply con
: cerned with matters of recreation.
Stanford University has been a
| long-standing bond between 'Bert
; Hoover and Ray Wilbur, as they used I
! to call each other in the days of En
j cina life. Bullsessions they enjoyed
