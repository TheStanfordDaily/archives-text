As Hoover's March 4th inaugura
tion looms nearer and Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur's silence remains impenetra
ble, conjectures, postulations, and
fuumisals continue to hover about the
University president and the Secre
tary of Interior post.
Comprehensive reorganization of
the interior department is purported
as being the reason for Hoover's se
lection of Dr. Wilbur. Advocates of
this theory feel that Hoover contem
plates a sweeping change throughout
the entire Department of Interior. It
is thought that the new secretary will
face the problem of classifying the
present hodge-podge of heterogenei
ties into four big sub-departments.
Interior activities would be grouped,
new ones added to the scheme, and a
systematic administration of internal
affairs of the nation worked out.
Such a plan was considered by the
Harding administration, but it ad
vanced no farther than a few minor
readjustments.
The proposed four new sub-depart

ments would probably be organized
niong the following trend:
1. Conservation, under wliicb would
come forests, oil, waterpower, and
water. Possibly the Bureau of Mines,
| now under Commerce, would be trans-
I ferred to the Interior.
2. Education, which would probably
jlake the place of the proposed, but
now abandoned, separate Department
j of Education.
| 3. Public health.
4. Recreation, under which might
possibly be national parks, now in
i the Department of Agriculture.
Where, under this plan, Alaska, In
| dian affairs and other activities would
i come, is not known, but the general
j aspects of the proposal are said to be
j under consideration by President-elect
j Hoover.
Now comes the consideration —why
j would Hoover select Wilbur for the
J Secretaryship of Interior? It is doubt
j tul if there is any man in America
; who could be considered more capa
| ole of untangling the scrambled skein
