# YEARLING CAGERS TO CLOSE SEASON WITH WEEK-END CONTESTS
## Victorious Frosh Team Will Meet Fresno, Galileo In Final Game 
### WHITNEY WRIGHT 
Bringing to a close one of the most
successful seasons that any Stanford
freshman basketball team has ever
hod, the Cardinal yearlings will take
on the Fresno and Galileo High School
quintets tomorrow and Saturday
nights, respectively, as preliminaries
to the varsity-U.S.C. contests.
With only one defeat scored against
them, that at the hands of the Santa
Clara frosh by a two-point margin, the
babes will be fighting hard to preserve
their record and should have little
trouble winning both games, despite
the fact that their opponents have al
ready won their respective leagues.
Coach Bradshaw has been drilling
his charges in several new plays,
which he will probably try out against
the high school cagers. No starting
line-up has been announced as yet;
although Doub, who has been the
mainstay of the team during the en
tire season, is certain to start in the
pivot position, with Captain Baker
and Rudy Rintala in the guard berths.
Choice of forwards lies between Ray,
Shrader, and Kelly.
Of the two visiting fives the Galileo
cagers will probably be the most for
midable, since they have won the San
Francisco city championship and have
a fast, smooth-working team.
