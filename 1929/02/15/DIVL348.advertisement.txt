"Good Smoke!"

Dear Sir:
Going to take the pleasure and drop
you a few lines to ray that my favorite
tobacco is your Edgeworth. I have
been a user of it for the last eight
years and find it's the only tobacco
for a real good smoke.
For the last five or six months I
have been trying several other kinds
but I find Edgeworth is the only
tobacco for me.
If I am smoking any other brand
my wife will tell me, as she likes the
smell of only Edgeworth. When I'm
smoking others she opens all windows
and doors.
The reason for writing this letter
is that I had a card party last night,
and most all of the party asked me
what kind of tobacco I used.
So I told them Edgeworth.
Yours very truly,
A smoker of Edgeworth
