# TROJANS ARRIVE FOR INVASION OF CARD TERRITORY
## U.S.C. Quintet to Battle for Second Place Honors; Hunt Gives Team Stiff Workout Fawcett, Berg Are Slated to Start for Stanford; Home Squad Is in Fine Condition 
### ANSON REEDER 
The Trojans of Southern California
arrive here this morning for their an
nual court invasion of Stanford. They
will battle the Cardinal quintet to
night and tomorrow night in the
Pavilion for second place honors in
the Southern Division of the Pacific
Coast Conference. Both contests will
begin at 8 o'clock.
A double win over the Cards and a
victory over the Uclans in the third
game of the season next week-end
would move the Trojans up to second
place in this half of the Loop. And
with a double win over the Bruins to
'heir credit all ready, after beginning
the season with three straight de
feats at the hands of the Cards and
Bears, the Southerners look as if they
had a good chance to finish the year
iu a blaze of glory. Coach Leo Calland
predicts it, and his charges claim
they are ready to prove it.
Cards Have Chance
Coach Husky Hunt has been put
ling his men through a stiff workout
■daily, in preparation for these two
contests. If the Redshirts win both
tilts from the Trojans, and the Bears
lose to U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles this
week-end, the Cards wlil still be able
to tie California for first place by
beating them on the Oakland Audi
torium court February 23. Although it
is possible that the Bruins may beat
their older brothers, it is not prob
able; so the two contests really re
vert into a matter of keeping South
ern California from copping second
place honors.
The Cards have not forgotten that
afternoon last November when Troy
rose to the occasion against the great
Red machine on the gridiron in the
Coliseum and won decisively 10 to 0.
The Southern institution always puts
a team into the fray that pushes the
opposition to its limit. In the first
game of the court series the Trojans
came from behind the latter part of
the first period and scored ten points
to tie the score after the Cards looked
as if they were on their way to a
lopsided victory.
Offensive Drill
Offensive drill has been Coach
Hunt's tonic for his charges during
the past week. Fawcett and Berg are
slated to start the contest at the for
ward positions, while McCandless will
do the honors at center. Captain Roth
ert and Reynolds will probably start
as guards. Everyone on the squad is
in good shape and most of them will
probably see action during one or the
other of the contests. The lineup:
Stanford — So. California—

Bears, the Southerners look as if they
had a good chance to finish the year
iu a blaze of glory. Coach Leo Calland
predicts it, and his charges claim
they are ready to prove it.
Cards Have Chance
Coach Husky Hunt has been put
ling his men through a stiff workout
■daily, in preparation for these two
contests. If the Redshirts win both
tilts from the Trojans, and the Bears
lose to U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles this
week-end, the Cards wlil still be able
to tie California for first place by
beating them on the Oakland Audi
torium court February 23. Although it
is possible that the Bruins may beat
their older brothers, it is not prob
able; so the two contests really re
vert into a matter of keeping South
ern California from copping second
place honors.
The Cards have not forgotten that
afternoon last November when Troy
rose to the occasion against the great
Red machine on the gridiron in the
Coliseum and won decisively 10 to 0.
The Southern institution always puts
a team into the fray that pushes the
opposition to its limit. In the first
game of the court series the Trojans
came from behind the latter part of
the first period and scored ten points
to tie the score after the Cards looked
as if they were on their way to a
lopsided victory.
Offensive Drill
Offensive drill has been Coach
Hunt's tonic for his charges during
the past week. Fawcett and Berg are
slated to start the contest at the for
ward positions, while McCandless will
do the honors at center. Captain Roth
ert and Reynolds will probably start
as guards. Everyone on the squad is
in good shape and most of them will
probably see action during one or the
other of the contests. The lineup:
Stanford — So. California—
Fawcett F Cano
Berg F Nibley
McCandless C Mortensen
Reynolds Lehners 1

The Trojans of Southern California
arrive here this morning for their an
nual court invasion of Stanford. They
will battle the Cardinal quintet to
night and tomorrow night in the
Pavilion for second place honors in
the Southern Division of the Pacific
Coast Conference. Both contests will
begin at 8 o'clock.
A double win over the Cards and a
victory over the Uclans in the third
game of the season next week-end
would move the Trojans up to second
place in this half of the Loop. And
with a double win over the Bruins to
'heir credit all ready, after beginning
the season with three straight de
feats at the hands of the Cards and
Bears, the Southerners look as if they
had a good chance to finish the year
iu a blaze of glory. Coach Leo Calland
