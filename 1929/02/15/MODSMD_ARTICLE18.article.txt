| Exercises as the elate for the benefit |
j vaudeville which Masquers, Ram's
I Head, and Sword and Sandals are !
i giving to raise money for the New !

' week after the presentation ,of "The !
| Wild Duck" is already filled by lec- j
tures and an A.S.S.U. concert, and !
j !
that any later in this quarter would
! bring the production too close to \
| finals.

ly set as the price of admission by j
the committee in charge, which is '
now working on the program. Present :
plans indicate that the vaudeville will j
start early in the evening, at about
;7:30 o'clock, and will not last longer
than an hour and a half or two hours.
Instead of setting aside a few seats I
1 tor a Rough section, it has been de- j
j cided that the entire Assembly Hall
j will be devoted to this, and the eve
i ning will be an informal one.
The stars of former "Football Gaie- 1
| ties" and Junior Operas, most of |
; whom belong to one of these three |
1 campus dramatic organizations, have
: already started work on the skits and j
| songs which will be used, and the
entire Masquers Society will probably
j be used in the pony chorus.
