j though most of these were against
San Jose town teams, the Mission Col
i lege boys should give the Cards plenty
jof trouble tomorrow.
Johnny Casanova will probably
j start on the mound for the Broncs |
j and either Axt or Tassi will catch.
Gene Kern will probably be Coach
I Wolter's choice to pitch for the Red- j
I shirts, and Perry Taylor should work
