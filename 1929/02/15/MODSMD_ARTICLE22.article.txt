# RE-ELECTION DECLARED INVALID AT SESSION OF EX COMMITTEE
## Election Board Finds Evidence of Ballot Box Tampering in Counting Votes; Tuesday, February 19, Is Set as Second Re-Vote Date 
### 
rPHE class and A.S.S.U. re-election, held yesterday, was declared invalid by
the Executive Committee at a special meeting of that body called at the
request of the Election Board last night.
In counting the ballots, the Election Board found evidence that led it to
believe that the ballot box had been tampered with. Thirty-three ballots
were found packed together. They were all for the same class officer and
were marked in the same manner by the same colored ink. The Executive

►Committee set Tuesday, February 19,
for a second re-election.
The following statement on the
matter was made by Dave Jacobson,
I chairman of the Election Board:
As soon as the polls were closed at
two o'clock the ballots were taken
into the Political Science building to
be counted. The contents of three
boxes had been sorted and the count
was being made. The vote was light,
i and the tellers were checking the
votes almost as fast as they were
being sorted. One other member of
thi» Election Board and I were open
i ing the last box. This box contained
| the Men's A.S.S.U. ballots. While
sorting these ballots a batch of thirty
-1 three was found, all together, all of
the same class, marked with the same
peculiarly-colored ink, designating
the same person. It was obvious that
the ballot box had been stuffed. The
Election Board then asked the Execu
tive Committee to invalidate the elec
tion. —Dave Jacobson.
