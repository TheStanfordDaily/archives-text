# Give The Election Board a Fair Deal
## 
### 
The Executive Committee declared the re-election invalid at a special
meeting held last night at the request of the Election Board. Thirty-three
ballots were found packed together when the tellers were counting. All
were marked in the same manner, for the same officer, and in the same
Colored ink. To ill! appearances these hslfcts were put in by one person.
Invalidation by the Executive Committee was based on this evidence.
It cannot be said who did this. The Election Board because of its prox
imity to the whole affair suffers the most suspicion. There is no evidence
whatsoever to prove that any member of the Board has anything to do
with it. Nor is there evidence to prove that he did not.
The vote was light. The count so far as it had gone was close. The
ballot-box stuffing was done for one of two reasons: to carry the election
for the man for whom the thirty-three were marked or to cause a re
election and thus give the supporters of another candidate an opportunity
to do more electioneering.
A thorough investigation of the entire affair should be made. Ihe
investigation may find nothing further. In any event the matter will be
thoroughly aired and every effort will be made to place the responsibility.
Dave Jacobson, chairman of the Board, did everything in his power
to assure a fair election. It was he who found the suspicious ballots. It
will be he who will manage Tuesday's second re-election. Let the student
body back Jacobson to the fullest and assist him in guaranteeing a fair,
honest election.
On the supposition that the ballot-box stuffing might have been done
to cause a re-election, let the student body beware of electioneeering so
that as fair a duplication of the honest voting of yesterday's election be
made.
The Election Board bears the brunt of this affair. Theirs is the
greatest responsibility. Let the student body back them to the fullest as
fellow members of the student body and give them a fair deal.
