# The 						Popularization of Alcohol

Andrew Volstead, when telling his beads in the dark hours of the
night, might well count off one for the splendid recognition university
students have given his epoch-making law.
At one time, the university student looked askance at the man who
spent many hours in his cups, it wasn't the thing to do. But now in the
Volstead epoch, the university student looks with envy upon the man who
can afford to spend many hours in his cups. It is the thing to do.
Another change the Volstead epoch has brought about is in taste.
Once jovial students gathered and were well satisfied to seek Veritas in
znttOj but now Veritas has little bearing on the matter and search does not
end satisfactorily until gin with the old army mule kick in it is found.
Gin has forsaken the company of longshoremen and stevedores to rise
into the once sedate cloisters of the university. llie \ olstead epoch has
created a new mode.
No news is all this, but the problem presents itself anew with the
temperance prize contest being conducted by the eminent Mr. Hearst, a
newspaper man. The contest is not amiss. Americans can do well to
consider and consider well their "Noble Experiment." Ihe hue and cry
was raised with the victory of Hoover that his election was an affirma
tive referendum on Prohibition. It would be an absurd thing and an
insult to Mr. Hoover were it true that he won his election merely because
he supported Prohibition.
Prohibition can have no worse black eye than this that the university
student because of it has changed his attitude toward drinking from
accepting moderate drinking and disproving excess to countenancing
excess and accepting all drinking as the thing to do.
