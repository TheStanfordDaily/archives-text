# Did Laidler Speak in a Wilderness?
## 
### 
The visit of Dr. Harry Laidler, prominent advocate of socialistic doc
trines, to the campus created a mild stir in limited circles. Wednesday
evening he lectured for an hour to a small audience in the Assembly Hall
â€”an audience composed largely of erudite citizens of Palo Alto. Yester
day he spoke to at least one social science class.
The time is not far past when permitting a socialist to speak at
Stanford would be like permitting the Devil himself to conduct services
in the Memorial Church. But today Dr. Laidler, intellectual gentleman
with slightly radical ideas, is unmolested as he addresses Palo Alto towns
people, from a Stanford platform.
So, it may be deduced, Stanford is a few steps in advance of its
younger and less tolerant days.
But paens of thanksgiving are not being raised ununited by the campus
intelligensia. Rather, bitter complaints are heard concerning the rank com
placency and deadly mental lethargy of the student body which was so
conspicuous in its absence the other evening.
The speaker seemed a trifle disconcerted at first when he saw the
meagre group which faced him. Dr. Robinson, who introduced him,
appeared frankly embarassed. One attentive listener made so bold as to
ask Dr. Laidler, after the formal lecture was finished, if Wednesday's
was a typical college audience as found on his tour. The doctor, in
discreet and polite phraseology, let is be known that lie was used to
somewhat larger gatherings.
So on one hand we shout our thanksgiving for liberation from con
servatism and on the other we moan at our alarming lack of a thirst for
knowledge.
But such is Stanford, and such will it be for a long, long time. We
are very young here, and very rich. Doctrines of socialism, the uplift
of humanity seem like vague, dim dreams, none too pleasant. Then, too,
there is the movie in Palo Alto; there is Lagunita; and intramural
basketball.
Come back, Dr. Laidler, in a hundred years or so, and maybe we can
more fittingly receive you.
