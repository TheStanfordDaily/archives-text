AT THE THEATRES
Week-end trekkers from the Farm |
to the theatres of the Big City can j
take their choice of an unusually |
large variety of legitimate produc- j
tions, due principally to two changes '
in billings on Sunday.
ALCAZAR. Emma Dunn in Courage
continues to hold the boards in a !
thoroughly good comedy.
COLUMBIA. The justly famous i
O'Oyly Carte Opera Company, of j
which you have read many good
words in the Daily, closes a triumph- i
ant run with the presentation of The ;
Mikado tonight, and Saturday mati-1
nee and evening. On Sunday the San j
Francisco Stock Exchange will pre-'
sent the Stanford Junior Opera,
South Seas Preferred. The 19th Hole
opens Monday by and with Frank
Craven and a New York cast.
CURRAN. The Music Box Revue
starring Lupino Lane and Doris Eaton '
finishes Saturday night. Lupino Lane
is worth seeing, the rest is nothing
particular unless you like that sort of
stuff. The Silent House, a creepy,
shivery thriller opens Sunday night.
It is ballyhooed as "the greatest
thriller ever staged."
GEARY, Lowell Sherman, of film
fame, is more than ably assisted by
Doris Lloyd in The Guardsman by
Ferenc Molnar. This delectable com
edy ran for a full year when pre
sented by the New York Theatre
Guild, and we specially recommend
it for high class comedy.
GREEN STREET. Easy for Zee Zee
is in its 24th week. Regardless of the
fact that the Lit praised it unquali
fiedly, we suggest that you use dis
cretion as to whom you take with you. j
PRESIDENT. This Thing Called
Love ends its hilarious run on Satur
day night. Good, clean, light comedy.
It is replaced by The Skull which
opens with the Sunday matinee. It t
looks as though "The Skull" and "The j
Silent House" are going to compete !
to see which can furnish the most
horrors and terror per minute of en
tertainment.
There you are, a total of nine plays
from which you can choose. We are |
planning to run a theatre guide every ;
Friday. If you would like to have the
addresses of these theatres included
in this column will you please drop a
line to the editor?

The Elegant Infidelities of Madame
Li Pei Fou. By Charles Pettit.
(New York: Horace Liverwright.) |
For providing sheer enjoyment, this
novel could hardly be surpassed. De- i
lightful, racy, sparkling, spicy—such

a description comes immediately to
mind upon reading it, and these ad
jectives are deserved in full measure.
The book has so many merits, it is
hard not to be too enthusiastic. For
one thing, its sole justification is its
ability to entertain. There is no pur
pose or moral even hinted at, and
yet in spite of this —or perhaps bet
ter because of this —it seems definite
ly worthwhile. There are any number
of quotable passages, and at the end
some interesting and remarkable
fragments of philosophy.
Undoubtedly the book's best point
is its unique and entrancing style.
The exquisite and refined diction of
the orient coupled with the subtle
irony characteristic of the oriental
point of view combine to make the
novel a superb work. Also, the story
is not a little wicked. This might have
as much to do as the real art of the
book in accounting for "The Elegant
Infidelities of Madame LiPei Fu"being
the book that everyone is reading.
The story is gay and fantastic, re
volving around the adventures of a
lovely and determined lady who takes
advantage of the absence of her il
lustrious but tiresome spouse, and de
votes herself to the education of the
handsome and innocent adolescent,
Grain of Rice. His education proceeds
rapidly, and, from his standpoint,
charmingly.
From perpetually losing and then
recovering his composure, and from
turning a pale yellow or else blushing
a deep orange, Grain of Rice finally
becomes accustomed to feminine ca
prices, and although he still preserves
his expression of youthful innocence,
it conceals a keen appreciation of the
value of discretion in the matter of
the joys of love.
The deft touch of the author swings
the plot along easily and swiftly, al
most of its own momentum. Each new
turn of events becomes more edifying.
In the end the perfidious Grain of
Rice, preferring the scent of roses
that have the least thorns, deserts his
elegant, but too arduous teacher for
a less demanding mistress, after the
time-honored manner of his sex.
The last paragraph takes a neat
slap at the United States: "Alas, the
women of China may achieve eman
cipation, but they will not alter the
evil natures of men. However all hope
is not denied them. The great night
may yet come when they will have the
joy of exchanging with husbands and
lovers the revolver shots of really
modern emotional drama —or openly
in full daylight—reflecting the while
en a probable acquittal in the courts
of law." —M. L. R.
