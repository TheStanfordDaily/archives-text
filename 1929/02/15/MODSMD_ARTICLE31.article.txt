# BEBE DANIELS PLANS TO CONSTRUCT NEW WOMEN'S DORMITORY AT U.C.L.A.

Bebe Daniels is interested in col
lege women. She flew up to San Fran- j
cisco last Saturday—a pleasant four- j
hour ride from Los Angeles—and be- j
fore she departed for the airport to j
fly home she told me about the unique ■
apartment-dormitory she is going to '
build for women at U.C.L.A.
"I have a fine site near the new j
campus, and I am going to have an !
apartment-dormitory in which every !
room will be different. Each girl can j
fix her room to suit herself. Individu
ality is my scheme in designing the j
building. The Dean of Women of the j
university will have supervision of |
the occupants."
Bebe is anxious to get this project j
started, and now that she is not work- ]
ing for awhile she can devote a lot of
time to it. Harold Lloyd made her his ;
leading lady when she was just four-1
teen, and at eighteen she was made a j
full-fledged star by Paramount. For 1
the past eight years she has been that j
company's most consistently popular
star. She didn't have time to go to !
college, but now she's taking time to
build an unusual home for the girls j
who have no professional careers to j
keep them busy.
As to the movies—"l'm sick and J
tired of playing in these illogical,
dare-devil comedies. I'll never do an- j
other picture that ends up in a grand
chase. Right now I'm going to rest.
I've been working steadily for years
without a vacation,and I think I de-1
serve one.
"I'm going to do just what I want
for awhile —take up my fencing again, j
build this college apartment, enjoy !
my new home, and learn to fly an
airplane." Bebe has already done more '
travel by air than any other actress. ,
Several months ago she made a round
trip to New York in a plane, so this
jaunt to San Francisco was just a
small affair. "It's the only way to
travel," she claims.
Dick Hyland interviewed Bebe re-1
cently for Photoplay Magazine, and
when his Injuries from football were |
compared to those Bebe got doing
comedy stunts, it was found that the
movies were more dangerous than
football. Hospitals were beginning to !
look like home, she says. "No more j
thrill pictures for me. I'm going to
do straight drama when I finish rest- j
lng up. Later I may do subtle, sophis- 1
tieated comedies." But Bebe is not |
going to have any more bones broken, i

"Talkies? Surely, my next will be
all-talking. I see no great difficulty in
making them" She is a talkie enthu
siast. "They haven't been very good
yet, but they will be.
"I should think talking pictures
would be wonderful for instruction in
college. Wouldn't it be great if a com
plete operation could be seen and
heard by medical students —with all
the advantages the movie close-ups
would bring?"
Before she goes back to work, Bebe
will probably take time off to be mar
ried. Ben Lyon, film star, is the man
who has finally persuaded her to
