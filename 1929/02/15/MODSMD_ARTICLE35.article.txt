# "TALKY" OPERATORS MUST KNOW LINES, CUES OF EACH PLAY
## Four Large Amplifiers Are Used to Carry Sound Out to Audience 
### WINSTON NORMAN 
Screen and stage stars are not the
only people who must rehearse for
the parts they play. Projection men
at the New Stanford Theatre also
have their cues and lines to learn
since the New Stanford became one
of the pioneers in installation of
equipment for Vitaphone and Movie
tone sound pictures.
In order to time a change of reels
to the exact instant, the operators
must memorize numerous cues. Here
is a sketch of what happens in the
projection room when a "switch" is
made:
First, half a minute or so before
the 1000-foot reel is run out, an auto
matic device buzzes a warning to the
operators. Next, on the screen, per
haps fifteen seconds before the
change, Buddy Rogers takes the girl
in his arms. That is the "warning
cue." One operator is standing with
each of his bands on a lever. The
other waits at the synchronizing de
vice, to switch the sound reel simul
taneously, so that when the new reel
begins folks will be talking when they
Bay something.
The "Switch" Cue
The "switch" cue: Buddy Rogers
declares, "Darling, I love you," where
upon one operator says "Go!" and
events happen in the projection room.
One lever "douses" the shutter of the
projection machine, another lever
Htarts the projector's twin brother,
and the sound device "switches" at
the same instant. As far as the audi
ence is concerned, nothing has hap
pened but artistic and uninterrupted
osculation.
In addition to being agile, the oper
ators must be expert electrical men.
The blueprint of the new wiring, for
example, resembles a Chinese cross
word puzzle.
The projection men have a tiny pri
vate amplifier which brings them the
synchronization, and they can amplify
or soften the sound by means of dials
on a little control box between the
twin projectors. This control unit is
somewhat smaller than au apple box,

looks like a radio, and cost a mere
l $5000. What is inside of it, Einstein
j only knows.
Four Amplifiers Used
I On the stage, back of the screen,
! are two tall "amplifying towers,"
! heavily insulated to prevent echoes
j from backstage. In these towers are
I four immense amplifiers, each of them
six feet across, which brings the
voices and sound to the audience.
The above are only a few of the
features whose installation alone cost
the New Stanford Theatre around
$20,000, and which have made life
I complicated for Harry E. Browne,
! manager of the New Stanford. But
! Browne feels that the amazing future
lof sound pictures will justify life's
i complexity.
"Within two years," he predicted,
J "watching a sound picture should give
| the same effect as watching a stage
production. Producers are now per
! feet natural-color photography, and a
! stereoscopic principle which will give
'depth' to the film."
Expressing his belief that numerous
benefits will result from sound pic-
I tures, Browne said: "Many excellent
! plays are now available for sound pro
duction which were impossible in si
. lent pictures because of dialogue. It
j will mean that superior talent and
i material will be used. I believe that
! American audiences will be trained,
:as a result, to appreciate better
i drama."

Four Amplifiers Used
I On the stage, back of the screen,

I four immense amplifiers, each of them
six feet across, which brings the
voices and sound to the audience.
The above are only a few of the
features whose installation alone cost
the New Stanford Theatre around
$20,000, and which have made life

lof sound pictures will justify life's

"Within two years," he predicted,
J "watching a sound picture should give

production. Producers are now per

! stereoscopic principle which will give
'depth' to the film."
Expressing his belief that numerous
benefits will result from sound pic-
I tures, Browne said: "Many excellent
! plays are now available for sound pro
duction which were impossible in si

Screen and stage stars are not the
only people who must rehearse for
the parts they play. Projection men
at the New Stanford Theatre also
have their cues and lines to learn
since the New Stanford became one
of the pioneers in installation of
equipment for Vitaphone and Movie
tone sound pictures.
In order to time a change of reels
to the exact instant, the operators
must memorize numerous cues. Here
is a sketch of what happens in the
projection room when a "switch" is
made:
First, half a minute or so before
the 1000-foot reel is run out, an auto
matic device buzzes a warning to the
operators. Next, on the screen, per
haps fifteen seconds before the
change, Buddy Rogers takes the girl
in his arms. That is the "warning
cue." One operator is standing with
each of his bands on a lever. The
other waits at the synchronizing de
vice, to switch the sound reel simul
taneously, so that when the new reel
begins folks will be talking when they
Bay something.
The "Switch" Cue
The "switch" cue: Buddy Rogers
declares, "Darling, I love you," where
upon one operator says "Go!" and
events happen in the projection room.
One lever "douses" the shutter of the
projection machine, another lever
Htarts the projector's twin brother,
and the sound device "switches" at
the same instant. As far as the audi
ence is concerned, nothing has hap
pened but artistic and uninterrupted
osculation.
In addition to being agile, the oper
ators must be expert electrical men.
The blueprint of the new wiring, for
example, resembles a Chinese cross
word puzzle.
