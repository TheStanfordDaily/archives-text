# BAY DIVISION FENCING CHAMPIONSHIPS TO BE DECIDED HERE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford will have a three-man
team in the San Francisco Bay Divi
sion fencing championships to be held
at Encina Gym tonight beginning at
8 o'clock. No admission charge will
be made for the event, which is being
held under the auspices of the Ama
teur Fencers League of America.
The Stanford team will be com
posed of Captain Herkimer Adams,
Fletcher Dutton, and Jack Snyder,
with Orray Taft as alternate. In ad
dition to the Stanford team, there will
be entries from the University of
California, the Olympic Club, and the
U.S.I.V. of San Francisco.
According to Coach Harry Maloney,
the Olympic squad is the team to
beat in the tournament. It includes
such stars as Lester, Smits, and Von
Arnold. Lester is a former Stanford
fencer who transfered to Yale, and
who won the National Intercollegiate
fencing title. As the Stanford foilsmen
defeated California last year in the
annual meet, they are favored to re
peat tonight.
Maloney believes that the Stanford
team has an even chance to win the
tournament. A first place will give
the team the right to represent the
Northern Division in the Pacific Coast
championships to be held next month,
an honor won by a Stanford fencing
team two years ago.
Assistant Coach Bugge asks all in
terested persons to attend the bouts.
As the competition will last until 11
o'clock at least, there will be plenty
of action left for spectators after the
basketball game at the Pavilion.
