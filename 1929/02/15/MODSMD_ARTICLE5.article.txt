# FROSH CAGERS WILL CLOSE SEASON WITH HIGH SCHOOL GAMES
## Freshmen Will Face Fresno, Galileo Quintets Here In Preliminaries 
### 
Stanford basketball fans will have
their last opportunity to see Coach
James "Rabbit" Bradshaw's highly
successful 1929 yearling cage team in
action tonight and tomorrow night
when they face the Fresno and Gali
leo high school quintets in the Cardi
nal Pavilion as preliminaries to the
varsity-U.S.C. contests.
Despite the fact that both visiting
fives have already won their respective
leagues, the Stanford youngsters
should have little trouble in winning,
since they will be entering the fray
determined to maintain their record
of only one defeat. Of the two visit
ing teams, the San Franciscans will
probably be the most formidable.
The Cardinals' starting lineup has
been announced as follows: Ray and
Clough, forwards, Doub, center, and
Baker and Rintala, guards.
Ray took high-point honors in the
babes' last contest with the Bear cubs
and has been improving steadily dur
ing the past few weeks. Clough, who
has been a third-string forward dur
ing the majority of the season, has
also been showing a marked improve
ment in recent practice sessions and
can be expected to give the opposing
guards plenty of trouble.
If this lineup proves successful it
will probably be used in the second
game as well. Both contests will start
at 6:45 o'clock.
