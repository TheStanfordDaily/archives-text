There were two big surprises in the afternoon. Whitey Burns established
j a new Pacific Coast Intercollegiate record in the 100-yard breast-stroke in
! defeating Eddie Lennox, former national intercollegiate champion. The new
I time is 1:13.2. Ed Throndson completely upset expectations by winning the
diving contest in competition with
