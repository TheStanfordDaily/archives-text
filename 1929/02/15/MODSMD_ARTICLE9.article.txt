# VARSITY BOXERS TO LEAVE TONIGHT FOR TOURNEY WITH AGGIES
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney's varsity box
ing squad will travel to Davis tonight
to meet the California Aggies in the
first tournament of the season. Seven
regular bouts and three exhibitions
will make up the program.
Led by Captain Ed Dillon, the Stan
ford leather-pushers are out to avenge
their defeat at the hands of the Mus
tangs last year. Tonight the Cards
will be favored to win as they present
a team which, with but two excep
tions, is composed of veterans. Davis
will be represented by a number of
newcomers.
Maloney has announced the men
who will fight as follows: bantam
weight—John Sano; featherweight —
Paul Maurer; lightweight—Dan Frost;
welterweight — A1 Doerr; middle
weight—Lester Sands; light heavy
weight—Bill Hollingsworth; heavy
weight—Captain Ed Dillon. The fol
lowing men will box exhibitions:
lightweight—Harry Birch; welter
weight—John Dawson; middleweight
—Thad McNamara.
The men went through their final
workout the night before last when
each boxed a single round. Coach Ma
loney was well pleased with their
showing then and predicts that the
team should win easily tonight. Ac
cording to Maloney, the men are
showing more scientific skill in their
boxing than he has ever before wit
nessed in a collegiate team.
