# STANFORD HOLDS SECOND HONORS BY TROJAN WINS
## Cardinals Beat U.S.C. Twice With Scores of 31-21 and 28-25; Bears Win Title Third Game of Series With California To Be Played At Oakland Auditorium 
### 
The Stanford varsity basketball
team ended the series with a double
win over the Trojans of Southern
California in the Pavilion Friday and
Saturday nights. The l'espective
scores were 31 to 21 and 28 to 25.
While the Cards were trouncing
their opponents in the latter cont- ;t
the University of California quintet
was decisively trimming the Uclans
in the South. The Bears by winning
this contest became undisputed cham
pions of the Southern Division of the
Conference for 1929, and earned the
right to meet the University of Wash
ington in Seattle the latter part of
ihis month for the Loop title.
The Redshirts by virtue of their
double victory over the Trojans re
tained second-place honors in the
Southern section, and thereby com
pleted one of the most successful
casaba seasons in years. The Cards
have one more game to play with the
Bears in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
urday night, but this will have no re- I
flection on Conference standings. \
However, the traditional battle is ex- j
pected to draw one of the largest !
crows of the season.
In the two week-end clashes against
the Trojans, the Redshirts played a
streaked game, sometimes showing I
flashes of power in otherwise drab j
contests. The tilt Friday night was a i
rather sloppy affair, both teams play- |
ing a slow game with the exception I
of the closing minutes of the contest. |
With the score tied nineteen all, Haw
kins, who had replaced McCandless
at center, went wild and sank three j
field goals in quick succession, fol- 1
lowing baskets by Fawcett and Tyler,
to give the Cards their ten-point mar
gin of victory.
Saturday's contest was won by a
second-period comeback, when after
trailing 17 to 14 at half time, the Red- j
shirts came from behind mainly j
through the work of Tyler, who had j
replaced Berg at forward during the
first period. Tyler scored twelve )
points for high-point honors, and in
addition was conspicuous with his
floorwork.
The work of Johnny Tampcke at
guar was especially notable in both
games. Although put out of the first
contest for excessive personal fouls, j
he was easily the outstanding player ,
of the series.
The Cards showed improvement in ;
making free throws at Saturday's per- |
formance. The previous evening they i
were able to convert only three out of j
a possible ten, while the Trojans j
failed to show anything startling I
when they made only five out of I
twelve themselves. On Saturday, how- j
ever, the Redshirts came into their j
own and made eight out of a possible j
seventeen for nearly a fifty per cent ;
average, the best this season.

In the two week-end clashes against
the Trojans, the Redshirts played a
streaked game, sometimes showing I
flashes of power in otherwise drab j
contests. The tilt Friday night was a i
rather sloppy affair, both teams play- |
ing a slow game with the exception I
of the closing minutes of the contest. |
With the score tied nineteen all, Haw
kins, who had replaced McCandless
at center, went wild and sank three j
field goals in quick succession, fol- 1
lowing baskets by Fawcett and Tyler,
to give the Cards their ten-point mar
gin of victory.
Saturday's contest was won by a
second-period comeback, when after
trailing 17 to 14 at half time, the Red- j
shirts came from behind mainly j
through the work of Tyler, who had j
replaced Berg at forward during the
first period. Tyler scored twelve )
points for high-point honors, and in
addition was conspicuous with his
floorwork.
The work of Johnny Tampcke at
guar was especially notable in both
games. Although put out of the first
contest for excessive personal fouls, j
he was easily the outstanding player ,
of the series.
The Cards showed improvement in ;
making free throws at Saturday's per- |
formance. The previous evening they i
were able to convert only three out of j
a possible ten, while the Trojans j
failed to show anything startling I
when they made only five out of I
twelve themselves. On Saturday, how- j
ever, the Redshirts came into their j
own and made eight out of a possible j
seventeen for nearly a fifty per cent ;
average, the best this season.
The Stanford varsity basketball
team ended the series with a double
win over the Trojans of Southern
California in the Pavilion Friday and
Saturday nights. The l'espective
scores were 31 to 21 and 28 to 25.
While the Cards were trouncing
their opponents in the latter cont- ;t
the University of California quintet
was decisively trimming the Uclans
in the South. The Bears by winning
this contest became undisputed cham
pions of the Southern Division of the
Conference for 1929, and earned the
right to meet the University of Wash
ington in Seattle the latter part of
ihis month for the Loop title.
The Redshirts by virtue of their
double victory over the Trojans re
tained second-place honors in the
Southern section, and thereby com
pleted one of the most successful
casaba seasons in years. The Cards
have one more game to play with the
Bears in the Oakland Auditorium Sat
urday night, but this will have no re- I
flection on Conference standings. \
However, the traditional battle is ex- j
pected to draw one of the largest !
crows of the season.
