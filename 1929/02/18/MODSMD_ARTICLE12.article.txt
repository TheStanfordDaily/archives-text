# Stanford B.A.C. Gives $50,000 to Endowment Fund
## Donation Will Be Used in Drive for University's "First Million" 
### 
Remunerative athletic contests held
during the past year made possible
a contribution of $50,000 by the Stan
ford Board of Athletic Control to the
Stanford endowment fund this week.
This announcement was made Friday
following approval of the action
Thursday by the Board of Trustees
at their regular meeting in San Fran
cisco.
The sum given by the B.A.C. will
be added to the amount already sub
scribed to the fund's first million.
Authorities declare that the new total
will put the University within strik
ing distance of the million dollar goal
which must be reached by May in
order to obtain further appropriations.
The gift actually involves the con
tribution of $71,000, according to Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, who points out
that for each seven dollars received
by the University in the first million
the Carnegie Foundation will add
three dollars. Should the University
receive a total of $700,000 before May
the Carnegie institution will add
$300,000, bringing the total to the mil
lion dollar goal.
Several years ago the Board of Ath
letic Control aided the University by
contributing $450,000 for the construc
tion of a men's dormitory. The cost
of this structure is borne by the
board on a yearly plan.
