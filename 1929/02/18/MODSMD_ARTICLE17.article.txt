# STEVENSON LOSES TO S.C. ENTRY IN COAST GOLF TOURNEY FINAL
## 
### 
Richie Stevenson, Stanford dark
horse in the Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate Golf tourney, lost the 1929 cham
pionship to a more experienced player
when Allen Moser, University of
Southern California entry, defeated
him four and three in a hard-fought
thirty-six hole match Saturday at Del
Monte. Harry Eielielberger, Cardinal
l'rosh, had little difficulty in winning
the championship in the second flight,
tor freshmen and ineligible players,
when he defeated Ken White, also of
Stanford, 13 and 12.
Three Stanford men were elected
by the members of the association to
hold the principal offices for the com
ing year. Doug White was named to
succeed Herbert Fleishhacker as
president; Ward Edmonds, captain of
the Stanford golf team, was elected
vice-president, and Warren Johnson
recretary-treasurer for 1929. White
appointed Ward Edmonds chairman
of the tournament committee, naming
Gibson Dunlap, University of Califor
nia at Los Angeles, and Allen Moser
as the other members.
The final match Saturday proved
the most interesting of the tourna
ment. On the first eighteen Stevenson
was playing brilliant golf, but Moser
was able to come through in the
pinches, while Stevenson was nervous
when the competition grew tense. The
Stanford player lost several holes
when his puts stopped on the lip of
the cup.
On the second eighteen, Moser was
one up, coming to the twelfth hole.
But on each of the next three holes,
the new champion laid clever stymie
shots for his opponent to putt, and
won the holes when Stevenson was
unable to sink them. The match ended
on the fifteenth.
Results of the final rounds were:
.Allen Moser defeated Warner Ed
monds 6 and 5; Ward Edmonds de
feated Doug White, 3 and 1; Steven
son defeated Rod Houser (U.C.L.A.)
one up in an extra-hole match; Bob
Brownstein (U.C.L.A.) defeated Gib
son Dunlap (U.C.L.A.) 2 and 1.
In the semi-finals Moser defeated
Ward Edmonds, 5 and 4; and Steven
son defeated Brownstein 3 and 2. In
the semi-finals of the second flight
Ken White defeated Chuck Coffin,
Stanford frosh, 3 and 1 in a close
match; and Harry Eielielberger de

Richie Stevenson, Stanford dark
horse in the Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate Golf tourney, lost the 1929 cham
pionship to a more experienced player
when Allen Moser, University of
Southern California entry, defeated
him four and three in a hard-fought
thirty-six hole match Saturday at Del
Monte. Harry Eielielberger, Cardinal
l'rosh, had little difficulty in winning
the championship in the second flight,
tor freshmen and ineligible players,
when he defeated Ken White, also of
Stanford, 13 and 12.
Three Stanford men were elected
by the members of the association to
hold the principal offices for the com
ing year. Doug White was named to
succeed Herbert Fleishhacker as
president; Ward Edmonds, captain of
the Stanford golf team, was elected
vice-president, and Warren Johnson
recretary-treasurer for 1929. White
appointed Ward Edmonds chairman
of the tournament committee, naming
Gibson Dunlap, University of Califor
nia at Los Angeles, and Allen Moser
as the other members.
The final match Saturday proved
the most interesting of the tourna
ment. On the first eighteen Stevenson
was playing brilliant golf, but Moser
was able to come through in the
pinches, while Stevenson was nervous
when the competition grew tense. The
Stanford player lost several holes
when his puts stopped on the lip of
the cup.
On the second eighteen, Moser was
one up, coming to the twelfth hole.
But on each of the next three holes,
the new champion laid clever stymie
shots for his opponent to putt, and
won the holes when Stevenson was
unable to sink them. The match ended
on the fifteenth.
Results of the final rounds were:
.Allen Moser defeated Warner Ed
monds 6 and 5; Ward Edmonds de
feated Doug White, 3 and 1; Steven
son defeated Rod Houser (U.C.L.A.)
one up in an extra-hole match; Bob
Brownstein (U.C.L.A.) defeated Gib
son Dunlap (U.C.L.A.) 2 and 1.
In the semi-finals Moser defeated
Ward Edmonds, 5 and 4; and Steven
son defeated Brownstein 3 and 2. In
the semi-finals of the second flight
Ken White defeated Chuck Coffin,
Stanford frosh, 3 and 1 in a close
match; and Harry Eielielberger de
feated Winston Fuller (U.S.C.) 4
and 3.
