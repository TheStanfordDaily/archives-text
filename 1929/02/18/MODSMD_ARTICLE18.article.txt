# Dave Jacobson Will Present New Plan to Ex Committee To Obviate Election Fraud
## 
### 
Revision of the election system
used to date in A.S.S.U. elections will
be proposed by Dave Jacobson, chair
man of the Election Board, to the
Executive Committee at its regular
meeting tomorrow night. An effort will
be made to institute this new system
in time to be used at spring election.
The revision will be made to pre
vent voting out of class, voting twice,
j and such tampering as occurred in
| Thursday's election. The new system
| provides a means of identification. An
J extra page will be inserted in the
I registration book carrying the voter's
' signature and class. The card will be
| filed and will replace the crossing out
of names in the Directory of Officers
and Students now in use.
The procedure of voting will be as
j follows under the proposed system,
j The voter will give his name to the
election official and receive his ballot
and the card, which he has signed at
registration in the registration book,
lie will mark his ballot and sign the
i card a second time. Before casting his
j ballot the election official will check
the two signatures.
The proposed plan will give a per
fect check of the number of ballots
! cast and eliminate a repetition of
| Thursday's tampering. This plan was
; devised by Leon Levi. Jacobson has
[ approached J. Pearce Mitchel, regis-
I trar with the new plan in an effort
I to have it instituted, providing the
Executive Committee accepts it.
