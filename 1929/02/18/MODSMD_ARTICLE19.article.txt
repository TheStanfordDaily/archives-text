# SEMI-FINALS OF MURAL HOOP TOURNAMENT TO BE RUN OFF TONIGHT
## 
### 
The semifinals of the intramural
basketball tourney will be played to
night in the Pavilion. Breakers will
meet Encina 4W Independents at 7:15
o'clock, while Sigma Chi and Kappa
Alpha will fight it out at 7:50 o'clock.
Although Kappa Alpha won the title
last year, the Sigma Chi quintet will
be a slight favorite to cop when the
two teams tangle on the hardwood
tonight.
Sigma Chi qualified for the semi
finals by trouncing Phi Kappa Psi 20
to 9 in a fast tilt on Friday. The first
part of the fracas was closely contest
ed, and at half time the winners were
only three points ahead. But the big
guns of the Sigma Chi offense, Jou
jon-Roche and Ed Elliot, got going in
the second period and the victorious
outfit gradually pulled away to win
by a comfortable margin. Joujon-
Roche, by the way, was high point
man of the contest with 11 tallies.
Weaver stood out at forward for the
losers.
