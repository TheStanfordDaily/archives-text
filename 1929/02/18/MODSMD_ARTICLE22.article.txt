# What Is The Verdict?

Another heretic is on trial. Mary AY are Dennett, author of an educa
tional sex primer, "The Sex Side of Life," was arraigned last month in
the Brooklyn federal courtroom on a charge of having distributed obscene
literature through the mails. She still awaits the decision as to whether
the indictment will be brought before a trial jury, or be dropped.
Eleven years ago her article was published in the "Medical Review of
Reviews," and received a highly complimentary foreword from the
editor of the magazine as being sane, adequate, intelligent. Since that
time more than 400 clergymen, doctors, educators, and social workers
have endorsed Mrs. Dennett's article as praiseworthy.
Assistant United States Attorney Wilkinson felt differently about it.
Vehemently he condemned it in court as containing "nothing about the
flowers, the Saviour, about music, poetry, and literature." Mr. Wilkinson
felt it "the sober duty of this court to protect the young from the idea of
sex which pervades the world today."
Mr. Wilkinson said a great deal, in fact, about the necessity for such
suppression: he did not offer any substitute for the ignorance which he
evidently considers highly preferable to intelligent and scientific informa
tion like that compiled by Mrs. Dennett. He is one of the era which so
consistently left its daughters to learn the facts of sex after marriage, and
allowed its sons to experience adolescence without the scientific informa
tion they needed for rational understanding of themselves. Lack of
knowledge, or the misinformation gained from the ignorant, can dan
gerously distort this simple factor of existence.
What should be understood and regarded as a normal part of life
becomes a thing to be whispered about: a thing which carries a connota
tion of evil, and so can readily become a source of evil. When such
wisely presented and adequate information as that contained 111 Airs.
Dennett's pamphlet is included in each child's education simply as a
matter of course, we can expect such irregularities as Mr. Wilkinson
decries to become much less of a problem, and we can insure happier,
more normal lives for our children.
Let us not, in the twentieth century, burn as a heretic one who is
simply telling us the truth!
