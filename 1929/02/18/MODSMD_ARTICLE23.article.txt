# TOO MANY A'S, B'S GIVEN DURING 1928
## 
### 
Too many A's and B's are given
out by Stanford professors in propor
tion to the C's and D's, an article in
the latest faculty bulletin issued last
week reveals. The article contains a
table which shows the distribution of
the grades given out during the last
academic yearâ€”the autumn quarter,
1927; winter, spring, and summer
quarters, 1925.
The proportion of the A's and B's
is too large from the standpoint of the
Academic Council which strongly fa
vors the old 15-35-35-15 ratio plan.
The statistics show that during the
year in question 37,240 passing grades
were given, not including 4,223 marks
in courses that are graded in the
plus-minus style. Of these 37,246
grades, 19.3 per cent were A's; 40.1,
B's; 32.5, C's; and 8.1, D's.
