The Doctor's Secret. Paramount Talk
ing Picture. New Stanford Theatre.
Palo Alto is brought close to Broad
way by "The Doctor's Secret," excel
lent sound picture presentation of Sir
James Barrie's drama, "Half an
Hour," now showing at the New Stan
ford Theatre.
Close to Broadway, because through
the medium of the sound picture Palo
Alto has the privilege of witnessing
a Barrie drama cast with such finished
players as Ruth Chatterton, H. B.
Warner, and Robert Edeson.
""The Doctor's Secret" carries a plot
full of tense situations, every scene
building to a climax which you can
not foresee until the play is ended.
Ruth Chatterton, as Lady Lillian Car
son, driven to desperation by her hus
band's mental cruelty, takes your
sympathy. And if you saw H. B. War
ner in "Sorrell and Son" you will be
amazed at his completely different
work as Richard Carson. Here he is
the exact opposite of Sorrell —merci-
less, domineering—and he does it ex
cellently.
Small Nanci Price, as Susie, steals
the show for a short time. She is a
clever little actress. All the principals
do their parts so naturally that you
feel that, in watching them, you are
eavesdropping. And each of them, par
ticularly Robert Edeson as Dr. Brody,
has a voice well-suited to sound pic
tures. Many female voices suffer in
this medium. Ruth Chatterton's does
not.
"The Doctor's Secret" illustrates
two outstanding advantages which
sound pictures enjoy over the legiti
mate stage—the use of many and di
versified scenes, and an effect of in
timacy. This latter, the intimacy with
the audience possible in close-up talk
ing picture scenes, is something which
audiences must learn to appreciate.
The talking parts are just talking
shorts, but the feature is worth flunk
ing a quiz to see. By W. N.
The Decameron. By Bocaccio. (New
York: Liveright, $3.50.)
This book, which has long been a
sharp thorn in the side of the vice
suppressers, is now available in the
handsome dress of the Black and Gold
Library.
The delightful introduction by the
late Sir Walter Raleigh, reprinted
from "Some Authors," almost makes
me think that I should enjoy the
Decameron more than I do, but the
truth of the matter is that I can read
only two or three of Boccaccio's tales
at a sitting. It is pleasant to have
them around, to pick up now and then,
but the very simplicity of the narra
tive method makes them soon get
montonous.
The Last of Free Africa. By Gordon
MacCreagh. (New York: The
Century Company. $4.)
By this time the world must be as
familiar to Gordon MacCreagh as his
own back yard is to a Peninsula com
muter. He has hauled teak out of the
Himalayan forests, caught animals

for Hagenbeck's zoo, served with the
Burma opium police on the Siam bor
der, explored Tibet and camped out
for eighteen months in South Ameri
can jungles.
Abyssinia was about the only spot
I remaining, so into the heart of the
ancient kingdom of Ethiopia he
irekked —with a wife, and twenty-odd
packing cases and a gay spirit of ad
venture. And it is with a blithe
hearted pen that he records his ex
periences.
Mr. MacCreagh is more intent upon
making a contribution to the reader's
entertainment than to his scientific
knowledge. Even so, he imparts a
good fund of first-hand information in
the course of these chapters and
brings that distant region of the
earth's surface vividly before one's
eye. And besides, his camera tells
much.
Struggle. The Life and Exploits of
Commander Richard E. Byrd. By
Charles J. V. Murphy. Foreword
by Edsel B. Ford. (New York:
Frederick A. Stokes Company.
$2.50.)
A heroic, admired figure standing
out vividly before the public eye, a
magnetic personality, a glamorous
career, a gallant ancestry — what
more could a biographer wish to in
spire his pen? Mr. Murphy, the au
thor, will perhaps be remembered as
the New York newspaper man who
flew to Greenely Island when, not so
long ago, three brave men, an Irish
man and two Germans, came to grief
there at the end of a westward At
lantic flight. He sent back stirring
stories of the scene and the experi
ence.
Mr. Murphy's book is colorful and
interesting. Its style shows that par
ticular sort of eloquence that news
paper feature writers are apt to de
velop though not unpleasantly in this
case. The book comes out at a timely
hour, when newspaper readers who
are not wholly without imagination,
are being thrilled by the wireless dis
patches from Antarctica and, as they
read, vision Byrd's figure against the
snowy wastes of "The bottom of the
world."
The biography has evidently been
made accurate by consultation with
| sources, and with people that could
j give authentic information. Mr. Mur
phy has endeavored to make it an
j all-round true picture of the man,
mentally, spiritually, and physically.
J He brings out with considerable skill
the many-sidedness of Byrd's endow
ment —its many contradictory phases,
; such as his devotion to philosophy
i and his love of adventure —and he
j gives vitality to the narrative with a
' thousand little anecdotes.
The story of the Commander's fore
bears adds interest, and helps to ex
plain his complex character. A full
; account is given of each of Byrd's
famous flights, and the chapters which
tell of his preparations for, and his
purpose in making the Antarctic ex
pedition are sufficiently detailed.

The Last of Free Africa. By Gordon
MacCreagh. (New York: The
Century Company. $4.)
By this time the world must be as
familiar to Gordon MacCreagh as his
own back yard is to a Peninsula com
muter. He has hauled teak out of the
Himalayan forests, caught animals

for Hagenbeck's zoo, served with the
Burma opium police on the Siam bor
der, explored Tibet and camped out
for eighteen months in South Ameri
can jungles.
Abyssinia was about the only spot
I remaining, so into the heart of the
ancient kingdom of Ethiopia he
irekked —with a wife, and twenty-odd
packing cases and a gay spirit of ad
venture. And it is with a blithe
hearted pen that he records his ex
periences.
Mr. MacCreagh is more intent upon
making a contribution to the reader's
entertainment than to his scientific
knowledge. Even so, he imparts a
good fund of first-hand information in
the course of these chapters and
brings that distant region of the
earth's surface vividly before one's
eye. And besides, his camera tells
much.
Struggle. The Life and Exploits of
Commander Richard E. Byrd. By
Charles J. V. Murphy. Foreword
by Edsel B. Ford. (New York:
Frederick A. Stokes Company.
$2.50.)
A heroic, admired figure standing
out vividly before the public eye, a
magnetic personality, a glamorous
career, a gallant ancestry — what
more could a biographer wish to in
spire his pen? Mr. Murphy, the au
thor, will perhaps be remembered as
the New York newspaper man who
flew to Greenely Island when, not so
long ago, three brave men, an Irish
man and two Germans, came to grief
there at the end of a westward At
lantic flight. He sent back stirring
stories of the scene and the experi
ence.
Mr. Murphy's book is colorful and
interesting. Its style shows that par
ticular sort of eloquence that news
paper feature writers are apt to de
velop though not unpleasantly in this
case. The book comes out at a timely
hour, when newspaper readers who
are not wholly without imagination,
are being thrilled by the wireless dis
patches from Antarctica and, as they
read, vision Byrd's figure against the
snowy wastes of "The bottom of the
world."
The biography has evidently been
made accurate by consultation with
| sources, and with people that could
j give authentic information. Mr. Mur
phy has endeavored to make it an
j all-round true picture of the man,
mentally, spiritually, and physically.
J He brings out with considerable skill
the many-sidedness of Byrd's endow
ment —its many contradictory phases,
; such as his devotion to philosophy
i and his love of adventure —and he
j gives vitality to the narrative with a
' thousand little anecdotes.
The story of the Commander's fore
bears adds interest, and helps to ex
plain his complex character. A full
; account is given of each of Byrd's
famous flights, and the chapters which
tell of his preparations for, and his
purpose in making the Antarctic ex
pedition are sufficiently detailed.

The Doctor's Secret. Paramount Talk
ing Picture. New Stanford Theatre.
Palo Alto is brought close to Broad
way by "The Doctor's Secret," excel
lent sound picture presentation of Sir
James Barrie's drama, "Half an
Hour," now showing at the New Stan
ford Theatre.
Close to Broadway, because through
the medium of the sound picture Palo
Alto has the privilege of witnessing
a Barrie drama cast with such finished
players as Ruth Chatterton, H. B.
Warner, and Robert Edeson.
""The Doctor's Secret" carries a plot
full of tense situations, every scene
building to a climax which you can
not foresee until the play is ended.
Ruth Chatterton, as Lady Lillian Car
son, driven to desperation by her hus
band's mental cruelty, takes your
sympathy. And if you saw H. B. War
ner in "Sorrell and Son" you will be
amazed at his completely different
work as Richard Carson. Here he is
the exact opposite of Sorrell —merci-
less, domineering—and he does it ex
cellently.
Small Nanci Price, as Susie, steals
the show for a short time. She is a
clever little actress. All the principals
do their parts so naturally that you
feel that, in watching them, you are
eavesdropping. And each of them, par
ticularly Robert Edeson as Dr. Brody,
has a voice well-suited to sound pic
tures. Many female voices suffer in
this medium. Ruth Chatterton's does
not.
"The Doctor's Secret" illustrates
two outstanding advantages which
sound pictures enjoy over the legiti
mate stage—the use of many and di
versified scenes, and an effect of in
timacy. This latter, the intimacy with
the audience possible in close-up talk
ing picture scenes, is something which
audiences must learn to appreciate.
The talking parts are just talking
shorts, but the feature is worth flunk
ing a quiz to see. By W. N.
The Decameron. By Bocaccio. (New
York: Liveright, $3.50.)
This book, which has long been a
sharp thorn in the side of the vice
suppressers, is now available in the
handsome dress of the Black and Gold
Library.
The delightful introduction by the
late Sir Walter Raleigh, reprinted
from "Some Authors," almost makes
me think that I should enjoy the
Decameron more than I do, but the
truth of the matter is that I can read
only two or three of Boccaccio's tales
at a sitting. It is pleasant to have
them around, to pick up now and then,
but the very simplicity of the narra

The Doctor's Secret. Paramount Talk
ing Picture. New Stanford Theatre.
Palo Alto is brought close to Broad
way by "The Doctor's Secret," excel
lent sound picture presentation of Sir
James Barrie's drama, "Half an
Hour," now showing at the New Stan
ford Theatre.
Close to Broadway, because through
the medium of the sound picture Palo
Alto has the privilege of witnessing
a Barrie drama cast with such finished
players as Ruth Chatterton, H. B.
Warner, and Robert Edeson.
""The Doctor's Secret" carries a plot
full of tense situations, every scene
building to a climax which you can
not foresee until the play is ended.
Ruth Chatterton, as Lady Lillian Car
son, driven to desperation by her hus
band's mental cruelty, takes your
sympathy. And if you saw H. B. War
ner in "Sorrell and Son" you will be
amazed at his completely different
work as Richard Carson. Here he is
the exact opposite of Sorrell —merci-
less, domineering—and he does it ex
cellently.
Small Nanci Price, as Susie, steals
the show for a short time. She is a
clever little actress. All the principals
do their parts so naturally that you
feel that, in watching them, you are
eavesdropping. And each of them, par
ticularly Robert Edeson as Dr. Brody,
has a voice well-suited to sound pic
tures. Many female voices suffer in
this medium. Ruth Chatterton's does
not.
"The Doctor's Secret" illustrates
two outstanding advantages which
sound pictures enjoy over the legiti
mate stage—the use of many and di
versified scenes, and an effect of in
timacy. This latter, the intimacy with
the audience possible in close-up talk
ing picture scenes, is something which
audiences must learn to appreciate.
The talking parts are just talking
shorts, but the feature is worth flunk
ing a quiz to see. By W. N.
The Decameron. By Bocaccio. (New
York: Liveright, $3.50.)
This book, which has long been a
sharp thorn in the side of the vice
suppressers, is now available in the
handsome dress of the Black and Gold
Library.
The delightful introduction by the
late Sir Walter Raleigh, reprinted
from "Some Authors," almost makes
me think that I should enjoy the
Decameron more than I do, but the
truth of the matter is that I can read
only two or three of Boccaccio's tales
at a sitting. It is pleasant to have
them around, to pick up now and then,
but the very simplicity of the narra
tive method makes them soon get
montonous.
The Last of Free Africa. By Gordon
MacCreagh. (New York: The
Century Company. $4.)
By this time the world must be as
familiar to Gordon MacCreagh as his
own back yard is to a Peninsula com
muter. He has hauled teak out of the
Himalayan forests, caught animals

for Hagenbeck's zoo, served with the
Burma opium police on the Siam bor
der, explored Tibet and camped out
for eighteen months in South Ameri
can jungles.
Abyssinia was about the only spot
I remaining, so into the heart of the
ancient kingdom of Ethiopia he
irekked —with a wife, and twenty-odd
packing cases and a gay spirit of ad
venture. And it is with a blithe
hearted pen that he records his ex
periences.
Mr. MacCreagh is more intent upon
making a contribution to the reader's
entertainment than to his scientific
knowledge. Even so, he imparts a
good fund of first-hand information in
the course of these chapters and
brings that distant region of the
earth's surface vividly before one's
eye. And besides, his camera tells
much.
Struggle. The Life and Exploits of
Commander Richard E. Byrd. By
Charles J. V. Murphy. Foreword
by Edsel B. Ford. (New York:
Frederick A. Stokes Company.
$2.50.)
A heroic, admired figure standing
out vividly before the public eye, a
magnetic personality, a glamorous
career, a gallant ancestry — what
more could a biographer wish to in
spire his pen? Mr. Murphy, the au
thor, will perhaps be remembered as
the New York newspaper man who
flew to Greenely Island when, not so
long ago, three brave men, an Irish
man and two Germans, came to grief
there at the end of a westward At
lantic flight. He sent back stirring
stories of the scene and the experi
ence.
Mr. Murphy's book is colorful and
interesting. Its style shows that par
ticular sort of eloquence that news
paper feature writers are apt to de
velop though not unpleasantly in this
case. The book comes out at a timely
hour, when newspaper readers who
are not wholly without imagination,
are being thrilled by the wireless dis
patches from Antarctica and, as they
read, vision Byrd's figure against the
snowy wastes of "The bottom of the
world."
The biography has evidently been
made accurate by consultation with
| sources, and with people that could
j give authentic information. Mr. Mur
phy has endeavored to make it an
j all-round true picture of the man,
mentally, spiritually, and physically.

ing a quiz to see. By W. N.
The Decameron. By Bocaccio. (New
York: Liveright, $3.50.)
This book, which has long been a
sharp thorn in the side of the vice
suppressers, is now available in the
handsome dress of the Black and Gold
Library.
The delightful introduction by the
late Sir Walter Raleigh, reprinted
from "Some Authors," almost makes
me think that I should enjoy the
Decameron more than I do, but the
truth of the matter is that I can read
only two or three of Boccaccio's tales
at a sitting. It is pleasant to have
them around, to pick up now and then,
but the very simplicity of the narra
tive method makes them soon get
montonous.
The Last of Free Africa. By Gordon
MacCreagh. (New York: The
Century Company. $4.)
By this time the world must be as
familiar to Gordon MacCreagh as his
own back yard is to a Peninsula com
muter. He has hauled teak out of the
Himalayan forests, caught animals

for Hagenbeck's zoo, served with the
Burma opium police on the Siam bor
der, explored Tibet and camped out
for eighteen months in South Ameri
can jungles.
Abyssinia was about the only spot
I remaining, so into the heart of the
ancient kingdom of Ethiopia he
irekked —with a wife, and twenty-odd
packing cases and a gay spirit of ad
venture. And it is with a blithe
hearted pen that he records his ex
periences.
Mr. MacCreagh is more intent upon
making a contribution to the reader's
entertainment than to his scientific
knowledge. Even so, he imparts a
good fund of first-hand information in
the course of these chapters and
brings that distant region of the
earth's surface vividly before one's
eye. And besides, his camera tells
much.
Struggle. The Life and Exploits of
Commander Richard E. Byrd. By
Charles J. V. Murphy. Foreword
by Edsel B. Ford. (New York:
Frederick A. Stokes Company.
$2.50.)
A heroic, admired figure standing
out vividly before the public eye, a
magnetic personality, a glamorous
career, a gallant ancestry — what
more could a biographer wish to in
spire his pen? Mr. Murphy, the au
thor, will perhaps be remembered as
the New York newspaper man who
flew to Greenely Island when, not so
long ago, three brave men, an Irish
man and two Germans, came to grief
there at the end of a westward At
lantic flight. He sent back stirring
stories of the scene and the experi
ence.
Mr. Murphy's book is colorful and
interesting. Its style shows that par
ticular sort of eloquence that news
paper feature writers are apt to de
velop though not unpleasantly in this
case. The book comes out at a timely
hour, when newspaper readers who
are not wholly without imagination,
are being thrilled by the wireless dis
patches from Antarctica and, as they
read, vision Byrd's figure against the
snowy wastes of "The bottom of the
world."
The biography has evidently been
made accurate by consultation with
| sources, and with people that could
j give authentic information. Mr. Mur
phy has endeavored to make it an
j all-round true picture of the man,
mentally, spiritually, and physically.
J He brings out with considerable skill
the many-sidedness of Byrd's endow
ment —its many contradictory phases,
; such as his devotion to philosophy
i and his love of adventure —and he
j gives vitality to the narrative with a
' thousand little anecdotes.
The story of the Commander's fore
bears adds interest, and helps to ex
plain his complex character. A full
; account is given of each of Byrd's
famous flights, and the chapters which
tell of his preparations for, and his
purpose in making the Antarctic ex
pedition are sufficiently detailed.
