# STANLEY MULLIN TO TAKE LEADING ROLE IN "THE WILD DUCK"
## Kathleen Fitz to Make Last Appearance in Campus Play as "Hedvig" 
### 
Stanley Mullin, who was taking the
minor part of Molvik, a student of
theology, in "The Wild Duck," has
been changed to play one of the leads,
Gregers Werle, originally assigned to
llenry Haussamen. Because of many
other activities, Haussamen was com
pelled to drop from the play, and Mul
lin, who made his first campus suc
cess in "John Ferguson" two years
ago, is taking his place.
All the other leads of the cast of
the Ibsen drama, which will be pre
sented in the Assembly Hall March 1,
have appeared in other campus pro
ductions. Kathleen Fitz, who will play
the part of Hedvig, the heroine, has
taken part in almost every musical
show for the last few years, and also
played in "The Romantic Young Lady"
and the "Book of Charm." "The Wild
Duck" will hark Miss Fitz's last ap
pearance on the Stanford stage, with
the exception of the benefit vaudeville
to be presented in April by the three
dramatic societies.
Henry Is Cast
Tom Henry, who plays the male
lead, Hialmar, also took the leading
role in "The Haunted House," the
lust sophomore play. This will be his
first venture in a more serious part.
Robert Catlicart, as Werle, the
wealthy merchant and manufacturer,
took an important part last year in
"Caesar and Cleopatra."
Old Eckdal, Hialmar's father, will
be interpreted by Burnell Gould, who
made his first campus success last
quarter as the faint-hearted detective
in "The Haunted House." Jeanette
Owens, playing the role of Mrs.
Sorely, is already familiar to Stan
ford audiences by her work in last
year's Junior Opera and "Caesar and
Cleopatra."
With only two weeks remaining
until "The Wild Duck" will be pre
sented, Gordon Davis is rehearsing
the cast daily in order to bring it to
as well-finished a production as "What
Every Woman Knows." Work on the
two sets is progressing under the di
rection of Harold Helvenston, who
hopes to better his scenic success in
the Barrie play.
