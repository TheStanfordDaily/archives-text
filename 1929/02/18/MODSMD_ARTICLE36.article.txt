## 
### MARTHA JUDSON 
The Symphony No. 8 in B minor
("Unfinished"), most exquisite and
melodious of Schubert's works, will
form the featured part of the
dance to be presented March 12 in
the Assembly Hall. The study of the
symphony and its interpretation
through the medium of the dance is
the work of Helen Stewart Cramer's
Dance Composition Class.
Work on the symphony provides the
class with the most stimulating and
difficult problem of using the dance
as a pure form of art without resort
ing to the aid of an encumbering
story. Strict attention is being paid
to the detailed structure of the music.
The main and subordinate themes,
and the intricate interweaving of one
rhythmic pattern witli another will be
represented by the dancers in terms
of abstract movement.
Use of concerted group movements
and the massing of figures, with an
occasional solo figure projected
against a group background, forms
spatial designs of ever-changing pro
portions. On this principle the dancers
hope to evolve a symphony of motion
in harmony with the symphony of
tones, phrases, motives, and melodies
created by Schubert.
