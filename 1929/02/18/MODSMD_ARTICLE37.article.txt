squad, Stanford's varsity fencing team
was defeated by the Olympic Club
foilsmen at Encina Gym Friday eve
ning by a score of six bouts to two.
The meet was held to decide the
' championship for three-man teams in

I Fencers' League of America.
The University of California, the
| Olympic Club, the U.5.1.V., and Stan
ford entered teams in the tournament.
' In the preliminary round, the Olym
pic Club defeated California 5 to 4,
and Stanford won from U.S.I.V. 6
1 to 3. In the finals, Adams, the only
Stanford fencer who could win from
the Winged O men, defeated both
Leicester and Smith of the Club. The
! meet was decided before Adams and
I Raymond could fence their bout.
| Entered as a substitute for Von
{Arnold, Raymond proved the high
point man of the meet, winning five
bouts and losing none for the Club.
Adams led the Stanford fencers with
four wins and one defeat. Taft was
j substituted for Snyder after the lat
ter had sustained an injury to a hand
j that was broken some time ago. Sny

. bouts, then changed to left for two
more.
I Practically all of the bouts lost by
the Stanford fencers were decided by
close scores, and their showing is con
sidered very good against the team
â– of former champions that represents
I the Olympic Club.
