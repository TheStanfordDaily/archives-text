# Hoover Returns To Capital Home For Inauguration
## President-Elect to Stay in Comparative Seclusion For Two Weeks 
### 
MIAMI BEACH, Fla., Feb. 17. (£>)—
President-elect Hoover spent liis last
night tonight at No. 8 Belle Isle be
fore starting back to Washington for
his inauguration March 4.
Accompanied by Mrs. Hoover and
a party of nearly 50, he will leave
Miami at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow on a
special train which will make only
necessary operating stops en route.
Invitations for the Chief Executive to
attend short demonstrations at Jack
sonville and other cities have been
declined.
Arriving at Washington at 1:30
p.m., Tuesday, Mr. Hoover will go
direct to his "S" Street home to re
main in comparative seclusion until
he sets forth two weeks from tomor
row for the Capitol to take the oath
of office as the thirty-first president
of the United States.
One conjecture is that the next
President is having difficulties in se
lecting his cabinet. This may be pre
dicted upon the extraordinary success
Mr. Hoover has had in keeping the
names of his official family secret.
Down to date even the wisest of the
dopesters will bank on only two men,
Andrew W. Mellon and Henry L.
Stimson.
Some friends of Mr. Hoover assert
that be has his cabinet slate complete
now and that its announcement, to
come in the form of nominations to a
special session of the Senate on
March 4, will cause a considerable
amount of surprise alike to the poli
ticians and the country.
