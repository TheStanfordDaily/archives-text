# SPORTS OF 1929
## "Worters â€” Everywhere!" 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
The diminutive goalie of the reju
venated New York Americans hockey
club is one of those small fellows
who succeed in sports in spite of
their size. Like John Ross Roach, of
the Rangers, Roy Worters is a Little
Giant, and some of the shots he stops
with a flick of his stick or wrist would
take the feet out from under a much
larger man who didn't know the
tricks of the trade as Worters does.
When the Americans finally did
land Worters (that sounds paradoxi
cal, that "land Worters") they re
ceived, from Bennie Leonard and his
Pittsburgh Pirates, the best goalie in
the National Hockey League. At the
end of each season the coaching
managers of the ten teams get to
gether and pick an All-Star team for
the season. Roy Worters "made" this
team in 1926-'27 and '27-'2B, which is
a wonderful tribute to his ability.
When the "Shrimp," as Worters is
called, finally landed in front of the
Americans' net he completed an eight
year cycle that first saw Worters,

, Conacher, and Burch as teammates
i with the Toronto Canoe Club's junior
i champs in 1920. The trio separated
and each covered a varied route
| through amateur and professional
ranks until a lapse of eight seasons
| finds them sharing lockers again in
| the same dressing room.
Let me finish by quoting a version
of the "Ancient Mariner" from Jack
| Filman's "Around the Circuit," in the
Madison Square Garden Hockey pro
! gram:
"Worters, Worters, everywhere,
And how the nets did shrink;
Worters, Worters, everywhere,
j And not a shot would sink."

The diminutive goalie of the reju
venated New York Americans hockey
club is one of those small fellows
who succeed in sports in spite of
their size. Like John Ross Roach, of
the Rangers, Roy Worters is a Little
Giant, and some of the shots he stops
with a flick of his stick or wrist would
take the feet out from under a much
larger man who didn't know the
tricks of the trade as Worters does.
When the Americans finally did
land Worters (that sounds paradoxi
cal, that "land Worters") they re
ceived, from Bennie Leonard and his
Pittsburgh Pirates, the best goalie in
the National Hockey League. At the
end of each season the coaching
managers of the ten teams get to
gether and pick an All-Star team for
the season. Roy Worters "made" this
team in 1926-'27 and '27-'2B, which is
a wonderful tribute to his ability.
When the "Shrimp," as Worters is
called, finally landed in front of the
Americans' net he completed an eight
year cycle that first saw Worters,

, Conacher, and Burch as teammates
i with the Toronto Canoe Club's junior
i champs in 1920. The trio separated
and each covered a varied route
| through amateur and professional
ranks until a lapse of eight seasons
| finds them sharing lockers again in
| the same dressing room.
Let me finish by quoting a version
of the "Ancient Mariner" from Jack
| Filman's "Around the Circuit," in the
Madison Square Garden Hockey pro
! gram:
"Worters, Worters, everywhere,
And how the nets did shrink;
Worters, Worters, everywhere,
j And not a shot would sink."
