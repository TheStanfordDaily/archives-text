# ARTIST'S VERSATILITY DISPLAYED IN DONNER EXHIBIT AT GALLERY
## Collection Includes Varied Painting Types; Shows Command of Color 
### 
Versatility is the key note of the
exhibition of thirty-five oil paintings
by Sara Kolb Donner now on display
at the Stanford Art Gallery.

There is an almost bewildering ar
ray of portraits, figures, marines, still '
life, and landscapes, both decorative 1
•dud realistic. Besides versatility of 1
subject matter, Mrs. Donner reveals f
a command of a large variety of color (
schemes. While possessing interest- '
ing and individual color schemes, (
most of the preceding exhibitions 1
have usod the samo one throughout. '
Mrs. Donner employs several differ- ! 1
ent color schemes to fit her different .'
subjects.
The geographical variety in her (
pictures is also striking. They com- (
prise fishing scenes and villages from
New England, paintings of the Pacific J '
Coast, of the Western desert lands, j 1
of tho missions, and even paintings , 1
of European scenes.
Versatility likewise stands out in '
ibe artist's treatment of her pictures, j 1
Some are modern, although none are '
-• extreme, and some are academic, and 1
from the old school. Most are done in 1
a delicate manner, but there are a (
i uumber that are more boldly ban- j
• died. 1 \
One of the most interesting of her '
• landscapes is the picture called "Old 1
. Marblehead." In this the buildings 1
are laid out like a little toy village, in ; i
quaint bright outlines, and the pat
tern marches the length of the pic
ture in an unusual and pleasing com
position.
Mrs. Donner's still life work is es- j
pocially worthy of study. In the room
oil the left are three pictures of con- 1
trasting brass, copper, and porcelain 1
pieces, so striking that the eye is '
caught at once. "Copper and Brass"
reveals the artist's skill in colors. It
, is a painting of a handsome copper 1 (
urn against a brass tray, with an i '
amazing little green cup in the fore- 1
ground that sets off the subdued, aris
tocratic tone of the picture and adds j 1
' spice and character.
Another still life, the "Little Red
Teacup," is remarkable for the sense
I ■
of texture that it shows in the con
trast between the soft, shimmering '
• blue of a silk drape above the hard, 1 (
polished brilliance of a walnut table. '
Vivid tones of blue and green and 1
lose are combined in these pictures | 1
with rich dark shades, producing an
: arresting effect of color and depth.

ing and individual color schemes, (
most of the preceding exhibitions 1
have usod the samo one throughout. '
Mrs. Donner employs several differ- ! 1
ent color schemes to fit her different .'
subjects.
The geographical variety in her (
pictures is also striking. They com- (
prise fishing scenes and villages from
New England, paintings of the Pacific J '
Coast, of the Western desert lands, j 1
of tho missions, and even paintings , 1
of European scenes.
Versatility likewise stands out in '
ibe artist's treatment of her pictures, j 1
Some are modern, although none are '
-• extreme, and some are academic, and 1
from the old school. Most are done in 1
a delicate manner, but there are a (
i uumber that are more boldly ban- j
• died. 1 \
One of the most interesting of her '
• landscapes is the picture called "Old 1
. Marblehead." In this the buildings 1
are laid out like a little toy village, in ; i
quaint bright outlines, and the pat
tern marches the length of the pic
ture in an unusual and pleasing com
position.
Mrs. Donner's still life work is es- j
pocially worthy of study. In the room
oil the left are three pictures of con- 1
trasting brass, copper, and porcelain 1
pieces, so striking that the eye is '
caught at once. "Copper and Brass"
reveals the artist's skill in colors. It
, is a painting of a handsome copper 1 (
urn against a brass tray, with an i '
amazing little green cup in the fore- 1
ground that sets off the subdued, aris
tocratic tone of the picture and adds j 1
' spice and character.
Another still life, the "Little Red
Teacup," is remarkable for the sense
I ■
of texture that it shows in the con
trast between the soft, shimmering '
• blue of a silk drape above the hard, 1 (
polished brilliance of a walnut table. '
Vivid tones of blue and green and 1
lose are combined in these pictures | 1
with rich dark shades, producing an
: arresting effect of color and depth.

Versatility is the key note of the
exhibition of thirty-five oil paintings
by Sara Kolb Donner now on display
at the Stanford Art Gallery.

There is an almost bewildering ar
ray of portraits, figures, marines, still '
life, and landscapes, both decorative 1
•dud realistic. Besides versatility of 1
subject matter, Mrs. Donner reveals f
