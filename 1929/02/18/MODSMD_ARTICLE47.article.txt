# PARKER PEN COMPANY USES WASP AIRPLANE FOR PUBLICITY WORK
## 
### 
Using an airplane painted the color
of their pens, the Parker Pen Com
pany of Janesville, Wisconsin, is
carrying out a novel advertising
scheme this winter at a number of
Eastern colleges. At each college sev
eral students are selected by drawing
lots, and are given free rides in the
plane. At Purdue University in Indi
ana, 1700 students registered for a
chance for a free ride.
The Parker plane was christened
"Parker Duofold" by Amelia Earhart.
It is a 410 h.p. Fairchild Wasp five
passenger cabin monoplane, capable
of flying with full load at an altitude
of 20,000 feet, and is able to climb
the first 10,000 feet in thirteen min
utes. It is equipped to operate from
small fields, having brakes on the
wheels for quick stops in landing.
Other features of the plane are the
quarter-million candlepower landing
lights, heated cabin, and many other
technical devices designed to aid safe
flying. Edgar La Parle, the pilot, has
over 3,000 flying hours to his credit,
a record equaled by few airmen in the
United States.
