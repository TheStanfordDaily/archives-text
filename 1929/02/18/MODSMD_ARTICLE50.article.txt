# MUYBRIDGE WILL BE SUBJECT OF MILES' LECTURE TOMORROW
## Work at Stanford Formed Background of Early Motion Pictures 
### 
W. R. Miles, Professor of Experi- j
I mental Psychology, will lecture on
' "The Story of Muybridge and His |
| Snapshots of Stanford Horses" Tues
day evening at 7:30 o'clock in the
j Assembly Hall.
Professor Miles proposes to review
' somewhat the quest which man has
i made for the recording of transitory 1
; motion, and to describe the efforts i
made in this line by Eadweard Muy
| bridge under the instigation of Sena- !
! tor Stanford. Muybridge was a well
known coast photographer whom Sen
ator Stanford obtained to help him
| get an objective record of the move
ments of his horses. This idea fos-1
! tered by Senator Stanford was the I
i foundation on which Muybridge's fu
ture was built. The photographs ta
ken here by him became the subject
of much conversation among scien
tific groups, and was the basis of
, scientific interest in a means of rep
resenting moving objects. The work i
done by Muybridge was the immedi
-1 ate background of the development of
moving pictures. Though the French 1
claim the distinction of having in
i vented the motion picture camera, no
â–  steps were taken in this direction un
i til correspondence was carried on
with those men working here in Palo
! Alto.
After working several years with
1 Senator Stanford, Muybridge contin
ued the same type of research in the
i University of Pennsylvania. Here he J
| was given all possible aid and certain 5
prominent Philadelphians became
j guarantors of the work.
Due to a misunderstanding between
Senator Stanford and Muybridge, j
1 none of Muybridge's material was left ;
in the museum. The University is j
now trying to gather material and to
; build up an exhibit in reference to
| this work.
