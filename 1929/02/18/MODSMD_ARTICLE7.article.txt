Eyes are turned on the Election Board and on the candidates
who are waiting for tomorrow's election. Mouths are indulging in
an insidious whispering campaign, spreading rumors, spreading
misinformation, spreading deliberate lies. In a statement made by
Dave Jacobson, published Friday, all the facts concerning Thurs
day's invalid election were aired with the exception of the man's
name for whom the spurious ballots were cast. Jacobson withheld
this name to protect that man. The man in question has requested
Jacobson to announce the name. The announcement follows:
The candidate for whom the thirty-three questioned
ballots were cast in Thursday's election has requested that
I make known his name to protect all the candidates running
in tomorrow's election. He is Herbert Wenig, candidate for
the presidency of the Junior Class. All the facts that I know
concerning the invalid election of last Thursday have now
been made public.
Dave Jacobson, Chairman of the Election Board.
Consider the evidence. Thirty-three ballots were found cast in
the wrong box in a stack like a pack of cards. They were marked
with the same peculiarly colored ink, in the same hand, for the
same candidate. From this evidence it was induced that the thirty
three ballots were cast by one person.
I Consider the possible motives behind the action. They are
three: to swing the election for the candidate for whom the ballots
were cast; to cast aspersion on the Election Board or the candi
date; to invalidate the election and cause a re-election.
The first possible motive is weak. The action was too obvious,
and further, it was done in the name of a man who had a lead over
his opponent in the first election.
That it was done to cast aspersion may be part of the third
motive. As it stands alone, it is not sufficient in itself to motivate
the act. Intense dislike would prompt the action, but it is to be
doubted that there is anyone holding strong enough dislike for the
candidate or the Election Board to do such a deed.
i The invalidation of the election to bring about a re-election;
this stands out as the strongest possible motive. This would amply
explain the obviousness of the action. It would raise it above the
pettiness on which action because of dislike would be based. The
individual or individuals who stuffed the ballot-box saw re-election
as the only chance to win for the man or men they backed by
further electioneering. By choosing a man in whom they were not
interested, the entire affair would point away from the candidate
for whom the tampering was done.
Be fair. Be honest in voting tomorrow. The man most involved
has made known his name. That he has done the right thing cannot
be denied. He has removed whispered rumors concerning for
whom the votes were cast. If public opinion doubts this indi
vidual's absolute honesty, public opinion is throwing mud on fair
ness itself. Vote as you voted before this affair broke. Be fair.

as the only chance to win for the man or men they backed by
further electioneering. By choosing a man in whom they were not
interested, the entire affair would point away from the candidate
for whom the tampering was done.
Be fair. Be honest in voting tomorrow. The man most involved
has made known his name. That he has done the right thing cannot
be denied. He has removed whispered rumors concerning for
whom the votes were cast. If public opinion doubts this indi
vidual's absolute honesty, public opinion is throwing mud on fair
ness itself. Vote as you voted before this affair broke. Be fair.
Eyes are turned on the Election Board and on the candidates
who are waiting for tomorrow's election. Mouths are indulging in
an insidious whispering campaign, spreading rumors, spreading
misinformation, spreading deliberate lies. In a statement made by
Dave Jacobson, published Friday, all the facts concerning Thurs
day's invalid election were aired with the exception of the man's
name for whom the spurious ballots were cast. Jacobson withheld
this name to protect that man. The man in question has requested
Jacobson to announce the name. The announcement follows:
The candidate for whom the thirty-three questioned
ballots were cast in Thursday's election has requested that
I make known his name to protect all the candidates running
in tomorrow's election. He is Herbert Wenig, candidate for
the presidency of the Junior Class. All the facts that I know
concerning the invalid election of last Thursday have now
been made public.
Dave Jacobson, Chairman of the Election Board.
Consider the evidence. Thirty-three ballots were found cast in
the wrong box in a stack like a pack of cards. They were marked
with the same peculiarly colored ink, in the same hand, for the
same candidate. From this evidence it was induced that the thirty
three ballots were cast by one person.
I Consider the possible motives behind the action. They are
three: to swing the election for the candidate for whom the ballots
were cast; to cast aspersion on the Election Board or the candi
date; to invalidate the election and cause a re-election.
The first possible motive is weak. The action was too obvious,
and further, it was done in the name of a man who had a lead over
his opponent in the first election.
That it was done to cast aspersion may be part of the third
motive. As it stands alone, it is not sufficient in itself to motivate
the act. Intense dislike would prompt the action, but it is to be
doubted that there is anyone holding strong enough dislike for the
candidate or the Election Board to do such a deed.
i The invalidation of the election to bring about a re-election;
this stands out as the strongest possible motive. This would amply
explain the obviousness of the action. It would raise it above the
pettiness on which action because of dislike would be based. The
individual or individuals who stuffed the ballot-box saw re-election
as the only chance to win for the man or men they backed by
further electioneering. By choosing a man in whom they were not
interested, the entire affair would point away from the candidate
for whom the tampering was done.
