# SANTA CLARA BEATS VARSITY BALL TEAM 11-9 IN WILD GAME
## Poor Control and 12 Walks Lose for Cards; Broncs Earn Only 5 Runs 
### DON OSWILL 
Poor control never won a ball
i game; although the Card batters
i found the Bronco pitchers for eleven
i safe blows, the Card chuckers were
unable to find the plate and walked
in enough men to let Santa Clara win
; Saturday by a score of 11 to 9. The
Broncs only earned five of their eleven
markers, and if the Stanford pitchers
| hadn't been so wild, it might have
| been a different story.
The Bronc moundsmen had seven
| walks chalked up against them before
I the contest was finished and these
accounted for four Stanford runs. Al-
I together there were nineteen passes
i issued during the contest.
The varsity started scoring in the
second inning, when Cook walked, was
i sacrificed to second by Johnson, and
singled home by Hardy. In the sev
i enth, Casanova filled the bases by
walking three men, and Johnson hit a
single through the left fielder's legs
that went for a home run. The Cards
scored two more in the eighth and
Iwo in the ninth.
Santa Clara's big inning was the
fourth, when they scored seven runs.
A double, a walk, and an infield hit
filled the bases. Taylor then walked
j Casanova to force in a run. Smalling
was sent in for Taylor and walked in
two more in rapid succession, and
then Owen singled to score two more.
Another walk and two bad throws ac
counted for an additional two runs,
| and Hunken ended the inning by mak
ing a beautiful catch of a foul fly. In
the third, Falk hit the ball a mile into
left field with one on, and the Broncs
scored again in the sixth.
