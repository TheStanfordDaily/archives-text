# FOOTBALL RULES ARE CHANGED AT ANNUAL MEETING
## Fumbled Balls Are Dead at Point of Recovery When Seized by Defensive Team Changes in Advancing Ball, Try for Points Following Touchdown, Screen Pass 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 18. (/P)—The Na
tional Football Rules Committee an
nounced today adoption of a new pro
vision which makes a fumbled ball re
< overed by the defensive side dead
at the point of recovery.
Possession of the ball under such
circumstances will still be lost by the
fumbling team.
This rule will not apply in case of
forward passes nor to backward
passes which are intercepted before
striking the ground, nor will it apply
to blocked kicks which will be played
as heretofore, it was emphasized.
Fumbled Kicks Treated
A second rule similarly barred the
door against some of the sad conse
quences of a fumbled kick, whereas
the rules of 1928 provided that when
a player fumbles in the act of receiv
ing a punt, the ball is dead at the
point of recovery by the opposing
team, the revised code lists all kinds
of booted balls in the same category
—kickoffs, placements, and drop kicks
as well as punts.
Uy a third rule, which came as a
complete surprise to most outsiders,
the position from which the try for
point after touchdown is to be made
was moved from the three- to the two
yard line in the hope that the try for
the extra point may more often con
stitute a triple threat play. A line
play or a pass may now be expected
as well as the conventional kick, in
the rule-makers' opinion.

Penalty for Passes

Deciding that restrictions upon the
use of the "screen-edge" forward pass
which were adopted in 1928 were not
sufficient, the committee's fourth de
cision amplifies the rule to provide
that no player of a side attempting
a forward pass "who has crossed the
line of scrimmage shall either before
or after the pass has been made in
terfere with an opponent until the
ball has been touched except in an
actual attempt to catch the ball. Ex
cept on passes completed behind the
line of scrimmage, such players as are
ineligible shall be penalized for inter
ference, if they in any way obstruct
the right of way of defensive players."
"In case of doubt as to such inter
ference," the rules adds parentheti
cally, "the penalty shall be inflicted."
