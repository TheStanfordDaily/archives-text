# ROOTERS' TICKETS FOR BEAR CONTEST GO ON SALE TODAY
## 
### 
Hooters' tickets for the third
game of the Stanford-California
basketball series will be on sale
in the A.S.S.U. offices from 9 to
12 and 1 to 5 o'clock today.
Tickets will be 50 cents each,
and one student may purchase
as many seats as he has student
body cards. After today the tick
ets will go on sale at one dollar
each.
The game, which will be played
in the Oakland Auditorium at 8
o'clock Saturday, will be the last
of the series, and the last game
of the year for the Stanford
team. Though California has al
ready won the Southern Division
championship, a hard-fought
game is predicted because of the
close battle between the two
teams here last week.
