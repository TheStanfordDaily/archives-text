Stars of Stanford's great varsity
track team, 1.C.4-A. champions in
1927 and 1928, stars of the present
freshman team, together with innu
merable other tracksters real and
would-be, will all be seen in action
this afternoon when the four classes
contend for supremacy in the annual
Irish Marathon and Interclass Track

per division, and all will be repre
sented in what promises to be one
of the most notable of Stanford inter
class meets. Admission of twenty-five
cents will be charged.
440 Is Close Contest
With such men as King, Dyer, Zom
bro, Nichols, Edmonds, Krenz, Roth
ert, and Morrison among the quali
fiers for today's finals in the inter
class meet, stiff competition should
develop in many events. The 440-yard
run and the sprints will be among the
most closely contested races, Morri
son and Shove opposing each other
in the former and Lauritzen and Dyer
meeting in the latter.
Sixty-seven men qualified Friday in
preliminary and semi-final heats for
today's finals, the sophomores leading
the list with nineteen qualified, the
freshmen having eighteen, the seniors
seventeen, and the juniors thirteen.
Some lively chickens and a healthy
porker have been secured for the
chicken and pig races. Last year Chris
Freeman, of football fame, captured
the greased pig with a flying tackle
after several unsuccessful attempts.

chase, a potato race, a three-legged
i race, and a bicycle race. Entrants in
j the bicycle race are asked to furnish
; tlieir own bicycles. Commercial prizes
j will be awarded in each of these
j events.
