# Student Government Is Challenged
## 
### 
Stanford goes to the polls this morning with the shadow of a political
scandal on the ballot box. That shadow, though it was caused by one
Student or a very few students, reflects on the entire student body.
Honor has been considered an indispensable part of Stanford charac
ter. Thursday's election cast a doubt as to whether, indispensable though
it is, honor is still to be found throughout the student body. Once done,
who knows that corrupt practice will not be repeated? lodays election
will be a challenge, every election from now on will be a challenge to
the integrity of the student body.
The ballot box tampering of Thursday is not in itself an infamous
crime, it does not jeopardize the welfare of Stanford, but aside from its
status of an unfortunate incident in long years of campus politics, it is
to be seen as a symptom, an indication of dishonesty in the student body
politic and an indication of weakness in student government.
All universities do not have student government. Stanford has. Let
Stanford value it as one of its finest institutions. Students, the citizens
of tomorrow, should be most zealous in keeping this, their first contact
and training in democratic government, clean, honest, and fair.
Democracy has been challenged and rightly. If in a selected com
munity such as Stanford, politics become corrupt it bodes evil for com
munities containing many citizens far less fortunate in opportunity and
endowment than university students.
Student government at Stanford is on the stand. the electorate
in today's election prove by its honesty and fairness that student govern
ment will and can remain an integral part of student life above the
muddiness of politics elsewhere.
