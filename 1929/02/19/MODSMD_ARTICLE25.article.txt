# Revise the Election System
## 
### 
The suggested revision of the election system, presented in yesterday's
Daily, will be proposed to the Executive Committee tonight. A howl of
criticism has already arisen at the mere suggestion of revision and greater
howls have been prompted by the proposed plan. It is to be expected.
Consideration of the facts proves that the present system is not satis
factory. It is both inadequate in frustrating the efforts of the dishonest
and inefficient in providing a method of vote registration.
Consideration of the suggested revision will temper the wrath of
those who would criticize. The proposed plan is based 011 the experience
of past elections. That it is the perfect solution cannot be said. It is
however a definite step toward attaining a pcrfect solution.
The new plan will prevent voting out of class, will prevent voting
more than once, and will prevent tampering such as occurred I hursday.
It provides a means of identification and so protects the voters, the elec
tion officials, and the candidates.
One suggestion might be made. The Executive Committee might
choose the Election Board in such a manner as to make it an honor to
belong. The task of being an election official is thankless. There is no
return for the hours of work and the grief attached to it. If it is made
a definite honor to belong, the best of the student body will seek member
ship, and in this way the high standard of the Board may be maintained.
Consider the proposed plan carefully, amend if necessary, and give
it a trial.
