# The 						Daily in Politics
## 
### 
Criticism has been made of yesterday's front page editorial titled, "Be
Fair!" It has been called prejudiced.
The Daily does not enter into the campaigns of individual candidates
in campus politics. It does not favor the collegiate Hall-Row factions so
proudly and loudly proclaimed by campus demagogues. It backs no
party, individual, or faction. It holds as its highest ideal, fairness, hon
esty, and justice in campus politics. Yesterday's editorial did not favor
one candidate over any other candidate. It did not cast aspersion. It was
written to defend the blameless by giving a thorough airing to the inci
dent. It aimed to be fair.
