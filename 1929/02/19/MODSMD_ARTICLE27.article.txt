# Suggestions Carried Out
## 
### 
The suggestion made in the Daily a short time ago to establish a
box at the Library for the return of books during closed hours will l)e
followed out. Assistant Librarian Charles V. Park assures us that the
plan will be tried and if it meets with student body approval will be con
tinued. The box will be open only during closed hours.
A second suggestion made through this column has born fruit. It
was suggested that the drawings of sets used in "What Every Woman
Knows" be returned. They have been returned.

The regular meeting of the editorial staff will be held at 1 o'clock
today after which the picture for the 1929 Quad will Ix: taken.
