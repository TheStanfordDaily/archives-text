## COMMON SENSE OR CRUISER CRAZINESS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Varying viewpoints as to present
day world affairs prevail among onr
poets and philosophers.
"The wondrous, wondrous age" of
radios and airplanes inspires one
class with hope. "A mad, mad, world, |
my masters" is the despairing wail of |
another, smitten by fear.
Both find ample justification in the
recent contradictory actions of our
leaders in international politics. With
one consent Europe and America sign
the permanent outlawry of War. |
Simultaneously proceed other man- j
dates for the expenditure of millions
of money for more and ever more, j
armed cruisers.
The man in the street finds diffi- j
culty in reconciling this contradictory ]
behavior of statesmen. Here are, for *
the world, speaking the same lan- J
guage, both professing the Christian (
religion, born of the same kin, com- j
mercially interdependent, neighbors j
with an undefended frontier of 3000 ;
miles, each led to believe that neces- i
sity compels them promptly to arm
against each other.
Exactly why, no one appears to

i know. "Ostensibly an unsettled squab
ble of a century as to the "Freedom
: of the Seas" in time of War. But to
day, for countless reasons, Britain's
did song, "Rule Britannia!" is obso
lete. Most certainly the idea is pre- j
posterous that a nation of forty mil
lions should lay down regulations ad-,
I verse to the interests of a nation
three times as populous and resource
, ful.
Furthermore, it should certainly be
in the range of possibilities, as the
; chairman of our Naval Affairs Con
gressional Committee suggests, to
have a number of representative men
of each nation foregather and discuss |
the present status from a common j
J sense, busines point of view; and
; NOT from that of America's "Big i
! Navy" men and British Admirals. This \
: is the more imperative because Fear
now demands that each must be pre-,
j pared to fight, not only the navy of a :
! single nation, but a possible combina-
J tion of many. Can none of the world's
I statesmen suggest some saner solu
j tion? Can't we in this 20th century
demand to be ruled by common sense
rather than by this cruiser craziness?
