# WHO CASTS ASPERSION?

### 
The Editor, Sir: I
It has occurred to me that perhaps 1
there are one or two rather important
details that might have been over
looked in the "Be Fair" story in Mon
day's Daily. For instance, there is j
Mr. Jacobson's declaration that "all ,
the facts that I know concerning the
invalid election of last Thursday have I
now been made public." Of course, the ;
Chairman of the Election Board could J
scarcely be expected to know how
the thirty-three questionable ballots
came to be in the hands of some un-1
known individual. But I am inclined
to suspect that part of the Election
Board's duties consist in having fairly |
accurate information concerning the j
life history of each ballot. Am I not ;
correct in this assumption?

Then there is the case of the "three
possible motives behind the action."
I am wondering if perhaps there
might not be a fourth "possible mo
tive." (I merely ask for information.)
"The action," says the article, "was
too obvious. . . . That it was done
to cast aspersion may be part of the
third motive. . . . But it is to be
dcubted that there is anyone holding i
strong-enough dislike for the candi
date, etc." Is it not reasonable to j
suppose that the object of this action
could have been to create in the pub
lic mind an idea similar to the one
expressed above as the "third mo
tive"? Upon whom would the asper
sions be cast in such a case?
Respectfully,
Charles P. Fonda.
