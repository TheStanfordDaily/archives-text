# Development Of Motion Pictures Is Lecture Topic
## Professor Miles to Review Work with Stanford's Horses in Action 
### 
"The Story of Muybridge and His
Snapshots of Stanford Horses will be
the subject of the lecture to be given by
Professor W. R. Miles of the Psychol
ogy department at 7:30 o'clock tonight in
the Assembly Hall.
Professor Miles will review the history
of the search made by science for ways of
recording transitory motion, illustrating
the talk with slides. Senator Stanford's
love of horses was the cause of the re
search made by Muybridge, who was an
artistically inclined English photogra
pher. Stanford suggested the work in
an attempt to find a means of recording
the gaits of horses. Prior to his employ
ment by Stanford, Muybridge was appar
ently not interested in the development of
motion picture photography, for one hun
dred views taken by him in the early '70s
in Central America show no signs of any
attempt to catch arrested motion.
Work Recognized in Europe
At the International Exposition in
Paris in 1900, Professor Marey, a French
scientist in charge of the photography
exhibit, placed the Stanford-Muybridge
work second in the chronological order
of experiments in the motion picture field.
Senator Stanford is believed to have
spent nearly $40,000 in the experiments,
building a special track for the horses
back of the present site of Roble Hall,
and buying a battery of twenty cameras.
The pictures were taken by numbers of
cameras set in a row along the track and
snapped either mechanically or electri
cally.
Historical Data in England
Muybridge returned to England, and
on his death left the remainder of his
estate and his exhibits to the library at
Kingston-on-Thames near London. In the
South Kensington Museum in England,
the revolving disc is displayed with which
Muybridge showed Senator Stanford the
motion of the horses. The exhibit is
owned by an Englishman named Will
Day, who is unwilling to part with it.
The treatment of the lecture is entirely
historical, dealing with the material only
as it relates to the present science of mo
tion picture photography.

Muybridge showed Senator Stanford the
motion of the horses. The exhibit is
owned by an Englishman named Will
Day, who is unwilling to part with it.
The treatment of the lecture is entirely
historical, dealing with the material only
as it relates to the present science of mo
tion picture photography.
"The Story of Muybridge and His
Snapshots of Stanford Horses will be
the subject of the lecture to be given by
Professor W. R. Miles of the Psychol
ogy department at 7:30 o'clock tonight in
the Assembly Hall.
Professor Miles will review the history
of the search made by science for ways of
recording transitory motion, illustrating
the talk with slides. Senator Stanford's
love of horses was the cause of the re
search made by Muybridge, who was an
artistically inclined English photogra
pher. Stanford suggested the work in
an attempt to find a means of recording
the gaits of horses. Prior to his employ
ment by Stanford, Muybridge was appar
ently not interested in the development of
motion picture photography, for one hun
dred views taken by him in the early '70s
in Central America show no signs of any
attempt to catch arrested motion.
Work Recognized in Europe
At the International Exposition in
Paris in 1900, Professor Marey, a French
scientist in charge of the photography
exhibit, placed the Stanford-Muybridge
work second in the chronological order
of experiments in the motion picture field.
Senator Stanford is believed to have
spent nearly $40,000 in the experiments,
building a special track for the horses
back of the present site of Roble Hall,
and buying a battery of twenty cameras.
The pictures were taken by numbers of
cameras set in a row along the track and
snapped either mechanically or electri
cally.
Historical Data in England
Muybridge returned to England, and
on his death left the remainder of his
estate and his exhibits to the library at
Kingston-on-Thames near London. In the
South Kensington Museum in England,
the revolving disc is displayed with which
Muybridge showed Senator Stanford the
motion of the horses. The exhibit is
owned by an Englishman named Will
Day, who is unwilling to part with it.
The treatment of the lecture is entirely
historical, dealing with the material only
as it relates to the present science of mo
tion picture photography.
