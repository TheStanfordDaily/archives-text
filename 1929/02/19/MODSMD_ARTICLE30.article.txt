# SUPERCILIOUS SOPHOMORE IS BORED
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I note with interest in this morn- j
ing's paper an enthusiastic comment
on the new exhibits in the Stanford
Library, with the display of the works j
of Arthur Machen listed as one. But <
why, I ask you? If my memory play
me not false, those books have been
in the cases for so long a time that
the memory of man runneth not to
the contrary, that the Scripture may j
be fulfilled, "The same yesterday, to-1

I day, and forever."
I hereby suggest that no item he
I considered as news unless the event
I cited shall have taken place within
the six months preceding publication,
j also, that the Library take those
i Rlachen books and put them some
nlace, some place where they will not
intrude upon the delicate sensibilities
of whosoever may pass the display
cases in pursuit of learning.
Sincerely yours,
A somewhat bored subscriber.
