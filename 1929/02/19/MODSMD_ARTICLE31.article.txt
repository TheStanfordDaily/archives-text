The Silent House. Curran Theatre.
Stage dark, as you might expect; a
man skulking in the gloom; he finds
some papers—and at this moment a
sinister Chinaman leaps upon him,
chokes him to death swiftly and si
lently, and props him up in a secret
compartment of the fireplace. There,
you have the opening scene of "The
Silent House" at the Curran Theatre
Sunday night.
A blood-curdling melodrama, this
play is, rather than a conventional
mystery play; because the plot un
folds itself as the action progresses.
But there are plenty of the usual mys
tery play terror stunts —shrieks, pis
tol shots from secret panels, poison
vipers, a corpse tumbling onto the
stage, and slinking murderers.
Three of the four acts are good,
whole-hearted, goose-pimply terror
scenes, but the remaining act seems
to me to go beyond the realm of en
tertainment with its ghastly horror.
The hero and heroine are trapped in
a room into which poison gas is
hissing—gas that burns the eyes out
of the sockets, and eats the tongue
out of the mouth, and burns out the
hair by the roots. Of course, the trusty
Ho-Fang comes in at the crucial mo
nif nt; but he didn't come soon enough
to suit me.
"The Silent House" comes original
ly from London, where it had a year's
run, and many of the New York cast
are appearing in the San Francisco
production. From the success of the
play it would appear that audiences
relish incredibly fiendish horror. I
recommend that you see the play if
you can stand an act which surpasses
any nightmare you can possibly have
had.
The cast gives a very finished pro
duction in this melodrama that in
volves oriental craft and cunning with
$1,250,000 at stake. The money is hid
den in negotiable bonds in "the silent
house."
Harold de Becker plays Ho-Fang
who is the ever-present defender of
the hero; while Howard Lang is Dr.
Chan-Fu, the villain who wants the
money at any price. Both of these
men stand out in superb characteriza
tions of the typical stage Chinese.
They are oily-spoken, subtle, cruel,
and vindicative.
The one woman role is taken by

Dorothy Graw. She handles her part
as well as is possible in such things,
but a love theme always strikes me
as being inane and out-of-place in such
shuddery "meller-dramas."
An assinine comedy Briton is well
done by Gerald Oliver Smith. You will
breathe a sigh of relief every time he
appears, for you know the tension of
the play is going to be temporarily
lessened by some choice skittenish
buffoonery.
Butler Benson, in with the villain
ous gang of Dr. Clian-Fu but "playing
friendly" with the hero, presents a
most acceptable combination of com
edy and treachery.
The hero is played by Vernon Kelso,
who is sturdy and brave; but why
must the hero always be so blamed
foolhardy and dumb as to what is
going 011 around him?
Arthur Bowyer is a likeable old
lawyer; while Louis Tanno performs
cieditably as a tempestuous Spaniard.
This play is opening for a short en
gagement, and I recommend it if you
want to see a grueling melodrama
that begins with a man being choked
to death, ends with the villain being
stung by a viper, and has poison gas
and terrible torture in between.
