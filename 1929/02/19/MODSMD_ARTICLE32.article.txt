TODAY'S FROLIC

The Quadrangle Club will present its j
annual classic the Irish Marathon in the j
Stadium this afternoon. After much
scouting around we were unable to deter
mine just why the Irish had been picked
on, in naming this event.
Twenty-four men from each class par
ticipate in the race, so it is a common
sight to see a two-miler running a lap
against a dash man. Of course the best J
men are saved till the last .and usually
put on a good finish for the spectators.
Special Races
In addition to the regular marathon,
there will be, as usual, some special races
and chases. All the campus speed expo
nents have signed up for bicycle race and
are grooming their iron steed for a
merciless grilling this afternoon.
The steeplechase is also expected to
draw some of the more reckless into the
heat of competition. It will be an up
and down race with the participators
haiulicappcd by slimy pools and numerous
bunkers. A three legged race will also be
run, and of course anyone who has at
tended a Sunday-school picnic can realize
the excitement that will be afforded by
this event.
Another event full of heart throbs is
the potato race, the idea being to carry a
potato on a spoon for some hundred yards
where a relief man takes over the para
phernalia and returns to the spot marked
X.
Barnyard Frolic
Last and probably the most important
among the various chases is the barn
yard frolic, commonly known as the
chicken and pig chase. One pig and sev
eral chickens will be set loose while nu
merous entrants attempt to catch them.
The chickens afford the privilege of re
maining in their natural state, but the
lowly pig is "well oiled" before being set
loose, thereby making it extremely diffi- j
cult to capture him. Last year Chris I
Freeman, famed for his work on the j
gridiron, was responsible for the capture.
The year before it was Ted Shipkey,
Stanford's Ail-American end. Judging
by past performances pork is no match
for the tactics of a grid luminary. Watch
the Daily for today's winner.
