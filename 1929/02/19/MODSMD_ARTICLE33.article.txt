# WARREN D. ALLEN TO FEATURE SELECTIONS BY M. WIDOR TODAY
## 
### 
Widor will be featured by Warren
D. Allen, University organist, in his
program today at 4:15 o'clock in the
Memorial Church. The program is as
follows:
Piece heroique Cesar Franck
Cantilene from the "Roman Sym
phony"
Andante con moto from the
"Unfinished Symphony" Schubert
Angel Pantomime from "Hansel
and Gretel" Humperdinck
Marche Slave Tscliaidowsky :
Widor wrote ten "Symphonies" for
the organ of which the "Symphonic
Romane" is the latest. The delicate
tracery of the Cantilene is suggestive
of Wagner, and the symphony based
011 a Gregorian theme reveals the
flexibility and poesy to be found in
plain chant.
