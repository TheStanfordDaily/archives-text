# IRENE RICH MAKES STAGE DEBUT IN SKETCH BY HYLAND, A. R. ST. JOHNS
## 
### BEN MADDOX 
Making her stage debut in a dra
matic sketch by Dick Hyland and
Adela Rogers St. Johns at the San
Francisco Orpheum this week, Irene
Rich starts the second phase of her
acting career.
She recently broke her long-term
contract with Warner Brothers be
cause she was tired of reading the
critics' "Irene Rich splendid in an
other rotten picture." It took spunk
to voluntarily renounce a guaranteed
income of $275,000 for the next two
years, but Miss Rich thinks that two
more years of poor roles would have
seriously affected her stellar standing.
Will Storm Broadway
While Hollywood is experimenting
with the talkies, she is going to storm
Broadway. "Once you have estab
lished your reputation in the legiti
mate in New York you can go any
where and get the parts you want. I
always thought I couldn't remember
lines, but I find it's no trouble at all.
J'm doing this Orpheum act just to
get footlight experience. I've had
plenty of offers to go East, but I
don't want to do a full play until I
feel absolutely capable."
Miss Rich is my idea of a really
charming woman. She has talent, a
happy home, children. I have met few
Hollywood stars as beautiful and as
intelligent as she is.
Ten years ago she was the wife of
an army officer stationed at the San
Francisco Presidio. Left with two lit
tle girls to raise, she tried real estate
for five months and then decided to
try acting. It cost too much to take
her children and mother to New York,
so she moved them to Hollywood,
where she began as an extra in pic
tures.
Before the year was up she was
leading lady for Will Rogers in a
series of comedies. Waraer Brothers
signed her to a long-term contract.
And she has been with them until
the last few months. Her most not
able performances were in Mary
Pickford's "Rosita," Ernst Lubitsch's
"Lady Windermere's Fan" and Wil
liam de Mille's "Craig's Wife."
Has Daughter in College
It is almost impossible when look
ing at Miss Rich to realize that her
eldest daughter is eighteen years old
and a freshman at Smith College. I
imagine that Frances must have a
hard time keeping the boy friends'
attention when this fascinating moth-1
er is around.
Although she was getting a big pay-1
check, Miss Rich had no say whatever j
about the story, photography, cast, or j
director of her starring pictures for j
Warner Brothers. When they cast her

| in their experimental talkies, she de
! cided it was time to leave the fold.
! She has no objection to talking pic-
I tures, but she prefers to "let them
; try them out on someone else."
In person she is cultured and gra
j cious. The camera has not done jus
tice to her â€”she is a real beauty. It is 1
to be hoped that she will make the !
| desired hit on Broadway and then !
; hurry buck to Hollywood. Irene Rich
i has a lovely speaking voice, and an- I
other role like the one she had in
j "Lady Windermere's Fan" will give !
her premier ranking on the screen. |
