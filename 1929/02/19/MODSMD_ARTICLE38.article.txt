# SPORTS OF 1929
## Still Flashy 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
A versatile and ambidextrous guy
is Frankie Frisch, formerly of the
New York Giants and now of the St.
Louis Cardinals. A right-handed
pitcher is on the mound, Frankie
comes up smiling—and bats left
handed. Just like Babe Ruth. Well,
almost like him. A southpaw ambles
out to the old mole-hill to try to throw
them past the batters, and Frankie
comes up, still smiling—and bats
right-handed. Just like Rogers Horns
by. Well, almost like him, then.
Frank Francis Frisch is what is
known as a "turnover" hitter. That is
to say, he can bat from either side of
the plate, and does. Yessiree, his rec
ord of better than .300 for ten straight
j ears in the majors proves that he
can bat both ways. Others who can
also hit from either side of the plate
are Lu Blue, Dave Bancroft, Johnnie
Gooch, Mark Koenig, Wallie Schang,
Red Faber, Ted Lyons, and Herb Pen
r.ock.
As to the other proof of Mr. F. F.
F's versatility and ambidextrousness,

I he went to the Giants in 1919 from !
Fordham (where he was known as
"the Flash") as a second baseman and j
played both that position and short-!
, stop in fifty-four games. In 1920 he j
j played 120 games at third. He played
I second and third in '21 and '22, sec- i
ond the two following years and, in
1925 played second, third, and short! j
He omitted shortstop in '26, and con- |
| fined his efforts to second in 1927,
! i
; trying to fill Roger Hornsby's shoes — j
j and did so well that he established a
' new record for chances accepted.
It is said that Frisch will shift to (
: third base during the coming season.
