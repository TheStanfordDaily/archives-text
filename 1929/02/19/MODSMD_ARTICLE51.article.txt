# Dogs Kill Twenty Head Of Campus Cattle Herd
## 
### 
Bands of bloodthirsty dogs, roving !
through the hills back of the Univer- :
sity, have been responsible for the
death of more than twenty head of
cattle during the last few weeks.
A number of young cows have been i
fcuud near the stockyards torn to !
pieces by the ravenous canines.
Tenants occupying University land j
have announced to A. E. Roth, comp- !
troller, that a concerted drive will be 1
made this week in an attempt to ex
terminate the marauding beasts.
Residents owning dogs are urged to
keep them in leash during the coming |
week so that the animals will not be j
molested.
