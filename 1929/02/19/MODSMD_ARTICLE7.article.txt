# HOLT, PAINE ATTEND COMICS CONVENTION AT RENO TOMORROW
## College Humor's Relations With Student Magazines Is Leading Problem 
### 
Dick Holt, manager, and Bob Paine,
one of the managing editors of the
Chaparral, will leave the campus to
night to attend the annual convention
of the Western Association of College
Comics at Reno, Nevada. The con
vention will be held from February
20 to 23 inclusive under the auspices
of the University of Nevada "Desert
Wolf." Due to the inability of Jack
Shoup, editor of the Chaparral, to at
tend the convention, the three manag
ing editors, Paine, Esberg, and Carter
drew straws, and Paine was selected
to substitute for Shoup.
Fifteen college comics will be repre
sented at the convention. Discussion
will involve College Humor problems,
national advertising agencies, and the
election of new members. The dele
gates will also consider plans of a
national association and a national
magazine.
The most important problem is
that concerning the relations of the
association with College Humor. Last
year relations were broken, but the
California Pelican has recently signed
a reprint-rights contract with College
Humor. The association feels that
College Humor incorrectly depicts
college life and has led advertising
agencies to believe that the maga
zine reaches the college market more
widely than college comics. College
Humor has also made statistics con
cerning its college circulation which
the association considers clearly false.
To clarify its relations to College
Humor, the convention will discuss
plans of publishing a booklet con
taining its policies regarding College
Humor.
