### STEPHEN DIETRICH 
In a hectic free-for-all fracas that i
I required two extra periods of play to ,
| decide the outcome, Kappa Alpha
nosed out Encina 4W Independents
last night at the Pavilion to enter .
the mural basketball finals. Davis j
| sneaked in the winning basket in the !
, last minute of the second period, and j
| a few seconds later Goldie cinched j
I the game with a long shot from the j
| center of the court.
Both quintets were missing easy ,
' set-ups last night, and at half time
\ the score was only 5 to 3 in favor of
I the hall outfit. The K.A.'s made good
i a desperate last-minute rally and at
l the end of the regular session the
i score stood tied at 9-all. Each squad
put up a strong defense, and this was
largely responsible for the low score, j
Long High Scorer
Davis tipped in a sucker shot in the
| first extra period, but Mott came right
i back to knot up the count again when
he dribbled down the court and looped I
in a pretty bucket. Long, at forward |
! for Kappa Alpha, was high-scorer of !
| the contest with 9 points. Mott played
' a good floor game for Encina, besides
; scoring 7 tallies for his team.
Sigma Chi had a good workout in
: the first game of the evening and
neatly drubbed Breakers by a lop
| sided score. The fraternity boys just
I couldn't miss their shots last night
and ran up a big score before their
opponents got going.
Sigma Chi Rushes
The winners started out with a rush
and scored 6 points before the Break
ers knew what it was all about.
Joujon-lloche shot a long one in the
I i first minute, Nye followed with a
nice sideline basket, and Ed Elliot
i tipped one in from under the goal. At
' half time the row squad was out in
; front, by a 15 to 9 score.
Joujon-Roche played a flashy floor
game for Sigma Chi and was high
point man of the tilt with 11 markers.
Elliott starred at center for the win
n'ng team, besides sinking four pretty
j field goals. J. Cook and Goldsmith
'were outstanding for the losers.
