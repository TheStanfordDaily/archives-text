## Marathon Win Cinches Meet; Sophomores Finish Second; Track Causes Slow Times Edmonds Wins Pole Vault at 13 Feet, 6 Inches; Greased Porker Is Nabbed by Lewis 
### BY FRANK WHITELEY 
Eric Krenz, national intercollegiate
shot and discus champion, was in
great form yesterday and, with two
exceptionally fine performances in the
weights, furnished what there was of
Ihe spectacular in the annual Inter
class Track and Field Meet in the
Stadium. The Stockton giant heaved
the shot 49 ft. 8y 2 in. and a few min
utes later tossed the discus 156 ft.
1 in.
The Stadium track was soft, be
cause of recent work and lack of rain,
and the times made were in the main
mediocre, with the exception of
Johnny Morrison's 49 3-5 s. lap in the
Irish Marathon. Hec Dyer, sophomore
sprint flash, came through in good
style to take the 100 and 220, winning
the former in 10 flat and the latter in
22 2-5 s. He was closely pressed in
Loth races by John Lauritzen.
Seniors Win Marathon
The Class of '29 with a victory in
the marathon to bring its point total
to 05 clinched the interclass cham
pionship, the sophomores finishing
second with points, the juniors
third with and the freshmen last
with 17!/£.
Ward Edmonds, varsity pole vaulter
who has recently taken up hurdling
as a sideline, was a double winner,
going over the high sticks in 15 4-5 s.
and vaulting 13 ft. G in.. Smith, sopho
more timber-topper who was supposed
to furnish Edmonds with most of the
competition in the hurdles, kicked one
over at the start of the race and was
forced to take a third, trailing Ed
monds and Clarence West. Smith
came back in the lows to win from
Mendenlmll, freshman, in the fair
time of 25 3-5 s.
Broadjumping Trio
Coach Dink Templeton again has a
trio of broadjumpers who can do
twenty-three feet or better, perform
iinces in yesterday's meet indicate.
West, sophomore, leaped 23 ft. 3 in.
for first plac; Dowell, junior, 23 ft.
for second; and Zombro 22 ft. 9 in.
for third.
Perelli-Minetti's throw of 186 ft. 4
in. in the javelin was noteworthy.
All of the distance runs were close
ly contested, but the times were slow.
After having held the lead for most
oi the race, the sophomores lost it to
the' seniors in the twenty-second lap
of the Irish Marathon when Edmonds
passed Neikirk, '31, running the quar
ter-mile in 51 4-5 s. McKinnon and
Syer, running last for the class of
'29, were able to hold this lead and
win the 24-lap marathon. The juniors
were third and the freshmen fourth.
Lewis Spears Pig
Spud Lewis, one of Pop Warner's
football proteges, captured the greased
pig with a beautiful flying tackle. Cap
tain-elect Mush Muller was successful

in the chicken chase, although he had
to chase it half-way up one side of
the Stadium.
