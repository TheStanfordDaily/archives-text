Eric Krenz, national intercollegiate
shot and discus champion, was in
great form yesterday and, with two
exceptionally fine performances in the
weights, furnished what there was of
Ihe spectacular in the annual Inter
class Track and Field Meet in the
Stadium. The Stockton giant heaved
the shot 49 ft. 8y 2 in. and a few min

and the times made were in the main
mediocre, with the exception of
Johnny Morrison's 49 3-5 s. lap in the
Irish Marathon. Hec Dyer, sophomore
sprint flash, came through in good
style to take the 100 and 220, winning
the former in 10 flat and the latter in
22 2-5 s. He was closely pressed in
Loth races by John Lauritzen.
