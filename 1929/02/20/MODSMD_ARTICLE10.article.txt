## 
### 
When the campus "Foreign Legion"
mobilizes in the Pavilion by order of
Scabbard and Blade on Friday night,
March 8, it will dance to music fur
nished by Bob Beale's Athens Club
ten-piece orchestra. For couples ar
riving before 9:30 o'clock, a five-piece
campus band will be playing. Both
orchestras will play within a cano
pied recess designed to act as a sound
ing board and to enhance (he volume
and quality of the music.
An innovation in Pavilion dances
will be the decoration of the entrance
hall as well as the main ballroom. In
addition to the usual decorations, in
tiie colors of the French Foreign Le
gion, red and blue, a number of panels
painted to represent desert scenes
will hang from the walls.
A small number of bids are still on
sale at the A.S.S.U. offices in the Old
Union.
