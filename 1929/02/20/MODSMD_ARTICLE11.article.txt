BERKELEY, Feb. 19. (Special)
â€”Running up a score of 48-19,
the University of Oregon swim
mers trounced the University of
California paddlers here tonight.
The Bears were able to win first
places in only two events.

University of Oregon Webfooters
will have full opportunity to demon
strate their natatorial ability when
(he barnstorming swimming squad of
the northern institution meets Coach
Ernie Brandsten's Stanford varsity in
Encina Pool at 2:30 o'clock today.
Although led by such stars as
Johnny Anderson and Charlie Ander
son, both Northwestern champions,
the Oregon squad is expected to be
easy prey for the Cardinal team.
Northwestern University had little
trouble defeating Oregon 31-26 but
the Purple team barely nosed out
Stanford 34-33.
Two Pacific Coast Conference rec
ords are in danger of being toppled.
Wliitey Burns, sophomore breast
stroke sensation, is expected to lower
his own mark in the "frog paddle"
event. Captain Ogden Driggs is fa
vored by Brandsten to lower the time
in the 150-yard backstroke race.
The 50-yard free-style sprint with
Reggie Harrison and Johnny Ander
son entered should prove the closest
race of the day. Both these men de
feated Covode of Northwestern by the
same margin. These men will meet
again in the 100-yard race.
Had Bramel should defeat Silver
man in the 440-yard swim. The Ore
gon mermen finished behind both
Northwestern swimmers in that event,
while Bramel easily beat those same
Northwestern men in Encina pool.
Barret Brown will desert the back
stroke race to be Bramel's teammate
in the 440 today. Sandy Smith, with
Captain Driggs, will swim for Stan
ford in the dorsal event. Allen is Ore
gon's best man in this race.
Eddie Throndson, fresh from his
victory over Wally Colbath, National
Intercollegiate Champion, should have
things his own way in the diving con
test. After his performance against
Colbath, Throndson is to be rated as
one of the finest divers in the country.
Women will be admitted to the
meet.
