# Reminiscences Of Editor White Related By University Professor
## 
### JOE GORDON 
"He was a fine fellow to go camp
ing and fishing with but he wasn't the
best fisherman of the bunch," Profes-1
j sor Franklin of the Chemistry depart
ment relates in speaking of William
Allen White, American author and
journalist of note, who is to speak
here this morning.
Professor Franklin and White were
classmates in the latter years of the
1880's at the University of Kansas and
were both members of Phi Delta
Theta fraternity.
Franklin tells of a summer spent,
in and around Estes Park in Colorado
with White, Vernon Kellogg, who is
a former Stanford professor and is
' now permanent secretary of the Na
tional Research Council, Herbert Hart
ley, who is now Chancellor of Wash
| ington University, his brother, W. S.
Franklin, who is now professor of
Physics at the Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, and several other
men who have since reached promi
nent. positions in the business anil
political worlds.

| "We spent the whole summer camp
ing out, hiking and fishing, taking
turns cooking, and having a good time
in general," Franklin reminisces. "We
; caught and ate over 6000 trout, be
-11 ween us. We killed two deer and also
broke the law by killing four Rocky
Mountain sheep, but we didn't know
it was against the law at the time.
White was not as energetic as most
of us but that was probably because
he had considerably more weight to
pack around with him on the hikes
than we did.
j "In school White was a 'bear' for
journalism, not only working on the
j college paper but also working as a
i reporter on the city newspaper. He
was an ideal fraternity brother and
classmate.
"While my brother and I were try
ing to decide whether to take up
journalism or the teaching profes
sion as our life work," Franklin con
cluded, "White was all set on a jour
nalistic career, and he prepared for
it and went into it with a force and
persistence that has carried him to
I the position that he holds today."
