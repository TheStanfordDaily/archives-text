"The work done in Palo Alto by
j Eadweard Muybridge was the imme
! diate background out of which the mo
j tion picture developed," stated Profes
; sor W. It. Miles of the Psychology de
! partment in his lecture last night on
I "The Story of Muybridge and His
! Snapshots of Stanford Horses."
Professor Miles reviewed the his
tory of the search made by science
for ways in which to record transi
tory motion, illustrating his talk with
slides of pictures taken by Muybridge.
"Primitive man first obtained the
idea of the possibility of a picture by
; the visual post-impression which is
j momentarily retained on the retina,
j Ever since, man has been trying to
i record motion as well as color and
' form and now we have nearly realized
this effort."
