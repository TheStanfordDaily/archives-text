# No Scandal This Time

### 
The second re-election for A.S.S.U. and class officers was carried
through without a flaw. Few elections have been as closely contested as
this: one and three votes deciding two contests. The superficial partisan
ship that has been very noticeable in past elections was largely disre
garded.
Stanford can hold a clean election, and furthermore Stanford, if this
election is significant at all, is moving away from the Hall-Row align
ments so dear to the heart of two-penny demagogues.
The Election Board under the direction of Dave Jacobson did an
excellent job. The system developed for temporary use enabled a perfect
check to be made. Jacobson and his crew deserve highest praise for their
unflagging efforts and effectual accomplishment in putting the election
through, fairly and honestly.
