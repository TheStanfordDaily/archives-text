# A 						Wise Motion
## 
### 
By moving to try the new election system, proposed last night by the
chairman of the Election Board, the Executive Committee has taken a
wise step toward eliminating the evils likely to occur in campus elections.
Able critic Norman, of Bullsession fame, suggests that faculty mem
bers supervise elections. The Daily suggests that Martians be employed
to supervise national, state, and local elections in order that unbiased,
impersonal, totally detached supervision of highest efficiency may be guar
anteed. A splendid move toward furthering student government Mr.
Norman.
The electorate, the election officials, the candidates have a just right
to the maximum of protection from the crooked politician. The new sys
tem has been weighed in the light of past experience. It has been as
sailed from every possible angle to ferret out its weaknesses. It stands
so far invulnerable. It stands in theory. The trial it will receive in spring
election may substantiate Mr. Norman's request for efficient faculty as
sistance, and again it may prove its worth and justify the existence of

student government,
