# "THAT MAN WHITE"
## 
### 
"A number of Progressives at Lakin, more kind than considerate,
yesterday resoluted in favor of this man White, of Emporia, for governor.
They wanted him to run as a Progressive candidate. 1 o which the Ga
zette says no—a thousand times 110. For we are on to that man White,
and without wishing to speak disrespectfully of a fellow townsman, who,
so far as we know, may be at least outwardly decent in the simpler rela
tions of life—perhaps he pays his debts when it is convenient, and he
may be kind to his family, though that's not to his credit, for who
wouldn't be —and he may have kept out of jail, one way or another, for
some time; without, as we say, desiring to speak disrespectfully of this
man, we know that he's not the man either to run for governor or, if such
a grotesque thing could be imagined, to serve as governor.
"He can't make a speech. He has a lot of radical convictions which
he sometimes comes into the Gazette office and exploits, and which are
dangerous. He has been jawling politicians for twenty years until he is
a common scold, and he has set up his so-called ideals so high that the
Angel Gabriel himself couldn't give the performance that this man White
would have to advertise on the bills.

"So, in the words of the poet, nix on Willyum Allen. The Gazette's
nose is hard and cold on the proposition to make him governor. He is a
four-flusher, a ring-tailed, rip-snorting hell-raiser, and a grandstander.
He makes a big noise. He yips and kyoodles around a good deal, but he
is everlastingly and pre-eminently N.G. as gubernatorial timber —full of
knots, warts, woodpecker holes, and rotten spots. Ile would have the
enmity of more men who have walked the plank politically than any other
man in Kansas, and his candidacy would issue an irrevocable charter in
Kansas for the Progressive party to be the official minority report world
without end. Men and women would be trampled to death at seven
o'clock election morning, trying to get at the polls to cast the first vote
against him, and at night perfectly good citizens, kind fathers and indul
gent husbands, would risk a jail sentence to get in at least ten votes against
him as repeaters. It may be that the Progressive party needs a goat, but
the demand doesn't require a I>illy-goat! Now is the time for all good
men to come to the aid of the party. But this man White is a shoulder
galled, sore-backed, ham-strung, wind-broken, string-halted, stump-suck
ing old stager who, in addition to being 110 good for draft and general
purposes, has the political hots, blind-staggers, heaves, pink eye and epi
zootic. Moreover, he is locoed and has other defects.

"People in the state may be fooled by the doped gait and fancy steps
of this man White, but we know him. J f he is a candidate for governor
or for any other office, we propose to tell the truth about him—how he
robbed the county with a padded printing bill, how he offered to trade
off his support to a congressman for a government building, how lie has
blackmailed good citizens, and has run a bulldozing, disreputable news
paper jn this town for twenty years, atid has grafted off business men,
and sold fake mining stock, and advocated anarchy and assassination.
These arc but a few preliminary things that occur to us as the moment
passes. But if his fool friends insist on playing up this self-advertising
game for him any longer, we propose to abandon twenty years of guarded
innuendo and prattling subterfuge, and come out with the real facts. We
shall speak plainly hereafter.
"A word to the wise should gather 110 moss!"
