# The 						Bullsession
## BEST LAID PLANS 
### 
The proposed new Bertillon system
for making A.S.S.U. voting foolproof
(granting that such a thing is pos
sible) is all right as systems go. We
refer to the plan to cross-check sig
natures mado on Registration Day
with signatures made at voting time,
by means of an elaborate filing ar
rangement.
On the other hand, it is just an
other system, its chief difference be
ing that it would be more ornate than
some others we might dish up. Its
chief point of similarity to other sys
tems is, of course, that it would not
be foolproof.
Ho hum. It looks as if a few more
by-laws will be shoved into an A.S.S.U.
constitution which is already so im
mense and unwieldy that only Profes
sor Cathcart can hope to understand
it. After which, we venture to pre
dict, election fiascos or such jokes as
the ballot-stuffing trick played on the
Election Board last Thursday will
crop up as usual now and then.
We say "as usual," since fiascos
have occurred before. They appear to
be an institution in this institution.
Last year a gentleman who, an elec
tion official, was an excellent yell
leader, managed to gum the works on
one election by absent-mindedly leav
ing the campus on a visit.
Two or three years ago, in the race
between two candidates for student
body presidency, four recounts were
held. One recount would give A the
victory by a healthy majority; the
next would indicate B elected by an
equally healthy majority; and so on

until, when the fourth recount was
declared final for no particular rea
son, the candidate who happened to
be leading in that recount got the job.
As the old saying goes, history keeps
bobbing up.
We also have a suggestion for con
ducting A.S.S.U. elections: Why not
persuade a few kind members of the
faculty, perhaps recruited especially
from the mathematics and law depart
ments, to devote a few hours three
times a year to handling voting and
counting? They could no doubt per
form the task without difficulty, and
this would obviate possibility of criti
cism resulting from student control
of voting. We undergraduates seem to
have a difficult time getting anybody
elected.
On the other hand, there is nothing
like a good fiasco to add a little live
liness to the otherwise dull ceremony
of elections. For this and other rea
sons, we don't propose our own plan
with any particular vehemence. In
fact, we are like most folks hereabouts
—unable to get excited about who
gets elected to what.
Campus politics are a yawn. Take
the most important political jobs at
Stanford, add them together and mul
tiply by three, and they still don't
amount to a kettle of overripe fish.
In addition to starting a reform
movement, the practical joker who
stuffed the ballot box last Thursday
did us another big favor: he furnished
the only recent bit of scandal we have
had up to now during a school year
disgustingly skinny on scandals.

We say "as usual," since fiascos
have occurred before. They appear to
be an institution in this institution.
Last year a gentleman who, an elec
tion official, was an excellent yell
leader, managed to gum the works on
one election by absent-mindedly leav
ing the campus on a visit.
Two or three years ago, in the race
between two candidates for student
body presidency, four recounts were
held. One recount would give A the
victory by a healthy majority; the
next would indicate B elected by an
equally healthy majority; and so on

until, when the fourth recount was
declared final for no particular rea
son, the candidate who happened to
be leading in that recount got the job.
As the old saying goes, history keeps
bobbing up.
We also have a suggestion for con
ducting A.S.S.U. elections: Why not
persuade a few kind members of the
faculty, perhaps recruited especially
from the mathematics and law depart
ments, to devote a few hours three
times a year to handling voting and
counting? They could no doubt per
form the task without difficulty, and
this would obviate possibility of criti
cism resulting from student control
of voting. We undergraduates seem to
have a difficult time getting anybody
elected.
On the other hand, there is nothing
like a good fiasco to add a little live
liness to the otherwise dull ceremony
of elections. For this and other rea
sons, we don't propose our own plan
with any particular vehemence. In
fact, we are like most folks hereabouts
—unable to get excited about who
gets elected to what.
Campus politics are a yawn. Take
the most important political jobs at
Stanford, add them together and mul
tiply by three, and they still don't
amount to a kettle of overripe fish.
In addition to starting a reform
movement, the practical joker who
stuffed the ballot box last Thursday
did us another big favor: he furnished
the only recent bit of scandal we have
had up to now during a school year
disgustingly skinny on scandals.
—Winston Norman.
The proposed new Bertillon system
for making A.S.S.U. voting foolproof
(granting that such a thing is pos
sible) is all right as systems go. We
refer to the plan to cross-check sig
natures mado on Registration Day
with signatures made at voting time,
by means of an elaborate filing ar
rangement.
On the other hand, it is just an
other system, its chief difference be
ing that it would be more ornate than
some others we might dish up. Its
chief point of similarity to other sys
tems is, of course, that it would not
be foolproof.
Ho hum. It looks as if a few more
by-laws will be shoved into an A.S.S.U.
constitution which is already so im
mense and unwieldy that only Profes
sor Cathcart can hope to understand
it. After which, we venture to pre
dict, election fiascos or such jokes as
the ballot-stuffing trick played on the
Election Board last Thursday will
crop up as usual now and then.
