The 19th Hole. Columbia Theatre

Was it beginner's luck, or was it
an inborn proficiency at the game that
caused gentle, unassuming little Ver
non Chase to execute a drive of 150
yards the first time in his life that
he held a golf club in his hands?
At any rate his entire life, his en
tire character was changed from that
moment, as his wife learns to her sor
row. Golf seems to have this power
over men —just how great a power
is riotously shown in Frank Craven's
domestic comedy hit, "The Nineteenth
Hole," now in its opening week at the
Columbia Theatre in San Francisco.
Frank Craven himself has the lead.
He is magnificent. Even if the play
itself were heavy or slow —and it is
quite the opposite—such a perform
ance as he gave on the opening night
would have made it a hit. His mere
presence on the stage assured a
laugh. As Vernon Chase, he takes
the part of a sweet scholarly little
man, appealing that stained glass win
dows and writing articles no longer
have any charms for him, but who
on occasion reveals surprising back
bone.

Of course the play has the biggest
laugh for golf fans. A golf enthusiast,
Frank Craven takes advantages of his
thorough knowledge of the game to
bring out to the fullest its humorous
aspects. But the comedy is so natural
and direct and spontaneously infec
tious that those who have never
played golf will be as helpless with
laughter as the others.

The comedy does not depend on
fast clever lines for its effect. It is
not subtle or sophisticated, and there
is not a suggestive line in the entire
play—it's not needed. The humor lies
in the character and situations, and
it is a very real and delightful humor.

At times the action sags a little,
especially in the earlier scenes. Then
Frank Craven appears—and just like
a contagion, every line seems ten
times as funny. The second act is the
best, with the scene in the locker
room at the Harmony Country Club,
where the amiable little Vernon
drinks his first high-ball. But there
are high spots all the way through.
There is a superb scene between
Chase and the rotund, perspiring
George Gill, played by Harmon Brown,
in which not a word is spoken for
several seconds. Everything lies in
the expression on the two faces —the
eyes, the mouths, the gestures. It is
a difficult scene, perfectly done, and
the effect is almost too overwhelming
ly funny.
Dorothy Blackburn, in the rather
difficult role of the unsympathetic
wife, is mediocre. Rea Martin makes
a vivid and likeable modern American
sport girl, and manages in a some
what inconsequential part to add color
to the play. The rest of the cast is
consistently good. However there is
never any doubt at any point that it
is Frank Craven who "makes" the
play. —Mary Lee Richmond.

Point Counter Point. By Adous Hux
ley. (New York: Doubleday Doran.)

The number of different opinoins
concerninß "Point Counter Point" is
probably equal to the number of its
readers. Everyone will have his own
reaction, hfs own verdict, and no two
of these will be alike. An inexperi

eneed reviewer is bound to get into
deep water over such a novel, for it
is one of the3e books about which peo
ple immediately form very firm and
definite judgments, and resent any in
truding criticisms.

One person will find the book en
thralling and magnificent, another will
say "rot," and a third will declare he
was merely bored by it.

To begin with, Huxley has a tre
mendous brain —or else he is a super
latively good bluffer. His apparent
familiarity with every angle of art,
science, politics, society, and econo
mics as revealed in his complex diag
nosis is nothing less than overwhelm
ing.
This background should make any
thing that Huxley has to say worth
a great deal. That is why the bitter
ness in "Point Counter Point." its
savage condemnation of the habits of
the modern world, have such a de
pressing effect. When an intellectual
giant sees only futility and rottenness
in the lives and characters of the so
called upper class of social London,
it looks pretty bad.

The technique employed by Mr.
Huxley is unusual. He disregards plot
construction altogether, and with
superb indifference to all rules, as
sembles a literal horde of characters,
throws certain groups of them to
a cruel and vicious selfishness.

The book Is too long, it does not
have a logical progression, and the
characters seem detached and pur
poseless. The total effect is distinctly
unsatisfying. The reader is repulsed
by its ruthlessness. A woman com
mits suicide —a man is murdered —
mere incidents. Yet there are passages
of undeniably powerful writing.
Whether these are worth the raw, dis
agreeable parts is a difficult question.
