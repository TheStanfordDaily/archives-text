# William Allen White To Address Assembly At 10 O'Clock Today
## 
### 
William Allen White, world-famed
journalist and author, will address
the student body in a regular Uni
versity assembly this morning at 10
o'clock. All classes at that hour will
be excused.
If Stanford welcomes White as en
thusiastically as the University of
California did Monday the assembly
hall should be filled to capacity. In
his speech at California he kept bis
audience in a constant state of mirth
by his pointed digs at modern politics
and his witfy summaries of political
events during the past 40 years, more
than living up to bis reputation as a
clever and humorous as well as inter
esting speaker.
White began his career as editor of
a little country newspaper, the Em
poria Gazette, of Emporia, Kansas.
He soon made this paper famous and
though it still remains small it has
become a model paper for the entire
country.
White, however, has not confined all
his time to journalism. He has been
active in politics especially during re
cent years. He took a leading part in
the Prohibition controversy during the
recent presidential campaign and par
ticipated in an open-letter debate with

I Governor Alfred E. Smith.
During the war he was sent to
France by the American Red Cross
and did valuable work for that or
ganization. He is a trustee of the
Rockefeller Foundation and of the
Emporia College Board, and since
15)25 has been a member of the Insti
tute of Pacific: Relations.
White is also an author of note. His
book, A Certain Rich Man, was one
of the best-sellers in 1909. Some of
; his other works since then are: The
Old Order Changeth (1910), God's
Puppets (1916), In the Heart of a
Fool (1918), The Martial Adventures
of Henry and Me (1918), Life of
Woodrow Wilson (1924), Life of Cal
vin Coolidge (1925), and, just recent
ly, Masks and the Pageant.
He has been in great demand all
over the country as a lecturer during
recent years; at present he is engaged
in delivering the lectures for the Earl
J Foundation of the Pacific School of
Religion in Berkeley.
1 Because of his urgent business en
gagements Mr. White will only be on
the campus a short time today but
j expects to return later and spend a
few days visiting with an old class
! mate, Professor E. C. Franklin, of the
Chemistry department.
