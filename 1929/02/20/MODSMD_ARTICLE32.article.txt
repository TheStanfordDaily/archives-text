## 
### 
The second all-University assembly
I to be held within a week's time will
take place next Monday, when all the
11 o'clock classes will be excused to
allow students to hear G. D. Cunning
ham, England's foremost concert or
ganist, give a recital in the Memorial
Church.
Cunningham is making his first tour
of the United States under the auspi
ces of the National Association of

Organists and he is making it in the
short space of two months' time. He
is city organist of Birmingham, Eng
land, and also organist of the Univer
sity of Birmingham.
His concerts to date given in this
country have been received with en
thusiasm rarely accorded a foreign
organist and his visit to the Pacific
Coast is awaited with interest by
lovers of organ music.
Dead wood Dick, long-haired scout
of the Black Hills, and dime novel
hero, celebrated his 82nd birthday on
November 5 with an airplane ride.
