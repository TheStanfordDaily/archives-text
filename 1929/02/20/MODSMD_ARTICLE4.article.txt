# CARDINAL BASEBALL TEAM MEETS GAEL OUTFIT HERE TODAY
## Doug Lewis Will Start On Mound for Stanford; Saints Are Strong 
### DON OSWILL 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
will meet the St. Mary's nine here this
afternoon at 3:15 o'clock on the local
diamond. This will be the first meet
ing of these two teams this season,
and the second game of the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Association.
The Gaels will bring a highly touted
outfit over to face the Cards today.
They are the only college team that
has beaten the strong Athens Club
nine, and they did that rather han
dily, letting the Clubmen off with two
hits and three runs*. Athens defeated
the Cards, but Stanford wasn't up to
usual form in that contest, and will
give the Saints plenty of trouble to
morrow.
Doug Lewis will probably be Coach
Harry Wolter's choice to start in the
tiox for the Redshirts. Lewis is the
calmest of all the Stanford chuckers,
and Wolter should not have to worry
about his blowing up. Spud Hardy
will be on the receiving end.
If anyone has been showing up well
on the varsity diamond, it is Bill Laird.
Laird has been Vhe most consistent
infielder as well as the leading hitter
on the team. Hunken and Wilton have
been performing nicely in the outfield
and Harry Berg should be a good man
to fill out the combination. If Berg
plays outfield, the Cards will have a
hard-hitting outfit in the outfield.
The Stanford team has been hitting
well this year, but has been weak in
the pitching department during the
last two contests. The Cards gathered
eleven hits from Santa Clara last Sat
urday and would have won the game
if the pitchers could have found the
plate.
