# TRY YOUR EYES ON MISSPELLED WORDS
## 
### 
Have you seen the misspelled
i words? There are three of them in
J today's ads, and there's profit in it
for you if your optics can catch the
three words. Simply hand in the list
of words personally between the hours
! of nine and ten, Wednesday, at the
' business office of the Daily. The '
prizes are ducats to the New Stanford |
Theatre, the first two arrivals getting
passes for two, and the next three
single passes. Though the vitaphone
| may keep you from using your eyes
to read the titles, use them now and
j get to hear the vitaphone free.
