### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 19. (/p)â€”Fifty
persons were injured, four men and
! two women seriously and 200 passen
-1 gers were affected by smoke and
fumes tonight when fire broke out in
the first car of a New Jersey-bound
i seven car Hudson Tube train, 1,000
! feet west of the Christopher Street
: Station in Manhattan.
Panic-stricken passengers trampled
! one another in attempting to get off
i the stalled and smoke-filled train.
| Most of them reached the Christopher
1 Street Station through another train
that was joined to the rear of the
I stalled train.
j The train which caught fire was a
| local, bound for Journal Square, Jer
; sey City, N.J., and carried about 1000
| homeward-bound commuters.
A short circuit in the motor of the
first car caused the fire and smoke
j from burning insulation was mingled
in the air with fumes from the stor
l age batteries of the train.
When the passengers reached the
street their faces were blackened from
j the smoke and many were bruised and
bleeding from being trampled and
! struck.
Passengers said the air was stifling
in the first three cars and that many
of tliem received cuts in breaking win
j dows to permit the smoke and gases
: to escape.
Emergency stations were set up by
police in stores near the Christopher
: Street Station and the least seriously
! injured were treated there.
A large crowd was attracted by
| word of the accident and police es-
I tablished lines to keep them back
j from the tunnel entrance.
Power was turned off in the tubes
I when word of the fire was received
I and several other trains were stalled.
The passengers from one twin were
led to the street through an emer
! gency exit at Ninth street.
