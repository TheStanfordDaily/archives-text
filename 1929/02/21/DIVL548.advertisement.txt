Young ladies who delight in the unusual, who have that
happy faculty of wearing the novel without being bizarre —
will find much interest in the exceedingly clever woven footwear
which we are showing for Spring.
Some come from France, some from Czecho-Slovakia, some
from Austria, and others —sport oxfords with woven vamps —
are made right at home. All have decidedly different weaves
and color combinations from those you have seen before.
Quite the right thing to accent the contrasting shade of your
Spring sport costume are the Ankle Sox, which come in New
colors, New fancy cuff designs, New solid tone pastel shades,
and New prices.
The Sox from 35c up
--
The Shoes from $7.59 up \\
