Dear Sirs:
I have used one small box of your
extra High Grade Plug Slice Tobacco,
and as I have had twenty-seven years
of experience as a tobacco user, I find
your High Grade Edgeworth to be
superior to all others.
There is extra enjoyment in the use
of it, which I will make known to my
friends and continue the pleasure
myself.
Yours,
(Signed) P. F. Green
