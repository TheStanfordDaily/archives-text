# CARD CAGERS HIT STRIDE FOR LAST CALIFORNIA GAME
## Husky Hunt's Quintet Shows Its Best Basket-Tossing of Year in Practice Sessions Reynolds, Tyler Are Injured But Probably Will Play in Part of Contest Saturday 
### ANSON REEDER 
Displaying the best basketshooting
ol the year in its practice sessions,
the Card cage team, in the belief of
Coach Husky Hunt, is really set for
its third go of the Big Series, which
is scheduled for Saturday night at 8
o'clock on the Oakland Auditorium
court.
Nibs Price, California's diminutive
coach, realizes that the game will be
no set-up as the Cards will be anxious
to spoil the record njade by the Bears
so far this season. As a result he is
putting his first team into the field.
Stevens, California forward, who was j
high-point man in the first game of j
the Big Series, according to an article I
which recently appeared in the Daily
Californian, has not been the same
man since he ran into Captain Roth
ert. in the second court battle held
here two weeks ago. However, with
this exception, the Bear squad seems
to be in good shape.
The Cards, except for Mike Rey
nolds, guard, who injured his knee
ten days ago, and Don Tyler, forward, |
who hurt his wrist recently, are also j
set for the contest. Both Reynolds and J
Tyler will probably play part of the j
Kame dspite their injuries, which do |
not seem to bother them a great deal. |
Coach Husky Hunt announced yes- j
terday that he would probably start J
McCandless at center, with Captain
Rothert and Tampcke at guards. Tyler j
and Fawcett will probably be the '
starters at the two forward positions i
although Phil Moffatt, who has de
veloped into the squad's "dead-eye"
lately, may replace Tyler when the
game is called.
The Cards have developed an air
tight defense, and whether they show
the improvement in attack that is ex-!
ported of them, depends a great deal .
on Vance Fawcett, who is the key
man to the Redshirts' offense.
Probable line-up:
Stanford— California —
Fawcett F Stevens j
Tyler F Ten Eyck j
McCandless C Corbin (C) |
Tampcke G Coakley
Rothert (C) G Gregory
