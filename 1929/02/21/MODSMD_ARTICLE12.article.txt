# SPECIAL SESSION IS DISCUSSED BY HERBERT HOOVER
## April 15 Is Set as Tentative Date for Meet; Walsh Report Attacked 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 20. (JP)â€”'The
I return of President-elect Hoover today
diverted attention to a large extent
Irom the present Congress and turned
j it toward the special session which
j Mr. Hoover has promised to call to
deal with the tariff and farm relief
issues.
The date for the extra session fig
ured in the discussions Mr. Hoover
had with Congressional leaders at his
home. Chairman Hawley of the House
] Ways and Means Committee, said his
j committee would be unable to com
j plete the tariff bill it is working on
i before April 10. Inasmuch as this bill
will be one of the two major questions
| to be decided it appeared that April
15 held good as the probable date of
the meeting.
With its session almost at an end.
the House set apart time today in
which to pay tribute to 11 members of
the House and Senate who have died
during the 70th Congress. Bills of
minor importance occupied it other
wise.
The Salt Creek oil leases furnished
the subject for debate in the Senate
where Senator Robinson, Republican,
Indiana, attacked the report of Sena
tor Walsh, Democrat, Montana, on the
subject. Walsh desires that the Lands j
committee censure Hubert Work, for- j
mer Secretary of the Interior, and
William J. Donovan, assistant to the j
Attorney General. Mr. Work renewed !
the contract with Harry F. Sinclair
for Salt Creek royalty oil. Walsh con- j
tends that Donovan delayed in hold- i
ing it invalid. Robinson said today
that the Salt Creek leases should be
investigated and charged the Govern- !
nient had been defrauded of hundreds j
of millions of dollars.
A move to obtain consideration of
the bill to reapportion the member
ship of the House was started by the
Senate. An agreement was reached to
have the measure taken up Monday
night.
A bill to authorize the creation of
a department of aeronautics was in
troduced by Representative McLeod, !
Republican, Michigan. The Michigan i
Representative said Colonel Charles j
A. Lindbergh undoubtedly would be i
a favorite choice with the people for i
the post of heading the department.
