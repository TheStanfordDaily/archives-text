# WHITE TALKS ON POLITICS IN ASSEMBLY
## Publisher Says That Hoover Regime Will Begin New Era of Prosperity 
### 
Tracing the changing tendencies of
politics from forty years ago to the
present day, William Allen White,
American journalist and publicist,
; *poke at one of the best-attended Uni
i versity assemblies of the year yester
day morning.
"I trust Herbert Hoover to carry
I the banner farther and higher and to
initiate a new era of prosperity. I am
looking forward with pleasure to
March 4," was the optimistic pro
phecy made by Mr. White in his clos
ing remarks.
White gave a rapid summary of the
political events of the last half cen
tury. Beginning with the era of "be
whiskered populism," the gold stand
ard and William Jennings Bryan, he
| then discussed the Spanish-American
War and Roosevelt, whom he charac
terized by saying that he took the
political principles of populism,
blended them with progressive ideas
i and then "after giving the whole thing
a Harvard accent," made them into
the Republican Party's platform.
Finally he touched on Harding's
regime and Coolidge's administration,
which he explained was "honest even
if it was dumb and dull."
White closed with an exhortation
to the new generation. "Hold fast to
! your visions. Believe what you be
lieve. It will not be what I believe
! but as God has given your dreams to
! you, stick by them. You are the torch
bearers. About all I've learned of life
is that every generation has its call
i and that, when it has lain down to
j sleep, if it has been brave and lion
! est, it has seen its dream come true."
| The concluding quotation of the lec-
I lure was from Browningâ€”"Life means
J intensely and means good. To find its
meaning is my life and drink."
Acting-president Robert E. Swain
| introduced the speaker. Mr. White
j was forced to leave the campus im
mediately to fill another engagement,
but said he would be back later to
spend a few days visiting his old
classmate, Professor E. C. Franklin
J of the Chemistry department.
