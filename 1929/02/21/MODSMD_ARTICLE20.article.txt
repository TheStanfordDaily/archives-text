# KAPPA ALPHA BEATS SIGMA CHI FIVE 12-9, TAKES MURAL TITLE
## 
### 
A hard-fighting Kappa Alpha quintet
upset the dope sheet last night at the
Pavilion when it beat out Sigma Chi
by a score of 12 to 0 to win the intra
mural basketball championship. By
taking yesterday's fracas the title
holders also gained permanent pos
session of the Hastings trophy. Kappa
Alpha won its first leg on the trophy,
a large silver-mounted basketball, last
year by nosing out Sigma Nu for the
mural hoop championship.
Sinking a foul shot in the last min
ute of play, Ed Goldie put the K.A.'s
out in the lead by a single point. A
few seconds later Dick Pease, lanky
forward on the winning squad, sank
a long goal to cinch the contest.
Sigma Chi got the ball at the next
tip-off and took a couple of desperate
"hope" shots from the center of the
court, but none of them connected
and the victors nonchalantly marched
out of the Pavilion with their shiny
silver trophy.
Neither team could find the basket
last night, and at half time the score
was only 4 to 3 in favor of Sigma
Chi. There was no scoring at all in
the first three or four minutes. Ed
Elliot, elongated center for the losers,
came through with the first score,
when he dribbled down the hardwood
and tipped in an easy shot from right
under the goal. Hall, chunky standing
guard, tied the count a minute later
with a nice shot from way out past
center. Klabau looped in another long
bucket just before the whistle blew
to give Sigma Chi a one-point lead as
the half ended.
The second period was a repetition
of the first, and was featured by out
standing guard work on both sides.
The score see-sawed back and forth
up to the very end, neither team ever
being more than a couple of points
ahead. Larsen, standing guard for
Sigma Chi, opened up the second half
with a set-up shot, but Davis came
right back and tossed in a field goal
to knot up the score again. Then
Goldie sank his free throw to give
Kappa Alpha its winning tally.
