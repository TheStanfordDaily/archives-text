# Hasten the New, Reinvigorate the Old

Stanford's War Memorial still hangs in the misty nothingness of
about-to-be, the country of things planned and not accomplished. One
hundred seventeen thousand and some odd dollars lies well fed and fat
tening on accruing interest. 1 his is the amount thus far accumulated for
the building of the memorial. Many have been the suggestions and plans
as to the fitting sort of memorial to be constructed. Arches, courts, halls,
trophy rooms, fountains, these are typical of some of the varied plans
laid for the memorial. And still nothing concrete has been done about it.
One hundred fifty thousand dollars was set as the quota to be procured
for the building. About 1922 the fund had reached one hundred three
thousand dollars. At this time the First Million and the Second Million
endowment plans were getting under way. A letter from Dr. Wilbur to
the chairman of the fund committee at that time indicated that the plan
most favored was the construction of a memorial assembly hall. How
ever, the letter implied that nothing further would be done in raising
funds until the three million dollar endowment campaign was closed suc
cessfully. So it stood and has stood since that time, growing slowly,
unused.
Stanford will have a memorial; that is a certainty. Right now with
undergraduate agitation rife for a new assembly hall, a new theatre, is
there not the possibility of combining the memorial idea with the New
Theatre movement? Thus accomplishing both ends in one effort?
An assembly hall, in which great men who visit Stanford might ad
dress the student body, a place where concerts and dramatic productions
might be presented as they should be presented, would this not be a
living tribute to the honored dead? There is something fine in the thought
that a memorial to those who have gone before could become a part of
the life of the generations of students who use it.
This is no new idea. Many memorial halls have been built the coun
try over for this purpose. There would be nothing radical in combining
the old movement now temporarily stopped with the younger movement
now fast on the go. The welding of the two toward the broader aim of
building a splendid living tribute to the war heroes would hasten the ac
complishment of the new and would give new impetus to the old.

living tribute to the honored dead? There is something fine in the thought
that a memorial to those who have gone before could become a part of
the life of the generations of students who use it.
This is no new idea. Many memorial halls have been built the coun
try over for this purpose. There would be nothing radical in combining
the old movement now temporarily stopped with the younger movement
now fast on the go. The welding of the two toward the broader aim of
building a splendid living tribute to the war heroes would hasten the ac
complishment of the new and would give new impetus to the old.
Stanford's War Memorial still hangs in the misty nothingness of
about-to-be, the country of things planned and not accomplished. One
hundred seventeen thousand and some odd dollars lies well fed and fat
tening on accruing interest. 1 his is the amount thus far accumulated for
the building of the memorial. Many have been the suggestions and plans
as to the fitting sort of memorial to be constructed. Arches, courts, halls,
trophy rooms, fountains, these are typical of some of the varied plans
laid for the memorial. And still nothing concrete has been done about it.
One hundred fifty thousand dollars was set as the quota to be procured
for the building. About 1922 the fund had reached one hundred three
thousand dollars. At this time the First Million and the Second Million
endowment plans were getting under way. A letter from Dr. Wilbur to
the chairman of the fund committee at that time indicated that the plan
most favored was the construction of a memorial assembly hall. How
ever, the letter implied that nothing further would be done in raising
funds until the three million dollar endowment campaign was closed suc
cessfully. So it stood and has stood since that time, growing slowly,
unused.
Stanford will have a memorial; that is a certainty. Right now with
undergraduate agitation rife for a new assembly hall, a new theatre, is
there not the possibility of combining the memorial idea with the New
Theatre movement? Thus accomplishing both ends in one effort?
An assembly hall, in which great men who visit Stanford might ad
dress the student body, a place where concerts and dramatic productions
might be presented as they should be presented, would this not be a
living tribute to the honored dead? There is something fine in the thought
that a memorial to those who have gone before could become a part of
the life of the generations of students who use it.
