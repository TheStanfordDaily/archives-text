For it seems that undergraduate wrath expressed itself in it in vitriolic
attack, clothed in the flimsy sheerness of satire, on the recent Harkness
endowment. And this is not the thing to do at Harvard, tut, tut, Lampie.
Edward Stephen Harkness, seeing the Oxonian plan of the "inner
collcge" as the apogee of academic organization, presented hoary John
Harvard with the tidy little sum of thirteen million, the which to ac
complish his dream of Harvard transcended.
But none of this would Lampie agree to. Instead the soured jester
hissed that the "intrusive interests of Doctor Harkness" are "a $13,000,-
000 shot of cocaine that will whoop things up for a while. But, oh, God,
what a morning after there will be." Lampie won t have Harvard s face
lifted.
On and on it raved adding that "After John Harvard has had 293
years of varying success, six weeks of apple sauce bid fair to leave him
with nothing but a pair of pants and a coat of coppcr nitrate.
A strange bird is old Lampie to disdain haughtily a paltry thirteen
million. The poorer western institutions stand back with mouth agape
to think that such a gift should receive such a welcome. Alack and alas.
Stanford groans for a First Million and a Second Million. 1 hirteen
would l>e a golconda of suppressed desires satisfied in Stanford aspira
tions.
Yet the institution that receives a large sum such as that binds itself
to the donor. Nothing is given for nothing. The freedom to grow as it
sees fit is limited by the very giving. Would that benefactors of univer
sities would give strings off, hands free, unattached, realizing that the
university is an institution capable of directing its own destiny even
though poor in worldly goods. But as long as the university is the hungry
man at the door of the wealthy man, the wealthy man will continue to
dole out what he wishes in soup plates or tin pans, just as he wants.

For it seems that undergraduate wrath expressed itself in it in vitriolic
attack, clothed in the flimsy sheerness of satire, on the recent Harkness
endowment. And this is not the thing to do at Harvard, tut, tut, Lampie.
Edward Stephen Harkness, seeing the Oxonian plan of the "inner
collcge" as the apogee of academic organization, presented hoary John
Harvard with the tidy little sum of thirteen million, the which to ac
complish his dream of Harvard transcended.
But none of this would Lampie agree to. Instead the soured jester
hissed that the "intrusive interests of Doctor Harkness" are "a $13,000,-
000 shot of cocaine that will whoop things up for a while. But, oh, God,
what a morning after there will be." Lampie won t have Harvard s face
lifted.
On and on it raved adding that "After John Harvard has had 293
years of varying success, six weeks of apple sauce bid fair to leave him
with nothing but a pair of pants and a coat of coppcr nitrate.
A strange bird is old Lampie to disdain haughtily a paltry thirteen
million. The poorer western institutions stand back with mouth agape
to think that such a gift should receive such a welcome. Alack and alas.
Stanford groans for a First Million and a Second Million. 1 hirteen
would l>e a golconda of suppressed desires satisfied in Stanford aspira

Yet the institution that receives a large sum such as that binds itself
to the donor. Nothing is given for nothing. The freedom to grow as it
sees fit is limited by the very giving. Would that benefactors of univer
sities would give strings off, hands free, unattached, realizing that the
university is an institution capable of directing its own destiny even
though poor in worldly goods. But as long as the university is the hungry
man at the door of the wealthy man, the wealthy man will continue to
dole out what he wishes in soup plates or tin pans, just as he wants.
Lampoon, staid New England confrere, in kind at least, of Chaparral,
