Says Artlen X. Pangborn, editor so to speak of the Oregon Daily
Emerald, a college journal, "The Emerald will print no more editorials.
. . . Hereafter students may editorialize on anything they wish.
Can it be that the etlitor withdraws with a gracious bow by popular
request. No, no, never. He has looked into the future and visualized the
blazing tabloid of super-sensational capacity minus the editorial. Don t
you realize, Arden X., that the editor is chief critic and arbiter of con
temporary affairs wielding his power through the editorial column? 1 hat
he is always welcome, welcome like the plague? Ah, Arden X., the Daily
sympathizes with you. It was a doleful job, wasn t it.' But now all is
over. You may rest in the peaceful calm, the Nirvana of editorial ex
pressionlessness and let the mob run riot and let it take all the buffets
and knocks of campus opinion.
