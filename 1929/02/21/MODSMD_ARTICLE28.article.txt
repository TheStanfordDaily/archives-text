An unsuspecting campus will awake Monday morning, the morning
after an awful week-end, and through the groggy eyes of hangover will
see at its door the Freshman Edition of the Daily. There will be no
paper tomorrow in order that these "funny birds" (there are eight on the
staff) may go into a three-day huddle and bring forth their child in all
its freshmaniac glory. It is rumored that the lads have a great surprise
for the older generations. Big things arc they planning. No small-timers
arc they. Oh, hum, now for that three day whoopee ... of study.
