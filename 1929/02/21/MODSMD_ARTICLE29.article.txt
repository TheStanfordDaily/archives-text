# The 						Bullsession
## A 						FUNNY BIRD IS THE FRESHMAN 
### 
The college freshman can be described
as a man with a shiny new belt-buckle
and watch fob on his person, and a
willing, pleading expression on his face. .
He is an amusing but harmless creature'
if there ever was one; a subject for psy- \
chological experimentation and psychi
atric observation.
By "freshman" we do not particularly
mean the members of the Class of 1932 j
or those of 1929 four years ago, but
freshmen of any generation or university.
They are peculiar specimens of humanity
that have existed since the origin of the
present educational system. There are j
typical freshmen in all walks of life.:
There are freshmen in the military serv-1
ice, in the legal, professorial, and medi
cal professions, freshman plumbers, trav
eling salesmen, and radio announcers, but
none are so deserving of attention as the
freshman collegian.
Mr. Average College Freshman has a
very definite character, in spite of any j
contrary opinions formed by glancing j
around the Library. His character is |
composed of ignorant willingness, gulli- J
bility, plasticity, hope, expectation, secret ,
ambition, and mild conceit. On the cam- j
pus he is as democratic as a politician j
before the polls close, and wisely so. I
When home on a vacation he resembles
the politician the day after his election.
On the campus he is dog-meat; at home
he is roast pheasant.
There are two things that arc strik- j
ingly synonymous with the freshman — (
(1) a sheep; (2) the marble on a rou-[

lette wheel. The dictionary defines a
sheep as "a ruminant animal allied to
the goat, especially any of the numerous
domesticated varieties; it differs con
spicuously from the goat in that it has
a less agile build, no beard in the male,
and possesses a fine, thick, woolly coat"
—possibly coonskin. Observation of the
mammalian lawn-mowers in action near
| the polo field will reveal that they move
iin ilocks guided by nagging, barking,
sophomoric animals not superior to them
selves. They do not watch where they
are going, nor would they choose any
, particular destination if they could.
I Their course is directed right, then left,
i by the jolts of their companions' shoul
ders.
So with the roulette marble. It spins
around dizzily and aimlessly for a while
and then settles into some particular
channel usually determined by proximity
or the course of least resistance.
Freshmen arc as plastic today as they
were in the time of Aristotle. They are
just as gullible and just as comical. They
still lack leadership and initiative, still
imitate ideals, and still worship heroes.
Remedies ? Fortunately, there are none,
i Freshmen will continue to be the butt of
j collcge jokes, continue to build bonfires,
I and continue to act as freshmen as long
as the university exists.
Members of the Class of 1932 will con
tinue to be freshmen for a while. At
present they are living and hoping for
i the day when they can wear a bored look,
( and shout, "Pipe down, frosh!"
