### QUERIES BY A GRAD 
The Editor, Sir:
The little item in the Daily the other j
day to the effect that there were too .
many A's and B's given during 1928
causes one to wonder if any analysis of j
the situation lias been made or if the ;
professors will on the whole appre-!
ciably reduce the number of A's and li's j
to be given this winter quarter just for j
fear of being too generous with the high- j
er grades.
Docs the Registrar's office know j
whether the preponderance of the coveted 1
high grades were given to Upper Divi-1
sion students, graduates, or were they j
evenly distributed among the students as j
a whole? If the greater number of these |
good grades were given to seniors and :
grads, there is no cause to worry that the '
curve is not being properly respected and
preserved, for this reason: The Uni
versity wishes to increase the number of j

graduate and advanced students and it
wishes these students to be of the best
caliber available. That means that they
I are, presumably, those who have suc
| cessfully survived the hazards of their
i earlier college work; they are the abler
! brains; they are, as nearly as it is pos-
I sible to be, a selected group. Can a se
lected group, in which advanced and
j graduate students are ever increasing in
j proportion to the total enrollment, logi
j cally be held to such a cut and dried
1 pronouncement as the normal curve ap
j plied to grades ?
If the above queries were answered,
j some light might lie thrown on the sub
ject and many fears quieted. In the
: meantime, may wc suggest that grades
! for grads, if not for the whole school,
Ibe replaced by plus-minuses? Thank
! you.
