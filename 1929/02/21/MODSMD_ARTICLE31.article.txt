# TOO BAD! ONE HUNDRED ARRIVED AT NINE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
"Simply hand in the list of words per
sonally between the hours of nine and
ten, Wednesday, at the business office of
the Daily."
Though this may not be Campus Opin
ion it is the opinion of at least four stu
dents, who did as they were bidden.

When the Daily contains a request for j
personal appearance, one should ordi- I
narily suppose there would be someone in |
to receive him.
I have not expressed my opinion—l
have simply stated the facts to avoid
shocking the guilty party's tender sensi- j
bilities.
