AT THE THEATRES
COLUMBIA—The 19th Hole. This
family comedy dealing with what hap
pens when the head of the family
becomes a golf fanatic is written by
Frank Craven and is made far better
than it would otherwise be because
he also plays the lead.
GEARY—The Guardsman goes in its
last ten days. This sparklingly subtle
comedy by Molnar is highly recom
mended.
ALCAZAR —Courage, starring Em
ilia Dunn, finishes a long run on Sat
urday, March 2. A good, entertaining
comedy.
CURRAN—The Silent House is
(here for a limited engagement. It is
a blood-curdling terror melodrama,
although it has many of the qualities
of a mystery play.
GREEN STREET—Easy for Zee
Zee, an audacious "French" farce, is
in its twenty-fifth week. "There's a
reason." Also, there is a fresco of
intriguing pictures around the walls
of this tiny playhouse.
PRESIDENT—The Skull, a high
speed series of theatrical hokum, is
a typical mystery play. The setting
and atmosphere are admirable, but the
plot and acting are rather weak by
comparison.
With the woek-end made one day
longer by the celebration of Wash
ington's birthday, it is fortunate that
there is one really worthwhile and
"not-to-be-missed" production in San
Francisco. This is "The Guardsman,"
which ran in New York for a year
when the New York Theatre Guild
staged it.
If you want just entertainment, any
of the shows are recommended, ac
cording to what suits your taste and
mood at the moment. They're all O.K.

] from that point, of view. But you
j should not miss Lowell Sherman in
j "The Guardsman.''
