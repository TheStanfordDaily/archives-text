# The 						Skull. President Theatre.
## 
### 
From the„ time a dimly illumined
i figure slithers down a rope ladder
; onto the chancel of a darkened church
| set until the final unmasking. "The
Skull" affords all the chilling screams,
secret pasages, bodies falling from
coffins, hidden jewels, appearing and
disappearing death's-heads, and terri
fied humans required of the best mys-
I tery thriller.

The point on which the plot hinges
is the identity of The Skull, famous
criminal. It is not so impossible to
guess which of the persons ostensibly
searching for tliis jewel thief and
j counterfeiter actually is The Skull,
j bui there is plenty of surprise at the
close even for the cleverest. And
throughout suspicion is rather gener
ally distributed among the characters.
Variety to this theme is furnished
by the introduction of the superna
tural, and the seance held in the third
act in which the ghosts of the sup-
I posedly departed appear and speak is
; particularly effective. These same
ghosts quite conveniently afford op
portunity throughout for all manner !
of weird sounds and "manifestations" i
I —thus adding considerably to the
; pleasurable nervousness of the audi
ence, and to the far from pleasurable
terror of the poor Associated Press '
' reporter.
Although a mystery play can be
made very enjoyable through stunts |
alone, one always looks rorward to i
the "Why of course!" feeling which j
comes from the explanation at the
last. This is given only partially in j
"The Skull," and the audience is left ,
to puzzle out a good deal of the phe- |
nomena, psychic and otherwise, for
itself. Nevertheless the emotional ten-j
sion and terror —in which the audi- j
| ence took a considerable part, judging :
from the frequency and volume of
feminine screams —were most satisfy- j
ing.
Bob Demarest, the pathetically and |
amusingly terrified reporter, and Dr. j
Tolman, a mysterious Dr. Jekyl and j
Mr. Hyde character, were particularly ,
good. So was Harry Alsing, a hunch
back with excellent make-up. Mr. 1
Howard Gibson played Demarest, and
Mr. William Lloyd, Dr. Tolman. Alsing ;
was taken by Mr. Stewart Wilson, j
Miss Charlotte Tread way as Dor- i
othy Merrill seemed the conventional
and blonde stage heroine. Lillian Dean
made a very good hysterical aunt. Mr. i
James Durkin looked and acted as
cne might expect a Professor Vor
heese, spiritualist, to do, and Zita
Moulton made a convincing spook.
Go to see "The Skull" for a succes- !
; sion of shocks, scares, laughs—for it j
never goes beyond the point of good 1
fun. Enjoy the really good lighting
and sound effects, don't bother too |
j much about plot or acting, and you
| will have two and a half hours of
I real entertainment. —M. C.
