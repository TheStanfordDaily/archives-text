## Whitewashed William 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Now that "William the Twice" Til* ]
den has been O.K.'d by the executive
committee of the "You Shall Leave
i
Typewriters Alone," let us all gather |
'round Secretary Davis' Mustache Cup '
and give three cheers for the player
writer rule. Ambassador Herrick, Ma- j
jor Wingfield, the inventor of lawn ,
tennis, and the head ball-boy at Forest i
Hills. Isn't it grand that Bad Big Bill j
is lily-white and a pure amateur
again, and can go on writing syndi-1
cated articles on tennis and give his
name to cigarette testimonials and 1
act on the stageâ€”all on account of
his tennis fame?
Well, why not? Hasn't Tilden done
more for tennis than anybody else?
As a reporter, he capitalizes his knowl- j
edge of the game. Who is better quali-1

1 fied to write about tennis than this
man who wields pen and racket with
'equal facility? As Susie Lenglen said,
i "The distinction between amateurs
! and professionals in tennis is social
j in England, financial in France, and
imaginary in America." Bill makes
his living indirectly from tennis, and
: the United States Lawn Tennis Asso-
I ciation's sacred coffers have been
j filled in a great measure through the
racket-waving ability of Mr. W. T. 2nd.
I So now one can't help wondering if
; all this had happened three or four
i years ago when Bill was in his prime
and not slipping, as he is now, would
j the U.S.L.T.A. have knocked his only
visible means of support out from
under him (i.e. taken away his racket)
and thus deprived the association of
j its greatest gate attraction?
