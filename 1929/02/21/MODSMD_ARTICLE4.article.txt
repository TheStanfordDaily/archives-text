j terday by a score of 9 to 3. The Gael
batsmen gathered fourteen hits off
the Stanford chuckers and had the

The Card pitchers were not wild j
I yesterday, but they grooved too many '
for the Saint hitters, while Conlin '
j and Hamilton, the visiting mounds- j
j men, held the Redshirts in check, al- j
; lowing them but three bingles. Cook |
j made two of them and one went for j
I two bases.
j Stanford made three runs in the j
i fourth inning when Churchill and
j Hunken walked, Cook doubled to left
! to score both runners, and Johnson
singled to center field to score Cook. \

their own way, scoring six runs in j
the next three innings.
