# ENGLISH CLUB PLAY TO BE FIRST IBSEN PRODUCTION AT STANFORD IN 14 YEARS
## Celebration of Playwright's Centenary Makes Selection of "Wild Duck" Particularly Appropriate—Davis 
### 
For the first time in fourteen years,
Ibsen wil be presented "on the campus
when the English Club play, "The Wild
Duck," is shown in the Assembly Hall
March 1. In 1915 Dr. Margery Bailey,
then a student in the University, took the
lead in Ibsen's "Pillars of Society." Al
though two years ago Gordon Davis
planned to produce "1 he Wild Duck"
here, it was not done because it was
considered too difficult for amateur pro
duction. But this year, because of the
Ibsen Centenary, which ends March 20,
Davis thought it appropriate to try one
of his plays again.
Although it is seldom produced, this
drama ranks with Ibsen's greatest works.
It is unsurpassed for its interweaving
of quiet humor and deep tragedy, and,
typical of the playwright, there is a bal
ance of the realistic and symbolic, so
that the play may be interpreted either
way by the audience.
Play Is Difficult
The cast and directors have had to
work doubly hard on this production,
not only because in itself it is a difficult
play to put over without going to the ex
treme of stark tragedy, but also because
it has had to be prepared in a very short
time. Usually the last play of winter
quarter comes as near finals as possible,
but this year the date has been moved
ahead a week.
The part of the theological student,
Molvik, which was left open when Stan
ley Mullin, first cast in this role, took
over that of Gregers Werle, has been
(illed by Henry Ramsey, who is a new
comer to Stanford dramatics. Of the
other members of the cast, Tom Henry,
as Hjalmar Ekdal, has one of the most
difficult male leads of any campus play.
Portraying the self-deluded, hypocritical
father of a daughter who is slowly go
ing blind, Henry must show a man who
genuinely tries to be sympathetic with
others, but, because of his innate self- i

I deception, always thinks of himself in
stead.
Although there are five acts in "The
I Wild Duck," there are only two settings,
both of which, however, are extremely
complicated and difficult to build. And
in spite of its length, the time of the play
extends only over thirty-six hours —be-
| ginning one night after dinner and end
j ing two days later early in the morning.
