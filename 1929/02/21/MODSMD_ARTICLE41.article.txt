LONDON, Feb. 20. (/p)—'"The dun
geon of the banned" is the name
given to a secret chamber in the Brit
ish museum which contains books
considered unfit for public perusal.
The doors of this chamber are always
locked and only museum officials
have ever been inside.
! In the museum, there are more
than fifty-four miles of book-shelves
and some 4,000,000 books, some of
which have been there for more than
150 years. All are doomed to remain
in the museum forever. Copies of all
books, periodicals, and papers with a
London imprint must by right of law
he given to the museum authorities.
Not every book cover seen by the
visitor in the museum is really the
I back of a volume, for secret doors are
numerous, and the pressure of a con
i cealed knob often causes shelves of
; apparently ponderous tomes to swing
back and reveal the book-lined study
: of a museum official.
i
The Free State courts of Ireland
i are busy lessening the number of
I drink shops, the idea being to pre
| uerve only those houses that are
j meeting a need.
