# Companionate Groom Comes To Speedy End In Germany
## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 20. (JP)â€”'The first in
stance in Germany of a companionate
marriage coming to grief in the law
courts has occurred here.
When the temporary arrangement
ended, the wife found that her hus
band had used 400 marks of her sav
ings for his own expenses and had
stolen another 200 marks out of her
companionate purse.
She brought suit and won. The hus
baud was sentenced to two months'
imprisonment for embezzlement, and
it was pointed out that the German
law recognized only the traditional
form of marriage. The force of the
decision is that a companionate hus
band has no right to spend his wife's
money.
