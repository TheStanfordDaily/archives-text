# "TAKE UP WHAT YOU'RE INTERESTED IN," IS ADVICE OF SCANDRETT, RAILROAD HEAD

### GUNNAR NORBERG 
"While you're in college, take up what- j
ever you're interested in, and if you find :
you're not interested in anything in col- j
lege—quit college."
Thus spoke H. A. Scandrett, president {
of the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and !
Pacific Railroad Company, during a re
cent interview given the Daily in San
Francisco. Asked what he would say,
what advice he would give, were he to
address a group of college students who
intended soon to enter business, Scan
drett evaded a bit, for he said, "There is
nothing, no audience, more critical than a
college audience."
How critical a college audience can
be, Scandrett has gool reason to know.
He is an alumnus of the University of
Minnesota, holding in addition to his
LL.B. degree, one as Bachelor of Litera
ture.
Room at Top
"Play the game—play it hard, play it
fair. What there is in it for you is what
you get out of it finally," said Scandrett.
"It is a trite remark to say that there
is room at the top in business, in the
railroad game. Yet it is true. For the
man who is earnest and energetic, there !
is room at the top.
"However, I wouldn't have anybody |
concentrate on business to the exclusion |
of everything else—to the exclusion of !
making friends. This, the making of i
friends, I consider very important. But j
it would be well to keep in mind what
Emerson said about friendship: 'If you j
would have a friend, you must be one.' j
Many people do not seem to understand i
this, though they should."
But a minute or two before his private I
car stirred, as it was about to leave San '
Francisco on a train bound for Del j
Monte, Scandrett spoke briefly of an j
ideal relationship between work and play,
ideal for him who would make of his i
life what is called a success.
Mix Work and Play
"You have to mix these things. A man j

may get into a work rut or a play rut.
There must be a mixing of the two, a
mixing of work and play. The best
rounded man works and plays too."
After receiving his legal degree at the
University of Minnesota in 1900, Scan
drett became a claim adjuster in the em
ploy of the Union Pacific Railroad Com
pany. Advancing steadily, he became in
1925 vice-president in charge of valua
tion, commerce matters, land, and public
relations departments, for the Union Pa
cific. This position he held until his ap
pointment in January, 1928, to his pres
ent position as president of the road pop
ularly known as the "Milwaukee." Scan
drett is a member of Delta Kappa Epsi
lon fraternity.
Rockne will entirely revise his fa
mous grid system this year.
