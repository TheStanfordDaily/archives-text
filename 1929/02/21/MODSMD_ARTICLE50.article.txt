# FIRST VARSITY MEET TO BE WITH OLYMPIC TRACK MEN MARCH 9
## Cards Will Rest Tomorrow Following Creditable Showing Tuesday 
### 
After their encouraging showing in the
interclass meet last Tuesday, Coach Dink
Temple ton's varsity and freshman track -
sters will take tilings easy tomorrow and
not compete in the usual practice meet.
The varsity has more than two weeks of
work ahead of it yet before it engages in
its first competition of the year on March
9 in the Stadium with the Olympic Club.
The Olympics in the past have always
put strong teams on the field and should
do so again this year.
Performances Tuesday indicate that
the Card team this year will be almost
as strong as that which scored such an
overwhelming victory in the 1928 1.C.4-A.
meet at Boston. In the field Stanford
will l>e as strong as last year in every
event but the high jump. In that event
there is no one to replace Bob King, in
tercollegiate and Olympic champion.
French, who did six feet Tuesday, seems
to be the best bet. Madison andWood
yatt can both go over 5 ft. 11 in., and
Austin has done 6 ft. 1 in.
In the track events the hurdles, sprints,
and quarter mile will all be well taken
care of. Coe will be missed in the two
mile but Loofbourow and Brown are
improving steadily and should be good
for points in most of the dual meets
scheduled. Loofbourow was al>le to fin
ish only a step ahead of Brown Tuesday
after they had fought it out for the lead
during the entire lust lap, the time of
which, by the way, was 05 s., exception
ally good for a two-mile finish.
McKinnon will probably compete in
the half-mile this season and should run
the two laps in under 2 m. by the time
of the Olympic Club meet. If McKinnon
competes in the half, Wright will be the
Card hope in the mile.
