# SCHUBERT'S UNFINISHED SYMPHONY IS CHOSEN DANCE DRAMA THEME
## 
### MARTHA JUDSON 
Schubert's "Unfinished Symphony,"
chosen by Helen Stewart Cramer's Dance
Composition Class to form the theme of
the dance program on March 12, is ap
proached by few symphonies in the con
cert repertoire in the universality of its
appeal.
To call it the "Unfinished Symphony"
is, in a sense, misleading. As a symphony
in conventional form it is incomplete, for
there are only two movements instead of
the usual four. Hut in a larger sense it
is perfect. Schubert's work on it was not
interrupted by his death, for he lived
several years after laying it aside, con
vinced in all probability that the writing
of two more sections could add nothing
to it.
The chief characteristic of the first
movement is a constant recurrence of
the main theme developed from the be
ginning and varied throughout the move
ment with a changing accompaniment.
Rcauty and contrast are achieved in the
second movement by the use of modula
tions.
The Dance Composition Class will in
terpret the symphony through the me
dium of the dance alone, paying strict
attention to the detailed structure of the
music, with the purpose of evolving a
symphony of motion in harmony with
Schuliert's symphony of tones.
Now York customs officers are re
stating to plain clothes methods of
"frisking" passengers for liquor at the
docks.
