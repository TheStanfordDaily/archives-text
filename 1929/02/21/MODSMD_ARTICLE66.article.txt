# CUNNINGHAM, ENGLISH ORGANIST, WILL PLAY IN CONCERT MONDAY
## Famed Musician to Appear In Chapel at Eleven; Classes Dismissed 
### 
G. D. Cunningham, famous English or
ganist, will play in the Memorial Church
Monday morning in an 11 'clock Uni
versity assembly for which all classes
will be excused. Cunningham comes to
America on his first concert tour under
the auspices of the National Association
of Organists.
Persistent rumors of American tours
by Cunningham during the past few
years have hitherto proved unfounded,
owing to the extremely active profession
al life of the organist. His tour will last
through January and February, since he
returns to England in March to resume
his duties as conductor of the Birming
ham City Choir and organist of Town
Hall, and his responsibilities at the Royal
College of Organists and the Royal
Academy of Music in London.
Cunningham is in his early forties and
comes to America in the prime of his
musical powers, with a reputation al
ready established as an organ virtuoso of
the first rank and with a popularity which
has been won as much by reason of his
charming personality as by his unusual
musical gifts.
Sir Henry Wood, the greatest English
conductor, considers him "one of the fin
est organ recitalists." According to
Wood, Cunningham's technic, registra
tion, phrasing, and interpretation of the
great classical organ masterpieces have
alike impressed the musician and the in
telligent musical public. "I know of no
one," said Wood, "more splendidly
equipped."
