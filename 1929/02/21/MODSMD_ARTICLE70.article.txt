# HONOR SYSTEM PLEDGES ARE TAKEN OUT OF QUARTERLY REGISTRATION BOOKLETS
## 
### 
Present Stanford students have for
! the last time signed the Honor System
I pledge, which for three years has ap
peared in the quarterly registration
hook. Its abolition was recommended
by the committee for the investiga-
I tion of the Honor System and was
j voted by the student body at the
j Honor assembly on January 24. Ac
| cordingly, Registrar J. P. Mitchell has
| announced that next quarter the new-
I ly worded statement of the existence
of the Honor Code will appear only
in the registration books of new in
coming students.
Students will recall that the present,
pledge runs to the effect that the
signer volunteers to withdraw from
the University if he is guilty of dis-
I honorable conduct in academic work.
! This has frequently been complained
! of as being an incongruous pledge to
: put one's name to, since anyone who
would cheat would probably make no
j ecruple against concealing himself as
a cheater, even against his pledged
word.
The new Honor Code statement,
which is to be signed by students
only upon their entrance into the
University, is merely informative. It
is as follows:
"I hereby acknowledge that I am
fully aware of the fact that honorable
conduct in academic work —i.e., the
refraining from giving or receiving

unpermitted aid in examinations, class !
1 exercises, reports, or any other work
that is to be used by the instructor j
as a basis of grading—is the spirit of j
conduct in this University. (Signa
ture.)"
On every examination book here- j
I after to be printed by the University]
will appear the following statements: j
HONORABLE CONDUCT
in academic work is the spirit of
I conduct in this University.
SUGGESTIONS FOR CONDUCT
1. Occupy alternate seats where
possible.
I 2. When in doubt as to the mean
ing of a question, consult the
instructor. He will be found in
his office.
The registrar explains that the new
! wording on the examination books
\ will appear as the present stock of ;
bluebooks is depleted and others are |
printed.
