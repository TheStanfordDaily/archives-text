# Trotzky Plans To Spend Exiled Years In Germany
## 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 20 (£>).—The German I
| Foreign Office today received notice of
| the request of Leon Trotzky, deposed j
| Soviet war chief, to spend his exile from
, Russia in this country.
The request was made at the German I
consulate at Pera, a suburb of Constanti- i
nople, and forwarded here. It is under- j
stood that the Soviet ambassador here !
will be consulted in the matter. The ;
cabinet does not regard the matter as j
urgent and will discuss it at one of its j
.
next meetings. /
There seems to he a feeling among j
politicians that Trotzky should be ad-1
mitted if he promises in writing to re- j
I frain from all political activity.
