# FIVE WORDS SPELLED WRONG IN DAILY ADS BRING 150 ANSWERS
## 
### 
' Stanford students do read the adver
[ tisements in the Daily or, at least, they
read them yesterday morning for over
I 150 people entered the misspelled-word
i contest in an effort to win the free tick
j ets to tlic New Stanford Theatre.
j All the prizes were given out by ten
j minutes after nine since it was a ques
! tion of "first come, first served." The
j contest was made somewhat easier than
1 was first planned by the fact that there
| were five misspelled words in the adver
j tisements instead of three as was first
announced.
Victor Siegfried and Paul Nash won
j the first two prizes which were a double
| pass apiece to the New Stanford Theatre, i
i Powell E. Smith, Ronald Horn, and Lee j
i Shapovalov won single passes. These j
i were the first five to bring in a corrcct I
list of three of the live misspelled words. I
The misspelled words were: Pickwick
in the Pickwick Stages ad on page four,
J headquarters in the Keeble's ad on page
j one, Ramona in the Phelps-Terkel ad on
| page two, flaming in the New Stanford
! theater ad on page four, and dentifrice
| in the Weingartncr's ad on page three.
