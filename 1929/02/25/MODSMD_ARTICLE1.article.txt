# CALIFORNIA WINS LAST CAGE TILT OF CARD SERIES
## Cardinal Rally Lowers Bear Lead, But Fails in Halting Victors' Heavy Onslaught Californians Retain Perfect Conference Percentage by Ninth Straight Win, 28-17 
### BETTS HAWKINS 
in the slowest game of the series,
the Stanford basketball team, by a
to 17 score, fell before the attack
of the Golden Bear at the Oakland
.Auditorium Saturday night.
The Californians' third straight vic
tory from tlie Cards left them with a
perfect percentage of conference
wins. They have nine league victories
and have been defeated only by Santa
Clara and St. Ignatius, non-conference
teams.
Soon after the start of the game
California scored when Captain Vein
Corbin sank the first tally. Through
out the game the Bear quintet held a
load over Stanford, in spite of experi
encing more than usual difficulty in
finding tlie basket. At half-time the
score stood 14 to 8.
Although Hunt shifted the Cardinal
line-up several times in an attempt to
find a smooth-working combination,
Stanford did not look good in the first
half. However in the second session
when Bud Hawkins was sent into the
.name at center, Stanford staged a
rally. The short passes of Hawkins
and Berg enabled the Cards to pene
trate the Bear defense.
Mike Reynolds made an excellent
showing in repeatedly clearing the
hall from the California basket, lie is
a great defensive player. The Red
Berg-Don Tyler forward combination
worked best but both players were
handicapped by lack of weight.
Most of the players on the Card
team are sophomores so Coach Husky
Hunt will have some fine material for
next year's team. Although hope of
defeating California will have to be
laid on the shelf until next year, the
Stanford team by winning second
place in the southern division of the
Coast Conference made the best
showing in basketball this season that
it has for several years.
The absence of Stanford rooters
"was extremely noticeable when the
( fforts of Card yell leaders brought
l'orth only a weak response.
