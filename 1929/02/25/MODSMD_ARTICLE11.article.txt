# "College Humor" Accepts Verdict Of Comics Group
## Comics Convention to Meet Upon Stanford Campus In Next Session 
### 
At the annual convention of the
Western Association of College
Comics held at Reno 4k>t Friday and
Saturday, the association went on rec
ord in disapproving of the past policy
taken on national advertisers by Col
lege Humor. However, in view of (he
fact that College Humor acquiesced to
the demands made to it by the asso
ciation, the comics did not reaffirm
its action taken last year to the effect
that no member of the W.A.C.C.
should sign exclusive reprint con
tracts with College Humor. The asso
ciation, while not in favor of its mem
bers signing contracts with College
Humor, decided to leave it up to the
comic itself whether or not to sign.
Following are the demands acceded
to by College Humor:
1. That College Humor will inform
all advertisers receiving its book,
"The Approach to the College Mar
ket" that College Humor is not the
primary medium for reaching the col
lege field.
2. That College Humor will instruct
its advertising salesmen not. to repre
sent it as a better advertising medium
in reaching the college market thin
the comics, and not to sell national
advertising at the expense of college
comics.
3. That College Humor and the
comics of the W.A.C.C. will work in
good faith; that no infringement shall
be made upon the above statements;
and that College Humor will stop mak
ing any untrue statements concern
ing its coverage of the colleges.
4. That several minor changes shall
be made in the contract as asked for
by the association.
Chaparral representatives to the
convention were Dick Holt, Business
Manager/ and Bob Paine, Managing
Editor. Invitation to hold next year's
convention at Stanford was accepted.
Also, the next year's editor of Chapar
ral was elected president of the asso
ciation for the coming year.
In addition to the settling of the
College Humor difficulty, the comics
discussed problems of management
and editorial makeup. The editors con
demned the publishing of copy sub
mitted by professional artists who
need publicity and are not paid for
material.
