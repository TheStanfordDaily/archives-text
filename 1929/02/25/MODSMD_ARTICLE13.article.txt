# "WILD DUCK" POWERFUL CHARACTER PLAY; LAST DRAMA APPEARANCE OF KATHLEEN FITZ
## 
### BETTS HAWKINS 
"The Wild Duck," which will be
presented on the campus March 1, is
one of Henrik Ibsen's most powerful
character dramas. Balancing of the
symbolic and realistic is characteris
tic of this playwright. To offset the
; i.ragedy and realism and emphasize
the undercurrent of humor will be the
j outstanding feature of Gordon Davis'
interpretation of this work.
i The task facing the "Wild Duck"
cast is one that is not to be taken
lightly; one, indeed, which has been
! too much for reputable professional
companies. Two years ago Gordon
Davis considered the play too diffi
cult for a campus production. It may
: be considered a compliment to the
â–  progress made in dramatics at Stan
lord that he is now producing this
i play.
Kathleen Fitz as Hedvig will make
; her last campus appearance, except
j for her part in the benefit vaudeville
in April. Her role necessitates a diffi
cult characterization of a shy four
teen-year-old girl. Miss Fitz, one of
Stanford's most accomplished ac
tresses, has had excellent training in

I campus plays. She has taken straight
leads in two productions, "The Book
of Charm" and "The Romantic Young
Lady," has played in all the football
shows, the Junior Opera, and the
Fiesta. Her record of a show each
quarter, including the one quarter
when freshman women were eligible,
is enviable.
Tom Henry, for his initial appear
ance in dramatics here, took the lead
in "The Haunted House." His part as
| Hialmar in Ibsen's drama is more
j difficult, but the rehearsals have so
far more than justified Davis' choice.
The setting for the first two acts
lis the drawing-room of a wealthy mer
chant's homo. The scene of the third
act is a photographer's studio. Of the
two settings, the latter is the more
j noteworthy, because a striking con
trast of light and dark will be used.
Rich furnishings and costumes will
| carry out tlie idea (if the late nine
teenth century.
I Tickets for $1.25 and $1 will be on
sale tomorrow at one o'clock at the
Women's Clubhouse and at Keebles
J in Palo Alto.
