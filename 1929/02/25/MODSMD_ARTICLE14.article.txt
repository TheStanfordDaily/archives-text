# MEN GROW FLIGHTY; SAIL COLORED KITES OVER OPEN SPACES
## 
### 
Stanford males, especially jun
iors, appear to be getting flighty,
judging from ihe number of kites
which may be seen flying over
the great open spaces in front of
Toyon Hall and the Encina Com
mons. Red, white, and blue
flashes of color may be seen
sporting in the skies, anchored
to horseshoe-pitching stakes. And
all the time bearded upperclass
men are dashing around like
kids just out of school. It is ex
pected that return to classes will
disrupt this simple sport.
