Mills develops witty, clever speak- i

style of debating. Leonard H. Kirk

says that a quarter has been spent in |
thorough investigation of the facts, 1
and that this debate is expected to
lar surpass all previous frosh debates
from the standpoint of interest.
Last quarter the freshman teams 1
met San Mateo Junior College. This ,
was the first time freshman debaters
had ever met any school but Cali- :
fornia.
