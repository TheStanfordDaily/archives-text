# English Organist Plays At Eleven O'Clock Recital
## All Eleven O'Clock Classes Will Be Excused for Chapel Recital 
### 
G. D. Cunningham, recognized in
England as its foremost concert or
ganist, will play for an all-University
assembly this morning at 11 o'clock
in the Memorial chapel. He visits
Stanford on his first tour of America,
under the auspices of the National
Association of Organists. All 11 o'clock
classes are excused.
Mr. Cunningham comes with a
richly varied repertoire of 1000 pieces.
In tiie city of Birmingham, England,
he plays two series of recitals an
nuallyâ€”one on the great Willis organ
in the City Hall, and the other at the
University of the City of Birmingham.
While not neglecting in the least the
classic masterpieces of Bacli and
Handel, or the romantic schools of
Rlieinberger, Franck, and Widor, he
has courageously and peristently
searched through the disregarded
literature of the past and the unknown
works of present-day composers in
order to find material of interest.
The following is the program he
will present:
Toccata and Fugue in D Minor
I. S. Bach
Air and Variations (From a
Symphony in I)) Hayden
Allegro Vivace (From Fifth
Symphony) Widor
Bourr6e (From "Pastor Fido")
Handel
Introduction and Fugue of "Ad nos,
ad Salutarem Undam" Liszt
Allegretto in E flat Wolstenholme
Finale in B flat C6sar Franck
Stanford students will have the op
portunity of hearing some of the best
music of well-known composers played
by an English musician of distinction
and authority and chosen by a mind
well-trained by long public experience
in matters of taste and judgment.
In writing of a recent recital in
Westminster Cathedral, th-j London
Daily Telegraph reported: "Mr. Cun
ningham reassured us that the pe
culiar art of playing Bach is the pos
session of the English organist per
haps more completely than any other
national school. His playing was not
only brilliant, but masterly ui every
respect, above all in the matter of
rhythm."
