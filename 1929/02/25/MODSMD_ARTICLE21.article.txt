# CARDINAL BABES VANQUISH TWICE OVER WEEK-END
## Sensational Pitching, Hitting Bring Double Victory for Freshman Baseball Team McLean and Caddel Star in San Mateo, Berkeley High Tilts Friday and Saturday 
### 
Sensational pitching and consistent
hitting won two week-end games for
the frosh baseball team on the local
diamond. Friday morning "Lindy" Mc-
Lean pitched his team to a 4-1 victory
over the Berkeley High nine; and
Saturday morning Caddel struck out
eighteen men to account for a fi-5 win
from the San Mateo Junior College
team.
In the Berkeley High game on Fri
day, McLean turned in an excellent
demonstration of pitching and hitting,
striking out nine of the opposing bat
ters, allowing but three hits which
netted only one run, and getting a
triple, a double, and a walk in three
times at bat.
In the second inning the babes
started the hitting fireworks by bunch
ing a single and two triples. With
this good lead, the Berkeley High
boys were held without a threat until
the eighth inning, when McLean al
lowed a single and triple together,
giving the visitors one tally.
Caddel's feat of striking out eight
een batters in the game with San
Mateo Junior College bears consider
able comment. He looked especially
good in pinches. Collecting eleven hits
each, the teams kept neck and neck,
to leave the score tied at five all in
the ninth. Barsumian, babe second
baseman, opened ui) with a single, and
Marx, first-sacker, followed with an
other single to drive in the winning
run.
The coaching position left open by
the resignation of Ernie Nevers has
been filled at least temporarily by
Harry Wolters, varsity mentor, and
Husky Hunt. Hunt has had several
years' experience with frosh baseball
teams.
The squad was materially strength
ened last week when three members
of the frosh basketball team reported
for practice. Ilintala showed up well
in center field in both games; Dixon
gave a good demonstration behind the
plate in the Berkeley High game; and
Krlly has been improving speedily at
third base.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock the
bube nine takes on the San Jose
Teachers College outfit on the local
diamond.
