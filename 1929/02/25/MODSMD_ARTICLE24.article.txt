# '32 Puts Out a Paper

Wuxtry! Wuxtry! The "Freshmaniac Edition"!
In this spirit was our paper announced in last Thursday s editorial
column. "These 'funny birds' are planning a big surprise for the older
generation." But the big novelty surprises are not to be found, unless it
is a novelty for the freshman edition to appear as a sane and sober sheet.
We have cast aside the usual green paper, pride and joy of the high-school
journalist; and with it have gone all boldfaced screechings of the worth
of '32. Humor has not been attempted, for memories of the high-school
razz sheet would have been vivid enough to degenerate any humorous
attempts into crude farce. \\ e have taken the news as it has come and
with our small force of six have tried to present it in the usual ordetly
and conservative style. It is a freshman edition, and so the papei has
been freshened by a reasonable featuring of '32 news; but in no case to
the neglect of important all-University stories. The class of '32 we feel
has thus far gone about its business in a quiet manner, leaving an im
pressive record behind it; and to estimate that record we have followed
the good old Citizenship doctrine of placing the facts before the eye. To
blurb in a boisterous manner gives the impression of forcing recognition
where it may/ not be due. This, a characteristic of many a freshman
edition, we have tried to avoid.
