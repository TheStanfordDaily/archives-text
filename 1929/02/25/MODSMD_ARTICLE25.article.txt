# The 						Open House
## 
### 
A week ago yesterday marked the last of this year s fraternity open
houses to freshmen. We do not hesitate a moment in saying that from
the freshman point of view it would he just as well if the system wcie
abolished forever —at present we all seem to be in a mood for abolishing
tilings in general. On the lirst day of open house, those fiaternities which
happened to be on the host list entertained a fail-sized group, the next
date the number was much smaller; and on the final day many of the
Encinians had decided that the jolly-up was hardly worth the trip up
the row. In this way the houses first 011 the list had an unfair advantage
over the later ones. Just how important this advantage is, or just how
effective is the open house system, may be a matter of varying opinion.
Picture a group of curious freshmen walking up the row in their
brand new overcoats and best Sunday dress ; they enter a fraternity house,
where a buzzing swarm of brothers are introduced to them one after
another; they stand idly about, discussing how high I>ob King vyent in
the high jump in last year's meet; the house musician plays all afternoon
to furnish divertisement for those who grow tired of routine stock con
versation ; innumerable social blunders of forgetting names and incorrect
introductions are made; cigarettes burn to produce the necessary non
chalance. The bewildered freshman finds an old acquaintance and sticks
near him until he leaves for the next house. Here he finds a table loaded
down with sandwiches, salads, and punch. The house he just left had 110
such bounty to offer, and an unreasonable prejudice forms in his mind.
At least there should have been an agreement between houses about
serving refreshments.
What does the freshman get for all this?—a group of superficial
friendships formed under unnatural conditions. It is simply an instance
of the admitted underlying weakness of the whole rushing system —the
inability of the freshman to get a clear picture of the question until it is
all over. The open house system accomplishes practically nothing toward
clearing his distorted view. And the rushing goes on as usual —by special
appointment.

date the number was much smaller; and on the final day many of the
Encinians had decided that the jolly-up was hardly worth the trip up
the row. In this way the houses first 011 the list had an unfair advantage
over the later ones. Just how important this advantage is, or just how
effective is the open house system, may be a matter of varying opinion.
Picture a group of curious freshmen walking up the row in their
brand new overcoats and best Sunday dress ; they enter a fraternity house,
where a buzzing swarm of brothers are introduced to them one after
another; they stand idly about, discussing how high I>ob King vyent in
the high jump in last year's meet; the house musician plays all afternoon
to furnish divertisement for those who grow tired of routine stock con
versation ; innumerable social blunders of forgetting names and incorrect
introductions are made; cigarettes burn to produce the necessary non
chalance. The bewildered freshman finds an old acquaintance and sticks
near him until he leaves for the next house. Here he finds a table loaded
down with sandwiches, salads, and punch. The house he just left had 110
such bounty to offer, and an unreasonable prejudice forms in his mind.
At least there should have been an agreement between houses about
serving refreshments.
What does the freshman get for all this?—a group of superficial
friendships formed under unnatural conditions. It is simply an instance
of the admitted underlying weakness of the whole rushing system —the
inability of the freshman to get a clear picture of the question until it is
all over. The open house system accomplishes practically nothing toward
clearing his distorted view. And the rushing goes on as usual —by special
appointment.
