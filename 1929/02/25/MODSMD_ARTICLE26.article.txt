# Grading System or Plus-Minus?
## 
### 
Discussion of late over the number of As and B's given out during
1928 suggests again the question of the advisability of abolishing the
grading system. It is a topic which should be brought to the front.
Far too much importance is attached to our bawlout record. It is
taken too often as the most accurate indication of a person's ability.
Looking back through grammar- and high-school days, one sees clearly
what an influence those report cards had in estimating the brightness of
an individual. The boy with the per feet record was set on a pedestal of
superiority, to be an object of awe to many a quicker witted lad who had
applied himself less. And the grade holds the same importance in college.
If it were a thoroughly accurate basis of judgment, there would be no
criticism; but too often the A represents an enormous amount of dull
labor; many times cheating; often lack of competition; apple-polishing;
even mistakes in grading, 100 often aD or ( —) comes of neglecting
some dry, required course in order to concentrate upon a subject of more
interest and value, in which the person may do brilliant work. Yet,
acording to the bawlout record, this same person's ability may be rated
as mediocre. Perhaps throughout college he pursues the true educational
ideal —the rounding out of his interests so as to approach the maximum
fullness of living. Perhaps he succeeds remarkably well; still, under the
grading system, his score in a few neglected courses may so lower his
general average as to mark him out to be of only fair ability. When he
looks for a position in the world, that false judgment will hinder him.
And serious as this may be, still it is not the greatest evil. Realizing the
importance attached to his record, many a student is forced to plug away
unceasingly to obtain the high marks; and in so doing he disregards
activities, varied reading, and all those things that develop the widely
ianging interests. lie becomes a skilled specialist, able to net a fat
income; but he has lost his educational ideal and the real pleasures of life.
In place of the grading system we would simply recommend the plus
minus idea, used successfully in the University of Michigan, and in a
number of courses here. In this way the necessary flunks would be
arranged for, and students could direct their time as they thought best.
()nce broached, the subject merits discussion.

Discussion of late over the number of As and B's given out during
1928 suggests again the question of the advisability of abolishing the
grading system. It is a topic which should be brought to the front.
Far too much importance is attached to our bawlout record. It is
taken too often as the most accurate indication of a person's ability.
Looking back through grammar- and high-school days, one sees clearly
what an influence those report cards had in estimating the brightness of
an individual. The boy with the per feet record was set on a pedestal of
superiority, to be an object of awe to many a quicker witted lad who had
applied himself less. And the grade holds the same importance in college.
If it were a thoroughly accurate basis of judgment, there would be no
criticism; but too often the A represents an enormous amount of dull
