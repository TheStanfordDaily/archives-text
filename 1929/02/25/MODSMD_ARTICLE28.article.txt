# The Bullsession
## A LITTLE LAMB SHALL LEAD THEM
### 
"A funny bird is the freshman,"
writes Mr. Carroll O'Meara in a time
ly Bullsession; and then, strangely
enough, he says this funny bird is
strikingly synonymous with a sheep.
Tut, tut, Mr. O'Meara; birds of a
feather flock together, and sheep of a
fleece go where they please; but on
no hand call them synonymous. "They
do not watch where they are going;
their course is directed right, then
left, by the jolts of their companions'
shoulders." Again: "Freshmen are
just as plastic as they were in the
time of Aristotle, just as gullible, and
just as comical. They still lack leader
ship and initiative, still imitate ideals,
and still worship heroes."
Anyone who is acquainted with Mr.
O'Meara's gentle, docile —we might al
most say lamb-like —nature, will real
ize that his remarks are all directed
in the spirit of the column —bullses-
sion; more explicitly, in the general
literary fashion of the day, which
consists in writing down random
thoughts, without any definite pur
pose —something like the movements
of sheep. But some may have taken
Mr. O'Meara seriously, and to those
we should like to say a few words.
Mr. O'Meara pictures the freshman
as entering the University with a
dazzled, pleading look upon his face;
friendly and trusting toward others;
undecided in his movements; easily
influenced by others; gullible enough
to pay radiator fees and to buy the
Daily; comical; and worshiping
heroes. Seeing this picture of them
selves, all freshmen are expected to
blush, sheepishly, of course, and to
rise up in their righteous wrath; but

some of the more sensible ones may
be inclined to think that there is not
really ho much in the picture to re
sent.
To some of these sorely tried and
hardened upperclassmen who remark
upon the freshman's greenness, is it
not at times refreshing to see a young
student entering college with "the in
nocence of youth shining in his face";
to see his enthusiastic participation
in freshman and school activities; to
feel that he takes an examination
with no expectation that someone
may be cheating against him? It is
only a pity that he cannot keep this
trusting, confiding nature throughout
life.
As for the appearance the fresh
man gives of not being sure of just
where he is going, is it natural for
one to step abruptly into something
new and go about it like a past mas
ter? The change from last year of
high school to first-year college is a
great one, and it is probably advisable
for the freshman to take a good look
around before setting out definitely
in any one direction. Why else should
he be advised to wait two years be
fore choosing his major?
In regard to Mr. O'Meara's brief
mentions of raccoon coats and other
such evidences of the "collegiate" ele
ment, suffice it to say that these ap
ply very well to high-school imitators
and some of our more mature social
hounds, but it is only one more popu
lar fallacy to apply them to freshmen.
Yes, it is great fun to talk to be
talking; but the freshmen enjoy show
ing their initiative in answering back.
