## SUZZALLO FOR PRESIDENT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In event President Wilbur is sip- ,
pointed to 11 position in Hoover's Cabi
net —and of course he will be —we sug
gest for University head Dr. Henry
Suzzallo, deposed executive of the
University of Washington. At Seattle,
Suzzallo held the respect and admira- j
tion of the students with a grasp so
firm that they staged a walk-out when (
he was ejected from office for politi
cal reasons. Practically all the news
papers and the majority of the citi- j
zens of the state rose up in indigna
iion at the dismissal of the man who
transformed Washington from a mere j
state college into one of the great edu- j
cational institutions of the country. 1
The Alumni Association wrote as fol- |

lows:
President Suzzallo is "a man who
. . . in ten years builded a great
university, while keeping the cost per
student lower than at any compar
able institution. The reason for Dr.
Suzzallo's removal was not any lack
of fitness, but that rather his stand
for equal educational opportunities
for all was an obstacle to the Gover
nor's political aspirations."
It is fitting that Suzzallo, a Stan
ford graduate and former Stanford
professor and a man of international
experience and tremendous popularity
should be chief executive of this uni
versity. We should take advantage of
the availability of Washington's
builder to improve our own institu
tion. —Lyman Benson.
