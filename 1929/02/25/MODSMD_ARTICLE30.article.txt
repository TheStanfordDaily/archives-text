# WAR MEMORIAL THEATRE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As a one-time reporter on the Daily
I write to yon to make a suggestion
in regard to the desired new theatre,
which we all hope to see built. If it
proves a practical suggestion it might
help; otherwise, consign it to the edi
torial wastebaslcet.
I note in the President's Report the
item: War Memorial Fund, $117,000
pledged; $85,000 received. Back in
1918-19 when a campaign was made
for this money I remember that the
idea of making a War Memorial Thea
tre was much talked of. Many people

in Palo Alto contributed to this fund,
temporarily used on the Stadium, I
believe, and have since wondered
what became of their money.
If some definite plan has been made
for the Memorial, this is worthless.
But if it has not been decided yet, I
think people would be pleased to see
| the theatre built as a memorial. It
, could be made a very worthy one,
and the theatre would be a much finer
building with such a purpose and
! fund to draw on. Other universities
have done this successfully.
Very sincerely yours,
Dorothy Nichols.
