Phases of English Poetry. By Herbert 1
Read. (New York: Harcourt.
Brace and Company, 1929.) $1.25.
J In this book poetry is traced from
its first and primary raison d' etre.
"the cadence of consenting feet,''
through a phase when it was identi
fied with the community as a whole,
a phase in which the poet was subject
to tradition, a later phase in which
he was free of all tradition but sub
ject to his own sentiments. The au
thor's thesis is that "poetry has de
veloped from the widest possible ap- !
peal to the narrowest possible appeal
—(he poet appealing to himself alone."
He presents the modern poet as one
1 who faces a circle, a completed, for
; bidding circle. The presumption is |
, that "the typical modern poet is aware 1
of the completion of this cycle, and as
a consequence either despairs of his
function or is desperately anxious to ,
' find a way out of the state of eccen- j
: ; tricity."
| The section on modern poetry is the
most gloomy; to read the book with
I the omission of that part would be |
the most, delightful way, for elsewhere
1 the author has treated poetry with a j
; j brief clip in boiling caustic: il emerg
• I es with dull tarnish removed, meticu
, lously polished. The removal of lus
treless coatings of former conceptions
j of the subject, and the return to
1 poetry of some of Its pristine fresh
ness and charm makes "Phases of i

English Poetry" intensely interest
ing.
Poetry for Herbert Read is a living
reality; if it is not living it is not
poetry. This he maintains in his pre
face. He vividly outlines the historical
evolution of poetry, and only becomes
involved to excess in dealing with
modern poetry, where he attempts a
detailed analysis of form and tech
nique to illustrate the fulfilling of the
evolution diagnosed.
When you have finished the book
you should have a reasonably clear
idea of a part of our dynamic litera
ture. That will be Hie dispassionate
result. More than that, however, you
may have a keener sympathy with
those who wander deep into the ob
scurities of the human heart, and a
new love and appreciation for "the
cadence of consenting feet." That, 1
think, is Herbert Read's sincere wish.

The Amateur Spirit in Scholastic
Games and Sports. By Frederick
Rand Rogers. (Albany: C. F. Wil
liams & Son, Inc.)
In starting the movement to give
participants in scholastic sports more I
responsibility and to take much from
the coaches, Frederick Rand Rogers,
Stanford '20, took what John Dewey ,
has called "the greatest advance step !
yet taken in school athletics." In so 1
doing, he called down upon himself j
the wrath of most of the sports ;
coaches of the East, but secured the
support of the prominent educators
of that section.
This little book sets forth the au
thor's observations on amateur ath
letic organizations, presenting his
points of view of fair play, victory, i
competition, and amateurism which
reveal a philosophy of play almost 1
entirely at odds with the commonly
accepted standards. That the youth
of the country shall have "life more
abundantly," Rogers argues for the
reconstruction of teaching methods
and attitudes toward play with a view
to developing character, sportsman
ship, and leadership as well as skill
in the players. The book is written [
in a clear and convincing way and j
should be of interest even to coaches! !
Rogers graduated from Stanford in
1920 and received his M.A. here three !
years later, taking his Ph.D. at Colum- j
bia in 1925. He was later made Direc- j
tor of the Health and Physical Edu- j
cation Division of the New York State
Department of Education and is now
acting in that capacity. He is the son
of Frederick John Rogers, Professor
of Physics. —E. L.
