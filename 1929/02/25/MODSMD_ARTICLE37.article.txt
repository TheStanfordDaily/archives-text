# FROSH TRACK TEAM BUCKLES DOWN FOR PREP SCHOOL MEET
## Babes Are Weak in General Though Outstanding in Numerous Events 
### 
"Dink" Templeton and Bill Elling
ton's Card track babes, who have j
been resting up a bit with the varsity
pquad over the week-end, are buck
ling down again to the very serious :
business of rounding into form for j
their first meet of the season with [
the Southern California High School
All Stars on March 2. Prospects just
at present are not too cheerful, al
though there is a number of outstand
ing stars on hand who will doubtless
furnish good varsity material for next |
year.
The babe coaches are facing a dis
couraging lack of men from which to
shape a formidable running, leaping,
and heaving crew. It looks right now ;
as if there will not be a complete j
team unless more men turn out. Com-1
paratively little new material was un
earthed in the intedclass meet last
Tuesday.
In the sprints the babes are a fast
outfit, with Frank Lombard!, L.A. j
High streak, who has equaled the i
world record of 9:6 in the century, j
and Wayne Ellwood, capable of 10:2 |
in the same race.
Ernie Mendenhall seems to be the !
main hope in the low and high hur
dles. He makes fair time, and should
improve considerably for the import- '
ant meets.
In the quarter- and half-mile the !
babes show unusual power. Francis j
Hay does the quarter in about 51 sec- j
onds, almost cinch time for a frosh
meet; Hammond Nash comes close j
behind him. Walt Cooper's time of
near 2 minutes in the half will prob- |
ably cop several first places during ■
the season.
In the high jump there is a young !
man pitching frosh baseball who in j
another year bids fair to be Bob
King's successor. Without practice,'
and without a well-worked-out form,
E. W. Caddel drops around for the j
frosh meets and clears the bar at six
feet. Bob King sees a famous High-1
jumper in him.
Ned Johnson is attaining great
heights as a pole-vaulter, having gone |
over the top at 12 feet. "Dink" Tem- i
pie ton looks forward to good varsity ;
material in this boy's arms and legs, j
The babes have two outstanding i
performers in the weights, Jerome j
Welch in the javelin, and Grey in the
shot. Welch is alleged to have thrown j
the spear around 180 feet, but in prac- j
tice he averages about 160. George j
Grey heaves the heavy shot 41 feet, j
Rudy Rintala, starring at present I
on the baseball team, will undoubtedly
furnish good material in the weights j
when the baseball season is closed.

ant meets.
In the quarter- and half-mile the !
babes show unusual power. Francis j
Hay does the quarter in about 51 sec- j
onds, almost cinch time for a frosh
meet; Hammond Nash comes close j
behind him. Walt Cooper's time of
near 2 minutes in the half will prob- |
ably cop several first places during ■
the season.
In the high jump there is a young !
man pitching frosh baseball who in j
another year bids fair to be Bob
King's successor. Without practice,'
and without a well-worked-out form,
E. W. Caddel drops around for the j
frosh meets and clears the bar at six
feet. Bob King sees a famous High-1
jumper in him.
Ned Johnson is attaining great
heights as a pole-vaulter, having gone |
over the top at 12 feet. "Dink" Tem- i
pie ton looks forward to good varsity ;
material in this boy's arms and legs, j
The babes have two outstanding i
performers in the weights, Jerome j
Welch in the javelin, and Grey in the
shot. Welch is alleged to have thrown j
the spear around 180 feet, but in prac- j
tice he averages about 160. George j
Grey heaves the heavy shot 41 feet, j
Rudy Rintala, starring at present I
on the baseball team, will undoubtedly
furnish good material in the weights j
when the baseball season is closed.
"Dink" Templeton and Bill Elling
ton's Card track babes, who have j
been resting up a bit with the varsity
pquad over the week-end, are buck
ling down again to the very serious :
business of rounding into form for j
their first meet of the season with [
the Southern California High School
All Stars on March 2. Prospects just
at present are not too cheerful, al
though there is a number of outstand
ing stars on hand who will doubtless
furnish good varsity material for next |
year.
The babe coaches are facing a dis
couraging lack of men from which to
shape a formidable running, leaping,
and heaving crew. It looks right now ;
as if there will not be a complete j
team unless more men turn out. Com-1
paratively little new material was un
earthed in the intedclass meet last
Tuesday.
In the sprints the babes are a fast
outfit, with Frank Lombard!, L.A. j
High streak, who has equaled the i
world record of 9:6 in the century, j
and Wayne Ellwood, capable of 10:2 |
in the same race.
Ernie Mendenhall seems to be the !
main hope in the low and high hur
dles. He makes fair time, and should
improve considerably for the import- '
ant meets.
