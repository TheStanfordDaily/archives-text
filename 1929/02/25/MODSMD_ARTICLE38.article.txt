# Undefeated Frosh Women Battle Soph Cagers Today
## 
### 
The undefeated freshman women's i
basketball team will play the sopho
mores this afternoon at 4 o'clock on
Roble field. Although the frosh are
favored to win because of their pre
vious victories over the junior and !
senior teams, the sophomores have
developed a strong defense which
may influence the final count.
Lack of condition and ragged play-,
ing has been evident in every game
so far, but the squads are rounding,
into mid-season form and are ex- S
pected to display a flashier type of
basketball in the second round of
games. For tomorrow a contest he-
tween the juniors and seniors is >
scheduled.
