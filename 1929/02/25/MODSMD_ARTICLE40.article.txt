# GAS RETAILERS SPLIT SEEMS IMMINENT IN GASOLINE PRICE WAR
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 24.
nite split between organized factions
of gasoline retailers as the outcome
of the "price war" seemed imminent
tonight when Joseph L. Bury, Secre
tary of the Retail Service Station
Dealers' Association, announced that
his association would vote tomorrow
on a resolution proposing to retail
gasoline at cost.
Bury added that efforts to stabilize
the retail price had been obstructed
by the Garage and Property Owners'
Association, which had adopted a
fixed policy of selling one cent below
the price set by the service station
dealers. The garage owners said they
had mapped out their own course, and
would follow it regardless of threats.
The majority of stations quoted
gasoline at 12 and 13 cents today,
with dealers predicting that independ
ent companies would cut the price to
8H or 8 cents tomorrow.
