# EYES OF WOMEN CAN SEE COLORS BETTER THAN THOSE OF MEN

### 
Out of the 1286 men tested for
color-blindness in Encina gym during
the last two years, 106 were found to
be wholly or partially without visual
perception of color. During the same
' period, 436 women were tested, with
| < r.ly one case of color-blindness
! found. These figures were released by
the Psychology department, which
j conducted the test.
The method used was originated by
Dr. Shinobu Ishihara, and differs from
the customary procedure in that
charts with Arabic numerals com
posed of colored dots on a background
l of dots of a contrasting color are used
; to test powers of color differentiation. :
The usual method is the matching of
colored yarns or beads. The new
I method enables the test to determine 1
; the extent of that portion of the re
! Tina which responds to a certain color.
| This is done by placing the charts at
j varying distances from the eye. I
The practical usefulness of these j
tests is being extended by Homer
Craig, student observer, to the cloth
j ing industry. It was found in one or
I two cases of color-blindness that the |
! persons had served very successfully j
in clothing stores. Investigation re

vealed that these persons evidently
based their decisions about fabrics on
ihe brilliancy of the color instead of
Its hue. Many of the larger San Fran
cisco stores have co-operated, and
further developments from the inves
tigation are expected shortly.
