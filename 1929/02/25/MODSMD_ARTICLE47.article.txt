# VARSITY TRACK TEAM PLEASES TEMPLETON IN SPITE OF LOSSES
## Dink Optimistic Over Coming Meet, March 9; Eight Men Lost to Team By RICHARD FRIENDLICH 
### 
Facing the loss of eight lettermen,
four of whom accounted for first
j places in last year's California meet,
the Stanford track squad begins this
week to buckle down to the task of j
| rounding into form for its first meet J
this season, that with the Olympic
! Club on March 9. And Coach "Dink" j
Templeton is facing that task with his
customary optimism, despite the fact
! that last week's interclass meet re- j
vealed glaring weaknesses in several
events.
The loss of Boh King has left the
i Card mentor with only French and !
Austin, neither of whom can better j
six feet, but who may squeeze out a '
i point or two in the Big Meet, if not '
in the nationals. Then there is the
i {-SO, won in the interclass by W. G.
| French in 2:01 1-5. French must clip
; at least two seconds off that mark to ;
figure in the class of competition the !
! Cards must meet this year. The pros
pects in the mile and two-mile events !
j are scarcely more encouraging, al-!
1 though if Alex McKinnon comes Lack j
! to his early-season form of two years !
ago, lie may break through the Cali
j lornia phalanx of Carter, Cherry, and !
Mossman, each capable of 4:80 or :
better. But Loofbourow, like French
| in the half, must improve his inter
class time of 10:05 considerably to (
j place his name in the print column.
To offset these weaknesses Teniple-
I tor. has Eric Krenz, intercollegiate 1
! champion, in the shot and discus;'
Captain Ross Nichols, who holds the
'same title in the high hurdles; two
ten flat sprinters in Hec Dyer and
Johnny-Lauritzen; three broad-jumpers
j capable of better than 23 feet in Zom-
I bro, West, and Dowell; three javelin
I tossers who can beat 185 feet in Spar
ling, Kibby, and Perelli-Minetti; Ward
I Edmonds, a pole-vaulter who consist
! ently approaches world record
heights; and a quarter-miler, Johnny
: Morrison, who has run 49 flat. Add to
these men Berry and Hulsman in
the pole vault, Rotliert and Forster
| in tlie shot, McDermott in the dashes,
j Shove and Syer in the 440, Smith in
i the low barriers, and Edmonds in the
i high sticks, and it is apparent that
| he Cardinals will again be very much
lin tlie running when the national
| championships roll around in May.
