# SPORTS OF 1932
## All Round Rudy 
### BY CARL CARTWRIGHT, '32 
When Rudy Rintala was going to
! Poly High School in San Francisco,
he first gave indication of the remark
able versatility he has displayed here.
The years he was out for major sports,
if put end to end in the proverbial
line, would amount to something like
; leu.
The record Rintala has already es
j tablished on the frosh football and
basketball teams seems to indicate
that he intends to duplicate his for
mer achievements. Early in the foot
bull season he demonstrated himself
to be one of the shiftiest and fastest
open-field runners ever to play on a
fresh team at Stanford.
In the U.S.C. game his work as
| safety and offensive halfback was out
standing. The play in which he re
turned a punt 50 yards through almost
(he entire Trojan team was a feature
of the day. A week later, Rintala's
off-tackle reverse in the Little Big
Game enabled him to break away and

! race 65 yards for a touchdown.
With the opening of basketball sea
! son, one of Captain Phil Baker's best
men was found in Iludy Rintala. His
defensive playing in the Saint Mary's
and Santa Clara games was superb.
In both of the California games, the
Card babes would have been lost
without the scoring threats in Rin
tala's long shots.
Now Rudy has adapted his speedy
football running to baseball, and by
■ combining that with some heavy hit
ling lie is making himself one of the
mainstays of the frosh team. When
Rudy gets under flies at his position
in center field he resembles Frank
Wilton in speed and skill.
Rudy hasn't had much chance to
demonstrate himself in track here,
but judging from his previous prep
school performance he should attract
attention in the high hurdles and shot
put. A four-sport man, if there ever
; was one!
