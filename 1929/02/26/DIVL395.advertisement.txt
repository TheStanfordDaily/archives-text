Would Vote

Gentlemen:
As a constant user of EDGE
WORTH Tobacco for the past four
years, I can say I have enjoyed the
comforts and pleasure of the World's
Finest Tobacco. If EDGEWORTII
were running for re-election, here is
one sure vote for it. Its uniform
quality is the outstanding feature and
I recommend it highly. The EDGE
WORTH Club hour over WRVA
is highly pleasing and helps to form
a good combination.
Fraternally yours,
(Signed) Franklin Montgomery
