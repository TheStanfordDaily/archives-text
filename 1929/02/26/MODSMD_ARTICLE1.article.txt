NANKING, China, Feb. 25. (JP) —
The fighting in Shantung where re
volters under Chang Tsung Chang
have had several clashes with Na
tionalist forces, is receiving the close
attention of the Nanking government
but the situation in Hunan apparently
has become of even greater import
ance.
The Hunan disorders where General
Ho Chun has taken over Changsha
after ousting the Provincial Govern
ment has become the chief matter en
gaging the efforts of the Nationalist
Government leaders. They are under
stood to feel that the situation there
is fraught with grave anti-Nanking
possibilities.
It is felt that the leaders in the
Hunan cities (Hankow, Wuchang, and
Henyang) may be working in con
junction with the Canton government
in an effort to strengthen their old
alliance of opposition to the National
ist government at Nanking.
Leaders here feel that the develop
ments at Changsha indicate the alien
ation of the Province of Hunan from
Nanking toward the Wuhan-Canton
combine.
CHEFOO, China, Feb. 25. (/P)— Re
