! English school," said Warren D. Allen,
j University organist, in speaking of
G. D. Cunningham, England's famouß
concert organist, who gave a recital
yesterday in the Memorial Church.
"Cunningham's rhythm and phras
ing, especially in bis delicate selec
tions, were admirable. In his treat
ment of stops, he obtains more beau
tiful effects than the majority of or
ganists. Considering his recital from
ibis standpoint, I believe that Bach's
'Fugue in 1) Minor* was the best of
the group of selections," Allen de
j(lared.
Tiie English organist gnve a delight
ful, varied, though conservative pro
j f,ram in the seven well-selected pieces,

i "Aria and Variations from a Sym
phony in D."
The richness and brilliance of
Liszt's composition was well portrayed

: execution of runs and in the pedal
| passages. Wolstenholme's "Allegretto
in E Flat" was alive in every move
| ment, and was one of (he most pleas
ing of the program. Franck's "Finale
in B Flat" had difficult passages
\ which were phrased with a fine point
