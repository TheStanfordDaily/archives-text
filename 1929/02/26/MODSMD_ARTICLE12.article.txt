### 
"We are looking for men â€”the same
kind of men that all other industries
are looking for. We want men who
nave good scholarship standings be
cause we know from investigation that
on the average the best scholars go
the farthest in the Bell Telephone
System," was the statement made by
Roy J. Heffner in an address before
75 interested students last night.
Mr. Heffner is the Assistant Educa
tion Directo, of the Bell Telephone
Laboratories of New York and is on
the campus interviewing men who de
sire to enter any of the many
branches of the Bell Telephone Sys
tem.
Mr. Heffner's speech was preceded
by an address by E. M. Calderwood
of the Chief Engineer's Office of the
Pacific Telephone Company and a
Stanford graduate. Calderwood ex- j
plained in detail the various depart
ments of the Bell System but ended ,
by saying, "it doesn't matter much
what department you go into because
you won't amount to much anyway
for the first ten years."
The officials of the Bell Telephone
Company are conducting an extensive
campaign in the various colleges of
the country in an effort to hand-pick
men for the Bell System and are
spending this week at Stanford.
All Stanford men who are interested j
in obtaining either permanent or sum-1
mer employment in the Bell Company
are invited to confer with the com
pany officials who will be in Room
532 from 9 to 12 and 1 to 5 today,
tomorrow, and Thursday.
