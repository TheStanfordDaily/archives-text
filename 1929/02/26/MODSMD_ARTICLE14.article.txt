# NEVER SAUSAGE AN IDEA; NO MORE PIG CHASING REQUESTED
## 
### 
Suffering pigs!
No longer shall they be made
to suffer on the Stanford campus,
if the Santa Clara Board of
Supervisors have their way. That
august body last night voted to
send a letter of protest to Comp
troller Almon E. Roth concern
ing the alleged cruelty to the
greased pig and chickens which
they say were persecuted in the
Irish Marathon and Interclass
track meet last week.
"Spud" Lewis was the one who
downed the porker this year. Sev
eral protests from humane socie
ties have been made in the past
for the same offense against por
cine delicacy.
