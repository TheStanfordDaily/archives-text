# Bailey To Talk About Trip To Europe Tonight
## Had Passage on Freighter From San Francisco To German Port 
### 
Speaking on her experiences as a
traveler, and not on her personal im
pressions of the European countries
t;he visited, Dr. Margery Bailey, of
the English Department, will lecture
this evening at 7:30 o'clock in the
Assembly Hall 011 "An Innocent
Abroad."
Dr. Bailey spent nine months in
Europe last year. Sailing from San
Francisco on a freighter in October
1927, she landed at Hamburg, and
visited three months in the principal
German cities, where she saw many
interesting productions of Shake
speare's plays. From there she went
to Italy, and for two months stayed
at the three main centers â€”Florence,
Ilome, and Naples.
j After two and a half months in the
j historical cities of France, she went
Ito England for two months. It was
j during this trip that she did research
|on eighteenth century literature and
j found the material to write her book
i on Boswell's "Hypochondriack." While
in London, Dr. Bailey made several
short trips to the surrounding towns,
visiting in particular the old universi
ties of Oxford and Cambridge.
In her lecture tonight, Dr. Bailey
intends merely to tell of the experi
ences, many of them general and
others unique to her, which she en
countered while on her travels.
