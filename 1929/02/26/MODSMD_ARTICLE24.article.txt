# Motorized Campus Needs a Garage
## 
### 
One car to every three students living on the campus and one-half
of the car-owners willing to pay five dollars a month to house their cars
in a campus garage should one be built. These are figures obtained from
a survey conducted by the Daily. November 13 last fall the survey was
begun at the instigation of Joe Gordon. It has just been completed.
When consulted at that time on the matter of a campus garage,
Comptroller Roth suggested that this fact-finding survey be made. With
a substantial number of students willing to pay the requisite five dollars
a month for rental, plans to finance and build might be begun.
It is established that there is a substantial number of students on the
campus actively interested in getting the garage. Questions now arise as
to where to build it. If one garage is to be built, the logical place is the
most centrally located, yet this will conflict it is said with architectural
plans laid out for future University expansion. Then architectural plans
did not consider this phase of growth and should lie modified to make
allowance for it.
For growth it is, despite the fathers who tell how they walked three
miles through snow to school when they were lads and now bemoan the
auto-owning of youth today. True, automobiles were curiosities and
extravagances then, but so is a horse now.
A garage once built would be patronized the data obtained proves.
Ky this patronage, it could soon pay for itself. If the simple expedient
of rental of storage proved insufficient, the garage could be leased and
run as a larger money-making business by outside interests.
The need has been established. It is the Administration's move to
fill that need.
