# Dazzling Statistics
## 
### 
The college education in round figures lias been estimated as having
a cash value varying (according to who made the estimate) from $25,000
to $150,000. Niw come more figures on the college education compiled
from Who's Who in America. These figures state that of the 24,278
famous men and women in America listed therein 77.36 per cent have
been on the inside of college walls part time or full time and 63.67 per
cent have received college degrees.
Re-assuring at least is this newest sop to the undergraduate aspiring
to a degree. Chances are seven in ten that if you're in Who's Who some
day, you'll be a college man. Chances are 77.36 per cent of 24,278 in
(quick Watson, how many college graduates are there in America? Let
X do), 77.36 per cent of 24,278 in X that you'll be famous and in Who's
Who. Who's Who'll get you if you don't watch out, little college boy.
Now after all this abracadabra, as to what the cash value of a college
education is and as to what the chances of being famous are for the col
lege man, has been carefully statistized, laid end to end, and spread
around, just how many of the 77.36 per cent of 24,278 would have done
things worthwhile without a college education? The question before the
house, "Can you keep a good man down ?"
The lad that leaves college with these dazzling figures before him
thinking that his A.B. is the open sesame to riches, fame, and a seat be
side the Almighty is headed for a severe tumble. The letters A.1Â»., Ph.D.,
and so on won't be branded across his forehead and if they were the mass
cf people would want to know what they stood for.
It's great to know that college graduates income average up to so
much above the ordinary and to know that the majority of so-called big
people are among the ranks of the college bred, but how about disregard
ing these glorious generalizations and knuckling down to the hard facts
of knowing that the college graduate starts out obviously inexperienced,
and supposedly filled with ideas, with a broader appreciation of the finer
things, and with the brains to stick to and go after what he starts to
achieve ?
