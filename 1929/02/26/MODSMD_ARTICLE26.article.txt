# "Stop Fermentation!"

### 
Stop fermentation and you'll enforce Prohibition, so says a war cor
respondent in a letter to William Randolph 1 learst in Sunday's San
Francisco Examiner. Such is a neat ironical presentation of the im
possibility of Prohibition. Stop the birth of man and you'll stop murder.
lie has put it truly. Once there was temperance. Now there is open
excess and disregard for law. Once there was moderation and strong
public opinion looking down on drinking in its bad features. Now there i
is neither. Yes, all that's needed is the stopping of fermentation to make
Prohibition a fact. In the meantime, poison liquor will continue to dam
age health, poison scofFlawry will continue to damage the public morale,
and the present regime of national hypocrisy will continue to reign.
"IT IS A SAD reflection on the limitations of intellectuals and artists
all over the world to see history repeat itself in the contemptuous re
sentment with which they are greeting the arrival of the talking picture."
The Nation, idol of all liberals and intellectuals alike, scorches its own
ilk in this manner on that touchy current question, the talkie. It might
be that fifty years from now when the first three dimensional, colored,
talking pictures are produced that the same thing will be said of these
same scoffers. I tut such is the thorny path, all new things must travel
even among the "intellectuals."
THE REGULAR MEETING of the editorial staff will be held today
