# The 						Bullsession
## REVENGE NOT CORRECTION! 
### 
Hysteria has once more disturbed
the more or less periodic calm of
Californians. Nothing now remains
but the punishment of the person who
kidnapped little Doris Smith-Murphy,
and during this calm it is noticeable
that not one constructive thought ap
peared in the tens of thousands of 1
words written for the Press on the j
case.
"Fiend abducts child!" screamed
the headlines. "Death to the culprit,
thumbs down!" howled a supposedly
enlightened public opinion. First it
was Hickman, then Northcott, and
now we have just passed through the 1
Smitli-Murpliy panic. Hysteria and
emotionalism rock the whole Nation ,
until the blood of the perpetrator
smears out his crime. Then with ap
peased conscience, the State and the
general public settle back into smug
complacency. Justice has been done.
The public has had its periodic shud
der, newspaper publishers have been
enriched, and all is well once more. |
But has justice been achieved? Ac
cording to the ancient code of Ham
murabi, dated 2300 8.C., perhaps it
has. Materially we have gone far in
the forty-two centuries since the en
actment of the great Babylonian so
cial code, but to all appearances we
have not altered the social concepts
of the remote past. Blood for blood,
an eye for an eye, is still our chosen
mode of social control. Not even Rome
at the height of her glory could stage
the gorgeous spectacles to which we j
are periodically treated by the Ameri- !
can Press.

| Apparently not a single San Fran
i cisco newspaper took a constructive
j step in regards to the case which
j spread terror in the city and sent
circulation figures soaring. The Press
is commonly regarded as the leader
of public sentiment, but in a crisis
! such as the recent one, journalistic
j intelligence is seemingly reduced to
the least common denominator of the
mob mind.
Six thousand dollars for the punish
ment of the criminal, not one cent fur
the prevention of repetitions in the
future! Anyone with the instincts of
i a human being could not possibly
frown upon a reward for the return
I of little Doris to her parents. But an
intelligent public opinion should de
mand as well a study of these cases
by trained psychologists and sociolo
| gists. This latter phase of our social
problems we have failed to adequate
ly provide for.
Sociologically we are left-handed.
Our handling of things material is
envied, if not admired, the world
over, but as social engineers we are
the laughing stock of civilization. The
reward which totalled nearly six thou
sand dollars for the return of Doris
and the ultimate punishment of her
captor was sentimentally laudable,
but a similar contribution as a founda
tion for a fund for the scientific study
of the social conditions producing in
dividuals capable of committing such
crimes would be more to the point
I and mark a truly enlightened public
! opinion and a constructive Press.

Hysteria has once more disturbed
the more or less periodic calm of
Californians. Nothing now remains
but the punishment of the person who
kidnapped little Doris Smith-Murphy,
and during this calm it is noticeable
that not one constructive thought ap
peared in the tens of thousands of 1
words written for the Press on the j
case.
"Fiend abducts child!" screamed
the headlines. "Death to the culprit,
thumbs down!" howled a supposedly
enlightened public opinion. First it
was Hickman, then Northcott, and
now we have just passed through the 1
Smitli-Murpliy panic. Hysteria and
emotionalism rock the whole Nation ,
until the blood of the perpetrator
smears out his crime. Then with ap
peased conscience, the State and the
general public settle back into smug
complacency. Justice has been done.
The public has had its periodic shud
der, newspaper publishers have been
enriched, and all is well once more. |
But has justice been achieved? Ac
cording to the ancient code of Ham
murabi, dated 2300 8.C., perhaps it
has. Materially we have gone far in
the forty-two centuries since the en
actment of the great Babylonian so
cial code, but to all appearances we
have not altered the social concepts
of the remote past. Blood for blood,
an eye for an eye, is still our chosen
mode of social control. Not even Rome
at the height of her glory could stage
the gorgeous spectacles to which we j
are periodically treated by the Ameri- !
can Press.

| Apparently not a single San Fran
i cisco newspaper took a constructive
j step in regards to the case which
j spread terror in the city and sent
circulation figures soaring. The Press
is commonly regarded as the leader
of public sentiment, but in a crisis
! such as the recent one, journalistic
j intelligence is seemingly reduced to
the least common denominator of the
mob mind.
Six thousand dollars for the punish
ment of the criminal, not one cent fur
the prevention of repetitions in the
future! Anyone with the instincts of
i a human being could not possibly
frown upon a reward for the return
I of little Doris to her parents. But an
