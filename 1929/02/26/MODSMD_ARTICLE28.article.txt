An Anthology of World Poetry. Edited
by Mark Van Doren. (New York:
Albert & Charles Boni. $5.)
I have not hail in my hands all year
a book that I recommend more highly
for your library. This is not merely
"another anthology," nor is it a dry
compilation of "representative poetry."
In Mr. Van Doren's own words, "This
is an anthology of the world's best
poetry in the best English I could
unearth, and when I found no good
English at all I left th(- poet out."
Practically all of us are interested
in books, at least to a certain extent,
and most of us take pride in the nu
cleus of a library that we are gather
ing now. The trite and time-worn
phrase, "treasure chest," was never
more fittingly used than when it is
applied to what, lies between the ;
covers of this anthology of poetry. j
The scope, in measure of time, of
"An Anthology of World Poetry" is
from the thirty-fifth century B.C. to :
the twentieth century A.D. In space !
it extends from China and Japan i
around through India, Persia, Arabia, j
Palestine, Egypt, Greece, and Rome
to Europe and America.
There is no poet in human history ;
who might not have found a place in
it had he ever fallen into the hands :
of a becoming translator. For no j
translations have been included 1111-:
less they seemed to their editor beau-!
tiful poems in their English render- j
ings. Thus, the emphasis has been (
placed on the quality of the transla-!
tions and the translators.
And offhand, there comes to mind ;
no man better fitted to do the deli
cate but tremendous task of making
such a collection than Mark Van
Doren. He is not only a poet of high j
rank, but he is a superlatively able i
critic. Many a good poet is utterly in
capable of criticizing or evaluating
the work of others, and many a keen
critic is entirely lacking in creative
ability. It is the combination of the
two faculties in Mr. Van Doren that I
makes him the logical person to editj
a volume that "must take its place '
among standard anthologies as indis-'
pensible to every library and poetry
lover."
Another common fault of antholo
gies has been thoroughly avoided by
Mi 1 . Van Doren. In works of this type 1
there is always a tendency for any '
particular selection to become buried i
in sheer mass of material. You can
never find what you want when you
want it. But emphatically not so in
this case. A more "useable" anthology
would he hard to imagine.
To make this volume easy to use
there is a complete table of contents
as well as full indexes. The arrange
ment is by countries, or rather by
languages, and within each section
the order of poets is chronological, ;
the name of the translator being given
at the end of each poem in parent he- j
sis. In addition, there are four indexes j
in the back of the book: An index of
first lines, an index of titles, an index
ot authors, and an index of trans
lators.
There is surely an intangible power
wielded by IHOO pages of the best
poetry in the world. I hope I haven't
fallen too completely under its spell,
and as a result become too enthusi
astic. Since this might have hap
pened, I leave you with only one,
final pleading word —go inside the
next book store you pass and pick up

i "An Anthology of World Poetry," run
| your fingers through the pages, read
j a few verses at random, and "decide
' for yourself." —Clifford F. Weigle.
A word on "Roaring Tom."
Two decidedly able seamen have
just written the life story of one of
the most fascinating old sea-dogs of
! history. His name is Admiral Thomas
i Cochrane, but readers of the new
' biographical romance, "Cochrane the
; Unconquerable," are inclined to call
I him just plain "Roaring Tom."
Archibald D. Turnbull, ex-comman
i der of the U.S. Navy and author of
| tte recent biography, "John Stevens:
| An American Record," and Lt.-Com
mander Norman R. Van der Veer are
, the authors of this book. Both of them
confess quite frankly that they were
| drawn to Cochrane while studying the
history of naval warfare at the U.S.
! Naval Academy at Annapolis years
I ago. Mr. Turnbull steps forward to
| speak in behalf of the collaboration:
j "Cochrane proved to be a fascinat
: ing subject both for a popular yarn
and for a study in naval tactics. ]Ie
| 'got away with' so many extraordi
, nary exploits that the Spaniards,
| thinking him bewitched, called him
El Diablo, but he wasn't just plain
| reckless. Fearless he was, an adven
; turer and a swashbuckler and at times
!an unbelievable bluffer, but all his
I attacks were shrewdly and carefully
j planned. His combination of Scotch
| canniness with the nerve and claws
j of a wildcat made him a man hard
! to beat —and an easy one to write
about.
