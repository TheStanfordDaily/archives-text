Tickets for "The Wild Duck"
will be on sale at 1 o'clock today
in front of the Women's Club
house and at Keeble's in Palo
Alto for $1 and $1.25.

Although "The Wild Duck," to be ;
presented in the Assembly Hall Fri- j
day evening, combines many different j
tempos and moods, for sheer bril
liance and drama the first act has sel
dom been surpassed. The scene is
laid in the ornate drawing room of a
wealthy Norwegian merchant, imme
diately following a dinner party given
by his housekeeper. Seventeen men
are on the stage, and only one woman,
and, in the mist of this assemblage,
a son deliberately snubs his father.
Portraying the intimate connections j
of two families, the English Club play j
offers an exceedingly diversified 1
range of characterizations, but it is ;
in the first act that the contrasts of i
characters and castes are most vividly j
shown.
Jeanette Owens Plays Widow
Mrs. Sorby, played by Jeanette i
Owens, is a pretty widow who keeps j
house for Werle, the mine owner, por- j
trayed by Robert Catlicart. Nine of
his friends have been invited to the ]
dinner party, and it is their smug, ;
gossip-seeking interplay of remarks
that makes a background, reminiscent
of the social satire of Sinclair Lewis,
against which the dramatic lines of
young Greger Werle (Stanley Mullin)
and Hjalmar Ekdal (Tom Henry) |
stand out.
As Ibsen wrote the play, only three i
of the dinner guests speak, but Gor- 1
don Davis, to heighten the effect of a j
social affair, has distributed the lines \
to all the men, so that the spirit of 1
casual repartee is emphasized. The
nine distinguished, middle-aged guests
are played by James Bednar, David
Finch, Donald Fletcher, Alan Good-1
speed, Frank McCaughna, Jack Nutt,!
Fred Olsen, Paul Pfaff, and Scott
Webster.
