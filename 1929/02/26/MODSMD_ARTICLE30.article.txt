## WINNERS IN 1930? 
### 
The 1929 basketball season, as far j
as Stanford is concerned, ended Sat-j
urday night at the Oakland Audi
torium when the Cards fell before |
the onslaught of the Golden Bear for
the third straight time this season.
Regardless of the fact that our rival
across the bay ran away with the
court honors again this year, Card
supporters should be encouraged
rather than downhearted over the |
team's showing during the past sea- |
son. Even to be nestled in second |
place seems unusual after so many ]
years of mediocre basketball teams. j
At the beginning of the season ,
it looked as though Coach Husky
Hunt was going to do the impos
sible and mould a group of young
men, who had never played to
gether before, into an unbeatable
quintet. As time went on and the
Cards continued to win ball
games, several by startling come- (
backs, people began to wonder if
Coach Hunt had really achieved
the answer to every coach's
prayer, the perfect combination.
With a perfect record for the
new year,«the Redshirts entered
the first game of the Big Series
on practically even terms with
the Bears. It was the big test.
During the first period the Cards
put up a great fight, and left the
court at half time with a one
point lead. Supporters of the
Cardinal began to hope for vic
tory, but these hopes were dim
med to extinction soon after the
beginning of the second period.
The Californians came back with
a rush, and by the time the smoke
of battle had cleared away, were
leading by nearly twenty points.
This, of course, was a great disap- :
pointment to the team, which was
composed, with the exception of two [
men, of sophomores and juniors. And
people did not seem to realize that
the Bears boasted a veteran outfit.
One outstanding weakness, the team ;
did find in that game, was its inability :
to make free throws. Up till that time
free-throw practice had been taken
sort of half-heartedly, but after that
contest, Coach Hunt had little trouble j
in getting his charges to work at this.
In the second game of the Big
Series on February 8, the Cards made j
their final bid for Southern Division
honors. Although they played a great
defensive game, and held the Bears
to a single field boal during the sec
ond period, they were unable to over
come the experienced quintet of the
visitors and lost 19 to 17.
Last Saturday they dropped the
third contest of the series to the
Californians to climax the season.
Outside of these three contests
the Cards won all their Confer
ence games, and all non-confer
ence tilts played this year, with
the exception of St. Ignatius.
The pre-eminent weakness of
the Card quintet rested in its in
ability to make free throws. In
the nine Conference games played
during the season, the team made
only fifty-two out of a possible
one hundred and thirty-five free
throws. Tyler had the best per
centage with ten out of a pos
sible twenty-two.
In the case of free throws, practice
did not seem to make perfect, for the
last game played was the worst in !
this respect. Against the Bears in
this game, Stanford converted only :
four out of a possible fourteen at- j
tempts. Their first game with the
same opponents was almost as bad
when they made only seven out of
twenty-four.
Vance Fawcett, mainstay of the
Card offense, was high-point man for
the Conference season with a total of j
fifty-two points. Tyler and Hawkins
tied for second-place honors with a
total of thirty-two points apiece.
Next year should be a big year
for the Redshirts in this sport.
The same men who played this
year will return, and in addition
there will be men from this year's
freshman squad. Shrader, Ray,
and Kelly should push Fawcett,
Berg, and Tyler for their posi
tions at the offensive end of the
court. Bill Doub, if he plays as
he did this year, ought to make a
place for himself on the 1930 var
sity without much trouble, at
least McCandless and Hawkins
will find a tough job on their
hands when they face this big
southpaw next year.
Phil Baker and Rudy Rintala
may give the varsity defense men
a big surprise if they display
their customary speed and aggres
siveness. The latter, especially,
may be called upon, for judging
by performances of the varsity
this season, the team needs speed
on the break and in getting down
the floor, and Rintala is perfectly
capable of supplying this.
All in all —Stanford, according to
present indications, should have a
great hoop squad in 1930. But if Card
supporters are forced to offer excuses
for the team's showing next year, an
investigation should be in order,
