### BY PHILIP SPACE 
NOW THAT this column has been
absent for some clays we stride for
ward to correct several common falla
cies as we return. (There ought not
to he a joke about "Through pleas
ures and fallacies though we may
roam.") "The Return of Philip Space."
Very dramatic. "Much-Sought Wit lie
covered from Death Door." "Space,
Encina guest, stricken."
In the foist place, this column isn't
written by a lot of guys, a different
one each day. In the second place, it i
is not turned out by Dr. Wilbur, so its
absence was not explained hv the fact
that the president left for the East.
In the third place it is not anonymous.
Pliilip Space is a real nerson; only
the name is anonymous. In the fourth
place will the fellow who cast the
at-persion from the fifth floor of En
cina come sweep it up, as it broke
all over the road?
"The tongs are ended hut the mem
cry lingers on." Therefore, we pre

SIX SUGGESTIONS FOR
STUFFING THE BALLOT BOX |
I—Write on one side of the paper,
legibly, with a margin of one and
one-half inches.
2—Do not use pencil, because that
would tempt the election board.
3—Put your ballots in the right box,
if you can find it.
4—Vote the straight ticket. Do not
scratch your ballot.
s—Don't give your right name.
6 —Engage the clerk in conversa
tion, then put your hat over a stack
of ballots, place it carefully on the
head, and casually stroll away, being
careful to thank the clerk for having
such a good time.
NOTE: Suggestion No. fi is for fac
ulty members only, since students
don't wear hats. The student is ad
vised to approach the clerks and then
suddenly cry — "LOOK AT THE
BEAUTIFUL CO-EI)!!!!' While the
clerks are jumping up and down on
the table, biting their nails, and kick
ing ballots all about in a pretty mess,

scoop up an armful, and mark them
at your leisure. It ia best, of course,
to have a mail-sack, else the load may
become bulky.
That no student may set writer's
cramp this department will conduct
a special ballot marking stand on the
Quad. Watch for it.
Now, 1 A.S.S.U. very confidentially
be very careful after this—the fate
of our most prominent politicians
hangs in the ballots.

Not an invalid; just awfully sick.

tics and other phases of Italian life.
