# NEVERS LACKS ONLY PITCHING EXPERIENCE SAYS 'RED' KILLEFER
## Mission Club Manager Sees Real Baseball Ability In Cook Sypher 
### Stephen Dietrich 
"I look for Ernie Nevers to make
good in baseball," said Wade "Red"
Killefer, manager of the Mission
Ccast League Ball Club, in an inter
view last week-end at the Mission's
training camp in Stockton. "He has
the stuff all right. All he needs is a
lot of pitching experience to develop
into a first-class chucker."
Killefer thinks that Nevers, who is
a regular member of the Mission
pitching staff, went up to the big
leagues too early. A player just out
of college needs to be toned up a bit
before he can land a regular berth
on a major league team. The red
headed boss smiled optimistically as
he added, "I look for Nevers to go
back to the major leagues before
long."
Sypher Does Well
Cook Sypher, captain of Stanford's
baseball team last year and who is at
the spring camp in Stockton, has also
attracted Killefer's attention. "Sypher
is handicapped a little by size, but
he is a peppy catcher with all kinds
of punch."
"Cookie," as Sypher is called by
fellow ball-players, is considered as
the Missions' "champion chatter." He
can out-talk anyone else on the ball
club, with the exception of "Shine"
Scott, huge and dusky trainer.
Baseball is not dying out in col
lege, according to Killifer. "It is mere
ly going through a slump. They
haven't got the facilities nowadays,
and consequently the boys don't take
as much interest in baseball as they
did. Baseball was the leading sport,
when I was a student at Michigan
some years ago."
Baseball Still National Sport
When asked whether tennis or
some other branch of athletics would
ever take the place of baseball as
the national sport, Killefer answered
in Ihe negative. "No, 1 think not.
Tennis and hockey are coming to the
front rapidly, but they will never sup
plant baseball."
The Mission manager is a great
believer in developing young players.
"There are big possibilities in the
establishment of baseball schools.
These schools would be along the line
of Warner's and Rockne's football
courses —to train young players in
the off-season. This would not only
develop new rookies, but would tend
to improve the game as a whole."

some other branch of athletics would
ever take the place of baseball as
the national sport, Killefer answered
in Ihe negative. "No, 1 think not.
Tennis and hockey are coming to the
front rapidly, but they will never sup
plant baseball."
The Mission manager is a great
believer in developing young players.
"There are big possibilities in the
establishment of baseball schools.
These schools would be along the line
of Warner's and Rockne's football
courses —to train young players in
the off-season. This would not only
develop new rookies, but would tend
to improve the game as a whole."
"I look for Ernie Nevers to make
good in baseball," said Wade "Red"
Killefer, manager of the Mission
Ccast League Ball Club, in an inter
view last week-end at the Mission's
training camp in Stockton. "He has
the stuff all right. All he needs is a
lot of pitching experience to develop
into a first-class chucker."
Killefer thinks that Nevers, who is
a regular member of the Mission
pitching staff, went up to the big
leagues too early. A player just out
of college needs to be toned up a bit
before he can land a regular berth
on a major league team. The red
headed boss smiled optimistically as
he added, "I look for Nevers to go
back to the major leagues before
long."
Sypher Does Well
Cook Sypher, captain of Stanford's
baseball team last year and who is at
the spring camp in Stockton, has also
attracted Killefer's attention. "Sypher
is handicapped a little by size, but
he is a peppy catcher with all kinds
of punch."
"Cookie," as Sypher is called by
fellow ball-players, is considered as
the Missions' "champion chatter." He
can out-talk anyone else on the ball
club, with the exception of "Shine"
Scott, huge and dusky trainer.
Baseball is not dying out in col
lege, according to Killifer. "It is mere
ly going through a slump. They
haven't got the facilities nowadays,
and consequently the boys don't take
as much interest in baseball as they
did. Baseball was the leading sport,
when I was a student at Michigan
some years ago."
Baseball Still National Sport
When asked whether tennis or
some other branch of athletics would
ever take the place of baseball as
the national sport, Killefer answered
in Ihe negative. "No, 1 think not.
