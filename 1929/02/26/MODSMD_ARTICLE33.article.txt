# SPORTS OF 1929
## Low Scores in Golf 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Much interest was aroused recently
by "Wild Bill" Mehlhorn's 271 in the
Texas Open at El Paso, and it was
claimed by some that this was a new
world's record over an 18-hole course
of standard length. Leo Diegel, how
ever, had a 270 at Coronado Beach
pome years ago. George Duncan's 263
in the "Open championship of the
Lucerne Lakes" is not to be taken
too seriously, as the first 36 holes, at
Axent'els, were played over a 5,000-
yard layout.
Even the high-strung Scot's 118 for
36 holes has been beaten, but on an
all short-hole course. T. S. Hardie, in
recording his 93 at the Bruntsfield
Links, got a 1, thirteen 2's, and twen
ty-two 3's! How do you like that, you
duffers who only shoot IS holes in
118!
That lovable character and marvel
ous golfer, John Black, is the only
man to "break 60" for 18 holes on the
Claremont Club course in California
on June 18, 1914. Harry Cooper shot a
60 in a practice round at Dallas,
Texas, in 1925. Various foreign golf
ers, among them James Braid, Colin
Aylmer, Eugene Lafitte, and H. Hard
man have all done better than 60,
either in a match or in practice. R. H.

i Corbett's nine successive 3's were
made in the semi-final of the Tangye
Cup at Mullim in 1916.
Glenna Collett shot a 75 in the 1925
Women's National championship at
St. Louis. Maureen Orcutt lias a 76
to her credit at White Beeches, N.J.
Johnny Farrell, U.S. Open champion,
finished with a 63 to win the 1928
LaGorce Open with 274 strokes. He
Mimed in another 63 in Detroit last
August, and another at Quaker Ridge
in 1925. Dick Walsh shot a 63 at Van
Cortlandt Park, N.Y., and Bill Glancy
a 62 at Spring Brook.
