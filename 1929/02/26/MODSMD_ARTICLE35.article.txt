# STANFORD BOXERS TO FACE TOUGH BATTLE IN BEAR TOURNAMENT
## 
### John Isaacs 
Stanford boxers face a tough eve
ning Thursday night when Coach
Stanley Jones will bring his Berkeley
fighters to the "farm" for the first of
the two Bear-Card boxing tourna
ments scheduled for this season. The
California team is flushed with its re
cent victory over the California Ag
gies. Stanford won from the Aggies,
too, but IJ.C. copped six out of seven
bouts while Stanford took only four.
George Sherwood, the only Berke
leyite to lose to the Mustangs, has an
imposing record as a K.O. artist. He
! flattened Danny Frost in one round
I last vear. In fact, he knocked out
i
i every man he faced last season with
i ihe exception of one.
Coach Jones Confident
I Coach Jones is not at all backward
| in declaring that he has one of the
I greatest teams that the East Bay in
| stitution has ever seen. Heading the
i squad is Captain Frank Ribbel, twice
: Pacific Intercollegiate champion in
j the welterweight division. Competing
i with Ribbel for the spotlight on the
! Blue and Gold team is Ted Beckett,
| who spends the autumn playing a
j guard position for Nibs Price and is
| now fighting in the heavyweight class.
! This is Beckett's first year but lie
I has developed rapidly. Ted carries a
j knockout in either fist and is cer
tain to cause plenty of trouble for
Captain Ed Dillon of Stanford.
In the meantime, Harry Maloney
i has been keeping his charges working
at top speed. Heavy workouts have
I been in order all last week and will
j continue until tonight. Over the holi
days Maloney substituted many miles
of roadwork for his men in place of
! regular practices. Under the triple
| tutelage of Maloney, Assistant Coach
! Mvron Schall, and George Dawson of
I Los Angeles, the Cardinal squad has
developed an unusual amount of
; scientific fistic ability for a college
| aggregation. Maloney is enthusiastic
j over the condition of the team, and
I is not the least dismayed at the for
! midable lineup of California.
