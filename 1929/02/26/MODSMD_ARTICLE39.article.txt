# CARDINAL BASEBALL TEAM SHOWS WELL IN SEMI-PRO GAMES
## Have Won Three Contests From Highly Touted Winter Leaguers 
### 
If Stanford's varsity baseball team
would play the brand of ball against
the League teams that it has ex
hibited against semi-pro organiza
tions this season, it would undoubt
edly emerge on top of the heap. So
far the Cards have lost three contests
in the California Intercollegiate Base
ball League, but have decisively
whipped three highly rated Winter
.League teams.
Against the Keneally Seals last
Saturday the Redshirts played flaw
less ball despite the fact that two
regulars were missing from the line
up. Chuck Smalling allowed the pro
fessionals ten hits, but he kept them
well-scattered and thfe Seals scored
but three runs. The Stanford batters
collected eleven safe blows and tal
lied four times.
The victory over the Seals was
more impressive in that the San Fran
cisco team shut out the University
of California last week, letting the
Bears down with but two hits. The
win was also a measure of revenge
for the Cards for the 9 to 0 defeat
handed them by the Keneally Seals
last year.
Friday the varsity dropped its sec
ond game to Santa Clara in a slow
and uninteresting contest that was
marred by many bad throws and
errors. Gene Kern pitched a good
brand of ball against the Broncs, but
tailed to receive any support from his
infield. Stanford made two more hits
than the Mission College boys, but
was downed by a (J to 3 count. In the
first meeting of these teams, the var
sity garnered twice as many hits as
the Broncos, but lost the game when
its pitchers failed to fiud the plate.
