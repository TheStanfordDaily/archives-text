ous of renting a conveniently located
garage at the rate of $5 per month.

I
I it was found that out of the 2110
students living on the campus G54 j

I of these, 346 wanted garages.
The fraternity group of men have
; the most cars per man, there being
316 automobiles in that group of 623

i two men. The men's dormitory group
| is next with one car to every four
! met.
| The Stanford women show a lower
I average in comparison to the men.
! The sorority group has about one car
to every three women but the hall
i group only has one car to every ten.
Further figures concerning the
