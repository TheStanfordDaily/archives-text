# FRESHMEN OF MILLS COLLEGE DOWN 1932 CARD DEBATE SQUAD
## Women Declare Censorship Of the Press Is Linked With Autocracy 
### 
i
Presenting their arguments like j
veterans, the freshman women of j
{ Mills College defeated the Stanford ,
freshman debate team last night at '
i the Little Theatre by a margin of !
I thirteen votes.
The question was, "Resolved, That j
newspaper reports of criminal cases j
| should be censored by the state." Two ;
votes were taken in the audience; one
j before the debate, and one at the
i close of the arguments. The winning
team was the team that was success
j ful in changing the most opinions.
Mary Nelier and Eetty Allison, the |
Mills debaters for the negative, cen- j
j tered their case about the warning
! value of the press to the people in
the apprehension of criminals and
I made the point that censorship would [
I abridge the liberty that our fore- '
j lathers fought for. They linked cen
sorship of the press with autocracy, j
! and freedom of the press with demo
cracy.
James Bothwell and August Frug6, I
| who upheld the affirmative for Stan- j
ford, argued that the criminally mind
!ed person ik encouraged to more j
crime by the type of reports that are j
,at present featured in the news- (
' papers and that such publicity is ad
! vertising for the criminal. They ar- j
gued against the distortion of facts
: that every literate man must read in !
i his paper, with the result that the only |
: persons that have not formed opin- ;
j ions on most cases by the time the i
: trials come up are the illiterate. This
j fact, the Stanford debaters pointed
out, makes the illiterate and the ig
norant people the only ones that may
! be legally sworn in on juries.
The debate was interesting and was j
i closely contested. The Mills debaters I
were both charming young ladies who j
j showed a very keen appreciation of ,
humor, and caused much laughter i
! with remarks made in their rebuttal
' arguments. Frug6 and Bothwell
showed considerable ability at an
j swering the arguments of their op
ponents in the rebuttal talks, and i
were especially efficient at answering j
tiie questions directed at them from j
j the floor after the debate.
