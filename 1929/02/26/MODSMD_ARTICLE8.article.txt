## Caddell and McLean Will Divide Pitching Duties; Evans, Dixon Catch 
### Bob Ricklefs 
In what promises to be the hardest
game of the season, outside of the
contests with the California Cubs,
j Stanford's freshman baseball team
j will meet the fast San Jose Teachers
i nine this afternoon at 3:30 o'clock on
j the frosh diamond. The Teachers are
; a hard-hitting, well-coached team, and
are certain to give the frosh pitchers j
\ plenty of trouble.
Coach Husky Hunt will start Cad- j
! del on the mound for the Card babes â– 
! but McLean is certain to work part j
lof the game. Each man pitched and ;
| won a ball game over the week-end. {
On Friday, McLean kept the Berkeley |
high-school swatters well in hand, and j
on Saturday, Cad del struck out 18 !
| men in a phenomenal performance I
j against the San Mateo Junior College i
! outfit. Catching duties will be divided 1
, between Evans and Dixon, with the !
| former getting the first call.
Last night in a practice tilt with j
I the varsity scrubs, the frosh displayed j
| a ragged brand of baseball and took j
a bad trouncing. Spencer did most of <
| the chucking for the babes and '
| showed up well despite the poor sup
! port of his teammates. Fox and Marks
alternated at first base and both j
! fielded inconsistently. Fox, who has I
been playing in right field most of j
! the season, may work at the initial
j f.ack for a few innings this afternoon, j
i The remainder of the infield will be
| composed of Barsumian at second, j
; White at short, and Kelly at third, j
! ltintala, Waterman, Griggs, and Fox J
I will see action in the outfield.
