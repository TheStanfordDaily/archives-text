# FLOODS RAVAGE OHIO HOMES AS RESIDENTS FLEE
## Cold Weather Expected to Control Perilous Rain Swollen Streams 
### 
COLUMBUS, 0., Feb. 26. (/P)â€” Cold
weather tonight was expected to
check the rampages of rain-swelled
rivers and streams that flooded sever
al sections of the state today, driving
thousands from their homes, imperil
ing the lives of many and causing
considerable damage everywhere.
Scores of persons were rescued
from precarious places where the flood
had driven them. No loss of life was
reported.
The thawing streams, augmented by
rainfall and melting snow, overflowed
their banks and sent their waters
pouring into a dozen cities and towns.
Highways were flooded clear across
tlia southern section of the state.
Springfield was hardest hit. The
waters of Buck Creek and Mad River
crippled almost all of that city's in
dustries, flooded the business section
and paralyzed traction and railroad
service.
Hundreds of persons living in the
Buck Creek Valley were rescued by
city rowboats after they attracted at
tention by shooting guns and ringing
bells. Two of the three pumps at the
waterworks, put out of commission
by the high waters, were back in oper
ation tonight and electric service was
again available.
