# Card, Gael Nines Meet Here Today In Second Game
## Taylor or Simkins to Start on Mound for Redshirts; Berg May Field 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
will meet the St. Mary's College nine
here this afternoon at 3:15 o'clock on
the varsity diamond. This is the sec
ond meeting of the two teams this
season, the Saints winning the first
contest by a 9 to 3 count.
The Gael team is one of the strong
esr outfits in the California Intercolle
giate Baseball Association. It is com
posed entirely of veterans, and has
four consistent pitchers as well as a
trio of good catchers. Rooney, at first
base, is a powerful hitter and a neat
fielder.
Against the Cards last Saturday the
Saints nine made fourteen safe hits,
including four doubles. Last season
Stanford won the series from the
Gaels, and might repeat this year if
her pitchers can hold the Moraga slug
gers.
Simkins or Taylor to Start
Either Taylor or Simkins will start
on the mound today for the Iled
sbirts. Both are speed ball pitchers
and have a large assortment of curves
as well. Taylor should make one of
the best chuckers on the squad if he
can overcome a tendency to be wild.
Simkins has turned in some good per
formances this year, and with a little
more experience will be a valuable
man to the team. Spud Hardy, the
gabby little backstop, will hold down
the receiving position today.
If the Cards can play the brand of
ball this afternoon that they exhibited
against the Keneally Seals Saturday,
lliey should take the Saints. In the
game with the semi-pros, the Red
sliirts nicked the opposing pitchers
for eleven safeties, but last week Con
lin, the Gael moundsman, held the
varsity sluggers to three hits.
Berg May Play
Captain Frank Wilton has been
turning in some neat performances in
the outfield, as well as distinguishing
himself at the plate. Hunken is also
a good fielder, but has not been up
to his usual form at the platter. Harry
Btrg may start in the third outfield
position today. Berg is a real ball
player and can play well at any posi
tion on the diamond.
Ralph Cook will be back in the line
up after a week's absence due to ill
ness. Cook is first-baseman and clean
up batter on the team. Churchill,
Johnson, and Laird will hold down the
other three infield positions.

against the Keneally Seals Saturday,
lliey should take the Saints. In the
game with the semi-pros, the Red
sliirts nicked the opposing pitchers
for eleven safeties, but last week Con
lin, the Gael moundsman, held the
varsity sluggers to three hits.
Berg May Play
Captain Frank Wilton has been
turning in some neat performances in
the outfield, as well as distinguishing
himself at the plate. Hunken is also
a good fielder, but has not been up
to his usual form at the platter. Harry
Btrg may start in the third outfield
position today. Berg is a real ball
player and can play well at any posi
tion on the diamond.
Ralph Cook will be back in the line
up after a week's absence due to ill
ness. Cook is first-baseman and clean
up batter on the team. Churchill,
Johnson, and Laird will hold down the
other three infield positions.
Stanford's varsity baseball team
will meet the St. Mary's College nine
here this afternoon at 3:15 o'clock on
the varsity diamond. This is the sec
ond meeting of the two teams this
season, the Saints winning the first
contest by a 9 to 3 count.
The Gael team is one of the strong
esr outfits in the California Intercolle
giate Baseball Association. It is com
posed entirely of veterans, and has
four consistent pitchers as well as a
trio of good catchers. Rooney, at first
base, is a powerful hitter and a neat
fielder.
Against the Cards last Saturday the
Saints nine made fourteen safe hits,
including four doubles. Last season
Stanford won the series from the
Gaels, and might repeat this year if
her pitchers can hold the Moraga slug
gers.
Simkins or Taylor to Start
Either Taylor or Simkins will start
on the mound today for the Iled
sbirts. Both are speed ball pitchers
and have a large assortment of curves
as well. Taylor should make one of
the best chuckers on the squad if he
can overcome a tendency to be wild.
Simkins has turned in some good per
formances this year, and with a little
more experience will be a valuable
man to the team. Spud Hardy, the
gabby little backstop, will hold down
the receiving position today.
If the Cards can play the brand of
ball this afternoon that they exhibited
against the Keneally Seals Saturday,
lliey should take the Saints. In the
game with the semi-pros, the Red
sliirts nicked the opposing pitchers
for eleven safeties, but last week Con
