# Presentation Of "The Wild Duck" Held Honor To Campus Dramatics

Outside of the Pasadena Communi
i ity Players' production of "The Wild
Duck" last fall, the Stanford presen
tation of the greatest of Henrik Ib
-1 sen's drama will probably be the only
| opportunity which coast audiences
will have had to see it before the
i Ibsen Centenary ends March 20.
Throughout the world since last
; spring, many of his plays have been
< given in honor of the celebration of
his birth, but most of the attention
j has centered on his more popular
! playsâ€”"Ghosts" and "A Doll Bouse."
| "The Wild Duck" was given a long
j New York run last year, but on the
Pacific Coast Ibsen performances
have been few and far between, and
the campus production Friday night
in the Assembly Hall will be one of
the few times which local audiences
will have to enjoy this play.
Although most critics believe that
; "The Wild Duck" is Ibsen's best play,
! it is seldom produced because of the
difficulties which it presents, and that
Gordon Davis should have selected it
' for an amateur presentation is a com
pliment to Stanford dramatics. For
characterizations, this play shows
nearly every side of life. It includes
every ago from a fourteen-year-old
girl to a senile grandfather; it shows

! every caste from the oppressed ser
i vant to the domineering captain of
industry; and it captures every emo
tion from blind idealistic fervor to
the crudities of sex.
Ibsen has been noted, and often
maligned, for the symbolism he put
; into his plays, yet in "The Wild
I Duck" there is such an exact balance
| of the symbolic and the realistic that
j the drama may be interpreted in
either light. Seldom has a play been
written which shows so realistically
the characters of two families and
i the situations Into which they thrust
themselves, yet, at the same time, al
though it is never a dominant note,
there is an interweaving of symbolism
which raises the play above a mere
recital of human fatalities to a great
interpretation of humanity.
Though the drama should be called
i a tragedy, at the same time there is
a subtle strain of humor whitfh runs
through the lines and saves the play
from becoming a dull account of
' tragic events. It is this counter-balanc
| ing of humor and tragedy, of realism
and symbolism, which has given "The
Wild Duck" the reputation of being
j the greatest of Ibsen dramas, but. at
; tlie same time, these very tlinigs
which make it great also make it the
| most difficult to produce effectively.
