# DR. BAILEY PLEASES AUDIENCE WITH TALE OF EUROPEAN TRAVEL
## 
### 
"I went to Europe not to learn
about the civilization or to gather
facts, hut I went to enjoy myself, and
I did." And to an equal extent did the
audience in the Assembly Hall last
night enjoy Dr. Margery Bailey's de
scription of her travels as "an inno
cent abroad."
Dr. Bailey told of her trip in an
interesting way, combining her im
pressions, vividly told, with a refresh
ing touch of humor which appealed
stionglv to her audience. She pic
tured herself in her cape which she
described as making her look like a
second murderer in a Shakespearian
play. She sailed on a freighter through
the Panama Canal, touched the Virgin
Islands, and landed at Hamburg,
which she spoke of as a city "which
had always been herself, belonging
to the world rather than to a nation."
The so-called "glories of Rome" did
not move her at all, while she could
not resist the charm of Paris which
she had determined to dislike.
On her return trip, Dr. Bailey stop
ped at New Orleans, but it was not
until she passed the Arizona deserts
that she began to feel the hard sharp
ness of America. It was, however,
when she saw the Los Angeles signs
of "Preserve Your Health," "Eat Corn
Flakes to Preserve Your Constitu
tion," "Long Life," that she realized
she was home. "In Europe they don't
worry about those things, concluded
Dr. Bailey.
