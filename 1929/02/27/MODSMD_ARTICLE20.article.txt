# DEFINITE PLAN IS ANNOUNCED FOR UNIVERSITY GOLF COURSE
## Beautiful 18-Hole Links To Be Constructed on Campus by Famous Course Architect Building Work To Commence At Once If B.A.C. Okehs Plan for Financing Project 
### Leonard Bartlett 
I Stanford's proposed golf course, so
j long a myth, is at last to become a
| reality.
j Vital steps toward the construction
i of an 18-hole campus golf links were
| taken yesterday when Almon E. Roth,
! comptroller, announced that William
noli, nationally famous golf architect,
| has been engaged by the University
i to make preliminary plans for a Stan
| ford course.
I The Board of Athletic Control has
j authorized A1 Masters, graduate man
j ager, to investigate the situation and
report on the advisability of building
the course. If Masters submits a fa
jvorable report and the B.A.C. decides
|to furnish the finances immediately,
: Stanford students will be swinging
! their mashies next year on what may
jbo the best collegiate course in the
j nation.
Land Reserved
The Board of Trustees has set aside
125 acres of land near the old stock
i yards and along the country road near
i the old Lathrop home. The holes are
1 to be placed near the stock farm build
; ings along the lake, and then to Roble
' creek. The second nine holes will be
| laid on a section of land west of the
j county road, continuing westward be
| yond the Lathrop home. A variety of
' topography and natural hazards is
| presented.
William Bell will reach the campus
| Monday to examine the proposed sites
for the course and submit preliminary
: plans. With him will be associated
Charles F. Thomas, Jr., author of
! "Golf Architecture in America," an
I outstanding manual on the construc-
I tion of golf courses.
Bell and Thomas have designed
practically all the famous golf courses
in Southern California, among which
| are the Bel-Air, Riviera, La Cumbra,
and Los Angeles Athletic Club courses.
Natural Hazards
It is the opinion of Comptroller
Roth that the proposed course will be
one of the best and most beautiful
; golfing greens in the nation. With its
j oaks, streams, and natural hazards,
! the Stanford course will rival the fa
| mous Yale golf links in beauty and
j playing facilities, it is the opinion of
! Roth.
The water question, one of the golf
' course's main impediments, has now
been practically solved, Roth indi
j cated. Plans will soon be completed
, for the enlargement of Felt Lake to
fourteen times its present size. The
larger lake will provide an additional
j 2.800,000 gallons of water and will
| practically double the University's
i present supply of irrigation water.
[The growth of the campus has made
| the increased water supply impera
tive, Roth said.

[The growth of the campus has made

tive, Roth said.
I Stanford's proposed golf course, so
j long a myth, is at last to become a
| reality.
j Vital steps toward the construction
i of an 18-hole campus golf links were
| taken yesterday when Almon E. Roth,
! comptroller, announced that William
noli, nationally famous golf architect,
| has been engaged by the University
i to make preliminary plans for a Stan
| ford course.
I The Board of Athletic Control has
j authorized A1 Masters, graduate man
j ager, to investigate the situation and
report on the advisability of building
the course. If Masters submits a fa
jvorable report and the B.A.C. decides
|to furnish the finances immediately,
: Stanford students will be swinging
! their mashies next year on what may
jbo the best collegiate course in the
j nation.
Land Reserved
The Board of Trustees has set aside
125 acres of land near the old stock
i yards and along the country road near
i the old Lathrop home. The holes are
1 to be placed near the stock farm build
; ings along the lake, and then to Roble
' creek. The second nine holes will be
| laid on a section of land west of the
j county road, continuing westward be
| yond the Lathrop home. A variety of
' topography and natural hazards is
| presented.
William Bell will reach the campus
| Monday to examine the proposed sites
for the course and submit preliminary
: plans. With him will be associated
Charles F. Thomas, Jr., author of
! "Golf Architecture in America," an
I outstanding manual on the construc-
I tion of golf courses.
Bell and Thomas have designed
practically all the famous golf courses
in Southern California, among which
| are the Bel-Air, Riviera, La Cumbra,
and Los Angeles Athletic Club courses.
Natural Hazards
It is the opinion of Comptroller
Roth that the proposed course will be
one of the best and most beautiful
; golfing greens in the nation. With its
j oaks, streams, and natural hazards,
! the Stanford course will rival the fa
| mous Yale golf links in beauty and
j playing facilities, it is the opinion of
! Roth.
The water question, one of the golf
' course's main impediments, has now
been practically solved, Roth indi
j cated. Plans will soon be completed
, for the enlargement of Felt Lake to
fourteen times its present size. The
larger lake will provide an additional
j 2.800,000 gallons of water and will
| practically double the University's
i present supply of irrigation water.
