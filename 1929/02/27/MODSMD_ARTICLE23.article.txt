# All-University Golf Nears Actuality

One of the finest golf courses in the country!
A possibility has become a fairly certain probability.
One hundred twenty-five acres of rolling land shaded with many a
live oak, almost a natural golf course in itself, has been set aside by
the Board of Trustees for a golf course.
Water, vital necessity of golf link health, will be obtained by devidlis
route from nearby Felt Lake upon the installation of a new pipe.
And the latest news, William Bell and Charles F. Thomas, Jr., golf
course architects of national repute and 110 mean accomplishments, will
arrive 011 the campus to have plans for the links laid out in black and
white by the twelfth of the month.
A worthy cause, championed these many moons by golf enthusiasts,
sees its realization nearing.
Damnitall, think of all those spring quarter resolutions to be made
by future Stanford men and to be lost in the rush of driving, putting,
and chasing the elusive par. Here is found another excellent argument
for the maintaining of the Lower Division; freshmen would make such
fine caddies.
Seriously though, aside from the droves of Bobbie Joneses, \\ alter
Hagens, and Johnny Farrels that will be turned out 011 that new course,
golf will become an institution among the general student body well
worth its salt. Any sport that will actively interest a goodly majority
cf the student body is worth more than any number of wonder teams.
Teams will profit by it, but the general run of students, those indi
viduals who take exercise as a Lower Division requirement and cease
exercise thereafter, will have it presented them on a golden spoon and
can't refuse it.
Fore! Stanford is about to add another priceless feature to its
already matchless campus.
