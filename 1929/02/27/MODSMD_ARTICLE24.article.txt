# The
						Garage Leaps to the Near Future
## 
### 
The immediate future is the nearest to solution the campus automo
bile housing problem can be brought. \\ hat with the rush of present
proposed improvements, the complexity of deciding where to locate a
garage and the means of financing it, the problem waits Administration
action, and will wait at least a year.
The question was presented to the Daily last fall. Consultation with
Comptroller Roth at that time revealed that definite facts on the demand
for a garage were not at hand. The Daily began a survey to ascertain
this demand then and has just completed it. Yesterday's story on the
matter revealed the startling fact that there is one car to every three
students on the campus alone. It also revealed that one-half of this
auto-owning plutocracy desires a garage to the point of paying five
dollars a month for it.
Today a second consultation with Air. Roth brought the problem a
step nearer solution. Mr. Roth gave every assurance that a garage would
be built in the near future. He pointed out the difficulties facing its con
struction.
Plans for University growth do not include a garage. However these
plans were made before the present era of a motorized campus. The
University will make room for a garage in future plans.
The matter of financing it c;m be solved as has been pointed out by
leasing the building to outside interests or by making it pay for itself
under University management.
The problem of location is a drawback now. A place near Halls and
Row is hard to find. In the future when the Row moves to new dormi
tories near the present ones a location central to all will be easily found
and decided on.
For the present there are two alternatives, a temporary garage built
near both Row and Halls or a permanent one to be built near the Halls
and in this way near the Halls and the Row of the future. And neither
of these can be built for a year; however, the Administration is acting.
