# The
						Honor Code in Bombay
## 
### 
Tliis matter of the Honor Code is one of serious ethical consideration
in Bombay.
Two hundred fifty book-perusing students of that city listed their
choice of the ten deadliest sins. Strange sins are they in the eyes of Oc
cident Americans. Eating cow's flesh, failing to educate the girls of
one's family, forging a signature, giving a bribe to an official, refusing to
marry at one's father's command, shooting a horse which has a broken
leg, striking a disobedient servant in anger, telling a lie to save a friend
from punishment, and traveling by train without a ticket, these are nine
of the cardinal vices, but heading this unusual category in deadliness is
copying during a college examination.
Dreadful apple-polishing is this or else education is a matter of life
and death and highly coveted in that land. American students might well
ponder this.
