Birth Control Laws. Shall We Keep
Them, Change Them, or Abolish
Them? By Mary Ware Dennett.
(New York: Frederick H. Hitch
cock. $2.50.)
"Let us not, in the twentieth cen
tury, burn as a heretic one who is
simply telling us the truth!"
This is the strongly appealing sen
tence that ended the editorial in a
"Daily" of last week which showed
the absurdity of bringing to trial, on
a charge of having distributed obscene
literature through the mails, Mary
Ware Dennett, author of an educa
tional sex primer, "The Sex Side of
Life."
And now a book by the same Mrs.
Dennett is being reviewed. "Birth
Control Laws" is the result of a sane,
searching analysis of the whole prob
lem. Mary Ware Dennett has the dis
tinction of being the one who first
brought the Birth Control question to
Congress. She does not consider the
problem from the point of view of a
lanatical reformer, but as one who
has had years of humanizing experi
ence in social welfare activities.
The purpose of the book is best
outlined by the author herself: "The
scope of this book does not include
any general discussion of the merits
of birth control, or its sociological and
racial ramifications. That has been
amply undertaken in recent years by
many able people. But what does need
further discussion and thinking
through to a sound conclusion is the
question as to whether laws affecting
birth control are necessary in the
United States, and if so, just what
the provisions of those laws should
be.
We have laws on the subject al
ready, and have had them —the same
ones —for over fifty years. They are
increasingly unenforced, and are gen
erally acknowledged to be unenforce
able. But it is not wise to await their
slow and complete dissolution from
disuse. The question is shall they be
done away with altogether, or shall
they be modified, and if so, how?"
The author handles these questions
capably and logically. She first shows
what sort of laws we now have, and
how they came into being through the
work of that super-blunderer, Anthony
Comstock. The second part of the
book takes up the changes that have
been proposed, while the third divi
sion goes into the problem of what
sort of laws the people really want
and how they can get them. The only
book of its sort, this is worthwhile.

Elizabeth and Essex. Lytton Strachey.
(New York: Harcourt, Brace and
Company, 1926.)
Volumes have been written about
Elizabeth of England in endless num
ber about every phase of her charac
ter, her life, and her reign. The sub
ject should have been pretty well cov
ered by now. Yet in this biography
by Strachey, the world sees a new
figure—a great sovereign, but first of
all a woman, and a woman that the
world did not dream of before.
A mere account of the exploits and
achievements of this queen, who in
many respects was the most extraor
dinary woman in would alone

be sufficient to hold any reader's in
terest. Straehey reveals in his book
a matchless sense of the movement
and color, and the high spots that
characterize her life. But the quality
of the book that makes it so outstand
ing is his portrayal of the Elizabeth
underneath.
Only Strachey's own splendid words i
can give a fair idea of what the bio
graphy holds from this angle; lie
writes in part, "Under the serried
complexities of her raiment —the huge
lioop, the stiff ruff, the swollen
sleeves, the powdered pearls, the
spreading, gilded gauzes—the form of
the woman vanished, and men saw
instead an image—magnificent, por
tentious, self-created —an image of re
gality, which yet, by a miracle, was
actually alive. Posterity has suffered
by a similar deceit of vision. The |
great Queen of its imagination, the;
lion-hearted heroine, who flung back ,
the insolence of Spain and crushed
the tyranny of Rome with splendid j
unhesitating gestures, no more resem
bles the Queen of fact than the j
clothed Elizabeth the naked one. But
after all, posterity is privileged. Let
us draw nearer; we shall do no wrong
now to that Majesty if we look below
the robes ....
"The fierce old hen sat still, brood
ing over the English nation, whose
pullulating energies were coming
swiftly to ripeness and unity under
her wings. She sat still; but every
feather bristled; she was tremen
dously alive
"Her superabundant vigor was at j
once alarming and delightful. She
swore; she spat; she struck with her i
j fist when she was angry; she roared
with laughter when she was amused.
.... Her response to every stimulus
was immediate and rich: to the folly
of the moment, to the clash and hor
i ror of great events, her soul leapt out
! with a vivacity, an abandonment, a
complete awareness of the situation, j
which made her, which makes her
still, a fascinating spectacle."
Straehey does full justice to the
queen. In his portrayal he profoundly
j admires her without having the slight
est reverence for her. What he want
, ed to find, and to write was the truth, j
| and this he does, whether at the price 1
: of delicacy or not.
The book is not a complete bio
graphy. Straehey deals only with the
interrelationship of the lives of Eliza
i belli and the Earl of Essex, and in
the opening chapter, the queen is 53,
! while the earl is not yet 20. Here
begins their incredible romance. Un
der Strachey's pen the unparalleled
human interest —as well as the mag
nificent drama of these two lives so
strangely interwoven —opens before
I the reader.
Hardly less remarkable or less fast i-,
nating are the portraits he gives us j
i of the other famous figures of the
j time —Robert Cecil, Francis Bacon,
; Philip of Spain. The author's superb
handling of characters and events
i would give almost anyone a taste for
history, for "Elizabeth and Essex" is
a book that can bear being read and
re-read —being opened at random and
read for an hour on one of these dull
evenings when a magazine would

Birth Control Laws. Shall We Keep
Them, Change Them, or Abolish
Them? By Mary Ware Dennett.
(New York: Frederick H. Hitch
cock. $2.50.)
"Let us not, in the twentieth cen
tury, burn as a heretic one who is
simply telling us the truth!"
This is the strongly appealing sen
tence that ended the editorial in a
"Daily" of last week which showed
the absurdity of bringing to trial, on
a charge of having distributed obscene
literature through the mails, Mary
Ware Dennett, author of an educa
tional sex primer, "The Sex Side of
Life."
And now a book by the same Mrs.
Dennett is being reviewed. "Birth
Control Laws" is the result of a sane,
searching analysis of the whole prob
lem. Mary Ware Dennett has the dis
tinction of being the one who first
brought the Birth Control question to
Congress. She does not consider the
problem from the point of view of a
lanatical reformer, but as one who
has had years of humanizing experi
ence in social welfare activities.
The purpose of the book is best
outlined by the author herself: "The
scope of this book does not include
any general discussion of the merits
of birth control, or its sociological and
racial ramifications. That has been
amply undertaken in recent years by
many able people. But what does need
further discussion and thinking
through to a sound conclusion is the
question as to whether laws affecting
birth control are necessary in the
United States, and if so, just what
the provisions of those laws should
be.
We have laws on the subject al
ready, and have had them —the same
ones —for over fifty years. They are
increasingly unenforced, and are gen
erally acknowledged to be unenforce
able. But it is not wise to await their
slow and complete dissolution from
disuse. The question is shall they be
done away with altogether, or shall
they be modified, and if so, how?"
The author handles these questions
capably and logically. She first shows
what sort of laws we now have, and
how they came into being through the
work of that super-blunderer, Anthony
Comstock. The second part of the
book takes up the changes that have
been proposed, while the third divi
sion goes into the problem of what
sort of laws the people really want
and how they can get them. The only
book of its sort, this is worthwhile.

Elizabeth and Essex. Lytton Strachey.
(New York: Harcourt, Brace and
Company, 1926.)
Volumes have been written about
Elizabeth of England in endless num
ber about every phase of her charac
ter, her life, and her reign. The sub
ject should have been pretty well cov
ered by now. Yet in this biography
by Strachey, the world sees a new
figure—a great sovereign, but first of
all a woman, and a woman that the
world did not dream of before.
A mere account of the exploits and
achievements of this queen, who in
many respects was the most extraor
dinary woman in would alone

be sufficient to hold any reader's in
terest. Straehey reveals in his book
a matchless sense of the movement
and color, and the high spots that
characterize her life. But the quality
of the book that makes it so outstand
ing is his portrayal of the Elizabeth
underneath.
Only Strachey's own splendid words i
can give a fair idea of what the bio
graphy holds from this angle; lie
writes in part, "Under the serried
complexities of her raiment —the huge
lioop, the stiff ruff, the swollen
sleeves, the powdered pearls, the
spreading, gilded gauzes—the form of
the woman vanished, and men saw
instead an image—magnificent, por
tentious, self-created —an image of re
gality, which yet, by a miracle, was
actually alive. Posterity has suffered
by a similar deceit of vision. The |
great Queen of its imagination, the;
lion-hearted heroine, who flung back ,
the insolence of Spain and crushed
the tyranny of Rome with splendid j
unhesitating gestures, no more resem
bles the Queen of fact than the j
clothed Elizabeth the naked one. But
after all, posterity is privileged. Let
us draw nearer; we shall do no wrong
now to that Majesty if we look below
the robes ....
"The fierce old hen sat still, brood
ing over the English nation, whose
pullulating energies were coming
swiftly to ripeness and unity under
her wings. She sat still; but every
feather bristled; she was tremen
dously alive
"Her superabundant vigor was at j
once alarming and delightful. She
swore; she spat; she struck with her i
j fist when she was angry; she roared
with laughter when she was amused.
.... Her response to every stimulus
was immediate and rich: to the folly
of the moment, to the clash and hor
i ror of great events, her soul leapt out
! with a vivacity, an abandonment, a
complete awareness of the situation, j
which made her, which makes her
still, a fascinating spectacle."
Straehey does full justice to the
queen. In his portrayal he profoundly
j admires her without having the slight
est reverence for her. What he want
, ed to find, and to write was the truth, j
| and this he does, whether at the price 1
: of delicacy or not.
The book is not a complete bio
graphy. Straehey deals only with the
interrelationship of the lives of Eliza
i belli and the Earl of Essex, and in
the opening chapter, the queen is 53,
! while the earl is not yet 20. Here
begins their incredible romance. Un
der Strachey's pen the unparalleled
human interest —as well as the mag
nificent drama of these two lives so
strangely interwoven —opens before
I the reader.
Hardly less remarkable or less fast i-,
nating are the portraits he gives us j
i of the other famous figures of the
j time —Robert Cecil, Francis Bacon,
; Philip of Spain. The author's superb
handling of characters and events
i would give almost anyone a taste for

Birth Control Laws. Shall We Keep
Them, Change Them, or Abolish
Them? By Mary Ware Dennett.
(New York: Frederick H. Hitch
cock. $2.50.)
"Let us not, in the twentieth cen
tury, burn as a heretic one who is
simply telling us the truth!"
This is the strongly appealing sen
tence that ended the editorial in a
"Daily" of last week which showed
the absurdity of bringing to trial, on
a charge of having distributed obscene
literature through the mails, Mary
Ware Dennett, author of an educa
tional sex primer, "The Sex Side of
Life."
And now a book by the same Mrs.
Dennett is being reviewed. "Birth
Control Laws" is the result of a sane,
searching analysis of the whole prob
lem. Mary Ware Dennett has the dis
tinction of being the one who first
brought the Birth Control question to
Congress. She does not consider the
problem from the point of view of a
lanatical reformer, but as one who
has had years of humanizing experi
ence in social welfare activities.
The purpose of the book is best
outlined by the author herself: "The
scope of this book does not include
any general discussion of the merits
of birth control, or its sociological and
racial ramifications. That has been
amply undertaken in recent years by
many able people. But what does need
further discussion and thinking
through to a sound conclusion is the
question as to whether laws affecting
birth control are necessary in the
United States, and if so, just what
the provisions of those laws should
be.
We have laws on the subject al
ready, and have had them —the same
ones —for over fifty years. They are
increasingly unenforced, and are gen
erally acknowledged to be unenforce
able. But it is not wise to await their
slow and complete dissolution from
disuse. The question is shall they be
done away with altogether, or shall
they be modified, and if so, how?"
The author handles these questions
capably and logically. She first shows
what sort of laws we now have, and
how they came into being through the
work of that super-blunderer, Anthony
Comstock. The second part of the
book takes up the changes that have
been proposed, while the third divi
sion goes into the problem of what
sort of laws the people really want
and how they can get them. The only
book of its sort, this is worthwhile.

Elizabeth and Essex. Lytton Strachey.
(New York: Harcourt, Brace and
Company, 1926.)
Volumes have been written about
Elizabeth of England in endless num
ber about every phase of her charac
ter, her life, and her reign. The sub
ject should have been pretty well cov
ered by now. Yet in this biography
by Strachey, the world sees a new
figure—a great sovereign, but first of
all a woman, and a woman that the
world did not dream of before.
A mere account of the exploits and
achievements of this queen, who in
many respects was the most extraor
dinary woman in would alone

be sufficient to hold any reader's in
terest. Straehey reveals in his book
a matchless sense of the movement
and color, and the high spots that
characterize her life. But the quality
of the book that makes it so outstand
ing is his portrayal of the Elizabeth
underneath.
Only Strachey's own splendid words i
can give a fair idea of what the bio
graphy holds from this angle; lie
writes in part, "Under the serried
complexities of her raiment —the huge
lioop, the stiff ruff, the swollen
sleeves, the powdered pearls, the
spreading, gilded gauzes—the form of
the woman vanished, and men saw
instead an image—magnificent, por
tentious, self-created —an image of re
gality, which yet, by a miracle, was
actually alive. Posterity has suffered
by a similar deceit of vision. The |
great Queen of its imagination, the;
lion-hearted heroine, who flung back ,
the insolence of Spain and crushed
the tyranny of Rome with splendid j
unhesitating gestures, no more resem
bles the Queen of fact than the j
clothed Elizabeth the naked one. But
after all, posterity is privileged. Let
us draw nearer; we shall do no wrong
now to that Majesty if we look below
the robes ....
"The fierce old hen sat still, brood
ing over the English nation, whose
pullulating energies were coming
swiftly to ripeness and unity under
her wings. She sat still; but every
feather bristled; she was tremen
dously alive
"Her superabundant vigor was at j
once alarming and delightful. She
swore; she spat; she struck with her i
j fist when she was angry; she roared
with laughter when she was amused.
.... Her response to every stimulus
was immediate and rich: to the folly
of the moment, to the clash and hor
i ror of great events, her soul leapt out
! with a vivacity, an abandonment, a
complete awareness of the situation, j
which made her, which makes her
still, a fascinating spectacle."
Straehey does full justice to the
queen. In his portrayal he profoundly
j admires her without having the slight
est reverence for her. What he want
, ed to find, and to write was the truth, j
| and this he does, whether at the price 1
: of delicacy or not.
The book is not a complete bio
graphy. Straehey deals only with the
interrelationship of the lives of Eliza
i belli and the Earl of Essex, and in
the opening chapter, the queen is 53,
! while the earl is not yet 20. Here
begins their incredible romance. Un
der Strachey's pen the unparalleled
human interest —as well as the mag
nificent drama of these two lives so
strangely interwoven —opens before
I the reader.
Hardly less remarkable or less fast i-,

Birth Control Laws. Shall We Keep
Them, Change Them, or Abolish
Them? By Mary Ware Dennett.
(New York: Frederick H. Hitch
cock. $2.50.)
"Let us not, in the twentieth cen
tury, burn as a heretic one who is
simply telling us the truth!"
This is the strongly appealing sen
tence that ended the editorial in a
"Daily" of last week which showed
the absurdity of bringing to trial, on
a charge of having distributed obscene
literature through the mails, Mary
Ware Dennett, author of an educa
tional sex primer, "The Sex Side of
Life."
And now a book by the same Mrs.
Dennett is being reviewed. "Birth
Control Laws" is the result of a sane,
searching analysis of the whole prob
lem. Mary Ware Dennett has the dis
tinction of being the one who first
brought the Birth Control question to
Congress. She does not consider the
problem from the point of view of a
lanatical reformer, but as one who
has had years of humanizing experi
ence in social welfare activities.
The purpose of the book is best
outlined by the author herself: "The
scope of this book does not include
any general discussion of the merits
of birth control, or its sociological and
racial ramifications. That has been
amply undertaken in recent years by
many able people. But what does need
further discussion and thinking
through to a sound conclusion is the
question as to whether laws affecting
birth control are necessary in the
United States, and if so, just what
the provisions of those laws should
be.
We have laws on the subject al
ready, and have had them —the same
ones —for over fifty years. They are
increasingly unenforced, and are gen
erally acknowledged to be unenforce
able. But it is not wise to await their
slow and complete dissolution from
disuse. The question is shall they be
done away with altogether, or shall
they be modified, and if so, how?"
The author handles these questions
capably and logically. She first shows
what sort of laws we now have, and
how they came into being through the
work of that super-blunderer, Anthony
Comstock. The second part of the
book takes up the changes that have
been proposed, while the third divi
sion goes into the problem of what
sort of laws the people really want
and how they can get them. The only
book of its sort, this is worthwhile.

Elizabeth and Essex. Lytton Strachey.
(New York: Harcourt, Brace and
Company, 1926.)
Volumes have been written about
Elizabeth of England in endless num
ber about every phase of her charac
ter, her life, and her reign. The sub
ject should have been pretty well cov
ered by now. Yet in this biography
by Strachey, the world sees a new
figure—a great sovereign, but first of
all a woman, and a woman that the
world did not dream of before.
A mere account of the exploits and
achievements of this queen, who in
many respects was the most extraor
dinary woman in would alone

be sufficient to hold any reader's in
terest. Straehey reveals in his book
a matchless sense of the movement
and color, and the high spots that
characterize her life. But the quality
of the book that makes it so outstand
ing is his portrayal of the Elizabeth
underneath.
Only Strachey's own splendid words i
can give a fair idea of what the bio
graphy holds from this angle; lie
writes in part, "Under the serried
complexities of her raiment —the huge
lioop, the stiff ruff, the swollen
sleeves, the powdered pearls, the
spreading, gilded gauzes—the form of
the woman vanished, and men saw
instead an image—magnificent, por
tentious, self-created —an image of re
gality, which yet, by a miracle, was
actually alive. Posterity has suffered
by a similar deceit of vision. The |
great Queen of its imagination, the;
lion-hearted heroine, who flung back ,
the insolence of Spain and crushed
the tyranny of Rome with splendid j
unhesitating gestures, no more resem
bles the Queen of fact than the j
clothed Elizabeth the naked one. But
after all, posterity is privileged. Let
us draw nearer; we shall do no wrong
now to that Majesty if we look below
the robes ....
"The fierce old hen sat still, brood
ing over the English nation, whose
pullulating energies were coming
swiftly to ripeness and unity under
her wings. She sat still; but every
feather bristled; she was tremen
dously alive
"Her superabundant vigor was at j
once alarming and delightful. She
swore; she spat; she struck with her i
j fist when she was angry; she roared
with laughter when she was amused.
.... Her response to every stimulus
was immediate and rich: to the folly
of the moment, to the clash and hor
i ror of great events, her soul leapt out
! with a vivacity, an abandonment, a
complete awareness of the situation, j
which made her, which makes her
still, a fascinating spectacle."
Straehey does full justice to the
queen. In his portrayal he profoundly
j admires her without having the slight
est reverence for her. What he want
, ed to find, and to write was the truth, j
| and this he does, whether at the price 1
: of delicacy or not.
The book is not a complete bio
graphy. Straehey deals only with the
interrelationship of the lives of Eliza
i belli and the Earl of Essex, and in
the opening chapter, the queen is 53,
! while the earl is not yet 20. Here
begins their incredible romance. Un
der Strachey's pen the unparalleled
human interest —as well as the mag
nificent drama of these two lives so
strangely interwoven —opens before
I the reader.
