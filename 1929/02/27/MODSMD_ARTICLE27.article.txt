The Editor, Sir:
I do not agree with the attitude
taken by the writer of "The Open
House" editorial printed in the Fresh
man number of the Daily for Febru- \
ary 25th. In the editorial the writer :
states, "From the freshman point of \
view is would be just as well if the ;
open house system were abolished
forever." This statement is followed
up by a description of the bewildered
freshman visiting the Row, and con-;
eludes by saying that all the fresh-1
man gets from this is a group of j
superficial friendships.
I should say that from the fresh
man point of view a distinct advan
tage was gained as a result of the
action of the Interfraternity Council
in sponsoring the open house Sun- j
days. The freshmen Who visited the
Row were able to formulate a definite I
and unbiased opinion of the houses,
and they were able to tell pretty ac- i
curately the general character of the I
fellows that they met in the various
individual living groups.
Last year, the freshmen had no op- i
portunity to get a clear picture of

the fraternity question until the rush
ing was actually over. The freshmen !
this year ought to feel gratified that <
a system for pre-acquaintance was
established. The freshman, having
sen the houses, and having formed
his opinion on them, is better pre
pared to make his final choice of a ;
house if he intends to pledge.
Let those who would criticize the j
open house system propose something
superior to the present system, rather j
than criticize in a destructive man- j
ner. I remain, very truly yours,
Robinson, '32.
