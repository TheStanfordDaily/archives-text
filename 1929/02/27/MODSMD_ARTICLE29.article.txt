Story from the Chronicle —
"Among those at the luncheon
were Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt
Whitney, who wore pajamas of
yellow; Mrs. James Forrestal,
and Mrs. Philip Barry Leslie,
whose attire was vari-colored."
Why all the silence about Mrs.
James Forrestal?
IT IS JUST BARELY POSSIBLE—
Of course you've heard the one
about the fat man who went around
all day with his shoo lace untied. A
friend finally accosted him, and asked
the explanation. "Why don't you tie
your shoe-lace?" he asked. "It's been
trailing all day."
"Oh," said the fat gent, "the spirit
is willing but the pants are weak."
Moronia thinks the B.A.C. is the
public exercises committee.
