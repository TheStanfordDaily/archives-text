# SPORTS OF 1929
## Wide—And Handsome 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Not so long ago in Madison Square
| Garden, New York, both Paavo Nur
mi, of Finland, and Edvin Wide, of
Sweden, competed in the Millrose
Games —but in separate events. Track j
| Cans are anxious to see these two in
action together at two miles or 5,000 :
meters, and on the form displayed the
; night of February Dth, when Nurmi j
lost to Ray Conger and Wide won a
!
two-mile handicap with a blood-stir
ring burst of speed at the finish, the
Swede would beat the Finn. It was
heard on all sides that Nurmi wasn't

the smooth runner of 1924 and '25,
while Wide was running with more
rhythm, power, and speed than ever
before.
Those of us who were lucky to see
Nurmi, Ritola ,and Wide in the 5,000
and 10,000 meter runs at the Amster
dam Olympics, will never forget their
harmonious action, smooth, clock-like
strides, and the way the three out
distanced and lapped the rest of the
field so easily that they seemed a
trio of automatons or supermen op
posed to a lot of tyros. Wide was
third in both those races, while Nurmi
won the longer and Ritola the shorter.
Willie Ritola is in training, and
Leo Lermond, who was fourth in the
5,000 meters at Amsterdam, is com
peting regularly and running very
well. Let's hope the four get together
and put on a replica of their Olympic
race. If they do —and they may at the
Knights of Columbus game in New
York on March 1G —it is my opinion
that this time Edvin Wide of Sweden
will be the victor.
