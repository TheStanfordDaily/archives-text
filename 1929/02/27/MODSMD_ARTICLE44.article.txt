# LIMITED SIZE HANDICAPS BROADCAST OF MOVIES SAYS PROFESSOR TERMAN

### James H. Myers 
Radio broadcasting of motion pic
tures is now limited to a picture
two feet square, according to Pro
fessor Frederick E. Terman of the
Electrical Engineering department,
who believes that radio television will
never supplant the regular broadcast
programs because of the limitations
in size and quality of the pictures
tri; nsmitted.
"Using all the available frequencies,
a band some 30,000,000 cycles wide, a
good quality motion picture about
two feet square can be transmitted by
radio, providing all other broadcast
ing and code stations are shut down
at tlie time," Professor Terman says.
"The pictures cannot be enlarged
after reception without breaking them
up into dots.
"It is a question of whether the
people would rather have small mo
tion pictures, of no value from an en
tertainment point of view, or the cus
tomary broadcast programs. The tech
nical difficulties in the construction

of the sending and receiving televi
sion equipment have been overcome. ;
In fact, good pictures have been trans
mitted for many years. The prices of i
good receiving sets will probably be
down within the range of $400 to $500. I
"In television work a large number
of cycles are required to transmit the
pictures in order to show motion. !
Using a band of frequencies 50,000
cycles wide each of the fallowing can
be transmitted in turn: ten different
broadcast programs, one fair televi- j
sion picture 1 inch square, something i
over 10 transoceanic telephone con
versations, 300 square inches of good
quality picture per minute, or 90,000
words per minute by telegraph." This
means that still pictures of good qual- j
ity and of a size sufficiently large to ;
have entertainment value can be
broadcast. Since telephones use only
about half the cycles required by the
radio, good quality motion pictures
can be sent over telephone wires so
as not to use up the channels re
quired by the broadcasting stations.
