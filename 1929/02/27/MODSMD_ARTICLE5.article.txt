"The Daily lias made it possible for ,
I us to obtain definite information on j
the car situation and the garage de- j
mand on the campus. With definite
| facts at hand it will be possible to j
| work On the problem and to present
i it to the Board of Trustees. This will
be done in the immediate future."
With this statement, Comptroller
Almon E. Roth promised action on 1
i the question that has so long been a j
' source of grievance to Stanford car ,
owners.
"However," Roth continued, "the j
problem is a complex one. To build
346 individual garages (the number;
needed as brought out by the Daily
| survey) is of course out of the ques- j
! tion both from a practical and an
architectural point of view. And yet, I
| a central garage of the motor-ramp
'type would not satisfy even the ma-j
| jority of car owners because it would
be impossible to locate it near enough
to everyone. The ideal solution would j
! have been to furnish garage space j

underneath the dormitories and other
buildings but it is too late to do that
I now.
' "It is evident that something should
I be done and, though it is not appar
, out just what that is now, there is
! probably some way out of the
dilemma.
"The University, at present, is en
gaged in a great number of building
propects which include the proposed
1 golf course, a new water system, en
| larging of the press facilities, and a
j $50,000 to $60,000 renovation of the
| sewer system. The solution of the
; garage problem could not possibly be
worked out in less than a year, but
i the University architects will be con
sulted as soon as possible in an effort
jto find a site or sites for the new
| garages.
"Financing of the project is another
problem but, inasmuch as the Univer
; sity is in as many businesses as is de
i sirable already, this will probably be
j taken care of by giving some com
j pany a concession on the garage busi-
I ness.
