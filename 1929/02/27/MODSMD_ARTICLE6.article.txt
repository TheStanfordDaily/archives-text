# CARDS, BEARS MEET TOMORROW NIGHT IN BOXING TOURNAMENT
## Captain Ed Dillon Looms as Heavyweight Champion For 1929 Season 
### 
, Local boxing fans may expect an
| evening packed with thrills when the
leatherpushers of the University of
I California and Stanford tangle at 8
I o'clock tomorrow night in the Stan
ford Pavilion. Seven regular bouts
' and three exhibitions will make up
i the program.
Coach Stanley Jones will bring a
| team of veterans to the Farm; but.
I the Cardinals, who have the advan
i tage of the triple coaching of Harry
Maloney, Myron Schall, and George
Dawson, will prove worthy opponents
of the Blue and Gold fighters.
Doerr, Dillon Featured
Feature bouts of the evening should
i be in the welterweight division when
! A1 Doerr of Stanford meets Captain
Frank Ribble of the Boars; and in
; the heavyweight class when Captain
Ed Dillon of Stanford mixes with
I "Dynamite" Ted Beckett. Ribble has
j twice been Pacific Intercollegiate
; champion and last year won a close
; decision from Danny Frost of Stan
, ford when the latter was fighting in
j the welter class. A1 Doei'r is a sturdy
j boxer, a hard puncher, and stands a
good chance of downing the California
j leader.
Ted Beckett, of California football
fame, is one who boxes because of
j sheer love of fighting. He is always
a dangerous man in the ring, even
when opposed by such a veteran as
j Captain Ed Dillon of Stanford. Dillon
j is a splendid boxer and has recently
changed his style of fighting. Coach
; Harry Maloney expects Dillon to go
through the season undefeated and
emerge Pacific Intercollegiate cham
pion.
Middleweight Slugfest
The Middleweight bout should prove
a slugfest with Duke Brown of Stan
ford matched with George Sherwood,
j Blue and Gold knockout king. This is
j Brown's first appearance in intercolle
j giate boxing.
Johnny Sano, Stanford's hard-hit
ting Japanese bantamweight, will box
with Merle Ansberry. Sano has shown
great improvement over his fighting
ability of last year. Ansberry is a
newcomer but easily won his bout in
the recent U.C.-California Aggie
matches. Vance Rogers, a rangy lad
with a fast punch, tangles with Ed
Nemir, U.C.'s "fighting Phi Bete," in
j 'lie featherweight class.
Frost in 130 Class
Danny Frost is now fighting in the
lightweight class. Apparently his
j change in weight has not lessened the
] elfectiveness of his punch. Frost will
i meet Wilbur Kindig, victor over the
Aggie who shaded Frost in an extra
round recently. In the light-heavy
weight division Bill Hollingsworth of
Stanford mixes with Dwight Gribben,
former amateur champion.
