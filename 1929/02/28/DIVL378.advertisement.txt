It is always time
for Heath suit
Thos. Heath Clothes have a remarkable habit of being at home
everywhere — and on every occasion. For example, when you
haven't time to change, it is quite possible to appear at dinner
Vjwifc, \ * n your Thos. Heath morning suit—and unless it is a very
CvrfiSi * l formal dinner indeed, you will find explanations hardly
JgHHyLj3 necessary. For along with the companionable ease and free
dom of Thos. Heath Clothes goes an unfailing effect of savoir
faire, which is surely a finer thing than mere adherence to
Not all Thos. Heath conventions. Such is the result of so much hand work, per-
BUits are costly: *
Some are sonal supervision, and everlasting fussing willi details.
