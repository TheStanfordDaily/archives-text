WASHINGTON, Feb. 27. (JP)— As
President-elect Hoover neared the end
of his Cabinet-making today, William
J. Donovan, of New York, passed defi
nitely and somewhat abruptly out of
lhe political picture of his adminis
tration. At the same time authentic
word came that James W. Good, of
lowa, would be Secretary of War,
and William D. Mitchell, of Minne
sota, Attorney General.
From all accounts the president
elect sought repeatedly to have Dono
van succeed Henry L. Stimson in the
Philippines, but the Buffalo attorney
refused consistently to reconsider it.
It was emphasized that there had
been no open break between the two
who long have been friends and who
were closely associated in the Hoover
campaign.
As matters shaped up tonight,
friends of Mr. Hoover believed the
Cabinet selections now stood:
Secretary of State, Henry L. Stim
son. of New York.
Secretary of Treasury, Andrew W.
Mellon, of Pennsylvania.
Secretary of War, James W. Good,
of lowa.
Attorney General, William D. Mit
chell, of Minnesota.
Postmaster General, Walter F.
Brown, of Ohio.
Secretary of Navy, Charles Francis
Adams, of Massachusetts.
Secretaray ot' Interior, Dr. Ray Ly

This still left in doubt the secre
taries of agriculture, commerce and
labor, although there were increasing
reports that William N. Doak, of Vir
ginia, would succeed James J. Davis,
of Pennsylvania, in the labor post.
