# STANFORD FACES NORTHERNERS IN DEBATE TONIGHT
## Stanford Takes Affirmative Argument to Abolish Insanity Pleas 
### Kenneth Mansfield 
Stanford and University of Wash
ington debaters meet on the platform
of the Little Theatre tonight at 8:15
o'clock in the first of two contests
scheduled for the present forensic
season. The question up for discus
sion will be, "Resolved, That the Plea
of Temporary Insanity Should Be
Abolished in Criminal Cases." Harold
Shepherd, professor of law, will pre
side.
This topic has been selected by the
Pacific Forensic League and is being
widely debated on the Coast this year
due to the frequent use of the insan
ity plea in murder cases. The Wash
ington speakers are returning north
ward after a tour of southern univer
sities and have used this topic almost
exclusively.
Cards Take Affirmative
John McClintock and William L.
Shaw have been selected by Wheeler
Barger, assistant debating coach, to
take the affirmative for Stanford.
McClintock has participated in four
varsity debates while at Stanford. The
political debate on the campus preced
ing the November election and the
advertising debate at U.S.C. early in
January were his most recent activi
ties. Shaw spoke at St. Ignatius in the
political debate held there last No
vember.
The Washington men who are ac
companying Professor Frederick W.
Orr, debate coach at Seattle, on the
southern tour are Sidney Spear and
Charles Strother. Spear, who will pre
sent the constructive case for the
negative, is a pre-law sophomore and
has had no previous experience in
collegiate debating, but participated
in many high school contests. This is
Strother's third year of varsity com
petition. The Washington trio will ar
rive in Palo Alto on the "Lark" this
morning from Los Angeles.
Of particular interest to campus
forensic audiences will be the use of
the Oregon Cross Question System of
argument in tonight's debate. This
style, which has the characteristics of
legal battles in court, has not been
used in previous forensic activities at
Stanford. It is well adapted to the dis
cussion because of the legal aspects
of the question.
Preceding the meeting in the Little
Theatre tonight, a dinner will be held
in the Stanford Union dining room for
the contestants and their coaches.
Further arrangement of details will
be completed on the arrival of the
Washington men this morning.
