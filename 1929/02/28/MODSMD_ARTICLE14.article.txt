# CARDS SCORE 7-4 WIN OVER MORAGA NINE
## Simkins Pitches Tight Ball; Churchill, Cook Lead Batting Attack 
### 
A three-run rally in the sixth in
ning to overcome a lead accumulated
by St. Mary's in the early rounds, en
abled the Stanford varsity baseball
team to defeat the Saints here yes
terday by a 7 to 4 score. The Gaels
attempted to stage a comeback in the
last frame with two out, hut were
checked after tallying once.
Bill Simkins was the shining light
of the game. Simkins pitched a fine
brand of ball after relieving Taylor
in the third inning, and kept the hits
well-scattered. Rooney, Saint first
baseman, collected four hits out of
five tries, one of them a triple. Church
ill led the batting attack for the
Cards with three out of four.
The Saints touched Taylor for two
runs in the first frame, when Silva
and Rooney tripled in succession, and
the latter scored on Johnson's error.
In the third Silva singled to right,
took second on a passed ball, and
scored on an infield error. Another
uror and a walk filled the bases, but
the Cards tightened and retired the
side. The last tally was made in the
ninth, when Ackerman tripled to deep
center, and scored on Rooney's bingle
over third.
Stanford made its first run in the
third inning on a walk, a single, and
an error. In the sixth, a single, walk,
and safe bunt filled the bases with
none away. Johnson hit a long sacri
fice fly to center to score Churchill,
and Hardy was walked to fill the
bases again. McGrath, pinch-hitting,
was also walked, forcing in Hunlcen.
The Cards then worked the old
squeeze play successfully, Cook scor
ing on Crawford's safe bunt. The Red
shirts made three more in the eighth.
Johnson was safe on an error, Hardy
bunted safely, and Berg drew a walk
to fill the bags. Crawford fiied out to !
the infield, but Johnson tallied on a
fielder's choice. Hardy and Berg
scored when Churchill planted a safe j
hit in center field.
Yesterday's victory evens up the [
series with the Gaels, as they won ;
the first encounter by a 9 to 3 count.
The third game of the series will be
played here next week, and a victory
for the Cards would put them back in
the running in the College League.
