# "WILD DUCK" SCENES MORE DETAILED THAN FORMER PRODUCTIONS
## Helvenston Constructs Two Semi-Permanent Sets For Ibsen Drama 
### 
"The transition from the first set
! ting to the second in 'The Wild Duck'
j is the biggest single change we have
; ever done on the Stanford stage," said
j Harold Helvenston,\ scenic designer,
j who is completing work on his eighth
| campus production. Although the Ib
-1 sen play, to be presented under the
| auspices of English Club at 8:15 in
| the Assembly Hall tomorrow night,
! has five acts, it calls for only two
j settings, so Helvenston has been able
j to bring them as near perfection as
possible.
As the realistic is more evident
than the symbolic in "The Wild Duck,"
j the sets express the mood of the play
| rather than the abstract idea. In the
| first act, laid in the home of Werle,
[the wealthy merchant, the essence of
1 stultifying affluence is expressed,
j There are two great bookcases reach
! in& from the floor to the ceiling, a
| large door framed by heavy green
and black draperies, a more than life
[ size portrait on the wall, and
| ornate furniture set off against the
I rich brown walls.
So different from the first setting
! is the one for the next four acts that,
j in order to obviate a twenty-minute
wait for complete scene changes, Hel
-1 venston has again employed a semi
permanent set, which has cut down
j the interval to less than half that
I time. Yet, although about three
fourths of the walls of the second are
; the same as those used in the first,
j the change in the execution and mood
! of the two completely disguises this
! fact.
In opposition to the exaggerated af
j fluence of tlie merchant's house, the
j dull interior of the photographer's
I studio is accentuated by the contrasts
S of dark walls and large, bright studio
j windows, against which the actors are
i silhouetted. And in the center of the
i rear wall are the double sliding doors
which lead to the attic where the wild
duck is kept. The effect this scene
produces, with ifs light and dark
j masses and its cluttering photogra
pher's equipment, is one of somber
realism.

So different from the first setting
! is the one for the next four acts that,
j in order to obviate a twenty-minute
wait for complete scene changes, Hel
-1 venston has again employed a semi
permanent set, which has cut down
j the interval to less than half that
I time. Yet, although about three
fourths of the walls of the second are
; the same as those used in the first,
j the change in the execution and mood
! of the two completely disguises this
! fact.
In opposition to the exaggerated af
j fluence of tlie merchant's house, the
j dull interior of the photographer's
I studio is accentuated by the contrasts
S of dark walls and large, bright studio
j windows, against which the actors are
i silhouetted. And in the center of the
i rear wall are the double sliding doors
which lead to the attic where the wild
duck is kept. The effect this scene
produces, with ifs light and dark
j masses and its cluttering photogra
pher's equipment, is one of somber
realism.
"The transition from the first set
! ting to the second in 'The Wild Duck'
j is the biggest single change we have
; ever done on the Stanford stage," said
j Harold Helvenston,\ scenic designer,
j who is completing work on his eighth
| campus production. Although the Ib
-1 sen play, to be presented under the
| auspices of English Club at 8:15 in
| the Assembly Hall tomorrow night,
! has five acts, it calls for only two
j settings, so Helvenston has been able
j to bring them as near perfection as
possible.
As the realistic is more evident
than the symbolic in "The Wild Duck,"
j the sets express the mood of the play
| rather than the abstract idea. In the
| first act, laid in the home of Werle,
[the wealthy merchant, the essence of
1 stultifying affluence is expressed,
j There are two great bookcases reach
! in& from the floor to the ceiling, a
| large door framed by heavy green
and black draperies, a more than life
[ size portrait on the wall, and
| ornate furniture set off against the
I rich brown walls.
