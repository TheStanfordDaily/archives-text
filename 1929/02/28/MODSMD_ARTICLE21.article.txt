With the stage set for what prom
ises to be the closest boxing match
in Stanford-California athletic history
when the Cardinal and Blue and Gold
leatherpushers mix at 8 o'clock to
j night in the local Pavilion, each coach
|is confident that his team will be the
[ winner. Seven regular decision bouts
| and six exhibitions will make up the
program.
Coach Stanley Jones openly boasts
that lie has the greatest team ever
developed at the East Bay school,
while Harry Maloney modestly ad
mits that his boys would be winners
in any collegiate ring, and that he
expects them to drub the Berkeleyites
tonight.
California lias made two changes in
their original card. Eurice Dell'Osso
will tangle with Danny Frost in the
lightweight division. Dell'Osso fights
his first intercollegiate bout tonight.
He will have to exhibit some nifty
footwork to avoid tripping over such
a "moniker." George Garner replaces
Dwight Gribben in the light-heavv
weight class to meet Bill Hollings
wortli of Stanford. Garner has been
developing slowly, but Jones feels
that he has now hit bis stride.
The Cardinal squad was in perfect
condition after the final workout last
night. Captain Ed Dillon, Stanford's
big leader, rules favorite to down
"Dynamite" Ted Beckett, of U.C. foot
ball fame. Dillon looms as the next
Pacific Intercollegiate Heavyweight
Champion. A1 Doerr, scrappy welter
weight, promises to give Captain
Frank Ribble of the Bears plenty of
trouble. Doerr is the headiest boxer
on the Cardinal squad and stands a
good chance of beating the California
leader.
Johnny Sano, who was reported ill
yesterday, has recovered and will be
in the ring tonight.
Johnny Herget, Kid Mitchell to pro
fessional fans, will referee the bouts.
