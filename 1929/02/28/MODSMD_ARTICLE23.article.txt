# Boxing, A Clean Sport
## 
### 
The big boxing bout of the season will be held tonight with the Blue
and Gold from across the Bay. For those who enjoy a sport that is fast,
hard, and clean, here is one unexcelled. Tonight's bouts will be exem
plary of this.
Much unmerited criticism has been directed toward boxing. Super
journalist Hearst carried on an unsuccessful campaign against it through
out the state. Came an invitation to Stanford to meet the West Point and
Annapolis men in contests at Madison Square Garden in New York, and
it was rejected. Ihe eastern bouts were to occur at such a time th<it tlicy
would not hinder the boxers in their studies (statistics compiled at Stan
ford show that boxers have scholarship rating above all other athletes),
expenses were to be paid, the matches were with two outstanding institu
tions, nothing stood in the way of the proposed bouts but the place the}
were to be held, Madison Square Gardens.
It is hard to believe that the place boxing bouts are held, in this case
a place comparable to the Yankee Stadium, scene of the Army football
game, should be the factor deciding the merits of boxing and an obstacle
to its being staged.
But this is typical of the unfair criticism current in regard to the
sport. Skill, courage, physical fitness, three essential qualities of football,
track, basketball, all sports, are needed in as great quantity in this as in
all. And more because in most sports there is co-operative action ; in box
ing a man stands alone on his own skill, courage, and fitness.
Men of the fine character of Coach Harry Maloney, who spend hours
of time and much energy toward building boxing up to the high standard
it holds, would not touch any sport that was not above the slightest
question.
Stanford can be proud of its boxers and can consider any boxing bout
with honorable opponents, wherever held, worth its support.
