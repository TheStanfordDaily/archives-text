# A 						College for Colleges

Yale will have in 1930 an "Institute of Human Relations," a college
for colleges where biologists, psychologists, economists, sociologists will
join in the study of applied sciences such as law, medicine, psychiatry.
"The Institute will foster no fads and hold no briefs for theories ex
cept those which grow out of thorough scientific investigation. It is
believed by those organizing the Institute of Human Relations that spe
cialization which followed the important scientific discoveries of the
last century has done much to advance man's knowledge of human life
and the technique for dealing with special phases of it, but that the time
has now come for drawing together tfiis knowledge and applying it to the
best advantage of mankind as a whole. Man himself must now be the
center of study, and his welfare an end and aim of the biological and
social sciences and of the related professions." So spoke Yale's President
Angell.
After all these centuries of education, study, and investigation into
all the realms of human knowledge, the pedagogs have at last decided that
the analysis of the atom and the electron is a fine thing, but that man is
a matter for consideration too. Strange indeed and characteristic of the
scientific era is man's prodding into the intimate secrecies of the infini
tesimal, dissecting this, peering into that, tearing apart to study in mi
nutiae to the total neglect of studying man in his relation to man and man
in his relation to the whole of knowledge.
At last their will will be an effort to correlate the branches of learn
ing and derive from the whole the greatest welfare for man.
