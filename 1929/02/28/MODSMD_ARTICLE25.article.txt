# The 						Press, A Screaming Beast

### 
San Francisco and outlying districts were aflame. A little four-year
old girl had been kidnapped. Not a year back hung the shadow of the
Hickman case. Newspapers spread the details of the kidnapping in scare
heads, edition after edition. And the newspapers knew they had a good
thing.
Maeterlinck, realizing that death and a little child affect people most
deeply, arouse their emotions most intensely, whatever the relation of the
two, wrote his plays, and wrote well. In his work is sympathetic and deep
understanding.
The daily papers, realizing that death, or the possibility of death, and
a little child, arouse the emotions of the people intensely, ground out
reams of material on the case of Doris Murphy, and ground well.
In their work was shrewd understanding of the mass mind. Street
sales rose by leaps and bounds. Public sentiment, enraged, poured forth
funds to award the capturer of the kidnapper. Then the little girl was
found.
'Hie child and its captors walked into the editorial offices of a city
newspaper. The editorial staff went wild and accomplished a scoop un
precedented in the annals of San Francisco journalism.
In this entire case rests the indictment laid at the door of contem
porary journalism most often, the exaggeration of news. World news,
national and state news of more real importance to the welfare of men
was relegated to the back pages that the sorrow of a mother over the loss
of her baby might be spread before the waiting public in screeching
headlines, in picture after picture, and in column on column of print.
The grief of the mother and the sadness of the child's being abducted
were not lessened by the blatant publicizing of them. Nor is the mass
of men to profit by the publicizing. The child was found through news
paper effort, yet it would be hard to think that the same thing could not
have been accomplished with less sensational exaggeration of the story.
The grief and sorroyy of everyone is not made the subject of journalistic
craftsmanship and abated by its wide-spread advertisement.
r.ut such is the nature of the press today and so it will remain until
all newspapers set the pace by establishing news evaluation and the han
dling of news on better ground than its present basis of exaggeration to
pander to emotion.
