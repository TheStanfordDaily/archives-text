### Plum Bun. By Jessie Redmon Fauset 
(New York: Frederick A. Stokes
Company. $2.50.)
This is a corking good story. I
couldn't set it down until I had fin
ished every word of it, and when a
reviewer finds a novel as interesting
as that it IS interesting. But there is
more to the book than the story.
There is the style. Of it, the London
Sphere says, "masterly, admirably
written."
The style of the book is that sort
which makes the story flow along
without any apparent effort or strain
on the part of the author. You are
swept along in the exact mood that
the writer wants you to be in, with
out feeling that you are straining at
the leash. Simple, smooth, unobtru
sive, delightful, is how I would char
acterize the style.
"Plum Bun" is the story of a near
white colored woman, Angela Murray.
Her mother was white, with a negro
strain; her father was black; her sis
ter was brown, and Angela was white,
in appearance, like her mother. In
Philadelphia, where Angela was
raised, she couldn't get away from the
stigma of her black blood; hence she
couldn't enjoy life. So she went to
New York, for her mother had told
her that "life is more important than
color."
With a subtle and deft handling of
words and situations the author car
lies the reader along in full sympathy
with the poignant yearning of this
white colored girl for a full and
happy life unhampered by the selec
tiveness of racial convention.
The story is a little slow getting
started. But after Angela has grown
out of childhood, and the stage for
the story proper is set to perfection,
then is when you get thoroughly in
terested. The plot of the book is un
usually catching. It has a series of
climaxes, and each of these climaxes
in the life of Angela would make a
story worthy of the tricky skill of an
O'Henry.
It is an accomplishment for Jessie
Redmon Fauset to have written a
novel of negro-white relationships in
which the position of the negro in
American civilization is appealingly
set forth without stressing that mor
bid introspection which is characteris
tic of so many negro writers. They
tend to become so engrossed with the
injustice of their position that they
over-carry their point and lose effec
tiveness. "Plum Bun" does not do
this. It presents the gross injustice
with which we whites treat the negro
without the aid of pages of introspec
tion and self-pity.
In summary: "Plum Bun" has a
good plot; it's well-written; it ends
happily. The fact that a story ends
happily does not by any means make

it a good story, but, all in all, you'll
be awfully glad that this particular
story does end that way.

Raw Realism—A Passing Fad.
The popularity of stark, depressing
books which present realism, raw and
reeking, has passed, believes Dr.
Frederick T. Blanchard. Dr. Blanch
ard is the head of the English depart
ment of U.C.L.A., and an established
critic of English literature.
His feeling is that the trend of
modern taste is in the direction of
Victorlanism, which it has so lately
ridiculed. Many modern writers will !
not live in fame, whereas Dickens,
Thackeray, George Eliot, Meredith — j
sentimental, human Victorians —will '
be remembered, he says.
"Present-day writers, in their pas- j
sion to tell everything of what they j
see around them, have become tran
scribers, not translators, of life. They
have forgotten that the heart must
be touched, that men want to read
of life in forms of beauty which kin
dle the imagination.
"They say, 'here is reality—look at
it, taste it, feel it' —and they are only
offering a disorganized mass of sensa
tions and impressions, not an inter
pretation of existence. They are not
able to get up above the ugly and
petty things they see around them.
They grow indignant and seem to be
scolding all the time.
"Great novelists of literature have
always been able to feel a larger sym
pathy for the men they write about. !
They see the faults and the vices, ,
but they do not become blinded to the j
I kindliness and the striving that al- ,
most all men share in common.
"Real literature must express life !
in terms of beauty—that sort of liter- i
ature is the most lasting thing in the !
world. Men turn to it again and again
for comfort and inspiration."

The Balkan Pivot: Yugoslavia.
The recent news from Yugoslavia
of King Alexander's bold assumption
' of the dictatorship points to the need I
' of an up-to-date account of this little-!
| known country in the heart of the j
j Balkans, and a forthcoming hook by .
| Charles A. Beard and George Radin
j will admirably fill the bill. It is called
j "The Balkan Pivot: Yugoslavia," and!
I it gives the background which makes !
I understandable the present situation
•in this new little kingdom of the ,
Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Her na- j
tural resources, recent history, politi
cal organization, economic situation j
; and foreign relations —all the most !
! important phases of the Yugoslavia
of today are presented in this very j
■ readable book, which Macmillan will ;
publish on March sth.
(New York: Frederick A. Stokes
Company. $2.50.)
This is a corking good story. I
couldn't set it down until I had fin
ished every word of it, and when a
reviewer finds a novel as interesting
as that it IS interesting. But there is
more to the book than the story.
There is the style. Of it, the London
Sphere says, "masterly, admirably
written."
The style of the book is that sort
which makes the story flow along
without any apparent effort or strain
on the part of the author. You are
swept along in the exact mood that
the writer wants you to be in, with
out feeling that you are straining at
the leash. Simple, smooth, unobtru
sive, delightful, is how I would char
acterize the style.
"Plum Bun" is the story of a near
white colored woman, Angela Murray.
Her mother was white, with a negro
strain; her father was black; her sis
ter was brown, and Angela was white,
in appearance, like her mother. In
Philadelphia, where Angela was
raised, she couldn't get away from the
stigma of her black blood; hence she
couldn't enjoy life. So she went to
New York, for her mother had told
her that "life is more important than
color."
With a subtle and deft handling of
words and situations the author car
lies the reader along in full sympathy
with the poignant yearning of this
white colored girl for a full and
happy life unhampered by the selec
tiveness of racial convention.
The story is a little slow getting
started. But after Angela has grown
out of childhood, and the stage for
the story proper is set to perfection,
then is when you get thoroughly in
terested. The plot of the book is un
usually catching. It has a series of
climaxes, and each of these climaxes
in the life of Angela would make a
story worthy of the tricky skill of an
O'Henry.
It is an accomplishment for Jessie
Redmon Fauset to have written a
novel of negro-white relationships in
which the position of the negro in
American civilization is appealingly
set forth without stressing that mor
bid introspection which is characteris
tic of so many negro writers. They
tend to become so engrossed with the
injustice of their position that they
over-carry their point and lose effec
tiveness. "Plum Bun" does not do
this. It presents the gross injustice
with which we whites treat the negro
without the aid of pages of introspec
tion and self-pity.
In summary: "Plum Bun" has a
good plot; it's well-written; it ends
happily. The fact that a story ends
happily does not by any means make

it a good story, but, all in all, you'll
be awfully glad that this particular
story does end that way.

Raw Realism—A Passing Fad.
The popularity of stark, depressing
books which present realism, raw and
reeking, has passed, believes Dr.
Frederick T. Blanchard. Dr. Blanch
ard is the head of the English depart
ment of U.C.L.A., and an established
critic of English literature.
His feeling is that the trend of
modern taste is in the direction of
Victorlanism, which it has so lately
ridiculed. Many modern writers will !
not live in fame, whereas Dickens,
Thackeray, George Eliot, Meredith — j
sentimental, human Victorians —will '
be remembered, he says.
"Present-day writers, in their pas- j
sion to tell everything of what they j
see around them, have become tran
scribers, not translators, of life. They
have forgotten that the heart must
be touched, that men want to read
of life in forms of beauty which kin
dle the imagination.
"They say, 'here is reality—look at
it, taste it, feel it' —and they are only
offering a disorganized mass of sensa
tions and impressions, not an inter
pretation of existence. They are not
able to get up above the ugly and
petty things they see around them.
They grow indignant and seem to be
scolding all the time.
"Great novelists of literature have

The Balkan Pivot: Yugoslavia.
The recent news from Yugoslavia
of King Alexander's bold assumption
' of the dictatorship points to the need I
' of an up-to-date account of this little-!
| known country in the heart of the j
j Balkans, and a forthcoming hook by .
| Charles A. Beard and George Radin
j will admirably fill the bill. It is called
j "The Balkan Pivot: Yugoslavia," and!
I it gives the background which makes !
I understandable the present situation
•in this new little kingdom of the ,
Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Her na- j
tural resources, recent history, politi
cal organization, economic situation j
; and foreign relations —all the most !
! important phases of the Yugoslavia
of today are presented in this very j
■ readable book, which Macmillan will ;
publish on March sth.
(New York: Frederick A. Stokes
Company. $2.50.)
This is a corking good story. I
couldn't set it down until I had fin
ished every word of it, and when a
reviewer finds a novel as interesting
as that it IS interesting. But there is
more to the book than the story.
There is the style. Of it, the London
Sphere says, "masterly, admirably
written."
The style of the book is that sort
which makes the story flow along
without any apparent effort or strain
on the part of the author. You are
swept along in the exact mood that
the writer wants you to be in, with
out feeling that you are straining at
the leash. Simple, smooth, unobtru
sive, delightful, is how I would char
acterize the style.
"Plum Bun" is the story of a near
white colored woman, Angela Murray.
Her mother was white, with a negro
strain; her father was black; her sis
ter was brown, and Angela was white,
in appearance, like her mother. In
Philadelphia, where Angela was
raised, she couldn't get away from the
stigma of her black blood; hence she
couldn't enjoy life. So she went to
New York, for her mother had told
her that "life is more important than
color."
With a subtle and deft handling of
words and situations the author car
lies the reader along in full sympathy
with the poignant yearning of this
white colored girl for a full and
happy life unhampered by the selec
tiveness of racial convention.
The story is a little slow getting
started. But after Angela has grown
out of childhood, and the stage for
the story proper is set to perfection,
then is when you get thoroughly in
terested. The plot of the book is un
usually catching. It has a series of
climaxes, and each of these climaxes
in the life of Angela would make a
story worthy of the tricky skill of an
O'Henry.
It is an accomplishment for Jessie
Redmon Fauset to have written a
novel of negro-white relationships in
which the position of the negro in
American civilization is appealingly
set forth without stressing that mor
bid introspection which is characteris
tic of so many negro writers. They
tend to become so engrossed with the
injustice of their position that they
over-carry their point and lose effec
tiveness. "Plum Bun" does not do
this. It presents the gross injustice
with which we whites treat the negro
without the aid of pages of introspec
tion and self-pity.
In summary: "Plum Bun" has a
good plot; it's well-written; it ends
happily. The fact that a story ends
happily does not by any means make

it a good story, but, all in all, you'll
be awfully glad that this particular
story does end that way.
