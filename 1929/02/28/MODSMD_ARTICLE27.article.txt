# Campus Opinion

### 
The Editor, Sir:
May a word of approval be added
to Lyman Benson's fine remarks in
"Campus Opinion" Monday? Being an
alumna of Stanford and having lived
in Seattle some years prior to Dr.
Suzzallo's inauguration as president of
the University of Washington, we had
a keen interest in the gigantic accom
plishments already referred to by Mr.
Benson. The contract between the
university as it was and as Dr. Suz
zallo made it was so great that we
even felt our children would be as
well-equipped attending there as
though they came to Stanford. How
ever, they are now here.
When the word reached Seattle
that the Governor had removed Dr.
Suz.zallo the city's indignation was
not confined to the campus by any
means, but was echoed by screaming
sirens, wailing whistles, and such con
fusion that the telephone exchanges

were silent for half an hour, unable
to cope with the demands. Such wide
spread excitement had not been pres
ent since the war with the single ex
ception of the news of President Hard
ing's death. Recall of the Governor
was contemplated, because of the un
called-for injustice of his move.
Dr. Suzzallo is a gentleman, a
scholar, an authority, a remarkable
executive, and a most likeable friend
of youth. A trained diplomat would
have been sorely tried at the condi
tions which Dr. Suzzallo mastered
successfully in university conditions
both on campus and in the State legis
lature. His triumph is an added credit
to Stanford; his removal only exposed
cheap politics and called attention to
the inconsistency of education's being
at the mercy of politics. Stanford Uni
versity would honor itself by such a
choice, and add to its world-famed
laurels. â€”An Alumna.
