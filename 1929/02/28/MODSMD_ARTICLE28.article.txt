# Robin Willis Will Lecture On Texas Geology Tonight
## 
### 
Itobin Willis, '20, will lecture before I
an open meeting of the Geology and j
Mining Society on "The Petroleum j
Geology of West Texas" at 7:30 to- (
night in Room 550. Willis has been
connected with one of the major oil
companies in that region until re- j
eently, and is now doing consulting
work, with offices at Midland, Texas. !
His talk will cover the peculiar con- j
ditions of accumulation of oil in lime-:
stone reefs where porosity is equally
important with structure and where S
the principal study is the microscopic !
examination of unfossiliferous well j
cuttings. This region ranks as one of |
the greatest potential producers of oil j
in the world, and is the only region
in the United States where great wells
comparable to those of the Mexican
oil fields have been found. The eco
nomic problem of conserving this oil
is closely connected with the problem i
of keeping out water, and has been j
solved by proration, the limiting of!
the output of the field and its appor
tionment among the producing com
panies according to the capacity of
their wells and the acreage held by
them. I
