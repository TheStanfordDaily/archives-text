On the heels of the Shaikey-Strib
ling PRIZE fight comes the Stanford-
California BOXING tournament to be
held at 8 o'clock tonight in the
Pavilion. The former is a hang-over
of the days of Sullivan and Jeffries;
the latter is a fuller expression of the .
new era in boxing.
Yet the prize fight has been polished
up. No longer is it considered a sport
for the "South of Market" or the
"Bowery" boys. It has been dolled up
in a "soup and fish." Thirty years ago,
a fighter, or a boxer, was a PUG with
cauliflowered ears," a brute, not a
gentleman, who ate with his knife.
This conception was not wholly in
correct, for Public Opinion held that
a fight was a slugfest where two un- i
; intelligent human animals battered
each other for a pot of gold. Today i
there is still the battering, the pot of
gold, but Public Opinion has changed.
Consider the exhibition last night.
More than 600 of the social elite of
the aristocratic South attended the
Sharkey-Stribling fight. Women as
well as men composed the audience
of some thirty-five thousand people.
The fighters are men resepcted by
the people at large. Witness also
that Mr. Tunney, who would have
been called a "thug" thirty years
ago, married a woman whose name
appeared on the social register of
New York. Those who saw the ex
champion when he was here will re
member his culture and his refined
speech. Yet he was a fighter.
This change on the part of the Pub
lic has been brought about largely
through clean, sportsman-like boxing j
tournaments. The germ was cultivated
in American schools. Practically every [
American university has its boxing j
team, which brings as much credit to \
it as do its football, basketball, or !
tennis teams.
The old order changeth and boxing
| is generally recognized as a sport, not '
an exhibition put on to satisfy the
j vicarious craving for blood. But what j
about Stanford? The Cardinal boxing!
team was not allowed to go East evi- j
| dently because of a narrow and biased
j conception of boxing.
i Although boxing, even professional j
j prize-fighting, is recognized and sup
ported by cultured people, the Stan
ford team was denied the privilege of
making the trip to New York for the
i intercollegiate tournament "because it
i will be held in Madison Square Gar
den and attended by a non-collegiate
crowd."
Would not the refined people at
j tend an intercollegiate tournament,

featuring the United States Military
Academy, New York University, and
Annapolis teams, as readily as they
would a prize-fight of lesser talent?
Are other sporting events attended
only by a collegiate crowd? These are
questions that are waiting to be satis
fisd- â€”Merle Emry.
