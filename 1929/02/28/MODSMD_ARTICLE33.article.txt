# Stanford Polo Squad To Meet O.S.C. Next Quarter
## 
### 
The Stanford polo team will play
its first intercollegiate matches of the
year on May 16 and 18 when it meets
the Oregon State squad in two games
I here.
Last year a Stanford team com
posed of Weymouth, Conolly, McDou
! gall, and Thompson, traveled to Cor
vallis and played two gamed with
O.S.C. Stanford took the first contest
by a seven to six score, but dropped
J(he second, five to three.
In announcing the matches yester
day, Captain Richard A. Gordan, polo
l coach, made no mention of the play
! ers whom he intends to start in the
two contests. The tentative lineups of
the first two teams on the "A" squad
are as follows: first team —No. 1,
; Shortridge, No. 2, McDougall, No. 3,
Kevell, Back, Gorham; second team —
No. 1, Scripps, No. 2, Gilbreath, No. 3,
Cox, Back, Dill. It is probable, but
not at all certain, that the starting
lineups for the O.S.C. games will be
j chosen from these eight men.
