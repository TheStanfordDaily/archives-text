"The chief thing in which I've no
ticed Stanford and Southern Califor
nia differ is the informal atmosphere
you have up here," said Jessica Heher,
editor of Wampus, University of
Southern California's humorous pub
lication. "At S.C.—and I think this is
so because it is situated in the middle
of a city—we are much more formal
than any of the northern universities
I've visited."
Miss Heber is visiting the campus
for a few days, having stopped off on
her way home from the convention
of college comic magazines held at
Reno last week. She is the first wo
man to bo editor of Wampas, which
is now in its tenth year.
"Another thing which struck me,"
she remarked, "is that students up
here seem to study much less than
we do in the south. And yet, during
classes, you are much more serious
than we are." When asked what
U.S.C.'s attitude toward Stanford is,
fche said that the southern university
is friendly, and particularly admires
the Cardinal sportsmanship. "But,"
she wont on, "almost every S.C. giil
will tell you that she thinks a Stan
ford man is terribly conceited sort
of like the Harvard attitude."
She particularly liked the congenial
atmosphere of the campus, explain
ing that Southern California has no
campus and that most of the students
there live at home. This gives the
fraternities and sororities there a
great deal more power than at Stan
ford, as the non-fraternity students
are entirely unorganized.
"But U.S.C. is growing steadily,"
she said. "We get about two new
buildings every year now, and the
new Student Union is our pride."
