# SPORTS OF 1929
## Williams, The Conqueror 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Howard Pyle, in his book, "The
Passing of Arthur and the Story of
the Grail," tells about Sir Percival and
his "steed that flew like the wind."
Well, here is a modern knight of the
cinder-path named Percival, who flies
like the wind without the aid of a
horse. He usually passes all the
others, too, hut whether or not he
could have passed Arthur Duffy, once
king of all sprinters, is a question that
will have to remain unanswered.
Only a few people ever heard of
Percy Williams until last spring,
when he was clocked at 9 3-5 seconds
in 100 yards. Then he won the Cana
dian 100-meter tryouts in 10 3-5 and
won the right to represent the

Dominion at Amsterdam. The smash
ing victories of the 19-year-old Van
couver schoolboy at the Olympics are
ancient history to all track followers.
After winning two preliminary heats
in 10 3-5 seconds, he lost the semi
final of the 100 meters to McAllister
in the same time, and then came hack
in the final to win over London, Brit
ish Guianan, and Lammers, of Ger
many, in 10 4-5. He repeated his tri
umph a few days later in the 200
meters, in which Paddock failed even
to qualify for the finals, by defeating
liangeley, of England; Kornig, of Ger
many; and others in 21 4-5 seconds.
The American sprinters simply
weren't in it.
