# Swimming Marks Broken At Encina Pool In Tryouts
## 
### 
Stanford's hope of repeating its tra
; ditional win over California in the
j annual waterpolo and swimming con-
I lest Saturday took a high bound this
| week when several U.C.-Card meet rec
j ords were broken in tryouts held at
j Encina pool. Botli varsity and frosh
j mermen did phenomenal things in the
way of cleaving water with speed.
Captain Ogden Driggs, who holds
| the present century backstroke record
of 1:08 showed his potential ability to
break it by reeling off a IiOSVi race
yesterday. The day before, he broke
another U.C.-Card mark by swimming
the 220-yard free-style in 2:25 fiat.
Hadley Bramel on the same day
won the century free-style sprint
trials in :57 flat. Booth, leader of the
frosh squad, knocked over the exist
ing 100-yard backstroke by set
ting a mark of 1:64. Wliitey Burns
took first in the 200-yard breast-stroke.
As might be expected, Austin Clapp
did the unusual by cutting ten sec
onds from the 220-yard race, finishing
in 2:23. He will probably do better
yet in the meet Saturday. Reggie Har
rison has twice swum the 50-yard
sprint in 24.2 this week .which time
is below the present Pacific Coast
record. With records falling right and
left, Burns cut a second from the cen
tury breast-stroke, making 1:13, which
is very fast going.
Bramel made the best time in re
lay team tryouts, and was followed
by Clapp and Driggs. He was clocked
at 35.2 for two laps. Winning time in
the other heat was 37.4, when select
ing the four-man varsity team which
will swim the 400-foot race.
When Warner Hobdy made the sen
sational time of 1:07.6 in the 100-yard
back-stroke years ago, it was pre- j
dieted that his mark would stand for
a long time. But when Frank Booth
yesterday swam the same race under j
rough conditions, and finished in
1:06.8, it looked as though the record
was doomed to be shattered in the
next intercollegiate meet. This race
will be one of the most spectacular
contests Saturday.

Captain Ogden Driggs, who holds
| the present century backstroke record
of 1:08 showed his potential ability to
break it by reeling off a IiOSVi race
yesterday. The day before, he broke
another U.C.-Card mark by swimming
the 220-yard free-style in 2:25 fiat.
Hadley Bramel on the same day
won the century free-style sprint
trials in :57 flat. Booth, leader of the
frosh squad, knocked over the exist
ing 100-yard backstroke by set
ting a mark of 1:64. Wliitey Burns
took first in the 200-yard breast-stroke.
As might be expected, Austin Clapp
did the unusual by cutting ten sec
onds from the 220-yard race, finishing
in 2:23. He will probably do better
yet in the meet Saturday. Reggie Har
rison has twice swum the 50-yard
sprint in 24.2 this week .which time
is below the present Pacific Coast
record. With records falling right and
left, Burns cut a second from the cen
tury breast-stroke, making 1:13, which
is very fast going.
Bramel made the best time in re
lay team tryouts, and was followed
by Clapp and Driggs. He was clocked
at 35.2 for two laps. Winning time in
the other heat was 37.4, when select
ing the four-man varsity team which
will swim the 400-foot race.
When Warner Hobdy made the sen
sational time of 1:07.6 in the 100-yard
back-stroke years ago, it was pre- j
dieted that his mark would stand for
a long time. But when Frank Booth
yesterday swam the same race under j
rough conditions, and finished in
1:06.8, it looked as though the record
was doomed to be shattered in the
next intercollegiate meet. This race
will be one of the most spectacular
contests Saturday.
