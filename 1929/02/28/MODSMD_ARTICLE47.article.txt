# Bear Fencer Injured As Card Match Draws Near
## 
### 
With the injury this week of Rode
: cape, one of California's best fencers,
Stanford's chances of victory over the
Bears in the annual fencing meet next
, week have been materially strength
! ened. Rodecape suffered a painful in
jury when an epee sword wielded by
a teammate broke and the jagged
! edge entered his left arm near the
j shoulder. The California coaches do
not think he will be able to enter the
: contest with the Cards.
Coach Maloney and Assistant Coach
| Bugge are working the squad hard in i
preparation for the meet, which is to !
be held at the Harmon Gymnasium in
Berkeley on March 8. Stanford won j
the tournament last year but will have
a hard time repeating, according to
! reports from Berkeley.
Captain Adams, Dutton, Snyder,
Henry, and Poverino will probably
make up the five-man team that will
! meet California, though Taft, Larsen, |
| and Herminghaus are doing good
work and may break into the lineup.
