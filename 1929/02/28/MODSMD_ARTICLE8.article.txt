ences between the Senate and House

tion bill, was adopted late today by

alter a threat of filibuster had given
leaders another scare.
House approval of the report will
send the Navy bill, carrying $12,370,-
000 for starting the cruiser program,
to the White House. Senator Blaine,
Republican, Wisconsin, forced the re
port aside in the Senate early in the
day but when it came up later the
opposition collapsed.

possibility, the opposition yielded and
a vote was permitted.
