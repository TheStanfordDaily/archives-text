ATLANTA, ..Ga., ..Feb. 28. (/P) —
Swelled to flood stage by a 48-hour
downpour of rain, rivers and tribu
taries in Georgia, Alabama, and the
Carolinas swirled out of their banks
today, marooned cities and villages,
impaired rail and highway traffic, and
claimed six lives in one small Georgia
communty.
The Ocmulgee and Oconee rivers in
Georgia, the Coosa, Tombigbee, Black
Warrior, and Tallapoosa rivers in
Alabama, and the Catawba, French
Broad, and Swannanoa in the Caro
linaß were the principal streams af
fected. Wide areas of inundation,
washed out bridges and flooded roads
and rail lines, were reported in the
lowlands of these streams.
Georgia was perhaps the hardest
hit.. Here the torrents of the Ocmulgee
spread out a mile wide, surged within
four blocks of the main business sec
tion of Macon and threatened to over
flow Central City Park. City em
ployees worked throughout last night
and this morning strengthening levees
with sandbags.
Near Lincolnton, Ga., the flood wa
ters today gave up the bodies of six
persons who were drowned in their
automobiles that plunged into the
surging waters of Cherokee Creek
flowing through a washout in the
highway fill. The bodies of Fred A.
McWhorter, prominent attorney and
a state representative-elect, and his
three small children were taken from
the stream this morning, along with
the bodies of Ben F. Foreman of Al
lendale, S.C., and Edward Barrett, 37,
of Grovetown, Ga.
The six victims were occupants of
two cars that plunged off opposite
sides of the washout.
Milledgeville, Ga., was marooned,
Augusta, Ga., protected by levees, was
cut oft from its South Carolina neigh
bor, North Augusta, and the Southern
Railway was forced to re-route its
trains between Macon and Atlanta as
water a foot deep flowed over its
tracks.
Flood stage also was approached by
swollen streams in the Carolinas.
Many streets in Greensboro, N.C.,
were flooded as a result of a two-inch
rain last night.
Central Alabama was threatened
with the worst flood since 1919 as the
rivers rose. Windstorms added to the
damage in both Georgia and Alabama.
