# Washington, Cardinal Forensic Stars Argue Insanity Plea Merits
## 
### 
In the first debate between Stanford
| and the University of Washington in
i recent years, held in the Little Theatre
i last night, the issue of temporary insan
ity as a defense for crime was discussed.
No decision was rendered, in accordance
with an agreement previously made.
Under the rules of the Oregon Cross
Question System of debate which was
employed, John McClintock presented
the entire affirmative case in the initial
speech of the evening. He pointed out
that the plea of temporary insanity has
failed of its purpose to render justice
because juries are not competent to
judge sanity and psychiatrists sell their
services to opposing sides, thus confus
ing the lay jury.
McClintock offered the plan of having
; the jury merely decide upon the guilt or
j innocence of the defendant and later
I allow a state board of alienists to
1 upon the sanity of the individual.
I Charles Strother, first speaker for th â– 
' Washington team, then cross-questioned
i McClintock on his case, obtaining mate
j rial on which his colleague based his
rebuttal.
Sidney Spear next took lip the case for
the negative, claiming that the jury
! could not perform its function of deter
! mining the guilt of an individual with
! out inquiring into his legal responsibility
j for an act. He then pointed out that
! the jury could not determine legal re
sponsibility without first informing itself
I of his sanity, as an individual is not re
j sponsible before the law for his act if he
I is mentally deranged.
When cross-questioned by William L.
Shaw of the Cardinal team, Spear was
successful in cleverly evading most of
the questions. Strothers then took up
the summary and rebuttal for the Seattle
team and was followed by Shaw who
j gave the summary and rebuttal for Stan
i ford.
Harold Shepherd, professor of law at
| Stanford, presided at the meeting and
i decided upon objections which were
j raised during the cross-questioning.
