### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. 28 (/P).
! —The House today engaged in what may
! prove to be its final prohibition argu
l inent of the session, and the Senate prc-
I pared the way for one.
With the end of Congress only three
days away, the prohibition issue and the
j controversy over funds for enforcement
| of the law occupied the attention at both
j sides of the capitol—the House discussing
and later passing the Jones bill to im
pose heavier penalties on dry law of
fenders, and the Senate agreeing to the
second deficiency bill carrying $2,700,000
additional funds for enforcement.
, In taking this action, however, the
i Senate eliminated from the measure a
1 number of items which must go back
into the first deficiency bill from which
they were taken. The latter bill carries
$24,000,000 for the work of curbing the
: illicit liquor traffic and the Senate's move
j will revive that measure.
