# TWO YEARS OF FOOTBALL WITH DARTMOUTH COLLEGE ASSURED
## 
### 
Three years of outstanding intersectional contests were assured the Cardinals |
yesterday with the announcement of a football pact between Stanford and Dart- â– 
mouth College of Hanover, New Hampshire.
The agreement, which takes effect in 1930, calls for a game with the Rig Green |
team in the Stanford Stadium on November 29 of that year, and another contest i

>on November 28, 1931, at some unde-1
termined Eastern Bowl. Each of these j
tilts comes the Saturday following the
Big Game.
Stanford's two-year pact with the Uni
ted States Military Academy ends next
| year when the Cadets travel to the coast
I to tangle with the Redshirts in their own
| backyard. This new pact, which has been
i brewing for some time, was made pos
sible through the efforts of Graduate;
Manager Harry Henage, of Dartmouth, j
and A1 Masters, General Manager of j
the Stanford Board of Athletic Control, j
Dartmouth Strong
The Big Green team is a power in [
Eastern grid circles. Coached by Jesse B. j
Hawley, himself a graduate of Dart
mouth, they should prove a formidable
opponent for the Redshirts. Pop War- j
ner has expressed enthusiastic approval I
over the two-year agreement, declaring |
that any team coached by Hawley should j
prove plenty of competition.
Last year Dartmouth gridmen had an j
off season and lost three or four contests ;
getting off to a good start. It was
] the most disastrous season they have had
for some time. They will probably be
remembered generally for their great
j teams of 1925-26 when, led by Swede
: (Jberlander, ail-American fullback, they
i played havoc with Eastern gridiron ag
gregations.
First Trip West
Just as the Army makes its first trip
to the Pacific Coast in December, Dart
mouth will send a grid team to the slope
for the first time next year. The Hano
verians have never carried their banners
beyond Chicago, where they met North
| western University on the gridiron last
season. The 1931 invasion will be the
second appearance of the Card football
team on the Atlantic seaboard. Their
first Eastern tour came last year and re
sulted in the 26-0 rout of the Army at
the Yankee Stadium.
j The two-year agreement will guaran- I
' tee the Cards an outstanding intersec- |
tional battle for seven out of eight sea- j
sons between 1925 and 1932.
