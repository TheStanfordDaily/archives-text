# CARD TEAMS ARE TO TILT CAL MERMEN
## Varsity, Freshman Aquatic Stars Favored to Beat Bears Tomorrow 
### 
Favored to annex their tenth !
i straight victory, the Stanford varsity
and freshman swimmers take on the i
! California mermen in Encina pool to-j
morrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
I Varsity and freshman events will be
i
I alternated.
Blue and Gold aquatic teams have
| been drowned by Cardinal squads
! since 1920. In the nine annual meets
beginning with that year, Stanford:
j has scored 472 points to 151 for Cali
j fornia. Tomorrow the Reilshirts are ;
j expected to take all first places, but
! there should be some spirited con
[ tests, particularly in the breast
! stroke and back-stroke events.
Records May Fall
It is quite probable that a number
|of records will fall in tomorrow's j
i meet. In this week's trials, Captain
l Ogden Driggs has equaled his own 1
j Pacific Coast Intercollegiate back-1
| stroke record, which he hopes to im
i prove tomorrow afternoon. Driggs
; will swim against Newmeyer, fast
' Blue and Gold star. Driggs is also J
j holder of the U.C.-Card record in the i
I 220-yard free-style, and has bettered
it in practice recently.
Whitey Burns, Card breast-stroker,
i may shave his Pacific Coast record of
i
11:13.2 when he faces Breuner, one:
I of the Bears' best threats. He did it
| in the Northwestern meet by making ,
| 1:14 flat, and he will try hard to re-!
peat. Reggie Harrison has swum the j
1 50-yard sprint in 24.4, one-fifth of a
j second lower than the present coast
1 conference record. He stands to break
it tomorrow. Hadley Bramel, in the
100-yard free-style and Barret Brown
in the back-stroke may also take a j
'hand in the record-smashing.
The diving event will feature Ed j
j Tlirondson, who two weeks ago de
feated Wally Colbath of Northwest
ern, last year's national intercollegi
ate diving champion. Throndson is
certainly one of the foremost collegi
ate divers in the United States.
All the excitement won't be cen- j
tered around the varsity events, for
there are some star freshmen who
will closely approach or even better
some of the marks made in the var
sity contests. Captain Frank Booth
lias smashed the 100-yard back-stroke
lecord in practice this week, and gives
every indication of doing the same
tomorrow.
Austin Clapp, probably the fore
most middle-distance man in the coun- 1
try, was clocked at 2:23 in the 220-
yard free-style trials. He may do even
better against California's yearlings.
The record for this event in Stanford-
California meets is 2:32.
The admission price to the double
intet is twenty-five cents with student [
body cards. Women are admitted.

|of records will fall in tomorrow's j
i meet. In this week's trials, Captain
l Ogden Driggs has equaled his own 1
j Pacific Coast Intercollegiate back-1
| stroke record, which he hopes to im
i prove tomorrow afternoon. Driggs
; will swim against Newmeyer, fast
' Blue and Gold star. Driggs is also J
j holder of the U.C.-Card record in the i
I 220-yard free-style, and has bettered
it in practice recently.
Whitey Burns, Card breast-stroker,
i may shave his Pacific Coast record of
i
11:13.2 when he faces Breuner, one:
I of the Bears' best threats. He did it
| in the Northwestern meet by making ,
| 1:14 flat, and he will try hard to re-!
peat. Reggie Harrison has swum the j
1 50-yard sprint in 24.4, one-fifth of a
j second lower than the present coast
1 conference record. He stands to break
it tomorrow. Hadley Bramel, in the
100-yard free-style and Barret Brown
in the back-stroke may also take a j
'hand in the record-smashing.
The diving event will feature Ed j
j Tlirondson, who two weeks ago de
feated Wally Colbath of Northwest
ern, last year's national intercollegi
ate diving champion. Throndson is
certainly one of the foremost collegi
ate divers in the United States.
All the excitement won't be cen- j
tered around the varsity events, for
there are some star freshmen who
will closely approach or even better
some of the marks made in the var
sity contests. Captain Frank Booth
lias smashed the 100-yard back-stroke
lecord in practice this week, and gives
every indication of doing the same
tomorrow.
Austin Clapp, probably the fore
most middle-distance man in the coun- 1
try, was clocked at 2:23 in the 220-
yard free-style trials. He may do even
better against California's yearlings.
The record for this event in Stanford-
California meets is 2:32.
The admission price to the double
intet is twenty-five cents with student [
body cards. Women are admitted.
Favored to annex their tenth !
i straight victory, the Stanford varsity
and freshman swimmers take on the i
! California mermen in Encina pool to-j
morrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
I Varsity and freshman events will be
i
I alternated.
Blue and Gold aquatic teams have
| been drowned by Cardinal squads
! since 1920. In the nine annual meets
beginning with that year, Stanford:
j has scored 472 points to 151 for Cali
j fornia. Tomorrow the Reilshirts are ;
j expected to take all first places, but
! there should be some spirited con
[ tests, particularly in the breast
! stroke and back-stroke events.
