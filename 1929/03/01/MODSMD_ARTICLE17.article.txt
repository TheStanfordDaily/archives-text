# CONVALESCENT HOME DIRECTORS PLAN NEW STUDENTS' AUXILIARY
## 
### 
Plans for a Student Auxiliary to the ;
Stanford Convalescent Home, and the i
appointment of several students to take
care of the Drive this year, were made [
last night at an informal meeting at the
home of Dr. J. P. Mitchell, treasurer of
the Home.
"I would like to organize a self-per- j
petuating body to take charge of the j
i Student Drive, and the annual Labor I
! Day," said Dr. D. Charles Gardner, pres- |
j ident of the Board of Trustees of the !
j Home. "I believe a Student Auxiliary j
| would simplify the management of the
appeal to the students."
The students present included a num
ber of members of the Executive Com
mittee, and others who were active in
the Drive last year. The group passed a
motion as follows: "That this group re
quest Phil Cavalero to ask the Executive
Committee of the A.S.S.U. to appoint a
committee to collaborate with Dr. Gard- j
tier in drawing up a set of by-laws to be !
incorporated in the By-Laws of the
A.S.S.U. .Constitution, the purpose of
which shall be to establish a Student
Auxiliary of the Stanford Convalescent
j Home for the fostering of interest in the
. Home and the management of student
enterprises to aid the Convalescent
Home.'*
• | Stanford Steinbeck was appointed the
| chairman of the men's Drive for this
• year, and Mary Barstow will manage the
■ i women's Drive. The question of Labor
' Day chairman remains unsettled. Sylva
| Weaver will take charge of publicity.
