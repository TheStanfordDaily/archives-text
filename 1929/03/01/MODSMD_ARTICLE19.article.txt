# CALIFORNIA WINS BOXING JOURNEY BY SINGLE BOUT
## Crowd Disappointed by Slow Fight Put on by Ed Dillon, Beckett in Feature Match Rogers, Frost Get Victories For Cards; Bear Captainâ€™s Strategy Downs Al Doerr 
### John Isaacs 
Winning four out of sevon bouts of
a slow tournament, the University of
California boxers shaded Harry Ma
loney's Cardinal leatherpushers in
the local Pavilion last night.
The evening's greatest disappoint
ment was the supposed feature bout
between Captain Ed Dillon of Stan
ford and Ted Beckett of California
football fame. The big fellows were
not only slow in getting started but
failed to mix it up at any time during
the match. Dillon forced the little
fighting that was done and managed
to land two good blows in the final
round which staggered his opponent,
thus winning the decision.
Rogers Wins
Vance Rogers, rangy Stanford
featherweight, outpointed Ed Nemir,
the "fighting Phi Bete" of Berkeley.
Nemir is a stocky little fighter and
carries a real punch. Nemir forced
the fighting in the opening round; but
as both men tired rapidly toward the
end of the bout, Rogers' longer reach
enabled him frequently to break
through his opponent's guard. Rogers
continued to lead with his right in
the extra and deciding round, and
Nemir was practically out on his feet
at the end of the period.
Experience won the welterweight
bout for Captain Frank Ribbel, of the
Bears, from A1 Doerr. The Stanford
boxer forced the fighting through all
three rounds but was seldom able to
| land a blow.
Danny Frost out-punched Enrico
i Dell'Osso in the lightweight class in
three fast rounds. The men exchanged
blows very evenly throughout the first
! two rounds, but Frost opened up with
a terrific attack in the closing period
I which left Dell'Osso groggy.
Merle Ansberry scored a technical
knockout over Johnny Sano, Stan
ford's featherweight, in the first round.
Sano, who was weakened by a recent
j illness, was out of condition and was
floored three times by the California
j man.
Bout Halted
Bill Hollingsworth was stopped by
George Garner in the opening minute
of thq, light-heavy bout. Garner drop
ped his opponent three times, once
! for a count of nine, when Referee
| John Herget halted the match.
Dwiglit Gribben won the decision
j from Duke Brown, of Stanford, in the
; middleweight division. Gribben is a
| lanky fighter with a longer reach
| than his opponent. Brown forced the
! fighting during the opening minutes
j of the bouts, but tired too rapidly.
Hugh Israel and Harry Stanley fur
: nished the evening's greatest enter
i tainment when they met in an exhibi-
I tion bantamweight bout which proved
to be a laugh-fest. Other exhibition
bouts were: A1 Dubecker vs. Paul
Maurer, Wilbur Kindig vs. Ralph Mal
com, Ed Pos vs. John Dawson, Les
Bryant vs. Milt Cohen, and George
Sherwood vs. Lee Sands.
