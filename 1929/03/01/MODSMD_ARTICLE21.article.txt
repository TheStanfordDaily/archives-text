# Comes Dartmouth
## 
### 
The hibernating football fan welcomes with undisguised glee the news
that Stanford and Dartmouth have signed the necessary documents for
two home-and-home grid games to be played in 1930 and 1931. Coming
as they will after the termination of the West Point-Stanford pact, they
are sure to maintain the good feeling that has come to pass between teams
of Eastern institutions and Cardinal varsities.
Stanford started its bombastic intersectional relations only last year,
when both Pittsburg and Army fell before it. Now, with another contest
scheduled for this year with the Cadets, and then two with the Dart
mouth Greenâ€”all we can say is Thank You, Mr. Masters, and to you,
M r. Warner, Good Luck !
