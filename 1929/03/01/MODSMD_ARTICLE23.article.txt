America and the whole world extend sympathy to France as European
press reports tell of the serious illness of Held Marshal Ferdinand Foch.
Doctors give "The Gray Man of Christ," suffering from lung, heart, and
kidney complications, but ten days more in this world.
An erudite historian, a profound psychologist, an abstruse philosopher,
Foch pondered his craft of military science deeply and to excellent pur
pose. No problem was too great to defy his analysis; no detail too trivial
to escape his concern. Yet he was no armchair soldier, content with mere
knowledge and doctrine. Rather was he a generalissimo who knew that
the lessons which are profitable today must be learned in the past.
Whether he took his ideas from Moltke and Clausewitz or from Napo
leon and Turenne matters but little. Nor can his genius be explained by
maps and diagrams. Ilis was the unperishable belief in the power of the
will to conquer. And on this belief, mystical as it was, were built his
triumphs. From the world-famous Battle of the Marne, with defeat and
cruel humiliation staring at him from the German howitzers, came his
inspired—or insane—catchword: "My center is crushed, my riglit-re
treats ; the situation is excellent—l attack !"
He worshipped leadership; he worshipped the very spirit of the cry of
Onward ; he worshipped Napoleon. It is probably true that Napoleon will
stand higher in the list of Great Captains than will Foch, that Napoleon
forgot more than Foch ever knew. But Napoleon forgot. Foch learned.
