That Colonel Lindbergh is one of the most popular figures in present
day American life, no one will deny. After the Lone Eagle s heroic flight
much speculation was made concerning whom he would marry. but the
modest young man evaded the issue for a long time. Consequently it was
"hot news" when Ambassador and Mrs. Dwight W. Morrow announced
the engagement of their daughter Anne to Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh.
Now comes the aftermath. The thirst of Public Curiosity has been
aroused but not quenched. Reams of copy are being turned out regarding
Lindbergh and his fiancee which the public laps up like cream. We read
from an Associated Press dispatch that "Colonel Lindbergh and Miss
Anne Spencer Morrow today continued in the retreat of Cuernavaca to
enjoy each other's company and to plan for the event of which the world
awaits announcement,"
Another paragraph in the dispatch reads that "the aviator, whom the
public calls 'Lindy/ when he is not in his role of the 'Lone Eagle of the
air' is called Charles by all the members of the Morrow family. Under
the same conditions he addresses his fiancee as Anne. Whether they have
more intimate names between themselves is unknown to outsiders. Now
what business is it of the outsiders if Charles calls her "Annie," or if she
calls him "Charlie"?
Lindbergh owes something to the public press, it is true. Yet he ac
complished his epoch-making flight without the aid of newspapers. The
papers have treated him well in their news and editorial columns. 1 hey
have given him publicity space that would mount into millions of dollars
if computed on minimum advertising rates. Yet this press is exacting its
price by exceeding the bounds of propriety and publicly embarrassing the
man whom it apparently held in so high esteem.
Surely Lindbergh ought to be allowed to woo the Lady of Ilis Heart
in a dark corner rather than in front of the Kleig lights. Public Curiosity
is a venomous thing when it invades the sanctity of a man s private lilt:.
Instead of curbing it, the press is feeding it at present. A newspaper s
code of ethics should measure up to the standards of a gentleman. "Let
good taste govern."
