# The 						Bullsession

Among those things taken for granted
here and in other American colleges is
this: that student government is a fine
thing.
Why is it? Just what has the institu
tion of student government contributed
to the betterment of colleges, or to the
character training of those who partici
pate in it, other than to deprive them of
time which might well be spent in use
ful pursuits?
Some defender will arise to point out
that student government is an excellent
means for training students for their
future duties as citizens, since a college
body politic is somewhat of a tabloid of
the national system.
That is half true. Student government
provides students with training for their
future duties as citizens—mostly the
wrong kind of training. And it is a tab
loid of all the hypocrisy which is found,
and which we students deplore, in real
government. It trains students, not to
be good citizens, but to be good poli
ticians. Another thing entirely.
The United States is infested with
politicians whose business is to coin
money from hypocrisy, who have set out
to earn easy salaries through the despi
cable practice of pandering to money,
crookedness, and ignorance. They set out
through a debasing routine to achieve
that goal.
A certain percentage of college poli
ticians are of the same sort, except that
the pay in this case is not money, but
supposed glory. They set their goal, and

thereafter, with deliberate calculation,
map out a three years' program of hand
shaking, back - scratching, log - rolling,
cheery greeting and other necessary an
tics by which to reach whatever office
may be their goal.
This indictment doesn't apply to many
student officers who have more or less
"fallen" into their offices. And some
times general popularity puts a man into
a job, although most colleges have their
lobbies and machines.
Possibly 10 per cent of student offi
cers are in their positions because they
seek to do some good. The rest want the
glory and the feeling of power. As a
matter of fact, it makes little difference
who gets what job. Any student intelli
gent enough to get into college is in
telligent enough to hold almost any po
litical office therein.
It is probable that the character train
ing received by most dyed-in-the-wool
college politicians does them no good.
As for student bodies as a whole—mean
ing the great mass who do not participate
in the government —they have little voice
and less opinion.
Students, generally, are just as much
not - knowing - what - it - is-all-about and
just as clam-like in their college political
spheres as is the average American citi
zen in his own.
The one outstanding benefit of student
government is this —that it relieves col
lege faculties of bothersome chores.
Aside from that, it is the next thing to
nil.
