Pee-vee. By Fred Jacob. (New York
Macmillan Company. 1929.)

"Pee-vee," besides having the han
dicap of its absurd title, gets off to a
bad start. This is a pity for it really
if a good story. It is hard to say just
what is wrong with the first chapters.
The characters are vague, and the
general movement of the plot is ob
scured by disconcerting shifts back
and forth between the too numerous
members of the Horton family, who
are first introduced.
Then the "small-town" atmosphere
drenches the characters and conver
sation almost to extinction. The read
er's first impression is that the 400
pages of this novel are wholly con
cerned with the effort of three enter
prising native daughters of Peters
ville to run a Tea Shop—reminiscent
of a Sunday School Weekly's most
approved fiction.
However if the reader perseveres
in the fact of all this, he finds that
his first impression was incorrect.
The real interest of Pee-vee is sup
posedly centered in the friendship of
the "Three Musketeers of Petersville"
—Pee-vee, Ted, and David. This takes
it far enough away from the tea shop
to make the book readable, but even
the various exploits of the three —
their difficulties and final successes —
would be feeble entertainment if they
were not laid against the alive and
vivid background of social satire.
Mr. Jacob has as targets two
classes: social snobs, and pseudo
artists. He has been a dramatic critic
of note, himself. He is not guessing
when he writes of pretended art
lovers and petty connossieurs and
their absurd "salons." He is thor
oughly acquainted with these people,
and once started, he romps along at
a great rate, blistering them with
ridicule and swift sarcasm.
The hero Pee-vee becomes a writer
without being spoiled by the extrava
gant adulations of the socially "elect"
and the so-called artistic circles. He
has more than ordinary intellect and
fineness of character but he is a
quiet, normal young man, and his life,
though satisfying, has nothing mem
orable about it. The entire tone of the
book is that way—lifelike, agreeably
familiar, yet a little commonplace.
It is the flashing humor of the
characterizations that safely lifts
"Pee-vee" out of the pleasantly medi
ocre class. Mr. Jacob's style has an

ronically impish twist —more con
irete than subtle, yet shamelessly
•lever. His minor characters are the
best —Gypsy Hagar Bright, for exam
ple, who was the first woman in
Toronto to make free use of the word
"sex" in her general conversation,
and whose "palate always, and whose
stomach frequently, rebelled against
alcoholic beverages, yet who reso
lutely continued to seek them."
Also — "Mrs. Dorothea Decasser
Hunter's golden hair gleamed like a
newly-gilded knob and, seated well
forward in the box, she suggested an
over-blown peony in too small a
vase."
"Pee-vee" is good entertainment. In
addition it gives to American read
ers an encounter with the growth of
national self-consciousness in Canada,
and a glimpse of its social history.

book is that way—lifelike, agreeably
familiar, yet a little commonplace.
It is the flashing humor of the
characterizations that safely lifts
"Pee-vee" out of the pleasantly medi
ocre class. Mr. Jacob's style has an

ronically impish twist —more con
irete than subtle, yet shamelessly
•lever. His minor characters are the
best —Gypsy Hagar Bright, for exam
ple, who was the first woman in
Toronto to make free use of the word
"sex" in her general conversation,
and whose "palate always, and whose
stomach frequently, rebelled against
alcoholic beverages, yet who reso
lutely continued to seek them."
Also — "Mrs. Dorothea Decasser
Hunter's golden hair gleamed like a
newly-gilded knob and, seated well
forward in the box, she suggested an
over-blown peony in too small a
vase."
"Pee-vee" is good entertainment. In
addition it gives to American read
ers an encounter with the growth of
national self-consciousness in Canada,
and a glimpse of its social history.

Pee-vee. By Fred Jacob. (New York
Macmillan Company. 1929.)

"Pee-vee," besides having the han
dicap of its absurd title, gets off to a
bad start. This is a pity for it really
if a good story. It is hard to say just
what is wrong with the first chapters.
The characters are vague, and the
general movement of the plot is ob
scured by disconcerting shifts back
and forth between the too numerous
members of the Horton family, who
are first introduced.
Then the "small-town" atmosphere
drenches the characters and conver
sation almost to extinction. The read
er's first impression is that the 400
pages of this novel are wholly con
cerned with the effort of three enter
prising native daughters of Peters
ville to run a Tea Shop—reminiscent
of a Sunday School Weekly's most
approved fiction.
However if the reader perseveres
in the fact of all this, he finds that
his first impression was incorrect.
The real interest of Pee-vee is sup
posedly centered in the friendship of
the "Three Musketeers of Petersville"
—Pee-vee, Ted, and David. This takes
it far enough away from the tea shop
to make the book readable, but even
the various exploits of the three —
their difficulties and final successes —
would be feeble entertainment if they
were not laid against the alive and
vivid background of social satire.
Mr. Jacob has as targets two
classes: social snobs, and pseudo
artists. He has been a dramatic critic
of note, himself. He is not guessing
when he writes of pretended art
lovers and petty connossieurs and
their absurd "salons." He is thor
oughly acquainted with these people,
and once started, he romps along at
a great rate, blistering them with
ridicule and swift sarcasm.
The hero Pee-vee becomes a writer
without being spoiled by the extrava
gant adulations of the socially "elect"
and the so-called artistic circles. He
has more than ordinary intellect and
fineness of character but he is a
quiet, normal young man, and his life,
though satisfying, has nothing mem
orable about it. The entire tone of the
book is that way—lifelike, agreeably
familiar, yet a little commonplace.
