## Thinks Stanford Is All Right 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A study of the New ork World Al
manac for 1929 reveals that Lcland Stan
ford University stands sixth among the
universities of the Ignited States in
amount of endowment (Harvard is first
with $82,000,000), seventeenth in number
of teachers, and thirty-third in number
of students (Columbia is first with 36,-
000). A pondering of these litres will
provide Stanford "soreheads with ade
quate medication. 'I o know that there
arc tliirty-two universities with a larper
student body, but only sixteen with more
teachers and only five with more money j
should help thern to feel that life in the J
old "IT is not such a handicap after all.

Of course there is the question of the
efficiency of our larger teacher-forcc
per-student and the question of the wise
use of our endowment proceeds, but the
figures continue to stand boldly out. In
the long run the minor factors ot the
efficiency of standard products, as of
teachers and money, are accounted for by
the well-known laws of economic neces
sity.
