# CABBAGES and THINGS

### Philip Space 
This gasoline war has been a great
thing for our cigarette lighter.
Then, too, it has put explosions
within the reach of all.
Now if the Union and Encina would
only have a milk war we might stop
our coffee drinking.
Item —Footprints are now declared
to be as accurate as finger prints in
detecting identity.
It is understood that the elec
tion board, in addition to compar
ing signatures, will in the future
have all voters walk barefoot
over black flypaper, and then
step on a specially prepared blot
ter. The blotter will be placed
alongside the one obtained from
each student on registration day,
and the innocence or guilt of the
victim will be established.
It is always the election board's aim
to make voting a duty as well as a
pleasure.
What with the new vari-tinted
ballots, it is expected that a test
for color blindness will also pre
clude illiterate voting.
Freshmen, of course, will object to
their ballots being colored green.
Euphronia thinks a race riot is a
free-for-all at a track meet.
Today's worst pun comes from the
; lad who declared that the proposed
; links for Stanford would be unhealthy,
j since they would result in severe
! golfing spells.
The Metaphor song is, we are
i afraid, "I Knew She'd Go Out Riding;
That's What I Metaphor."
Yesterday's Daily swimming story
says:
"As might be expected, Austin Clapp
did the unusual. ... He will prob
ably do better yet Saturday."
He may even disappoint his friends
and break a record.
From the S.F. Bulletin —
"Awakened early today by heavy
foosteps of a prowler, Mary Lister,
21, 1541 Edith Street, chased an un
identified man for several blocks, but
the man was not apprehended."
She probably thought it was Leap
Year.
(/P) story from the Bulletin —
. . . Mrs. C. V. Jacobs, 53, who was
burned severely Monday when a
stranger attempted to force her into
a hot furnace, was resting more com
fortably today in a local hospital.
We should think almost anything
would be more comfortable.
WASHINGTON, D.C., Feb. 28 (£•).—
Expenditures of $9,433,604 on behalf of
the Republican ticket in the last national
campaign, and of $7,152,511 for the
Democratic ticket—including in both in
