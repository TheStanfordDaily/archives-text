# STANFORD "500" ARE NOT AS SERIOUS AS COPENHAGEN WOMEN
## Philosophy, Popular Major With European Women, Is Not Liked Here 
### Martha Judson 
Stanford women may not be as
philosophically minded as European
co-eds, but their minds at least run
Iu thirty different directions. They
do not all flock the same way in their
intellectual pursuits. One-tliird of the
women of Copenhagen University are
said to major in philosophy, while
Stanford can boast of only three so
registered this quarter. If philosophy
is considered one of the hardest ma
jors, how does that speak for the
seriousness of purpose of the Five
Hundred?
There are, however, only 22 people
in the university majoring in philo
sophy, and it has been found that
nowhere in the United States is it as
popular as it is in almost every Euro
pean university.
At Stanford the subject most ma
jored in by women is English. His
tory runs a close second, and social
science comes next. But the 49
registered in English and the 42
in history are respectively only
16 and 14 per cent of the total number
of Upper Division and graduate wo
men. Of the 41 major subjects in the
curriculum, women major in 30. There
are no women registered now in any
of the departments of the School of
Engineering, nor in bacteriology or
accountancy.
There are four departments in
which only one girl is majoring, and
five with only two. In the subject by
far the most popular with the men,
economics, only 21 women are regis
tered, as contrasted to 414 men.
Among the women, there are more
graduates than undergraduates regis
tered in education, chemistry, physi
ology, law, botany, and physics.
There are five departments in which
more women than men are majoring.
In French, 70 per cent are co-eds. The
other four, ranging from 66 to 57 per
cent, are graphic art, public speak
ing, Spanish, and English. Those in
which the percentage of women is
smallest are law, in which the two
women are only a little more than
one per cent, pre-medical and pre
clinical each with 3 per cent, and
geology with 4 per cent. And those
in which the ratio is nearest to the
five-to-one ratio of the whole student
body are botany, zoology, and philo
sophy.
