# OPERA TO BE ADOPTED TO TALKIES; FAMOUS PRIMA DONNA IS MOVIE FAN
## Geraldine Farrar Was First Operatic Star to Appear in Movies; Says Singers Still Handicapped by Poor Sight, Sound Film Combination

"Opera will eventually be successfully
adapted to talking moving pictures,"
Geraldine Farrar said when she was in
San Francisco recently. "Right now we
singers are handicapped because the film
combination of sight and sound has not
been perfected.
"Mary Lewis and Martinelli are the
only two opera stars who have appeared
in talkies with any degree of success.
Some method must be evolved whereby
tonal qualities will be registered correct
ly by the microphones. And something
must take the place of the tiresome
close-up.
"I am a great admirer of the picture
industry. I have been a fan ever since
the days when I helped pioneer in it."
Miss Farrar was the first grand opera
star to appear in the movies. "It was a
delightful way to spend the summers—
making pictures in Hollywood was a
vacation from the New York opera.
"My friends in the industry tell me
that I wouldn't recognize a studio set
now. There have been so many changes
and improvements." When the talkies
grow out of their infancy Miss Farrar
may be induced to sing for the screen.
Years ago she made silent versions of
"Carmen" and other operatic hits.
At present she is making a concert
tour of the United States. Several years
ago she made a triumphal exit from the
stage of the Metropolitan Opera House—
"I wanted to retire when I was forty and
at the opera career. I am no longer per
sonally interested in grand opera. All
that 1 have put behind me. Now my sole
interest is in concert work."
Miss Farrar's hair is silvery gray. She
is a very animated and striking-looking
personage. She differs from the majority
of opera stars in that she is handsome
and has an attractive figure. When she
appeared in concert in San Francisco
she won a tremendous personal ovation,
her ability as an actress being almost as

evident as her ability as a singer.
After her performance several hun
dred admirers of bygone opera days
swarmed backstage where "Gerry," as
she signed many of the autograph books,
held open house with regal and gracious
friendliness.
