## 
### 
The Sarah Kolb Danner exhibition will
be on display in the Stanford Art Gallery
for another week, reports Director Pe
dro Lemos, head of the Stanford Mu
seum.
It is to be replaced by the work of
Frank Marshall, of Palo Alto. His dis
play is scheduled to remain for the rest
of March.
The Danner exhibition is one of the
most notable the gallery has obtained.
Mrs. Danner aroused public interest in
her work as early as 1921, when her still
life painting "Copper and Brass," shown
in an exhibit in Indianapolis, attracted
the attention of Middle West artists.
This picture is among those now hang
ing in the Stanford Gallery.
Since 1923 Mrs. Danner has been
prominent in art circles of the Fast and
Middle West, and her work has been
shown in Philadelphia, New York, and
Boston.
"Eucalyptus Trees" is one of the out
standing paintings in the collection here,
showing a technique entirely different
from others of her production. The rath
er flat treatment of the subject is unique,
yet does not detract from the general
charm of the group of trees. The "Span
ish Fiesta" is a lively colorful scene
from El Paso, in which the artist has
undertaken and executed well the difficult
task of correctly portraying the vivid
movement of a Spanish group.
Art critics wherever Mrs. Danner has
exhibited have been high in their praise
of her work.
