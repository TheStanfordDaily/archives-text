# OLYMPIC CLUB TEAM EXPECTED TO DEFEAT STANFORD TRACK MEN
## Former Cardinal Stars Will Compete For Winged "0" In Meet March 9 
### 
When Coach Dink Templeton's var
sity track team meets the Olympic
Club squad in the Stadium March 9,
the affair will bear close resemblance
to an alumni homecoming with Stan
ford stars of the past few years in
large part making up the Winged "O"
team. Among them there will be West
and Bullis in the hurdles, and pos
sibly Leistner; Dyer in the broad
jump; Storie, and perhaps Spencer, |
in the quarter mile; and King in the
high jump.
With this formidable array of stars
competing for the club, there is lit
tle chance of the Cards trimming the
Olympics by an 87 to 44 score again J
this year. West was a double winner \
in the hurdles against the club last '
year; and Dyer, Spencer, and King
are all accounted for first places. ]
Against tljifJ group Of "oiil grads," |
Tempieton will have Nichols, Smith, i
Edmonds, and Nelson in the hurdles;
Zombro, Dowell, and West in the
broad jump; and Morrison and Shove
in the 440. In the high jump there is
no one to replace Bob King, intercol
legiate and Olympic champion.
With the exception of the jumps, 1
the field events should be pretty much j
all Stanford. Krenz, Rothert, and For- i
ster should make a clean sweep in
the shot; Edmonds is good for a first
in the pole vault; and Sparling, Kibby, !
and Perelli-Minetti will have things
their own way in the javelin if Tom j
Joaquin doesn't compete for the club, j
Little is known about the Olympic
Club entries in the distance ruus. In
the sprints Sweet, who turned in
9 4-5 s. and 21 3-5 s. performances
against the Cards last year, will be
matched against Ilec Dyer and John
Lauritzen.
