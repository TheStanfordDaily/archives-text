# STANFORD BASEBALL TEAM MEETS BRONCO NINE HERE TOMORROW
## Twelve Straight Wins, One Tie With California Is Santa Clara Record 
### 
Santa Clara's varsity baseball team,
with twelve straight victories and a tie
to its credit, will play the Card nine here
tomorrow at 2 :30 o'clock on the varsity
diamond. The Broncos already hold two
wins over Stanford, the first by an 11 to
9, and the second by a 6 to 3 score.
Santa Clara and the University of
California nines battled to a twelve-in
ning 4-4 deadlock at Berkeley last Wed
nesday, the game being called on account
of darkness. Coach Fitzgerald, of the
Broncs, used pitchers Casanova and Si
moni against the Bears, so will probably
start Regan on <the mound tomorrow.
The latter is credited with one of the
victories that the Mission College holds
over the Cards.
Although the Broncs have won twelve
games this season, they were decidedly
lucky in their contests with the Red
shirts. In each game, Stanford's varsity
batters outhit their opponents almost two
to one, but wild pitching walked in many
runs in the first, and poor infielding con
tributed to the defeat in the second.
Behind some fine pitching by Bill Sim
kins, the Cards slugged their way to a
win over the strong St. Mary's team
Wednesday by a 7 to 4 score. A victory
tomorrow will put the varsity back in
the running in the California Intercol
legiate Baseball Association, where they
are now undisputed holders of the cellar
position.
Coach Harry Wolters may start Gene
Kern against the Broncs tomorrow after
noon. Kern worked well against Santa
Clara in the second game, but received
very poor support from the infield. Lew
is and Smalling are also in line to work,
and may see action before the end of the
contest. Hardy will catch.
