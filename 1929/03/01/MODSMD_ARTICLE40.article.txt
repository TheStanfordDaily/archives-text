# RYAN'S HIGH VOLTAGE LABORATORY TO HAVE EXPERIMENTAL TUNNEL
## 
### 
Work has been started at the Ryan
High Voltage Laboratory on a tunnel to j
be used in the study of the effect of the j
combination of dust, fog, and wind on j
high voltage insulators.
The Los Angeles Bureau of Power
and Light is co-operating with Dr. Har
ris J. Ryan in this experimental work.
B. Cozzens, '27, who is a research engi
neer with the Bureau, and who has been j
connected with the laboratory for some j
time, is directing the work.
Injections of superheated water and |
dust will be blown on a thirty-mile-per
hour gale through the tunnel by an elec- j
trically driven fan to alight on the in- :
sulators and simulate actual power line I
conditions. It is expected that the con- j
struction of the tunnel will require about !
two weeks, Cozzens said.
