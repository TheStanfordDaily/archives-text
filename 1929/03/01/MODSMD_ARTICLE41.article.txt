# Men's Council Bars Noon Parking At Stanford P.O.
## 
### 
No parking will be allowed in the j
future on the left side of Salvatierra 1
street from Lasuen to Arguello
streets and in front of the postoffice |
during the minutes between noon and ,
12:30, it was announced today by A.
E. Roth, comptroller.
This action was recommended to
the University by the Men's Council
because of the narrowness of Salva- ,
tierra street and the congestion dur- ,
ing the noon-time rush at the post
office.
