## AMERICA'S PASTIME 
### 
It used to be, that in the spring
time, a young man's fancy turned to
love —or baseball, but now there are
: other sports.
Baseball, generally known as the
great American pastime, seems to be
giving away in some sections of the
country, especially those where the
weather is prohibitive during the win
ter, to such sports as golf, tennis,
spring football practice, and what not.
But here on the coast there is no rea
son for it.
At Stanford, for instance, base
ball is a major sport, and de
serves to be classed with football
and the other sports that receive
the same rating. The Cards have
a well-coached and generally
smart aggregation this year, al
though they have lost three out
of their four conference games
to date. On the other hand, sev
eral of the semi-pro teams of the
t San Fran<?i§co Winter LeaguSr
1 who carry a roster of big league
and minor league stars, and are
generally considered good compe
tition, fell before the attack of the
Cards.
The Redshirts have a great compe
titive team this season, having come
l'rom behind several times to defeat
; their opponents. Ralph Cook, first
baseman; Churchill, second-baseman;
; Dyke Johnson, shortstop; and Captain
i Frank Wilton are the club's heavy
; stickers.
Behind the plate, Spud Hardy,
catcher on last year's frosh team, has
been handling the situation credit
; ably. He does a nice job of backstop
j ping hut his pegs to second are still
' a little off color.
Around the bases are Ralph Cook,
frcm last year's yearlings, playing a
bang-up game at the initial sack, with
Churchill, a sub from last year's var
sity, still a little weak on covering
second. At the shortstop position is
Dyke Johnston, also from last year's
yearlings, and who is breaking into
varsity ball in great style. Billy Laird
at third, is the same dependable Bill
of last year, which makes the hot
corner a safe spot.
In the outfield is Hunken, a new
comer from last year's frosh, who so
far, especially in his fielding, has
i shown up well. However, he still has
| room for improvement at the plate.
I Captain Frank Wilton in center field,
and Harry Berg in right, are two com
; petitive athletes who may always be
j depended on to come through with a
; hit when needed, and as far as their
I fielding goes there need to be 110
1 cause for worx-y either.
Coach Harry Wolter has a large
assortment of mound artists from
which to pick. Doug Lewis, al
though he has not yet reached
mid-season form, looks like a win
ner, as does Bill Simkins, who
has developed a great deal during
the past year. Gene Kern, one of
the Cards' most dependable
pitchers in 1928, has failed to
come through as expected so far.
Perry Taylor and Chuck Snialling
have also been bearing a portion
of the pitching burden.
All in all—it is a well-rounded
team —and what is more, they are
confident of taking California this
year, which will be unusual in
view of the fact that the Cards
have not won a series from their
old rival in this sport since the
days when Ernie Nevers was the
team's best pitcher and batter, in
fact most of the team.
Baseball continues to be the great
American pastime. It is an interesting
game to watch, and draws greater
; crowds than any other sport. They
can fill their arenas periodically for
prizefights, and their stadiums once a
I week for football games, but no sport
can draw the crowds day after day,
year after year, like baseball.

The Redshirts have a great compe

l'rom behind several times to defeat

baseman; Churchill, second-baseman;
; Dyke Johnson, shortstop; and Captain
i Frank Wilton are the club's heavy
; stickers.
Behind the plate, Spud Hardy,
catcher on last year's frosh team, has
been handling the situation credit
; ably. He does a nice job of backstop
j ping hut his pegs to second are still
' a little off color.
Around the bases are Ralph Cook,
frcm last year's yearlings, playing a
bang-up game at the initial sack, with
Churchill, a sub from last year's var
sity, still a little weak on covering
second. At the shortstop position is
Dyke Johnston, also from last year's
yearlings, and who is breaking into
varsity ball in great style. Billy Laird
at third, is the same dependable Bill
of last year, which makes the hot
corner a safe spot.
In the outfield is Hunken, a new
comer from last year's frosh, who so
far, especially in his fielding, has
i shown up well. However, he still has
| room for improvement at the plate.
I Captain Frank Wilton in center field,
and Harry Berg in right, are two com
; petitive athletes who may always be
j depended on to come through with a
; hit when needed, and as far as their
I fielding goes there need to be 110
1 cause for worx-y either.
Coach Harry Wolter has a large
assortment of mound artists from
which to pick. Doug Lewis, al
though he has not yet reached
mid-season form, looks like a win
ner, as does Bill Simkins, who
has developed a great deal during
the past year. Gene Kern, one of
the Cards' most dependable
pitchers in 1928, has failed to
come through as expected so far.
Perry Taylor and Chuck Snialling
have also been bearing a portion
of the pitching burden.
All in all—it is a well-rounded
team —and what is more, they are
confident of taking California this
year, which will be unusual in
view of the fact that the Cards
have not won a series from their
old rival in this sport since the
days when Ernie Nevers was the
team's best pitcher and batter, in
fact most of the team.
Baseball continues to be the great
American pastime. It is an interesting
game to watch, and draws greater

can fill their arenas periodically for
prizefights, and their stadiums once a

can draw the crowds day after day,
year after year, like baseball.

corner a safe spot.
In the outfield is Hunken, a new
comer from last year's frosh, who so
far, especially in his fielding, has
i shown up well. However, he still has
| room for improvement at the plate.
I Captain Frank Wilton in center field,
and Harry Berg in right, are two com
; petitive athletes who may always be
j depended on to come through with a
; hit when needed, and as far as their
I fielding goes there need to be 110
1 cause for worx-y either.
Coach Harry Wolter has a large
assortment of mound artists from
which to pick. Doug Lewis, al
though he has not yet reached
mid-season form, looks like a win
ner, as does Bill Simkins, who
has developed a great deal during
the past year. Gene Kern, one of
the Cards' most dependable
pitchers in 1928, has failed to
come through as expected so far.
Perry Taylor and Chuck Snialling
have also been bearing a portion
of the pitching burden.
All in all—it is a well-rounded
team —and what is more, they are
confident of taking California this
year, which will be unusual in
view of the fact that the Cards
have not won a series from their
old rival in this sport since the
days when Ernie Nevers was the
team's best pitcher and batter, in
fact most of the team.
Baseball continues to be the great
American pastime. It is an interesting
game to watch, and draws greater
; crowds than any other sport. They
can fill their arenas periodically for
prizefights, and their stadiums once a
I week for football games, but no sport
can draw the crowds day after day,
year after year, like baseball.
