# PAVILION TO BECOME FOREIGN LEGION TENT FOR MILITARY DANCE
## 
### 
A huge tent, gaily bedecked with
the red and blue of the French For
eign Legion, its open windows look
ing out upon the great Sahara and
the blue desert skyâ€”thus will the
Pavilion appear to those attending
the Military Ball Friday night, March
8.
A noteworthy feature of the dance
will be the music furnished by Bob
Beale's Athens Club Orchestra which
is to play in a specially constructed
canopied recess directly opposite the
entrance. This band is scheduled to
arrive at 9:30, and before that time
a five-piece campus orchestra will
syncopate for those present.
Programs for the Ball will have
covers of a rich blue leather with a
diagonal band of red leather ending
in a thong for easy carrying. In one
corner will appear the seal of Scab
bard and Blade, which is sponsoring
(he dance. The pages within the cover
will be decorated in a manner to
carry out the Foreign Legion theme
upon which the whole affair is being
planned.
While the number of bids already
sold indicates that a great many per
sons will attend the ball, a few re
main available at the A.S.S.U. office
in the Old Union.
