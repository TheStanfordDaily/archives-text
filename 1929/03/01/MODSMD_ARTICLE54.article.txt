# FROSH DEFEAT JUNIOR BASKETBALL SQUAD IN SEASON'S BEST GAME
## 
### 
Playing the fastest and closest
game of the season, the freshman wo-1
men's basketball squad downed the j
junior outfit by the scant margin of j
;two points, the final score being 27-
I 25. Though the .frosli led throughout j
i the first three quarters, they were j
| given a tough battle in the last period.
In those final few minutes it looked
jas though the undefeated first-year !
t players were doomed to lose the i
! contest.
Good teamwork, especially on the I
' part of the Ophuls and Snyder guard
j combination for the freshman squad,
i was evident. Marion Holley, star jun
! ior forward, chalked up 25 of their
j 27 points, making the best forward i
i record so far. Dorothy Sweet and
j Betts Hawkins shared point honors on
the freshman sextet.
With the- second lap of the inter
! class series well started, the teams â– 
are rounding up into fair form. Of
j the three contests each class played !
in the first round, the frosli won
j three, seniors two, juniors one, and
the sophs lost all three. A freshman
| senior competition will take place j

| Monday.
