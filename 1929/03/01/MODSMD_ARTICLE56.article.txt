In order to play safe in the selection ,
of men for employment in the Bell Sys
tem, the company rarely chooses men
whose scholarship records are low, al- j
though it tries never to consider scholar- :
ship alone to the exclusion of all other
factors. This is the company's policy as !
outlined by Roy J. HefTner, assistant edu- i
cation director ot the Bell Telephone
Laboratories in New York, who has been
on the campus this week interviewing
men seeking employment with his com- ;
pany. J
This policy is an interpretation of a ;
thorough study made by the Bell people, i
"We actually dug out the records of 8600 ;
college graduates employed by the Bell ,
System throughout the United States," I
Heffner said. "The men's names were i
compiled in lists by colleges, and we j
asked the college officials to classify the j
men in the lirst, second, and medium
third groups, and in the first ten of the
class. Plotting salaries against years out
of college, spot diagrams were made
which showed that the higher the scho
lastic standing the further was the indi-;
vidual's progress in the industry. Men in j
the highest ten of their class were getting
rapid increases in salary at the age of
thirty. Of course, there were exceptions
to this general rule.
"Other factors that we consider in ad- i
dition to scholarship are a good person- !
ality, adaptability, broad interests, ability |
to get along with and co-operate with |
people, and a fundamental rather than a j
specialized training. The importance of !
these factors, together with outside ac- ;
tivities, athletics, and proportion of col- !
lege expenses earned, are now being J
studied by the Bell System, but we can- j
not say definitely now when the results !
will be completed."
