# THREE FROSH WOMEN MAKE VARSITY TEAM IN DEBATING TRYOUTS
## 
### 
The freshman class secured a small
triumph last night when three fresh
man women obtained a place on the
varsity debating team in the tryouts
held for the debate of April 2. They
were Hallien Hickman, Elizabeth
Jackson, and Anna Hightower. Violet
('rosbie, president of Wranglers, wo
men's debating society, will be the
fourth member of the team.
For three freshmen to make the
varsity team is an unusual event. Of
the three only one has had previous
experience in debating 011 the campus.
Elizabeth Jackson early in the win
ter quarter took part in political de
bates for the socialist party, touring
the country in its behalf.
A novel arrangement has been
made for the April contest, in which
four colleges, Mills, California, College
of the Pacific, and Stanford will par
ticipate. Each college will have four
representatives, but no two girls from
the same college will be colleagues.
The four debates will take place
simultaneously, with all the schools
sending one girl to each of them.
The subject for the debate will be:
"Is the present popular contempt of
Puritanism justified?"
An unusually large turnout ap
peared at the tryouts, which were
held at the Women's Clubhouse.
