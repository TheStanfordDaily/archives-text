"The Wild Duck," to be presented
on the campus at 8:15 tonight, is more
than just another Ibsen play—it is a
character study of the dramatist him
self. In his previous dramas, "Ghosts"
and "A Doll's House," the ethical
problem of the importance of truth in
every marriage had caused so much
discussion and criticism that he be
gan to doubt himself. And in this play,
Gregers Werle, who goes around forc
ing the "claim of the ideal" on others,
is Ibsen's conception of the harm he
may have done with his theories.
Mullins Part Good
Stanley Mullin, noted for his work
a few years ago in "John Ferguson,"
plays the part of this young idealist
who comes into a home which, while
founded on hypocrisy and a lie, is
yet happy. And by telling them the
truth, he brings destruction and ruin
into the lives of the three people he
loves. The young girl, Hedvig, whose
death is the result of the idealist's
preaching, is a portrait of the play
wright's sister. She is interpreted by
Kathleen Fitz.
Gina, the self-effacing wife who has
i always concealed the truth from her
hupband, is played by Helen Sterling,
who is the only member of the cast
who has don£ professional work. Also
she is one of the two actors who have
appeared in previous English Club
! plays. In the 1925 campus production
of "Macbeth," Mrs. Sterling, then
Helen Feldman, did a notable per
j formance as Lady Macbeth. Since
then she has taken part in several
i plays in the East before returning
i to the University.
Difficult Play
Without a doubt, "The Wild Duck"
! has offered more difficulties, both in
acting and in scenic design, than any
other recent campus play. With lines
which may be interpreted either
realistically or symbolically, in a liu
! morous or a tragic manner, it pre
sents more subtleties of characteriza
tion than any other drama of the past
season. Tom Henry, as Hjalmar, a
' selfish, hypocritical man who believes
himself sincere, has the most difficult
male lead of many years.
Helling, played by George Mauser,
is the antithesis of the idealist. He is
a man who advocates the theory that
! a lie is many times more important
than the truth, claiming that every
; one must have a life illusion. Old
1 Ekdal, Hjalmar's broken-spirited
father, is interpreted by Burnell
Gould, who took the part of the faint
\ ing constable in last quarter's Sopho
more Play. Jeanette Owens will be
, seen as the sophisticated widow, Mrs.
Sorby, who keeps house for the mer
chant, Werle, played by Robert Cath-
I cart, who appeared in last year's Eng
lish Club play, "Caesar and Cleo
| patra."
