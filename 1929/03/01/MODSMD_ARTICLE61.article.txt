# FROSH NINE IMPROVED FOR GAME WITH PREP SLUGGERS TOMORROW
## 
### BOB RICKLEFS 
A greatly improved Stanford freshman
nine will take tiie field tomorrow morn
ing at 10 o'clock against the Lowell
High School team. In the last three
games, the babes have displayed good
baseball ability in all departments of the
game. Hitting has been better than usual
with Barsumian, Rintala, White, and
Marks leading the attack. Pitcher Mc-
Lean has also hit much too good for a
chucker in all the games he has worked.
Husky Hunt has ati infield combina
tion now that seems satisfactory. Marks
at first base fields and catches consistent
ly, and Barsumian at second, White at
short, and Kelly at third base form an
air-tight trio.
The outfielders, contrary to custom, are
not as strong hitters as the infield. Rin
tala, Fox, Waterman, and Griggs are
doing most of the work in the outer
| gardens, and with the exception of Rin
tala, their hitting has been mediocre and
: inconsistent.
The catching is well taken care of by
I Evans and Dixon. Dixon has the better
: throwing arm, but Evans has been play
: ing a better brand of baseball behind the
plate. Evans will get the call in tomor
row's game. Caddel, who will start on
the mound for the babes, is in good con
dition and should handle the high school
sluggers easily. In last Saturday's con
j test with the San Mateo Junior College,
he fanned eighteen batters.
