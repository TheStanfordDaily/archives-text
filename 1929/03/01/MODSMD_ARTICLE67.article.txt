# DR WILLIS TALKS TO STANFORD GEOLOGISTS ON TEXAS OIL FIELDS
## 
### 
Tlie difficulties facing petroleum
' geologists in the West Texas oil fields
! and the manner in which the fields
' themselves are being extended and at
! the same time controlled to prevent
1 overproduction, were the main themes
of Dr. Robin Willis' talk before the
; Stanford Geological and Mining So
: ciety labt night.
I Because of the almost complete ab
! sence of surface indications of sub
' surface structures and the necessity
i of determining the latter almost en
tirely from examination of well sam
ples, no one has as yet been able to
j conclusively prove just how the great
i oil fields in West Texas were formed.
! The latest, and most probable, theory
is that the oil has accumulated in
limestone reefs built up in some past
{ age of marine life.
In order to prevent further over
| production in an already overloaded
; market, the companies which have
] the largest leases in these fields have
' agreed to regulate the amount of oil
J which each may produce. This regula
j lion is based upon the capacity of the
| wells and the acreage held by each
company. This action, Dr. Willis said,
i prevents these fields from becoming
j the menace to the oil market, which
1 their potential production would other
wise make them.
Dr. Willis, son of Professor Bailey
Willis, graduated from Stanford in
1920 and later received his Master's
degree here. He has spent the last
| four years in West Texas where he
i worked for one of the large oil com
i panies and did consulting geological
I work.
