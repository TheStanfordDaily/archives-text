# FOCH RESTRICTED TO LIQUID DIET; HEALTH CONTINUES TO FAIL
## 
### 
PARTS, Feb. 28 (/P).â€”Marshal Ferdi
nand Foch this evening was restricted to
liquid food for the first time since his
collapse on January 14. His stomach,
which had been his staunch ally in his
fight against a complication of diseases,
shows signs of weakening and has caused
great perturbation among his physicians.
Dr. Daveniere said tonight that the
marshal had taken only a quart of milk
and vichy water since early afternoon.
The temperature of the old soldier had
its customary evening rise after having
been somewhat lower this morning. It
was about 101 degrees at 10 p.m.
While Marshal Foch is well prepared
for death, he still believes lie will recover
from his present devastating illness,
friends say.
These friends have an intense admira
tion for the fortitude with which the
aged warrior has borne the suffering of
his infirmity, the patience with which he
has submitted to treatment, and withal
the keenness of his intellect.
But they do not share the marshal's
hope. Fvery flay now finds his strength
reduced still more and makes more ap
parent that in view of his seventy-eight
years it is remarkable that he has resisted
so long.
His life, one of his friends said, is a
flame still burning steadily, but at the
mercy of the least puff of wind. To
shield it from such a puff is the constant
endeavor of the marshal's medical attend
ants and his family.
