# VALUABLE BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS ARE ON DISPLAY AT LIBRARY
## 
### 
A large, carefully bound volume en
titled "An Encyclopedia of Masonic,
Hermetic, Cabalistic, Rosicrucian, Sym
bolical Philosophy" by Mauley P. Hall
forms the nucleus of a collection of val
uable manuscripts and books now on
display in the Library. The book was
planned by John Henry Nash and pub
lished in 1928 by H. S. Crocker Sons.
The majority of works in the display are
in connection with the Rosicrucian So
ciety and are loaned through the cour
tesy of Mr. Hall.
The organization of Rosicrucians is a
secret religious society, which was found
ed in 1420 by Christian Rosencreuz and
has remained active up until the present
day.
Among the older books of the collec
tion is "The Advancement and Profi
cience of Learning" by Sir Francis Ba
con. It is from the 1640 edition, which
is considered the first true English edi
tion. Bacon was a Rosicrucian who
joined the society through the influence
of Robert Fludd, the greatest English
Freemason and Rosicrucian. Fludd's
book, "Collectio Operum," published in
1617, and a Baconian dictionary published
in 1626, written in nine different lan
guages, are on display in the same case.
Two other modern books on the Rosi
crucian movement are "Secret Symbols
of the Rosicrucians," by Franz Hartman,
and a bound collection of colored plates,
"The Arms of Our Lord, Jesus Christ."
Both are exhibited in the collection.
A book, "Pseudo Shakespeare," con
tains the famous and original Shake
spearean forgeries and fabrications by
William H. Y. Ireland. Ireland contin
ued his grafting practices for many
years before he was discovered. His
signed confessions are in the book.
An official document bearing the signa
ture of Emperor Napoleon I is the most
noteworthy of the manuscripts in the
collection. On documents such as this
is. Napoleon signed his name with a large
scrawly "Nap." However, as consul of
the Empire he wrote his name as "Bou
naparte" and in a careful hand. Another
interesting paper is a legal document on
vellum with the huge Victorian seal at
tached. The seal is four inches in diame
ter and more than an inch in thickness.
