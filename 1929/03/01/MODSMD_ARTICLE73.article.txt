# BAILEY WILLIS THINKS 13 MONTH CALENDAR IS HIGHLY DESIRABLE

Although he regards as highly desir
able the introduction of the thirteen
month year, Bailey Willis, professor
of geology, emeritus, doubts the ready
acceptance of the new calendar which
has been strongly advocated by President
W. W. Campbell of the University of
California.
"I think the new arrangement com
mends itself for regularity of the months
and days of the week, which would al
ways be the same on every day of the
month. People of systematic thought,
those accustomed to thinking in definite
units, would very naturally favor it,"
Professor Willis said. "It is quite pos
sible that the more farseeing business
men would support it.
"But it will be necessary to show that
the calendar has real practical value in
order to educate the public to accept it,
and even so it will take a long time.
Conservatism is the leading factor which
tends to prevent the acceptance of such
changes. Conservatism is often stupidâ€”
it docs not readily recognize the advan
tages of the new."
Professor Willis compares the intro
duction of the thirteen-month calendar
to the introduction of the metric system.
"Although that system is infinitely more
practicable than the others, saving a
great deal of unnecessary calculations
and time, yet it has thus far been im
possible to introduce it into England and
the United States. The English cling to
the pound, shilling, and pence with as
tonishing conservatism. This plan for
a thirteen-month year is a simpler one
than our present calendar, but its advan
tages are too intangible to cause its
speedy introduction."
