# ROTH STRESSES NEED FOR MORE FACILITIES IN UNIVERSITY PRESS
## 
### 
"Overtaxed to the breaking point and
operating at a maximum capacity, the
University Press must be provided with
additional facilities," Comptroller A. E.
Roth said yesterday.
In 1920 the manufacturing business of
the University Press amounted to $67,-
000; while in 1928 it had practically
tripled, doing a year's business of $183,-
000. In 1926 the publications business
of the Press was $11,000; two years later
it turned out work valued at $45,000.
This information was disclosed by Roth
in discussing the need for additional op
erating space and facilities. During the
eight years of increased productivity
practically no additional facilities of any
importance have been made, Roth said.

"Overtaxed to the breaking point and
operating at a maximum capacity, the
University Press must be provided with
additional facilities," Comptroller A. E.
Roth said yesterday.
In 1920 the manufacturing business of
the University Press amounted to $67,-
000; while in 1928 it had practically
tripled, doing a year's business of $183,-
000. In 1926 the publications business
of the Press was $11,000; two years later
it turned out work valued at $45,000.
This information was disclosed by Roth
in discussing the need for additional op
erating space and facilities. During the
eight years of increased productivity
practically no additional facilities of any
importance have been made, Roth said.
