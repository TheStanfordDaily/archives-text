# GODDARD PREDICTS GREAT INCREASE OF MAIL, PASSENGER AIR TRAFFIC
## 
### 
"The time will come when "all mail and
passenger traffic going farther than fifty
miles will be carried by airplane." This
is the opinion of Lieutenant Norman A.
Goddard of the Palo Alto School of
Aviation. "But before this is possible,
there will have to be down-town airports
established in all large cities. These will
be located along the docks, on top of sky
scrapers, or over railroad yards."
Lieutenant Goddard continued: "It is
not generally known that insurance rates
for aviators are lower than rates for
railroad employees. This is a proof of
the safety of aviation, for certainly the
insurance companies will not invest in
needless risks.
"American aviation in general, includ
ing army and navy aviation, ranks sixth
among the world powers. But the United
States is the only country where com
mercial lines are established on a sound
commercial basis, and where investments
in air transport companies are paying
regular dividends.
"Of course rates of air transport com
panies are higher, but the public is al
ways willing to pay for speed. Double
fare trains between New York and Chi
cago, which save only about four hours'
time, are booked up ten days in advance,
so why should not the airplane, which
can cut nine to ten hours from this time,
become just as popular? Also, when vol
ume of business will allow a cut in rates,
they will be reduced."
Lieutenant Goddard is optimistic over
the strides private ownership of airplanes
is making. He expects to see commuters
living down the Peninsula who own their
own machines as soon as there is a land
ing field near the center of San Fran
cisco.
"At the present time, there are persons
who use airplanes much as the average
man uses his automobile," said Goddard.
"Take the case of the three Walker
brothers of Westwood. They learned to

fly at the school, and now they do all
their traveling by private airplane. Not
only that, they patrol over three hun
dred thousand acres of timber land by
airplane, a task that would be almost im
possible on foot."
Lieutenant Goddard first flew with the
British Navy in 1914. During the war,
he served as naval instructor. lie has j
seen the growth of civil aviation here as
well as in Europe, and predicts that in \
the next few years there will be still
more enormous advances in commercial [
flying.
French troops broke up a bandit
band in Africa, killing twenty-seven
of the bandits and recovering many
thousand head of cattle.
