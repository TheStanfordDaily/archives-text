# SPORTS OF 1929
## The 						Winged Foot Flyer 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
One of the most interesting and
amusing characters I have met in
track and field sports is "Weemie"
Baskin, greatest hurdler the South
ever produced, and now competing
under the colors of the New York
Athletic Club. Baskin is a big, rangy
fellow, with a world of speed and a
love for the game, and a delightful
Southern accent that never lets you
forget his "dear old Auburn" and
things below the line made famous
by Mason and Dixon.
Among "Weemie's" triumphs is a
National Collegiate championship,
won in 1927 at Soldiers' Field, Chi
cago, in 14 9-10 seconds, and a vic
tory over Ross Nichols at Travers
Island, New York, running his heat
in 14 4-5, just after Nichols had won
the Eastern Intercollegiate title. Nu
merous Southern marks are also to
his credit, and in his indoor efforts
his form has been just as impressive.
Baskin "went stale" at the time of
the 1928 Olympic tryouts, and failed
to qualify, running 15 1-5, to be shut
out in a preliminary heat. But he was
in good company—for Nichols; Kin

| sey, Olympic champion; Werner, na
tional champion; and Leistner, win
-1 | ner of the Far Western Olympic try
i 1 outs in 14 4-5, also failed to make the
; j team.
; | "Weemie," being of a roving dispo
! siti'on, decided to go to the games
. i anyway. Ariving in Amsterdam, he
I | proceeded to crash the Olympic sta
i j dium, without ticket, passport, or
I | identification card. Poised on top of
i 1 the fence a la "One-Eyed" Connolly,
| he was knighted in a rather unusual
' place by the sword of some trusty
gendarme. From there "Weemie" pro
' 1 ceeded to the stands, where he actu
i ally succeeded in entering the royal
i box and getting his handsome fiz into
the official photograph of the celebri
i ties therein.
A guy like that is bound to succeed.

j Friends of President-elect Hoover sent
the volunteer cabinet makers into a new
I frenzy of speculation today by predicting
t that the selections made for the agricul
? ture and commerce posts would furnish
- | real surprises for the country.
