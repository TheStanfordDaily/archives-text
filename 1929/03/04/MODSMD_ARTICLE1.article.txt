the eve of their introduction into of
fice the members of the Hoover Cabi
net gathered today around the hospit
able table of their chief to greet one
another and exchange pleasantries as
friends—the next gathering will be as
high officials of the nation.
President Coolidge's Cabinet mem
bers, on the other hand, were mostly
making preparations to vacate their
offices and leave Washington and de
voting much time to farewells and
packing. Last night they gathered for
the last time as dinner guests of Mr.
I'oolidge at the White House.
Henry L. Stimson, Mr. Hoover's
Sec retary of State, was the only mem
ber of his official family absent from
Washington. Although he has already

1e ft Manila,
where for over
a year lie has
been adminis
ter in g the

will not land
in San Fran
cisco until
March 20. All
> the other new

ready indicated that he will call them

Stimson
| Davis, the only two members of the
now Cabinet to serve in the old, were
, the veterans of today's gathering of
' the incoming Cabinet. Charles Fran
cis Adams, Arthur M. Hyde, and Rob
ert P. Lamont are newcomers to of
ficial life in Washington, while Ray
Lyman Wilbur has served here only
during the war as chief of the conser
| vation division of the Food Adminis
tration. Stimson's experience in ad
ministration office dates back as far
as 1011 as Secretary of War in the
] Taft administration.
A wide variety of future activities
j faced the retiring members of Mr.
Coolidge's Cabinet. Secretary Kellogg
I will remain in office as head of the
Foreign Department until his succes
sor can reach the Capitol, probably
about April 1.
To Waste No Time

time in going to work. Even Stimson,
although about eight thousand miles
from Washington tomorrow, already
will be engaged in further cementing
American relations with Japan at a
dinner to be tendered him by Baron
Tanaka, Japanese foreign minister, in
Tokyo at which he will be the guest
of honor.
William D. Mitchell, as solcitor gen
, eral for the last four years, is inti-
I mately acquainted with his immedi
| ate duties as the new Attorney Gen
eral. James W. Good of lowa, long a
member of Congress and for years
the chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, will be no stranger to the
| duties and requirements of the Secre
, tarv of War. Walter F. Brown's ser
! vice as Assistant Secretary of Com
merce has given him a full knowledge
of the functioning of the Federal Gov
ernment which will enable him to set
tle down immediately to his ruties
as Postmaster General.
Wilbur, Hyde, and Lamont are all
regarded as outstanding figures in
the fields which they will have to ad
minister as secretaries of the Interior,
Agriculture, and Commerce, respec
! tively. Adams' reputation as a lover
of the sea has assured him an en
thusiastic welcome in the Navy De
' partment.

tion of the San Francisco harbor con

WASHINGTON, March 3. (/P) —On
the eve of their introduction into of
fice the members of the Hoover Cabi
net gathered today around the hospit
able table of their chief to greet one
another and exchange pleasantries as
friends—the next gathering will be as
high officials of the nation.
President Coolidge's Cabinet mem
bers, on the other hand, were mostly
making preparations to vacate their
offices and leave Washington and de
voting much time to farewells and
packing. Last night they gathered for
the last time as dinner guests of Mr.
I'oolidge at the White House.
Henry L. Stimson, Mr. Hoover's
Sec retary of State, was the only mem
ber of his official family absent from
Washington. Although he has already

1e ft Manila,
where for over
a year lie has
been adminis
ter in g the
Philippines, he
will not land
in San Fran
cisco until
March 20. All
> the other new
Cabinet ap
pointees were
on hand today
and will par-

ticipate in tomorrow's ceremonies.
Their names will be passed on by the
Senate in special session tomorrow for
ratification and Mr. Hoover has al
ready indicated that he will call them
for his first Cabinet meeting on Tues
day. The oaths of office probably will
be administered on Tuesday morning
before the Cabinet meeting.


Stimson
| Davis, the only two members of the
now Cabinet to serve in the old, were
, the veterans of today's gathering of
' the incoming Cabinet. Charles Fran
cis Adams, Arthur M. Hyde, and Rob
ert P. Lamont are newcomers to of
ficial life in Washington, while Ray
Lyman Wilbur has served here only
during the war as chief of the conser
| vation division of the Food Adminis
tration. Stimson's experience in ad
ministration office dates back as far
as 1011 as Secretary of War in the
] Taft administration.
A wide variety of future activities
j faced the retiring members of Mr.
Coolidge's Cabinet. Secretary Kellogg
I will remain in office as head of the
Foreign Department until his succes
sor can reach the Capitol, probably
about April 1.
To Waste No Time
The new Cabinet will waste no
time in going to work. Even Stimson,
although about eight thousand miles
from Washington tomorrow, already
will be engaged in further cementing
American relations with Japan at a
dinner to be tendered him by Baron
Tanaka, Japanese foreign minister, in
Tokyo at which he will be the guest
of honor.
William D. Mitchell, as solcitor gen
, eral for the last four years, is inti-
I mately acquainted with his immedi
| ate duties as the new Attorney Gen
eral. James W. Good of lowa, long a
member of Congress and for years
the chairman of the Appropriations
Committee, will be no stranger to the
| duties and requirements of the Secre
, tarv of War. Walter F. Brown's ser
! vice as Assistant Secretary of Com
