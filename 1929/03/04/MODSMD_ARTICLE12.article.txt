i gram of Stanford music by the band,
'the University choir, and the organ
1 will come to him over the same
1 nation-wide hook-up.
The luncheon program, arrange
. j ments for which were announced yes
, | tcrday by the National Broadcasting
. I Company, will go on the air at 11:30
o'clock this morning, shortly after
; ' Hoover's inaguration. It will be broad-
J cast over the National Broadcasting
[ Company's chain of 70 stations. A
! special radio arrangement in the
, White House will make it possible
, for the new president to hear this
program from his home town.
( The N.B.C. has also secured George

' speak during the morning.
Stanford students seated in the As
f sembly Hall will hear the band, organ,
j and choir numbers after the music
, has traveled to New York and back
, over the radio; they will also hear
1 the music directly, and if scientific
5 calculations are correct, the notes
