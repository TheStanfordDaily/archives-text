# Herbert Clark Hoover, President of the United States
## 
### 
The inauguration of Herbert Hoover to the Presidency of the
United States.
Those are words that will print themselves indelibly on the pages of
history. Those are words that announce the beginning of a new political
regime. Some hail the coming four years as golden years of great
promise; others look to them as drab, unfruitful years that promise
little, None can prophecy accurately. The years will bear testimony
themselves.
America is a gigantic beast that has just awakened to its power.
Standing pre-eminent in the world, its position is a perilous one. It is
young, over-confident, and possessed of the reckless striving for the
thousand material things that wealth and power offer. Like the ado
lescent who grows suddenly to great physical strength, the United States
has progressed and expanded and grown so rapidly that it has had no
time to find itself. Such is the nation that Herbert Hoover must guide.
Such is the unruly giant he must govern.
Terrific problems face the new President. International affairs need
serious attention. International trade, world peace, international debts,
these intimate some of the matters he must attend. Then the multitude
of national problems: law enforcement, crime, poverty, farm relief,
power legislation, tariff, finance, armaments, no end of social and
political adjustments. It is a complex future that opens to Herbert
Hoover these coming four years.
Stanford looks back fondly to the days when Hoover was one of us.
Now he is of the nation and of the world. The world is a harsh critic
of its leaders. It demands the utmost. No statesman ever held a
greater responsibility, a more tremendous task, than does Herbert
Hoover. And the world will judge coolly, rationally, how well he
fulfills this responsibity and how well he accomplishes his task.
In the days to come, there will be those who stand by to praise the
slightest move of the President. There will be thoes to censure his
slightest move of the President. There will be those to censure his
this Hoover, this man of little beginnings and great capacities, will do.
They will not hail him great until he proves himself great, nor will they
censure him until he merits censure. In fairness they will wait and judge
honestly.
This, then, will be the attitude of the world. This should be the
attitude of Stanford, for Stanford will be here when Hoover is sunk
deep in history. Just pride is Stanford's and just is its acclaim of its
most illustrious son. But its pride should not overshadow its ability to
judge and to evaluate.
Stanford, the parent of Hoover's college days, the place dear to him
as it is dear to every Stanford man, joins the nation in wishing him the
greatest possible measure of success in his years in the presidency. An
unbounded opportunity has been given Hoover to serve the nation and
the world. Stanford believes he will make the most of it. Stanford pays
homage to its highly esteemed alumnus, on this the day of his inaugura
tion to the highest office in the nation.

slightest move of the President. There will be those to censure his
this Hoover, this man of little beginnings and great capacities, will do.
They will not hail him great until he proves himself great, nor will they
censure him until he merits censure. In fairness they will wait and judge
honestly.
This, then, will be the attitude of the world. This should be the
attitude of Stanford, for Stanford will be here when Hoover is sunk
deep in history. Just pride is Stanford's and just is its acclaim of its
most illustrious son. But its pride should not overshadow its ability to
judge and to evaluate.
Stanford, the parent of Hoover's college days, the place dear to him
as it is dear to every Stanford man, joins the nation in wishing him the
greatest possible measure of success in his years in the presidency. An
unbounded opportunity has been given Hoover to serve the nation and
the world. Stanford believes he will make the most of it. Stanford pays
homage to its highly esteemed alumnus, on this the day of his inaugura
tion to the highest office in the nation.
The inauguration of Herbert Hoover to the Presidency of the
United States.
Those are words that will print themselves indelibly on the pages of
history. Those are words that announce the beginning of a new political
regime. Some hail the coming four years as golden years of great
promise; others look to them as drab, unfruitful years that promise
little, None can prophecy accurately. The years will bear testimony
themselves.
America is a gigantic beast that has just awakened to its power.
Standing pre-eminent in the world, its position is a perilous one. It is
young, over-confident, and possessed of the reckless striving for the
thousand material things that wealth and power offer. Like the ado
lescent who grows suddenly to great physical strength, the United States
has progressed and expanded and grown so rapidly that it has had no
time to find itself. Such is the nation that Herbert Hoover must guide.
Such is the unruly giant he must govern.
Terrific problems face the new President. International affairs need
serious attention. International trade, world peace, international debts,
these intimate some of the matters he must attend. Then the multitude
of national problems: law enforcement, crime, poverty, farm relief,
power legislation, tariff, finance, armaments, no end of social and
political adjustments. It is a complex future that opens to Herbert
Hoover these coming four years.
Stanford looks back fondly to the days when Hoover was one of us.
Now he is of the nation and of the world. The world is a harsh critic
of its leaders. It demands the utmost. No statesman ever held a
greater responsibility, a more tremendous task, than does Herbert
Hoover. And the world will judge coolly, rationally, how well he
fulfills this responsibity and how well he accomplishes his task.
In the days to come, there will be those who stand by to praise the
slightest move of the President. There will be thoes to censure his
slightest move of the President. There will be those to censure his
this Hoover, this man of little beginnings and great capacities, will do.
They will not hail him great until he proves himself great, nor will they
censure him until he merits censure. In fairness they will wait and judge
