# Air-Minded Peter Pans

For the amusement of future Stanford play-goers it is suggested
that an extra sheet he inserted in each program so marked as to make
the construction of paper airplanes quite simple and quite easy. Having
made one from the inserted page the program could be torn in liaff and
two more could be made, thus tripling the delight of the child-minds
who are unable to enjoy the play.
The airplane meet at the "Wild Duck" was simply splendid. More
bald-headed men were struck and no end of fussy old ladies. Stanford
has certainly much to be proud of in these stalwart Peter Pans who not
only just send goose-pimples of joy up their own spines with their
delightful little pranks, but keep the entire audience in gales of laughter.
Even the actors thrill to the merriment. Especially in keeping with
such light farces as this Ibsen play are the airplane antics. The thing is
becoming a noble institution, even invading the church. At the organ
lecital some Joe College made the event memorable by launching an
airplane during the concert.
Here's to the day when plays and concerts and lectures are abolished
for paper airplane meets. It might be possible to line the Row up on
one side and the Halls 011 the other, thus keeping up that splendid spirit
of rivalry between these two time-honored parties and also adding to the
delight of the event by making it a contest.
We hang over our typewriter, shedding a tear of exultation for these
ineffable Peter Pans, these never-to-be lost Joe Colleges, these prime
Joe Doaks who make such capital asses of themselves.
