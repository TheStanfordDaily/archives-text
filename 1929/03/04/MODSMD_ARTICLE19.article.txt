A LEASE EXPIRES

Mrs. Calvin Coolidge, who, since
2:47 a.m., August 3, 1923, has done
her smiling best to make the White
House what a White House should
be, retires today from the Presidency
and turns her big home on Pennsyl
vania Avenue over to new tenants.
Mrs. Coolidge's smile was the most
outstanding achievement of the re
tiring Administration, an Administra
tion which otherwise was about as
interesting and soul-satisfying as a
glass of day-before-yesterday's near
beer.
Next to her smile came, as the sec
ond biggest achievement, Coolidge
Economy, and that was invented by
Benjamin Franklin some time ago.
The Presidential shoes flopped
about considerably on the Coolidge
l'eet. Mr. Hoover, however, will fit
them. In fact, they may pinch him a
bit; and if so, it is hoped that he will
get new shoes, take more power into
his own capable hands and, big
enough to forget re-election politics
for a time, tell folks exactly what he
wants and does not want.
A man like Hoover, though he might
kill himself politically, could do more
for this country in four years than
his predecessor could do, if twins, in
half a century.
Not for a long time has any man
gone into the White House with so
many people backing him to be a
winner. Two factions elected Herbert

Hoover. One was smug stupidity; but
the other, far the larger, was com
posed of people who believed him to
be a big man, and who expect him to
demonstrate himself as such.
First, we pray to heaven that Presi
dent Hoover will be interesting—an
executive like Teddy Roosevelt, who
made mistakes, but who, right or
wrong, was a President.
We hope that he will do much to
ward convincing Congress that it is
only a sideshow of American govern
ment, and toward centralizing power
in that oligarchy of powerful and
benevolent men, of the Mellon type,
who can govern this country as it
should be governed.
We hope that he will take steps
toward breaking the lousy super
government now enjoyed by the un-
American Anti-Saloon League, which
apparently cheated "Wild Bill" Dono
van, the man who Hooverized New
York, out of his reward as Attorney
General.
We hope that he will squelch the
new spirit of yellow-press militarism
which has been developing, without
interference, under the Coolidge nose.
Herbert Hoover today takes over a
big job, in a big country, faced by big
problems. He has wider opportunity
of becoming a great man of history
than any other has had for decades,
and we have considerable faith that
he will convert that opportunity into
actuality. —Winston Norman.
