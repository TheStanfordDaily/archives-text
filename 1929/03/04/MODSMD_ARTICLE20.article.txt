Problems of Newspaper Publishing, i
By Buford O. Brown. (New York: j
Harper & Brothers. 1929.)
When we pick up a newspaper,
most of us are aware of its news con
tents and its editorial material. But
few ever realize the complex business j
problems entailed in running a suc
cessful paper. Journalism may be
verging on being a profession, but it
is a profession which must always go
hand in hand with the business side i
of publishing.
And it is the involved business
problems of a paper that are handled
at fine length in this new book by j
Professor Buford O. Brown, acting i
head of the Journalism division here.
"Problems of Newspaper Publish
ing" deals more specifically with
newspapers in the country field, both j
daily and weekly. The author has had
wide and varied experience in this
work which he has combined with the
reliective attributes of several years
of teaching.
The book is not only invaluable as
a textbook on business problems of |
the newspaper, but it is a thorough
desk-manual for anyone striving to
conduct a newspaper business sue- j
cessfully. There are helpful appendi- j
ces as well as a complete index in the j
book. I
In a readable style, rich with quo-!
tations, Professor Brown takes up, j
among other problems, those of lo- ;
cation of the paper, financing, equip
ment, income, advertising, circulation, i
laws affecting advertising, libel, and !
contempt.
H. F. Harrington, of the Medill
School of Journalism at Northwest- ;
ern, says of this book: "The plan of i
the book will be found logical and
stimulating, and the discussions at
all times based on veritable facts and I
scientific principles developed in
many different localities and on var- '
ious sorts of newspapers."

Gotobedde Lane. By Marian Bower.
(Indianapolis: The Bobbs - Merrill
Company.) $2.50.
Here is a novel of true quality. It
follows the modern trend of chron
icling the lives and accidents of plain
people. But "Gotobedde Lane" invests
these people with a little more dig
nity and sincerity than is customary.
Its diction fits in an essential sense;
the characters are true to themselves
and their East Anglian environment. |
In her delineation of them, Miss Bow- !
er has finely drawn some, pictured '
others with sweeping strokes. The j
novel is replete with contrast, and j
shows throughout the work of a mas- j
tcr hand. •

Our Neighbor Nicaragua. By Floyd
Cramer. (New York: Frederick A. '
Stokes.) $2.50.
The dedication of this book is "To
the men of the United States Marine
Corps who gave their lives on Nica-1
ragunn soil in a attempt to bring
peace to a troubled land." The book 1
throughout seems to be an attempt— j
but rather a vain attempt—to exoner
ate the United Sates for its interven
tion in Nicaragua.
The author's method of doing this
Us to prove the incompetence of the !
Nicaraguans to govern themselves,
which he attempts to do by giving a
most unsympathetic picture of them.
The hook is not particularly inter
esting on account of the somewhat
drab style the author uses. Since he j

lias been for many years in Nicara
gua, he might have given a more col
orful and entertaining picture of the
country as it is today.
It is of value chiefly for its outline
of Nicaraguan history prior to the
time the United States interfered
there. After that the author is too
busy explaining and defending vari
ous actions.
The most interesting part of the
book is the account of the daring
Walker filibuster in 1855, when an
American adventurer had himself
elected president of the country.
