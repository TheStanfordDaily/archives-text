# FROSH TRACK SQUAD SHOWS STRENGTH BY DEFEATING ALL-STARS
## Stanford Takes All Places in Century Dash, 440, and Discus Events 
### 
Stanford's freshman track team
j showed unexpected power Saturday in
i defeating the Southern California All
l Stars 67-55 in the first meet of the
year. Taking eight out of fourteen
first places, the yearlings showed pos
| nihilities of developing into a strong
team despite the apparent lack of ma
j terial.
Elwood, of Stanford, and LeFevre,
; of the All-Stars, were the outstanding J
! men of the day. Elwood won both the
dashes In fast time for early season,
j LeFevre, winner of third place in the
Southern California Olympic decatlia
lon tryouts, won first in the javelin,
i and broad jump, and third in the high j
hurdles.
In three events, the 100, 440, and
discus, Stanford made a clean sweep
, of the places. The All-Stars won clean
j sweeps in the high jump and high hur
! dies. Johns of the freshmen showed
1 excellent early-season form by tieing
j for first in the pole vault at 12 feet
! 5 inches.
The results of the mile run clearly
i showed the weakness of the babes in
I the distance events. The one All-Star
entrant won with the poor time of 4
minutes 55 seconds. The nearest fresh
man to finish was 20 yards behind. In
the 880 Cooper threw a shoe at the
start and was forced to finish the 1
race with one bare foot. He ran a nice j
race to take second.
The freshmen showed power in the
, 440 when the three men came in al
j most in a dead heat with the good
time of 51 2-5 seconds. In the half
mile relay the freshmen won by thirty j
I yards.
