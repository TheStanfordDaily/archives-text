# DAVID STARR JORDAN PRAISES HOOVER AS NEW U.S. PRESIDENT
## Wise And Carefully Thought Out Moves To Feature His Administration 
### Jessie Fleming 
"Every move in President Hoover's
administration will be wise and care
fully thought out," Dr. David Starr
Jordan, president emeritus, said in a
recent interview. "There is not a
streak of selfishness or recklessness
in Hoover. He is not partisan and he
would not do anything crooked to
save any party from defeat. Hoover
is like Lincoln in that he never en
ters any situation without clear rec
ognition and estimation of all its dif
ficulties. He is a man who will know
the difference between the men under
him who are progressive and those
who are progressive in their own in
terests."
"I told them in 1921," said Dr. Jor
dan, "that Hoover would not spend a
penny or turn his hand over to he
nominated and he didn't at that time.
In 1928 the Republican party had to
nominate him because they were not
sure of the possible election of any
one else."

"The next four years will be peace
ful except for bloodless battles with
liquor men in which plenty of coin
will fly," replied Dr. Jordan when he
was asked for his opinion. "There
will be no difficulty with Latin Amer
ica and the inaugural trip was a good
move as everything else in Hoover's
administration will be. That trip was
less bloody than those to which Hoo
ver has been accustomed—the only
bombs in Latin America were paper."
"I frequently stayed at Hoover's
home in Europe during the war," con
tinued Dr. Jordan, "and I learned
more about the nations of Europe
from Hoover than from any other
inun. He was personally acquainted
with the situation in each country.
The other man who taught me most
about foreign affairs was James D.
Bourchier, who, like Hoover, could
keep silent in seven languages."
"Somebody wrote me recently that
I had told him about thirty years ago
that Herbert Hoover was just the
kind of a man for president," Dr. Jor
dan replied to a question regarding
his recognition of Hoover as presi
dential material. He remarked fur
ther, however, that he, himself, did
not remember having made such a
statement so early as that.
When Dr. Jordan was asked about
the probability of stricter enforce
ment of prohibition during the next
administration he answered that no
one man could enforce anything —so-
called enforcement was a compromise
between the forces of morality in a
country. "The eighteenth amend
ment can never be reversed," de
clared Dr. Jordan, "however, the Vol
stead act does need change —I believe
that I could make a better one my
self," he finished, hall'-seriously.

would not do anything crooked to
save any party from defeat. Hoover
is like Lincoln in that he never en
ters any situation without clear rec
ognition and estimation of all its dif
ficulties. He is a man who will know
the difference between the men under
him who are progressive and those
who are progressive in their own in
terests."
"I told them in 1921," said Dr. Jor
dan, "that Hoover would not spend a
penny or turn his hand over to he
nominated and he didn't at that time.
In 1928 the Republican party had to
nominate him because they were not
sure of the possible election of any
one else."

"The next four years will be peace
ful except for bloodless battles with
liquor men in which plenty of coin
will fly," replied Dr. Jordan when he
was asked for his opinion. "There
will be no difficulty with Latin Amer
ica and the inaugural trip was a good
move as everything else in Hoover's
administration will be. That trip was
less bloody than those to which Hoo
ver has been accustomed—the only
bombs in Latin America were paper."
"I frequently stayed at Hoover's
home in Europe during the war," con
tinued Dr. Jordan, "and I learned
more about the nations of Europe
from Hoover than from any other
inun. He was personally acquainted
with the situation in each country.
The other man who taught me most
about foreign affairs was James D.
Bourchier, who, like Hoover, could
keep silent in seven languages."
"Somebody wrote me recently that
I had told him about thirty years ago
that Herbert Hoover was just the
kind of a man for president," Dr. Jor
dan replied to a question regarding
his recognition of Hoover as presi
dential material. He remarked fur
ther, however, that he, himself, did
not remember having made such a
statement so early as that.
When Dr. Jordan was asked about
the probability of stricter enforce
ment of prohibition during the next
administration he answered that no
one man could enforce anything —so-
called enforcement was a compromise
between the forces of morality in a
country. "The eighteenth amend
ment can never be reversed," de
clared Dr. Jordan, "however, the Vol
stead act does need change —I believe
that I could make a better one my
self," he finished, hall'-seriously.
"Every move in President Hoover's
administration will be wise and care
fully thought out," Dr. David Starr
Jordan, president emeritus, said in a
recent interview. "There is not a
streak of selfishness or recklessness
in Hoover. He is not partisan and he
would not do anything crooked to
save any party from defeat. Hoover
is like Lincoln in that he never en
