# HOOVER'S FORESIGHT PROVIDES STANFORD WITH WAR LIBRARY
## University's Collection of Data on Great War Is Finest in World 
### 
Evolving from a mere fanciful idea
in the early part of the Great War
and later developed by the prescient
mind of a great leader, the Hoover
War Library of Stanford University
has grown by leaps and bounds until
it is today the largest and best
equipped library on the subject of the
Great War in the world.
The Hoover War Library is essen
tially a research library. It was
founded in 1019 by Herbert Hoover
to gather and preserve materials nec
essary for the study of the causes,
the conduct, and the results of the
World War. Since that time the
scope of the Library has been en
larged to include the period of recon
struction following the war.
Hoover Looks Ahead
Hoover's intensive foresight has
made all this possible. Out of all the
men present at the Peace Conference
after the war, he was the one to com
prehend the real value of such a col
lection. From 1914 the thought of a
historical collection, related to the
World War, for Stanford University
had been in Hoover's mind, but the
first intimation of a larger plan came
in the form of a cable from Paris, in
1919, to Mrs. Hoover instructing her
to inform President Wilbur that $50,-
000 was available for a historical col
lection of the Great War. The money
was a personal gift from Herbert Hoo
ver, and the sum has been greatly in
creased since then by the generous
donor.
The first concrete step toward
founding the Library was taken in the
same year, when Professor E. D. Ad

a ins was sent over to Europe. Ar
chives of Belgian relief constituted
the first item of importance, but the
collection quickly expanded to in
clude political, economic, historical,
and social works in many different
languages on the war and the period
cl reconstruction.
Need New Building
Over 150,000 different works are
now included in the collection, the
use of which is open to graduate re
search students and faculties of all
universities, and other investigators
approved by the Library directors.
The materials in the Library include
government documents of every coun
try in the world, belligerent and neu
tral, files of newspapers and periodi
cals, records of national and inter
national war agencies, books and
pamphlets, personal memorabilia and
manuscripts of men and women who
were active in world affairs, and nu
merous special collections.
Although the Library is housed in
the Stanford University Library, it
has its own reading room, its special
staff, and a separate stack floor. But
the collection is becoming too large
for its allotted space and the stack
floor is filled to overflowing. Soma
day the Hoover War Library will
have a building of its own on a pro
posed site just north of the Art Gal
lery.
