living in Canada. He served for eight
years in the municipal council of Mon
treal. For seventeen years he was a
representative in the Canadian House
of Commons. During the war Sir Her

the Canadian Patriotic fund which
provided for the wives and depend
ents of Canadian soldiers. Shortly af
ter the conclusion of peace he ac

sound financial condition of the league
is largely due to his skill as an ad
ministrator.
