# CARDS SWAMP V. C. MERMEN; RECORDS FALL
## Burns, Driggs, Harrison Set New Coast Records in One-Sided Contest 
### Reid Briggs 
The Golden Bear went home pretty
well water-logged Saturday night,
after being swamped in both varsity
and frosh swimming meets in Encina
pool. The California teams failed to
capture any first places, losing 42-16
to the Stanford varsity, and 49-11 to
the frosh.
The outstanding performance of the
clay was Whitey Burns' lowering of
his own Pacific Coast intercollegiate
record in the 100-yard varsity breast
stroke race. His time of 1:12.4 shat
ters his previous record of 1:13 made
in the Northwestern meet. The new
record is a very fast time for a 100-
foot pool.
In the next varsity event, Reggie
Harrison seemed to catch the spirit
for he, too, clipped his own coast in
tercollegiate record in the 50-yartl
sprint. He made the distance in 23.4
seconds.
Captain Ogden Driggs' time in the
100-yard backstroke equals the pres
ent Coast Conference time of 1:08.
Barret Brown in the 220-yard free
stye came within a second of the
present Pacific Coast intercollegiatu
record, but with lack of competition
failed to set a new time.
Not to be outdone by the varsity
swimmers, the Cardinal yearlings
broke two Coast Conference fresh
man records in a decisive manner.
Austin Clapp's 220-yard free style
time of 2:24 is far below the former
record of 2:33.4, and betters the time
made in the varsity event Saturday.
The freshman 800-foot relay team
took nearly ten seconds off the rec
ord. moving it from 2:46 to 2:37.4.

The Golden Bear went home pretty
well water-logged Saturday night,
after being swamped in both varsity
and frosh swimming meets in Encina
pool. The California teams failed to
capture any first places, losing 42-16
to the Stanford varsity, and 49-11 to
the frosh.
The outstanding performance of the
clay was Whitey Burns' lowering of
his own Pacific Coast intercollegiate
record in the 100-yard varsity breast
stroke race. His time of 1:12.4 shat
ters his previous record of 1:13 made
in the Northwestern meet. The new
record is a very fast time for a 100-
foot pool.
In the next varsity event, Reggie
Harrison seemed to catch the spirit
for he, too, clipped his own coast in
tercollegiate record in the 50-yartl
sprint. He made the distance in 23.4
seconds.
Captain Ogden Driggs' time in the
100-yard backstroke equals the pres
ent Coast Conference time of 1:08.
Barret Brown in the 220-yard free
stye came within a second of the
present Pacific Coast intercollegiatu
record, but with lack of competition
failed to set a new time.
Not to be outdone by the varsity
swimmers, the Cardinal yearlings
broke two Coast Conference fresh
man records in a decisive manner.
Austin Clapp's 220-yard free style
time of 2:24 is far below the former
record of 2:33.4, and betters the time
made in the varsity event Saturday.
The freshman 800-foot relay team
took nearly ten seconds off the rec
ord. moving it from 2:46 to 2:37.4.

Time, 3:36.8.
Final score: Stanford frosh, 56;
California frosh, 11.
The Golden Bear went home pretty
well water-logged Saturday night,
after being swamped in both varsity
and frosh swimming meets in Encina
pool. The California teams failed to
capture any first places, losing 42-16
to the Stanford varsity, and 49-11 to
the frosh.
The outstanding performance of the
clay was Whitey Burns' lowering of
his own Pacific Coast intercollegiate
record in the 100-yard varsity breast
stroke race. His time of 1:12.4 shat
ters his previous record of 1:13 made
in the Northwestern meet. The new
record is a very fast time for a 100-
foot pool.
In the next varsity event, Reggie
Harrison seemed to catch the spirit
for he, too, clipped his own coast in
tercollegiate record in the 50-yartl
sprint. He made the distance in 23.4
seconds.
Captain Ogden Driggs' time in the
100-yard backstroke equals the pres
ent Coast Conference time of 1:08.
Barret Brown in the 220-yard free
stye came within a second of the
present Pacific Coast intercollegiatu
record, but with lack of competition
failed to set a new time.
Not to be outdone by the varsity
swimmers, the Cardinal yearlings
broke two Coast Conference fresh
man records in a decisive manner.
Austin Clapp's 220-yard free style
time of 2:24 is far below the former
record of 2:33.4, and betters the time
made in the varsity event Saturday.
The freshman 800-foot relay team
took nearly ten seconds off the rec
ord. moving it from 2:46 to 2:37.4.
