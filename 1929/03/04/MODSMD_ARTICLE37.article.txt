## 
### 
Coach Dink Templeton's track and
field men were not exerting tliem
serves Friday in their regular prac
tice meet, the last before the Cards'
encounter with the Olympic Club next
Saturday in the Stadium; but some
noteworthy performances were made
notwithstanding.
Mario Perelli-Minetti, sophomore
javelin thrower, hurled the spear 190
ft. Vz in., a remarkable early-season
distance and Perelli-Minetti's best per
formance. As a freshman last year he
began the season with tosses of about
150 ft. and by the time of the Little
Rig Meet was throwing the javelin
175 ft. His progress this year has been
rapid.
Alex McKinnon finished strong in
the mile; and, although his time of
4:37:1 was slow, he looked like the
McKinnon of two years ago who con
sistently ran the four-lap event in
4:25 or better.
Templeton's sprinters were evenly
matched Friday, Lauritzen, Dyer, and
McDermott finishing within a pace of
each other in (wo heats of the hun
dred. The time in each heat was
:10 1-5.
Johnny Morrison had to do some
real running to finish first in the
quarter-mile, Shove and Syer forcing
him to use the outside rim of the
track most of the way around. His
time was :50 3-5.
Captain Ross Nichols, 1.C.4-A. hur
dling champion, topped the high sticks
in :15 1-5, Edmonds and Smith taking
second and third.
Neikirk, with a fast final sprint,
surprised everyone to nose out French
and Gooden and win the 80-yard run
in the creditable time of 2:01 3-5.
Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert. tied
for first in the shot with heaves of
46 ft. Li/4 in.
