# RAKLETS WINS GOLF TITLE
## 
### 
RELLEAIR, Fla., March 3. (/P)—
Tom Ilaklets, 23-year-old professional
of Yoiingstown, Ohio, won the Florida
West Coast golf championship here
loday with a brilliant 278 for the 72
holes which was (wo under par and
three ahead of his nearest competitor.

finished Joan's first starring picture— |
"Our Modern Maidens." It is another i
dancing daughter affair, but is epoch- 1
al for them because Douglas is pies- '
ent in the cast as leading man.
"Douglas' passion is sleep," Joan
discloses. "He sits on the set with a j
book open in his hands and goes
j sound asleep. Someday someone's j
i going to set a bomb under him." !
Whereupon Douglas gallantly rallies !
back with "I could lie down right in
i the middle of this dining-room and
. sleep perfectly. And as for the bomb
| —well, someone did light some fire
; crackers under my chair on the set
J once!"
Joan had a shopping list on which i
j "monkey" was written in red. "The |
; silly boy bought a monkey!" she ex-!
plains. "But it eats so little!" he says '
with enthusiasm. "I'd let it starve to !
'death!" retorts Joan, who can see no
| earthly good in a pet monkey.
j Both of them are terribly serious
I young people at heart, but they love ;
| to keep up a spirited byplay of lion- ;
i sense. Joan looks and acts much '
J younger off-screen, and Douglas is
surprisingly mature.
She is frank and decided in her
opinions. He is perhaps a little shy,
; but none the less straightforward.
| Neither are they the least bit con-
I ceited. Her stellar promotion thrills
j him cuch more than it does her.
Riegals' run—the wrong way—was
[the most exciting tiling Joan has ever
i seen. Despite her sophistication, she
i 3 highly emotional. She wept when
the California man made his faux pas,
and she cries at sad movies—while
Douglas sleeps. "But your laugh
wakes me up!" he assures her.
Joan has had a hard fight for sue- !
cess and the faithful, quiet adoration
of Douglas is bringing her happiness
at last.
Young Fairbanks is a free-lance
featured player at present, but his
| chances for stardom are excellent. As
j Joan would say herself, "He's a good
I egg!"
