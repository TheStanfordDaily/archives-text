# STANFORD DROPS 3-2 BALL GAME TO BRONC SQUAD BY ODD PLAY
## Winning Hit Bounces Over Fence; Double Changed To Four-Bag Run 
### 
I
Splendid pitching by Simoni en- j
abled the Santa Clara baseball team
to defeat the Cardinal nine here Satur
day afternoon by a score of 3 to 2.
Simoni held the Stanford hitters to
three same bingles and fanned eleven,
as well as contributing two safe hits
to the Bronco victory.
Santa Clara made its winning run .
on a very peculiar play. Owens, Bronc j
first-baseman, hit a screeching liner j
to left field. Hunken made a beautiful ;
try for the ball and it bounced off his
glove over the fence. What should
have been a double was suddenly con
verted into a home run, and the win
ning marker.
Tho Broncs scored two runs in the I
fifth inning, one of them by smart
baseball. A walk and two singles
scored one run, and left Simoni on
third and Morey on first. Morey ran
half way to second and teased Kern
into throwing the ball to the second
baseman. As soon as the ball was
snapped, Simoni darted for home and
| made it. It was merely a case of a
i sleeping Stanford ball team. The win
ning run scored on Owens' fluke
homer.
While the Broncs were defeating
the Cards, the St. Mary's nine
trounced the University of California
team by a 9 to 6 score. This leaves
the Bears in the cellar position of j
the California Intercollegiate Baseball ;
Association, as they have not yet won !
a contest.
