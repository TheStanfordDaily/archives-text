# Ibsen Drama Well Received Friday; Helen Sterling's Acting Outstanding
## Kathleen Fitz Is Successful in Difficult Juvenile Role; Mauser, Henry, Owens Characterizations Good 
### John Rogers 
Most people go to an Ibsen produc
tion largely through a sense of duty.
That may have brought an almost ca
pacity house to the Assembly Hall j
Friday night for "The Wild Duck," j
but, if the audience did come because
of a sense of duty, it found, surpris- ;
j inglv, an excellent performance, rank- |
] ing with the foremost campus produc- j
jtions. While, taken as a whole, the |
I English Club play was not as finished ]
| as "What Every Woman Knows," still,
! when the difficulties which beset any
' Ibsen drama are considered, in many
respects it was better done — even
though the audience did all it could
to turn the tragedy into a comedy.
If any individual performance stood j
above the others, it was that of Helen
i Sterling, as Gina, the suppressed, ig- j
i norant wife. Her professional experi- 1
ence showed in the smoothness of her
work, and, playing most of her part j
in a repressed manner, her emotional j
scenes were sharply contrasted. Above j
all the rest, her characterization was |
the most sustained.
Showing an amazing transition i
frcm her usual type of comedy and
musical roles, Kathleen Fitz's inter
pretation of Hedvig will be rernem
| bered long after her other perform- j
, ances are forgotten. Although she had j
this tradition of comedy parts to over-1

| come, and while she did not much
resemble a fourteen-y old girl, her
playing of the child <?st a diffi
cult role to make con v.. ng consid
ering the unnaturalness of the lines
j —was an extremely good piece of act
ing.
Mauser Is Notable
Although he had a part which
! might be classed almost as a minor
! one, George Mauser, who played Rel
] ling, the doctor whose philosophy was
: the antithesis of the idealist's, ran
away with the scenes in which he
appeared. In contrast to the others,
his interpretation was positive and
1 forceful, and he was particularly con
-1 vincing in those scenes in which he
j was supposed to be under the influ
-1 ence of liquor. The applause on his
j first exit was well earned.
Tom Henry, in a role which was
• easily the most difficult that any stu-
I dent has attempted in years, for the
j most part gave a convincing per
j fonnance as Hjalmar, the hypocriti
! cal, selfish father, although at times
i his acting lagged and some of his cli
i maxes were not carried to their full
! extent. He may have been thrown
! off, in part, by the tendency of the
audience to laugh at everything he
| said.
