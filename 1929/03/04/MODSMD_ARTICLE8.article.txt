# Ibsen Drama Well Received Friday; Helen Sterling's Acting Outstanding
## Kathleen Fitz Is Successful in Difficult Juvenile Role; Mauser, Henry, Owens Characterizations Good 
### John Rogers 
Most people go to an Ibsen produc
tion largely through a sense of duty.
That may have brought an almost ca
pacity house to the Assembly Hall j
Friday night for "The Wild Duck," j
but, if the audience did come because
of a sense of duty, it found, surpris- ;
j inglv, an excellent performance, rank- |
] ing with the foremost campus produc- j
jtions. While, taken as a whole, the |
I English Club play was not as finished ]
| as "What Every Woman Knows," still,
! when the difficulties which beset any
' Ibsen drama are considered, in many
respects it was better done — even
though the audience did all it could
to turn the tragedy into a comedy.
If any individual performance stood j
above the others, it was that of Helen
i Sterling, as Gina, the suppressed, ig- j
i norant wife. Her professional experi- 1
ence showed in the smoothness of her
work, and, playing most of her part j
in a repressed manner, her emotional j
scenes were sharply contrasted. Above j
all the rest, her characterization was |
the most sustained.
Showing an amazing transition i
frcm her usual type of comedy and
musical roles, Kathleen Fitz's inter
pretation of Hedvig will be rernem
| bered long after her other perform- j
, ances are forgotten. Although she had j
this tradition of comedy parts to over-1

| come, and while she did not much
resemble a fourteen-y old girl, her
playing of the child <?st a diffi
cult role to make con v.. ng consid
ering the unnaturalness of the lines
j —was an extremely good piece of act
ing.
Mauser Is Notable
Although he had a part which
! might be classed almost as a minor
! one, George Mauser, who played Rel
] ling, the doctor whose philosophy was
: the antithesis of the idealist's, ran
away with the scenes in which he
appeared. In contrast to the others,
his interpretation was positive and
1 forceful, and he was particularly con
-1 vincing in those scenes in which he
j was supposed to be under the influ
-1 ence of liquor. The applause on his
j first exit was well earned.
Tom Henry, in a role which was
• easily the most difficult that any stu-
I dent has attempted in years, for the
j most part gave a convincing per
j fonnance as Hjalmar, the hypocriti
! cal, selfish father, although at times
i his acting lagged and some of his cli
i maxes were not carried to their full
! extent. He may have been thrown
! off, in part, by the tendency of the
audience to laugh at everything he
| said.
i Jeanette Owens, while playing a
j practically straight role as the wid
; ow, Mrs. Sorby, was particularly
j lovely. Burnell Gould, as the grand-
I lather, Old Ekdal, was one of the
I play's most natural actors, although
his acting was a bit exaggerated.
As Gregers Werle, Stanley Mullin
had to carry most of the obviously
! symbolic lines of the drama, and
(perhaps because his was an uncon
-1 vincing part) he seemed a bit stilted
|in the role. Robert Cathcart por
; trayed the character of Werle, Greg
ers' father, in an easy manner.
Bernard Bates, Leland Wilcox,
Henry Ramsey, and Douglas Gregg
had small parts which they handled
efficiently, and the nine dinner guests
created a charming atmosphere for
the first act.
Settings Win Applause
Harold Helvenston's two settings
more than deserved the applause they
received. Both of them were far su
perior to any he has previously exe
| cuted at Stanford, and of the two,
j his second —Hjalmar Ekdal's studio —
! was the better. His use of the seiui
; permanent structure was more skill
j fully handled than in "What Every
Woman Knows" —so much so that it
was not apparent that at least half of
the walls of the second set were the
same as those used in the first. For
accuracy and detail, they were better
than most professional work.
"The Wild Duck" was a long play,
I not being over until nearly 11:30, and
it could have stood some judicious
; cutting, as the action dragged in
places. Of the five acts, the fourth
was the best, not only because it was
I the most emotional and dramatic, but
also because the actors handled their
i parts better and the audience was
| more in sympathy with the play and
! refrained from its distracting laugh
j ter. Gordon Davis worked in his final
tableaus to good effect, and gave a
j well - rounded, understanding treat

! ment to the drama, although his di
recting, particularly in the balancing
of the stage, was a trifle obvious at
times.
