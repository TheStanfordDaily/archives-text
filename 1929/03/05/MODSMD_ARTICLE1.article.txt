### 
WASHINGTON, March 4. (/p)â€”The
Presidency of the United States
passed to Herbert Hoover today in a
colorful ceremony which he himself
described as "a dedication and conse
cration under God."
With hand upraised, he had re
peated the words of the official oath
of office, administered by Chief Jus
licc Taft, shortly after noon, and had
kissed the Bible at a passage, "He
that keepeth the law; happy is he."
A half hour earlier Charles Curtis
had succeeded Charles G. Dawes as
Vice-President in a ceremony inside
the Senate Chamber, enlivened unex
pectedly with the new and retiring
second officers, making the custom
ary brief addresses, disagreed direct
ly on the old subject of the Senate
rules.
The inaugural drama included in
its allotted units the great drigible
Los Angeles and a hundred circling
airplanes. Nearly every state had its
place in the long line of marching
clubs, bands, military commands, and
automobiles loaded down with silk
liatted governors. Officials estimated
that the rear guard would not pass
the White House reviewing stand un
til late afternoon.
One of the greatest inaugural
crowds in history assembled along the
hallowed parade route to honor him
with colorful plaudit, and thronged
the Capitol plaza to see him take his
official pledge of service.
The ceremony brought into official
roles for the first time in the history
of inaugurations, three men who have
been chosen by the mandate of the
people to sit at the head of the state.
President Coolidge, weary r of high
service, remained with his successor
through the opening hours of the
day's great events, but he already
had announced that he and Mrs. Cool
idge would leave for their Northamp
ton home as soon as their responsi
bilities had passed to new shoulders.
It fell to Wm. Howard Taft, now
Chief Justice, to be selected to admin-
I
ister the oath of the Presidency to
President Hoover on the twentieth an
niversary of the day he himself took
up the duties of Chief Executive.
