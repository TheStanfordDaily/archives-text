# REHEARSALS OF DANCE DRAMATIC PRODUCTION ARE NOW IN PROGRESS
## 
### 
First rehearsal of the dance drama,
to be presented March 12 under the
direction of Helen Stewart Cramer,
was held yesterday afternoon in the
Assembly Hall. The dances have been
worked out by the Dance Composition
Class, and only the work of perfect
ing them remains.
Schubert's Unfinished Symphony,
which is being used as the theme of
the main part of the program, is in
terpreted by the dancers in terms of
abstract movement, in accordance
with the method of modern creative
dancing. The dancer is not concerned
with any considerations of utility, but
practices in its purest form the art of
creuting design in space.
With this in mind, the Symphony is
being worked out starting with small
groups on the stage, and, as the scene
grows, with a lengthening of the lines
and a continued accession of other
groups, as the crescendo of the or
chestra is produced by increase of
tone of single players and by falling
in of additional instruments.
