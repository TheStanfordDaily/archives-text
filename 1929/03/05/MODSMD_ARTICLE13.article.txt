# STUDENTS' EFFORTS TO ASSIST AVIATOR BAD "AIR-IQUETTE"
## 
### 
Stanford students are not air
minded !
At least they would never
make honor grades in flying, for
Sunday night about 200 of Stan
ford's most erudite failed to
pass their initial test.
Clad in everything from pa
jamas to new spring suits, the
would-be campus aviators set
out to help an army flier with a
parcel to deliver land on the
Palo Alto aviation field by flood
ing auto lights on the runway.
And then the trouble started.
In their eagerness to help, the
students completely lost sight of
all rules of "air-iquette" and pro
ceeded to use the landing field as
parking space for their automo
biles.
After attempting to land sev
eral times, but on each attempt
being forced back up into the
ozone by vehicles driven across
the field, the flying soldier be
came exasperated, dropped his
package, and flew away. So the
campus aviators received a flunk
for their efforts.
