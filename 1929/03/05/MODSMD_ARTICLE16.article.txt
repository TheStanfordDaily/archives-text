# FRESHMAN NINE WILL MEET MENLO JUNIOR COLLEGE HERE TODAY
## McLean, Dixon Are Batteries For Frosh Ball Team, â€™32 Made Favorites 
### Bob Ricklefs 
"Mac" McLean will pitch and Phil
Dixon will work behind the plate for
Stanford's freshman nine when it
meets the Menlo Park Junior College
team this afternoon at 3:30 o'clock on
the sunken diamond. McLean fanned
21 batters in a game with San Jose
Teachers College last week, and he is
improving with every practice. Dixon
has just been on the frosh squad since
the close of the basketball season,
but he is rapidly getting into shape.
His arm is fast and accurate, and his
receiving is consistent.
The infield lineup will consist of
Marks at first, Barsumian on second,
White at short, and Kelly on the hot
corner. Rintala, Fox, and Waterman
will play in the outfield. Fox got his
eye on the ball in the game with
Lowell High last Saturday and clouted
a double and two singles out of four
trips to the plate. Rintala and Water
man also connected squarely, but had
but little luck in placing them.
The whole infield worked smoothly
in practice yesterday, Barsumian and
White especialyy turning in some
classy infielding. Marks and Kelly
seem to have worked the kinks out
of their arms that were bothering
them last week.
