MEXICO CITY, March 4. (/P)—The
Federal Government tonight pushed
its preparations to quell the revolts
which broke out in Mexico yesterday.
These, so far as could be learned of
ficially, are confined to Vera Cruz on
the east and Sonora on the northern
border with perhaps Oaxaca to tho
south affected.
Chapultepec Castle, seat of the gov
ernment, was the center of the mari
tal activities with Provisional Presi
dent Emilio Portes Gil holding fre
quent conferences with military lead
ers and members of his cabinet.
De Manuel Puig Casaurano, in
charge of distributing the official
communiques, said this afternoon that
a second official statement might be
expected late tonight. None had been
issued since about midnight last night.
The railroad offices at noon still
were selling tickets, indicating that
their lines were open in all directions
except on the road to Vera Cruz.
The Capital was tranquil, aside from
the active concentration of troops
during the day. Business and industry
went on largely as usual. Most all of
the inhabitants only today learned of
the outbreak from the newspapers.
The Government still exercised a
strict censorship.
The Capital still was perfectly
quiet and its general life was continu
ing as usual at 5:15 p.m. (6:15 East
ern Standard time).
