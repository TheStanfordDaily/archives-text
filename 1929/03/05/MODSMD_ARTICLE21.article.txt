# CARDINAL WATER POLO MEN PRACTICING AGAIN AFTER WEEK'S LAY-OFF
## 
### 
After a week's lapse of practice, be
cause of preparations for the Califor
nia swimming meets, the varsity and
frosh water polo teams resumed daily
practice schedules yesterday. A game
between the two teams showed
slightly ragged form and the need for
more practice before the games with
California next Saturday.
The outstanding players in yester
day's practice game were Captain
Reggie Harrison and Ogden Driggs of
the varsity squad and Captain Austin
Clapp and Frank Booth of the year
lings.
While the Card varsity polo squad
has met and defeated the Athens
Club of Oakland and the team sent
West by Northwestern University,
little is known of the actual strength
of the California aggregation. Their
two strong players are Ducato and
McLean, who swam here in the swim
ming meet last week. What other
Bear players can offer to support
these men is unknown.
