# Hamstringing the Weakling
## 
### 
Suggestion has been made to the members of the Academic Council
that "a simple revision of the Time Schedule could and should be made."
The revision would be the interchange of Tuesday and Friday classes
that three-unit courses might be concentrated at the beginning of the
week.
Ecstatic cheers will ensue at this suggestion from a goodly portion of
the student body. Here at last is the opportunity for big week-ends: five
unit courses can be cut the last two days. So.
But consider the new student, freshman or others, or even the blase
old-timer, how much does he learn in a three-unit course to begin with?
A smattering. How much will he keep in mind during the big week-end?
Not a great deal. Will he spend the week-end studying? Utopia is not
here yet. Will he wait until Sunday to prepare for the MTW class?
Most likely.
It's a great thing for those lads who come here with the "country club
for tired business men" idea uppermost in their minds. And for the trips
south, big game week-ends, and the like.it would be excellent. But, what's
a college for? A fancy vacation interspersed with casual, fleeting text
book glances?
If the Academic Council wants to do big things, make all sorts of
virile revisions, why not revive the old idea of the quarter system held
in mind at its instigation ? Cut out three- and two-unit courses entirely.
The student would then sign up for three five-unit courses and eliminate
the present tendency to take any number of small courses. This taking
"any number of small courses" is like pouring water into a vast container
where the seeking of a level establishes a shallowness worse than no water
at all.
With fewer courses and more hours in them a student might not be
come acquainted with as many things, but he would have a better under
standing of the things he did study. And it cannot be believed that three
subjects a quarter for twelve quarters couldn't give a wide enough range
of subject matter to those who gain the mystic A.B.
Pushing the three-unit course into one end of the week is hamstring
ing courses already weak. The country-club gang will whoop with de
light at the idea, but there remain, it is hoped, a few students who see
college as something beside a haven between home-dominance and hard
work.
