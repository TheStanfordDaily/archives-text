# Keep Off the Flying Field
## 
### 
Curiosity and perhaps a modicum of desire to be helpful motivated
a small herd of campus autoists to rush to the flying field Sunday night.
A plane was swooping and diving over the campus and the field.
The plane had signaled to the aviation school mechanic on duty that
it wanted to land. The mechanic had fixed two autos to illuminate the
field properly and had signaled back "go ahead." Then came the drove
of campus cars. They ran up and down the field and finally lined up on
its side. However, by the time they got organized and off the field the
plane had vanished. Their helpful antics had caused the aviator to be
lieve that he would be unable to land with safety.
In this case the plane was an Army plane bringing a package to Palo
Alto for the Palo Alto Times. It was unable to land, tossed down the
package (which was not found), and then returned to its home port.
Nothing serious was involved.
However, suppose the plane had been out of gasoline or had had a
defective motor. It would have circled a while and then in desperation
made a landing. The lives of the aviators and of those who were potter
ing around on their curious way would have been jeopardized simply
because those on the field had too little gumption to get off.
Few know that walking or driving over an aviation field is subject
to a five hundred dollar fine under the Department of Commerce Air
Regulations. Lieutenant Norman A. Goddard, president of the Palo Alto
School of Aviation, is the district Air Traffic Officer. lie is empowered
to arrest and fine violators of the air regulations.
Lieutenant Goddard does not intend to be arbitrarily high-handed in
this matter, but for the safety of visiting planes he must see that such
occurrences as Sunday's do not hinder the efficiency of the airport.
A mechanic is maintained night and day on the field, lie is able to
assist any plane in landing. The assistance of students is not needed. It
is urged that in the future students keep clear of the field. Such a simple
regulation can surely be observed when the matter of safety not only to
the observers but to the flyers is insured by its observance.

BOOTLEGGING HAS HAD A WONDERI-UL EFFECT toward
polishing the bootlegger. The sudden acquisition of wealth in this class
has brought with it a desire for social graces. Bootlegging, despite much
evidence to the contrary, has a definite effect on cultural uplift because
the bootlegger is now interested in good books.—Joseph Krcloff, in the
Chicago Daily News.
It's an ill wind that—but why go on. L# this gem speak for itself.
The editorial staff of the Daily will meet for the last time this quar
ter at the usual hour, strange to say in the usual place. Be there.
