# The 						Bullsession
## PUPPET OR LEADER? 
### 
Someone has remarked recently
that if President Hoover gets, through
the next four or eight years success
fully, he will be either one of the
great Presidents of our history or else
he will be one of the luckiest. He
takes over the office from a solemn,
silent "nobody"—a man who got into
the job by sheer fate, and then didn't
have the luck to get out right away.
Hoover faces the Prohibition prob
lem. It comes to him as an utter fail
ure, as far as enforcement goes, after
ten years of dilly-dallying. His plans
for a thorough study of the question
seems to be the best place to start.
The country as a whole can fervently
hope that he will have the courage of
his convictions and force a solution
that the facts honestly warrant. How
sad it will be if he lets himself be
ham-strung by a fanatical minority,
or wheedled into submission by the
fat purses of ex-brewery barons.

| There is surely a sensible-course of
i either strict enforcement or sane
modification. Prejudiced minorities
! should not decide which course he
■ shall choose.
Then there is Ihe farm issue. Re
gardless of Republican promises, the
I farmer is exactly where he was six
years ago. Hoover cannot ignore it.
The next few years are going to
witness a merry old "you scratch my
back, I'll scratch yours" tariff battle.
Hoover faces urgent demand for even
higher tariffs than tne present high
mark has set. It'll take all his tact
; and ability to handle is properly.
He will never under any circum
stances be able to please everybody.
[ Let us hope he pleases others than
! the smug, ostrich-like Babbitts. Presi
dent Hoover alone can decide whether
he will be a puppet or a leader. And
only in the passing of time and the
doing of deeds can we judge him.

years ago. Hoover cannot ignore it.
The next few years are going to
witness a merry old "you scratch my
back, I'll scratch yours" tariff battle.
Hoover faces urgent demand for even
higher tariffs than tne present high
mark has set. It'll take all his tact
; and ability to handle is properly.
He will never under any circum
stances be able to please everybody.
[ Let us hope he pleases others than
! the smug, ostrich-like Babbitts. Presi
dent Hoover alone can decide whether
he will be a puppet or a leader. And
only in the passing of time and the
doing of deeds can we judge him.
