## CALVIN COOLIDGE, A CLINICAL STUDY 
### 
There is coupled with the cheers for
the newly inaugurated president, the
hollow note of jeers for the retiring
executive, Calvin Coolidge. One such
shallow bleat was in part the sub
stance of Mr. Winston Norman's:
"Bullsession" of March 4. While this
current misunderstanding is probably :
a matter of little concern to Mr. Cool
idge, yet some honest effort should be
made by us to determine to what ex-1
tent this abuse of the man is merited. |
The explanation of the greater part
of the censor is a lack of the proper i
understanding of the issue and policy ,
of the past administration. We fail to
grasp the full meaning of the part
which Mr. Coolidge was compelled to
assume during his period in the presi
dency!
By the hand of fate, Calvin Coolidge \
succeeded to the presidency at the,
most critical stage of post-war recon-1
struction. The nation had passed the
crisis year of 1922 in all of its busi
ness depression, and was slowly as- j
cending to something of a former |
level. What was needed at the wheel, |
was not a driver to careen down the j
well-marked path o/ so-called pro- j
gressiveness, but a man to direct the j
return trip along'the unmarked trail
of stable, conservative politics. This
type of leadership, Calvin Coolidge !
personified: the direction that war
torn America most needed. The fault
is with us in estimating Mr. Coolidge, j
not in the proper light of an immedi-j
ate reconstruction period, but rather I
in a different time, the second decade
of the post bellum period.
The World War witnessed in Amer
ica a great assumption of legislative
power by the President. Still further,
the growth of administrative boards
and commissions during the war in- 1
duced a centralization in the chief |
executive of unprecedented power of
control. Congress was grudgingly com- j
pelled to acquiesce in this executive i
assumption of power as arising in i
times of stress. But the reaction of j
legislative authority began with the j
administration of 1921. This Congres- i
sional antagonism to executive au-1
thority shadowed the entire period of |

office of President Coolidge. Com
pelled to play almost a minor role by
the trend of legislative and popular
opinion, he played that part to per
fection in still remaining the calm
central figure who held to one, needed
practice—economy. Indicative of pol
icy and strength was his action at the
; time of the Soldiers' Bonus. Such a
; popular measure following the War,
! swept across the country like fire, and
I was supported by a Congress mindful
of its interests at the approaching
| elections. President Coolidge was the
I sole leader who, believing the bonus
| to be closely connected with our eco
nomic rehabilitation, possessed the
j courage to refuse his assent. His rea
sons have since fortunately been dis
proved, but who can deny him to be
| a man of strength of conviction, true
; to his party pledge, economy! Would
our political agitators of the Reed or
LaFollette type been so unswayed by
1 the personal gain from such a popu
lar movement ?
Calvin Coolidge as president pos-
I sessed the faculty of choosing techni
| cal advisors better informed than him
j self. His terms of office showed no
I disheartening cabinet shakeups. Co
; operation with the foundation of the
I common success. Mr. Norman, the
blind criticism of Mr. Coolidge is less
! intolerant than distorted. That he
was not a visionary like Wilson, or
Harding, is entirely a commendation
j of his appreciation of the actual needs
! of the United States, six years ago.
i Attendant upon the election of Her
bert C. Hoover we may well look for
the dawn of a new era in American
Achievement. But no small part of the
present foundation of actual prosper
ity arose in the capable, cautious
; leadership of Calvin Coolidge. The
J period of before mentioned of Con
! gressional reaction to executive domi
nance has passed with the election
j of Mr. Hoover, and our fullest praise
I alone can be extended to the man
I who, receiving an almost barren lieri-
I tage, the Democratic hangover, has
| transferred to Mr. Hoover, the leader
i ship of an efficient, prosperous na-
I tien, at home and abroad.
