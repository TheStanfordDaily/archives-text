# SUZZALLO NOMINATION OUT OF ORDER
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I observe in the columns of Campus
Opinion at least two efforts, of late, to
assist the University in matters of
administration —not by suggestion or
objection, but by actual nomination.
To the well-intent but ill-advised per
sons so gleefully pushing the fortunes
of the admired Dr. Suzzallo, two
things should be said.
We happen to have now serving
the University not only a completely \
competent and eminent man as Presi-1
dent (temporarily on leave), but an- |
other capable and representative j
scholar as Vice-President (acting for
the President on leave). The second
comment is made only because the
first may be inadequate (having at j
any rate been disregarded by the j
Washingtonian enthusiasts so far): j
it strikes me that suggestion from :
anyone about replacing the chief of-i

fleers of the University when they
are yet on duty is in the most of
fensive bad taste.
—Another Alumna, '14.
