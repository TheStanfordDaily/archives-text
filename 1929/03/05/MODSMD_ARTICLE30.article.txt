'Twas naugra, and the shufty gops
Did churk and chunkle in the mike.
All grninish were the brassicops
And the scofflaws outstrike.
He took his trident sword in hand
Long time the maxim issue sought
Then tested he Prosperity
And what the primers taught.
And as his glum pish words outflicked
The Clabberquack (a mythy beast)
Came whirtling round, was shortway
whicked
Or so they hist, at least.
For two and three, and two and three,
His shurzy blade went snickeranee.
He left it dead, and smuking, said,
It's dead as dead can be.
And has thou slain the Clabberquack?
Though no corpse is in sight,
We yurp that all is jakelack
And vanning visters bright.
'Twas naugra, and the shufty cops
Did churk and chunkle in the mike.
All grinnish were the brassicops
And the scofflaws outstrike.
Exult, oh shores, and ring, oh bells,
But I, with mournful pen,
The verbal epidemic dread
Of "Say, I knew him when . .
From now on we will have more and
more of that type of yin whose sole
claim to fame is that he managed to
pass the intelligence test and get into
"Herbie's old Alma Matter."
The Military Ball's theme will be
the Foreign Legion—probably, says
sweet Rosie O'Gray of Roble, in honor
of the imports.
What with all the Daily's literary
chatty-chat-chat concerning "The
Wild Duck" we suggest that it is only
the Chinese drama that is truly cym
balic.
