# C. D. MARX BELIEVES LEGAL DIFFICULTIES WILL OBSTRUCT STATE WATER PROJECTS
## Financiers Must Be Shown an Economic Justification for $304,000,000 Program; Federal Aid Doubtful 
### James H. Myers 
"Although they are feasible from
an engineering standpoint, the carry
ing out of such interlocking projects
will be hampered by so many legal
difficulties that I doubt if there is any
prospect of completing them without
long legal controversies," declared
Charles D. Marx, professor of civil
engineering, emeritus, in regard to
the $304,000,000 state projects for stor
age structures, flood control, stream
purity, and a Boulder Canyon to Los
Angeles aqueduct.
Conflict in Laws
"The legal difficulties facing this
proposition are caused by the conflict
between the riparian law and the so
called law of water appropriation. The
recent supreme court decision on the
case of the Herminghaus estate ver
sus the Southern California Edison
Company has left us uncertain as to
appropriation rights." Professor Marx
spoke from experience gained while
chairman of California's first State
Water Commission, 1911 to 1914.
"I doubt if an economic study
would justify the carrying out of the
projects. Even though the bonds were
voted I doubt if they could be sold.
Financiers would have to be shown
an economic justification for the pro-

Ijects.
"This very elaborate program,
which was recommended to the legis
lature by the Crittenden committee,
has been worked out by former State
Engineer Paul Bailey and Edward J.
Hyatt, Jr., '10, the present state en
gineer, from a very careful study
| costing $200,000.
"It is suggested in the report that
| the state take over the water supply
j for California cities. So far the com
munities have handled their own
water problems, including financing,
without state aid. It stands to reason
that the individual communities, with
I water systems already installed, will
, not welcome the extra taxation to
| help other communities finance water
supply projects."
No Federal Aid
In regard to the proposal that the
federal government will assist the
: state in carrying out the big projects,
I Professor Marx said: "The Reclama
| tion Service is having difficulty at the
present time in getting colonists on
j already completed projects and pay
ing off the construction costs. The
federal government can not afford to
become involved in a proposition
I where the legal difficulties are going
I to run into an enormous expense."
