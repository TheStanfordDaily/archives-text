# HOOVER'S SPEECH STRESSES PEACE, LAW ENFORCEMENT
## Inaugural Address Recognizes Universal Amity and Internal Law Enforcement as Prime Necessities 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 4. (/P) â€”With simple, forceful language reflective of
" his own personality, Herbert Hoover today dedicated himself and his
Administration to law enforcement at home and the promotion of peace
throughout the world.
These two purposes stood out in bold relief in his inaugural address,
delivered from a simply decorated stand on the east front of the Capitol

' after he had taken the oath as the
thirty-first President of the United
States.
Stresses Law Obedience
Declaring that the most malign of
all the dangers from which self-gov
ernment must be safeguarded today is
the disregard and disobedience of law,
the President said that "to consider
these evils, to find their remedy, is
the most sore necessity of our times."
"Rigid and expeditious justice is the
first safeguard of freedom, the basis
of all ordered liberty, the vital force
of progress," he said. "It must not
come to be in our republic that it
can be defeated by the indifference of
the citizen, by exploitation of delays
and entanglements of the law, or by
combinations of criminals."
Turning to the enforcement of the
eighteenth amendment, Mr. Hoover
asserted that abuses which had grown
up around it are due in part to the
failure of some states to accept their
share of the responsibility for con
current enforcement and to the fail
ure of many state and local officials
to zealously enforce the law.
Judicial System Inquiry
Reiterating his determination to ap
point a national commission for a
searching investigation, the Chief
Executive disclosed that its inquiry
would go to the whole structure of
the federal system of jurisprudence
as well as to methods of enforcement
of the eighteenth amendment and the
causes of abuse under it.
Solemnly asserting that the United
States not only desires peace with the
world, but to see peace maintained
throughout the world, the President
expressed the hope for ultimate
American adherence to the World
Court and declared that the accept
ance of the recent treaty for the re
nunciation of war "should pave the
way to greater limitation of arma
ment, the offer of which we sincerely
extend to the world."
Turning again to domestic affairs
the Chief Executive said further agri
cultural relief and "limited changes"
in the tariff "can not in justice to our
farmers, our labor, and manufacturers
be postponed," adding that he would
request a special session of Congress
for the consideration of these ques
tions.
