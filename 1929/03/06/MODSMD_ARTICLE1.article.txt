# HOOVER'S INITIAL POLICY DECISION MADE ON REVOLT
## Sales of Munitions Will Be Made to Support Mexican Provisional Regime of Gil Secretary Kellogg Worries As Censorship Withholds Information on Situation 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 5.
ico's revolutionary outbreak, prompt
ed today the first important policy
pronouncement of Herbert Hoover's
administration as President.
Mr. Hoover was represented at the
White House, and after he had twice
conferred with Secretary Kellogg, as
seeing no reason for a change in the
policy under which the constitutional
government of Mexico has been per
mitted to purchase arms and war ma
terials in the United States despite
the five-year general embargo on such
exportations to Mexico.
The embargo was set up in 1924
when the De La Huerta revolution
ists sought to buy war supplies in the
United States. In December 1923, how
ever, a large supply of surplus Ameri
can army rifles, machine guns, and
munitions was sold to the Obregon
government by the War Department
by direction of President Coolidge.
At that time the State Department
announced that the sale had been
made "in view of the relations be
tween this government and the Mexi
can government and of the import
ance of the maintenance of stability
and orderly constitutional procedure
in the neighboring republic."
There was no indication at the
White House or State Department to
day that any request for arms had
been received from President Gil due
to the new revolutionary disorder.
Both the scope and seriousness of the
revolt still were hidden behind the
strict censorship enforced by the
Mexico City government. It was doubt
ful that even official advices from
Ambassador Morrow in Mexico City
were more informative than published
news reports from Mexico and points
on the border. The situation was suf
ficiently grave, however, to cause
Secretary Kellogg anxiety.
In some quarters the White House
pronouncement was regarded as a
calculated step in support of the
Mexican constitutional government
since at least it served notice on the
revolutionary groups that they may
not expect aid from the United States.
