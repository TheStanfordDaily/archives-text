### 
GENEVA, March 5. (^P)—£lihu Root
today made his first concrete move '
to Ret the United States into the !
World Court of Justice. He had a
I lons talk with Foreign Minister Aris
' tide Briand of France and explained
his formula, written as he traversed
the Atlantic, designed to bridge the
difficulty created by the American
reservation concerning the right of
the Council of the League to ask the
j Court for advisory opinions.
After this meeting, the Associated
j Press was informed by French circles
j that France already Las manifested
a keen desire to have America join
! the Court as a measure of promoting
I peace. Nevertheless, in the interest j
|of the League and Court there re- j
! mains a question whether the United
| States can be given privileges which
I may well be demanded by other non-
I member states, and even by member
; countries which are not members of
j the Council.
The point of this observation is that
! lhe Root formula gives the right to
the United States to exchange views
; with the Council to determine wheth
! er an American objection to a request
i for an advisory opinion should be sus- !
i tained or rejected. It is remarked j
that other countries, for example,
Russia or Mexico, might ask for a
; similar prerogative.
