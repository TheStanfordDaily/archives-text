## Voigt and Dawson to Make Varsity Debuts Before Fans in Pavilion 
### John Isaacs 
Action, in carload quantities, is
promised by Coach Harry Maloney
when the boxers of the California
Agriculture College and the Stanford
varsity mix at 8 o'clock tonight in the
j local Pavilion.
In the four heaviest classes, the
Cardinals will be represented by new-
I comers. Dissatisfied with the showing
of his veterans against California last
week, Maloney has temporarily shift
ed the lineup.
The lightweight bout should be a
real battle. Danny Frost, scrappy lit
tle Stanford fighter, tangles with Cap
tain Les Waight, the cleverest boxer
on the Aggie squad. Waight won an
extra round decision from Frost last
month at Davis, but Frost has im
proved since that first Card-Aggie
tournament and will enter the ring
; on even terms with his opponent.
Fred Voigt will box in the heavy
weight division in place of Captain
jEd Dillon. Voigt, who has had no
: tournament experience, has been de
veloping rapidly under the special in
struction of George Dawson and prom
ises to cause plenty of trouble for
Benny Robinson of Davis.
Stanford will be well defended in
Die featherweight class with Vance
Rogers who meets Jesse McNames of
! the Aggies. Johnny Sano, Japanese
, bantamweight, has been in a slump
I lor the past week, but Maloney ex
pects him to be in shape tonight when
he will meet either George Padrillo
or Ralph Carlson.
Hal Crumly, victor over Brick Mar
i cus last year, will be back in the ring
! for the Cardinals. He tangles with
I Bog Schies, Aggie light-heavyweight.
Johnny Dawson will have his chance
to make good on the varsity when he
meets Bob Streeter in the welter
weight bout. Milt Cohen, Card mid
dleweight, will have a busy evening.
Cohen boxes Foster Vierra, winner
over A1 Doerr of Stanford and George
Sherwood of California.
