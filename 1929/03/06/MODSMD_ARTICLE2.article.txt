# Perfect Lighting Planned For Dance Drama Tuesday
## 
### 
The importance of lighting is being
stressed in the presentation of the
Dance Drama to be given next Tues
day evening in the Assembly Hall.
Particular emphasis is being placed
on the color of the light in relation
to the coloring in the costumes, espe
cially in the symphony.
The costuming will be realistic in
the case of only one dance in the
program. The rest will use a tunic
lype of costume, differing only in
color and length. Similar and contrast
ing colors are being grouped with
a view to creating pictorial effects
and interpreting the mood of the
music and dance.
