# REBEL GARRISON SURRENDERS TO ADVANCING MEXICAN ARMY
## Eastern Rebellion Is Confined To Coastal Plain; Calles Prepares Battle in North Estimate Only One-Sixth of Army Has Joined Revolt; Government Is Confident

MEXICO CITY, March 6. (Mid
night Bulletin) (/P) —While Fed
eral forces of Mexico, under the
personal direction of ex-President
Calles, were intent upon organi
zation of their positions, insur
gents were claiming victories in
clashes throughout the country.
A signal victory was won at
Monterey where the rebels cap
tured 100 federals, killed General
Lurriga, and took over much war
material.
I MEXICO CITY, March 5. (/P)—'The
j Federal Government tonight an
j nouneed its first important success
in the campaign to crush the revolt
which broke out on Sunday. The en
tire rebel garrison of Orizaba, a regi
j ment numbering about 500 men, was
:reported to have surrendered to the
! advancing loyal troops led by General
i Andreu Almazan. Whether conflict
1 preceded the surrender was not
|stated.
Orizaba is an important city in the
State of Vera Cruz, situated on the
railroad line which connects the capi
tal with the Gulf of Mexico through
the port of Vera Cruz. When General
Jesus Maria Aguirre led into rebellion
the troops under his command in
i Vera Cruz, they seized Orizaba to
gether with other important cities of
| the state. Regained possession by the
! Federals means that they are within
80 miles of the port.
From this communique it would ap
pear tonight that the eastern rebels
are confined largely to the coastal
| plain and would have a sharp uphill
fight if they choose to attack the
federals.
Calles Is War Secretary
Former President Calles, now Sec
j retary of War because of the emer
j gency, was preparing to direct the
I campaign against the insurgents in
I the north. All that was known of the
j situation in that direction was that
| the National Railway announced it
| would sell tickets northward on the
J Laredo Line only to San Luis Potosi
' and on the Juarez Line only to Cani
| ta3 in the State of Zacatecas.
Officials here estimated today that
not more than one-sixth of the army
: or about 10,000 men out of more than
; 00,000 have joined the rebel move
! ment. The authorities pointed out that
in the De La Huerta revolution in
1323 more than half of the army re
j volted and yet the government won.
The federal authorities have cut
i
the Southern Pacific Line on the west
coast so as to prevent the Sonora
rebels from moving south. Because
there are no other railroad connec
tions between Sonora and the central
part of the republic the government
believes the insurgents will be unable
j to advance against other states.
