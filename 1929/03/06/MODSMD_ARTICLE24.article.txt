# Descriptions Differ But Trespass Is Forbidden

Tn relation to the Campus Opinions appearing today, the following
account of the incident referred to therein is printed. It was written by
Lieutenant Goddard of the aviation school. Other eye-witnesses substan
tiate Lieutenant Goddard's description. Compare this with the descrip
tions in the Campus Opinions.
"On the night of Sunday, March 3rd, an Army plane tlew over
the flying field of the Palo Alto School of Aviation about 9:30 p.m.
and signaled his intention of landing. The aviation mechanic on
duty at the airport (and there is one both day and night at all
times) immediately signaled back "O.K. to land." At present the
field is not equipi>ed with landing lights, so he placed two cars with
headlights on to mark the runway for the convenience of the pilot
who could, with this assistance, have made a safe landing without
any difficulty whatever. But cars (from the University chiefly)
drove out across the field and up and down the runways in all
directions, making it quite impossible for the pilot to make a
landing."
Yesterday's editorial on this affair stressed the warning sent out by
the aviation school to students and others concerning walking or driving
across the field. Such action as was pointed out endangers those who so
do, makes landing impossible for aviators who chance to be over the field
at the time, and lays the violators of the regulation against this open to a
live hundred dollar fine.
The editorial was written to warn against this in the light of safety
to all. It did not intend to waste space censuring. Good though the inten
tions of the people on the field were, they did prevent the plane from
landing. In this case no unfortunate results came of their action. The
future may bring planes in distress to the field; the Daily urges again
that students and any who chance to go near the field observe the Depart
ment of Commerce Air Regulation which explicitly forbids trespassing on
flying fields.
