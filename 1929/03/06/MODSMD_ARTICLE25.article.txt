# Don't Say It With Flowers
## 
### 
Corsages are not an institution at campus dances. Some person or
persons with a real sense of the fitness of things inaugurated the prece
dent that it was bad taste for the women to wear flowers to cotillions,
senior balls, and the like, and this rule of Stanford etiquette has been for
the most part well observed.
Occasionally, however, some young gentleman who is either feeling
particularly flush or is anxious to make a good impression, forgets to play
fair and sends his partner for the evening a corsage. She appears at the
dance so adorned and is the cause for considerable mental comment and
of some embarrassment to others who, although realizing that they are
playing the game as it should be played, nevertheless do not wish to appear
neglectful.
The Military Ball approaches, and it is to be hoped that no Stanford
woman or import will appear at the Pavilion with (lowers on her shoulder.
To tell the truth, the women do not want them. They are not such gold
diggers at heart as those of their sex are generally credited with being,
cind are glad to respect this custom of good taste.
