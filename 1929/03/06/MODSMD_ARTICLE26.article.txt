# The 						Yale Curiosity Shop
## 
### 
Good old Yale, stronghold of eastern erudition, cracks out yearly with
a questionnaire that would do credit to many a high school. I>y its search
ing inquiry such stupendous problems are solved as who is the most
popular man, the most likely to succeed, the most versatile, the most mod
est, the wittiest, the best-natured, the best-looking, the greatest social
celebrity, what is the pleasantest college year, the least valuable subject,
the oldest man, the youngest, the tallest, the shortest, who is the favorite
actor, actress, poet, author, what is the favorite smoke, magazine, the most
desired honor, and so on.
Here is provided enough subject matter to fill a museum of natural
curiosity. From the tabulated confessional such sparkling facts were
gleaned as the oldest man (senior), 33 years 4 months 12 days (now no
doubt fivtfdays older) ; the tallest man, 6 feet 6 inches ; the favorite maga
zine, the Saturday Evening Post (and at Yale) ; favorite movie actor,
Jannings; actress, Joan Crawford (the highbrows) ; most admired living
man, Lindbergh, who tied with "my father" and was closely followed by
"myself" (conceit? tut tut).
From the Ripley point of view this Yale curiosity shop is well fur
nished and from the newspaper angle of "human interest" it is a Gol
conda, but then think of the valuable Yale time, Yale energy, Yale brains,
etc., etc., used up to compile this compendium of thirty odd, very odd
characteristics. Hut then one is a senior and after that he becomes quite
serious.
IS IIERP.ERT HOOVER TIIETHLRTIETH ORTHETIIIRTY
FIRST president of the United States? This question has caused two
such authoritative institutions as the Nation and the Associated Press to
disagree on the matter intentionally or by error. The Nation calls I loover
thirty-first chief; Associated Press dispatches name him thirtieth.
Not to apple-polish with our news association, but careful count seems
to verify the AP enumeration. It is l>elicved that Cleveland because of
serving two terms, divided by the term of Harrison, is counted twice
many times thus causing the continued error. Coolidgc was called both
twenty-ninth and thirtieth.
