# The 						Bullsession

R. I. P.
It gets painfully tiresome to listen
continually to our friend Mr. Mencken
rail, and scatter hither-and-yon gal
lons of bile on what he calls Ameri
canism bilge-water. Rut it is refresh
ing at times to let him pick us up by
the scruff of the neck and show us
what's what. Rather hard on our fat
necks, to be sure, but how we need it!
It is especially enjoyable to see him
prick the hot air balloons of those
who set the innocuous Coolidge up as
an inimitable god who has naught but
perfection scrolled on his heavenly
record.
Mr. Mencken can find but one in
stance in which Coolidge has ven
tured into self-analysis. It was when
he said: "I have often remarked that
at least I had one distinction. I have
been the healthiest President that
the country has ever had."
Then, says Mr. Mencken, "Let the
historians put it down. The chances
seem very good that when they come

! to write the Cooligiad they will have
little else to say."
The Coolidge era has been lifeless
j and unimportant. Even the Harding
i regime had about it a rosy life-glow
i of good, conscientious crookedness.
The last six years have seen un
paralleled business prosperity in the
I country. The swing-back from the
Roosevelt "Big-Stick" days has en
abled business to profit immeasur-
I ably. The years ahead seem propi
' tious for even greater material suc
;cesses.
But through it all, the Honorable
| Mr. Coolidge has sat unperturbed and
i unexpressive, handling the routine of
] government like a worn-out school
{ ma'am teaching arithmetic,
| Occasionally he has come out of se
. elusion and donned a ridiculous ten
; gallon hat, or graced a public cere
! mony with a few weak words de
livered with a thin nasal twang.
Now that the spotlight leaves him,
; may he rest in peace.

R. I. P.
It gets painfully tiresome to listen
continually to our friend Mr. Mencken
rail, and scatter hither-and-yon gal
lons of bile on what he calls Ameri
canism bilge-water. Rut it is refresh
ing at times to let him pick us up by
the scruff of the neck and show us
what's what. Rather hard on our fat
necks, to be sure, but how we need it!
It is especially enjoyable to see him
prick the hot air balloons of those
who set the innocuous Coolidge up as
an inimitable god who has naught but
perfection scrolled on his heavenly
record.
Mr. Mencken can find but one in
stance in which Coolidge has ven
tured into self-analysis. It was when
he said: "I have often remarked that
at least I had one distinction. I have
been the healthiest President that
the country has ever had."
Then, says Mr. Mencken, "Let the
historians put it down. The chances
seem very good that when they come

! to write the Cooligiad they will have
little else to say."
The Coolidge era has been lifeless
j and unimportant. Even the Harding
i regime had about it a rosy life-glow
i of good, conscientious crookedness.

paralleled business prosperity in the
I country. The swing-back from the
