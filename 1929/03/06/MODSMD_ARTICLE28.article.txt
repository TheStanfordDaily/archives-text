God in the Modern World. Symposium.
(New York: E. P. Dutton & Com
pany. $2.50.)
Eugene O'Neill introduces his new
play, "Dynamo," with the statement
that it is one of a trilogy "which will
dig at the roots of the sickness of
today as I feel it —the death of an old
God and the failure of science and
materialism to give any satisfying
new one."
Whether or not Mr. O'Neill has suc
ceeded in making the theatre hold
man and his dreams of God seems to
be an open question, but at least he
has added his contribution to a dis
cussion which is engaging the most
wide-awake minds in the world today.
In a Symposium on "God in the
Modern World" some of the outstand
ing figures in English life, notably
Viscount Haldane, Dr. A. A. David,
Bishop of Liverpool, Dr. Percy Dear
mer, G. A. Studdert-Kennedy, and
Hugh Walpole state what religion has
come to mean to them and what they
think it ought to mean to the modern
man.
Hugh Walpole, for instance, says
he believes that "there is a more
genuinely religious questioning spirit
abroad today than in any living man's
memory, in spite of the fact that the
churches on both sides of the Atlan
tic seem to be emptying."
Mr. Walpole recounts his own reli
gious experiences as his contribution
to the Symposium. On account of the
Church of England Sundays of his
youth, he says, he early got the idea
that God must be a large stout man
with a white beard sitting on a cloud
that was carefully placed so that he
could see all that was going on in the
world below "and my natural egotism
led me to believe that he had his eye
directly and especially upon myself."
Later in his boyhood, he says, he be
gan to question the dogmas of his
childhood and fancied that God de
spised the ridiculous ecclesiastical
world around him as much as he did.
"During the years 1908 to 1924,"
says Mr. Walpole, "interest in spiritu
al things seemed very low indeed. I
frankly treated God during this time
as a kind of boon companion who was
out on a spree with me, and was
lucky to have me with him. I found
that it was taken for granted in all
the circles that I frequented that the
Christian religion was hopelessly out

moded; that it was almost impolite
to talk about God and certainly crude.
I found that the London world at least
did very nicely without any religion
at all.
"When the War came," says Mr.
j Walpole, "I began to realize that I
must be receptive rather than posi
tive, that I must place myself in the
position of one waiting for news
rather than the definite announcer of
| dogmatic facts, and I became aware
| of a number of things. I found that
! the differences between various reli
! gions became infinitely small to me,
! that I welcomed any religious school
if it led its followers towards that
contact with this inner spiritual life
of which I was beginning to be so
| conscious, that you seemed to be able
| to enter this life through countless
| different doors, everyone had his own
j method of approach.
"I found too that my own conscious-
I ness of increasing spiritual activity
j was, when I came to define it, too
i vague to be of much use to anyone
I else, and I realized how essential it
always was for anyone who wanted to
share his spiritual life with others to
form a very definite creed as Confu
cius, Buddha, Mohammed, and Christ
had done, and that these creeds were
only a tiny part of all that they them
selves were conscious of knowing;
and that this inevitably happened af
| terwards, that the followers of these
' creeds extended them to cover the
! whole of the prophet's own experience,
! magnified words into laws, turned
I laws into tyrannies, and all this out
| of only the smallest, easiest, the least
important parts, of the prophet's ori
ginal experience.
"I can understand too the necessity
!of all and every religious creed; one
man is led by one path .another by
another; I understand further the ne
cessity that every human being should
obey the instructions of his own per
sonal experience; contempt for an
other's religious belief seems to me
now one of the worst of crimes.
"I am only in the middle years of
i my physical life and in the very ear
liest moments of my religious life;
I am aware that to anyone who be
lieves in a very definite religious
1 creed my statement here must seem
vague and amorphous; I would only
; ask them to be tolerant towards an
| experience that is yet in its earliest
i stage." —Clifford F. Weigle.
