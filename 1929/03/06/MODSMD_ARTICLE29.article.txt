The Editor, Sir:
It is a wonder the Palo Alto School
of Aviation tolerates Stanford Uni
versity on its grounds. An incident
Sunday night, from the students'
viewpoint, was this: An airplane
zoomed over the black flying field at
a time when the halls were filled. It
whirled and dipped and circled and
raced its motor —gave every sign pos
sible to attract attention. It seemed
obvious to everyone who watched
from a point of vantage, while the
plane swept over the field for ten
minutes, that it was in distress —that
it wanted to land. Stopping only to
curse the flying field for inadequate
safety facilities for night-landing (now
being prepared) the students piled
out. They organized, spurred only by
a desire to prevent a serious accident
by illuminating the field. It took time
to organize, and the plane had ample
time to land, if two puny lights, which
the Daily says were set up by a mech
anic, and which should have been
leady in a minute's time, were enough.
Instead, the pilot made several at
tempts, then flew away toward San
Jose. I3y that time the cars were dash
ing to aid him, and when he returned
they were nearly ready to line up,

] with several headlights trained on
| big trees that would have meant sure
death. But he did not wait this time;
after traipsing around for nearly half
I an hour, and so the efforts were un
-1 availing. That is the story —and we'll
I stick to it.
| But today the Daily prints a "hu
j morous" feature and an enditorial, in*
: spired, I understand, by a letter from
Lt. Goddard, decrying the crowd of
several hundred perfectly intelligent
students who were bound, not from
I curiosity (for they could easily have
[ watched from their windows, and did,
! for many minutes) but from a feeling
J that help was needed. The lieutenant
soys that aid was given, and that the
! students interfered. Frankly, we don't
believe it. It looks like an alibi to us.
The flying field, exploiting univer
| sit.v land for combined commercial
and educational purposes, has long
been a nuisance. Only the future need
I excuses it. Strict regulations against
flying over the campus have constant
ly been broken.
The time is hardly at hand when
Lt. Goddard can, in a fatherly way,
chide men who may have ranked
pretty high in intelligence tests.
The only bright aftermath of the

j incident was that some pictures, des-'
tined for our own P.A. Times, were
lost. They were probably of Hoover,
and, as the old joke goes—"Book? No,
we already got a book." —B. G. j
The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial of yesterday's issue
| censures students for driving their
autos on the flying field last Sunday
night when an army airplane was at
! tempting to land. The editorial is
timely, perhaps, in that it is a warn
ing against repetition of this Incident,
j But in defense of those students who
i are "offenders" may I (a witness of
the whole affair) say the following:
The plane first circled the field for
more than ten minutes before the
1 general attention of the students was
attracted. It had another five minutes |
; to land before the students drove on
he field. Those who did drive on the
! field arrived after the plane had flown !
toward San Jose; and they went there
in the spirit of helping a man in dis- |
! tress —as this man seemed to be, with j
: his unusual maneuvers.
On the pilot's second attempt, after
returning from San Jose, there was
i little more reason for complaint than j
1 before, considering, of course, that
regulations be suspended in cases of '
emergency—as this certainly appeared
to be. Even the pilot had ample op-j
portunity to land. All the autos finally j
gathered at one end of the field and j
i remained there for fifteen minutes. ;
j Not to accuse the flying field officials
of inefficiency, nor to suspect Mr. i
Goddard of seeking publicity or pro- j
tection, but it seems as though there j
is something peculiar about the whole
I affair.
| May I ask Mr. Goddard the follow
ing appropriate questions: Are experi- I
enced pilots in the habit of dropping j
parcels where they cannot be found? j
( Such is the case here, according to
Goddard. Was there actually an at
i tendant at the field at the time, or I
was there supposed to be one there?
I What prevented the plane making a j
; landing when all the autos were lined ;
j up at one small end of the field?
Were you, Mr. Goddard, a witness?
—An "Offender."

The Editor, Sir:
It is a wonder the Palo Alto School
of Aviation tolerates Stanford Uni
versity on its grounds. An incident
Sunday night, from the students'
viewpoint, was this: An airplane
zoomed over the black flying field at
a time when the halls were filled. It
whirled and dipped and circled and
raced its motor —gave every sign pos
sible to attract attention. It seemed
obvious to everyone who watched
from a point of vantage, while the
plane swept over the field for ten
minutes, that it was in distress —that
it wanted to land. Stopping only to
curse the flying field for inadequate
safety facilities for night-landing (now
being prepared) the students piled
out. They organized, spurred only by
a desire to prevent a serious accident
by illuminating the field. It took time
to organize, and the plane had ample
time to land, if two puny lights, which
the Daily says were set up by a mech
anic, and which should have been
leady in a minute's time, were enough.
Instead, the pilot made several at
tempts, then flew away toward San
Jose. I3y that time the cars were dash
ing to aid him, and when he returned
they were nearly ready to line up,

] with several headlights trained on
| big trees that would have meant sure
death. But he did not wait this time;
after traipsing around for nearly half
I an hour, and so the efforts were un
-1 availing. That is the story —and we'll
I stick to it.
| But today the Daily prints a "hu
j morous" feature and an enditorial, in*
: spired, I understand, by a letter from
Lt. Goddard, decrying the crowd of
several hundred perfectly intelligent
students who were bound, not from
I curiosity (for they could easily have
[ watched from their windows, and did,
! for many minutes) but from a feeling
J that help was needed. The lieutenant
soys that aid was given, and that the
! students interfered. Frankly, we don't
believe it. It looks like an alibi to us.
The flying field, exploiting univer
| sit.v land for combined commercial
and educational purposes, has long
been a nuisance. Only the future need
I excuses it. Strict regulations against
flying over the campus have constant
ly been broken.
The time is hardly at hand when
Lt. Goddard can, in a fatherly way,
chide men who may have ranked
pretty high in intelligence tests.
The only bright aftermath of the

j incident was that some pictures, des-'
tined for our own P.A. Times, were
lost. They were probably of Hoover,
and, as the old joke goes—"Book? No,
we already got a book." —B. G. j

The Editor, Sir:
Your editorial of yesterday's issue
| censures students for driving their
autos on the flying field last Sunday
night when an army airplane was at
! tempting to land. The editorial is
timely, perhaps, in that it is a warn
ing against repetition of this Incident,
j But in defense of those students who
i are "offenders" may I (a witness of
the whole affair) say the following:
The plane first circled the field for
more than ten minutes before the
1 general attention of the students was
attracted. It had another five minutes |
; to land before the students drove on
he field. Those who did drive on the
! field arrived after the plane had flown !
toward San Jose; and they went there
in the spirit of helping a man in dis- |
! tress —as this man seemed to be, with j
: his unusual maneuvers.
On the pilot's second attempt, after
returning from San Jose, there was
i little more reason for complaint than j
1 before, considering, of course, that
regulations be suspended in cases of '
emergency—as this certainly appeared
to be. Even the pilot had ample op-j
portunity to land. All the autos finally j
gathered at one end of the field and j
i remained there for fifteen minutes. ;
j Not to accuse the flying field officials
of inefficiency, nor to suspect Mr. i
Goddard of seeking publicity or pro- j
tection, but it seems as though there j
is something peculiar about the whole
I affair.
| May I ask Mr. Goddard the follow
ing appropriate questions: Are experi- I
enced pilots in the habit of dropping j
parcels where they cannot be found? j
( Such is the case here, according to
Goddard. Was there actually an at
i tendant at the field at the time, or I
was there supposed to be one there?
I What prevented the plane making a j
; landing when all the autos were lined ;
j up at one small end of the field?
Were you, Mr. Goddard, a witness?
—An "Offender."
The Editor, Sir:
It is a wonder the Palo Alto School
of Aviation tolerates Stanford Uni
versity on its grounds. An incident
Sunday night, from the students'
viewpoint, was this: An airplane
zoomed over the black flying field at
a time when the halls were filled. It
whirled and dipped and circled and
raced its motor —gave every sign pos
sible to attract attention. It seemed
obvious to everyone who watched
from a point of vantage, while the
plane swept over the field for ten
minutes, that it was in distress —that
it wanted to land. Stopping only to
curse the flying field for inadequate
safety facilities for night-landing (now
being prepared) the students piled
out. They organized, spurred only by
a desire to prevent a serious accident
by illuminating the field. It took time
to organize, and the plane had ample
time to land, if two puny lights, which
the Daily says were set up by a mech
anic, and which should have been
leady in a minute's time, were enough.
Instead, the pilot made several at
tempts, then flew away toward San
Jose. I3y that time the cars were dash
ing to aid him, and when he returned
they were nearly ready to line up,

] with several headlights trained on
| big trees that would have meant sure
death. But he did not wait this time;
after traipsing around for nearly half
I an hour, and so the efforts were un
-1 availing. That is the story —and we'll
I stick to it.

j morous" feature and an enditorial, in*
