## Weissmuller's Successor? 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Those who are interested in men's |
swimming activities, and who have 1
been going around with long faces i
I ever since Johnnie Weismuller turned I
professional, may cheer up a bit, be- J
I cause Albert Zorilla is soon coming
back to America and will again live
!in New York and compete for the I
! New York Athletic Club.
j
"Who," you may well ask, "is Al- j
| bert Zorilla?" (Not to be confused |
| with "Gorilla," as are some athletes.) j
Zorilla comes from the Argentine, but ;
J so far no one has called him a "Wild
Bull." He is a fine swimmer, and, j
! representing his country in the 400
meters free-style event at the Olympic |
; Games, proved one of the dark horses
! of the meet by defeating the famous j

"Boy" Charlton, of Australia, and the
equally famous Arnie Borg, of Swe
den, to win in the new Olympic rec
ord time of 5 minutes 1 3-5 seconds.
Zorilla also competed in the 100
meters, placing second in the second
heat, and he finished fifth in the final
of the 1500 meters.
Like Weissmuller, Al is also a fine
back-stroke swimmer. Recent reports
from Buenos Aires show that he is
faster than ever. In a 50-meter pool
he thrashed 100 meters, free-style in
59 1-5, 400 meters in 4:53, and 1500
meters in 20:10. That, my friends, is
swimming to make even Johnnie
Weissmuller open his eyes. It looks
as though "Al of the Pampas"- has
just started.
