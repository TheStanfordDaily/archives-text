# BASEBALL TITLE GOES TO SOPHS AS JUNIOR TEAM FORFEITS GAME
## 
### 
The sophomores automatically won
the interclass baseball championship
yesterday afternoon, when the juniors
failed to put in an appearance as
scheduled, and forfeited. This was the
soph players' third straight win, as
they had downed the freshmen and
seniors in previously played contests.
Another title was at stake yester
day afternoon and was handily cap
tured by the juniors. The forfeit en
abled the third-year men to hang up
their third loss, and cinched for them
the cellar championship of the inter
class series.
The last game of the series will be
played tomorrow afternoon on the
frosh diamond between the seniors
and the freshmen. The two teams will
be fighting it out for second place in
the league standings.
