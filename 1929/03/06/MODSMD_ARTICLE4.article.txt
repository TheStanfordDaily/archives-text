# OLYMPIC CLUB ADDS STARS; IS READY FOR CARD TRACKSTERS
## Former Stanford Track Stars To Compete Against Alma Mater Saturday 
### 
Coach Charlie Hunter is adding
more and more stars to his 1929
Olympic Club track and field team
which meets Dink Templeton's
charges in the Stanford Stadium next
Saturday afternoon; and, if the club
men have been doing any training at
all, the Card-Olympic encounter will
be something out of the ordinary as
an opening season dual meet.
If Bud Spencer, world's 400-meter
champion, and Earl Fuller, American
SOO-meter entry in the 1928 Olympic
Games, run for the Club, the Winged
"O" team will be strong on the track
as well as in the field. Russ Sweet,
who won the century in 9 4-5 and the
furlong in 21 3-5 against Stanford last
year, and Les Gray, Stockton High
graduate, will represent the Club in
the sprints; Bill Storie, Jeffries, Blink
Williamson, and perhaps Spencer in
the quarter; and Tom McGuire and
Art Holman in the half-mile. In the
mile, Ray Brack, San Benito Jr. Col
lege graduate, will be Hunter's best
bet in the mile, and the veteran, Bert
Tooper, in the eight-lap event.
In the hurdles Hunter has a wealth
of material â€”Clarence West, who was
a double winner against the Club last
year; Jess Hawley, formerly of San
Jose State; Jack Bullis, Card letter
man last year; and "Skinny" John
son, California graduate. It is possible
that "Swede" Leistner will again com
pete for the Olympic Club. Against
these men Templeton will send Cap
tain Ros Nichols, 1.C.4-A. champion;
Ward Edmonds, of pole vaulting
fame; "Podge" Smith, promising
sophomore; and Don Nelson of last
year's varsity.
