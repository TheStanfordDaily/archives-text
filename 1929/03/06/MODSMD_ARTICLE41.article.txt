# Spanish King Gives Bell For Santa Clara Chapel
## 
### 
SANTA CLARA, March 5. (P.I.P.)â€”
King Alfonso XIII of Spain will send
to the Mission Chapel at Santa Clara
University, a massive bell to replace
the one given by King Charles IV to
the early mission more than a cen
tury and a half ago and lost in the
fire that destroyed the mission in
1926.
The original bell was one of three
bronzes donated by Charles IV in
1798, with the request that they be
tolled nightly at 8:30 to remind the
faithful to pray for the souls in pur
gatory.
