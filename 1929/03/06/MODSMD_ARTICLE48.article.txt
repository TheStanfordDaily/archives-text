# GRAF ZEPPELIN TO MAKE MEDITERRANEAN CRUISE
## 
### 

The dirigible Graf Zeppelin probably will start its Mediterranean cruise March 26. The itinerary
calls for a journey over France and down the Rhone to the Mediterranean and eastward over Corsica,
Rome and Athens to Asia Minor. From that point the route follows the coastline to Africa and west
ward to Tunis.
