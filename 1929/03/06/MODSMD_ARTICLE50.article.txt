HAND-WRITING ON THE WALL
Stanford's freshman track team
took an unexpected victory over the
i Southern California All-Stars last Sat
| ui day. The pessimistic gloom that has
prevailed over Encina gym was some
| what lifted.
Despite this victory Stanford
coaches and followers of freshman
| track are far from rejoicing over the
! prospects of a championship year.
This can be said of football as well.
{ The outlook is still dismal.
It is rather peculiar, however, that
freshman athletics should slump just
I at this time, particularly as it is the
year when the abolition of the Lower
i Division policy was actually inaugu
[ rated. Only 350 freshmen were admit-
I ted this year, cutting the frosh male
population by 150 from its previous
number.
Now much speculation has been
made regarding the effect of aboli
tion of the Lower Division on ath
letics. It is still debatable, but having
taken Citizenship we cannot ignore
the facts, and the facts are that fresh
man athletics this year have not been
on a par with those when 500 fresh
men were admitted each year.
It appears to always have been a
mad scramble to get admitted to
Stanford. And with that number
: shrunk to 350 the scrambling is made
just that much harder. This year 150
more young men had to seek alma
i maters elsewhere. Among those 150
were some athletes who could have
further enhanced the glory of the
! Cardinals, so the athletic ally-minded
i people believe. By trimming down the
number of entering freshmen, the
standard was raised, raised just
; enough to exclude some possible ath
; letic material.
Bearing this in mind it might be a
I strange coincidence that the fresh
man material should take a slumr
with the first step of Hie abplltior
policy. Or it may he the handwriting
I on the wall. At any rate, if this year't
history repeats itself, Stanford's fa
lnouw varsities have some lean years
ahead of them. And Stanford's varsi
i ties are a profitable source of reve
nue.
Speaking of lean years, it might b<
well to remember that Aesop told hi
; | dog, "Don't bito the hand that's feed
' 1 ing you." —Merle Emry.
• : Americans in Rome refer to Mussn
lini as "Mr. Jones" to escape beinj
I thought plotters by the Italians.

It is rather peculiar, however, that
freshman athletics should slump just
I at this time, particularly as it is the
year when the abolition of the Lower

[ rated. Only 350 freshmen were admit-

population by 150 from its previous
number.
Now much speculation has been
made regarding the effect of aboli
tion of the Lower Division on ath
letics. It is still debatable, but having
taken Citizenship we cannot ignore
the facts, and the facts are that fresh
man athletics this year have not been
on a par with those when 500 fresh
men were admitted each year.
It appears to always have been a
mad scramble to get admitted to
Stanford. And with that number
: shrunk to 350 the scrambling is made
just that much harder. This year 150
more young men had to seek alma
i maters elsewhere. Among those 150
were some athletes who could have
further enhanced the glory of the
! Cardinals, so the athletic ally-minded
i people believe. By trimming down the
number of entering freshmen, the
standard was raised, raised just
; enough to exclude some possible ath
; letic material.
Bearing this in mind it might be a
I strange coincidence that the fresh
man material should take a slumr
with the first step of Hie abplltior
policy. Or it may he the handwriting
I on the wall. At any rate, if this year't
history repeats itself, Stanford's fa
lnouw varsities have some lean years
ahead of them. And Stanford's varsi
i ties are a profitable source of reve
