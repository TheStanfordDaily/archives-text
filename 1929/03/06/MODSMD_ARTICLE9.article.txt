# EUROPEAN CONDITIONS IMPROVED BY LEAGUE OF NATIONS' EFFORTS
## 
### 
"Europe has changed, and I believe
i I am. justified in saying that this
| change has been brought about large
ly by the League of Nations," de
clared Sir Herbert Ames, former
financial director of the League, in
his lecture last night in the Assembly
Hall on "The Changing Spirit of Eu
rope."
Sir Herbert considered the Treaties
of Locarno of outstanding importance,
ias there the three nations, Great
; Britain, Germany, and France, came
1 together with the aim of mutual se-
I curity through compromise. These 1
' pacts also hastened the consideration j
of a seat in the League for Germany.
In 1920, the sentiment had been :
against her, but in the next few years
the attitude changed.
"The change in the attitude of the
nations toward each other is marked.
Previous to 1918, each nation viewed
the other with distrust and treaties
were always made with reservations j
as each nation considered only its j
own interests. Now treaties are hon- j
est efforts at mutual aid and security, i
with the purpose of settlement of all
disputes by arbitration.
Sir Herbert concluded with an ap
peal to America to reconsider her
stand on the question of the League.
"Europe has changed. The League is
a school where nations are brought
! together in discipline and harmony, j
! Conditions are now different from the j
i time when you made your decision."
