# HOOVER PASSES BUSY FIRST DAY IN PRESIDENCY
## Chief Executive Swings Into Stride of Office Quickly, Considering Many Affairs Discusses Special Session of Congress With Tilson; To Be Called April 15--Rumor 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 6. —
Swinging quickly into the stride of
the presidency, Herbert Hoover today
gave his attention to the revolt in
Mexico, the special session of the
new Congress, general law enforce
ment, patronage, and other questions.
In addition he found time to receive
delegations from Arkansas and Loui
siana and 31 temperance and dry or
ganizations of the country, and to
shake hands with more than 800 visi
tors who filed through his office in a
steady stream from the noon hour
until 2:45 p.m.
Secretary Kellogg called at the
executive offices several times dur
ing the day with the latest reports
from Mexico and there was no doubt
of the deep interest of the Administra
tion over the situation in the neigh
boring republic.
Without a final decision being
reached, the President discussed the
date for beginning the special session
of Congress with Representative Til
son of Connecticut, the Republican
leader of the House, and other mem
bers of Congress. Present indications
are that Congress will be assembled
on April 15, with the House proceed
ing at once with consideration of farm
relief.
Senator Sackett of Kentucky and
some other callers expressed appre
hension concerning the ultimate
length of the special session. The
Kentuckian asserted that it was pos
sible for the Senate to go ahead with
general legislation, such as railroad
consolidation, at the extra session
with a view to having these measures
ready for House action at the regular
session beginning in December.
"From my talks with a number of
Senators, I believe they will under
take to do this," Senator Sackett said.
"The President and the constituted
leaders want the special session con
fined to farm relief, tariff revision,
and the reapportionment of the House
membership in accord with the 1930
census."
