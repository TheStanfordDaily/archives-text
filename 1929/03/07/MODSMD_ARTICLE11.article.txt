## 
### 
The Old Boy sincerely be
lieves that the Parody Number
of Chaparral, which goes on sale
today, is one of his greatest
brainstorms.
Ted Krough has created one
of the cleverest covers which
has ever been featured on any
periodical. Not content with a
bigger and better cover, the Old
I?oy has conceived a New Yorker
which will surprise even the
ni9st casual of New Yorkers. He
has also out-Americaned the
American Magazine to obtain a
most amazing story of the life
of Mr. G. Geographua McSnight
—the world's most deformed
human.
The Venerable One has fur
thermore obtained a scoop on
the greatest mystery of all time
—twenty twisted bodies are
found in a baby buggy. At the
risk of his life, he has journeyed
into darkest Hollywood to force
an untold tale from Qreta
Goober.
