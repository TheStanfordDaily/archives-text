# "ERA OF COMMON SENSE" DAWNING IN RUSSIA---PARES
## 
### 
"Russia is on the eve of an 'Era of |
Common Sense'," Sir Herbert Pares,
famous English analyst of Slavonic
politics, predicted in a lecture on !
"Contemporary Russia" given last
night in the Assembly Hall.
"The next chapter in Russian his
tory will necessarily be one of eco-!
nomic advancement and technical re- j
construction. Russia will not break ;
up. Federation is the only principle
that will solve Russia's gigantic prob- 1
lein. Co-operation, free union of inde
pendent individual wills, is the great
hope for Russia's future prosperity.
"Russia, through Siberia, will come
to California for financial aid in the j
reconstruction period that must soon
commence," the lecturer divined. !
"Russia has considerable need for for- j
eign financial aid." Outside capital is
necessary before Russia can re-estab- j
liuli her former position, it is thought 1
by Sir Hubert.
"The Communists controlled poli- i
tics by murdering all who harbored ;
different political beliefs. But after
they had killed all their enemies, they i
suddenly found that certain Commu- j
nistic theories were all wrong. It was j

i disconcerting, very disconcerting.
"Empress Alexandria and Rasputin !
made the Russian Revolution inevit- l
I able. Although the Empress was a ■
moral woman and a true patriot, she I
disliked her husband and had great i
faith in Rasputin. Her inclinations to- i
ward mysticism and spiritualism j
brought her under the sway of Ras- '
putin. Rasputin controlled every de- j
tail of the Czaristic government from \
1y 15 to 1916. Rasputin loathed the j
Russian Dumas because it publicly
debated the story of his seventy se
ductions and other scandalous inci
dents of his life. It is not to be won
j dered, then, that this unscrupulous
priest made use of all the power he J
j could gain.
"Rasputin demanded that even mili
tary orders to the front pass through
j his hands so Tie could pray for Rus
| siun success —and he was usually
j drunk and cavorting with gypsy girls |
when such orders arrived. Is it a won- |
i der, then, that the Russian army was j
I entirely wiped out three times and
3,800,000 men were lost in the first
j ten months of war when such a man
'was at the head of the government?"
