# OLYMPIC FIELD MEN STRONG; CLUB MEETS STANFORD SATURDAY
## Biff Hoffman, Kim Dyer, Bob King Will Compete For Winged "0" Team 
### 
Eric Krenz and his teammates in
the field events are booked for a busy
afternoon next Saturday when Stan
ford engages in its first track compe
tition of the year in a dual meet with
the Olympic Club in the Stadium.
The Cards, whose strength in the
field is becoming a tradition in the
Pacific Coast and national track cir
cles, will have to exert themselves in
a most strenuous fashion to score
their share of the Stanford points
against the Winged "O" men.
Opposing Krenz and Harlow Roth
ert, lately of the American Olympic
team, in the shot will be Martin Or
loff and Biff Hoffman. Orloff and Hoff
man have both done close to 50 ft.,
while Krenz and Rothert have ex
ceeded this mark. A1 Forster, a con
sistent 46- to 47-foot performer, may
take some points for Stanford in this
event.
Jim Corson, of the Club, also a
member of the 1928 American Olym
pic team, and Krenz, each capable of
a world's record performance, meet
in the discus and may be expected to
toss said discus to all parts of the
Stadium.
Bob King, 1.C.4-A. and Olympic
Games champion, will have things
pretty much his own way in the high
jump, and five points at the least are
conceded the Club in this event. Cog
geshall, former U.S.C. high-jumper,
now with the Olympics, will probably
be able to take second place from
Dick French, Austin, and Madison of
Stanford.
| The broad jump should be one of
| the features of the meet with Kim
Dyer opposing his former teammates,
| Fred Zombro and Virgil Dowell, and
1 Arnold West, promising sophomore.
, All four of these men have bettered
j twenty-three feet this season. George
! Matin and Kelly will be the other
Club broad-jump entries.
