# JUNIOR-SENIOR GAME IS LAST OF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL SEASON
## 
### 
Women's basketball season ends
this afternoon when the Junior-Senior
contest is played at 4:30 o'clock. The
strength shown by the '29 team thus
far in the season gives it an edge in
the game today.
Yesterday the freshman team won
a closely fought victory over the '31
women. This put the freshmen at the
head of the list in victories, as it has
won five out of six games.
The seniors have come out victori
ous in four out of five contests, so
ihat. a victory today will tie them with
the freshmen. In the case of such a
tie, there will be a play-off, according
to the ruling made by the W.A.A.
Board last Tuesday night.
