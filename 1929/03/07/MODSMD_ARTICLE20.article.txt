# Hang the Murder!
## 
### 
This matter of hanging. It was quite the vogue at one time, when
the eye for an eye copy-book rule held, to hang indisciiminately. Ihere
was hanging for trespass, for petty larceny, for poaching, and even those
members of the light fingered gentry who were caught filching milady's
purse were hanged with flourish in the public square beside the respect
able murderers. Came a sudden modification of public sentiment and the
death penalty was taken from all offenses but murder.
All the time honored arguments against capital punishments have
been quoted and requoted. It is pointed out that capital punishment is not
a deterrent. Murder has not increased in states not having capital pun
ishment, and in the bloody days of old hngland when e\ei\ crimc was
dealt with with a noose and worse methods of killing, crime increased.
Then there's that matter of revenge and desire for retribution. But all
these things have been said.
At present there is before the state legislature the Fellom-Quigley
bills which provide for the immediate abolishment of capital punishment.
Michigan, Maine, Rhode Island, Wisconsin, North Dakota, Minnesota
and South Dakota, all have outlawed the death penalty. None have suf
fered any sudden crime wave. The change has been successful.
Here is an opportunity for California to live up to its reputation of
being a forward moving state. Ihe character of the state has been ex
tolled throughout the world, much to some of the worlds disgust. Here
is a great chance to prove to the world that besides climate and hot air,
California has foresighted and advanced treatment of its criminals.
So deeply branded in human nature is the desire for revenge and
retribution that capital punishment still has a strong hold on a sizeable
majority. The interest is in hanging the murder. What of crime itself.
Were more effort put to curb crime by scientific study and the expendi
ture of funds and energy to correct the conditions causing crime, the
need for drastic punishment would decrease in direct proportion. Don t
hang the murderer. Ilang the murder.
