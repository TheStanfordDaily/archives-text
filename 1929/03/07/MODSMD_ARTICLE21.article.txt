"Constant circulation of 'jokes' and pictures, portraying college boys
and girls as hard drinkers, tough swearers and all-night gadabouts
dressed, apparently, for appearance in a circus parade doesn't give the
public any confidence that the huge amounts it spends for education are
well spent." This opinion is expressed in an editorial in the San Fran
cisco News.
The News includes in its criticism of the college comics, publications
put out by firms unattached to universities as well as those put out by
students. Undoubtedly a false representation of college life has been
made by the outside publications, nor are the college magazines beyond
censure themselves, yet in most college papers it is believed that the
efifort of the editors is to caricature and poke fun at their fellow students,
not to misrepresent.
The objection is fair enough, students are misrepresented time and
again, and they do little to counter the false witness; yet perhaps the out
sider sees caricature as an attempt at realistic portrayal. The News in
its editorial said, "For their own good the university students should try
to make the picture more life-like." From this it would follow that per
haps the writer of that editorial believes that comics should be realistic
and that he does not understand caricature. Were the editors to take his
advice they would defeat their own end, pictured satire.
The funny pictures and jokes in student publications and professional
as well, do less harm than the stories in various magazines that throw a
romantic haze of impossible unreality over campus life. Ix*t the jokesters
joke.
