# Just a Mere Riot
## 
### 
Basketball, inoffensive sport that it is, was indirect cause of broken
crowns, cracked shins, "busted" noses, and the sending in of the riot
call at Ann Arbor, sedate eastern college town, where the students neither
act "collegiate" nor are filled with the desire to be Joe College like the
wild western institutions. Some twenty-five hundred of these quiet, con
servative easterners, having licked a dread opponent in basketball, roared
through the town, charged a theatre's doors, were repulsed, tore for an
other theatre, and finally after some rough and tumble slap-stick comedy
antics with the local gendarmes were dispersed.
Now of course in Palo Alto and Berkeley and others of these un
lettered western university towns, such an incident as this is a mere
nothing. They do it nightly. A slight riot of twenty-five hundred is a
small fire-cracker on Fourth of July. The westerners riot nightly, tear
up whole towns, bowl over trees, knock down buildings, and shoot each
other up. Ah, those effete easterners.

That more or less browbeaten institution of college traditions comes
to the fore again. U.S.C. underlines editorially her dozen local customs,
while Washington adopts a required freshman course on University
history and traditions.
