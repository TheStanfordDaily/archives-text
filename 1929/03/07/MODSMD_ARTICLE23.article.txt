Escape. By John Galsworthy. The
Geary Theatre.
A flawless cast, with a fascinating
English tang, is presenting "Escape"
for only two weeks at the Geary Thea
tre. I can't recommend it too highly.
In*the proper sense of the word,
this is not a play; it is called "an
episodic play in a prologue and nine
scenes" by the author, who says it is
to be his last play. With a few sweep
ing strokes, like those of a master
painter, Galsworthy creates the whole
situation in a brief prologue. The fol
lowing nine scenes cover a period of
58 hours. Each scene is a fragment
carved out of the lives of the people
with whom Captain Denant comes in
contact in his attempt to escape.
The cast is so uniformly good, and
the acting so smooth that you are
hardly conscious that it is acting.
As the bald-headed business man in
front of me said to his wife, "This is
a good play, only they're not acting."
Because of this naturalness, the audi
ence is carried along as though it
were watching real life, instead of a
"stage play."
Galsworthy, while he gives you rare
entertainment, at the same time plops
questions into your lap, presents situ
ations for you to solve, takes subtle
but sharp jabs at society, and, finally,
causes you to leave the theatre with
a head full of disturbing little
thoughts. For instance, it was the
inability to "escape from his decent
self" that made Matt Denant acci
dentally kill an officer in Hyde Park
to prevent him from taking a woman
"plying her trade" in the park off to
jail. And in the end, it was this same
inability to "escape from his decent
self" that made Denant give himself
up to authorities and go back to
prison.
We know nothing at all about Den
ant, except that in the Prologue he
sits on a bench and chats with a wo
man of the streets. A few minutes
later he attempts to prevent an of
ficer from arresting her, gets into a
fight, and knocks the officer down to
be killed by bumping his head. But
right from the start Denant has all
our sympathy. Then we see him rush
ing, trying to gain freedom after es
caping from prison, through a series
iof scenes. We love the people that
\ aid him, we hate those that don't.
The motives behind the different peo
i pie in what they do are often inex
\ plicable. Take the case of the two
old maids. One is a very religious
J soul and an ardent churchgoer, but
she is hard and cruel to Denant; her
I sister never goes to church, but she
is filled with the milk of human kind
ness, and aids him.
The last episode is in the vestry of
a village church. Denant gives him
self up to prevent a minister from
lying to save him.

What made the people help this'
fleeing prisoner? Galsworthy seems to
explain it by the presence of a little |
of the "original sin" in all of us. Or
is it a sense justice deeper than law; !
or merely a sporting sympathy with
the pursued?
Captain Denant is the only charac
ter to go through the whole play, and
Vernon Steele gives an admirable
performance. He is very good looking,!
has a mellow, pleasing voice, a capti- i
vating smile, and a good, clean-cut
diction. At the first he is buoyant, |
light-hearted, sporting; but as he
nears the end of his rope and is both
mentally and physically worn out, he ;
gradually loses his light step, resigns ;
himself to the inevitable clutches of
fate. Steele performs in a way that
shows a rich understanding of the |
part he portrays.

Peder Victorious. By O. E. Rolvaag.
New York: Harper an dßhotrers,
1929.) $2.50.
"Giants in the Earth" is a mighty,
moving book. It is a novel by a Nor
wegian immigrant of Norwegian im
migrants. It expresses a fine, proud
love, tells of the lonely struggle of
pioneers to conquer land. Now comes
"Peder Victorious," a story in which
the same author tells of the sons and
daughters of the pioneers.
Peder Victorious is the son of one ]
of the giants. He has his father's
pioneer strength and a dominant
youthful vigor, although less of the
Titan glamour of the first generation
surrounds him. The new book pic
tures instead of the struggle of giants
a conflict between two strong and
human personalities. The author
draws a fine, sensitive contrast be
| tween Beret, Norwegian immigrant of
i the first generation, and her son,
i Peder.
The amalgamation of races and re
: ligions is always a painful thing. In
| evitably the mother is reluctant to ac
| cept new customs, new races, new
language. Peder eagerly assimilates
1 the new environment. The tragic cri
sis is reached when Beret learns of
I Peder's love for the daughter of an
j Irish neighbor. She had dreaded the
| mixing of Norwegian Lutheran and
1 Irish Catholic. Her furious resentment
I
lis terrific, her tragic capitulation
i splendid.
"Peder Victorious" is more than a
mere "problem novel." It is an in
! tensely human document, a story of
i the upbuilding of the Middle West.
, Its loving portrayal of the broadening
j development of an admirable people
in a new country is unmixed with any
I trace of sentimentality.
The great theme of "Giants in the
i Earth" is carried on in a book which
will be long remembered, which
' should, indeed, find a lasting place in
American literature. —R. R. B.

Peder Victorious. By O. E. Rolvaag.
New York: Harper an dßhotrers,
1929.) $2.50.
"Giants in the Earth" is a mighty,
moving book. It is a novel by a Nor
wegian immigrant of Norwegian im
migrants. It expresses a fine, proud
love, tells of the lonely struggle of
pioneers to conquer land. Now comes
"Peder Victorious," a story in which
the same author tells of the sons and
daughters of the pioneers.
Peder Victorious is the son of one ]
of the giants. He has his father's
pioneer strength and a dominant
youthful vigor, although less of the
Titan glamour of the first generation
surrounds him. The new book pic
tures instead of the struggle of giants
a conflict between two strong and
human personalities. The author
draws a fine, sensitive contrast be
| tween Beret, Norwegian immigrant of
i the first generation, and her son,
i Peder.
The amalgamation of races and re
: ligions is always a painful thing. In
| evitably the mother is reluctant to ac
| cept new customs, new races, new
language. Peder eagerly assimilates
1 the new environment. The tragic cri
sis is reached when Beret learns of
I Peder's love for the daughter of an
j Irish neighbor. She had dreaded the
| mixing of Norwegian Lutheran and
1 Irish Catholic. Her furious resentment
I
lis terrific, her tragic capitulation
i splendid.
"Peder Victorious" is more than a
mere "problem novel." It is an in
! tensely human document, a story of
i the upbuilding of the Middle West.
, Its loving portrayal of the broadening
j development of an admirable people
in a new country is unmixed with any
I trace of sentimentality.
The great theme of "Giants in the
i Earth" is carried on in a book which
will be long remembered, which
' should, indeed, find a lasting place in
American literature. —R. R. B.
Escape. By John Galsworthy. The
Geary Theatre.
A flawless cast, with a fascinating
English tang, is presenting "Escape"
for only two weeks at the Geary Thea
tre. I can't recommend it too highly.
In*the proper sense of the word,
this is not a play; it is called "an
episodic play in a prologue and nine
scenes" by the author, who says it is
to be his last play. With a few sweep
ing strokes, like those of a master
painter, Galsworthy creates the whole
situation in a brief prologue. The fol
lowing nine scenes cover a period of
58 hours. Each scene is a fragment
carved out of the lives of the people
with whom Captain Denant comes in
contact in his attempt to escape.
The cast is so uniformly good, and
the acting so smooth that you are
hardly conscious that it is acting.
As the bald-headed business man in
front of me said to his wife, "This is
a good play, only they're not acting."
Because of this naturalness, the audi
ence is carried along as though it
were watching real life, instead of a
"stage play."
Galsworthy, while he gives you rare
entertainment, at the same time plops
questions into your lap, presents situ
ations for you to solve, takes subtle
but sharp jabs at society, and, finally,
causes you to leave the theatre with
a head full of disturbing little
thoughts. For instance, it was the
inability to "escape from his decent
self" that made Matt Denant acci
dentally kill an officer in Hyde Park
to prevent him from taking a woman
"plying her trade" in the park off to
jail. And in the end, it was this same
inability to "escape from his decent
self" that made Denant give himself
up to authorities and go back to
prison.
We know nothing at all about Den
ant, except that in the Prologue he
sits on a bench and chats with a wo
man of the streets. A few minutes
later he attempts to prevent an of
ficer from arresting her, gets into a
fight, and knocks the officer down to
be killed by bumping his head. But
right from the start Denant has all
our sympathy. Then we see him rush
ing, trying to gain freedom after es
caping from prison, through a series
iof scenes. We love the people that
\ aid him, we hate those that don't.
The motives behind the different peo
i pie in what they do are often inex
\ plicable. Take the case of the two
old maids. One is a very religious
J soul and an ardent churchgoer, but
she is hard and cruel to Denant; her
I sister never goes to church, but she
is filled with the milk of human kind
ness, and aids him.

Escape. By John Galsworthy. The
Geary Theatre.
A flawless cast, with a fascinating
English tang, is presenting "Escape"
for only two weeks at the Geary Thea
tre. I can't recommend it too highly.
In*the proper sense of the word,
this is not a play; it is called "an
episodic play in a prologue and nine
scenes" by the author, who says it is
to be his last play. With a few sweep
ing strokes, like those of a master
painter, Galsworthy creates the whole
situation in a brief prologue. The fol
lowing nine scenes cover a period of
58 hours. Each scene is a fragment
carved out of the lives of the people
with whom Captain Denant comes in
contact in his attempt to escape.
The cast is so uniformly good, and
the acting so smooth that you are
hardly conscious that it is acting.
As the bald-headed business man in
front of me said to his wife, "This is
a good play, only they're not acting."
Because of this naturalness, the audi
ence is carried along as though it
were watching real life, instead of a
"stage play."
Galsworthy, while he gives you rare
entertainment, at the same time plops
questions into your lap, presents situ
ations for you to solve, takes subtle
but sharp jabs at society, and, finally,
causes you to leave the theatre with
a head full of disturbing little
thoughts. For instance, it was the
inability to "escape from his decent
self" that made Matt Denant acci
dentally kill an officer in Hyde Park
to prevent him from taking a woman
"plying her trade" in the park off to
jail. And in the end, it was this same
inability to "escape from his decent
self" that made Denant give himself
up to authorities and go back to
prison.
We know nothing at all about Den
ant, except that in the Prologue he
sits on a bench and chats with a wo
man of the streets. A few minutes
later he attempts to prevent an of
ficer from arresting her, gets into a
fight, and knocks the officer down to
be killed by bumping his head. But
right from the start Denant has all
our sympathy. Then we see him rush
ing, trying to gain freedom after es
caping from prison, through a series
iof scenes. We love the people that
\ aid him, we hate those that don't.
The motives behind the different peo
i pie in what they do are often inex
\ plicable. Take the case of the two
old maids. One is a very religious
J soul and an ardent churchgoer, but
she is hard and cruel to Denant; her
I sister never goes to church, but she
is filled with the milk of human kind
ness, and aids him.
The last episode is in the vestry of
a village church. Denant gives him
self up to prevent a minister from
lying to save him.

What made the people help this'
fleeing prisoner? Galsworthy seems to
explain it by the presence of a little |
of the "original sin" in all of us. Or
is it a sense justice deeper than law; !
or merely a sporting sympathy with
the pursued?
Captain Denant is the only charac
ter to go through the whole play, and
Vernon Steele gives an admirable
performance. He is very good looking,!
has a mellow, pleasing voice, a capti- i
vating smile, and a good, clean-cut
diction. At the first he is buoyant, |
light-hearted, sporting; but as he
nears the end of his rope and is both
mentally and physically worn out, he ;
gradually loses his light step, resigns ;
himself to the inevitable clutches of
fate. Steele performs in a way that
shows a rich understanding of the |
part he portrays.

"Giants in the Earth" is a mighty,
moving book. It is a novel by a Nor
wegian immigrant of Norwegian im
migrants. It expresses a fine, proud
love, tells of the lonely struggle of
pioneers to conquer land. Now comes
"Peder Victorious," a story in which
the same author tells of the sons and
daughters of the pioneers.
Peder Victorious is the son of one ]
of the giants. He has his father's
pioneer strength and a dominant
youthful vigor, although less of the
Titan glamour of the first generation
surrounds him. The new book pic
tures instead of the struggle of giants
a conflict between two strong and
human personalities. The author
draws a fine, sensitive contrast be
| tween Beret, Norwegian immigrant of
i the first generation, and her son,
i Peder.
The amalgamation of races and re
: ligions is always a painful thing. In
| evitably the mother is reluctant to ac
| cept new customs, new races, new
language. Peder eagerly assimilates
1 the new environment. The tragic cri
sis is reached when Beret learns of
I Peder's love for the daughter of an
j Irish neighbor. She had dreaded the
| mixing of Norwegian Lutheran and
1 Irish Catholic. Her furious resentment
I
lis terrific, her tragic capitulation

right from the start Denant has all
our sympathy. Then we see him rush
ing, trying to gain freedom after es
caping from prison, through a series
iof scenes. We love the people that
\ aid him, we hate those that don't.
The motives behind the different peo
i pie in what they do are often inex
\ plicable. Take the case of the two
old maids. One is a very religious
J soul and an ardent churchgoer, but
she is hard and cruel to Denant; her
I sister never goes to church, but she
is filled with the milk of human kind
ness, and aids him.
The last episode is in the vestry of
a village church. Denant gives him
self up to prevent a minister from
lying to save him.

What made the people help this'
fleeing prisoner? Galsworthy seems to
explain it by the presence of a little |
of the "original sin" in all of us. Or
is it a sense justice deeper than law; !
or merely a sporting sympathy with
the pursued?
Captain Denant is the only charac
ter to go through the whole play, and
Vernon Steele gives an admirable
performance. He is very good looking,!
has a mellow, pleasing voice, a capti- i
vating smile, and a good, clean-cut
diction. At the first he is buoyant, |
light-hearted, sporting; but as he
nears the end of his rope and is both
mentally and physically worn out, he ;
gradually loses his light step, resigns ;
himself to the inevitable clutches of
fate. Steele performs in a way that
shows a rich understanding of the |
part he portrays.

Peder Victorious. By O. E. Rolvaag.
New York: Harper an dßhotrers,
1929.) $2.50.
"Giants in the Earth" is a mighty,
moving book. It is a novel by a Nor
wegian immigrant of Norwegian im
migrants. It expresses a fine, proud
love, tells of the lonely struggle of
pioneers to conquer land. Now comes
"Peder Victorious," a story in which
the same author tells of the sons and
daughters of the pioneers.
Peder Victorious is the son of one ]
of the giants. He has his father's
pioneer strength and a dominant
youthful vigor, although less of the
Titan glamour of the first generation
surrounds him. The new book pic
tures instead of the struggle of giants
a conflict between two strong and
human personalities. The author
draws a fine, sensitive contrast be
| tween Beret, Norwegian immigrant of
i the first generation, and her son,
i Peder.
The amalgamation of races and re
: ligions is always a painful thing. In
| evitably the mother is reluctant to ac
| cept new customs, new races, new
language. Peder eagerly assimilates
1 the new environment. The tragic cri
sis is reached when Beret learns of
I Peder's love for the daughter of an
j Irish neighbor. She had dreaded the
| mixing of Norwegian Lutheran and
1 Irish Catholic. Her furious resentment
I
lis terrific, her tragic capitulation
i splendid.
"Peder Victorious" is more than a
mere "problem novel." It is an in
! tensely human document, a story of
i the upbuilding of the Middle West.
, Its loving portrayal of the broadening
j development of an admirable people
in a new country is unmixed with any
I trace of sentimentality.
The great theme of "Giants in the
i Earth" is carried on in a book which
will be long remembered, which
' should, indeed, find a lasting place in
American literature. —R. R. B.
