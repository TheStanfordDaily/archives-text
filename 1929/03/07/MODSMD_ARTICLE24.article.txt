The Editor, Sir:
To a person visiting the Stanford
Campus, one thing, or rather the lack
of one tiling, must undoubtedly at
tract his attention. I refer to the ab
sence of the American flag in front of
any of our buildings, except on such
rare occasions as Washington's birth
day or a Presidential Inauguration.
We, as students appearing on the
campus every day, have become ac
customed to this indifferent attitude
and do not give the matter much
thought. But to our many visitors
who daily admire the beauties of the
Stanford Campus, the national em
blem must surely be conspicuous be

cause of its absence.
It is not that Stanford lacks na
tional patriotism. It is not that the
University lacks facilities for display- j
ing the national ensign, for there are
two stately flag poles in front of the
Administration Building, two in front
of Encina, and two in front of the
Gymnasium. Rather, it would appear
that we are somewhat careless or
neglectful in exhibiting our patriot
ism. Surely, it would not require much
time nor effort on the part of one of j
the ground-keepers to raise the flag
in the morning and lower it at night, j
at least on the flagstaffs in front of
the main facade.
