Yale seniors have provided the
country with annual laugh fest, vot
ing on the members of the class "Most
likely to succeed,," 1 "best dressed,"

been a cnse of eggs.
We rise to remark that it is these
sunbaths that make Sons of the Stan
ford Red.

lieve this headline from the De Pauw:
FIVE CONTESTS IN ROW
FACE OLD GOLD DEBATERS
Supposing someone in the audience j
should cough!
While we're on the headline situa
