# PROFESSOR E. G. REID STARTING SERIES OF PLANE TEST FLIGHTS
## Department of Aeronautics Gets New Speed Course Along Bay Shore 
### James Myers 
With the assistance of about a
dozen graduate students Elliot G.
Reid, Professor of Aerodynamics, is
Htarting today on a series of airplane
flight tests at the Palo Alto School
of Aviation and on a speed course
along the bay shore.
The Department of Aeronautics has
been fortunate in securing a two-mile
Hpeed course paralleling the railroad
from Dumbarton Bridge to Redwood
City. A timing device, prepared by an
electrical engineering student, will be
used on the course.
The Guggenheim fund is establish
ing flight testing stations at various
colleges and universities for the bene
fit of airplane manufacturers. Stations
will be established at Stanford, Wash
ington, Michigan, California Institute
of Technology, New York University,
and Massachusetts Institute of Tech
nology. This first work at Stanford is
preliminary training for the test work
to be carried on under the fund at a
later date.
The tests being started today are
not part of a course, but are being
carried out by the students who wish
to get a bird's eye view of flight test
ing. These tests are not so complete
and thorough as would be required by
the federal government, but are being
made at the present time to familiar
ize the students with flight testing
methods and possibly to develop sim
pler tests than are used now at some
of the stations.
Announcement has been made by
the aeronautics department that the
course in airplane design, given last
year in spring quarter, has been
changed this year to spread out over
the coming fall, winter, and spring
quarters. The change has been made
because the graduate students in the
department are here for a two-year
period, and because one quarter does
not provide a sufficient length of time
in which to design an airplane.
