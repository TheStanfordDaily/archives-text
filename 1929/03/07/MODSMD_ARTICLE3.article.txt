ers is a heady boxer and was at no

I time pressed by his opponent.

during the entire contest and traded j
I blow for blow. Waight won the bout j
when he landed a trio of knockout
punches in the closing period which i
staggered his opponent.
Experience won for Johnny Sano,
Card bantamweight, over Georgie |
Padillo. Neither man was able to con-!
| nect with many real blows, and they
! boxed three slow rounds which were j
well sprinkled with clinches.
Foster Vierra outpunched Milt j
Cohen, Cardinal middleweight, in a
! fast bout. Vierra is a shifty boxer with
[ a clever change of pace and a danger-
I ous right arm. Cohen was well-!
! guarded during the opening rounds
but was hit frequently in the third j
period.
The heavyweight match proved to i
i be a battle when Fred Voigt tangled j
with Benny Robinson. The big fellows |
mixed it up from the opening gong, j
! but Robinson outpunched Voigt to
