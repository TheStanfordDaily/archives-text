# JUDGE FINES PAIR OF PALM DRIVE SPEEDERS AFTER JURY DECISION
## 
### 
Trial by jury proved no more len- j
ient than the justice handed out by |
the Men's Council when two speeders j
on Palm Drive were sentenced yester- j
day to fines of $12 and $10 in a Palo
Alto court.
Lewis Hayd Leve, Palo Alto attor- ;
ney, made the mistake of passing an
intersection on Palm Drive at 42 miles
per hour, while M. P. Taylor, son of
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, speeded by the
intersection at 40 miles an hour. Both
were stopped by Traiffic Officer John J
Olsen, and both demanded jury trial,
claiming that the 15-mile limit was |
not enforceable since the intersec- i
tions are not obstructed.
The case came up Tuesday in the
court of Justice Isobel Charles of j
Palo Alto. The jury found both men
guilty of violating the traffic laws,
and yesterday afternoon Justice
Charles sentenced Leve and Taylor
to fines of $12 and $10 respectively.
Leve represented both himself and
Taylor in the court.
