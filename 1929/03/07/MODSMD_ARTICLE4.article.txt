# VARSITY, FRESHMAN WATERPOLO PLAYERS MEET CAL SATURDAY
## Both Card Teams Expected To Repeat Annual Win Over California 
### 
The varsity and freshman water
polo games with California Saturday
will be the last intercollegiate water
sports competition before the Minor
Sports Carnival, to be held April 5
and 6. Both Cardinal teams are fa
vored to repeat their victories of last
year. In 1928 the Bear varsity polo
squad sank to a 10-0 defeat, while the
babes went down under a 12-0 score.
Representing Stanford Saturday
will be the same varsity combination
which proved disastrous to North
western last month. The line-up is:
Captain Reggie Harrison, cf; Bob
Burns, If; Milt Burns, rf; Cal Strong,
cb; Ogden Driggs, lb; Tru Parker,
rb; and Nort Thornton, goal.
The freshmen present a strong team
which, although untried in intercolle
giate competition, is composed of
many of the freshman swimmers who
trimmed the California yearling swim
ming team last week. The frosh line
up is: Austin Clapp, cf; Captain
Frank Booth, If; Jack Pahl or John
Trotter, rf; Ward Woods, cb; Larry
Harris, lb; Don Slocum or Ricky Olm
sted, rb; Mack Linton or Felix Jiulah,
goal.
The varsity match will begin at 2
o'clock Saturday in the Athens Club
pool, Oakland. It will be followed by
the freshman contest.
