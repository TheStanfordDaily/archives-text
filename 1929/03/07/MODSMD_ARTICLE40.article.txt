### Leonard Bartlett 
News comes to the campus that Dr.
ltay Lyman Wilbur has assumed
| duties as Secretary of the Interior in
I President Hoover's cabinet. He was
| installed in office yesterday. The Stan
j ford president adds another venture
' to his long list of life accomplish
: ments.
Just how long Dr. Wilbur will be
gone from the campus is not known,
i but it is thought that he will not re
, sign the presidency of the University,
; for he has taken only a two years'
leave of absence.
As Dr. Wilbur steps into the active
j political field as a cabinet officer in
I the national government, he leaves
behind him the record of three de
cades of continuous, unremitting con
structive endeavor.
j Shortly after his graduation from
Stanford University, Wilbur took up
j the study of medicine at Cooper Medi-
I cal College in San Francisco, where
1 he was graduated with an M.D. degree
; in 1899. In the Class Book of '95, Dr.
I Wilbur tells of his marriage, "In the
meantime I had been able to con
| vince Marguerite Blake, '97, that it
would be wise and desirable for her
to marry me, which she did on Dec. 5,
| 1898."
Wilbur spent three years on the
j campus as Professor of Physiology
! and also as a practicing physician.
1 Following the typhoid epidemic in
! 1903, he went to Europe with his wife,
spending about a year in Frankfort

i on-the-Main, Vienna, and London.
! Upon his return to California he
| opened an office in Palo Alto, where
he practiced medicine until 1908 when
he again embarked for Europe. Two
years were spent studying in Munich,
Vienna, London, and later on in New
York.
Stanford University had taken over
the Cooper Medical College in San
Francisco, where he became Dean of
the Medical and Professor of Medi
cine. lie continued this work until
the latter part of 1915 when he was
elected president of Stanford Univer
! sity.
Dr. Wilbur has held so many im
portant offices and has been on so
many committees that he could not
probably recount them himself. Some
of them are the American Child
Health Association, the San Francisco
Community Chest, and the Rockefeller
I Foundation (trustee), American Medi
cal Association (president in 1923).
His war work as chief of the Con
servation Division, United States Food
i Administration, is known nationally.

Just how long Dr. Wilbur will be

; for he has taken only a two years'
leave of absence.

structive endeavor.
j Shortly after his graduation from
Stanford University, Wilbur took up
j the study of medicine at Cooper Medi-
I cal College in San Francisco, where
1 he was graduated with an M.D. degree
; in 1899. In the Class Book of '95, Dr.
I Wilbur tells of his marriage, "In the
meantime I had been able to con
| vince Marguerite Blake, '97, that it
would be wise and desirable for her
to marry me, which she did on Dec. 5,
| 1898."
Wilbur spent three years on the
j campus as Professor of Physiology
! and also as a practicing physician.
1 Following the typhoid epidemic in
! 1903, he went to Europe with his wife,
spending about a year in Frankfort

i on-the-Main, Vienna, and London.

| opened an office in Palo Alto, where
he practiced medicine until 1908 when
he again embarked for Europe. Two

Francisco, where he became Dean of
the Medical and Professor of Medi
cine. lie continued this work until
the latter part of 1915 when he was
elected president of Stanford Univer
! sity.
Dr. Wilbur has held so many im
portant offices and has been on so
many committees that he could not
probably recount them himself. Some
of them are the American Child
Health Association, the San Francisco
Community Chest, and the Rockefeller
I Foundation (trustee), American Medi
cal Association (president in 1923).
His war work as chief of the Con
