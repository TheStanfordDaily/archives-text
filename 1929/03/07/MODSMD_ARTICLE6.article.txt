# DANCE DRAMA WILL INCLUDE FIVE SOLOS IN VARIED PROGRAM
## Thirteen Numbers Prepared For Novel Production On Tuesday Night 
### 
Five solo dances will be included
: in the Divertissement section of the
' Dance Drama which will he pre-!
sented in the Assembly Hall next
Tuesday night. Thirteen dances will
make up the second part of the pro- j
: gram following the interpretation of
! Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.
Michael Angelo's "Bound Captive" i
| forms the theme of one of the solos.
To the music of Sibelius' "Finlandia"
i the strength and power of the statue
iis rhythmically revealed. Although
the captive is bound, the human figure
; loses none of its hope, and the move-'
S ments of the dance are organized to
bring out the hope and inspiration
j possible to the human spirit.
I "Three Shades of Blue" is another j
J solo in which many scarves of vari
| ous shades of blue will be used to
bring out the harmonic effects. The
I scarves will be of various shades of
, indigo, Alice blue, and heliotrope.
Modern lighting effects will bring out
| the different colors.
Rebikoff's "Les Demons s'Amusent,"
â–  a piece of modern music with its dis- 1
! regard of the natural scale, is used
i for a bit of impressionistic group j
dancing. The movements are angular
and abstract, and will possibly recall
Helvenston's "Ballet Mechanique" in
the last Football Show. The Hawaiian
legend of Pele forms the basis on
which a group dance interpreting the
rise and fire of the volcano is built.
Maxine Cushing, Elizabeth Ann
Lynch, Annie Lou Carmichael, Eliza
beth Doyle, and Edyth Allen will give
the solo numbers of the program.
