these two models, as one is done in
the semi-permanent, expressionistic
manner and the other is executed with
a permanent, realistic setting.
Other plays which will receive !
recognition in the exhibition are
James Elroy Flecker's "Hassan," of
which there will be a model, Lord
Dunsany's "If," shown by a series of
water colors, two different versions

miniature lighting system, correspond
ing in every detail to that used on
the professional stage, will figure
among the exhibits which Harold Hel
venston will have on display in the
Little Theatre at 8 o'clock Monday
night. The exhibition will be made up
of sketches and small models of stage
settings which are the work of Hel
venston's class in scenic design. Many
of these complete models of modern
stage productions will be lighted in
miniature.
Among these plays which have been
depicted by the members of the class
are Ibsen's "Peer Gynt," which is il
lustrated by more than a score of
drawings in water color, and George
Bernard Shaw's "St. Joan," which is
portrayed by several pencil sketches.
Shakespeare's plays figure prominent
ly with drawings for "Coriolanus" and
"Richard III," as well as two versions
of "Hamlet," both of which will be

shown by models. Helvenston says i
that it will be interesting to compare
these two models, as one is done in
the semi-permanent, expressionistic
manner and the other is executed with
a permanent, realistic setting.
Other plays which will receive !
recognition in the exhibition are
James Elroy Flecker's "Hassan," of
which there will be a model, Lord
Dunsany's "If," shown by a series of
water colors, two different versions
of Stephen Phillips' "Ulysses," as well :
os Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra"
and "The Rhinegold," Wagner's first
opera.
Helvenston says that this is the
first time a class in scenic design
has held such an exhibition here, and
that the sketches and models show
the new point of view in stage set
tings. He hopes that this display will
mark the nucleus of a group at Stan
ford for experiments in dramatic pro
ductions, and plans to try out all fu
ture campus plays in miniature bo
fore working on the real scenery.
