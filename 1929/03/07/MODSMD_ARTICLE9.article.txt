# GERMAN, BRITISH MINISTERS TALK ON PEACE PACTS
## League Hears Argument on Possible Revision of Recent Treaties 
### 
GENEVA, March 6. (/P) â€”Possibility
of the revision of peace treaties
raised by German Foreign Minister
Stresemann before the League Coun
cil today caused a brisk tilt between
Herr Stresemann and British Foreign
Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain,
and gave a big crowd of visitors some
thing to talk about.
In demanding better protection for
minority peoples, Herr Stresemann
had remarked that the present cen
tury state of affairs was not neces
sarily durable. Then alluding to Arti
cle 19 which provides for treaty re
visions, he said that "this idea is
clearly expressed in the League cove
nant."
Sir Austen regretted this allusion,
saying that he was convinced Article
19 in connection with the minority
problem could only make trouble be
cause it was not germane to the mi
norities question.
Stresemann replied that if the Brit
ish Foreign Minister had read the
text of the Stresemann speech care
fully, he would have seen that the
allusion to the non-eternity of things
and to the contents of the covenant
had been followed immediately by a
statement that all this had nothing
to do with minority questions.
Nevertheless the public generally
seemed interested that Herr Strese
mann had in fact incorporated in his
address an allusion to the treaty re
vision article.
After serried discussion in which
many Council members, including
French Foreign Minister Briand, par
ticipated, the Council adjourned until
Thursday morning.
