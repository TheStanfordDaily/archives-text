■ ROB ABLY no single spot in this country is more widely
IB than West Point, where our future army commanders
JJ[_ receive their education and training in the arts of war.
As an army post in the Revolution, West Point's fortifications
were the works that Benedict Arnold attempted to deliver into the
hands of the British. Later the United States Military Academy
was established and is now composed of magnificent buildings, parade
grounds and athletic fields.
It is a source of pride to the Otis organization that most of
the famous buildings of the world are equipped with Otis Elevators
and West Point is no exception to this rule; five Otis Elevators are
installed in various buildings of the Academy.
Throughout the world, in far-off places and at home in
familiar surroundings, we find that people everywhere depend upon I
Otis for safe, speedy Vertical Transportation.
