Cuts Clean as a Pair of Shears
A real grass-cutter — that's the Johnston All-Steel Lawn
Mower. It leaves your lawn in perfect trim.
Crucible steel blades working against a die-steel bed knife
give the Johnston its wonderful cutting ability. It never bites or
tears off the grass. Every grass blade is sheared off as clean as you
would clip a piece of paper.
You need not be a mechanic to keep the Johnston in per
fect working order. The blades are self-sharpening, always keen.
y — rj.n«nn» The bed-knife can be quickly raised or lowered.
| Play in the blade reel is eliminated by a simple cone
adjustment.
