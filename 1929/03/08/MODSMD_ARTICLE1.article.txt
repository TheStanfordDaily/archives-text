## Re-enforcements Enter Vera Cruz, Capture City From Hands of Revolting Army Juarez New Scene of Fight; Americans Seek Safety by Crossing Border to Texas 
### 
NEW YORK, March 7. (/P)—'The
Mexican Consulate General here
this evening reported receipt of
dispatches from President Portes
Gil announcing that the rebel
general, Jesus M. Aguirre, was
surrounded and that his capture
was expected. Re-enforcements
had entered Vera Cruz and con
solidated the government posi
tion.
VERA CRUZ, Mexico, March 7. (/P)
—This city, one of the chief prizes in
the suprise outbreak of the revolution
last Sunday, was back in the federal
fold tonight, re-establishing the short
est route from the Capital to the Gulf
of Mexico.
Colonel Jose Cervantes led loyal
troops against General Jesus M.
Aguirre, former military commandant
who had declared himself for the
revolution and attempted to enlist all
troops under his command.
The fleeing rebels from Cordoba
were reported to be hard-pressed.
They started first for the Isthmus of
Tehuantepec where sympathizers
earlier had been reported. They were
cut off, however, and at last reports
were being driven back toward their
enemies here.
EL PASO, Texas, March 7. (TP) —
Besieged by the rumbling waves of
revolt, Juarez, spectacular frontier
city of the Mexican border, tonight
was a battle front, with the forces of
the Gil government of Mexico and
revolutionary elements fighting for
the prize almost within a stone's
throw of the Rio Grande.
Americans in Juarez streamed over
the one road to El Paso in great num
bers today. The narrow street became
choked before noon by these refugees
when a stray shot fired somewhere in
the city flamed the rumors that the
city had been attacked. Automobiles
by the hundreds crowded the highway
while others made the trip on foot.
