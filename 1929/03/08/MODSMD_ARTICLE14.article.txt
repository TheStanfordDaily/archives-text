# CARDINAL FRESHMEN ENCOUNTER MODESTO TRACKMEN SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman track team will j
be given its second test of the season
Saturday morning when it meets the
I Modesto Junior College squad in the
I Old Oval.
The yearling's outfit will find a
! strong team under "Jumbo" Morris,
former Cardinal athlete. The San
Joaquin valley boys always have a
good team and they are expected to
give the baby Redshirts considerably |
more than a workout.
In the meet last year the 1931 team I
gave the Modesto team a set-back I
with an overwhelming defeat. The j
freshmen should be able to down their
! opponents if they are able to come j
through In the form that defeated the j
All-Star team last Saturday.
i Elwood, winner of both clashes last
j week, is favored to repeat in tomor
i row's meet. In the week's practice he
j turned in consistently good times. A 1
| fast trio will represent the yearlings
I in the 440. Hay, Nash, and Hables all
j ran the distance in the last meet
j under 52 seconds to finish one, two,
j three.
Doub, babe pole-vaulter, will be back
! in the meet. He was unable to com-
I pete last Saturday because of an in
jured ankle. The hurdles and mile
are the yearling's weakest events. In ;
the hurdles, Mendenhall is the only j
consistent man. He won the lows last
; week. In the mile there will be six
j Stanford entrants. None are able to
' do the four laps under 5 minutes.
