# CARDINAL TRACK TEAM TO FACE WINGED 'O' TOMORROW AT 2:30
## Poststreeters' Lineup Contains Six Olympic Games Veterans Including King and Spencer; Stanford Squad to Be Facing First 1929 Competition 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
Whether or not Coach Dink Templeton lias again developed a great track and
field team which will sweep through Pacific Coast and national collegiate competition
to a third consecutive 1.C.4-A. championship will be discovered when the Cards
clash with Coach Charlie Hunter's Olympic Club track men tomorrow afternoon in
the Stadium, beginning at 2 :30 o'clock.

Stanford should win; but victory, one
way or the other, will be decided only
after a spirited struggle in every one of
the fourteen events. With six members
of the 1928 American Olympic team com
peting, four for the club and two for
Stanford, together with a number of
present and former intercollegiate cham
pions, some remarkable early season per
formances should result.
Four in Games
The four Winged "O" athletes who
took part in the Olympic Games at Am
sterdam last summer are Bud Spencer,
world's 400-meter record holder; Bob
King, intercollegiate and Olympic high
' jump champion; Jim Corson, discus
j thrower; and Earl Fuller, half miler.
It is not definitely known if Spencer and
Fuller will run tomorrow. The two
members of the Cardinal team who com
peted at Amsterdam are Eric Krenz and
Harlow Rothert, Templeton's peerless
! weight men.
The opening event, the mile, will bring
| Alex McKinnon, Stanford four-lap man,
and Ray Brack of the club together.
Brack is reported to have done 4:30 re
cently, while McKinnon was timed at
4 :32 in practice early this week.
In the sprints Hec Dyer, John Laurit
zen, and Alan McDcrmott of the Cards
will match strides with Russ Sweet and
Les Gray of the Olympics. Sweet is
better than an even 'time man in both
! the century and the furlong, while John
i Lauritzen, and Hec Dyer, long-legged
j sophomore flash, have shown up well in
I practice.
440 a Feature
The 440-yard dash, even if Spencer
j doesn't run, should be the feature race
| of the day. Stanford is famous for her
j quarter-milers, and this year is no ex
| ception, Johnny Morrison being able to
!do :49 and better and Bob Syer and
I Maynor Shove running the single lap in
close to :50. Bill Storie, Olympic Club
captain and former Card star, is reported
I to be in better condition than ever before
and capable of 49-second performances.
Should Earl Fuller run lor the club 1
in the 880, there will he little question of
the outcome of this event. With Fuller
not competing, Neikirk, French, and
(jooden of the Cardinal team will he
fairly evenly matched with Tom Mc-'
Guire and Art Holman of the club.
Brown and Loofbourow are Temple- |
ton's Ik-st bets in the two-mile and will
he forced to their limit to beat Bert:
Hooper and Jack Keegan.
Clarence West and Jack Bullis, former!
Stanford atlilet«*s, and Jess I law ley, San !
Jose State's star, will represent the club i
in tiie high hurdles. Captain Ross Nich- !
ols, Ward Edmonds, and Podge Smith j
will be the redshirt entries. West and j
Skinny Johnson of the club and Nelson, ;
Nichols, and Smith of Stanford will
meet in the lows.
Hoffman with Club
'I he shot will bring Krenz, Rothert,
and Korstcr of the Cards and Orloflf and |
Biff Hoffman of the club together. Jim 1
Corson and Krenz, each capable of a |
world's record performance, should have!
a battle for first honors in the discus, j
Bob King, undefeated last year, is not I
i'i much danger of losing first place in I
tlie altitude test for the club. Edmonds.!
Card pole vaulter, is a cinch to win the
vault.
Kim Dyer of the club and Fred Zom-;
bro, Virgil Dowell, and Arnold West of,
the Cards will have a close time of it in
the broad jump. All have leaped beyond
the 23-foot mark this year.
Perelli-Minetti, Kibby, and Sparling, I
Stanford javelin throwers, who have all '
done 190 feet or better, will have to equal
this mark to win from Larry Olson, club j
javelin tosser.
Admission for students w ill be by stu- j
dent body cards only, outsiders being
charged fifty cents.

to a third consecutive 1.C.4-A. championship will be discovered when the Cards
clash with Coach Charlie Hunter's Olympic Club track men tomorrow afternoon in
the Stadium, beginning at 2 :30 o'clock.

Stanford should win; but victory, one
way or the other, will be decided only
after a spirited struggle in every one of
the fourteen events. With six members
of the 1928 American Olympic team com
peting, four for the club and two for
Stanford, together with a number of
present and former intercollegiate cham
pions, some remarkable early season per
formances should result.
Four in Games
The four Winged "O" athletes who
took part in the Olympic Games at Am
sterdam last summer are Bud Spencer,
world's 400-meter record holder; Bob
King, intercollegiate and Olympic high
' jump champion; Jim Corson, discus
j thrower; and Earl Fuller, half miler.
It is not definitely known if Spencer and
Fuller will run tomorrow. The two
members of the Cardinal team who com
peted at Amsterdam are Eric Krenz and
Harlow Rothert, Templeton's peerless
! weight men.
The opening event, the mile, will bring
| Alex McKinnon, Stanford four-lap man,
and Ray Brack of the club together.
Brack is reported to have done 4:30 re
cently, while McKinnon was timed at
4 :32 in practice early this week.
In the sprints Hec Dyer, John Laurit
zen, and Alan McDcrmott of the Cards
will match strides with Russ Sweet and
Les Gray of the Olympics. Sweet is
better than an even 'time man in both
! the century and the furlong, while John
i Lauritzen, and Hec Dyer, long-legged
j sophomore flash, have shown up well in
I practice.
440 a Feature
The 440-yard dash, even if Spencer
j doesn't run, should be the feature race
| of the day. Stanford is famous for her
j quarter-milers, and this year is no ex
| ception, Johnny Morrison being able to
!do :49 and better and Bob Syer and
I Maynor Shove running the single lap in
close to :50. Bill Storie, Olympic Club
captain and former Card star, is reported
I to be in better condition than ever before
and capable of 49-second performances.
Should Earl Fuller run lor the club 1
in the 880, there will he little question of
the outcome of this event. With Fuller
not competing, Neikirk, French, and
(jooden of the Cardinal team will he
fairly evenly matched with Tom Mc-'
Guire and Art Holman of the club.
Brown and Loofbourow are Temple- |
ton's Ik-st bets in the two-mile and will
he forced to their limit to beat Bert:
Hooper and Jack Keegan.
Clarence West and Jack Bullis, former!
Stanford atlilet«*s, and Jess I law ley, San !
Jose State's star, will represent the club i
in tiie high hurdles. Captain Ross Nich- !
ols, Ward Edmonds, and Podge Smith j
will be the redshirt entries. West and j

Nichols, and Smith of Stanford will
meet in the lows.

the 23-foot mark this year.

Stanford javelin throwers, who have all '
done 190 feet or better, will have to equal

after a spirited struggle in every one of
the fourteen events. With six members
of the 1928 American Olympic team com
peting, four for the club and two for
Stanford, together with a number of
present and former intercollegiate cham
pions, some remarkable early season per
formances should result.
Four in Games
The four Winged "O" athletes who
took part in the Olympic Games at Am
sterdam last summer are Bud Spencer,
world's 400-meter record holder; Bob
King, intercollegiate and Olympic high
' jump champion; Jim Corson, discus
j thrower; and Earl Fuller, half miler.
It is not definitely known if Spencer and
Fuller will run tomorrow. The two
members of the Cardinal team who com
peted at Amsterdam are Eric Krenz and
Harlow Rothert, Templeton's peerless
! weight men.
The opening event, the mile, will bring
| Alex McKinnon, Stanford four-lap man,
and Ray Brack of the club together.
Brack is reported to have done 4:30 re
cently, while McKinnon was timed at
4 :32 in practice early this week.
In the sprints Hec Dyer, John Laurit
zen, and Alan McDcrmott of the Cards
will match strides with Russ Sweet and
Les Gray of the Olympics. Sweet is
better than an even 'time man in both
! the century and the furlong, while John
i Lauritzen, and Hec Dyer, long-legged
j sophomore flash, have shown up well in
I practice.
440 a Feature
The 440-yard dash, even if Spencer
j doesn't run, should be the feature race
| of the day. Stanford is famous for her
j quarter-milers, and this year is no ex
| ception, Johnny Morrison being able to
!do :49 and better and Bob Syer and
I Maynor Shove running the single lap in
close to :50. Bill Storie, Olympic Club
captain and former Card star, is reported
I to be in better condition than ever before
and capable of 49-second performances.
Should Earl Fuller run lor the club 1
in the 880, there will he little question of
the outcome of this event. With Fuller
not competing, Neikirk, French, and
(jooden of the Cardinal team will he
fairly evenly matched with Tom Mc-'
Guire and Art Holman of the club.
Brown and Loofbourow are Temple- |
ton's Ik-st bets in the two-mile and will
he forced to their limit to beat Bert:
Hooper and Jack Keegan.
Clarence West and Jack Bullis, former!
Stanford atlilet«*s, and Jess I law ley, San !
Jose State's star, will represent the club i
in tiie high hurdles. Captain Ross Nich- !
ols, Ward Edmonds, and Podge Smith j
will be the redshirt entries. West and j
Skinny Johnson of the club and Nelson, ;
Nichols, and Smith of Stanford will
meet in the lows.

Stanford javelin throwers, who have all '
done 190 feet or better, will have to equal
this mark to win from Larry Olson, club j
javelin tosser.

dent body cards only, outsiders being
charged fifty cents.

Whether or not Coach Dink Templeton lias again developed a great track and
field team which will sweep through Pacific Coast and national collegiate competition
to a third consecutive 1.C.4-A. championship will be discovered when the Cards
clash with Coach Charlie Hunter's Olympic Club track men tomorrow afternoon in
the Stadium, beginning at 2 :30 o'clock.
