# Founders' Day
## 
### 
Stanford will pause Sunday in the midst of its mundane activities to
pay homage to the man and woman who made a visualized dream come
true, who were responsible for the founding of the University that bears
their name.
A beautiful and impressive program has been arranged by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in commemorating the one hundred and
fifth anniversary of Senator Stanford's birth and the thirty-eighth anni
versary of the founding of this institution. The program will be marked
by strict simplicity that reflects reverence for the memory of the Found
ers. The setting for the occasion is quite appropriate—Memorial Church,
dedicated to the memory of Senator Leland Stanford. Ihe Church itself
is a thing of quiet beauty and reserve and will lend dignity and depth to
the musical numbers.
The trials and tribulations that beset the Founders in accomplishing
the project dear to their hearts are well known. Stanford has grown and
prospered since those harassing days. It is only fitting and proper that a
time should be set aside when the students can pay appreciative tribute
in a simple but sincere service to the Founders.
