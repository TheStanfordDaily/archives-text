As latest press reports carry news of the fall of one of Mexico's key
cities, Juarez, to the rebel forces, Americans again turn their eyes to the
southern republic, and once again the old query is raised: "What is the
matter with Mexico?" And for the American people, who must, whether
they will or no, live next door to Mexico, the answer to the question is
important.
Not only physical contiguity, with hundreds of miles of common land
frontier, but the large part played in Mexican life by trade and com
merce with this country, the enormous participation of American capital
in Mexican economy, the intermingling of the two peoples and the clash
of cultures, all go to make the United States a dominant influence in
Mexican affairs, and, conversely, make Mexico an important factor in
the life of this country. What with disputes over land, oil, unsettled
claims, and nervous tourists, America might be well justified in writing
ardent notes to the Foreign Office or in threats of intervention or war.
Those may be the only methods recognized by international law, and
by that law we might be relegated to the necessity of invading Mexico
and annexing a section of her territory in the good old-fashioned way.
But such methods—and to the same extent the precepts of international
law —are not only undesirable but are out of date.
Unless either the rebel or federal forces touch American citizens or
property, Washington can only sit by placidly and watch the trend of
this revolution of—not the people —but the armies of Mexico. And like
its predecessors, this upheaval is entirely a game of generals and armies.
There is occasional rioting among civilians, to be sure, but never a popu
lar uprising such as characterized the French or Russian revolutions,
never a widespread flocking to the standard of one man as in the Fascist
Revolution in Italy. The large majority of the Mexican population is too
sodden to comprehend a real revolution or to take any effective part in it.
This revolt is no expression of an intense mass desire on the part of
the Mexican people, or any appreciable section of them. There are no
philosophers, no prophets, no poets, dramatists, or novelists trying to
explain the "great cause." Why? There is no great cause.
There is no fighting behind barricades below the Rio Grande, but
fighting behind trenches. The Mexicans, stolid, uneducated, uninter
ested except where their own property is concerned, do not bother about
the Mexican revolution. They leave that to the armies and the generals,
and to America.

philosophers, no prophets, no poets, dramatists, or novelists trying to
explain the "great cause." Why? There is no great cause.
There is no fighting behind barricades below the Rio Grande, but
fighting behind trenches. The Mexicans, stolid, uneducated, uninter
ested except where their own property is concerned, do not bother about
the Mexican revolution. They leave that to the armies and the generals,
and to America.
As latest press reports carry news of the fall of one of Mexico's key
cities, Juarez, to the rebel forces, Americans again turn their eyes to the
southern republic, and once again the old query is raised: "What is the
matter with Mexico?" And for the American people, who must, whether
they will or no, live next door to Mexico, the answer to the question is
important.
Not only physical contiguity, with hundreds of miles of common land
frontier, but the large part played in Mexican life by trade and com
merce with this country, the enormous participation of American capital
in Mexican economy, the intermingling of the two peoples and the clash
of cultures, all go to make the United States a dominant influence in
Mexican affairs, and, conversely, make Mexico an important factor in
the life of this country. What with disputes over land, oil, unsettled
claims, and nervous tourists, America might be well justified in writing
ardent notes to the Foreign Office or in threats of intervention or war.
Those may be the only methods recognized by international law, and
by that law we might be relegated to the necessity of invading Mexico
and annexing a section of her territory in the good old-fashioned way.
But such methods—and to the same extent the precepts of international
law —are not only undesirable but are out of date.
Unless either the rebel or federal forces touch American citizens or
property, Washington can only sit by placidly and watch the trend of
this revolution of—not the people —but the armies of Mexico. And like
its predecessors, this upheaval is entirely a game of generals and armies.
There is occasional rioting among civilians, to be sure, but never a popu
lar uprising such as characterized the French or Russian revolutions,
never a widespread flocking to the standard of one man as in the Fascist
Revolution in Italy. The large majority of the Mexican population is too
sodden to comprehend a real revolution or to take any effective part in it.
This revolt is no expression of an intense mass desire on the part of
the Mexican people, or any appreciable section of them. There are no
philosophers, no prophets, no poets, dramatists, or novelists trying to
explain the "great cause." Why? There is no great cause.
