A tribute of respect was paid to the memory of President Woodrow
Wilson in a bill granting a pension of $5,000 yearly to his widow, Mrs.
Edith Rolling Wilson. This gracious gesture by Congress, implying as
it does participation of the nation in this gift, is most gratifying to all
who regarded Mr. Wilson so highly.
In any case, action of this kind in behalf of the family of a man who
has served this country to an outstanding degree is very commendable.
In this instance it seems particularly significant, since Wilson, as Presi
dent, gave more of his spirit and strength than most men. It is known
that he exhausted his health in his office as Chief Executive, and that his
life was shortened as a result. How fitting then that the government of
the nation which he served so devotedly should insure material comfort
lor his widow!
Sometimes it is hard to take one's own medicine. Evidently it seemed
so to State Senator Norman J». Ilorton of Michigan, who, after having
supported a bill a few years ago requiring a five-day interval between
application and issuance of a marriage license, recently eloped with a
young lady from Ohio, in which state no such law exists.
Tut, tut, senator! Perhaps some of the rest of us are as sure we arc
right as you were!
