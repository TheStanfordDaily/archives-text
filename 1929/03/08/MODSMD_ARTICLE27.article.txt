"Skidding"—Alcazar.
Written by a former Stanford wo
man, Aurania Rouverol, the new play
at the Alcazar is another one of those
highly amusing domestic comedies
that are synonymous with the Henry
Duffy name. There isn't any great
moral to "Skidding," but the situation
and the characters are so real that
the triteness of the plot can be over
looked.
Mrs. Rouverol presents a typical
small-town, Idaho family. Her play is
interesting because of the humanness
of the people it concerns. Their re
actions are always entertaining, and
Henry Duffy has several excellent
actors in this production.
The story deals with the danger of
"skidding" out of matrimonial bliss
after a few years of wedded life. "Did
you have such problems to solve,
mother, when you got married?" asks
the heroine who is torn between a
career and her lover who says his
wife must stay at home. "No, dear,"
the mother answers, "in my day it was
simply a case of cooking for your
father or your husband!"
Emerson Treacy, this reviewer's fa
vorite juvenile actor, plays Andy, the
kid brother who is just at the growing
up stage. He can portray high school
and college boys more realistically
than anyone I know. With dirty cords
that would make a Stanford man
envious, and a slangy diction sjjited
to the role, he is hilariously funny.
This part is not as good as some
others he has done for Mr. Duffy,
however. The audience wished Miss
Rouverol had written in more of
brother Andy. Treacy is the perfect
adolescent juvenile type.
Clara Blandick, who created the
role of Mrs. Hardy in the New York
production of "Skidding," was brought
West to be the central figure in this
presentation. She is fine in her char
acterization. Grace Stafford, another
newcomer to San Francisco, does
very good work as Marion Hardy, the

heroine. Helen Keers is especially in
teresting as Aunt Milly, the old maid
of the family.
All of the members of the cast have
considerable to do —and Joseph De
Stefani is quite acceptable as the
head of the household. James Bush is
the handsome lover with the old-fash
ioned ideas. Frank Darien gives a
clever grandpa "bit." Helen Kleep
and Bernice Elliott suffice in their
roles of the elder sisters, but neither
are noteworthy.
The climaxes of the play are
not as effective as they might be, and
one can always surmise what will hap
pen next. But the humor of the dia
logue makes it well worth seeing.
"Skidding" is funny throughout, and
the exceptional work of Emerson
Treacy and Clara Blandick will surely
please you. —'Ben Maddox.

that would make a Stanford man
envious, and a slangy diction sjjited
to the role, he is hilariously funny.
This part is not as good as some
others he has done for Mr. Duffy,
however. The audience wished Miss
Rouverol had written in more of
brother Andy. Treacy is the perfect
adolescent juvenile type.
Clara Blandick, who created the
role of Mrs. Hardy in the New York
production of "Skidding," was brought
West to be the central figure in this
presentation. She is fine in her char
acterization. Grace Stafford, another
newcomer to San Francisco, does
very good work as Marion Hardy, the

heroine. Helen Keers is especially in
teresting as Aunt Milly, the old maid
of the family.
All of the members of the cast have
considerable to do —and Joseph De
Stefani is quite acceptable as the
head of the household. James Bush is
the handsome lover with the old-fash
ioned ideas. Frank Darien gives a
clever grandpa "bit." Helen Kleep
and Bernice Elliott suffice in their
roles of the elder sisters, but neither
are noteworthy.
The climaxes of the play are
not as effective as they might be, and
one can always surmise what will hap
pen next. But the humor of the dia
logue makes it well worth seeing.
"Skidding" is funny throughout, and
the exceptional work of Emerson
Treacy and Clara Blandick will surely
please you. —'Ben Maddox.
"Skidding"—Alcazar.
Written by a former Stanford wo
man, Aurania Rouverol, the new play
at the Alcazar is another one of those
highly amusing domestic comedies
that are synonymous with the Henry
Duffy name. There isn't any great
moral to "Skidding," but the situation
and the characters are so real that
the triteness of the plot can be over
looked.
Mrs. Rouverol presents a typical
small-town, Idaho family. Her play is
interesting because of the humanness
of the people it concerns. Their re
actions are always entertaining, and
Henry Duffy has several excellent
actors in this production.
The story deals with the danger of
"skidding" out of matrimonial bliss
after a few years of wedded life. "Did
you have such problems to solve,
mother, when you got married?" asks
the heroine who is torn between a
career and her lover who says his
wife must stay at home. "No, dear,"
the mother answers, "in my day it was
simply a case of cooking for your
father or your husband!"
Emerson Treacy, this reviewer's fa
vorite juvenile actor, plays Andy, the
kid brother who is just at the growing
up stage. He can portray high school
and college boys more realistically
than anyone I know. With dirty cords
that would make a Stanford man
envious, and a slangy diction sjjited
to the role, he is hilariously funny.
