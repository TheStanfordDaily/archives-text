# AT THE THEATRES
## 
### 
ALCAZAR—Skidding. A usual Duffy
"scoop" on the western rights of the
present New York comedy surprise.
The play is written by a Stanford
woman, and is now in its tenth month
in New York. (Reviewed in this is
sue.)
COLUMBIA—The 19th Hole. Frank
Craven as the star of his own pro
duction takes this piece over the bor
der from mediocrity to good enter
tainment. Especially good for golf
nuts.
CURRAN —The Silent House. A
tingly and exciting mystery-melo
drama featuring sinister, slant-eyed
orientals.
GEARY—Escape, by John Gals
worthy. This is my recommendation
for the play you should see. Done in
a prologue of nine episodes.
GREEN STREET—Easy for Zee
Zee. This used to be a sensation, now
it's becoming monotonous. The 27th
week.
PRESIDENT—The Skull. A mystery
play that's jammed full of the usual
liair-raising stunts that entertain and
amuse. —Clifford F. Weigle.
