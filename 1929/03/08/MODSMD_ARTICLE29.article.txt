The editor, Sir:
My exasperation knows no bounds; my
righteous indignation is positively star
tling—all because of a miserable one-unit
course.
Since when, may I inquire, has it been
customary for instructors, giving one
hour courses, to require that their classes
meet twice a week? Since when has it
been customary for them to give two
hour finals over their subjects? Since
when have instructors had the right to
assign weekly papers, good-sized text
book chapters, and colossal lists of out
side reading—all for a one-hour course?
Right or no right, custom or no cus
tom, that is exactly what one Waldo
Marra, hireling of the Bank of Italy, is
cramming down the throats of his class
in Business Letter Writing, along with
a lot of nasal propaganda concerning the
giant of finance for which he works.
This is not the tirade of the proverbial
shirking collegian, ever fighting against
a little real study. But it is the honest
protest of a conscientious objector who
sees no justice in the tactics of Mr.
Marra.
fhe amount of work Marra is piling
on his class is an injustice for those with
a heavy schedule who took the course
expecting to do one unit's work—not five.
Cannot the Division of Journalism or the
University put Mr. Marra wise?

(II) "Calvin Coolidge, A Clinical
Study"
Once again is our sense of proportion
and justice riddled by explosive student
critics! This time the attack comes in a
series of libelous comments upon Calvin
Coolidge delivered by such a recognized
national critic as Mr. Clifford F. Weigle,
'29. In the "Bullsession" of March 6.
Mr. Weigle bellows loud and long at
ex-President Coolidge, and then cites as
authority, not concrete facts, but the tes
timony of none other than our well
known defamatory critic, Mr. Mencken!
The greatest asset of Mr. Coolidge,
and one in which he most differs from
his Campus assailants, is that he truly
knew when to keep silent when nothing
of value or truth was to be said.
As was pointed out in a preceding ar
ticle, the entire period of office of Presi
dent Coolidge was shadowed by Con
gressional antagonism. This opposition
was a natural reaction to the broad as
sumption of legislative power by the
Chief Executive during the late war.
Congress was grudgingly compelled to
acquiesce during the actual hostilities, but
a definite reaction began and continued
with the administration of 1921.
The wise aim of Mr. Coolidge during
his six years of office was to permit eco
nomic tendencies to follow their course.
Such a policy becomes less a matter of
domineering executive power than of
quiet restriction of an awakened legis
lative consciousness.
The entire weakness of the above-men

of the Daily. Because of sfxicc limitation j
tain more than three hundred- words. The ;
'lions expressed in this column.
tioncd attack of Mr. Weigle lies in his
judgment of President Coolidge as prac
tically a nonentity. In this conclusion, he
has failed to analyze the part that Mr.
Coolidge was compelled to play during
his six years of office. But still further,
Mr. Weigle has cleverly, completely
avoided mention of past political experi
ence of the ex-President. Calvin Coo
lidge was selected as the running mate j
of Warren G. Harding primarily because
of the weight of a long-continued, exten
sive political service in the state of Mas
sachusetts. Almost by rotation, Coolidge !
ascended from a civic post in Boston to j
state assemblyman, Speaker of the
House, Speaker of the State Senate, and
at last, Governor of Massachusetts. Now
his progress through these positions was
not due to the guiding hand of Heaven,
or the electorate, but to innate ability!
Could any individual fill that most pow
erful position of Speaker of the House
without the broadest foundation of mer
it- Yet this was but one step in the
ascendency of Calvin Coolidge.
Clearly, the issue has become a matter
of viewing with some interpretation, and
understanding, the post-bellum Congres
sional and Executive tendencies of the j
passing decade. The blind, caustic criti
cism of the retiring President is, in the
main, unfounded in fact. The deepest
praise alone can be extended to the calm,
cautious leader who has transferred to!
Mr. Hoover, as a heritage, a true work- i
ing ground of actual prosperity coupled
with international goodwill. "Lest we |
forget" may well apply!

The editor, Sir:
My exasperation knows no bounds; my
righteous indignation is positively star
tling—all because of a miserable one-unit
course.
Since when, may I inquire, has it been
customary for instructors, giving one
hour courses, to require that their classes
meet twice a week? Since when has it
been customary for them to give two
hour finals over their subjects? Since
when have instructors had the right to
assign weekly papers, good-sized text
book chapters, and colossal lists of out
side reading—all for a one-hour course?
Right or no right, custom or no cus
tom, that is exactly what one Waldo
Marra, hireling of the Bank of Italy, is
cramming down the throats of his class
in Business Letter Writing, along with
a lot of nasal propaganda concerning the
giant of finance for which he works.
This is not the tirade of the proverbial
shirking collegian, ever fighting against
a little real study. But it is the honest
protest of a conscientious objector who
sees no justice in the tactics of Mr.
Marra.
fhe amount of work Marra is piling
on his class is an injustice for those with
a heavy schedule who took the course
expecting to do one unit's work—not five.
Cannot the Division of Journalism or the
University put Mr. Marra wise?

(II) "Calvin Coolidge, A Clinical
Study"
Once again is our sense of proportion
and justice riddled by explosive student
critics! This time the attack comes in a
series of libelous comments upon Calvin
Coolidge delivered by such a recognized
national critic as Mr. Clifford F. Weigle,
'29. In the "Bullsession" of March 6.
Mr. Weigle bellows loud and long at
ex-President Coolidge, and then cites as
authority, not concrete facts, but the tes
timony of none other than our well
known defamatory critic, Mr. Mencken!
The greatest asset of Mr. Coolidge,
and one in which he most differs from
his Campus assailants, is that he truly
knew when to keep silent when nothing
of value or truth was to be said.
As was pointed out in a preceding ar
ticle, the entire period of office of Presi
dent Coolidge was shadowed by Con
gressional antagonism. This opposition
was a natural reaction to the broad as
sumption of legislative power by the
Chief Executive during the late war.
Congress was grudgingly compelled to
acquiesce during the actual hostilities, but
a definite reaction began and continued
with the administration of 1921.
The wise aim of Mr. Coolidge during
his six years of office was to permit eco
nomic tendencies to follow their course.
Such a policy becomes less a matter of
domineering executive power than of
quiet restriction of an awakened legis
lative consciousness.
The entire weakness of the above-men

of the Daily. Because of sfxicc limitation j
tain more than three hundred- words. The ;
'lions expressed in this column.
tioncd attack of Mr. Weigle lies in his
judgment of President Coolidge as prac
tically a nonentity. In this conclusion, he
has failed to analyze the part that Mr.
Coolidge was compelled to play during
his six years of office. But still further,
Mr. Weigle has cleverly, completely
avoided mention of past political experi
ence of the ex-President. Calvin Coo
lidge was selected as the running mate j
of Warren G. Harding primarily because
of the weight of a long-continued, exten
sive political service in the state of Mas
sachusetts. Almost by rotation, Coolidge !
ascended from a civic post in Boston to j
state assemblyman, Speaker of the
House, Speaker of the State Senate, and
at last, Governor of Massachusetts. Now
his progress through these positions was
not due to the guiding hand of Heaven,
or the electorate, but to innate ability!
Could any individual fill that most pow
erful position of Speaker of the House
without the broadest foundation of mer
it- Yet this was but one step in the
ascendency of Calvin Coolidge.

The editor, Sir:
My exasperation knows no bounds; my
righteous indignation is positively star
tling—all because of a miserable one-unit
course.
Since when, may I inquire, has it been
customary for instructors, giving one
hour courses, to require that their classes
meet twice a week? Since when has it
been customary for them to give two
hour finals over their subjects? Since
when have instructors had the right to
assign weekly papers, good-sized text
book chapters, and colossal lists of out
side reading—all for a one-hour course?
Right or no right, custom or no cus
tom, that is exactly what one Waldo
Marra, hireling of the Bank of Italy, is
cramming down the throats of his class
in Business Letter Writing, along with
a lot of nasal propaganda concerning the
giant of finance for which he works.
This is not the tirade of the proverbial
shirking collegian, ever fighting against
a little real study. But it is the honest
protest of a conscientious objector who
sees no justice in the tactics of Mr.
Marra.
fhe amount of work Marra is piling
on his class is an injustice for those with
a heavy schedule who took the course
expecting to do one unit's work—not five.
Cannot the Division of Journalism or the
University put Mr. Marra wise?

(II) "Calvin Coolidge, A Clinical
Study"
Once again is our sense of proportion
and justice riddled by explosive student
critics! This time the attack comes in a
series of libelous comments upon Calvin
Coolidge delivered by such a recognized
national critic as Mr. Clifford F. Weigle,
'29. In the "Bullsession" of March 6.
Mr. Weigle bellows loud and long at
ex-President Coolidge, and then cites as
authority, not concrete facts, but the tes
timony of none other than our well
known defamatory critic, Mr. Mencken!
The greatest asset of Mr. Coolidge,
and one in which he most differs from
his Campus assailants, is that he truly
knew when to keep silent when nothing
of value or truth was to be said.
As was pointed out in a preceding ar
ticle, the entire period of office of Presi
dent Coolidge was shadowed by Con
gressional antagonism. This opposition
was a natural reaction to the broad as
sumption of legislative power by the
Chief Executive during the late war.
Congress was grudgingly compelled to
acquiesce during the actual hostilities, but
a definite reaction began and continued
with the administration of 1921.
The wise aim of Mr. Coolidge during
his six years of office was to permit eco
nomic tendencies to follow their course.
Such a policy becomes less a matter of
domineering executive power than of
quiet restriction of an awakened legis
lative consciousness.
The entire weakness of the above-men

of the Daily. Because of sfxicc limitation j
tain more than three hundred- words. The ;
'lions expressed in this column.
tioncd attack of Mr. Weigle lies in his
judgment of President Coolidge as prac
tically a nonentity. In this conclusion, he
has failed to analyze the part that Mr.
Coolidge was compelled to play during
his six years of office. But still further,
Mr. Weigle has cleverly, completely
avoided mention of past political experi
ence of the ex-President. Calvin Coo
lidge was selected as the running mate j
of Warren G. Harding primarily because
of the weight of a long-continued, exten
sive political service in the state of Mas
sachusetts. Almost by rotation, Coolidge !
