ANENT TRACK
Sweet spring is with us again.
Long legged, sweaty Sons of the Stan
ford Red are jogging around the
track in earnest; long-waisted, equally
sweaty ones are grunting as they hurl
the javelin or the shot. Liniment has
been adopted as the nectar of life.
Tomorrow Dink Templeton leads his
Cardinal tracksters under fire for the
first time this year. And the fire
should be passing loud and heavy, for
the Winged "O" oval stars are rated
as a dangerous organization.
In fact, the invading Olympians,
with a group of one-time Stan
ford stars, are picked as sure win
ners by more than one critic who
is alleged to know something
about this track business.
Picking the winner of a track
meet this early in the game
seems a bit to us like guessing
the answers to the plus-minus
questions in Spanish-American
history examinations.
Maybe the Olympic Club, a la Cardi
nal, will win—maybe it won't. That
can be decided tomorrow much more
convincingly than it can be today.
But whoever wins tomorrow, there
are a couple of things which the
Board of Athletic Control might do
to make the meet a trifle more inter
esting to ye fan who squats uneasily
on the splinters of the stadium seats.
Hurriedly we rise to remark that
this is not a move to heap more coals
on the head of the proverbially em
battled Board of Athletic Control.
Merely an attempt to be constructive
ly helpful, gentlemen.
Our brain-child is simply this:
why couldn't markers be placed
along the broad-jump pit and be
side the high-jump and pole-vault
stands, showing approximately
the distance of each leap immedi
ately after it was made.
In the wide-open spaces of our
Stadium a foot looks like an inch.
A world's record might be broken
and no one in the stands would
turn a hair.
This may seem like a trivial
point to many, but it appeals to
us as being something really
needed—so that the fans may get
a hazy idea of what is going on.

track in earnest; long-waisted, equally
sweaty ones are grunting as they hurl
the javelin or the shot. Liniment has
been adopted as the nectar of life.
Tomorrow Dink Templeton leads his
Cardinal tracksters under fire for the
first time this year. And the fire
should be passing loud and heavy, for
the Winged "O" oval stars are rated
as a dangerous organization.
In fact, the invading Olympians,
with a group of one-time Stan
ford stars, are picked as sure win
ners by more than one critic who
is alleged to know something
about this track business.
Picking the winner of a track
meet this early in the game
seems a bit to us like guessing
the answers to the plus-minus
questions in Spanish-American
history examinations.
Maybe the Olympic Club, a la Cardi
nal, will win—maybe it won't. That
can be decided tomorrow much more
convincingly than it can be today.
But whoever wins tomorrow, there
are a couple of things which the
Board of Athletic Control might do
to make the meet a trifle more inter
esting to ye fan who squats uneasily
on the splinters of the stadium seats.
Hurriedly we rise to remark that
this is not a move to heap more coals
on the head of the proverbially em
battled Board of Athletic Control.
Merely an attempt to be constructive
ly helpful, gentlemen.
Our brain-child is simply this:
why couldn't markers be placed
along the broad-jump pit and be
side the high-jump and pole-vault
stands, showing approximately
the distance of each leap immedi
ately after it was made.
In the wide-open spaces of our
Stadium a foot looks like an inch.
A world's record might be broken
and no one in the stands would
turn a hair.
This may seem like a trivial
point to many, but it appeals to
us as being something really
needed—so that the fans may get
a hazy idea of what is going on.
