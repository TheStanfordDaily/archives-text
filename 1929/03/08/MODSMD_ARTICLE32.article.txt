# FRANK A. MARSHALL TO SHOW PAINTINGS IN CAMPUS GALLERY
## New Exhibition Composed of Landscapes; To Remain Here All Month 
### 
Sunday morning the exhibition by J
Frank H. Marshall, which is replacing j
the Banner display in the Stanford j
Art Gallery, will be opened to the j
public.
The new exhibition consists of 100 i
paintings, chiefly landscapes. The pic- I
tures are unusually small, the largest j
of them being not more than twelve I
by eighteen inches in size, but many [
gems are included among them.
The artist studied at the Art Stu-'
dents League in New York under j
Twachtman, Du Mond, and Bridge- j
man, and at the New York School of j
Art under William M. Chase. He also i
j.ttended the Julian Academy at Paris j
in 190(5, where he worked under Jean j
Paul Laurens.
Marshall afterwards spent six
months in the galleries of Madrid,
Paris, and London, and three months
in the American galleries studying
American landscapes. He was en
gaged in painting landscapes in New
England for several years, especially
at the "colony" at Old Lyne on the
Connecticut coast.
Prom 191G to 1921 the artist served '
with the Red Cross, mainly in the I
hospital service, in California and !
Arizona. This led to his interest in i
California subjects, which he began |
to sketch in 1925. The present collec-!
tion represents work from this period. I
Marshall has thus far undertaken :
no large pictures and most of the J
items here Shown are of sketch-box i
size, made primarily as material for j
larger pictures. A few of the pictures
have been shown previously at the:
Palo Alto Club, but most of them i
represent work of a subsequent year. |
This display will remain in the
Stanford Gallery for the rest of j
March.
