Immediately following the close of the .
University for the spring vacation, a!
Three-man team from the Stanford de- j
hate squad will leave the campus for a :
forensic tour of colleges in the southern j
part of the state.
Beginning Monday, March 25, the team
will follow an intensive schedule of five j
consecutive debates, meeting Occidental;
College, Pomona, Loyola, the California
Institute of Technology, and U.C.L.A.
Irving Rosenblatt, Lawrence Kimpton, j
and Norman Tyre have been selected i
from the general debate squad of twelve j
men to make the trip. They will leave on j
the day following the completion of final
examinations.
The southern tour will open with a con-1
test at Occidental College on Monday |
evening. The following evening the team
will appear in the second major contest !
of the year at Pomona. The first large i
forensic event at this institution was held j
with the University of Australia.
Loyola College and Stanford will meet j
on Wednesday, March 27, before the
regular monthly meeting of the Los An- j
geles Elks Club. Information supplied j
by the Loyola debate manager indicates ,
that more than 600 members of the club |

and their guests will be present. In these !
first three contests, the Cardinal team
will take the negative on the question, j
"Resolved, That foreign criticism of j
American characteristics, culture, and |
ideals is justified."
Making a shift to the question, "Re- !
solved, That the plea of temporary in- !
sanity as a defense for crime should be j
prohibited by law," the team will debate j
the California Institute of Technology
on Thursday and concludes the schedule j
at U.C.L.A. Friday evening with a con- '
test on the same topic.
Following the final contest, the men j
will vacation in the South for several
days before returning to the campus for

their initial varsity debating speech while
on the tour. A considerable background j
of high school debating and oratorical i
work will assist them, however. Rosen

vember political debate at U.S.C., has i
had three years of high school experi
ence and was president of the San Fran
cisco High School Debating League. He
is best known on the campus for his dra- j
matic work in "The Queen's Husband." j
