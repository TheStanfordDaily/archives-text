# CARD MERMEN FACE CALIFORNIA IN WATER POLO TILT SATURDAY
## Bear Team Crippled Through Ineligibility of Helm, Star Center Back 
### 
In the varsity water polo game Satur
day at 2 o'clock in the Athens Club pool,
the Stanford mermen face a weakened
California team which has had no inter
collegiate competition this year. Last
Monday the Bear seven defeated the
Athens Club team, 4-3. Earlier in the
season, the club team was downed by
Stanford, 14-1.
The California squad is crippled by the
ineligibility of a star center back, Johnny
Helm, and by the graduation of Castel
lazzo. The probable line-up is:
California Stanford
Ducato cf Harrison (c)
Mac Lean rf R. Burns
Lambert If M. Burns
Shulte cb Strong
Gustafson rb Driggs
Nevin lb Parker
Raeder g Thornton
Lambert and Schuite are two players
from last year's freshman squad.
The Bear yearling water polo men are
an unknown quantity, with the exception
of Jan, who performed well on the
Hollywood team. With much the same
swimmers on the opposing polo teams as
were on the swimming squads last week,
the Stanford babes are favored to tri
umph easily over their opponents.
The probable freshman line-up is:
California Stanford
Jan cf Clapp
Rader rf Booth (c)
Derne If Pahl
Lewis cb Woods
Peeler rb Harris
Bonar lb Slocum
Chamblin g Judah
Both games will be played in the Ath
ens Club pool, Oakland. The varsity
game starts at 2 o'clock and will be
immediately followed by the freshman
game.
