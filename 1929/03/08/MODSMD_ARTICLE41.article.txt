## 
### 
During a recent interview given the
Daily in San Francisco, Willard C.
White, vice-president, Armour and Com
pany, Chicago, said that college men who
enter business with the hope of succeed
ing in it must have definite objectives,
and, once having determined what their
objectives are, must be willing to do any
sort of work, no matter how seemingly
menial, if the work in question will help!
them reach their objectives.
"What objectives have you? Have you
made a plan for your life? Where do
you think you're heading? Those are the
questions I would put to a college man
about to enter business," said White.
"I like to see a young man with an
objective. I'm reminded of two Annapo
lis men. I've known them for only three I
years or so. But I have 110 doubt about
where they're headed. They're going to \
be at the top some day. Perhaps it is the
very efficiency of their training. I don't
know. To these men the kind of work
they're assigned or its duration means
nothing. Each piece of work they con
sider only as another opportunity to
show what they can do. Their work tliey
consider as a means to an end, a neces-1
sary means to a previously determined!
end."
