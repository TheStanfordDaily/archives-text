# JOHN WYNN GILLESPIE WORKS AT BOTANICAL SPECIMENS FROM INTERIOR OF FIJI ISLANDS
## 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
After eight months in the mountainous
interior regions of the Fiji Islands where
he did botanical research work, John
Wynn Gillespie, graduate student in the
department of botany here, is now work
ing with the numerous specimens which
he brought back with him.
Until about fifty years ago, the Fiji
Islanders were one of the most ferocious
cannibal tribes on the face of the earth,
and for this reason, botanical collections
from the group were secured only from
the coastal sections. Gillespie, however,
went into the mountain strongholds of
the Fijians, visiting many areas as yet un
explored by scientists. All his traveling
was done on foot or in crude boats. In
drying and caring for his collections of
ferns and flowering plants, Gillespie
found his greatest impediment the ex
ceedingly high rainfall on the mountain
tops. In some places the rain exceeds 300
inches a year, falling mostly during the
tropical summer.
The Islanders live in jungle lints, the
roofs of which are thatched with banana
leaves, and the floors are covered with
the fronds of tree ferns.
In the spring of 1927, Gillespie was
appointed a Bishop Museum Traveling
Fellow from Yale University. The his
tory of the Bishop Museum is an inter
esting one. It is located at Honolulu,
Hawaii, and is a memorial to the Prin
cess Paualii, the last of the Kamehameha
family, the royalty of Hawaii. It was
founded in 1889 by her husband, Charles
Reed Bishop, who after nearly tifty years
of prominence in the islands, inherited
the royal property.
Gillespie's work was immediately pre
ceded by that of Harold E. Parks, Hon
orary Curator of the Herbarium, at the
University of California and the collec
tions made by them are characterized by

Dean E. D. Merrill of U.C. as "ranking
with the largest and most important ever
made at California." Gillespie is now a
Royal Victor Fellow at Stanford, and is
preparing descriptions and illustrations
of the Polynesian plants under the gen
eral direction of Dean Merrill and of
Dr. Leßoy Abranis, professor of botany
at Stanford.
Having worked in comparatively few
of the numerous islands of the Fiji
group, Gillespie hopes to return in May
to continue his studies.

roofs of which are thatched with banana
leaves, and the floors are covered with
the fronds of tree ferns.
In the spring of 1927, Gillespie was
appointed a Bishop Museum Traveling
Fellow from Yale University. The his
tory of the Bishop Museum is an inter
esting one. It is located at Honolulu,
Hawaii, and is a memorial to the Prin
cess Paualii, the last of the Kamehameha
family, the royalty of Hawaii. It was
founded in 1889 by her husband, Charles
Reed Bishop, who after nearly tifty years
of prominence in the islands, inherited
the royal property.
Gillespie's work was immediately pre
ceded by that of Harold E. Parks, Hon
orary Curator of the Herbarium, at the
University of California and the collec
tions made by them are characterized by

Dean E. D. Merrill of U.C. as "ranking
with the largest and most important ever
made at California." Gillespie is now a
Royal Victor Fellow at Stanford, and is
preparing descriptions and illustrations
of the Polynesian plants under the gen
eral direction of Dean Merrill and of
Dr. Leßoy Abranis, professor of botany
at Stanford.
Having worked in comparatively few
of the numerous islands of the Fiji
group, Gillespie hopes to return in May
to continue his studies.
After eight months in the mountainous
interior regions of the Fiji Islands where
he did botanical research work, John
Wynn Gillespie, graduate student in the
department of botany here, is now work
ing with the numerous specimens which
he brought back with him.
Until about fifty years ago, the Fiji
Islanders were one of the most ferocious
cannibal tribes on the face of the earth,
and for this reason, botanical collections
from the group were secured only from
the coastal sections. Gillespie, however,
went into the mountain strongholds of
the Fijians, visiting many areas as yet un
explored by scientists. All his traveling
was done on foot or in crude boats. In
drying and caring for his collections of
ferns and flowering plants, Gillespie
found his greatest impediment the ex
ceedingly high rainfall on the mountain
tops. In some places the rain exceeds 300
inches a year, falling mostly during the
tropical summer.
The Islanders live in jungle lints, the
roofs of which are thatched with banana
leaves, and the floors are covered with
the fronds of tree ferns.
