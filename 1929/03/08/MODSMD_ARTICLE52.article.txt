# STANFORD GYMNASTS ENCOUNTER TUMBLING BEARS FRIDAY NIGHT
## 
### 
Tomorrow night Coacli Royce Long
will take nineteen varsity and fresh
man gymnasts to the U.C. gymnasium
for a meet with the strong California
team at 8 o'clock. Coach Long anil
his boys are none too sanguine about
the outcome, for the Bears appear to
have their usual powerful aggrega
tion, which in the past has nearly
always proved too much for the Card
twisters. However the team is much
stronger than usual, and in a few
events is outstanding.
Leading the varsity gymnasts are i
Captain Clarence Naff, winner of a
first place in tumbling in last year's
big meet and a cinch for a good score
tomorrow night; Willie Phelps, a
beautiful performer on the rings and
a high-scorer on last year's freshman
team; Eugene Puthoff, a valuable man
in every event; Ridley, outstanding
on the rings; and Heber Gooden,
who works well in every event.
