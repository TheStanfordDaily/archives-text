## Some Long Drivers 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
The wallop is as much sought after
I in golf as it is in baseball, and the
I thrill of smacking a few good ones
; for 250 yards or so does a lot to
make up for missed putts and bad
' approaches. But don't tell me you
| think 250 yards is a long drive. Why,
; a man has driven a golf ball twice
that distance!
Talk about heavy artillery, and the
I power of the punch, you should see
Charley Hall, of Birmingham, Ala
; bama, give the little white pellet a
ride. According to Zipp Newman,
1 sports editor of the Birmingham News,
Charley once drove a ball more than
I 500 yards. But Zipp adds that the con
tour of the ground was propitious,
and the ball, hitting on an exposed
! rock on the carry, bounded over a
| ridge and hurried frantically on its
' way.
j I have found records of a dozen
golfers who have driven 400 yards or
better. Tom Andrews' sport record
book (1923) credits W. S. Caldwell

with his 489-yard wallop, while Jimmy
Gullane's smack was printed in all ;
the papers about tour years ago. In i
England, James Braid and another i
pro named Home drove more than i
450 yards, Abe Mitchell and E. C. i
Bliss a quarter of a mile, and a i
Frenchman named Fred Lamarchand ,
drove to the edge of the green at the !
483-yard fourteenth hole at Westward
Ho, England. Dexter Cummings and
Fred Wright, of the U.S.A., have like- j
wise driven the double furlong.
Among the ladies, Glenna Collett
and Florence Beebe have each made
tee shots of 310 yards. One-armed D. [
R. Anderson knocked his ball 300 1
yards backwards. Ambitious golfers !
have made drives off the Cheops |
pyramids in Egypt, off airplanes, surf- j
boards, mountain tops, skyscrapers, j
and into passing planes and freight !
trains. Johnny Farrell won $1,000 by j
driving a golf ball from the mainland
of Florida to Davis Island, 300 yards j
distant.

make up for missed putts and bad
' approaches. But don't tell me you
| think 250 yards is a long drive. Why,
; a man has driven a golf ball twice
that distance!
Talk about heavy artillery, and the
I power of the punch, you should see
Charley Hall, of Birmingham, Ala
; bama, give the little white pellet a
ride. According to Zipp Newman,
1 sports editor of the Birmingham News,
Charley once drove a ball more than
I 500 yards. But Zipp adds that the con
tour of the ground was propitious,
and the ball, hitting on an exposed
! rock on the carry, bounded over a
| ridge and hurried frantically on its
' way.
j I have found records of a dozen
golfers who have driven 400 yards or
better. Tom Andrews' sport record
book (1923) credits W. S. Caldwell

with his 489-yard wallop, while Jimmy
Gullane's smack was printed in all ;
the papers about tour years ago. In i
England, James Braid and another i
pro named Home drove more than i
450 yards, Abe Mitchell and E. C. i
Bliss a quarter of a mile, and a i
Frenchman named Fred Lamarchand ,
drove to the edge of the green at the !
483-yard fourteenth hole at Westward
Ho, England. Dexter Cummings and
Fred Wright, of the U.S.A., have like- j
wise driven the double furlong.
Among the ladies, Glenna Collett
and Florence Beebe have each made
tee shots of 310 yards. One-armed D. [
R. Anderson knocked his ball 300 1
yards backwards. Ambitious golfers !
have made drives off the Cheops |
pyramids in Egypt, off airplanes, surf- j
boards, mountain tops, skyscrapers, j
and into passing planes and freight !
trains. Johnny Farrell won $1,000 by j
driving a golf ball from the mainland
of Florida to Davis Island, 300 yards j
distant.

The wallop is as much sought after
I in golf as it is in baseball, and the
I thrill of smacking a few good ones
; for 250 yards or so does a lot to
make up for missed putts and bad
' approaches. But don't tell me you
