# CARD BOXERS PREPARE FOR SECOND TOURNEY WITH BERKELEY SQUAD
## 
### 
Cardinal boxers are entering an in
tensive week of training in prepara- ,
tion for the second and final Stanford-
California tournament of the season
which will take place in Harmon Gym-'
uusium, Berkeley, Thursday night. 1
The Hears won the first tourney by
the close margin of 4-3.
In early season contests, the Stan
ford team was notoriously weak in
the medium weights. Hut with the ap
pearance on the varsity card of
Johnny Dawson in the welterweight
division and Hal Crumly in the light
4ieavy class, this part of the Cardinal
iineup has been greatly strengthened,
both men are aggressive boxers and
won brilliant victories in the recent
California Aggie matches.
t A1 Doerr is another flashy welter
weight, but Dawson outsliades him
for aggressive lighting. Dawson de
feated Bob Streeter, the Aggie who
holds a win over Doerr. Hill Hollings
worth and Jack Craig are other liglit
heavyweights of promise.
Coach Harry Maloney has three
sure winners in Vance Rogers, Danny
Frost, and Captain Ed Dillon who
fight in the featherweight, light
weight, and heavyweight classes.
Johnny Sano, Japanese bantamweight,
i.s an erratic boxer. If in condition,
Sano is a hard man to beat.
The middleweight class remains
Hie weakest link of the Stanford line
jip. Duke Brown, Milt Cohen, Lester
Sands, and Thad McNamara, leading
Cardinal raiddleweights, are all 011 a
par. California i.s represented in this
division by Dwight Gribben, a rangy â– 
Jad who formerly held the amateur
title and bids well to win it again this
year.
