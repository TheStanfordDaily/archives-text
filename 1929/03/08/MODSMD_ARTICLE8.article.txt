# CRIPPLED FROSH NINE PLAYS SALINAS HIGH TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
Weakened by three crippled players,
! Stanford's freshman baseball team
will play the Salinas high-school nine
tomorrow morning at 10 on the sunken
diamond.
Herb Barsumian, regular second
| baseman, slightly sprained an ankle
in the Menlo Junior College game
; and it is causing him some trouble.
Rudy Rintala, center fielder, is laid
up with an abscess on the palm of his
! left hand, which may keep him out of
the lineup. "Mac" McLean, pitcher,
is suffering from an attack of poison
oak. It is not serious and lie will be
I in uniform tomorrow.
Ernie Caddel will start on the
| mound for the babes against Salinas,
i and it is probable that he will go the
full route. With the exception of last
I Saturday's game with Lowell Hi which
was decidedly an "off" day, Caddell
; has pitched brilliant ball all season.
â€¢He has speed, control, and a fast
; breaking curve ball. Either Dixon or
Evans will catch for the frosh.
The complete lineup for the fresh
men tomorrow will consist of catcher,
; Evans or Dixon; pitcher, Caddell;
| first base, Marks; second base, Bar
sumian; third base, Kelly; shortstop,
White; left field, Waterman; center-
I field, Rintala or Griggs; right field,
! Fox.
