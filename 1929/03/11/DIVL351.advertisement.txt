When You're Asked to Address
A Gathering
SOME day you may be a leader in your community—the man to
whom everyone turns when strong counsel is wanted. Already you
may be on the road to a broader service—contributing your time and
thought to extra-curriculum affairs —editing a paper, managing or
playing on a team, doing social service work, acting for the dramatic
club. Out of college the same opportunity for public service exists as
in college. Men who are leaders in their business or profession are often
leaders in civic affairs, too.
When you leave college you're going to meet Stone & Webster men.
You'll find them taking an active part in the community —leading
in civic affairs as they lead in their business. You'll find them
managing transportation companies, operating and financing public
utility companies and building industrial plants. You'll find the
Stone & Webster organization is worth knowing and worth doing
business with. The Stone & Webster training ably fits its men for
public service.
