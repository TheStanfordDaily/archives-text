Gentlemen:
Replying to your circular letter of
June 29, be informed that your sample
packages were received. With them
1 received the pamphlet describing
your product, which I was able to
enjoy reading because there was not
in the circular matter the usual dis
tasteful sales talk which makes the
recipient of a sample package feel
obligated or uncomfortable.
I believe your practice of giving
your prospect a sample and then
letting him make up his own mind
will gain you many more customers
than will the usual modern sales prac
tice of pushing the product down the
prospect's throat. As a matter of fact,
since receiving your sample and your
advertising matter I smoked up the
sample package and have since pur
chased a number of cans from neigh
borhood dealers, all of whom carry
thus tobacco in a city of this size.
1 have found Edgeworth to be a
satisfactory blend at a very reason
able price, and although my past ac
quaintance is brief, I look forward to a
long membership in che Edgeworth
