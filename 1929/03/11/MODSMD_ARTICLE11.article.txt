! (A 3 ) —Going back along the new inter
| national trail he blazed yesterday,
j Col. Charles A. Lindbergh took off
j from the Brownsville airport at 10:30
, a.m., today with the first aerial load
i of mail in the new Brownsville-Mexico
! C;ty service. He opened the route of-
I ficially yesterday when he brought a
! heavy load of mail and passengers
from Mexico City. Today 12 passen
! gers rode to the south with him.
I
The cheers of about 15,000 persons
drowned the roar of the three motors
of the huge Ford tri-motored plane
when Lindbergh swept into the air.
It was a new ship, 1350 horsepower,
received from the Detroit factory only
yepterday. He came to the airport ten
minutes before the scheduled laving
tim —10 o'clock —and his plane was
delayed 30 minutes awaiting the ar
rival of passengers and Mexican and
United States mail. His take-off was
the final event in a two-day celebra
tion incident to dedication of the new
580-acre airport and the opening of
the Mexico City-Brownsville-San An- j
tonio airmail and passenger routes. ;
It is destined to become one of the
United States' greatest, he indicated
j he believed, and already had appoint-
I ments making it an airport of the
higest class.
The new line operated by the Mexi- j
can Aviation Company is part of the
; general system of the Pan-American !
Company, said Lindbergh, chief tech- J
j nical adviser of the major company. !
