### 
Climaxing the efforts of scholars
and historians for a decade the Hoo
ver War Library of Stanford Univer
sity Friday achieved a long-sought
goal with receipt from the Carnegie j
Endowment for International Peace of |
the 20-volume publication, "My Diary
at the Conference of Paris" by Dr.
David Hunter Miller of New York.
Packed with documents and hith
erto unpublished data of the utmost
importance, and printed in a limited ,
edition of only forty sets, the publica-1
tion, together with other records and
documents in the Hoover War Li
brary, will make available to scholars
what is believed to be the most com
plete and revealing peace conference
collection in existence. The first set
ot the numbered forty was retained
by the author, Stanford receiving set
No. 2.
New Material Uncovered
Unexplained phases and operations
of the Conference of Paris may now
be revealed with the placement in one
library of the Miller diary, the Her
ron Papers, and the valuable data of
the Supreme Economic Council.
The data of the Supreme Economic
Council completes the record of ne
gotiations and adjustments and casts
light over the entire field, heretofore
partially obscured. In presenting the
Miller diary to Stanford, Dr. Nicho
las Murray Butler, director of the
Carnegie Endowment, in a letter to j
Professor Ralph H. Lutz, director of I
| the Hoover War Library, expressed'
' the conviction that his organization
was "placing in the hands of students |
and scholars of generations to come
a very remarkable apparatus for an j
i understanding of the work of the
; Peace Conference which followed the
Great War."
Greatest Revelations
Professor Lutz characterized the j
Miller publication as a collection of
I "the greatest revelations ever made ,
j of the Conference of Paris."
The Miller publication contains, in
I addition to Dr. Miller's diary and
| other writings, more than 1000 im- j
portant documents, letters, tentative I
| drafts and photographs; reports of
j various commissions; excerpts from
! minutes of later meetings of the
| Supreme Council; and bulletins of
j the American Commission to Negoti- ■
! ate Peace. Practically none of the J
matter has hitherto been published
i and even now will be available only
! to a chosen few, from whom explana
i tions of the revelations may be ex
pected.
Efforts to bring to Stanford this
; work, which is climactic for the j
i Hoover Library, were originally
launched by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Stanford president and Secretary of
the Interior, and by Dr. Alonzo Engle
bert Taylor, Director of the Stanford
Food Research Institute.

brary, will make available to scholars
what is believed to be the most com

collection in existence. The first set
ot the numbered forty was retained

No. 2.
New Material Uncovered
Unexplained phases and operations
of the Conference of Paris may now
be revealed with the placement in one
library of the Miller diary, the Her
ron Papers, and the valuable data of
the Supreme Economic Council.
The data of the Supreme Economic
Council completes the record of ne
gotiations and adjustments and casts
light over the entire field, heretofore
partially obscured. In presenting the
Miller diary to Stanford, Dr. Nicho
las Murray Butler, director of the
Carnegie Endowment, in a letter to j
Professor Ralph H. Lutz, director of I
| the Hoover War Library, expressed'
' the conviction that his organization
was "placing in the hands of students |
and scholars of generations to come
a very remarkable apparatus for an j
i understanding of the work of the
; Peace Conference which followed the
Great War."
Greatest Revelations
Professor Lutz characterized the j
Miller publication as a collection of
I "the greatest revelations ever made ,
j of the Conference of Paris."
The Miller publication contains, in
I addition to Dr. Miller's diary and
| other writings, more than 1000 im- j
portant documents, letters, tentative I
| drafts and photographs; reports of
j various commissions; excerpts from
! minutes of later meetings of the
| Supreme Council; and bulletins of
j the American Commission to Negoti- ■
! ate Peace. Practically none of the J
matter has hitherto been published
i and even now will be available only
! to a chosen few, from whom explana
i tions of the revelations may be ex
pected.
Efforts to bring to Stanford this
; work, which is climactic for the j
i Hoover Library, were originally
launched by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Stanford president and Secretary of
the Interior, and by Dr. Alonzo Engle
bert Taylor, Director of the Stanford
Food Research Institute.
