# KRENZ SMASHES WORLD DISCUS RECORD WITH 163 FOOT THROW
## Eric's Long Toss of 163 Feet 8 7/8 Inches Betters Former Mark by More Than Five Feet; Templeton's Track Men Triumph Over Olympic Club Team by 84½ to 46½ Score 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
A NOTHER of Coach Dink Templeton's athletes was crowned a world cham
pion Saturday afternoon in the Stadium when Eric Krenz with a mighty
heave of 163 feet 8 7-8 inches smashed the discus record. It was not by
inches hut by more than five feet that the curly-haired Cardinal weightman
eclipsed the mark of 158 feet 1 3-4 inches established by Bud Houser of U.S.C.
from the same circle in 1926.
Krenz further aided his teammates to defeat Coach Charley Hunter's
Olympic Club track and field men by a score of 84*4 to 46% points by
putting the shot 50 feet % inch for a first place in this event. Harlow Rothert's

♦>toss or 4y reet y% inches was only
good for a second.
Eric's world record performance
was made against the wind and with
I a discus weighing 1 1-10 ounces more
j than the minimum of 4 pounds and
6 4-10 ounces required by the A.A.U.
After much measuring and remeasur
ing, weighing and reweighing, the
Pacific Association officials, headed by
John Eliot, A1 Katchinski, and Clar
ence Smith, appeared satisfied that
the conditions under which the throw
was made were perfect and said that
they would apply immediately for a
record in Krenz's behalf.
Alex McKinnon definitely indicated
that he is on the way to a comeback
by beating Brack of the Olympic Club
to the tape in the mile in 4:33 4-5
j without straining. Alex let Brack and
Shine of the Club set the pace for the
first three laps and then opened up
with a nice sprint in the fourth.
Dyer Wins By Yard
Russ Sweet, Olympian sprinter,
started behind John Lauritzen of
Stanford in the hundred and had to
stretch to finish a half-yard ahead of
him in ten flat. Hec Dyer, long-legged
| sophomore, got away to a bad start
j and was able to get no better than
third; but in the two-twenty he made
' up for it by pulling away from Sweet
i to win by a yard in 21 4-5.
j The quarter-mile lived up to all pre
j dictions and proved to be the feature
I track event of the day. Johnny Mor
rison, who gave Bud Spencer many
close runs last year, ran a heady race
to finish six yards in front of Bill
i Storie of the Olympics in the excel
| lent time of 48 4-5 s.
Ward Edmonds went over the high
! hurdles in nice fashion to win from
his teammate, Podge Smith, in
i 15 2-5 s. Smith won the low barrier
'race with many yards to spare from
! Bullis and Johnson of the Club in the
! time of 25 1-5. In both of the hurdle
' events Captain Ross Nichols was
' really the winner, but because of an
i eligibility technicality his points were
not counted.
King Wins High Jump
j Leo Kibby, Stanford javelin tosser,
I notwithstanding the fact that he has
been nursing an injured arm for some
! time, hurled the spear 192 feet 6
inches, outdistancing Perelli-Minetti,
(sophomore, by nine feet.
Ward Edmonds was not in the best
I of form in the pole vault, having diffi
culty in clearing 13 feet. Bob King,
undefeated Stanford high jumper last
; year, leaped 6 ft. 3 3-8 in. to take a
1 first for the Olympic Club.
Bob Brown finished strong in the
two-mile, winning by a good margin
from Keegan, Club eight-lap man, in
the time of 10:06. Art Holman, San
: Francisco prep flash, ran a fast half
mile, finishing the distance in 1:58.
Neikirk and Jennings of Stanford
threatened Holman in the final sprint
I but were unable to catch him.
