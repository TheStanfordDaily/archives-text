"Is there anyone in your house
named Bob?"
Last Friday night the members
of a certain fraternity house
were greatly distressed over a
telephone message announcing
that a member of the fraternity
had been seriously injured in an
automobile accident, and was in
the hospital calling for someone
named "Bob."
Immediately several of the
members of this fraternity who
did not happen to be listening to
Russian folk songs in the Assem
bly or pretending they were mem
bers of the French Foreign Le
gion in the Pavilion, put down
their books and hurried to the
hospital.
Consternation and rage reigned
supreme when they discovered
the loyal members of at least ten
fraternities parading in the hos
pital for their mythical brother
who was calling for "Bob."
A certain student makes a sug
gestion to all future practical
pranksters that would-be-hurt
fraternity brothers cry always
for "Horatio" or at least "Laun
celot."
