## 
### 
Interpretation of tlie moods ex
pressed in music, rather than panto- j
mime of any sort, will be emphasized ;
in the featured section of the Dance
Drama, presented tomorrow in the •
Assembly Hall in place of the regu
lar Tuesday evening lecture. Schu- j
belt's Unfinished Symphony is the
theme, and through the dancing the
feeling behind the music will be ex
pressed.
There are two movements, each
perfect in detail. The first is light at
the beginning, but with an underlying
current representing the footsteps of
fate, which recurs throughout the
composition. Then follow the soft,
serious strains of the love theme, for
which the Symphony is noted. The
second movement has two parts, the
first patterned, and characterized by
many intricate steps; and the second,
in contrast, is spontaneous and free.
The two blend together, forming a
final pictorial group just before the
end, with all the dancers on the stage,
in the manner of the orchestra instru
ments in a symphony.
