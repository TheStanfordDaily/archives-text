The time-honored institution of Roughs at dances justified its exis
tence in a new manner at the Military Ball Friday night. Renowned
photographer, Burt Davis, playfully shot off enough flash-light powder
to photograph the entire peninsula. The powder, a bit recalcitrant, shot
up into the draperies, catching them afire. The Roughs rallied to the
cause and tore down the flaming draperies, thus preventing the lire
spreading to the Pavilion roof or consuming all the draperies.
At the California boxing bouts this same photographer endangered
bystanders with another, explosion of flash-light powder. All of which
is most amusing to a certain type of mind no doubt, yet so is bomb
throwing amusing to a maniac. Through Orville 11. Tucker, engineer
of the Board of Athletic Control, Davis lias been denied future photo
graphic rights in the Pavilion and other campus buildings. This action
is certainly justified. Any photographer who is not proficient enough to
avoid jeopardizing the welfare of people near his camera and to avoid
starting fires in buildings should not be allowed to take pictures.
