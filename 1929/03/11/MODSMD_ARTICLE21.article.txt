# "Stanford Was A Battlefield"

### 
Ripley, professor of applied monstrosities and searcher into the realm
of the impossible, would turn a mental handspring of pure envy were
lie to find that "believe it or not" "the battle of Palo Alto was fought on
the site where Stanford University now stands." But then, we'll let
Mr. C.1. D. Moore, one-time professor at the University of Southern
California, and now vice-president of the Pacific Mutual,,. insurance
corporation ,tell the story. The Daily prints Mr. Moore's article in the
interests of history, believing that it here has found a new and really
most startling addition to that subject as related to the Old Farm.
OUT OF THE PAST
(Reprinted from the Pacific Mutual News)
"Had you ever heard of the Battle of Palo Alto? I had not until
quite recently, when Mr. F. Strange Kolle, Jr., a young man in the
advertising business in Los Angeles, called my attention to a picture
and an acount of it in an old history in his father's library. 'Pictorial
1 listory of the New World' is the name of the book. It is evidently long
since out of print.
"It appears that the battle of Palo Alto was fought on the site where
Stanford University now stands. The little hamlet is spoken of as a
'watering-place.' It was on May 8, 1846, so the story runs, that General
Zachary Taylor, with about 2 ( )00 men, engaged in battle nearly 6000
Mexicans. The engagement was almost entirely an artillery duel. The
Mexicans had a heavy cavalry force, which they were not able to bring
into action.
"An interesting incident during the conflict was the laying of a smoke
screen from the firing of the dry grass by the violent cannonading,
which completely hid the two armies from each other for the space of
about one hour. This interval gave each general the opportunity to form
a new line of battle, so that when the atmo-phere cleared the action was
resumed with increased vigor.
"The American loss in this battle was nine killed and forty-six
wounded. The record says that the slaughter amongst the dense masses
of Mexican cavalry was very great.
"The Battle of Palo Alto was the opening engagement of the Mexican
War, which continued a couple of years and was closed by the treaty of
Guadalupe Hidalgo, February 2, 1848, by virtue of which this great
southwestern country passed into the hands of the United States.'
Now isn't that just grand. The facts are all there except one, which
Historiographer Moore overlooked: the Battle of Palo Alto was fought
at Palo Alto, Mexico, not Palo Alto, California. A slight error of some
thousand miles .And Palo Alto, California, the "little hamlet," became
a municipality in 1894 and received its charter in 1 ( )0'). In 184(> it was a
large field. A battlefield, Mr. Moore?
