The Editor, Sir:
"One Who Suffers" should Ret the
facts in the case before he essays to
condemn. Mr. Marra has required too
much work for a one-hour course. The
fact of the matter is, however, that
Mr. Marra's is not a ONE-hour course.
He lectures once a week in a five
hour course, and his assignments are
admittedly one-half of the total he
cause it seemed wise to the under
signed to so arrange the work.
Certain students asked special per
mission to take only the work given
by Mr. Marra and it was agreed that
they might do so, receiving therefor
one hour of credit. It has been little
more satisfactory to the instructors

|to have these one-hour students in
: the conrse than it seems to have been
Ito "One Who Suffers" to be in it.
Manifestly we cannot type the course
for these few, and would be glad to
have them take some other work.
It seems unfortunate that any writ
j er who has a complaint cannot dis
cuss the matter in hand, without re
sorting to ungentlemanly personal re
| marks.
