# The 						Bullsession
## A 						NOBLE GESTURE 
### 
It would appear from newspaper
dispatches that President Hoover is
commencing a campaign of enforce
ment which will make this country
drier than the Literary Digest. Please
pass the salt.
We can't believe that the President
is so Quixotic aB to imagine that such
a thing is possible, and therefore we
must conclude that this is just an
other political gesture.
But if the dry campaign does be
come more than a gesture, it will be
interesting to watch developments in
San Francisco, where the President
has many friends who worked loyally
for his election and who like a shot
of soinething-or-other now and then.
We doubt if he would be so ungrate
ful as to extend the campaign to San
Francisco.
We don't mean to insinuate that the
City isn't dry; for, as Mayor Rolph
remarked, "Why, I don't know where
I would get a drink in San Francisco."
If ingratitude does extend to San
Francisco, we suggest that the Fed
eral Prohibition force in that city be
increased to a thousand. That many
operatives could, by working twenty
four hours a day, keep San Francisco
fairly dry. Of course this excepts
home brew, straight alcohol, bay rum,
prescriptions, wine tonics, gasoline,
and canned heat.
It would also be necessary to do
something about the psychology of
many of the citizens, who, otherwise
harmless, think that Prohibition is a
sort of fabled monster like the Loup

| Garou or the Flying Dutchman. For
I example: when asked if the establish
ment has ever been raided, the wife
'of a San Francisco bootlegger said,
i "Yes —and they took us down to the
' police station and treated us just
I like we were criminals!"
The rest of the citizens, knowing
that good Bourbon is a crime against
J God, shrug their shoulders and take
! their chances with God direct, ignor
i ing the middlemen.
Such a civic attitude is very, very
bad. San Francisco ought to be the
, most immoral city in the country.
Oddly enough it isn't. In fact, it is
one of the most decent. Compare it
j with Los Angeles, where natives
I point with stentorian pride to their
! aridity and righteousness, and where
there are fifty-seven kinds of grafters,
extortionists, grand larceny bankers,
shyster lawyers, unusual folks, and
i crooked district attorneys.
Los Angeles is a poor argument for
the virtues of Prohibition. So is San
Francisco,
It took thousands of high-minded
moralists a hundred years to write
Prohibition into the poor old rundown
Constitution. It will probably require
another fifty years to restore national
decency by erasing it.
Meanwhile, the oustanding results
of ten years of Noble Experimentation
have been that police corruption has
enormously increased, and that Ameri
cans, gulping anything, have lost
their taste for good liquor.

It would appear from newspaper
dispatches that President Hoover is
commencing a campaign of enforce
ment which will make this country
drier than the Literary Digest. Please
pass the salt.
We can't believe that the President
is so Quixotic aB to imagine that such
a thing is possible, and therefore we
must conclude that this is just an
other political gesture.
But if the dry campaign does be
come more than a gesture, it will be
interesting to watch developments in
San Francisco, where the President
has many friends who worked loyally
for his election and who like a shot
of soinething-or-other now and then.
We doubt if he would be so ungrate
ful as to extend the campaign to San
Francisco.
We don't mean to insinuate that the
City isn't dry; for, as Mayor Rolph
remarked, "Why, I don't know where
I would get a drink in San Francisco."
If ingratitude does extend to San
Francisco, we suggest that the Fed
eral Prohibition force in that city be
increased to a thousand. That many
operatives could, by working twenty
four hours a day, keep San Francisco
fairly dry. Of course this excepts
home brew, straight alcohol, bay rum,
prescriptions, wine tonics, gasoline,
and canned heat.
It would also be necessary to do
something about the psychology of
many of the citizens, who, otherwise
harmless, think that Prohibition is a
sort of fabled monster like the Loup

| Garou or the Flying Dutchman. For
I example: when asked if the establish
ment has ever been raided, the wife
'of a San Francisco bootlegger said,
i "Yes —and they took us down to the
' police station and treated us just
I like we were criminals!"
The rest of the citizens, knowing
that good Bourbon is a crime against
J God, shrug their shoulders and take
! their chances with God direct, ignor
i ing the middlemen.
Such a civic attitude is very, very
bad. San Francisco ought to be the
, most immoral city in the country.
Oddly enough it isn't. In fact, it is
one of the most decent. Compare it
j with Los Angeles, where natives
I point with stentorian pride to their
! aridity and righteousness, and where
there are fifty-seven kinds of grafters,
extortionists, grand larceny bankers,
shyster lawyers, unusual folks, and
i crooked district attorneys.
Los Angeles is a poor argument for
the virtues of Prohibition. So is San
Francisco,
It took thousands of high-minded
moralists a hundred years to write
Prohibition into the poor old rundown
Constitution. It will probably require
another fifty years to restore national
decency by erasing it.
Meanwhile, the oustanding results
of ten years of Noble Experimentation
have been that police corruption has
enormously increased, and that Ameri
cans, gulping anything, have lost
their taste for good liquor.
