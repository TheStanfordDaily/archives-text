The Romance of Leonardo da Vinci.
By Dmitri Merejkowski. (New
York: The Modern Library. 1923.)
This is the only direct translation
j of this outstanding historical novel,
; considered the best among Russian
j literature. Read this book and learn
| the scandal of the Borgias and the de
Medicis, learn to hate Michelangelo,
to esteem Mona Lisa, and become ac
quainted with Machiavelli, Savana
i rola, and Raphael. Leonardo's great-
I est work, a colossus which took him
sixteen years, was destroyed before
his eyes, so learn where his colossal
inferiority complex came from.
The burning of one hundred and
thirty-six witches by the Inquisition;
witches' wild night ride on the Great
Goat, after smearing their bodies with
swamp smallage, hemlock, bane-wort,
henbane, serpents' blood, and the fat
of unchristened infants, tortured to
death by the sorceresses; Leonardo's
airplanes; human dissection — these
are the contrasts by which Merej
kowski typifies the Renaissance.
The Church? Machiavelli speaks:
"Let not the monks nigh women! Do
ye not know how easily fat takes fire,
and how the holy fathers love not
only to have the beauties merely call
them fathers, but actually make them
so?" Pope Borgia, Alexander VI, had
a large emerald set in his Crucifix
engraved with Venus of the Beautiful
Buttocks. It was used to bless the
people during Mass; and, in this fash
ion, in kissing the Crucifix, he also
kissed the beautiful goddess.
Probably the most significant thing
in this book, ]n light of the present
| Age of Airpianes, is Leonardo's in
terest in flying, shown both scien
| tifically. He built several airplanes,
land in his advanced thinking, Wings
for Humanity became the ultimate
aim of all his life. "One has but to
know —there shall be wings!" "The
spirit has not lied: those who have
attained knowledge, the winged ones,
shall be even as gods!"

Bandits and the Southern Pacific. By
C. B. Glasscock. (New York: Fred-'
erick A. Stokes Company, 1929.)
$2.50.
In 1870 in King's County, California,
a fight took place between officers
representing the railroads of the state
and settlers representing their homes
and their grievances, which was to be
the first of a weary, endless series of
tragedies of this kind.
Mr. Glasscock's book opens with
this story—a bloody, horrible story,
for every participant in the fight was
killed. But the pages that follow nar
rate still more lurid tales. The book
is a succession of brutal vengeances
and cold-blooded murders. For most
of the way it is hair-raising melo
drama, sheer and undisguised, with
only one quality to distinguish it from
the ordinary variety of dime novel.
That is its claim to truth—a claim
which is justified, for the reason that
the material facts were taken from
newspaper files of two large old state
libraries.
The framework in general of the
account may be accepted as authen
tic. However, the details that paint
the narrative so frightful a red, Mr.
Glasscock has possibly supplied from
a generous and vivid imagination.
The result is a story of bandits, train
robbery, killings, manhunts, and jail

breaks to satisfy the most blood
thirsty taste.
Looked at from another angle, it
is worth while in throwing light on
an important period in the develop- j
ment of the West. The history of its
railroads is the history of California, ,
claims the author. It was the rail
road construction, together with the j
subsidies, the politics, and monopo- j
listic aggression which accompanied i
it, that inspired the tragedies and the !
battles related in the book.
Mr. Glasscock emphatically asserts !
(hat he is not concerned with the mor- |
ai issue of the case of whether the
railroad was justified in the measures ,
it used, but he admits that wright or
wrong, the residents were turned bit
terly against the Southern Pacific.
The pioneers believed that the offi
cials were vicious anrl greedy and in
tent on what could only seem ruthless
robbery to them, and this belief
caused a decade or more of bloodshed
that turned the peaceful San Joaquin ;
Valley upside down.
While not absolutely free from ;
prejudice from this standpoint, for !
the desolation brought to the settlers
through the railroad is dwelt on at
some length, the book on the whole
presents a fair and comprehensive
account of a period which has long !
been viewed through bitterly biased ■
eyes.
