# HELVENSTON SHOWS MINIATURE MODELS OF STAGE SETTINGS
## Work of Design Class Will Exhibit the New Trend In Stage Scenery 
### 
Two miniature stages, on which
will be set several scenes complete in i
every detail, will be among the exhib- 1
its shown by Harold Helvenston in
the Little Theatre from 8 to 10 o'- !
clock tonight. The drawings and mod
els of stage settings which make up
the exhibition are the work of Hel- j
venston's ( scenic design class, and
those scenes which will be shown on
the stages will be lighted by a mini
ature lighting system, corresponding
exactly to that used in professional
theatres, which Helvenston designed
himself.
Six plays will be illustrated by mod- j
els and figures, executed in perfect j
scale. Two scenes from George Ber- |
nnrd Shaw's "St. Joan" and several j
of the settings for James Elroy Fleck- j
er's "Hassan" will be exhibited. Three !
of the models will illustrate two of
Shakespeare's plays—one being a j
semi-permanent setting of "Antony
and Cleopatra" and the others being
nettings for "Hamlet." Although these J
last two depict the same play, they
illustrate two different schools of
stage design, as one is done in the :
semi-permanent, expressionistic man-'
ner and the other in the permanent,
realistic style. A large setting for an i
open-air production of Stephen Phil- 1
lip's "Ulysses" will also be shown.
The sketches which will be exhibit-!
Ed are executed in almost every me
dium —pencil, charcoal, crayon, and
water color. There are series of;
drawings for Henrik Ibsen's "Peer'
Gvnt," Lord Dunsany's "If," and
Shaw's "St. Joan." There will also be !
sketches of Shakespeare's "Richard ;
HI," "Coriolanus," and "Hamlet," as
well as the Wagnerian opera, "The
Rhinegold."
As there are only two stages, it j
will be necessary to change the set
tings on them several times, so that
all the models may be lighted. In
doing this, the transition from scene j
to scene, with the consequent change ,
in lighting, will create the same im- i
pression that it would in a life-size
theatre. This exhibition of scenic de-'
sign. Helvenston says, is the first of
its kind to be shown here, and, as ;
well as showing the new trends in
stage scenery, he hopes that this dis
play will mark the nucleus of a group !
at the University for experiments in
dramatic productions.
