# 'LIT' COMES FORTH ON QUAD TODAY IN GAY COLORED GARB
## 
### 
In one of the most bizarre and loud
est colors that has ever appeared on
this campus, a conglomeration of ma
genta, mauve, lilac, cerise, and wine
red, the March number of the Stan
ford Literary Magazine will go on sale
on the Quad this morning. It is be
lieved that this odd color represents
the blend of the Stanford Red and the
regal purple of Stanford's literature
and was picked by the editor after he
had gazed at a red sunset over the
purple mountains of La Honda.
The book itself is considered by the
editorial staff to be one of the best
issues for some time. Robert Clarke's
short story, "The Gang," is one of
those meant for high school graduates
and university high-hats. And Harold
Helvenston's article on stage scenery
is just the thing to read to pass that
Public Speaking final for an "A."
But remember, wear smoked glasses!
