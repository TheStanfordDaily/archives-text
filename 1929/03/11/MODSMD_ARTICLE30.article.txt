A slender brunette from the Illinois
Women's Athletic Club, of Chicago,
proved to be one of the sensations of
the recent senior women's indoor na
tional swimming championships. The
Illinois Athletic Club, long the leader
in men's swimming, with its I.W.A.C.
is now closely contesting the claim
of the Women's Swimming Associa
tion of New York as leader among the
girl natators. In Jane Fauntz, young
and pretty diving and breast-stroke
champion, the Chicago club has the
first winner in national championship
history of both the low-board diving
title and the 100-yard breast-stroke.
Jane Fauntz was a member of the
United States Olympic swimming
team last summer, but did not startle
the athletic world with her perform
ances at Amsterdam. But don't be too
quick in saying that she won't be an
Olympic champion in 1932. She made
many friends, saw a little of the
world, added to her postage stamp
collection, and gained considerably in
swimming experience. As 1 remember
her, she was always going around
with Josephine McKim, and they
looked as alike two peas.
In the recent national indoor meet,
Jane defeated Georgia Coleman, sec
ond in two Olympic diving events, in
the fancy low-board championship,

and, after a short rest, came from be
hind to win the 100-yard breast-stroke
title in 1:21 4-5, just two and two
lifths seconds more than Agnes
Geraghaty's world's record. In this
race she defeated Katherine Mearls,
the defending champion. Jane won
second in the 220-yard breast-stroke
event in the outdoor senior champion
ships last year, and is the junior out
door fancy diving title-holder.
