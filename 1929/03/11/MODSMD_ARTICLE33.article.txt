"The pleasure your friends take in
your success is the nicest part of
nil," thinks "Bob" Elerbeck Rouver
all, whose play "Skidding" has been
running in New York since last May, |
and is now showing at the Alcazar in j
San Francisco,
Mrs. Rouverall is a Stanford grad
uate and was active in campus dra
matics, taking leads in "She Stoops to
Conquer," "Two Gentlemen of Ve
rona," and "Arms and the Man."
While here she founded Masquers So
ciety.
After leaving Stanford, she played
in stock on the west coast for a
year, and then went to Broadway as
Meg in "Little Women," following
Alice Brady in the part. She has
studied with George Baker at the
Harvard Workshop, and later directed
plays at the Marta Oatman School of
the Theatre in Los Angeles.
"How did you come to write 'Skid
ding'?" Mrs. Rouverall was asked.
I had prepared all mv life to
write a play—l had studied the drama
and theatre from every angle, and de
cided it was time to come through."
"How does it seem to have a play on
Broadway?" "It is fun to go and hear
the audience laugh," she confessed.
"But I am much prouder of having
written the words to 'Come Join the
Band'!"
Although this is her first big play,
Mrs. Rouverall's one-act play "Thorns
of Arcady" was produced by the The
atre. Guild in St. Louis, and another,
"The Price of Love," was published
in a drama magazine.
Just now the autnor of "Skidding"
is more interested in her two young
sters, Jean and Billy, and in tennis
than in writing plays. "Thank heaven
1 have done it now and can sit back
and take a long breath!" she ex-'
claimed. "I shall write another play
when the mood strikes me —but 1 like
directing better than writing."
Mrs. Rouverall's home is in Los
Angeles, but she came to San Fran-

Cisco for a few clays for the opening
of her play. She was on the campus
Wednesday night attending a ban
quet at the Delta Gamma house where
she talked a little of "Skidding" hut
seemed far more interested in memo
ries of Stanford.
