# Russian Quartet Well Received In Friday's Concert
## Singers Respond Generously To Ardent Applause of College Audience 
### Sylva Weaver 
Stanford had a night of pure musi- [
cal enjoyment last Friday when the j
Kedroff quartet brought the spirit of
old and New Russia to the campus !
in their concert in the Assembly Hall.
It is to be doubted that the numerous
crowned heads of Europe before
whom the quartet have often sung, de
rived any more real pleasure from ;
the singing than did the capacity
audience which filled the Assembly
to hear what one critic has so aptly
called "the voice of Russia singing."
The singers, I. K. Denissoff, T. K.
Kasakoff, N. N. Kedroff, and C. N.
Kedroff, seemed to take great delight j
in the sympathy of the audience, and
were gracious in their frequent en- j
cores. The ardent applause following
each number was a tribute from an |
American college audience to the :
quartet's power of artistic interpreta- ,
tion. The audience fell under the spell
of four exceptionally fine voices
whose bits of spirited rhythmic folk
songs, mystic chants of splendor, and
soft lyric love songs rose to heights
of musical art.
Many of the folk-songs were only a
string of jingling rhymes but they had
a peculiar charm in the lilt and im
petuosity of the rhythmical measures.
An extremely fast metre occurred in
I "The Circle and Dance Song," and the
j "Little Duckling." All the folk-songs
have been taken directly from the 1
peasant villages where the ancient
customs of gathering in the streets
and singing in choruses on fete days j
j still linger on. The old Russian bal
! lads have been handed down orally
j for generations.
The audience's familiarity with the
j "Song of the Volga Boatmen" en
hanced its enjoyment of the Kedroff
I arrangement of the old chant which !
follows as closely as possible the i
original spirit of the monottonous la- ;
boring chant of men towing the heavy j
I boats.
"The Bells of Novgorod" was sung
with sympathy and strength, and was |
remarkable for its superbly realistic
bell effects. The shading of the bell- i
: tones and the subtle variations of in
flection in the musical theme of Luka
j and the fair maiden who tolled the
bells, were excellent.
There was a mystic note in Glazou
nc.v's "Prayer of the Disciples of
| Jesus." A yearning spirit, almost plain
tiff at times, characterized the prayer,
and yet there was a touch in it of
the romance and color which play a
large part in the Christian devotion
of the Russian people.
Cesar Cui's "Summer Noon" with
| its languid lyric quality, while not
typically Russian, and Borodin's
I "Serenade of Four Gentlemen to a
! Lady," were particularly effective, j
The individual interpretations in the !
| serenade caused much laughter in the
audience. The "Song of India" was I
given exquisitely as an encore.
The presentation of the Kedroff 1
1 quartet proved quite an event in the
i University's musical life, and the
I Committee on Public Exercises as
j well as the donor of the concert are
1 to be thanked heartily for securing
i the Russian singers.
