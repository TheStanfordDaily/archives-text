Haul in the gang plank
-we are on our way!
Swarms of busy little tugs guiding a great liner out New York harbor
—the open sea —and ON TO EUROPE! Eight days of delight on
shipboard . . . then gay Pans . . . the Riviera in festive season . . .
ancient Rome . . . the gondolas of Venice . . . towering, snowy
Alps .. . Brussels .. . London town —a world of romance and
adventure is awaiting members of our 1930 On-To-Europe Club.
What is the 1930 On-To-Europe Club?
It is a new and ingenious travel plan devised by the Travel
Bureau of the American Trust Company. It offers a glorious trip
to Europe to everyone who can save $200 in regular installments
before March 1, 1930, and also a personally conducted tour of the
Continent who can save a slightly larger sum.
And more, it offers a free trip to Europe to one member in every
group of twenty-six, and also, the conducted tour, free of cost, to
one in every group of fifteen members.
Membership is open to everyone. Your money earns full interest.
If you receive the award of the free trip, or if you decide not to go
your funds are returned—plus interest.
You will want to know more about this wonderful plan—the
itineraries —the ship—the tour —the rules and the cost —and, of
course, all about the free trips.
Just write or phone for a copy of the explanatory booklet, "The
1930 On-To-Europe Club," or drop in and ask for a copy.
