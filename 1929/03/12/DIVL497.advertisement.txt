No other gasoline will give the performance of Ethyl! ffig
Ethyl compound was perfected after seven years intensive research ufl
in the great laboratories of the General Motors Corporation—after ffl
the testing of more than 33,000 separate formulas. Prior to i» fl
discovery, high compression motors were commercially imprac
tical while today, as the result of Ethyl, high compression per- fl
formance is available in more than 68% of all automobiles manu- JH
facturcd. Forty-two of the greatest oil companies in the world fl
have endorsed Ethyl and add it to their finest gasoline. fl
Ethyl gasoline will improve the performance of any car. With Ethyl, H
carbon deposits actually increase the power and efficiency of old H
style motors, and to secure maximum efficiency from modern high fl
compression motors, Ethyl is an absolute necessity. The many ad- fl
vantages of Ethyl are easily proved in your own car—greater speed, H
power and acceleration, easier driving with less gear shifting in H
traffic and on hills, and the elimination of the destructive, annoy
ing vibration that hastens the depreciation of your motor
Do not be misled by imitators who attempt to capitalize on the
recognition given Ethyl. Your protection is the genuine Ethyl trade
mark on every Ethyl pump. Try Ethyl today for a new thrill in
