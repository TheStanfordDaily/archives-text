# MAJOR SEGRAVE SHATTERS SPEED MARK FOR AUTOS
## "Golden Arrow" Driven to New Record of 231 Miles Per Hour at Daytona Driver Negotiates Course of One Mile in Average Time Of Less Than 16 Seconds 
### 
OCEAN SPEEDWAY, DAYTONA
BEACH, Fla., March 11. (/P)—ln a
streak of superspeed, Major H. O. D.
Segrave, famous British racetrack
driver, today set a new world's speed
record for automobiles by sending his
Golden Arrow machine roaring over
the hard, wave-lapped ocean speedway
here at the tremendous speed of
231.36246 miles an hour.
Driving his glistening 12-cylinder
machine at a dazzling pace, Major
Segrave eclipsed by 23.81 miles an
hour the former record of 207.55 set
here last year by Ray Keech, of Phila
delphia, in the 26-cylinder Triplex
owned by J. M. White. The new mark
also surpassed by 28 miles an hour
the record of 203 which Segrave set
here in 1927 with his Sunbeam Spe
cial.
On his first official run nort-h, Ma
jor Segrave literally burned up the
course when he negotiated the meas
ured mile in 15.55 seconds for the
amazing speed of 231.51125 miles an
hour. His second trial, made south
ward over the course, was clocked at
15.57 seconds for a speed of 231.21387
miles an hour.
The two trials, which were timed
and sanctioned by the American
Automobile Association, were without
incident and were staged under only
fairly good weather conditions before
thousands of spectators, who lined
the sand dunes for miles parallel to
the course.
Visibility was not perfect, however,
and the beach course was a little
rough in spots. A brisk east wind was
blowing 1 directly off the ocean, which
tended to help Segrave keep his ma
chine from running too far out on the
course while traveling at such a tre
mendous speed.

hour. His second trial, made south
ward over the course, was clocked at
15.57 seconds for a speed of 231.21387
miles an hour.
The two trials, which were timed
and sanctioned by the American
Automobile Association, were without
incident and were staged under only
fairly good weather conditions before
thousands of spectators, who lined
the sand dunes for miles parallel to
the course.
Visibility was not perfect, however,
and the beach course was a little
rough in spots. A brisk east wind was
blowing 1 directly off the ocean, which
tended to help Segrave keep his ma
chine from running too far out on the
course while traveling at such a tre
mendous speed.
