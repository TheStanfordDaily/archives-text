# HELVENSTON EXHIBIT IS FIRST OF ITS TYPE ON STANFORD CAMPUS
## 
### 
In the first exhibit of stage designs
and model sets presented last night ;
at the Little Theatre by Harold Hel- !
venston's course in scenic design, 1
plans ranged from traditional straight :
realism to ultra impressionistic and ;
abstract sketches.
Five model sets, built on a one-inch I
scale, lighted with a model lighting 1
system, were shown. The epilogue of
"St. Joan," by Shaw, was built by '
Alma H. Steininger, in a colorful but ;
realistic manner. Two scenes from ;
"Hassan," done in an imaginative !
style, were shown by Grace Adams.
A permanent set for "Hamlet," es- !
pecially showing the variations pos- j
sible by lighting changes, was exe
cuted by John Rogers with a colorful
doll tableau by Hallie Keating.
Another "Hamlet" set was exhibited
and described by Arthur Hurt. This
set was constructionistic, semi perma
nent, and probably the most strongly '
modernistic of all the offerings.
Other sets by Harriet Sutton, "Peer
Gynt," Maragert Meyer, "Ulysses,"
and a model of the Elizabethan thea- i
tre by Mrs. David Patrick were ex
hibited.
There was also a display of sketch- j
es, designs, and floor plans for the
models. This is the first exhibition of
its type on the Stanford campus. I
