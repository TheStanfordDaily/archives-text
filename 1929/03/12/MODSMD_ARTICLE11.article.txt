# MEXICAN GOVERNMENT ASSERTS REVOLUTION HAS BEEN CRUSHED
## Rebel General Aguirre Will Face Firing Squad; Calles Pushes Northward 
### 
j MEXICO CITY, March 11. (£>)—' The
! government tonight held the opinion
I that the backbone of the revolution
j had been broken, and ni this most of
. the best-informed foreign observers ;
| here concurred. The government look-1
ed for the fall of the rebel cities of j
| Torreon and Durango, possibly with-1
i out serious battle, within 48 hours. J
It sees no chance of a rebel victory !
and believes that within a week the 1
situation will be merely one of wiping !
out scattered groups in the states of j
Chihuahua, Sonora, and possibly |
| Coahuila.
No intimation that the big north- j
I ward push has yet begun has been |
j received here. The great army com- j
manded by General Plutarco Elias j
! Calles continued to rest at Canitas
while laborers worked day and night
j to repair railroads preparatory to the
advance upon Torreon and Durango.
i Judging by the trend which affairs
| took at Vera Cruz and Canitas, federal
i officials believed that a considerable
j number of soldiers in the rebel north
■ ern armies were serving under com
j pulsion and would revert to the fed
eral cause at the first opportunity.
Dr. Jose Manuel Puig Casauianc,
who acted as the government spokes
man, said that nothing new had been
reported from the main federal army
j led by Secretary of War Plutarco
Elias Calles. This army was known
; to be continuing its northward ad
j vance on Torreon and Dr. Puig said
j that he was not surprised to hear
j rumors that General Gonzalo Escobar
j had evacuated Coahuila City. He said,
j however, that he had no definite re
port of their withdrawal.
The same communique announced
the capture of Rebel General Simon
i Aguirre in the southern part of the
| state of Vera Cruz. Several of his offi
, cers were also taken but his brother,
; Jesus M. Aguirre, Avho led the revolt
| in that state, was not captured. Simon
; will be court-martialed and probably
will face a firing squad as have the
I other rebel leaders captured.
A manifesto condemning the pres
ent revolution was issued tonight by
j the Obregonista bloc of the Chamber
lof Deputies, which was considered !
i significant here in view of the fact
j that some former followers of the
j late Alvaro Obregon are leading the !
i revolution in Sonora.
The legitimacy of the government i
I of President Portes Gil was declared !
j to be free from the slightest blemish !
; and to have been recognized by the |
| entire country, including the army i
and by all foreign nations.
