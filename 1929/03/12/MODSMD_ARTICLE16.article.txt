1 having any regular practice sessions,
but immediately after the last exami
nation will leave for the Southland
! to compete with the baseball teams of
! the southern division of the Califor
nia Intercollegiate Baseball Associa
j tion.
Coach Harry Wolter has completed
: the list of men to make the trip, with
i the exception of two players whom
he has not yet decided upon. Lewis,
Kern, Taylor, Simkins, Story, and
j Smalling are the pitchers who will
go S}outh. Inflelders Cook, Churchill,
| Johnson, Laird, and Crawford; out
fielders, llunken, Wilton, Berg, and

| the roster for the Southern invasion.
Wolter will select another catcher and
| outfielder to complete the squad.
The Cards will meet the Bakers
field town loam Monday, March 25, in
their initial contest. Spud Harder has
j been elected to do the chucking

! against his home-town horsehide
; smackers, and promises to let them
, down with very few safeties. Johnson,
- ' who lias also cavorted around the
I ; Bakersfleld pastures at times, will
" j play against some former teammates,
-j The U.C.L.A. Bruins will furnish op
- 1 position for the Redshirts on March
