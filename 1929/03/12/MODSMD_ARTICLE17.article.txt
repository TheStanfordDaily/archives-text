# CARD TRACK TEAM WILL TRAIN HERE BEFORE NORTHERN MEET
## Husky Squad, of Unknown Strength, Will Be Seen at Seattle March 28 in Season Debut; Nichols vs. Anderson in Hurdles Duel Is Big Attraction of Coming Meet in North 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
CJTANFORD track and field men after soundly thumping the Olympic Club team
here Saturday in a remarkably good early-season meet, will remain on the cam
pus during most of the spring vacation practicing for their dual meet with the
University of Washington at Seattle March 28. The Cards will probably entrain
for the north Tuesday, March 26.
The meet with Stanford will be the Huskies' first appearance on the track this
year, and as yet comparatively little is known as to the strength of their team.

' Reports arc that Coach Hec Edmundson
is developing one of the most promising
squads seen at Seattle in many years.
What news has reached Stanford con
cerning the Huskies has been principally
in regard to track men, with little infor
mation concerning the field athletes.
Steve Anderson, one of the best colle
giate hurdlers in the United States, will
be certain to give Captain Ross Nichols,
intercollegiate high hurdles champion, two
closc races in both of the barrier events.
In the two-mile Edmundson has Elbert
Sellers, Bob Reed, and Jack Cram, all of
whom are said to be able to do the eight
laps in 9:50. Brown and Loofbourow
will have to speed up considerably to
score any Stanford points against such
a trio.
In the remainder of the track events—•
the mile, quarter mile, half mile, and
sprints — the Washington runners will
meet up against plenty of competition.
Alex McKinnon should take care of the
mile capably for the Cards, while Nei
kirk, Jennings, and French will probably
be the Stanford entries in the half-mile.
Jennings and Neikirk both ran the 880 in
under two minutes against the Olympic
Club.
After watching Johnny Morrison run
easily to a 48 4-5 second victory in the
4-10 Saturday, it can scarcely be amiss to
| call him the successor to Bud Spencer as
the fastest collegiate quarter miler on
the coast. Coach Edmundson of Wash
ington is said to have a sophomore won
der who has been running the quarter in
51 s. on an indoor track. He will have
to do better than that to beat Morrison.
Stanford's sprinters, Hec Dyer, John
Lauritzcn, and Alan McDermott, should
account for quite a number of points in
Seattle. C rosby Pendleton is Edmund
| son's best bet in the short dashes. He has
been clocked in eight seconds for seventy
five yards.
In the field with World Champion Eric
Krcnz and Harlow Rothert looking after
the weights; Edmonds the pole vault;
Dowell, Zombro, and West the broad
| jump; and Kibby, Sparling, and Perelli
| Minctti the javelin, chances of a Card
| defeat seem slight,
