; !
April 11, which is Thursday of the j
| second week of next quarter, has been j
j definitely set as the date for the Benefit
Vaudeville, instead of April 3, as was
originally announced. The program of
the show being presented by the three
campus dramatic societies — Masquers,
Ram's Head, and Sword and Sandals—!
will resemble the usual Football Gaieties,
!
] with skits, songs, and a pony chorus of I
i Masquers.
Not only will campus people be in the j
! production, but also several old members j
i will appear. Among these will be Charles
! Simons, who reappeared on the campus |
last fall in the "Gaieties," Charles Parks, I
one of the leads of an old Junior Opera, I
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys," and Aileen j
Burkes, who played in several campus j
musical shows a few years ago, and who j
now is Mrs. Charles Parks.
One of the main features of the Bene-1
fit Vaudeville—which is being given in (
order to raise money for the New The
atre for Stanford Fund—will be a skit
bringing in the leading characters of pre
vious campus plays of this season. In j
' many cases, Fenton Barrett, chairman of !
| the committee in charge, announces, these !
burlesques will be played by those who
portrayed the original characters. Other
features of the program will be spe-1
