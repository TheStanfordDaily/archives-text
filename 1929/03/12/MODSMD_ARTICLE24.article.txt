# The 						Literary Magazine

### 
Apropos of the Stanford Literary Magazine and its struggle to exist,
consider an article appearing in the New Student, current issue, by
Frederick A. Gutheim, entitled, "The Plight of the College 'Lit'."
Concerning its handicaps, Mr. Gutheim says, "It oilers nothing which
the buyer cannot get elsewhere. It has little of the provincialism which
makes the college daily, yearbook, or even humor publication indispen
sible. It cannot successfully appeal to the general student body if it
would maintain its literary character, without which it has little excuse
•for existence. It does not offer its staff the honor which other more pros
perous and more widely circulated publications do. As a rule it cannot
afford to pay its staff members as do other publications. 1 here are fewer
social advantages in working on the staff of the literary magazine than
on the staff of a larger organization and for many students work of this
sort is primarily an opportunity to meet people. All of this has a very
obvious result: an inferior publication."
And further 011 in his article. Mr. Gutheim says, speaking of the
writers for the literary magazines: "The writers of college literary maga
zines should seek to find in their own lives the dramatic, the genuine, the
unusual, the exciting. I his docs not mean that they should wr itc f<icilc
tales of fraternity parties, or roadsters, or raccoon coats, but that they
shall see the comedy, the tragedy, the futility, the value of college life in
both its academic and social aspects.
"Perhaps this is too much to expect of undergraduate writers. They
have been found notoriously poor in creative work. But when they can
see'the college community as an organism, and can set themselves think
ing about that organism and can creatively interpret that entity as they
see it, they will be doing genuinely fine writing*
In the past, the Stanford Literary Magazine seems to have had an
over-abundance of the qualities: morbidity, futility, and cynicism per
meating its pages. Add to this, attempts to write realistically of things
known of in a vague, vicarious fashion, and its general run of writing
cannot be said to measure up to the standard set by the critic, quoted
above.
Speaking of the financing of literary magazines, Mr. Gutheim states:
"Subsidy seems to be the only satisfactory method of meeting the recent
changes which have set the literary magazine at a disadvantage. Whether
the magazine be underwritten by the university, by some department of
the university, by advertisements, by becoming the organ of a group, by
private endowment, or by some loosely organized body as alumni or
former editors, makes little difference.
"It is clearly seen that in the face of the shifting character of the
college community the literary magazine has fallen from the high and
respected station which it held at one time. If we are to maintain the
institution, and it seems wise to do so, some compensation must be made
to equalize what at this time seems unfair discrimination."
This is one answer to a means of insuring the financial welfare of
the literary magazine. The matter of its content, as vital as its financial
support, must look for improvement from the student writers them
selves, who, when they have written well about what they know, will do
a great deal toward putting the literary magazine in a firm position in
student life.

tales of fraternity parties, or roadsters, or raccoon coats, but that they
shall see the comedy, the tragedy, the futility, the value of college life in
both its academic and social aspects.
"Perhaps this is too much to expect of undergraduate writers. They
have been found notoriously poor in creative work. But when they can
see'the college community as an organism, and can set themselves think
ing about that organism and can creatively interpret that entity as they
see it, they will be doing genuinely fine writing*
In the past, the Stanford Literary Magazine seems to have had an
over-abundance of the qualities: morbidity, futility, and cynicism per
meating its pages. Add to this, attempts to write realistically of things
known of in a vague, vicarious fashion, and its general run of writing
cannot be said to measure up to the standard set by the critic, quoted
above.
Speaking of the financing of literary magazines, Mr. Gutheim states:
"Subsidy seems to be the only satisfactory method of meeting the recent
changes which have set the literary magazine at a disadvantage. Whether
the magazine be underwritten by the university, by some department of
the university, by advertisements, by becoming the organ of a group, by
private endowment, or by some loosely organized body as alumni or
former editors, makes little difference.
"It is clearly seen that in the face of the shifting character of the
college community the literary magazine has fallen from the high and
respected station which it held at one time. If we are to maintain the
institution, and it seems wise to do so, some compensation must be made
to equalize what at this time seems unfair discrimination."
This is one answer to a means of insuring the financial welfare of
the literary magazine. The matter of its content, as vital as its financial
support, must look for improvement from the student writers them
selves, who, when they have written well about what they know, will do
a great deal toward putting the literary magazine in a firm position in
student life.
Apropos of the Stanford Literary Magazine and its struggle to exist,
consider an article appearing in the New Student, current issue, by
Frederick A. Gutheim, entitled, "The Plight of the College 'Lit'."
Concerning its handicaps, Mr. Gutheim says, "It oilers nothing which
the buyer cannot get elsewhere. It has little of the provincialism which
makes the college daily, yearbook, or even humor publication indispen
sible. It cannot successfully appeal to the general student body if it
would maintain its literary character, without which it has little excuse
•for existence. It does not offer its staff the honor which other more pros
perous and more widely circulated publications do. As a rule it cannot
afford to pay its staff members as do other publications. 1 here are fewer
social advantages in working on the staff of the literary magazine than
on the staff of a larger organization and for many students work of this
sort is primarily an opportunity to meet people. All of this has a very
obvious result: an inferior publication."
And further 011 in his article. Mr. Gutheim says, speaking of the
writers for the literary magazines: "The writers of college literary maga
zines should seek to find in their own lives the dramatic, the genuine, the
unusual, the exciting. I his docs not mean that they should wr itc f<icilc
