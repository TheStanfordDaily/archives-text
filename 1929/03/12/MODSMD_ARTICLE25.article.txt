# Make The Horse Drink
## 
### 
If there ever was a legitimate complaint against the compulsory
Ix»\ver Division requirement of physical education, the one appearing in
today's Campus Opinion is such.
Exercise is admittedly a fundamental requirement of health, whether
the individual is in the Upper or Lower Division. The dozen fancy
dishes in which exercise is served up to the student body should tempt
more students than they do, more, they should preclude the necessity of
requiring excrcise. They don't. The department of physical education
having led the horse to water must make him drink whether or not he
wants to, which in the interests of health is all right. Perhaps it
wouldn't be amiss to require a few of the lazier Upper Division students
to exercise.
But agreeing to all this, since it is exercise the department has ulti
mately in mind when it requires the lads to line up in their monkey suits
and do gymnastics, why can't it make allowance for the fellows who
spend two, three, or four hours a day digging gardens, sawing wood,
etc., etc.? There are 2000 students working to help support themselves;
of these, 439 support themselves entirely. These students aren't picking
daisies by the wayside during their college days. They cxcrcise.
As is the case with all systems, this, that requires so many hours to
he ground out by so many students, is rigid and disregards the individual,
for whom it was made. Clearly the individual is more important than
the whole bag and baggage of systems. Yet the invincible rule remains:
so many hours by so many students. Is Stanford for the individual, or
is the individual for Stanford?
