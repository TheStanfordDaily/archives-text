# Stanford No Richman's Son's College
## 
### 
Stanford can never be called the rich man's son's college. In sta
tistics compiled by the Appointment Secretary, it is shown that almost
two-thirds of the student body partially or wholly supports itself. Two
thousand of the 3482 students enrolled in Stanford are earning all or
part of their expenses.
The attitude has been taken that if a student must devote a large por
tion of his time to outside work he cannot do justice to his studies, nor
take part in student affairs.
The facts belie this. Fifty-seven per cent of the students work; fifty
three per cent of the students going on pro were in the self-supporting
group. As for extra-curricular activities, there are no data available. It
is believed that many students in the 2000 arc in activities as well as doing
their outside work and studying. To this group the Daily takes off its
hat and cheers.
Furthermore, the fact that two thousand students at Stanford are
willing to work at all kinds of outside tasks to put themselves through
certainly speaks well for the attitude of this sizeable majority of the stu
dent body. It proves that the majority of the student body wants an
education and is out to get ft.
If the carping critics of "flaming youth" and "foolhardy college boys"
would glance at figures like these once in a while instead of drawing their
conclusions from rumor and misrepresented journalistic pictures of stu
dents, they might quit their carping.
