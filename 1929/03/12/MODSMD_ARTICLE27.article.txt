# The 						Bullsession
## WHY BOTHER? 
### 
A lot of ponderous suggestions for !
methods of ending gangstrife in Chicago
liave come from all parts of the country.
Most of these suggestions have consisted
of four-cylinder words about the need
for better judicial methods, more respect j
for law, better mayors, district attorneys, |
and cops, scientific police supervision, and :
similar vague weapons.
For the most part these suggestions j
have ignored the personal element, which
is the key to the Chicago crime situation.
To illustrate: Imagine that you are Cor
poral O'Shaughnessey of the Chicago po
lice force. In your enthusiasm for dimin
ishing crime, you have learned a little
too much about the Capone and O'Banion
social clubs.
You receive a polite anonymous note to .
this effect: "Go easy, or you will be the i
next."
After which, wouldn't you become as |
talkative as a clam, and henceforth de- j
vote your talents and collapsed arches to j
the business of helping nice old ladies ■
across the street ? Sure you would. Think
of the wife and kiddies.
Chicago can't get better officials as
long as the gangsters run elections, and
the latter will run elections as long as the
beer and bullets hold out. As for better
police, just where would Chicago find
enough men, quick 011 the trigger and
sufficiently tired of life, to exterminate
the gangsters? Nowhere except in Tur
key, where fervent Mohammedans leap
heedlessly into battle in the hope of
reaching Heaven and their forty houris
the more quickly.
The policeman is hampered by his uni
form. The district attorney, by the ballot
box. The jury, by newspaper accounts
of the last casualty. All are hampered
by fear. Send in the State Militia, and
they wouldn't be able to find so much as
a beer baron's footprints.
The result is that with very little ex
j penditure for ammunition and stationery
the gangsters have achieved a supergov

eminent as fiendish, if more honest, tlian '
that of the Anti-Saloon League.
Onr guess is that only one group can
end Chicago gangstrife. That is the
group of Chicago merchants and other i
private citizens who are familiar with \
gang movements and personnel, and who ■
are at present neutral. To demonstrate I
how they could do so, we refer you to |
San Francisco of the 50's, when the
Hounds, the Sydney dips, land grafters,
and other crooks were numerous.
Dispensing swift justice and festoon- |
ing the Plaza with an ex-crook now and
then, the Vigilantes, an organization of i
private citizens, filled in quite efficiently i
the gap between early chaos and the es
tablishment of an effective police force.
The number festooned was negligible
compared to the number who felt their
collars growing too tight and left San
Francisco.
If they have a modicum of courage and
| enough civic pride, Chicago business men
ican destroy gangstrife by organizing as
Vigilantes and pursuing the tactics of the
old San Francisco order, only more so.
Using gang methods, they could murder
every available gangster, plus anybody
who remotely resembled a gangster. Now
and then a dash of boiling in oil or Rif
fian mayhem could be added for moral
effect.
This program might cost the lives of
many innocents, but these would be dying
for a good cause, and anyhow there are
plenty of people in Chicago. We predict i
that the results would be most effective., j
This is merely a suggestion, and we i
shan't be angry if it isn't adopted. It ;
won't be. Bravery isn't a custom now- j
adays, nor is civic pride. The average |
| Chicagoan figures that the gangsters, who j
j don't hurt him. might as well be allowed j
to have their fun, perforate one another
| now and then, and sell good beer.
After all, there is nothing like good j
beer. Particularly with pretzels.
