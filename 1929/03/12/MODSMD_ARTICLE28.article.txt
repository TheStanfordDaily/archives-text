" CHEATING IN THIS ROOM"

The Editor, Sir:
This afternoon, in Econ. 4, at one
o'clock, the Professor canie in and an
nounced that he had some problems that
he wanted us to work; and he very care
fully emphasized the fact that, although
this was not an examination — he had
promised us never to spring examinations
011 us unannounced —it was a non-co-op
erative affair. In short, he made it quite
clear that each student was to do his own
work.
Now it occurred that I sat next to
three happy youths who I judged must be
from the Econ. Department — Heaven
forbid that there should be such among
the Engineers!—who were verily bub
bling over with the joy of youth and the
coming of springtime; I think they must
have been what the honorable editor has
so aptly termed "Joe College's." And
their motto was "E pluribus unum." I
like Econ. students well enough; I like
to see co-operation; and I don't particu
larly mind non-co-operative problems, at

I reasonable intervals. But the combination ,
| this afternoon in room 200K was nothing
i less than a nuisance—much as I hate to
isay it. If I were sure of an "A" in that
I course —if even I felt I could count on j
ja "B+"—I shouldn't complain; but lam j
ineither so sure of my ability to do well!
ion the final that I might let these par-1
' ticular problems go, nor am I used to
I working problems in the midst of a buzz
|of conversation. I therefore deliver my
j ultimatum.
If this recurs again, 011 the day of the
final examination, 1 shall not remain si
lent. I shall arise, and say, gently but
distinctly: "This embarrasses me more
than it does you; but someone is cheating j
iin this room." And, lest this not produce
j the desired degree of silence, I shall level
lan ink-smudged finger at the offender
I until he—or I —shall be verily "branded
1 for life" as the first martyr to the honor
| code that replaced the honor system at
I Stanford.

" CHEATING IN THIS ROOM"

The Editor, Sir:
This afternoon, in Econ. 4, at one
o'clock, the Professor canie in and an
nounced that he had some problems that
he wanted us to work; and he very care
fully emphasized the fact that, although
this was not an examination — he had
promised us never to spring examinations
011 us unannounced —it was a non-co-op
erative affair. In short, he made it quite
clear that each student was to do his own
work.
Now it occurred that I sat next to
three happy youths who I judged must be
from the Econ. Department — Heaven
forbid that there should be such among
the Engineers!—who were verily bub
bling over with the joy of youth and the
coming of springtime; I think they must
have been what the honorable editor has
so aptly termed "Joe College's." And
their motto was "E pluribus unum." I
like Econ. students well enough; I like
to see co-operation; and I don't particu
larly mind non-co-operative problems, at

I reasonable intervals. But the combination ,
| this afternoon in room 200K was nothing
i less than a nuisance—much as I hate to
isay it. If I were sure of an "A" in that
I course —if even I felt I could count on j
ja "B+"—I shouldn't complain; but lam j
ineither so sure of my ability to do well!
ion the final that I might let these par-1
' ticular problems go, nor am I used to
I working problems in the midst of a buzz
|of conversation. I therefore deliver my
j ultimatum.
If this recurs again, 011 the day of the
final examination, 1 shall not remain si
lent. I shall arise, and say, gently but
distinctly: "This embarrasses me more
than it does you; but someone is cheating j
iin this room." And, lest this not produce
j the desired degree of silence, I shall level
lan ink-smudged finger at the offender
I until he—or I —shall be verily "branded
1 for life" as the first martyr to the honor
| code that replaced the honor system at
I Stanford.
