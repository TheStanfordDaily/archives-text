# EXERCISE ENOUGH!

### 
The Editor, Sir:
It would be interesting to know why it
is that the student who is "of age," un
fortunate enough to he in the lower divi
sion, and who is already overburdened
with more academic work and expense
earning than he can rightly handle, must
comply with the stupidly inflexible physi
cal education requirements in order to
continue registration.

I As it is, the type of work available j
| around Palo Alto more than gives one
his quota of physical exercise without i
| wasting valuable time in a course that !
j one cannot help but look upon resentfully. 1
It is to he hoped that someone who is j
able to see things from some other side i
than that of the "easy chair" aspect, will J
! attempt to remedy conditions.
Yours truly,
