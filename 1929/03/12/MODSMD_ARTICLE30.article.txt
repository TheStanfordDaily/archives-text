That long-awaited Intramural Vol
leyball and Croquet League came
nearer to actuality with the headquar
ters announcement that soft shell

baseball would be played this spring j
as an intramural sport.
After all, a hard ball does hurt one's
hannies.
The three fraternities already en
tered are said to have gone into rigor
ous training, with a diet of bread and
milk, Fletcher's Castoria, weak broth,
and Mellon's Food.

Why not invite the sororites to
play?
We understand that the discarded
women's gym suits will be used as
uniforms.
Of course, as far as freedom of ac
tion is concerned, this would be pull
ing a bloomer.
But utility should always be sacri
ficed to looks.
We are all on pins and noodles wait
, ing for the Hop Scotch tournament.
A search of the Daily Callfornlan
always bears fruit. We gleaned this
rhapsody without hardly looking at
all. There's no telling what you might
find taking the paper every day:
"Men's underwear! A few years
ago the most audacious of young
men would have thrown up their |
hands in horror at the slightest
mention of such things among the
fashion sheets.
"But now —well, two-piece un
mentionables are becoming more
and more in vogue. And what \
shades! —indeed, they rival the
color schemes of the fairer sex.
In fact, the co-eds have adopted
the men's shorts as part of their
wardrobe.
"These scanties consisting of an
upper and shorts are kaleidosco
pic, to say the least. For the up
pers, which are predominantly of
rayon, there is a tendency toward
pale blue, peach, orchid, and
green."
In the same style sheet appears the
note:
"Gloves will be mostly of pigskin
. . . with goatskin also running
strongly."
Personally, we have never heard of
a goatskin that didn't run strongly.
Another item from the same college
journal:
"Men's style bathing suits are said
to be enjoying great popularity among
young women in Florida this winter."
While, on the other hand, women's
style bathing suits are more and
more popular among young men. I
I '
California's Bureau of Occupation, j
I says the California!), has "a position
j open for a woman who can teach
ballet dancing and give muscle
! strengthening exercises to childred !
between the ages of 6 and 10.
Probably some of Prof. Terman's
1,000 gifted kids.
Also "one odd job is open to a stu-1
dent who can work between 6 and 10 .
j tonight."
It will have to be odd indeed to
' beat the other one.

That long-awaited Intramural Vol
leyball and Croquet League came
nearer to actuality with the headquar
ters announcement that soft shell

baseball would be played this spring j
as an intramural sport.
After all, a hard ball does hurt one's
hannies.
The three fraternities already en
tered are said to have gone into rigor
ous training, with a diet of bread and
milk, Fletcher's Castoria, weak broth,
and Mellon's Food.

Why not invite the sororites to
play?
We understand that the discarded
women's gym suits will be used as
uniforms.
Of course, as far as freedom of ac
tion is concerned, this would be pull
ing a bloomer.
But utility should always be sacri
ficed to looks.
We are all on pins and noodles wait
, ing for the Hop Scotch tournament.
A search of the Daily Callfornlan
always bears fruit. We gleaned this
rhapsody without hardly looking at
all. There's no telling what you might
find taking the paper every day:
"Men's underwear! A few years
ago the most audacious of young
men would have thrown up their |
hands in horror at the slightest
mention of such things among the
fashion sheets.
"But now —well, two-piece un
mentionables are becoming more
and more in vogue. And what \
shades! —indeed, they rival the
color schemes of the fairer sex.
In fact, the co-eds have adopted
the men's shorts as part of their
wardrobe.
"These scanties consisting of an
upper and shorts are kaleidosco
pic, to say the least. For the up
pers, which are predominantly of
rayon, there is a tendency toward
pale blue, peach, orchid, and
green."
In the same style sheet appears the
note:
"Gloves will be mostly of pigskin
. . . with goatskin also running
strongly."
Personally, we have never heard of
a goatskin that didn't run strongly.
Another item from the same college
journal:
"Men's style bathing suits are said
to be enjoying great popularity among
young women in Florida this winter."
While, on the other hand, women's
style bathing suits are more and
more popular among young men. I
