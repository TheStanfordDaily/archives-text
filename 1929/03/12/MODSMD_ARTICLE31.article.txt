The Daily is now ready to take seriously that long belated case of |
spring fever. From tomorrow until that day of chocolate covered soap, j
doorbells with hidden pins, and all other false alarms which cause the
hearts of the very young to tintinnabulate with glee, April Fool's Day.
Upon that hallowed day, the Daily will bow with the rest of the
fools and present the campus with a strange and startling, new and differ
ent, edition. Fathered by a great unknown, and to be brought forth in i
befoggedness of spring fever and of the memory of a too short frolic j
off campus, this issue of the Daily should be strange and startling, not 1
to mention new and different.
Father Unknown has dubbed his about-to-be brainchild, the Utopian j
edition of the Stanford Daily, or, no, let's see, the Daily Utopian, j
Everything, mind you, everything from beer and free lunch to twenty-five I
hundred Wampus stars 011 the campus for the delectation of the horde j
of Roughs will be in this "spaslnil issue," this dazzling, eye-opening, j
impossible Daily gone Utopia.
Our Sir Thomas More, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy
