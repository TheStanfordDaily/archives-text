# WILBUR CHARACTERIZED AS DYNAMIC FORCE IN BUILDING GREATER STANFORD OF TODAY
## 
### 
I Recalling Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's I
! fourteen years of fruitful activity as
j executive head of Stanford University, j
! friends of the newly appointed Secretary 1
j of the Interior ponder over the length of
I time he will be gone from the Cardinal
! campus.
| Some believe that Dr. Wilbur will re
■ main at the Interior post only long
enough to organize that branch of the ,
cabinet along the lines President Hoover i
desires. When he has accomplished this j
task, they think he will return to Stan- j
ford to resume his duties as University j
chief.
Others believe that Dr. Wilbur has j
definitely entered into the nation's poli- j
tics for a four-year term at least, and!
that such a long absence from the Uni-1
versity presidency will necessitate his!
resignation.
But all join unanimously in expressing
the opinion that Wilbur has been the dy
namic, driving power backing the forma
tion of the greater Stanford of today.
Trained in the pioneer Stanford of Dr.
Jordan's first dreams, and intimately ac
quainted with all its struggles, Dr. Wil
bur came into the presidency at a time
when there was still a majority of trus
tees on the board who had known Mrs.
Stanford. He was an intermediator, a
binding link between the old and new
phases of Stanford's first three decades
of existence.
His first work was the examination of |
existing conditions and the development'
of the plant as far as power was given \
him. The buildings added during his re-!
Rime and the development of lawns and j
gardens have transformed the Farm into!
the place of beauty it is today. He con-1
sidered the problems of housing, faculty,
salaries, and pensions. He examined the !
conditions of students, dormitories, eating j

! halls, athletic fields, and encouraged ev- ]
! cry effort toward character building !
j through student control and the honor
! system.
He made a study of the curriculum and :
advised a periodic reconsideration of it. '
He increased the efficiency and use of
the University by instituting the four- j
quarter system.
All his considerations were tempered i
by a knowledge of the four-sided nature ■
of the University—trustees, faculty, stu
dents, and alumni. This vast amount of
work was done during the busy war-times
when he was chief of the Conservation
Division of the United States Food Ad
ministration.
Dr. Wilbur once said, "The University,
as one of the longest lived of human in- j
stitutions, must grow continually and
never reach a state of maturity and de
cline. ... It must constantly undergo evo
lution so that it is in constant preparation
for the needs of the future. . . . The
power to grow and change with each
generation is the hope of the University."
