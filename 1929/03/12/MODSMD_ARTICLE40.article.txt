# EUROPEANS RESPECT AMERICAN PAINTING, MARSHALL ASSERTS
## Palo Alto Artist Discusses Landscaping; Speaks of Modernism, Cubism 
### 
"American art and the American pub
lic's appreciation of art are not laughed
at in Europe," asserted 1' rank L. Mai
shall, Palo Alto artist, whose exhibit in
the Stanford Art Gallery opened Sun
day. "On the contrary, there is now a
growing conviction abroad that America
is in no way behind the other countries
in art fields.
"I'"rom a slow beginning the United
States has passed into a period of phe
nomenal activity in painting,' Marshall
pointed out, "impressive in respect to the
numbers engaged in its pursuit, and to
both the quantity and quality of its in
struction. Europe sees and respccts this,
he declared, adding that 'it was almost
hard to think that any other country
could be doing more right now in art
than America is.
"It is in landscape work that America
has most distinguished herself," is the
artist's opinion. "We have had a long
line of almost unexcelled artists in this
field, who have done much to gain this
Country recognition abroad."
Marshall himself specializes in land
scapes. His present display consists of
what is known i»i the East as '"thumb
.box" sketches—a type of landscape not
generally seen in the West. * 1 hese
sketches are exceedingly small, and are
done very rapidly, sometimes at a single
sitting. They are ij) a way experimental,
for if I find that I am especially inter
ested in a certain one, I can return to it,
and do a larger and more careful painting
of the. scene," he explained.
Marshall's attitude toward modern art
was distinctly interesting. "There is a
great deal of 'bunk' wrapped up in it,"
he acknowledged. The reason for this he
sees in the number of faulty copyists.
"There are just as many copyists of
modern art as of the old masters —and
just as poor ones. Followers of the cubist
and imwressionist schcx>ls are more often
poor imitators than original geniuses."
The present uncertain regard in which
modernism is held he explained as being
due to the numbers of students who copy
the manner and effect of the masters of
these schools, but fail to grasp the deep,
underlying principles.
"And also," he added humorously, "to
the numbers of people who couldn't un
derstand even the masters, much less the
copyists.
"Modern pictures belong in modern
homes. Where the homes are garish and
angular, with violent contrasts in scarfs
and upholstery, an old master would be
ludicrous. Here cubism and vorticism
has its place."
In speaking of his work, the artist de
clared that he found painting conditions
in California much different than in the
East. "I have been here now for three
years, and I am just beginning to be "ac
climated," he confessed. He has spent
several winters sketching in the southern
liart of the state, where the rich variety
of scenes offered by the high mountains
rising steeply above the deserts strongly
appeals to him.
