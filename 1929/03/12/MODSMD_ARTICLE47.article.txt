# CHAPPIE ANNOUNCES COPY DEADLINE FOR APRIL TRACK ISSUE
## 
### 
Peering out from his office window
and seeing joyous nymphs blithely
cavorting about on the greensward
near the Roble Gym, the Bewliiskered
One suddenly remembered that spring
and the track season are approaching.
In his mad rush for tattered jersey
and hobnailed sandals, he paused to
shout back for copy for his next
Chaparral. "The April Chappie will
be the "Big Meet Issue," he said, "and
deadline for both art and literary
contributions is Monday, March 25."
The Old Boy realizes that finals and
this poison oak epidemic will occupy
a great deal of attention; accordingly
he is giving the campus wits plenty
of time to send in their humor. Short
jokes and cover and drawing hunches
are especially needed for the issue,
but the Foolish One advises care in
writing puns. The lowest form of wit
will not be tolerated with the expres
sions broad jump, pole vault, fast
male, or track meet. Spring and rush
ing will also have their place in this
number, but affairs of the cinder path
are to be the main topic.
Contributions should be mailed to
Box 15, Campus, or put in the con
tributors' box on the door of the
Chaparral office in the Press building.
