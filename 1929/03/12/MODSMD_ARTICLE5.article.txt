# FROSH NINE TO MEET SAN JOSEANS IN LAST CONTEST OF QUARTER
## 
### 
In the last game of the quarter, Stan- j
ford's freshman baseball team will meet i
the San Jose High School nine at Â»3:30
this afternoon on the sunken diamond. j
Harry Wolters, varsity baseball men- |
| tor, who is taking charge of the frosh ;
'squad during the absence of Coach Husky i
j Hunt, will start "Mac" McLean on the !
j mound and Phil Dixon behind the plate
j for the babes. McLean has pitched win- !
ning ball all season, and Dixon is rapidly I
improving at the receiving position.
All the cripples have fully recovered
and the freshmen will start the game to
morrow with full strength. McLean's
touch of poison oak has vanished and the
tall chucker is in the best of form and
spirits again. The abscess on Rintala's
hand has healed sufficiently to allow him
to play, and Herb Barsumian's sprained
ankle is strengthening nicely under care
ful treatment.
The entire team showed better form at j
the plate in the game with Salinas last j
Saturday than at any time this year, j
Kelly in particular seems to have gotten
his eye on the ball, for he clouted a j
triple and two singles out of four times i
at bat.
The lineup will be as follows: pitcher,
j McLean; catcher, Dixon; first base,
] Marks; second base, Barsumian; third
base, Kelly; short stop, White; left field,
Waterman; center field, Rintala; right
field, Fox.
