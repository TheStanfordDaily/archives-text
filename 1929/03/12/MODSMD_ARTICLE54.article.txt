## ERIC KRENZ

Stanford acclaimed a new hero Sat
urday afternoon —Eric Krenz —who
tossed the discus 5 feet 7% inches
farther than any human being has
thrown it since records have been
kept.
Although the record has not
been put on the official books,
there is little doubt but that the
curly-headed Cardinal will soon
be officially recognized as a
world's champion. The Pacific As
sociation officials were satisfied
that the conditions came up to
the regulations prescribed by the
A.A.U. The discus was found to
be heavier than the minimum
weight of 4 pounds 6 and 4-10
ounces. The circle measured up
to standard.
Someone up in the press box was
heard to remark, "Gee, hut that was
a lucky break," after the new record
was announced. This is the attitude
taken by numerous well-meaning peo
ple. But luck did not account for that
throw of 163 feet 8% inches. It is true
that Krenz was feeling "fit" and got
off on the right foot so to say. He was
lucky in that he did not foul. There
are numerous conditions that helped.
But there was something more than
mere luck.
Those who know Krenz, know
that he always goes into a meet
bent on breaking a record. He
was not content to rest on his
past laurels—intercollegiate shot
and discus champion. Long prac
tice and scientific study enabled
him to make that throw Satur
day. He received his inspiration
and tutelage from "Dink" Tem
pleton. But no amount of inspira
tion or "knowing how" would

have aided the new champion an
iota if he had not been willing to
work.
This new crown comes to Krenz as
a climax of hard intensive practice
and work. The public too often fails
to realize the sacrifices that were
made so that when the opportunity
presented itself, he would be ready to
cash in on it. Krenz is to be con
gratulated. He has reached the pin
nacle in his line. To other track men
his success exemplifies what concen
trated effort will do and he will be
an inspiration to them.
And for those who still believe
athletes are strong but dumb, it
might be well to mention that
Krenz stands 102 plus 127 in the
Bawlout. —Merle Emry.
