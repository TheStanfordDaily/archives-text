# GORDON DAVIS URGES STUDENTS TO TRY OUT FOR OPERA TOMORROW
## Twenty Leading and Minor Roles To Be Selected For "Moving On" 
### 
Tomorrow and Thursday nights will
be the only times that tryouts foi
parts in the Junior Opera will bÂ£
held, so Gordon Davis requests thai
all those who can sing well, act above
the average, and dance a little, attend
the trials in the Assembly Hall from
7 to 9 o'clock both nights. These first
tryouts are being held for the leading
and minor roles only, of which there
are almost twenty. The choruses will
be selected at tryouts to be held early
in April.
Because the trials are being held
this quarter, Davis says that there
may be many who have appeared in
campus productions since December
who believe that they are ineligible
to attend the tryouts. He announces
that neither they, nor those who will
appear in the Benefit Vaudeville next
quarter, are disqualified for parts in
the musical comedy, and he wants
all old and new talent to try out this
week.
With a large cast, there are many
good parts, and all ranges of voices
will be used. The only roles definitely
fixed as to voice are the male lead,
which requires a tenor, the female
lead, which will be a soprano, the sup
porting part, which calls for an alto,
and the villain, who, true to form,
will be a bass. No "Blues" songs are
being composed for the operetta,
"Moving On," which centers around
circus life.
Results of the tryouts will be
posted each day on the bulletin board
outside the Green Room in the Eng
lish building.
