<?> long from the private office of •

<*> dollar, for each copy and will <$>
<$> give a special discount for pur
<s> chases of over one hundred ■$>
copies. Those intending to take <?>
<$• advantage of this generous offer
<§> are urged to be on deck at an <$>
<§> early hour for the management <$>

<& sold out before next week —to <$>
<•> the junk dealer if no one else <s>
<$> comes around. <$>
