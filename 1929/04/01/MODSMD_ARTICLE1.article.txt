## Knights of Mop and Broom Soon to Leap Into Lap of Luxury at Lagunita 
### 
As a final accomplishment in the
University, Utopian's janitor housing
condition campaign, Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur announced today that the
President's Mansion will be used in
the future as a hotel for the working
men of the University.
Dr. Wilbur made public his move
through a letter to the Utopian. In
part it reads:
"Deeply moved by the effort of the
Utopian to remedy conditions existing
in the janitors' quarters, I feel that
it is my duty to rid the campus of
this threat and danger. It is with
pleasure that I announce that the
janitors will hereafter receive their
mail at Lagunita Knoll. And, they'll
take good care of the place while I'm
gone."
President Wilbur plans to have the
present janitorial quarters razed. On
the site a five-room cottage will be
erected for the University president.
"I believe that Utopia's reputation as
a liberal and democratic school must
be maintained. It is my plan to have
two Lower Division students as guests
in my cottage each year."
Reports from eight janitors indi
cated that they are highly pleased by
their new quarters, but that the dis
tance is too far from work.
"We're just one big family, and I'm
sure that all of my boys will enjoy
their new home," said John Brown,
foreman, on hearing of the acquisition.
