# WOOL, 'PEEPING TOM,â€™ NABS, FINES SELF AS RESULT OF GIN ORGY
## 
### 
Declaring that he had looked j
| through the transom into -his own
room at Encina last night and dis
covered himself in the act of becom
ing disgracefully inebriated, Fred
Wool, chairman of Men's Council, to
day fined himself $25 and added fif
teen units to his graduation require
ments for "conduct unbecoming a
Utopian gentleman."
Wool was unable to account for his
actions and refused to make a state
ment when his roommate expressed
the belief that the council chairman
had taken the liquor to save him from
possible punishment.
"I had it in our room ready to take
to Lane Hospital for medicinal pur- j
poses," Wool's roommate declared. "1
think he may have misunderstood the
situation and felt that drinking it was
the only way to destroy the evidence
against me. The gardener requested '
the men not to throw gin out the
window because it killed the plants."
Explaining the occasion of the dis
covery. Wool said: "I just happened
to be up on a ladder hanging a pic
ture of Dean Culver in the hall, when
I was attracted by a strange gurgling
noise coming from our room. I climbed
a step higher to look through the '
transom and there 1 was sprawled
on the bed literally pouring gin down
my throat. Bottles were strewn all
over the floor and an empty case was ,
sticking out of the closet."
