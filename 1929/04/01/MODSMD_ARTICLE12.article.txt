# EXTENDED HOURS BRING DOWNFALL OF LATE LEAVES
## Evasion of Rules, Deception Result in More Leniency on Part of Administration 
### 
Thirty late leaves per quarter with
permission to extend the leave 24
, hours, will be allowed to the members
; ot' the "Five Hundred," according to
| the decision of the Women's Council
; made yesterday. The new measure
I
j was approved by Dean Mary Yost and
will go into effect at once.
The action of the Women's Council
was in the nature of a compromise
between the demand of a committee
; of women of GO late leaves per quar
j ter, and Dean Yost's proposal to allow
15 per quarter.
The new rules follow:
1. Women must not sign out for
more than 7 late leaves per week.
2. If there is a good reason for so
doing, the woman on late leave may
ask for permission to extend the leave
I 24 hours.
| 3. Requests for extension of leaves
are to be telephoned or wired to Dean
Yost, and charged to the university.
4. Women on late leave must not
go more than 250 miles from the cam
pus during the period of the leave.
5. A woman on late leave must al
ways be accompanied by at least one
person, either woman or man.
C. Unless an extension is allowed,
women must sign in at their dormi
tories or sorority houses by 9 o'clock
in the morning after taking out late
j leave.
Resulted From Agitation
Agitation for a change in the rules
| for women started several months ago
when a large window was kicked out
of a sorority house by one of the mem
bers who was attempting to climb up
to her room by means of a rope lad
der. Investigation disclosed scratches
and disfigurations on the walls of sev
j eral houses and of Roble Hall, and
j searching parties found a number of
well-worn rope ladders in the rooms.
The girls had evaded the late leave
rules by having someone sign them in
at the proper hour.
The agitation crystallized last Wed
nesday night when a serious accident
occurred at Roble Hall. One of the
| inmates of the hall fell three stories
and sustained a painful injury to one
of her little lingers when her rope
ladder, which had been lowered by a
! roommate, slipped loose from the bed
stead and precipitated her to the
ground below. In her desperate at
tempts to save herself, she tore all
the ivy off the side of the building
| and broke out two window panes. The
fall also entirely ruined a new eve
ning dress and broke a string of valu
able pearls.
Feeling that something should be
1 done about late-leave regulations that
! force the women to such extremes,
all the women's organizations on the
campus passed resolutions calling for
; a change in the rules, with the result
that prompt action was secured.
