# SINGAPORE WELCOMES DEANS YOST, CULVER
## 
### 
The next time you want to see the
Dean of Men you'll have to go to
I Singapore to do it.
George Culver, Dean of Men, an
nounced today that both his offices
and the offices of the Dean of Wo
i men, Miss Mary Yost, are to be trans
ferred to Singapore. The change will
be effected before the end of the cur
rent quarter.
"I might just as well be in Singa
pore as here for all the good I do,"
said Dean Culver when interviewed
concerning this drastic change. "I
think the move will supply a long
felt need on the part of the student
I body. Besides this is a Utopian Uni
â–  versity and whoever heard of a Dean
! being needed in a university of that
j kind?
"Halifax was considered as a pos
sible location for our new offices," he
I continued, "because we had been told
to go there so often. But Singapore
was finally decided on as more adapt
ed to our needs."
