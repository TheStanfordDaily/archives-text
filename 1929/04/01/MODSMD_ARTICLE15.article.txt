# Entrance Needs Of Athletes to Be Called Off
## 
### 
To perpetuate the traditional physi
cal strength of her sons, Utopia Uni
jversity today, by official administra-j
tive proclamation, announced that all
, scholastic requirements for maricula
j tion will henceforth be waived upon
] condition that the applicant for entry
'display potential athletic prowess.
' In anticipation of such a radical
i change of academic policy, Glenn S.
Warner, famed gridiron coach of the
i university, has perfected a sign signal
kj stem whereby a player of any na
tionality can participate in the game
of football.
As a result of Warner's invention
an all-international team is expected
to be enlisted from tlie supermen of
the world to represent Utopia next
j season. The quarterback will neces-1
j sarily be English-speaking in order
that the commands of the officials be
interpreted. Otherwise, no limitations |
are placed on potential material for
a perfect football aggregation.
Perpetual Supremacy Looms
Unless rival universities follow the |
lear of Utopia and compete with her '
' in the world market for material, per
petual athletic supremacy must be
the lot of the Uotpians. Taking ad
vantage of this, wise alumni of Utopia
are placing perpetual bets from which
they expect to gain an annuity that
will guarantee 100% income on the
investment.
To accommodate fans it is proposed
to develop at least two complete
squads in each major sport, each as j
nearly equal as possible. One squad
will compete at home while the other !
is on the road. In this way Utopia can
be simultaneously represented in two
or more leagues, and concentrate all
championships of the national in one
institution. The play-off between each
squad at the close of the season will
be comparable to the present world ;
series between the major baseball
leagues.
The trophies won will be displayed i
for one year and then melted down
to pay expenses accruing from the
world-wide search for athletes that
will be necessary to maintain unri-!
valed leadership in the realm of
sports.
