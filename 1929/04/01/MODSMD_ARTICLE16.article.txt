# LOWER CLASSES BACK AS RESULT OF GREAT BOARD REVERSE PLAY
## 
### 
Simultaneously with the announce
ment of the state-wide abolition of
junior colleges yesterday, came the
announcement from the Board of
Trustees of Utopia University of the
immediate abandonment of the plan
for eliminating the Lower Division.
It was reported that the trustees had
also appointed a committee to con
sider ways and means of rebuilding
this part of the University.
The reason for the elimination of
ihe junior colleges was thought to i
have been necessitated by the "colle
giate" atmosphere gradually gaining
predominance in these institutions.
Outraged parents and townspeople
appealed to the State Superintendent
of Schools for relief from students
who were attempting to emulate all
the more fascinating and renowned
misdeeds that occur in x*eal colleges.;
It was reported that the Junior Col
legiates had even attempted the mix
ing of gasoline and alcohol.
Without a background, and lacking
the sane presence of experienced
elder students, the junior college un- 1
dergraduates were running wild at the
expense of parents and townspeople.
Most of them were still living at
home, and this condition led to a
state of irresponsibility which the
State Superintendent of Schools
thought it wise to check.
The return to the old order of things
to Utopia is thought to meet with
the entire approval of fraternities,
alumni, and athletic coaches, as well
as parents of some former junior col
lege inmates.
