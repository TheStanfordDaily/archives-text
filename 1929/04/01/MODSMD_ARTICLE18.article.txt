# CARDINALS BEAT BEAR COURT MEN BY GREAT SCORE
## Courageous Cagers Crimp California Court Crew; Husky Hunt Is Horrified 
### 
Coming back strong in the second
hall' to score three points while hold
ing their opponents to one field goal
and three free throws, Utopia's bas
ketball quintet last night defeated
California G3-47 in the Utopian pa
vilion to cinch the California-Utopia
series and the conference title. Un
daunted by the thirty-two-point lead
held by the Blue and Gold at the end
of the first half, the Cardinals flashed
a fast-breaking offense in the last
period that left their rivals helpless.
"Red" Berg, playing center, consist
ently out-jumped Captain Corbin of
the Bears, and was also high-point
man, sinking eleven field goals and
five free throws for a total of twenty
seven points.
Psychology played a big part in
bringing victory to the Ute team.
With the score 42-10 in favor of Cali
fornia at the end of the first half,
"Husky" Hunt, Utopia's fighting bas
ketball mentor, told his men that un
less they emerged victorious he would
eat a worm.
"I have been informed by the
B A.C.," Hunt is reported to have
said, "that unless we win the game
tonight we will lose the series. Go out
and win!"
The Worm Turns
Aghast at the thought of seeing a
poor worm suffer, the Stanford quin
tet commenced the second half de
termined to play as they had never
played before. Combining clever
floorwork with deadly shooting, the
Redshirts completely overwhelmed the
Boars who were helpless before this
terrific onslaught. From every angle
the Utopian forwards looped field
goals while Captain Rothert and
Tainpcke held California to one bas
ket, scored by Ten Eyck who, un
noticed, climbed on top of the back
board and dropped in a neat shot after
a pass from Stevens.
Marvelous Accuracy Shown
The Cards' uncanny shooting was
not confined to field goals. Of twenty
six attempts at free throws, twenty
three were converted by the Stanford
deadeyes.
In view of the large number of
fouls called on both teams, the play
ing of Gregory, California guard, stood
out particularly as spotlessly clean.
Gregory was the only man to have no
touls charged against him. It is un
derstood that the Pacific Coast Con
ference plans to award Gregory a
trophy in recognition of his consist
ently sportsmanlike conduct.
Excellent officiating helped keep the
game fast. Particularly impartial was
the work of Referee Hollander, who
apparently has not allowed his past
experience as coach of the California
145's to tinge his judgment in even a
California-Utopia contest. Hollander's
fairness was clearly demonstrated in
the first half when a California man
attempted to intercept an Utopian
pass, but failed, the ball bouncing off
his hands and outside. Obviously the
man should have caught the ball, so
Hollander very reasonably gave Cali
fornia the ball outside.
