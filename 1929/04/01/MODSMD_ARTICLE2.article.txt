# HEAT ALL NIGHT IS PROMISE OF UTOPIA UNIVERSITY CHIEFS
## 
### 
Students who desire to remain up
until the wee sma' hours of the night
may now do so in perfect comfort.
Word has been received from the
power house that beginning today the
heat will be left on all night in the
dormitories.
It is understood that the move has
been made in response to many re
quests to the Dean's office on the part
of bridge- and poker-players who com
plained that they could not pursue
their education in comfort. A large
electric heater has been installed in
each of the Toyon clubrooms, and it
is expected that many freshmen will
be prevailed upon to spend their eve
nings playing the jolly game of Black
Jack with their friends, with the
cheerful glow of the heater to keep
them from having cold feet.
Fear was expressed by the scholar
ship office that certain grinds would
aitempt to take advantage of the in
creased hours of comfort and use
them for further study. It was an
nounced by the President's office,
however, that if such conditions were
discovered the heat would be shut
off in all except the clubrooms.
Little children may be obscene if
not heard.
