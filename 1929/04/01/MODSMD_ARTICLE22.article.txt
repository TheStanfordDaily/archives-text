# Utopian Ululation

### 
Obviously an Utopian university would not be one under the scourge
of the daily press. For that reason, among other good ones, this will be
the first and final issue of the University Utopian. And while it's not
the first, it may be the final effort of its staff. Further, any paper ap
proaching as near as possible the Utopian, must be sans editorials.
Ergo, before this becomes one, we leave the column to Campus Opinions.
