Editor of the Utopian
Dear Sir:
Being one of the many students
whose grades have suffered because
of constant distraction, I would like
to raise an objection to the prepon
derance of beautiful girls in attend
ance at this university. With so many
good-looking women scattered about
the library it is next to impossible
to get any studying done. Not wish
ing to be accused of criticizing with
out offering a method of correction, I
would suggest (a) That the library
be open to women students only on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,
and to men students only on Tues
days, Thursdays, and Saturdays, or
(b) That the library be walled into
two sections, one for women alone,
and the other for the men.
However, to strike at the root of
the evil, it would seem that an in
stitution otherwise rating so high
from an educational standpoint should
choose its women students by some
other method than the present sys
tem of holding a state-wide beauty
contest to determine the most beau
tiful applicants. Of course the writer
does not object to attractive co-eds,
but I feel that a certain amount of
intelligence should be a prerequisite
for admission of women to Utopia. I
think the editor will find that the
vast majority of men students will
agree with mv preference for the
gril with brains, the "personality"
girl as she ia sometimes known, rath
er than for the type of beautiful
dumbbell now present at Utopia.
Of course there is a certain amount
of prestige attached to being known
as the university with the world's
best-looking co-eds, but I feel that
even that fails to compensate for the
numerous drawbacks attached to so
much beauty. Let the girls go back to
Hollywood.

The Editor, Sirrah:
J. Finnan Haddie, '32, is quite cor
rect in his recent letter stating that
violations of the Honor Idea can be
blamed upon members of the faculty.
Surely the students are not at fault.
That leaves only U3 professors.
His suggestion that placing stu
dents two scats apart is not enough
distance, and that they should be two
and a half or three seats apart is
well in point. Reading his claim that
a prime cause of cheating is the fact
that examinations do not take long
enough. I suddenly thought of a plan
to avoid this difficulty, as follows:
Upon completion of their examina
tions, my students will hereafter be
required to retire to a nearby room
and engage themselves in throwing
pens at. targets until the allotted
examination time is over. The longer
the time"spent, in throwing pens, the
lower the grade, with the result that
more time will be devoted to writing
examinations.
Why not be broad-minded and per
mit smoking during examinations?
This would eliminate the necessity
of going outdoors to smoke, and the
possibility of students being asked
embarrassing questions by one an
other.
Personally, I like to see a man
smoke while flunking a pipe.
Yours sincerely,
I. M. Heibrau.
The Editor, Sir:
In view of the recent discussion of
student honor, I deem it advisable,
personally and as a representative of
the faculty, to commend the officers
of the student body for the exhaus
tive manner and scientific attitude
wiih which they delved into the fun
damental, as well as the seemingly
more trivial conditions and data from
which the problem of honor sprung.
Their efforts point to a solution
which will compel a paramount de
gree of attention from those inter
ested in college life. By its dimen
sional or quantitive, rather than
qualitative, character, by the inher
ent weight implied in the concept,
honor, the eyes of the rational and
thinking world will be directed to
ward radiating center of the contro
versy, i.e., Utopia.
The claim that Utopian students
are not honorable and honest, in tlieir
academic efforts is understood to be
a ruse, a means to an end, and not a
truism. It is a priori and prima facie
evidenco that in so far as the univer
sity is subjectively concerned, the
question of honor is irrelevant and
extraneous. It is a psychological law :

! that a voluble entity does not, of its
I own free will, publish its shortcom
ings.
The end sought is obviously objec
tive to the university as a congregate
1 oi' individuals. The adequately clever
expedient sponsored by the officers of
(lie student will, undoubtedly, attain
this end. The individuals directly re
sponsible for the introduction of the
i discussion have already won deserved
i fame for themselves, and ultimately,
will gain for their university the en
vied reputation of being a seat, of
honor as well as a seat, of learning,
j The result of the discussion which
is incidental when viewed collective
ly, but becomes pertinent when looked
| at through the eyes of the instructor,
i is that we, as professors, will con
tinue to be allotted a period of free
dom during examinations.
As a representative of the faculty,
I heartily thank Mr. Templeton Peck
and the Honor System Committee for
their invaluable work and the results
accomplished by that work.

j The Editor, Sir:
As a member of the class of '03 1
wish to express my gratification at
j the way things are getting along on
the campus since I have left. Par
> I icularly do I wish to express my
approval of the attitude of the fac
ulty. I am sure that if the members
of the class of '03 had only had the
| advantages of instruction under the
: present faculty they would have
1 turned out to be much better men
' and women.
The present faculty particularly do
serves commendation upon the per
fectly marvelous men they are turn
ing out. 1 often have occasion to stop
at a certain service station where
i there is the nicest operator, who is a
recent Utopia graduate. He has
the nicest manners and the curliest
i
hair! I am sure that if the faculty
1 continue to educate men to be as nice
as he is, they will all be equal busi
ness success. Sincerely,
Pollyanna, '03.
j Editor, Sir:
The unprecedented perfection of
the position of the pedagogical por
i tion of your proud palestra to the
pompous prodigies thereof is particu
larly praiseworthy.
Its perspicacious (performance in
perpetuating the perdition of profes
i sors prying into the paucity of precog
nition of pupils is practically peer
less.
Yours for a preoccupied profes
sion, —'01.
The Editor, Sir:
As a loyal alumnus of Utopia Uni
versity I am writing to express my
sincere admiration for the kinds of
students which are being turned out
by my alma mater. My praise of them
is unlimited, and I feel enthusiastic
over those even who graduate.
Since leaving Utopia, in 1909, I have
been connected with the Sleep-Tight
Mattress company of Morpheus, In
diana, and in my capacity as chief
inspector at the factory there, I have
had a good many former Utopia men
serving as my assistants.
Their task, while simple enough
when they begin, grows rapidly more
difficult as time goes on. It is their
duty to thoroughly test and inspect
each mattress made, and to sleep tight
on each one of them so that every
unit of our product may be sold with
a guarantee.
Before 1918 it was a comparatively,
simple matter for our inspectors to
sleep tight, and we recruited from the
local saloons. During the last few
years it. has become increasingly dif
ficult, to find men who were ablo to
sleep in the proper condition. Mor
pheus being an inland town, and re
mote from the Canadian border as
well. Finally, in 1927, in desperation, I
took on as inspectors two men who
had been turned out. by Utopia Uni
versity. They made good!
Max Beerbum and Ginius McFizz
were the first Utopia men in my de
partment, and from their first day
with us, to their deaths two years
ago, there was not one day out of the
305 in which both of them did not
sleep tight on one of our mattresses.
Utopia should be proud of such men.
My department now boasts of 19
assistant inspectors, and every one
of them is a former Utopia man!
Every one of them is possessed of an
uncanny ability to sleep tight, and

even during those rare fits of insom
nia with which even the best of
sleepers are afflicted, those men have
gone ahead and gotten tight anyhow!
That's the spirit that makes for suc
cess!
These men have made he immense
ly proud of my school, and I believe
that they are no more than good
examples of the type of student which
the Univehsity is turning out every
day. I'd die for dear old Utopia!
Loyally,
Immanuel Lee Stiff, ex-'ll.
The Editor, Sir:
Tn spite of the fact that It has been
more than fifty years since I wore a
"turtle-neck" at Utopia, I still keep
in touch through your splendid pub
lication with every move in student
affairs. Things haven't changed a bit
since '79!
When I was a frosh you couldn't
beat a Utoplte, and by cracky, it's the
same way now! It doesn't make any
difference whether It's in pogo or in
business, they are alwnys ahead.
Since I've been with the Footloose
Fly-Paper Company we have made
it a policy to take in at least, ten
Utopia graduates each year, and 1

declare, they've been getting better
all the time —I can't decide whot does
it, maybe it's the Classical Literature i
courscs they get, or perhaps it's the
j propinquity of San Francisco —any-
i way, hey give the best service in the
i company and we can't keep them
I down. Yesterday I had to create!
j twenty-five new vice-presidencies to j
j accommodate them —there just wasn't
j enough room at the top.
Without, a single exception, our |
| "Utopites" are fine workers. They're
! never on (he job more than two days .
a week, and they always get down to
the office at 11 and don't leave until
2: HO or 3 o'clock. When it comes to
original ideas they're right there, too.
i Only last month, Doodam Little, one
of our '28 men, won the Humanitarian
League Award for inventing a new fly
j paper glue with absolutely no adhe- 1
! sive properties to maim or injure the j
j innocent inserts. The company has
I already realized millions on the idea. 1
Well, Little is no exception to the .
general rule, and that is why we open
our arms to Utopia graduates. We
don't mind a few little smirches on
your diplomas, either. Come on, we
want more of you.
Luck to you in pogo,
—'79.
