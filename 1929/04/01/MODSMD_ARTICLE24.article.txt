How to say what you have to say
in such a way that nobody can under
stand you. Where to put commas. How
to make a period. When a quotation
is not a quotation. These, and many
other similarly confusing problems
are answered in this neat little text.
For sheer unadulterated pleasure
this little book is unrivaled. Read it
and forget your (other) troubles.

A perfectly charming little book.
How to cook tliree-minute eggs, and
what's wrong in Nicaragua—every
thing, EVERYTHING, is told clearly
and plainly in so many words (oh, so
many words!).
Tables showing the mortality rates,

land serve admirably to illustrate the
! text. Calculations which show to the

if laid end to end, it would take to

' color and form to the book.
Folks, you cannot deny yourselves'
the pleasure of reading this admirable

Telephone Directory. By Bell.
Promising to be by far the most
popular work of the season in the
younger circles, the Telephone Direc
tory compels the attention and inter
est of every wide-awake and progres
sive individual.
Miss Bell has incorporated in her
latest work a universal appeal, and
written in a style so lucid and simple,
according to a plan so accurate and
appropriate that a child can recognize
its worth. For the lover of adventure
and mystery, a random, haphazard
perusal of the publication offers all
the excitement of a Conrad romance,
and all the uncertainty of the Canary
Murder Case. To quote:
"Übxlrelitz, Zonius, Y; 49 Back Al
ley: Palo Alto 463-X."
What more does the reader ask in
the way of uncertainty? The reference
may be to a female. It may be to a
male. The absorbing doubt leads the
i reader to investigate. He rings up
j 4G3X or calls at 49 Back Alley. He
I waits the solution, trembling. And
then .... But I will not spoil it.
You must discover the secret your
self.
And for the conservative, the shy,
! even the bashful, whose perusal is
limited to excerpts, to bits with
which he is familiar, for the timor
ous, there is always the chance of a
wrong number. Each time he goes to
its pages he may well murmur in si
lent rapture, "Perhaps this time I
shall meet adventure, become ac
quainted with the great unknown. God
, knows what may happen."
Not the least charming feature of
Miss Bell's great work is the realism,
the local color, and the inclusive dra
matis personae that distinguishes her
writing. To become familiar with her
! work is to know the entire locality of
*
which she writes —a liberal education
, in itself.
Nor can the authoress be charged
with the use of airy or arid material,
| with frivolity and froth. Not a word
is used that could be spared, each is
terribly significant to someone. Sho
: is comprehensive, complete in her
books, but far from redundant..
The next time you have an empty
evening, I suggest that you let the
Telephone Directory solve your prob
lem.
Grimm Fairy Tales, Barnyard McFat
ten Publish Co., 1929.
Here is a collection of rousing juve
nile stories written in the modern
manner especially for the modern
child. There is nothing of the frilly
wishy-washy sort of thing that wa.)
so popular a few years ago to bo
found in this up-to-the-minute volume.

There are stories by such well-known
children's writers as Madame Elinor
Glynn, Theodore Dreiser, Ben Hecht, !
and Brann, the Iconoclast, and the
stories deal, not with the stereotyped
Hansel and Gretel, the puling Tom
Thumb, and their ilk, but with such I
fascinating characters as appear in
Dreiser's well-known "American Trav
esty," and in the Glynn's "Eight
Months and Two Weeks."
These stories should appeal particu-!
larly to the child, be he young or old,
who is interested in Freudianism, and
Psychology, for the problems which!
these stories present are very Psycho
logical. For example, one of the
shorter stories by Jim Tully, deals
with a crazed lover who brutally mur
ders his unfaithful mistress, strangles j
his three illegitimate children, and |
lives happily ever after with a drab
whom lie has picked up on the corner
of Fifth Avenue and Market St. This :
story is very Psychological, and the i
vividness, not to say actual morbidity
with which the machinations of the
crazed hero's so-called "mind" are por
trayed, in unexpurgated form, will ap
peal strongly to many children.
Another of these charming tales
deals with the life of Oscar Wilde.
There are several translations from :
the "Decameron" of Bocaccio, and a
concluding sketch which has beauti
ful Pershing Square, in Los Angeles, j
for its setting.
All in all, we can heartily recom
mend this book to modern youngsters,
tor a decidedly broadening influence
which it will have on their impres
sionable minds. By the way, there is
one story about a broad —but read the
book yourself, and then go jump in
the furnace.
Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (G.
& C. Merriam Co.) By Noah Web
ster.
The police, says Webster, are a 1
body of civil officers. Recalling our last
experience with a somewhat tempera
mental speed cop just outside Gon
zales, we wonder if the author can be
spoofing us.
Seriously, however, this best-seller,
although a bit heavy in parts (for
gawd's sake, don't drop it!), affords
some very entertaining reading, and
we recommend that some rainy couple
| of years when you have nothing else
to do you draw up a cozy chair before
a blazing fireplace and drop the vol
ume on top of the merry yule log.
One of the first things about this |
book to impress the casual reader is
the author's amazing command of lan-1
guage. Without fear of contradiction
we can say that Webster possesses
the largest vocabulary of any writer !
who ever lived, even including the j
I immortal Will Shakespeare who knew i
about 40,000 words too many himself.'
While we understand that this vol
; ume has been suppressed by the |
Watch and Ward society of Boston j
! on the charges of having a picture of j
the Venus de Milo on page 3G47, as-1
I sault and battery, and reckless driv- j
ing, the unbiased reader will realize
that even in the more sordid bits Web-!
! ster is motivated wholly by his ideal
of presenting a true picture of life, j
i The charges of cheap sensationalism ,
often made against Webster are en- |
tirely without basis.
In fact at times the author even be
comes a bit naive. For example, when
j Philip, who is in love with Suzanne,
I although actually at the time married
i to her aunt's cook, remarks to Jeeks,
! the Warehouseham's butler:
j "Observance (L. ovresv-ae. Fr. ob
servance) —the act of observing."
Probably the chief feature of this '
popular work is the author's amazing
fund of information. At last we have
found someone who knows even more
than Philo Vance, nonchalant hero of
the Insertnameof Murder Case, who
apparently once read Webster's book
but remembered only about jiine
tenths of it. Oh well, we're all hnman.
j Just by the way of pointing out the

author's remarkable store of knowl
edge, did you know that a cotswold
is a stretch of open country used for j
sheep-grazing? Neither did we.
Utopian Directory of Offfcers and Stu

With the quiet restraint and the
utter simplicity which characterizes
Greek art at its heights of perfection
comes the Utopian Directory of Of
ficers and Students from the Utopia
Press. It is one of those rare books i
which every reviewer can genuinely I
recommend to his readers as interest
ing in every detail. It is bound to be i
; one fo the season's most popular
| books because of its wide scope and '
its intimate human interest.
The novel is realistic in material, j
and impressionistic in treatment. It
calls a spade a spade, or rather it calls
Arthur James Eaton just plainly and
simply Arthur James Eaton. There
; are no words except the last three in
I the preceding sentence wasted in this
book. Its directness is its main vir
tue. Its clear lucid style is delight- |
fully refreshing.
There is a charm of sublety about
this work that sets the imagination !
on fire. The brief descriptions given i
of the various characters serve to
kindle the flames of curiosity and in
crease the mental agility of the
reader. When one reads: "Richard
Ward Dyer . . Oakland . . LD 25-12 '
;. . . 449 Encina," one has all the es- i
1 sential elements of a vivid narrative |
with none of the tribing inconsequen
tials that insult a reader's intelligence, i
"The fierce economy that is true art"
is revealed in the novel. It isn't what
is said by the description of "Frank 1
Theopilous Lee . . . San Francisco
... Econ. 136+46 . . . Alpha Delta j
Phi" but it is what is left unsaid that
gives the book its subtle distinction, i
The novel has no particular story. J
The author didn't intend it to have. ,
It is simply a picture of college life,
clearly drawn, with interest for all
from the poorest student to Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur. It has wit —"Anne
j Huskel Secretary of Civil Engineer- i
ing, Edminster Cutter Professor of
Mechanical Engineering" — humor, '
especially in that delightful sketch of |
the fire whistles, G2, dear readers, of
these whistles signifying that the sta
dium is a blazing conflagration, and
lastly, the book has color with its '
touches of White, Black, Gray, Green,
Blue, to say nothing of Cherry.

Telephone Directory. By Bell.
Promising to be by far the most
popular work of the season in the
younger circles, the Telephone Direc
tory compels the attention and inter
est of every wide-awake and progres
sive individual.
Miss Bell has incorporated in her
latest work a universal appeal, and
written in a style so lucid and simple,
according to a plan so accurate and
appropriate that a child can recognize
its worth. For the lover of adventure
and mystery, a random, haphazard
perusal of the publication offers all
the excitement of a Conrad romance,
and all the uncertainty of the Canary
Murder Case. To quote:
"Übxlrelitz, Zonius, Y; 49 Back Al
ley: Palo Alto 463-X."
What more does the reader ask in
the way of uncertainty? The reference
may be to a female. It may be to a
male. The absorbing doubt leads the
i reader to investigate. He rings up
j 4G3X or calls at 49 Back Alley. He
I waits the solution, trembling. And
then .... But I will not spoil it.
You must discover the secret your
self.
And for the conservative, the shy,
! even the bashful, whose perusal is
limited to excerpts, to bits with
which he is familiar, for the timor
ous, there is always the chance of a
wrong number. Each time he goes to
its pages he may well murmur in si
lent rapture, "Perhaps this time I
shall meet adventure, become ac
quainted with the great unknown. God
, knows what may happen."
Not the least charming feature of
Miss Bell's great work is the realism,
the local color, and the inclusive dra
matis personae that distinguishes her
writing. To become familiar with her
! work is to know the entire locality of
*
which she writes —a liberal education
, in itself.
Nor can the authoress be charged
with the use of airy or arid material,
| with frivolity and froth. Not a word
is used that could be spared, each is
terribly significant to someone. Sho
: is comprehensive, complete in her
books, but far from redundant..

Grimm Fairy Tales, Barnyard McFat
ten Publish Co., 1929.
Here is a collection of rousing juve
nile stories written in the modern
manner especially for the modern
child. There is nothing of the frilly
wishy-washy sort of thing that wa.)
so popular a few years ago to bo
found in this up-to-the-minute volume.

There are stories by such well-known
children's writers as Madame Elinor
Glynn, Theodore Dreiser, Ben Hecht, !
and Brann, the Iconoclast, and the
stories deal, not with the stereotyped
Hansel and Gretel, the puling Tom
Thumb, and their ilk, but with such I
fascinating characters as appear in
Dreiser's well-known "American Trav
esty," and in the Glynn's "Eight
Months and Two Weeks."
These stories should appeal particu-!
larly to the child, be he young or old,
who is interested in Freudianism, and
Psychology, for the problems which!
these stories present are very Psycho
logical. For example, one of the
shorter stories by Jim Tully, deals
with a crazed lover who brutally mur
ders his unfaithful mistress, strangles j
his three illegitimate children, and |
lives happily ever after with a drab
whom lie has picked up on the corner
of Fifth Avenue and Market St. This :
story is very Psychological, and the i
vividness, not to say actual morbidity
with which the machinations of the
crazed hero's so-called "mind" are por
trayed, in unexpurgated form, will ap
peal strongly to many children.
Another of these charming tales
deals with the life of Oscar Wilde.
There are several translations from :
the "Decameron" of Bocaccio, and a
concluding sketch which has beauti
ful Pershing Square, in Los Angeles, j
for its setting.
All in all, we can heartily recom
mend this book to modern youngsters,
tor a decidedly broadening influence
which it will have on their impres
sionable minds. By the way, there is
one story about a broad —but read the
book yourself, and then go jump in
the furnace.
Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (G.
& C. Merriam Co.) By Noah Web
ster.
The police, says Webster, are a 1
body of civil officers. Recalling our last
experience with a somewhat tempera
mental speed cop just outside Gon
zales, we wonder if the author can be
spoofing us.
Seriously, however, this best-seller,
although a bit heavy in parts (for
gawd's sake, don't drop it!), affords
some very entertaining reading, and
we recommend that some rainy couple
| of years when you have nothing else
to do you draw up a cozy chair before
a blazing fireplace and drop the vol
ume on top of the merry yule log.
One of the first things about this |
book to impress the casual reader is
the author's amazing command of lan-1
guage. Without fear of contradiction
we can say that Webster possesses
the largest vocabulary of any writer !
who ever lived, even including the j
I immortal Will Shakespeare who knew i
about 40,000 words too many himself.'
While we understand that this vol
; ume has been suppressed by the |
Watch and Ward society of Boston j
! on the charges of having a picture of j
the Venus de Milo on page 3G47, as-1
I sault and battery, and reckless driv- j
ing, the unbiased reader will realize
that even in the more sordid bits Web-!
! ster is motivated wholly by his ideal
of presenting a true picture of life, j
i The charges of cheap sensationalism ,
often made against Webster are en- |
tirely without basis.
In fact at times the author even be
comes a bit naive. For example, when
j Philip, who is in love with Suzanne,
I although actually at the time married
i to her aunt's cook, remarks to Jeeks,
! the Warehouseham's butler:
j "Observance (L. ovresv-ae. Fr. ob
servance) —the act of observing."
Probably the chief feature of this '
popular work is the author's amazing
fund of information. At last we have
found someone who knows even more
than Philo Vance, nonchalant hero of
the Insertnameof Murder Case, who
apparently once read Webster's book
but remembered only about jiine
tenths of it. Oh well, we're all hnman.
j Just by the way of pointing out the

author's remarkable store of knowl
edge, did you know that a cotswold
is a stretch of open country used for j
sheep-grazing? Neither did we.

With the quiet restraint and the
utter simplicity which characterizes
Greek art at its heights of perfection
comes the Utopian Directory of Of
ficers and Students from the Utopia
Press. It is one of those rare books i
which every reviewer can genuinely I
recommend to his readers as interest
ing in every detail. It is bound to be i
; one fo the season's most popular
| books because of its wide scope and '
its intimate human interest.
The novel is realistic in material, j
and impressionistic in treatment. It
calls a spade a spade, or rather it calls
Arthur James Eaton just plainly and
simply Arthur James Eaton. There
; are no words except the last three in
I the preceding sentence wasted in this
book. Its directness is its main vir
tue. Its clear lucid style is delight- |
fully refreshing.
There is a charm of sublety about
this work that sets the imagination !
on fire. The brief descriptions given i
of the various characters serve to
kindle the flames of curiosity and in
crease the mental agility of the
reader. When one reads: "Richard
Ward Dyer . . Oakland . . LD 25-12 '
;. . . 449 Encina," one has all the es- i
1 sential elements of a vivid narrative |
with none of the tribing inconsequen
tials that insult a reader's intelligence, i
"The fierce economy that is true art"
is revealed in the novel. It isn't what
is said by the description of "Frank 1
Theopilous Lee . . . San Francisco
... Econ. 136+46 . . . Alpha Delta j
Phi" but it is what is left unsaid that
gives the book its subtle distinction, i
The novel has no particular story. J
The author didn't intend it to have. ,
It is simply a picture of college life,
clearly drawn, with interest for all
from the poorest student to Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur. It has wit —"Anne

Telephone Directory. By Bell.
Promising to be by far the most
popular work of the season in the
younger circles, the Telephone Direc
tory compels the attention and inter
est of every wide-awake and progres
sive individual.
Miss Bell has incorporated in her
latest work a universal appeal, and
written in a style so lucid and simple,
according to a plan so accurate and
appropriate that a child can recognize
its worth. For the lover of adventure
and mystery, a random, haphazard
perusal of the publication offers all
the excitement of a Conrad romance,
and all the uncertainty of the Canary
Murder Case. To quote:
"Übxlrelitz, Zonius, Y; 49 Back Al
ley: Palo Alto 463-X."
What more does the reader ask in
the way of uncertainty? The reference
may be to a female. It may be to a
male. The absorbing doubt leads the
i reader to investigate. He rings up
j 4G3X or calls at 49 Back Alley. He
I waits the solution, trembling. And
then .... But I will not spoil it.
You must discover the secret your
self.
And for the conservative, the shy,
! even the bashful, whose perusal is
limited to excerpts, to bits with
which he is familiar, for the timor
ous, there is always the chance of a
wrong number. Each time he goes to
its pages he may well murmur in si
lent rapture, "Perhaps this time I
shall meet adventure, become ac
quainted with the great unknown. God
, knows what may happen."
Not the least charming feature of
Miss Bell's great work is the realism,
the local color, and the inclusive dra
matis personae that distinguishes her
writing. To become familiar with her
! work is to know the entire locality of
*
which she writes —a liberal education
, in itself.
Nor can the authoress be charged
with the use of airy or arid material,
| with frivolity and froth. Not a word
is used that could be spared, each is
terribly significant to someone. Sho
: is comprehensive, complete in her
books, but far from redundant..

Grimm Fairy Tales, Barnyard McFat
ten Publish Co., 1929.
Here is a collection of rousing juve
nile stories written in the modern
manner especially for the modern
child. There is nothing of the frilly
wishy-washy sort of thing that wa.)
so popular a few years ago to bo
found in this up-to-the-minute volume.

There are stories by such well-known
children's writers as Madame Elinor
Glynn, Theodore Dreiser, Ben Hecht, !
and Brann, the Iconoclast, and the
stories deal, not with the stereotyped
Hansel and Gretel, the puling Tom
Thumb, and their ilk, but with such I
fascinating characters as appear in
Dreiser's well-known "American Trav
esty," and in the Glynn's "Eight
Months and Two Weeks."
These stories should appeal particu-!
larly to the child, be he young or old,
who is interested in Freudianism, and
Psychology, for the problems which!
these stories present are very Psycho
logical. For example, one of the
shorter stories by Jim Tully, deals
with a crazed lover who brutally mur
ders his unfaithful mistress, strangles j
his three illegitimate children, and |
lives happily ever after with a drab
whom lie has picked up on the corner
of Fifth Avenue and Market St. This :
story is very Psychological, and the i
vividness, not to say actual morbidity
with which the machinations of the
crazed hero's so-called "mind" are por
trayed, in unexpurgated form, will ap
peal strongly to many children.
Another of these charming tales
deals with the life of Oscar Wilde.
There are several translations from :
the "Decameron" of Bocaccio, and a
concluding sketch which has beauti
ful Pershing Square, in Los Angeles, j
for its setting.
All in all, we can heartily recom
mend this book to modern youngsters,
tor a decidedly broadening influence
which it will have on their impres
sionable minds. By the way, there is
one story about a broad —but read the
book yourself, and then go jump in
the furnace.
Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (G.
& C. Merriam Co.) By Noah Web
ster.
The police, says Webster, are a 1
body of civil officers. Recalling our last
experience with a somewhat tempera
mental speed cop just outside Gon
zales, we wonder if the author can be
spoofing us.
Seriously, however, this best-seller,
although a bit heavy in parts (for
gawd's sake, don't drop it!), affords
some very entertaining reading, and
we recommend that some rainy couple
| of years when you have nothing else
to do you draw up a cozy chair before
a blazing fireplace and drop the vol
ume on top of the merry yule log.
One of the first things about this |
book to impress the casual reader is
the author's amazing command of lan-1
guage. Without fear of contradiction
we can say that Webster possesses
the largest vocabulary of any writer !
who ever lived, even including the j
I immortal Will Shakespeare who knew i
about 40,000 words too many himself.'
While we understand that this vol
; ume has been suppressed by the |
Watch and Ward society of Boston j
! on the charges of having a picture of j
the Venus de Milo on page 3G47, as-1
I sault and battery, and reckless driv- j
ing, the unbiased reader will realize
that even in the more sordid bits Web-!
! ster is motivated wholly by his ideal
of presenting a true picture of life, j
i The charges of cheap sensationalism ,
often made against Webster are en- |
tirely without basis.
In fact at times the author even be
comes a bit naive. For example, when
j Philip, who is in love with Suzanne,
I although actually at the time married
i to her aunt's cook, remarks to Jeeks,
! the Warehouseham's butler:
j "Observance (L. ovresv-ae. Fr. ob
servance) —the act of observing."
Probably the chief feature of this '
popular work is the author's amazing
fund of information. At last we have
found someone who knows even more
than Philo Vance, nonchalant hero of
the Insertnameof Murder Case, who
apparently once read Webster's book
but remembered only about jiine
tenths of it. Oh well, we're all hnman.
j Just by the way of pointing out the

author's remarkable store of knowl
edge, did you know that a cotswold
is a stretch of open country used for j
sheep-grazing? Neither did we.

With the quiet restraint and the

which every reviewer can genuinely I
recommend to his readers as interest

The novel is realistic in material, j

Arthur James Eaton just plainly and

fully refreshing.
There is a charm of sublety about
this work that sets the imagination !

of the various characters serve to
kindle the flames of curiosity and in
crease the mental agility of the
reader. When one reads: "Richard

Telephone Directory. By Bell.
Promising to be by far the most
popular work of the season in the
younger circles, the Telephone Direc
tory compels the attention and inter
est of every wide-awake and progres
sive individual.
Miss Bell has incorporated in her
latest work a universal appeal, and
written in a style so lucid and simple,
according to a plan so accurate and
appropriate that a child can recognize
its worth. For the lover of adventure
and mystery, a random, haphazard
perusal of the publication offers all
the excitement of a Conrad romance,
and all the uncertainty of the Canary
Murder Case. To quote:
"Übxlrelitz, Zonius, Y; 49 Back Al
ley: Palo Alto 463-X."
What more does the reader ask in
the way of uncertainty? The reference
may be to a female. It may be to a
male. The absorbing doubt leads the
i reader to investigate. He rings up
j 4G3X or calls at 49 Back Alley. He
I waits the solution, trembling. And
then .... But I will not spoil it.

And for the conservative, the shy,

wrong number. Each time he goes to
its pages he may well murmur in si
lent rapture, "Perhaps this time I
shall meet adventure, become ac
quainted with the great unknown. God
, knows what may happen."
Not the least charming feature of
Miss Bell's great work is the realism,
the local color, and the inclusive dra
matis personae that distinguishes her
writing. To become familiar with her
! work is to know the entire locality of
*
which she writes —a liberal education
, in itself.
Nor can the authoress be charged
with the use of airy or arid material,
| with frivolity and froth. Not a word
is used that could be spared, each is
terribly significant to someone. Sho

Grimm Fairy Tales, Barnyard McFat
ten Publish Co., 1929.
Here is a collection of rousing juve
nile stories written in the modern
manner especially for the modern
child. There is nothing of the frilly
wishy-washy sort of thing that wa.)
so popular a few years ago to bo
found in this up-to-the-minute volume.

There are stories by such well-known
children's writers as Madame Elinor
Glynn, Theodore Dreiser, Ben Hecht, !
and Brann, the Iconoclast, and the
stories deal, not with the stereotyped
Hansel and Gretel, the puling Tom
Thumb, and their ilk, but with such I
fascinating characters as appear in
Dreiser's well-known "American Trav
esty," and in the Glynn's "Eight
Months and Two Weeks."
These stories should appeal particu-!
larly to the child, be he young or old,
who is interested in Freudianism, and
Psychology, for the problems which!
these stories present are very Psycho
logical. For example, one of the
shorter stories by Jim Tully, deals
with a crazed lover who brutally mur
ders his unfaithful mistress, strangles j
his three illegitimate children, and |
lives happily ever after with a drab
whom lie has picked up on the corner
of Fifth Avenue and Market St. This :
story is very Psychological, and the i
vividness, not to say actual morbidity
with which the machinations of the
crazed hero's so-called "mind" are por
trayed, in unexpurgated form, will ap
peal strongly to many children.
Another of these charming tales
deals with the life of Oscar Wilde.
There are several translations from :
the "Decameron" of Bocaccio, and a
concluding sketch which has beauti
ful Pershing Square, in Los Angeles, j
for its setting.
All in all, we can heartily recom
mend this book to modern youngsters,
tor a decidedly broadening influence
which it will have on their impres
sionable minds. By the way, there is
one story about a broad —but read the
book yourself, and then go jump in
the furnace.
Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (G.

The police, says Webster, are a 1
body of civil officers. Recalling our last
experience with a somewhat tempera
mental speed cop just outside Gon
zales, we wonder if the author can be
spoofing us.
Seriously, however, this best-seller,
although a bit heavy in parts (for
gawd's sake, don't drop it!), affords
some very entertaining reading, and
we recommend that some rainy couple
| of years when you have nothing else
to do you draw up a cozy chair before
a blazing fireplace and drop the vol
ume on top of the merry yule log.
One of the first things about this |
book to impress the casual reader is
the author's amazing command of lan-1
guage. Without fear of contradiction
we can say that Webster possesses
the largest vocabulary of any writer !
who ever lived, even including the j
I immortal Will Shakespeare who knew i
about 40,000 words too many himself.'
While we understand that this vol
; ume has been suppressed by the |
Watch and Ward society of Boston j
! on the charges of having a picture of j
the Venus de Milo on page 3G47, as-1
I sault and battery, and reckless driv- j
ing, the unbiased reader will realize
that even in the more sordid bits Web-!
! ster is motivated wholly by his ideal
of presenting a true picture of life, j
i The charges of cheap sensationalism ,
often made against Webster are en- |
tirely without basis.
In fact at times the author even be
comes a bit naive. For example, when
j Philip, who is in love with Suzanne,
I although actually at the time married
i to her aunt's cook, remarks to Jeeks,
! the Warehouseham's butler:
j "Observance (L. ovresv-ae. Fr. ob
servance) —the act of observing."
Probably the chief feature of this '
popular work is the author's amazing
fund of information. At last we have
found someone who knows even more
than Philo Vance, nonchalant hero of
the Insertnameof Murder Case, who
apparently once read Webster's book
but remembered only about jiine
tenths of it. Oh well, we're all hnman.
j Just by the way of pointing out the

author's remarkable store of knowl
edge, did you know that a cotswold
is a stretch of open country used for j
sheep-grazing? Neither did we.

Telephone Directory. By Bell.
Promising to be by far the most
popular work of the season in the
younger circles, the Telephone Direc
tory compels the attention and inter
est of every wide-awake and progres
sive individual.
Miss Bell has incorporated in her
latest work a universal appeal, and
written in a style so lucid and simple,
according to a plan so accurate and
appropriate that a child can recognize
its worth. For the lover of adventure
and mystery, a random, haphazard
perusal of the publication offers all
the excitement of a Conrad romance,
and all the uncertainty of the Canary
Murder Case. To quote:
"Übxlrelitz, Zonius, Y; 49 Back Al
ley: Palo Alto 463-X."
What more does the reader ask in
the way of uncertainty? The reference
may be to a female. It may be to a
male. The absorbing doubt leads the
i reader to investigate. He rings up
j 4G3X or calls at 49 Back Alley. He
I waits the solution, trembling. And
then .... But I will not spoil it.
You must discover the secret your
self.
And for the conservative, the shy,
! even the bashful, whose perusal is
limited to excerpts, to bits with
which he is familiar, for the timor
ous, there is always the chance of a
wrong number. Each time he goes to
its pages he may well murmur in si
lent rapture, "Perhaps this time I
shall meet adventure, become ac
quainted with the great unknown. God
, knows what may happen."
Not the least charming feature of
Miss Bell's great work is the realism,
the local color, and the inclusive dra
matis personae that distinguishes her
writing. To become familiar with her
! work is to know the entire locality of
*
which she writes —a liberal education
, in itself.
Nor can the authoress be charged
with the use of airy or arid material,
| with frivolity and froth. Not a word
is used that could be spared, each is
terribly significant to someone. Sho
: is comprehensive, complete in her
books, but far from redundant..

Grimm Fairy Tales, Barnyard McFat
ten Publish Co., 1929.
Here is a collection of rousing juve
nile stories written in the modern
manner especially for the modern
child. There is nothing of the frilly
wishy-washy sort of thing that wa.)
so popular a few years ago to bo
found in this up-to-the-minute volume.

There are stories by such well-known
children's writers as Madame Elinor
Glynn, Theodore Dreiser, Ben Hecht, !
and Brann, the Iconoclast, and the
stories deal, not with the stereotyped
Hansel and Gretel, the puling Tom
Thumb, and their ilk, but with such I
fascinating characters as appear in
Dreiser's well-known "American Trav
esty," and in the Glynn's "Eight
Months and Two Weeks."
These stories should appeal particu-!
larly to the child, be he young or old,
who is interested in Freudianism, and
Psychology, for the problems which!
these stories present are very Psycho
logical. For example, one of the
shorter stories by Jim Tully, deals
with a crazed lover who brutally mur
ders his unfaithful mistress, strangles j
his three illegitimate children, and |
lives happily ever after with a drab
whom lie has picked up on the corner
of Fifth Avenue and Market St. This :
story is very Psychological, and the i
vividness, not to say actual morbidity
with which the machinations of the
crazed hero's so-called "mind" are por
trayed, in unexpurgated form, will ap
peal strongly to many children.
Another of these charming tales
deals with the life of Oscar Wilde.
There are several translations from :
the "Decameron" of Bocaccio, and a
concluding sketch which has beauti
ful Pershing Square, in Los Angeles, j
for its setting.
All in all, we can heartily recom
mend this book to modern youngsters,
tor a decidedly broadening influence
which it will have on their impres
sionable minds. By the way, there is
one story about a broad —but read the
book yourself, and then go jump in
the furnace.
Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (G.

ster.
The police, says Webster, are a 1
body of civil officers. Recalling our last
experience with a somewhat tempera
mental speed cop just outside Gon
zales, we wonder if the author can be
spoofing us.
Seriously, however, this best-seller,
although a bit heavy in parts (for
gawd's sake, don't drop it!), affords
some very entertaining reading, and
we recommend that some rainy couple
| of years when you have nothing else
to do you draw up a cozy chair before
a blazing fireplace and drop the vol
ume on top of the merry yule log.
One of the first things about this |
book to impress the casual reader is
the author's amazing command of lan-1
guage. Without fear of contradiction
we can say that Webster possesses
the largest vocabulary of any writer !
who ever lived, even including the j
I immortal Will Shakespeare who knew i
about 40,000 words too many himself.'
While we understand that this vol
; ume has been suppressed by the |
Watch and Ward society of Boston j
! on the charges of having a picture of j
the Venus de Milo on page 3G47, as-1
I sault and battery, and reckless driv- j
ing, the unbiased reader will realize
that even in the more sordid bits Web-!
! ster is motivated wholly by his ideal
of presenting a true picture of life, j
i The charges of cheap sensationalism ,
often made against Webster are en- |
tirely without basis.
In fact at times the author even be
comes a bit naive. For example, when
j Philip, who is in love with Suzanne,
I although actually at the time married
i to her aunt's cook, remarks to Jeeks,
! the Warehouseham's butler:
j "Observance (L. ovresv-ae. Fr. ob
servance) —the act of observing."
Probably the chief feature of this '
popular work is the author's amazing
fund of information. At last we have
found someone who knows even more
than Philo Vance, nonchalant hero of
the Insertnameof Murder Case, who
apparently once read Webster's book
but remembered only about jiine
tenths of it. Oh well, we're all hnman.
j Just by the way of pointing out the

author's remarkable store of knowl
edge, did you know that a cotswold
is a stretch of open country used for j
sheep-grazing? Neither did we.

With the quiet restraint and the
utter simplicity which characterizes
Greek art at its heights of perfection
comes the Utopian Directory of Of
ficers and Students from the Utopia
Press. It is one of those rare books i
which every reviewer can genuinely I
recommend to his readers as interest
ing in every detail. It is bound to be i
; one fo the season's most popular
| books because of its wide scope and '
its intimate human interest.
The novel is realistic in material, j
and impressionistic in treatment. It
calls a spade a spade, or rather it calls
Arthur James Eaton just plainly and
simply Arthur James Eaton. There
; are no words except the last three in
I the preceding sentence wasted in this
book. Its directness is its main vir
tue. Its clear lucid style is delight- |
fully refreshing.
There is a charm of sublety about
this work that sets the imagination !
on fire. The brief descriptions given i
of the various characters serve to
kindle the flames of curiosity and in
crease the mental agility of the
reader. When one reads: "Richard

gives the book its subtle distinction, i
The novel has no particular story. J
The author didn't intend it to have. ,

How to say what you have to say
in such a way that nobody can under
stand you. Where to put commas. How
to make a period. When a quotation
is not a quotation. These, and many
other similarly confusing problems
are answered in this neat little text.
For sheer unadulterated pleasure
this little book is unrivaled. Read it
and forget your (other) troubles.

A perfectly charming little book.
How to cook tliree-minute eggs, and
what's wrong in Nicaragua—every
thing, EVERYTHING, is told clearly
and plainly in so many words (oh, so
many words!).
Tables showing the mortality rates,

! text. Calculations which show to the

if laid end to end, it would take to

the pleasure of reading this admirable

Telephone Directory. By Bell.
Promising to be by far the most
popular work of the season in the
younger circles, the Telephone Direc
tory compels the attention and inter
est of every wide-awake and progres
sive individual.
Miss Bell has incorporated in her
latest work a universal appeal, and
written in a style so lucid and simple,
according to a plan so accurate and
appropriate that a child can recognize
its worth. For the lover of adventure
and mystery, a random, haphazard
perusal of the publication offers all
the excitement of a Conrad romance,
and all the uncertainty of the Canary
Murder Case. To quote:
"Übxlrelitz, Zonius, Y; 49 Back Al
ley: Palo Alto 463-X."
What more does the reader ask in
the way of uncertainty? The reference
may be to a female. It may be to a
male. The absorbing doubt leads the
i reader to investigate. He rings up
j 4G3X or calls at 49 Back Alley. He
I waits the solution, trembling. And
then .... But I will not spoil it.
You must discover the secret your
self.
And for the conservative, the shy,
! even the bashful, whose perusal is
limited to excerpts, to bits with
which he is familiar, for the timor
ous, there is always the chance of a
wrong number. Each time he goes to
its pages he may well murmur in si
lent rapture, "Perhaps this time I
shall meet adventure, become ac
quainted with the great unknown. God
, knows what may happen."
Not the least charming feature of
Miss Bell's great work is the realism,
the local color, and the inclusive dra
matis personae that distinguishes her
writing. To become familiar with her
! work is to know the entire locality of
*
which she writes —a liberal education
, in itself.
Nor can the authoress be charged
with the use of airy or arid material,
| with frivolity and froth. Not a word
is used that could be spared, each is
terribly significant to someone. Sho
: is comprehensive, complete in her
books, but far from redundant..
The next time you have an empty
evening, I suggest that you let the
Telephone Directory solve your prob
lem.
Grimm Fairy Tales, Barnyard McFat
ten Publish Co., 1929.
Here is a collection of rousing juve
nile stories written in the modern
manner especially for the modern
child. There is nothing of the frilly
wishy-washy sort of thing that wa.)
so popular a few years ago to bo
found in this up-to-the-minute volume.

There are stories by such well-known
children's writers as Madame Elinor
Glynn, Theodore Dreiser, Ben Hecht, !
and Brann, the Iconoclast, and the
stories deal, not with the stereotyped
Hansel and Gretel, the puling Tom
Thumb, and their ilk, but with such I
fascinating characters as appear in
Dreiser's well-known "American Trav
esty," and in the Glynn's "Eight
Months and Two Weeks."
These stories should appeal particu-!
larly to the child, be he young or old,
who is interested in Freudianism, and
Psychology, for the problems which!
these stories present are very Psycho
logical. For example, one of the
shorter stories by Jim Tully, deals
with a crazed lover who brutally mur
ders his unfaithful mistress, strangles j
his three illegitimate children, and |
lives happily ever after with a drab
whom lie has picked up on the corner
of Fifth Avenue and Market St. This :
story is very Psychological, and the i
vividness, not to say actual morbidity
with which the machinations of the
crazed hero's so-called "mind" are por
trayed, in unexpurgated form, will ap
peal strongly to many children.
Another of these charming tales
deals with the life of Oscar Wilde.
There are several translations from :
the "Decameron" of Bocaccio, and a
concluding sketch which has beauti
ful Pershing Square, in Los Angeles, j
for its setting.
All in all, we can heartily recom
mend this book to modern youngsters,
tor a decidedly broadening influence
which it will have on their impres
sionable minds. By the way, there is
one story about a broad —but read the
book yourself, and then go jump in
the furnace.
Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (G.
& C. Merriam Co.) By Noah Web
ster.
The police, says Webster, are a 1
body of civil officers. Recalling our last
experience with a somewhat tempera
mental speed cop just outside Gon
zales, we wonder if the author can be
spoofing us.
Seriously, however, this best-seller,
although a bit heavy in parts (for
gawd's sake, don't drop it!), affords
some very entertaining reading, and
we recommend that some rainy couple
| of years when you have nothing else
to do you draw up a cozy chair before
a blazing fireplace and drop the vol
ume on top of the merry yule log.
One of the first things about this |
book to impress the casual reader is
the author's amazing command of lan-1
guage. Without fear of contradiction
we can say that Webster possesses
the largest vocabulary of any writer !
who ever lived, even including the j
I immortal Will Shakespeare who knew i
about 40,000 words too many himself.'
While we understand that this vol
; ume has been suppressed by the |
Watch and Ward society of Boston j
! on the charges of having a picture of j
the Venus de Milo on page 3G47, as-1
I sault and battery, and reckless driv- j
ing, the unbiased reader will realize
that even in the more sordid bits Web-!
! ster is motivated wholly by his ideal
of presenting a true picture of life, j
i The charges of cheap sensationalism ,
often made against Webster are en- |
tirely without basis.
In fact at times the author even be
comes a bit naive. For example, when
j Philip, who is in love with Suzanne,
I although actually at the time married
i to her aunt's cook, remarks to Jeeks,
! the Warehouseham's butler:
j "Observance (L. ovresv-ae. Fr. ob
servance) —the act of observing."
Probably the chief feature of this '
popular work is the author's amazing
fund of information. At last we have
found someone who knows even more
than Philo Vance, nonchalant hero of
the Insertnameof Murder Case, who
apparently once read Webster's book
but remembered only about jiine
tenths of it. Oh well, we're all hnman.
j Just by the way of pointing out the

author's remarkable store of knowl

is a stretch of open country used for j
sheep-grazing? Neither did we.
