# ROOTING SECTION TO DRAW CHECKS STATES MASTERS
## B.A.C. Authorities Offer Own Salaries Up In Big Sacrifice To University Students 
### 
Feeling that stunts and cheering of
the rooting section are as much a fea
ture of intercollegiate contests as the
games themselves, Alfred It. Masters,
manager of the Utopia Board of Ath
letic Control, today announced that
in the future students sitting in the
rooting section at the Utopia-Califor
nia and Utopia-West Point football
games will ho paid five dollars each
for their services. This move by the
Board of Athletic Control is in keep
ing with their recently outlined policy
of admitting possessors of student
body cards free to all athletic con
tests.
In addition, Masters said that it
was decided to pay student traffic
police, ticket-takers, and ushers two
dollars an hour instead of the previ
ous rate of fifty cents an hour. Mas
ters urged that ticket-takers take ad
vantage of their opportunities to let
any of heir friends not owning stu
dent body cards pass free into all
games. "All we want," said Masters,
"Js to see everyone happy. Engraved
upon our hearts is the motto of the
Utopian Board of Athletic Control —
'The customer is always right.' "
The decrease in gate receipts re
sulting from this new policy of the
Board will be made up, Masters ex
plained, by cutting down the salaries
of the executive officers. The man
ager said that he had reduced his
own salary to only $30,000.00 a year,
while O. H. "Smiling Tommy" Tucker,
has announced that he will he glad
to work for nothing. Tucker, it will
be remembered, recently refused the
offer by President-elect Hoover of an
appointment as ambassador to Eng
land.
"I never was good at foreign lan
guages," said Tucker, in explaining
his unwillingness to accept the post.
"Anyway, I like my job at Utopia
so well that it is a pleasure to work
for nothing. If I need money, I can
always go back to prize-fighting, or
sell my hat to a museum."
