# APPLE POLISHER OF LATEST DESIGN NOW AVAILABLE FOR USE
## 
### 
Apple-polisliing machines of the i
latest design were today placed at
tho Engineering corner, the Law steps, i
and in the court of the Inner Quad, i
by order of the Honor Code Council.
Differences in the ability of stu- j
dents to obtain good grades by the
old hand-polishing system led to the i
purchase of the new machines, it was j
announced. By use of tlie machines, 1
which are more efficient than the old i
methods, the best results are to be
obtained by all the members of tlie j
student body.
Use of unethical methods of apple-'
polishing will mean expulsion from
the university, according to members i
of the Honor Code Council, at whose
suggestion the new machines were
placed in use.
Result of Research
The apple-polishing machine was i
developed as the result of years of
research by members of Phi Beta
Kappa. It is an extremely complicated
contrivance, and has 345,749 parts, all
automatically oiled from a central
tank. Tho lubricant used, a rare and
costly variety known as the "midnight
oil," is to be bought by the Board of ]
Athletic Control.
Restriction of the use of the ma
chines to once daily for each student j
is to be enforced, it was announced, j
Student body cards must be presented j
as one prepares to use the machine, !
which will refuse to serve any stu- |
dent who has ever cheated in an ex- 1
animation. The machine, which is al
most human in its understanding of
the ways of instructors, has been pat
ented under the name of Ilin Tin Tin.
Its soulful brown eyes, which are
cleverly constructed of hand-polished
wood, are said to be tho biggest fea
ture of its appeal,
A filler is a bit of type or plate
used between the end of a story or
advertisement and the beginning of
the next. This is a fair sample, both
as to size and coutent. 1
