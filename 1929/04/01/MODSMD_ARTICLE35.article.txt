# DORMIR-TUTOR WILL BE INSTALLED SOON IN STUDENTS' ROOMS
## Noiseless Device Is Easy To Operate, Soothes Nerves And Covers All Subjects 
### 
A device, whereby students may ab
sorb, acquire, and retain knowledge
while asleep, has recently been de
vloped in the research laboratories
of Utopia." Patents have been granted
and an effort to train the minds of
Utopia students.
The "Dormir-tutor" is a noiseless,
electrical appliance that is to be worn
by the student upon retiring. Electric
impulses are carried to the sleeping
brain and are reiterated through the
night until the impression is finally
made. These impulses cannot be felt
by the unconscious student, and in
spite of his mental condition he is
capable of learning all that the
"Dormir-tutor" dictates. Technically
the D.T., as it shall be known in its
more popular sense, is a cross be
tween the lintotype, the stock market
ticker, and an Edison cylinder-type
phonograph. Practically, the D.T. has
the soothing effect of the quiet drone
of a dentist's drill. This will be con
sidered quite a relief from the profes
sors the students already used to.
The dormitories will soon be fully
equipped with D.T.'s in such a way
that any Utopia student may plug in
on his favorite study before retiring
and awake with an astounding fund
of knowledge. Recent trial tests have
shown the Dormir-tutor to be a little
inconsistent in relaying the proper
impulses, but it is believed that such
a fault may be easier to correct in a
machine than in some of the profes
sors from the same technical diffi
culty.
