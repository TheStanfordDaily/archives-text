# NANNIE FURST SUFFERS BREAKDOWN WHEN LIT REJECTS SHORT STORY
## 
### 
Following the refusal of the Utopia
Literary Magazine to publish a story
submitted by Nannie Furst, the noted
authoress today went to a sanitarium.
She is suffering from shock caused
by extreme grief, whigli threatens to
seriously harm her health, her phsyi
cians declared.
"Blue," said Miss Furst. "Nothing
left in life. Suicide. Poison myself
with Listerine," she sobbed. As Miss
Furst seemed near a breakdown due
to the strain of answering questions
asked by reporters, authorities at the
sanitarium terminated the interview,
until she has regained her strength.
Editors of the magazine, when
asked to reconsider their decision
rather than take a chance on ruining
Miss Furst's literary career, said that
it would be impossible to alter their
decision unless Miss Furst rewrote
her story.
"Stories in the 'Lit' must have real
punchâ€”more than a well-known name
is needed to get a story into its pages.
We must maintain our literary stand
ards and ideals. Nothing remotely
smutty or off-color will be tolerated,"
the editor stated in explaining his ac
tion in turning down Miss Furst's con
tribution.
