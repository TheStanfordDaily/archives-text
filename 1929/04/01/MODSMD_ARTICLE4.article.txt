# Terman Fails to Pass Own Ex and Goes to Capital
## 
### 
Crushed and broken because of his
failure to pass one of his own famous
intelligence examinations, Dr. Louis
M. Terman, head of the Department
of Psychology at Utopia University,
today resigned his professorship. Dr.
Terman placed in Group 5, the lowest
division in the intelligence ratings,
i Dr. Terman is now eligible to be
come a member of Congress. He will
travel to Washington, D.C., to take his
seat within a few days,
Dr. Terman is the originator of the
famous intelligence test named after
him, to the pleasures of which many
California boys and girls have been
admitted. Their intelligence once es
tablished by his system, these chil
dren were forever after unable to rise
above his rating or fall below it.
Hundreds upon hundreds of budding
geniuses have come to full bloom un
der the influence of the ratings,
while other hundreds of nit-wits today
have gone to seed in many so-called
institutions of higher learning.
The loss of Dr. Terman will be a
great blow to Utopia.
