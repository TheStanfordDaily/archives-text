# MUDDY MUTE MESSES DEBATE, DENTS DIGIT

### 
A broken finger and an audience
I decision in favor of Utopia were the
outstanding events of last night's
frothy debate with the Napa Deaf and
, Dumb School on the subject, "Re
solved, That all politicians be re
quired to use Ivory Soap."
Phil Cavalero opened the negative
argument for Utopia. "America does
n't need rules to make clean politi
cians; what it needs is a code, not a
system of cleanliness. Let's abolish
j dirtiness," concluded Cavalero, "but
1 not with Ivory Soap."
A1 Palmolive appeared for the Napa
institution dressed as a muddy politi
cian. He gave a convincing series of
gestures, but suddenly collapsed as
one of his fingers snapped. He said
| later that he had injured himself
when he split an infinitive.

If all the money in the world were
placed at the disposal of university
I authorities, tuition would be only $99
,
