# JACOBSON GIVES LIE TO CHARGE THAT HIS GANG FIRED BONFIRE
## Plans Destruction of Next Year's Pyre While Giving Account of Conflagration 
### 
"Anyone who denies that the Rally
Committee burned down the bonfire
prematurely last fall is an unmiti
gated liar," thundered Jakie Jacobson
in an interview tomorrow afternoon
on the roof of the castle up on the
knoll,
"Why, damn it all, I was the one
who lit the pyre. About tea o'clock
011 the morning of that memorial con
flagration, I swaggered over to the
measley little pile of toothpicks and
ordered the 10.000 freshmen 011 guard
to trot down ot "Biff" Hoffman's chow
joint and get me a lollypop. No sooner
had the asinine rabble turned 'eyes
r.ght," etc., than I nonchalantly lit a
Murad, and incidentally along with
the Murad —the pyre itself."
And with this outburst Jakie broke
down in a fit of chuckles.
Regaining a bit of his normal com
posure, Jacobson & Self continued
to articulate in his deep contralto
voice. "Tsk! Tsk! Fair interviewer,
this is not for publication—unless I
get headlines. Here, have a cigar and
remember — HEADLINES. Modesty
forbids nie to ask for more. He! He!
"The Rally Committee of Utopia
University, of which as you all know
I am the head man, lias always been
the champion of good, clean fun.
Therefore, although I will probably
lie head man elsewhere, the Rally
Committee intends to build a bigger
and better bonfire next fall. And what
is more —WE, I mean the Rally Com
mittee, are going to burn it down
prematurely.
"Tut! Tut! Don't get excited, old
fellow, for after razing it to the
ground, WE will proceed to rebuild
it. There are several excellent rea
sons wiiy this should be done. First,
it is MY idea. Second, it is MY idea.
Third, it is MY idea. You, of course,
recognize that such arguments can
not be denied."
