## Present Danger Scouted As Santa Clara, San Mateo Shout Mutual Admiration

ROBLE OBSERVATORY, April I.—
"What was good enough for grand
lather is good enough for me." This
battle-cry, long the rallying slogan of
San Mateo and Santa Clara .Boards of!
Supervisors, has been discarded.
Instead the County Fathers have
adopted the motto, "A New Campus
Bridge by 1045."
In a joint meeting held last night
in the Stanford University bandstand (
before a large crowd of heavily armed 1
citizens, the Supervisors (1) dismissed
as "absurd" the charge that the Old
Iron Bridge behind the campus was
unsafe, (2) passed resolutions ex- j
pressing mutual admiration, and (!1) |
passed unanimously a motion to ad- I
journ.
Decision to build a new bridge by
1945 or so was followed by a hot j
debate, each Board insisting on the |
privilege of erecting the new struc-,
ture.
"Controller Almond Broth's state- 1
ment that the Iron Bridge is unfit for
use is ridiculous," said A. P. Ilooley,
Santa Clara Supervisor, from the
bridge district. "We are rebuilding
for aesthetic reasons. But," Hooley
insisted, "Santa Clara County will
build the bridge!"
"Not at all," countered K. X. Mooer
of San Mateo. "Supervisor Hooley is
perfectly right when he says that
beauty demands another structure, j
But San Mateo must build. Our honor
demands it. The Board of Education
has extra funds galore."
"In the meantime," was the com !
bined sentiment, "there is no great
hurry."
"The bridge is a fine old example of
early 19th century architecture," said
Hooley. "It has stood for fifty years
and, if necessary, will stand another
fifty!"
Reports that heavy Greyline sight
seeing busses were passing over the
bridge several times a week were
pooh-poohed by an unidentified mem
ber of one of the boards.
"What of it?" he said. "We got a
sign up, ain't we?"

for aesthetic reasons. But," Hooley
insisted, "Santa Clara County will
build the bridge!"
"Not at all," countered K. X. Mooer
of San Mateo. "Supervisor Hooley is
perfectly right when he says that
beauty demands another structure, j
But San Mateo must build. Our honor
demands it. The Board of Education
has extra funds galore."
"In the meantime," was the com !
bined sentiment, "there is no great
hurry."
"The bridge is a fine old example of
early 19th century architecture," said
Hooley. "It has stood for fifty years
and, if necessary, will stand another
fifty!"
Reports that heavy Greyline sight
seeing busses were passing over the
bridge several times a week were
pooh-poohed by an unidentified mem
ber of one of the boards.
"What of it?" he said. "We got a
sign up, ain't we?"
