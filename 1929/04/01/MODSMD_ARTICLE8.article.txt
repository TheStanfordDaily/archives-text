# Drs. Mendem and Sticky Complete New Sure-Cure for "Bastille Heart"
## 
### 
Prompt relief for members of Rho '
Omicron Beta Lambda Epsilon suf-!
fering from cordis fracluris roblinium,
sometimes known as "Bastille heart," \
is forthcoming with the announce
ment. made bere this morning by Dr.
Wood Mendem, 8.5., S.A., 8.A.C., that
he bad successfully used a newly in- I
vented glue of unequalled adhesive
ness to mend a broken heart.
Particular credit for the now treat
ment, according to Dr. Mendem,
j should go to I. M. Sticky, research ex
pert of the Amalgamated Adhesive
Tape Co., who produced the remark
able paste, and to the A.5.1T.11. Com
mittee on Doing-Something-to-Reduee
the-High-Mortality-Among-Inmates - of
Roble-Wliose-Roommates-Go - House
and-Leave-Them-Broken-hearted, which
several weeks ago called to the doc
tor's attention the critical state of
affairs existing nmong a considerable
proportion of the "500" and the urgent
need for a remedy.'
Simplicity and efficiency feature this
new treatment as described by Dr.
I Mendem, who is generally recognized

' as California's leading heart special
ist. A hypodermic needle is inserted
into the patient in the region of the
heart, and the glue is pumped into
that organ. Influenced by the com
bined effects of hydrolysis, ionization,
and osmotic pressure normally pres
'ent in the cardiac zone, the glue Hows
into and fills any crack or breaks in
; the heart. So tenaciously effective is
| this new semi-liquid that within a few
j minutes after treatment no traces of
any heart-break may be discerned.
The sad condition of affairs existing
at Roble was first exposed by Norman
"Bull" Sessions, literary scourge of
the Far West, who was later appoint
ed chairman of the Committee on Do
ing-Something - To-Reduce-the-High-
I Mortality-Ainong-lnmates-of - Roble -
Whose-Roommates-go - House - and -
LeaveThem-Broken-liearted. Accord
ing to Sessions, his attention was first,
drawn to the matter when at a Jolly-
Up the rattling of broken hearts com
pletely drowned out the cordial wel
come being extended several "roughs"
J by the Roble chaperones.
