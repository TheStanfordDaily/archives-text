# DIPLOMA CLEANING FLUID DISCOVERED BY UTOPIA GENIUS
## 
### 
Dr. E. C. Franklin, research profes
-1 sor in the department of chemistry at
J Utopia University, today announced
the discovery of a chemical compound
1 possessing phenomenal lubricating
and cleansing qualities. Although the
, formula of the preparation is being
, kept secret pending the issuance of
patents, it is known that gasoline and
{ alcohol are of basic importance in its
j preparation.
I Dr. Franklin plans to call his dis
covery gasohol in honor of Guttar
j Mc√üumm, laboratory assistant, who
, wiscovered the excellent beverage
I qualities of the compound.
In the course of extensive experi-;
mentation, gasohol has been found to
be highly efficacious in the cleaning!
of leather. Particularly successful is
it in removing smudges and black ;
marks from sheepskin, a fact which
will make it of inestimable value at
; Utopia, where a large quantity of this
leather is used annually.
Speaking of the lubricating powers
of the new compound, Dr. Franklin
said that it had been tried on the most
unwieldy mechanism that could be
found in the University, an Honor
Code which was very rusty, and that
following the application of gasohol.
not a creak, or rattle could be heard
when the machine functioned. No
sound could be heard even by a group
lof trained listeners called an Execu
; tive Committee.
