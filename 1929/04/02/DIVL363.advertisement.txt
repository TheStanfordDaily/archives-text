1928 Isaac
Walton Goes
Poetic Now
Bingham, Maine i
Jan. 31, 1928
When you've planned a trip for
fishing,
And you've spent a lot of kale,
Bet, the whole of your vacation
On some advertiser's tale
And you fish a lake of beauty
Hidden in a land of dreams,
Where the air is clean as sunshine
Haunted by songs of crystal streams.
Comes the moment when you're
casting
And a smasher hits your line,
Then you play him like a gamester
With the battle going fine,
Till a snag, a yank, and silence
And the line is hanging slack,
While you grit your teeth and whistle
And reel the fishline back.
Take the pipe and fill with Edgeworth,
Light her up and learn to grin
.Then by gum you are elected
To the Club of Try Agin!
A. R. M., Jr.
