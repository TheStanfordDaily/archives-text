How Do You Use Your Eyes?
Do you use them right or abuse them
shamefully in your daily work. If you
read a great deal of line print you are
apt to strain them unless they are
unusually strong. If you experience
any difficulty, particularly toward the
end of the day, in reading, it is the
warning to come to use for an exami
nation. We can correct any defect of
vision.
