# TRYOUTS START TODAY ON DAILY EDITORIAL STAFF
## Experience Not Required To Secure Regular Positions; Tryoutees Begin Reporting Publication Offers Training In Writing; Metropolitan Paper Conditions Prevail 
### 
Tryouts for the editorial staff of
the Stanford Daily will begin at 2:30
o'clock today in the Daily office, next
to the Press Building. All students,
particularly freshmen and sophomores,
who are interested in newspaper
work, are urged to report at this time.
Tryoutees will have an actual part
in publishing the paper. Work will con
sist of covering campus beats, writing
stories, rewrite work, and proof-read
nig. The dispatch and the ability with
which this is done, along with the
results of special assignments given
rhem, serves as a basis for the final
selection of staff members, which will
take place about the middle of the
present quarter.
Previous experience in journalism,
such as work 011 high school or junior
college publications, is not necessary,
as tryoutees will have an opportunity
to learn the work from the ground up.
In no other department of the Uni
versity will students find that their
work will so nearly parallel that
which they would have to do in the
same field outside of college. The
methods of publishing the Daily are
almost identical with those employed
by city newspapers.
Advancement on the staff is con
trolled by the quality of the work
done, and the interest shown in the
welfare of the paper. The successful
tryoutees becomes a news reporter.
From this position he may be pro
moted to that of copy editor. As such
he assists the night editor, who "puts
out" one paper a week, and to whose
position he may succeed. From the
night editors are chosen the associ
ate editors who have active charge of
managing the paper, and one of whom
is elected editor, whose function is to
direct the editorial policy and to
write the editorials.
Through work on the Daily, students
have an opportunity to learn of the
workings of the University and be
come better acquainted with other
students, various phases of student
activities and the University adminis
tration.
