## Funeral Services Will Begin Thursday With Tribute by French Governing Official Ambassador's Death Places Before President Task of Filling Important Position 
### 
PARIS, April 1. (/P)—France has
taken the death of American Ambas
sador Herrick as her own loss and
will pay his body the same honors
she pays to those of her own distin
guished sons.
The funeral services will begin
Thursday morning at an hour to be
subsequently fixed, it was decided to
day after Mrs. Parmely Herrick had
talked with her husband in New York
by wireless telephone. Ceremonies
are to begin at the embassy, where
Premier Poincare will pay tribute to
Mr. Herrick's memory in the name
of the French government.
Immediately afterward, the cortege
will form at the embassy and proceed
to the American pro-Cathedral in the
Avenue George V with detachments
of French troops rendering honors.
WASHINGTON, April 1. (/P) — The
death of Myron T. Herrick, veteran
American ambassador to Paris, has
placed before President Hoover the
task of making his first major ap
pointment in the United States diplo
matic corps.
Although the Hoover administra
tion has been in power almost a
month, no realignment of the diplo
matic service has been attempted be
cause of the time required for Henry
L. Stimson, the new Secretary of
State, to reach Washington from
Manila, where he was serving as Gov
ernor General of the Philippines.
During the interim the appointees
of the Coolidge regime have remained
in office and the vacancy caused un
expectedly at Paris has added to the
problems of realignments. Mr. Her
rick had been slated to remain in that
post at least temporarily.
While it probably will be some time
before a successor to Mr. Herrick is
selected —certainly until after the
funeral —numerous names have been
mentioned in unofficial circles here
for that office, regarded as one of
the most important in the American
foreign service.
