						Sex Questionnaire! My! My! My!

### 
The little matter of the inflammatory questionnaire at the University
of Missouri which brought about the wrath of the university authorities,
the state authorities, and much, too much nation-wide publicity, brings
forcibly to mind the influence of the outside upon the affairs that tran
spire inside university walls.
The Missouri excitement arose when psychology and sociology pro
fessors tried to probe the inner thoughts of some thousand students on
that greatly current topic, sex. It seems that this is banned as a subject
for scientific investigation, at least among college students. Of course
the race is merely propagated by its function, but then that makes it none
the less a topic to be banned.
No move on a university campus goes unheralded outside its walls.
The university and its devoted sons and daughters have become front
page copy. And when anything so gauche as a university student seri
husly facing a problem, such as his personal reactions to the relation of
the sexes, occurs, the press makes the most of it, and the university
learns if never before that it is the plaything of public opinion.
When some philanthropist leaves a tremendous fortune for the
founding of a university, let it be hoped that he will be far-sighted enough
to make it a university beyond the reach of external tampering. l>ut then
that would be the millennium; the peeping torus can't be kept out*
