# The 						New Golf Course to Pay for Itself
## 
### 
Two hundred fifty playing privileges, after the fashion of ticket
rights to stadium subscribers, are now open to peninsula golfers and
others on the proposed campus golf course.
When $25,000 is accumulated from the sale of two hundred of the
year playing privileges, the new course will be begun. Ihe plan of
financing the links is feasible if there are two hundred golf enthusiasts
to he found hereabouts, otherwise it stands on shaky ground. Late re
port places the number of subscribers to date at eighteen.
With the course paying for itself in this manner no objection can be
raised by other groups who would raise loud objection were it financed
otherwise, which, let it be added, is fine.
The new financing plan, offers a democratic angle to the project in
that it allows others besides students and faculty members the oppor
tunity to use the course. It is commendable that the campus with its
many excellent advantages should share some of these with outsiders.
