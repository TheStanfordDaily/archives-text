# Another Tradition Collapses

Just as the last student was about to flunk his last final of the past
quarter, the ancient and long condemned bridge back of Lagunita crashed
into unsuspecting San Francisquito Creek and left a bus, full of fright
ened passengers, hanging on the bank's edge above the wreckage.
For forty-one years the antique bridge creaked and groaned to the
perennial Searsville trek of the student body. For any given number of
the forty-one it was condemned, but that meant nothing to the county
supervisors of San Mateo and Santa Clara respectively, hortunately
when the bridge gave up its dying groan and its ghost, no one was seri
ously hurt.
Now that it is down, it can be expected that the wide awake county
supervisors will get "off the dime" as it were, and on to the bridge
building. But then perhaps that is too much to expect. Mayhap it will
be another forty-one years before anything is done besides the posting
of warnings.
