# More Track Laurels
## 
### 
While the student body was lolling back in the luxuriance of a week's
spring vacation, the track team was taking the pride of Washington down
the line to the score of 73 to 58. Harlow Rothert and Eric Krenz and
11oward Edmonds did themselves proud. There were new records, world
records. It was a real meet and on an inside track.
Stanford's long series of track victories has accustomed the student
body to such front page news as the breaking of world records. Instead
of wild and unbounded enthusiasm, the campus scarce takes the time to
read of the achievements. But then with Dink Templeton, California
sunshine (that's the easterner's alibi), and the unbroken string of star
athletes, victories are almost to be taken for granted.
