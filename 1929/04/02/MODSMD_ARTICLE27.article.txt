# The 						Call for New Blood
## 
### 
The Daily opens its spring tryouts today for new staff members, i
1 fere is a year-round activity and an opportunity to gain the fundamentals ;
of a fast expanding profession that should appeal to a goodly number of ,
students. (Advt.)
Advancement on the Daily is fast. The system used for promotion
is based on the work of the individual. If he does it consistently and
well, advancement is guaranteed. His rise follows from tryoutee to
reporter, from reporter to copy editor, from copy editor to night editor,)
thence to associate editor and editor.
Financial remuneration is small and is limited to the members of the
editorial board entirely. However the return in experience, in the wide!
range of contacts with all phases of the University, and in friendships
cannot be overlooked as ample return for the time and energy invested, i
Some one of the wide-eyed tryoutees to enter the door this afternoon
will be the editor tomorrow, lint then the editor would be a bit senti
mental about it.
The first staff meeting of the quarter will be held today at 1:15 p.m.
