# The 						Bullsession
## VIRTUE BY THE CLOCK 
### 
There seems to ue no reason \vh" j
lockouts and other foolibh restrictions j
should continue to be inflicted uvon j
Stanford women.
One purpose of a college education,
as we see it, is to develop in the in-!
dividual a capacity for thinking tor
himself and for taking care of him
self. Stanford women have little
chance to acquire this capacity.
It is absurd to assume that women
near the age of twenty are mentally j
and morally incapable of controlling
themselves in every way except, per
haps, financially. It is absurd to sup- i
pose that they are less mature than
men of similar age, and yet the Stan- j
l'ord system would seem to be based
upon that supposition.
Stanford men suffer no restrictions
whatsoever, and the great majority i
demonstrate that they can keep their 1
heads with such independence.
We predict that, freed of restric- j
tions, Stanford women would thrive j
quite as well as they now do under
the method of being huddled into their
cells at stated hours because the sun
has set.
And banishment of the lockout sys
tem would end a lot of the suspicion,
jealousy, and cattisliness which ac-,
company this medieval practice.
The fact that Stanford women sub-;
mit with little protest to the lockout ;
system could very well be interpreted
as an admission of moral weakness
on their part.
Possibly some Stanford women
even defend the lockout system. One
reason might well be this: that, being

constantly watched and guarded like
so many gems, they are able to place
a false estimate upon the value of
their persons; an estimate not justi
fied by the immediate facts or by
God's original intention.
Anyhow, as somebody once pointed
out, it gets dark long before 10:30,
11:30, or 1:30, as the case may be. |
Too many parents send their daugh
ters to. Stanford because they know
that here they will be guarded with
the same sort of cruel kindness which
they have suffered from governesses
and boarding-school gaolers through
out their lives up to this time.
The result is that many women
graduate from Stanford, at the age
of twenty-two or so, with very little
idea of what it is all about. Morality
hasn't been inbred in them —it has
been wrapped around them.
It seems reasonable to suppose that i
women who come to Stanford and are \
incapable of taking care of themselves j
are not the kind wanted here. That'
is the way with the men, anyhow—if
they can't enjoy independence with
out mistreating it, they are sent home.
Maybe, when the millenium arrives, j
parents will realize that after their
children have attained the age of fif
teen, all hell, high water, police, lock- i
outs, and beatings won't keep them
straight if they intend to go wrong.}
Stanford might well assist parents
to such realization by eliminating the
medieval lockout practice, thus ex- j
pressing tacitly the desire for women
students capable of being keepers of j
their own souls.

We predict that, freed of restric- j
tions, Stanford women would thrive j
quite as well as they now do under
the method of being huddled into their
cells at stated hours because the sun
has set.

jealousy, and cattisliness which ac-,
company this medieval practice.
The fact that Stanford women sub-;
mit with little protest to the lockout ;
system could very well be interpreted
as an admission of moral weakness
on their part.
Possibly some Stanford women
even defend the lockout system. One
reason might well be this: that, being

constantly watched and guarded like
so many gems, they are able to place
a false estimate upon the value of
their persons; an estimate not justi
fied by the immediate facts or by
God's original intention.
Anyhow, as somebody once pointed
out, it gets dark long before 10:30,
11:30, or 1:30, as the case may be. |
Too many parents send their daugh
ters to. Stanford because they know
that here they will be guarded with
the same sort of cruel kindness which
they have suffered from governesses
and boarding-school gaolers through
out their lives up to this time.
The result is that many women
graduate from Stanford, at the age
of twenty-two or so, with very little
idea of what it is all about. Morality
hasn't been inbred in them —it has
been wrapped around them.
It seems reasonable to suppose that i
women who come to Stanford and are \
incapable of taking care of themselves j
are not the kind wanted here. That'
is the way with the men, anyhow—if
they can't enjoy independence with
out mistreating it, they are sent home.
Maybe, when the millenium arrives, j
parents will realize that after their
children have attained the age of fif
teen, all hell, high water, police, lock- i
outs, and beatings won't keep them
straight if they intend to go wrong.}
Stanford might well assist parents
to such realization by eliminating the
medieval lockout practice, thus ex- j
pressing tacitly the desire for women
students capable of being keepers of j
their own souls.

There seems to ue no reason \vh" j
lockouts and other foolibh restrictions j
should continue to be inflicted uvon j
Stanford women.
One purpose of a college education,
as we see it, is to develop in the in-!
dividual a capacity for thinking tor
himself and for taking care of him
self. Stanford women have little
chance to acquire this capacity.
It is absurd to assume that women
near the age of twenty are mentally j
and morally incapable of controlling
themselves in every way except, per
haps, financially. It is absurd to sup- i
pose that they are less mature than
men of similar age, and yet the Stan- j
l'ord system would seem to be based
upon that supposition.
Stanford men suffer no restrictions
whatsoever, and the great majority i
demonstrate that they can keep their 1
heads with such independence.
