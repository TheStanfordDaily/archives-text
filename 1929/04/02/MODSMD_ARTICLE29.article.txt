Milly's husband ,Ernest, died —and |
left a will, as men will! After Ernest ,
Bott died, dying not as it had been ;
the habit of the Botts to die, that is,
"on achieving ripeness and not be- j
fore," but dying before his ripeness j
for demise had come, being "cut off j
in a street accident" as he was —after
Ernest died and before the will was j
read, all the Botts —there were many j
of them —came to Milly's splendid
house to do what they could for Milly, j
poor dear. They were important peo- j
pie, people much respected in the ;
south London suburb, Titford. And |
they came, these important and re- ;
spectable Botts, to shed a tear or two '>
or three or more over dear little '
Milly. Thus many tears were shed, j
teai's important and respectable—were j
shed over Milly, and not without rea- j
son were these many tears shed, so j
all the many Botts thought. For was j
not Milly a paragon? As a wife every
Bott brother might have wished —;
and one or two of them had actually :
wished it, respectable thought, ofj
course, they were, being Botts —might
have wished Milly was HIS wife, not J
Ernest's. Milly was without doubt the
best of all the good wives, the several
Bott brothers had managed to marry, j
Milly was a paragon. Aside from the !
dolorous fact that brother Ernest had ,
passed on prematurely, which fact j
was, of course, wholly sad —aside from
that, the Botts, including the Bott
brothers' wives as well as the Bott
brothers, were quite pleased to shed j
tears over one so worthy of having j
tears shed over her as Milly was.
Then the will was read. Consterna
tion came into every Bott face. Milly
must have done wrong. She must have
sinned. After all she must have been
a bad wife, the worst instead of the
best of the Bott wives.
For Ernest had left most of his for
tune to a charity ,aiul SUCH a charity
—had given the bulk of his wealth to
be used for a home for "fallen wo
men." Milly was left but a pittance,
and Ernest said in the will, Milly
would know why. And Milly DID know

j why. But the Botts did not know —
I and not knowing, they guessed much
| too much. The consternation that
| came into every respectable Bott face
j at the time of the reading of the will
; increased with the passing of time. I
Then Milly explained. Then too her'
j expiation was consummated, her days ;
j of atonement were ended.
! She whose pseudonym is "Eliza- 1
beth" has drawn one character super
latively well in this, her novel, "Ex
-1 piation." Reading of Milly's actions
and more often of Milly's thoughts, j
;we comprehend Milly with profound
I sympathy. Reminiscent of Wells is j
' this able character portrayal of "Eli-'.a ;
1 beth's." In "Meanwhile" Wells drew
j with great skill the characater por
: trait of his heroine, an Englishwoman '
' like Milly, but one not environed in
j the purlieus of London as was this j
I Milly, created by "Elizabeth."
1 Let us know Milly a little better.
1 Read her silent soliloquy:
. She felt so good and peace- j
! fui. Was she really wicked? Of course
she was. The Botts knew all about it
by this time. It was their knowing;
j that made her wicked; it was Ernest's!
having found out. If nobody had ever I
| known . . .
Here we have a glimpse of one of i
| the women Milly lived with. The wife ;
| of one of the Bott brothers fears for
! the fate the mother of all the Bott j
I brothers may meet:
" 'You don't think anything matters
j very much, do you, mother? .... it
\ had seemed to her tragic that anyone
;so old, so inevitably near eternity,
j as her mother-in-law, should still ap
! parently not have made up her mind
j on the great simple questions of right
I and wrong, good and evil . . . ."

Milly's husband ,Ernest, died —and |
left a will, as men will! After Ernest ,
Bott died, dying not as it had been ;
the habit of the Botts to die, that is,
"on achieving ripeness and not be- j
fore," but dying before his ripeness j
for demise had come, being "cut off j
in a street accident" as he was —after
Ernest died and before the will was j
read, all the Botts —there were many j
of them —came to Milly's splendid
house to do what they could for Milly, j
poor dear. They were important peo- j
pie, people much respected in the ;
south London suburb, Titford. And |
they came, these important and re- ;
spectable Botts, to shed a tear or two '>
or three or more over dear little '
Milly. Thus many tears were shed, j
teai's important and respectable—were j
shed over Milly, and not without rea- j
son were these many tears shed, so j
all the many Botts thought. For was j
not Milly a paragon? As a wife every
Bott brother might have wished —;
and one or two of them had actually :
wished it, respectable thought, ofj
course, they were, being Botts —might
have wished Milly was HIS wife, not J
Ernest's. Milly was without doubt the
best of all the good wives, the several
Bott brothers had managed to marry, j
Milly was a paragon. Aside from the !
dolorous fact that brother Ernest had ,
passed on prematurely, which fact j
was, of course, wholly sad —aside from
that, the Botts, including the Bott
brothers' wives as well as the Bott
brothers, were quite pleased to shed j
tears over one so worthy of having j
tears shed over her as Milly was.
Then the will was read. Consterna
tion came into every Bott face. Milly
must have done wrong. She must have
sinned. After all she must have been
a bad wife, the worst instead of the
best of the Bott wives.
For Ernest had left most of his for
tune to a charity ,aiul SUCH a charity
—had given the bulk of his wealth to
be used for a home for "fallen wo
men." Milly was left but a pittance,
and Ernest said in the will, Milly
would know why. And Milly DID know

j why. But the Botts did not know —
I and not knowing, they guessed much
| too much. The consternation that
| came into every respectable Bott face
j at the time of the reading of the will
; increased with the passing of time. I
Then Milly explained. Then too her'
j expiation was consummated, her days ;
j of atonement were ended.
! She whose pseudonym is "Eliza- 1
beth" has drawn one character super
latively well in this, her novel, "Ex
-1 piation." Reading of Milly's actions
and more often of Milly's thoughts, j
;we comprehend Milly with profound
I sympathy. Reminiscent of Wells is j
' this able character portrayal of "Eli-'.a ;
1 beth's." In "Meanwhile" Wells drew
j with great skill the characater por
: trait of his heroine, an Englishwoman '
' like Milly, but one not environed in
j the purlieus of London as was this j
I Milly, created by "Elizabeth."
1 Let us know Milly a little better.
1 Read her silent soliloquy:
. She felt so good and peace- j
! fui. Was she really wicked? Of course
she was. The Botts knew all about it
by this time. It was their knowing;
j that made her wicked; it was Ernest's!
having found out. If nobody had ever I
| known . . .
Here we have a glimpse of one of i
| the women Milly lived with. The wife ;
| of one of the Bott brothers fears for
! the fate the mother of all the Bott j
I brothers may meet:
" 'You don't think anything matters
j very much, do you, mother? .... it
\ had seemed to her tragic that anyone
;so old, so inevitably near eternity,
j as her mother-in-law, should still ap

Milly's husband ,Ernest, died —and |
left a will, as men will! After Ernest ,
Bott died, dying not as it had been ;
the habit of the Botts to die, that is,
"on achieving ripeness and not be- j
fore," but dying before his ripeness j
for demise had come, being "cut off j
in a street accident" as he was —after
Ernest died and before the will was j
read, all the Botts —there were many j
of them —came to Milly's splendid
house to do what they could for Milly, j
poor dear. They were important peo- j
pie, people much respected in the ;
south London suburb, Titford. And |
they came, these important and re- ;
spectable Botts, to shed a tear or two '>
or three or more over dear little '
Milly. Thus many tears were shed, j
teai's important and respectable—were j
shed over Milly, and not without rea- j
son were these many tears shed, so j
all the many Botts thought. For was j
not Milly a paragon? As a wife every
Bott brother might have wished —;
and one or two of them had actually :
wished it, respectable thought, ofj
course, they were, being Botts —might
have wished Milly was HIS wife, not J
Ernest's. Milly was without doubt the
best of all the good wives, the several
Bott brothers had managed to marry, j
Milly was a paragon. Aside from the !
dolorous fact that brother Ernest had ,
passed on prematurely, which fact j
was, of course, wholly sad —aside from
that, the Botts, including the Bott
brothers' wives as well as the Bott
brothers, were quite pleased to shed j
tears over one so worthy of having j
tears shed over her as Milly was.
Then the will was read. Consterna
tion came into every Bott face. Milly
must have done wrong. She must have
sinned. After all she must have been
a bad wife, the worst instead of the
best of the Bott wives.
For Ernest had left most of his for
tune to a charity ,aiul SUCH a charity
—had given the bulk of his wealth to
be used for a home for "fallen wo
men." Milly was left but a pittance,
and Ernest said in the will, Milly
would know why. And Milly DID know

j why. But the Botts did not know —
I and not knowing, they guessed much
| too much. The consternation that
| came into every respectable Bott face
j at the time of the reading of the will
; increased with the passing of time. I
Then Milly explained. Then too her'
j expiation was consummated, her days ;
j of atonement were ended.
! She whose pseudonym is "Eliza- 1
beth" has drawn one character super
latively well in this, her novel, "Ex
-1 piation." Reading of Milly's actions
and more often of Milly's thoughts, j
;we comprehend Milly with profound
I sympathy. Reminiscent of Wells is j
' this able character portrayal of "Eli-'.a ;
1 beth's." In "Meanwhile" Wells drew
j with great skill the characater por
: trait of his heroine, an Englishwoman '
' like Milly, but one not environed in
j the purlieus of London as was this j
I Milly, created by "Elizabeth."
1 Let us know Milly a little better.
1 Read her silent soliloquy:
. She felt so good and peace- j
! fui. Was she really wicked? Of course
she was. The Botts knew all about it
by this time. It was their knowing;
j that made her wicked; it was Ernest's!
having found out. If nobody had ever I
| known . . .
Here we have a glimpse of one of i
| the women Milly lived with. The wife ;
| of one of the Bott brothers fears for
! the fate the mother of all the Bott j
I brothers may meet:
" 'You don't think anything matters
j very much, do you, mother? .... it
\ had seemed to her tragic that anyone
;so old, so inevitably near eternity,
