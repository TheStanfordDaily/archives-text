The Editor, Sir:
II all the automobiles in the coun
try are laid end to end, you may know
that it is Sunday afternoon; and,
likewise, if all the students in Encina
Hall were laid end to end, it would
he very safe to guess (he time as
seme time after two o'clock in the
morning. At any earlier hour there
would be a goodly percentage of them
up studying. And, to carry our line of
reasoning a bit farther, you may rest
assured that, were all the people re
sponsible for the condition and up- j
keep of aforementioned hall required
to pay in cash or other legal tender
for all the eyestrain suffered by the
inhabitants thereof, there would be an
immediate influx of electricians to our
fair campus, and the wholesale houses
of the nation would fall over each
other in their efforts to get the order
tor the lighting equipment necessary
to provide the proper illumination for
extended study in each room of the
hall.
Having delivered myself of that
rather involved sentence, 1 will get
to the point. Each room in Encina is
supplied with one outlet in the center
of the room, and each outlet has two
drop-cords, with two unshaded 40-
watt globes. That is grossly inade
quate; I am sure that it is supposed
to be, and that each student is sup
posed to supply whatever supple
mentary extensions, study lamps, and
shades he deems necessary. But the
truth is that the average student,
however good judgment he may have,
is not capable of providing an effi
cient illuminating system for night
study. Of all the desk lamps in this
hull —there must be two to every
room —I doubt if there are a dozen
that are used in such a way as to
provide the proper illumination for,
extended study.
If proper illumination is necessary !
in the classrooms, where one listens '
to lectures, how much more so in the
dormitory where we —some of us, at
least —spend two to four hours a day
reading or working by lamplight! It
would repay Stanford, in eyestrain
saved her students, and in decreased
power-consumption, to install in each
room two scientifically designed dif
fusing units: one to give a uniform,
soft light, over the whole room, and
one over the common study table, to
provide the necessary 12- to 15-foot
candles for close work. I fully realize
that this would cost money; but I
contend that it is of immense and im-,
mediate importance. And 1 must in- 1
sist that the fact that the condition
has prevailed for Lo! these many
years, is no excuse for its continuance. |
