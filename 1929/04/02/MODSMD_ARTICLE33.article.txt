# TRACK AND FIELD MEN TRAIN FOR DUAL MEET WITH U.S.C. SATURDAY
## 
### 
Coach Dink Templeton's track and
field men, having disposed of the Uni
versity of Washington Huskies in a
satisfactory fashion last Thursday at
Seattle, 73 to 58, and set two new
world's records in so doing, will spend
itie next few days in preparation for
their stiffest dual meet of the season,
that with the University of Southern
California in the Stanford Stadium
Saturday.
Harlow "Foot-a-week" Rothert and
Eric Krenz provided northern spec
tators with all the thrills they might
desire in the way of weight-throwing.
Rothert heaved the shot 51 ft. 5-8 in.
to set a new world's indoor record.
His teammate, Krenz, with a mighty
put of 50 ft. 1 in. was only able to
take second place. Krenz, throwing
the discus for the first time indoors,
set a world indoor mark with a toss
of 153 ft. 11 3-4 in., almost ten feet
short of his best outdoor effort.
Two days after the impressive Car
dinal victory over the strong Wash
ington team, the Trojan trackmen
demonstrated their power by over
whelming the University of California
9G to 35.
Stanford's supremacy in the field
events is undisputed, but whether or
not this will be enough to overcome
the lead which U.S.C. will pile up on
the track is questionable. Most ad
vance dope sheets favor the Cards to
win 68 to 58, not counting the relay.
The fourteen first places will prob
ably be divided evenly between the
two teams, and it will be the seconds
and thirds which will decide the meet.
Stanford is doped to score 39 points to
IJ.S.C.'s 15 in the six field events and
29 points to the visitors' 43 in the
eight track events.
Stanford defeated the Trojans 77
to 54 at Los Angeles last year.
