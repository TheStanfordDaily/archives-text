# FIRST REGISTRATION FIGURES SHOW GAIN OVER LAST SPRING
## 
### 
Enrollment in the University last
evening, at the close of the first day
of registration for the quarter ex
ceeded that of the first day of the
spring quarter a year ago by 111, the
total yesterday being 2993 as com
pared with 2882 on the first day last
year. As usual, there is a slight de
crease in attendance in comparison
with the winter quarter, caused by
the fact that no new Lower Division
men are admitted in the spring to
offset the vacancies caused by gradu
ation or withdrawals for other causes,
so that all increases must come from
the registration of Upper Division and
graduate students. There are about
40 fewer students in the University
than there were at the end of the first
day's registration last quarter.
