STANFO R1) UNIVERSITY,
April I.—Pete Jenks, 555 Encina
! Hall, sustained minor injuries
here this morning when he tripped
over a large strand of red tapo
which had been dropped by an
employee. Jenks was removed to
the Palo Alto Hospital and his
registration accomplished b."

J but not serious.
I
We understand the moguls of the
' Daily Californian damned with faint
praise, to say the least, this column's
i reprint of fashion facts, foibles, and
fancies as revealed on the Berkeley
! campus by the Californian.
i Nevertheless, we will never foroet
their "Men Will Be Alluring in Riot
of Varied Colors."
j We are almost tempted to reprint
j that rhapsody on gentlemen's Uniler
l wear.
I
Students are warned not to drive
too rapidly out behind the campus as
one of the county's pet projects has
fallen through.
I
The problem, even more than ever
j before, is between Santa Clara and
; San Mateo.
Those who said that there wasn't
■ enough waste wood for the bonfire
| reckoned without our local philanthro
pists. No sooner did the two county
tcards of supervisors realize the
shortage than poof! a whole lot of
swell fuel was broken up. The Grey-
I line Company also deserves special
j thanks for its helpful attitude in the
matter.
