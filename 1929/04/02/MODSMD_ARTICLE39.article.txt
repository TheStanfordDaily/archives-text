# SPORTS OF 1929
## Let George Do It! 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Long George Kelly has always been
an interesting ball player to me â€”pos
sibly because he is so tali that he is
cursed with the nickname of "High- j
pockets" (a cognomen I also wore
while in the Army); possibly because
he was born in San Francisco (an
honor I share with him); or possibly j
because he is a remarkably versatile ;
diamond athlete who can fill in at
practically any position (no resem
blance between us here!).
The trade that sent Kelly to the
Reds, who already had a good first
baseman in Wally Pipp, was always
a mystery to me, but McGraw had ;
Terry and needed Roush, so the thing j

I went through. Once in a Rhineland
uniform, Long George kept up his
good work and, although used in only
I sixty-one games in 1927, played the
outfield and first and second as he did
for the Giants in 1925. He batted only
' .270, however, but brought this mark
up to .297 last season, when he was
j given a chance in 116 contests.
Somehow 1 look for the elongated
; Coast boy to have a good year in 1929.
I With Wally Pipp in the minors, Kelly
can devote his time entirely to first,
a position at which he used to be one
of the game's greatest. In fact, Long
I George was so good a first baseman
j around 1924 that many a stove league

argument centered on the question of
which George (Kelly or Sisler) was
the greater.
In the world series of 1921, '22, '23,
and '24 Kelly more than held his own,
although he never hatted at his best
in a post-season classic. I remember
vividly his remarkable stop and throw
on Ruth in the first game of the 1923
series. He rifled that ball home as no
other player could have done, in time
to catch Joe Dugan by many feet.
