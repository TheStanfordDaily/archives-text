Doctor Ellen Gleditsch, a distin
guished visitor from the University
of Oslo, Norway, will speak before
the University women at a special
women's assembly to be held in the
Women's Clubhouse at four-thirty this
afternoon. Doctor Gleditsch, who is
president of the International Federa
tion of University Women, is a lec
turer, and a scientist of the first rank
in the field of physical chemistry. Her
specialty is radioactivity.
As early in her career as 1907 the
unusual character" of her scientific
ability was recognized, and she re
ceived a grant which permitted her
to go to Paris and work in the labora
tory of Madame Curie, the center of
all work on radium and radium ac
tivity. After five years in Paris she
returned with a degree from the Sor-i
bonne, to teach at the University of
Oslo. Two years later she received
another grant which brought her to
America to work at Yale University.
Immediately after the assembly a
tea for Doctor Gleditsch will be held
at Dean Yost's home. All senior and
graduate women have received invita
tions to attend. Tonight President and
Mrs. Swain are giving a dinner in her
honor for the members of the chem
istry department.
