# CHANGE IN PHILOSOPHY DEPARTMENT COURSES RECENTLY ANNOUNCED
## 
### 
The philosophy department has an
nounced several changes from its pro
gram as listed in the Announcement
of Courses.
A new course, Philosophy 10, en
titled Major Traditions of European
Philosophy, is being offered hy Pro
lessor Itoelofs, for students desiring
a general acquaintance with the main
aspects of the history of philosophy,
but not wishing to spend the year
necessary to courses 100, 101, and 102.
This course gives more attention to
the dominant points of view in philo
sophy rather than to the detailed
treatment of individual men as taken
up in the three-quarter History of
Philosophy. Major Traditions is open
to all students of at least sophomore
standing, and those who have taken
it will be allowed to take any one of
the courses numbered 100, 101, and
102.
The department has also announced
that Philosophy 2, Ethics, will be
given again this spring. Mr. Gentry
is giving it this time and it is not a
repetition of Professor Stuart's
course by the same name. Gentry's
course, however, satisfies the same
requirements as Stuart's. Another
course not in the Announcement of
Courses is Philosophy 205, Philoso
phical leads in Contemporary Science.
This will be given by Mr. Gentry and
is open to all Upper Division students.
Mysticism, Philosophy 112, will be
given as a seminar this spring, and
students wishing to take it should
see Professor lloelofs as the enroll
ment is limited.
