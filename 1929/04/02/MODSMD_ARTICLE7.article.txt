subject to the approval of the Rally
Committee. Votes and nominations
may be made to the Rally Committee
representative who will be stationed
in a booth in front of the Library from

in full charge of the coronation cere
monies. Tickets for the ball go on
sale today at the Old Union. The

portunity to obtain some sort of para
phernalia.
