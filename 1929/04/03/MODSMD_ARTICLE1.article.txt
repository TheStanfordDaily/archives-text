# MEXICAN REBEL AIRPLANES BOMB AMERICAN TOWN
## Blasts Injure One American; Retaliatory Raid Made by Planes of Federal Army May Station Army Air Corps Units at Intervals Along Border to Guard Towns

WASHINGTON, April 2. (/P) —'The
first invasion of American territory
by foreign aircraft in the form of the
dropping of bombs on the town of
Naco, Arizona, presented to American
irovernment officials today a new
problem in connection with the Mexi
can revolution.
To prevent a repetition of such an
incident it was believed here that
units of the army air corps might be
stationed at points along the border
to patrol the air and keep rebel air
craft from flying over American ter
ritory. A sharp warning to the leaders
of the rebel forces from American
military commanders watching the
border is expected.
NACO, Arizona, April 2. (/P)— Mexi
can federal reprisal today followed
the bombing by a rebel airplane of
the American and Mexican towns of
Naco. Four hours after rebel aerial
bombs had fallen on both sides of the
international line, injuring one Ameri
can citizen, two federal airplanes sent
from Sonoyta, Sonora, by federal Gen
oral Abelardo Rodriguez dropped
bombs on General Fausto Topete's
rebel forces three miles in front of
the Naco federal trenches.
Three United States army 50-pound
aircraft bombs were dropped by the
federal aviators. The bombs, pur
chased from the United States army
surplus stock, were passed through
customs here shortly before the bomb
ing incident. The aviators who drop
ped them said they were much more
effective than the rebel bombs.
