## 
### 
"The students in the European uni
versities are older than those in the
colleges here in America," declaimed
Dr. Ellen Gleditsch in an interveiw
yesterday. "This must he home in
mind when comparing them. In the
European universities the students
are upperclassmen or graduates. Con
sequently, the work is more advanced,
so greater progress may be made in
research than is possible among the
youthful students here. Keeping in
mind this factor, however, the inter
est in research lines is almost as keen
in America as in Europe."
In speaking of the part taken by
American women, Dr. Gleditsch con
sidered that though there are many
fine women in research work, they are
handicapped by spending a large part
of their time teaching in the colleges
and less time in doing actual experi
menting in their own field.
Dr. Gleditsch has spent a great deal
of time visiting American universi
ties and, for several years she worked
In Yale University. She is now plan
ning to visit the west coast colleges
before going to New Orleans to at
tend the biennial meeting of the
American Branch of International
Federation of University Women, of
which she is president.
