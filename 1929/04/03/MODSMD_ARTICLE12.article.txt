# COAST TITLE AT STAKE IN U.S.C. STANFORD MEET
## Eric Krenz in Hospital With Cold; Will Be in Shape For Saturday Meet 
### Frank Whiteley 
The two most powerful track and
field teams on the Pacific Coast, and
probably in the United States, will be
seen in action Saturday when Stan
ford and the University of Southern
California meet in the Stadium to de
cide the Conference championship.
Washington's hopes of a Pacific
Coast championship were shattered
last week at Seattle when the Cards
romped through to a 73 to 58 victory,
and California's bid for track honors
received a rude jolt when U.S.C.
trounced the Bears 96 to 35 last Sat
urday. This leaves only Stanford and
U.S.C. undefeated of the "big four."
In the field the shot, discus, and
javelin will be the three big Stanford
events, and it is likely that Coach
Dink Templeton's men will score
clean sweeps in all three. There will
bo plenty of competition in the shot;
but it will be between two Cards, Har
low Rothert, world's indoor champion,
and Eric Krenz. Schleimer of U.S.C.
has done 46 feet several times this
season, but if A1 Forster is in form
this will not be good enough to break
into the Card scoring column.
Krenz Slightly 111
Eric Krenz, who has thrown the
discus five feet farther than any other
man has ever hurled it, is a certainty
to take a first in this event if he is
able to compete. He entered the Palo
Alto Hospital yesterday afternoon,
suffering from a bad cold, but accord
ing to Dr. H. L. Nieb&l, attending phy
sician, will probably be in shape for
Saturday's meet. Norman McLeod, a
sophomore, and Ray Tandy have both
been doing around 140 feet and should
lake second and third. Kline, U.S.C.'s
best discus man, may be able to place
third.
Templeton has three fine college
javelin men in Kibby, Sparling, and
Perelli-Minetti, each of whom has
tossed the spear 190 feet or better
during the last few weeks. Mortenson
of the Trojans has done 189 feet.
The pole vault should provide an
interesting duel with Ward Edmonds
of Stanford and Jack Williams of
U S.C., two of the greatest vaulters
in the country, competing for first.
Edmonds, notwithstanding the fact
that he ran in both hurdles races as
well, had little difficulty in vaulting
13 ft. 6 in. at Seattle, going over the
bar at this height on his second at
tempt. Williams is consistent at this
height, and both he and Edmonds are
potential record-breakers. Hubbard,
U.S.C., and Berry and Hulsman, Stan
ford, will fight it out for third place
