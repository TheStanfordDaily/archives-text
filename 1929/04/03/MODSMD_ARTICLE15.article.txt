# Campus Savant Seeks Fundamental Reaction For Prevention Of Disease

### Milton Silverman 
(Editor's Note.—This is the first of
a series of interviews with members of
the faculty and research students on the
tt'ork they are doing at Stanford. Dr.
Jungeblut, gradfuatc of a number of Ger
man institutions t is assistant professor of
bacteriology. He came to Stanford in
1927.) .

Will science ever learn how to safe
guard the human race from the thousands
of disease-producing bacteria that lurk
in its food, its water, even its very air?
In a small work-scarred laboratory in
the Stanford bacteriology building, Dr.
Claus Jungeblut is delving into the de
fense system of the human body with the
intention of approaching this ideal, goal
of generations of researchers in the
realms of medicine.
Nut human beings, but rabbits, guinea
pigs, test tubes containing frothy liquids,
resembling the chemical make-up of man's
body, are being used in Dr. Jungeblut's
attempt to reveal the mechanism of im
munity.
It is a long, tedious process, this study
of the defense system. Months must pass
before the result of one single experi
ment can be known. Yet he has spent
years at this task, with the prospect of
spending the remaining years of his life
in his search.
"For example, take these antibodies—
the mysterious defensive forces of the

body that can destroy harmful bacteria
and their poisons. How do they work?
—where do they come from?—how can
we aid their production? These are diffi
cult questions ,and yet they must be an
swered if we must know how to make
people immune from contagious diseases.
"We think the antibodies come pri
marily from the bone-marrow and the
spleen, because they seem to accumulate
i there. But that is no proof. If we should
destroy these cells in the spleen, and find
that no antibodies are being produced, !
I that would be more conclusive."
But how was Dr. Jungeblut to remove ■
i a few certain cells from a living crea
j ture? X-rays and certain chemicals could i
! be used. They would destroy the cells, it j
is true, but they would likewise turn the 1
animal into a living corpse.
Then a grotesque device was summoned
back from the days of Paul Ehrlich.
Block the antibody-producing cells of the
liver and spleen! Fill them with ink, with
red dyes, with blue dyes, with anything,
that they would not be killed, but just
temporarily put out of action.
So into the veins of a guinea pig went
an injection of a metal colloid, which
worked just like a dye, and Dr. Jungeblut
waited for weeks. Out came the blood of
the unwilling martyr, tests were made
for antimicrobic activity, and—"We find
that the blocked cells have produced less
antibody; hence we have found one
source—the spleen."
Now to pry into the mechanism.
If a great deal of some such dye as
Congo Kcd, or a colloid like the familiar
Waterproof India Ink were shot into the
body cells, the antibody-producing cells
would be jammed so full of dyestuff or
ink that they would be unable to turn out
any supply of antibody. And, likewise, if
the antibody content of the body was low,
the bacteria invading the body were given
better odds to stay around and get in their
deadly work. Here came the second
step. "It the antibody-producing cells are
incapacitated, the immunity of the ani
mal is decreased."
In what other ways can these cells be
put out of action? By filling them too
lull with anything that doesn't belong
there. Too much alcohol, too much sugar,
too much bacteria. Too much bacteria?
Then that means if a man barely resist
ing influenza should get some tuberculosis
germs in him, he wouldn't have a chance
to battle both of them.
"But what would happen if you ad
ministered just a very small amount of
the blocking agent, just enough to irri
tate the cell, but not enough to fill it?"
he was asked.
"Then the cell, acting under the bother
some irritant, throws (nit more antibodies.
The more antibody produced, the better
the bacteria can be devoured, and the
higher the immunity of the body. What
we look for now is that irritant."
"Do you think you can find it
"Possibly."

I that would be more conclusive."
But how was Dr. Jungeblut to remove ■
i a few certain cells from a living crea
j ture? X-rays and certain chemicals could i
! be used. They would destroy the cells, it j
is true, but they would likewise turn the 1
animal into a living corpse.
Then a grotesque device was summoned
back from the days of Paul Ehrlich.
Block the antibody-producing cells of the
liver and spleen! Fill them with ink, with
red dyes, with blue dyes, with anything,
that they would not be killed, but just
temporarily put out of action.
So into the veins of a guinea pig went
an injection of a metal colloid, which
worked just like a dye, and Dr. Jungeblut
waited for weeks. Out came the blood of
the unwilling martyr, tests were made
for antimicrobic activity, and—"We find
that the blocked cells have produced less
antibody; hence we have found one
source—the spleen."
Now to pry into the mechanism.
If a great deal of some such dye as
Congo Kcd, or a colloid like the familiar
Waterproof India Ink were shot into the
body cells, the antibody-producing cells
would be jammed so full of dyestuff or
ink that they would be unable to turn out
any supply of antibody. And, likewise, if
the antibody content of the body was low,
the bacteria invading the body were given
better odds to stay around and get in their
deadly work. Here came the second
step. "It the antibody-producing cells are
incapacitated, the immunity of the ani
mal is decreased."
In what other ways can these cells be
put out of action? By filling them too
lull with anything that doesn't belong
there. Too much alcohol, too much sugar,
too much bacteria. Too much bacteria?
Then that means if a man barely resist
ing influenza should get some tuberculosis
germs in him, he wouldn't have a chance
to battle both of them.
"But what would happen if you ad
ministered just a very small amount of
the blocking agent, just enough to irri
tate the cell, but not enough to fill it?"
he was asked.
"Then the cell, acting under the bother
some irritant, throws (nit more antibodies.
The more antibody produced, the better
the bacteria can be devoured, and the
higher the immunity of the body. What
we look for now is that irritant."
"Do you think you can find it
"Possibly."

(Editor's Note.—This is the first of
a series of interviews with members of
the faculty and research students on the
tt'ork they are doing at Stanford. Dr.
Jungeblut, gradfuatc of a number of Ger
man institutions t is assistant professor of
bacteriology. He came to Stanford in
1927.) .

Will science ever learn how to safe
guard the human race from the thousands
of disease-producing bacteria that lurk
in its food, its water, even its very air?
In a small work-scarred laboratory in
the Stanford bacteriology building, Dr.
Claus Jungeblut is delving into the de
fense system of the human body with the
intention of approaching this ideal, goal
of generations of researchers in the
realms of medicine.
Nut human beings, but rabbits, guinea
pigs, test tubes containing frothy liquids,
resembling the chemical make-up of man's
body, are being used in Dr. Jungeblut's
attempt to reveal the mechanism of im
munity.
It is a long, tedious process, this study
of the defense system. Months must pass
before the result of one single experi
ment can be known. Yet he has spent
years at this task, with the prospect of
spending the remaining years of his life
in his search.
"For example, take these antibodies—
the mysterious defensive forces of the

body that can destroy harmful bacteria
and their poisons. How do they work?
—where do they come from?—how can
we aid their production? These are diffi
cult questions ,and yet they must be an
swered if we must know how to make
people immune from contagious diseases.
"We think the antibodies come pri
marily from the bone-marrow and the
spleen, because they seem to accumulate
i there. But that is no proof. If we should
destroy these cells in the spleen, and find
that no antibodies are being produced, !
I that would be more conclusive."
But how was Dr. Jungeblut to remove ■
i a few certain cells from a living crea
j ture? X-rays and certain chemicals could i
! be used. They would destroy the cells, it j
is true, but they would likewise turn the 1
animal into a living corpse.
Then a grotesque device was summoned
back from the days of Paul Ehrlich.
Block the antibody-producing cells of the
liver and spleen! Fill them with ink, with
red dyes, with blue dyes, with anything,
that they would not be killed, but just
temporarily put out of action.
So into the veins of a guinea pig went
an injection of a metal colloid, which
worked just like a dye, and Dr. Jungeblut
waited for weeks. Out came the blood of
the unwilling martyr, tests were made
for antimicrobic activity, and—"We find
that the blocked cells have produced less
antibody; hence we have found one
source—the spleen."
Now to pry into the mechanism.
If a great deal of some such dye as
Congo Kcd, or a colloid like the familiar
Waterproof India Ink were shot into the
body cells, the antibody-producing cells
would be jammed so full of dyestuff or
ink that they would be unable to turn out
any supply of antibody. And, likewise, if
the antibody content of the body was low,
the bacteria invading the body were given
better odds to stay around and get in their
deadly work. Here came the second
step. "It the antibody-producing cells are
incapacitated, the immunity of the ani
mal is decreased."
In what other ways can these cells be
put out of action? By filling them too
lull with anything that doesn't belong
there. Too much alcohol, too much sugar,
too much bacteria. Too much bacteria?
Then that means if a man barely resist
ing influenza should get some tuberculosis
germs in him, he wouldn't have a chance
to battle both of them.
"But what would happen if you ad
ministered just a very small amount of
the blocking agent, just enough to irri
tate the cell, but not enough to fill it?"
he was asked.
"Then the cell, acting under the bother
some irritant, throws (nit more antibodies.
The more antibody produced, the better
the bacteria can be devoured, and the
higher the immunity of the body. What
we look for now is that irritant."
"Do you think you can find it
"Possibly."
