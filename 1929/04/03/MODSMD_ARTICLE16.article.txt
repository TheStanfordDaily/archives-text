from last quarter, Gordon Davis and the
three authors of the Junior Opera—Laird
Doyle, John Paid Jones, and James Webb
—have selected the twenty-one members
of the musical comedy's cast. The cast of
"Moving On"—which is based on circus
life—includes students who have already
appeared in musical shows and campus
plays as well as those who have had no
previous experience.
The six leads will be taken by students
well known to the Stanford stage. Helen
Ward, who took part in last year's Jun
ior Opera, has been cast in the role of
Sally, the ingenue. Zuzu, a lady well
known around the circus lot, will be
played by Jeanette Owens, who also ap
peared in last year's Junior Opera. Par
nie Storey, who has danced in the cho
ruses of several campus musical shows,
has the third woman's lead, Barbara.
The young hero, Garry, will be played
by Fenton Barrett, who took part in last
fall's "Gaieties." Tom Henry, noted for
his work in the Sophomore Play and
"The Wild Duck," will play the role of
Ricardo, the villain. Roy, the third male
lead, will be taken by Paul Speegle, who
also appeared in the "Gaieties" last fall.
The rest of the cast includes Janette
Durfe, Glenn Rusk, Gordon Griffith, Rob
ert Keerl, Douglas Gregg, Jack Dud
field, Robert Hawley, Peter Heiser, Ted
Easton, Ollie Dunn, Tom Pike, Henry
Kleinbach, Hub Moffit, Bertrand Ileflin.
These will take the parts of the numerous
"freaks" found in every circus side show.
In addition to this cast and the cho
ruses, for which tryouts are now being
held, there will be featured a male quar
tet, chosen from those who tried out for
parts in the opera. Tentative plans are
also being made for a girls' trio.
Gordon Davis, director, announces that
there will be a full cast rehearsal to
night in the Little Theatre at 7 o'clock, at
which all members of the cast must be
present .
