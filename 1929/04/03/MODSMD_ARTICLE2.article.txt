# STANFORD BASEBALL TEAM TO MEET BEAR NINE HERE SATURDAY
## 
### 
California's varsity baseball team will
meet the Cardinal nine here Saturday af
ternoon in the first of a three game
series. The Bear willow-wielders ( who
are well up in the California Intercol
legiate Baseball League, are favorites
over the Cards, who are holding down
the cellar position.
Norm Horner, sophomore chucker, will
probably start on the mound for the
Bears. Horner has had unusual success
in his first year of varsity competition,
winning six league contests to date. The
Cal nine defeated the Saint team this
season for the first time since 1925, tak
ing two out of the three game series.
Coach Harry Wolter has been putting
his men through some strenuous practice
sessions since the trip south last week.
Wolter will have a hard time selecting a
pitcher to work the first game against
the Bears, as Spud Harder, the only win
ning chucker of the southern tour, has
had very little experience on the mound
and for that reason is unlikely to see
service. The Cards have been aiming all
season for the California series, and be
hind some reasonably good pitching
should provide some good competition for
the Bears.
