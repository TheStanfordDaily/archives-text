# Vote for the King and Build the Theatre

### 
Dead and buried for some time, resurrected last spring, the Masque
Ball should burst into a bedazzlement of glory this year. It is the will of
the gods that its king shall be elected this week. Three days remain.
Twenty-one nominees are racing for the throne.
Verily the struggle for the crown is toward a noble cause. Every
vote is a red cent for the new theatre. Here's an opportunity to vote in
an election as many times as you want. And who would pass up such a
chance? In this most democratic of elections, everyone who has a penny
can vote, and if he hasn't he can steal one from a dead man's eye. Vote
for the king.
