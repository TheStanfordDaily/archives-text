The Daily is making the rounds of the various departments in the
University in an effort to inform the student body of the work going on
in all of them. The articles concern work that would not break as front
page news, but would appear rather in the form of theses and summaries

great interest to the news reader.

the following list is printed: Artificial Food, Photosynthesis, The Mys
tery of Death Valley, "Phage" (a substance to combat disease), Commer
