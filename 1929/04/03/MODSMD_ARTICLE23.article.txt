# The
						Disappearing College Man
## 
### 
Once upon a time it was possible to identify the university man by the
flow of his cassock or by the cut of his hair. In Greece frequent open air
exercising in the gymnasia was the sign of the student life. And in Ger
many a duelling sword and an air of bravado were the prerequisites.
Times changed; education was taken out of the cloisters; hurling the
discus and throwing the javelin became unfashionable for all but a few;
duelling passed away with Bismarck and Yon Moltke.
Nor has the ebb and flow of educational fashion in this country dif
fered from that on the European continent. Our idiosyncrasies grew up
with our colleges and universities. Many of them died as they were born ;
others, short-lived, enjoyed a breezy existence before giving way to their
successors. Now only a few remain, mute testimony to the past before
they too are merged into conventionality by the great levelling process.
The college man is disappearing. Once spoken of with mingled re
spect, curiosity, and envy, he has become the twentieth century vanishing
American. Like his forerunners in the Old World, he adopted peculiar
customs that stamped him with a print entirely his own. Like them, also,
he is helpless while time toys with pruning shears.
Just why the man in college is now losing this nice distinction is easier
to explain than many other departures. All claims to individuality vanish
when clothiers offer every new cut of his sack suit to all who will buy,
when his coon coat ceases to shut him in a cage by himself, and when his
l<*lgc pin places him on a plane with every member of a provincial club
that has taken up Greek letters. Even his classroom erudition is being
challenged by holders of correspondence school degrees and by studious
subscribers to cultural bookshelves.
While we regret the inevitable passing of a curiosity that has made
the world more livable we consider, after all, that the French philosophers
and the great emancipator did not speak for their times alone. "Liberty,
equality, and fraternity" and "All men are created equal" have not faded
into obsolete tenets; in fashion, as in politics, they still prevail.
