It is interesting to note the outstanding
achievements in Prohibition enforcement
during the first few weeks of the Hoover
administration. They form a record to
which all true Americans can point with
pride, to wit:
1. On March fourth President Hoover
asked people please not to drink.
2. Shortly thereafter Mrs. Wille
brandt's Prohijackers promoted interna
tional good feeling by confiscating a
truckload of liquor consigned to the
Siamese Embassy. They had to give up
the liquor; but they had seen their duty
and done it.
3. Meanwhile, University of Minnesota
students are putting themselves through
college with part-time work as stool-pig
eons and spies upon disorderly houses for
the Minneapolis Law Enforcement y\sso
ciation, financed by generous Minneapolis
Christians.
4. The interests of international peace
were further promoted by Federal Gang
sters aboard U.S. Coast Guard cutters
with the sinking of the Canadian schoo
ner "I'm Alone," flying the British flag,
200 miles away from the United States,
and with the incidental murder of a
French citizen.
5. Unscrupulous bootleggers through
out the country are using the Jones "Five
and Ten" law as an excuse for charging
exorbitant prices ; and, if heavy fines con
tinue, the small independent bootlegger
will be unable to earn an honest living'
any more.
6. Agents interfere with the United
Slates Government by issuing a warrant

for Congressman Michaelson of Illinois
011 a smuggling charge, and by accusing
Congressman William Morgan of Ohio
of the same worthy offense.
7. It continues to he a sad fact that
there is not a single decent bootlegger,
selling a high-class product, within a
radius of thirty miles of this Campus.
8. An Aurora, Illinois woman is mur
dered (officially) by a Prohibition agent
in pursuance of his duty of breaking into
homes of American citizens without a
warrant.
Wonders have been accomplished under
the Hoover administration, and in only
four short weeks. We predict that this
administration will see great advancement
in, and stabilization of, the bootlegging
industry, with consequent increased pros
perity and happier homes for our liquor
purveyors.
We would suggest only one improve
ment in present methods of dispensing
morality: that dangerous firearms be ta
ken away from Prohibition agents, or at
least unloaded. Because now and then
they hurt somebody while at play.
News dispatches state that the dry
movement in France, strong before the
War, has collapsed entirely because of
the results of Prohibition over here.
Well, it may be debatable that we
saved France in 1918 by sending over
2,000,000 men; but it is undeniable that
in the decade since then we have rescued
our Sister Republic from a fate far
worse than German occupation. -
For which God and Volstead be
praised.
