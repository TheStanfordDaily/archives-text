Those fortunate folks who eat at j
the Encina Dining Halls will pay $1.33 i
pei clay this quarter.
Won't that be swill!
Anyone, we understand, taking more
than three minutes to eat will suffer
the usual $2.00 fine. The student for- j
tunate enough to break the grub-grab- J
hing record will be allowed to pay j
iast quarter's rate of $1.23.
"Me and My Shadow" would be the
before and after picture if you ate
just what tasted good over at the
Commons.

The "No Meals on Saturday" plan ;
was conceived, we are informed, from j
the necessity to give busy fingers a j
rest from tedious work at the adding .
machines.
The Encina dining clubs, of course, j
are privileged plutocrats. They are al-;
lowed to kick as much as they want
about the food as long as they file
out in an orderly manner without un
due profanity.
"The usual type of copy is desired," !
says today's story 011 the Literary \

"A special call is made to all the !
banjo players 011 the campus," says a j
Junior Opera Story, "as there is a
place for a number of them."
We also have a place for a number
of saxophone players.
It won't be long before we hear that :
famous' Lagunita song, "My Tan" â€”
"it cost me a lot,
But there's one thing that I've got,
It's my ta-an . . . ."
