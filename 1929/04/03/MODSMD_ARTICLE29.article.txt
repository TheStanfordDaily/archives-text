"The aims of the International Fedora- j
tion of University Women are to further |
friendship and goodwill among the worn- j
en of the Old World and the New and
to foster research among women," said
Doctor Ellen Gleditsch, president of the
Federation, yesterday afternoon in an ad
dress before a special womens' assembly
in the Women's Clubhouse.
The desire for harmony and under
standing among nations which arose j
after the war was the basis of this or- |
ganization. The membership has grown j
rapidly from fifteen countries in 1920 to
thirty-one at the present time. Iceland,
with but eleven members, was the last to
join.
The Federation provides scholarships to
aid the women who are especially inter- !
ested in research work. The money for
these scholarships is raised through gifts
from the separate national organizations.
A woman accepting this scholarship is j
generally expected to study in a foreign ]
country. Dr. Gleditsch feels that this not.
only enables the woman to have a new
angle on her work, but also gives her a
background of understanding and love j
for another people which she might carry j
back to her own country.
Dr. Gleditsch described also some ex- j
periences in the new and less known coun- i
tries of Europe in connection with her
travels.
