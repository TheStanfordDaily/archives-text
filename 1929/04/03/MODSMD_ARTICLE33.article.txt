# TRYOUTS FOR JUNIOR OPERA CHORUSES TO CONTINUE TONIGHT
## 
### 
Tryouts for the men's and women's
(boluses of the Junior Opera, "Moving
| On," will be continued tonight from
7 to 9 o'clock in the Assembly Hall,
j As the combined chorus of the oper
etta will number thirty-two, the larg
est in any campus musical comedy,
| there are more opportunities than
ever for the students who can sing
and dance. The fact that the two
i men's choruses will be separate, one
for dancing and one for singing, makes
it unnecessary that the tryoutees be
able to do both. In addition to the
men's and women's choruses of six
teen each, there will be another of
eight banjo players. A good specialty
tap dancer is particularly desired, ac
cording to Griffith Williams, chairman
of the Junior Opera committee.
Tonight will be the lust chance for
new material, and tomorrow night the
final tryouts will be held. Those called
back for second tryouts will be an
l nounced in the Daily tomorrow ruorn
j ing, and they are requested to appear
from 7 to 9 o'clock. This applies to
j the banjo players as well as the
j dancers. Voices will be stressed more
â€¢ than ever before.
