### 
THE "BIG MEET"
All roads lead to Stanford Sat
urday.
All the eyes of Coast sportdom will be
focused 011 the outcome of the Cardinal-
Trojan track and field meet. The Big
Meet, which comes two weeks later, will
he the Big Meet in name only, for the
Saturdays' engagements will be the track
classic of the season.
Already reams of dope have
been pounded out by the sports
scribes on all sheets from the
small town "home" paper to the
big journals of the metropolitan
centers. Unanimously all these
writers, whether they know any
thing about it or not, have it fig
ured on paper that this year's
contest will be the closest that
has been held on the coast for
many years. "Your guess is as
good as mine" is the common
verdict.
On the other hand, Dink Templeton is
his usual optimistic self. ]Jink's opti
mism is as characteristic as Pop Warner's
pessimism. The Cardinal track mentor is
quite sure his charges will win. Making
a very conservative estimate. Dink figures
that the Redshirts should take the meet
by at least five points. This calculation
doesn't include the relay but takes into
consideration a second in the 440-yard
run, first in the high hurdles, second and
third in the low hurdles, third in the 100-
yard dash, and second and third in the
220-yard dash. It is figured the contest
will be a TRACK meet for fair, as the
Cardinals have things their own way in
the field events.
Stanford, which has won two
successive 1.C.4-A. meets, has be
come accustomed to track vic
tories. To win has been taken
for granted, and it is rather
startling that the Trojans may
humble Stanfords' track prowess.
While most Sons of the Stanford
Red feel that this cannot happen,
it is well to remember "the big- j
ger they are the harder thev (
fall."
Besides wanting to maintain their track j
prestige, the Cardinals have another urge !
to win from the Trojans that is not as 1
practical as it is sentimental. U.S.C. has
won in football and baseball. Stanford |
has won in basketball and tennis. Track ,
is the only major sport left on the pro- [
gram.
While the glamor of any Stan
ford-California contest is still
the main attraction on the sports
calendar ,the Trojans promise to
provide stiff enough competition
that sometime may overshadow
the Big Meet and Big Game. As 1
far as the Southerners are con
cerned .Saturday is just as good
a time as any to begin.

THE "BIG MEET"
All roads lead to Stanford Sat
urday.
All the eyes of Coast sportdom will be
focused 011 the outcome of the Cardinal-
Trojan track and field meet. The Big
Meet, which comes two weeks later, will
he the Big Meet in name only, for the
Saturdays' engagements will be the track
classic of the season.
Already reams of dope have
been pounded out by the sports
scribes on all sheets from the
small town "home" paper to the
big journals of the metropolitan
centers. Unanimously all these
writers, whether they know any
thing about it or not, have it fig
ured on paper that this year's
contest will be the closest that
has been held on the coast for
many years. "Your guess is as
good as mine" is the common
verdict.
On the other hand, Dink Templeton is
his usual optimistic self. ]Jink's opti
mism is as characteristic as Pop Warner's
pessimism. The Cardinal track mentor is
quite sure his charges will win. Making
a very conservative estimate. Dink figures
that the Redshirts should take the meet
by at least five points. This calculation
doesn't include the relay but takes into
consideration a second in the 440-yard
run, first in the high hurdles, second and
third in the low hurdles, third in the 100-
yard dash, and second and third in the
220-yard dash. It is figured the contest
will be a TRACK meet for fair, as the
Cardinals have things their own way in
the field events.
Stanford, which has won two
successive 1.C.4-A. meets, has be
come accustomed to track vic
tories. To win has been taken
for granted, and it is rather
startling that the Trojans may
humble Stanfords' track prowess.
While most Sons of the Stanford
Red feel that this cannot happen,
it is well to remember "the big- j
ger they are the harder thev (
fall."
Besides wanting to maintain their track j
prestige, the Cardinals have another urge !
to win from the Trojans that is not as 1
practical as it is sentimental. U.S.C. has
won in football and baseball. Stanford |
has won in basketball and tennis. Track ,
is the only major sport left on the pro- [
gram.
