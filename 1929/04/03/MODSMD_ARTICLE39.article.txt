# CARD GOLFERS MEET BRUINS, BEARS THIS WEEK AT DEL MONTE
## 
### 
Stanford varsity golfers will meet
teams from the University of California,
U.C.L.A., and University of Southern
California Friday and Saturday on the
Pebble Beach course at Del Monte as
part of the annual Spring Sports Tourna
ment. The Stanford players will leave
the campus Thursday evening and will
complete their matches Saturday in time
to return for the track meet with the
| Trojans.
| Although Stanford has met and dc
j feated both the Bears and the Bruins, and
is thought to have a stronger team than
Southern California, the Cardinals will
have to play this week end without the
services of Captain Ward Edmonds. Ed
monds will be saving himself for the
track meet Saturday. Warner Edmonds
will move up one place in the ranking to
fill his brother's position as number one
man on the team.
