# Warner Starts Spring Football Workouts Today
## Hard Season Faces Warner As Cards Lose Twelve 1928 Lettermen 
### 
With the first official practice ses
sion of the quarter scheduled for this
afternoon, Pop Warner will begin the
annual task of rebuilding the great
Card grid machine.
Next year Warner faces the most
formidable schedule since his arrival
on the Pacific Coast five years ago.
It will take a great job of rebuilding
if he is able to replace such men as
the Redshlrts lose through graduation.
Twelve of last year's lettermen, in
cluding six regulars, will be missing.
The two guard positions, left vacant
by Stanford's ail-American duo, Post
and Robesky, will be the hardest to
fill. Pete Ileiser, star of the Stanford
frosh two years ago, is considered
the oustanding candidate. Driscoll,
Hamilton, Forster, Wilson, and Bardin
are expected to put in a strong bid.
At the tackle position, left vacant
by Tiny Sellman, Klabau, Tandy,
Steinbeck, and Thompson from the
varsity squad, and Doub and Grey, a
likely looking pair from the frosh
eleven, are all good-looking prospects.
Lud Frentrup is almost certain to
take over the position at left halfback
to suceced Frank Wilton, but at right
half the selection will not be as easy.
At present Phil Winneck, and Har
low Rothert, who will be shifted to
right half from fullback, are the most
likely contenders with Rudy Rintala,
last year's yearling star.
At fullback Bill Simkins will un
doubtedly be Warner's choice to suc
ceed Biff Hoffman. Cadell, from the
first-year team, should be a capable
understudy at the key position.
Smalling and Fleishhacker will at
tempt to fill the shoes of Spud Lewis,
capable signal-caller of the 1928 sea
son. If they do not perform up to par
it is expected that Harry Hillman, a
hard-hitting back who was not used
last year, will he changed from right
half to quarterback.
A number of Warner's best pros
pects are at present tied up with
other sports and will be able to re
port only occasionally this spring. Har
low Rothert, A1 Forster, Ray Tandy,
Bill Doub, and Rudy Rintala are out
for track while baseball is claiming
Bill Simkins, Perry Taylor, and Chuck
Smalling. Walt Ileinecke has a bad
knee which will probably keep him
out of practice until fall.

fill. Pete Ileiser, star of the Stanford
frosh two years ago, is considered
the oustanding candidate. Driscoll,
Hamilton, Forster, Wilson, and Bardin
are expected to put in a strong bid.
At the tackle position, left vacant
by Tiny Sellman, Klabau, Tandy,
Steinbeck, and Thompson from the
varsity squad, and Doub and Grey, a
likely looking pair from the frosh
eleven, are all good-looking prospects.
Lud Frentrup is almost certain to
take over the position at left halfback
to suceced Frank Wilton, but at right
half the selection will not be as easy.
At present Phil Winneck, and Har
low Rothert, who will be shifted to
right half from fullback, are the most
likely contenders with Rudy Rintala,
last year's yearling star.
At fullback Bill Simkins will un
doubtedly be Warner's choice to suc
ceed Biff Hoffman. Cadell, from the
first-year team, should be a capable
understudy at the key position.
Smalling and Fleishhacker will at
tempt to fill the shoes of Spud Lewis,
capable signal-caller of the 1928 sea
son. If they do not perform up to par
it is expected that Harry Hillman, a
hard-hitting back who was not used
last year, will he changed from right
half to quarterback.
A number of Warner's best pros
pects are at present tied up with
other sports and will be able to re
port only occasionally this spring. Har
low Rothert, A1 Forster, Ray Tandy,
Bill Doub, and Rudy Rintala are out
for track while baseball is claiming
Bill Simkins, Perry Taylor, and Chuck
Smalling. Walt Ileinecke has a bad
knee which will probably keep him
out of practice until fall.
With the first official practice ses
sion of the quarter scheduled for this
afternoon, Pop Warner will begin the
annual task of rebuilding the great
Card grid machine.
Next year Warner faces the most
formidable schedule since his arrival
on the Pacific Coast five years ago.
It will take a great job of rebuilding
if he is able to replace such men as
the Redshlrts lose through graduation.
Twelve of last year's lettermen, in
cluding six regulars, will be missing.
The two guard positions, left vacant
by Stanford's ail-American duo, Post
and Robesky, will be the hardest to
fill. Pete Ileiser, star of the Stanford
