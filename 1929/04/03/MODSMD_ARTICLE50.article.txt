# FAMOUS VIOLINIST TO PERFORM IN FOURTH CONCERT OF SERIES
## Albert Spalding Is Product Of Europe's Outstanding Musical Instructors 
### 
Albert Spaulding, violinist, who will
give the fourth concert of the A.S.S.U.
Series tomorrow evening at 8:15 in
the Stanford Pavilion, is today one of
the most popular of any of the world
famous violinists.
Spalding, after graduating from the
Conservatory in Bologna, Italy, made
ilia professional dehut in Paris, ap
pearing on a program with Adelina
Patti. He continued his studies for
two more years in Paris with the
n;aster Lefort, and then made several
long successful concert tours in the
European countries.
He was received with fine respect
by the critics, when he made his
American debut at Carnegie Hall, but
there was nothing sensational about
Uic performance, and the public did
not know whether or not to enthuse
over the young American violinist.
Several other recitals that year at
tracted increased interest in his work
and at the close of the first season
it was clear that Spalding had estab
lished himself. From then on Spald
ing has continued to a deserved posi
tion with the finest violinists of this
generation.
For those who did not procure sea
son seats, tickets may be obtained at
the A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union
today and tomorrow.
