CHICAGO, April 2 (IP). — Property
damage mounting into the millions and
a serious new flood threat remained to
day to remind the Midwest of the rain,
wind, and snow storm that swept over
the region Sunday and yesterday.
Heavy rains in the central, and bliz
zards in the northern, states had again
swollen nearly all streams and the danger
was considered acute as the tributaries
brought this added burden to the Missis
sippi, which was already Hearing the tops
of its levees
