# ART GALLERY OPENS LEIGHTON ENGRAVING EXHIBITS TOMORROW
## 
### 
i The University Art Gallery, will open
an exhibition oi* wood-engravings tomor
row, to last until April 17.
I The engravings are by Clare Jxnghton,
I the youngest hut also the most distin
! guished of the English artists who have
| recently revived wood-engraving. Many
: of her pieces have been bought for the
| two national English collections at the
British Museum and South Kensington.
Her work is also to be found in the Met
| ropolitan Museum, the New York Public
Library, the Boston Museum, and the
I National Gallery of Canada.
The noted art critic, H. N. Brailsford,
j writing of her engravings says, "Always
j there is the same strong and honest dravv
i ing, but there is here a gift rarer and
! higher than the talent of the craftsman:
i the power to convey emotion. She is at
I home among French workers and Balkan
| villagers, but her greatest achievement is
her interpretation of English rural life
in her illustrations for Thomas Hardy's
'The Return of the Native.' Her grav
ing tool can give speech and personality
to the silent moon and the solitary tree:
her peasants become the limbs and hands
of these ominous landscapes. Above all,
there is nothing mannered or self-con
scious in her work: it has the sincerity
I which outlasts fashion."
I The Stanford Art Gallery is open daily
I to the public from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
