# STANFORD SWIMMERS FACE TOUGH CONTESTS IN WEEK-END CARNIVAL
## 
### 
In the aquatic part of the minor
nports carnival Friday and Saturday,
the Stanford paddlers will line up
against the combined .squads of Cali
fornia, U.C.L.A., and U.S.C., for the
Cardinals are planning to enter men
in every event, while the other schools
are concentrating on particular j
events.

None of the other members of the j
southern division of the Pacific Coast :
Conference had vacations last week,
and Stanford's lay-off will tend to put j
the Card swimmers at a disadvantage.
IJ.S.C. is Stanford's strongest com
petitor in water polo, and is throwing
a large part of her strength into the
ball-tossing part of the meet. Support- j
ing a well-balanced polo team, the .
Southerners will bring Bela Kendall, j
who stars in both the free-style and j
back stroke races.
The water polo team at U.C.L.A. is
weaker, and about on a par with Cali- j
fornia as far as previous showings
go. The Bruin mermen are concen
trating on several of the swimming '
events. One of those events is diving, j
in which Brownie Davis stars. Davis j
is a real danger to Throndson, and ;
lias offered exceedingly stiff competi- j
tion on previous occasions.
California's strength is known
pretty definitely from their last quar- [
ter's defeats before the Cardinal j
•squads. Led by Ducato and Rader, |
and with§ut the break in practice j
which Stanford has suffered, the Bears
are pointing all efforts toward a water
polo victory. The polo team has im- j
proved greatly since meeting Stanford. j
