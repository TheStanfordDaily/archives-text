j COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 2. (VP)â€”
j Communication by camera, with the
j printed word auxiliary to pictures, is
i predicted by B. A. Augnibaugh, super-
I visor of visual instruction for the
i Ohio department of education.
He calls the news pictures of today
lineal descendants of crude drawings
'by men of the Stone age. History
1 books used in the twentieth century
1 schools, he dcelares, are merely tem
| porary substitutes for pictorial rec
! ords of events of ancient times.
Future histories, Mr. Auginbaugli
| forecasts, will be rolled up on reels
! and stored in fireproof cans, and the
| history class will become a motion,
; perhaps talking, picture show.
j The time will come, in his belief,
jwhen books will cease to be published
j and all great drama and literature
; will be preserved on celluloid instead
I of paper. Auginbaugh does not believe
, the printed language ever will be
j abandoned, but rather will be used
auxiliary to the picture.
The alphabet was devised, Augin
j baugh explained, because ancient man
could not make pictures fast enough
! to keep up with events of his day. He
j thinks the modern camera adequate
j tc keep pace with worldwide happen
ings.
