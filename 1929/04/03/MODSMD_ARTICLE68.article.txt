# Women Debaters Of Four Schools Discuss Puritans
## 
### 
Excellent arguments and witty re
marks featured a no-decision debate
held last night in the Little Theatre
between teams representing Mills Col
lege, College of the Pacific, Califor
nia, and Stanford. The question dis
cussed was, "Resolved, That the Mod
ern Contempt of Puritanism Is Justi
fied.
Ann Hightower of Stanford and
Marion Van Gilder of Pacific upheld
the affirmative, while the negative
was ably argued by Margaret Ham
mond of California and Grace Wil
mott of Mills. Miss Van Gilder made
an especially able and humorous talk
in presenting an imaginary picture of
a Puritan. Miss Hammond made a
number of good points in her rebuttal
speech, while Miss Hightower was
clever in answering the questions of
the audience after the debate. She
also made a well-organized talk. Miss
Wilmott gave a very informal and na
turally presented speech.
