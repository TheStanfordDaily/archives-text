veterans from the varsity boxing team,
Loach Harry Maloncy remains optimistic
and lias been intensively drilling the six
redshirts who will enter the Far-Western
Conference championships Friday and
Saturday in Sacramento.
Sparring and practice bouts have been
scrapped in favor of individual lessons.
For the past week Maloney and Assistant
Coach Schall have been giving the men
personal training. This program will con
tinue through the final practice which
begins at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
Vance Rogers, Stanford's flashy feath
erweight and the chief hope of the Car
dinals in the approaching tourney, is in
great condition. Paul Maurer, another
featherweight, lias recently spent much
time on the road.
Ralph Malcom and Harry Birch, light
weights; Gordon Gilbert, light-heavy
weight; and Alfred "Red" Hamilton,
heavyweight, are the other Stanford en
trants. All of these men are newcomers
in the ring, but are showing much prom
