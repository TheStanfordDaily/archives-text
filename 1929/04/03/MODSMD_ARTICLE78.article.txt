# THOSE SURPRISING BROWNS

### Feg Murray 
It's the "St. Louis Browns," they're i
singing out where "01' Man River" rolls
along past the "Show Me" state. 'At's a
fact. The Cards, by losing four games in
a row to those Terrible Yankees last Oc
tober, have made rabid St. Louis fans feel
blue all over when merely thinking about
last autumns' classic. Dan Rowley's well-1
oiled machine, on the contrary, has taken'
on new favor, and the hopes and fears ;
of most of the Mound City partisans will
ride with Dolly Gray, Lu Blue, and the !
rest of the colorful crew that "Dapper
Dan" and Phil Ball have gathered to
gether. )

Howley, it will be remembered, became]
manager of the St. Louis Browns on No-I
: vember 3, 1926, soon after the team, un
der the leadership of George Sisler, had
finished in seventh position. With little
j chance to reorganize the team, the!
Browns finished in seventh place again in \
I 1927, but by the following season the :
I square-jawed, two-fisted manager had
; made many startling changes, and his;
team was the sensation of the American
! League, landing in third place behind the .
Yankees and the Philadelphia Athletics. j
Among others, Dan Howley acquired
J games, while Dolly Gray, formerly of the '

| players O'Rotirke, Crowder, Blue, Man
! ush, Gray, Kress, Brannon, McGowan,
Ogden, Collins, and Bettencourt, and got
rid of such veterans as Sister, Adams,
Gerber, Miller, Williams, Rice, O'Neill,
â–  Jones, VanGilder, Wingard, and Gaston,
j Heinie Manish and Lu Blue were of
great help in bringing the Brownies up
' to their high position, and Manush came
j within an eyelash of being the league's
leading batter, an honor he had held once
j before, in 1926. Pitcher Alvin Crowder,
J obtained from Washington, surprised ev
eryone by winning more than twenty
' Athletics, won twenty and lost twelve.

Shortstop Ralph Kress and Second Base
man Otis Brannon, obtained from Tulsa,
were the sensations of the early part of
the race, while the corking hitting of
Outfielder Frank McGowan had the fans
' talking during the final stages of the sea
| son.
Fred Schulte, so training camp stories
' say, is hitting as he did two years ago,
i and with new blood provided by such
' recruits as Third Baseman Grimes, Pitch
ers Cobb (no relation to Ty), Kinsey, and
Estrada, Mound City fans have visions
of another Brown-Yankee duel reminis
! cent of 1922.
