# ZOOLOGISTS PLAN OUTING
## 
### 
Plans are being made by the Zool
ogy Club for a week-end outing to
Pacific Grove on April 13 and 14. Pro
fessor J. O. Snyder will act as host at
the campfire dinner at his Pacific
Grove house. Members of the club and
their friends are invited to attend.
Those who are expecting to go are
requested to see Richard Cutter or
Richard Croker before April 8 so that
arrangements for transportation can
be made. Further announcements will
be posted on the bulletin board in the
Zoology building.
