# Kathleen Norris Sees Revision of Present Social, Moral Code
## 
### Carroll O'Meara 
A complete readjustment of the moral
and social code of ihe younger generation
is what Kathleen Norris, famed author
ess and columnist, sees as the inevitable
outcome of the present "social revolt."
"The existing situation—of increased
freedom, and lack of morality and con
vention—is only a natural swing of the
pendulum," she declared in an interview
yesterday at her Palo Alto home. "As
sure as the pendulum swung one way, it
will swing back. I believe that the reac
tion is now under way and will become
a popular movement, readjusting things
to their former level.
"Those who criticize the younger gen
eration are inclined to exaggerate, and
though there is room for criticism, I
think that the critics overlook the fact'
that the rising generation is the most en
lightened, courageous, and independent
generation the world has ever known.
The youths of today have had the experi
ence and knowledge their parents never
had.
"The immorality that does exist now is
primarily the result of parental neglect,"
Mrs. Norris believes. "The World War,
modern invention, prosperity, luxury, and
indifference have all contributed. War,
a colossal crime in itself, naturally leads
to crime. It is a liar and a hypocrite that
makes liars and hypocrites of its victims.
Men go to war to defend women and

children; actually tlicy arc destroying ev
erything women and children need. They
return from war with debased ideals that
make them strangers in their own homes.
"Motion pictures, automobiles, and elec
tricity, encouraged by prosperity, have
widened our horizon and led us to an in
creased freedom, especially the freedom
of women from home ties. The resulting
indifference is responsible for the immor
ality of this age."
Mrs. Norris also attributes today's pa
gan philosophy to this common indiffer
ence toward the accepted ideals and stand
ards of yesterday.
"People should have faith in some or
ganized religion," she says. "A general
faith is inadequate because it lacks back
bone. At present there is a tendency on
the part of teachers and pseudo-scientists
:to preach atheism—atheism in theory
| only, of course. The sad part of their
teaching is that they arc making regret
table impressions on immature, plastic
minds. They try to believe that they do
not accept the existence of a Divinity.
They accept other things, such as sex
It ve, mother love, and all the facts our
lives are based on, yet they cannot explain
! them. Their attitude is 'If T can't under
j stand it, it doesn't exist.'
"If there were just one thing, not in
j the curriculum, which I could wish for
i the younger generation, it is this: Hu
! mility toward things tlicy do not under
| stand."
