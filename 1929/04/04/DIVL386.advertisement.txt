THESE CEBS *MIMPANT$ M
Can you imagine a modern, high-speed
business man draping himself in the same
type of underwear that Rip Van Winkle
used?.... Not 50.... But Reis "Jimpants" and
"Jimshirts" are in tune with this modern,
colorful age....they're clean-cut, vigorous
looking, vigorous-feeling garments....de
signed for men who know what they
want and know how to
get it.
