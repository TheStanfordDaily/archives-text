## 
### 
When the University of California j
and Stanford baseball teams meet
here Saturday, the Bears will be bat
tling for the championship of the
California Intercollegiate Baseball
League, and the Cards to regain pres
! tige lost in the early-season games.
The Bear nine was supposed to play
l Santa Clara's ball team yesterday, but i
! the contest was postponed on account j
|of rain. This leaves the Broncs in i
| first place by a narrow margin, and •
Cal a chance to cop the championship ;
by a couple of victories over the \
Cards.
Coach Carl Zamloch is saving Norm 1
! Horner, sophomore pitching ace, to
! start against the Cards. Horner has j
been the pitching sensation of the i
i league this season, having two vie- !
| lories over Saint Mary's, last year's '
j champs, to his credit.
j The Cardinal nine has a chance to |
I knock the Bears out of the coveted i
j championship as well as take the |
series, if Coach Harry Wolter can get ;
his chuckers started. Of late, the j
Stanford infield has been rather wob-'
Idy, but a few stiff practice sessions ;
should remedy this.
