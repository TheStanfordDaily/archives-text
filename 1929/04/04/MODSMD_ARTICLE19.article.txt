## 
### 
Yesterday's long swimming practice I
showed the varsity mermen well on '
the road to first-class condition for
the aquatic part of the minor sports 1
carnival Friday and Saturday. Out
standing in the afternoon's events was
Barret Brown's time of 2:27 in the 1
220-yard free-style swim. Brown was |
swimming without competition, and j
will undoubtedly better this time
against the swimmers from U.C.L.A., j
U.S.C., and California.
Exceptionally stiff competition is j
expected from the other schools, none I
of whom were weakened by a break j
in practice last week. Stanford suf
fered hardest in water polo, where
constant practice is necessary to con
sistently good playing. However,
airy, accompanied by a battery of field
co-ordinated team to face a tough
schedule Saturday.
