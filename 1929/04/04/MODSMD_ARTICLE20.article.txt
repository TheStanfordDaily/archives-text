order: the family is to lead the way,
followed by the embassy staff, General
Lasson, representing President Dou
mergue, the President of the Senate,
the President of the Chamber of Depu
ties, members of the French Cabinet,
Marshals Joffre, Lyautey, Petain, and
Franchet a'Esperey, the diplomatic
corps, the Prefect of the Seine, the
Prefect of Police, the President of
the Municipal Council, the President
of the General Council, General Gou
raud, and representatives of Ameri
can societies.
Dean Beekman of the American
Pro-Cathedral will read the funeral
service to which the ceremony at the
church will be limited.
Escorted by a military guard of
honor the body will be placed aboard
the French cruiser Tourville while
troops present arms and cannon thun
der the ambassador's salute of nine
teen guns.
The Tourville is believed to be the
fastest cruiser in the world but across
the Atlantic it will maintain a funeral
pace so as not to beat the Aquitania
with the ambassador's daughter-in
law, Mrs. Parmeley Herrick, to New
York. The Aquitania leaves France
Saturday. The two ships will keep in
constant touch by wireless through
out the voyage.
