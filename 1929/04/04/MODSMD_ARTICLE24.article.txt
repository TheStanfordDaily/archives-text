the expense of Palo Alto 2 ( XX), which means the student body, will soon
become a pleasant myth to be told around the fires by reminiscing alumni.

the number of offenders amounts to a sizeable sum. Hence the serious
ness of the thing.

very odious one. It should cease now with means of apprehension avail
able.
