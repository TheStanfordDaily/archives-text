# A 						Freshman Would Be King
## 
### 
Ignominious insult to the exalted eminence of the throne. A fresh
man. a green, untried, unsophisticated member of that still-to-be-heard-of
class of 1932 is now in the lead for the kingship of the Masque Ball.
What more horrible situation, what more glaring error, what more in
decorous thing could blight the splendor of the sacred ermine?
Cunning chicanery is this to outwit the lordly upperclassmen. But
away with these striplings and their insidious, damnable drollery. There
are those who regard the royal purple as high above such buffooning frip
pery. Imagine a lowly frosh. seated in his gimcrack finery upon the noble
dais. An outrage! an outrage!
Down with the lumbering louts. They shall not make of this a fustin
farce. For king and for country, let the minions rally to the cause. A
freshman would be king! Bah! Away with him.
