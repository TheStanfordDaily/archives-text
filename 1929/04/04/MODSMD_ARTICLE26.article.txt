# Does the Gown Bluff the Town?

It would be against the dignity of the gown to say that half of the
average university student body is composed of masters in the fine art
of bluffing, but such is the indictment laid at the door of the college bred
by Edwin E. Slosson in a recent article in Collier's.
Figures offered by Mr. Slosson to substantiate his claim show that
half of the university students given a test to show up their bluffing apti
tude bluffed 46.58 per cent or more. One-fourth of them bluffed 60.97
per cent or more. Only one-fourth of them bluffed 30.35 per cent or less.
The freshmen bluffed the most; seniors least. The men bluffed more than
the women. And (pedantic pedagogs take note) the students who ranked
highest academically averaged lowest scores in bluffing.
Furthermore as proof of the university as a training ground for the
accomplished bluffer, the non-university group, consisting of bookkeep
ers, toolmakers, chauffeurs, salesmen, and laundrymen of about the same
age. bluffed much less than those who had had training in this fine art in
college. Their average bluffing score was 25.7 per cent.
At last the university has found a tiling that it can impart to its
minions. Judging by these facts lew students will leave the musty walls
of dear old alma mater without having become first rate bluffers. And in
this same category might be added that peculiar collegiate fellow, known
in campus slang as the apple polisher. Really it's marvelous the things one
can learn at college.
