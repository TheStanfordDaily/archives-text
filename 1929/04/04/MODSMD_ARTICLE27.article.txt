The Oxford Book of Regency Verse,
Chosen by H. S. Milford. Oxford:
Clarendon Press.
Tlie newest addition to the delight
ful Oxford books of verse fills the
forty-year gap between the Book of
| Eighteenth Century Verse and the
Book of Victorian Verse. Its puzzling
| title is explained by the fact that, al
though the Regency had little to do
with contemporary poetry, the head
of the state during most of the period
covered by this volume, 1798 to 1837,
was the Prince Regent.
The excellence of this book, both in
literary choice and in physical typo
graphy, is on a par with that of the
previous volumes.
Besides offering fine poems of the
more famous poets, the editor has
striven to give a representative selec
tion of the work of the lesser poets
of the period. The ideal Mr. Milford
sets before himself is best stated in
his own words: "A book of this kind,
besides giving the greatest things of
the majors, must also represent the
minors—it must be historical, must
show what was, in effect, happening,
what was being written and read."
This was complicated, he adds, for
"the majors are so very major, and
the minors so very minor!"
Nevertheless, he has shown fine dis
crimination in his selection, and of
fers an excellent book, covering a
period beginning with Wordsworth
and Coleridge, including the whole
poetical careers of Scott, Byron, Shel
ley, and Keats, and ending with the
earlier work of Browning and Tenny
son. —Reid Briggs.
Accident. By Arnold Bennett. (New
York: Doubleday, Doran.) 215 pp.
$2.50. 1929.
Arnold Bennett again! Yes. Again.
Fitting indeed is it thus to begin a
review of a novel by him whose fame
was early built on tales told of the
Five Towns —by him whose fame is
builded higher, story by story, year
by year. Higher? Surely higher. For,
is not Bennett prolific? To be pro
lific is a virtue, is't not so? A virtue,
that is. in a creative writer, so-called.
Then may we say perhaps of this
man, Benett, today: he is greater, his
fame has just grown greater, for he
has written yet another novel, one
called "Accident."
Yet naught seems added to the good
repute of this teller of many tales by
the telling of yet another. This novel,
"Accident," is not nearly as good a
one as that other quite recent one of
his, "The Vanguard." Good? How am
biguous a word to use. Yet it fits.
Good is the word. You know what we
mean, of course. A good novel is one

start reading quite casually late

jof an afternoon or early of an eve
ning, then finish reading in bed, dur
j ing one of the wee hours, say 3 a.m. —
though you know it's bad for your
eyes, this reading in bed. "Accident"
i is not a good novel then.
Even when the railroad accident
happens, the accident about which the
I action —such as it is—centers, Bar
| rett manages to describe it with such
| equanimity—or is it sang froid? —that,
the reader is not a bit moved, not
; even a little upset. In a short while
we have Alan Frith-Walter, who was
badly shaken in the accident, finding
his volume of Wordsworth and trying
i in vain to put his mind upon its con
j tents precisely as he had tried in
! vain to put his mind on the same
| contents before ever an accident hap-
Ipened.
This Frith-Walter, who was by the
I way, traveling from England to visit
his wife on the Continent when the
train he was riding in crashed with
another —this Frith-Walter had with
him on his train, a son and a daugh
ter-in-law who were estranged soon
after the accident was over, done
j with. Jack, the son, and his wife,
j Pearl, felt their wedded life had bet
, ter go on. They felt this after the
j accident took place, not before. The
| accident changed everything, in spite
j of the fact that Jack was as much a
! patrician with proletarian sympathies
| after the accident as he had been be
fore it, and in spite of the fact that
Pearl had decided to leave Jack be
cause of his "Red" sympathies, sym
pathies still Jack's as well when the
accident had become an event of the
past as they had been his before.
Enough said.
Though "Accident" is not a good
' novel —at least, by one criterion —
I though it is not in toto a good novel,
1 there are good things in it, paradoxi
| cal though that may appear. Really
' those statements are not contradic
tory, not really. For we would postu
j late this: not all good things make
good novels, only some good things
do, only some. Here are some good
things, un peu, yet they of themselves
I do not make "Accident" a good novel.
! Do they? Read:
"How worldly! Worldliness, he
iFrith-Walter) decided, was the qual
ity which best appealed to him. Words
worth lessened in importance. Some
| thing naive about Wordsworth." And
j again:
? " 'Did I once love like that? Is it
i possible that once I was so young?'
J And he realized, as never before, that
|he was old. But the realization did
i not sadden him with regrets. He was
j content to be tranquil and to appre
ciate in another the ecstasy he could
: no more achieve."

The Oxford Book of Regency Verse,
Chosen by H. S. Milford. Oxford:
Clarendon Press.
Tlie newest addition to the delight
ful Oxford books of verse fills the
forty-year gap between the Book of
| Eighteenth Century Verse and the
Book of Victorian Verse. Its puzzling
| title is explained by the fact that, al
though the Regency had little to do
with contemporary poetry, the head
of the state during most of the period
covered by this volume, 1798 to 1837,
was the Prince Regent.
The excellence of this book, both in
literary choice and in physical typo
graphy, is on a par with that of the
previous volumes.
Besides offering fine poems of the
more famous poets, the editor has
striven to give a representative selec
tion of the work of the lesser poets
of the period. The ideal Mr. Milford
sets before himself is best stated in
his own words: "A book of this kind,
besides giving the greatest things of
the majors, must also represent the
minors—it must be historical, must
show what was, in effect, happening,
what was being written and read."
This was complicated, he adds, for
"the majors are so very major, and
the minors so very minor!"
Nevertheless, he has shown fine dis
crimination in his selection, and of
fers an excellent book, covering a
period beginning with Wordsworth
and Coleridge, including the whole
poetical careers of Scott, Byron, Shel
ley, and Keats, and ending with the
earlier work of Browning and Tenny
son. —Reid Briggs.

Arnold Bennett again! Yes. Again.
Fitting indeed is it thus to begin a
review of a novel by him whose fame
was early built on tales told of the
Five Towns —by him whose fame is
builded higher, story by story, year
by year. Higher? Surely higher. For,
is not Bennett prolific? To be pro
lific is a virtue, is't not so? A virtue,
that is. in a creative writer, so-called.
Then may we say perhaps of this
man, Benett, today: he is greater, his
fame has just grown greater, for he
has written yet another novel, one
called "Accident."
Yet naught seems added to the good
repute of this teller of many tales by
the telling of yet another. This novel,
"Accident," is not nearly as good a
one as that other quite recent one of
his, "The Vanguard." Good? How am
biguous a word to use. Yet it fits.

Arnold Bennett again! Yes. Again.
Fitting indeed is it thus to begin a
review of a novel by him whose fame
was early built on tales told of the
Five Towns —by him whose fame is
builded higher, story by story, year
by year. Higher? Surely higher. For,
is not Bennett prolific? To be pro
lific is a virtue, is't not so? A virtue,
that is. in a creative writer, so-called.
Then may we say perhaps of this
man, Benett, today: he is greater, his
fame has just grown greater, for he
has written yet another novel, one
called "Accident."
Yet naught seems added to the good
repute of this teller of many tales by
the telling of yet another. This novel,
"Accident," is not nearly as good a
one as that other quite recent one of
his, "The Vanguard." Good? How am
biguous a word to use. Yet it fits.
Good is the word. You know what we
mean, of course. A good novel is one

Even when the railroad accident

the reader is not a bit moved, not
; even a little upset. In a short while
we have Alan Frith-Walter, who was
badly shaken in the accident, finding
his volume of Wordsworth and trying
i in vain to put his mind upon its con
j tents precisely as he had tried in

| contents before ever an accident hap-
Ipened.
This Frith-Walter, who was by the
I way, traveling from England to visit
his wife on the Continent when the
train he was riding in crashed with
another —this Frith-Walter had with
him on his train, a son and a daugh
ter-in-law who were estranged soon
after the accident was over, done
j with. Jack, the son, and his wife,
j Pearl, felt their wedded life had bet

j accident took place, not before. The
| accident changed everything, in spite
j of the fact that Jack was as much a

fore it, and in spite of the fact that

Clarendon Press.
Tlie newest addition to the delight
ful Oxford books of verse fills the
forty-year gap between the Book of

though the Regency had little to do
with contemporary poetry, the head
of the state during most of the period
covered by this volume, 1798 to 1837,

The excellence of this book, both in
