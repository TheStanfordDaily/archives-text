### BY FEG MURRAY 
The Illinois Athletic Club, of Chi
cago's famous "Boul' Mich," whose
tri-colored emblem appears above as
a background for Mr. Conger, has, for
the past dozen years or so, special
ized in runners named Ray. First it
was Joie Ray, then Ray Watson, then
Ray Dodge, and now Ray Conger.
"Conquering Conger" is now running
at the peak of his form, and it is too
bad that he didn't have a little more
of his present speed over at Amster
dam. where he failed to finish in the
money in the 1500-meter race.
Ray Conger is a very likeable young
man, and learned his running from a
former world's champion hurdler, Bob
Simpson, at lowa State University. He
came into prominence a year ago this
winter when he defeated Lloyd Hahn
in a 1,000-yard race in Kansas City in
the phenomenal time of 2 minutes, 11
seconds —the race in which Hahn
claimed that Conger had "given him
the elbow." Ray also showed his heels
to "Heir Doktor" Peltzer, and later
won the 1500-meter race at the na
tional championships and Olympic
tryouts in Boston, setting a new Amer
ican record of 3:55.

This indoor season has been Con
ger's best. He provided the upset of

the winter at the Millrose Games in
New York on February 9th, when he
beat the "Not-so-Peerless Paavo"
Nurmi in a mile in 4:17 2-5, and then
successfully defended his indoor 1000-
yard crown in the National A.A.U.
games on February 23d.
It has just been announced that
Ray has been awarded the prize given
annually to the athlete whose per
formance most distinguishes the Mill
rose Games. Now that will please his
wife!
