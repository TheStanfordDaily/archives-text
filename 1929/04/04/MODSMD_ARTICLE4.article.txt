# SPALDING APPEARS IN VIOLIN RECITAL
## American Artist Will Play Tonight in Fourth of A.S.S.U. Concerts 
### 
Albert Spalding, the foremost Amer- j
ican violinist, will be heard this eve- ;
ning at 8:15 o'clock in the Stanford
Pavilion in the fourth concert of the j
A.S.S.U. series. Tickets may be ob- 1
tained today in the Old Union.
Much of Spalding's musical genius
was inherited from his mother, who
was for a long time soloist with the
Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Spald- 1
ing was put under the tutelage of
i several famous teachers, including
J Chiti, the Florentine master; and !
! when he graduated from the Bologna j
i Conservatory at fourteen he received
: the highest honors ever accorded any- i
j one since Mozart.
Spalding's professional debut was
j made in Paris with Adelina Patti at
| the Chalet. In America it took some |
time for the public to realize his true ;
i ability; his debut was received with
j fine respect by the critics, but there
; was nothing sensational about his per-
I formance. During the following year,
| however, it was interesting to notice
the change in the public mind. They
recognized that Spalding was an un- i
! usual artist and he is now recognized j
j as one of the finest violinists of this j
generation. From the point of view of i
popularity there is no artist in the
world who can produce such an im
posing list of re-engagements.
