# FOUR TRACKMEN IN HOSPITAL AS TROY THREATENS
## Nichols, Edmonds, Dyer Join Krenz; Doctor Says All To Be Out Today 
### 
By Frank Whiteley
With the U.S.C. track meet but two
days off three more of Coach Dink
Templeton's point-winners joined Eric
Krenz in the Palo Alto Hospital yes
terday, Captain Ross Nichols, Ward
Edmonds, and Hec Dyer being the
new patients. Their condition is not
serious, and all four will be out today,
according to Dr. E. F. Roth.
Notwithstanding the fact that it had
rained all day, Templeton put his two
milers and half-milers through a stiff
workout on the Stadium track yester
day. McKinnon, running with the half
milers, took first in the two-lap event
in 2:07, and Douglas Aiken won the
two-mile in 10:31. The muddy track
prevented better times.
It will be up to Captain Ross Nich
ols and his teammates on the track to
pile up enough points Saturday to turn
back the Trojan invaders. Stanford's
field men are clearly superior to the
best of the Southerners, but the mar
gin scored in the six field events may
not be large enough to offset the
points Coach Dean Cromwell's nun
are doped to chalk up in the eight
track events.
Much will depend on Ward Ed-
monds in (he two hurdles races. Nich
olds is the ravorite to cop the Highs,
and Edmonds will be right behind
him, fighting it out for second place
with Webber of U.S.C. The latter two
are about equal in speed with Webber
having the edge in experience. Smith,
sophomore, will be the third Card
entry and may place. Ernie Payne of
U.S.C., who won the low barrier event
against California in 24 seconds, will
give Nichols and Edmonds a great
race for first place in the lows. Ed
monds, running the low hurdles for

the first time in competition against
Washington, last week, finished only
a foot behind Steve Anderson, one oi
the greatest hurdlers in the country.
Jimmy Payne of U.S.C. is not in con
dition and probably won't place.

Borah, of course, is the favorite to
win the shorter distances; and Tro
jan supporters claim that the curly
headed sprinter's teammates,
and Wehner, will finish one-two be
hind in both races. However, the Tro
jan captain will have to do some fast
stepping if he defeats Hec Dyer, Car
dinal sophomore flash; and Maurer
and Wehner will have their work cut
out for them to keep him from plac
ing. Dyer is a strong runner and is
improving all the time, especially in
the 220. Lauritzen and McDermott
are also to be figured in the dashes.
The quarter-mile, as is generally the
case in a Stanford meet, promises to
be the feature race of the day with
a. four-cornered battle developing be
tween Morrison and Shove of the
Cards and Vic Williams and Bastnjian
of U.S.C. Morrison has done 48 4-5
this season, and Shove turned in a
surprise win in the Washington in
door meet in 50 flat. Williams was
clocked in 49 3-5 in the Occidental
meet two weeks ago and again in the
California meet last Saturday. Basta
jian, too, can break 50 seconds.
Coach Cromwell has been shifting
his men around in the 880, mile, and
2-mile and whatever way he has run
them they have seemed capable of
fast performances. Gloege and Schurr
will doubtless run the half and will
be pitted against French, Neikirk, and
Gooden or Jennings with the two Tro
jans having a slight edge. Boh Swede,
Cutlibert, and Fitzmaurice of U.S.C.
will be seen in the mile, battling it
out. with McKinnon and Parker of the
Cards. The result will be a toss-up.
Fitzmaurice may also be used in the
880.
In the two-mile Woodruff and Pat
terson will be matched against Bob
Brown of Stanford. Woodruff, because
of his spectacular win over Henry
Coe last year, is favored.
If Captain Borah runs as anchor
man on the U.S.C. mile relay team,
this event promises to be a classic
among Pacific Coast relays. Borah ran
a 48 4-5 second lap against California,
and this is as fast as Morrison has
done so far this season. The other
Trojan relay men, Williams, MacFad
den, and Bastajian, balance up fairly
evenly with Shove, Syer, and McDer
mott of Stanford. It is possible that
McKinnon may be used in place of
Syer.
