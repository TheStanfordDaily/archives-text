A Novelty in '71 —A Necessity Today
jl
/V CCORD TNG to old records the first passenger elevator in
San I <rancisco was installed in a photographer's gallery on
Montgomery Street in 1871.
Fime has wrought great changes since then, and the San
Francisco of today is a great city with many tall buildings in which
Vertical Transportation is a necessity instead of a novelty.
From "coast to coast, American cities are constantly growing;
populations increase each year, and buildings mount higher and

world's first safe elevator, is today meeting the needs of the present
and planning to anticipate the requirements of the future.
