Gentlemen:
I'm a seafarer, and as such of course
travel quite a lot. Right now I am
in the Argentine, and am glad to say
that I can here purchase your beloved
Edgeworth Tobacco, of which I'm so
very fond.
It is indeed a pity that one can't
find this good smoke in every place of
the seven seas. While recently in
Germany, my home-country, I tried
in vain to come upon one of these little
blue tins. I'm not saying too much in
mentioning that I would outwalk that
famous mile, hunting up dear Edge
: worth. I dare say there is no other
tobacco like it, and am convinced that
' Edgeworth cannot be improved.
Let me know when you contemplate
ceasing to make Edgeworth so that I
may lay in a goodly store to last till
I'm seventy.
May Edgeworth never change!
I'll always remain
Sincerely yours,
Willie Schmekies
