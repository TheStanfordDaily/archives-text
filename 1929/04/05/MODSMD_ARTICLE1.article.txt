# CANADA TO SEND REPRESENTATION ON RUM TREATY
## Sinking of Rum Runner "I'm Alone" Made Subject of Representation With U.S. Reports From Ottawa Show Canadians Are Anxious to Discuss 1924 Rum Treaty 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 4. (JP)â€”Wore
from Ottawa that the Canadian gov
ernment had decided to make the
sinking of the Canadian rum runner
I'm Alone the subject of formal repre
sentation to the American government
was interpreted by unofficial and dip
lomatic circles here tonight as a move
on the part of the Canadians to bring
the anti-rum Smuggling treaty of 1924
up for formal discussion.
The treaty was made between the
United States and Great Britain and
is binding on Canada. A number of
divergent views are held by officials
of the two governments on just what
points the treaty covers and it had
been known for some time that both
the British and Canadian govern
ments, in conection with previous rum
running incidents, have been anxious
to discuss the divergent points with
the Americans.
Tonight State Department officials
said that so far the formal representa
tions have not been received by the
Department. The Canadian Legation
said that the only move it has made
in the case was the inquiry several
days ago by the Canadian minister,
Vincent Massey, for information re
garding the incident.
There has been an inclination dur
ing the past few days in some quar
ters in Washington to believe that the
Canadians might drop the case, hence
no move in the way of an apology or
steps to straighten out the tangle
were made by American authorities.
It is generally believed that the
Canadians are more interested in the
principles of the case with regard to
the treaty than they are with the
actual sinking.
The 1924 treaty, while giving cer
tain reciprocal rights to Great Britain
for co-operation against the rum
smugglers, is believed by the Cana
dians to have been of little recipro
cal value to them.
