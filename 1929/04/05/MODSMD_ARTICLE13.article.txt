# STANFORD AUDIENCE ACCLAIMS SPALDING IN A.S.S.U CONCERT
## 
### Adele Smith 
Power and authority of performance
characterized the concert of the
A.S.S.U. Series given last night by
Albert Spalding, famed violinist, in
the Pavilion.
Spalding's playing portrayed fine
understanding and sincerity of execu
tion; a majestic control rather than
passion in his presentation, exquisitely
finished technique; and at the begin
ning a certain air of restraint which
disappeared before the end of his per
formance.
The program was sufficiently varied
to display the wide range and beauty
of tone in his art as well as a subtle
and varied nuance. Spalding had that
rare ability to remain aloof from the
vigorous applause of the audience. He
was the true artist in losing all con
sciousness of his hearers in the con
centration upon the sublime expres
sion of his violin. In response to the
enthusiasm of the audience, Spalding
! gave several encores, including
; Urahm's "Cradle Song" and Beetlio
! ven's "Turkish March."
The next concert will be given by
| the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra on April 10.
