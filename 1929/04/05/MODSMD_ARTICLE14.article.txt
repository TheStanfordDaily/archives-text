# CARDS FAVORED IN DUAL CLASH WITH TROJANS HERE SATURDAY
## Six Worldâ€™s Records Will Be Threatened as Stanford and Southern California Athletes Contend for Pacific Coast Track, Field Championship in Stadium 
### 
WHE exact strength of tlie 1929 Templeton-coached Cardinal track and lleld
team will be revealed tomorrow when the Stanford men match spikes
with the University of Southern California Trojans in the Stadium at
2:30 p.m. to decide the Pacific Coast dual meet championship.
The Sons of Troy, beaten for two years by the undefeated Card track men,
1.C.4-A. champions in 1927 and 1928, are invading the Farm with the strongest
aggregation of stars developed in the South in several years, and Stanford's

supremacy in Coast and National col
legiate track will be seriously chal
lenged.
Coach Dink Templeton has a great
point-scoring machine, and because of
the Cards' power In the field events
Stanford is doped to win by a margin
of from ten to fifteen points. However,
the visitors have potential winners
entered in almost every event, and
the outcome of the meet will be un
certain until the last point has been
chalked up for Card or Trojan.
It will be a meet of champions, and
world's records in at least six events
will be threatened. First, of course,
is Eric Krenz, world's discus cham
pion, to attempt to break his own rec
ord in this event and set a new one
in the shot. The shot put, with Krenz
and Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, contending for first honors,
should result in some noteworthy per
formances.
Ward Edmonds of Stanford and
Jack Williams of U.S.C., two of the
greatest vaulters in the country, have
had little trouble this year in clear
ing 13 ft. 6 in. and will in all likeli
hood attempt to go over the bar at
14 ft. 2 in. for a new world record.
Then comes Captain Charlie Borah
in the sprints. This curly-headed Tro
jan runner has equalled the world's
record of 9.6 s. in the century on a
number of occasions and raced tho
furlong in under 21 s. Hec Dyer, Card
sophomore flash, will push him to the
limit in both of the short distances.
Lauritzen of Stanford and Maurer
and Wehner of U.S.C. must be reck
oned with in both races.
The other world's mark which will
be threatened is that for the 120-yard
high hurdles. Captain Ross Nichols,
pressed by Webber of the Trojans
and Edmonds and Smith of Stanford,
should break 15 s. and perhaps equal
the world's record of 14 s.
For a dual meet there will be some
exceptionally fine races tomorrow,
especially in the quarter-mile be
tween Johnny Morrison of Stanford
and Vic Williams of U.S.C. Williams
is said to be able to run the single
lap under 49 s., and Morrison has
proven already this season that he can
do so. Shove and Syer will fight it
out for third place with Bastajian,
Williams' teammate.
Alex McKinnon, veteran Card miler,
and John Parker will match strides
with Fitzmaurice and Swede of the
Southerners. Comparative times of
these men are about the same, so this
should develop an exciting four-cor
nered battle.
Gloege and Schurr seem to have the
edge in the 880 over Neikirk and
French of Stanford, although the lat
tei two have turned in some good
times this year and are certain to put
up a fight for the places.
The low hurdles will pit Captain
Ross Nichols, Edmonds, and Nelson
against Ernie Payne and Webber,
Southern California barrier men.
Payne ran a 24 s. race last week, and
all three of the Cards are capable of'
equally fast time. The result is a!
toss-up.
In the two-mile, Bob Brown, Card
sophomore, will have a tough time of
it beating the veteran Trojan eight
lap men, Woodruff, and Bob Swede.
The shot, discus, and javelin will
probably be pretty much all Stanford.
Krenz, Rothert, and Forster will take
care of the shot; and McLeod and
Tandy will join with Krenz in the
discus. Kibby, Sparling, and Perelli-
Minetti have all done better than 190
feet in the javelin, while Mortenson,
Cromwell's best man, has not ex
ceeded 189 feet.
Hill of U.S.C. is evenly matched
with West, Dowell, and Anderson of
Stanford in the broad jump, all four
being consistent at 23 feet.
Both teams are weak in the high
jump, Madison and French of the
Cards, and Bowen and Tintinger of
U.S.C., all doing about 5 ft. 11 in.
The mile relay promises to be a
great race, the four quarter-milers on
each team being able to run the 440
in 50 s. or better. The probable Stan
ford team will be composed of Shove,
Syer, McDermott, and Morrison, and
the U.S.C. team of Williams, McFad

; den, Bastajian, and Borah.
The four Cards who were in the
hospital Wednesday were released
! yesterday and appear to he in good
' condition for the encounter with the
Trojans. John Lauritzen was taken
to the hospital with a slight cold yes
' terday hut will be in shape for tomor
row's meet, according to the attend
ing physician.
Admission for students will be fifty
! cents with student body cards, and
all others will be charged one dollar.
I Although the meet is scheduled for
j 2:30, the javelin will be begun at 2:15.
