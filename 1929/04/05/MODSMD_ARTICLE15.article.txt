# VARSITY NINE OPENS U.C. SERIES ON HOME DIAMOND TOMORROW
## Ralph Cook May Be Out Of Lineup; Card Chucker Not Yet Named 
### 
The California Bears, leaders of the
California Intercollegiate Baseball
League, and Stanford's varsity baseball
team will meet here tomorrow afternoon
at 3:15 on the varsity diamond in the
first of the annual three-game series. By
virtue of their 7 to 6 defeat of Santa
Clara Wednesday, the Bears are in un
disputed lead of the College League,
wliile the Cards are hopelessly in the
rear.
Coach Harry Wolter has not yet cho
sen a pitcher to work against the U.C.
nine. Perry Taylor and Bill Simkins
looked good on the southern trip, and
Wolter's choice will probably lie between
these two. Both Taylor and Simkins are
fast ball chuckers and are capable of
pitching a good game. Spud Hardy will
work behind the plate if an injury he
sustained last week is healed sufficiently.
Cook Ineligible
Ralph Cook, star first baseman, may
be ineligible to play against the Bears.
If Cook is unable to work tomorrow, the
Card infield will be minus the services of
one of the most dependable men on the
squad, as well as the clean-up hitter.
Wright, Meare, and Teague are fair
around the initial sack, but none of them
can approach Cook in cither fielding or
hitting. Churchill, Johnson, and Laird
are the other starting infielders.
Captain Frank Wilton and John Hun
ken are sure to start in the outfield, but
the third man has not yet been named.
Harry Berg may, play in right field, as
he is one of the most dependable hitters
on the team.
Bear Pitcher Good
Norm Horner, sophomore pitching ace,
will start on the mound for the Bears,
with Wyatt working behind the log.
Horner is the headiest chucker in the
League, and has fine control as a main
stay. Coach Carl Zamloch has eight left
handed batters in his outfit this season
who will be hard on the right-handed
pitchers.
Besides winning the coveted series, the
Stanford nine has a chance to knock the
Bears out of first place in the League.
California is ahead by a mere half-game,
and a pair of defeats would ruin its
chances to carry off the title. Two wins
for the Cards would pull them out of the
cellar position and perhaps even into
fourth place. There is a game apiece to
lie played yet with U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
here.
