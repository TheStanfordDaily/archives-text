"After a five-minute clinical examina
tion, we arc able to rate a student for,:
reading ability practically as well as can
the tcachcr after months of observation."
Dr. Walter R. Miles, professor of ex
perimental psychology, was explaining
the new "peep-hole" method of cxatnin- '
ing the reading processes of students. Dr.
Miles and David Segel, a graduate stu
dent in psychology here, recently com- j
! pleted some experiments on (lie new :
| method.
"Several methods have been used for
| observing eye movements," said Dr.
I Miles. "One is the mirror method, in
} which a mirror is clamped on the head
j near one eye, and tlie movements arc
observed from the back. Another meth
od is to clamp tlie head in a frame and
record the movements of the eyes by
means of direct observation or with a

I camera focused on the face. Both these !
| methods are distracting, and the head
: must he in an unnatural position.
Allow Natural Reading
"We developed the peephole method |
I to avoid the weaknesses of the other sys-1
: terns mentioned, in an attempt to allow I
! the person examined to read naturally J
! and without any distracting stimuli to!
j command his attention. We use a page!
; of standardized reading material, and
j observe the reader through a small open-
I ing cut in the center of the page. In this
manner, we are able to observe both j
[eyes and to make a careful study of the
mechanics of the reading process. If we
; wish to make photographic records of |
! the observations, a camera is substituted |
for the eye at the peephole, and as the
| whole face of the reader is visible at the j
hole, it is unnecessary to focus the cam
era during the reading of the material.
"In reading, the eyes must make brief j
pauses as they go across the page. It is j
impossible to read with a sweeping mo
[ tion of the eyes if all the words are really
| observed. Only a few words may be j
comprehended at a time—the reader gets I
an "eyeful" and absorbs it—then the eyes ;
must jump over a few spaces for another
"eyeful." In the peephole method, we
observe how many of these pauses are j
necessary per line, whether or not the j
reader must make regressive pauses, that '
is, go back to read the material over in !
order to grasp the meaning. We are also i
able to see whether or not there are >
intervals of confusion when no reading
is being done.
Note Wasted Movements
"We observe how much the student |
must bat the eyes, and we find how the !
eyes are co-ordinating. Often the eyes
are slightly crossed and the disability is
I hard to detect without some such device ;
|as this. Another important observation
j is the amount of head movement that is |
! substituted for the eye movement. The ]
! observer notes lip movements and whis
! pering or vocalizing. Lip and head move
i ments are flagrant signs of poor reading. |
"Reading aloud has not always been i
considered a fault," continued Dr. Miles.!
"St. Augustine, who lived about 400!
A.D., mentions silent reading as a phe
nomenon. We may assume that reading
| was a vocal process prior to the time of
| St. Augustine, but that silent reading was
I probably brought in by the monks to
I facilitate meditation in the monasteries.
Actual Tests Made
Dr. Miles and Segel gave their clinical
i test to sixty school children who were
I all in the third grade. The experimenters
j found that the best readers were able to
j read the lines with an average of three
pauses to the line, while the poorer read
' ers required from six to nine pauses. It
was found that the best readers made no
regressive eye movements, no lip move
ments, and had practically no head move
ments. The poorer readers made consid
! erable head movements, whispered, and
| were observed making a number of re-
I gressive pauses.
j In speaking of the value of the new
| method, Dr. Miles said, "Reading is so
j important today that the earlier the
| teacher detects faulty form in reading,
j the better. I believe that the principal
j value of this method of observing the
| reader from the center of the page read
' is that it samples the normal reading ac
tivity of the patient, and readily gives a
j basis for undertaking individual correc
j tive exercises and instruction."

I Miles. "One is the mirror method, in
} which a mirror is clamped on the head
j near one eye, and tlie movements arc
observed from the back. Another meth
od is to clamp tlie head in a frame and
record the movements of the eyes by

"We developed the peephole method |
I to avoid the weaknesses of the other sys-1
: terns mentioned, in an attempt to allow I
! the person examined to read naturally J
! and without any distracting stimuli to!
j command his attention. We use a page!
; of standardized reading material, and
j observe the reader through a small open-
I ing cut in the center of the page. In this
manner, we are able to observe both j
[eyes and to make a careful study of the
mechanics of the reading process. If we
; wish to make photographic records of |
! the observations, a camera is substituted |
for the eye at the peephole, and as the
| whole face of the reader is visible at the j
hole, it is unnecessary to focus the cam
era during the reading of the material.
"In reading, the eyes must make brief j
pauses as they go across the page. It is j
impossible to read with a sweeping mo
[ tion of the eyes if all the words are really
| observed. Only a few words may be j
comprehended at a time—the reader gets I
an "eyeful" and absorbs it—then the eyes ;
must jump over a few spaces for another
"eyeful." In the peephole method, we
observe how many of these pauses are j
necessary per line, whether or not the j
reader must make regressive pauses, that '

} which a mirror is clamped on the head
j near one eye, and tlie movements arc
observed from the back. Another meth
od is to clamp tlie head in a frame and
record the movements of the eyes by
means of direct observation or with a

I camera focused on the face. Both these !
| methods are distracting, and the head
: must he in an unnatural position.
Allow Natural Reading
"We developed the peephole method |
I to avoid the weaknesses of the other sys-1
: terns mentioned, in an attempt to allow I
! the person examined to read naturally J
! and without any distracting stimuli to!
j command his attention. We use a page!
; of standardized reading material, and
j observe the reader through a small open-
I ing cut in the center of the page. In this
manner, we are able to observe both j
[eyes and to make a careful study of the
mechanics of the reading process. If we
; wish to make photographic records of |
! the observations, a camera is substituted |
for the eye at the peephole, and as the
| whole face of the reader is visible at the j
hole, it is unnecessary to focus the cam
era during the reading of the material.
"In reading, the eyes must make brief j
pauses as they go across the page. It is j
impossible to read with a sweeping mo
[ tion of the eyes if all the words are really
| observed. Only a few words may be j
comprehended at a time—the reader gets I
an "eyeful" and absorbs it—then the eyes ;
must jump over a few spaces for another
"eyeful." In the peephole method, we
observe how many of these pauses are j
necessary per line, whether or not the j
reader must make regressive pauses, that '
is, go back to read the material over in !
order to grasp the meaning. We are also i
able to see whether or not there are >
intervals of confusion when no reading
is being done.
Note Wasted Movements
"We observe how much the student |
must bat the eyes, and we find how the !
eyes are co-ordinating. Often the eyes
are slightly crossed and the disability is
I hard to detect without some such device ;
|as this. Another important observation
j is the amount of head movement that is |
! substituted for the eye movement. The ]
! observer notes lip movements and whis
! pering or vocalizing. Lip and head move
i ments are flagrant signs of poor reading. |
"Reading aloud has not always been i
considered a fault," continued Dr. Miles.!
"St. Augustine, who lived about 400!
A.D., mentions silent reading as a phe
nomenon. We may assume that reading
| was a vocal process prior to the time of

Actual Tests Made
Dr. Miles and Segel gave their clinical
i test to sixty school children who were
I all in the third grade. The experimenters
j found that the best readers were able to
j read the lines with an average of three
pauses to the line, while the poorer read
' ers required from six to nine pauses. It
was found that the best readers made no
regressive eye movements, no lip move
ments, and had practically no head move
ments. The poorer readers made consid
! erable head movements, whispered, and
| were observed making a number of re-
I gressive pauses.
j In speaking of the value of the new
| method, Dr. Miles said, "Reading is so
j important today that the earlier the
| teacher detects faulty form in reading,
j the better. I believe that the principal
j value of this method of observing the
| reader from the center of the page read
' is that it samples the normal reading ac
tivity of the patient, and readily gives a
j basis for undertaking individual correc
j tive exercises and instruction."
