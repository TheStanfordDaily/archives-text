# The 						Possible High School Row

Secondary school fraternities under faculty supervision is the aim of
the bill passed by the lower house of the state legislature and now before
the senate. Since the passage of the law prohibiting high school fraterni
ties in 1909, that law lias been much of a farce. Its enforcement trained
the high school students, who were members, to be deceitful and to play
the hypocrite. And as well its enforcement was ineffectual.
Concerning the matter the Daily Califorjiian says, "A sidelight of the
legislative act —not without its point —is that the high school principals
who opposed the measure admitted that there now exist more fraternities
than ever. Like their kinsmen enforcing Prohibition, it seems that the
education reformers never give up hope. But the satisfactory side of the
whole issue is that if the senate approves the new law, thousands of high
school students each will swear to one less untruth annually, and perhaps
the world will be spared a few excess hypocrites."
Looking a bit farther and comparing this change with the movement
of other university customs and activities to the high school, it would
appear that the legalization of the fraternity in the secondary school will
tend to tarnish a bit the shiny splendor of the collegiate brass to the eye
of the entering student.
No sooner does a thing become popular and customary in a university
than it is immediately copied by the students in secondary schools. \\ ith
the high school student in possession of the university custom, that same
custom becomes much less desirable in the eyes of the university man.
A prediction cannot be made but if high schools adopt the fraternity
openly, the university fraternity will have to look to its standing, for the
fraternity will have become "high school."
