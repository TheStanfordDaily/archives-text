# Golden Bear Scalpers
## 
### 
The Golden Bear lias had too many scalping* to stand for it longer.
So it is that it has set about to mete out a system of punishment to those
who would scalp.
Loss of Big Game ticket privileges for periods ranging from one to
ten years are penalties given offenders. Alumni will take the gaff and
suffer the most. More leniency is shown to students. And burden of all
burdens, alumni offenders must remain in good standing by paying their
dues while undergoing the penalty.
This system, at that, is more lenient than the one used here. Stanford
scalpers lose their ticket rights for good and are thus blacklisted. Several
instances of students being expelled for scalping are on the books.
The temptation to the impoverished student, or the student just hard
up because of Big Game impending, is very great. For this reason if no
other, the penalty for scalping should be made severe to provide a satis
factorily strong enough deterrent to the about-to-be-scalper. Anyway it
is looked at, the practice is a grossly unfair one.
