# A 						Generous Benefactor
## 
### 
The New Theatre for Stanford Movement has found a new bene
factor. No, not quite a new one; a previous gift disqualifies this standing.
However it lias found a most generous one. Mrs. Louis Stern of Menlo
Park donated a thousand dollars to the fund. Her previous gift was that
of one hundred dollars given at the end of last quarter.
Mrs. Sterns' generosity is motivated alone by a desire to help dra
matics at Stanford. She is not connected with the University in any way.
Her action should pave the way for others outside the University who
find dramatics here a worthwhile enterprise and who hope to see it housed
soon in a new and fitting home.
Those who hold the movement close to their heart are deeply grateful
to Mrs. Stern for her kind gift and her keen interest in their work. The
Daily joins with these in thanking her.
