The Wishing Well. Curran Theater.
This is a delightful, charming
comedy that is in its last two weeks in
San Francisco. I don't know exactly
what is meant by an "operatic comedy,"
but "The Wishing Well" is a cross be
tween an operetta and an American mu
sical comedy. There is the dancing and
action of a musical show, with the lyrical,
tuneful music of a good operetta. Also,
Gilbert and Sullivan influence is in evi
dence.
After seeing so many short, pudgy,
shrill-voiced women as leads in the aver
age musical comedy, it is a distinct pleas
ure to see Harriet Bennet—a beautiful
woman with a pleasing and able voice.
And the male lead, too, is good, regard
less of his name—Reginald Dandy. His
acting is natural and easy, his voice is
smooth and rich, and he is really quite
nice looking.
But those English chorus girls! They
would make any man want to go to bally
old London. The American chorus seems
to stress the display of female flesh, but
the English chorus (if this is a typical
example) emphasizes female curves with
out using especially scant costumes.
The music in "The Wishing Well" is
not the kind that sends you home hum
ming and runs through your head for a
week afterward, but it is music that you
will thoroughly enjoy every minute of
the performance.
And there is some chuckly good com
edy. Sawney Potts, the village half-wit,
is the best comedian we've seen in a
long time. Wait til you hear him sing his
patter songs, and do a spring dance—he
is funny enough to be King of the
Masque Ball.
While talking of comedy, consider the
part of "Ferdie" Brierly, played by Basil
Radford. It is the "silly old ass" sort of

thing and he plays it jolly well. He gets
a big hand fur a drunk scene in the
second act that is a fine piece of work.
"The Wishing Well" is English all the
way through, but you'll like it even if
you're a patriotic Irishman.
