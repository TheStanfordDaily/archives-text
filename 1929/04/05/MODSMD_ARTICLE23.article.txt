CURRAN. The Wishing Well. Re
viewed elsewhere. Well worth seeing.
GEARY. The Front Page. You
probably do not need any introduction to
this rowdy newspaper melodrama. It's
full of lightning fast action, good healthy
cussing, side-splitting humor—and under
neath the frothy surface are sharp jabs
at American society and prejudices. It
is close to being the "most talked of play
of the year," and I recommend it above
everything else that's been to San Fran
cisco this year.
COLUMBIA. Straight Through
the Door. The plot is rather weak, but
William Hodge is sure to make anything
he plays in entertaining. It's a mystery
comedy, with the accent on the comedy—
and William Hodge makes up for a lot
of useless chatter from the rest of the
cast.
ALCAZAR. Skidding. This amus
ing comedy by a Stanford woman is en
tertaining crowds here as well as in
New York. The plot is old stuff.
PRESIDENT. Spite Corner, an
other laughing comedy hit by Frank Cra
ven, has recently opened. I quite frankly
don't know what it is all about, except
that it is starring Viola Dana and Percy
Pollock.
GREEN STREET. Easy for Zee
Zee. I have been informed by reliable
authorities that this is going on until
August. It is now in its thirty-first
week.
