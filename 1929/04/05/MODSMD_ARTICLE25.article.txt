# "STUDENT QUINCE" IS FEATURE OF THEATRE FOLLIES NEXT WEEK
## 
### John Rogers 
"The Student Quince," a musical
comedy burlesquing musical comedies,
will be one of the high spots in the
j "Theatre Fund Follies" next Thurs
j day night. This operetta, written by
I Burnell Gould, is an elaboration of
his Junior-Opera-in-miniature which
appeared in Chaparral early last
quarter. Besides the puns—which are
reported to be among the worst which
j Chappie has ever let loose upon an I
| ticket-sellers, Edwin Smith, dramatic
j several original songs, with lyrics by
! Gould, music by Bill Worthnigton and
his orchestra, chorus of eight by Mas- j
| quers, (and gowns by the Gotham :
i Shop).
Jeanette Owens and Fenton Bar
| rett, both of whom will be in the j
I Junior Opera next month, are included |
| in the cast of this burlesque. Other 1
dancing on the bill will be a clog!
j number by Boone and Boone (an lion
j est-to-goodness brother and sister j
act) who have brightened many a ;
: campus musical show in the past, and [
there will also be a waltz-tango by '
Kathleen Fitz ("Blues" singer super- '
lative) and Stanley Mullin (eminent!
, tragedian). Besides appearing in the |
"Follies," Frances Boone also has j
I charge of the chorus work.
Admission to the Benefit Vaudeville 1
next Thursday at 8 o'clock will be j
worked on the principle of "First j
j Come, First Served" —that is, those
i who stand in line longest will get the ;
; best seats, unless someone finds the j
! key to the stage door and gets in first.
| In order to avoid the mobbing of the j
unsuspecting campus there will be ;
manager, announces that seats will
be on sale next Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday from 8:30 to 5 o'clock i
in the Old Union. The lowest admis- |
j sion has been set at fifty cents —let i
| your conscience, if any, be your guide ;
; as to how much you will add to that
half dollar and thus contribute more
to the New Theater for Stanford Fund.
