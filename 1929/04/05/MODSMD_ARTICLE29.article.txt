# MARSHALL PAINTINGS TO BE DISPLAYED IN GALLERY THIS WEEK
## 
### 
One hundred California landscapes
by Frank H. Marshall, whose work is
out of the usual run of pictures, will
he on display at the Stanford Art Gal
lery until the end of the week.
The outstanding quality of the col
lection, which is composed of paint
ings of sketch-box size, is lovely color
harmony. Especially perfect is "Sun
and Shade in a Canyon," with its
charming brown and yellow chapar
ral; and the peculiarly beautiful
shades of purple contrasted with
cream in "Coachella Valley" produce
a glamorous combination of loneliness
and stillness in the desert. "Santa
Rosa Mountain" is painted in gray
tones with such perfection and at
tention to detail that at a distance, it
appears incredibly like a photograph.
All of these pictures have been
done by Mr. Marshall in the three
years since 1925, when he moved to
Palo Alto from the East. His favorite
sketching grounds are the deserts
and mountains of Southern California.
