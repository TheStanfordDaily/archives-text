# MINIONS' MONEY MAKES MASK MONARCH IN MERIDIAN MELEE
## 
### 
STANFORD'S KING will be chosen today!
High noon will be the signal for the last-minute voting for the Stanford
nuin whose head will be uneasy under the Cardinal crown on April 12 when
students emerge from their book-lined rooms to the merry frolics and
mysteries of the Masque Ball. It is rumored that even the Rally Committee
will be wearing long white beards to disguise itself.
Until noon today all votes will be made by ballot as usual. After that time,
due to a special arrangement between the royal Parliament of Stanford, the
Rally Committee, and the financial interests backing the many candidates
for the Farm's supreme position of jovial authority, votes will be auctioned
<S>off in blocks of 100 each as in last

year's contest.
Nelson "Gertie's" Carter, the "Snap
py Comeback King," yesterday pro
vided the most sensational thrill of
the election so far by springing from
dark obscurity into first position for
the merry monarch of Masks. Carter
is reported to be backed by the rub
ber trusts and is alleged to have been
dreaming wistfully of becoming a king
for several days. "I need more pull,"
he said modestly yesterday.
"Hard-hearted" Hanna finished the
day a close second to "Gertie's" Car
ter ,and it is said that, parodoxically
enough, the candidate with the stony
heart wept a bitter tear when he
found that strong backing was at
tempting to get "Gertie's" Carter the
Kingship. "Dravy Pete" Parkin, Wed
nesday's leader, came in a poor third
yesterday.
Except for the sudden rise of Car
ter the election moved rather slowly
yesterday. Election officials are look
ing for a good deal of activity in the
polls today as they came in contact
with a whispered rumor from Encina
that "Darkhorse Dauphin" had re
united his forces for the big push.
Results to date are as follows:
Votes
"Gertie's" Carter 1245
"Hard-hearted" Hanna 1241
"Dravy Pete" Parkin 1010
"Ears" Eddie 701
"Horseface" Mead 557
"Glad Rag" Doll 537
"Peeping Tom" Driscoll 297
"Mario J.T.W." Perelli-Minetti .... 252
