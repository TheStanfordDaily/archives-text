# SPORTS OF 1929
## Moe's Metamorphosis 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
The fact that a former Princeton
short-stop is now one of the White Sox
catchers is in itself interesting, but add
to that the facts that the young man in
question speaks seven languages and
studies international law during the win
ter months—then you've got something
really interesting. Morris Berg, who was
purchased from Reading—and what a
place for a studious guy like Berg to
play hall! —of the International League
in 1925, caught seventy-six games for the
Giicago South Side team last season,
although he once starred for the Tigers
of Old Nassau as a short-stop.
As for his mastery of the tongues of
the world, I have no doubt that he has
yet to find an umpire who understands
haif of the French, German, Italian, Rus

sian, Swedish, Sanskrit, or whatever it is
that Berg fires at him when disputing a
decision, let alone the Princetonian Eng
lish. Even studying law at Columbia
didn't keep Moe Berg from playing base
ball with Brooklyn in 1923, but whether
or not he materially aided the Giants in
winning the pennant that year I cannot
say.
At any rate, Moe landed in the Ameri
can Association, played in the Interna
tional League in 1925, and made such a
good record that the White Sox grabbed
him. There, near the Stock Yards, where
pigs are changed into sausages, they
changed Moe Berg into a catcher. Last
year he batted .2246 and fielded .990.
P.S.—He never misses a six-day bike
race.
