Offering a valuable service to Stan
ford graduates, the University Ap
pointment Office, under the direction
of Elizabeth B. Snell, operates a per
manent placement bureau and a de
pository for vocational records. Any
one who registers with the bureau
and keeps the office informed as to
(he work he is doing is automatically
given consideration for exceptional
positions in the particular Held for
which he is qualified.
Unless the positions open are ex
ceptional, only registrants reporting
themselves available for other work
are sent notifications. Records of all
applicants are filed according to the
field in which they are employed, or
desire to be employed, in order that
no one may be overlooked.
Records of graduates' academic
work together with recommendations
on file are kept by the appointment
office. Copies of transcripts and
recommendations are mailed to pros
pective employers when requested by
graduates registered with the office.
High-class clerical systems installed
by the appointment secretary make
possible a speedy answer to any de
mand for recommendations.
A charge of $5.00 is made by the
office to cover the cost of a life per
sonnel record which is permanently
filed in the Appointment Office. No
charge is made by the office at the
time placements into positions are
made.
Students desiring teaching posi
tions after graduation are especially
urged to register with the placement
bureau. During the year 1927-28 the
Stanford Appointment Office received
requests for applicants to fill 1060
teaching positions. The peak load for
these orders came in April, May, and
June.
Among the non-teaching positions,
226 orders were filed with the ap
pointment secretary. Fifty-six orders
were received for engineers, forty-six
demands for business positions, forty
five orders for office workers, and
thirty-two for salesmen.
The salaries earned by Stanford
men placed directly into positions last
year by the Appointment Office
amounted to $56,480; of the men
placed indirectly, $30,370; of the Stan
ford women placed directly, $13,440;
