# GRADUATE CHEMISTS HAVE GREAT FUTURE SAYS NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR
## 
### 
"Eastern industrial concerns are fac
ing a severe shortage of competent chem
ists," Frank C. Whitmore, head of the
chemistry department of Northwestern
University, said in an interview to the
Daily.
"Able chemical experts are in great
demand. For every Ph.D. graduated last
year from Northwestern chemistry de
partment, offers for at least four jobs
awaited. The initial salaries for these
men averaged from $225 to $330 a
month."
"Chemists of yesteryear were consid
ered foolish if they stayed at a university
after receiving their A.B. degree, but to
day a Ph.D. is necessary if a student de
sires a good industrial position. There
are hundreds of mediocre chemists, but
the students with advanced degrees are
the ones who land the excellent jobs."
In comparing the salary range of a
chemist having an A.B. and one with a
Ph.D., Whitmore said that the chemist

with an A.B. usually starts at $150 while
the Ph.D. man gets a salary of $225 or
more.
Professor Whitmore said that approxi
j mately ninety per cent of the Ph.D. grad
j uates enter industrial chemistry. "Indus
[ tries are searching for highly specialized
j men."
The increasing demand for chemists is
j due to the economic situation which today
j threatens the manufacturing states of the
j East. The exploitation of limitless natu
; ral resources is giving away to the care
j ftd development and refinement of every
| product and by-product, the Evanston
I chemist explained.
"Gold in the days of '49 was mined in
; California in a crude and wasteful way,
J but today it is carefully processed and
I even the 'tailings' arc put into use."
Professor Whitmore spent Wednesday
| afternoon visiting the Stanford chemistry
j department as guest of Professor E. C.
j Franklin, professor of organic chem
istry.
