### 
Although no official announcement has
been made, it is expected that Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, University President and
Secretary of the Interior, will be present
on the campus this spring to deliver the
commencement address to the Class of
1929.
"We hope to have Dr. Wilbur here in
June to make the commencement address,
but as yet no official announcement of the
plans have been made," said Acting Pres
ident R. E. Swain to a Daily representa
tive yesterday. "Dr. Wilbur will prob
ably be here at commencement time if
he can arrange to be absent from his
cabinet duties."
Before Dr. Wilbur left for Washing
ton, D.C., he expressed a desire to attend
the 1929 commencement exercises.
Dr. Wilbur is away from the Univer
sity at the present time on a leave of
absence which was granted to him by the
Board of Trustees so that he could ac
cept the position of Secretary of the
Interior in the Hoover cabinet.
