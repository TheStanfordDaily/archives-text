FEAST WELL
Not in many moons has Stanford
been dished to such a sports feast
as is being cooked up for this 1
week-end. All together there are
nine different athletic events
scheduled to take place on the
; campus today and tomorrow.
Dink Templeton will assume the role
of master chef tomorrow afternoon and ;
will try and cook Southern California's ;
goose to perfection. There is no doubt
, that the Stanford-U.S.C. track meet is
j the main course on the menu. With four
j sick men in the hosi: tal at one time,
! Stanford's chances did not look so good l
and the sports writers bally-hooed long '
j and loudly about the slim chances the!
' Cards had to win.
Personally we have cast our lot with
Dink who is rather optimistic over the
outcome of the contest. The four stars
who went to the hospital, namely Cap-
I tain Nichols, Eric Krenz, Hec Dyer, and
Ward Edmonds, were released yesterday
and will enter the meet in fairly good
physical shape. Dink has a reason for
his optimism and the Cards should count
their fourth straight victory over the
Trojan trackmen.
Every event in the clash will
; bear watching. Then there is the
; additional thrill that six world's
I records may be equaled or broken,
j Krenz and Rothert in the shot may
i do surprising things. In the discus,
Krenz will have to get a heavy
heave to better his own world's
mark. Borah, Trojan running ace,
is looking hungrily at the 100-yard
and 220-yard marks. Edmonds and
Williams in the pole-vault should
i put on a show that will keep fans
j talking for some time to come.
! Williams has made 13 feet 6 in
ches in almost every meet this sea
son. Edmonds is not so slow him
self. With good luck Nichols may
clear the high sticks in record
time. There should be plenty of
thrills and "frills" for everyone,
with warm spring weather.
Immediately after the track meet there
is the Stanford-California baseball game.
The Cards, who now hold the cellar po
sition in the conference league, will be
facing a superior team in the Bears.
They have one advantage, however, as
the signature of Coach Harry Wolter is
on every conference baseball because Mr.
Wolter is president of said league. With
this little remainder and a little more
spit on the ball, tine Stanford pitchers
should not be so wild.
Although the major sports will
be the main attractions, the annual

Spring Sports Carnival will offer
unusual interest- Competing with
the members of the Southern Di
vision of the Pacific Coast confer
ence, Stanford will enter teams in
diving, swimming, water polo, fenc
ing, and gymnastic events. Golf,
tennis, and boxing are slated at
various places away from the cam
pus.
For those who have never seen a fenc
ing meet or water polo contest, right now
is the best opportunity to see highly de
veloped competing teams in these events.
It is hoped that a lot of interest will lie
taken in the minor sports. The men who
go out for them deserve as much of a
hand as do the major sport athletes.
It will be a sporting week-end, if
it doesn't rain.

i put on a show that will keep fans
j talking for some time to come.
! Williams has made 13 feet 6 in
ches in almost every meet this sea
son. Edmonds is not so slow him
self. With good luck Nichols may
clear the high sticks in record
time. There should be plenty of
thrills and "frills" for everyone,
with warm spring weather.
Immediately after the track meet there
is the Stanford-California baseball game.
The Cards, who now hold the cellar po
sition in the conference league, will be
facing a superior team in the Bears.
They have one advantage, however, as
the signature of Coach Harry Wolter is
on every conference baseball because Mr.
Wolter is president of said league. With
this little remainder and a little more
spit on the ball, tine Stanford pitchers
should not be so wild.
Although the major sports will
be the main attractions, the annual

Spring Sports Carnival will offer
unusual interest- Competing with
the members of the Southern Di
vision of the Pacific Coast confer
ence, Stanford will enter teams in
diving, swimming, water polo, fenc
ing, and gymnastic events. Golf,
tennis, and boxing are slated at
various places away from the cam
pus.
For those who have never seen a fenc
ing meet or water polo contest, right now
is the best opportunity to see highly de
veloped competing teams in these events.
It is hoped that a lot of interest will lie
taken in the minor sports. The men who
go out for them deserve as much of a
hand as do the major sport athletes.
It will be a sporting week-end, if
it doesn't rain.

OAKLAND, April 4. (/P)With the
time for the regatta less than two
weeks off, Ky Ebright, California
crew coach, matched the Washington
training schedule today by ordering
two workouts daily on the estuary for
his men. The personnel of the Cali
fornia varsity is fairly definitely set
tled now, with seven men who rowed
the Bears to a world's crew champion
ship seated in their accustomed places.
FEAST WELL
Not in many moons has Stanford
been dished to such a sports feast
as is being cooked up for this 1
week-end. All together there are
nine different athletic events
scheduled to take place on the
; campus today and tomorrow.
Dink Templeton will assume the role
of master chef tomorrow afternoon and ;
will try and cook Southern California's ;
goose to perfection. There is no doubt
, that the Stanford-U.S.C. track meet is
j the main course on the menu. With four
j sick men in the hosi: tal at one time,
! Stanford's chances did not look so good l
and the sports writers bally-hooed long '
j and loudly about the slim chances the!
' Cards had to win.
Personally we have cast our lot with
Dink who is rather optimistic over the
outcome of the contest. The four stars
who went to the hospital, namely Cap-
I tain Nichols, Eric Krenz, Hec Dyer, and
Ward Edmonds, were released yesterday
and will enter the meet in fairly good
physical shape. Dink has a reason for
his optimism and the Cards should count
their fourth straight victory over the
Trojan trackmen.
Every event in the clash will
; bear watching. Then there is the
; additional thrill that six world's
I records may be equaled or broken,
j Krenz and Rothert in the shot may
i do surprising things. In the discus,
Krenz will have to get a heavy
heave to better his own world's
mark. Borah, Trojan running ace,
is looking hungrily at the 100-yard
and 220-yard marks. Edmonds and
Williams in the pole-vault should
i put on a show that will keep fans
j talking for some time to come.
