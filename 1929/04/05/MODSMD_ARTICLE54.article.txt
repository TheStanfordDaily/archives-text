# Cardinal Swimmers Hope For Win In Today's Tilt
## 
### 
Opposed by three strong swimming
teams, the Cardinal mermen will attempt
to splash to victory in the minor sports !
carnival this afternoon. Swimmers from j
California, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A. will line |
up against the Cards in Encina pool at j
2 o'clock.
From U.S.C. will come a well-balanced :
squad coached by Fred Cady of the Los !
Angeles Athlctic Club. The outstanding I
man upon whom Cady has demonstrated j
his ability is Bela Kendall, who stars in !
free-style races and in the back-stroke j
event. Against him in the latter race i
Stanford has Ogden Driggs who has j
shown his speed before. Pressed by Ken- j
dall he may lower the Pacific Coast rec
ord.
The foremost entrant from the other i
southern school, U.C.L.A., is Brownie!
Davis, diver of stellar potentiality. He is j
a real threat for Throndson and has i
given him exciting competition on pre- I
vious occasions.
California tried her best to win over
the Redshirts in the dual meet last quar- I
ter—and failed. This may be an indica- j
tion of the relative danger from that
source, but scores in dual meets and
scores in general meets have a queer I
habit of contradicting each other. Led i
by Rader and Ducato, the trans-bay pad- j
dlers will make a strong attempt to re- j
verse the former score.
With Whitey Burns nicking the breast
stroke record almost every time he enters j
the water, swimming fans are looking to I
him to shave the coast time some more, j
I f there are no heats he may do this, j
Reggy Harrison has a good chance to I
do the same thing in the 50-yard sprint. '
And in the 440-yard contest, right after
the dash, Barret Brown may slice an- j
other record. Brown swims best in hot!
competition, and Simmons of U.S.C. is ;
expected to provide some of that.
The probable Stanford line-up follows: I
Relay—Barret Brown, Ogden Driggs,
Hadley Bramel, Reggy Harrison or Dick !
Lucy.
200-yard breast-stroke—Whitey Burns, !
Bill Cundall.
50-yard free-style — Reggy Harrison,
Dave Morey.
440-yard free-style — Barret Brown,
Fred Hunt.
150-yard back-stroke — Ogden Driggs, 1

Diving—Ed Throndson, Herb Marsh.
Aiedley relay—Ogden Driggs, Whitey

scores in general meets have a queer I
habit of contradicting each other. Led i
by Rader and Ducato, the trans-bay pad- j
dlers will make a strong attempt to re- j
verse the former score.
With Whitey Burns nicking the breast
stroke record almost every time he enters j
the water, swimming fans are looking to I
him to shave the coast time some more, j
I f there are no heats he may do this, j
Reggy Harrison has a good chance to I
do the same thing in the 50-yard sprint. '
And in the 440-yard contest, right after
the dash, Barret Brown may slice an- j
other record. Brown swims best in hot!
competition, and Simmons of U.S.C. is ;
expected to provide some of that.
The probable Stanford line-up follows: I
Relay—Barret Brown, Ogden Driggs,
Hadley Bramel, Reggy Harrison or Dick !
Lucy.
200-yard breast-stroke—Whitey Burns, !
Bill Cundall.
50-yard free-style — Reggy Harrison,
Dave Morey.
440-yard free-style — Barret Brown,
Fred Hunt.
150-yard back-stroke — Ogden Driggs, 1
Sandy Smith.
100-yard free-style — Hadley Bramel,
Dick Lucy.
Diving—Ed Throndson, Herb Marsh.
Aiedley relay—Ogden Driggs, Whitey

Opposed by three strong swimming
teams, the Cardinal mermen will attempt
to splash to victory in the minor sports !
carnival this afternoon. Swimmers from j
California, U.S.C., and U.C.L.A. will line |
up against the Cards in Encina pool at j
2 o'clock.
From U.S.C. will come a well-balanced :
squad coached by Fred Cady of the Los !
Angeles Athlctic Club. The outstanding I
man upon whom Cady has demonstrated j
his ability is Bela Kendall, who stars in !
free-style races and in the back-stroke j
event. Against him in the latter race i
Stanford has Ogden Driggs who has j
shown his speed before. Pressed by Ken- j
dall he may lower the Pacific Coast rec
ord.
The foremost entrant from the other i
southern school, U.C.L.A., is Brownie!
Davis, diver of stellar potentiality. He is j
a real threat for Throndson and has i
given him exciting competition on pre- I
vious occasions.
California tried her best to win over
the Redshirts in the dual meet last quar- I
ter—and failed. This may be an indica- j
tion of the relative danger from that
source, but scores in dual meets and
scores in general meets have a queer I
