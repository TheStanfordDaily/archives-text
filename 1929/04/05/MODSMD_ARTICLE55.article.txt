# Card Golf Men Tee Off Today at Pebble Beach
## 
### 
j The six golfers who will represent
j Stanford on the Pebble Beach links to
| day and tomorrow as a part of the an
| nual Minor Sports Carnival with Cali
; fornia, Southern California, and the Uni
j versity of California at Los Angeles will
I tee off this morning as favorites to come
J out on top.
The Cardinal divot-diggers defeated
! California by a large margin, and twice
I took the Los Angeles Bruins into camp.
! And judging by the showing of the Card
I players in the California intercollegiates,
I even though one Southern California man
! came out on top, Stanford should be
! able to defeat the Trojan team.
Stanford's probable margin would be
j considerably greater if Ward Edmonds,
j captain and number one man, and George
j Kachlein, number three player, were to
: compete today. Edmonds will be saving
! himself for the three events in which he
; will perform in tomorrow's track meet
with Southern California. Kachlein has
j broken a bone in his hand and will be
| unable to swing a club for some time.
! There will be no singles matches in the
| Carnival competition. The twosomes who
| will represent Stanford will be: Warner
Edmonds and Larry Staley; Warren
Johnson and Richie Stevenson; and
| Homer Burnaby and Bill Sott. Ken
j White will play in Staley's place tomor
j row, when the latter will return to the
j campus for a varsity baseball game.
