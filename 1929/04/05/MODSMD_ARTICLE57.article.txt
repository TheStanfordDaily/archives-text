# Sacramento Will Be Scene Of Championship Ring Bouts
## 
### 
All roads lead to Sacramento—in the
I eyes of amateur boxing fans—where the
| Far Western Conference ring champion
! ship will be fought tonight and tomor-
I row. Six western universities have en
tered teams in this one grand tournament.
The Cardinal delegation, although
: somewhat depleted by the loss of five
| veterans, arrived in the Capitol City last
, night, and Coach Harry Maloney expects
to put his men through a final light drill
i this morning. The preliminary bouts will
Ibe run off tonight. Semifinals and finals
I take place tomorrow.
| Vance Rogers, Stanford's scrappy
| featherweight, is favored to annex the
J title in his division. Rogers is easily the
i best collegiate featherweight in Califor
j ilia. The only other contender is Captain
: Dave Walker of the University of Wash
j ington squad. Both men have won de
cisions over Ed Nemir of U.C.
Captain-elect Ralph Malcom will have
his work cut out for him when he faces
! such boxers as Wilbur Kindig of Berke
ley and Keith Jones of Washington. Kin
; dig has won from Malcom and Jones
| from Kindig, but the Cardinal light
weight has shown great improvement in
J the last three weeks and may give the
j fans a surprise.
All Pacific Coast heavyweights are
rated on a par, and A1 "Red" Hamilton
j of Stanford is given an even chance with
the rest of them. Gordon "Slip" Gilbert,
light-heavyweight, will be forced to live
up to his nickname to win from veterans
like George Garner of U.C. and Captain
i Lewis Besbeck of U.C.L.A. Gilbert has
J had no intercollegiate experience, but
| won the novice light-heavyweight crown
j last fall.
j Paul Maurer is another Stanford fcath
j enveight entered in the tourney. Maurer
is an experienced fighter but has had an
erratic record. Many experts expect the
finals in the featherweight class to be an
all-Stanford affair—between Rogers and
Maurer. Harry Birch, another Cardinal
lightweight, is also an old hand in the
ring.
Foster Vierra of California Aggies is
i tavored to win the middleweight crown,
j His chief contender will be Dwight Grib
| ben of the Bears. Captain Frank Ribbel
lof Berkeley should successfully defend
his welterweight title and Merle Ans
berry of Berkeley is expected to win the
bantam championship. Stanford has no
I entrants in these three weights.
