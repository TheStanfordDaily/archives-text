# Water Polo Team Enters Eliminations As Favorites
## 
### 
The Cardinal water polo team which
will enter the elimination matches of the
minor sports tourney this afternoon at
3:30 o'clock shows promise of entering
the final round tomorrow at 2 o'clock.
Although the value of relative scores is
somewhat decreased by the fact that lo
cal practice was dropped during vacation,
a brief comparison reveals the strength
of the competing' teams.
After being defeated by Stanford,
Northwestern easily dropped U.C.L.A.,
7-4. U.S.C. was defeated by the strong
Hollywood A.C. squad, 4-3. The Bear
water poloists were vanquished last quar
ter by the same Card team which will
face them today, 9-2.
The probable Stanford line up is: Bob
Burns, If; Captain Reggy Harrison, cf;
Milt Burns, rf; Tru Parker, lb; Cal
Strong, cb; Ogden Driggs, rb; Nort
Thornton, g.
