# Presidential Handshaking Life Must Be Shortened
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 4. (/P) Word
went oat from the White House to
day to members of the House and
Senate that they must be more con
siderate in sending their constituents
to the executive mansion to march in
the semi-weekly presidential hand
| shaking line.
Yesterday 1775 people tiled through
the executive office and grasped
President Hoover's hand. The muscles
ox' the hand became so sore that he
: was able to write only with great
I difficulty for some time afterward
! and he l'elt also that the handshaking
had been a considerable strain upon
! him. Although the Secret Service
agents keep the line moving at high
i speed, about 43 to the minute on au
| average, yesterday's reception occu
pied nearly three-quarters of an hour
1 of the President's time.
