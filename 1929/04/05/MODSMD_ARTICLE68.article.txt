# YEARLING BALL TEAM TANGLES TOMORROW WITH BERKELEY CUBS
## Squads Are Evenly Matched; Caddel or McLean Will Hurl for Stanford 
### 
Two teams evenly matched in every '
department of the game will take the field t
tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock when
Stanford's freshman nine clashes with j
the California cubs at Berkeley in the [
first contest of the 1929 Little Series.
Both teams have won the majority of j
their games this season by comfortable 1
margins, and the reputed strength, both j
offensive and defensive, is closely bal
anced. Aside from one disabled regular
in each camp, the players arc all in fine
shape. Willie Marks, Card first-sackcr,
is limping around with a sprained ankle,
and Joe Smith, hard-hitting catcher for i
the Cal frosh, is handicapped with a sore !
throwing arm. In the event that Marks
will not be able to start, Fox, regular
fielder, will work at first base for Stan
ford. He has had considerable experience
in that position and has lots of pep and
fire. Because of his hitting ability, Smith :
will work in the outfield, if he doesn't !
catch. In that case, Bclk will receive for ]
California.
Coach Husky Hunt has not definitely
decided yet whether he will start Caddel
or McLean on the mound. Both arc first
class chuckers and can be counted on to
show the Cub batters plenty of stuff.
Dixon will start behind the plate, but
Evans will be ready should he be needed.
Dixon looked good against Fullerton J.C.
Wednesday.
Mailho, a left-handed chucker, will
start the game for Cal. Coach Brick
Mitchell believes that he has one of the
most promising pitchers in Mailho that
he has ever had. He has an effective de
livery, speed, and an assortment of curve
balls.
Following is the lineup:
McLean, Caddel p Mailho
Dixon c Belk
Marks lb Fi field
Barsumian 2b Evers
Kelly 3b Glaister
White ss Kintana
Griggs If Scheinmann
Rintala cf Kirwan
