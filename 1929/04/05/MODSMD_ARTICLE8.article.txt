Robinson-Johnston in the doubles.
Following are the present rankings
for the varsity and freshman squads:

After having defeated three of the
strongest college teams on the coast
by decisive scores without the ser
vices of her two highest ranking
players, Stanford's varsity tennis
team will face the crucial test of the
season in the four-cornered meet
which begins this morning at the
California Tennis Club in Berkeley.
Representing the Cardinal are John
Doog and Chuck Weesner, whose
eligibility this quarter doubles Stan
ford's chances for a victory, and Cap
tain Wheatley and Lawrence Hall,
who have been chiefly responsible for
the team's early-season successes.
The two doubles combinations will
be Doeg-Hall and Easton-Driscoll.
The other teams competing in the
meet are California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A. Comparative scores give
Stanford almost, a certain victory,
since the Cardinal racquet wielders
have already defeated U.S.C. by a
score of 5 to 0 and IT.C.L.A. 4 to 2.
California fell before U.C.L A. 5 to 1
and succeeded in coming off with a
3 to 3 tie in her match with U.S.C.

I year through the capable playing of
Alan Herrington and Ralph McEl-
I venny and with this year's first and
! second varsity positions filled by

■ position of supremacy for several

Tennis interest on the campus this
1 week-end will be centered on the
I freshman stars who meet the Lowell
High School squad tomorrow morn
j ing at 10 o'clock. The yearling team
I has not been as fortunate as the var
sity, Bancroft and Hickman, first and
third ranking players, being ineligible.
