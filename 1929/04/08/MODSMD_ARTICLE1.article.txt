# MEXICO FEDERAL ARMY EXPECTED TO GET PALOMAS
## American Cattle Interests Worried; U.S. Orders 18 Planes to Guard Border Revolutionary Leader Will Journey to Pulpeto Pass To Prevent Road Bombing 
### 
COLUMBUS, N.M., April 7. (/P)—
The southbound trains on the Mexi
can Northwestern railroad bearing
Escobar's confiscated automobiles,
gasoline, and foodstuffs, passed
through Guzman, Chihuahua, this
morning. Guzman is 35 miles from
Columbus.
The train was en route to Casa
Grandes from Juarez in the race Gen
eral Escobar is said to be endeavoring
to reach Pulpeto Pass before he is
cut off by General Calles.
PALOMAS, Chihuahua, April 7. (/P)
—Predictions here this afternoon
were that Palomas, which has been in
the hands of the rebels for nearly a
month, would be recovered by the
Mexican federal troops before tomor
row.
It was not determined whether the
rebels would surrender to the federal
forces from the American side of the
line or would flee southward to join
Escobar.
Twelve attack planes from Galves
ton en route to Naco preceded by six
observation planes from San Antonio
passed over this section on the Ameri
can side of the line this morning.
Americans who have cattle and
other interests in Chihuahua were
plainly worried today over the turn
of military events south of the bor
der. Escobar's plan of detraining on
the Mexican Northwestern railroad at
Casa Grandes is not becoming mani
fest, but it was reported here that the
revolutionary leader will probably
leave the railroad at Colonia-Dublan
and swing around by Janos, south of
the Corralitos ranch, in order to reach
Pulpeto Pass into Sonora.
It was reported here also today that
Escobar is bound south with all the
automobiles and supplies he could ob
tain in Juarez.
The strategy as viewed here re
volves upon speculation as to whether
Calles can bomb and block the road
to prevent Escobar's passage through
Pulpeto to Sonora. If Calles could
block his enemy it was believed that
the final military phase of the revolu
tion would develop north through the
Corralitos and Palomas Land and Cat
tle Company ranches. It is this pos
sibility which has caused the Ameri
can cattlemen of the region to fear
that their herds may be wiped out.

PALOMAS, Chihuahua, April 7. (/P)
—Predictions here this afternoon
were that Palomas, which has been in
the hands of the rebels for nearly a
month, would be recovered by the
Mexican federal troops before tomor
row.
It was not determined whether the
rebels would surrender to the federal
forces from the American side of the
line or would flee southward to join
Escobar.
Twelve attack planes from Galves
ton en route to Naco preceded by six
observation planes from San Antonio
passed over this section on the Ameri
can side of the line this morning.
Americans who have cattle and
other interests in Chihuahua were
plainly worried today over the turn
of military events south of the bor
der. Escobar's plan of detraining on
the Mexican Northwestern railroad at
Casa Grandes is not becoming mani
fest, but it was reported here that the
revolutionary leader will probably
leave the railroad at Colonia-Dublan
and swing around by Janos, south of
the Corralitos ranch, in order to reach
Pulpeto Pass into Sonora.
It was reported here also today that
Escobar is bound south with all the
automobiles and supplies he could ob
tain in Juarez.
The strategy as viewed here re
volves upon speculation as to whether
Calles can bomb and block the road
to prevent Escobar's passage through
Pulpeto to Sonora. If Calles could
block his enemy it was believed that
the final military phase of the revolu
tion would develop north through the
Corralitos and Palomas Land and Cat
tle Company ranches. It is this pos
sibility which has caused the Ameri
can cattlemen of the region to fear
that their herds may be wiped out.
