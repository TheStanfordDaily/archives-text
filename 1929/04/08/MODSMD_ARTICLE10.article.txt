# MONTANA MEETS CARD SQUAD IN DEBATE TONIGHT
## Abolition of Insanity Plea in Criminal Cases To Be Discussion Topic 
### 
Two members of the University of
Montana debating squad will arrive
on the campus this morning to par
ticipate in a match with a Stanford
team to be held in the Little Theatre
tonight at 8:15 p.m.
Abolition of the temporary insanity
plea in criminal cases will be the
topic for discussion, with Stanford
arguing for the retention of the status
quo. The Cardinal team was suddenly
changed last night with the shift of
George Bodle to another team which
will debate later in the season. W. L.
Shaw and probably Irving Rosenblatt
will present the negative case for
Stanford, announced Wheeler Barger,
assistant debate coach, in making the
change.
Montana will be represented by
Russell Smith, law student, present
student body manager, and veteran
of ten intercollegiate forensic con
tests, and Robert Williams, partici
pant in eleven debates and member
of the Montana team which toured
the East last year.
Rosenblatt of the Cardinal team
has bad considerable debating experi
ence and was a member of the Stan
ford squad which made a tour of
southern California during the recent
vacation. His speech before 900 Elks
in the contest with Loyola held in
the Los Angeles Elks Club drew
much applause from the audience.
Shaw's last appearance on the cam
pus was in the match with the Uni
versity of Washington last quarter on
the same topic. His part of the con
test was the cross-examination of the
constructive speaker of the Washing
ton team.
Wednesday evening the Montana
speakers debated a University of Ore
gon team at Eugene on the question,
â€¢"Resolved, That the jury system be
abolished." They presented the neg
ative side of the argument.
Ben Dunniway, graduate student in
the Law School and brother of John
Dunniway, former Stanford debater,
has consented to preside at the meet
ing tonight.
