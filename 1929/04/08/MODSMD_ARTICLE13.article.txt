# CARTER WILL PRESIDE OVER MASQUE BALL
## Newly Elected King Chooses Court; Queen Selected But Unannounced 
### 
Stretching the financial interests of
the Rubber Trust to its limit, Nelson
"Gertie" Carter was elected to the
office of Potentate of the Masque Ball
last Friday after a thrilling duel with
his rival "Hard-hearted" Hanna.
Only a hundred votes separated the
two candidates after the sixty-minute
rush hour which climaxed the elec
tion for King. The battle of dollars
and cents was fought out by the two
leaders, the others dropping along the
line as the duel went on. The expect
ed onslaught by the forces of "Dravy
Pete" Parkin did not materialize.
The first official act of the new
Sovereign was to name the Royal
retinue, whose members will play an
important part in the coronation cere
monies at the Ball. Those named are:
Parliament Rally Committee
Clown Prince Bob Keerl
Prime Minister Hal Conroy
Exchequer Temp Peck
Steward Bob Paine
Lord High Executioner....Fred Hubler
Secretary of Army and Navy
Dick Holt
Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Frank Baker
Secretary of Home Affairs....Mel Jones
Imperial Kleagle A1 Esberg
Pages—Weenie Norman, Dick Gug
genhime
Butlers —Ford Harris, George Pascoe
Guards —Fletcher Dutton, Ken Dow
Although his Royal Highness has
selected the Queen, her name will not
be divulged until Parliament puts the
stamp of official sanction upon the
selection.
Meanwhile ducats for Friday's cere
monies are becoming scarcer and
scarcer. Parliament suggests that
those who plan to attend the royal
function obtain bids immediately and
avoid the last-minute rush. These
ruay be obtained now at the A.S.S.U.
offices in the Old Union.
Announcement was also made yes
terday that all those who enter the
palace on the night of the Masque
Ball must be in costume. One of San
Francisco's leading costumers will be
located on the campus during the next
few days so that everyone will be
given ample opportunity to obtain
some sort of paraphernalia. Their lo
cation and business hours will be an
nounced in tomorrow's Daily.
