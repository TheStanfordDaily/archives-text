# EDMONDS, M'KINNON TURN BUCK THREAT OF MIGHTY S. C. TEAM
## Pair of Fighting Card Veterans Score Twenty-One Points to Decide Victory; Templeton's Tracksters Aggregate Lead Averting First Conference Defeat in Three Years 
### BY FRANK WHITELEY 
Ward Edmonds and Alex McKinnon were Stanford's two "iron men" Satur
day, and it was the twenty-one points scored by this pair of fighting Card
veterans that turned back the mighty threat of the University of Southern
California track men and decided in Stanford's favor, 74 to 57, one of the
most thrilling dual meets ever held in the Stadium.
The Trojans had a powerful team, even stronger than the score indicates;
and Stanford supporters are still apt to have nervous tremors as they realize
how close the Cardinal champions came to suffering their first college defeat
in three years. It was only through the efforts of Edmonds and McKinnon
that such a defeat was averted. The Stanford fight, about wkich old grads

like so well to reminisce, was splen
didly illustrated in the competitive
spirit displayed by these two seniors.
McKinnon started the day off right
for the Cards with a victory in the
mile. Trailing the pace setters, Parker
and Gooden of Stanford and Swede
of U.S.C., for the first three laps, Mc-
Kinnon opened up with a driving
sprint on the last turn to overtake
Swede and Fitzmaurice, the Trojan
favorite, and finish a yard ahead of
the latter. The time of 4:33 4-5 was
slow, due to a loose, damp track; hut
the race itself, as a hard-run, spec
tacular four-lap event, would be hard
to equal.
Wins by a Yard
Later in the day, after Stanford
hopes had sunk to a low level because
of upsets in the 440- and two-mile, Mc-
Kinnon, not favored to place, fought
his way to a one-yard victory in the
880. The plucky Card miler ran the
half as he had the mile, letting the
others set the pace and then opening
up with a terrific sprint on the last
turn. The final drive to the tape be
tween Scliurr of U.S.C. and McKinnon
was even more exciting than that in
the mile.
Edmonds' share in the Stanford vic
tory consisted of seconds in the pole
vault and high hurdles, and a first in
the low hurdles, eleven points in all.
After clearing 12 ft. 6 in. on his first
attempt, the Card vaulter trotted over
to the starting-point of the high bar
rier race. He finished a good second
behind Captain Ross Nichols and two
yards ahead of Webber of U.S.C., fa
vorite for second place. The winning
time was 15 2-5 s.
Edmonds Busy
Then Edmonds went back to the
vaulting pit and recommenced his
work there. About the time the 220-
yard low hurdles race was scheduled
to begin he was vaulting at 13 ft. 6 in.
He cleared the bar at this height on
his second attempt and without stop
ping to even brush off the sawdust
from the pit he again trotted over to
the hurdles course. Ward raced
through a beautiful flight in the lows,
breaking the tape three yards ahead
of Ernie Payne, Trojan low stick man
reputed to be the best on the Coast,
in 25 s. Rogers Smith, Stanford sopho
more, was not more than two feet
behind Payne in third place.
Edmonds and McKinnon were by
no means the only Stanford men who
turned in excellent performances,
j Eric Krenz, who spent most of last
I week in the hospital, put the shot
just once to assure himself of second
place, and then tossed the discus 154
i ft. 8 3-8 in. for an easy first in that
i event. He returned to the hospital im
| mediately after the meet. Then there
; was Harlow Rothert whose heave of
i 50 ft. 3 5-8 in. in the shot scored five
