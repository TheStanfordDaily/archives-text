# EDMONDS, M'KINNON TURN BUCK THREAT OF MIGHTY S. C. TEAM
## Pair of Fighting Card Veterans Score Twenty-One Points to Decide Victory; Templeton's Tracksters Aggregate Lead Averting First Conference Defeat in Three Years 
### BY FRANK WHITELEY 
Ward Edmonds and Alex McKinnon were Stanford's two "iron men" Satur
day, and it was the twenty-one points scored by this pair of fighting Card
veterans that turned back the mighty threat of the University of Southern
California track men and decided in Stanford's favor, 74 to 57, one of the
most thrilling dual meets ever held in the Stadium.
The Trojans had a powerful team, even stronger than the score indicates;
and Stanford supporters are still apt to have nervous tremors as they realize
how close the Cardinal champions came to suffering their first college defeat
in three years. It was only through the efforts of Edmonds and McKinnon
that such a defeat was averted. The Stanford fight, about wkich old grads

like so well to reminisce, was splen
didly illustrated in the competitive
spirit displayed by these two seniors.
McKinnon started the day off right
for the Cards with a victory in the
mile. Trailing the pace setters, Parker
and Gooden of Stanford and Swede
of U.S.C., for the first three laps, Mc-
Kinnon opened up with a driving
sprint on the last turn to overtake
Swede and Fitzmaurice, the Trojan
favorite, and finish a yard ahead of
the latter. The time of 4:33 4-5 was
slow, due to a loose, damp track; hut
the race itself, as a hard-run, spec
tacular four-lap event, would be hard
to equal.
Wins by a Yard
Later in the day, after Stanford
hopes had sunk to a low level because
of upsets in the 440- and two-mile, Mc-
Kinnon, not favored to place, fought
his way to a one-yard victory in the
880. The plucky Card miler ran the
half as he had the mile, letting the
others set the pace and then opening
up with a terrific sprint on the last
turn. The final drive to the tape be
tween Scliurr of U.S.C. and McKinnon
was even more exciting than that in
the mile.
Edmonds' share in the Stanford vic
tory consisted of seconds in the pole
vault and high hurdles, and a first in
the low hurdles, eleven points in all.
After clearing 12 ft. 6 in. on his first
attempt, the Card vaulter trotted over
to the starting-point of the high bar
rier race. He finished a good second
behind Captain Ross Nichols and two
yards ahead of Webber of U.S.C., fa
vorite for second place. The winning
time was 15 2-5 s.
Edmonds Busy
Then Edmonds went back to the
vaulting pit and recommenced his
work there. About the time the 220-
yard low hurdles race was scheduled
to begin he was vaulting at 13 ft. 6 in.
He cleared the bar at this height on
his second attempt and without stop
ping to even brush off the sawdust
from the pit he again trotted over to
the hurdles course. Ward raced
through a beautiful flight in the lows,
breaking the tape three yards ahead
of Ernie Payne, Trojan low stick man
reputed to be the best on the Coast,
in 25 s. Rogers Smith, Stanford sopho
more, was not more than two feet
behind Payne in third place.
Edmonds and McKinnon were by
no means the only Stanford men who
turned in excellent performances,
j Eric Krenz, who spent most of last
I week in the hospital, put the shot
just once to assure himself of second
place, and then tossed the discus 154
i ft. 8 3-8 in. for an easy first in that
i event. He returned to the hospital im
| mediately after the meet. Then there
; was Harlow Rothert whose heave of
i 50 ft. 3 5-8 in. in the shot scored five
points for Stanford and whose discus
toss of 136 ft. 4 7-8 in. was good for
another one.
Borah Hard-Pressed
Hec Dyer, Card sophomore, gave |
Captain Charlie Borah, national sprint !
champion, all of the competition the
curly-headed Southerners could desire
in the shorter distances. Dyer, getting
away to a bad start in the century,
closed up the distance between Borah
and himself, and only a foot sepa
rated them at the finish. The time of
; 10 1-5 was slow because of the track.
; In the 220 Borah was again victor,
| this time by a yard, in 22 1-5 s.
| The big upset of the day came in
i the qarter mile when Vic Williams
of U.S.C., after trailing Johnny Mor
rison of Stanford, the favorite, for the
first 300 yards, opened up with a great
sprint on the last turn to beat him by
six yards in the time of 49 2-5 s., ex
ceptionally fast considering the slow
condition of the track. Pearson of
: U.S.C. placed third, a yard ahead of
! Syer of Stanford.
The other big Stanford upset was
j in the two-mile, where Brown was
1 favored for a second but did not place.
The pace for the first seven laps was
j slow; and Woodruff and Daniels of
| U.S.C., both fast men, had too much
I sprint for the Cardinal entries and
j finished one-two. Ray Griset made a
strong effort to overtake the two Tro
jans, but it came too late; and the
best he could do was third.
Virgil Dowell, jumping 23 ft. 9 5-8
in., farther than he ever had before,
outleaped the Trojan entries, Hill and
| Paul, to take first and assure Stan
ford of the meet.
Leo Kibby, as expected, was win
ner of the javelin with a toss of 201
ft. 11 in. Mortenson of U.S.C. with a
| toss of 196 ft. 7 3-4 in., the longest
| of his career, surprised everyone to
take second place. Sparling of Stan
ford was third with a toss of 192 ft.
1-4 in.
Discus Is Clean Sweep
The discus was a clean sweep for
the Cards, McLeod and Rothert tak
ing second and third. The high jump
| was won by Bowen of U.S.C. at 5 ft.
10 in., Madison and French of Stan
ford tieing for second at 5 ft. 9 in.
After his winning race in the low
hurdles, Edmonds was too tired to
j vault 13 ft. 10 in. to tie Jack Williams
| of U.S.C. for first place. Hubbard of j
the Trojans was third, clearing 13 ft. '
The relay, although Borah did not
[ run for the visitors, proved to be a
I most exciting affair. Shove led off for
I Stanford and gave Syer a six-yeard !
! lead. A slow exchange by U.S.C., Max- j
' well to Bastajian, gave Stanford three !
\ more yards. Bastajian gained a little j
| on Syer, and the next Trojan, Pear
i son, passed McDermott of Stanford !
i and gave Williams, U.S.C. anchor man, i
| a three-yard lead. Johnny Morrison,!.

running last for Stanford, made up
fvjr his defeat by Williams in the quar
ter-mile by passing the Trojan and
breaking the tape three yards ahead
of him, The time was 3:23 1-5.
