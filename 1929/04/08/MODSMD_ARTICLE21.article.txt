Despite the eagerness with which the average senior is racing toward
that goal, graduation, and despite the joyful anticipation of no more
classes, late study hours, and dry texts, he can not, cynical as he may
be, think of leaving Stanford without a slight tinge of sadness. For
after all, they have been four good years, four years of comparative
freedom and ease, four years of friendship and ideas, and hence four
years that will always be cherished in memory.
There is a long standing tradition, dating back God knows how far,
that provides that the departing senior leave with his alma mater a small
gift symbolizing his appreciation for the things that his college has

given him.
Traditions are dangerous things. They take away from action the
spontaneity that makes of it a living thing. Through tradition actions
become dried following the grooves of years of usage. As in this class
idea, the student is cognizant of the fact that it is a thing that always
has been done, it is the conventional thing, so bowing to this realizaion
l;e gives. A mechanical thing at best.
The 1929 Class Fund for Instruction and Research contains all these
elements of the cut and dried. It contains them but has also a saving
grace. By its endowment nature, it extends the giving through the years,
it enables the student to gauge his own desire to give, and in this way
rises above the conventional idea. Yet even then it is in the last analysis
a matter of the individual attitude.

A gift may come from within, or it may come from the vain desire
to stand among the classmates and do as they do, thus avoiding censute.
Don't give unless you mean it. Ihe University profits by the gift,
whoever gives it and from whatever motive. However, the essence of
giving is not a superficial thing. Stanford should mean enough to every
one of its graduates to elicit from him a gift, motivated by the desire
to show appreciation and gratitude, alone.
