# No Justice for Mooney
## 
### 
To gain the pardon of Mooney and Billings, the University of Wis
consin Liberal Club has issued a call to all students interested in freeing
the two labor leaders, who were convicted on perjured testimony of
placing the bomb which killed ten and injured forty persons in San
Francisco during a San Francisco preparedness parade in 1916.
Both judge and jury have declared that Mooney is innocent of the
act, in the light of disclosures of perjury at the trial, which came too
late to be reviewed by the courts. Billings, convicted on the same testi
mony, seems also to have been exonerated by these disclosures. Ihe
trial judge and chief advocate of the pardoning of Mooney has vainly
applied to Governor C. C. Young for his freedom.
The student movement may be a voice crying in the wilderness, yet
it is significant that any organized body of students should set itself about
to remedy such a grave error as this.
This case is in itself tragic, but more far-reaching are the principles
behind it. It shows how easily the innocent citizen may be caught by a
retributive justice, and most unfortunate of all, it shows how, once
caught, and even proved guiltless, there is no recompense, no making of
amends for the life thus ruined.
The man falsely accused and sent to prison is marked for good. lie
may be freed, but that is all. In a system of criminal justice that calls
itself justice this glaring wrong stands out to make of it a feeble mockery.
