# Crew Regatta
## 
### 
The crew regatta this Saturday between California and Washington
brings about that perennial spring fever that has beset many generations
of Daily editors, "Why hasn't Stanford a crew?"
A thousand utilitarian answers have been given. It has been proved
that crew is hard on the student athlete, that it is too expensive an event,
that few can see it, that etc., etc. Still it remains that we wish Stanford
had a crew.
The expense seems to be the outstanding stumbling block of past
efforts to gain a Stanford crew. California in a way is seeing itself clear
of this by its system of barge-bleachers with seats selling at a nominal
charge of two dollars.
Stanford's small student body is a natural limitation on the number
of athletes it can have. Crew would take certain of the men from
established sports to do service in it. This is another argument against
rrew.
Hut were there enough student demand for the sport, it could be
made possible. There arc other sports that take men away from the
major one; there are others that don't make their keep. Il is a matter
of whether or not the student body wants it.
Crew is an old sport, highly recognized in Europe and the East.
Stanford as a representative university could well afford to have a crew.
