Nominations are now open for
Stanford's Hall of Fame and we
hasten to list our candidates.
To head the list are Ward Edmonds
and Alex McKinnon. Edmonds was
perhaps the busiest man competing
on the field Saturday. With the cross
bar at 13 feet 6 inches, which Wil
iams had cleared, Edmonds attempted
to make it, hut he failed. The hurdles
were all set for the 120-yard race and
the Card pole vault ace tried again
and cleared the bar, at no mean
height. Hardly had he struck the
ground till he was running over to
take his position in the hurdle race.
Edmonds knew Dink was counting on
a second, and he gave more to take
a beautiful first.
Back again over to the pole
vault pit to try 13 feet 10 inches.
It was complete enough evidence
that Edmonds had given every
thing he had in the hurdles by
the way he tried to top the bar,
but in vain.
McKinnon was rated by the sports
public as an athlete who has seen his
better days. But he firmly convinced
that he is not through by the way
he finished the mile and especially
the half-mile. There are those who
predict that McKinnon will be turn
ing out for the quarter before long.
Just another reason for saying that
Dink Templeton is the "smartest track
coach in the country today."
Eric Krenz also deserves spe
cial mention. Krenz got up from
the hospital bed where he had
been sent for a bad cold, to com
pete in the meet Saturday. He
was not seriously ill but in all
probability did not feel like com
peting in a track meet on a cold,
raw day. But he did and made
eight points for the Cardinals by
winning the discus and placing
second in the shot. Who says
world champions care only for
themselves and their own laurels?
Some time ago Dink Templeton pre
dicted that the Cards would win by
around twenty points. They won with
a teen-point margin. At that
time everyone said Dink needed to
take off his rose-colored glasses. And
if (he Cards had lost there would
have been a lot of well-meaning but
overzealous fans wanting to hang
crepe on Mr. Templeton's nose for
making such a prediction.
But now those same people are
swelling up like poisoned pups
and telling the world what a
smart man Mr. Templeton is and
how smart they are for seeing how
great he is.
And it all comes under the head of
human nature!
