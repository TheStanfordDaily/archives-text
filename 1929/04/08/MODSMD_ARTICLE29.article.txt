University of Washington boxers |
raptured the Far-Western Conference i
title Saturday night in Sacramento !
when they won three bouts out of |
seven of a five-cornered tournament, j
University of California leather-push- I
ers took two bouts; and U.C.L.A. and |
California Aggies each won one apiece. I
Stanford boxers failed to reach the j
finals.
Vance Rogers, featherweight, lost j
a fourth-round decision to Ed Nemir
of Berkeley. Nemir was the stronger
man and in the extra and deciding
round got inside of Rogers' defense
to win the decision.
*aul Maurer, featherweight, lost a |
three-round decision to Eason, i
U.C.L.A. colored fighter, who later !
won the championship in that weight.
Maurer was simply outboxed by the !
dusky lad.
A1 "Red" Hamilton was technically
knocked out in the second round of
his match with Bill Robinson of Cali- j
fornia Aggies. Robinson, who later j
took the heavyweight title, was too j
much for the inexperienced Cardinal.
Hamilton had been substituted at the
last minute in place of Dillon and had
not time to get into condition.
Harry Birch, lightweight, also had j
the misfortune of meeting a future j
champion in his bout with Keitli Jones i
of Washington. Jones outclassed the !
Stanford boy in three rounds of fast |
fighting.
Boxing the best bout of his career, J
Captain-elect Ralph Malcolm lost a
questionable decision to Les Waight !
of California Aggies. Malcolm fought !
a heady battle, and many of the fans i
felt that he should have been awarded 1
the decision.
