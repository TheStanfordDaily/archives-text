# HOUSES ORGANIZE TO PERFECT SYSTEM OF CO-OPERATIVE BUYING
## New Association Outgrowth Of Old "Co-op"; Will Effect Savings 
### 
Stanford fraternity and sorority j
bouses and eating club managers have
taken another step to perfect their
co-operative organization during the
past several weeks by the formation
of the Students Co-operative Purchas- |
:ng Association.
The new association, which is an
outgrowth of the old, loosely organized ,
"Co-op" is expected to increase the ■
service and save individual establish- ,
mcnts hundreds of dollars each year
(in groceries, meats, and other staples, i
Purchases will be made in seasons j
when prices are low and in large j
quantities, thus giving houses and !
clubs the same low food costs enjoyed |
by large establishments such as the
Union and Encina Commons.
Daily deliveries and the establish
ment of a meat chest are on the pro
gram to be inaugurated next fall ac
cording to Elliott Ayres and Dean
Morrison, business manager and
president of the association. The old
"Co-op" handled groceries only and
maintained a bi-weekly delivery ser
vice.
The association is organized on a
partnership basis with each house an
equal member. Houses are required ;
to sign five-year contracts and to ;
place a $100 deposit with the associa
tion. This will insure the future of
the organization and provide an im
mediate working capital. Sixteen ,
houses have signed to date, and eleven
more will sign before the end of the j
week. The association expects to do j
an annual business of more than
$45,000.
A governing board of live is chosen ;
from the member houses. The person- |
ne) of this body includes Dean Mor- J
rison, president; Jack Stewart, vice-;
president; Fred Zitkowsky, secretary; j
Vivian Adams, and Louise Buxton, j
Elliott Ayres, the business manager,
is an ex-officio member of the group. J
The University, through Comptroller '
Roth, has long favored such a plan I
and has gone so far as to subsidize
the association by providing them
with a storehouse. Stanford is the sec- i
ond university in the West to estab
lish such a system. Houses at Oregon |
State College have maintained a suc
cessful organization for several years.

Stanford fraternity and sorority j
bouses and eating club managers have
taken another step to perfect their
co-operative organization during the
past several weeks by the formation
of the Students Co-operative Purchas- |
:ng Association.
The new association, which is an
outgrowth of the old, loosely organized ,
"Co-op" is expected to increase the ■
service and save individual establish- ,
mcnts hundreds of dollars each year
(in groceries, meats, and other staples, i
Purchases will be made in seasons j
when prices are low and in large j
quantities, thus giving houses and !
clubs the same low food costs enjoyed |
by large establishments such as the
Union and Encina Commons.
Daily deliveries and the establish
ment of a meat chest are on the pro
gram to be inaugurated next fall ac
cording to Elliott Ayres and Dean
Morrison, business manager and
president of the association. The old
"Co-op" handled groceries only and
maintained a bi-weekly delivery ser
vice.
The association is organized on a
partnership basis with each house an
equal member. Houses are required ;
to sign five-year contracts and to ;
place a $100 deposit with the associa
tion. This will insure the future of
the organization and provide an im
mediate working capital. Sixteen ,
houses have signed to date, and eleven
more will sign before the end of the j
week. The association expects to do j
an annual business of more than
$45,000.
