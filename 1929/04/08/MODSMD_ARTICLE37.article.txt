# SPORTS OF 1929
## Lively and Gay 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
One of the reasons for the success
of the Chicago Cubs last year was a
husky, big-jawed individual named
Charley Grimm, who is being rather
overlooked lately owing to all the ex
citement over the fact that Hornsby
is about to start his first season as a
Chicagoan. Grimm may not bat as
well as the Hajah (although his aver
age of .297 since he went to tlie Cubs
is better than that of several other
first basemen), but he can field rings
around Hornsby, and who knows
when he is suddenly going to come
to life and hit .345 again, as he did in
1028 for Pittsburgh?

Grimm fielded .993 in 1928, and bat
ted .294 in 147 games. Curiously
enough, he has played in exactly that
number of games in bis last three
seasons. I like to watch him play first
base, because in nearly every game he
makes a sensational stop or catch.

I have seen him dive headforemost
along the earth and spear a sizzling
liner about a foot off the ground, and
then land on his ear and slide along
in a cloud of dust but come up smil
ing with the ball.

Charley stepped into the Cardinal
line-up in 191S after six seasons as a
peanut-butcher in the St. Louis ball
park. Besides watching the stars per

l'orm, lie would work out to get a
try-out himself. Connie Mack looked
him over in 191ti, and he put in a
season and a half with Little Rock
before he got a steady job with the
Pirates, beginning with the 1920 sea
son. In 1924 he was traded to the
Cubs with Maranville and Sooper for
Aldridge, Grantham, and Niehaus.
Grimm has always played first base
â€”and how he does play it!
