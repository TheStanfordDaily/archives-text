# Advance Ticket Sale For Theatre Follies To Start Tomorrow
## 
### 
Beginning at 8:30 tomorrow morn
ing, tickets for the "Theatre Fund
Follies," to be presented at 8 o'clock
Thursday night in the Assembly Hall,
will go on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
in the Old Union. Edwin Smith, dra
matic manager, announces that the
sale will continue until 5 o'clock each
afternoon for three days —if the tick
ets hold out that long. He advises
people to come early, not to avoid the
rush, but to get tickets before they
are sold out.
Although the committee in charge
has set the price of admission at a
minimum of fifty cents, it has care
fully neglected to put a limit on how
much over that patrons may pay for
their tickets. As all the proceeds from
the Benefit Vaudeville will be turned
over to the New Theatre for Stanford
Fund, the committee has a hunch that
there will be many who will want to
add a quarter or a half dollar (or
even more, perhaps) to the price of
their tickets and thus help swell the
coffers.
Doors Open at 7:30
At 7:30 Thursday night the doors
of the Assembly Hall will be opened
and ticket-holders will be allowed to
rush in and grab any seats which
have not been already taken by
sleepers left over from morning
classes. As no seats are reserved, it
will be well either to go early and
stand in line (if any) or else become
personally acquainted with one of the
doormen.
A wealth of material has been col
lected from the members of the three
campus dramatic societies —Masquers,
Swords and Sandals, and Ram's Head
—which are producing the "Follies."
Besides several new songs especially
written for the vaudeville, two favor
ites from last year's Junior Opera will
be revived. Helen Ward will sing
"Mama's Goin' Bye-Bye," and Kath
leen Fitz will feature "Sing a Little
Song."
Frances Boone is coaching the Mas
quers' chorus of eight blooming beau
ties for their dances in Burnell Gould's
burlesque operetta, "The Student
Quince," which, if it is anything like
that which previously appeared in
Chaparral, will be jest in pun. In order
to disguise it, the name has been
changed to "Swiss Cheese Preferred,"
which is reminiscent of the last Junior
Opera.
"Strange Interlocution" will not be
as tedious as the eminent Eugene
O'Neill's because the audience will
not have to bring sandwiches in order
to keep from starving before it is
over. Among other burlesques is"For
the Honor of Old Texas" —which, if
anything, is a burlesque on burlesques.
