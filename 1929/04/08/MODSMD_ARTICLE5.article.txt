ing to members of the Senior Class by
(lie 1929 Endowment Committee.
Enclosed is a pledge card and a re

returning the pledge card as soon as
possible. A personal canvass will be
made of those who are still unheard

"We hope that the Class of 1929
will leave its imprint on Stanford in
the form of a substantial endowment,
as Stanford has inevitably left a life
long impression with us," is the way
that Hilliard Giffen, chairman of the
committee, closes the appeal to the
"Twenty-niners."
Besides Giffen on the committee are
Florence Cooper, Alexia McCarty,
