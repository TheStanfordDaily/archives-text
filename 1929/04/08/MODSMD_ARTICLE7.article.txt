# U.C. SWAMPS REDSHIRTS IN 7 TO 2 GAME
## Bears Meet No Opposition as Three Pitchers Fail to Halt Heavy Hits 
### 
Bunched hits and splendid pitching
by Horner enabled California to de
cisively beat the Cardinal nine here
Saturday afternoon in the first of the
annioil three-game series by a score
of 7-2. At no time of the game did
Stanford display any power while
Coach Wolter used three pitchers in
a vain attempt to stop the barrage
of hits laid down by the Bears.
California made its first run in the
fourth when Furman walked, went to
second on Stevenson's sacrifice bunt,
and scored on Burgett's single over
second.
With one away in the fifth, Butler
hit a Texas Leaguer over short, Swen
son reached first on a fielder's choice,
and Furman filled the bags by a walk.
All three scored on Stevenson's triple
to deep center. Burgett beat out an
infield hit and Stevenson scored when
Kardy attempted to catch Burgett
at second on a steal.
The Berkeley gang garnered its last
two runs in the seventh by safe
bingles by Swenson and Furman into
right field, a wild pitch from Lewis,
and Stevenson's drive into center.
Stanford's two runs came in a be
lated ninth-inning rally. Churchill got
a Texas Leaguer over short and Hun
ken fanned. Berg hit a grounder to
Valianos for an easy double play, but
t Jig Bear shortstop let the ball roll
into the outfield. Rickson threw to
| third to catch Churchill, and the Card
serond-sacker romped home when
IJutler let the hall go between his
legs. Berg scored a moment later on
a passed hall, but Hardy and Johnson
ended the rally with easy outs. The
