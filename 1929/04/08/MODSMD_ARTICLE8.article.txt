# CAL FROSH LOSE TO CARDS IN LAST-INNING RALLY AT BERKELEY
## 
### 
By going on a great hitting ram
page in the eleventh inning, Stan
ford's freshman baseball team scored
five runs to break a 7-7 tie and win a
one-sided slugfest from the California
Cubs in the first game of the 1929
Little Big series last Saturday on the
San Pablo high school diamond.
Fox started things in the eleventh
by singling through second. Stine fol
lowed with a liner that was good for
two bases and scored Fox. Kelly
singled and Dixon walked to fill the
sacks. McLean doubled to deep center,

driving Kelly and Stine across the
plate. White drove in Dixon and Mc-
Lean with a long hit to left field, to
complete the scoring. In California's
half of the eleventh, McLean easily
put away the first three men to bat.

The Card babes knocked out 20 hits
against 6 for the Cubs and the game
should have been won without extra
innings. Captain Rintala and White
led the hitting with four safe blows
each, and Fox and Kelly were right
behind with three hits apiece.
Rudy Rintala, four-sport man for
the class of 1932, was elected captain
of the freshman nine immediately
preceding the game. Rintala was a
former star at Poly high school in
San Francisco. Score by innings:
Stanford 1 2110200005
California 1 0020103000
