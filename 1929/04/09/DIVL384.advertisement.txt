Gentlemen:
The tobacco samples you sent, me
have been received, and they are great. |
1 If you can picture in your mind the J
lonesomeness of a traveling man in a
small town on a rainy night, not a
j friend in a hundred miles, nothing to j
| do and no place to go:
That was the position I was in when
your samples of Erlgeworth came. It '
was like a voice from above when I
opened the package and got the old
i pipe steaming.
I have smoked various brands of
tobacco for the past fifteen years, but
I never in my life have I found a to
i bacco at any price that will equal <
Edgeworth. It does not bite the
(ongue, and a beautiful aroma follows.
With the good old friend pipe and a i
can of Edgeworth you can dream of j
the rainbow's end.
Please count me in the future as an
Edgeworth booster.
