# CAMPUS BACKING FOR GOLF LINKS ASKED BY B.A.C.
## Daily Seeks Information on Number of Students Who Intend to Play on Course Masters Expects Difficulty in Securing 200 Members From Peninsula Golfers 
### Stephen Dietrich 
The Stanford Daily, in co-operation
with (he Board of Athletic Control, is
today endeavoring to learn how many
students intend to use the proposed
Rolf course. A coupon to be signed by
all students who hope to play on the
campus course is published in today's
paper.
It was originally intended to start
construction of the eighteen-hole cam
pus golf course as soon as two hun
dred "one-year playing privilege"
memberships were taken up by the
general public. It was also stipulated
that the total number, excluding stu
dents and faculty members, should
not exceed 250. But Masters made it
known yesterday that the Board of
Athletic Control would probably have
a hard time getting 200 outside mem
bers, the number necessary to meet
the construction costs.
This means that it will take an
ample amount of student backing, as
well as the outside support, to put
across the proposed golf course. The
coupons, printed in a box at the bot
tom of the page, will secure the in
formation as to student enthusiasm.
If enough students sign up to promise
sound backing, the number of neces
sary outside memberships will be cut
down and construction on the pro
jected course will get under way.
As stated in the coupon, the signa
tures will not obligate the students
in any way. Actual applications for
playing privileges may be secured at
the Palo Alto Chamber of Commerce
or at the Stanford Board of Athletic
Control offices. Students and faculty
members may take out a one or three
months' playing privilege upon the
payment of $6 or $15 respectively.
