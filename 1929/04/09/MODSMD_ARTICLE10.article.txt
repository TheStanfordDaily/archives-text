TORONTO. Ont., April 8. (JP)â€” Eight
: persons were killed and damage esti
mated in excess of $1,000,000 was done
by storms sweeping across Ontario
during the week-end.
Rail and highway traffic was de-
I moralized and several communities
were isolated by floods, which carried
out bridges and undermined tracks.
At Gait four feet of water rose in
the principal streets, and power, tele
phone, and telegraph lines were down.
The breaking of power dams en
forced the closing of factories in a
j number of towns.
