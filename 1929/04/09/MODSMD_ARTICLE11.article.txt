# SUPREME COURT GIVES SINCLAIR JAIL SENTENCE
## Opinion of Court Unanimous; Indicted for Contempt Of U.S. Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON, April S. (JP)â€” Harry
F. Sinclair, under a supreme court de
cision today, must serve three months
in jail for contempt of the Senate in
refusing to answer all questions asked
in the Teapot Dome Oil investigation.
The opinion of the court was unani
mous.
The wealthy oil operator will have
25 days in which to ask for a re-hear
ing before the mandate will be issued
but re-hearings are seldom granted.
In addition to the jail sentence he
must pay a fine of $500.
Questioned concerning the contract
which the committee had been in
formed called for a payment of
$250,000 to F. G. Bonfils and John
Leo Stack for surrendering rights
they claimed on Teapot Dome, Sin
clair refused to answer. He took the
position that the Senate, having
adopted a resolution on February 8,
1924, calling upon the President to
cause proceedings to be instituted to
cancel the leases on naval oil reserves
made by Albert B. Fall, as secretary
of the interior, the inquiry had passed
beyond the control of the Senate com
mittee. He insisted that a suit having
been started charging conspiracy and
fraud, he could not be compelled to
testify as a witness except in the
courts.
When brought to trial Sinclair con
tended the questions he refused to an
swer related to his private affairs, and
to matters in the control of the courts
and challenged the jurisdiction of the
Senate committee to continue its in
vestigation in view of the suits which
had been filed in the courts.
Justice Butler declared the evidence
did not sustain Sinclair's contention
that the investigation was avowedly
not in aid of legislation, and that he
had failed to show the committee was
not proceeding with the purpose of
ascertaining whether additional legis
lation might be advisable.
