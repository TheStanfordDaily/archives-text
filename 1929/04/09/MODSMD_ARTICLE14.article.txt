# Montana Scores Win Over Cards In Legal Debate
## Juries Called Incompetent To Render Verdicts on Insanity Charges 
### 
Montana debaters speaking on the
affirmative of the question, "Resolved,
That the Flea of Temporary Insanity
in Criminal Cases Should Be Abol
ished by Law," last night defeated a
Stanford team in the Little Theatre
by an audience decision of 49 to 15.
Russell Smith and Robert Williams
of the northern institution opposed
the Stanford combination of Irving
Rosenblatt and William L. Shaw in a
contest which centered mainly around
legal technicalities.
Smith opened the affirmative case
by citing cases of the criminal insane
who have escaped to prey a second
time on society through writs of
"habeas corpus." His suggestion for
reform was that examination for san
ity be entrusted to a state board of
alienists after the guilt of the defend
ant has been established by jury trial.
Bringing up a technical discussion
of the part played by the intent to
commit crime in connection with the
problem, Rosenblatt suggested for the
negative that the insane could not be
guilty of crime because they are not
capable of entertaining the necessary
intent.
Williams maintained, "The insanity
plea is much abused, but as long as it
is the law attorneys have the right
to use it if they can." Shaw offered
the negative's construction plan of an
examination by state alienists before
the trial stating that if the person is
insane he is not guilty before the law.
Ben Dunniway, law graduate, pre
sided during the contest and also dur
ing a short forum conducted after
wards to aid some high school de
baters who are soon to debate the
same question.
