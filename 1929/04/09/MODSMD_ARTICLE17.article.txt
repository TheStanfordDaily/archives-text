# LEGISLATURE IN INDIA IS BOMBED BY COMMUNISTS
## 
### 
NEW DELHI, India, April 8. (#>)—
The campaign of the Indian govern
ments against communist agitation
had an ominous sequel in the legisla
tive assembly today where several
members were injured and the others
panic-stricken by the explosion of two
bombs thrown from a gallery.
Sir Bomanjee Delalal was struck
by a fragment of the bomb which
made a wound two inches long and
half an inch wide. He was the only
one gravely injured although other
prominent persons, including Sir
George Schuster, financial member of
the executive council of the viceroy,
were injured.
The two men who threw the bombs
made no attempt to escape but sur
rendered themselves to the police who
charged them with attempted murder.
They gave up pistols which it was said
that they had fired although this could
not be definitely determined because
of the confusion into which the as
sembly was thrown.
One of the prisoners, Baghat Singh,
of Punjab, was said to be a nephew
of the notorious revolutionary Ajit
Singh who was arrested a year ago
but released for lack of evidence. The
uncle is still in exile. The other
bomber was Butukeswara Dutt of
Bengal.
The outrage came at the moment of
a serious dispute between the govern
ment and President Patel of the as
sembly who is an Indian home-ruler.
The assembly was about to debate the
government public safety bill whioh
vvould authorize deportation of non-
Indians convicted of communist agi
tation.
