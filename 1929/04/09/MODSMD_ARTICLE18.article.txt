# STANFORD SWIMMERS DEFEAT O.C. TEAM IN PACIFIC JUNIOR MEET
## 
### 
To complete Stanford's successful
athletic week-end, several of the fresh
man and varsity swimmers won high
honors at the Pacific Association Jun
ior Swimming Meet in Sutro Baths
Sunday. In Saturday's events Stanford
won 18 points, enough to win the two
day meet. The Olympic Club, second
in score, won 17 points both days.
The no-Sunday competition rule
prevented the Cardinals from partici
pating on the second day, although
several of the local mermen swam un
attached.
Frank Booth led the race for indi
vidual honors, winning the 500-yard
free-style and the 225-yard medley.
The last event of the meet featured
a surprise when Herb Marsh placed
first in the diving contest over Ed
Throndson. The margin between the
two Card divers has always been
small, and Marsh has been trying to
eliminate it altogether. Jack Pahl,
freshman sprinter, captured first in
the 100-yard dash.
