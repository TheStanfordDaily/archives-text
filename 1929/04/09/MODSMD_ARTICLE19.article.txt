### 
Repeal of the Volstead Act—yes or
no, will be a question submitted to
the student body in the coming elec
tion. The Ex Committee last night
granted the Daily permission to find
out how the campus stands on this
problem. The Stanford vote will be
the opening gun of a nation-wide in
vestigation of student opinion on the
problem.
The Daily plans to gain the co
operation of regionally representative
colleges and universities all over the
United States, toward determining
student opinion on this matter. The
vote will parallel the national survey
now being conducted by a Federal
commission.

president of the A.S.S.U. was accepted
