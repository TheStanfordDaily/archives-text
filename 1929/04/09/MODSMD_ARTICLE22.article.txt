# Repeal the Volstead Act. Yes or No?
## 
### 
Said President Hoover in his inaugural address, "1 propose to appoint
a national commission for a searching investigation of the whole struc
ture of our Federal system of jurisprudence, to include the method of
enforcement of the 18th Amendment and the causes of abuse under it."
Few problems have ever rocked the nation as lias this current one of
Prohibition and its enforcement. President Hoover, recognizing this, is
carrying on a nation-wide search into its "enforcement and causes of
abuse."
As a humble parallel to this national investigation, the Daily will en
deavor to obtain a survey of student opinion on one phase of the problem
from this campus and from the campuses of representative universities
throughout the nation.
The Daily proposes to place before representative student bodies the
question, "The Volstead Act should he repealed." It is believed that a
wider response will be gained and a more positive one by putting this
question to the student than would be gained from a complex question
naire containing endless questions on the problem.
The repeal of the Volstead Act would definitely hamstring the 18th
Amendment, which probably can never be removed from the Constitu
tion. The repeal of the Volstead Act would not of necessity bring back
the saloon, rather would it pave the way to a solution to the problem of
alcoholic beverages, which no one can say has been solved by the 18th
Amendment and the Volstead Act.
This is somewhat beside the point. The Daily has been granted the
privilege by the Executive Committee to make its investigation by ballot
during the A.S.S.U. election next Tuesday. It is sincerely hoped that a
substantial response will be gained from the student body at that time.
Prior to the ballot the Campus Opinion column of the Daily will be open
to controversial letters on the problem.
