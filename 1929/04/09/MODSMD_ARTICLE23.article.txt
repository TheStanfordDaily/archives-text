The Daily in co-operation with the Board of Athletic Control prints
today a small questionnaire concerning the proposed golf course. It re
quests that all students who have any interest whatsoever in the course
fill out the blank and see that it reaches the Board.
The ball has been started rolling toward making the long dreamed of
links a reality. The Trustees have set aside the necessary land. Foremost
golf-architects have been secured to construct an excellent course. A
plan has I>een devised to gain certain outside funds to aid it along. Now
it remains to find out just what the opinion of the student body is on the
matter.
The playing privileges open to outsiders will pay for part of the
project, but only a part of it. Student support must be had to put the
thing over, in the last analysis the entire project is for the benefit of the
student body, so the student body can do its part now by giving the Board
some concrete idea of the weight of student interest in a golf course.
