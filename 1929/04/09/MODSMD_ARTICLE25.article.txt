Some poor land on the cast side of Mount Tamalpais, I read, has been appraised

should all be sold. All public parks should be owned, some by the counties and the
rest by places within the counties. National and State parks arc maintained by
general tax money, but are used by only a few people—are too little used to be
reasonably had. They represent taxation without value received.
