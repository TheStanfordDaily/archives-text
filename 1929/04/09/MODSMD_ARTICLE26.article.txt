# The 						Bullsession
## A 						MIXED BLESSING 
### 
Once again religion sheds blood, i
This time, in Mexico.
The hundreds of thousands of lives j
lost during the past nineteen een-,
turies in warfare and torture which I
i
may be traced directly or indirectly j
to the institution of Christianity, jus- '
tify doubt as to whether the Christian i
religion has done this world more i
good than evil.
Is Christianity—we moan organized j
Christianity, not the spirit—compati- j
ble with the advance of modern civili
zation? It is an odd fact that the re- !
ligion is today thriving best, holding ;
most power, in those countries where j
fear, ignorance, and poverty abound.!
Let us, as an experiment, balance
a few of the benefits which Christi
anity has brought the world against
a few of the evils which it has fos
tered:
It has contributed much to litera-;
ture, and has inspired much fine art,;
architecture, and literature; it has ;
been the chief agency in the Western |
hemisphere for preservation and teach- j
ing of ethics and morality; it has in j
Dome instances served as a means for j
cementing peoples into strong na
tions; it has, particularly of late
years, been a powerful instrument for j
the betterment of social conditions; j
and, most important, it serves as one j
means of solace for the sick, the un-i
fortunate, and the fearful-of-deatli.
Among the indictments which may j
be made against Christianity during;
its nineteen centuries are these: war
fare, murder, and torture; warfare
upon science; conquest and robbery

| in the name of religion; the fostering
lof despotism; chief blame for the
j stagnation, during nine centuries, of
j the advancement of world civiliza
! tion; intolerance; opposition to di
; vorct# birth control, vivisection, and
other agencies of social betterment;
i the glorification of weakness, inimi-
I
cal to progress; and, in this country
1 of late, participation in movements to
j intimidate government agencies.
Can the good which organized Chris
| linnity has done counterbalance the
! evil? Probably it can, though it has
i been a mixed blessing. Man, aspiring
! to heaven, carries many millstones in
; iiis climb.
You will say that the evils cited
I aboYe are due, not to Christianity,
j but to parasitic growths upon Chris
j tianity. That is true. Beneath the
| abuses, beneath such trappings as
Heaven and Hell, the divinity of
j Christ, Jonah and the whale and the
| like, Christianity is hidden as pure
jas ever —a system of ethics and good
living propounded long ago by a pro
[ found young Jew who lived by itiner
j ant preaching.
To survive today, Christianity must
! be rid of the bosh and trappings and
J ballyhoo. We need a revised Bible, a
very small book, setting forth the
! Golden Rule, six of the Ten Com
[ mandments, and a few other things
I pertinent to the religion. The remain
| der of the bulky old Bible should be
i relegated, to eliminate confusion, to
the field of literature-mythology-his
tory where it belongs.
