They Still Fall in Love. By Jesse j
Lynch Williams. (New York: j
Scribner's. $2.50.)
Harrison Cope had an inferiority j
complex because he was short in sta- j
ture and built on a rather small scale, j
Bui he was a self-confessed highbrow. |
"A highbrow," he said, "is one who i
knows more than you do and is not
ashamed of it." Harrison was an in-!
tellectual —interested primarily in lab- j
oratory work, spiders and fossils. He i
was a great disappointment to his !
socially elite parents because he had j
no interest in society life.
Nothing of particular importance |
happened in his life until he kissed I
Evelyn—"Evelyn, the tall, slender girl |
with the gorgeous eyes—even though j
her nose was much too Roman—Eve- j
lyn, with the golden-brown hair and !
a beautiful body—except that she was i
a bit knock-kneed." And her father 1
had a couple of hundred million dol-!
lars.
But Harrison wanted to be a re- [
search student. He did not care a rap
for either Evelyn or her father's j
money. It was entirely her fault that
he kissed her, for she had wagered 1
fifty dollars that she could make the
woman-hating, self-satisfied little Har- j
rison kiss her.
That one kiss started a story that j

l ended, eventually, with Harrison get-!
j ting over his dislike for Evelyn and
i his hatred of her fortune —and they
' lived happily ever after.
The story is amusing and enjoyable,
i The dialogue is clever; it fairly spar
! kles with wit and pungency. The main
I fault is that the story seems to be
stretched out too far. The first two-
I
! thirds of the book move along without
| once letting down reader-interest. But j
i the end lags. The reader sees what is !
| going to happen, and finishes the story |
j merely as a matter of form.
Jesse Lynch Williams, the author,
j is a master at handling high-comedy
I dialogue which made the fame of his j
I Pulitzer Prize Play, "Why Marry?" j
j There is much of this same sort of
! dialogue in "They Still Fall in Love."
The book, then, concerns "the youth
| of today, not yesterday. These well
\ bred young people belong to the new
! est generation, the advance-guard of j
| the counter revolution against the :
[ flaming rebels of the post-war period,
j They laugh at their predecessors—old
| fashioned, too noisy, generation con
] scious. But they do not believe in love
1 and romance —absurd as idealism and
! chivalry. 'It's merely the Biological |
i Urge.' They believe in that. But — j
i they still fall in love."

Harrison Cope had an inferiority j
complex because he was short in sta- j
ture and built on a rather small scale, j
Bui he was a self-confessed highbrow. |
"A highbrow," he said, "is one who i
knows more than you do and is not
ashamed of it." Harrison was an in-!
tellectual —interested primarily in lab- j
oratory work, spiders and fossils. He i
was a great disappointment to his !
socially elite parents because he had j
no interest in society life.
Nothing of particular importance |
happened in his life until he kissed I
Evelyn—"Evelyn, the tall, slender girl |
with the gorgeous eyes—even though j
her nose was much too Roman—Eve- j
lyn, with the golden-brown hair and !
a beautiful body—except that she was i
a bit knock-kneed." And her father 1
had a couple of hundred million dol-!
lars.
But Harrison wanted to be a re- [
search student. He did not care a rap
for either Evelyn or her father's j
money. It was entirely her fault that
he kissed her, for she had wagered 1
fifty dollars that she could make the
woman-hating, self-satisfied little Har- j
rison kiss her.
That one kiss started a story that j

l ended, eventually, with Harrison get-!
j ting over his dislike for Evelyn and
i his hatred of her fortune —and they
' lived happily ever after.
The story is amusing and enjoyable,
i The dialogue is clever; it fairly spar
! kles with wit and pungency. The main
I fault is that the story seems to be
stretched out too far. The first two-
I
! thirds of the book move along without
| once letting down reader-interest. But j
i the end lags. The reader sees what is !
| going to happen, and finishes the story |
j merely as a matter of form.
