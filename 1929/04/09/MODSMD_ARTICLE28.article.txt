# War Violates International Law; Peace Habit Becoming Widespread
## 
### Margaret Cummings 
"The peace habit is growing. The
League of Nations, the World Court,
and the Kellogg Treaty have put law
into the hands of the peace party.
Civilized nations have pledged them
selves to civilized methods of settling
disputes. War is now a violation of in
ternational law."
This is the basis on which the ideal
of world peace may be realized, be
lieves Dr. Edwin D. Mead, who was
for many years director of the World
Peace Foundation. Dr. Mead was a
9ampus visitor yesterday as the guest
of his friend, Dr. Jordan, whose work
for peace he honors as epoch-making.
An ardent supporter of the League,
Dr. Mead believes "the League and
the World Court have done more for
the cause of peace than any other
agency in the whole of history."
Bitterness Dispelled
Now, ten years after the war, the
representatives of the defeated na
tions sit in the League and the Coun
cil in friendship and co-operation.
Two years ago I found in neither ling
land or Germany any resentment or
bitterness toward the enemy nations.
Comparing this feeling with the hate
that lived for three quarters of a cen
tury after the Thirty Years' War, this
assumes tremendous significance."
Dr. Mead believes that tlie United
States will eventually become a mem
ber of the League. "I have no doubt
of our ultimately joining the League.
It is impossible with the present rapid
growth and interdependence of na
tions for any nation to stay out per
manently or for long."
World Wants Peace
"The whole pressure of the world's
needs, the best thought of the world,
and the greatest religious and educa

tioual sentiment of our country is to
ward peace.
"We must not forget that our presi
dent, Woodrow Wilson, framed the
League. Europe has not forgotten
this, and honors him greatly. Europe
does not generally understand, how
ever, that a majority of the Senate
favored the League in 1919, although
it was defeated through the failure to
secure a two-thirds majority." In this
connection Dr. Mead condemned the
anomaly which allows a majority of
the Senate to declare war and re
quires a two-thirds majority to end it.
