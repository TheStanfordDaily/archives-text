# CARD BASEBALL NINE HAS LAST CHANCE TO DEFEAT U.S.C. TEAM
## 
### 
The third game of the Stanford
j U.S.C. baseball series will be played
here tomorrow afternoon on the var
■ sity diamond. The Cards dropped the
first two contests to the Trojans by
! one-run margins, but might clear the
last hurdle behind some good pitch
' ing.
Bill Simkins will probably be Coach
i Harry Welter's choice to start on the
'mound against the Trojans tomorrow.
Simkins chucked a winning game in
the second contest against the Tro
j jane, but received very poor support
from tlie Cardinal fielders.
The loss of Ralph Cook at first base
was a severe blow to the Card infield,
; as it will be hard to replace this fine
fielding player on the initial sack. As
was demonstrated in the Cal game, the
inability of the Card keystone com
bination to handle cut-off plays leaves
, a woefully weak spot in the infield.
More than once, Churchill and John
-1 son have failed to handle clean throws
I to the bag, and consequently left the
! pitcher in a bad hole.
The Cards still have a chance to
pull out of the cellar in the California
1 Intercollegiate Baseball Conference,
j if they can take their remaining con
j tests, but this is rather improbable
l after their showing so far this sea
| son.
