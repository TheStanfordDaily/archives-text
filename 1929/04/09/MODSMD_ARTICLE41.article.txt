# SPORTS OF 1929
## The 						Moist-Ball Twins 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
"Mysterious Mr. Mitchell," of the
St. Louis Cardinals, and'formerly of
Cincinnati, Brooklyn, and the Phillies,
is to have, as a playmate and "fellow
spitter" this year, "Wild William"
Doak, also formerly of Cincinnati and
Brooklyn, but not formerly of the
Phillies. All spit-ball pitchers are pe
culiar and, as the race is gradually
getting as extinct as the dodo bird,
the fact that one club in the National
League has two of the breed on its
active list, must prove something or
other. Probably it's the reason for the
floods in the Mississippi valley near
St. Louis.
Mr. Mitchell's success, in spite of
being a spit-ball pitcher, is all the
more remarkable when you consider
the fact that he is also left-handed.
None of the other spit-ball hurlers
are southpaws. Bill Doak certainly
isn't. Neither is Burleigh Grimes of
the Athletics. Aud then Mr. Mitchell's
first name â€”it's Clarence, you know,
and he's lived that down pretty well
too. Clarence Mitchell was born on
February 22 (which accounts for his

success, I guess), 1891, tin Nebraska,
1 while Bill Doak was born three and a
half weeks earlier in Pittsburgh (Pitts- 1
burgh being about the only National
League club he hasn't worked for).
Being the elder, Bill got into the
i majors first, pitching for the Reds j
back in 1912. When Clarence arrived
as a Red rookie in 191G, Bill was with
| dear old St. Louis, where he stayed
until sometime in 1924. Mitchell, after !
J many harrowing experiences with j
i Brooklyn and the Phillies, finally
1 reached the Cards in 1928, but Doak
had gone from there four years be
fore to Brooklyn where Clarence used I
to be. Now they are together at last,
a right- and a left-handed spit-ball
pitcher on one team. How can the
Cardinals win now?
