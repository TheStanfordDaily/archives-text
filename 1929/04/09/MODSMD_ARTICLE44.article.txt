championship ball chuckers of each
league will battle it out for the mural
playground ball title.
The student mural committee de
cided to introduce "soft" ball into the
sports program because of the fact
that several of the campus living
groups were opposed to regulation
baseball. Lack of interest by these
objecting teams caused a consider
able number of forfeited games in past
years. It is hoped by the student
committee that the new sport will
revive interest in the spring program.

follows: Thursday, Kappa Alpha vs.
Kappa Sigma, Encina 1W vs. Phi
Kappa Psi, Encina 4E vs. Zeta Psi,
