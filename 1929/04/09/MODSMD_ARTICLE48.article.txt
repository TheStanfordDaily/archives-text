"It is the destiny of the American
Women to give Peace to the World,"
said Mrs. Kathleen Norris in her talk
at the regular monthly meeting of the ,
Faculty Women's Club yesterday af- j
ternoon in the Women's Clubhouse.
"Peace should be considered as an !
economic problem. European nations
cannot exist without the commerce of j
the United States, therefore the loss :
of trade for any country is a threat j
sufficiently powerful to prevent war. i
Money has too long been considered j
of more value than life."
The only way to understand World
Peace is to read about and to under- !
stand the World War, she said. Mrs. J
Norris believes that Dr. David Starr
, Jordan has done more for the cause j
of World Peace than any other man ;
l'ving.
"The time to prepare for peace is
during the time of peace, for peace !
; thoughts are not uttered in war time, j
It is going to take great courage and i
j great sacrifice to go into World Peace. ,
; All through the centuries European j
! countries have had conventional j
squabbles. There is no cause in the
j world for war.
