# Literary Magazine Opens Tryouts Today For Staff
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Stanford Literary
Magazine will be held in the Lit office
in the Press Building from 3:30 to 5
p.m. today, tomorrow, and Thursday.
Any student, preferably sophomores,
may try out for positions in the ad
vertising, circulation, or credit depart
ments. Tryoutees who show ability
will become regular members of the
stafT in May.
In working for the Lit, one gains
experience in business contacts with
outside firms, business letter writing,
circulation, accounting methods, and
in soliciting advertising.
A tryoutee's work consists of typ
ing letters, mailing, Quad sales, and
general office work. He then becomos
eligible for the management of his
department, and from the list of ad
vertising managers a business mana
ger is chosen. Ability to type is not
necessary but advantageous.
