What with everything from melo
dramas to Junior Operas coming in
for a royal spoofing, Thursday's Thea
tre Fund Follies promises to be the
roost rollicking show of the year.
No less than four mad burlesques
will add a note of nose-thumbing sa
tire to a program already loaded with
the comic element, and the combined
talent of Ram's Head, Sword and San
dals, each member with a slapstick
in hand, will frisk through nearly two
hours of the sort of stuff that will rock
the ancient Assembly Hall, which the
Fund hopes to relegate to the ash
heap.
"For the Honor of Old Texas," by
Nels Carter, the recently elected po
tentate of the Masque Ball, and James
Webb, will be a leading skit.
"The Triumph of Co-operation," a
pageant, will follow the overture. It
will adhere strictly to the perform
ance of the original company—the
Ladies' Aid Society of the Third
Street Methodist-Episcopal Church of
Keokuk.
Those who have heard of Mister
O'Neill's tabloid play—"Strange Inter
lude" —will be pleased to learn that
Messrs. Paine and Arnsteiu have con
cocted a skit similar to O'Neill's dra
matic masterpiece. This pair of dra
matists act their thoughts rather than
speak them.
"The Student Quince," by request
of the Fruit Growers' Union, has been
changed to "Swiss Cheese Preferred,"
a title which unfortunately has been
found to resemble that of last year's
Junior Opera. The opus itself, it is
said, also follows the '28 plot with
certain ramifications.
Then that trite and true vaudeville
act —"The Master Ventriloquist"—will
be given a faithful interpretation by
Prof. P. Speegle and Hal Conroy.
The note of music will not be over
looked, for included in the program
wfll be a reminiscent act in which
Helen Ward, Edwina Ewing, Kathleen
Fitz, and Fenton Barrett will sing
hits of former Stanford shows. Then,
too, Miss Fitz will sing with Lee Flood
in a second musical act.
Larry Staley's banjoing and a piano
duet by Neil Spaulding and Griff Wil
liams, as well as a dance by Kathleen
Fitz and Stan Mullin, will help to
make the Follies memorable.
"A Radio Fiasco," a satire which
tickled the customers at the 1928
Football Gaieties will be offered again
by Paul Speegle and Burnell Gould.
