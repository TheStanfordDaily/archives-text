STANFORD GOLF COURSE
1. If the proposed golf course is constructed on the Stanford campus will
you probably use it?
2. If so, check which one of the three student privileges you will probably
use:
(a) Three-month playing privilege $15
(b) One-month playing privilege ? 6
(c) Occasional playing by payment of green fee
Signing this will not in any way obligate you. The Board of Athletic
Control merely desires an estimate of the number of students who will
use the course. Either mail this coupon to the Hoard of Athletic Control
or deposit it in one of the special boxes at the l'ostoffice or on the Quad.
