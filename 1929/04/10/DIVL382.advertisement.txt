WATERPROOF CLOTHING
You can't imagine a college man without
wet weather protection.
This new "Forain", a zephyr-weight coat
—is the very latest thing in rain wear.
Smart — Correctly Tailored —
Lightest weight and are made absolutely
waterproof by the famous Sawyer process.
You will find "Forain" coats at your pop
ular shop in company with several new
models of Frog Brand Slickers which have
been favorites for so many years.
