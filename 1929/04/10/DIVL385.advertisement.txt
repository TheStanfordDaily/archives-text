The Woman Who Drives
is dependent for her safety on the
: alertness of her vision. She must see
quickly and clearly to act quickly. To
! drive with imperfect or faulty vision
| is to invite accident, with possible
I injury to self and others. Whether or
not you drive a car, be sure of your
eyesight—if in doubt as to its effi
ciency, see us.
