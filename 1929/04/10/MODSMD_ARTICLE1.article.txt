### 
WASHINGTON, April 9. (/P)—For
mer Vice-President Charles G. Dawes
has been selected by President Hoover
as ambassador to Great Britain and
formal announcement awaits only
word from London that he is accept
able to the British government.
While White House officials de
clined to discuss the matter in any
May, it became known today that Gen
eral Dawes' name has been presented
to the British Foreign Office through
the American Embassy as is the usual
custom before a diplomatic appoint
ment is made.
Friends of both the Administration
and the General have no doubt that
the appointment will be acceptable
to the British and formal announce
ment that the former vice-president
will succeed Alanson B. Houghton, of
New York, is expected within a few
<lays.
General Dawes now is in Santo Do
mingo as head of a mission reorganiz
ing the finances of that West Indian
Republic and he will complete that
work before proceeding to England.
This is expected to take about five
weeks more.
Negotiations looking to the sending
of the General to the London post
began while Mr. Dawes still was vice
president and Herbert Hoover was
president-elect. Before that, however,',
the General had agreed to head the
mission to Santo Domingo and lie
made it a condition of his acceptance
of the diplomatic appointment he
should be permitted to finish *he
job in Santo Domingo.
Ambassador Houghton plan.-, t >v. i
sail from London for the United Stat i
on April 27 and after his departure
ihe Embassy will be in ch:irg,e of the
charge d'affaires. Mr. Houghton re
signed as ambassador to Gre?u Britain
in order to make the race foir senator
from New York last year.
President Coolidge acknowledged
receipt of the letter of 'resignation
without accepting the resignation and
rifter Mr. Houghton was defeated he
was asked to return to /the London
post for the remainder of 'the Coolidge
administration. This he did with re
luctance as he long had planned a trip
to South America.
President Hoover and General
Dawes have been w arm personal
triends for many y.-ars-i having come
in close contact during t he immediate
post-war years wh lhe now Chief
Executive was feet iif- ; ij,a nations of
Europe and Mr. E v, „ s was serV ing
