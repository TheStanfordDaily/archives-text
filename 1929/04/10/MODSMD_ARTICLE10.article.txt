# COMMITEE ASKS FOR LARGE SUM TO SAVE WATER
## Recommends Expenditure of $109,000,000 on Flood Control Program 
### 
SACRAMENTO, April 9. (£>)—' The
long-awaited iinal report of the joint
legislative committee on water conser
vation and development, fruit of two
years' study, was made public today.
Adhering for the most part to a
preliminary report made in January,
the recommendations of the commit
tee call for the immediate expenditure
of $109,000,000 and the mapping of one
of the most ambitious conservation,
flood control, and reclamation pro
grams ever attempted by a state.
By catching and storing flood waters
and releasing them at ebb periods to
the arid lowlands, the state, in effect,
would lend $109,000,000 for the con
struction of a gigantic plumbing sys
tem; faucets at Kennett dam and the
Sacramento river mouth serving to
furnish water in the same fashion it
is furnished for human use in home
spigots—when needed.
Recommendations of the majority
report urge the early authorization ol'
a bond issue for the construction of
Kennet dam and reservoir, at a cost
of $70,000,000; the construction of
levees and pumps along the San Joa
quin to divert excess waters of the
Sacramento into the valley of the San
Joaqin to cost $24,000,000, and the
complete development of the Santa
Ana river toward the interests of
flood control and conservation to cost
$30,000,000; this cost to be borne half
and half by the state and the inter
ested districts.
The financial burden, though nomi
nally upon the state, would be bo*ne
eventually, the report predicted, by
users of electricity developed at Ken
nett and of water sold to industrial
firms at and near Carquinez straits
and to deficient regions.
