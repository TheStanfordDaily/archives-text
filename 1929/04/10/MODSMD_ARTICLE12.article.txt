# American Peace Trend Praised By Dutch Diplomat On Western Visit
## 
### 
"We do not regard t the Kellogg
Treaty as a great step forward in the
march to international peace," said
J. H. van Royen, royal ambassador
from the Netherlands to the United
States, who visited the campus yester
day afternoon with a party from the
Dutch consulate in San Francisco.
"However, in Europe, it is held as
an advance in the march to the goal
of friendly relations throughout the
world, and, as such, must be held in
respect."
The ambassador spoke with great
warmth of the recent trend toward
peace among American people. He ex
pressed the hope that the United
States would soon be a member of
the League of Nations. "The only rea
son why you are not affiliated with
the League today is that there is a
widespread misunderstanding. Former
President Wilson, who practically
founded the League, put the issue of

America's entry into it on a political
basis. The misunderstanding caused
by this action is now the sole reason
for America's failure to become a
League member."
llerr van Royen, ;concluding his
visit, remarked on the beauty of the
Stanford campus, "combining the
grace and charm of Spain and Italy
with the activity and efficiency of
America."
Western universities, he pointed
out, have not the traditions and color
ful background of European institu
tions. "At Utrecht and Leyden and
Amsterdam, we have not the new
beauty of your American colleges, but
we do have our valued traditions.
Leyden, for example, which was given
to Holland by the grateful William of
Orange, was established in the seven
teenth century and has the back
ground which comes only after years
of existence."
