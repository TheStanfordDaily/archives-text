# MASTERS ANNOUNCES I.C.4-A. SANCTION BY FACULTY, B. OF A.C.
## Cardinal Track Team Meets Southern Conference Stars Saturday 
### 
Stanford will again defend the
I.C.A.A.A.A. title she has held for two
consecutive years, according to an
nouncement made by A1 Masters, gen
em 1 manager of the Stanford Board
of Athletic Control yesterday.
Full approval was given by the fac
ulty board of control at a meeting held
yesterday. According to the present
schedule the Card team will leave for
Franklin Field, Philadelphia, the lat
ter part of May where they will par
ticipate in the track and field cham
pionships held there May 31 and
June 1.
Coach Dink Templeton's victorious
Cardinal track team, already assured
of the Pacific Coast championship, has
four more meets scheduled for the
1929 season. First comes the dual en
counter with the Southern Conference
All-Stars in the Stadium this coming
Saturday, next the Big Meet on the
following Saturday, then the four
cornered meet with U.S.C., U.C.L.A.,
and California in Los Angeles May 18,
and finally the 1.C.4-A. meet in Phila
delphia May 31 and June 1.
In all of these meets the Cards will
be the favorites. Next Saturday's All-
Star meet will provide some interest
ing races, but Stanford's supremacy
will not be seriously challenged. The
University of * California team,
trounced by U.S.C. and the Olympic
Club, will offer little more opposition
than the All-Stars. However, the four
cornered meet will probably resolve
itself into another Stanford-U.S.C.
struggle with anything likely to hap
pen.
Templeton's men are again favored
to capture their third consecutive
1.C.4-A. championship. Scorers of 30
of Stanford's 43 points last year at
Boston are still in school and turning
in winning performances. Bob King,
Bud Spencer, and Kim Dyer were the
only ones lost through graduation.
Eric Krenz. Harlow Rothert, Ward
Edmonds, Bik Sparling, Leo Kibby,
Captain Ross Nichols, Fred Zombro,
and A1 Forster, all point-winners in
the 1928 1.C.4-A. Championships, are
still competing for the Cardinal.
