# CARDINAL NINE WINS FROM U.S.C. OUTFIT IN ONE-SIDED GAME
## Bill Simkins Holds Trojans To Five Safe Blows as Cards Get Eleven 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team !
hopped out of its slump and plastered
a 6 to 1 defeat on the U.S.C. nine |
here yesterday. Bill Simkins pitched
a brilliant game for the Cards, letting j
the Trojans down with but five scat- j
tered hits, and only once during the
contest permitted a man to pass sec- j
ond base.
The Cards started the scoring in
the first inning, when John Hunken
got a long hit to left center and !
scored on a passed ball by Tarchonie, J
Trojan third-sacker. Stanford tallied j
twice in the second on a hit by Laird, '
a pass to Wright, and a hit by Wilton. |
Blows by Hardy and Johnson brought j
the count up to four in the next |
round, and the final runs were scored j
in the eighth inning on an error and j
three safe hits.
The Trojans made their run in the ;
sixth, when Stanier doubled to left i
field and was sacrificed home by j
Tarchonie. During the rest of the con
test the U.S.C. batsmen were helpless
against the curves and fast ones
dished out by Simkins.
The Cards showed up better at the
plate yesterday than in some time.
Harry Berg was high man with three
for four, Bill Laird collected two for
three, and Captain Frank Wilton two
for four. One of Wilton's blows went
for three bases.

hopped out of its slump and plastered
a 6 to 1 defeat on the U.S.C. nine |
here yesterday. Bill Simkins pitched
a brilliant game for the Cards, letting j
the Trojans down with but five scat- j
tered hits, and only once during the
contest permitted a man to pass sec- j
ond base.
The Cards started the scoring in
the first inning, when John Hunken
got a long hit to left center and !
scored on a passed ball by Tarchonie, J
Trojan third-sacker. Stanford tallied j
twice in the second on a hit by Laird, '
a pass to Wright, and a hit by Wilton. |
Blows by Hardy and Johnson brought j
the count up to four in the next |
round, and the final runs were scored j
in the eighth inning on an error and j
three safe hits.
The Trojans made their run in the ;
sixth, when Stanier doubled to left i
field and was sacrificed home by j
Tarchonie. During the rest of the con
test the U.S.C. batsmen were helpless
against the curves and fast ones
