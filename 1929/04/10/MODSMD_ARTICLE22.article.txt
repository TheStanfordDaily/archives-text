# What The Deans Think

"The American 'collegiate' of the stage and the comic papers con
stitutes an unimportant fraction of the American college youth, and his
idiosyncracies are 'high school stuff' indulged in frequently by irre
sponsibles who are not even students at any college." This is the con
census of opinion expressed by deans and presidents of three hundred
universities and colleges and obtained by questionnaires sent out by
Henry Grattan Doyle, Dean of Men of George Washington University.
In Dean Doyle's report the following statement was made by Dean
Culver: "The 'collegiate' is fast disappearing, and there is a noticeable
change during recent years as to improved personal appearance and
dress. The so-called 'collegiate' does not long survive at Stanford. The
present generation in reality works much harder than the early college
generations because the world requires better-trained men and women."
Misogynists might well note the reply of all deans of co-educational
institutions to the question, "What effect do women have on the student
body?" Without exception the answer was that the presence of women
students on the campus had a pronounced good effect upon the personal
appearance and conduct of male students.
The little matter so often thrown in the face of the present generation
in regard to its trend toward "the dogs, ' was definitely cleared by the
deans' replies. They were of the opinion that the present generation
compares quite favorably in ideals and conduct with past generations,
and furthermore, this present generation does more work than its fathers
did. Write that home.
Dean Doyle endeavored to find a correlation between the five prob
lems: drinking, "necking," neglect of classwork, dishonesty in examina
tions, and other ethical problems, and the 'collegiate,' already declared a
negligible factor in the modern university. His endeavor was futile.
Half the deans saw a definite connection between these problems and the
comic-strip student ; the other half saw none.
It is believed that these cardinal sins of the college student extend
back to the first student in the first university. The matter of "collegiate
ism" is of distinctly modern origin. What connection, but accidental,
could there be between them ?
One reply of a certain dean bears repetition. It will no doubt interest
most students. "There is a frivolous minority which does, I think, indulge
in drinking, necking, and the like." It might be said that perhaps the
vision of this dean is a bit myopic.
The work is an admirable one. Anything that will present a true pic
ture of the American university man and thus dispel the exaggerated
caricature generally accepted by the public is exceedingly commendable.
The report is very optimistic, perhaps too much so. No student could
read it without becoming convinced that he is a member of a Panglossian
generation which is the mainstay of the best of all possible college
worlds. Every student knows otherwise, but he cannot help but be
pleased to know that a real effort has been made to give the world an
accurate conception of what he is actually like.
