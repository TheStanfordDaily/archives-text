# "Intellectual Overproduction"
## 
### 
A problem of serious import to the college student is that set forth
in the following extracts from an editorial published in the April New
Student :
Unemployment of intellectuals is a problem that has not worried the
United States very much up to a year or so ago. But since the total yearly
output of our colleges has reached the staggering sum of 800,000 there has
been some talk about limiting enrollments. The fragmentary report of a yet
incomplete study made by Dr. Harold F. Clark of Teachers College, Columbia
University, promises to throw considerable light on the subject.
About 800,000 students are studying in our colleges, Dr. Clark says, and
a large proportion of these plan to enter the professions. The total employed
in these professions is only twice that number. "What will happen to the
professional salaries?" he asks, "when the number of college educated in
creases to 1,500,000, as it surely will." "You cannot train 100,000 people for
90,009 jobs without creating pressure to decrease the remuneration of the
90,000. Education is just as much a commodity as wheat and must be
governed by the law of economics. . . ."
The newspapers carried a fragmentary report of Dr. Clark's study, and
it is too soon to comment on it. But, statistics or no statistics, the complaint
that the colleges are gaining too mayy recruits for the white collar class is
now taking on the proportions of a counter-revolution against what the
authors of "Middletown" call the "dominant belief in the magic of formal
schooling."
Hitherto the assumption lias been unchallenged that if every boy did not
have a good chance of becoming president of the United States he had a
perfect one of obtaining a college education, and everyone ought to do his
best to speed him 011 the way. This sentiment is far from unanimous these
days. Every now and then a psychologist emerges from his laboratory with
the announcement that only a few are capable of being educated beyond the
rudiments of elementary learning. Members of various professions seeing
their provinces invaded by the hordes fresh from universities are taking up
the cry against mass education. Now it is the fashion to advocate an intellec
tual aristocracy; but somehow this aristocracy often gets confused with
another sort of aristocracy, based rather on monetary than intellectual power. ;

There will be an important meeting of the Daily staff tryoutees in the
Daily office at 12:45 today.
