Litany of Washington Street. By j
Vache! Lindsay. (New York: The j
Macmillan Company. $3.)
"Walt Whitman's birthday is too j
solemnly celebrated by long-haired,
squeaky highbrows at. sad, dirty, and j
radical 'banquets'," says Vachel Lind
say.
Whitman is one of the great Ameri-1
cans celebrated by Lindsay—along
with Washington, Jefferson, and Lin
coln —in his new "Litany of Washing-'
ton Street." But Lindsay regards i
Whitman as a statesman-poet, not a i
hero, "for Whitman has no chivalry," j
and in America, says Lindsay, "all
men must be equal, but all little girls ;
must be queens." Whitman has no j

heroines. "Ann Rutledge is nearer to
being our ultimate queen than all the
glad Jezebels of Whitman. There is
not one valentine in him. And ours
is a land of valentines, white lace
valentines."
This new book of Lindsay's is full
of keen, provocative paragraphs that
will arouse laughter but leave behind
a barb of doubt as to some of our
standards and enthusiasms.
One reader of the book classifies it
"as a sort of poetic or prophetic rhap
sody on the true Americanism of
Washington and Jefferson as con
trasted with the sham variety so con
spicuous these days in our 100 per
cent patrioteers."
