The Editor, Sir:
Winston Norman is running out of
controversial subjects—that is, sub
jects which provoke lots of heated
talk, and consequently much notoriety
for the enterprising author of "Bull
session." He is forced to air again his
grudge against organized religion,
recognizing that in such a subject he
possesses an unfailing method of stir
ring up the grandest possible display
of hates, prejudices, stupidity, and
bitterness.
His article, "Mixed Blessings," rains
further blows upon a Christianity
which he views as already down and
out, prostrate under such parasitic
"trappings as Heaven and Hell, the
divinity of Christ, Jonah and the
whale, and the like." Since to Mr.
Norman, Christianity, a mass of bosh,
and trappings, and ballyhoo, is totter
ing on its last legs, his purpose is
surely not to overthrow a mythology
which has already been overthrown.
But he knows that, notwithstanding
the conquests of science and reason,
there are some sentimental souls

clinging to the discredited religion [
who may write letters to "Campus
Opinion;" thus perhaps, precipitating j
a delightful little controversy, with ;
its attendant publicity.
This letter, then, is admittedly a
bite on Mr. Norman's bait. But it does j
not propose to do the unnecessary, '
and point out the obvious fallacies, ;
misunderstandings, and bias in his |
article. To anyone at all informed '
about the Christian Religion the arti- j
cle is not only wholly ineffective, but j
rather amusing in its naivete. To the j
uninformed, it may be deceptive. At
any rate, the subject calls attention J
to the fact that a course of five popu
lar lectures are being given this quar
ter on "The Origin and Early History :
of Christianity," Accu.rp.te and un- j
biased information on the beginnings j
and teachings of Christianity will be j
presented in a popular manner by :
men highly qualified to give it. Those ;
who wish to know the truth about
the religion which Mr. Norman lam- j
poons so frequently would do well to
hear these lectures. —S. R.

further blows upon a Christianity
which he views as already down and
out, prostrate under such parasitic
"trappings as Heaven and Hell, the
divinity of Christ, Jonah and the
whale, and the like." Since to Mr.
Norman, Christianity, a mass of bosh,
and trappings, and ballyhoo, is totter
ing on its last legs, his purpose is
surely not to overthrow a mythology
which has already been overthrown.
But he knows that, notwithstanding
the conquests of science and reason,
there are some sentimental souls

clinging to the discredited religion [
who may write letters to "Campus
Opinion;" thus perhaps, precipitating j
a delightful little controversy, with ;
its attendant publicity.
This letter, then, is admittedly a
bite on Mr. Norman's bait. But it does j
not propose to do the unnecessary, '
and point out the obvious fallacies, ;
misunderstandings, and bias in his |
article. To anyone at all informed '
about the Christian Religion the arti- j
cle is not only wholly ineffective, but j
rather amusing in its naivete. To the j
uninformed, it may be deceptive. At
any rate, the subject calls attention J
to the fact that a course of five popu
lar lectures are being given this quar
ter on "The Origin and Early History :
of Christianity," Accu.rp.te and un- j
biased information on the beginnings j
and teachings of Christianity will be j
presented in a popular manner by :
men highly qualified to give it. Those ;
who wish to know the truth about
the religion which Mr. Norman lam- j
poons so frequently would do well to
hear these lectures. —S. R.
The Editor, Sir:
Winston Norman is running out of
controversial subjects—that is, sub
jects which provoke lots of heated
talk, and consequently much notoriety
for the enterprising author of "Bull
session." He is forced to air again his
grudge against organized religion,
recognizing that in such a subject he
possesses an unfailing method of stir
ring up the grandest possible display
of hates, prejudices, stupidity, and
bitterness.
His article, "Mixed Blessings," rains
further blows upon a Christianity
which he views as already down and
out, prostrate under such parasitic
"trappings as Heaven and Hell, the
divinity of Christ, Jonah and the
whale, and the like." Since to Mr.
Norman, Christianity, a mass of bosh,
and trappings, and ballyhoo, is totter
ing on its last legs, his purpose is
surely not to overthrow a mythology
