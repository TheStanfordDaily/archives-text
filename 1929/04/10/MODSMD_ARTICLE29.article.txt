Four hard-hitting contests opened
up the annual intramural baseball
Bt ries yesterday afternoon on the ■
mural ball diamonds.
Coming from behind a five-run han
dicap in the last half of the seventh
inning, Sigma Nu nosed out Delta Chi ;
in the most exciting game of the day, ;
v»hen it tallied seven runs in a rally !
of extra-base hits. The game was full
of glaring errors, a total of fifteen j
misplays being made in the seven in- j
nings of play. Kim Dyer pitched er- i
ratic ball for the winners, but led the j
batters with a triple and a couple of
singles.
Playing flashy baseball behind the
speed ball pitching of Johnnie Tru- i
man, the Barbarians walked off witli
an easy victory over the A.T.O.'s.
Fraaer and Mainwaring, hefty batters
for the Barbarians, featured the con- j
test with a home run each.
El Campo piled up an early lead to i
w in from Theta Chi in a ragged game \
of ball. Burnell Gould led the hitting i
with three timely hits, one of them J
being a slashing four-bagger. Theta j
Chi executed a neat double play in
the fourth inning, Brown to Freeman. ;
Although Dick Bogue made the j
most spectacular play of the day, an j
unassisted double play, the Breakers i
went down to a one-sided defeat at
the hands of a fast-playing Sequoia' I :
outfit. The eating club boys were j
weak at the bat, while the Sequoia
batters pounded the offerings of Stan
Cook all over the field for twelve safe :
blows.
The schedule for today follows:
Chi Psi vs. Phi Sigs, El Toro vs. Phi
Delts, Betas vs. El Tigre, Enema 2E
vs. Alpha Delts.
