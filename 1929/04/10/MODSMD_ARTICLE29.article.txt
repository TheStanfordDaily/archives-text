# SIGMA NU RALLIES IN LAST INNING TO TAKE INTRAMURAL OPENER
## Hard Hitting Features All Four Games; Bogue in Spectacular Play 
### 
Sigma Nu 15, Theta Delta Chi 13
Barbarians 9, Alpha Tau Omega 3
El Campo 13, Theta Chi 7
Sequoia I 11, Breakers 1
Four hard-hitting contests opened
up the annual intramural baseball
series yesterday afternoon on the
mural ball diamonds.
Coming from behind a five-run han
dicap in the last half of the seventh
inning, Sigma Nu nosed out Delta Chi
in the most exciting game of the day,
when it tallied seven runs in a rally
of extra-base hits. The game was full
of glaring errors, a total of fifteen
misplays being made in the seven in-
nings of play. Kim Dyer pitched er-
ratic ball for the winners, but led the
batters with a triple and a couple of
singles.
Playing flashy baseball behind the
speed ball pitching of Johnnie Tru-
man, the Barbarians walked off with
an easy victory over the A.T.O.'s.
Fraser and Mainwaring, hefty batters
for the Barbarians, featured the con-
test with a home run each.
El Campo piled up an early lead to
win from Theta Chi in a ragged game
of ball. Burnell Gould led the hitting
with three timely hits, one of them
being a slashing four-bagger. Theta
Chi executed a neat double play in
the fourth inning, Brown to Freeman.
Although Dick Bogue made the
most spectacular play of the day, an
unassisted double play, the Breakers
went down to a one-sided defeat at
the hands of a fast-playing Sequoia I
outfit. The eating club boys were
weak at the bat, while the Sequoia
batters pounded the offerings of Stan
Cook all over the field for twelve safe
blows.
The schedule for today follows:
Chi Psi vs. Phi Sigs, El Toro vs. Phi
Delts, Betas vs. El Tigre, Encina 2E
vs. Alpha Delts.
