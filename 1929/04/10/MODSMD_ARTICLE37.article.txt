# "Mr. Moneypenny" Is Read By Mrs. Brown Last Night

"Gimme! Money! Millions! Billions! '
Gimme!" are the cries of the age '
as shown in Channing Pollock's play, '
"Mr. Moneypenny," read by Mrs.
Hugh Brown in the Assembly Hall
last night.
The play is a satire on modern life !
with its insatiable desires for thrills i
and money, each the cause and efl'ect 1
of the other. In the finale, Mr. Jones
iorsakes his taskmaster, Mr. Money- i
penny, after giving up everything in
an attempt to meet his requirements, i
but the number of followers of his ;
former God do not diminish.
In every social Institution, divorce â€¢
court, justice of the peace, or police
court, and in every form of business,
brokerage or beauty shop, wealth is j
the paramount interest. Mrs. Brown 1
interpreted the spirit of the play ex- :
ceedingly well and brought out its I
keen humor.
