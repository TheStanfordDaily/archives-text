# SELECT FOUR WOMEN FOR IMPORTANT U.S.C. DEBATE NEXT MONTH
## 
### 
The four women chosen last night
to represent Stanford in the most im
portant debate of the year, that with
the University of Southern California,
were Alice Behner, Hallien Hickman,
Jean Magnus, and Isabell Warren.
The question upon which the try
outees spoke was, "Resolved, That
the plea of temporary insanity as a
defense of crime should be prohibited
by law," the same question as will
be used in the final debate on May 2.
Miss Behner and Miss Warren will
uphold the affirmative at U.S.C., while
Miss Hickman and Miss Magnus are
speaking on the negative in the Little
Theatre here against a team from the
southern school.
Judges or the tryouts were Miss
Edith Mirrielees, Prof. Emerson of the
public speaking department, and Jus
tus W. Barger of the English depart
ment, who will coach the women's
teams.
