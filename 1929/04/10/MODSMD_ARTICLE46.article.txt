ministration officials have reached the
opinion that the proposed union of
the Radio Corporation of America
Communications, Inc., witli the Inter
national Telephone and Telegraph
Company is prohibited by the last
radio law and is a matter'that must
go to Congress.
The proposed merger was announced
several weeks ago although the Davis
Radio Law specifically prohibits any
combination of wire and radio com
panies. It was said at the time that
it was not felt by officials of the two
companies that the outright purchase
of the Radio Corporation's communi
cation system would come under the
provisions of the Radio Act.
