# SINCLAIR TO ENTER JAIL
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 9. (fi*)—When i
Harry F. Sinclair changes his name
for a number, as it now seems he
must, he will find about 500 summer
clubbers— at the Washington asylum
and jail—ready to welcome him into
their simple life of laundering and
window-washing and dominoes with
slightly indifferent informality.

A boy, 3 years old, and a girl, 4,
j were found intoxicated on a street
in New York.
