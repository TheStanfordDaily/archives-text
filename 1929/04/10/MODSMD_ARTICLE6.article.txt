# Symphony To Play Tonight Under Hertz
## San Francisco Orchestra to Render Final Concert Of A.S.S.U. Series 
### 
Alfred Hertz will conduct the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in the
final concert on the A.S.S.U. Series
this evening at 8:15 in the Stanford
Pavilion.
Most of Hertz's musical education
was gained in Germany where he was
born. In 1902 he went to New York
as conductor of German Opera at the
Metropolitan, but in 1910 he conducted
"Gotterdammerung" and other Wag
nerian performances at Convent Gar
dons owing to the retirement through
illness of Richter. Since 1915 Hertz
has been conductor of the San Fran
ciso Symphony Orchestra.
The enthusiasm with which the
Hertz concert was received here last
year has caused its being brought back
in this series.
The program will consist of:
Overture to Rienzi Wagner
Symphony Number 7 Glazounow
Overture to Midsummer's Night
Dream Mendelssohn
Minuet Boccherini
Entr'acte from Rosamunde....Schubert
Andante Cantabile Tschaikowsky
Hungarian Rhapsody Number I.Liszt
