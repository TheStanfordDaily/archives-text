# Stanford Instructor Evolves New Substitute For Milk Sterilization

(Editor's Note: This is the third of a !
series of articles on research work at
Stanford. Dr. Leighton, instructor in
chemistry, came to the camf>us in 1928.
He holds degrees from Pomona and Har
vard, and spent last year in study at
Munich.)

Milk, one of man's great food prod- j
nets, may soon be brought to its mil-\
lions of consumers in a form more j
tasty, more acceptable in odor —and j
more economical.
Pasteurization, for six decades the j
method whereby milk has been pro- j
tected from typhoid and tuberculosis |
bacteria, faces scrapping in favor of
a new and a more efficient process,
in which electricity plays the chief
role.
For years, dairymen have used pas
teurization —the sterilization of milk
by heat —and have been unable to pre
vent the disagreeable taste which is
the main objection to pasteurized
milk. But milk treated in this way
was safe to drink, the disease germs
were for the most part killed, and I

the necessary nutritive qualities of
the milk retained.
Now comes Dr. Philip Leighton,
who, in his work on the various rays
given off by electricity, finds that one
of the rays—the ultra-violet —can kill
off the deadly typhoid germs in milk.
By passing a thin film of milk around
a series of glass tubes from which
ultra-violet rays are given off, the
germs can he killed without the ne- j
cessity of using the increased heat j
which causes the undesired taste.
The power of ultra-violet rays, these ;
invisible vibrations that have only I
lately aroused the interest of scien- j
tists the world over, is now fully j
recognized. With the rays, which Dr. I
Leighton produces by sending the
light from a mercury-arc lamp through
a huge quartz prism—one of the larg
est in the world, he claims —and cut
ting out the usual, but bothersome,
heal and light waves, he has at hand
the source of a myriad of amazing re-
! actions.
The very combination of a gas, car-
J bon dioxide, and water to form sugar
—the fundamental mechanism of the
world's food supply—is dependent on
ultra-violet rays. In every plant, this
j electrical stimulation is obtained from
j the sun. In the laboratory, using a thin
tube of mercury from which emanates
1 a blinding white light, these same
; rays may be turned into an artificial
! sun, giving off the priceless stimulus
that may cause the same gas and the
same water to form the same sugar—
I in short, a potential source of artificial
food.
i These same rays, from the original
| source, the sun, constantly provide
J the energy whereby Vitamin A is pro
duced in the human body. Doctors
may use the artificial rays in cases
of cancer, of baldness, of gastric
ulcers, of throat, ear, eye, and intes
tinal infections, and of rickets.
Industrial Uses Many
Industrial photochemists may use
them for determining the endurance
of paints, dyes, and varnishes. Fraudu
lent work and alterations in paint
ings, invisible by any other test, may
be determined by ultra-violet rays.
They may be used in the preparation
of salad and cooking oils, and in the
control of other factory processes.
But under the wrong conditions,
these same rays may become un
pleasant, if not highly dangerous, to
man. The much-admired coat of tan is
due to their action, as well as is the
equally distasteful coat of sunburn.
Eye cataract comes from too much
exposure to sunlight, and its accom
panying ultra-violet ray content.
"Kleig eye," bane of movie stars,
comes from the ultra-violet ray gen
erated within the Kleig light.
Here, then, is a new power rapidly
coming under the control of man. In
visible, difficult to direct, dangerous
to the researcher in its field, it has !
given only a few hints of its import- !
ance. With unsurpassed interest, sci- j
ence awaits its development.

an armless man recently left two |
notes of farewell before swallowing
poison.
