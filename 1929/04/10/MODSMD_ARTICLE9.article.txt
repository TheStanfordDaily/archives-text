Stanford. Dr. Leighton, instructor in

Milk, one of man's great food prod- j
nets, may soon be brought to its mil-\
lions of consumers in a form more j
tasty, more acceptable in odor —and j
more economical.
Pasteurization, for six decades the j
method whereby milk has been pro- j
tected from typhoid and tuberculosis |
bacteria, faces scrapping in favor of
a new and a more efficient process,
in which electricity plays the chief
role.
For years, dairymen have used pas
teurization —the sterilization of milk
by heat —and have been unable to pre
vent the disagreeable taste which is
the main objection to pasteurized
milk. But milk treated in this way
was safe to drink, the disease germs
were for the most part killed, and I

the necessary nutritive qualities of
the milk retained.
Now comes Dr. Philip Leighton,
who, in his work on the various rays
given off by electricity, finds that one
of the rays—the ultra-violet —can kill
off the deadly typhoid germs in milk.
By passing a thin film of milk around
a series of glass tubes from which
ultra-violet rays are given off, the
germs can he killed without the ne- j
cessity of using the increased heat j
which causes the undesired taste.
The power of ultra-violet rays, these ;
invisible vibrations that have only I
lately aroused the interest of scien- j
tists the world over, is now fully j
recognized. With the rays, which Dr. I
Leighton produces by sending the
light from a mercury-arc lamp through
a huge quartz prism—one of the larg
est in the world, he claims —and cut
ting out the usual, but bothersome,
heal and light waves, he has at hand
the source of a myriad of amazing re-
