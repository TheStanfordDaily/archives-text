# STATES DISCUSS IMPROVEMENT IN PROHIBITION LAW
## Legislatures of Illinois and Missouri Debate Change Of Enforcement 
### 
CHICAGO, April 10 OP). â€”Two new
state movements looking toward ameli
oration of the prohibition laws are under
way at present on the heels of the recent
referendum in Wisconsin. Illinois and
Missouri state legislatures are consider
ing measures for referenda on the wet
dry question.
Although ever since adoption of the
18th Amendment to the Federal Consti
tution and the passage of the Volstead
Act there has been agitation in numerous
state legislatures for measures affecting
the state enforcement of prohibition, def
inite action has been taken by only three
states.
New York, Nevada, Montana, and
Maryland are without state enforcement
acts, all but Maryland having repealed
them, while Maryland never adopted one j
as such.
Last week, Wisconsin by a majority of '
125,000 voted in a referendum to repeal
the Severson Act, state enforcement law.
Wisconsin voted for President Hoover
on a dry platform last year with almost
a 95,000 plurality.
Senator Thomas Duncan of Milwau
kee lost no time in taking steps to answer
the mandate of the Wisconsin electorate.
He has introduced a bill which he said
had votes enough to pass, that would re
peal the Severson Act, abolish the of
fice of Prohibition Commissioner, and
repeal the appropriation of the State
Prohibition Department and give to
towns and municipalities il. > power to
regulate the sale of intoxicating liquors.
