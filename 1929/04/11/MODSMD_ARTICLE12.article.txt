# PREPARE FOR CROWNING OF KING CARTER
## 
### 
(By The Court Tattler)
With the Masque Ball only one day
' in the offing, preparations are being
made for a giant broadcast of festivi
! ties by eighty stations located in all
parts of the world.
The Pluribus Unum Radio Corpora
! tion will be the main distributing
artery of the chain of six stations,
KOW, WEE, WOOF, KAN, KITM,
KWAK, who will give news of the
great event to millions.
Uncle Charlie has agreed to spike
the children's hour so as to give Gra
ham McCraker a chance to describe
the beauty of the Ball to his many
listeners in advance of the regular
program. The costumes and the coro
nation ceremonies will be described
; in detail by Graham himself, as will
the most minute features of the dazzl
ing fiesta.
I The Royal costumers will be on
I hand today and tomorrow until 5
j o'clock each afternoon to equip those
I who have not yet obtained something
appropriate in the way of apparel for
the Ball.
i Tomorrow night's event, the fifth
of these regal affairs, is to be the most
J elaborate coronation ever enjoyed by
i a king and queen destined to reign
i for only one night, according to their
majesties' court officials. Pomp and
ceremony are to be tempered by
strains of mirth, following the pre
| cepts of founders of the first ball, who
placed as a warning, over the door
of the Pavilion in 1923, the words,
"Abandon dignity all ye who enter
here."
Lest some of the prospective cour
tiers fear that the proper atmosphere
will not be maintained, it is promised
that, as at the valiant Mikado's court,
joy will be "quite refined" at tomor
row's Ball.
At the first Masque Balls, in 1923
and 1924, the identity of the king and
queen was kept a secret until the
time of their coronation, but those
i who attend this year's Ball are as
j sured that King Nels Carter and his
I queen, Elsie Chase, are to play the
I parts of benevolent monarchs seeking
| only the complete happiness of their
subjects. They are to set an example
of enlightened despotism fit to be
followed by the most generous rulers
of the world.
As no tickets are to be placed on
sale tomorrow, all who plan to attend
the Ball should purchase their bids
before 5 o'clock this afternoon.

(By The Court Tattler)
With the Masque Ball only one day
' in the offing, preparations are being
made for a giant broadcast of festivi
! ties by eighty stations located in all
parts of the world.
The Pluribus Unum Radio Corpora
! tion will be the main distributing
artery of the chain of six stations,
KOW, WEE, WOOF, KAN, KITM,
KWAK, who will give news of the
great event to millions.
Uncle Charlie has agreed to spike
the children's hour so as to give Gra
ham McCraker a chance to describe
the beauty of the Ball to his many
listeners in advance of the regular
program. The costumes and the coro
nation ceremonies will be described
; in detail by Graham himself, as will
the most minute features of the dazzl
ing fiesta.
I The Royal costumers will be on
I hand today and tomorrow until 5
j o'clock each afternoon to equip those
I who have not yet obtained something
appropriate in the way of apparel for
the Ball.
i Tomorrow night's event, the fifth
of these regal affairs, is to be the most
J elaborate coronation ever enjoyed by
i a king and queen destined to reign
i for only one night, according to their
majesties' court officials. Pomp and
ceremony are to be tempered by
strains of mirth, following the pre
| cepts of founders of the first ball, who
placed as a warning, over the door
of the Pavilion in 1923, the words,
"Abandon dignity all ye who enter
here."
Lest some of the prospective cour
tiers fear that the proper atmosphere
will not be maintained, it is promised
that, as at the valiant Mikado's court,
joy will be "quite refined" at tomor
row's Ball.
At the first Masque Balls, in 1923
and 1924, the identity of the king and
queen was kept a secret until the
time of their coronation, but those
i who attend this year's Ball are as
j sured that King Nels Carter and his
I queen, Elsie Chase, are to play the
I parts of benevolent monarchs seeking
| only the complete happiness of their
subjects. They are to set an example
of enlightened despotism fit to be
followed by the most generous rulers
of the world.
As no tickets are to be placed on
sale tomorrow, all who plan to attend
the Ball should purchase their bids
before 5 o'clock this afternoon.
