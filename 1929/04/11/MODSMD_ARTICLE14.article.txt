# CHAPPIE MEETS BIG MEET WITH BETTER BATCH OF CHUCKLES
## 
### 
"Anyone who wouldn't put out
a quarter to buy the biggest half
dollar's worth of Chaparral In
history, would cheat a blind
widow of her last cow," averred
that silly fellow better known as
the Old Boy, when cornered in
his private lair yesterday and in
terviewed on the Big Meet issue.
"The current Chappie, out to
day." the sly one continued, "is
the biggest book in campus his
tory. With a red-hot cover by
Grogor Duncan, 48 pages of jokes,
short skits, and drawings by the
most talented campus artists,
easy-reading advertisements, and
reprinted jokes, the magazine is
a steal at twice the price.
"Don't forget to give your little
girl a hand," he concluded with
a final wave of his tie-cheater.
"Every Chappie you buy from
her puts the dear closer to win
ning the big prize for the most
Chappies sold during the year.
And be sure to attend the Thea
tre Fund Follies and make that
New Theatre for Stanford come
a little nearer.
