# ALUMNI ARE INTERESTED IN NEW THEATRE, SAYS DAVIS
##

"Our ideal for the School of the Thea
ter at Stanford will have as its nucleus
the new theater for which funds are now
being raised," Gordon Davis, director of
dramatics, said. "Around this building,
or even in it, would be the offices, labora
tories, and classrooms of a complete
school of the theater, patterned after that
at Yale, which is today the leading uni
versity in dramatic work."
This new theater would soon take its
place as the cultural center of the penin
sula community, he explained. Already,
despite the many discomforts of the anti
quated Assembly Hall, Stanford dra
matics draw a large share of their audi
ences from the peninsula communities,
from Hurlingame to San Jose. With a
new comfortable theater, with a large
foyer or club-rooms where audiences
may gather during the rntr' actcs, be
said that Stanford productions would not
only draw more and more peninsula res- i
idents to their performances, but also
that the theater would become a social, j
as well as a cultural, center.
"Since the movement started to raise |
funds for an adequate theater on the I
campus," be continued, "I have bad many
encouraging letters from alumni who I

used to he well known in campus dra
matics. Among the alumni groups in
large cities which are interested in the
New Theater Fund is the one in New
York City. Lester Vail, who distin
guished himself here a few years ago in
our production of 'Hamlet' in modern
dress, is at the head of one of these
groups in New York, and he expects to
start active work this month in interest
ing people in the New Theater Fund. He
is probably the first alumnus to start this
active work."
Davis also said that there is a possi
bility that during the summer, when Vail
comes to the Coast for the Bohemian
Club play, he may give a benefit per
formance of Maxwell Anderson's "Gyp
j sy," his current New York success.

remarked, among them being Cornell,
Princeton, and Montana. The University

Theater patterned after Yale's, but while

Theater patterned after Yale's, but while

"Our ideal for the School of the Thea
ter at Stanford will have as its nucleus
the new theater for which funds are now
being raised," Gordon Davis, director of
dramatics, said. "Around this building,
or even in it, would be the offices, labora
tories, and classrooms of a complete
school of the theater, patterned after that
at Yale, which is today the leading uni
versity in dramatic work."
This new theater would soon take its
place as the cultural center of the penin
sula community, he explained. Already,
despite the many discomforts of the anti
quated Assembly Hall, Stanford dra
matics draw a large share of their audi
ences from the peninsula communities,
from Hurlingame to San Jose. With a
new comfortable theater, with a large
foyer or club-rooms where audiences
may gather during the rntr' actcs, be
said that Stanford productions would not

idents to their performances, but also
that the theater would become a social, j
as well as a cultural, center.
