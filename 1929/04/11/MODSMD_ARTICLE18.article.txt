# ALL-STAR SQUAD FROM SOUTH TO MEET CARDINALS
## Twenty-Six Track, Field Men From Six Colleges Will Compose Southern Squad Occidental, Pomona, Caltech, San Diego, Redlands, and Whittier to Give Opposition 
### Frank Whiteley 
An All-Star team from the Southern
Conference will attempt to stem the title
of Stanford track victories when it meets
the Cards in the Stadium next Saturday
afternoon. Twenty-six men representing
Occidental, San Diego, Pomona, Whit
tier, Caltech, and Redlands colleges make
up the All-Star aggregation.
Although there is little likelihood of
the Southerners seriously threatening
Stanford's supremacy, there will be many
close races and hotly contested field
events. '
Hec Dyer, who pressed Captain Char
lie Borah of U.S.C. to the limit in both
sprints last Saturday, will again have his
work cut out for him when he runs
against George, Ruth, and Rear of the
visitors. George, in particular, will be a
formidable opponent for the lanky Card
sophomore. George, Whittier athlete, lias
done 9 4-5 in the century, and last wedd
he raced to a 21 3-5 victory in the fur
long in the Southern Conference meet.
To Race McKinnon
Goodheart, Occidental captain, should
give Alex McKinnon a good race in the
mile. McKinnon, by plucky running
against U.S.C., definitely indicated that
his predicted comeback has really ma
terialized. Both he and Goodheart arc
capable of 4:30 or better. The Occiden
tal runner will be the favorite in the 880
if McKinnon doesn't run, and it is likely
that the latter will not be entered in the
shorter distance.
Bob Brown and Ray Griset of Stan
ford will be fairly evenly matched with
Crawford of the All-Stars. Crawford
turned in a 10:06 1-5 performance for the
eight laps last Saturday.
Roth hurdles events should be close
with Fox and Smith of the Southern
team capable of close to 15 seconds in
the highs and Perry of 24 2-5 in the
lows. Captain Ross Nichols, Ward Ed
monds, Podge Smith, and Don Nelson
will have to work for their points in
these events.
Fast Quarter Seen
The All-Stars have two fast quarter
milers in Appleton and Worden, each
capable of 50 flat, and Johnny Morrison
will need to run a speedy lap to break
the tape first. Shove and Syer will have
to put up a real fight for the other
places.
The relay should be a real race, the
visitors' team of Worden, Appleton,
Cobb, and George able to do 3:24 or
better. Templeton has not indicated what
men lie will use in the relay, but the
team will be probably the same as that
which beat the U.S.C. quarter-milers last
week—Shove, Syer, McDermott, and
Morrison.
EUGENE, Ore., April 10.—A two
weeks trip to Alaska aboard the "Queen,"
the floating University of Oregon, will
conclude an eight weeks' summer session
<>n the campus. Courses to be given on
board the steamer will include geography,
geology, Pacific coast history, anthro
pology, journalism, English, art, biology,
and botany.
