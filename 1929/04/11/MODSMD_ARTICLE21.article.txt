The poor student who delays his work until the last few days of the
semester has long been the object of professional excoriation. . . .
This student turns in all required work, a tritle late, perhaps slightly
condensed, but practically always intact. The reward? lie is lucky to
rate more than the traditional "D."
Often his results are of a higher quality than those of the student who
is content to remit the assignments as per schedule. Many times it is of
at least average ranking. The semester grades, however, have never been
known to inspire the recipient to greater endeavors.
Why should the so-called dilettante student be verbally lammed by
unanimous faculty opinion ? Regarding him as though he were purely a
laboratory specimen, why doesn't he deserve the highest grades . J
In the commercial world the high-pressure worker who can turn out
even ordinary work is always suitably rewarded. It's the man capable of
quantity production on short notice who is in demand. He who cau
outline a selling campaign over night, or design a building, or write a
novel, is a valued man.
Therefore the student who is capable of turning out the semester's
work in two days should be regarded with awe. Phi Beta Kappa should
be proud to honor him as one of its own. Such a student demonstrates
his caliber by his actions.—The Daily lowan.
