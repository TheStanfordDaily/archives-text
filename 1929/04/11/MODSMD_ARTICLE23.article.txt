"Spite Corner" —President.
Written by Frank Craven, author of
"New Brooms" and "The Nineteenth
Hole," this new play at the President is
entertaining—but nothing extraordinary.
It differs from the usual Duffy show in
that it is not a domestic comedy. "Spite
Corner" is a romance of a young girl
who gets in wrong with a backward New
England village when she refuses to sell
the corner needed to build a new business
block.
There are a number of well-drawn,
humorous village characters, but the
main attraction of the show is the ap
pearance of Viola Dana, motion picture
star, in the leading feminine role. Those
who remember Miss Dana as one of the
cutest —she's four feet ten inches tall, so
the adjective is correct in this instance
•—comediennes of the screen, will not be
at all disappointed in seeing her play a
straight romantic part 011 the speaking
stage.
Miss Dana's success on the screen has
made many people forget that she began
on the legitimate stage at the tender age
of six, and established herself as a
Broadway star iu "The Poor Little Rich
Girl" before going into the movies. She
is inclined to lie a little too ingenuc-ish
in the first act of "Spite Corner," but
comes through splendidly in the emo
tional scenes.
Elizabeth Dean (Miss Dana) loses al
most all her friends when she defies the
town magnate, but Eben Gooch (Percy
Pollock) is a lovable old man who does
his best to patch things up. Mr. Pollock
makes a distinct hit as the drawling,
lazy Mr. Gooch. Anne Lockhart is well
chosen for the typical old-maid. The

hero—we forgot to mention that the girl
is holding out her corner store for spite
because thp magnate's grandson almost
jilted her—is played by George Le Guere.
"Spite Corner" has only a week more
to run —it's recommended.

The Veiled Door. By Caroline Gil
tinan. (New York: The Macmillan
Company. $1.0.)
The very smallness of this volume il-!
lustrates the gift that Miss Giltinan has
for turning her thought in a small space, j
As a result one comes upon lines which j
are almost epigrammatic in character yet
rich in cadence. Consider, for instance:
"lie who says that Life is short
Has never suffered pain.
"A night can hold eternity—
And night returns again."
! Joyce Kilmer called Caroline Giltinan
| t
j "the least artificial poet living." Ilcr
I poems spring from an understanding of
the beauty in life, its sadness, and the joy
which often comes through experience
whose radiance could only he caught by
a poet of more than ordinary perception.
The main charm of this book is the oc
casional lines of verse that stand out
head and shoulders above the rest. Lines
that can he remembered, and quoted, anfl '
translated at will into a whole volume j
drawn from related experiences. The j
| rest is ordinary.
