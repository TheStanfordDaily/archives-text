## PROHIBITION MUDDLE 
### 
The emphasis placed upon prohibition
news in our daily press these days is sig
nificant of the large amount of public
interest in the subject. And where there
is intense public interest there is, eventu
ally, action of some sort; although it is
often slow in a democracy like ours
where public opinion trickles slowly
through to cause governmental action.
History is repeating itself in the pro
hibition muddle. States "went dry" one
by one before the 18th Amendment was
passed. Militant prohibitionists carried
their cause into one state at a time where
they concentrated to win a victory.
Now the wets have taken the same
slogan, "state by state." Four states,
New York, Montana, Nevada, and Mary
land, have already wiped the state prohi
bition law off their statute books. A fifth
seems ready to do the same—Wisconsin.
The drys are badly worried. They
should be. State after state will prob
ably fall into line by force of popular
demand and withdraw state aid in en
forcing the 18th Amendment and the
Volstead Act.
Problems to Arise
With states refusing to help in en
forcing the law, serious problems will
arise. One of two things will happen to
the prohibition law. Either it will be
maintained by strong, militant Federal
forces organized like an army; or else it
will collapse with the withdrawal of state
support because of inability of the na
tional government to cope with it. In
the latter case, the 18th Amendment will
go the shadowy way of the Blue Laws
of past generations.
Even if the federal authorities can en
force the law after the states quit there
will develop weighty new problems of
state versus national jurisdiction. Never
before has the federal government faced
the prospect of having actively to en
force a law that is being so widely vio
lated in every part of the United States.

injected into the situation. Coast guard
patrol boats sank the British ship "I'm
Alone" after pursuing it to a point twen
ty-two miles from the United States
coast. Only careful diplomatic handling
has settled the situation officially. But
unofficial results cannot be easily
squelched. The incident got widespread
publicity in British papers. The justified
dissatisfaction of British people is not al
layed by an exchange of diplomatic notes.
Norway is the latest country to pro
test. She alleges that the coast guard
patrol boat 189 used "high handed and
dangerous" methods in calling on the
Norwegian fruit ship Juan to heave to
for search in Chesapeake Bay. Reports
are that the coast guard boat fired six
shots at the Norwegian ship, which, upon
being searched, proved to be carrying no
illegal liquor.
Such antics by this country in attempt
ing to enforce what Europeans consider
a fanatical law will not help to further
friendly relations among the people, even
though there is no official breach.
Are We Fed Up
All of which raises the final point, are
the people of this country fed up with
prohibition? Developments indicate that
this is true. After ten years of the "no
ble experiment" the people are in a mood
to take steps to change a law that is ob
viously impossible to enforce unless a
great majority of the people desire it.
What the country wants is temperance,
and the attempt at complete prohibition
has thus far failed in this respect. If the
law is modified will greater progress be
made toward true temperance? More
and more people think so, and they at
least can try after the 18th Amendment
and the Volstead Act have proved futile
for a decade.
In the meantime, the ardent drys are
re-entrenching themselves for a fight to
the finish. Every time a dry officer shoots
another innocent person, or a senator ad
mits he votes dry but drinks, or a ship is
unjustly searched they worry. And the
drys have good cause to worry.
