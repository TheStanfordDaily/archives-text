# PREPARATIONS TO OBSERVE ECLIPSE TOLD BY TOWNLEY
## 
### Theodore DeMotte 
.j Scientists are making extensive pre
parations for observation of an eclipse
1 | of the sun which will take place May
i 9. The path of the total phase of the
■ i eclipse lies in the East Indies region.
L j It starts in the Indian Ocean between
I Africa and southern Asia, cuts across
Java, the Malay Peninsula, and the
| Philippine Islands, and ends in the
Pacific Ocean somewhere between
i l Asia and North America.
"In an eclipse of the sun, the total
phase never lasts more than eight
minutes," said Professor S. I). Town
> ley, of the Mathematics department,
[ in discussing the eclipse observations
. | and their values to science. "An
I eclipse may last only a few seconds
| in the total phase, and the average
I time is very short. The eclipse in May
will be between four and five minutes
. in length, a relatively long one and
will afford a good chance for exten
sive observations."
Science hopes to gain numerous ad
; vantages from observation of the
eclipse in May, according to Profes
sor Townley. Among them will be the
opportunity to photograph the corona
and the prominences on the sun,
which can only be done during the
eclipses. Study of the prominences by
means of the spectroscope reveals the
[ elements of which they consist. A
test of some of the theories advanced
I by Einstein will be made during the
• observations. The stages in the shape
. and size of the corona will be re
. corded, and tests will be made to
: record the amount of heat given off
by it.
"In Einstein's theory of relativity,"
j said Professor Townley, "the idea is
• | advanced that the light of stars is
I I deflected or bent near the sun. Ein
stein gives the amount of deflection
that may be expected. Observations
are made to corroborate or refute
the theory. The method used is as
1 foilows: Photographs are made of the
region of the heavens in which the
eclipse is to take place. The Lick Ob
servatory made such photographs with
| a battery of six cameras, which took
I in all the background of the eclipse
i area. The angular distance between
stars is computed in the pre-eclipsi
photo, and the angles between the
same stars are again computed in the
photographs made at (he time of the
eclipse, when the sun is between us
and the stars observed. If the angles
show a bending of the light, and in
the proper amount according to the
theory, then the theory is given strong
support. The observations made by
! the Lick expedition to Australia in
I 1022 tallied very closely with Ein
| stein's theory.
"Another, though minor, problem,
I which is at present believed nearly
solved, is to see whether or not there
is another planet within the orbit of
the planet Mercury. Mercury iB the
closest known planet to the sun, since
it Is never observed more than eight
een degrees from the sun, and is hence

only observed just before sunrise or
just after sunset. In the sixties, an
astronomer claimed that he had ob
served a planet within the orbit of
Mercury. This was before the day of
photography, and the alleged planet
has never been seen again. It is be
lieved that the astronomer was in
error. If the planet did exist, it would
have to revolve about the sun at a
terrific rate, and could be observed
only at the time of a total eclipse."
Professor Townley's discussion
showed what a great amount of pre
paration is necessary for such obser
vations, and gave an inkling of the
amounts of money that are spent on
such expeditions as the one being
sent to the Philippines in May.
