Word comes from the U.S.C. !
camp down in Los Angeles that the
Trojans lay the blame for their
stunning track defeat at the feet
of Virgil Dowell, Cardinal broad
jumper.
According to the Trojan trackmen, as
' reported in THE big paper of the south
i ern metropolis, a great amount of credit
I for their defeat goes to Dowell and his
I broad jumping ability. While it was
| commonly felt on the campus that the
I Lindsay jumper would be out to strut ;
his stuff in the crucial meet of the sea
son, the Sons of Troy apparently did not
j give him much consideration as a point
j winner. They accredited him with a pos-
J sible third place. Imagine their chagrin
at his taking first.
If Dowell had lived up, or down,
as you prefer, to the Trojans' ex
| pectations, U.S.C. would have won
the meet by one point if it had ta
ken the relay and if the other
events had come out as they did.
Here is the way they figure. By taking
I third in the broad jump, Stanford would
j have 65 points compared with 61 for |
U.S.C. With the prospect of winning the
meet looming so large, the Trojans
would have used Borah in the relay,
| which they say they would have won, if
the U.S.C. sprinter had run. And a vic
tory in the relay would have given the
Trojans the meet by one point. Simple
' enough, but Dowell won.
Their praise of Dowell does not
in the least distract from the glory j
of Edmonds and McKinnon, who I
made twenty-one points. The whole j
Card team was responsible for the j
victory, for that matter, not a |
group of three or four men. But it
does show that the public earned i
the title of sheep-minded in ac- j
claiming only the spectacular |
things of life.
. I
Also m the same meet, it was proved
i that grunting does help. In the 220-yard
I dash, Dyer of Stanford led Borah most
jof the way. The Trojan runner was get
j ting worried along toward the finish of
i the race and let out a grunt that could lie
| heard over to the shot-put pit when he
j made his final effort.
No doubt there was a lot of
I grunting that turned to moaning on
the Trojan train that night. By
winning the track meet, the Cards
captured three out of five major
sports, which takes a little sting
out of a certain 10 to 0 football
defeat one certain day last fall. ,

Word comes from the U.S.C. !
camp down in Los Angeles that the
Trojans lay the blame for their
stunning track defeat at the feet
of Virgil Dowell, Cardinal broad
jumper.
According to the Trojan trackmen, as
' reported in THE big paper of the south
i ern metropolis, a great amount of credit
I for their defeat goes to Dowell and his
I broad jumping ability. While it was
| commonly felt on the campus that the
I Lindsay jumper would be out to strut ;
his stuff in the crucial meet of the sea
son, the Sons of Troy apparently did not
j give him much consideration as a point
j winner. They accredited him with a pos-
J sible third place. Imagine their chagrin
at his taking first.
If Dowell had lived up, or down,
as you prefer, to the Trojans' ex
| pectations, U.S.C. would have won
the meet by one point if it had ta
ken the relay and if the other
events had come out as they did.
Here is the way they figure. By taking
I third in the broad jump, Stanford would
j have 65 points compared with 61 for |
U.S.C. With the prospect of winning the
meet looming so large, the Trojans
would have used Borah in the relay,
| which they say they would have won, if
the U.S.C. sprinter had run. And a vic
tory in the relay would have given the
Trojans the meet by one point. Simple
' enough, but Dowell won.
Their praise of Dowell does not
in the least distract from the glory j
of Edmonds and McKinnon, who I
made twenty-one points. The whole j
Card team was responsible for the j
victory, for that matter, not a |
group of three or four men. But it
does show that the public earned i
the title of sheep-minded in ac- j
claiming only the spectacular |
things of life.
