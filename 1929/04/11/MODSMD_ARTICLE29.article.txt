# FRESHMAN TRACK MEN READY FOR TILT TOMORROW
## 
### Reid Briggs 
When the young Bear track squad
meets the Card frosli tomorrow after
noon in Berkeley another "little big
meet" will begin. In spite of the fact
that there are few outstanding track
and field men on either side, a con
tent between California and Stanford
freshmen is always good for plenty of
excitement. With the final score more
or I.'KS of a toss-up in this case there
will probably be even more than the
utual amount.
In the mile two men who showed
promise on the wet track last week
ire Ed Kaehler and Ned Avery. They
will run against Poole and Bigelow
of the Bear Cubs and have good
chances of bringing home the first two
places.
Wayne Elwood and Ralph Giberson
■liter the two sprint races as poten
tial winners. Whether Marquis or Bill
Barlow, who wear the Blue and Gold,
can out speed them is doubtful; cer
tainly the Cardinals can hope for sec
ond and third in both the 100 and
-20. In the 220 they will be backed
up by Bill Mearns.
The Card babes expect to take at
least six points in the 440, where
Captain Ike Hables stars. He should
take that event, seconded by Paul
Nash. Wayman and Lucas will enter
tain the Cards in this event at Berke
ley.
Ernie Mendenhall has been losing
ground because of his ankle injury,
but may still place second to Bondshu
of California in the high hurdles.
Kibre will have a tough battle with
Bob Jones and Bill French for third
place. Mendenhall is favored to do
better in the low sticks, where he
has a good chance of placing first.
Bondshu and Kibre are expected to
nose out Pete Parkin and French of
Stanford.
Francis is the fastest Bear Cub in
the 880. His best time is 2:01, which
he made the other day. His best pre
vious time was 2:03. Walt Cooper is
the man the frosh are counting on in
this event. His time is also 2:01, and
the meeting of these two men prom
ises plenty of excitement. Cooper's
aide is Brickey, who faces the Bears'
VanFleet.
In the distance runs neither team
has much outstanding material. Stan
ford is entering Jim Scatena, Dave
Cook, and Alexander deßretteville.
Scatena may take first in the two
mile run.
The Redshirts have a good weight
tosser in George Grey, who has put
the shot 43 feet. His reinforcements
will be Bill Doub and Bob Jones. It
isn't too much to expect two places ;
from this trio. Grey's mark of 13G j
with the discus and Jones' 130 are
both better than the best California
mark, 116 feet.
E. W. Caddel, Bob Iveeble, and the
versatile Jones bear the Card colors
in the high jump. Opposing them are I
two men who have made five feet j
eleven inches consistently, while our j
best is an inch less than that.
Ned Johns has done 12 feet five
inches in the pole vault, and will prob
ably break the record of 12 feet three
inches when he meets Koblick of
California. Koblick hovers around 12
feet. Bill Doub will probably capture
third in this event.
The best the Californians can boast i
in the broad jump is 21 feet three j
inches. This falls way short of Wal- :
lace Butler's mark of 21 feet ten j
inches. Butler should take first for
the Cards. Louis Janin may bring '
home a third.
Rudy Rintala is able to heave the j

javelin 172 feet pretty often, and that
will be plenty to win this event Fri
day. Here Janin may place third, too.
Stanford's freshman relay team is
composed of Captain Ike Hables, Ham j
Nash, Francis Hay, and Paul Nash.
If the relay should be the deciding
event of the meet, the Cardinal can
count on being victorious.

Rudy Rintala is able to heave the j

When the young Bear track squad
meets the Card frosli tomorrow after
noon in Berkeley another "little big
meet" will begin. In spite of the fact
that there are few outstanding track
and field men on either side, a con
tent between California and Stanford
freshmen is always good for plenty of
excitement. With the final score more
or I.'KS of a toss-up in this case there
will probably be even more than the
utual amount.
In the mile two men who showed
promise on the wet track last week
ire Ed Kaehler and Ned Avery. They
will run against Poole and Bigelow
of the Bear Cubs and have good
chances of bringing home the first two
places.
Wayne Elwood and Ralph Giberson
■liter the two sprint races as poten
tial winners. Whether Marquis or Bill
Barlow, who wear the Blue and Gold,
can out speed them is doubtful; cer
tainly the Cardinals can hope for sec
ond and third in both the 100 and
-20. In the 220 they will be backed
up by Bill Mearns.
The Card babes expect to take at
least six points in the 440, where
Captain Ike Hables stars. He should
take that event, seconded by Paul
Nash. Wayman and Lucas will enter
tain the Cards in this event at Berke
ley.
Ernie Mendenhall has been losing
ground because of his ankle injury,
but may still place second to Bondshu
of California in the high hurdles.
Kibre will have a tough battle with
Bob Jones and Bill French for third
place. Mendenhall is favored to do
better in the low sticks, where he
has a good chance of placing first.
Bondshu and Kibre are expected to
nose out Pete Parkin and French of
Stanford.
Francis is the fastest Bear Cub in
the 880. His best time is 2:01, which
he made the other day. His best pre

the man the frosh are counting on in
this event. His time is also 2:01, and
the meeting of these two men prom
ises plenty of excitement. Cooper's
aide is Brickey, who faces the Bears'
VanFleet.
In the distance runs neither team
has much outstanding material. Stan

Scatena may take first in the two
mile run.
The Redshirts have a good weight
tosser in George Grey, who has put
the shot 43 feet. His reinforcements
will be Bill Doub and Bob Jones. It
isn't too much to expect two places ;
from this trio. Grey's mark of 13G j
with the discus and Jones' 130 are
both better than the best California
mark, 116 feet.
E. W. Caddel, Bob Iveeble, and the
versatile Jones bear the Card colors
in the high jump. Opposing them are I
two men who have made five feet j

Ned Johns has done 12 feet five

third in this event.
The best the Californians can boast i

Ned Johns has done 12 feet five
inches in the pole vault, and will prob
ably break the record of 12 feet three
inches when he meets Koblick of
California. Koblick hovers around 12
feet. Bill Doub will probably capture
third in this event.
The best the Californians can boast i
in the broad jump is 21 feet three j
inches. This falls way short of Wal- :
lace Butler's mark of 21 feet ten j
inches. Butler should take first for
the Cards. Louis Janin may bring '
home a third.
Rudy Rintala is able to heave the j

javelin 172 feet pretty often, and that
will be plenty to win this event Fri
day. Here Janin may place third, too.
Stanford's freshman relay team is
composed of Captain Ike Hables, Ham j
Nash, Francis Hay, and Paul Nash.
If the relay should be the deciding
event of the meet, the Cardinal can
count on being victorious.
When the young Bear track squad
meets the Card frosli tomorrow after
noon in Berkeley another "little big
meet" will begin. In spite of the fact
that there are few outstanding track
and field men on either side, a con
tent between California and Stanford
freshmen is always good for plenty of
excitement. With the final score more
or I.'KS of a toss-up in this case there
will probably be even more than the
utual amount.
In the mile two men who showed
promise on the wet track last week
ire Ed Kaehler and Ned Avery. They
will run against Poole and Bigelow
of the Bear Cubs and have good
chances of bringing home the first two
places.
Wayne Elwood and Ralph Giberson
■liter the two sprint races as poten
tial winners. Whether Marquis or Bill
Barlow, who wear the Blue and Gold,
can out speed them is doubtful; cer
tainly the Cardinals can hope for sec
ond and third in both the 100 and
-20. In the 220 they will be backed
up by Bill Mearns.
The Card babes expect to take at
least six points in the 440, where
Captain Ike Hables stars. He should
take that event, seconded by Paul
Nash. Wayman and Lucas will enter
tain the Cards in this event at Berke
ley.
Ernie Mendenhall has been losing
ground because of his ankle injury,
but may still place second to Bondshu
of California in the high hurdles.
Kibre will have a tough battle with
Bob Jones and Bill French for third
place. Mendenhall is favored to do
better in the low sticks, where he
has a good chance of placing first.
Bondshu and Kibre are expected to
nose out Pete Parkin and French of
Stanford.
Francis is the fastest Bear Cub in
the 880. His best time is 2:01, which
he made the other day. His best pre
vious time was 2:03. Walt Cooper is
the man the frosh are counting on in
this event. His time is also 2:01, and
the meeting of these two men prom
ises plenty of excitement. Cooper's
aide is Brickey, who faces the Bears'
VanFleet.
In the distance runs neither team
has much outstanding material. Stan
ford is entering Jim Scatena, Dave
Cook, and Alexander deßretteville.
Scatena may take first in the two
mile run.
The Redshirts have a good weight
tosser in George Grey, who has put
the shot 43 feet. His reinforcements
will be Bill Doub and Bob Jones. It
isn't too much to expect two places ;
from this trio. Grey's mark of 13G j
with the discus and Jones' 130 are
both better than the best California
mark, 116 feet.
E. W. Caddel, Bob Iveeble, and the
versatile Jones bear the Card colors
in the high jump. Opposing them are I
two men who have made five feet j
eleven inches consistently, while our j
best is an inch less than that.
Ned Johns has done 12 feet five
inches in the pole vault, and will prob
ably break the record of 12 feet three
inches when he meets Koblick of
