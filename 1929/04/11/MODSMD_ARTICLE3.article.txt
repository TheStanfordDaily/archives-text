# DRAMATIC STARS TO FROLIC IN THEATRE FOLLIES TONIGHT
## 
### JOHN ROGERS 
At 8 o'clock tonight the "Theater Fund Follies" start frolicing on the Assembly
Hall Stage with one of the most humorous and most varied programs ever offered
a Stanford audience. After 9:30, at which time the vaudeville is scheduled to end,
the members of Masquers, Sword and Sandals, and Ram s Head will probably
catch the first limited out of town in order to escape the wrath of all those unfor
tunates who have been burlesqued for the benefit of the Theater Fund.
The show cannot help but be a success, for the producers—the aforementioned
campus dramatic societies—have taken care that the actors —also the aforemen
tioned ditto ditto ditto—appear in nothing hut popular numbers. There will he
music: banjos, pianos, and several songs. But—and this is a startling innovation in
present day shows—there will be no theme song.

> And then there will be skits—such skits
as could be perpetrated only in the spirit
of (insert adjectives here) fun. "For the
Honor of Old Texas," fresh from the
royal pen of Nelson Carter, King of the
Masque Hall, and James Webb, is a side
splitting mcllcrdrammer which should, as
Variety naively expresses it, "knock 'em
in the aisles!" And "Strange Interlocu
tion"—has anyone present ever heard of
Mister Eugene O'Neill and his cure for
insomnia?—is one of these deeply psy
chological dramas wherein the actors act,
rather than speak, their thoughts, if any.
Also there will be an underfledged
Junior Opera, "Swiss Cheese Preferred,"
which is rumored to have a heroine and
a hero, and maybe a villain, who can
really sing, and a chorus which can really
dance, and so it will probably be much
funnier than any other Junior Opera
which has yet been seen in this locality.
Added to alt these, numerous "hot
spots"—just what is a "hot spot," please?
—will fill in the intervals when the
laughs die down to less than one a min
ute. "A Radio Fiasco' will be repeated
by popular demand from last year's
"Football Gaieties." Then, to insert the
modernistic spirit into the entertainment,
there will be a pageant, "The Triumph
of Co-operation,' which may, or may not
—it all depends on the costumes —look
like a circus parade.
Tickets at fifty cents apiece are on
sale until 5 o'clock this afternoon in the
Old Union and after 7 o'clock tonight at
the Assembly Hall box office. Only a
limited number are left. The doors of
the hall will be opened at 7:30 tonight
for the first, and last, performance at 8
o'clock. Come early and get a seat —
come late and stand in the aisles.
