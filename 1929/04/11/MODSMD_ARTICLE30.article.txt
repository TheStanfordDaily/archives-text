# SPORTS OF 1929
## Uhle Be Surprised! 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
George Uhle, who went directly
from the sandlots of Cleveland to the
Indians in 1919 and pitched for them
for ten straight years, is wearing a
strange uniform this year, and hopes
that the change in raiment will do
him good. So, too, do Bucky Harris
and the ball fans of the city of De
troit, for George Uhle was traded to
the Flivver City team last December
for Tavener and Holloway, and very
often pitching for a new club or a new
manager revives old hurlers to new
deeds of greatness.
Bucky Harris, Uhle's new boss, has
been especially successful in rejuve
nating supposedly done-for pitchers,
and it will be very interesting to see
how Big George gets along in 1929.
During his last two seasons with

I Cleveland, he won 20 and lost 26
frames, while in 1926 lie won 27 and
lost 11. Quite a difference there, and
look further back in his record and
you'll see that two lean years pre
ceded his last good season, which
may or may not mean that he is due
for a big year in 1929,
In the two years of 1924 and '25,
| Uhle won 22 games and lost 2G, while
! in 1923 he won 26 and lost 16. What
I I'm getting at is that he has had only
I one good season in the last five, and
1 lie is either through or due to bounce
| back with a bang. George Uhle has
I always been one of the best hitters
| among the pitchers, and, as a hurler,
j lias had unusual success in striking
! out Babe Ruth, of whom you have
! probably heard.
