Two shut-outs, brilliant pitching by
three moundsmcn, and some classy field- ,
ing featured yesterday's games in the j
intramural baseball tournament.
In an air-tight pitching duel, with a
total of thirty-two strikeouts hung up
during the seven innings of play, El Toro
nosed out the Alpha Delts by a three-run
margin. Vard Loomis, star speed-ball
chucker for the club men, won his own
game in the second frame, when he con
nected with one of Mike Reynolds' fast
ones for a home run.
Besides his hefty hitting, Loomis es
tablished a strikeout record that will lx;
hard to beat during the rest of the mural
season. He fanned out seventeen batters,
and at the same time held the row play
ers to three scattered hits. Reynolds, vet
eran hall tosser for Alpha Delta Phi, |
didn't do so bad himself, and he struck j
out fifteen men.
Knocking two pitchers out of the box
under a barrage of base hits, El Tigre
batted its way to a close victory over
Beta Theta Pi. The club boys played a
first class fielding game, turning in three
fast double plays. Brown, El Tigre
catcher, made the star play of the con
test, when he snagged a difficult foul
and doubled a Beta runner off second
base.
"Foot a week" Rothert took his turn
on the mound for the losers, but his of
ferings were slugged all over the lot. j
Besides catching a great game for El
Tigre, Brown led the hitting with three
for four, one of them a long four-bag
ger.
Phi Sigma Kappa made the second j
shut-out of the day, when it walked off j
with its tilt with the Chi Psi Lodge, j
Lindow pitched a neat game for the Phi
Sigs, fanning eight batters and holding
his opponents to a single safe blow.
Laubershcimer, Chi Psi twirler, was in
clined to be wild at times, and the win
ners kept pecking away at his deliveries
to shove across seven tallies.
I-'ailing to put in an appearance, En
cina 2E lost by a forfeit to the Alpha
Delts. According to Charles Davis,
mural director, the hall outfit will be
dropped from the league, and an inde
pendent team under Jack Doyle will be |
substituted in its place.

Knocking two pitchers out of the box
under a barrage of base hits, El Tigre
batted its way to a close victory over
Beta Theta Pi. The club boys played a
first class fielding game, turning in three
fast double plays. Brown, El Tigre
catcher, made the star play of the con
test, when he snagged a difficult foul
and doubled a Beta runner off second
base.
"Foot a week" Rothert took his turn
on the mound for the losers, but his of
ferings were slugged all over the lot. j
Besides catching a great game for El
Tigre, Brown led the hitting with three
for four, one of them a long four-bag
ger.
Phi Sigma Kappa made the second j
shut-out of the day, when it walked off j
with its tilt with the Chi Psi Lodge, j
Lindow pitched a neat game for the Phi
Sigs, fanning eight batters and holding
his opponents to a single safe blow.
Laubershcimer, Chi Psi twirler, was in
clined to be wild at times, and the win
ners kept pecking away at his deliveries
to shove across seven tallies.
I-'ailing to put in an appearance, En
cina 2E lost by a forfeit to the Alpha
Delts. According to Charles Davis,
mural director, the hall outfit will be
dropped from the league, and an inde
pendent team under Jack Doyle will be |
substituted in its place.

El Tigre 8, Beta Theta Pi 5
Alpha Delta Phi 1, Encina 2E 0 (for
feit)
Two shut-outs, brilliant pitching by
three moundsmcn, and some classy field- ,
ing featured yesterday's games in the j
intramural baseball tournament.
In an air-tight pitching duel, with a
total of thirty-two strikeouts hung up
during the seven innings of play, El Toro
nosed out the Alpha Delts by a three-run
margin. Vard Loomis, star speed-ball
chucker for the club men, won his own
game in the second frame, when he con
nected with one of Mike Reynolds' fast
ones for a home run.
Besides his hefty hitting, Loomis es
tablished a strikeout record that will lx;
hard to beat during the rest of the mural
season. He fanned out seventeen batters,
and at the same time held the row play
ers to three scattered hits. Reynolds, vet
eran hall tosser for Alpha Delta Phi, |
didn't do so bad himself, and he struck j
out fifteen men.
