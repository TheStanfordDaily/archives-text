# OFFICIALS OF MEXICO PREDICT REVOLUTION OVER IN TWO WEEKS
## 
### 
MEXICO CITY, April 10.
ernment circles tonight predicted that
within two weeks the military revolu
tion would he definitely quashed.
They based this prophecy on the man
ner in which the plans of General P.
E. Calles are working out.
The State of Chihuahua was rapidly
being abandoned by the insurgents to
day while on the west coast the rebel
forces were nearlng the border of
Sonora in their retirement northward.
Hence the military problem has been
reduced practically to the State of
Sonora and strong federal armies are
drawing in on it from two sides.
The official communique issued at
the presidency mentioned only one
major development for today. This
was their unconditional surrender of
the rebel garrison at Juarez.
General Juan Andreu Almazan, com
manding the army of the north, was
busy in Chihuahua City arranging for
the resumption of railroad traffic with
the Capital. Administration of the
State was taken over by Luis L. Leon,
who was named provisional governor
to succeed Marcelo Caraveo who had
espoused the rebel cause.
