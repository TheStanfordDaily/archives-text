WASHINGTON, D.C, April 10 (£>).
—T he American government's reply to
the formal representations of the Cana
dian government over the sinking of the
rum-runner "I'm Alone" by a Coast
Guard patrol boat probably will be hand
ed to the Canadian minister late this
week.
Secretary Stimson said today that the
department now is preparing a reply to
the Canadian representations. He con
tradicted newspaper reports indicating
that the Canadian note was of a truculent
nature. The representations were tem
perate, the secretary said, and both the
Canadian note and the American reply
will be published after the reply has been
delivered to the Canadian legation.
The French embassy, which became in
volved in the case after it was found
that the seaman who lost his life in the
sinking of the vessel was French, has
received no instructions from the Paris
government on the case.
The embassy cabled reports of the in
cident to the foreign office in Paris, but
has not yet been directed to make any
move.
