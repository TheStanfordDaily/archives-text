# FRESNO OIL DRILLERS HEED FEDERAL ORDER TO HALT OPERATIONS
## 
### 
FRESNO, Ca!., April 10 (£>).—As a
direct result of the mandate from Wash
ington, drilling on several of the areas
in the Kettleman hills in western Fresno
County has been delayed and may he
halted.
Among the companies which are ex
periencing delay in at least a part of
their operations are the Pacific Western
and the Petroleum Securities. These
companies received notice today on the
restriction of drilling activities. Others
are expected.
Many of the projects will be unaf
fected, however, inasmuch as the wells
are already a considerable distance into
the ground.
