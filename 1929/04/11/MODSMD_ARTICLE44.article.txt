## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 10 (/P). j
—Ambassador Hugh Gibson, who is on
his way to Geneva to represent America |
at the coming session of the League of
Nations' Preparatory Commission on
Disarmament, may be carrying with him
some new suggestions from the Wash-J
ington government for breaking the J
deadlock that for months has held the '
naval reduction problem tightly within l
its grasp.
Before sailing for Europe, Mr. Gib- J
son was a guest at the White House for
more than a week. Three days before he
had planned to leave the capital, Secre- j
tary Stimson arrived from Manila to j
Income head of the State Department
and he too was President Hoover's guest
at the executive mansion. Then, Mr. j
Gibson postponed his departure for two ■
days so that he might have more ex- j
tended conferences with his new chief.
In his discussions with both Mr. Hoo- \
ver and the Secretary, Ambassador Gil) 1
son is known to have gone over the dis- i
armament situation in minute detail. In
fact, he was tiie first person consulted ;
by Stimson after the latter had conferred
with the President and with Frank 1!. j
Kellogg, his predecessor at the State De- :
partment. As a result, well-informed cir- j
cles here are of the opinion that Mr. i
Gibson left with very definite instruc
tions as to the wishes of the administra- j
tion and possibly some new plan for de- |
termining specific categories of fighting !
craft, which Mr. Hoover considers the
hub of the problem.
