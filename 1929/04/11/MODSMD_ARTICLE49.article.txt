NEW YORK, April 10 (#).â€”'The ten- j
nis singles championship of France,;
which never has been won by an Ameri- j
can although the French have captured I
our own national title three times, will |
be the first objective of Bill Tilden and
Frank Hunter when they begin their Eu
ropean campaign next month.
Announcing the itinerary today, Hun
ter said he and Tilden would sail from j
New York on the Aquatania, March 8,
going directly to Paris and playing in
the French title event on the dirt courts
at Auteuil beginning May 18.
The Black Sea was frozen over in
A.D. 401, according to an old Family
Magazine of 1839, which printed pur- j
ported records of that time.
