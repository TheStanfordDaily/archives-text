# LENGTH OF LIFE OF OAK TREES IS SUBJECT OF ADDRESS BY PROFESSOR JAMES MURPHY

j The longevity of oak trees and the j
I causes of their deaths was the subject |
iof a recent talk given in San Fran
! clsco by Professor James I. W. Me
j Murphy of the botany department.
When questioned about the oaks on
the campus and in the vicinity, Mc-j
; Murphy had many interesting facts i
; and conjectures to give.
"The live oak seldom lives as long
;as the average white or blue oak; i
I t hat is, it attains an age of approxi-
I mately 125 or 150 years. On the other
i hand, the white or valley oak lives
I ordinarily to be 200 or 1500 years old;
• and the blue oak, which grows back
! in the hills, reaches 300 years or more.
"The method of determining the age
i of a tree is probably well-known. The
tree must be cut down; the annual
' growth rings are then counted from
the center outward, and the distance
of the cross-section from the ground
is measured. Allowing an appropriate
number of years for the tree to at
tain the height at which the rings
were counted, we can make a fairly
accurate estimate of the age.
If, however, the tree has rotted at j
the heart, or perchance, has been
burned, we have to be less specific
and allow for another period of years.
This is very unreliable since the
rings are not added in equal widths.
A good year will produce a much
thicker ring than a poor one, and so
any guess for the rotten or burned j
Section can be no more than general.
"As an example of the fact that the ,
diameter of a tree is no criterion of I (
its age, we can look at measurements
made right here in the vicinity. One
oak, with a diameter of about twelve
inches, was classified as seventy years j
old, whereas another with a diameter
ot almost fifteen inches, was only
fifty-three years old.

"The oak across from the Physics j
building, which was drowned by the
continual overflow of the Roble Pool
when that tank had first been put in,
we found to be only eighty years old,
in spite of its three-foot diameter.
The blue oak which used to stand 1
across the street from the Bookstore, i
and which fell down a number of
years ago, had only a four-foot diame- j
ter. but had attained an age of about
27U years.
"Of the many causes of the deaths
of oak trees, some of the more un- !
usual are drowning and gas poisoning.
Tne latter accident occurred to a fine j
old tree in a nearby town not long
ago. The more natural and common j
causes of death among the oaks are j
the attacks of various fungi and in
sects, and burning by fire.
"Tree surgery," Professor McMur-1
phy went on, "is being employed in J

i many parts of the country (o treat
i
I trees afflicted with various diseases j
j and injuries. Very often this method
is effective and worthwhile, but some- j
times there is too much Injured area
; to be saved, and the tree dies in spite j
of the care. After all," he concluded,
I "if a tree is going to die, it is going !
j to die; and 1 would just as soon see
j ir grow old in dignity. Furthermore,
| it is generally much cheaper and more
desirable to plant new trees than to i
! doctor the old ones."
