j lomatic circles in Washington, whose
j members frequently pass the long
[ unoccupied mansion in Sixteenth street
which once housed the Russian am
bassadors to the United States, are
quietly speculating on whether the
1 Hoover administration is likely to
J change the policy of former President ;
Coolidge with respect to recognition
of the Soviet regime.
The concensus is that for the pres- j
ent there is little likelihood that the
1 United States will look with favor
I upon any overtures from the Soviet
j for recognition, and that the once
j well-tended embassy will continue to !
i fall slowly into decay.
