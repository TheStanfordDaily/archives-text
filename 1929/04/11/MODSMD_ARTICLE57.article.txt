# DR. WALTER MILES RETURNS FROM EAST AFTER LECTURE TRIP
## Experiment in Handling of Traffic Problems Is Carried on at Ohio 
### 
"Among the more interesting experi
ments in the field of practical psychologi
cal problems is the work being carried
on at Ohio State University on the
handling of highway traffic, including
driving, signals, and other aspects of the
problem." Dr. Walter K. Miles, profes
sor of experimental psychology, was dis
cussing his recent tour of the East and
continued, "We may expect quite tan
gible results from many of such experi
mental studies."
After an extensive visit in the East,
Dr. Miles returned to the campus yes
terday and immediately resumed work
with his classes. During his tour of the
Hast, he visited twenty-four universities,
and lectured at sixteen of them.
The subjects chosen for the lectures
show the wide lield of experiments that
are carried on here, as all of them were
delivered on scientific data gathered in
the psychological laboratories at Stan
ford. Among the talks given by Dr.
Miles were discussions of experiments in
the eye-movements of reading and in the
fundamentals of perception, and eye
movements on going to sleep, an article
011 which Dr. Miles contributed to the
current issue of the Psychological Re
view.
The trip was an especially strenuous
•one, as Dr. Miles so arranged his sched
ule that he visited one or two universi
ties every day and traveled at night. He
held conferences with many laboratory
workers, some of whom are using appa
ratus that Dr. Miles devised. He also
conferred with a number of prospective
Stanford graduate students, and made it
a point to call on many Stanford gradu
ates who are doing research work in the
East.
According to Dr. Miles, he found
much research work in psychology going
on throughout the country, much of it
made possible by funds that have come
from the Laura Spellman Rockefeller
Memorial Fund and from funds granted
by the National Research Council.
