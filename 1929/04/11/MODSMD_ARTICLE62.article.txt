# ANNUAL STUDENT DRIVE FOR CONVALESCENT HOME SET FOR APRIL 29; LABOR DAY MAY 1
##

By S. W.
Stanford charity begins at the Stan
ford Convalescent Home.
For the last nine years there has
been located on the campus a charity
organization which has served the
hospitals of San Francisco as a place
for convalescent children. In 1918,
the first year of the Home, just a few
children were sent down to let the
warmth and sunshine of Stanford per
form their cures. Last year there were
continually forty-five children cared
for. and the majority of the children
stayed from one to three weeks.
The Convalescent Home recalls
memories in the minds of early stu
dents at the University as it began
its existence in the old Stanford resi
dence. In that house, under the shade
of the eucalyptus trees, Leland Stan
ford, Jr., lived. When the boy died,
the old house seemed strangely silent.
It was in this house that the founder
of the University awoke one night to
say "the children of California shall
be my children," and the foundation
of Stanford was made.
When the Senator died, Mrs. Stan
ford was left to face her great re
sponsibilities alone, and then she too,
died, after the University was well on
its way. In the earthquake the build
ing fell, and it seemed for a time that

the glory of the old Stanford house j
had disappeared. However it was not
possible that the Stanford home should
| be forgotten, and a use worthy of the '
| two founders was discovered in the
i work done for the convalescent chil- ■
dren of San Francisco.
For two summers, in 1919 and 1920, (
the home and its surroundings were j
i turned into a summer camp. This led j
: to a request from the Stanford llos- i
pital that a home for convalescent \
children be established as a comple- i
! ment to the city hospital. The Stan- j
! ford Convalescent Home was founded !
j in 1921.
Since the inception of Stanford's j
! own charity a number of additional j
i units have been made to the Home. J
Besides the Stanford house in which :
the run-about children attend school, '
there are now the McLaughlin Unit, j
the Babcock unit, and another unit is i
now in the process of construction.
The students of the University help
in the maintenance of the children at :
the home by an annual student drive j
under the auspices of the Associated
! Students. Then too, the students take
their part in aiding the charitable !
organization by cleaning up the ,
grounds once a year on Labor Day. (
i The drive this year will begin April
! 29, and Labor Day will be May 1.

Stanford charity begins at the Stan
ford Convalescent Home.
For the last nine years there has
been located on the campus a charity
organization which has served the
hospitals of San Francisco as a place
for convalescent children. In 1918,
the first year of the Home, just a few
children were sent down to let the
warmth and sunshine of Stanford per
form their cures. Last year there were
continually forty-five children cared
for. and the majority of the children
stayed from one to three weeks.
The Convalescent Home recalls
memories in the minds of early stu
dents at the University as it began
its existence in the old Stanford resi
dence. In that house, under the shade
of the eucalyptus trees, Leland Stan
ford, Jr., lived. When the boy died,
the old house seemed strangely silent.
It was in this house that the founder
of the University awoke one night to
say "the children of California shall
be my children," and the foundation
of Stanford was made.
When the Senator died, Mrs. Stan
ford was left to face her great re
sponsibilities alone, and then she too,
died, after the University was well on
its way. In the earthquake the build
ing fell, and it seemed for a time that

the glory of the old Stanford house j
had disappeared. However it was not
possible that the Stanford home should
| be forgotten, and a use worthy of the '
| two founders was discovered in the
i work done for the convalescent chil- ■
dren of San Francisco.
For two summers, in 1919 and 1920, (
the home and its surroundings were j
i turned into a summer camp. This led j
: to a request from the Stanford llos- i
pital that a home for convalescent \
children be established as a comple- i
! ment to the city hospital. The Stan- j
! ford Convalescent Home was founded !
j in 1921.
Since the inception of Stanford's j
! own charity a number of additional j
i units have been made to the Home. J
Besides the Stanford house in which :
the run-about children attend school, '
there are now the McLaughlin Unit, j
the Babcock unit, and another unit is i
now in the process of construction.
The students of the University help
in the maintenance of the children at :
the home by an annual student drive j
under the auspices of the Associated
! Students. Then too, the students take
their part in aiding the charitable !
organization by cleaning up the ,
grounds once a year on Labor Day. (
