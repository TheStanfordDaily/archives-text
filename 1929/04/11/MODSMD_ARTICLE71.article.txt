# FORD LEADS LIST OF MOST POPULAR AUTOMOBILES AT U.C. AND STANFORD
## 
### 
A survey of the automobile situation j
! on the U.C. campus has recently been >
j conducted by the manager of the Daily j
I Californian. The results are based on the j
i replies to questionnaires sent out to 103 \
fraternities and sororities on the campus, j
and may be considered a fair estimate.
Approximately half of the students j
enrolled at the University of California j
operate automobiles, and of the total, !
more are new than second hand. In the j
fraternities questioned, it was revealed j
I that there is a ratio of 311 : 159, the new j
! cars being the more numerous. The ratio j
| among the sororities is 159 : 19.
Comparing these results with those re- j
! vealed by the survey published recently i
i in the Stanford Daily, it will be seen that j
! proportionately more Cal students drive j
! cars than Stanford students, the U.C. j
J average being one out of two, and the ;
! Stanford average being one out of three, j
| Whereas in Berkeley, the fraternities ;
I have the same ratio of car-owners and i
j non-car owners as the entire student!
I body, the automobiles here are more con- j

| centrated in the men's houses, there being
J more than one car for every two Greek
! letter men.
The makes of automobiles preferred at
j U.C. are largely the same as those pre
j ferred here. The Ford leads the list in
j both colleges, followed by the Buick at
j Cal and by the Chevrolet here. The lat -
j ter car holds only sixth place on the list
lof Berkeley machines. The liuick, liovv-
I ever, holds its own at Stanford, with
! third place. The Dodge is third at U.C.
and fourth here; while the Chrysler fol-
I lows consistently with fourth place at
| Cal and fifth place at Stanford. The
j Studebaker and Frskine tie at Berkeley
! for fifth place. The first five makes at
J Stanford — Ford, Chevrolet, liuick,
j Dodge, and Chrysler—comprise 75 per
| cent of all the student-owned cars on the
j campus, whereas the first five makes at
California—Ford, Buick, Dodge, Chrvs
j ler, and Studebaker —comprise only about
:69 per cent of the total there? Other
| types of automobiles do not correlate so
exactly as the first few, but maintain a
1 considerable parallelism.
