# CARD NINE TO FACE U.C.L.A. BALL TEAM IN DECIDING CONTEST
## Game Tomorrow To Be Third Of Series; Harder May Hurl for Cards 
### 
With a 6 to 1 victory over the Trojans I
to its credit, Stanford's varsity baseball ]
team is all ready for the third and de- i
ciding game of the series with U.C.L.A. j
to be played here tomorrow afternoon,
at 3:15. The Bruins won the tirst con-j
test by a count of 4 to 3, and the Cards :
made a strong last-inning finish to cop ,
the second game H to 7.
If Coach Harry Wolter can find a
pitcher to duplicate Simkins' feat of ;
last Tuesday, the Cards should have j
little trouble in taking the Bruins into!
camp. Taylor, Lewis, anil Smalling art- j
ready to chuck, and Wolter's choice will
probably be between these three. Spud j
Harder may get the call in lieu of his j
victory over the U.C.L.A.ans down south. |
"Whitey" Graham, Bruin captain, will \
probably start on the mound against i
Stanford tomorrow. Graham is one of j
the leading chuckers of the League, and ;
already holds one victory over the Red-1
shirts to his credit. Sammy Halter, Bruin
basketball star, will l>e seen in action at
right field position.
Saturday the Cards meet the Univer-1
sity of California nine at Berkeley, in the j
second game of the series. The Bears j
captured the first game by a 7 to 2 count, j
but are expected to have a tougher time j
with the rejuvenated Card nine.
