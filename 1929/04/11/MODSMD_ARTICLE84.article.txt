## 
### 
BERKELEY, April 10.â€”More than
* 50,000 spectators will witness the first
! American intercollegiate crew race of
i the present season next Saturday
morning on the Oakland estuary when
the Universities of California and
Washington send their varsity, junior
I varsity, and freshman eights against
; each other for the Pacific Coast cham
, pionships. California is defending her
. 1928 Pacific, Coast, American inter
. I collegiate, and Olympic Games titles,
while Washington, holder of the
Pacific Coast championship for five
consecutive years from 1922-1921), is
attempting to regain her former place.
With reports indicating a clear,
sunny day, it is a certainty that all
previous records will be shattered by
i the crowd of enthusiastic spectators
who will line the course and congre
gate at the finish.
Hostilities between California and
Washington will be continued in the
afternoon at the California Oval on the
Berkeley campus at 2 o'clock, where
j the Husky and the Bear track teams
will hold their first dual meet since
; 1901, when California was the victor,
81 2-3 to 35 1-3. The California and
Stanford baseball teams will conclude
the University Day program on Hil
gard Field. The game will be called
at 3:30 p.m.
The main event of the Regatta, the
three-mile race between the California
and Washington varsity crews, is

scheduled for 11:30, but will be pre
ceded at 10 and 10:45 respectively,
by two-mile freshman and three-mile |
junior varsity races. All finishes will j
be at the Fruitvale Avenue bridge.
Starts for the three-mile races are set
L'or the loot of Franklin Street, while
the two-mile event will begin a mile ;
turther downstream.
The regatta Saturday will mark the |
twenty-fifth meeting of California and
Washington varsity crews, the first
race having taken place on June 3,
1903, when 4-oared crews raced over
a mile and a half course. Washington
broke an oarlock on this occasion and
while it was being fixed California
gave an exhibition to entertain the f
crowd. The Californians came back j
and after a three-hour rest rowed
their second race of the day against j
the Washington varsity, losing by a |
length and a half. California has won
six of the races rowed since that i
time, Washington establishing a defi- I
nite margin of superiority with eight
een victories. Stanford was a factor
for many years when the three insti- j
tutions held triangular regattas on
Lake Washington at Seattle, the Oak
land Estuary ,and Richardson's Bay
above Sausalito. The Cardinals were
the first western university to estab
lish a definite place for the Pacific i
Coast crews at Poughkeepsie, when j
they placed second after winning on !
the Pacific Coast.
