# FOOD RESEARCH INSTITUTE HITS "WHOLE-WHEAT" FAD

(liditor's Note: This is the fourth of
a serifs on the research work• in Stanford
j departments. Dr. Alsherg, who came to
) the campus in 1921, studied at Columbia,
I Strassburg, and Berlin. Before coming
to Stanford, he zivs chief of the Bureau
of Chemistry in the United Stales De
partment of Agriculture.)

The entire whole-wheat bread fad,
I sourcc of expensive advertising cam-
I paigns, and delight of a galaxy of dieti
j cians, goes up in a cloud of bread
crumbs.
Thus the belligerent whole-wheat cult,
with its food faddists, its food cranks,
its food quacks, and its advertising spe
cialists, is ferreted out, indexed, labeled,
and admirably demolished in the latest
publication of the Food Research Insti
tute. The Institute, under the direction
of Dr. Carl Alsherg, I )r. Joseph S. Da
vis, and Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, has al
ready won wide recognition for its work,
carried on under the support of the Car
negie Corporation and Stanford Univer
sity.
In the Institute's latest report, the ad
vocates of the use of whole-wheat, or

bran, in the diet see their eloquently con
voked arguments of protein- and carbo
hydrate-content, of roughage, and of
vitamin, laid bare by the workers of the
Institute.
This report refutes the widely quoted
"facts" of the whole-wheat faddists by
pointing out that in an average Ameri
can diet, protein can be better obtained
from white bread, mineral elements and
roughage better obtained from milk, veg
etables, and fruits, and the highly neces
sary Vitamin 1! from fruits, vegetables,
milk, eggs, and meat.
And finally, it states, white bread is
more attractive in appearance, its texture
is finer, it toasts better, it is better adapt
ed to spreading materials, and the best
white breads are considerably more di
gestible than the best whole-wheat I
breads.
The American housewife today de- j
tnands the very best in bread. Good ,
bread, moreover, slie judges not mostly
on nutritive values, but on looks and
flavor. It must be white in color, fluffy,
and light, and porous. The Institute,
therefore, is investigating why certain
wheats, when used for baking, give this
j kind of bread, and others, while equally
nutritious, give a bread entirely unac
j ceptable to the consumer.
California wheat, for example, is of
a poor quality for bread making, yet each
j day the efficient restaurateur in China
1 makes the noodles for his foyung den
| and chow mein out of wheat grown in
the fertile wheat lands of the Sacra
mento and San Joaquin river bottoms.
Meanwhile the chefs at the Mark Hop
kins and the Ambassador use for their
| cakes and pies and pastries wheat flour
brought from the Middle West.
A somewhat similar condition is found
in the California barley industry, where
much of this valuable food finds its way,
| not to California homes, but to the great
I breweries of Europe.
Another important problem, now be
| ing investigated by Dr. Alsberg, is the
j forecasting of wheat yields from the
j weather. It may not be long before the
familiar sight of a Kansas farmer, chew
ing a long, yellow straw, leaning over a
fence rail, and predicting the size of his
harvest, will be replaced by a trained
: specialist, who, with scientific methods,
! will obtain a more accurate result.
This specialist, predicts I)r. Alsberg,
i will reach his conclusions from study of
weather factors, including light, heat,
and moisture data. The scientist will not
I be able to prevent unforeseen disasters—
long cold spells, hail storms, or hurri
i canes. He is unable to overcome to any
i great degree these hazards of weather.
| Hence, he turns his attention to foreqast
| ing their probable effects, for it is obvi
! ous that next to eliminating or control
ling hazards the best procedure is to
j foresee them.
To be forewarned is to be forearmed.
If it is possible to foresee a crop failure,
or even a short crop, steps may be taken
; at least to minimize the evil effects.
