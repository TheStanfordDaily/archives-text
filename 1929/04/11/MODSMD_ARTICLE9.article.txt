(liditor's Note: This is the fourth of
a serifs on the research work• in Stanford
j departments. Dr. Alsherg, who came to
) the campus in 1921, studied at Columbia,
I Strassburg, and Berlin. Before coming
to Stanford, he zivs chief of the Bureau
of Chemistry in the United Stales De
partment of Agriculture.)

The entire whole-wheat bread fad,
I sourcc of expensive advertising cam-
I paigns, and delight of a galaxy of dieti
j cians, goes up in a cloud of bread
crumbs.
Thus the belligerent whole-wheat cult,
with its food faddists, its food cranks,
its food quacks, and its advertising spe
cialists, is ferreted out, indexed, labeled,
and admirably demolished in the latest
publication of the Food Research Insti
tute. The Institute, under the direction
of Dr. Carl Alsherg, I )r. Joseph S. Da
vis, and Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, has al
ready won wide recognition for its work,
carried on under the support of the Car
negie Corporation and Stanford Univer
sity.
In the Institute's latest report, the ad
vocates of the use of whole-wheat, or

bran, in the diet see their eloquently con
voked arguments of protein- and carbo
hydrate-content, of roughage, and of
vitamin, laid bare by the workers of the
Institute.
This report refutes the widely quoted
"facts" of the whole-wheat faddists by
pointing out that in an average Ameri
can diet, protein can be better obtained
from white bread, mineral elements and
roughage better obtained from milk, veg
etables, and fruits, and the highly neces
sary Vitamin 1! from fruits, vegetables,
milk, eggs, and meat.
And finally, it states, white bread is
more attractive in appearance, its texture
is finer, it toasts better, it is better adapt
ed to spreading materials, and the best
white breads are considerably more di
gestible than the best whole-wheat I
breads.
The American housewife today de- j
tnands the very best in bread. Good ,
bread, moreover, slie judges not mostly
on nutritive values, but on looks and
flavor. It must be white in color, fluffy,
and light, and porous. The Institute,
therefore, is investigating why certain
