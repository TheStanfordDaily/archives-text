And the frocks that come triumphantly through the sternest judg
ment of style-conscious men and women are exactly those which
the College Shop has in stock. One and two-piece styles, plain
colors and gay prints, sleeveless frocks with velveteen or silk
jackets, high ties, hrief pleated skirts all the debonair style details
of Spring are represented.
Of course they arc suitable for the college environment but they
aren't sober and uninteresting. Allah l>e praised that unquenchable
feminine nature makes it as important to be smartly and attractively
dressed while improving the mind as it is while exercising that mind
to earn a living or administer a household.
