Dear Sirs:
Perhaps you would like to know in
Ji. L j, word or so hov.' I am in partners !
with Edgeworth in a business way.
By profession I am a cartoonist,
who you probably know is called upon
to create new ideas. While this is
ranked as the hardest part of the pro
fession, I have proved it may easily
be mastered, if a person will but
recline in any easy chair, light a pipe,
and live with imaginative persons in
the aromatic smoke clouds that will
soon fill the room. Edgeworth has
given me more ideas than any other
brand of tobacco, so I "married" my
pipe to it quite a while ago. The result
has been wonderful. The more you
use Edgeworth, the more you crave
it -not as a drug, but as a wholesome
pleasure.
Complimenting the standard qual
ity (which means more than the words
signify) of Edgeworth, I am a devoted
and profound user.
Yours very respectfully,
James W. Bright

Dear Sirs:
Perhaps you would like to know in
Ji. L j, word or so hov.' I am in partners !
with Edgeworth in a business way.
By profession I am a cartoonist,
who you probably know is called upon
to create new ideas. While this is
ranked as the hardest part of the pro
fession, I have proved it may easily
be mastered, if a person will but
recline in any easy chair, light a pipe,
and live with imaginative persons in
the aromatic smoke clouds that will
soon fill the room. Edgeworth has
given me more ideas than any other
brand of tobacco, so I "married" my
pipe to it quite a while ago. The result
has been wonderful. The more you
use Edgeworth, the more you crave
it -not as a drug, but as a wholesome
pleasure.
Complimenting the standard qual
ity (which means more than the words
signify) of Edgeworth, I am a devoted
and profound user.
Yours very respectfully,
James W. Bright
