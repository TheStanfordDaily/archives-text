# STANFORD AWAITS MASQUE BALL FESTIVITIES
## His Majesty Will Lead Fair Queen to Royal Throne At 10:30 O'Clock 
### 
As there are a few bids still on
hand for the Masque Ball, the
Rally Committee has decided to
continue the sale of tickets until
5 o'clock this afternoon at the
A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union
in order to raise money for the
New Theatre fund. If any still re
main, they may be obtained at the
Pavilion at the time of the dance.
| All through the night voices rang
| in the fervor that is born on the eve
! of a great event. With the dawn came
j quiet, but it was merely a momentary
I suppression, for tonight the corona
! tion ceremonies will climax the period
!of unrestrained festivity which has
| settled over the kingdom of the
! Masques during the past week.
Tonight at 9 o'clock the Masque
| Ball begins, and an hour and a half
later the coronation ceremonies are
scheduled to start. King "Gertie's"
Carter, accompanied by Queen Elsie
j Chase, and the royal attendants will
j march to the throne where his Royal
J Highness is to be crowned by Prime
! Minister Hal Conroy.
The Ball, which is scheduled to
, continue until 1 o'clock, will be sea
! soned with novelties in keeping with
' the occasion. The decorations follow
| a carnival motif, with colors predomi
j nating. Sirs Brooks and Worthington,
| caretakers of the royal fiddles, will
furnish the music for the occasion.
Parliament in an extra session yes
terday passed a resolution requiring
each and every person who attends
the Ball to come dressed in costume,
and wearing a mask. In order that
costumes may be readily obtained,
costumers of note have been brought
from San Francisco to equip all who
plan to attend the affair. They will be
at their headquarters in the Pavilion
ballroom until 5 o'clock this after
noon.
