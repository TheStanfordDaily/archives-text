# VARSITY NINE MEETS U. C., BRUIN TEAMS
## Cards Have Chance to Rise From Cellar Position; U.C.L.A. Team Weak 
### 
With two games scheduled for the
week-end, the Stanford baseball team
is practicing hard for a final endeavor
to rise in the Conference standings.
This afternoon the local liorse-hiders
meet the U.C.L.A. Bruins at 3:15 on
the varsity diamond, and tomorrow
play the University of California nine
at Berkeley at 3:15 on Hilgarde field.
While the Cards were trimming the
Trojans Tuesday, the Bruins fell vic
tims to the Oxy Tigers by a 21 to 4
margin. Although U.C.L.A. didn't use
its best chucker against Oxy, the
score makes the Bruins look pretty
weak, and the Cards should take them
rather handily. Stanford and the
Bruins broke even in the first two
games of the series, played at Los
Angeles. "Whitey" Graham will prob
ably chuck against the Cards today.
UC. didn't fare so well with the
Trojans and consequently are only
tied for first place in the California
Intercollegiate Baseball Conference
instead of being alone on top the
ladder. The Bears trounced the Cards
in their first meeting by a 7 to 2
count, but the Redshirts still have a
chance to take the series.
Coach Harry Wolter has been giv
ing his men some stiff sessions in the
sliding pit in an effort to improve the
Card base-runners. Wolter will use
either Taylo'r or Smalling on the
mound against the Bruins today, but
has not yet decided upon his pitcher
for the California game. Hardy will
work behind the log.
In Norm Horner, Coach Carl Zam
loch of California has one of the
headiest pitchers in college baseball.
Horner has fine control and a good
change of pace which enabled him to
defeat the Cards easily in the last
meeting of the two teams. Wyatt will
do the catching for the Bears.
