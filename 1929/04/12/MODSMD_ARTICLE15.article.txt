# FASTEST, FURIOUSEST FLIPPANTEST FOLLIES FURNISHED FUND FANS
## 
### John Rogers 
Doing all they promised, and more,
Masquers, Ram's Head, and Sword
and Sandals societies put on one of
the "fastest, furiousest, and flippant
est" entertainments of many years in
the Assembly Hall last night. It was
a program in which there were but
few dull moments and many hilarious
ones, and which often surpassed the
longer and more finished "Gaitiets"
of the past.
The hit of the "Follies" was
"Strange Interlocution," a broad bur
lesque of O'Neill's mental agony, ex
cept that Bob Paine and Dick Arn
stein, the authors, substituted the
body for the mind. Runners-up for
honors were Kathleen Fitz, who ap
peared for the last time on the Stan
ford stage, with her three "Blues"
songs, and Neil Spauiding's and Griff
Williams' piano duet of that mean
piece, "Rhaspsody in Blue." For their
encore, at least according to the pro
gram, they offered "Rhythmic Gar
bage."
At times it was hard to decide
whether the "Theatre Fund Follies"
was being put on by the three dra
matic societies or by Burnell Gould,
who appeared in three different mous
taches, a beard, au natural, and a la
A1 Jolson. Besides all this, he wrote
"The Triumph of Co-operation,"
wherein good old School Spirit saved
ihe day, "A Radio Fiasco," "Kale
Brothers and the Barnacle" in new
jokes, "Maxims and Morals in Song
land," with slides of the simpering
'nineties, and "Swiss Cheese Pre
ferred," a miniature Junior Opera
wilh songs, a chorus, and as little
plot as most.
Larry Staley's banjo number, in
which he played one banjo and gave
Ihe effect of two, was one of tlie
cleverest bits heard for a long time,
and it was a treat to see once more
Boone and Boone clog the boards of
the Assembly Hall. "For the Honor
of Old Texas" was a burlesque with
weak moments.
Not the least on the program was
Winston Norman's talk on why the
show was givenâ€”to raise money for
the new theatre af Stanford which
would be wonderfully awe-inspiring
and massive, "built along the lines
of Dr. Wilbur."
