35. the one who has doped out the in
dividual events the most nearly cor
rectly will receive the first prize.
The premiums offered are both sub
stantial and delectable. These will be
three prizes for men and one for
women.
So moisten your pencils and jot
down your dope. Each day an attempt
will be made to obtain a prediction
from the coaches and leading track
men.
