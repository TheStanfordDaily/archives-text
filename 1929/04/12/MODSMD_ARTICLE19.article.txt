# CARD, ALL-STAR TRACK TEAMS CLASH IN STADIUM TOMORROW
## Dink Templeton's Champions Favored to Trim Southern Conference Aggregation; Close Races Promised in Eight Track Events; Visitors Weak in Field; Two-Mile Even 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
f»OACH Dink Templeton's track and field team, already assured of the
Pacific Coast championship, will encounter its laßt hurdle before the annual
Big Meet when it clashes with an All-Star aggregation from the Southern
Conference in the Stadium tomorrow. The meet will begin at 2:30 p.m.
Stanford, because of its clean-cut victory over U.S.C. last week, is the heavy
favorite to take the meet tomorrow; but it will not win without a struggle
in many events.
The Southerners are strongest in the track events, and in these eight races
they will make their greatest bid for points. The mile, with Goodheart of
Occidental opposing Alex McKinnon, who was a double winner against the

•Trojans last week, should be the fea
ture race of the day. Both men are
capable of 4:30 or better. McKinnon
will not run in the half-mile, and
Goodheart will have the edge on the
Stanford 880 men, Neikirk, French,
and Jennings.
In the field, the high jump and jave
lin are the best All-Star events. Bish
op and Hall can both do six feet,
which is a height none of the Card
jumpers has been able to get over
this year. Peterson of San Diego and
Bishop of Occidental throw the jave
lin around 185 feet, and this may be
good for some points against the Stan
ford trio of Kibby, Sparling, and
Perelli-Minetti.
Two-Mile Close
Crawford, All-Star two-miler, will be
evenly matched with Bob Brown and
Ray Griset of the Cards. All three
can do around 10 m.
Johnny Morrison will be pitted
against Appleton and Worden in the
quarter-mile. The two visitors are
capable of 50 flat, and Morrison will
have to work to take first. Syer and
Shove will put up a fight for the
other places.
The Southerners' hurdlers, Fox and
Smith, are said to have done 15 sec
onds in the highs and may be able
to grab some of the points from
the Stanford combination of Nichols,
Edmonds, and Nelson. Perry of the
visitors runs the low barriers in
24 2-5. He will be opposed by Smith,
Nelson, and possibly Edmonds.
Ingram of Pomona has cleared 12
ft. 6 in. in the pole vault and will
give Berry and Hulsman plenty of
competition for second place, Ed
monds being conceded first. Another
Pomona athlete, Shannon, is the best
of the All-Star broad jumpers, doing
about 22 ft., which is not good enough
to place against Dowell, Zombro, and
West or Anderson of the Cards.
The discus and shot, as usual, will
be Stanford sweeps, the best visiting
weiglitmen being capable of only 42
ft. 6 in. in the shot and 131 ft. in the
discus. Eric Krenz is still nursing a
sore back but will probably be in
condition to compete tomorrow.
The mile relay promises to be an
exciting race, the All-Star team of
Worden, Appleton, Cobb, and George
having done better than 3:24. The
same Card team that defeated the
Trojans will be used. This means
Shove, Syer, McDermott, and Mor
rison. No extra admission for stu
dents will be charged.

Shove will put up a fight for the
other places.
The Southerners' hurdlers, Fox and
Smith, are said to have done 15 sec
onds in the highs and may be able
to grab some of the points from
the Stanford combination of Nichols,
Edmonds, and Nelson. Perry of the
visitors runs the low barriers in
24 2-5. He will be opposed by Smith,
Nelson, and possibly Edmonds.
Ingram of Pomona has cleared 12
ft. 6 in. in the pole vault and will
give Berry and Hulsman plenty of
competition for second place, Ed
monds being conceded first. Another
Pomona athlete, Shannon, is the best
of the All-Star broad jumpers, doing
about 22 ft., which is not good enough
to place against Dowell, Zombro, and
West or Anderson of the Cards.
The discus and shot, as usual, will
be Stanford sweeps, the best visiting
weiglitmen being capable of only 42
ft. 6 in. in the shot and 131 ft. in the
discus. Eric Krenz is still nursing a
sore back but will probably be in
condition to compete tomorrow.
The mile relay promises to be an
exciting race, the All-Star team of
Worden, Appleton, Cobb, and George
having done better than 3:24. The
same Card team that defeated the
Trojans will be used. This means
Shove, Syer, McDermott, and Mor
rison. No extra admission for stu
dents will be charged.
f»OACH Dink Templeton's track and field team, already assured of the
Pacific Coast championship, will encounter its laßt hurdle before the annual
Big Meet when it clashes with an All-Star aggregation from the Southern
Conference in the Stadium tomorrow. The meet will begin at 2:30 p.m.
Stanford, because of its clean-cut victory over U.S.C. last week, is the heavy
favorite to take the meet tomorrow; but it will not win without a struggle
in many events.
The Southerners are strongest in the track events, and in these eight races
they will make their greatest bid for points. The mile, with Goodheart of
Occidental opposing Alex McKinnon, who was a double winner against the

•Trojans last week, should be the fea
ture race of the day. Both men are
capable of 4:30 or better. McKinnon
will not run in the half-mile, and
Goodheart will have the edge on the
Stanford 880 men, Neikirk, French,
and Jennings.
In the field, the high jump and jave
lin are the best All-Star events. Bish
op and Hall can both do six feet,
which is a height none of the Card
jumpers has been able to get over
this year. Peterson of San Diego and
Bishop of Occidental throw the jave
lin around 185 feet, and this may be
good for some points against the Stan
ford trio of Kibby, Sparling, and
Perelli-Minetti.
Two-Mile Close
Crawford, All-Star two-miler, will be
evenly matched with Bob Brown and
Ray Griset of the Cards. All three
can do around 10 m.
Johnny Morrison will be pitted
against Appleton and Worden in the
quarter-mile. The two visitors are
capable of 50 flat, and Morrison will
have to work to take first. Syer and
Shove will put up a fight for the
other places.
