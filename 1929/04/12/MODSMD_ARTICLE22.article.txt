						Socialist Looks at the College Man
## 
### 
The college man, all too complacent in his rich environment of libra
ries, laboratories, athletic fields, and comfortable living quarters, might
well note the picture of himself held by one group of society. Scott Near
ing, socialist leader and free-thinker, a man who was evicted from two
universities for his radical point of view, presents the college man as seen
by himself and his group. The picture is a part of an article entitled,
"Academic Mortuaries," wheh appears in the current New Masses, radi
cal publication.
Nearing is a serious thinker. He is deeply sincere, and the picture he
gives is born of the stutT that makes true conviction. The Daily prints
his description of the college student.
"The college students that I meet seem to lack any matured sense of
reality. They live in a world of mental makebelieve, on a hill, far from
the actual struggle of life; in a social vacuum, where their dolls and
teddy-bears are football games; pool tables; fraternities; teas; dances;
drinks; smokes. Their nearest approaches to mental reality come in labo
ratories where they wrestle with the problems of natural science. In the
social field they trick and try with 'oughts' and 'shoulds'; 'rights' and
other metaphysical concepts while the great world of struggle surges on
about the mausoleums in which their youth is being sacrificed to the ne
cessity of pretending that a dying social order is still in the full bloom of
youth and vigor."
A criticism such as this should make the average college man stop and
consider himself. Has he a "matured sense of reality"? Is college a
world of "mental make-believe"? Is it a "social vacuum"? Is he work
ing in a "mausoleum"?
The man just graduated who looks for the first job may well believe
that Nearing is right. And in a sense he seems to be. College is theoreti
cal training. It is schooling away from the once universal empirical
method of apprenticeship. College gives none of the practical daily re
sults that make progress apparent. It gives grades, which have tenuous
meaning. It can give little objective proof of his growth. The old system,
years back, placed the learning youth immediately in his profession, and
he began to work with the tangible things that the rest of his life would
find him working with.
But this system gave no opportunity of testing, of trying, of choosing
what the individual could do and wanted to do most. This is one thing
that college can do. It can provide the transition from the home and
extreme youth with its indecision to the world and the beginning of ma
turity with its more decisive outlook on life, a transition in which the
student may find hmself and make use of that wise old adage, "Look
before you leap."
