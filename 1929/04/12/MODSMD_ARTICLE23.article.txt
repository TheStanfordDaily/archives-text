# Make Palm Drive a Through Arterial
## 
### 
The Daily, having read the following letter and having agreed with
it heartily, prints it in this column in the hope that it will be seen by
someone who can answer its pertinent question to the satisfaction of the
some six, seven, or eight hundred car owners who drive daily the length
cf Palm Drive:
The Editor, Sir:
I have just one question, which I wish someone would answer
for me, and that is:
Why should motorists be expected to slow down at the in
tersections on Palm Drive, when the entrances to that ave
nue, at every single dinky intersection between the Univer
sity and the highway, are protected on both sides by STOP
signs ?
With conditions as they are at Stanford University, it seems
to me that it would be only fair to have at least one roadway be
tween here and Palo Alto on which motorists could legally make a
little time.
If the existing situation is not a positive invitation to break the
law, then I'm an ostrich.
Sincerely yours,
Myrtle Moore
The Daily has investigated and is quite sure that the writer of the
letter is not an ostrich.
