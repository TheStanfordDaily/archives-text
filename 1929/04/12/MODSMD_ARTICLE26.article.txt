Procession. By Fannie Hurst. Harper
and Brothers, New York and Lon
don. 1929.
Procession is a collection of five |
short stories which will hardly justify
Fannie Hurst's much-touted position
as the highest-paid short-story writer ,
in" America. Yet they have an unde-i
niably strong "middle class" type of
appeal, which perhaps is the very
element that makes the author so
widely read.
The popular style of writing, that !
our Fannie insists upon affecting—is
more than ever in evidence in these \
stories. In £er novel immediately pre- !
ceding, "A President Is Born," the
author came through with an un- ]
guessed, unexpected fineness in her
style. The hook was so far above her
ordinary plane of work that it indi- ]
cated a possibility that Miss Hurst's
abilities had been underrated. But |
"Procession" goes far to show that j
her previous effort was only an arti-!
flcial product—a mere momentary
lapse into good writing—for here are
all the old Fannie Hurst characteris
tics of blatant sentimentality and
atrocious grammar. The book abounds
in her familiar one-word sentences —
garish, spectacular adjectives, that
the author seems to have such a love
for; so that commonplace people and
commonplace situations take on a
nerve-wracking, melodramatic signifi
cance.
There is a fascination to the Hurst
short story —yet there is always that
cheap, tln-panny element too. Every
thing is on parade: emotions, pathos,
heartaches. Too great demands are
made on the reader's sympathy by the
incessant high pitches of sensation,
climaxes, heights, and depths. This
brass-band style becomes tiresome.
The stories are not all equally bad.
The first, "God's Left Hand," has a
moving, sincere plot, which is spoiled
by mawkish sentimentality at the end.
"The Hossie-Frossie's" is an exagger
ated, depressing story, but the human
side here is really well-handled —in
spots. "Lend this Little Girl a Hand"

is the best of the five, having the
author's good points—color, swift
movement, and intensity—and as for
the matter of split infinitives —well, ;
they can be overlooked.

AT THE THEATRES
GEARY—The Front Page is still the i
autstanding attraction in San Fran
cisco. It is a fast-moving comedy-melo- i
drama of newspaper life concerning 1
the attempts of a certain Hildy John
son to cut loose from the mad whirl
of Chicago newspaper life and go into
the advertising business in New York.
It's rough, rowdy, and —as one young
woman said —"I didn't think a story
of newspaper life could be so excit-.
iiig."
All of the action is in the press i
room of the Chicago Criminal Courts
building, and it centers around the
"covering" of a story of a hanging.
Recommended by all means.
CURRAN—The Wishing Well, with,
Harriet Benentt starring, closes Sat- i
urday night. This delightful English
musical production is just the oppo
site of the rough-and-ready Front
Page, but it is excellent.
House of Women, dramatization of
Louis Bromfield's novel, "The Green
Bay Tree," with Nance O'Neil In the
main role, opens at the Curran on
Monday, April 15.
COLUMBlA—Straight Thru The
Door, with the choice comedian, Wil
liam Hodge, goes next week into its
third and final week. Hodge is worth
seeing, but there is nothing especially
important about the play—a "smart
mystery comedy."
ALCAZAR—Skidding. You are al
ways sure of good entertainment and
clean fun at the Duffy theatres.

Procession. By Fannie Hurst. Harper
and Brothers, New York and Lon
don. 1929.
Procession is a collection of five |
short stories which will hardly justify
Fannie Hurst's much-touted position
as the highest-paid short-story writer ,
in" America. Yet they have an unde-i
niably strong "middle class" type of
appeal, which perhaps is the very
element that makes the author so
widely read.
The popular style of writing, that !
our Fannie insists upon affecting—is
more than ever in evidence in these \
stories. In £er novel immediately pre- !
ceding, "A President Is Born," the
author came through with an un- ]
guessed, unexpected fineness in her
style. The hook was so far above her
ordinary plane of work that it indi- ]
cated a possibility that Miss Hurst's
abilities had been underrated. But |
"Procession" goes far to show that j
her previous effort was only an arti-!
flcial product—a mere momentary
lapse into good writing—for here are
all the old Fannie Hurst characteris
tics of blatant sentimentality and
atrocious grammar. The book abounds
in her familiar one-word sentences —
garish, spectacular adjectives, that
the author seems to have such a love
for; so that commonplace people and
commonplace situations take on a
nerve-wracking, melodramatic signifi
cance.
There is a fascination to the Hurst
short story —yet there is always that
cheap, tln-panny element too. Every
thing is on parade: emotions, pathos,
heartaches. Too great demands are
made on the reader's sympathy by the
incessant high pitches of sensation,
climaxes, heights, and depths. This
brass-band style becomes tiresome.
The stories are not all equally bad.
The first, "God's Left Hand," has a
moving, sincere plot, which is spoiled
by mawkish sentimentality at the end.
"The Hossie-Frossie's" is an exagger
ated, depressing story, but the human
side here is really well-handled —in
spots. "Lend this Little Girl a Hand"

is the best of the five, having the
author's good points—color, swift
movement, and intensity—and as for
the matter of split infinitives —well, ;
they can be overlooked.

all the old Fannie Hurst characteris
tics of blatant sentimentality and
atrocious grammar. The book abounds
in her familiar one-word sentences —
garish, spectacular adjectives, that
the author seems to have such a love
for; so that commonplace people and
commonplace situations take on a
nerve-wracking, melodramatic signifi
cance.
There is a fascination to the Hurst
short story —yet there is always that
cheap, tln-panny element too. Every
thing is on parade: emotions, pathos,
heartaches. Too great demands are
made on the reader's sympathy by the
incessant high pitches of sensation,
climaxes, heights, and depths. This
brass-band style becomes tiresome.
The stories are not all equally bad.
The first, "God's Left Hand," has a
moving, sincere plot, which is spoiled
by mawkish sentimentality at the end.
"The Hossie-Frossie's" is an exagger
ated, depressing story, but the human
side here is really well-handled —in
spots. "Lend this Little Girl a Hand"

is the best of the five, having the
author's good points—color, swift
movement, and intensity—and as for
the matter of split infinitives —well, ;
they can be overlooked.

AT THE THEATRES
GEARY—The Front Page is still the i
autstanding attraction in San Fran
cisco. It is a fast-moving comedy-melo- i
drama of newspaper life concerning 1
the attempts of a certain Hildy John
son to cut loose from the mad whirl
of Chicago newspaper life and go into
the advertising business in New York.
It's rough, rowdy, and —as one young
woman said —"I didn't think a story
of newspaper life could be so excit-.
iiig."
All of the action is in the press i
room of the Chicago Criminal Courts
building, and it centers around the
"covering" of a story of a hanging.
Recommended by all means.
CURRAN—The Wishing Well, with,
Harriet Benentt starring, closes Sat- i
urday night. This delightful English
musical production is just the oppo
site of the rough-and-ready Front
Page, but it is excellent.
House of Women, dramatization of
Louis Bromfield's novel, "The Green
Bay Tree," with Nance O'Neil In the
main role, opens at the Curran on
Monday, April 15.
COLUMBlA—Straight Thru The
Door, with the choice comedian, Wil
liam Hodge, goes next week into its
third and final week. Hodge is worth
seeing, but there is nothing especially
important about the play—a "smart
mystery comedy."
ALCAZAR—Skidding. You are al
ways sure of good entertainment and
clean fun at the Duffy theatres.
PRESIDENT (See "Alcazar.") Viola

Procession. By Fannie Hurst. Harper
and Brothers, New York and Lon
don. 1929.
Procession is a collection of five |
short stories which will hardly justify
Fannie Hurst's much-touted position
as the highest-paid short-story writer ,
in" America. Yet they have an unde-i
niably strong "middle class" type of
appeal, which perhaps is the very
element that makes the author so
widely read.
The popular style of writing, that !
our Fannie insists upon affecting—is
more than ever in evidence in these \
stories. In £er novel immediately pre- !
ceding, "A President Is Born," the
author came through with an un- ]
guessed, unexpected fineness in her
style. The hook was so far above her
ordinary plane of work that it indi- ]
cated a possibility that Miss Hurst's
abilities had been underrated. But |
"Procession" goes far to show that j
her previous effort was only an arti-!
flcial product—a mere momentary
lapse into good writing—for here are
all the old Fannie Hurst characteris
tics of blatant sentimentality and
atrocious grammar. The book abounds
in her familiar one-word sentences —
garish, spectacular adjectives, that
the author seems to have such a love
for; so that commonplace people and
commonplace situations take on a
nerve-wracking, melodramatic signifi
cance.
