A DEEP CUT
With the 1929 track season fast ap
proaching its climax the Little Big
Meet, between the freshmen of Stan-,
ford and the University of California,
is expected to steal the limelight this
week-end.
As the men who make up these
teams are the men who will even
tually be the track stars of their
respective institutions, the meet
presents an interesting angle.
Here on the Farm, Coach Bill El- 1
lington was forced to face the same
situation as was faced by yearling
coaches in other sports—that of hav
ing only a class of 350 freshmen to
choose from. A smaller turnout than
usual was therefore not particularly i
surprising.
The fact that the '32 men have
been able to boast winning teams
in all the major sports in which
they have' participated so far this
year, shows only one thing, that
of the 350 who entered in the
fall, a small minority are out
standing athletes who have served
to bolster, by their versatility,
the freshman teams. A careful
check shows that out of seventeen
men who participated in the Little
Big Game, seven took part in one
other sport, four in two other
sports, and one in three other
sports. In basketball the propor
tion of men participating in at
least one other sport was over
fifty per cent.
This of course throws the responsi
bility of freshman athletic supremacy
| and eventually University athletic
supremacy on the chance that each
incoming class will have a group of
"iron men" to bear the burden of up
holding Stanford's present position in
the sports realm.
Again next year there will be an
incoming class of 350, and judging
by the present outlook, this plan |
is to continue indefinitely. The
effect of the 150 cut may not make
any difference in Card athletic
supremacy next year nor the year
after, but the time will come (and
it is not so far off) when the "iron
i
men" will be missing, and then
there will be moans and groans
galore. —Anson Reeder.
