# CARD FROSH FAVORED TO DEFEAT CUB NINE IN GAME TOMORROW
## Freshmen Have Strong Team; One More Victory Will Clinch U.C. Series 
### 
With everything to win and excel
lent chances of winning it, Stanford's
freshman baHeball team will meet the
California Cub nine in the second
game of the 1929 Little Series tomor
row at 3:30 on the varsity diamond.
By decisively beating the Cubs last
Saturday, the Card babes placed
themselves in a favorable position for
taking the series.
Coach Husky Hunt's choice for
mcund duty is Ernie Caddel. Caddel
has pitched brilliant baseball all sea
son and should be able to handle the
Cal players easily. He is a speed ball
pitcher primarily, but he also works
in a nice assortment of curve balls.
He and McLean, who chucked win
ning ball against the Cubs last week,
have been the high points of the year
ling squad this year. Evans is slated
to work behind the plate for the
frosh. He has caught Caddel in most
of his games and knows the big
pitcher's bag of tricks. Evans is a
consistent receiver and has a better
than-average throwing arm.
The regular infield combination will
play Saturday. Marks will be at first,
Barsumian at second, Kelly at third,
and White at short. Captain Rintala,
Pcx, and Stine will start in the out
field, but Coach Hunt may use Griggs
and Waterman before the game is
over.
Coach Brick Mitchell will probably
ftart Mailho in the box for the Cubs.
Nix, who was his choice last Satur
day, was knocked all over the lot by
the Card batters, a total of 20 hits
being collected. Mailho, a left-handed
pitcher, is supposed to be the best on
the Berkeley squad. He uses an effec
tive delivery, a change of pace, and
a good hook.
