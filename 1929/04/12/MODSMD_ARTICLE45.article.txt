Playground ball, a new sport on the
! intramural program, got off to a flying
start yesterday afternoon on the mural
diamonds with three slugging matches,
one of them an extra-inning affair.
Phi Kappa Psi pounded out twenty
' odd hits to run away from Encina 1W
by a 19-run margin. Berry, last-ball
twirier for the row team, pitched a
nice game, letting the hall players
down with two scratch hits. Besides
striking out an ample number of the
frosh batters, Berry looked good at
the bat with four timely hits. Fast
â€¢ playing by the Phi Psi infield featured
j the game.
Coming from behind in the seventh
i inning, Kappa Sigma tied the score
i on a walk and infield hit, and won
I
! its game by pushing over a run in
i the last half of the eighth frame. Both
; teams played ragged ball at times,
and costly errors were responsible for
: the K.A.'s defeat. Tiny Sellman, first
i baseman for the losers, and Cy Mann,
Kappa Sig chucker, were the heavy
hitters of the day with a home run
I apiece.
Encina 4E snowed Zeta Psi under a
j barrage of base hits and walked oil'
1 with a 15 to 11 victory. Allen pitched
i for the winners and, although hit hard
| at times, was effective in the pinches.
! Folger, for the hall outfit, starred at
the bat, one of his blows going for a
! four-bagger.
Today's schedule is as follows:
Toyon Hall vs. Encina Basement, and
; Phi Kappa Sigma vs. Theta Xi.
