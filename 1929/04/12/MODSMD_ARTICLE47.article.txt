# B.A.C. TO BUILD NEW BALL PARK ON SITE OF SUNKEN DIAMOND
## Construction Not to Start For Two Years; Plan Concrete Stands 
### 
One of the best college baseball 1
parks in the country will belong to
Stanford when the construction of the ;
new varsity field, now partially com- i
pleted, is finished, according to Coach I
Harry Wolter. It will place Cardinal
baseball facilities on a par, in com
parison, with the Stadium, the Pavil
ion, and the varsity tennis courts.
The site of the new field is the j
sunken diamond which has been used
for the past several years by the
freshman nine. To date, the completed
construction consists of substantial
enlargement of the field, which has ,
been too small, and the piling of
earth in preparation for the erection >
of the grandstand and bleachers. t
Graduate Manager A1 Masters said j
yesterday in an interview that the ]
building of the stands would not take |
place for at least one year and pos-1
sibly two. During that period the em- |
bankments will have plenty of time '
to settle, and there will be no danger I
of cracking of the concrete.
The present varsity diamond will
continue to be used by the regulars 1
until the new park is entirely com- j
pleted, and then will be turned over
to the first-year men, according to the 1
piesent plans.
