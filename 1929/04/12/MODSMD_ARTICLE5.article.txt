# FOUR BEAR CUBS TO FURNISH THREAT IN FROSH MEET TODAY
## Rintala, Johns, Grey, Cooper Expected to Earn Most Of Cards' Points 
### 
A Blue and Gold sprinter who has I
done ten seconds flat in the 100-yard i
dash and who makes the 220 in 21 4-5 i
seconds, a first-class man in both the j
hurdles and broad jump, two high j
jumpers who have tied at five feet |
eleven inches â€”those four men will ;
cause most of the trouble for the
Stanford freshman track squad which
meets the California yearlings at 3
o'clock this afternoon on the Berkeley
track.
To offset these outstanding Bear
Cubs the Card frosh have several po
tential stellar performers in Rudy
Rintala, a javelin thrower who has
consistently done over 170 feet, Ned
Johns, who doesn't touch the bar when :
he vaults at twelve feet five inches, j
George Grey, whose discus mark of <
136 feet is far beyond Caifornia's best,
116 feet.
With Barlow in the sprints, and
Bondshu in the hurdles, California
seems to have the edge in those
events. However, Cooper of Stanford
has done 2:01 in the 880, which is
better than the time of any Bear j
freshman. The mile is more or less of 1
an unknown quantity with both teams. '
The field events are those in which
close competition may be expected,
with the Cardinal yearlings having
slightly better marks all around. The
mark of 50 feet 0% inches made by
Grey in the 12-pound shot event far
surpasses the best mark of the Cali-,
fornia freshmen. The discus and jave-'
lin events are both pretty well sewed |
up by Grey and Rintala, with the sec
onding of Bob Jones.
Inches separate the opposing broad-j
jumpers. Stanford's Butler has done j
21 feet 10 inches; Bondshu of the j
Bears has done 21 feet 4 inches. Cali-1
fornia has the edge in the high jump !
contest, but only by an inch or so. !
Three Blue and Gold men are capable i
of doing 5 feet 11 inches.
