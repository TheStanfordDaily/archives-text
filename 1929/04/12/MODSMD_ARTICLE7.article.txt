# SUGGEST TRANSFER OF DRY LAW ENFORCEMENT UNIT TO ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S OFFICE
## President Hoover, Attorney General Among Backers of Proposal; Will Probably Be Considered at Special Session Of Seventy-first Congress Which Will Begin on Monday 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 11. (/p)â€”Legislation transferring the prohibition en
" forcement unit from the Treasury to the Justice Department may be
added to the constantly growing agenda of the special session of the Seventy
first Congress which begins next Monday.
President Hoover has discussed this matter with some Congressional
leaders, including Representative Cramton, Republican, Michigan, an out
standing spokesman for the Drys, and Attorney General Mitchell expressed
the hope today that the transfer will be authorized in the near future.
The position of the Attorney General is that since his department is to
take over this huge new function the sooner it is done the better. The

>clepartment now is in the process of
more or less reorganization incident
to the change of administrations and
the prohibition unit could be more
readily absorbed in the midst of this
process than at some later time.
President Hoover proposed the
transfer in his inaugural address as
the first step in a general move for
better law enforcement. Anti-Saloon
League and other dry organization
leaders at first were inclined to op
pose this step, but the understanding
now is that they are content to give
the plan a trial, especially since they
desire that the Chief Executive have
a free hand for carrying forward his
plan for enforcement of the Eighteenth
Amendment.
Several difficult problems are in
volved in the proposed transfer and
the working out of the necessary
legislation is expected to require some
time. Even with the Dry unit placed
in the Justice Department there must
be close co-operation between that
department and the Treasury, under
which must be left control of the
Coast Guard and the Customs Service
which are co-operating in enforce
ment.
While full plans for the absorbing
of the Prohibition unit by the Justice
Department have not yet been formu
lated, the present expectation is that
at the outset there will be no need
for adding a new assistant attorney
general to take over the work on
which the official who takes full
charge of enforcement must be re
lieved.
Later, however, after the machinery
gets into smooth working order a new
assistant probably will be added as
the direction of the unit and the
prosecution of cases would require
the full time of one of Mr. Mitchell's
assistants.
