| C/zdvertising plays no favoritesâ€”it makes B
| friends of you and for you. It is constantly * |
j offering kindly assistance by introducing worthy 1
\ merchandise to you. It tells you of the best k
\ clothes; of the newest time and labor-saving I
| devices; of opportunities to save money by I
j making certain purchases at certain stores on |
j specified days. It even points the way that 1
| enables you to keep yourself physically fit and I
\ mentally alert. |
Advertising is, unconsciously to you per- |
haps, your steadfast friend. It has established 1
an era of good feeling between you, the stores, 1
the manufacturers and their products. Adver- |
| tising is honest and sincere. You can believe it 1?
\ and believe in the product it calls to your at- p
tention. Advertising is a real friend-maker.
