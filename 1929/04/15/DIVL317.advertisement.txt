We wish to thank our
customers for their pa
tronage the night of the
Masque Ball, but we re
gret that we had to turn
away dozens of students
because all of our cars
had been spoken for in
advance.
In the future we hope
that our patrons will re
serve their cars a day or
two ahead of lime so that
they will not be disap
pointed the last minute.
