# SPECIAL SESSION OF CONGRESS 10 CONVENE TODAY
## Extraordinary Assembling of Solons First Since 1922; Hoover Is Keeping Promise Republican Majority Prevails In Both Senate and House; To Welcome New Members 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 14. (£>)—' The
Congress elected last November will
convene tomorrow at the call of Presi
dent Hoover for the consideration of
farm relief and tariff revision.
It will be the first extraordinary
session of Congress since 1922 and it
was called in compliance with a prom
ise made by Herbert Hoover in the
closing days of the national campaign.
Both the Senate and House are rich
in Republican majorities and the
party leaders announced their deter
mination today to stand by the sug
gestion of the President for a limita
tion of the session to the specified
subjects of farm relief and tariff with
the addition of the measures for re
apportionment of the House and for
authorization of the 1930 census.
But the Democratic leaders take a
different view. They contend other
things deserve immediate attention,
including flood relief legislation and
consideration of the credit situation
as it involves the efforts of the Fed
eral Reserve Board to curb specula
tion.
Tomorrow and Tuesday will be de
voted to the usual opening formalities
and it will be Wednesday before ac
tual business gets under way. After
the induction of new members —and
the last election sent 68 new members
to the House and nine to the Senate,
mostly Republicans—Congress tomor
row will quit with the appointment of
committees to notify the President
that it is in session.
On Tuesday the first message cf
Mr. Hoover to Congress will be read.
Mr. Hoover is adopting a new course
in this respect. Unlike the last three
presidents he will not go personally
to Congress to read his first declara
tion. It will be read separately in the
House and Senate by clerks. Also un
like his predecessors, Mr. Hoover is
carefully guarding his message
whereas from the days of Theodore
Roosevelt it has been the practice to
distribute these documents over the
country days in advance of their de
livery.
The farm relief bill will receive
first call in both the Senate and
House. Leaders hope to get this legis
lation on the statute books by June 1
and full attention then will be given
to the controversial tariff problem—
the first time this subject has come
forward since the present act was
written in 1922.

that it is in session.
On Tuesday the first message cf
Mr. Hoover to Congress will be read.
Mr. Hoover is adopting a new course
in this respect. Unlike the last three
presidents he will not go personally
to Congress to read his first declara
tion. It will be read separately in the
House and Senate by clerks. Also un
like his predecessors, Mr. Hoover is
carefully guarding his message
whereas from the days of Theodore
Roosevelt it has been the practice to
distribute these documents over the
country days in advance of their de
livery.
The farm relief bill will receive
first call in both the Senate and
House. Leaders hope to get this legis
lation on the statute books by June 1
and full attention then will be given
to the controversial tariff problem—
the first time this subject has come
forward since the present act was
written in 1922.
WASHINGTON, April 14. (£>)—' The
Congress elected last November will
convene tomorrow at the call of Presi
dent Hoover for the consideration of
farm relief and tariff revision.
It will be the first extraordinary
session of Congress since 1922 and it
was called in compliance with a prom
ise made by Herbert Hoover in the
closing days of the national campaign.
Both the Senate and House are rich
in Republican majorities and the
party leaders announced their deter
mination today to stand by the sug
gestion of the President for a limita
tion of the session to the specified
subjects of farm relief and tariff with
the addition of the measures for re
apportionment of the House and for
authorization of the 1930 census.
But the Democratic leaders take a
different view. They contend other
things deserve immediate attention,
including flood relief legislation and
consideration of the credit situation
as it involves the efforts of the Fed
eral Reserve Board to curb specula
tion.
Tomorrow and Tuesday will be de
voted to the usual opening formalities
and it will be Wednesday before ac
tual business gets under way. After
the induction of new members —and
the last election sent 68 new members
to the House and nine to the Senate,
mostly Republicans—Congress tomor
row will quit with the appointment of
committees to notify the President
that it is in session.
