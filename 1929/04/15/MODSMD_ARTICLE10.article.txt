# CARDINAL FROSH BEAT BEAR COBS BY CLOSE SCORE
## Little-Big Meet Ends With Stanford Leading by Only One Point 
### Reid Briggs 
In the closest meet either team has
had this year, the Stanford frosh track
and field men defeated the cubs of the
Golden Bear at Berkeley Friday af
ternoon. The final score was 66-65,
and it was a pretty harassed group of
spectators who saw the last figures
chalked up. At the end of the first
ten events the score was tied at 45,
after Stanford had led all the way.
Then Bondshu won the low hurdles
and gave the lead to California, 51-48.
But when the results of the field
events were being announced and Ned
Johns had outclassed all competitors
and was breaking a record in the pole
vault the Cardinal supporters knew
that even the loss of the relay
couldn't stop them.
Three Little Big Meet records were
bettered in the course of the after
noon's work. Ned Johns pole vaulted
to a height of 12 feet 4% inches. The
former mark was an inch and a half
less. Captain Ike Hables took the
quarter-mile and finished in 50 2-5
seconds, to better John Morrison's old
record of 50 3-5 seconds. But that isn't
all. When Hables started to run the
last lap of the relay, Wayman of
California was fully ten yards ahead
of him. The frosh captain had nar
rowed that lead to four yards at the
liuish —and had run the lap in 50 sec
onds flat! The time in the relay, 3:27,
is the third record established Friday.
Two California frosh were high
point men of the meet. Barlow took
bcth sprints and Bondshu captured
firsts in both low and high hurdles,
In the highs Ernie Mendenliall tried
hard to overcome the handicap of his
injured ankle, and pressed Bondshu
hard all the way to the finish. Tlioy
were almost abreast at the tape.
In the field events, the Card frosli
displayed their superiority by a con
siderable margin, taking first in every
event save one. In the high jump,
Cadell tied with two Bear jumpers.
Butler outleaped, Grey, Jones, and
