## 
### 
With their star moundsman, Norm
Horner, allowing but five hits, Cali
fornia's varsity baseball team defeat
ed Stanford by a score of 4 to 2 Sat
urday afternoon at Berkeley before a
crowd of 3000 fans. It was the fourth
straight series that the Bears have
won from the Cardinals.
Stanford scored first in the second
frame when Berg, after reaching first
on an infield error, advanced to sec
ond on Hardy's safe bunt and then,
being sacrificed to third base
on Laird's infield out, crossed the
rubber when Wright sent a sacrifice
fly to deep center. Horner was touched
for three singles in the ninth inning
that netted the Cards another marker.
Staley accounted for the run when he
tallied on Berg's infield out.
California tied things up in the sev
enth. Burgett singled, was sacrificed
to second, and tallied on a blow by
Valainos. In the eighth the Bears put
three more across the rubber. Powers
tripled, Wilson walked, Swenson sin
gled, and the latter two scored on a
wild throw to first.
The Cards fared better against the
U.C.L.A. Bruins Friday, winning by a
count of 8 to 0. Chuck Smalling let
the Bruin sluggers down with one hit,
while the Cards collected a total of
nine safeties. This victory pulled
Stanford out of the cellar in the Con
ference standings, as the faltering
Bruins dropped another game to Santa
Clara Saturday.
