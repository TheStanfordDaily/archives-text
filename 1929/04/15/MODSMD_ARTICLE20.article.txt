# STANFORD SWAMPS ALL-STARS; EDMONDS, DYER SHARE HONORS
## Score Reads 106¾-33¼ as Stanford Sweeps Seven Events; Parker Loses Mile to Goodheart After Exciting Race; Hammer Throw Seen for First Time, McLeod Is Third 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
STANFORD'S 1929 track and field team, as great as any that has ever
represented the Cardinal, had little difficulty in disposing of an All-Star
team from six Southern Conference colleges in the Stadium Saturday, over
whelming them 106% to in a comparatively uninteresting meet.
There were good races and creditable performances on both the track and
field, but after that thrilling meet with U.S.C. a week ago almost any en
counter would seem somewhat tame.
Ward Edmonds shared high-point honors with Hec Dyer, each chalking up
ten points for Stanford. Ward tied for a first in the pole vault, took a first
in the low hurdles, and a third in the highs. Dyer turned in a double win in

>the sprints. Eric Krenz, with a first
in the discus and a second in the
shot, was next in order.
Coach Dink Templeton's men scored
clean sweeps in seven of the fifteen
events (not counting the relay), shut
ting out the Southerners in the high
hurdles, the two-mile, the 880-yard
run, the pole vault, the shot put, the
discus, and the broad jump.
Mile Is Hard Battle
The meet opened with an exciting
battle for first place in the mile be
tween Johnny Parker, Card sopho
more, and Good heart of Occidental, the
latter finally breaking the tape a few
yards in the lead after outsprinting
Parker in a fine driving finish. The
time was 4:31.
The other notable track events of
the day were the sprints, the low hur
dles, the two-mile, and the 880. George,
dusky Whittier runner, gave Hec
Dyer all sorts of competition in both
of the shorter distances. The hundred,
in particular, looked to be almost a
dead heat, and Dyer's advantage was
only a matter of inches. Dyer turned
in even time performances in both
sprints.
The low hurdles was a beautiful
race to wattdi, not more than a step
ur two separating the leading four
men as they took the last barrier. Ed
monds was victor by a } l aM and a
half with Smith second and Perry of
Caltech third, the time being 24 4-5,
Cards Sweep 880
The half-mile turned out to be an
ali-Stanford affair, but a hard-fought
one at that. Alex McKinnon, who ran
in only this one race yesterday, was
able to beat his teammate, Thom Nei
kirk, to the tape by two yards only
after a great fight around the last
turn and down the straightaway. Jen
nings was a good third with Shove a
few yards back in fourth place.
Bob Brown, whose showing against
U.S.C. was not particularly good, ran
a steady race in the two-mile Saturday
with a fast last lap to win by five
yards from Loofbourow in 9:55 3-5.
Templeton entered seven men in this
event, and all but one of them finished
ahead of the All-Star runners.
Captain Ross Nichols won the high
hurdles handily in 15 flat, Smith and
Edmonds following in order.
Rothert Takes Shot Put
Harlow Rothert, who seems unable
to put the shot less than fifty feet
any more, got out an excellent heave
of 50 ft. 9 in. to take first. Krenz was
second with a toss of 47 ft. 6% in.
and Forster third at 44 ft. 10% in.
liothert showed promise of developing
into a champion discus thrower by
getting the plate out 139 ft. 4 in. to tie
Norman McCleod for second place.
Krenz was first with a long throw
of 151 ft. 4 in.
Dowell again was winner in the
Rintala outheaved, Johns outvaulted
the California babes.
All in all, it was a highly success
ful day for a track and field team
from a freshman class of 350 to out
class a team from a class of 3000.
