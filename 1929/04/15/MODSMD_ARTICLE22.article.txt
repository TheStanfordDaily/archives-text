# Tomorrow's Prohibition Questionnaire
## 
### 
The Daily lias been criticized for endeavoring to gain a survey of
campus opinion on the matter of Prohibition. It has been pointed out
that the survey will not be comprehensive. 1 rue. It has been said that
it will accomplish nothing. The Daily disagrees on this point.
In carrying this survey through, the Daily assumes that Stanford is
a representative American university, and that it has a representative
group of American college students, who can and will think for them
selves upon this problem of Prohibition, a problem that cannot fail to
touch every student in some manner. As students, we are on the door
step of active citizenship. Whatever attention we give this problem
cannot be amiss.
It has been done before. Yes. But not at a time when public con
sideration has been at such a peak. The Daily is deeply sincere in the
matter. It lias no desire to foment a plethora of unwanted publicity. No
move can be made within a university without causing a reaction on the
outside. Shall we sit back and remain silent because we fear what the
outside will say?
Sharp-witted representatives of the dry forces have shaken their
wiser and more experienced heads in disapproval of this move. lint so
have wiser and more experienced heads of the liberal forces nodded their
heads in assent.
Today the Daily prints two articles by students on the problem. It
was made a point to get articles by students. The Daily is not making
an effort to get the work of sages on the matter. It believes that student
interest alone should be involved in the affair. If it can stir up the
merest ripple of thought among the students of the campus, its purpose
will have been achieved. It is its greatest hope that the student body
will consider the problem seriously and act accordingly.
The questionnaire has been amplified. There will be four questions
instead of one. They will be:
1. Do you believe Prohibition can be enforced?
2. Do you believe that Prohibition as it has existed to date has
been successful?
3. Should the Eighteenth Amendment be repealed?
4. Should the Volstead Act be repealed ?
The columns of the Daily are open to discussion of the problem to
all members of the student bodv.

The questionnaire has been amplified. There will be four questions
instead of one. They will be:
1. Do you believe Prohibition can be enforced?
2. Do you believe that Prohibition as it has existed to date has
been successful?
3. Should the Eighteenth Amendment be repealed?
4. Should the Volstead Act be repealed ?
The columns of the Daily are open to discussion of the problem to
all members of the student bodv.
The Daily lias been criticized for endeavoring to gain a survey of
campus opinion on the matter of Prohibition. It has been pointed out
that the survey will not be comprehensive. 1 rue. It has been said that
it will accomplish nothing. The Daily disagrees on this point.
In carrying this survey through, the Daily assumes that Stanford is
a representative American university, and that it has a representative
group of American college students, who can and will think for them
selves upon this problem of Prohibition, a problem that cannot fail to
touch every student in some manner. As students, we are on the door
step of active citizenship. Whatever attention we give this problem
cannot be amiss.
It has been done before. Yes. But not at a time when public con
sideration has been at such a peak. The Daily is deeply sincere in the
matter. It lias no desire to foment a plethora of unwanted publicity. No
move can be made within a university without causing a reaction on the
outside. Shall we sit back and remain silent because we fear what the
outside will say?
Sharp-witted representatives of the dry forces have shaken their
wiser and more experienced heads in disapproval of this move. lint so
have wiser and more experienced heads of the liberal forces nodded their
heads in assent.
Today the Daily prints two articles by students on the problem. It
was made a point to get articles by students. The Daily is not making
an effort to get the work of sages on the matter. It believes that student
interest alone should be involved in the affair. If it can stir up the
merest ripple of thought among the students of the campus, its purpose
will have been achieved. It is its greatest hope that the student body
will consider the problem seriously and act accordingly.
