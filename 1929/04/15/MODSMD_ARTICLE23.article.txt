# "Chaff in the Educational Wheat"
## 
### 
Dean Ell wood P. Cubberley, Dean of the School of Education, told
a group of educators at a recent conclave that they were "mixing too
much chaff in their educational wheat." Said Dean Cubberley, "Vast
masses of facts, many of which are meaningless, including names, dates,
places, and statistics, making up much of the teachers' efforts, soon arc
forgotten by the student, and are of small value to him if he does remem
ber them. Concepts, not facts, should be taught."
Here is a man with ideas concerning education that the average
student will hail as a prophet. How many students can look back over
the tedious memorizing of states and capitals, countries and the same,
presidents' administration dates, dates of wars, weights, measures, scales,
and so on all the varied claptrap of the boresome schoolroom. And how
many students were taught to think, how to adjust themselves to their
environment, how to meet the thousand problems that face them as
growing youngsters? These things were learned outside the classroom
by trial and error, and multifold was the error.
A strange system of education is ours that has not taught us how
to live so that life will be worthwhile. If university students after twenty
years or so of education cannot reconcile their lives to the world they
live in and so end them, education might well turn upon itself and ask,
"What is wrong?"
In our great hurly-burly rush to turn out expert technicians, we fail
to teach people how to live gracefully, happily, and well. Life is so
much more important than the million rules of thumb that are hurled
at us to be remembered so that we may hurl them back at the world and
earn a dollar. So perhaps if we were to learn a few basic concepts on
this matter of living well, we would be much better off than we are at
present with the tedious detailed knowledge meted out in the average
schoolroom.
