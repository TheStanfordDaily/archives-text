# $16,000 for $300,000
## 
### 
Sixteen thousand dollars to be raised before May 1 stands between
Stanford University, as recipient, and the General Education Board as
donor, of $300,000 toward the First Million for Stanford.
The bargain is this: if Stanford alumni can raise $700,000 by May 1,
and they have done so excepting the $16,000, the Board will give $300,000
and thus make the First Million for Stanford.
The student body as a whole can do nothing toward this fine project,
but as sons and daughters and friends of alumni tlicy can remind the
alumni whom they know that Stanford needs this First Million badly,
that generous alumni in gifts not exceeding $5,000 in any instance, have
given to date $684,000, and that only $16,000 is needed to push the
fund over the top.
The First Million has as its purpose the increase of professors'
salaries. Stanford must have the best, and the best commands large
salaries. Here is a vital need that only the hirst Million can satisfy.
The Board of Athletic Control gave $50,000 just recently to the fund.
Enough has been pledged to make the $700,000, but those who have
pledged in many instances are unable to pay now. It would be a dis
couraging thing to come this near to the attainment of the First Million
and have it fall through. The Daily sincerely hopes the alumni will rally
to the cause.
There will be a tryoutee meeting at eight o'clock tonight iu the
Daily office.
