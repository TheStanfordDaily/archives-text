# Prohibition Upheld as Advancement In Moral Progress of Civilization
## America Cited as Leader in Slavery, Suffrage, Temperance Moves; Fisher, Hoover, Boyles, Borah Quoted 
### STURGIS RIDDLE 
(Editor's Notk: The follmving is an article upholding Prohibition. It is pub
lished in line with the Daily's ini estimation- of campus opinion on the matter.)

Prohibition is not merely a noble
experiment. It is a definite advance in
man's moral progress which is as ir
resistible as the other great reforms
which have preceded it. Prohibition
fought its way into our laws and Con
stitution by the sheer force of its in
evitableness, and is destined to re
main there, no matter how vocifer
ously the vested interests, die-hards,
ex-brewers, and unthinking dupes of
their propaganda chafe at it.
Addition to alcohol has been one of
the curses of humanity ever since the
beginning of history. It has poisoned
man's body, inflamed his mind, in
spired incalculable crimes and misery,
and stunted his civilization. Centuries
of experience with alcohol have shown
it, to be the blood brother of murder,
poverty, suicide, slavery, lust, and
wretchedness. Unless the present
American civilization wished to belie
its title of "enlightened," it could do
no other than to refuse longer to
tolerate alcoholism, that parasite upon
its national well-being.
America Has Been Leader
Prohibition has traveled the same
road taken by all the other great
movements which have sought to free
man from his social weaknesses. It
has been cursed, resented, and then
accepted. Like the small boy, mankind
doesn't seem to know what's good for
it; it repulses the very reforms which
are for its highest welfare; it cries
because it cannot poison itself.
In these great advances, America
has been a leader. Her constitution
witnesses to the steady effort of her
people to orientate themselves to pro
gressing culture. With the Thirteenth
Amendment, she abolished slavery;
with the Nineteenth Amendment, she
recognized the political coming of age
of women; with the Eighteenth
Amendment, she freed her citizens
from bondage to drug, and opened up
a new era of physical and moral
health. Does anyone suggest that wo
repeal the Thirteenth Amendment and
reintroduce slavery, or that women
should be deprived of their rights as
citizens? How foolish, then, to undo
the work of decades by getting rid
of Prohibition and reinstating the
reign of alcohol in the United States.
Can we turn back the hands of time,
and undertake a disastrous retrogres
sion in our social progress? Hardly!
Blessings of Prohibition
There is little need to enumerate
the blessings of prohibition. They are
familiar and incontestable. First of
them, undoubtedly, is the elimination
of the saloon. If it had accomplished
only this, Prohibition would be highly
justified. The incalculable woe which
that evil instigated seems like a bad
dream now. With prohibition of the
advertising and open sale of liquor
much of the temptation for drinking
has been removed, with the result
that the number of new recruits to
alcoholism is rapidly dwindling. In
New York, wettest of cities, first of
fenders? decreased from 24 per 10,000
population for 1914 to only 6 per
10,000 population for 1925. Irving
Fisher, eminent economist at Yale,
says:
"It seems safe to conclude that the
total consumption today is certainly
less than 16 per cent of pre-prohibi
tion consumption, probably less than
10 per cent, and possibly less than
5 per cent."
In a poll conducted by the Literary
Digest 213 college heads represent
ing 44 states and nearly a third of
the total of higher colleges and uni
versities almost unanimously reported
that drinking in the colleges and
drinking by the younger generation as
a whole had decreased. "There are
actually fewer drinkers in the colleges
now than in the days when there were
only one-half the present number of
students." All of this shows that pro
hibition is breaking the chain of con
tinuity by which alcoholism has main
tained its hold for so long.
Drinking Curtailed
Drinking among the laboring class
which used to exact such fearful tolls
has definitely been curtailed, for the
simple reason that, the working class
cannot obtain liquor. Bootleg is re
served for those with fat purses and
slim consciences. This fact has re
sulted in enormous benefit to industry
and society. Poverty has decreased,
and an unparalleled era of prosperity
is now being enjoyed. The money
which he formerly squandered in
drink, the workman now uses to buy
homes, food, automobiles, and other
things which make life more agree
able. Mr. Fisher states:
"I am inclined to believe that Pro
hibition has saved and added much
more than the $<i t 000,000,000 that 1
have estimated as a safe minimum.
If Prohibition enforcement cost us
even $1,000,000,000 a year, it would
be well worthwhile purely as an eco
nomic investment."
President Hoover says in explain
ing modern prosperity:

"In addition to elimination of waste,
we have the benefits of notable ad
vances in (Science, improvement in
methods of management, and Prohi- !
bition." But all of this is as nothing
compared to the fact that Prohibition
is freeing the great mass of Ameri- j
I cans from a slavery to a habit-form
ing drug which is morally and physi- j
cally weakening.
Hearst Temperance Plan
But, it is said, Prohibition is not
necessary to effect these benefits; !
temperance will do it. More and more I
this cry is being heard. Its latest ex
ponent is William Randolph Hearst —
which alone ought to put it under sus
picion. And clearly, the cry of "tem
perance" is but a snare and a delu
sion. Where narcotics, including alco
hol, are involved, moral persuasion
may convince the reason, but it can
not influence a will which has been
weakened by the drug. If reason con
trolled will, there would be no alco
hol problem. But leaders have reached
temperance for centuries without re
sults. The ordinary man is powerless
to restrain himself when alcohol is
to be had. The only solution is to
make alcohol unobtainable. And this
is in accordance with modern physio- j
logical and biological science which
take total abstinence for their ideals.
No one is bold enough to ask for the ;
repeal of the narcotics laws with a
plea for "temperance" in the use of
narcotics. Neither should one be
fooled by an attempt to bring back
the era of alcohol under a thinly
veiled guise of "temperance."
Substitute Deceptions .... j
Just as deceptive are the other sub
stitutes for prohibition which the li- j
quor interests offer. It is obvious that
any compromise between total pro- |
hibition and unlimited alcoholism is |
bound to fail —there can be no com- j
promise between right and wrong. I
Georgia in 1908-16 tried the experi
ment of forbidding distilled liquor, but
of allowing light or near beer. It
tailed. Judge Broyles, then of the po
lice court, Atlanta, said:
"A near-beer law is practically un-!
enforceable, as you can not have a
chemist with every barrel to see that
the beer is light. Besides, men can
get drunk on 2 per cent beer if they
take enough of it."
As to the Canadian system of put
ting the government in the drug busi
ness, Elizabeth Tilton reveals its fu
tility:
"How comes it, if government sale ;
is any sort of solution, that a Mayor j
of Winnipeg where they had Prohibi
tion and now have government sale
says: 'While conditions under Prohibi
tion were bad, the present conditions i
are a thousand times worse.'
j "How comes it, if the cure for boot-)
| legging is the Quebec system, the ;
i bootlegging in Quebec is on the in
' crease and complaints of liquor law
| violations have almost trebled."
First Ten Years Hardest
I Senator Borah exposes the guile be
' hind all of these proposals thusly:
"All this disturbance and all this
j debate are not for the purpose of se-
I curing non-intoxicating liquor. The;
i people insisting upon this change are
; not insisting upon the change for the j
purpose of getting more non-intoxicat- j
ing liquor; but wines and beer such i
as will give them their intoxicating
drinks."
i
The first ten years are the hardest, j
I Prohibition at the present moment is ,
i undergoing the critical period of its |
I existence. Just as is the case with all i
J great reforms, a reaction sets in after
| the reform has been instituted; the
i faults of the existing system are mag
nified, and the evils of the former
period appear hazy in the background
Of course, no great step such as Pro- j
hibition can come into perfection !
overnight. In Prohibition, the United
States is years ahead of the rest of ;
the world, which yet regards the law
as rank fanaticism. But just as surely i
as there is change, the world will
j tollow America's lead in this as it
| has in so many other principles.
Just now, the alcoholic addicts are
! raising a tremendous hue and cry, ;
I greatly disproportionate in noise to
I the actual number of wets. Indeed,
i this great lament seems to nullify
their often repeated assertion that
Prohibition is ineffectual; that liquor j
I is as easily obtainable today as ever.
If this were so, why should any ob- !
I jection be made to the law. (The "per
! sonal liberty" objection is too moth- j
J eaten and discredited to merit discus
sion.) But this howling period will 1
pass, and America will have the credit
for another first step toward world
' betterment.
May Have Come Too Soon
In all fairness, it may be admitted 1
j thnt Constitutional Prohibition may j
have come too soon; before the great
cities of the East had been educated
; to receive it. But wouldn't it be rank j
, folly to start all over again, finally j
I returning to Prohibition after weak j
j half measures and compromises should |

have proved futile? Education should
not stop, however, and should go hand j
in hand with enforcement. President j
Hoover's new policies are including i
education, and should prove of value. |
In the meantime, there is no sub
stitute for rigid enforcement. The
various referenda and repeals of state
laws throughout various sections of
the country have no legal bearing on '
national Prohibition, and smack of j
treason to the Constitution. They are |
efforts to throw sand in the people's j
eyes.
Publicity Unwarranted
It is only to be expected that en- j
forcement so soon after the passage
of the great reform is yet a bit tur- I
bulent. However, much of the pub- j
licity given the enforcement of the j
Eighteenth Amendment is entirely un- j
warranted. Incidents which are of !
daily occurrence in the enforcement j
of other laws are picked up and ban
died about the country by sensational
journals in an effort to show that
Prohibition has introduced a reign of
terror in America. It is not the strict
ness of enforcement which is aggra- j
vating the situation; it is its laxity. !
However, there is no cause for dis- j
conragement. The Fifteenth Amend- j
ment has been in the Constitution
since the Civil War, and has never
been adequately enforced. Of course,
perfect enforcement of any law is
unthinkable—that would be "Utopia."
The experimental part of Prohibition
is its method of enforcement. This,
President Hoover is undertaking vigor
ously, and good results should ensue.
Meanwhile, there must be patience. ,
A nation cannot be reformed in a
day; but as surely as anything is sure, i
great moral advances are too precious
to be lightly discarded. Prohibition is
one of them.

May Have Come Too Soon
In all fairness, it may be admitted 1
j thnt Constitutional Prohibition may j
have come too soon; before the great
cities of the East had been educated
; to receive it. But wouldn't it be rank j
, folly to start all over again, finally j
I returning to Prohibition after weak j
j half measures and compromises should |

have proved futile? Education should
not stop, however, and should go hand j
in hand with enforcement. President j
Hoover's new policies are including i
education, and should prove of value. |
In the meantime, there is no sub
stitute for rigid enforcement. The
various referenda and repeals of state
laws throughout various sections of
the country have no legal bearing on '
national Prohibition, and smack of j
treason to the Constitution. They are |
efforts to throw sand in the people's j
eyes.
Publicity Unwarranted
It is only to be expected that en- j
forcement so soon after the passage
of the great reform is yet a bit tur- I
bulent. However, much of the pub- j
licity given the enforcement of the j
Eighteenth Amendment is entirely un- j
warranted. Incidents which are of !
daily occurrence in the enforcement j
of other laws are picked up and ban
died about the country by sensational
journals in an effort to show that
Prohibition has introduced a reign of
terror in America. It is not the strict
ness of enforcement which is aggra- j
vating the situation; it is its laxity. !
However, there is no cause for dis- j
conragement. The Fifteenth Amend- j
ment has been in the Constitution
since the Civil War, and has never
been adequately enforced. Of course,
perfect enforcement of any law is
unthinkable—that would be "Utopia."
The experimental part of Prohibition
is its method of enforcement. This,
President Hoover is undertaking vigor
ously, and good results should ensue.
Meanwhile, there must be patience. ,
A nation cannot be reformed in a
day; but as surely as anything is sure, i
great moral advances are too precious
to be lightly discarded. Prohibition is
one of them.
(Editor's Notk: The follmving is an article upholding Prohibition. It is pub
lished in line with the Daily's ini estimation- of campus opinion on the matter.)

Prohibition is not merely a noble
experiment. It is a definite advance in
man's moral progress which is as ir
resistible as the other great reforms
which have preceded it. Prohibition
fought its way into our laws and Con
stitution by the sheer force of its in
evitableness, and is destined to re
main there, no matter how vocifer
ously the vested interests, die-hards,
ex-brewers, and unthinking dupes of
their propaganda chafe at it.
Addition to alcohol has been one of
the curses of humanity ever since the
beginning of history. It has poisoned
man's body, inflamed his mind, in
spired incalculable crimes and misery,
and stunted his civilization. Centuries
of experience with alcohol have shown
it, to be the blood brother of murder,
poverty, suicide, slavery, lust, and
wretchedness. Unless the present
American civilization wished to belie
its title of "enlightened," it could do
no other than to refuse longer to
tolerate alcoholism, that parasite upon
its national well-being.
America Has Been Leader
Prohibition has traveled the same
road taken by all the other great
movements which have sought to free
man from his social weaknesses. It
has been cursed, resented, and then
accepted. Like the small boy, mankind
doesn't seem to know what's good for
it; it repulses the very reforms which
are for its highest welfare; it cries
because it cannot poison itself.
In these great advances, America
has been a leader. Her constitution
witnesses to the steady effort of her
people to orientate themselves to pro
gressing culture. With the Thirteenth
Amendment, she abolished slavery;
with the Nineteenth Amendment, she
recognized the political coming of age
of women; with the Eighteenth
Amendment, she freed her citizens
from bondage to drug, and opened up
a new era of physical and moral
health. Does anyone suggest that wo
repeal the Thirteenth Amendment and
reintroduce slavery, or that women
should be deprived of their rights as
citizens? How foolish, then, to undo
the work of decades by getting rid
of Prohibition and reinstating the
reign of alcohol in the United States.
Can we turn back the hands of time,
and undertake a disastrous retrogres
sion in our social progress? Hardly!
Blessings of Prohibition
There is little need to enumerate
the blessings of prohibition. They are
familiar and incontestable. First of
them, undoubtedly, is the elimination
of the saloon. If it had accomplished
only this, Prohibition would be highly
justified. The incalculable woe which
that evil instigated seems like a bad
dream now. With prohibition of the
advertising and open sale of liquor
much of the temptation for drinking
has been removed, with the result
that the number of new recruits to
alcoholism is rapidly dwindling. In
New York, wettest of cities, first of
fenders? decreased from 24 per 10,000
population for 1914 to only 6 per
10,000 population for 1925. Irving
Fisher, eminent economist at Yale,
says:
"It seems safe to conclude that the
total consumption today is certainly
less than 16 per cent of pre-prohibi
tion consumption, probably less than
10 per cent, and possibly less than
5 per cent."
In a poll conducted by the Literary
Digest 213 college heads represent
ing 44 states and nearly a third of
the total of higher colleges and uni
versities almost unanimously reported
that drinking in the colleges and
drinking by the younger generation as
a whole had decreased. "There are
actually fewer drinkers in the colleges
now than in the days when there were
only one-half the present number of
students." All of this shows that pro
hibition is breaking the chain of con
tinuity by which alcoholism has main
tained its hold for so long.
Drinking Curtailed
Drinking among the laboring class
which used to exact such fearful tolls
has definitely been curtailed, for the
simple reason that, the working class
cannot obtain liquor. Bootleg is re
served for those with fat purses and
slim consciences. This fact has re
sulted in enormous benefit to industry
and society. Poverty has decreased,
and an unparalleled era of prosperity
is now being enjoyed. The money
which he formerly squandered in
drink, the workman now uses to buy
homes, food, automobiles, and other
things which make life more agree
able. Mr. Fisher states:
"I am inclined to believe that Pro
hibition has saved and added much
more than the $<i t 000,000,000 that 1
have estimated as a safe minimum.
If Prohibition enforcement cost us
even $1,000,000,000 a year, it would
be well worthwhile purely as an eco
nomic investment."
President Hoover says in explain
ing modern prosperity:

"In addition to elimination of waste,
we have the benefits of notable ad
vances in (Science, improvement in
methods of management, and Prohi- !
bition." But all of this is as nothing
compared to the fact that Prohibition
is freeing the great mass of Ameri- j
I cans from a slavery to a habit-form
ing drug which is morally and physi- j
cally weakening.
Hearst Temperance Plan
But, it is said, Prohibition is not
necessary to effect these benefits; !
temperance will do it. More and more I
this cry is being heard. Its latest ex
ponent is William Randolph Hearst —
which alone ought to put it under sus
picion. And clearly, the cry of "tem
perance" is but a snare and a delu
sion. Where narcotics, including alco
hol, are involved, moral persuasion
may convince the reason, but it can
not influence a will which has been
weakened by the drug. If reason con
trolled will, there would be no alco
hol problem. But leaders have reached
temperance for centuries without re
sults. The ordinary man is powerless
to restrain himself when alcohol is
to be had. The only solution is to
make alcohol unobtainable. And this
is in accordance with modern physio- j
logical and biological science which
take total abstinence for their ideals.
No one is bold enough to ask for the ;
repeal of the narcotics laws with a
plea for "temperance" in the use of
narcotics. Neither should one be
fooled by an attempt to bring back
the era of alcohol under a thinly
veiled guise of "temperance."
Substitute Deceptions .... j
Just as deceptive are the other sub
stitutes for prohibition which the li- j
quor interests offer. It is obvious that
any compromise between total pro- |
hibition and unlimited alcoholism is |
bound to fail —there can be no com- j
promise between right and wrong. I
Georgia in 1908-16 tried the experi
ment of forbidding distilled liquor, but
of allowing light or near beer. It
tailed. Judge Broyles, then of the po
lice court, Atlanta, said:
"A near-beer law is practically un-!
enforceable, as you can not have a
chemist with every barrel to see that
the beer is light. Besides, men can
get drunk on 2 per cent beer if they
take enough of it."
As to the Canadian system of put
ting the government in the drug busi
ness, Elizabeth Tilton reveals its fu
tility:
"How comes it, if government sale ;
is any sort of solution, that a Mayor j
of Winnipeg where they had Prohibi
tion and now have government sale
says: 'While conditions under Prohibi
tion were bad, the present conditions i
are a thousand times worse.'
j "How comes it, if the cure for boot-)
| legging is the Quebec system, the ;
i bootlegging in Quebec is on the in
' crease and complaints of liquor law
| violations have almost trebled."
First Ten Years Hardest
I Senator Borah exposes the guile be
' hind all of these proposals thusly:
"All this disturbance and all this
j debate are not for the purpose of se-
I curing non-intoxicating liquor. The;
i people insisting upon this change are
; not insisting upon the change for the j

able. Mr. Fisher states:
"I am inclined to believe that Pro
hibition has saved and added much
more than the $<i t 000,000,000 that 1
have estimated as a safe minimum.
If Prohibition enforcement cost us
even $1,000,000,000 a year, it would
be well worthwhile purely as an eco
nomic investment."
President Hoover says in explain
ing modern prosperity:

"In addition to elimination of waste,
we have the benefits of notable ad
vances in (Science, improvement in
methods of management, and Prohi- !
bition." But all of this is as nothing
compared to the fact that Prohibition
is freeing the great mass of Ameri- j
I cans from a slavery to a habit-form
ing drug which is morally and physi- j
cally weakening.
Hearst Temperance Plan
But, it is said, Prohibition is not
necessary to effect these benefits; !
temperance will do it. More and more I
this cry is being heard. Its latest ex
ponent is William Randolph Hearst —
which alone ought to put it under sus
picion. And clearly, the cry of "tem
perance" is but a snare and a delu
sion. Where narcotics, including alco
hol, are involved, moral persuasion
may convince the reason, but it can
not influence a will which has been
weakened by the drug. If reason con
trolled will, there would be no alco
hol problem. But leaders have reached
temperance for centuries without re
sults. The ordinary man is powerless
to restrain himself when alcohol is
to be had. The only solution is to
make alcohol unobtainable. And this
is in accordance with modern physio- j
logical and biological science which
take total abstinence for their ideals.
No one is bold enough to ask for the ;
repeal of the narcotics laws with a
plea for "temperance" in the use of
narcotics. Neither should one be
fooled by an attempt to bring back
the era of alcohol under a thinly
veiled guise of "temperance."
Substitute Deceptions .... j
Just as deceptive are the other sub
stitutes for prohibition which the li- j
quor interests offer. It is obvious that
any compromise between total pro- |
hibition and unlimited alcoholism is |
bound to fail —there can be no com- j
promise between right and wrong. I
Georgia in 1908-16 tried the experi
ment of forbidding distilled liquor, but
of allowing light or near beer. It
tailed. Judge Broyles, then of the po
lice court, Atlanta, said:
"A near-beer law is practically un-!
enforceable, as you can not have a
chemist with every barrel to see that
the beer is light. Besides, men can
get drunk on 2 per cent beer if they
take enough of it."
As to the Canadian system of put
ting the government in the drug busi
ness, Elizabeth Tilton reveals its fu
tility:
"How comes it, if government sale ;
is any sort of solution, that a Mayor j
of Winnipeg where they had Prohibi
tion and now have government sale
says: 'While conditions under Prohibi
tion were bad, the present conditions i

First Ten Years Hardest
I Senator Borah exposes the guile be

i people insisting upon this change are
; not insisting upon the change for the j
purpose of getting more non-intoxicat- j
ing liquor; but wines and beer such i
as will give them their intoxicating
drinks."
i
The first ten years are the hardest, j
I Prohibition at the present moment is ,
i undergoing the critical period of its |
I existence. Just as is the case with all i
J great reforms, a reaction sets in after
| the reform has been instituted; the
i faults of the existing system are mag
nified, and the evils of the former
period appear hazy in the background
Of course, no great step such as Pro- j
hibition can come into perfection !
overnight. In Prohibition, the United
States is years ahead of the rest of ;
the world, which yet regards the law
as rank fanaticism. But just as surely i
as there is change, the world will
j tollow America's lead in this as it
| has in so many other principles.
Just now, the alcoholic addicts are
! raising a tremendous hue and cry, ;
I greatly disproportionate in noise to
I the actual number of wets. Indeed,
i this great lament seems to nullify
their often repeated assertion that
Prohibition is ineffectual; that liquor j
I is as easily obtainable today as ever.
If this were so, why should any ob- !

May Have Come Too Soon
In all fairness, it may be admitted 1
j thnt Constitutional Prohibition may j
have come too soon; before the great
cities of the East had been educated
; to receive it. But wouldn't it be rank j
, folly to start all over again, finally j
I returning to Prohibition after weak j
j half measures and compromises should |

have proved futile? Education should
not stop, however, and should go hand j
in hand with enforcement. President j
Hoover's new policies are including i
education, and should prove of value. |
In the meantime, there is no sub
stitute for rigid enforcement. The
various referenda and repeals of state
laws throughout various sections of
the country have no legal bearing on '
national Prohibition, and smack of j
treason to the Constitution. They are |
efforts to throw sand in the people's j
eyes.
Publicity Unwarranted
It is only to be expected that en- j
forcement so soon after the passage
of the great reform is yet a bit tur- I
bulent. However, much of the pub- j
licity given the enforcement of the j
Eighteenth Amendment is entirely un- j
warranted. Incidents which are of !
daily occurrence in the enforcement j
of other laws are picked up and ban
died about the country by sensational
journals in an effort to show that
Prohibition has introduced a reign of
terror in America. It is not the strict
ness of enforcement which is aggra- j
vating the situation; it is its laxity. !
However, there is no cause for dis- j
conragement. The Fifteenth Amend- j
ment has been in the Constitution
since the Civil War, and has never
been adequately enforced. Of course,
perfect enforcement of any law is
unthinkable—that would be "Utopia."
The experimental part of Prohibition
is its method of enforcement. This,
President Hoover is undertaking vigor
ously, and good results should ensue.
Meanwhile, there must be patience. ,
A nation cannot be reformed in a
day; but as surely as anything is sure, i
great moral advances are too precious
to be lightly discarded. Prohibition is
one of them.
(Editor's Notk: The follmving is an article upholding Prohibition. It is pub
lished in line with the Daily's ini estimation- of campus opinion on the matter.)

Prohibition is not merely a noble
experiment. It is a definite advance in
man's moral progress which is as ir
resistible as the other great reforms
which have preceded it. Prohibition
fought its way into our laws and Con
stitution by the sheer force of its in
evitableness, and is destined to re
main there, no matter how vocifer
ously the vested interests, die-hards,
ex-brewers, and unthinking dupes of
their propaganda chafe at it.
Addition to alcohol has been one of
the curses of humanity ever since the
beginning of history. It has poisoned
man's body, inflamed his mind, in
spired incalculable crimes and misery,
and stunted his civilization. Centuries
of experience with alcohol have shown
it, to be the blood brother of murder,
poverty, suicide, slavery, lust, and
wretchedness. Unless the present
American civilization wished to belie
its title of "enlightened," it could do
no other than to refuse longer to
tolerate alcoholism, that parasite upon
its national well-being.
America Has Been Leader
Prohibition has traveled the same
road taken by all the other great
movements which have sought to free
man from his social weaknesses. It
has been cursed, resented, and then
accepted. Like the small boy, mankind
doesn't seem to know what's good for
it; it repulses the very reforms which
are for its highest welfare; it cries
because it cannot poison itself.
In these great advances, America
has been a leader. Her constitution
witnesses to the steady effort of her
people to orientate themselves to pro
gressing culture. With the Thirteenth
Amendment, she abolished slavery;
with the Nineteenth Amendment, she
recognized the political coming of age
of women; with the Eighteenth
Amendment, she freed her citizens
from bondage to drug, and opened up
a new era of physical and moral
health. Does anyone suggest that wo
repeal the Thirteenth Amendment and
reintroduce slavery, or that women
should be deprived of their rights as
citizens? How foolish, then, to undo
the work of decades by getting rid
of Prohibition and reinstating the
reign of alcohol in the United States.
Can we turn back the hands of time,
and undertake a disastrous retrogres
sion in our social progress? Hardly!
Blessings of Prohibition
There is little need to enumerate
the blessings of prohibition. They are
familiar and incontestable. First of
them, undoubtedly, is the elimination
of the saloon. If it had accomplished
only this, Prohibition would be highly
justified. The incalculable woe which
that evil instigated seems like a bad
dream now. With prohibition of the
advertising and open sale of liquor
much of the temptation for drinking
has been removed, with the result
that the number of new recruits to
alcoholism is rapidly dwindling. In
New York, wettest of cities, first of
fenders? decreased from 24 per 10,000
population for 1914 to only 6 per
10,000 population for 1925. Irving
Fisher, eminent economist at Yale,
says:
"It seems safe to conclude that the
total consumption today is certainly
less than 16 per cent of pre-prohibi
tion consumption, probably less than
10 per cent, and possibly less than
5 per cent."
In a poll conducted by the Literary
Digest 213 college heads represent
ing 44 states and nearly a third of
the total of higher colleges and uni
versities almost unanimously reported
that drinking in the colleges and
drinking by the younger generation as
a whole had decreased. "There are
actually fewer drinkers in the colleges
now than in the days when there were
only one-half the present number of
students." All of this shows that pro
hibition is breaking the chain of con
tinuity by which alcoholism has main
tained its hold for so long.
Drinking Curtailed
Drinking among the laboring class
which used to exact such fearful tolls
has definitely been curtailed, for the
simple reason that, the working class
cannot obtain liquor. Bootleg is re
served for those with fat purses and
slim consciences. This fact has re
sulted in enormous benefit to industry
and society. Poverty has decreased,
and an unparalleled era of prosperity
is now being enjoyed. The money
which he formerly squandered in
drink, the workman now uses to buy
homes, food, automobiles, and other
things which make life more agree
able. Mr. Fisher states:
"I am inclined to believe that Pro
hibition has saved and added much
more than the $<i t 000,000,000 that 1
have estimated as a safe minimum.
If Prohibition enforcement cost us
even $1,000,000,000 a year, it would
be well worthwhile purely as an eco
nomic investment."

we have the benefits of notable ad

it, to be the blood brother of murder,
poverty, suicide, slavery, lust, and
wretchedness. Unless the present
American civilization wished to belie
its title of "enlightened," it could do
no other than to refuse longer to
tolerate alcoholism, that parasite upon
its national well-being.
America Has Been Leader
Prohibition has traveled the same
road taken by all the other great
movements which have sought to free
man from his social weaknesses. It
has been cursed, resented, and then
accepted. Like the small boy, mankind
doesn't seem to know what's good for
it; it repulses the very reforms which
are for its highest welfare; it cries
because it cannot poison itself.
In these great advances, America
has been a leader. Her constitution
witnesses to the steady effort of her
people to orientate themselves to pro
gressing culture. With the Thirteenth
Amendment, she abolished slavery;
with the Nineteenth Amendment, she
recognized the political coming of age
of women; with the Eighteenth
Amendment, she freed her citizens
from bondage to drug, and opened up
a new era of physical and moral
health. Does anyone suggest that wo
repeal the Thirteenth Amendment and
reintroduce slavery, or that women
should be deprived of their rights as
citizens? How foolish, then, to undo
the work of decades by getting rid
of Prohibition and reinstating the
reign of alcohol in the United States.
Can we turn back the hands of time,
and undertake a disastrous retrogres
sion in our social progress? Hardly!
Blessings of Prohibition
There is little need to enumerate
the blessings of prohibition. They are
familiar and incontestable. First of
them, undoubtedly, is the elimination
of the saloon. If it had accomplished
only this, Prohibition would be highly
justified. The incalculable woe which
that evil instigated seems like a bad
dream now. With prohibition of the
advertising and open sale of liquor
much of the temptation for drinking
has been removed, with the result
that the number of new recruits to
alcoholism is rapidly dwindling. In
New York, wettest of cities, first of
fenders? decreased from 24 per 10,000
population for 1914 to only 6 per
10,000 population for 1925. Irving
Fisher, eminent economist at Yale,
says:
"It seems safe to conclude that the
total consumption today is certainly
less than 16 per cent of pre-prohibi
tion consumption, probably less than
10 per cent, and possibly less than
5 per cent."
In a poll conducted by the Literary
Digest 213 college heads represent
ing 44 states and nearly a third of
the total of higher colleges and uni
versities almost unanimously reported
that drinking in the colleges and
drinking by the younger generation as
a whole had decreased. "There are
actually fewer drinkers in the colleges
now than in the days when there were
only one-half the present number of
students." All of this shows that pro
hibition is breaking the chain of con
tinuity by which alcoholism has main
tained its hold for so long.
Drinking Curtailed
Drinking among the laboring class
which used to exact such fearful tolls
has definitely been curtailed, for the
simple reason that, the working class
cannot obtain liquor. Bootleg is re
served for those with fat purses and
slim consciences. This fact has re
sulted in enormous benefit to industry
and society. Poverty has decreased,
and an unparalleled era of prosperity
is now being enjoyed. The money
which he formerly squandered in
drink, the workman now uses to buy
homes, food, automobiles, and other
things which make life more agree
able. Mr. Fisher states:
"I am inclined to believe that Pro
hibition has saved and added much
more than the $<i t 000,000,000 that 1
have estimated as a safe minimum.
If Prohibition enforcement cost us
even $1,000,000,000 a year, it would
be well worthwhile purely as an eco
nomic investment."
President Hoover says in explain
ing modern prosperity:

"In addition to elimination of waste,
we have the benefits of notable ad
vances in (Science, improvement in
methods of management, and Prohi- !
bition." But all of this is as nothing
compared to the fact that Prohibition
is freeing the great mass of Ameri- j
I cans from a slavery to a habit-form
ing drug which is morally and physi- j
cally weakening.
Hearst Temperance Plan
But, it is said, Prohibition is not
necessary to effect these benefits; !
temperance will do it. More and more I
this cry is being heard. Its latest ex
ponent is William Randolph Hearst —
which alone ought to put it under sus
picion. And clearly, the cry of "tem
perance" is but a snare and a delu
sion. Where narcotics, including alco
hol, are involved, moral persuasion
may convince the reason, but it can
not influence a will which has been
weakened by the drug. If reason con
trolled will, there would be no alco
hol problem. But leaders have reached
temperance for centuries without re
sults. The ordinary man is powerless
to restrain himself when alcohol is
to be had. The only solution is to
make alcohol unobtainable. And this
is in accordance with modern physio- j
logical and biological science which
take total abstinence for their ideals.
No one is bold enough to ask for the ;
repeal of the narcotics laws with a
plea for "temperance" in the use of
narcotics. Neither should one be
fooled by an attempt to bring back
the era of alcohol under a thinly
veiled guise of "temperance."
Substitute Deceptions .... j
Just as deceptive are the other sub
stitutes for prohibition which the li- j
quor interests offer. It is obvious that
any compromise between total pro- |
hibition and unlimited alcoholism is |
bound to fail —there can be no com- j
promise between right and wrong. I
Georgia in 1908-16 tried the experi
ment of forbidding distilled liquor, but
of allowing light or near beer. It
tailed. Judge Broyles, then of the po
lice court, Atlanta, said:
"A near-beer law is practically un-!
enforceable, as you can not have a
chemist with every barrel to see that
the beer is light. Besides, men can
get drunk on 2 per cent beer if they
take enough of it."
As to the Canadian system of put
ting the government in the drug busi
ness, Elizabeth Tilton reveals its fu
tility:
"How comes it, if government sale ;
is any sort of solution, that a Mayor j
of Winnipeg where they had Prohibi
tion and now have government sale
says: 'While conditions under Prohibi
tion were bad, the present conditions i
are a thousand times worse.'
j "How comes it, if the cure for boot-)
| legging is the Quebec system, the ;
i bootlegging in Quebec is on the in
' crease and complaints of liquor law
| violations have almost trebled."
First Ten Years Hardest
I Senator Borah exposes the guile be
' hind all of these proposals thusly:
"All this disturbance and all this
j debate are not for the purpose of se-
I curing non-intoxicating liquor. The;
i people insisting upon this change are
; not insisting upon the change for the j
purpose of getting more non-intoxicat- j
ing liquor; but wines and beer such i
as will give them their intoxicating
drinks."
i
The first ten years are the hardest, j
I Prohibition at the present moment is ,
i undergoing the critical period of its |
I existence. Just as is the case with all i
J great reforms, a reaction sets in after
| the reform has been instituted; the
i faults of the existing system are mag
nified, and the evils of the former
period appear hazy in the background
Of course, no great step such as Pro- j
hibition can come into perfection !
overnight. In Prohibition, the United
States is years ahead of the rest of ;
the world, which yet regards the law
as rank fanaticism. But just as surely i
as there is change, the world will
j tollow America's lead in this as it
| has in so many other principles.
Just now, the alcoholic addicts are
! raising a tremendous hue and cry, ;
I greatly disproportionate in noise to
I the actual number of wets. Indeed,
i this great lament seems to nullify
their often repeated assertion that
Prohibition is ineffectual; that liquor j
I is as easily obtainable today as ever.
If this were so, why should any ob- !
I jection be made to the law. (The "per
! sonal liberty" objection is too moth- j
J eaten and discredited to merit discus
sion.) But this howling period will 1
pass, and America will have the credit
for another first step toward world
' betterment.
May Have Come Too Soon
In all fairness, it may be admitted 1
j thnt Constitutional Prohibition may j
have come too soon; before the great
cities of the East had been educated
; to receive it. But wouldn't it be rank j
, folly to start all over again, finally j
I returning to Prohibition after weak j
j half measures and compromises should |

have proved futile? Education should
not stop, however, and should go hand j
in hand with enforcement. President j
Hoover's new policies are including i
education, and should prove of value. |
In the meantime, there is no sub
stitute for rigid enforcement. The
various referenda and repeals of state
laws throughout various sections of
the country have no legal bearing on '
national Prohibition, and smack of j
treason to the Constitution. They are |
efforts to throw sand in the people's j
eyes.
Publicity Unwarranted
It is only to be expected that en- j
forcement so soon after the passage
of the great reform is yet a bit tur- I
bulent. However, much of the pub- j
licity given the enforcement of the j
Eighteenth Amendment is entirely un- j
warranted. Incidents which are of !
daily occurrence in the enforcement j
of other laws are picked up and ban
died about the country by sensational
journals in an effort to show that
Prohibition has introduced a reign of
terror in America. It is not the strict
ness of enforcement which is aggra- j
vating the situation; it is its laxity. !
However, there is no cause for dis- j
conragement. The Fifteenth Amend- j
ment has been in the Constitution
since the Civil War, and has never
been adequately enforced. Of course,
perfect enforcement of any law is
unthinkable—that would be "Utopia."
The experimental part of Prohibition
is its method of enforcement. This,
President Hoover is undertaking vigor
ously, and good results should ensue.
Meanwhile, there must be patience. ,
A nation cannot be reformed in a
day; but as surely as anything is sure, i
great moral advances are too precious
to be lightly discarded. Prohibition is
one of them.
(Editor's Notk: The follmving is an article upholding Prohibition. It is pub
lished in line with the Daily's ini estimation- of campus opinion on the matter.)

Prohibition is not merely a noble
experiment. It is a definite advance in
man's moral progress which is as ir
resistible as the other great reforms
which have preceded it. Prohibition
fought its way into our laws and Con
stitution by the sheer force of its in
evitableness, and is destined to re
main there, no matter how vocifer
ously the vested interests, die-hards,
ex-brewers, and unthinking dupes of
their propaganda chafe at it.
Addition to alcohol has been one of
the curses of humanity ever since the
beginning of history. It has poisoned
man's body, inflamed his mind, in
spired incalculable crimes and misery,
and stunted his civilization. Centuries
of experience with alcohol have shown
it, to be the blood brother of murder,
poverty, suicide, slavery, lust, and
wretchedness. Unless the present
American civilization wished to belie
its title of "enlightened," it could do
no other than to refuse longer to

May Have Come Too Soon
In all fairness, it may be admitted 1
j thnt Constitutional Prohibition may j
have come too soon; before the great
cities of the East had been educated
; to receive it. But wouldn't it be rank j
, folly to start all over again, finally j
I returning to Prohibition after weak j
j half measures and compromises should |

have proved futile? Education should
not stop, however, and should go hand j
in hand with enforcement. President j
Hoover's new policies are including i
education, and should prove of value. |
In the meantime, there is no sub
stitute for rigid enforcement. The
various referenda and repeals of state
laws throughout various sections of
the country have no legal bearing on '
national Prohibition, and smack of j
treason to the Constitution. They are |
efforts to throw sand in the people's j
eyes.
Publicity Unwarranted
It is only to be expected that en- j
forcement so soon after the passage
of the great reform is yet a bit tur- I
bulent. However, much of the pub- j
licity given the enforcement of the j
Eighteenth Amendment is entirely un- j
warranted. Incidents which are of !
daily occurrence in the enforcement j
of other laws are picked up and ban
died about the country by sensational
journals in an effort to show that
Prohibition has introduced a reign of
terror in America. It is not the strict
ness of enforcement which is aggra- j
vating the situation; it is its laxity. !
However, there is no cause for dis- j
conragement. The Fifteenth Amend- j
ment has been in the Constitution
since the Civil War, and has never
been adequately enforced. Of course,
perfect enforcement of any law is
unthinkable—that would be "Utopia."
The experimental part of Prohibition
is its method of enforcement. This,
President Hoover is undertaking vigor
ously, and good results should ensue.
Meanwhile, there must be patience. ,
A nation cannot be reformed in a
day; but as surely as anything is sure, i
great moral advances are too precious
to be lightly discarded. Prohibition is
one of them.

Prohibition is not merely a noble
experiment. It is a definite advance in
man's moral progress which is as ir
resistible as the other great reforms
which have preceded it. Prohibition
fought its way into our laws and Con
stitution by the sheer force of its in
evitableness, and is destined to re
main there, no matter how vocifer
ously the vested interests, die-hards,
ex-brewers, and unthinking dupes of
their propaganda chafe at it.
Addition to alcohol has been one of
the curses of humanity ever since the
beginning of history. It has poisoned
man's body, inflamed his mind, in
spired incalculable crimes and misery,
and stunted his civilization. Centuries
of experience with alcohol have shown
it, to be the blood brother of murder,
poverty, suicide, slavery, lust, and
wretchedness. Unless the present
American civilization wished to belie
its title of "enlightened," it could do
no other than to refuse longer to
tolerate alcoholism, that parasite upon
its national well-being.
America Has Been Leader
Prohibition has traveled the same
road taken by all the other great
movements which have sought to free
man from his social weaknesses. It
has been cursed, resented, and then
accepted. Like the small boy, mankind
doesn't seem to know what's good for
it; it repulses the very reforms which
are for its highest welfare; it cries
because it cannot poison itself.
In these great advances, America
has been a leader. Her constitution
witnesses to the steady effort of her
people to orientate themselves to pro
gressing culture. With the Thirteenth
Amendment, she abolished slavery;
with the Nineteenth Amendment, she
recognized the political coming of age
of women; with the Eighteenth
Amendment, she freed her citizens
from bondage to drug, and opened up
a new era of physical and moral
health. Does anyone suggest that wo
repeal the Thirteenth Amendment and
reintroduce slavery, or that women
should be deprived of their rights as
citizens? How foolish, then, to undo
the work of decades by getting rid
of Prohibition and reinstating the
reign of alcohol in the United States.
Can we turn back the hands of time,
and undertake a disastrous retrogres
sion in our social progress? Hardly!
Blessings of Prohibition
There is little need to enumerate
the blessings of prohibition. They are
familiar and incontestable. First of
them, undoubtedly, is the elimination
of the saloon. If it had accomplished
only this, Prohibition would be highly
justified. The incalculable woe which
that evil instigated seems like a bad
dream now. With prohibition of the
advertising and open sale of liquor
much of the temptation for drinking
has been removed, with the result
that the number of new recruits to
alcoholism is rapidly dwindling. In
New York, wettest of cities, first of
fenders? decreased from 24 per 10,000
population for 1914 to only 6 per
10,000 population for 1925. Irving
Fisher, eminent economist at Yale,
says:
"It seems safe to conclude that the
total consumption today is certainly
less than 16 per cent of pre-prohibi
tion consumption, probably less than
10 per cent, and possibly less than
5 per cent."
In a poll conducted by the Literary
Digest 213 college heads represent
ing 44 states and nearly a third of
the total of higher colleges and uni
versities almost unanimously reported
that drinking in the colleges and
drinking by the younger generation as
a whole had decreased. "There are
actually fewer drinkers in the colleges
now than in the days when there were
only one-half the present number of
students." All of this shows that pro
hibition is breaking the chain of con
tinuity by which alcoholism has main
tained its hold for so long.
Drinking Curtailed
Drinking among the laboring class
which used to exact such fearful tolls
has definitely been curtailed, for the
simple reason that, the working class
cannot obtain liquor. Bootleg is re
served for those with fat purses and
slim consciences. This fact has re
sulted in enormous benefit to industry
and society. Poverty has decreased,
and an unparalleled era of prosperity
is now being enjoyed. The money
which he formerly squandered in
drink, the workman now uses to buy
homes, food, automobiles, and other
things which make life more agree
able. Mr. Fisher states:
"I am inclined to believe that Pro
hibition has saved and added much
more than the $<i t 000,000,000 that 1
have estimated as a safe minimum.
If Prohibition enforcement cost us
even $1,000,000,000 a year, it would
be well worthwhile purely as an eco
nomic investment."
President Hoover says in explain
ing modern prosperity:

"In addition to elimination of waste,
we have the benefits of notable ad
vances in (Science, improvement in
methods of management, and Prohi- !
bition." But all of this is as nothing
compared to the fact that Prohibition
is freeing the great mass of Ameri- j
I cans from a slavery to a habit-form
ing drug which is morally and physi- j
cally weakening.
Hearst Temperance Plan
But, it is said, Prohibition is not
necessary to effect these benefits; !
temperance will do it. More and more I
this cry is being heard. Its latest ex
ponent is William Randolph Hearst —
which alone ought to put it under sus
picion. And clearly, the cry of "tem
perance" is but a snare and a delu
sion. Where narcotics, including alco
hol, are involved, moral persuasion
may convince the reason, but it can
not influence a will which has been
weakened by the drug. If reason con
trolled will, there would be no alco
hol problem. But leaders have reached
temperance for centuries without re
sults. The ordinary man is powerless
to restrain himself when alcohol is
to be had. The only solution is to
make alcohol unobtainable. And this
is in accordance with modern physio- j
logical and biological science which
take total abstinence for their ideals.
No one is bold enough to ask for the ;
repeal of the narcotics laws with a
plea for "temperance" in the use of
narcotics. Neither should one be
fooled by an attempt to bring back
the era of alcohol under a thinly
veiled guise of "temperance."
Substitute Deceptions .... j
Just as deceptive are the other sub
stitutes for prohibition which the li- j
quor interests offer. It is obvious that
any compromise between total pro- |
hibition and unlimited alcoholism is |
bound to fail —there can be no com- j
promise between right and wrong. I
Georgia in 1908-16 tried the experi
ment of forbidding distilled liquor, but
of allowing light or near beer. It
tailed. Judge Broyles, then of the po
lice court, Atlanta, said:
"A near-beer law is practically un-!
enforceable, as you can not have a
chemist with every barrel to see that
the beer is light. Besides, men can
get drunk on 2 per cent beer if they
take enough of it."
As to the Canadian system of put
ting the government in the drug busi
ness, Elizabeth Tilton reveals its fu
tility:
"How comes it, if government sale ;
is any sort of solution, that a Mayor j
of Winnipeg where they had Prohibi
tion and now have government sale
says: 'While conditions under Prohibi
tion were bad, the present conditions i
are a thousand times worse.'
j "How comes it, if the cure for boot-)
| legging is the Quebec system, the ;
i bootlegging in Quebec is on the in
' crease and complaints of liquor law
| violations have almost trebled."
First Ten Years Hardest
I Senator Borah exposes the guile be
' hind all of these proposals thusly:
"All this disturbance and all this
j debate are not for the purpose of se-
I curing non-intoxicating liquor. The;
i people insisting upon this change are
; not insisting upon the change for the j
purpose of getting more non-intoxicat- j
ing liquor; but wines and beer such i
as will give them their intoxicating
drinks."
i
The first ten years are the hardest, j
I Prohibition at the present moment is ,
i undergoing the critical period of its |
I existence. Just as is the case with all i
J great reforms, a reaction sets in after
| the reform has been instituted; the
i faults of the existing system are mag
nified, and the evils of the former
period appear hazy in the background
Of course, no great step such as Pro- j
hibition can come into perfection !
overnight. In Prohibition, the United
States is years ahead of the rest of ;
the world, which yet regards the law
as rank fanaticism. But just as surely i
as there is change, the world will
j tollow America's lead in this as it
| has in so many other principles.
Just now, the alcoholic addicts are
! raising a tremendous hue and cry, ;
I greatly disproportionate in noise to
I the actual number of wets. Indeed,
i this great lament seems to nullify
their often repeated assertion that
Prohibition is ineffectual; that liquor j
I is as easily obtainable today as ever.

Substitute Deceptions .... j
Just as deceptive are the other sub

quor interests offer. It is obvious that
any compromise between total pro- |
hibition and unlimited alcoholism is |
bound to fail —there can be no com- j
promise between right and wrong. I
Georgia in 1908-16 tried the experi
ment of forbidding distilled liquor, but
of allowing light or near beer. It
tailed. Judge Broyles, then of the po
lice court, Atlanta, said:
"A near-beer law is practically un-!
enforceable, as you can not have a
chemist with every barrel to see that
the beer is light. Besides, men can
get drunk on 2 per cent beer if they
take enough of it."
As to the Canadian system of put
ting the government in the drug busi
ness, Elizabeth Tilton reveals its fu
tility:
"How comes it, if government sale ;
is any sort of solution, that a Mayor j
of Winnipeg where they had Prohibi
tion and now have government sale
says: 'While conditions under Prohibi
tion were bad, the present conditions i

First Ten Years Hardest

as will give them their intoxicating
drinks."
i
The first ten years are the hardest, j
I Prohibition at the present moment is ,

i faults of the existing system are mag

period appear hazy in the background
Of course, no great step such as Pro- j
hibition can come into perfection !
overnight. In Prohibition, the United
States is years ahead of the rest of ;
the world, which yet regards the law
as rank fanaticism. But just as surely i
as there is change, the world will
j tollow America's lead in this as it
| has in so many other principles.
Just now, the alcoholic addicts are

I greatly disproportionate in noise to

i this great lament seems to nullify

I is as easily obtainable today as ever.
If this were so, why should any ob- !

May Have Come Too Soon
In all fairness, it may be admitted 1
j thnt Constitutional Prohibition may j
have come too soon; before the great
cities of the East had been educated
; to receive it. But wouldn't it be rank j
, folly to start all over again, finally j
I returning to Prohibition after weak j
j half measures and compromises should |

have proved futile? Education should
not stop, however, and should go hand j
in hand with enforcement. President j
Hoover's new policies are including i
education, and should prove of value. |
In the meantime, there is no sub
stitute for rigid enforcement. The
various referenda and repeals of state
laws throughout various sections of
the country have no legal bearing on '
national Prohibition, and smack of j
treason to the Constitution. They are |
efforts to throw sand in the people's j
eyes.
Publicity Unwarranted
It is only to be expected that en- j
forcement so soon after the passage
of the great reform is yet a bit tur- I
bulent. However, much of the pub- j
licity given the enforcement of the j
Eighteenth Amendment is entirely un- j
warranted. Incidents which are of !
daily occurrence in the enforcement j
of other laws are picked up and ban
died about the country by sensational
journals in an effort to show that
Prohibition has introduced a reign of
terror in America. It is not the strict
ness of enforcement which is aggra- j
vating the situation; it is its laxity. !
However, there is no cause for dis- j
conragement. The Fifteenth Amend- j
ment has been in the Constitution
since the Civil War, and has never
been adequately enforced. Of course,
perfect enforcement of any law is
unthinkable—that would be "Utopia."
The experimental part of Prohibition
is its method of enforcement. This,
President Hoover is undertaking vigor
ously, and good results should ensue.
Meanwhile, there must be patience. ,
A nation cannot be reformed in a
day; but as surely as anything is sure, i
great moral advances are too precious
to be lightly discarded. Prohibition is
one of them.

Prohibition is not merely a noble
experiment. It is a definite advance in
man's moral progress which is as ir
resistible as the other great reforms
which have preceded it. Prohibition
fought its way into our laws and Con
stitution by the sheer force of its in
evitableness, and is destined to re
main there, no matter how vocifer
ously the vested interests, die-hards,
ex-brewers, and unthinking dupes of
their propaganda chafe at it.
Addition to alcohol has been one of
the curses of humanity ever since the
beginning of history. It has poisoned
man's body, inflamed his mind, in
spired incalculable crimes and misery,
and stunted his civilization. Centuries
of experience with alcohol have shown
it, to be the blood brother of murder,
poverty, suicide, slavery, lust, and
wretchedness. Unless the present
American civilization wished to belie
its title of "enlightened," it could do
no other than to refuse longer to
tolerate alcoholism, that parasite upon
its national well-being.
America Has Been Leader
Prohibition has traveled the same
road taken by all the other great
movements which have sought to free
man from his social weaknesses. It
has been cursed, resented, and then
accepted. Like the small boy, mankind
doesn't seem to know what's good for
it; it repulses the very reforms which
are for its highest welfare; it cries
because it cannot poison itself.
In these great advances, America
has been a leader. Her constitution
witnesses to the steady effort of her
people to orientate themselves to pro
gressing culture. With the Thirteenth
Amendment, she abolished slavery;
with the Nineteenth Amendment, she
recognized the political coming of age
of women; with the Eighteenth
Amendment, she freed her citizens
from bondage to drug, and opened up
a new era of physical and moral
health. Does anyone suggest that wo
repeal the Thirteenth Amendment and
reintroduce slavery, or that women
should be deprived of their rights as
citizens? How foolish, then, to undo
the work of decades by getting rid
of Prohibition and reinstating the
reign of alcohol in the United States.
Can we turn back the hands of time,
and undertake a disastrous retrogres
sion in our social progress? Hardly!
Blessings of Prohibition
There is little need to enumerate
the blessings of prohibition. They are
familiar and incontestable. First of
them, undoubtedly, is the elimination
of the saloon. If it had accomplished
only this, Prohibition would be highly
justified. The incalculable woe which
that evil instigated seems like a bad
dream now. With prohibition of the
advertising and open sale of liquor
much of the temptation for drinking
has been removed, with the result
that the number of new recruits to
alcoholism is rapidly dwindling. In
New York, wettest of cities, first of
fenders? decreased from 24 per 10,000
population for 1914 to only 6 per
10,000 population for 1925. Irving
Fisher, eminent economist at Yale,
says:
"It seems safe to conclude that the
total consumption today is certainly
less than 16 per cent of pre-prohibi
tion consumption, probably less than
10 per cent, and possibly less than
5 per cent."
In a poll conducted by the Literary
Digest 213 college heads represent
ing 44 states and nearly a third of
the total of higher colleges and uni
versities almost unanimously reported
that drinking in the colleges and
drinking by the younger generation as
a whole had decreased. "There are
actually fewer drinkers in the colleges
now than in the days when there were
only one-half the present number of
students." All of this shows that pro
hibition is breaking the chain of con
tinuity by which alcoholism has main
tained its hold for so long.
Drinking Curtailed
Drinking among the laboring class
which used to exact such fearful tolls
has definitely been curtailed, for the
simple reason that, the working class
cannot obtain liquor. Bootleg is re
served for those with fat purses and
slim consciences. This fact has re
sulted in enormous benefit to industry
and society. Poverty has decreased,
and an unparalleled era of prosperity
is now being enjoyed. The money
which he formerly squandered in
drink, the workman now uses to buy
homes, food, automobiles, and other
things which make life more agree
able. Mr. Fisher states:
"I am inclined to believe that Pro
hibition has saved and added much
more than the $<i t 000,000,000 that 1
have estimated as a safe minimum.
If Prohibition enforcement cost us
even $1,000,000,000 a year, it would
be well worthwhile purely as an eco
nomic investment."
President Hoover says in explain
ing modern prosperity:

"In addition to elimination of waste,
we have the benefits of notable ad
vances in (Science, improvement in
methods of management, and Prohi- !
bition." But all of this is as nothing
compared to the fact that Prohibition
is freeing the great mass of Ameri- j
I cans from a slavery to a habit-form
ing drug which is morally and physi- j
cally weakening.
Hearst Temperance Plan
But, it is said, Prohibition is not
necessary to effect these benefits; !
temperance will do it. More and more I
this cry is being heard. Its latest ex
ponent is William Randolph Hearst —
which alone ought to put it under sus
picion. And clearly, the cry of "tem
perance" is but a snare and a delu
sion. Where narcotics, including alco
hol, are involved, moral persuasion
may convince the reason, but it can
not influence a will which has been
weakened by the drug. If reason con

from bondage to drug, and opened up
a new era of physical and moral
health. Does anyone suggest that wo
repeal the Thirteenth Amendment and
reintroduce slavery, or that women
should be deprived of their rights as
citizens? How foolish, then, to undo
the work of decades by getting rid
of Prohibition and reinstating the
reign of alcohol in the United States.
Can we turn back the hands of time,
and undertake a disastrous retrogres
sion in our social progress? Hardly!
Blessings of Prohibition
There is little need to enumerate
the blessings of prohibition. They are
familiar and incontestable. First of
them, undoubtedly, is the elimination
of the saloon. If it had accomplished
only this, Prohibition would be highly
justified. The incalculable woe which
that evil instigated seems like a bad
dream now. With prohibition of the
advertising and open sale of liquor
much of the temptation for drinking
has been removed, with the result
that the number of new recruits to
alcoholism is rapidly dwindling. In
New York, wettest of cities, first of
fenders? decreased from 24 per 10,000
population for 1914 to only 6 per
10,000 population for 1925. Irving
Fisher, eminent economist at Yale,
says:
"It seems safe to conclude that the
total consumption today is certainly
less than 16 per cent of pre-prohibi
tion consumption, probably less than
10 per cent, and possibly less than
5 per cent."
In a poll conducted by the Literary
Digest 213 college heads represent
ing 44 states and nearly a third of
the total of higher colleges and uni
versities almost unanimously reported
that drinking in the colleges and
drinking by the younger generation as
a whole had decreased. "There are
actually fewer drinkers in the colleges
now than in the days when there were
only one-half the present number of
students." All of this shows that pro
hibition is breaking the chain of con
tinuity by which alcoholism has main
tained its hold for so long.
Drinking Curtailed
Drinking among the laboring class
which used to exact such fearful tolls
has definitely been curtailed, for the
simple reason that, the working class
cannot obtain liquor. Bootleg is re
served for those with fat purses and
slim consciences. This fact has re
sulted in enormous benefit to industry
and society. Poverty has decreased,
and an unparalleled era of prosperity
is now being enjoyed. The money
which he formerly squandered in
drink, the workman now uses to buy
homes, food, automobiles, and other
things which make life more agree
able. Mr. Fisher states:
"I am inclined to believe that Pro
hibition has saved and added much
more than the $<i t 000,000,000 that 1
have estimated as a safe minimum.
If Prohibition enforcement cost us
even $1,000,000,000 a year, it would
be well worthwhile purely as an eco
nomic investment."
President Hoover says in explain
ing modern prosperity:

"In addition to elimination of waste,
we have the benefits of notable ad
vances in (Science, improvement in
methods of management, and Prohi- !
bition." But all of this is as nothing
compared to the fact that Prohibition
is freeing the great mass of Ameri- j
I cans from a slavery to a habit-form
ing drug which is morally and physi- j
cally weakening.
Hearst Temperance Plan
But, it is said, Prohibition is not
necessary to effect these benefits; !
temperance will do it. More and more I
this cry is being heard. Its latest ex
ponent is William Randolph Hearst —
which alone ought to put it under sus
picion. And clearly, the cry of "tem
perance" is but a snare and a delu
sion. Where narcotics, including alco
hol, are involved, moral persuasion
may convince the reason, but it can
not influence a will which has been
weakened by the drug. If reason con
trolled will, there would be no alco
hol problem. But leaders have reached
temperance for centuries without re
sults. The ordinary man is powerless
to restrain himself when alcohol is
to be had. The only solution is to
make alcohol unobtainable. And this
is in accordance with modern physio- j
logical and biological science which
take total abstinence for their ideals.
No one is bold enough to ask for the ;
repeal of the narcotics laws with a
plea for "temperance" in the use of
narcotics. Neither should one be
fooled by an attempt to bring back
the era of alcohol under a thinly
veiled guise of "temperance."
Substitute Deceptions .... j
Just as deceptive are the other sub
stitutes for prohibition which the li- j
quor interests offer. It is obvious that
any compromise between total pro- |
hibition and unlimited alcoholism is |
bound to fail —there can be no com- j
promise between right and wrong. I
Georgia in 1908-16 tried the experi
ment of forbidding distilled liquor, but
of allowing light or near beer. It
tailed. Judge Broyles, then of the po
lice court, Atlanta, said:
"A near-beer law is practically un-!
enforceable, as you can not have a
chemist with every barrel to see that
the beer is light. Besides, men can
get drunk on 2 per cent beer if they
take enough of it."
As to the Canadian system of put
ting the government in the drug busi
ness, Elizabeth Tilton reveals its fu
tility:
"How comes it, if government sale ;
is any sort of solution, that a Mayor j
of Winnipeg where they had Prohibi
tion and now have government sale
says: 'While conditions under Prohibi
tion were bad, the present conditions i
are a thousand times worse.'
j "How comes it, if the cure for boot-)
| legging is the Quebec system, the ;
i bootlegging in Quebec is on the in
' crease and complaints of liquor law
| violations have almost trebled."
First Ten Years Hardest
I Senator Borah exposes the guile be
' hind all of these proposals thusly:
"All this disturbance and all this
j debate are not for the purpose of se-
I curing non-intoxicating liquor. The;
i people insisting upon this change are
; not insisting upon the change for the j
purpose of getting more non-intoxicat- j
ing liquor; but wines and beer such i
as will give them their intoxicating
drinks."
i
The first ten years are the hardest, j
I Prohibition at the present moment is ,
i undergoing the critical period of its |
I existence. Just as is the case with all i
J great reforms, a reaction sets in after
| the reform has been instituted; the
i faults of the existing system are mag
nified, and the evils of the former
period appear hazy in the background
Of course, no great step such as Pro- j
hibition can come into perfection !
overnight. In Prohibition, the United
States is years ahead of the rest of ;
the world, which yet regards the law
as rank fanaticism. But just as surely i
as there is change, the world will
j tollow America's lead in this as it
| has in so many other principles.
Just now, the alcoholic addicts are
! raising a tremendous hue and cry, ;
I greatly disproportionate in noise to
I the actual number of wets. Indeed,
i this great lament seems to nullify
their often repeated assertion that
Prohibition is ineffectual; that liquor j
I is as easily obtainable today as ever.
If this were so, why should any ob- !
I jection be made to the law. (The "per
! sonal liberty" objection is too moth- j
J eaten and discredited to merit discus
sion.) But this howling period will 1
pass, and America will have the credit
for another first step toward world
' betterment.
May Have Come Too Soon
In all fairness, it may be admitted 1
j thnt Constitutional Prohibition may j
have come too soon; before the great
cities of the East had been educated
; to receive it. But wouldn't it be rank j
, folly to start all over again, finally j
I returning to Prohibition after weak j
j half measures and compromises should |

have proved futile? Education should
not stop, however, and should go hand j
in hand with enforcement. President j
Hoover's new policies are including i
education, and should prove of value. |
In the meantime, there is no sub
stitute for rigid enforcement. The
various referenda and repeals of state
laws throughout various sections of
the country have no legal bearing on '
national Prohibition, and smack of j
treason to the Constitution. They are |
efforts to throw sand in the people's j
eyes.
Publicity Unwarranted
It is only to be expected that en- j
forcement so soon after the passage
of the great reform is yet a bit tur- I
bulent. However, much of the pub- j
licity given the enforcement of the j
Eighteenth Amendment is entirely un- j
warranted. Incidents which are of !
daily occurrence in the enforcement j
of other laws are picked up and ban
died about the country by sensational
journals in an effort to show that
Prohibition has introduced a reign of
terror in America. It is not the strict
ness of enforcement which is aggra- j
vating the situation; it is its laxity. !
However, there is no cause for dis- j
conragement. The Fifteenth Amend- j
ment has been in the Constitution
since the Civil War, and has never
been adequately enforced. Of course,
perfect enforcement of any law is
unthinkable—that would be "Utopia."
The experimental part of Prohibition
is its method of enforcement. This,
President Hoover is undertaking vigor
ously, and good results should ensue.
Meanwhile, there must be patience. ,
A nation cannot be reformed in a
day; but as surely as anything is sure, i
great moral advances are too precious
to be lightly discarded. Prohibition is
one of them.
