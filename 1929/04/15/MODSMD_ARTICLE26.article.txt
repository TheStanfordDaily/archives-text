Vote Dry And Drink Wet
The Undecided Majority, that is to
J &ay, those who are included in the
I third category—who vote dry and !
I drink wet, or (it may possibly be) i
j who vote wet and drink dry—are hold- ;
! ing a definite expression of their
{opinion in abeyance until the Adminis
j tration's fact-finding commission con
! ducts them through the deceptive
j mass of Anti-Saloon League Seaweed
| to the Island of Truth (all metaphori
j cal). These undecided members of j
I the majority in many cases are hypo- j
I crites who would be willing to vote j
j for the alleged best interests of, say, |
; the workers whom they employ, since j
I they would be secure in the knowl- i
I edge that they themselves would not j
j be deprived of one of the good things !
of life. Others of the group are simply j
! not. astute enough to have yet realized
| that Prohibition is not working out.
There are indeed many who still have
faith in the Noble Experiment. But j
they at least will admit the proposi-
I tion that the noble experiment is i
noble only so long as its benefits are
j worth more than the toll in crime,
! misery, and corruption which it ex- j
j acts. We believe that the findings of
j an honest and thorough commission
j of inquiry will eventually convince
I (hem that Prohibition has so far been
an ignoble experiment.
University Opinion
There surely must be many people.
' especially in a place where, as in this
University, intellectual courage and
quick perception exist, to whom the i
Volstead and Jones Laws and the j
Eighteenth Amendment appear moral
ly and theoretically wrong, as well as
hopelessly unenforceable. A politician
would not look to a university for a
j sound opinion on Prohibition, but a j
I statesman or a philosopher would, fori

There are, in general, three cate
gories into which men's opinions of
the question of Prohibition fall. The
first category is made up of those
who are in favor of Prohibition in both
theory and practice; the second of
those who are opposed to it in both
theory and practice; the third of those
who favor Prohibition either in theory
or in practice, but not in both. Now,

I in such a place as this one ought to
find an enlightened judgment of the
problem. That judgment, it seems to
me, ought to be (and I hope it will be
so expressed in Tuesday's poll) thai
federal enforcement of Prohibition is,
first, morally wrong, being an invasion
i of the field over which the state was
j originally guaranteed dominion, and,
| second, quite hopeless. Even within
! the last month what disgraceful af-
I fairs have been brought about by the
j uncivilized methods of attempted en
jforcement! A coast guard vessel, the
j Dexter, began pursuit of a Canadian
schooner, I'm Alone, outside of terri
torial waters, and sank it 225 miles
oflshore. Prohibition agents in Aurora,
Illinois, carrying a fraudulent "John
Doe" warrant, invaded a home' and
shot and killed Mrs. Lillian de Kins,
whose offence was that she tried to
telephone for protection asainst the
deputy sheriffs. Finally, it becamo
known that six months ago Congress
j man M. A. Michaelson of Illinois was
j secretly indicted for smuggling li
quor from Havana into the United
| States — Congressman Michaelson.

bition and the Jones Law; and it was
reported that Congressman William
Morgan of Ohio, also one of the roll
call teetotalers, had been caught try
ing to smuggle four bottles of liquor
into the country, but was released
upon the intercession of a revenue
officer.
The Anti-Saloon League
Both of these hypocrites are said
to be supporters of the Anti-Saloon
League. This is quite probable, as of
-5 ficials of the League have repeatedly
j said that they do not care how much
! their friends in office drink so long
jas they vote dry! In such words is
| revealed the character of the most
S powerful and tenuous lobbying group
in the country. Moral welfare —piffle!
J The organized forces of (I do not say
' the unorganized sentiment for) Pro
; hibition are interested only in the
fanatical and tyrannical ideal of im
posing temperance upon man. They
utter propaganda, not reasoned argu
ment ; they derive some of their great
hoard of money from children whose
pennies are forced from them at ses
sions of the W.C.T.U. —enlightened
patrons! Their method is not the
democratic one of persuasion of citi
zen voters, but the convenient one of
bribery of unmoral representatives.
Temperance in the moral sense —ab-
stinence from excess —never has been
nor ever will be furthered by such
policies as are espoused by the organ
ized supporters of the Experiment of
Folly and Fanaticism.

they at least will admit the proposi-

There surely must be many people.
' especially in a place where, as in this
University, intellectual courage and
quick perception exist, to whom the i
Volstead and Jones Laws and the j
Eighteenth Amendment appear moral

hopelessly unenforceable. A politician
would not look to a university for a

I statesman or a philosopher would, fori

There are, in general, three cate
gories into which men's opinions of
the question of Prohibition fall. The
first category is made up of those
who are in favor of Prohibition in both
theory and practice; the second of
those who are opposed to it in both
theory and practice; the third of those
who favor Prohibition either in theory
or in practice, but not in both. Now,
