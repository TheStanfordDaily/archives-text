# 332,323 PASSENGRS CARRIED BY CAMPUS TROLLEY LAST YEAR

### 
More than a quarter of a million
rode on Stanford's trolley line last
year. To be exact, 332,323 passengers
were carried by the vermillion-liued
"dinky" which provides the only
means of transportation between Palo
Alto and the campus.
The price this host of rail-riders
paid for its pleasure trips to and from
Palo Alto amounted to $19,939.38, six
cents at a time.
The Peninsular Railway Company
in its annual statement announced a
3ti,000-passenger decline in travel over
the Stanford-Palo Alto line during
1928. This drop in street car patron
age was attributed to the fact that
there was a general decrease in trans
portation business throughout the
state, owing to industrial conditions.
Another reason for a decline in trol
ley travel, according to the transpor
tation company, is the increase of liv
ing facilities on the campus, making
it unnecessary for students to ride
back and forth from Palo Alto.
