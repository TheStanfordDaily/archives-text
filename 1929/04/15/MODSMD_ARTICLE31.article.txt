# SPORTS OF 1929
## The 						Result of Criticism 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Remember the story of "Black |
Beauty," the horse? Here's one about !
Barbuti, the race-horse of the United j
States Olympic team, only American \
runner to come in first in an Olympic j
final, and now on the blacklist of the j
Amateur Athletic Union because he |
spoke out of turn and criticized that
august body in February.
It seems that the ex-Syracuse track
and football captain first came under
the ban of the A.A.U. when the reg
istration committee of the Metropoli
tan Association suspended him from
further competition as an amateur un
til he "proved or retracted the state
ments credited to him" in a New
York evening newspaper. On Wed
nesday night, February 27, Barbuti
and other athletes were waiting to
be called before this registration com
mittee to tell why they had failed to J
compete in indoor meets in which !
they were supposed to have been en-,
tered. Barbuti himself was cleared
of not showing up at the New York
Athletic Club games, but while wait- j
ing to be called before the committee
be let fall some choice remarks cast
ing asparagus at the Holy A.A.U. and
its officials.
He stated, according to the afore
mentioned afternoon paper, that the
A.A.U. pays the track stars "average
expenses of $200 or $300 for appear
ing." With its characteristic lack of
intelligence, the A.A.U. rushed into

j action without asking him if he had
! made the remarks credited to him,
| and put Barbuti behind the bars.
Not that Barbuti cared, for he is
j through with competition and is try
j ing to earn an honest living. So Ray
I came back at them with a neat letter,
j and again a month later in a sizzling
I 3,000-word article in the April "Sports
i manship." In order not to appear as
a tale-bearer lie refused to mention
| names. His story was most interest
j ing, however, and it seems that there
j is a fine chance for the A.A.U. to do a
j little housecleaning, as Organized
! Baseball did from within in 1920.

I Christy Mathewson, Jr., son of the
j famous pitcher, will inaugurate a
| year-round air service between the
' Adirondacks and New York soon.
