GenUemen:
About five years ago, after trying
out many different styles of pijtes
l'rom the Missouri meerschaum to the
genuine meerschaum, including the
upside-down style made popular by
' Vice-President Dawes, and experi
-1 menting with just about all the to
baccos then on the market except
' Edgeworth, I finally decided that pipe-
I smoking was not for me.
For the last year or so I noticed the
boys around the office here using
Edgeworth to the exclusion of all
other tobaccos and evidently getting
real pleasure from their pipes.
In April of this year I was in Canada
on a business trip and decided to take
i another whirl at pipe-smoking. So I
j invested a good share of my savings
; in a pipe and a few cents additional
I for a can of Edgeworth.
From then on I have been figura
tively kicking myself around the block
: about once each day when I think of
the five lean years I put in trying to
get along without a pipe. However, I
; am trying to make up for lost time
! and am succeeding quite well. Why
| I failed to try Edgeworth long ago will
| have to go down in history as an
unsolved question. But now that I
: have found it, the years ahead look
| rosy to me.
Very truly yours,
