# WILBUR TO GIVE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH IN JUNE
## Problems of Department of Interior Found Interesting By President of Stanford Head of University Reports Feeling of Homesickness For California and "Farm" 
### 
'"It if my plan to give the Commence
ment Address to the Class of 1929 and I
am quite looking forward to it." This
word was received yesterday from Pres
ident Wilbur in a letter to a Daily re
porter.
The letter follows:
"I am much interested in your letter
telling me that I am still on your "beat."
It is my plan to give the Commencement
Address to the Class of 1929 and I am
quite looking forward to it.
"You ask me for a short message to
the student body. On these hot, close
days it makes me homesick even to think
of the Stanford Campus. One is, though,
often reminded of it by some Stanford
visitor of the past and present.
"To be pushed into the midst of a new
administration is full of interest and
plenty of hard work. Here in the De
partment of the Interior we have been
very busy with oil conservation, Indians,
reclamation, education, pensions, and
enough other questions to keep away any
form of mental rust. It really is most
interesting and I suppose will be more so
after Congress meets the middle of this
month.
"1 have been watching the success of
the Stanford track team with much sat
isfaction and have taken up medicine ball
instead of walking for exercise. We had
a look the other day at a good trout
stream over in the Virginia mountains.
This was heautiful and attractive, in a
modest sort of a way. I suppose a Cali
fornian is spoiled by the redwoods and
the Sierras.
"With the very best wishes to the
whole Stanford family,
"Faithfully yours,
"RAY LYMAN WILBUR"
