# RALLY COMMITTEE TO DISTRIBUTE STICKERS
## 
### 
George Bodle and Charles Fox were
last night appointed the Rally Com
mittee representatives to handle the
welcoming and the transportation of
the alumni on University Day.
Stickers inviting the former Stan
fordites to "hop in" will be distributed
Friday and all student car-owners are
requested to stick them on their wind
shields.
At the meeting, presided over by
Dave Jaeobson, it was reported that
the figures on the Masque Ball were
not yet completed, but a preliminary
compilation showed that a small profit
had been made. This will be added to
the $381 made in the "King" contest
and will be turned over to the Theatre
Fund.
