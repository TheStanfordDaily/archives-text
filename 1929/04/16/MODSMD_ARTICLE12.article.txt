# TWO MINERS TRAPPED

### 
WALLACE, Idaho, April 15 (/P). â€”
Two miners, trapped behind a wall of
muck and rock, battered at the barrier
inside, while a crew of recue workers
tore at it from the outside, working in
shifts and calling for additional volun
teer workers.
Oscar Johnson and John Ameson, who
were penned in the workings of the Old
Frisco mine near Gem, Idaho, yesterday,
had darkness slowly closing over them as
their supply of carbide for light became
exhausted. It was understood here that
they were receiving fresh air.
