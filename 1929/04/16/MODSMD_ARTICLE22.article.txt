Some 3.32,323 passengers were carried by the Stanford-Palo Alto
inter-campus-town railway during the past year. The number of passen
gers carried by generous motorists has not been computed. They might
help to account for the 36,000-passenger decline shown by the local rail
way company during the year over the previous year. And then that "one
car to three students" may have something to do with it.
The editorial staff will meet at 1:15. It is imperative that every staff
member be present.
