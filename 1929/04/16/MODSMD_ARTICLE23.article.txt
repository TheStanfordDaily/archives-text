The Editor, Sir:
Although I know it is absolutely
futile to argue with a fanatical dry,
the long-winded, prejudiced, sometimes
stupid article by Sturgis Riddle in yes
terday's Daily incites me to either
murder or a letter to the editor. So I
choose the latter as the lesser of two
evils.
He says, "Like the small boy, man
kind doesn't seem to know what's
good for it; it repulses the very re- ■
forms which are for its highest wel- i
fare." Now I ask, who is the minority
group that can set itself up as god to j
tell the rest of mankind what is good
for it and what is not?
What the majority of mankind |
wants it shall have, regardless of the
efforts of a bunch of ardent drys to
play wet nurse.
Mr. Riddle says alcohol is a blood
brother of murder, poverty, suicide, i
slavery, lust, and wretchedness. You
forgot to list rape and rebellion in I
your list of sins, Mr. Riddle. Can you
honestly keep a straight face when j
you write such bunk and kabibble for j
university students to read? You
sound like an uneducated evangelist:
preaching hell-fire and brimstone to j
an equally uneducated audience.
You suggest that we should not re
peal the 18th Amendment simply be
cause we haven't repealed the 13tli
(regarding slavery) or the 19th (re-!
garding women voting). Now that's
sensible logic, isn't it, Mr. Riddle? j
A little later on in your thesis you
mention with praise the fact that li
quor has been taken away from the j
working classes, while those with fat
purses can still get it. This fact is
one of the most damning indictments
of the 18th Amendment and the Vol
stead Act. It makes the prohibition
law undemocratic, class legislation
that stinks of medievalism.
You give prohibition all the credit I
for the decrease in poverty and the i
present era of prosperity. As a matter |
of fact, Mr. Riddle, w<> probably would
be just as prosperous a country today
whether we had prohibition or not.
You state Canadian statistics to \
show the failure of government regu- j
lation of liquor. Are these statistics j

unbiased and official? Also, there is
a far greater amount of material re
garding government regulation in
Sweden that would sadly upset the
applecart of your sage prognostica
tions.
I have called your attention to just
a few glaring presumptions. I'll say
nothing about your hiding the issue
behind a glorious hoo-rah of spread
eagle, jingoistic patriotism.
Yes, Mr. Riddle, it is a "noble ex
periment"; but the final judgment as
to whether it is a successful experi
ment or not must be left to the people
themselves. You cannot set yourself
up as a god to dictate what is good
for our souls and what is -not. —A

purses can still get it. This fact is
one of the most damning indictments
of the 18th Amendment and the Vol
stead Act. It makes the prohibition
law undemocratic, class legislation
that stinks of medievalism.
You give prohibition all the credit I
for the decrease in poverty and the i
present era of prosperity. As a matter |
of fact, Mr. Riddle, w<> probably would
be just as prosperous a country today
whether we had prohibition or not.
You state Canadian statistics to \
show the failure of government regu- j
lation of liquor. Are these statistics j

unbiased and official? Also, there is
a far greater amount of material re
garding government regulation in
Sweden that would sadly upset the
applecart of your sage prognostica
tions.
I have called your attention to just
a few glaring presumptions. I'll say
nothing about your hiding the issue
behind a glorious hoo-rah of spread
eagle, jingoistic patriotism.
Yes, Mr. Riddle, it is a "noble ex
periment"; but the final judgment as
to whether it is a successful experi
ment or not must be left to the people
themselves. You cannot set yourself
up as a god to dictate what is good
for our souls and what is -not. —A

The Editor, Sir:
Although I know it is absolutely
futile to argue with a fanatical dry,
the long-winded, prejudiced, sometimes
stupid article by Sturgis Riddle in yes
terday's Daily incites me to either
murder or a letter to the editor. So I
choose the latter as the lesser of two
evils.
He says, "Like the small boy, man
kind doesn't seem to know what's
good for it; it repulses the very re- ■
forms which are for its highest wel- i
fare." Now I ask, who is the minority
group that can set itself up as god to j
tell the rest of mankind what is good
for it and what is not?
What the majority of mankind |
wants it shall have, regardless of the
efforts of a bunch of ardent drys to
play wet nurse.
Mr. Riddle says alcohol is a blood
brother of murder, poverty, suicide, i
slavery, lust, and wretchedness. You
forgot to list rape and rebellion in I
your list of sins, Mr. Riddle. Can you
honestly keep a straight face when j
you write such bunk and kabibble for j
university students to read? You
sound like an uneducated evangelist:
preaching hell-fire and brimstone to j
an equally uneducated audience.
You suggest that we should not re
peal the 18th Amendment simply be
cause we haven't repealed the 13tli
(regarding slavery) or the 19th (re-!
garding women voting). Now that's
sensible logic, isn't it, Mr. Riddle? j
A little later on in your thesis you
mention with praise the fact that li
quor has been taken away from the j
working classes, while those with fat
purses can still get it. This fact is
one of the most damning indictments
of the 18th Amendment and the Vol
stead Act. It makes the prohibition
law undemocratic, class legislation
