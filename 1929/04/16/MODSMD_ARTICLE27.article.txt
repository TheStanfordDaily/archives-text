# Volstead Act Repeal Would Mean Ultimate Return To Alcoholic Era
## Government Sale of Liquor, Legal Beer, and Light Wines Would Be Futile Alternatives of Prohibition 
### Sturgis Riddle 
If Prohibition is repealed, what
then? This question Mr. Peck entirely
avoided in his article denouncing the
"Anti-Saloon League," and wisely so,
for there can only be embarrassed
silence when it is broached. It is all
very well and good to point out the
evils in the existing situation, but to
suggest a remedy is an entirely dif
ferent matter. If Prohibition were re
pealed, there are only three possibili
ties which might ensue. First, the
country miglit return to the alcoholic
era which preceded the adoption of
the Eighteenth Amendment. This con
dition is unthinkable, and is not to be
considered by any intelligent citizen.
Nor do the wets themselves dare to
suggest it openly, for it would reveal
their hand and ruin them. But a re
turn to unlimited alcoholism is the
only thing which will satisfy them,
and they are working subtly to bring
it about through the tricks which we
will next consider.
Alternatives Have Failed
The second alternative for Prohibi
tion is legalization of light wines and
beer, and the third, government sale
of liquor. Both of these methods, as I
previously pointed out, are utterly fu
tile to banish alcoholism. Both of
them would be subject to the same
abuses as is prohibition now; there
is no argument against total prohibi
tion which will not apply to them â€”
test it out! Furthermore, they have
failed wherever tried. There can be
no compromise or half-measures be
tween total prohibition and no prohi
bition at all. The wets know this, and
feel that they can once again bring in
alcoholism after the trial of the com
promises, which they throw up as
subterfuges, knowing in advance they
will fail. This explains Mr. Peck's
failure to suggest a substitute for
Prohibition. There isn't any!
Mr. Peck makes much of the con
gressmen who vote dry and drink
wet, and the "fanatical and tyrannical
Anti-Saloon League." As to his first
complaint, the fact that some con
gressmen vote like hypocrites, shows
the tremendous power of public
opinion in favor of Prohibition. The
representatives are forced to vote
dry, even against their consciences
for fear of losing their seats. The only
accurate method of ascertaining the
public will is through the action of
the delegates in Congress. What be

comes of the plea that Prohibition is !
unpopular when the voting record of j
Congress is examined? Like so many
other alarums of the wets, it fails to i
stand up under scrutiny.
Cause For Complaint
As to the "Anti-Saloon League," it
is to be admitted that there may be
just reason for complaint. Once a body !
of men have tasted a little power, j
they tend to lose their heads and do
rash things. But the "Anti-Saloon
League" has worked for, and is work- !
ing for, a great moral principle. It
can expect nothing out of Prohibition i
beyond a little prestige, perhaps, and 1
has dedicated itself to the welfare of
humanity, as it sees it. Contrast this
attitude with that of the wet propa- j
ganda. Beyond a doubt, it is fostered
by interests to which Prohibition is
highly inimicable, and which are
struggling powerfully to put America
again under the yoke of alcoholism.
To them, a repeal of Prohibition would
mean many millions of dollars, and
ihey are gladly parting with a few
thousands now in order to bring the
repeal about. It is to be hoped that
the people will not fall victims to
their sly propaganda, and will con
sider well the purpose at which they
are aiming.
Enforcement Will Come
Various methods of Prohibition en- j
forcement may be regrettable, but j
slowly the government is purging ,
itself of abuses and working out more
successful campaigns. Poor enforce-1
ment, however, in no way discredits j
Prohibition. It only calls attention to I
the fact that the benefits which we ;
enjoy under the Eighteenth Amend- I
ment could be greatly augmented by
better control. This will have to work
itself out; it cannot come in a flash j
of inspiration.
In the meantime, repeal of Prohibi- j
tion, as I have explained it, could do |
no good, and would result in untold
evil. I agree with Mr. Peck that in a j
university one should find "enlight- j
ened judgment of the problem." That i
is why I am confident that balancing i
the horrors of the alcohol era with j
the benefits which Prohibition gives, j
and seeing through the petty disturb- !
ances of the period of adjustment
which we are now going through, all !
reasoning collegians can come to but j
one verdict. Prohibition, America's J
gift to Civilization, must not be dis- \
owned.
