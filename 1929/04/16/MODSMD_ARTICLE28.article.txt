Penelope's Man. By John Erskine (In
dianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1929)
Does Mr. Erskine have the habit,
now, or something? It's too bad. Gal
ahad was even more delightful than
Helen of Troy. Adam and Eve was a
little dubious —still, it had its good
spots.
But Penelope's Man is definitely a
mistake. Too much of a good thing,
perhaps. The pity of it is that if
Penelope's Man had been the first of
tHis extraordinary series instead of
the last, it might have been a tre
mendous success.
Odysseus inspired by "homing in
stinct" has some novel adventures.
His intrigues all have the celebrated
Erskine touch —raciness —humor —so-
phistication. And of course they are
risque and subtle. It wouldn't be Er
skine without these last two qualities.
The fact is, however, that Penelope's
Man leans too heavily on the risque
element, and subtlety is pretty much
neglected. The result borders on vul
garity. Erskine always did skate on
thin ice—part of his charm, no doubt
—still, when a thing ceases to be clev
er, it hasn't much excuse.
Erskine furnishes Odysseus with
four women, not counting the sirens.
(These were ciphers in Odysseus' life
because when he landed on their is
land he was pretty much hungry and
they didn't think about feeding him.
He left the same day.)
The others were not that stupid.
Odysseus got along well enough in
the land of the Lotus Eaters, except
that even less than usual happens in
the fifty pages he spends there.
The Circe business is more excit
ing. Odysseus almost indicates a little
sense, although he generally behaves
with the thick conceit and obtusity of
all of Erskine's horoes.
There are plenty of situations and
sentences to laugh at. However, if
you have read one or two of Erskine's
others, you might as well pass this
one up.

While the Bridegroom Tarried. By
Edna Bryner. (New York: E. P.
Dutton & Co. $2.50.)
A comparatively new writer, Miss
Bryner, lias been met before in the
pages of "Andy Brandt's Ark," where
"raw, profound, and inescapable emo
tion" was paraded before the eyes of
the public. In this second attempt to
portray the intimate affairs existing

in families, existing between families
and outsiders, she has succeeded in ,
making the psychological study of one
particular man, and his relations with j
women, stand out clearly.
Very little of interest occurs that j
does not directly come to you through |
the thoughts, the eyes of Alden Ben
nington. Other persons are real only
in so far as they grow and live in
his world, and real only so long as
they continue to either aid or impede
his progress.
Sharp-pointed, almost acutely pain
ful are the scenes of deep insight into
his own character; as painful for the ;
reader as for the man himself. He is j
vivisected, pulled apart, his thoughts, j
his ideals, if they were such, flung |
out for all to see. You appreciate what
he went through with—you are doub- j
ly glad that you can not meet him, j
he is real inasmuch as the reader j
feels distinctly about him, feels dis
tinctly that if he had lived he would I
not have been real.
Alden Bennington is paramount —
an interesting fellow, not wholly de
pendable, not wholly worth-while, as
we see it today, not even wholly a i
man, but I suppose to be excused in |
that he was "essentially a human ;
being." —V. B. T.

While the Bridegroom Tarried. By
Edna Bryner. (New York: E. P.
Dutton & Co. $2.50.)
A comparatively new writer, Miss
Bryner, lias been met before in the
pages of "Andy Brandt's Ark," where
"raw, profound, and inescapable emo
tion" was paraded before the eyes of
the public. In this second attempt to
portray the intimate affairs existing

in families, existing between families
and outsiders, she has succeeded in ,
making the psychological study of one
particular man, and his relations with j
women, stand out clearly.
Very little of interest occurs that j
does not directly come to you through |
the thoughts, the eyes of Alden Ben
nington. Other persons are real only
in so far as they grow and live in
his world, and real only so long as
they continue to either aid or impede
his progress.
Sharp-pointed, almost acutely pain
ful are the scenes of deep insight into
his own character; as painful for the ;
reader as for the man himself. He is j
vivisected, pulled apart, his thoughts, j
his ideals, if they were such, flung |
out for all to see. You appreciate what
he went through with—you are doub- j
ly glad that you can not meet him, j
he is real inasmuch as the reader j
feels distinctly about him, feels dis
tinctly that if he had lived he would I
not have been real.
Alden Bennington is paramount —
an interesting fellow, not wholly de
pendable, not wholly worth-while, as
we see it today, not even wholly a i
man, but I suppose to be excused in |
that he was "essentially a human ;
being." —V. B. T.
Penelope's Man. By John Erskine (In
dianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1929)
Does Mr. Erskine have the habit,
now, or something? It's too bad. Gal
ahad was even more delightful than
Helen of Troy. Adam and Eve was a
little dubious —still, it had its good
spots.
But Penelope's Man is definitely a
mistake. Too much of a good thing,
perhaps. The pity of it is that if
Penelope's Man had been the first of
tHis extraordinary series instead of
the last, it might have been a tre
mendous success.
Odysseus inspired by "homing in
stinct" has some novel adventures.
His intrigues all have the celebrated
Erskine touch —raciness —humor —so-
phistication. And of course they are
risque and subtle. It wouldn't be Er
skine without these last two qualities.
The fact is, however, that Penelope's
Man leans too heavily on the risque
element, and subtlety is pretty much
neglected. The result borders on vul
garity. Erskine always did skate on
thin ice—part of his charm, no doubt
—still, when a thing ceases to be clev
er, it hasn't much excuse.
Erskine furnishes Odysseus with
four women, not counting the sirens.
(These were ciphers in Odysseus' life
because when he landed on their is
land he was pretty much hungry and
they didn't think about feeding him.
He left the same day.)
The others were not that stupid.
Odysseus got along well enough in
the land of the Lotus Eaters, except
that even less than usual happens in
the fifty pages he spends there.
The Circe business is more excit
ing. Odysseus almost indicates a little
sense, although he generally behaves
with the thick conceit and obtusity of
all of Erskine's horoes.
There are plenty of situations and
sentences to laugh at. However, if
