# TWENTY CHILDREN NOW LIVING IN BABCOCK UNIT OF UNIVERSITY'S CONVALESCENT HOME
## 
### 
Twenty children, bright-eyed and
active, are now living in the Babcock
Unit of the Convalescent Home. The
"runabouts," as they are called, live
a well-regulated life in which school
and play are mingled with health
rules.
Stanford's contributions to her own
charity benefit these children directly
by aiding in the maintenance and
operation of the home. The A.S.S.U.
drive will begin this year on April 29. J
Stanford Steinbeck and Mary Bar- !
stow are in charge of the student
drive.
With the completion of the Babcock
Unit and its dedication last Novem
ber, the runabout children were moved
from the old Stanford residence,
v, liich is now used for play-rooms and
for school, to the new building. There
are now two units identical in archi
tecture and facilities: the McLaughlin
and the Babcock units. It is the hope
ot those running the Home that some
day the four units, the two named
and the new unit which is now under j
the process of construction and the
old Stanford home, will be filled to
overflowing.
During the year 1928, 155 children j
were cared for in the Home, 73 girls ]
and 82 boys. These children came j
from nineteen different institutions in
California. The average age of each
child is seven and a half years. Last
year there were twenty-two under
five, and seven under four years.
There are forty-five children con
tinually in the Home. The bed-patients
live in the McLaughlin unit and
when they become strong enough to
walk and run about, they are sent to
the Babcock Unit.
In the "runabout home," as the chil
dren call it, there is a regular sched
ule which includes work and play for
the convalescents. School fills the

morning: from 8 to 9:30 in the large
living room where the Stanfords used
to receive company. In the afternoons,
following maps from 12:30 to 2:20,
and a small meal of graham cakes,
milk, and ice-cream cones, classes
again convene. In their bright blue
and red coveralls, the children scam
per into the classroom to do their
reading, writing, and arithmetic from
2:30 until 3:50.
Sun-baths are a regular part of the
daily schedule, and the hour that
brings most pleasure to the conva
lescent children is playtime, which
comes from 3:50 to 5 o'clock in the
afternoon. Games and amusements
for the runabouts are often furnished
by Stanford students during these
hours.

Twenty children, bright-eyed and
active, are now living in the Babcock
Unit of the Convalescent Home. The
"runabouts," as they are called, live
a well-regulated life in which school
and play are mingled with health
rules.
Stanford's contributions to her own
charity benefit these children directly
by aiding in the maintenance and
operation of the home. The A.S.S.U.
drive will begin this year on April 29. J
Stanford Steinbeck and Mary Bar- !
stow are in charge of the student
drive.
With the completion of the Babcock
Unit and its dedication last Novem
ber, the runabout children were moved
from the old Stanford residence,
v, liich is now used for play-rooms and
for school, to the new building. There
are now two units identical in archi
tecture and facilities: the McLaughlin
and the Babcock units. It is the hope
ot those running the Home that some
day the four units, the two named
and the new unit which is now under j
the process of construction and the
old Stanford home, will be filled to
overflowing.
During the year 1928, 155 children j
were cared for in the Home, 73 girls ]
and 82 boys. These children came j
from nineteen different institutions in
California. The average age of each
child is seven and a half years. Last
year there were twenty-two under
five, and seven under four years.
There are forty-five children con
tinually in the Home. The bed-patients
live in the McLaughlin unit and
when they become strong enough to
walk and run about, they are sent to
the Babcock Unit.
In the "runabout home," as the chil
dren call it, there is a regular sched
ule which includes work and play for
the convalescents. School fills the

morning: from 8 to 9:30 in the large
living room where the Stanfords used
to receive company. In the afternoons,
following maps from 12:30 to 2:20,
and a small meal of graham cakes,
milk, and ice-cream cones, classes
again convene. In their bright blue
and red coveralls, the children scam
per into the classroom to do their
reading, writing, and arithmetic from
2:30 until 3:50.
Sun-baths are a regular part of the
daily schedule, and the hour that
brings most pleasure to the conva
lescent children is playtime, which
comes from 3:50 to 5 o'clock in the
afternoon. Games and amusements
for the runabouts are often furnished
by Stanford students during these
hours.
