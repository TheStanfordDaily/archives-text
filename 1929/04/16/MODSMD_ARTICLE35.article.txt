# STANFORD MEN GIVEN BOOST BY TERMAN IN TALK AT CONFERENCE
## Dr. Eels Elected President of Education Research Body; 250 in Attendance 
### 
Campus men had some high hopes
dashed last night when the Daily
called up Dr. Lewis M. Terman to get
corroboration of a statement ascribed
to him by a local newspaper. The
statement that caused all the furore
was to the effect that Dr. Terman
had said that Stanford men were
more intelligent than Stanford women,
thereby upsetting certain Stanford
traditions of feminine superiority on
the campus.
"I did not mean to convey that im
pression," said Dr. Terman, when
called up last night. "What I did say
was that more of the Stanford men
than women made high scores in the
Thorndike test. I haven't the figures
here, so I suggest that you call up
Dr. Karl Cowdery who knows all about
the Stanford results of the test."
When Dr. Cowdery was called, he
said that while more Stanford men
than women made high scores in the
test, there were more of them to make
those high scores —about 2500 more.
Also, Dr. Cowdery said that while the
men made higher scores than the
women, they also made lower ones.
He believed that the relative numbers
of high scores among the men and
the women would be approximately
equal, with the average score for the
men slightly higher than the average
for the women.
Dr. Terman made the talk that
caused the excitement during the
eighth annual conference of the Cali
fornia Educational Research Associa
tion, held on the campus last Friday
and Saturday. Problems and accom
plishments of education and the re
sults of experiment and research were
discussed at the meeting.
Dr. Edward K. Strong of the Gradu
ate School of Business spoke Friday
evening at the Union on the results
of the interest tests that he has been
conducting among people of eighteen
professions. Saturday morning at the
Little Theatre Dr. Terman addressed
a general assembly of the conference
on the results of his studies of gifted
children. Dr. Terman has studied a
group of 600 children for seven years,
and his results in the studies seem to
prove the value of intelligence tests.
Approximately 250 educators from
the faculties of many schools and col
leges attended the conference. At a
business session held Saturday morn
ing, the following officers were
elected:
President, Dr. Walter C. Eels, of
Stanford; first vice-president, Ivan
Waterman, of the Bureau of Service
and Research for the San Francisco
public schools; second vice-president,
Dr. Norman Fenton, of the Whittier
State School for Boys; secretary, Miss
Pauline Davis, of San Jose. The execu
tive committee of the organization is
to name the place for next year's con
ference.

Campus men had some high hopes
dashed last night when the Daily
called up Dr. Lewis M. Terman to get
corroboration of a statement ascribed
to him by a local newspaper. The
statement that caused all the furore
was to the effect that Dr. Terman
had said that Stanford men were
more intelligent than Stanford women,
thereby upsetting certain Stanford
traditions of feminine superiority on
the campus.
"I did not mean to convey that im
pression," said Dr. Terman, when
called up last night. "What I did say
was that more of the Stanford men
than women made high scores in the
Thorndike test. I haven't the figures
here, so I suggest that you call up
Dr. Karl Cowdery who knows all about
the Stanford results of the test."
When Dr. Cowdery was called, he
said that while more Stanford men
than women made high scores in the
test, there were more of them to make
those high scores —about 2500 more.
Also, Dr. Cowdery said that while the
men made higher scores than the
women, they also made lower ones.
He believed that the relative numbers
of high scores among the men and
the women would be approximately
equal, with the average score for the
men slightly higher than the average
for the women.
Dr. Terman made the talk that
caused the excitement during the
eighth annual conference of the Cali
fornia Educational Research Associa
tion, held on the campus last Friday
and Saturday. Problems and accom
plishments of education and the re
sults of experiment and research were
discussed at the meeting.
Dr. Edward K. Strong of the Gradu
ate School of Business spoke Friday
evening at the Union on the results
of the interest tests that he has been
conducting among people of eighteen
professions. Saturday morning at the
Little Theatre Dr. Terman addressed
a general assembly of the conference
on the results of his studies of gifted
children. Dr. Terman has studied a
group of 600 children for seven years,
and his results in the studies seem to
prove the value of intelligence tests.
Approximately 250 educators from
the faculties of many schools and col
leges attended the conference. At a
business session held Saturday morn
ing, the following officers were
elected:
President, Dr. Walter C. Eels, of
Stanford; first vice-president, Ivan
Waterman, of the Bureau of Service
and Research for the San Francisco
public schools; second vice-president,
Dr. Norman Fenton, of the Whittier
State School for Boys; secretary, Miss
Pauline Davis, of San Jose. The execu
