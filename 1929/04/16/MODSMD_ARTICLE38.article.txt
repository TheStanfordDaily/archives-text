I Professor Carl F. Brand of the His
! Tory Department is organizing a Stan
ford party for a tour of western Eu
rope, to be carried on under the busi

! as a member of the group said, "some
i thing famous."

New York on Consulich M.V. "Satur
! nia." The entire intermediate class
! has been reserved for the American
! Express tours, most of which are from
universities and colleges throughout

i made special provision for music, a
i college orchestra having been en
j gaged, and for deck sports.
j Sailing directly for the Mediterra
i nean region, the vessel will stop by
special concession at Algiers. French
occupation has left the appearance of
this city practically unchanged and
it still retains the marks of an old
pirate stronghold.
Naples will be the first European
: port and from there the itinerary in
cludes many capitals, Rome, Vienna,
Paris, and London, and also Venice,
Lucerne, Bruges, and other equally
I interesting smaller cities.

i colleges, will afford places of unique
interest to American college men."
Return will be made from Liverpool
on the new Canadian Pacific liner,
i "Duchess of York." A picturesque trip
•up the St. Lawrence and a glimpse
j of French Canada will complete the
| trip about August 31.
