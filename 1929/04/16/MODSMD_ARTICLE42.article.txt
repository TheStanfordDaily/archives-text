## Golf's Stormy Petrel 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
The United States Ryder Cup team,
which will invade England in April, is
composed of Captain Walter Hagen,
Leo Diegel, Ed Dudley, A1 Espinosa,
Johnny Farrell, Johnny Golden, Gene
Sarazen, Horton Smith, Joe Turnesa,
and A1 Watrous. A fine bunch of
golfers, we'll all agree. Probably bet
ter by far than the ten pros that Eng
land will muster to oppose them. The
list includes former champions of
England and America, as well as the
present U.S. open title-holder. But
something is lacking. Somebody is
absent who should be in there. The
American team could be much strong
er â€”should be, in fact.
Why isn't Bill Mehlhorn on the U.S.
Ryder Cup team? No one has been
playing any better golf than "Wild
Bill." Not more than two or three of

the ten men selected could beat Loud
i William at the present time. Why was
he left off? What deep, dark, mysteri
ous reason caused Walter Hagen, cap-
I Fcnimore Country Club pro? Did Sir
tain of the team, to overlook the
Walter get a wireless saying "Please
Omit Wild Flowers Bill Mehlhorn?"
Either Mehlhorn is eligible to com
pete o nthe U.S. Ryder Cup team, or
he is not eligible to compete as a
member of the Professional Golfers'
; Association of America. He is a player
' of championship caliber, as his three
straight southern victories in the
Texas open, El Paso open, and South
i Central open will attest. The blond,
bow-legged buccaneer of the links
i may be America's Bad Boy of Golf,
but who else ever shot 271 for 72
; holes on a 6f>oo-yard course?
