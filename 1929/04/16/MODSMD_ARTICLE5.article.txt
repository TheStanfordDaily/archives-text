# CONSIDER THIS QUESTION, PROHIBITION
## 
### 
Simultaneously with the special A.S.S.U. election which will be
held today, a questionnaire will be conducted by the Daily on the
problem of Prohibition. The purpose of the questionnaire is to
arouse student thought on the matter and to obtain a survey of
opinion.
Prohibition is in its tenth year. The recent passage of the Jones
Law, the proposal of President Hoover to "appoint a national
commission for a searching investigation of the whole structure
of our Federal jurisprudence to include the method of enforce
ment of the Eighteenth Amendment and the causes of abuse under
it," the attack upon the Canadian schooner, I'm Alone, by the Coast
Guard, the shooting of a woman by State officers in Aurora, Illi
nois, these and the daily occurrences that involve Prohibition have
stirred up wide-spread discussion and public interest in the whole
matter of Prohibition. The Daily believes that such discussion
should be carried to the extent of investigating and airing every
phase of the problem. It believes that whatever student thought it
can evoke by its questionnaire will merit conducting the question
naire.
In the interest of a fair, serious investigation of campus opinion
on a problem of nation-wide importance, the Daily sincerely hopes
that a substantial majority of the student body will participate in
the survey and thus give a representative consensus.
The questionnaire will contain four questions: Do you believe
Prohibition can be enforced? Do you believe that Prohibition as it
has existed to date has been successful? Should the Eighteenth
Amendment be repealed? Should the Volstead Act be repealed?
