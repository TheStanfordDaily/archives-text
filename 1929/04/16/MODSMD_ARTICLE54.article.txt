# HOOVER WAR LIBRARY PRESENTED VALUABLE HISTORICAL MATERIAL
## Santa Barbara Rector Gives War Notes, Mementoes Collected in Paris 
### 
Historical material bearing on the
World War that cannot be duplicated
anywhere else is contained in a gift
of the Rev. Samuel N. Watson, D.D.,
of Santa Barbara to the Hoover War
Library of Stanford University. Dr.
Watson was rector of the American
Church in Paris from 1912 to 1918, and
during the whole period of the war
was in intimate touch with American,
French, and Belgian leaders.
The most valuable portion of the
Samuel N. Watson and Jeanette G.
Watson Collection, as it has been
named by the Hoover War Library
directors, is contained in twelve folio
volumes of manuscript letters, memo
randa, and notes received by Dr. Wat
son during this period. According to
Professor Ralph H. Lutz, chairman
of the Hoover Library board, these
manuscripts contain personal expres
sions of prominent personages in war
activities that are of absolutely unique
value to scholars through sidelights
they throw on contemporary events.
Private Volume
Supplementing these folio volumes
are a number of other mementoes of
great interest and value. One of these
is a privately printed volume by Mrs.
Watson, "Our Sentry Go," containing
much sidelight material on the war
period in general and on some of the
manuscripts in the folios. There are
also a number of selected war books
including a few rare pamphlets.
A beautiful and elaborate lace
cloth made in Herzele, Flanders, and
taken across the border during the
war as a gift to Mrs. Watson in grati
tude for American relief to the village,
is also included.
Water Color Reproduced
The first lithograph copy of a water
color by the Belgian artist, Maurice
Romberg, which was famous in
France, is a part of the gift. This
painting represents King Alfred with
a rifle in the trenches and is endorsed
by the artist with a note that King
Alfred had said, "And if it is neces
sary 1 will take a gun myself," and
the additional note, "and he did it."
The original of this painting is in
Paris. Photographs of it were sold in
France to raise money for the Bel
gians. Romberg himself executed sev
eral reproductions with such care that
they closely resemble originals, and
the first of these he presented to the
Watsons. The second went to King
Alfred, and the third to the king's
sister.
One of the extremely few complete
files of the Paris edition of the New
York Herald for the entire war period
is a part of the Watson Collection. It
is thought that there are not more j
than three such files in existence, i

Samuel N. Watson and Jeanette G.
Watson Collection, as it has been
named by the Hoover War Library
directors, is contained in twelve folio
volumes of manuscript letters, memo
randa, and notes received by Dr. Wat
son during this period. According to

value to scholars through sidelights
they throw on contemporary events.

are a number of other mementoes of
great interest and value. One of these
is a privately printed volume by Mrs.
Watson, "Our Sentry Go," containing
much sidelight material on the war

manuscripts in the folios. There are
also a number of selected war books
including a few rare pamphlets.

by the artist with a note that King
Alfred had said, "And if it is neces
sary 1 will take a gun myself," and
the additional note, "and he did it."
The original of this painting is in
Paris. Photographs of it were sold in

eral reproductions with such care that
they closely resemble originals, and

Alfred, and the third to the king's
sister.

files of the Paris edition of the New
