# MARGIN OF HUNDRED POINTS OVER BEARS UNLIKELY FOR CARDS
## California Tracksters Show Unexpected Power in Washington Meet 
### Frank Whiteley 
Coach Walt Christie's California
tracksters were beaten by a 20-point mar
gin last Saturday, but the power they
showed in a number of events was such
that Stanford hopes of piling up more
than one hundred points in the Big Meet
next Saturday will probably not be real
ized.
A two-miler that is the class of the
Coast, the second fastest miler in the
West, a good javelin thrower, two fair
high jumpers, a 9 4-5 second sprinter, and
a hurdler just getting back into form—
these are the Bears Christie is counting
on to check, to some extent at least, the
great Cardinal point-scoring machine.
U.C. Two-Miler Good
Spud Mossman, red-headed California
sophomore, in his fourth competitive two
mile last week turned in a 9:34 3-5 per
formance and promises to do even better
before the season is over. Harry Carter,
the long-legged Berkeley miler who took
first against Stanford last year, ran fast
er than he had ever run before to take
a second to Kiser of Washington in a
4 :21 mile. Carter will be favored to win
the four-lap event from Alex McKinnon
and Johnny Parker next Saturday.
Curtice, California javelin man, indi
cated by his toss of more than 201 feet
that he will give Kibby of Stanford plen
ty of competition for first place. Another
California javelin thrower, Churchill, can
do 180 feet and may be good for a ponit.
Century Close
Bisbee, whom Christie has been talking
up all season, looked like a real sprinter
against the Seattle team when he won
the century in 9 4-5. He will have to do
at least that, and probably even better, to
win from Hec Dyer.
Pogolotti, the Bear hope in the hurdles,
has been unable to compete until recently
because of injuries and is not yet in con
dition. Christie has hopes of his snag
ging two second places; but the Stanford
combination of Nichols, Edmonds, and
Smith will be hard to break into.
Jacklevitch of the Bears had little
trouble in getting over six feet in the
high jump in the Saturday meet and, ac
cordingly, seems assured of a first place
against the Stanford entries. Bingaman,
another Bear, placed second against
Washington with a jump of 5 ft. 11 in.,
a height higher than the Stanford men
have done in competition so far this
year.

trouble in getting over six feet in the
high jump in the Saturday meet and, ac
cordingly, seems assured of a first place
against the Stanford entries. Bingaman,
another Bear, placed second against
Washington with a jump of 5 ft. 11 in.,
a height higher than the Stanford men
have done in competition so far this
year.
Coach Walt Christie's California
tracksters were beaten by a 20-point mar
gin last Saturday, but the power they
showed in a number of events was such
that Stanford hopes of piling up more
than one hundred points in the Big Meet
next Saturday will probably not be real
ized.
A two-miler that is the class of the
Coast, the second fastest miler in the
West, a good javelin thrower, two fair
high jumpers, a 9 4-5 second sprinter, and
a hurdler just getting back into form—
these are the Bears Christie is counting
on to check, to some extent at least, the
great Cardinal point-scoring machine.
U.C. Two-Miler Good
Spud Mossman, red-headed California
sophomore, in his fourth competitive two
mile last week turned in a 9:34 3-5 per
formance and promises to do even better
before the season is over. Harry Carter,
the long-legged Berkeley miler who took
first against Stanford last year, ran fast
er than he had ever run before to take
a second to Kiser of Washington in a
4 :21 mile. Carter will be favored to win
the four-lap event from Alex McKinnon
and Johnny Parker next Saturday.
Curtice, California javelin man, indi
cated by his toss of more than 201 feet
that he will give Kibby of Stanford plen
ty of competition for first place. Another
California javelin thrower, Churchill, can
do 180 feet and may be good for a ponit.
Century Close
Bisbee, whom Christie has been talking
up all season, looked like a real sprinter
against the Seattle team when he won
the century in 9 4-5. He will have to do
at least that, and probably even better, to
win from Hec Dyer.
Pogolotti, the Bear hope in the hurdles,
has been unable to compete until recently
because of injuries and is not yet in con
dition. Christie has hopes of his snag
ging two second places; but the Stanford
combination of Nichols, Edmonds, and
Smith will be hard to break into.
Jacklevitch of the Bears had little
trouble in getting over six feet in the
high jump in the Saturday meet and, ac
cordingly, seems assured of a first place
against the Stanford entries. Bingaman,
another Bear, placed second against
