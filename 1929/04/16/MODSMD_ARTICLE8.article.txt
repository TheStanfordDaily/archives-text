Three teams won their second
straight games in the Intramural base
ball tournament yesterday afternoon
on the mural ball diamonds. Two of
the contests, featured by heavy hit
ting and ragged playing, were closely j
contested, while the other two games ;
were taken by forfeits.
Coming from behind with a well- j
timed rally in the last two innings, El j
Campo beat out Alpha Tau Omega in |
an eight-frame contest, when Sauliere
got to first base on an error and i
scored on a wild heave past the first
baseman. The club team tied up the
count in the seventh inning by scor- I
ing one run on an error, and bingles
by Holt and Hardison. The A.T.O.'s
lost a chance to capture the game in
the last half of the eighth, but with
two men on base Carter struck out
the third man up to retire the side.
Although Carter was wild at times,
he pitched a heady game of ball and
fanned out fourteen of the fraternity
batters. He was nicked for only two
scattered singles, and would have j
blanked his opponents but for poor |
fielding by his teammates. Wood, 1
chucking for Alpha Tau Omega, al-!
lowed ten hits but was effective in
the pinches.
Dick Holt, besides leading the bat
ters with three for three, got the long
est hit of the game, a two-bagger that
went over the center fielder's head.
A long home run by Whitney Wright
in the sixth frame broke up a slugging
match between Theta Chi and the
A.K.L.'s. Wright also pitched for
Theta Chi, substituting for Harris
after a four-run rally by the losers,
and was credited with the victory.
Both outfits played a loose fielding
game, with a half-dozen errors each.

Three teams won their second
straight games in the Intramural base
ball tournament yesterday afternoon
on the mural ball diamonds. Two of
the contests, featured by heavy hit
ting and ragged playing, were closely j
contested, while the other two games ;
were taken by forfeits.
Coming from behind with a well- j
timed rally in the last two innings, El j
Campo beat out Alpha Tau Omega in |
an eight-frame contest, when Sauliere
got to first base on an error and i
scored on a wild heave past the first
baseman. The club team tied up the
count in the seventh inning by scor- I
ing one run on an error, and bingles
by Holt and Hardison. The A.T.O.'s
lost a chance to capture the game in
the last half of the eighth, but with
two men on base Carter struck out
the third man up to retire the side.
Although Carter was wild at times,
he pitched a heady game of ball and
fanned out fourteen of the fraternity
batters. He was nicked for only two
scattered singles, and would have j
blanked his opponents but for poor |
fielding by his teammates. Wood, 1
chucking for Alpha Tau Omega, al-!
lowed ten hits but was effective in
the pinches.
