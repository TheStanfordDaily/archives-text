# FARM MEASURE PLACED BEFORE SPECIAL SESSION
## Longworth, Elected to Third Term as House Speaker, Pleads for Early Bill Passage 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 15 (JP).
—The Seventy-first Congress assembled
today and quickly but ceremoniously or
ganized for the extraordinary session
called by President Hoover to consider a
limited program of farm relief and tariff
revision.
Elected to his third term as speaker
of the House, Nicholas Longworth of
Ohio sounded the keynote of the Repub
lican majority with a plea for enactment
within a month of the farm relief, tariff,
and reapportionment bills. That legisla
tion is enough at this time, he said.
The Senate sanctions no restriction on
debate and the ever-present prohibition
problem, immigration, and the financial
dispute between the Federal Reserve
Board and Wall Street are among the
subjects listed for discussion, if not for
investigation looking to new legislation,
in that chamber.
The heavy Republican majorities in
each branch hardly were installed today
before the administration machinery
which has been grinding away here for
a month had put the new $500,000,000
farm relief measure before the House.
Before the end of the week, both the
Senate and House expect to be at work
on this controversial agricultural prob
lem which balked solution in the Coo
lidge administration and still is loaded
with trouble.
There is a tentative plan in the minds
of administration leaders for a month re
cess after the House passes the tariff
measure, as the Senate must wait for its
finance committee to go over the meas
ure.
Today was the first time the House
elected last November had assembled, and
402 of the 439 members were present. As
in the Senate, the Democratic strength
had shrunk considerably from last ses
sion with a corresponding increase in the
Republican lineup.
The Senate previously had assembled
and received its new members on the day
after inauguration, but another new one,
Henry Allen of Kansas, came forward
today to take the seat vacated by his old
political rival, Charles Curtis, the new
Vice-President.

problem, immigration, and the financial
dispute between the Federal Reserve
Board and Wall Street are among the
subjects listed for discussion, if not for
investigation looking to new legislation,
in that chamber.
The heavy Republican majorities in
each branch hardly were installed today
before the administration machinery
which has been grinding away here for
a month had put the new $500,000,000
farm relief measure before the House.
Before the end of the week, both the
Senate and House expect to be at work
on this controversial agricultural prob
lem which balked solution in the Coo
lidge administration and still is loaded
with trouble.
There is a tentative plan in the minds
of administration leaders for a month re
cess after the House passes the tariff
measure, as the Senate must wait for its
finance committee to go over the meas
ure.
Today was the first time the House
elected last November had assembled, and
402 of the 439 members were present. As
in the Senate, the Democratic strength
had shrunk considerably from last ses
sion with a corresponding increase in the
Republican lineup.
The Senate previously had assembled
and received its new members on the day
after inauguration, but another new one,
Henry Allen of Kansas, came forward
today to take the seat vacated by his old
political rival, Charles Curtis, the new
Vice-President.
