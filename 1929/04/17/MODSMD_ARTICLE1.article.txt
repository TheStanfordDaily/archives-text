# HOOVER ADVISES REORGANIZATION OF TARIFF BODY
## Chief Executive Recommends Tariff Commission Changes To Alter Rates of Duties Suggestions on Farm Relief Are Praised by Republican Leaders in House, Senate 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C.. April 16 VP).
â€”President Hoover's first message, set
ting forth what he believes the special
J 'farm relief" session should accomplish,
was the principal business before the
Seventy-first Congress today after its
brief but colorful ceremony of conven
ing yesterday.
The President surprised Congress
somewhat with a sweeping recommenda
tion for a reorganization of the tariff
commission and the formulation of a new
Stasis for its operations so that adminis
trative changes in rates of duty may be
made in months instead of years, as has
been the case since the flexible provision
became effective in 1922.
The chief executive's recommendations
on farm relief in his fifteen hundred
word message drew praise from Repub
lican leaders in the House and Senate,
were assailed as nebulous by the Demo
cratic leaders, and proved disappointing
to some of the Senate group of inde
pendent Republicans.
Senator Brookhart, of lowa, who made
many speeches for Mr. Hoover in the
farm belt last fall, said the President's
position now was inconsistent with that
after the World War when as food ad
ministrator he bought and sold grain
through the Grain Corporation, a govern
ment organization.
Senator Norbeck, of South Dakota,
-said, "Mr. Hoover shows as much sym
pathy for the farmer as did President
Coolidge and states his position fully as
well."
Having reached the Senate chamber
too late to hear all of the message read,
Senator Borah, of Idaho, withheld com
ment. He was one of the foremost op
ponents of the equalization fee system of
farm relief, campaigned through the
West for Hoover, and had a strong voice
in the calling of the extra session.
Representative Tilson, of Connecticut,
and Senator Watson, of Indiana, major
ity leaders in the House and Senate,
found the recommendations of the Presi
dent to their liking.
