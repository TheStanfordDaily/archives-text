## 
### 
The Meiji University nine, of Japan,
meets Stanford's varsity baseball team
here tomorrow at 3:15 in the last non
conference game of the season. The
Japanese team is making its semi
annual tour of California, having con
tests with many of the local college
nines and semi-pro teams throughout
the state.
The Oriental team demonstrated its
ability by scoring wins in both ends
of a double-header at Fresno Monday.
In the first game the Japanese nine
defeated the Fresno Athletic Club 7
to 3, and in the second Meiji scored a
10 to 3 victory over the Fresno Sciots.
Apparently this eastern squad is a
hard-hitting outfit as in all their games
played to date in this country, they
have socked the agate for many safe
blows. With some good pitching Meiji
should make things interesting for
the Cards.
