# SUCCESS OF CARDINAL SPRINTERS MAY BRING BIG MEET HIGH SCORE
## Card-Bear Record in Field Events Doped to Fall In Annual Meet 
### Frank Whiteley 
Dink Templeton, the world's great
est coach of weightmen, again will
send a formidable array of shot put
ters and discus throwers against Cali
fornia in the annual Big Meet here
next Saturday. For the last few years
it has been rather a hopeless task for
Coach Walt Christie's men to try to
score points in these two events with
"Tiny" Hartranft, "Biff" Hoffman, and
now Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert
representing the Cardinal.
Rothert, world's indoor champion;
Krenz, 1.C.4-A. champion; and Al For
ster, who placed fifth in the 1.C.4-A.
meet last year, will be the three Card
shot putters Saturday; and these
three should be .able to shut out the
California entries. Brown of the Bears
heaved the brass ball 44 ft. 4V4 inches
against Washington last week; and if
Forster is off form this might be good
for a point.
Krenz, Rothert, and McLeod will do
the discus throwing for Stanford, but
a Card clean sweep is less likely in
this event than in the shot. Krenz,
who recently broke the world's rec
ord with a toss of more than 163 feet,
is certain of first. However, Rothert
and McLeod will not have such an
easy time of it with Brown throwing
around 139 ft., which is as far as the
two Stanford men have been doing
in competition.
The javelin will be the most hotly
contested of all the six field events. '
Captain Curtice of the Bears got out j
i a long throw of 201 ft. 1% in. against
| Washington last week while Kibby ! ,
| was winning the same event in the |
j Stanford Stadium with a mark of 195
ft. Vi in. Kibby did 201 ft. 11 in. the j
week before against U.S.C. Sparling'
of Stanford is capable of 200 feet or j
better, and this should develop into (
j a great three-cornered tight for first, i
! Churchill of the Bears and Perelii- ;
i Minetti, Card sophomore, have both
! done 190 ft. and may break into the |
I scoring column.
The high jump appears to be Cali- j
| fornia's event with the pole vault and j
broad jump being pretty much ali '
Stanford. Jacklevitch and Bingaman I
placed one-two in the California- ■
Washington meet at heights of G ft. I
and 5 ft. 11 in. Templeton's three j
hopefuls, Austin, Madison, and Woody
att, could only get over the bar at j
5 ft. 9 in. against the All-Stars. Dick i
French has done 6 ft. and may be j
able to grab a second, and possibly >
a first.
Christie's best pole vaulter can
clear 12 ft., but this will not be good
enough for even a third place if'
1 Berry and Hulsman of Stanford are |
1 in form. Edmonds is of course con-'
! ceded first.
It will be up to Dowell, Zombro, and |
Anderson or West in the broad jump
i to keep the Bears from scoring more
than three points here. Dowell, be j
j cause of his consistently good per- j
! formances this year, is favored for j
1
' first, with Benny Lom of California j
i and the other Stanford men fighting J
| it out for the remaining points. Dias, I
; Bear jumper, who leaped 22 ft. 9 in. j
| against Washington, is another possi-!
bility for a place.
Anything is likely to happen in the j
field events, but the Big Meet results
for these six events ought to run i
fairly close to the following: .
Shot put—Rothert (S), first; Krenz
j (S), second; Forster )S), third. Stan-!

Discus —Krenz (S), first; McLeod j
I (S), second; Rothert (S), third. Stan- 1

: third. Stanford 9, California 0.
I Broad jump—Dowell (S), first;

placed one-two in the California- ■

and 5 ft. 11 in. Templeton's three j
hopefuls, Austin, Madison, and Woody
att, could only get over the bar at j
5 ft. 9 in. against the All-Stars. Dick i
French has done 6 ft. and may be j
able to grab a second, and possibly >
a first.
Christie's best pole vaulter can
clear 12 ft., but this will not be good
enough for even a third place if'
1 Berry and Hulsman of Stanford are |
1 in form. Edmonds is of course con-'
! ceded first.
It will be up to Dowell, Zombro, and |
Anderson or West in the broad jump
i to keep the Bears from scoring more
than three points here. Dowell, be j
j cause of his consistently good per- j
! formances this year, is favored for j
1
' first, with Benny Lom of California j
i and the other Stanford men fighting J

; Bear jumper, who leaped 22 ft. 9 in. j

bility for a place.
Anything is likely to happen in the j

Dink Templeton, the world's great
est coach of weightmen, again will
send a formidable array of shot put
ters and discus throwers against Cali
fornia in the annual Big Meet here
next Saturday. For the last few years
it has been rather a hopeless task for
Coach Walt Christie's men to try to
score points in these two events with
"Tiny" Hartranft, "Biff" Hoffman, and
now Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert
representing the Cardinal.
Rothert, world's indoor champion;
Krenz, 1.C.4-A. champion; and Al For
ster, who placed fifth in the 1.C.4-A.
meet last year, will be the three Card
shot putters Saturday; and these
three should be .able to shut out the
California entries. Brown of the Bears
heaved the brass ball 44 ft. 4V4 inches
against Washington last week; and if
Forster is off form this might be good
for a point.
Krenz, Rothert, and McLeod will do
the discus throwing for Stanford, but
a Card clean sweep is less likely in
this event than in the shot. Krenz,
who recently broke the world's rec
ord with a toss of more than 163 feet,
is certain of first. However, Rothert
and McLeod will not have such an
easy time of it with Brown throwing
around 139 ft., which is as far as the
two Stanford men have been doing
in competition.
The javelin will be the most hotly
contested of all the six field events. '
Captain Curtice of the Bears got out j
i a long throw of 201 ft. 1% in. against
| Washington last week while Kibby ! ,

Dink Templeton, the world's great
est coach of weightmen, again will
send a formidable array of shot put
ters and discus throwers against Cali
fornia in the annual Big Meet here
next Saturday. For the last few years
it has been rather a hopeless task for
Coach Walt Christie's men to try to
score points in these two events with
"Tiny" Hartranft, "Biff" Hoffman, and
now Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert
representing the Cardinal.
Rothert, world's indoor champion;
Krenz, 1.C.4-A. champion; and Al For
ster, who placed fifth in the 1.C.4-A.
meet last year, will be the three Card
shot putters Saturday; and these
three should be .able to shut out the
California entries. Brown of the Bears
heaved the brass ball 44 ft. 4V4 inches
against Washington last week; and if
Forster is off form this might be good
for a point.
Krenz, Rothert, and McLeod will do
the discus throwing for Stanford, but
a Card clean sweep is less likely in
this event than in the shot. Krenz,
who recently broke the world's rec
ord with a toss of more than 163 feet,
is certain of first. However, Rothert
and McLeod will not have such an
easy time of it with Brown throwing
around 139 ft., which is as far as the
two Stanford men have been doing
in competition.
The javelin will be the most hotly
contested of all the six field events. '
Captain Curtice of the Bears got out j
i a long throw of 201 ft. 1% in. against
| Washington last week while Kibby ! ,
| was winning the same event in the |
j Stanford Stadium with a mark of 195
ft. Vi in. Kibby did 201 ft. 11 in. the j
week before against U.S.C. Sparling'
of Stanford is capable of 200 feet or j
better, and this should develop into (
j a great three-cornered tight for first, i
! Churchill of the Bears and Perelii- ;
i Minetti, Card sophomore, have both
! done 190 ft. and may break into the |
I scoring column.
The high jump appears to be Cali- j
| fornia's event with the pole vault and j
broad jump being pretty much ali '
Stanford. Jacklevitch and Bingaman I
placed one-two in the California- ■
Washington meet at heights of G ft. I
and 5 ft. 11 in. Templeton's three j
hopefuls, Austin, Madison, and Woody
att, could only get over the bar at j
5 ft. 9 in. against the All-Stars. Dick i
French has done 6 ft. and may be j
able to grab a second, and possibly >
a first.
Christie's best pole vaulter can
clear 12 ft., but this will not be good
enough for even a third place if'
1 Berry and Hulsman of Stanford are |
1 in form. Edmonds is of course con-'
! ceded first.
It will be up to Dowell, Zombro, and |
Anderson or West in the broad jump
i to keep the Bears from scoring more
than three points here. Dowell, be j
j cause of his consistently good per- j
! formances this year, is favored for j
1
' first, with Benny Lom of California j
i and the other Stanford men fighting J
| it out for the remaining points. Dias, I
; Bear jumper, who leaped 22 ft. 9 in. j
| against Washington, is another possi-!
bility for a place.
Anything is likely to happen in the j
field events, but the Big Meet results
for these six events ought to run i
fairly close to the following: .
Shot put—Rothert (S), first; Krenz
j (S), second; Forster )S), third. Stan-!
