# Watt Named For 'Moving On' Lead
## 
### 
Tom Watt has been selected by Gor
don Davis to fill the leading role of
the Junior Opera left vacant by the
withdrawal of Fenton Barrett, who
h;ts been forced to give up his part
on account of academic work.
Barrett, who was chairman of the
committee in charge of the "Theatre
Fund Follies" presented last week,
was forced to neglect his studies
while he was doing practically all the
organizing of the "Follies." Since then
he has declared that he would be un
able to devote the necessary time
which will be required for the ardu
ous rehearsals needed to prepare the
Junior Opera for production early
next month. Watt, who is taking Bar
rett's role as the young hero of the
musical comedy, played one of the
leads in last year's Junior Opera and
also took the part of the hero in "The
Devil in the Cheese" presented fall
quarter.
