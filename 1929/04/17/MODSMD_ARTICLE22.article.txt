# STUDENTS FAVOR CHANGE IN DRY LAWS; MODIFICATION IS SOUGHT
## Campus Opinion Is That Prohibition Has Been a Failure; Large Majority Seeks Retention of XVIII Amendment And Repeal of Volstead Act; Total of 820 Ballots Cast 
### 
rrHE DAILY'S Prohibition questionnaire yesterday revealed that the majority
of those who voted do not believe that Prohibition can be enforced; do
not believe it has been successful as it has existed to date; favor retention
of the XVIII Amendment; and favor repeal of the Volstead Act.
The indication that student opinion favors modification of the existing laws,
and not an absolute repeal, is to be derived from the fact that, by a majority
of 88 votes, it favors the retention of the XVIII Amendment but opposes the
Volstead Act â€”which defines intoxicating liquor.
A total of 820 votes was cast at the poll during the election hours from
8:30 to 2 o'clock. More than G5O men cast ballots as compared to 106
women's votes. Fifty-seven voters failed to classify their ballots as to class
or sex. Of the 820 students who voted on the issue, only a comparatively

$>small percentage's sentiments were
tolally "wet." An equally small per
centage was totally "dry." The re
mainder voted for a medium of the
f! two extremes.
The women's vote paralleled propor
tionally the men's with the exception
of the graduate women, who voted to
retain both the XVIII Amendment and
the Volstead Act, contrary to the
graduate men. The total women's vote
reveals that they believe Prohibition
cannot be enforced and that it has not
been a success; they favor the reten
tion of both the XVIII Amendment
and the Volstead Act.
Men students do not believe Prohi
bition can be enforced. They consider
it a failure by a majority of 422 votes,
j Like the women, they oppose the re
peal of the XVIII Amendment but are
strongly in favor of the abolition of
the Volstead Act.
The Freshman, Sophomore, and
Junior classes favor modification of
the Prohibition laws. The Freshman
men and women ,and the graduate
women are the only groups who be
lieve Prohibition can be enforced. All
the other groups consider enforcement
impossible. Not a single class divi
sion believes that Prohibition has been
successful.
The senior and graduate men agree
1 011 all questions, the upperclass and
i graduate women differing but slightly
I frcm the men on most angles of the
! issue.
