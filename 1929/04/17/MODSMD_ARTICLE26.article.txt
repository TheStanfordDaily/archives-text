# Student Opinion As An Indication
## 
### 
Dissatisfaction with the present condition of Prohibition was
voiced yesterday by a sizeable majority of the student body in the
questionnaire conducted by the Daily.
It was the majority consensus that Prohibition could not be
enforced, that it has not been successful as it has existed to date,
that the Eighteenth Amendment should be retained, and that the
Volstead Act should be repealed.
Since the Eighteenth Amendment is desired to be retained and
the Volstead Act repealed, it is to be concluded that modification
is desired. This parallels the result of the investigation carried on
November 17, 1926, on the campus.
Student opinion cannot solve the problem, but student opinion
favoring a change in the status quo of Prohibition is a strong indi
cation of maladjustment and of the need for immediate solution.
The opinion of the present student body has been moulded by
observation of Prohibition during the ten years of its existence as
it has existed in towns all over the country. It is the opinion of
the generation that will go into power in the next ten years. It
cannot be without significance.
The Daily believes that its questionnaire is not in vain when it
can focus student attention as it has done upon a problem that it
believes needful of the attention and action of the nation. As the
coming citizens, it is our duty to consider this problem seriously
and deeply, for only such consideration will bring about its solu
tion.
