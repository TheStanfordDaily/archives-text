The House of Women. Curran Thea
tre.
Nance O'Neill came to San Fran
cisco Monday with a lifeless play into
which she breathed a vital spark of
life by the sheer perfection of her act
ing. The part she played gave her
ample opportunity to demonstrate her
ability. She, as Julia Shane, had to
dominate the play entirely, and she
did. It gave her, also, a chance to
portray a part that was smooth and
controlled, and at the same time
backed by a tremendous amount of
leashed emotional power.
The story is Louis Bromfield's own
dramatization of his successful novel,
"The Green Bay Tree." It concerns
Julia Shane, iron-willed, wealthy, and
soul-branded by a life of strife with
her domineering, evil-eyed husband.
He has been dead for ten years, but
Julia Shane walks with a cane, lame,
as a testimony to one of his rages.
With hur, in "the house of women,"
live her two daughters. One is Lily—
sensual, voluptuous, beautiful—-like
her father in these respects. The
other daughter is Irene —egotist, big
oted —who releases her suppressed
emotions in frenzied church work
among the workingmen.
Into the lives of these three women
rome two men. There is Henry Bas
com, who is fat, ineffectual and soft.
He seduces Lily; but she refuses to
marry him and, being wealthy, goes
to Paris for three years, where her
child is born. Then there is Arthur
Morven, a sort of renegade preacher
who is devoting his life to fighting
side by side with the mill workers
for their cause.
The nunnish Irene worships Morven
as a rare example of what is to her
the perfect man, one untouched by
the lusts of the flesh and the devil.
But. when Lily comes back from Paris,
Arthur Morven falls madly in love
with her. Lily falls in love with liim,
too, for she sees in him a man who
is stronger than she is. Irene leaves
the house after calling down every
wrath of heaven upon the heads of
the others when she discovers that
even Morven is not perfect, and loves
her sister.

Julia Shane dies, happy that Lily
will probably be happy. The other
daughter, Irene, she never expects to
be happy.
From a standpoint of acting, the
death scene of Julia Shane is beyond
the criticism of any novice. But from
the standpoint of the audience, the
final scene in which Julia Shane is
dying seems a little long drawn out.
The long monologue of the dying wo
man is often too low-pitched, too ham
pered by convulsions, for the audi
ence to get the words.
The play is set in the "elaborately
1890" drawing room of the Shane
house. On the back wall there hangs
a large portrait of the man whose
spirit lives on to mould the life of
three women —his wife, and his two
daughters. There is a futile and fa
talistic conflict of wills in "The House
of Women." And this gives Nance
O'Neil and her supporting cast the
chance to give a performance that,
considered for its acting, is to be
highly praised and recommended.
