The Editor, Sir:
I present herewith my reasons for
advocating the eighteenth amendment
and all laws and regulations pertain
ing .to it thereof:
1. The idea of the people having
any constitutional rights is all a gi
gantic myth, anyway, and therefore
the mere fact that the prohibiton
laws, and especially the now effective
Jones law, imposes on the supposed
rights of an American citizen is no
argument for the repeal of said laws.
2. The good ladies of the W.C.T.U.
and the Anno Domini minded cohorts
of the Anti-Saloon League certainly
should possess more feeling, venera
tion, and wish-well sentiments for
our gorgeous country than such in
supportable and contemptible wets as
Alfred B. Smith, Hon. N. Murray But
ler, Hon. H. L. Mencken, former Sena
tor Reed, and others of the booze
camp. And inasmuch as it is to be
logically assumed that the aforesaid
noble individuals of the sewing-circle
clubs and dry crusading groups must
know that what they advocate is best
for the good of the country, their
opinions and the laws which are now
in force as a result of their activities
should be respected and obeyed.
3. That the constitution does not
specifically prohibit the prohibition of
liquors, which is in itself sufficient
proof that the present prohibition is
not prohibited by the constitution.
4. That it is better for people to
drink one-fifth of bad gin than a gal
lon of good gin.
5. That we have cut down on im
ports due to, the fact that we no
longer buy nearly as much liquor
abroad. This is always a patriotic as
pect of trade.
C. That the direct $50,000,000.00 and
indirect additional millions that prohi
bition costs us yearly is nothing to a
wealthy country like this. It amounts,
roughly, to about $1 per capita, and
ten times this is saved in doctor's bills
alone due to decreasing ailments
traced to lower consumption of liquor.
7. That Hon. William Randolph
Hearst is at present advocating,
through his newspapers, a repeal and
ratification of the prohibition laws,
and this, alone, due to the former
antics of the well-known publisher, is
enough to discredit the idea. It is to
be forgotten that the identical W. R.
Hearst, Esq., was instrumental in pre
senting us with the 1928 fiasco, which
is today venerated as a patriotic
achievement. However . . .
8. That although Christ, according
to Biblical evidence, is known to
have quaffed wine, he, if living today,
would frown upon the practice, due
to changed moral and economic con
ditions. A multitude of ministers are
authority for this assertion. To men
tion one, Hon. John Roach Straton,
Esq.
9. That once liquors are completely
abolished, the anti-vice forces of the
country can set out and campaign
against the awful nicotine weed,
which, in the form of cigarettes, is
now destroying the health and morals
of the nation. If prohibition is accom
plished these crusaders will have a
substantial background to work on.
10. That I don't drink. And if I can
get along without it, there is no rea
son why everyone else cannot.
11. That as far as the increase (ac
cusation of the wets) in drinking
among the younger sets is concerned,
this may be said: first,- that it is
greatly exaggerated; second, that if
young people are as stupid as to take
a chance with poison gin it's their
own lookout and it is better if such
law-breaking people are sent where
they can do no more earthly harm.
12. That the government will prob
ably soon flood the market with poi
son liquors simply to make people
beware of the bootlegger. If the gov
ernment has the power to allow a
policeman to kill it certainly should
be delegated the authority to poison
as much liquor as it deems necessary
to enforce a law of far greater moral
and social benefit than, say, that
against robbery.
13. That the criticism of the prohi
bition laws is not fair. It (prohibition)
has not been given a fair trial. After
about fifty years it will begin to oper
ate smoothly and really be effective.
"Rome was not built in a day." And
the river of booze that has been flood
ing mankind for the last two thousand
years cannot be diverted from its
course in merely a few years.
14. That all the political aspects of
the question are not as important as
the newspapers would make them.
The "I'm Alone" affair, while it in
volved us with three major powers,
can be disregarded. We are too strong
a nation for the countries implicated
in the above-mentioned incident to do
anything of consequence about it.
lf>. That the huge wave of bribery
in politics and general disregard for
law is not, as has been charged, due
to prohibition, but can be traced to
the after-war spirit.
16. Then when a law Is on the
statutes of the country it must be
enforced at all costs and with no re
straining influences.
Cordially yours,
MARTIN FRANKER

i Editor, Campus Opinion
j Dear Sir:
In today's edition of the Daily I
{notice an almost vituperative article,
| which condemns the attitude of a cer
tain Mr. Riddle. Instead of inciting
! me to manslaughter, the gentleman
j signing himself "A Liberal" gives in
! ducement to a feeling of pity in my
humble breast. With an out and out
disregard of the purpose behind the ;
j column known as "Campus Opinion,"
Mr. Liberal does everything but give
his opinion. But, without the presump
tion of the least authority but his !
own, he deliberately destroys Mr. j
Riddle's effort with the barrage of
what I strongly suspect to be his pet I
grievances. The admission of "A Lib- j
eral," that it is futile to argue with a
"prejudiced, sometimes stupid" per
son, denies me the right to argue with
him. Nevertheless, I would like to
point out clearly as may be pos
sible, the errors that Mr. Liberal falls
into.
First, few liberals would confess to 1
a desire for homicide after a careful
i perusal of Mr. Riddle's article.
Second, there is no constructive
suggestion in place of Mr. Riddle's.
Third, there are no facts for which
our "Liberal" has the least vestiges
of proof. As my proof for that last
I quote directly from the "liberal's"
article. He says, "As a matter of fact,
Mr. Riddle, we probably would be just
as prosperous a country today wlieth-1
er we had prohibition or not." Then ;
right in the next lines he questions |
Mr. Riddle's authority in regard to
Canadian statistics in the following;
manner. "Are these statistics un
biased and official?" —then goes on
to insinuate (the. right word) that
there is material regarding govern
ment regulation in Sweden that would j
disprove Mr. Riddle's statements.
Fourth, the claim is made that the j
"drys" are in the minority. If the ;
wets are a majority why is not the !
18th amendment repealed? Probably
Mr. Liberal is laboring under the hal
lucination that Mr. A1 Smith is the
President of the United States.
Fifth, "A Liberal" claims that "one
of ihe most damning indictments of
the 18th Amendment and the Volstead
Act" is, that the rich can get the
liquor, while the poor cannot, which
is, he maintains, undemocratic. If he
were a philosopher he would reason |
that the rich were in an unenviable i
position because they could sin so
much easier than the poor man. But
I fear that philosophy plays a minor
part in his life.
As far as the 18th Amendment may
be undemocratic it does rfot alter the
fact that no one law is considered
democratic by all the people. And
speaking of democracy, I wonder if
Mr. Liberal can point out where the
courts have convicted in five (5) cases j
interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of
speeding would it be logical to expect ;
that the public would rise against I
that law condemning speeding? Not !
likely. It should be remembered that j
senators are as human as the rest
of us.
The fundamental problem at the (
bottom of the 18th Amendment is j
this: Those people who drink but vote j
dry do so for some reason. Either
there is the fear that the saloon will
come back, or that the legalized sale [
of liquor will result in the loss of j
prosperity to business interests. Mr. j
Ford, and many other prominent busi- j
ness men, have stated that prosperity ,
is due to prohibition. It is hard to
imagine our tremendous savings ac- j
counts without prohibition.
In England a short time ago one of
ihe biggest sources of revenue was a
liquor tax. Imagine a government I
practically running on the degrada
tion of its people.
However, I lind it hard to believe j
that if the majority of people wanted j
liquor they would not want to get it
legally. There has been a great
amount of importance attached to the j
theory that the "bootleggers" want |
prohibition so that they can continue j
to make money. No facts being forth-1
coming relevant to the number of
"bootleggers and hijackers" I am con
strained to believe that they are not
numerous or powerful enough to sway
public sentiment or the ballot.
To those who believe that conditions j
are worse now than before prohibition
notice this. In San Francisco in 1916
there were saloons averaging three
to four in number on all the corners
of the streets of Market, Mission,
Howard, Folsom, and streets inter
secting them. Compare that picture I
with the one that greets the visitor j
today. Of course there is the reply i
that there are speakeasies in their
places but no official proof.
In regard to the article appearing
iu the Daily on Monday, written by
Mr. Templeton Peck, I find some in
consistency regarding the relntlon of
crime to prohibition. There is no proof

forthcoming which will be able to
separate the influences of the World
War on crime from those which Mr.
Peck says are attributable to prohibi
tion.
Mr. Peck has forgotten that a stu
dent who drinks thereby admits the
moral wrong of prohibition from his
viewpoint. Theoretically he may ad
mit its virtue at one and the same
time.
1 conclude with some lines from
Mr. Peck's article slightly transposed
to include my opinion. They are: I
believe that the findings of the com
mission appointed by President Hoo
ver will eventually convince the ma
jority of those on the fence, that pro
hibition has more virtues than vices,
and that unbiased enforcement of
laws relating to it will bring us to
the desired end —respect for all law,
properly conceived.
—Herbert A. Jones.
The Editor, Sir:
Such display of public indecency as
was perpetrated in today's election
with regard to Prohibition, calls for
strenuous protest from one of us who
still cherish morality, and heaven
knows there are few enough of us left.
In the lower right-hand corner of
the ballot on the Prohibition issue
was the question: SEX:
When a group of officers, chosen to
represent the student body, inquire
into popular opinion on the Prohibi
tion question, well and good; but
when these same officers openly, pub
licly. and in brazen English inquire
into a person's sex, that is carrying
curiosity too far. Is nothing sacred?
I am writing this as a sort of sequel
to Mr. Sturgis Riddle's essays on mor
ality, since Mr. Riddle was unable to
deal with the subject in the meager
space allotted to his work on your
editorial page during the past few
days. It is written as an aid to Mr.
Riddle's campaign, because no stone
should be left unturned until immor
ality is once anu forever driven from
our mongst! —Crusader.
The Editor, Sir:
As this morning's paper shows us,
the Knight of the Cross is riding ram
pant once more, waving the banner
of the late lamented Carrie Nation,
and shouting the battleery of freedom
—ireedom, that is, for the Anti-Saloon
League, but alas, Sir, Ave must con
fess that never, never before did so
concentrated a mass of tripe ever
strike our poor weak eyes. We were
deeply touched on reading how our
country has led the world in the abo
lition of slavery, the emancipation of
women, and prohibition; we had, how
ever, our doubts, which seem to be
substantiated by reputable historians,
and we even have heard that a certain
Mohammed thought of prohibition
long ago, but of course he was not
an Episcopalian, and perhaps should
not be counted.
Moreover, we were pleased to learn
that prohibition IS a success. Mr. Rid
dle himself has said it. Ipse dixit,
Autos Ipha, or what would you. But,
in spite of Mr. Riddle, and Mayor
Rolph, we are obliged to confess that
we fear that in certain Mission Street
establishments in San Francisco the
ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,
can be purchased in parts of the
state. We learn, too, that there is no
substitute for prohibition. Neither is
there a substitute for a desert. We
merely keep away.
We know, in spite of all our doubts,
that Mr. Riddle is an honest soul, who
obtains his information from books
endorsed by the Chicago Baptist As
sociation, and other absolutely un
biased societies, and further, we are
quite assured by this same young man
that sacramental wine, our sole dis
sipation, is quite all right, even though
we may like it.
Let Mr. Riddle not think that we
mean our criticism in an unkind way
—we admire his courage, and breath
lessly await some article of his on
witchcraft, or some kindred evil.
We remain, sir, most faithfully
yours,
A hired slave of the liquor trust.

i Editor, Campus Opinion
j Dear Sir:
In today's edition of the Daily I
{notice an almost vituperative article,
| which condemns the attitude of a cer
tain Mr. Riddle. Instead of inciting
! me to manslaughter, the gentleman
j signing himself "A Liberal" gives in
! ducement to a feeling of pity in my
humble breast. With an out and out
disregard of the purpose behind the ;
j column known as "Campus Opinion,"
Mr. Liberal does everything but give
his opinion. But, without the presump
tion of the least authority but his !
own, he deliberately destroys Mr. j
Riddle's effort with the barrage of
what I strongly suspect to be his pet I
grievances. The admission of "A Lib- j
eral," that it is futile to argue with a
"prejudiced, sometimes stupid" per
son, denies me the right to argue with
him. Nevertheless, I would like to
point out clearly as may be pos
sible, the errors that Mr. Liberal falls
into.
First, few liberals would confess to 1
a desire for homicide after a careful
i perusal of Mr. Riddle's article.
Second, there is no constructive
suggestion in place of Mr. Riddle's.
Third, there are no facts for which
our "Liberal" has the least vestiges
of proof. As my proof for that last
I quote directly from the "liberal's"
article. He says, "As a matter of fact,
Mr. Riddle, we probably would be just
as prosperous a country today wlieth-1
er we had prohibition or not." Then ;
right in the next lines he questions |
Mr. Riddle's authority in regard to
Canadian statistics in the following;
manner. "Are these statistics un
biased and official?" —then goes on
to insinuate (the. right word) that
there is material regarding govern
ment regulation in Sweden that would j
disprove Mr. Riddle's statements.
Fourth, the claim is made that the j
"drys" are in the minority. If the ;
wets are a majority why is not the !
18th amendment repealed? Probably
Mr. Liberal is laboring under the hal
lucination that Mr. A1 Smith is the
President of the United States.
Fifth, "A Liberal" claims that "one
of ihe most damning indictments of
the 18th Amendment and the Volstead
Act" is, that the rich can get the
liquor, while the poor cannot, which
is, he maintains, undemocratic. If he
were a philosopher he would reason |
that the rich were in an unenviable i
position because they could sin so
much easier than the poor man. But
I fear that philosophy plays a minor
part in his life.
As far as the 18th Amendment may
be undemocratic it does rfot alter the
fact that no one law is considered
democratic by all the people. And
speaking of democracy, I wonder if
Mr. Liberal can point out where the
courts have convicted in five (5) cases j
interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of
speeding would it be logical to expect ;
that the public would rise against I
that law condemning speeding? Not !
likely. It should be remembered that j
senators are as human as the rest
of us.
The fundamental problem at the (
bottom of the 18th Amendment is j
this: Those people who drink but vote j
dry do so for some reason. Either
there is the fear that the saloon will
come back, or that the legalized sale [
of liquor will result in the loss of j
prosperity to business interests. Mr. j
Ford, and many other prominent busi- j
ness men, have stated that prosperity ,
is due to prohibition. It is hard to
imagine our tremendous savings ac- j
counts without prohibition.
In England a short time ago one of
ihe biggest sources of revenue was a
liquor tax. Imagine a government I
practically running on the degrada
tion of its people.
However, I lind it hard to believe j
that if the majority of people wanted j
liquor they would not want to get it
legally. There has been a great
amount of importance attached to the j
theory that the "bootleggers" want |
prohibition so that they can continue j
to make money. No facts being forth-1
coming relevant to the number of
"bootleggers and hijackers" I am con
strained to believe that they are not
numerous or powerful enough to sway
public sentiment or the ballot.
To those who believe that conditions j
are worse now than before prohibition
notice this. In San Francisco in 1916
there were saloons averaging three
to four in number on all the corners
of the streets of Market, Mission,
Howard, Folsom, and streets inter
secting them. Compare that picture I
with the one that greets the visitor j
today. Of course there is the reply i
that there are speakeasies in their
places but no official proof.
In regard to the article appearing
iu the Daily on Monday, written by
Mr. Templeton Peck, I find some in
consistency regarding the relntlon of
crime to prohibition. There is no proof

forthcoming which will be able to
separate the influences of the World
War on crime from those which Mr.
Peck says are attributable to prohibi
tion.
Mr. Peck has forgotten that a stu
dent who drinks thereby admits the
moral wrong of prohibition from his
viewpoint. Theoretically he may ad
mit its virtue at one and the same
time.
1 conclude with some lines from
Mr. Peck's article slightly transposed
to include my opinion. They are: I
believe that the findings of the com
mission appointed by President Hoo
ver will eventually convince the ma
jority of those on the fence, that pro
hibition has more virtues than vices,
and that unbiased enforcement of
laws relating to it will bring us to
the desired end —respect for all law,
properly conceived.
—Herbert A. Jones.
The Editor, Sir:
Such display of public indecency as
was perpetrated in today's election
with regard to Prohibition, calls for
strenuous protest from one of us who
still cherish morality, and heaven
knows there are few enough of us left.
In the lower right-hand corner of
the ballot on the Prohibition issue
was the question: SEX:
When a group of officers, chosen to
represent the student body, inquire
into popular opinion on the Prohibi
tion question, well and good; but
when these same officers openly, pub
licly. and in brazen English inquire
into a person's sex, that is carrying
curiosity too far. Is nothing sacred?
I am writing this as a sort of sequel
to Mr. Sturgis Riddle's essays on mor
ality, since Mr. Riddle was unable to
deal with the subject in the meager
space allotted to his work on your
editorial page during the past few
days. It is written as an aid to Mr.
Riddle's campaign, because no stone
should be left unturned until immor
ality is once anu forever driven from
our mongst! —Crusader.
The Editor, Sir:
As this morning's paper shows us,
the Knight of the Cross is riding ram
pant once more, waving the banner
of the late lamented Carrie Nation,
and shouting the battleery of freedom
—ireedom, that is, for the Anti-Saloon
League, but alas, Sir, Ave must con
fess that never, never before did so
concentrated a mass of tripe ever
strike our poor weak eyes. We were
deeply touched on reading how our
country has led the world in the abo
lition of slavery, the emancipation of
women, and prohibition; we had, how
ever, our doubts, which seem to be
substantiated by reputable historians,
and we even have heard that a certain
Mohammed thought of prohibition
long ago, but of course he was not
an Episcopalian, and perhaps should
not be counted.
Moreover, we were pleased to learn
that prohibition IS a success. Mr. Rid
dle himself has said it. Ipse dixit,
Autos Ipha, or what would you. But,
in spite of Mr. Riddle, and Mayor
Rolph, we are obliged to confess that
we fear that in certain Mission Street
establishments in San Francisco the
ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,
can be purchased in parts of the
state. We learn, too, that there is no
substitute for prohibition. Neither is
there a substitute for a desert. We
merely keep away.
We know, in spite of all our doubts,
that Mr. Riddle is an honest soul, who
obtains his information from books
endorsed by the Chicago Baptist As
sociation, and other absolutely un
biased societies, and further, we are
quite assured by this same young man
that sacramental wine, our sole dis
sipation, is quite all right, even though
we may like it.
Let Mr. Riddle not think that we
mean our criticism in an unkind way
—we admire his courage, and breath
lessly await some article of his on
witchcraft, or some kindred evil.
We remain, sir, most faithfully
yours,
A hired slave of the liquor trust.
The Editor, Sir:
I present herewith my reasons for
advocating the eighteenth amendment
and all laws and regulations pertain
ing .to it thereof:
1. The idea of the people having
any constitutional rights is all a gi
gantic myth, anyway, and therefore
the mere fact that the prohibiton
laws, and especially the now effective
Jones law, imposes on the supposed
rights of an American citizen is no
argument for the repeal of said laws.
2. The good ladies of the W.C.T.U.
and the Anno Domini minded cohorts
of the Anti-Saloon League certainly
should possess more feeling, venera
tion, and wish-well sentiments for
our gorgeous country than such in
supportable and contemptible wets as
Alfred B. Smith, Hon. N. Murray But
ler, Hon. H. L. Mencken, former Sena
tor Reed, and others of the booze
camp. And inasmuch as it is to be
logically assumed that the aforesaid
noble individuals of the sewing-circle
clubs and dry crusading groups must
know that what they advocate is best
for the good of the country, their
opinions and the laws which are now
in force as a result of their activities
should be respected and obeyed.
3. That the constitution does not
specifically prohibit the prohibition of
liquors, which is in itself sufficient
proof that the present prohibition is
not prohibited by the constitution.
4. That it is better for people to
drink one-fifth of bad gin than a gal
lon of good gin.
5. That we have cut down on im
ports due to, the fact that we no
longer buy nearly as much liquor
abroad. This is always a patriotic as
pect of trade.
C. That the direct $50,000,000.00 and
indirect additional millions that prohi
bition costs us yearly is nothing to a
wealthy country like this. It amounts,
roughly, to about $1 per capita, and
ten times this is saved in doctor's bills
alone due to decreasing ailments
traced to lower consumption of liquor.
7. That Hon. William Randolph
Hearst is at present advocating,
through his newspapers, a repeal and
ratification of the prohibition laws,
and this, alone, due to the former
antics of the well-known publisher, is
enough to discredit the idea. It is to
be forgotten that the identical W. R.
Hearst, Esq., was instrumental in pre
senting us with the 1928 fiasco, which
is today venerated as a patriotic
achievement. However . . .
8. That although Christ, according
to Biblical evidence, is known to
have quaffed wine, he, if living today,
would frown upon the practice, due
to changed moral and economic con
ditions. A multitude of ministers are
authority for this assertion. To men

j signing himself "A Liberal" gives in
! ducement to a feeling of pity in my
humble breast. With an out and out
disregard of the purpose behind the ;
j column known as "Campus Opinion,"
Mr. Liberal does everything but give
his opinion. But, without the presump
tion of the least authority but his !
own, he deliberately destroys Mr. j
Riddle's effort with the barrage of
what I strongly suspect to be his pet I
grievances. The admission of "A Lib- j
eral," that it is futile to argue with a
"prejudiced, sometimes stupid" per
son, denies me the right to argue with
him. Nevertheless, I would like to
point out clearly as may be pos
sible, the errors that Mr. Liberal falls
into.
First, few liberals would confess to 1
a desire for homicide after a careful
i perusal of Mr. Riddle's article.
Second, there is no constructive
suggestion in place of Mr. Riddle's.
Third, there are no facts for which
our "Liberal" has the least vestiges
of proof. As my proof for that last
I quote directly from the "liberal's"
article. He says, "As a matter of fact,
Mr. Riddle, we probably would be just
as prosperous a country today wlieth-1
er we had prohibition or not." Then ;
right in the next lines he questions |
Mr. Riddle's authority in regard to
Canadian statistics in the following;
manner. "Are these statistics un
biased and official?" —then goes on
to insinuate (the. right word) that
there is material regarding govern
ment regulation in Sweden that would j
disprove Mr. Riddle's statements.
Fourth, the claim is made that the j
"drys" are in the minority. If the ;
wets are a majority why is not the !
18th amendment repealed? Probably
Mr. Liberal is laboring under the hal
lucination that Mr. A1 Smith is the
President of the United States.
Fifth, "A Liberal" claims that "one
of ihe most damning indictments of
the 18th Amendment and the Volstead
Act" is, that the rich can get the
liquor, while the poor cannot, which
is, he maintains, undemocratic. If he
were a philosopher he would reason |
that the rich were in an unenviable i
position because they could sin so
much easier than the poor man. But
I fear that philosophy plays a minor
part in his life.
As far as the 18th Amendment may
be undemocratic it does rfot alter the
fact that no one law is considered
democratic by all the people. And
speaking of democracy, I wonder if
Mr. Liberal can point out where the
courts have convicted in five (5) cases j
interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of
speeding would it be logical to expect ;
that the public would rise against I
that law condemning speeding? Not !
likely. It should be remembered that j
senators are as human as the rest
of us.
The fundamental problem at the (
bottom of the 18th Amendment is j
this: Those people who drink but vote j
dry do so for some reason. Either
there is the fear that the saloon will
come back, or that the legalized sale [
of liquor will result in the loss of j
prosperity to business interests. Mr. j
Ford, and many other prominent busi- j
ness men, have stated that prosperity ,
is due to prohibition. It is hard to
imagine our tremendous savings ac- j
counts without prohibition.
In England a short time ago one of
ihe biggest sources of revenue was a
liquor tax. Imagine a government I
practically running on the degrada
tion of its people.
However, I lind it hard to believe j
that if the majority of people wanted j
liquor they would not want to get it
legally. There has been a great
amount of importance attached to the j
theory that the "bootleggers" want |
prohibition so that they can continue j
to make money. No facts being forth-1
coming relevant to the number of
"bootleggers and hijackers" I am con
strained to believe that they are not
numerous or powerful enough to sway
public sentiment or the ballot.
To those who believe that conditions j
are worse now than before prohibition
notice this. In San Francisco in 1916
there were saloons averaging three
to four in number on all the corners
of the streets of Market, Mission,
Howard, Folsom, and streets inter
secting them. Compare that picture I
with the one that greets the visitor j
today. Of course there is the reply i
that there are speakeasies in their
places but no official proof.
In regard to the article appearing
iu the Daily on Monday, written by
Mr. Templeton Peck, I find some in
consistency regarding the relntlon of
crime to prohibition. There is no proof

forthcoming which will be able to
separate the influences of the World
War on crime from those which Mr.
Peck says are attributable to prohibi
tion.
Mr. Peck has forgotten that a stu
dent who drinks thereby admits the
moral wrong of prohibition from his
viewpoint. Theoretically he may ad
mit its virtue at one and the same
time.
1 conclude with some lines from
Mr. Peck's article slightly transposed
to include my opinion. They are: I
believe that the findings of the com
mission appointed by President Hoo
ver will eventually convince the ma
jority of those on the fence, that pro
hibition has more virtues than vices,
and that unbiased enforcement of
laws relating to it will bring us to
the desired end —respect for all law,
properly conceived.
—Herbert A. Jones.
The Editor, Sir:
Such display of public indecency as
was perpetrated in today's election
with regard to Prohibition, calls for
strenuous protest from one of us who
still cherish morality, and heaven
knows there are few enough of us left.
In the lower right-hand corner of
the ballot on the Prohibition issue
was the question: SEX:
When a group of officers, chosen to
represent the student body, inquire
into popular opinion on the Prohibi
tion question, well and good; but
when these same officers openly, pub
licly. and in brazen English inquire
into a person's sex, that is carrying
curiosity too far. Is nothing sacred?
I am writing this as a sort of sequel
to Mr. Sturgis Riddle's essays on mor
ality, since Mr. Riddle was unable to
deal with the subject in the meager
space allotted to his work on your
editorial page during the past few
days. It is written as an aid to Mr.
Riddle's campaign, because no stone
should be left unturned until immor
ality is once anu forever driven from
our mongst! —Crusader.
The Editor, Sir:
As this morning's paper shows us,
the Knight of the Cross is riding ram
pant once more, waving the banner
of the late lamented Carrie Nation,
and shouting the battleery of freedom
—ireedom, that is, for the Anti-Saloon
League, but alas, Sir, Ave must con
fess that never, never before did so
concentrated a mass of tripe ever
strike our poor weak eyes. We were
deeply touched on reading how our
country has led the world in the abo
lition of slavery, the emancipation of
women, and prohibition; we had, how
ever, our doubts, which seem to be
substantiated by reputable historians,
and we even have heard that a certain
Mohammed thought of prohibition
long ago, but of course he was not
an Episcopalian, and perhaps should
not be counted.
Moreover, we were pleased to learn
that prohibition IS a success. Mr. Rid
dle himself has said it. Ipse dixit,
Autos Ipha, or what would you. But,
in spite of Mr. Riddle, and Mayor
Rolph, we are obliged to confess that
we fear that in certain Mission Street
establishments in San Francisco the
ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,
can be purchased in parts of the
state. We learn, too, that there is no
substitute for prohibition. Neither is
there a substitute for a desert. We
merely keep away.
We know, in spite of all our doubts,
that Mr. Riddle is an honest soul, who
obtains his information from books
endorsed by the Chicago Baptist As
sociation, and other absolutely un
biased societies, and further, we are
quite assured by this same young man
that sacramental wine, our sole dis
sipation, is quite all right, even though
we may like it.
Let Mr. Riddle not think that we
mean our criticism in an unkind way
—we admire his courage, and breath
lessly await some article of his on
witchcraft, or some kindred evil.
We remain, sir, most faithfully
yours,
A hired slave of the liquor trust.
The Editor, Sir:
I present herewith my reasons for
advocating the eighteenth amendment
and all laws and regulations pertain
ing .to it thereof:
1. The idea of the people having
any constitutional rights is all a gi
gantic myth, anyway, and therefore
the mere fact that the prohibiton
laws, and especially the now effective
Jones law, imposes on the supposed
rights of an American citizen is no
argument for the repeal of said laws.
2. The good ladies of the W.C.T.U.
and the Anno Domini minded cohorts
of the Anti-Saloon League certainly
should possess more feeling, venera
tion, and wish-well sentiments for
our gorgeous country than such in
supportable and contemptible wets as
Alfred B. Smith, Hon. N. Murray But
ler, Hon. H. L. Mencken, former Sena
tor Reed, and others of the booze
camp. And inasmuch as it is to be
logically assumed that the aforesaid
noble individuals of the sewing-circle
clubs and dry crusading groups must
know that what they advocate is best
for the good of the country, their
opinions and the laws which are now
in force as a result of their activities
should be respected and obeyed.
3. That the constitution does not
specifically prohibit the prohibition of
liquors, which is in itself sufficient
proof that the present prohibition is
not prohibited by the constitution.
4. That it is better for people to
drink one-fifth of bad gin than a gal
lon of good gin.
5. That we have cut down on im
ports due to, the fact that we no
longer buy nearly as much liquor
abroad. This is always a patriotic as
pect of trade.
C. That the direct $50,000,000.00 and
indirect additional millions that prohi
bition costs us yearly is nothing to a
wealthy country like this. It amounts,
roughly, to about $1 per capita, and
ten times this is saved in doctor's bills
alone due to decreasing ailments
traced to lower consumption of liquor.
7. That Hon. William Randolph
Hearst is at present advocating,
through his newspapers, a repeal and
ratification of the prohibition laws,
and this, alone, due to the former
antics of the well-known publisher, is
enough to discredit the idea. It is to
be forgotten that the identical W. R.
Hearst, Esq., was instrumental in pre
senting us with the 1928 fiasco, which
is today venerated as a patriotic
achievement. However . . .
8. That although Christ, according
to Biblical evidence, is known to
have quaffed wine, he, if living today,
would frown upon the practice, due
to changed moral and economic con
ditions. A multitude of ministers are
authority for this assertion. To men
tion one, Hon. John Roach Straton,
Esq.
9. That once liquors are completely
abolished, the anti-vice forces of the
country can set out and campaign
against the awful nicotine weed,
which, in the form of cigarettes, is
now destroying the health and morals
of the nation. If prohibition is accom
plished these crusaders will have a
substantial background to work on.
10. That I don't drink. And if I can
get along without it, there is no rea
son why everyone else cannot.
11. That as far as the increase (ac
cusation of the wets) in drinking
among the younger sets is concerned,
this may be said: first,- that it is
greatly exaggerated; second, that if
young people are as stupid as to take
a chance with poison gin it's their
own lookout and it is better if such
law-breaking people are sent where
they can do no more earthly harm.
12. That the government will prob
ably soon flood the market with poi
son liquors simply to make people
beware of the bootlegger. If the gov
ernment has the power to allow a
policeman to kill it certainly should
be delegated the authority to poison
as much liquor as it deems necessary
to enforce a law of far greater moral
and social benefit than, say, that
against robbery.
13. That the criticism of the prohi
bition laws is not fair. It (prohibition)
has not been given a fair trial. After
about fifty years it will begin to oper
ate smoothly and really be effective.
"Rome was not built in a day." And
the river of booze that has been flood
ing mankind for the last two thousand
years cannot be diverted from its
course in merely a few years.
14. That all the political aspects of
the question are not as important as
the newspapers would make them.
The "I'm Alone" affair, while it in
volved us with three major powers,
can be disregarded. We are too strong
a nation for the countries implicated
in the above-mentioned incident to do
anything of consequence about it.
lf>. That the huge wave of bribery
in politics and general disregard for
law is not, as has been charged, due
to prohibition, but can be traced to
the after-war spirit.
16. Then when a law Is on the
statutes of the country it must be
enforced at all costs and with no re
straining influences.
Cordially yours,
MARTIN FRANKER

j Dear Sir:

interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of
speeding would it be logical to expect ;
that the public would rise against I
that law condemning speeding? Not !
likely. It should be remembered that j
senators are as human as the rest
of us.
The fundamental problem at the (
bottom of the 18th Amendment is j
this: Those people who drink but vote j
dry do so for some reason. Either
there is the fear that the saloon will
come back, or that the legalized sale [
of liquor will result in the loss of j
prosperity to business interests. Mr. j
Ford, and many other prominent busi- j
ness men, have stated that prosperity ,
is due to prohibition. It is hard to
imagine our tremendous savings ac- j
counts without prohibition.
In England a short time ago one of
ihe biggest sources of revenue was a
liquor tax. Imagine a government I
practically running on the degrada
tion of its people.
However, I lind it hard to believe j
that if the majority of people wanted j
liquor they would not want to get it
legally. There has been a great
amount of importance attached to the j
theory that the "bootleggers" want |
prohibition so that they can continue j
to make money. No facts being forth-1
coming relevant to the number of
"bootleggers and hijackers" I am con
strained to believe that they are not
numerous or powerful enough to sway
public sentiment or the ballot.
To those who believe that conditions j
are worse now than before prohibition
notice this. In San Francisco in 1916
there were saloons averaging three
to four in number on all the corners
of the streets of Market, Mission,
Howard, Folsom, and streets inter
secting them. Compare that picture I
with the one that greets the visitor j
today. Of course there is the reply i
that there are speakeasies in their
places but no official proof.
In regard to the article appearing
iu the Daily on Monday, written by
Mr. Templeton Peck, I find some in
consistency regarding the relntlon of
crime to prohibition. There is no proof

forthcoming which will be able to
separate the influences of the World
War on crime from those which Mr.
Peck says are attributable to prohibi
tion.
Mr. Peck has forgotten that a stu
dent who drinks thereby admits the
moral wrong of prohibition from his
viewpoint. Theoretically he may ad
mit its virtue at one and the same
time.
1 conclude with some lines from
Mr. Peck's article slightly transposed
to include my opinion. They are: I
believe that the findings of the com
mission appointed by President Hoo
ver will eventually convince the ma
jority of those on the fence, that pro
hibition has more virtues than vices,
and that unbiased enforcement of
laws relating to it will bring us to
the desired end —respect for all law,
properly conceived.

The Editor, Sir:
Such display of public indecency as
was perpetrated in today's election
with regard to Prohibition, calls for
strenuous protest from one of us who
still cherish morality, and heaven
knows there are few enough of us left.
In the lower right-hand corner of
the ballot on the Prohibition issue
was the question: SEX:
When a group of officers, chosen to
represent the student body, inquire
into popular opinion on the Prohibi
tion question, well and good; but
when these same officers openly, pub
licly. and in brazen English inquire
into a person's sex, that is carrying
curiosity too far. Is nothing sacred?
I am writing this as a sort of sequel
to Mr. Sturgis Riddle's essays on mor
ality, since Mr. Riddle was unable to
deal with the subject in the meager
space allotted to his work on your
editorial page during the past few
days. It is written as an aid to Mr.
Riddle's campaign, because no stone
should be left unturned until immor
ality is once anu forever driven from
our mongst! —Crusader.
The Editor, Sir:
As this morning's paper shows us,
the Knight of the Cross is riding ram
pant once more, waving the banner
of the late lamented Carrie Nation,
and shouting the battleery of freedom
—ireedom, that is, for the Anti-Saloon
League, but alas, Sir, Ave must con
fess that never, never before did so
concentrated a mass of tripe ever
strike our poor weak eyes. We were
deeply touched on reading how our
country has led the world in the abo
lition of slavery, the emancipation of
women, and prohibition; we had, how
ever, our doubts, which seem to be
substantiated by reputable historians,
and we even have heard that a certain
Mohammed thought of prohibition
long ago, but of course he was not
an Episcopalian, and perhaps should
not be counted.
Moreover, we were pleased to learn
that prohibition IS a success. Mr. Rid
dle himself has said it. Ipse dixit,
Autos Ipha, or what would you. But,
in spite of Mr. Riddle, and Mayor
Rolph, we are obliged to confess that
we fear that in certain Mission Street
establishments in San Francisco the
ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,
can be purchased in parts of the
state. We learn, too, that there is no
substitute for prohibition. Neither is
there a substitute for a desert. We
merely keep away.
We know, in spite of all our doubts,
that Mr. Riddle is an honest soul, who
obtains his information from books
endorsed by the Chicago Baptist As
sociation, and other absolutely un
biased societies, and further, we are
quite assured by this same young man
that sacramental wine, our sole dis
sipation, is quite all right, even though
we may like it.
Let Mr. Riddle not think that we
mean our criticism in an unkind way
—we admire his courage, and breath
lessly await some article of his on
witchcraft, or some kindred evil.
We remain, sir, most faithfully
yours,
A hired slave of the liquor trust.
The Editor, Sir:
I present herewith my reasons for
advocating the eighteenth amendment
and all laws and regulations pertain
ing .to it thereof:
1. The idea of the people having
any constitutional rights is all a gi
gantic myth, anyway, and therefore
the mere fact that the prohibiton
laws, and especially the now effective
Jones law, imposes on the supposed
rights of an American citizen is no
argument for the repeal of said laws.
2. The good ladies of the W.C.T.U.
and the Anno Domini minded cohorts
of the Anti-Saloon League certainly
should possess more feeling, venera
tion, and wish-well sentiments for
our gorgeous country than such in
supportable and contemptible wets as
Alfred B. Smith, Hon. N. Murray But
ler, Hon. H. L. Mencken, former Sena
tor Reed, and others of the booze
camp. And inasmuch as it is to be
logically assumed that the aforesaid
noble individuals of the sewing-circle
clubs and dry crusading groups must
know that what they advocate is best
for the good of the country, their
opinions and the laws which are now
in force as a result of their activities
should be respected and obeyed.
3. That the constitution does not
specifically prohibit the prohibition of
liquors, which is in itself sufficient
proof that the present prohibition is
not prohibited by the constitution.
4. That it is better for people to
drink one-fifth of bad gin than a gal
lon of good gin.
5. That we have cut down on im
ports due to, the fact that we no
longer buy nearly as much liquor
abroad. This is always a patriotic as
pect of trade.
C. That the direct $50,000,000.00 and
indirect additional millions that prohi
bition costs us yearly is nothing to a
wealthy country like this. It amounts,
roughly, to about $1 per capita, and
ten times this is saved in doctor's bills
alone due to decreasing ailments
traced to lower consumption of liquor.
7. That Hon. William Randolph
Hearst is at present advocating,
through his newspapers, a repeal and
ratification of the prohibition laws,
and this, alone, due to the former
antics of the well-known publisher, is
enough to discredit the idea. It is to
be forgotten that the identical W. R.
Hearst, Esq., was instrumental in pre
senting us with the 1928 fiasco, which
is today venerated as a patriotic
achievement. However . . .
8. That although Christ, according
to Biblical evidence, is known to
have quaffed wine, he, if living today,
would frown upon the practice, due
to changed moral and economic con
ditions. A multitude of ministers are
authority for this assertion. To men
tion one, Hon. John Roach Straton,
Esq.
9. That once liquors are completely
abolished, the anti-vice forces of the
country can set out and campaign
against the awful nicotine weed,
which, in the form of cigarettes, is
now destroying the health and morals
of the nation. If prohibition is accom
plished these crusaders will have a
substantial background to work on.
10. That I don't drink. And if I can
get along without it, there is no rea
son why everyone else cannot.
11. That as far as the increase (ac
cusation of the wets) in drinking
among the younger sets is concerned,
this may be said: first,- that it is
greatly exaggerated; second, that if
young people are as stupid as to take
a chance with poison gin it's their
own lookout and it is better if such
law-breaking people are sent where
they can do no more earthly harm.
12. That the government will prob
ably soon flood the market with poi
son liquors simply to make people
beware of the bootlegger. If the gov
ernment has the power to allow a
policeman to kill it certainly should
be delegated the authority to poison
as much liquor as it deems necessary
to enforce a law of far greater moral
and social benefit than, say, that
against robbery.
13. That the criticism of the prohi
bition laws is not fair. It (prohibition)
has not been given a fair trial. After
about fifty years it will begin to oper
ate smoothly and really be effective.
"Rome was not built in a day." And
the river of booze that has been flood
ing mankind for the last two thousand
years cannot be diverted from its
course in merely a few years.
14. That all the political aspects of
the question are not as important as
the newspapers would make them.
The "I'm Alone" affair, while it in
volved us with three major powers,
can be disregarded. We are too strong
a nation for the countries implicated
in the above-mentioned incident to do
anything of consequence about it.
lf>. That the huge wave of bribery
in politics and general disregard for
law is not, as has been charged, due
to prohibition, but can be traced to
the after-war spirit.
16. Then when a law Is on the
statutes of the country it must be
enforced at all costs and with no re
straining influences.
Cordially yours,
MARTIN FRANKER

i Editor, Campus Opinion
j Dear Sir:
In today's edition of the Daily I
{notice an almost vituperative article,
| which condemns the attitude of a cer
tain Mr. Riddle. Instead of inciting
! me to manslaughter, the gentleman
j signing himself "A Liberal" gives in
! ducement to a feeling of pity in my
humble breast. With an out and out
disregard of the purpose behind the ;
j column known as "Campus Opinion,"
Mr. Liberal does everything but give
his opinion. But, without the presump
tion of the least authority but his !
own, he deliberately destroys Mr. j
Riddle's effort with the barrage of
what I strongly suspect to be his pet I
grievances. The admission of "A Lib- j
eral," that it is futile to argue with a
"prejudiced, sometimes stupid" per
son, denies me the right to argue with
him. Nevertheless, I would like to
point out clearly as may be pos
sible, the errors that Mr. Liberal falls
into.
First, few liberals would confess to 1
a desire for homicide after a careful
i perusal of Mr. Riddle's article.
Second, there is no constructive
suggestion in place of Mr. Riddle's.
Third, there are no facts for which
our "Liberal" has the least vestiges
of proof. As my proof for that last
I quote directly from the "liberal's"
article. He says, "As a matter of fact,
Mr. Riddle, we probably would be just
as prosperous a country today wlieth-1
er we had prohibition or not." Then ;
right in the next lines he questions |
Mr. Riddle's authority in regard to
Canadian statistics in the following;
manner. "Are these statistics un
biased and official?" —then goes on
to insinuate (the. right word) that
there is material regarding govern
ment regulation in Sweden that would j
disprove Mr. Riddle's statements.
Fourth, the claim is made that the j
"drys" are in the minority. If the ;
wets are a majority why is not the !
18th amendment repealed? Probably
Mr. Liberal is laboring under the hal
lucination that Mr. A1 Smith is the
President of the United States.
Fifth, "A Liberal" claims that "one
of ihe most damning indictments of
the 18th Amendment and the Volstead
Act" is, that the rich can get the
liquor, while the poor cannot, which
is, he maintains, undemocratic. If he
were a philosopher he would reason |
that the rich were in an unenviable i
position because they could sin so
much easier than the poor man. But
I fear that philosophy plays a minor
part in his life.
As far as the 18th Amendment may
be undemocratic it does rfot alter the
fact that no one law is considered
democratic by all the people. And
speaking of democracy, I wonder if
Mr. Liberal can point out where the
courts have convicted in five (5) cases j
interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of

The Editor, Sir:
Such display of public indecency as
was perpetrated in today's election
with regard to Prohibition, calls for
strenuous protest from one of us who
still cherish morality, and heaven
knows there are few enough of us left.
In the lower right-hand corner of
the ballot on the Prohibition issue
was the question: SEX:
When a group of officers, chosen to
represent the student body, inquire
into popular opinion on the Prohibi
tion question, well and good; but
when these same officers openly, pub
licly. and in brazen English inquire
into a person's sex, that is carrying
curiosity too far. Is nothing sacred?
I am writing this as a sort of sequel
to Mr. Sturgis Riddle's essays on mor
ality, since Mr. Riddle was unable to
deal with the subject in the meager
space allotted to his work on your
editorial page during the past few
days. It is written as an aid to Mr.
Riddle's campaign, because no stone
should be left unturned until immor
ality is once anu forever driven from
our mongst! —Crusader.
The Editor, Sir:
As this morning's paper shows us,
the Knight of the Cross is riding ram
pant once more, waving the banner
of the late lamented Carrie Nation,
and shouting the battleery of freedom
—ireedom, that is, for the Anti-Saloon
League, but alas, Sir, Ave must con
fess that never, never before did so
concentrated a mass of tripe ever
strike our poor weak eyes. We were
deeply touched on reading how our
country has led the world in the abo
lition of slavery, the emancipation of
women, and prohibition; we had, how
ever, our doubts, which seem to be
substantiated by reputable historians,
and we even have heard that a certain
Mohammed thought of prohibition
long ago, but of course he was not
an Episcopalian, and perhaps should
not be counted.
Moreover, we were pleased to learn
that prohibition IS a success. Mr. Rid
dle himself has said it. Ipse dixit,
Autos Ipha, or what would you. But,
in spite of Mr. Riddle, and Mayor
Rolph, we are obliged to confess that
we fear that in certain Mission Street
establishments in San Francisco the
ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,
can be purchased in parts of the
state. We learn, too, that there is no
substitute for prohibition. Neither is
there a substitute for a desert. We
merely keep away.
We know, in spite of all our doubts,
that Mr. Riddle is an honest soul, who
obtains his information from books
endorsed by the Chicago Baptist As
sociation, and other absolutely un
biased societies, and further, we are
quite assured by this same young man
that sacramental wine, our sole dis
sipation, is quite all right, even though
we may like it.
Let Mr. Riddle not think that we
mean our criticism in an unkind way
—we admire his courage, and breath
lessly await some article of his on
witchcraft, or some kindred evil.
We remain, sir, most faithfully
yours,
A hired slave of the liquor trust.
The Editor, Sir:
I present herewith my reasons for
advocating the eighteenth amendment
and all laws and regulations pertain
ing .to it thereof:
1. The idea of the people having
any constitutional rights is all a gi
gantic myth, anyway, and therefore
the mere fact that the prohibiton
laws, and especially the now effective
Jones law, imposes on the supposed
rights of an American citizen is no
argument for the repeal of said laws.
2. The good ladies of the W.C.T.U.
and the Anno Domini minded cohorts
of the Anti-Saloon League certainly
should possess more feeling, venera
tion, and wish-well sentiments for
our gorgeous country than such in
supportable and contemptible wets as
Alfred B. Smith, Hon. N. Murray But
ler, Hon. H. L. Mencken, former Sena
tor Reed, and others of the booze
camp. And inasmuch as it is to be
logically assumed that the aforesaid
noble individuals of the sewing-circle
clubs and dry crusading groups must
know that what they advocate is best
for the good of the country, their
opinions and the laws which are now
in force as a result of their activities
should be respected and obeyed.
3. That the constitution does not
specifically prohibit the prohibition of
liquors, which is in itself sufficient
proof that the present prohibition is
not prohibited by the constitution.
4. That it is better for people to
drink one-fifth of bad gin than a gal
lon of good gin.
5. That we have cut down on im
ports due to, the fact that we no
longer buy nearly as much liquor
abroad. This is always a patriotic as
pect of trade.
C. That the direct $50,000,000.00 and
indirect additional millions that prohi
bition costs us yearly is nothing to a
wealthy country like this. It amounts,
roughly, to about $1 per capita, and
ten times this is saved in doctor's bills
alone due to decreasing ailments
traced to lower consumption of liquor.
7. That Hon. William Randolph
Hearst is at present advocating,
through his newspapers, a repeal and
ratification of the prohibition laws,
and this, alone, due to the former
antics of the well-known publisher, is
enough to discredit the idea. It is to
be forgotten that the identical W. R.
Hearst, Esq., was instrumental in pre
senting us with the 1928 fiasco, which
is today venerated as a patriotic
achievement. However . . .
8. That although Christ, according
to Biblical evidence, is known to
have quaffed wine, he, if living today,
would frown upon the practice, due
to changed moral and economic con
ditions. A multitude of ministers are
authority for this assertion. To men
tion one, Hon. John Roach Straton,
Esq.
9. That once liquors are completely
abolished, the anti-vice forces of the
country can set out and campaign
against the awful nicotine weed,
which, in the form of cigarettes, is
now destroying the health and morals
of the nation. If prohibition is accom
plished these crusaders will have a
substantial background to work on.
10. That I don't drink. And if I can
get along without it, there is no rea
son why everyone else cannot.
11. That as far as the increase (ac
cusation of the wets) in drinking
among the younger sets is concerned,
this may be said: first,- that it is
greatly exaggerated; second, that if
young people are as stupid as to take
a chance with poison gin it's their
own lookout and it is better if such
law-breaking people are sent where
they can do no more earthly harm.
12. That the government will prob
ably soon flood the market with poi
son liquors simply to make people
beware of the bootlegger. If the gov
ernment has the power to allow a
policeman to kill it certainly should
be delegated the authority to poison
as much liquor as it deems necessary
to enforce a law of far greater moral
and social benefit than, say, that
against robbery.
13. That the criticism of the prohi
bition laws is not fair. It (prohibition)
has not been given a fair trial. After
about fifty years it will begin to oper
ate smoothly and really be effective.
"Rome was not built in a day." And
the river of booze that has been flood
ing mankind for the last two thousand
years cannot be diverted from its
course in merely a few years.
14. That all the political aspects of
the question are not as important as
the newspapers would make them.
The "I'm Alone" affair, while it in
volved us with three major powers,
can be disregarded. We are too strong
a nation for the countries implicated
in the above-mentioned incident to do
anything of consequence about it.
lf>. That the huge wave of bribery
in politics and general disregard for
law is not, as has been charged, due
to prohibition, but can be traced to
the after-war spirit.
16. Then when a law Is on the
statutes of the country it must be
enforced at all costs and with no re
straining influences.
Cordially yours,
MARTIN FRANKER

i Editor, Campus Opinion
j Dear Sir:
In today's edition of the Daily I
{notice an almost vituperative article,
| which condemns the attitude of a cer
tain Mr. Riddle. Instead of inciting
! me to manslaughter, the gentleman
j signing himself "A Liberal" gives in
! ducement to a feeling of pity in my
humble breast. With an out and out
disregard of the purpose behind the ;
j column known as "Campus Opinion,"
Mr. Liberal does everything but give
his opinion. But, without the presump
tion of the least authority but his !
own, he deliberately destroys Mr. j
Riddle's effort with the barrage of
what I strongly suspect to be his pet I
grievances. The admission of "A Lib- j
eral," that it is futile to argue with a
"prejudiced, sometimes stupid" per
son, denies me the right to argue with
him. Nevertheless, I would like to
point out clearly as may be pos
sible, the errors that Mr. Liberal falls
into.
First, few liberals would confess to 1
a desire for homicide after a careful
i perusal of Mr. Riddle's article.
Second, there is no constructive
suggestion in place of Mr. Riddle's.
Third, there are no facts for which
our "Liberal" has the least vestiges
of proof. As my proof for that last
I quote directly from the "liberal's"
article. He says, "As a matter of fact,
Mr. Riddle, we probably would be just
as prosperous a country today wlieth-1
er we had prohibition or not." Then ;
right in the next lines he questions |
Mr. Riddle's authority in regard to
Canadian statistics in the following;
manner. "Are these statistics un
biased and official?" —then goes on
to insinuate (the. right word) that
there is material regarding govern
ment regulation in Sweden that would j
disprove Mr. Riddle's statements.
Fourth, the claim is made that the j
"drys" are in the minority. If the ;
wets are a majority why is not the !
18th amendment repealed? Probably
Mr. Liberal is laboring under the hal
lucination that Mr. A1 Smith is the
President of the United States.
Fifth, "A Liberal" claims that "one
of ihe most damning indictments of
the 18th Amendment and the Volstead
Act" is, that the rich can get the
liquor, while the poor cannot, which
is, he maintains, undemocratic. If he
were a philosopher he would reason |
that the rich were in an unenviable i
position because they could sin so
much easier than the poor man. But
I fear that philosophy plays a minor
part in his life.
As far as the 18th Amendment may
be undemocratic it does rfot alter the
fact that no one law is considered
democratic by all the people. And
speaking of democracy, I wonder if
Mr. Liberal can point out where the
courts have convicted in five (5) cases j
interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of
speeding would it be logical to expect ;
that the public would rise against I
that law condemning speeding? Not !
likely. It should be remembered that j
senators are as human as the rest
of us.
The fundamental problem at the (
bottom of the 18th Amendment is j
this: Those people who drink but vote j
dry do so for some reason. Either
there is the fear that the saloon will
come back, or that the legalized sale [
of liquor will result in the loss of j
prosperity to business interests. Mr. j
Ford, and many other prominent busi- j
ness men, have stated that prosperity ,
is due to prohibition. It is hard to
imagine our tremendous savings ac- j
counts without prohibition.
In England a short time ago one of
ihe biggest sources of revenue was a
liquor tax. Imagine a government I
practically running on the degrada
tion of its people.
However, I lind it hard to believe j
that if the majority of people wanted j
liquor they would not want to get it
legally. There has been a great
amount of importance attached to the j
theory that the "bootleggers" want |
prohibition so that they can continue j
to make money. No facts being forth-1
coming relevant to the number of
"bootleggers and hijackers" I am con
strained to believe that they are not
numerous or powerful enough to sway
public sentiment or the ballot.
To those who believe that conditions j
are worse now than before prohibition
notice this. In San Francisco in 1916
there were saloons averaging three
to four in number on all the corners
of the streets of Market, Mission,
Howard, Folsom, and streets inter
secting them. Compare that picture I
with the one that greets the visitor j
today. Of course there is the reply i
that there are speakeasies in their
places but no official proof.
In regard to the article appearing
iu the Daily on Monday, written by
Mr. Templeton Peck, I find some in
consistency regarding the relntlon of
crime to prohibition. There is no proof

forthcoming which will be able to
separate the influences of the World
War on crime from those which Mr.
Peck says are attributable to prohibi
tion.
Mr. Peck has forgotten that a stu
dent who drinks thereby admits the
moral wrong of prohibition from his
viewpoint. Theoretically he may ad
mit its virtue at one and the same
time.
1 conclude with some lines from
Mr. Peck's article slightly transposed
to include my opinion. They are: I
believe that the findings of the com
mission appointed by President Hoo
ver will eventually convince the ma
jority of those on the fence, that pro
hibition has more virtues than vices,

ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,
can be purchased in parts of the
state. We learn, too, that there is no
substitute for prohibition. Neither is
there a substitute for a desert. We
merely keep away.
We know, in spite of all our doubts,
that Mr. Riddle is an honest soul, who
obtains his information from books
endorsed by the Chicago Baptist As
sociation, and other absolutely un
biased societies, and further, we are
quite assured by this same young man
that sacramental wine, our sole dis
sipation, is quite all right, even though
we may like it.
Let Mr. Riddle not think that we
mean our criticism in an unkind way
—we admire his courage, and breath
lessly await some article of his on
witchcraft, or some kindred evil.
We remain, sir, most faithfully
yours,
A hired slave of the liquor trust.
The Editor, Sir:
I present herewith my reasons for
advocating the eighteenth amendment
and all laws and regulations pertain
ing .to it thereof:
1. The idea of the people having
any constitutional rights is all a gi
gantic myth, anyway, and therefore
the mere fact that the prohibiton
laws, and especially the now effective
Jones law, imposes on the supposed
rights of an American citizen is no
argument for the repeal of said laws.
2. The good ladies of the W.C.T.U.
and the Anno Domini minded cohorts
of the Anti-Saloon League certainly
should possess more feeling, venera
tion, and wish-well sentiments for
our gorgeous country than such in
supportable and contemptible wets as
Alfred B. Smith, Hon. N. Murray But
ler, Hon. H. L. Mencken, former Sena
tor Reed, and others of the booze
camp. And inasmuch as it is to be
logically assumed that the aforesaid
noble individuals of the sewing-circle
clubs and dry crusading groups must
know that what they advocate is best
for the good of the country, their
opinions and the laws which are now
in force as a result of their activities
should be respected and obeyed.
3. That the constitution does not
specifically prohibit the prohibition of
liquors, which is in itself sufficient
proof that the present prohibition is
not prohibited by the constitution.
4. That it is better for people to
drink one-fifth of bad gin than a gal
lon of good gin.
5. That we have cut down on im
ports due to, the fact that we no
longer buy nearly as much liquor
abroad. This is always a patriotic as
pect of trade.
C. That the direct $50,000,000.00 and
indirect additional millions that prohi
bition costs us yearly is nothing to a
wealthy country like this. It amounts,
roughly, to about $1 per capita, and
ten times this is saved in doctor's bills
alone due to decreasing ailments
traced to lower consumption of liquor.
7. That Hon. William Randolph
Hearst is at present advocating,
through his newspapers, a repeal and
ratification of the prohibition laws,
and this, alone, due to the former
antics of the well-known publisher, is
enough to discredit the idea. It is to
be forgotten that the identical W. R.
Hearst, Esq., was instrumental in pre
senting us with the 1928 fiasco, which
is today venerated as a patriotic
achievement. However . . .
8. That although Christ, according
to Biblical evidence, is known to
have quaffed wine, he, if living today,
would frown upon the practice, due
to changed moral and economic con
ditions. A multitude of ministers are
authority for this assertion. To men
tion one, Hon. John Roach Straton,
Esq.
9. That once liquors are completely
abolished, the anti-vice forces of the
country can set out and campaign
against the awful nicotine weed,
which, in the form of cigarettes, is
now destroying the health and morals
of the nation. If prohibition is accom
plished these crusaders will have a
substantial background to work on.
10. That I don't drink. And if I can
get along without it, there is no rea
son why everyone else cannot.
11. That as far as the increase (ac
cusation of the wets) in drinking
among the younger sets is concerned,
this may be said: first,- that it is
greatly exaggerated; second, that if
young people are as stupid as to take
a chance with poison gin it's their
own lookout and it is better if such
law-breaking people are sent where
they can do no more earthly harm.
12. That the government will prob
ably soon flood the market with poi
son liquors simply to make people
beware of the bootlegger. If the gov
ernment has the power to allow a
policeman to kill it certainly should
be delegated the authority to poison
as much liquor as it deems necessary
to enforce a law of far greater moral
and social benefit than, say, that
against robbery.
13. That the criticism of the prohi
bition laws is not fair. It (prohibition)
has not been given a fair trial. After
about fifty years it will begin to oper
ate smoothly and really be effective.
"Rome was not built in a day." And
the river of booze that has been flood
ing mankind for the last two thousand
years cannot be diverted from its
course in merely a few years.
14. That all the political aspects of
the question are not as important as
the newspapers would make them.
The "I'm Alone" affair, while it in
volved us with three major powers,
can be disregarded. We are too strong
a nation for the countries implicated
in the above-mentioned incident to do
anything of consequence about it.
lf>. That the huge wave of bribery
in politics and general disregard for
law is not, as has been charged, due
to prohibition, but can be traced to
the after-war spirit.
16. Then when a law Is on the
statutes of the country it must be
enforced at all costs and with no re
straining influences.
Cordially yours,
MARTIN FRANKER

i Editor, Campus Opinion
j Dear Sir:
In today's edition of the Daily I
{notice an almost vituperative article,
| which condemns the attitude of a cer
tain Mr. Riddle. Instead of inciting
! me to manslaughter, the gentleman
j signing himself "A Liberal" gives in
! ducement to a feeling of pity in my
humble breast. With an out and out
disregard of the purpose behind the ;
j column known as "Campus Opinion,"
Mr. Liberal does everything but give
his opinion. But, without the presump
tion of the least authority but his !
own, he deliberately destroys Mr. j
Riddle's effort with the barrage of
what I strongly suspect to be his pet I
grievances. The admission of "A Lib- j
eral," that it is futile to argue with a
"prejudiced, sometimes stupid" per
son, denies me the right to argue with
him. Nevertheless, I would like to
point out clearly as may be pos
sible, the errors that Mr. Liberal falls
into.
First, few liberals would confess to 1
a desire for homicide after a careful
i perusal of Mr. Riddle's article.
Second, there is no constructive
suggestion in place of Mr. Riddle's.
Third, there are no facts for which
our "Liberal" has the least vestiges
of proof. As my proof for that last
I quote directly from the "liberal's"
article. He says, "As a matter of fact,
Mr. Riddle, we probably would be just
as prosperous a country today wlieth-1
er we had prohibition or not." Then ;
right in the next lines he questions |
Mr. Riddle's authority in regard to
Canadian statistics in the following;
manner. "Are these statistics un
biased and official?" —then goes on
to insinuate (the. right word) that
there is material regarding govern
ment regulation in Sweden that would j
disprove Mr. Riddle's statements.
Fourth, the claim is made that the j
"drys" are in the minority. If the ;
wets are a majority why is not the !
18th amendment repealed? Probably
Mr. Liberal is laboring under the hal
lucination that Mr. A1 Smith is the
President of the United States.
Fifth, "A Liberal" claims that "one
of ihe most damning indictments of
the 18th Amendment and the Volstead
Act" is, that the rich can get the
liquor, while the poor cannot, which
is, he maintains, undemocratic. If he
were a philosopher he would reason |
that the rich were in an unenviable i
position because they could sin so
much easier than the poor man. But
I fear that philosophy plays a minor
part in his life.
As far as the 18th Amendment may
be undemocratic it does rfot alter the
fact that no one law is considered
democratic by all the people. And
speaking of democracy, I wonder if
Mr. Liberal can point out where the
courts have convicted in five (5) cases j
interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of
speeding would it be logical to expect ;
that the public would rise against I
that law condemning speeding? Not !
likely. It should be remembered that j
senators are as human as the rest
of us.
The fundamental problem at the (
bottom of the 18th Amendment is j
this: Those people who drink but vote j
dry do so for some reason. Either
there is the fear that the saloon will
come back, or that the legalized sale [
of liquor will result in the loss of j
prosperity to business interests. Mr. j
Ford, and many other prominent busi- j
ness men, have stated that prosperity ,
is due to prohibition. It is hard to
imagine our tremendous savings ac- j
counts without prohibition.
In England a short time ago one of
ihe biggest sources of revenue was a
liquor tax. Imagine a government I
practically running on the degrada
tion of its people.
However, I lind it hard to believe j
that if the majority of people wanted j
liquor they would not want to get it
legally. There has been a great
amount of importance attached to the j
theory that the "bootleggers" want |
prohibition so that they can continue j
to make money. No facts being forth-1
coming relevant to the number of
"bootleggers and hijackers" I am con
strained to believe that they are not
numerous or powerful enough to sway
public sentiment or the ballot.
To those who believe that conditions j
are worse now than before prohibition
notice this. In San Francisco in 1916
there were saloons averaging three
to four in number on all the corners
of the streets of Market, Mission,
Howard, Folsom, and streets inter
secting them. Compare that picture I
with the one that greets the visitor j
today. Of course there is the reply i
that there are speakeasies in their
places but no official proof.
In regard to the article appearing
iu the Daily on Monday, written by
Mr. Templeton Peck, I find some in
consistency regarding the relntlon of
crime to prohibition. There is no proof

forthcoming which will be able to
separate the influences of the World
War on crime from those which Mr.
Peck says are attributable to prohibi
tion.
Mr. Peck has forgotten that a stu
dent who drinks thereby admits the
moral wrong of prohibition from his
viewpoint. Theoretically he may ad
mit its virtue at one and the same
time.
1 conclude with some lines from
Mr. Peck's article slightly transposed
to include my opinion. They are: I
believe that the findings of the com
mission appointed by President Hoo
ver will eventually convince the ma
jority of those on the fence, that pro
hibition has more virtues than vices,
and that unbiased enforcement of
laws relating to it will bring us to
the desired end —respect for all law,
properly conceived.
—Herbert A. Jones.
The Editor, Sir:
Such display of public indecency as
was perpetrated in today's election
with regard to Prohibition, calls for
strenuous protest from one of us who
still cherish morality, and heaven
knows there are few enough of us left.
In the lower right-hand corner of
the ballot on the Prohibition issue
was the question: SEX:
When a group of officers, chosen to
represent the student body, inquire
into popular opinion on the Prohibi
tion question, well and good; but
when these same officers openly, pub
licly. and in brazen English inquire
into a person's sex, that is carrying
curiosity too far. Is nothing sacred?
I am writing this as a sort of sequel
to Mr. Sturgis Riddle's essays on mor
ality, since Mr. Riddle was unable to
deal with the subject in the meager
space allotted to his work on your
editorial page during the past few
days. It is written as an aid to Mr.
Riddle's campaign, because no stone
should be left unturned until immor
ality is once anu forever driven from
our mongst! —Crusader.
The Editor, Sir:
As this morning's paper shows us,
the Knight of the Cross is riding ram
pant once more, waving the banner
of the late lamented Carrie Nation,
and shouting the battleery of freedom
—ireedom, that is, for the Anti-Saloon
League, but alas, Sir, Ave must con
fess that never, never before did so
concentrated a mass of tripe ever
strike our poor weak eyes. We were
deeply touched on reading how our
country has led the world in the abo
lition of slavery, the emancipation of
women, and prohibition; we had, how
ever, our doubts, which seem to be
substantiated by reputable historians,
and we even have heard that a certain
Mohammed thought of prohibition
long ago, but of course he was not
an Episcopalian, and perhaps should
not be counted.
Moreover, we were pleased to learn
that prohibition IS a success. Mr. Rid
dle himself has said it. Ipse dixit,
Autos Ipha, or what would you. But,
in spite of Mr. Riddle, and Mayor
Rolph, we are obliged to confess that
we fear that in certain Mission Street
establishments in San Francisco the
ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,

i Editor, Campus Opinion
j Dear Sir:
In today's edition of the Daily I
{notice an almost vituperative article,
| which condemns the attitude of a cer
tain Mr. Riddle. Instead of inciting
! me to manslaughter, the gentleman
j signing himself "A Liberal" gives in
! ducement to a feeling of pity in my
humble breast. With an out and out
disregard of the purpose behind the ;
j column known as "Campus Opinion,"
Mr. Liberal does everything but give
his opinion. But, without the presump
tion of the least authority but his !
own, he deliberately destroys Mr. j
Riddle's effort with the barrage of
what I strongly suspect to be his pet I
grievances. The admission of "A Lib- j
eral," that it is futile to argue with a
"prejudiced, sometimes stupid" per
son, denies me the right to argue with
him. Nevertheless, I would like to
point out clearly as may be pos
sible, the errors that Mr. Liberal falls
into.
First, few liberals would confess to 1
a desire for homicide after a careful
i perusal of Mr. Riddle's article.
Second, there is no constructive
suggestion in place of Mr. Riddle's.
Third, there are no facts for which
our "Liberal" has the least vestiges
of proof. As my proof for that last
I quote directly from the "liberal's"
article. He says, "As a matter of fact,
Mr. Riddle, we probably would be just
as prosperous a country today wlieth-1
er we had prohibition or not." Then ;
right in the next lines he questions |
Mr. Riddle's authority in regard to
Canadian statistics in the following;
manner. "Are these statistics un
biased and official?" —then goes on
to insinuate (the. right word) that
there is material regarding govern
ment regulation in Sweden that would j
disprove Mr. Riddle's statements.
Fourth, the claim is made that the j
"drys" are in the minority. If the ;
wets are a majority why is not the !
18th amendment repealed? Probably
Mr. Liberal is laboring under the hal
lucination that Mr. A1 Smith is the
President of the United States.
Fifth, "A Liberal" claims that "one
of ihe most damning indictments of
the 18th Amendment and the Volstead
Act" is, that the rich can get the
liquor, while the poor cannot, which
is, he maintains, undemocratic. If he
were a philosopher he would reason |
that the rich were in an unenviable i
position because they could sin so
much easier than the poor man. But
I fear that philosophy plays a minor
part in his life.
As far as the 18th Amendment may
be undemocratic it does rfot alter the
fact that no one law is considered
democratic by all the people. And
speaking of democracy, I wonder if
Mr. Liberal can point out where the
courts have convicted in five (5) cases j
interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of
speeding would it be logical to expect ;
that the public would rise against I
that law condemning speeding? Not !
likely. It should be remembered that j
senators are as human as the rest
of us.
The fundamental problem at the (
bottom of the 18th Amendment is j
this: Those people who drink but vote j
dry do so for some reason. Either
there is the fear that the saloon will
come back, or that the legalized sale [
of liquor will result in the loss of j
prosperity to business interests. Mr. j
Ford, and many other prominent busi- j
ness men, have stated that prosperity ,
is due to prohibition. It is hard to
imagine our tremendous savings ac- j
counts without prohibition.
In England a short time ago one of
ihe biggest sources of revenue was a
liquor tax. Imagine a government I
practically running on the degrada
tion of its people.
However, I lind it hard to believe j
that if the majority of people wanted j
liquor they would not want to get it
legally. There has been a great
amount of importance attached to the j
theory that the "bootleggers" want |
prohibition so that they can continue j
to make money. No facts being forth-1
coming relevant to the number of
"bootleggers and hijackers" I am con
strained to believe that they are not
numerous or powerful enough to sway
public sentiment or the ballot.
To those who believe that conditions j
are worse now than before prohibition
notice this. In San Francisco in 1916
there were saloons averaging three
to four in number on all the corners
of the streets of Market, Mission,
Howard, Folsom, and streets inter
secting them. Compare that picture I
with the one that greets the visitor j
today. Of course there is the reply i
that there are speakeasies in their
places but no official proof.
In regard to the article appearing
iu the Daily on Monday, written by
Mr. Templeton Peck, I find some in
consistency regarding the relntlon of
crime to prohibition. There is no proof

forthcoming which will be able to
separate the influences of the World
War on crime from those which Mr.
Peck says are attributable to prohibi
tion.
Mr. Peck has forgotten that a stu
dent who drinks thereby admits the
moral wrong of prohibition from his
viewpoint. Theoretically he may ad
mit its virtue at one and the same
time.
1 conclude with some lines from
Mr. Peck's article slightly transposed
to include my opinion. They are: I
believe that the findings of the com
mission appointed by President Hoo
ver will eventually convince the ma
jority of those on the fence, that pro
hibition has more virtues than vices,
and that unbiased enforcement of
laws relating to it will bring us to
the desired end —respect for all law,
properly conceived.
—Herbert A. Jones.
The Editor, Sir:
Such display of public indecency as
was perpetrated in today's election
with regard to Prohibition, calls for
strenuous protest from one of us who
still cherish morality, and heaven
knows there are few enough of us left.
In the lower right-hand corner of
the ballot on the Prohibition issue
was the question: SEX:
When a group of officers, chosen to
represent the student body, inquire
into popular opinion on the Prohibi
tion question, well and good; but
when these same officers openly, pub
licly. and in brazen English inquire
into a person's sex, that is carrying
curiosity too far. Is nothing sacred?
I am writing this as a sort of sequel
to Mr. Sturgis Riddle's essays on mor
ality, since Mr. Riddle was unable to
deal with the subject in the meager
space allotted to his work on your
editorial page during the past few
days. It is written as an aid to Mr.
Riddle's campaign, because no stone
should be left unturned until immor
ality is once anu forever driven from
our mongst! —Crusader.
The Editor, Sir:
As this morning's paper shows us,
the Knight of the Cross is riding ram
pant once more, waving the banner
of the late lamented Carrie Nation,
and shouting the battleery of freedom
—ireedom, that is, for the Anti-Saloon
League, but alas, Sir, Ave must con
fess that never, never before did so
concentrated a mass of tripe ever
strike our poor weak eyes. We were
deeply touched on reading how our
country has led the world in the abo
lition of slavery, the emancipation of
women, and prohibition; we had, how
ever, our doubts, which seem to be
substantiated by reputable historians,
and we even have heard that a certain
Mohammed thought of prohibition
long ago, but of course he was not
an Episcopalian, and perhaps should
not be counted.
Moreover, we were pleased to learn
that prohibition IS a success. Mr. Rid
dle himself has said it. Ipse dixit,
Autos Ipha, or what would you. But,
in spite of Mr. Riddle, and Mayor
Rolph, we are obliged to confess that
we fear that in certain Mission Street
establishments in San Francisco the
ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,
can be purchased in parts of the
state. We learn, too, that there is no
substitute for prohibition. Neither is
there a substitute for a desert. We
merely keep away.
We know, in spite of all our doubts,
that Mr. Riddle is an honest soul, who
obtains his information from books
endorsed by the Chicago Baptist As
sociation, and other absolutely un
biased societies, and further, we are
quite assured by this same young man
that sacramental wine, our sole dis
sipation, is quite all right, even though
we may like it.
Let Mr. Riddle not think that we
mean our criticism in an unkind way
—we admire his courage, and breath
lessly await some article of his on
witchcraft, or some kindred evil.
We remain, sir, most faithfully
yours,
A hired slave of the liquor trust.
The Editor, Sir:
I present herewith my reasons for
advocating the eighteenth amendment
and all laws and regulations pertain
ing .to it thereof:
1. The idea of the people having
any constitutional rights is all a gi
gantic myth, anyway, and therefore
the mere fact that the prohibiton
laws, and especially the now effective
Jones law, imposes on the supposed
rights of an American citizen is no
argument for the repeal of said laws.
2. The good ladies of the W.C.T.U.
and the Anno Domini minded cohorts
of the Anti-Saloon League certainly
should possess more feeling, venera
tion, and wish-well sentiments for
our gorgeous country than such in
supportable and contemptible wets as
Alfred B. Smith, Hon. N. Murray But
ler, Hon. H. L. Mencken, former Sena
tor Reed, and others of the booze
camp. And inasmuch as it is to be
logically assumed that the aforesaid
noble individuals of the sewing-circle
clubs and dry crusading groups must
know that what they advocate is best
for the good of the country, their
opinions and the laws which are now
in force as a result of their activities
should be respected and obeyed.
3. That the constitution does not
specifically prohibit the prohibition of
liquors, which is in itself sufficient
proof that the present prohibition is
not prohibited by the constitution.
4. That it is better for people to
drink one-fifth of bad gin than a gal
lon of good gin.
5. That we have cut down on im
ports due to, the fact that we no
longer buy nearly as much liquor
abroad. This is always a patriotic as
pect of trade.
C. That the direct $50,000,000.00 and
indirect additional millions that prohi
bition costs us yearly is nothing to a
wealthy country like this. It amounts,
roughly, to about $1 per capita, and
ten times this is saved in doctor's bills

i Editor, Campus Opinion
j Dear Sir:
In today's edition of the Daily I
{notice an almost vituperative article,
| which condemns the attitude of a cer
tain Mr. Riddle. Instead of inciting
! me to manslaughter, the gentleman
j signing himself "A Liberal" gives in
! ducement to a feeling of pity in my
humble breast. With an out and out
disregard of the purpose behind the ;
j column known as "Campus Opinion,"
Mr. Liberal does everything but give
his opinion. But, without the presump
tion of the least authority but his !
own, he deliberately destroys Mr. j
Riddle's effort with the barrage of
what I strongly suspect to be his pet I
grievances. The admission of "A Lib- j
eral," that it is futile to argue with a
"prejudiced, sometimes stupid" per
son, denies me the right to argue with
him. Nevertheless, I would like to
point out clearly as may be pos
sible, the errors that Mr. Liberal falls
into.
First, few liberals would confess to 1
a desire for homicide after a careful
i perusal of Mr. Riddle's article.
Second, there is no constructive
suggestion in place of Mr. Riddle's.
Third, there are no facts for which
our "Liberal" has the least vestiges
of proof. As my proof for that last
I quote directly from the "liberal's"
article. He says, "As a matter of fact,
Mr. Riddle, we probably would be just
as prosperous a country today wlieth-1
er we had prohibition or not." Then ;
right in the next lines he questions |
Mr. Riddle's authority in regard to
Canadian statistics in the following;
manner. "Are these statistics un
biased and official?" —then goes on
to insinuate (the. right word) that
there is material regarding govern
ment regulation in Sweden that would j
disprove Mr. Riddle's statements.
Fourth, the claim is made that the j
"drys" are in the minority. If the ;
wets are a majority why is not the !
18th amendment repealed? Probably
Mr. Liberal is laboring under the hal
lucination that Mr. A1 Smith is the
President of the United States.
Fifth, "A Liberal" claims that "one
of ihe most damning indictments of
the 18th Amendment and the Volstead
Act" is, that the rich can get the
liquor, while the poor cannot, which
is, he maintains, undemocratic. If he
were a philosopher he would reason |
that the rich were in an unenviable i
position because they could sin so
much easier than the poor man. But
I fear that philosophy plays a minor
part in his life.
As far as the 18th Amendment may
be undemocratic it does rfot alter the
fact that no one law is considered
democratic by all the people. And
speaking of democracy, I wonder if
Mr. Liberal can point out where the
courts have convicted in five (5) cases j
interests of a million dollars or more, j
I Is not that undemocratic? Is not that j
class legislation in the same sense j
I that you point it out so inaccurately j
in your article?
Now for some points of my own. |
Does the fact that some of our sena- j
tors break the law make that law a i
bondage? If a judge is convicted of
speeding would it be logical to expect ;
that the public would rise against I
that law condemning speeding? Not !
likely. It should be remembered that j
senators are as human as the rest
of us.
The fundamental problem at the (
bottom of the 18th Amendment is j
this: Those people who drink but vote j
dry do so for some reason. Either
there is the fear that the saloon will
come back, or that the legalized sale [
of liquor will result in the loss of j
prosperity to business interests. Mr. j
Ford, and many other prominent busi- j
ness men, have stated that prosperity ,
is due to prohibition. It is hard to
imagine our tremendous savings ac- j
counts without prohibition.
In England a short time ago one of
ihe biggest sources of revenue was a
liquor tax. Imagine a government I
practically running on the degrada
tion of its people.
However, I lind it hard to believe j
that if the majority of people wanted j
liquor they would not want to get it
legally. There has been a great
amount of importance attached to the j
theory that the "bootleggers" want |
prohibition so that they can continue j
to make money. No facts being forth-1
coming relevant to the number of
"bootleggers and hijackers" I am con
strained to believe that they are not
numerous or powerful enough to sway
public sentiment or the ballot.
To those who believe that conditions j
are worse now than before prohibition
notice this. In San Francisco in 1916
there were saloons averaging three
to four in number on all the corners
of the streets of Market, Mission,
Howard, Folsom, and streets inter
secting them. Compare that picture I
with the one that greets the visitor j
today. Of course there is the reply i
that there are speakeasies in their
places but no official proof.
In regard to the article appearing
iu the Daily on Monday, written by
Mr. Templeton Peck, I find some in
consistency regarding the relntlon of
crime to prohibition. There is no proof

forthcoming which will be able to
separate the influences of the World
War on crime from those which Mr.
Peck says are attributable to prohibi
tion.
Mr. Peck has forgotten that a stu
dent who drinks thereby admits the
moral wrong of prohibition from his
viewpoint. Theoretically he may ad
mit its virtue at one and the same
time.
1 conclude with some lines from
Mr. Peck's article slightly transposed
to include my opinion. They are: I
believe that the findings of the com
mission appointed by President Hoo
ver will eventually convince the ma
jority of those on the fence, that pro
hibition has more virtues than vices,
and that unbiased enforcement of
laws relating to it will bring us to
the desired end —respect for all law,
properly conceived.
—Herbert A. Jones.
The Editor, Sir:
Such display of public indecency as
was perpetrated in today's election
with regard to Prohibition, calls for
strenuous protest from one of us who
still cherish morality, and heaven
knows there are few enough of us left.
In the lower right-hand corner of
the ballot on the Prohibition issue
was the question: SEX:
When a group of officers, chosen to
represent the student body, inquire
into popular opinion on the Prohibi
tion question, well and good; but
when these same officers openly, pub
licly. and in brazen English inquire
into a person's sex, that is carrying
curiosity too far. Is nothing sacred?
I am writing this as a sort of sequel
to Mr. Sturgis Riddle's essays on mor
ality, since Mr. Riddle was unable to
deal with the subject in the meager
space allotted to his work on your
editorial page during the past few
days. It is written as an aid to Mr.
Riddle's campaign, because no stone
should be left unturned until immor
ality is once anu forever driven from
our mongst! —Crusader.
The Editor, Sir:
As this morning's paper shows us,
the Knight of the Cross is riding ram
pant once more, waving the banner
of the late lamented Carrie Nation,
and shouting the battleery of freedom
—ireedom, that is, for the Anti-Saloon
League, but alas, Sir, Ave must con
fess that never, never before did so
concentrated a mass of tripe ever
strike our poor weak eyes. We were
deeply touched on reading how our
country has led the world in the abo
lition of slavery, the emancipation of
women, and prohibition; we had, how
ever, our doubts, which seem to be
substantiated by reputable historians,
and we even have heard that a certain
Mohammed thought of prohibition
long ago, but of course he was not
an Episcopalian, and perhaps should
not be counted.
Moreover, we were pleased to learn
that prohibition IS a success. Mr. Rid
dle himself has said it. Ipse dixit,
Autos Ipha, or what would you. But,
in spite of Mr. Riddle, and Mayor
Rolph, we are obliged to confess that
we fear that in certain Mission Street
establishments in San Francisco the
ancient comrade of the lowly pretzel
is still served with all its pristine
foam. Other beverages too, it is said,
can be purchased in parts of the
state. We learn, too, that there is no
substitute for prohibition. Neither is
there a substitute for a desert. We
merely keep away.
We know, in spite of all our doubts,
that Mr. Riddle is an honest soul, who
obtains his information from books
endorsed by the Chicago Baptist As
sociation, and other absolutely un
biased societies, and further, we are
quite assured by this same young man
that sacramental wine, our sole dis
sipation, is quite all right, even though
we may like it.
Let Mr. Riddle not think that we
mean our criticism in an unkind way
—we admire his courage, and breath
lessly await some article of his on
witchcraft, or some kindred evil.
We remain, sir, most faithfully
yours,
A hired slave of the liquor trust.
The Editor, Sir:
I present herewith my reasons for
advocating the eighteenth amendment
and all laws and regulations pertain
ing .to it thereof:
1. The idea of the people having
any constitutional rights is all a gi
gantic myth, anyway, and therefore
the mere fact that the prohibiton
laws, and especially the now effective
Jones law, imposes on the supposed
rights of an American citizen is no
argument for the repeal of said laws.
2. The good ladies of the W.C.T.U.
and the Anno Domini minded cohorts
of the Anti-Saloon League certainly
should possess more feeling, venera
tion, and wish-well sentiments for
our gorgeous country than such in
supportable and contemptible wets as
Alfred B. Smith, Hon. N. Murray But
ler, Hon. H. L. Mencken, former Sena
tor Reed, and others of the booze
camp. And inasmuch as it is to be
logically assumed that the aforesaid
noble individuals of the sewing-circle
clubs and dry crusading groups must
know that what they advocate is best
for the good of the country, their
opinions and the laws which are now
in force as a result of their activities
should be respected and obeyed.
3. That the constitution does not
specifically prohibit the prohibition of
liquors, which is in itself sufficient
proof that the present prohibition is
not prohibited by the constitution.
4. That it is better for people to
drink one-fifth of bad gin than a gal
lon of good gin.
5. That we have cut down on im
ports due to, the fact that we no
longer buy nearly as much liquor
abroad. This is always a patriotic as
pect of trade.
C. That the direct $50,000,000.00 and
indirect additional millions that prohi
bition costs us yearly is nothing to a
wealthy country like this. It amounts,
roughly, to about $1 per capita, and
ten times this is saved in doctor's bills
alone due to decreasing ailments
traced to lower consumption of liquor.
7. That Hon. William Randolph
Hearst is at present advocating,
through his newspapers, a repeal and
ratification of the prohibition laws,
and this, alone, due to the former
antics of the well-known publisher, is
enough to discredit the idea. It is to
be forgotten that the identical W. R.
Hearst, Esq., was instrumental in pre
senting us with the 1928 fiasco, which
is today venerated as a patriotic
achievement. However . . .
8. That although Christ, according
to Biblical evidence, is known to
have quaffed wine, he, if living today,
would frown upon the practice, due
to changed moral and economic con
ditions. A multitude of ministers are
authority for this assertion. To men
tion one, Hon. John Roach Straton,
Esq.
9. That once liquors are completely
abolished, the anti-vice forces of the
country can set out and campaign
against the awful nicotine weed,
which, in the form of cigarettes, is
now destroying the health and morals
of the nation. If prohibition is accom
plished these crusaders will have a
substantial background to work on.
10. That I don't drink. And if I can
get along without it, there is no rea
son why everyone else cannot.
11. That as far as the increase (ac
cusation of the wets) in drinking
among the younger sets is concerned,
this may be said: first,- that it is
greatly exaggerated; second, that if
young people are as stupid as to take
a chance with poison gin it's their
own lookout and it is better if such
law-breaking people are sent where
they can do no more earthly harm.
12. That the government will prob
ably soon flood the market with poi
son liquors simply to make people
beware of the bootlegger. If the gov
ernment has the power to allow a
policeman to kill it certainly should
be delegated the authority to poison
as much liquor as it deems necessary
to enforce a law of far greater moral
and social benefit than, say, that
against robbery.
13. That the criticism of the prohi
bition laws is not fair. It (prohibition)
has not been given a fair trial. After
about fifty years it will begin to oper
ate smoothly and really be effective.
"Rome was not built in a day." And
the river of booze that has been flood
ing mankind for the last two thousand
years cannot be diverted from its
course in merely a few years.
14. That all the political aspects of
the question are not as important as
the newspapers would make them.
The "I'm Alone" affair, while it in
volved us with three major powers,
can be disregarded. We are too strong
a nation for the countries implicated
in the above-mentioned incident to do
anything of consequence about it.
lf>. That the huge wave of bribery
in politics and general disregard for
law is not, as has been charged, due
to prohibition, but can be traced to
the after-war spirit.
16. Then when a law Is on the
statutes of the country it must be
enforced at all costs and with no re
straining influences.
