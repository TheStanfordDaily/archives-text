### 
WASHINGTON, April 16. (£>)— In
line with (he views of President Hoo
ver to limit the legislative scope of
the special session, the House today
organized only three of its nearly
half hundred committees.
The committees created were agri
culture, to handle farm legislation,
ways and means, which is drafting a
tariff revision bill, and the rules com
mittee to determine legislative pro
cedure.
It is the plan of House leaders to
defer organization of all other com
mittees. In this way the leaders will
be able to block all legislation except
that originating in the ways and
means and agriculture groups and
that which is sent to the House from
the Senate.
