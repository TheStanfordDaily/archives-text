A triple by Reed and an overthrow at
the home plate in the sixth inning broke
up a pitchers' battle between El Toro
and Beta Theta Pi yesterday afternoon
on the mural diamond. The Betas got
off to an early lead but were unable to
hold it, when the Toro batters started
hitting.
Yard Loom is pitched another good
game for the winners, and struck out
fourteen batters in the last six innings.
The fraternity players were able to gar
ner only two infield hits, while El Toro
pounded *out eight safe blows.
Slugging two Theta Delt pitchers all
over the diamond for a total of nineteen
hits, Phi Sigma Kappa walked off with
its second straight intramural win. The
winners knocked Miller, tall left bander,
out of the box in the second frame dur
ing a hitfest and continued their hard
hitting attack on Hartley.
The game started out fast, Phi Sigma
Kappa turning in a neat double play in
the first inning. But from then on the
contest developed into a free hitting af
fair. Four home runs were made during
the five innings of play, each team get
ting two.
After piling up a four-run lead, Chi
Psi weakened in the last three innings of
its game with Sequoia 1 and lost out by
a seven run margin. Spaght started on
the mound for the hall outfit, but was
replaced by Trimmingham, who though
hit hard was effective in the pinches. The
game was slowed up with loose fielding
by both teams.
Phi Delta Theta won its game on a
forfeit, as only five of the Alpha Delt
players put in an appearance.
Tomorrow's schedule is as follows:
Delta Chi vs. Sigma Chi on diamond 2,

Slugging two Theta Delt pitchers all
over the diamond for a total of nineteen
hits, Phi Sigma Kappa walked off with
its second straight intramural win. The
winners knocked Miller, tall left bander,
out of the box in the second frame dur
ing a hitfest and continued their hard
hitting attack on Hartley.
The game started out fast, Phi Sigma
Kappa turning in a neat double play in
the first inning. But from then on the
contest developed into a free hitting af
fair. Four home runs were made during
the five innings of play, each team get
ting two.
After piling up a four-run lead, Chi
Psi weakened in the last three innings of
its game with Sequoia 1 and lost out by
a seven run margin. Spaght started on
the mound for the hall outfit, but was
replaced by Trimmingham, who though
hit hard was effective in the pinches. The
game was slowed up with loose fielding
by both teams.
Phi Delta Theta won its game on a
forfeit, as only five of the Alpha Delt
players put in an appearance.
