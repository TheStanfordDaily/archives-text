# FRESHMAN NINE WILL PLAY OFF CUB SERIES AT CALIFORNIA TODAY
## Teams Enter Contest With Honors Split in Early Season Contests 
### 
With an even chance of winning
the 1929 Little Series, Stanford's
freshman baseball team will meet the
University of California Cubs this
afternoon at 3:15 on the Berkeley
diamond in the deciding contest. The
Card babes captured the first game
12-7, and the Blue and Gold yearlings
took the second 9-2.
Both of the first two contests were
one-sided slug fests. In winning their
game, the Stanford frosli clouted out
20 hits to G for their opponents, and
in the second game California con
nected for 14 safeties against 7 for
the Cards. Nix, the only competent
chucker left on Brick Mitchell's squad
feince Lefty Mailho was declared in
eligible, pitched both contests for the
Bears. He will undoubtedly start to
morrow.
Coach Husky Hunt has not definite
ly decided who he will pitch against
Nix, but he will probably start Mc-
Lean. With the club hitting behind
him, he should turn back the Cubs
again.
Dixon, who has been Hunt's choice
to work behind the plate in the two
previous games, will probably get the
first call again, but Evans will get a
chance if he is off color. Marks will
play at first, Barsumian at second,
Kelly at third, and White at short
stop. This combination has been play
ing together all season and are all
smooth, clean fielders. Captain Rin
tala, Stine, and Fox will work in the
outfield.
