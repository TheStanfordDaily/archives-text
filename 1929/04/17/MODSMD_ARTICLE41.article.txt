# SPORTS OF 1929
## Alex The Great 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Behold the Methuselah of the Na
tional League, Granddaddy of all older
circuit hurlers, Poppa of the pitchers,
and the most colorful old bozo who
ever cocked his hat over one eye and
goosestepped back to the dugout, after
striking out. And, while we're on the
subject of striking out, Grover Cleve
land Alexander has struck out 2,145
batters himself, which makes Dazzy
Vance's 1,338 look rather small in
comparison. But then, the Dazzler has
had only seven major league seasons.
Walter Johnson, in case you're inter
ested, whiffed 3,497 batters in his
twenty-one years with the Senators, a
record that even Poppa Alex will not
touch in three more seasons.
The baseball career of Alexander
is too well known to need further
comment. Every fan is familiar with
his long and honorable service rec
ord, seven seasons with the Phillies j
and eight with the Cubs; with his re
lease to the Cards on waivers in June,
1926 (because he and manager Joe
McCarthy couldn't agree on theories
of training); with how he got the
laugh on his former boss by getting !
into the world series three and a half j
months later, and almost single
handed defeated the Yankees in one
of the most dramatic chapters in base- |
ball's history; with his twenty-one .
victories the next year; and with his

I anti-climax in 1928, when he failed
| miserably in his second world series
; and lasted only five innings against
the Yankees, who had eaten out of hi.s
I hand two years before.
Old Alexis nearing the end of the
I trail. And no one will ever take his
place when he is gone.
