# SEQUOIA SWIMMERS MEET WATERLOO AS BOAT TURNS TURTLE

### 
Sequoia's reputation as an abode
of aquatic stars, received a sad blow
yesterday afternoon when a canoe con
taining two Sequoia men capsized on j
Lagunita. Because Sequoia Club guar
antees that all men who take out its J
canoes have passed the required teat, |
the guards did not consider it neces- j
sary to go to the aid of the men who
received an ovation from the crowd at
the boat house.
One of the occupants clung to the
overturned canoe, while the other, [
with a great show of daring, struck j
Tjut for shore. Less than half way in '
he appeared in difficulty so a life- J
guard started to his aid.
But about five yards distant, one j
of the oar-locks came loose, and he !
lost the oar. He dived overboard to j
rescue the unfortunate Sequoian, now i
sinking for the severalth time.
Upon questioning him, it was j
learned that since he could not swim
the length of the tank, he had never
bothered to take the swimming test.
Bright yellow baseballs are now on '
the market, to add to the red tennis j
balls and colored golf balls.
