# Robert Hume Awarded Joffre Medal In 36th Annual Stanford-U.C. Debate
## Stanford Speakers Awarded Debate Medal for Third Consecutive Year 
### 
Robert Hume won the Joffre debate
last night in the Assembly Hall for
the thirty-sija.li annual award of the
"Medaille Joffre" and held the medal
at Stanford for the third consecutive
year. California debaters have won
the award only once since 1921.
"Resolved, That the Briand-Kellogg
Pact Insures Universal Peace," was
the topic selected two hours before
the contest by Maurice Heilmann,
French Consul General at San Fran
cisco, for the annual Stanford-Califor
nia debating classic.
Taking the negative side of the
question, Hume stated that merely
affirming the ideal of peace is not
new and that the repetition of an
ideal has had no effect in historical
fact.
"Unlike the Covenant of the League
of Nations, the Pact presents no
means of settling disputes which are
sure to arise," he said.
John Reynolds and Stanley Breyer
of California were Hume's colleagues
on the negative side of the case, while
Henry Harris and Robert McClintock
of Stanford worked with Lester Stiner
of California in presenting the af
firmative case.
Robert McClintock of Stanford was
given second place in the judge's rat
ing and Henry Harris was awarded
fourth. Stanley Breyer of the Cali
fornia squad placed third.
Professor Ralph H. Lutz of the His
tory department here presided at the
meeting. Judges of the contest were
T. D. Boardman of San Francisco,
Paige Monteagle, San Francisco at
torney, and Professor W. H. Poytress,
head of the Department of Social Sci
ences at San Jose State College.
McClintock, in the speech which
gave him second place, presented the
humanitarian aspects of the Pacts in
his constructive speech. He main
tained that Past supplemented and
correlated the Locarno Agreements
and the League of Nations, vocalizing
the public opinion of the world for
peace.
Breyer insisted that the basis of
war is found in economic struggles
and that renunciation of war as an
instrument of national policy will not
insure peace.
More than 600 people were in the
audience.
