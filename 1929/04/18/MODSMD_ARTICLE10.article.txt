# CARD DEBATE TEAM OFFERED OXFORD MEET
## Debate Coach Emerson Gets Offer to Meet English Speakers This Year 
### 
In a letter received by Professor
James G. Emerson, debate coach, the
University of Oxford has made an
offer to debate a Stanford team here
sometime during the autumn quarter
of this year.
Final acceptance of the Oxford of
ft r awaits only a decision of the De
bate Council to be made at a meeting
planned for Tuesday of next week.
No mention of possible questions for
discussion was made in the communi
cation and further negotiations will
be carried out after the Debate Coun
cil's verdict is rendered next week.
"I believe that the acceptance of
the Oxford proposition is assured, al
though financial problems will have to
be solved," said Steve Halstead, de
bate manager, last night in comment
ing on the offer.
Oxford has not sent a team to Stan
ford since 1925, when the English
men appeared here in a debate on
prohibition. Public interest in the
British debaters, who employed a
sparkling, jovial style, was demon
strated at the time when more than a
thousand people thronged to the As
sembly Hall for the contest.
M. J. Mac Donald, son of Ramsay
Mac Donald, English political leader,
J. D. Woodruff, and M. C. Hollis pre
sented the affirmative side of the
question, "Resolved, That this House
is opposed to the principle of prohibi
tion." Stanley Weigel, Robert Lewis,
and Robert Littler opposed the reso
lution for Stanford.
