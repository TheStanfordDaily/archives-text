# MEMORIAL CHURCH IN RUINS AS 1906 QUAKE RAVAGED CAMPUS, PENINSULA
## 
### 
Only the weather-beaten ruins of a
j destroyed library remain today as
j crumbling evidence of a catastrophe
! which twenty-three years ago this
morning brought ruin and destruction
to Stanford University.
Without any warning, the earth be
gan to tremble at 5:07 a.m. and after
a series of jolts the quake climaxed
1 in a twist which caused $2,800,000 in
property damage and resulted in the
death of two persons.
The greatest individual damage oc
curred when the Memorial Church
was practically totally destroyed. The
mosaic front, portraying the Sermon
on the Mount, was hurled to the pave
ment of the inner quadrangle and de
molished.
Nearly two thousand sleeping stu
dents were awakened by the tremors.
! Old Roble Hall, now Sequoia, was se
' verely shaken and four women crashed
from the top floor to the basement.
No one was injured in Sequoia.
Three hundred panic-stricken men
in Encina Hall, in a mad dash to
safety, found their way blocked by
barred doors. It was several moments
before the impediments were splin
tered by the mob. Never since have
the doors of Encina been locked at
night to belated "roughs."
Two tall chimneys at Encina cradl
ed earthwards, one smashing its way

into the heart of the dormitory. A
sophomore was caught in the debris
and killed.
Along the Row, the Chi Psi house
suffered the greatest injuries. It was
torn ten feet off of its foundations
and the floors were ripped up.
One side of the Pi Beta Phi house
was torn down but the foundations
were not damaged. Sigma Alpha Ep
silon suffered $500 damage to pillars
supporting the front of the house and
i lost a handsome collection of steins
valued at $200.
By nine o'clock on the morning of
tTie quake a student militia was or
ganized to guard the ruins and pre
vent looting. The entire inner quad
was roped off and constant vigilance
maintained throughout day and night.
The University was immediately
closed for the remainder of the quar
ter. Students with recommending
grades received credits for their aca
demic work; while those with precari
| oiis classroom standing were required
| to take an examination. Transporta
tion facilities throughout northern
1 California were paralyzed.
A committee of faculty engineers
, immediately examined all buildings,
condemning those unsafe. Reconstruc
! tion work commenced immediately
under the leadership of President
I David Starr Jordan.
