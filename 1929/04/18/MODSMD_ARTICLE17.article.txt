# STANFORD TRUCK MEN SCHEDULED TO BEAT BEARS
## Mile and Two-Mile Are Only Races California Pointed To Win in Saturday's Meet Hec Dyer and Spencer Bisbee To Fight for First Places In Century and 220 Races 
### Frank Whiteley 
Captain Ross Nichols and Fred
Zombro were taken to the hos
pital yesterday, the former for a
slight nasal operation and the
latter with a cold. Both will be
able to compete Saturday.

It is a foregone conclusion that
Stanford's two-time 1.C.4-A. champions
will turn back the 1929 threat of the
Golden Bear tracksters by an over
whelming score here next Saturday,
but whether or not the final total will
exceed the Big Meet scoring record
of 91-35 made by California in 1893 is
questionable. The Cards chalked up
90 2-3 points last year to come within
a fraction of topping the long-existing
mark.
The field events, as outlined yes
terday, are pretty much all Stanford,
and it is possible that the Cardinal
athletes will score as many as 40
out of the 54 points in the field. The
Bears will make a little stronger
showing in the eight track events,
but even here they are not likely to
score more than 20 points.
The mile and two-mile will be the
big California events. Red Mossman,
the little Bear sophomore who won
the eight-lap event against Washing
ton in the splendid time of 9:34 3-5,
is conceded a first over Bob Brown
of Stanford. Griset of Stanford should
take third.
Carter, Bear mile victor in the Big
Meet last year, is almost a cinch to
repeat his 1928 win here Saturday.
Templeton has not announced yet
whether he will use Alex McKinnon
in the mile, the half-mile, or both. If
Alex runs in the mile, he will give
Carter a good fight for first place.
Johnny Parker of the Cards is fa
vored to place third ahead of Cherry
of California.
Coach Walt Christie has been pray
ing for a first-class sprinter for some
lime, but his prayers don't seem to
have been answered, this year at least.
Bisbee's 9 4-5 century last week looks
mighty nice on paper, but those who
saw the race say that he jumped the
gun by several feet and was aided by
the wind. Whether this was the case
or not, he will have to do at least,
that well or better to finish ahead of
Ilec Dyer, the Card sophomore flash.
Accordingly, Dyer is favored for first
in the hundred with Bisbee second
and Lauritzen or McDermott third. In
the furlong Dyer is again favored to
win with Lauritzen in second place
and Bisbee in third.
Pogolotti, Bear hurdler, is slowly
getting into shape after weeks of in
activity due to an injured ankle and
may be able to turn in some credit
able performances Saturday. However,
it is not likely that he will be able
to break up the combination of Nich
ols, Edmonds, and Smith in the high
barriers and Fklmonds and Smith in
the lows. Pogolotti will probably be
good for a third in the latter.
Johnny Morrison was a much-im
proved runner against the All-Stars
last week and, accordingly, is the fa
forite to take the quarter-mile. It
will be a fight for the other places
between Clark of California and Sliove
and Syer of Stanford with the first
two favored to finish second and
third.
Chase, Bear half-miler, failed to
come up to predictions in the Wash- :
ington meet, only placing third, and !
should not take more than a single )
point. That is, if McKinnon is in the
race. McKinnon should take first and j
his teammate, Neikirk, second.
Stanford's relay team of Shove,
Syer, McDerinott, and Mm'rison should
win the relay.
There is a saying that "breaks will
never cease" in track, and for this
reason it is usually unwise to try and
dope out a meet ahead of time. Not
withstanding, the following is offered
concerning the nine track events:

According to the findings of the \
physical education department of La- j
fayette College, Easton, Pa., the men j
who are under weight are the best i
students there.
Captain Ross Nichols and Fred
Zombro were taken to the hos
pital yesterday, the former for a
slight nasal operation and the
latter with a cold. Both will be
able to compete Saturday.

It is a foregone conclusion that
Stanford's two-time 1.C.4-A. champions
will turn back the 1929 threat of the
Golden Bear tracksters by an over
whelming score here next Saturday,
but whether or not the final total will
exceed the Big Meet scoring record
of 91-35 made by California in 1893 is
questionable. The Cards chalked up
90 2-3 points last year to come within
a fraction of topping the long-existing
mark.
The field events, as outlined yes
terday, are pretty much all Stanford,
and it is possible that the Cardinal
athletes will score as many as 40
out of the 54 points in the field. The
Bears will make a little stronger
showing in the eight track events,
but even here they are not likely to
score more than 20 points.
The mile and two-mile will be the
big California events. Red Mossman,
the little Bear sophomore who won
the eight-lap event against Washing
ton in the splendid time of 9:34 3-5,
is conceded a first over Bob Brown
of Stanford. Griset of Stanford should
take third.
Carter, Bear mile victor in the Big
Meet last year, is almost a cinch to
repeat his 1928 win here Saturday.
Templeton has not announced yet
whether he will use Alex McKinnon
in the mile, the half-mile, or both. If
Alex runs in the mile, he will give
Carter a good fight for first place.
Johnny Parker of the Cards is fa
vored to place third ahead of Cherry
of California.
Coach Walt Christie has been pray
ing for a first-class sprinter for some
lime, but his prayers don't seem to
have been answered, this year at least.
Bisbee's 9 4-5 century last week looks
mighty nice on paper, but those who
saw the race say that he jumped the
gun by several feet and was aided by
the wind. Whether this was the case
or not, he will have to do at least,
that well or better to finish ahead of
Ilec Dyer, the Card sophomore flash.
Accordingly, Dyer is favored for first
in the hundred with Bisbee second
and Lauritzen or McDermott third. In
the furlong Dyer is again favored to
win with Lauritzen in second place
and Bisbee in third.
Pogolotti, Bear hurdler, is slowly
getting into shape after weeks of in
activity due to an injured ankle and
may be able to turn in some credit
able performances Saturday. However,
it is not likely that he will be able
to break up the combination of Nich
ols, Edmonds, and Smith in the high
barriers and Fklmonds and Smith in
the lows. Pogolotti will probably be
good for a third in the latter.
Johnny Morrison was a much-im
proved runner against the All-Stars
last week and, accordingly, is the fa
forite to take the quarter-mile. It
will be a fight for the other places
between Clark of California and Sliove
and Syer of Stanford with the first
two favored to finish second and
third.
Chase, Bear half-miler, failed to
come up to predictions in the Wash- :
ington meet, only placing third, and !
should not take more than a single )
point. That is, if McKinnon is in the
race. McKinnon should take first and j
his teammate, Neikirk, second.

Syer, McDerinott, and Mm'rison should

Johnny Parker of the Cards is fa
vored to place third ahead of Cherry
of California.
Coach Walt Christie has been pray
ing for a first-class sprinter for some
lime, but his prayers don't seem to
have been answered, this year at least.
Bisbee's 9 4-5 century last week looks
mighty nice on paper, but those who
saw the race say that he jumped the
gun by several feet and was aided by
the wind. Whether this was the case
or not, he will have to do at least,
that well or better to finish ahead of
Ilec Dyer, the Card sophomore flash.
Accordingly, Dyer is favored for first
in the hundred with Bisbee second
and Lauritzen or McDermott third. In
the furlong Dyer is again favored to
win with Lauritzen in second place
and Bisbee in third.
Pogolotti, Bear hurdler, is slowly
getting into shape after weeks of in
activity due to an injured ankle and
may be able to turn in some credit
able performances Saturday. However,
it is not likely that he will be able
to break up the combination of Nich
ols, Edmonds, and Smith in the high
barriers and Fklmonds and Smith in
the lows. Pogolotti will probably be
good for a third in the latter.
Johnny Morrison was a much-im
proved runner against the All-Stars
last week and, accordingly, is the fa
forite to take the quarter-mile. It
will be a fight for the other places
between Clark of California and Sliove
and Syer of Stanford with the first
two favored to finish second and
third.
Chase, Bear half-miler, failed to
come up to predictions in the Wash- :
ington meet, only placing third, and !
should not take more than a single )
point. That is, if McKinnon is in the
race. McKinnon should take first and j
his teammate, Neikirk, second.
Stanford's relay team of Shove,
Syer, McDerinott, and Mm'rison should
win the relay.
There is a saying that "breaks will
never cease" in track, and for this

Captain Ross Nichols and Fred
Zombro were taken to the hos
pital yesterday, the former for a
slight nasal operation and the
latter with a cold. Both will be
able to compete Saturday.

It is a foregone conclusion that
Stanford's two-time 1.C.4-A. champions
will turn back the 1929 threat of the
Golden Bear tracksters by an over
whelming score here next Saturday,
but whether or not the final total will
exceed the Big Meet scoring record
of 91-35 made by California in 1893 is
questionable. The Cards chalked up
90 2-3 points last year to come within
a fraction of topping the long-existing
mark.
The field events, as outlined yes
terday, are pretty much all Stanford,
and it is possible that the Cardinal
athletes will score as many as 40
out of the 54 points in the field. The
Bears will make a little stronger
showing in the eight track events,
but even here they are not likely to
score more than 20 points.
The mile and two-mile will be the
big California events. Red Mossman,
the little Bear sophomore who won
the eight-lap event against Washing
ton in the splendid time of 9:34 3-5,
is conceded a first over Bob Brown
of Stanford. Griset of Stanford should
take third.
Carter, Bear mile victor in the Big
Meet last year, is almost a cinch to
repeat his 1928 win here Saturday.
Templeton has not announced yet
whether he will use Alex McKinnon
in the mile, the half-mile, or both. If
Alex runs in the mile, he will give
Carter a good fight for first place.
