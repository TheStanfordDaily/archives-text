# The 						Possible Oxford Debate
## 
### 
The good word has come that Stanford may have the pleasure and
honor of debating with the gentlemen from Oxford again next fall.
Those who heard the redoutable Oxonians harrangue the benefits of not
having Prohibition in their debate here in 1925 took new interest in
debating. For theirs was a style and a method of debate that made the
audience sit up and take notice.
At that time, Stanford, either very dry or extremely patriotic, voted
730 to 229 in favor of Prohibition. The vote was on the question, "Re
solved, That this house is opposed to the principle of Prohibition," and
not on the merits of the debate. That was the Oxonian method. The idea
was to present a thorough, fair consideration of the topic under discus
sion, and not lo carry on a verbal battle.
The Daily hopes that the Debate Council when it considers the matter
of holding the debate will strongly favor the proposition. Debating, it
has been said, is on the wane. Here is something to give it a boost.
Quoting the Daily Californian, "At present such entertainment as movies
and the radio give debating disastrous competition. Then, too, the thirst
for mere winning is becoming satiated." Provide lively topics, more lively
than some of recent date, conduct the debate with the Oxonian end in
view, that of consideration of the topic, and debating should take a rise in
public intereiK; again. Let the Oxford debate be held.
