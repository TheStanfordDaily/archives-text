# The 						Result of Work?
## 
### 
Failures and D's at Temple University are the result of students
majoring in work and minoring in education, according to John r>arr,
head of Industrial Service Bureau at that institution. Part-time employ
ment nets the average student some $50 a month which is half of the
average student's monthly expenses in the university. Mr. Barr in his
report recommends that freshmen do no outside work during their fresh
man year.
To this cause of failures and D's might be added the horde of students
majoring in extra-curricular activities, the several majoring in sheer
laziness, and that small few majoring in out and out stupidity, and you
have all the failures and D's of any university. Two-thirds of the Stan
ford student body does some sort of part-time work to assist in financing
its education. Approximately half the students going on probation were
students doing outside work. If these figures were to bear out the idea
that working students Hunk more than others, two-thirds of the Hunkers
would be working students.
The student who wants a college education bad enough to wash
dishes and scrub floors to get it is going to make the most of his studies.
It would l>e fine if all freshmen were able to attend university without
working, but how many of the worthwhile members of the student body
now and in the past would not be here were they prevented from working
during the first year? A goodly number. President Hoover among them.
