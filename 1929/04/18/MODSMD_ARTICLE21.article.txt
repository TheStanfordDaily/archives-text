After a deluge of college reports and questionnaires on the time-worn
subjects of "necking," "drinking," and "swearing" in which students de
clare complete disapprobation of such evils, it is a relief to find that one
group of students at Columbia has no argument with these so-called
college vices.
No matter how many statements arc made to the contrary by deans,
university presidents, or students, the fact still remains that such things
do exist not only in college circles but in any stratum of society. They
seem to l>e a part of any social order.
It is refreshing to find that there is a college group that has sufficient
intellectual honesty to recognize that fact.â€”Daily Californian.
