The Editor, Sir:
I should like to relieve myself of a
few opinions concerning prohibition,
which, thanks to the initiative of the
Daily, has assumed paramount im
portance in these parts at the mo
ment.
It seems that each exponent of pro
hibition invariably brings up the
time-worn example of the open saloon
as an epitome of all that was horrible
and corrupt in days gone by, as if to
imply that this condition would of
necessity follow, should the 18th
Amendment be repealed and the open
saloon be re-established. This, I think
is absurd, and a slap in the face of
present-day thinking. It was inevitable
that the saloon should be pushed into
the gutter, because of the constant
flow of blood and thunder from the
pulpit, which, in those days, held the
upper hand, so to speak. Ministers
and evangelists shouted to their con
gregations the Vituperation of Drink
ing and the abomination of the saloon,
until no respectable person would
permit himself to be seen there. As a
result, the saloons became the hang
out of bums, drug addicts, and other
dregs of society, and thus they (the
saloons) remained until the event of
prohibition. And to this day people
shrink from the word "saloon." This
attitude is not the proper, not to say
fair, one to carry over into present
argumentation for prohibition, be
cause it does not necessarily follow
(and I dare say it would not) that
the old order of things would be re
verted to, should the saloon again be
opened (as I hope it will be, but with
a few restrictions which I will not go
into here, except for one, and that is
the changing of its name to some
thing less repulsive.
When the 18th Amendment is re
pealed and the American people are
made to adopt the attitude of the
citizens of other countries, notably
France and England, towards alco
holic drinks, then, and then only, will
the strong drink situation be in a
condition satisfactory to the greatest
number of people.
This situation may appear some
what Utopian in view of the notori
ous American temperament, but I see
no reason why it could not come to
pass if a few enlightened principles
were impressed upon the people by
the proper group of individuals, in the
proper manner.
It seems to me that the most fruit
ful results lie in the reverse direction
from that which is now being pursued.
That is to say, we would approach
more nearly the desired results by
permitting the sale of alcoholic drinks,
and then concentrating our efforts to
correct those evils which arise as a
consequence thereof, rather than try
ing to force prohibition down the
throats of all of the people; a large
percentage of whom object; and fur
thermore, they will continue to object
so long as we have before us the
enviable freedom which other nations
accord their subjects on such mat
ters, and the agreeable circumstances
which have been achieved as a result.
Most sincerely,
William Queen.

The Editor, Sir:
I have read with interest the several
articles published of late in the Daily
regarding the matter of prohibition,
and I would like to add my opinion,
if I may.
I agree with "A Liberal" when he
suggests that we must avoid "hiding
the issue behind a glorious hoo-rah of
spread eagle, jingoistic patriotism."
We, as intelligent American citizens,
should strive to find the truth of the
matter regardless of our own preju
dices. If all America could sit sanely
and seriously before actual facts,
weigh them, consider this advantage
against that, and finally arrive at
seme approximation of the truth, how
happy we would be. Can we reach the
truth in this situation that way?
Both the "drys" and the "wets"
have figures and statistics by the
score to back up their own views.
Where do they get their facts? The
Hearst newspapers can not be relied
upon. They are soaking "wet"! Let us
be careful in accepting such news too
hastily.
I, too, have my own pet prejudice
regarding this subject, and, regard
less of figures, I feel that I can justify
my position. I was reared in a small
community that boasted of its large
number of saloons. It was unsafe for
a lady to go out of her home alone
after men were free from their work,
and a drunk man lying in the corner
of a building was no uncommon sight.
While walking up the street in the
evening, one never knew at what mo
ment a half-crazy man would come
reeling out of a saloon. Frankly, I
was "fed up" on that sort of thing.
You ask, "la prohibition a success?"
If by "success" you mean "enforced,"
we all know it is not, but I ain able
to go into that same community now
and feel perfectly safe to go about
my business when and where 1 please.
During the past ten years I have seen
hardly more than a dozen intoxicated
men. During the ten yenrs before that
I saw literally hundreds. "Is prohibi

tion a success?" If you mean, "Are
conditions better now than before
prohibition?" I say, by all means, yes!
"Or," someone says, "we don't want
saloons, either. We want light wines
and beers, or modification, or to do
away with the Volstead Act. We want
liberty!" All of which may sound well
enough, but it is impossible. We must
have a "wet" America or a "dry"
America. There can be no intermedi
ate stage. It is for us to take our
choice. I prefer to choose prohibition,
in spite of its obvious defects and
non-enforcement.
Rather than talk of annulling what
we have spent over fifty years in ac
complishing, let us talk of how we
can most effectively put into opera
tion our present laws. I hope and be
lieve that another generation will see
a "dry" America —"dry" both in theory
and practice.
And to Mr. Riddle I would add,
"More power to you!"

The Editor, Sir:
I have been aroused from my
phlegmatic slumbers by the crude
orgasms of naive piety with their ac
companying outbursts of dogmatic
sophistry which have appeared re
cently in Campus Opinion. It indeed
seems appropriate in view of the
imaginary analyses and logic dis
played that the discourse upon the
subject of the XVIII Amendment be
shifted to a level which makes a
strong pretense, at least, of driving at
the fundamental principles of moral
control and enlightenment. For this
reason I present this short article,
hoping that you may see fit to publish
it.
From the pulpit of the Rev. John
Itoach Stratton or the most sacred
shrine of the Southern Methodists,
from the lips of those whose glisten
ing eyes bespeak a state of mental
hysteria, one might expect to hear
such arguments as have found their
way to print in recent editions of the
Daily concerning the strict enforce
ment of prohibition. They should
never have been written, but with
awful solemnity have been shouted,
then whispered, by wild-eyed fanatics
to the crying of the winds upon some
lonely peak. Such stuff and nonsense,
such medieval crudity has, I hope,
never before found voice in this Uni
versity whose boast is enlightenment.
It is a reproach to the ideals upon
which it was founded. The arguments
which have been advanced for the
upholding of present prohibitive legis
lation are but the excrescence of
minds not yet out of high school,
doped and excited by the narcotic of
pscudo-intellectualism. My intent is to
lay bare some of the basic and in
escapable aspects of the problem as a
moral issue before a society of peo
ples.

There is a tendency upon the part
of the American people to shift their
burdens of moral responsibility to
other shoulders if they can, some
times to God, sometimes to the
church, and as in this case upon the
State. It is oddly reminiscent of the
ancient Jewish custom of leading the
scapegoat to the altar. Unfortunately
for the equanimity and peace of mind
of the American citizen, the power of
moral reform, by its very nature, can
not be delegated to the State; it is
a matter of individual determination
and nothing can defeat the end of
moral progress more completely nor
thoroughly than the supposition that
correction and uplift may be done
wholesale by legislation, democratic
or undemocratic.
Laws, as the formal determinations
of activity can never exert their con
trol unless that of which they are the
form coincides with it. Law does not
make things right in and of itself;
people must be law-abiding through
constraint and not restraint. Strictly
intelligent and moral choice is never
determined by the immediate conse
quences, and these are what are pre
pared in a restraining law. A law of
restraint can never last longer than
the tyrannical power which enforces
it; laws of restraint are hopelessly
inadequate expect to feed the vanity
of those whose momentary accession
of power permits them temporarily to
superimpose their will.
The only hope for what we are
pleased to call moral progress is in
the enlightenment of the individual,
and no number of variety of laws
which exceeds this can have any sta
bility or meaning. The cry for any
other kind of morality is a vacuous,
chimerical, and vain orgasm of naive
piety. Whether we seek temperance
or abstinence, and certainly the for
mer is more admirable by far, we can
only hope to do so by the develop
ment of moral determination and de
sire in each member of our society.
Sincerely, Paul L. Harwood.
