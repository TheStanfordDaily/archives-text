# RACQUET STARS OF STANFORD, U. OF C. TO MEET SATURDAY
## Cardinals Have Won Annual Matches Since 1925 by One-Sided Scores 
### 
As a part of the University Day fes
tivities next Saturday, Stanford's var
sity tennis team will take on the
racquet wielders of the University of
California at 10 a.m. on the varsity
courts. The annual Stanford-California
freshman matches will begin at the
same time.
For the past three years Stanford
has won the varsity meet by large
scores, 1925 being the last time that
the Blue and Gold triumphed over
the Cardinal on the tennis court. And
this year, ap well, if pre-meet predic
tions do not go astray, Stanford
supremacy should be again demon
strated.
The Cardinals who will probably
represent Stanford in the singles
matches are John Doeg, lirst ranking
player and winner of the champion
ship of the Southern Division of the
Pacific Coast Conference at Berkeley
recently, Chuck Weesner, number 2
man and runner-up in the division
championship, and Captain Wheatley,
who was defeated in the semi-finals
of the tournament by Weesner. The
doubles teams have not been named
as yet but will be chosen from among
the singles players and Hall, Easton,
Driscoll, and Farwell.
Among the players who will travel
down the peninsula from Berkeley are
Captain Dick Hoogs, Nebo Chasseur,
Martin McKee, and Brick Budge.
Hoogs lost to Wheatley in the first
round of the division tournament, and
Chasseur was defeated in the Quarter
finals by John Doeg.
Prospects for a victory in the fresh
man meet, however, are not as bright,
since the Cardinal yearlings are suf
fering from the loss of Bancroft and
Hickman, first and third ranking
players who were declared ineligible
at the beginning of the quarter.
The Bear Cubs have defeated Pied
mont High, Berkeley High, the St.
Ignatius freshmen, and tied the Low
ell High School squad. The latter team
recently scored a 5 to 0 win over the
Cardinal youngsters.
