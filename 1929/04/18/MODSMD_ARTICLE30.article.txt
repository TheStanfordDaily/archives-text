# OPTIMISTIC STUDENTS DOPE HUGE STANFORD SCORE IN "BIG MEET"
## 
### 
Stanford will take 105 points in the
Big Meet, according to one Marsh
Taylor, prize optimist, so far, in the
Daily's annual Big Meet Doping Con
test. The average dopester gives Cali
fornia 39 counters, and insists upon
92 for the Cardinal track team.
Taylor is the only dopester as yet
that has donated the mile run to Mc-
Kinnon. Not only that, but he also
generously hands over the two-mile
to Brown. Of course, he condescends
to allow second places in these events
to Carter and Moasman. In his esti
mation, Captain Curtice of the Bears
is only good enough to spear third
place in the javelin, although he does
think that Jacklevitch will leap into
first place in the high jump. The relay,
he concedes, will go to Stanford.
Four prizes are offered to those
guessing the nearest score to the ac
tual result of the meet. Dope sheets
must contain that total score and the
place-winners of the individual events.
They are to be brought or mailed to
the Daily office up to Saturday noon,
the day of the meet.
