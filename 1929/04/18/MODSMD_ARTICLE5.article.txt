tack in downing Sigma Chi.
Playing bang-up ball behind the
speed-ball pitching of Ed Robinson
the champions were never in danger.

and held the Sigma Chi outfit to seven
scattered hits. The infield of the win
ning nine played flawless ball, and
turned in a neat double play. Only one
error was chalked up against the en

fair brand of ball himself and, al
though he allowed fourteen hits, re
tired eleven of the Delta Chi batters

to the plate, Gibbs, for the winners,
was the leading batter of the game.
Tillotson played a good game for
Sigma Chi, and cracked out two hits,
cue of them going for two bags. Rob
inson also hit one that was good for
two bases.
In the only other contest of the day,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon hit the ball all
over the diamond to walk away from
El Cuadro. Besides playing a poor
fielding game, the losers were unable
to garner hits off McKeown in the
pinches. Ward and McKeown, both
playing for (he S.A.E.'s, led the bat
ters with two hits each.
El Tigre and El Capitan won their
games by forfeits, as their opponents,
Encina 2E and Encina 1W respective

One-sided scores featured the games
played yesterday afternoon in the in
tramural baseball tournament. Delta
Chi, winner of last year's mural base
ball series, looks like the team to beat
out for the title again this season.
Yesterday the Delta Chi players dis
played a fast-fielding, hard-hitting at
tack in downing Sigma Chi.
Playing bang-up ball behind the
speed-ball pitching of Ed Robinson
the champions were never in danger.
Robinson struck out eleven batters
and held the Sigma Chi outfit to seven
scattered hits. The infield of the win
ning nine played flawless ball, and
turned in a neat double play. Only one
error was chalked up against the en
tire Delta Chi team.
Irv Nye, of Sigma Chi, chucked a
fair brand of ball himself and, al
though he allowed fourteen hits, re
tired eleven of the Delta Chi batters
via the strike-out route.
Getting three hits out of four trips
to the plate, Gibbs, for the winners,
was the leading batter of the game.
Tillotson played a good game for
Sigma Chi, and cracked out two hits,
cue of them going for two bags. Rob
inson also hit one that was good for
two bases.
In the only other contest of the day,
Sigma Alpha Epsilon hit the ball all
over the diamond to walk away from
El Cuadro. Besides playing a poor
fielding game, the losers were unable
to garner hits off McKeown in the
pinches. Ward and McKeown, both
playing for (he S.A.E.'s, led the bat
ters with two hits each.
El Tigre and El Capitan won their
games by forfeits, as their opponents,
Encina 2E and Encina 1W respective
ly, failed to put in an appearance. In
a short practice tilt between the two
winners, El Tigre slugged out hits at
will and defeated El Capitan by a wide
margin.
