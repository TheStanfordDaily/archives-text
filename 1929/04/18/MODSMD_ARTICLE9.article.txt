# ATHLETICS TAKE OPENING LEAGUE CONTEST 13 TO 4
## President, High Government Officers Witness Opening Contest Despite Weather 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 17. (JP)—'The
j Athletics ran rough-shod over t»he
! Senators here today to win the de
j layed opening game of the American
| League season, 13 to 4.
President and Mrs. Hoover, Vice-
President Curtis, cabinet officers, and
mothers high in governmental circles,
witnessed the delayed beginning of
ihe Nationals' schedule. Most of them,
including the President and the First
Lady, stayed until the final out de
spite the cold weather and a hard
wind that blew across the rain-soaked
field.
"Sad Sam" Jones and Garland
Braxton were pounded to all corners
by the Athletics' sluggers, who scored
all their runs in the first five innings.
Thereafter Ad Liska held them hitless
but his mates were helpless against
Ed Rommel, who succeeded Philadel
phia's starting pitcher, Carroll Yerkes,
after the latter had allowed two runs j
in the first inning and walked two i
men in the second.
The usual ceremony of throwing
out the first ball was performed by
the President in expert style. Taking
the horsehide from Walter Johnson,
after first shaking hands with the new
manager and wishing him luck, Mr.
Hoover tossed the ball on a line to
i Umpire Moriarity, who caught it one
| handed with a fast jump. Secretary
! Good, with President Clark Griffith
' of the Washington team, led the two
squads to the pole in center field
i where he raised the American flag.
The vicious assault of the Athletics
|on Jones and Braxton included a
I home run by Foxx and doubles by
| Foxx, Dykes, Summa, and Hale. Only ,
' the sterling work of Liska, an Ameri
j can Association recruit, furnished any
i real satisfaction to the home fans,
i numbering 25,000, who saw the 1929
i edition of the Nationals set down
scoreless in the last seven innings.
Yerkes, the youthful southpaw
named by the veteran McGillicuddy
! for mound duty, was in trouble from
| the start. In the first inning Goslin
singled and Barnes doubled, both
scoring on Bluege's single. In the
hands, after Hayes had grounded out,
Yerkes walked Ruel and Jones who
! scored on West's three-base hit to
i center.
Thereafter, although frequently ;
threatening, the Nationals were sub
dued by Rommel who put on the
brakes in the pinches aided by Dykes
j and Bishop who contributed bits of
I snappy fielding. The former made a
! lightning-fast pickup of a hot ground
! er from Bluege's bat in the third in
ning for the day's field feature.

WASHINGTON, April 17. (JP)—'The
j Athletics ran rough-shod over t»he
! Senators here today to win the de
j layed opening game of the American
| League season, 13 to 4.
President and Mrs. Hoover, Vice-
President Curtis, cabinet officers, and
mothers high in governmental circles,
witnessed the delayed beginning of
ihe Nationals' schedule. Most of them,
including the President and the First
Lady, stayed until the final out de
spite the cold weather and a hard
wind that blew across the rain-soaked
field.
"Sad Sam" Jones and Garland
Braxton were pounded to all corners
by the Athletics' sluggers, who scored
all their runs in the first five innings.
Thereafter Ad Liska held them hitless
but his mates were helpless against
Ed Rommel, who succeeded Philadel
phia's starting pitcher, Carroll Yerkes,
after the latter had allowed two runs j
in the first inning and walked two i
men in the second.
The usual ceremony of throwing
out the first ball was performed by
the President in expert style. Taking
the horsehide from Walter Johnson,
after first shaking hands with the new
manager and wishing him luck, Mr.
Hoover tossed the ball on a line to
i Umpire Moriarity, who caught it one
| handed with a fast jump. Secretary
! Good, with President Clark Griffith
' of the Washington team, led the two
squads to the pole in center field
i where he raised the American flag.
The vicious assault of the Athletics
|on Jones and Braxton included a
I home run by Foxx and doubles by
| Foxx, Dykes, Summa, and Hale. Only ,
' the sterling work of Liska, an Ameri
j can Association recruit, furnished any
i real satisfaction to the home fans,
i numbering 25,000, who saw the 1929
i edition of the Nationals set down
scoreless in the last seven innings.
Yerkes, the youthful southpaw
named by the veteran McGillicuddy
! for mound duty, was in trouble from
| the start. In the first inning Goslin
singled and Barnes doubled, both
scoring on Bluege's single. In the
hands, after Hayes had grounded out,
Yerkes walked Ruel and Jones who
! scored on West's three-base hit to
i center.
Thereafter, although frequently ;
threatening, the Nationals were sub
dued by Rommel who put on the
brakes in the pinches aided by Dykes
j and Bishop who contributed bits of
I snappy fielding. The former made a
! lightning-fast pickup of a hot ground
! er from Bluege's bat in the third in
