DRY GINGER ALE
Isuan has a delicacy of flavor, a delightful tang, a dis
tinctive quality which is possessed by no other ginger ale
in the world. For it is made from spicy, fresh ginger and
tangy, fresh limes in the wonderful health-giving Isuan
Mineral Water. It comes for thousands of miles bottled
and foiled from the Isuan Springs where it is made.
