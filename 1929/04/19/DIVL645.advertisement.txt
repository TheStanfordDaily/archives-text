WHEN TO BUY JEWELRY
The first thing a young man buys in
the line of jewelry is the engagement
ring, then the wedding ring, and then j
] if he is the right sort of a fellow he
; will follow these up with a necklace,
a bracelet, or some other bit of
| jewelry she may desire. In any and
I all cases come to us for rare precious 1
j stones, exquisitely set, and modpr- :
ately priced.
