HENRY THE VHlth—By Francis Hackett
MID-CHANNEL —By Ludwig Lewisohn
FATHER WILLIAM—By Donald Ogden Stewart
Henry the VHlth, because it is the most fascinating
combination of biography and history
we have yet encountered
Mid-Channel —because it is a worthy
corallary to Upstream
and Father William —because it is Donald Ogden
Stewart's first novel in four or five
years, and because it is ideal
spring reading
