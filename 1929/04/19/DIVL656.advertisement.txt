Effective April 6th, 1929
reduces all prices $ 55 00 to $ 260 00
to give the motoring public immediate advantage
of HUPMOBILE'S new expansion program
Early in January HUPMOBILE acquired a new plant in
Cleveland, comprising more than a million square feet of
modern and advanced automotive manufacturing facilities.
This was the first slop in HUPMOBILE'S 1929 program of
expansion, giving HUPMOBILE a doubled production ca
pacity for its famous Century cars.
Now comes the second step; that of passing along to the
public the economies which HUPMOBILE'S extended pro
duction plans make feasible.
These price reductions embrace all models in the 1929
HUPMOBILE Century Six and Eight lines and range from
$55.00 to $260.00.
Consistently, for more than twenty years, HUPMOBILE has
won and held its public by fine motor car quality at notably
low prices.
But today, in this new schedule of prices, HUPMOBILE
excels itself in value-giving.
