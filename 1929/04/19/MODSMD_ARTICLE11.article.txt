##

"We will do well to break the
existing 91-point Big Meet high
score record," thinks Ross Nich
ols, Card track captain. "Ninety
four points is the very best I can
dope the team for. The mile race
will probably be the most excit
ing event of the day, although
there is little doubt that Carter
will win.
"I doubt if any track records
will be set Saturday, as the Stan
ford stadium is bothered by un
favorable winds. I look to Har
low Rothert to do the record
breaking in the shot-put."
"Victory in the 1929 Big Meet
will be Stanford's and by a score
of 87-44," is the opinion of Dink
Templeton, Cardinal mentor.
