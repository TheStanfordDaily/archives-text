# Daily Gets Hot Reply From Press Gang To Ball Game Challenge
## 
### 
WHEREAS, the Daily Gang has with
temerity and extreme venturesome
ness of spirit seen fit to challenge
the Press Gang to play a certain
well-known game of ball; and,
WHEREAS, the black innuendos of
said Daily Gang contained in the
aforesaid challenge are base and
unutterably false; and,
WHEREAS, the Press Gang, rising
with dignity, magnanimity, and
generosity above the unwarranted
insinuations of said Daily Gang, is
able to discern the intent behind
the words in said challenge;
THEREFORE,-Be it known to all and
sundry that the Press Gang does
hereby accept said challenge and
with slugs, well-filled sticks, ink
knives, press rollers, and glue pots,
stands ready to engage in the fray,
and advises the Daily Gang to bring
eighteen major-leaguers and all lini
ment in stock to the baseball dia
mond on Sunday, April 28.

Thus did the typesetters reply t.o
the inskslingers' challenge.
The Daily is inclined to treat the
whole affair as trivial and ridiculous
and is determined to show the Press
for once and for all its proper place.
Word comes from the other aggre
gation that the game will result in
the usual overwhelming victory for
the Press, and that the Daily outfit
will be ignominously batted off the
field.
