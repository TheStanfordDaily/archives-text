# TOMORROW NOON IS DEAD LINE FOR DOPING CONTEST
## 
### 
Tomorow noon is the zero hour
when the Daily's annual Big Meet j
Doping Contest will close. All dope
sheets must be in the Daily office by
noon whether mailed or turned in by
the dopester.
The generous and much-coveted
prizes offered by four Palo Alto mer
chants have inspired about twenty
track enthusiasts to send in their pre-j
dictions. Only two of the 500 have
sent in their prognostications, but the !
special women's prize is expected to
inveigle more of the fair sex to enter ;
the contest.
A certain H. W. Peterson is the
champion pessimist of the dopesters. I
Peterson gives points to the j
Bears and believes the Cards can only j
scrape out of the ruckus. Bisbee
will breast the tape in the 100 yards,
he avers, and Chase will beat out
Neikirk for second place in the half
mile. Captain Curtice of the Blue and
Gold outfit is doped to spike the blue
ribbon in the javelin and Sparling of
the Cards isn't even in the money.
Another of his ideas is that Pogolotti
will grab second place in both of the
stick events ahead of Smith. And he
disagrees with most of the dopesters
by donating second in the broad jump
to Lom of California.

Dope sheets must contain the total
score and the place-winners in the in
dividual events. Prize-winners will be
announced Monday.
