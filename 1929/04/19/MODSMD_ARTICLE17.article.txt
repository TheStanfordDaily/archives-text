# POWERFUL CARDINAL TRACK TEAM FAVORED TO WHIP U. C. TOMORROW
## Blue and Gold Squad Weak As Teams Prepare For Big Meet; Krenz, Rothert Will Menace World's Records; Dyer Is Favorite In Sprints 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
California's Golden Boar, once so powerful in track and field hut of late years
grown feeble, will invade the Farm tomorrow in a weak and hopeless attempt to
defeat the pupils of that master coach, Dink Templeton, in the Stanford Stadium
in the thirty-sixth annual Big Meet. So inadequate to down the Cards, victors in
the 1927 and 1928 1.C.4-A. meets and undefeated during the present season, is the
team Coach Walt Christie is bringing to Stanford, that it is only a question of how
many points the Cardinal tracksters can score. The meet will begin at 1:45 p.m.
One hundred points—that is the goal for which the Stanford champions are
aiming, and Christie's only hope is that he can prevent too overwhelming a victory.
Notwithstanding the acknowledged supremacy of the Cards, the 1929 meet, like
all past ones, will be a Big Meet, big in every sense of the word. The spirit that

all Stanford-California contests
what they are will be present, and the
performances for which such contests are
famous are almost certain to be forth
coming.
•j Records—Big Meet, Pacific Coast, In
-1 tercollegiate, and World —all will be
threatened. Marks in the two weight
j events, the mile, two-mile, high hurdles,
I javelin, and pole vault are the most likely
I to fall.
Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert, Tem
pleton's two giant weightmen, will men
ace existing records in the shot put and
discus, and a new world's record in one
or both is well within the realm of pos
' sibility. Krenz and Rothert were mem
i bers of the 1928 Olympic track team in
| the shot put, and Krenz is unofficial hold
!er of the world's discus record. His toss
jof 163 feet 8 7-8 inches has not as yet
! been approved by the A.A.U. Rothert
I has been consistently putting the shot 50
! feet or farther in competition this year
and is favored to win the ball heaving
i event.

Mile Mark May Fall

California's aspirations for fame this
year are centered in Red Mossman and
Carter, distance men who will attempt to
better the present Big Meet times in (he
mile and two-mile. Red Mossman, sturdy
Bear eight-lap man, did 9:34 3-5 against
Washington last week; and if he can
repeat tomorrow the mark of 9:38 1-5
established by Hank Coe of Stanford is
sure to fall. Mossman is too fast for
Bob Brown, Templeton's best two-miler,
but the plucky Card sophomore will make
the Berkeley man work for his points.
Carter is undoubtedly one of the fast
est college milers in the country, and he
may be able to better the mile record of
4:20 1-5 set by Wilson of Stanford in
j 1914. Alex McKinnon should press him
closely for first, with Johnny Parker,
! also of the Cards, taking third.
Captain Ross Nichols, holder of the
i Big Meet high hurdles record of 14 4-5,
! is in good shape now and if running con
ditions are satisfactory may be able to
| win the high barriers in even faster time.
Ward Edmonds and Rogers Smith,
Dink's other high hurdlers, are favored
to take second and third from Pogolotti,
California's best. Edmonds and Smith
should take first and second in the lows
with Pogolotti third.
Javelin a Feature
The javelin will bring together three
of the best javelin throwers on the Coast,
and the outcome will be uncertain until
after the last toss has been made. Leo
Kibby of Stanford and Captain Curticc
of the Bears have both bettered 200 feet
this year, and Kibby's teammate, Spar
ling, has done 195. Because of his more
consistent performances, Kibby has the
edge over Curtice. The existing Big
Meet record of 200 feet 2 inches set by
Joaquin in 1927 is almost certain to fall.

Ward Edmonds, who took up hurdling
as a sideline this season and developed
into one of the greatest barrier men on
the Coast, is still vaulting as well as be
fore; and it is not too hard to conceive
of a new world's record being established.
Edmonds should at least better the ex
isting Big Meet record of 13 feet six
inches which he set last year. Hulsman
and Berry of Stanford are favored to
take second and third.
The sprints should be among the fea
ture races of the day, with Hec Dyer and
John Lauritzen of the Cards opposing
Bisbee, Christie's latest short distance
"find." Bisbee turned in a 9 4-5 second
win in the century against Washington
last week, but because of Dyer's regular
even time performances the latter is fa
vored to take both sprints. Bisbee should
place second in the hundred with Lau
ritzen third, but Lauritzen may slip by
him to take second in the two-twenty.
The quarter-mile looks like Morrison's
race. The lanky Card has run some
mighty good laps this year and is capable
of doing one in 48 seconds. His showing
against Vic Williams of U.S.C. was dis
appointing, but last week he looked better
against the All-Stars. Shove and Syer
will fight it out for the other places with
Clark of California, the Bear runner be
ing favored for second .

The outcome of the eight eighty is
somewhat uncertain, dependent on wheth
er or not Templeton enters McKinnon in
the two-lap event as well as in the mile.
If McKinnon runs the shorter distance,
too, he should take first from his team
mate, Neikirk. Chase of California is
the choice for third and is a possibility
for second.
Points in the two jumping events will

[ be divided fairly evenly, California tak
i ing the high jump and Stanford the
; l>road jump. Jacklevitch and Bingaman
{ are only average high jumpers, doing
j about 6 feet, but this is better than any
{ of the Stanford men have been able to
do thus far this year. The two Bears
should take first and second with French
of Stanford third. Dowell is favored in
the broad jump to win from Lom of
! California, Zombro or West of the Cards
j taking third.
j Templeton has not announced what
men he will run in the relay, but what
ever team he uses this event should be
! Stanford's. Morrison is certain to be
anchor man, and the other three will be
selected from the following : Syer, Shove,
i McDermott, and McKinnon.
