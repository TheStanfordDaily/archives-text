# POWERFUL CARDINAL TRACK TEAM FAVORED TO WHIP U. C. TOMORROW
## Blue and Gold Squad Weak As Teams Prepare For Big Meet; Krenz, Rothert Will Menace World's Records; Dyer Is Favorite In Sprints 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
California's Golden Boar, once so powerful in track and field hut of late years
grown feeble, will invade the Farm tomorrow in a weak and hopeless attempt to
defeat the pupils of that master coach, Dink Templeton, in the Stanford Stadium
in the thirty-sixth annual Big Meet. So inadequate to down the Cards, victors in
the 1927 and 1928 1.C.4-A. meets and undefeated during the present season, is the
team Coach Walt Christie is bringing to Stanford, that it is only a question of how
many points the Cardinal tracksters can score. The meet will begin at 1:45 p.m.
One hundred points—that is the goal for which the Stanford champions are
aiming, and Christie's only hope is that he can prevent too overwhelming a victory.
Notwithstanding the acknowledged supremacy of the Cards, the 1929 meet, like
all past ones, will be a Big Meet, big in every sense of the word. The spirit that

all Stanford-California contests
what they are will be present, and the
performances for which such contests are
famous are almost certain to be forth
coming.
•j Records—Big Meet, Pacific Coast, In
-1 tercollegiate, and World —all will be
threatened. Marks in the two weight
j events, the mile, two-mile, high hurdles,
I javelin, and pole vault are the most likely
I to fall.
Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert, Tem
pleton's two giant weightmen, will men
ace existing records in the shot put and
discus, and a new world's record in one
or both is well within the realm of pos
' sibility. Krenz and Rothert were mem
i bers of the 1928 Olympic track team in
| the shot put, and Krenz is unofficial hold
!er of the world's discus record. His toss
jof 163 feet 8 7-8 inches has not as yet
! been approved by the A.A.U. Rothert
I has been consistently putting the shot 50
! feet or farther in competition this year
and is favored to win the ball heaving
i event.

Mile Mark May Fall

California's aspirations for fame this
year are centered in Red Mossman and
Carter, distance men who will attempt to
better the present Big Meet times in (he
mile and two-mile. Red Mossman, sturdy
Bear eight-lap man, did 9:34 3-5 against
Washington last week; and if he can
repeat tomorrow the mark of 9:38 1-5
established by Hank Coe of Stanford is
sure to fall. Mossman is too fast for
Bob Brown, Templeton's best two-miler,
but the plucky Card sophomore will make
the Berkeley man work for his points.
Carter is undoubtedly one of the fast
est college milers in the country, and he
may be able to better the mile record of
4:20 1-5 set by Wilson of Stanford in
j 1914. Alex McKinnon should press him
closely for first, with Johnny Parker,
! also of the Cards, taking third.
Captain Ross Nichols, holder of the
i Big Meet high hurdles record of 14 4-5,
! is in good shape now and if running con
ditions are satisfactory may be able to
| win the high barriers in even faster time.
Ward Edmonds and Rogers Smith,
Dink's other high hurdlers, are favored
to take second and third from Pogolotti,
California's best. Edmonds and Smith
should take first and second in the lows
with Pogolotti third.
Javelin a Feature
The javelin will bring together three
of the best javelin throwers on the Coast,
and the outcome will be uncertain until
after the last toss has been made. Leo
Kibby of Stanford and Captain Curticc
of the Bears have both bettered 200 feet
this year, and Kibby's teammate, Spar
ling, has done 195. Because of his more
consistent performances, Kibby has the
