# Out After That Ninety-One-Point Record
## 
### 
A track performance is prophesied for tomorrow such as never has
been staged by Stanford or California in the annual Big Meet since that
worthy Golden Bear trampled on the first Cardinal team in 1893 and
burned a 91 -point victory into the records.
In thirty-five meets with the Blue and Gold, high scores—that is,
scores above 80 points —have been tallied by California nine times, by
Stanford three times. It is well to gloat over tomorrow's certain victory,
but tiie records of the past show up a valiant foe in the Golden Bear.
Dink Templeton's teams have been gradually, year by year, gaining
power. This year's stacks up with the best. The most pessimistic
dopesters give the meet to Stanford by a round 80 points and the most
boastful by 100 points.
Returning alumni may well enjoy seeing a great Cardinal team this
year, for if the lower division is eliminated, the lessening amount of
athletic material to enter Stanford and be here four years under the eye
of Coach Templet on will have a definite influence on the teams of the
years to come.
Today a great track team; tomorrow, with the disappearance of
freshman and sophomore men, at the most a lessened chance for further
great teams.
