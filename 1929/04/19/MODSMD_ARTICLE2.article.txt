# REPARATIONS EXPERTS ARE DEADLOCKED
## German Delegation Refuses To Go Beyond Original Offer of Annuity 
### 
PARIS, April 18 (/P). —The Allied and
German reparations experts, after ten
weeks of work to find a solution for the
difficult reparations problem, today
reached an absolute deadlock presaging a
breakdown in the negotiations.

The German delegation formally re
fused to go beyond its offer of 37 an
nuities of 1,650,000,000 marks (about
$396,000,000). Therefore there was con
sidered nothing now for the experts to
do except to make a report of their
labors and go home leaving the future
to take care of itself.

Negotiations and attempts to reconcile
the vastly divergent viewpoints of the
Germans and the Allied nations were
continuing, with a committee of eight
headed by Lord Revelstoke seeking a
compromise between the offer of Dr.
Hjalmar Schacht, German spokesman,
and the total Allies' claim.

The procedure of the Revelstoke com
mittee was uncertain, but it was believed
to be principally round table discussion
with three sets of figures as a basis.

The first of these was those repre
sented by the Dawes plan.

The second group represented the Al
lied offer of last Saturday—said to imply
a present value to the creditor nation
claims of about $10,000,000,000 and an
eventual value of about $24,000,000,000.
Annuities were understood to progress
arithmetically from a figure between
$500,000,000 and $600,000,000 for thirty
seven years, reverting then to about
$408,000,000 for the other twenty-one
years.
The third set of figures was that of
fered as a counter proposal by Dr.
Schacht at yesterday's plenary session—
a set which proffered annuities, for thir
ty-seven years only, of $240,000,000 less
than those contemplated by the Allied
nations, and, according to some estimates,
fall more than $3,000,000,000 short of
the Allied nations' total present value of
$10,000,000,000 for their claims.

An almost immediate effect of a break
down, it was believed, would be a re
quest by the French government for set
ting up of an index committee to arrange
for progressive increase in the annuities
from the end of the fifth year of the
payments, September 1, 1929.

The third set of figures was that of
fered as a counter proposal by Dr.
Schacht at yesterday's plenary session—
a set which proffered annuities, for thir
ty-seven years only, of $240,000,000 less
than those contemplated by the Allied
nations, and, according to some estimates,
fall more than $3,000,000,000 short of
the Allied nations' total present value of
$10,000,000,000 for their claims.

An almost immediate effect of a break
down, it was believed, would be a re
quest by the French government for set
ting up of an index committee to arrange
for progressive increase in the annuities
from the end of the fifth year of the
payments, September 1, 1929.
PARIS, April 18 (/P). —The Allied and
German reparations experts, after ten
weeks of work to find a solution for the
difficult reparations problem, today
reached an absolute deadlock presaging a
breakdown in the negotiations.

The German delegation formally re
fused to go beyond its offer of 37 an
nuities of 1,650,000,000 marks (about
$396,000,000). Therefore there was con
sidered nothing now for the experts to
do except to make a report of their
labors and go home leaving the future
to take care of itself.

Negotiations and attempts to reconcile
the vastly divergent viewpoints of the
Germans and the Allied nations were
continuing, with a committee of eight
headed by Lord Revelstoke seeking a
compromise between the offer of Dr.
Hjalmar Schacht, German spokesman,
and the total Allies' claim.

The procedure of the Revelstoke com
mittee was uncertain, but it was believed
to be principally round table discussion
with three sets of figures as a basis.

The first of these was those repre
sented by the Dawes plan.

The second group represented the Al
lied offer of last Saturday—said to imply
a present value to the creditor nation
claims of about $10,000,000,000 and an
eventual value of about $24,000,000,000.
Annuities were understood to progress
arithmetically from a figure between
$500,000,000 and $600,000,000 for thirty
seven years, reverting then to about
$408,000,000 for the other twenty-one
years.
