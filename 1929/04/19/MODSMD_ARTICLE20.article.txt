# Before the Crack o' Doom

### 
Since the New Theatre for Stanford Fund was swelled some $800
or thereabouts by that very fine vaudeville, the Theatre Fund Follies,
and by that rousing affair, the Masque Ball of Rally Committee vintage,
consider the scene. Here the campus has been rained with no end of
publicity, no end of pleas, no end of requests to back the New Theatre
for Stanford Fund. The campus in true loyalty has risen to the occasion
and has rolled up the munificent sum of $2319.27 plus $2100 from
anonymous and outside donors. But a paltry sum is this compared to
the necessary $350,000.
It doesn't seem likely that that stupendous sum will be forthcoming
from the campus. Assuming that the present rate of campus backing:
$2300 in four months, were to continue, the fund would grow some
$6900 annually and in the year 1979 (circa.) the New Theatre for Stan
ford would be financed. It is clear that assistance from outside donors,
who can give, and who know how to give to a good thing, will be re
quired to swing the deal within a generation. The War Memorial fund
of $117,000 has been suggested as a means of gaining a third of the
necessary amount in one stroke; it is still a suggestion.
But for fear that this New Theatre idea be forgotten after its present
strong impetus, the Daily makes another suggestion; let an annual allair
be made a custom on this here campus of ours, whether it be follies or
masque or carnival, or what you will, just as a means of adding the
student's little mite to the thing each year and most of all as a constant
reminder that Stanford as a student body wants, hopes for, is out after,
and expects to get a new theatre before the crack o' doom.
