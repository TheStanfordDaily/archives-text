# Hello-Alumni-Hop-In Day

### 
University Day in the minds of the undergraduates can't be of great
interest, but it isn't hard to imagine these same indifferent undergraduates
in the years to come looking forward to the time when they can return
to the Old Farm and shake hands with the classmates.
Seven classes hold reunions tomorrow. Three are pre-earthquake
classes; the other four date back to just l>efore the advent of the present
senior class. Since the days of the '01's, the '02\s, and the '03's Stanford
has risen to national prominence. It it with a just pride that those
alumni, as all alumni, can view the growth and expansion of Stanford
in the years they have known it.
The present generation welcomes back to Stanford those who have
helped to build it to its present greatness.
