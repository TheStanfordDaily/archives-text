# Answering a Campus Need
## 
### 
The need for ail infirmary on the campus has long been felt, but it
was not until this year that anything of the kind had been instituted.
Through the initiative of the Stanford Mothers' Club, two private
residences have been turned into temporary rest homes where men or
women students who need quiet, good food, and rest may be cared for.

Since last fall, when these homes were opened, the number of students
provided for has been proof of the definite need which this project,
generously backed and carried 011 by the Mothers' Club, has filled. The
club deserves real credit for this very worthwhile undertaking.
