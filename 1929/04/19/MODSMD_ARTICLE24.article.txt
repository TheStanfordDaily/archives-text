Cradle of the Deep. By Joan Lowell.
(New York: Simon and Schuster,
1929.)

"But it's not time! You can't be
lieve a word of it."
Well, what of it?

When Joan Lowell's extraordinary
book "Cradle of the Deep" first came
off the press, it made a tremendous
impression. Everyone devoured it, en
chanted at the idea that here was an
authentic account of life in the ocean,
seen from the most unusual angle
imaginable: a young girl, reared on a
ship, with only a crew of sailors for
nursemaids.

Then a smart reporter on the San
Francisco Chronicle got busy, and
afler a little investigating, produced
proof that this book was regrettably
far from authentic. He showed that
the log of the ship in the book far
from authentic. He showed that the
log of the ship in the book matched
very badly with Miss Lowell's story.

The clamor that this revelation
caused seems a little absurd. Of
course, it is the best publicity in the
world. But why people should be so
resentful when they learn that "Cradle
of the Deep" is only a magnificent
yarn is hard to see. Barnum said that
the American people liked to be
fooled, providing that it was done
cleverly enough.
And "Cradle of the Deep" certainly
answers this requirement. To say that
it is engrossing, spell-binding is mere
words, of course. But it is a fact that
once begun, the book is not put aside
until it is finished. It holds the reader,
almost without a let-down. When the
number of travel books now being
published runs into wearisome figures,
there must be some good reason for
the storm of interest and popularity
"Cradle of the Deep" has aroused.
There is. Its young author has
achieved a successful book, on a
foundation that is not flimsy. To begin
with, the story is absorbingly unique.
Miss Lowell almost never rehashes
the old stereotyped notions that clus
ter about a crew's performance on a
big sailing vessel. The movie idea of
big burly seamen being touchingly
deferential to the captain's lovely
fair-liaired daughter is scoffed at, all
the way through. The author is the
captain's daughter, and she is the only
woman on the ship—but she receives
no quarter from the sailors. They have
no more respect for her than they
have for themselves —less, in fact, be
cause she is weaker physically. The
only way she can earn any compli
ment from them is by a creditable
demonstration of strength—or physi
cal ability on her part.

The book is consistent to this pic
ture of its heroine. She is certainly
not attractive as a girl—but as a slim,
brown little sailor, incredibly crude,
incredibly brave, she makes an appeal
ing, fascinating figure.

However, the author is not so con
sistent in other respects. Her style is
particularly sporty. Miss Lowell does
not claim to be a writer. She tells
that a group of her friends, to whom
she relates some of her adventures,
urged her to have them published.

"No, I can't —I don't know enough
words," nhe demurred. "Use the words
that you've given us," they told her,
"and use them over and over again."
From this you would effect a gor
geously unlettered book, picturesque,
graphic, slangy—and in parts it is all
this. (These are some of the best
parts.) But too many pages have
strange lapses into erudite English
that spoil the effect somewhat.
However, this is a small thing when
compared to the remarkable vitality,
the swing, and the color of the book
as a whole.
From the time that she was four
teen months old until she was seven
teen, Joan Lowell lived on the good
ship Mninie A. Caine, a copra trading
schooner in the South Seas.
When Joan was two years old, she
acquired her first vocabulary: "good
wind." Her purpose in life, she soon
decided, was to be able to get as
much force, if not more, than anyone
else, on a boat where the slogan was
"first come, first take." The code of
the sea, "never squeal, and to take
punishment without a squawk," she
never breaks. Instead of crying when
she is hurt or frightened she swears.
When she learns to swear for four
minutes without repeating a single
adjective she becomes a full-fledged
seaman.
What difference does it make after
all, if the book is not all true. It is
fresh, careless, and splendidly thrill
ing. Isn't that enough?

From the time that she was four
teen months old until she was seven
teen, Joan Lowell lived on the good
ship Mninie A. Caine, a copra trading
schooner in the South Seas.
When Joan was two years old, she
acquired her first vocabulary: "good
wind." Her purpose in life, she soon
decided, was to be able to get as
much force, if not more, than anyone
else, on a boat where the slogan was
"first come, first take." The code of
the sea, "never squeal, and to take
punishment without a squawk," she
never breaks. Instead of crying when
she is hurt or frightened she swears.
When she learns to swear for four
minutes without repeating a single
adjective she becomes a full-fledged
seaman.
What difference does it make after
all, if the book is not all true. It is
fresh, careless, and splendidly thrill
ing. Isn't that enough?
—M. L. R.
Cradle of the Deep. By Joan Lowell.
(New York: Simon and Schuster,
1929.)

"But it's not time! You can't be
lieve a word of it."
Well, what of it?

When Joan Lowell's extraordinary
book "Cradle of the Deep" first came
off the press, it made a tremendous
impression. Everyone devoured it, en
chanted at the idea that here was an
authentic account of life in the ocean,
seen from the most unusual angle
imaginable: a young girl, reared on a
ship, with only a crew of sailors for
nursemaids.

Then a smart reporter on the San
Francisco Chronicle got busy, and
afler a little investigating, produced
proof that this book was regrettably
far from authentic. He showed that
the log of the ship in the book far
from authentic. He showed that the
log of the ship in the book matched
very badly with Miss Lowell's story.

The clamor that this revelation
caused seems a little absurd. Of
course, it is the best publicity in the
world. But why people should be so
resentful when they learn that "Cradle
of the Deep" is only a magnificent
yarn is hard to see. Barnum said that
the American people liked to be
fooled, providing that it was done
cleverly enough.
And "Cradle of the Deep" certainly
answers this requirement. To say that
it is engrossing, spell-binding is mere
words, of course. But it is a fact that
once begun, the book is not put aside
until it is finished. It holds the reader,
almost without a let-down. When the
number of travel books now being
published runs into wearisome figures,
there must be some good reason for
the storm of interest and popularity
"Cradle of the Deep" has aroused.
There is. Its young author has
achieved a successful book, on a
foundation that is not flimsy. To begin
with, the story is absorbingly unique.
Miss Lowell almost never rehashes
the old stereotyped notions that clus
ter about a crew's performance on a
big sailing vessel. The movie idea of
big burly seamen being touchingly
deferential to the captain's lovely
fair-liaired daughter is scoffed at, all
the way through. The author is the
captain's daughter, and she is the only
woman on the ship—but she receives
no quarter from the sailors. They have
no more respect for her than they
have for themselves —less, in fact, be
cause she is weaker physically. The
only way she can earn any compli
ment from them is by a creditable
demonstration of strength—or physi
cal ability on her part.

The book is consistent to this pic
ture of its heroine. She is certainly
not attractive as a girl—but as a slim,
brown little sailor, incredibly crude,
incredibly brave, she makes an appeal
ing, fascinating figure.

However, the author is not so con
sistent in other respects. Her style is
particularly sporty. Miss Lowell does
not claim to be a writer. She tells
that a group of her friends, to whom
she relates some of her adventures,
urged her to have them published.

"No, I can't —I don't know enough
words," nhe demurred. "Use the words
that you've given us," they told her,
"and use them over and over again."
From this you would effect a gor
geously unlettered book, picturesque,
graphic, slangy—and in parts it is all
this. (These are some of the best
parts.) But too many pages have
strange lapses into erudite English
that spoil the effect somewhat.
However, this is a small thing when
compared to the remarkable vitality,
the swing, and the color of the book
as a whole.

incredibly brave, she makes an appeal
ing, fascinating figure.

However, the author is not so con
sistent in other respects. Her style is
particularly sporty. Miss Lowell does
not claim to be a writer. She tells
that a group of her friends, to whom
she relates some of her adventures,
urged her to have them published.

"No, I can't —I don't know enough
words," nhe demurred. "Use the words
that you've given us," they told her,
"and use them over and over again."
From this you would effect a gor
geously unlettered book, picturesque,
graphic, slangy—and in parts it is all
this. (These are some of the best
parts.) But too many pages have
strange lapses into erudite English
that spoil the effect somewhat.
However, this is a small thing when
compared to the remarkable vitality,
the swing, and the color of the book
as a whole.
From the time that she was four
teen months old until she was seven
teen, Joan Lowell lived on the good
ship Mninie A. Caine, a copra trading
schooner in the South Seas.
When Joan was two years old, she
acquired her first vocabulary: "good
wind." Her purpose in life, she soon
decided, was to be able to get as
much force, if not more, than anyone
else, on a boat where the slogan was
"first come, first take." The code of
the sea, "never squeal, and to take
punishment without a squawk," she
never breaks. Instead of crying when
she is hurt or frightened she swears.
When she learns to swear for four
minutes without repeating a single
adjective she becomes a full-fledged
seaman.
What difference does it make after
all, if the book is not all true. It is
fresh, careless, and splendidly thrill
ing. Isn't that enough?

Cradle of the Deep. By Joan Lowell.
(New York: Simon and Schuster,
1929.)

"But it's not time! You can't be
lieve a word of it."
Well, what of it?

When Joan Lowell's extraordinary
book "Cradle of the Deep" first came
off the press, it made a tremendous
impression. Everyone devoured it, en
chanted at the idea that here was an
authentic account of life in the ocean,
seen from the most unusual angle
imaginable: a young girl, reared on a
ship, with only a crew of sailors for
nursemaids.

Then a smart reporter on the San
Francisco Chronicle got busy, and
afler a little investigating, produced
proof that this book was regrettably
far from authentic. He showed that
the log of the ship in the book far
from authentic. He showed that the
log of the ship in the book matched
very badly with Miss Lowell's story.

The clamor that this revelation
caused seems a little absurd. Of
course, it is the best publicity in the
world. But why people should be so
resentful when they learn that "Cradle
of the Deep" is only a magnificent
yarn is hard to see. Barnum said that
the American people liked to be
fooled, providing that it was done
cleverly enough.
And "Cradle of the Deep" certainly
answers this requirement. To say that
it is engrossing, spell-binding is mere
words, of course. But it is a fact that
once begun, the book is not put aside
until it is finished. It holds the reader,
almost without a let-down. When the
number of travel books now being
published runs into wearisome figures,
there must be some good reason for
the storm of interest and popularity
"Cradle of the Deep" has aroused.
There is. Its young author has
achieved a successful book, on a
foundation that is not flimsy. To begin
with, the story is absorbingly unique.
Miss Lowell almost never rehashes
the old stereotyped notions that clus
ter about a crew's performance on a
big sailing vessel. The movie idea of
big burly seamen being touchingly
deferential to the captain's lovely
fair-liaired daughter is scoffed at, all
the way through. The author is the
captain's daughter, and she is the only
woman on the ship—but she receives
no quarter from the sailors. They have
no more respect for her than they
have for themselves —less, in fact, be
cause she is weaker physically. The
only way she can earn any compli
ment from them is by a creditable
demonstration of strength—or physi
cal ability on her part.

The book is consistent to this pic
ture of its heroine. She is certainly
not attractive as a girl—but as a slim,
brown little sailor, incredibly crude,
incredibly brave, she makes an appeal
ing, fascinating figure.
