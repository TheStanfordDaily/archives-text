The Editor, Sir:
Rather than present more or less
accurate statistics on prohibition, I'll
just throw out a few questions to the
advocates of under-the-table etiquette.
Instead of having prohibition or any
resemblance thereto, why not fill up
with A1 liquor every locomotive en
gineer and fireman before they started
their run? Why not have a university
whiskey barrel from which every pro
fessor would be required to drink at,
least a quart every morning before
meeting any of his classes? Why not
have another barrel in the door of

each classroom and require each stu
dent to take several deep swigs of
choice two-decade wine, and duck
every one in the barrel who refused
to drink?

Require every surgeon to be thor
oughly soused to the gills before oper
ating on a patient. Make every cus
tomer at gas stations gurgle as much
beer as gas bought for their cars.
Substitute rare champagne for milk
with which to feed babies.
Lastly, do not, under any condi
tions, allow anyone to die sober.
—Ellis C. Gait.
