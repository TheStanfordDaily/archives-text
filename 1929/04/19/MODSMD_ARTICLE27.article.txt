# VIOLA DANA PREFERS CITY TO COUNTRY LIFE; SAYS THAT TALKIES HAVEN'T CHANGED MOVIES
## 
### Ben Maddox 
Although Viola Dana, the picture
star who is playing in the stage play
"Spite Corner" at the President in
the city, is a staunch small-towner in
the play, she much prefers city life.
How do I know? Well, about six
years ago she spent a week in my
own home town doing exterior scenes
for a movie. The town was highly
excited at having a nationally famous
personage in its midst, and we all
turned out to watch Viola and her
company whenever they stirred out
of the hotel.
After seeing her in this new play
the other night, I asked her if she
remembered that week. "Do you still
live there? You do? Well, then, I
can't speak freely!
"It may he all right for the people
who live there, but —oh! that hotel.
They had the worst food, and the
only decent restaurant we could find
was a Spanish place. By the time we

left I'd eaten so much hot stuff I
was sizzling!"
Incidentally, we have had some real
ly good restaurants opened during the
past six years—and the hotel is under
new management!
This appearance in "Spite Corner"
|is the first Viola has made on the
i Pacific Coast in a long time. She re
! cently did "What Every Woman
| Knows" back East, and hopes that
J Ilenry Duffy will produce it out here.
! The Barrie play is one of her favorites.
Having been in theatrical work all
i her life, she is tolerantly philosophical
|in viewing her profession. "The
| movies haven't changed. The talkies
have made a technical difference, but
they're not hard if you can read lines
well. We still have the same stories,
the same happy endings. And while
intelligent people may demand more
serious dramas, we still have the great
mass of average people as our big
gest patrons."
