ROAST BEAR MEAT
It will be a mangy Golden Bear j
that comes down to the Farm to
morrow for the thirty-sixth an
nual fracas, a Bear that is doomed
to get some severe blows landed
on his snoot, but a Bear that
fights no matter how hard they
come.
Sons of the Stanford Red will be !
out to do what thirty-five other Cardi- [
nal track teams have attempted but I
failed —to make 91 points or better, j
Back in '93 at the first Big Meet, j
which drew an $8,000 gate, the Bears !
won 91 to 35. Part of California's sue- j
cess was laid to their having regula- j
tion track suits, while the Cards went j
clad in suits of their own, or of their j
roommates. Time changes everything, i
and now the brawny athletes of both j
institutions are clad in the best that
money can buy, however scanty.
Last year the Cards came with
in a half point of reaching this
desired goal of 91 and two years
ago within one-third of a point.
This Big Meet should see Stan- >
ford reach the pinnacle of its suc
cess, and we fervently pray that j
it will, for Big Meets in the future !
may not turn out so well for the
Cards. The axe has been felt, and
this year's freshman class of 350
men contained material that beat
the Bear Cubs by only one point.
One ot' the most exciting events on
tomorrow's program will be the mile
run, featuring McKinnon of Stanford
and Messrs. Carter and Cherry of
California. A few months ago, sport
writers did not say kind things about
Alex and laughed behind their type- j
writers. But now the "fair-minded j
press" has nothing too good to say
for the Stanford miler, who has been
baptized the "man who came back"
by virtue of his sterling performances
in the Trojan meet. The public loves :
a game fighter.
The Cards have the opportunity i
of capturing the one Big Meet rec
ord held by California, the 100-
yard dash, made by Barber in 1926 ;
in 9 4-5 seconds. This year Dyer !
and Lauritzen will scrap it out
with Bisbee. The Californian has
equalled the Big Meet record al
ready this season. Whether or not
he was aided by the wind still re
mains in the dark. Tomorrow will
settle the question. But he is rated
as strong competition, and Dyer
end Lauritzen will have to step
on it to bring the remaining rec
ord home to roost.

morrow for the thirty-sixth an
nual fracas, a Bear that is doomed
to get some severe blows landed
on his snoot, but a Bear that
fights no matter how hard they
come.
Sons of the Stanford Red will be !
out to do what thirty-five other Cardi- [
nal track teams have attempted but I
failed —to make 91 points or better, j
Back in '93 at the first Big Meet, j
which drew an $8,000 gate, the Bears !
won 91 to 35. Part of California's sue- j
cess was laid to their having regula- j
tion track suits, while the Cards went j
clad in suits of their own, or of their j
roommates. Time changes everything, i
and now the brawny athletes of both j
institutions are clad in the best that
money can buy, however scanty.
Last year the Cards came with
in a half point of reaching this
desired goal of 91 and two years
ago within one-third of a point.
This Big Meet should see Stan- >
ford reach the pinnacle of its suc
cess, and we fervently pray that j
it will, for Big Meets in the future !
may not turn out so well for the
Cards. The axe has been felt, and
this year's freshman class of 350
men contained material that beat
the Bear Cubs by only one point.
One ot' the most exciting events on
tomorrow's program will be the mile
run, featuring McKinnon of Stanford
and Messrs. Carter and Cherry of
California. A few months ago, sport
writers did not say kind things about
Alex and laughed behind their type- j
writers. But now the "fair-minded j
press" has nothing too good to say
for the Stanford miler, who has been
baptized the "man who came back"
by virtue of his sterling performances
in the Trojan meet. The public loves :
a game fighter.
The Cards have the opportunity i
of capturing the one Big Meet rec
ord held by California, the 100-
yard dash, made by Barber in 1926 ;
in 9 4-5 seconds. This year Dyer !
and Lauritzen will scrap it out
with Bisbee. The Californian has
equalled the Big Meet record al
ready this season. Whether or not
he was aided by the wind still re
mains in the dark. Tomorrow will
settle the question. But he is rated
as strong competition, and Dyer
end Lauritzen will have to step
on it to bring the remaining rec
ord home to roost.
