# WANT GLEE CLUB TALKIE
## 
### 
During the Spring Tour this year the
Glee Club was approached regarding the
possibility of making a talking picture
for the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Company.
Negotiations are now under way concern
ing the actual production of the picture,
which will probably be either late this
spring or late next fall.
Letters of appreciation were sent
out to the sororities of the State Uni
versity of Montana for their co-opera
tion in not holding any social events
that would detract from the main
track meet.
