### 
CHICAGO, April 18 (vP). â€”An order
to federal district attorneys to apply the
Jones law only in prosecuting "strong
cases involving commercialism" against
prohibition law violators has been re
ceived from Mabel Walker Willebrandt,
Assistant Attorney General in charge of
prohibition enforcement cases. The order,
dated March 23, became public today and
directed that the law be used sparingly in
order that it be given a "fair test."
The Stanford Glee Club has accepted
a contract with the Granada Theatre of
San Francisco for another special Sun
day noon concert similar to that which
was presented by the Glee Club at the
Granada Sunday, April 7.
