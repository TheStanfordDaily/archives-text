Debates with the College of the
Pacific and St. Ignatius remain on the
varsity squad calendar to complete
the present forensic season, according
to an announcement made last night
by Wheeler Barger, assistant debate
coach. Teams to represent Stanford
have already been selected for the
contests.
George Bodle, George Shibley, and
Edmund Jones go to Stockton on May
13 to debate with a College of the
Pacific team on the question, "Re
solved, That Foreign Criticism of
American Characteristics, Culture,
and Ideals is Unjustified." Two days
later Norman Tyre, John Cranston,
and Arthur Angel debate the same
question here in a return match.
On Monday a Stanford team com
posed of Pardee Lowe and Irving
Rosenblatt will use the foreign criti
cism question in a contest with St.
Ignatius in San Francisco.
