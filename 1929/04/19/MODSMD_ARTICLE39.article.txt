BOSTON, April 18 (vP).â€”Earl Clark,
young center fielder of the Boston Braves,
was carried from the field apparently un
conscious after crashing into a fence
while chasing a fly ball in the fifth in
ning of today's opening game with the
Brooklyn Dodgers.

In a talk given at Northwestern Uni- i
versity, Dr. E. L. Williams stated that
the Volstead Act and the 18th Amend
ment are not responsible for the gangs
and political corruptness in Chicago.

Legal matters in Lamoni, lowa, are at
a standstill. The only lawyer died a year
ago, two justices of the peace failed to
qualify, and the mayor has gone south
for the winter.
