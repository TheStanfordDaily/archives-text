# DRASTIC REVISION OF GOLF COURSE PLANS ANNOUNCED BY B.A.C.
## Number of Public Playing Privileges Reduced by Board to 200 
### 
A revision in the scale of prices for
the general public playing privileges on
the proposed Stanford golf course was
announced yesterday by the Board of
Athletic Control.
The drastic changes are:
1. Cutting from 250 to 200 the number
of general public playing privileges.
2. Abolishment of green fees on Sat
urdays, Sundays, and holidays for hold
ers of privileges.
3. Abolishment of green fees during
week-days for wives and minor children
of holders of privileges. However, the
original $2 fee for Saturdays, Sundays,
and holidays remains.
It is estimated that these reductions
will save the player approximately $100
a year.
The changes were announced follow
ing the partial compilation of answers
from students and faculty members in
a board-conducted survey on the cam
pus. The results indicate so far that 123
of the faculty will make use of the
course. More than three-fourths of the
students approached signified their inten
tion of playing.
The general public playing privilege is
for sale at the original price of $135.
