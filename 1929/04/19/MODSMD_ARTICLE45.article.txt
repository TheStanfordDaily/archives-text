Gold soccer balls will be awarded to
eighteen members of the Stanford soccer
varsity at a dinner to be held in the new
Union at 6:15 tonight, according to Man
ager Bill Adler. In addition, the team
will elcct a captain for 1929.

Phil Wilson, '01, will present the gold
balls, which have been donated jointly
by him and by Silva F. Pellas, '14, for
mer captain of the soccer team. The
awards are in recognition of the Car
dinals having won the California series
and captured the Far Western Confer
ence title.

At the banquet Pellas will offer a large
silver trophy, to become the possession of
the university winning the majority of
Stanford-California series during the
next five years. This trophy is similar
to one presented by Pellas several years
ago, and now on display in the trophy
room at Encina gym.

A1 Masters, '24, manager of the
8.A.C., and for three years a varsity
soccer man, will be a guest at the dinner.
All members of the 1928 soccer squad,
both freshman and varsity players, and
all others interested in socccr are invited
to attend. Because of rushing, the ban
quet will be as brief as is possible.

The success of this year's soccer team
is partially due to the work of Ward
Smith, student coach, who replaced Coach
Harry Maloney during the latter's ab
sence as Stanford's representative to the
A.A.A.U. conference.

graved "F.W.I.C.S.C. (Far Western In
