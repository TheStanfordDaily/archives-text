# BEARS HAVE THE SERIES, BUT REDS WANT ONE GAME
## Norm Horner, Season Nemesis of Wolterites, Will Start Game Here Tomorrow California Has Captured 24 Series While Cards Have Been Winning Only 12 
### Don Oswill 
Although the California Bears have j
finished on the long end of the score in )
the first two games, and cinched the
series for the fourth consecutive year,
Stanford's varsity baseball team will to
morrow attempt to turn the tide of vic
tory when it meets the Bears in the
final game of the series. The contest will
be called at 3:15 o'clock on the varsity
diamond.
California won the first game by a 7
to 2 count, and second 4 to 2. The Bears
have a considerable edge over the Cards
in batting prowess, and this strength was
responsible for the U.C. victories in the
first two contests. In the last game, the
Cards had a strong chance of tying things
up in the final inning, but they lacked the
punch to put over the necessary runs.
Horner Great Chucker
In Norm Horner, Coach Carl Zamloch
has one of the best pitchers in college
baseball. Horner is a cool and heady
chucker with worlds of control and a !
fast breaking curve. He has been suc
cessful against the Cards twice this sea
son, but his delivery is due to be solved
in this last contest.
Coach Ilarry Wolter has not yet defi
nitely decided who will chuck for Stan
ford tomorrow, but the choice rests be
tween Taylor and Smalling. Taylor is a
speed ball pitcher and could get by j
easily in the college baseball circles if |
he could overcome his wildness. Small- I
irig demonstrated his ability last week by j
hurling a one-hit game against the j
U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Thirty-seventh Series
This is the thirty-seventh year that
Stanford and California have competed
on the diamond, and during this time |
the Bears have captured twenty-four se
ries to Stanford's twelve. The 1906 series
resulted in a tie. Since 1920, California
has won seven, and the Cards two, Big
Series titles.
The regular line-up will be seen in
action against California. Wright will
play first base, Johnson and Staley will
cover the keystone bag, Laird will play
third, and Hardy will work behind the j
log. Wilton, Hunken, and Berg are
scheduled to start in the outfield.
Cards Find the Ball
Against the Meiji nine yesterday the I
Cards found themselves at bat, and col- \
lected eleven safe hits. Wilton and Har
dy were high men with four each, while
Staley and Hunken each nicked two. If
the Cards can keep their eye on the
agate tomorrow, things might not go so
well for Horner.
Coach Carl Zamloch has announed j
that the following will start against Stan
ford: Butler 3h, Powers cf, Stevenson
lb, Wilson rf, Burgett If, Swenson 2b,
Vilianos ss, Wyatt c, and Horner p.
