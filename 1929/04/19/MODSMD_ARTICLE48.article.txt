# Sport Supremacy Of '29 Hinges On Card Tennis Win
## California and Stanford to Meet in Crucial Match Of Tennis Season 
### 
With California victories in base
ball and basketball, a tie in football,
' and a certain victory for the Cardinal
• on the track tomorrow, the destination
I of the 1929 major sports crown, an
nually contested for by Stanford and
| California, will depend on the efforts
j of Stanford's tennis stars in turning
j back the representatives of the Blue
I and Gold when they clash at 10 o'clock
| tomorrow on the Cardinal courts. At
| the same time the freshman racquet
I wielders of the rival institutions will
meet in their annual combat.
The tentative lineup for the Stan
ford team, as announced yesterday by
Coach Tussing, will be Doeg, Wees
ner, and Captain Wheatley in the
singles. One doubles team will consist
lof Driscoll and Easton; while the
! other will depend on the outcome of
| the singles matches. If Stanford wins
| all three, the second doubles team will
! be made up of Hall and Farwell, but
! if the singles players lose any one of
; their matches Doeg and Hall will com
| pete in the doubles.
Cards Favored
Pre-meet predictions give the Cardi
nal team a one-sided victory and pos
sibly a clean sweep of the matches.
In the championships fo the Southern
Division of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence held at Berkeley recently three
! Stanford men, Doeg, Weesner, and
Wheatley, reached the semi-finals.
The fourth player in the semi-finals
was Nebo Chasseur of California who
was defeated by Doeg in straight sets.
Four schools participated in the meet.
Stanford, California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A.
Three other stars of the Blue and
Gold team who will probably see ac
tion in tomorrow's matches are Cap
i vain Dick Hoogs, Martin McKee, and
j Brick Budge. Hoogs lost to Wheatley
j in the first round of the division tour
nament. The California team has lost
jto both U.C.L.A. and U.S.C.; while
Stanford has defeated the southern
teams by large scores.
Victors Since 1925
' Stanford has won the annual var
iety meet every year since 1925. The
j closest score in any of the meets dur
ing the period was 4 to 1. For the past
two years Stanford has also won the
Pacific Coast Conference Champion
ship.
Prospects for a victory in the fresh
; man meet are not as bright for the
i Cardinal, however, since the yearlings
j are suffering from the loss of Ban
croft and Hickman, first and third
ranking players.
j The California Cubs have a strong
I team, having won over Piedmont
High, Berkeley High, St. Ignatius
freshmen, and tied the Lowell High
! team. The latter players recently
| scored a 5 to 0 victory over the Cardi
nal youngsters. The probable line-up
t for the Stanford team is Forney, Ilob
i inson, and Logan in the singles, and
Forney-Logan, Robinson-Johnston in
! the doubles.
SALIDA, Colo., April 18. (>P)—An
airplane carrying serum spanned the
peaks of the Continental Divide late
yesterday to save the lives of three
persons suffering from botullnus poi
soning on a ranch 18 miles from
j Salida.
The plane, piloted by Captain Carlos
I Reavis of the Colorado National
, Guard, made the perilous flight from
! Denver after a two-hour flight and ne
gotiated a precarious landing on a
! narrow golf course at Salida.
