Eric Krenz, curly-headed Stockton giant who bettered the world's discus record by more than five feet this
year with a toss of 163 feet 8 7-8 inches. Krenz, who was a double winner in the 1.C.4-A- meet at Boston last year
and a member of the 1928 Olympic team, placing third in the shot put at Amsterdam, is only a junior and will
have another year of competition.
