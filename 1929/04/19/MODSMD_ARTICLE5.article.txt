# GOLDEN BEARS HOPE TO KEEP BIG MEET HIGH-SCORE RECORD
## 
### 
Although not expecting victory,
California feels that it has a defi
nite goal before it in the Big
meet tomorrow, as is seen from
the following statements.
Coach Walter Christie gives
this report: "The Big Meet comes
three weeks too soon for the
California team. We have a hard
task ahead of us, but if the boys
come through we can stop Stan
ford from breaking the high-score
record. But our men must de
liver."
Captain Emory Curtice de
clares: "Stanford has a wonder
ful track and field team and
should go a long ways toward
repeating last year's 1.C.-4A. vic
tory. Tomorrow, California's
main purpose will be to keep the
high-score record in Berkeley."
