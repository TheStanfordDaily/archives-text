# STANFORD SWIMMING TEAM IS UNDEFEATED DURING 1929 SEASON
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers are preparing to
invade Lagunita now, after iinishing
a highly successful season of water
sports in Encina pool.
The closest contest of the season
was the dual meet with North west
ern's barnstorming swimming and
water polo team when, on February
14, the Purple mermen defeated the
Cardinals by one point. The final score
was 34-33, after an afternoon of sur
prises, tlio two biggest ones were
Whitey Burns' establishment of a new
Pacific Const intercollegiate record in
the 100-yard breast-stroke and Ed
Throndson's defeat of Colbath in the
diving competition. Colbath was holder
of the national intercollegiate diving
record in 1928.
The hotly contested swimming meet
was followed by a 7-3 defeat of the
Northwestern water poloists by the
Card team.
The week after the Northwestern
fray, Stanford mermen met paddlers
from the University of Oregon, and
decisively defeated them, 51-16. The
Cardinal swimmers took first places
in every event of the noe-sided con
test.
Whitey Burns broke another breast
stroke record, this time over a 200-
yard distance. His time was 2:45, five
seconds better than the former Coast ;
Conference record. Bill Cundall, who \
swam second to Burns, also did bet- j
ter than the former time.
Captain Denny Driggs pulled the ;
former Coast Conference time in the
150-yard back-stroke from 1:55.1 to
1:51.8. This speedy showing was fol
lowed by the establishment of another
new time when the Stanford medley
relay team won easily from the Ore
gon squad in 3:24.2.
When the Golden Bear invaded En
cina pool, March 2, he received a j
pretty thorough tubbing. Both varsity
and freshman teams went home after
losing one-sided contests. Whitey
Burns again showed his speedy breast
stroke, and lowered his Northwestern \
time in the 100-yard course to 1:12.4. j
In the very next event Reggie Harri- j
son clipped his own coast intercolle- j
giate record in the 50-yard sprint. He i
made the distance in 23.4 seconds.
The varsity score was 42-16.
Not to be outdone by the varsity
swimmers, the Card yearlings broke
two coast conference records in de
cisive manner, and won 49-11. Austin
Clapp's 220-yard free-style time of |
2:24 is far below the former record
of 2:33.4, and was faster than the
varsity time the same day. When the
freshman 800-foot relay team finished
in 2:37.4, they had shaved nearly ten;
seconds from the former freshman j
record.
On March 9 the varsity and frosh !
water polo teams went to Berkeley to
defeat the Bear in his native pool. !
The varsity paddlers returned with a i
8-2 score; the frosh brought back a (
15-0 win over the California babes.
