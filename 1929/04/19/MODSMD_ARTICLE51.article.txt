# One-Man Nucleus Built Into Winning Polo Four
## 
### 
With only one member of last year's
j varsity polo team reporting for prac
tice at the beginning of the fall quar
ter, Captain Richard A. Gordon, ably
[ aided by Lieutenant Charles Whit
! move, has succeeded in building a
team which has an even chance of
defeating the Oregon State mallet
men here in May.
The Cardinal varsity has played
J only one match to date, losing a fast
tilt to a team from the San Mateo
; Burlingame Polo Club by a score of
seven to five on March 8. No other
i games than that with O.S.C. have
I been scheduled because it has been
I necessary to train a sufficient number
i of horses to mount visiting teams and
| these mounts are not as yet ready to
; Play.
To take care of the large increase
in the number of those playing polo,
one new practice cage has been com
pleted and another is in the process
lof construction. A large number of
i training bridles and saddles of a new
and improved type have been added
;to the equipment used by the polo
squads.
Seniors of Columbia University in a
recent survey of prohibition voted 88 to
38 in favor of it. However, 71 announced
j that they partook of forbidden beverages
wliile 61 abstained.
