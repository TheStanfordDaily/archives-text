# YEARLING NINE DROPS LAST TWO CONTESTS TO LOSE CUB SERIES
## 
### 
Winning nine out of fourteen con- '
. tests, Stanford's freshman baseball
j team has just completed a successful
J season in spite of the fact that it
I dropped two out of three games to
; the California Cubs to lose the 1929
! Little Series.
Smacking out a total of twenty hits
. Kgainst six for California, the Card
babes turned the first contest of the
series, played at Berkeley on April 6,
j into a one-sided slugfest to win by ~
j score of 12-7.
The second contest, held at Stanford
' April 13, was easily won by the Blue
and Gold yearlings by the count of
9-2. They played errorless ball and
! touched Caddel for fourteen hits to
j make the going easy for Nix, Cub
! pitcher. In the third contest the year
j lings lost the series by a score of 5-2.
Coach Husky Hunt had less than
: the usual quality of material out of
which to mould a winning team this
year, although several of the regulars
have shown themselves to be poten
tial varsity men. Captain Rudy Rin
tala, class of '31 four-sport star, has
been the most consistent hitter on the
team and an inspiration to the players.
Two first-class pitchers were devel
oped, namely McLean and Caddel,
both of whom should be chucking for
the varsity in a year or two. Barsu
mian, second baseman, and White,
shortstop, are two natural ballplayers
who have been the class of the Infield.
Both have neatly fielded their posi
tions all season, as well as being up
among the leading batters.
