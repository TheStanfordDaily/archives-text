# Cards Slated To Win I.C-4-A. Title For Third Season
## 
### 
Can Stanford's "boy coach" capture
the national track championship for the
third successive year ? Eastern track
stars will be waiting with 110 little con
cern to view the collection of luminaries
which Coach "Dink" Templeton will take
back east with him this spring when he
goes to Philadelphia to defend the I.C.
A.A.A.A. championship now held by the
Card track and field team.
Stanford's victory over the University
of Southern California squad and the
Southern All-Stars team seems to indi
cate that Templeton's 1929 aggregation
has the earmarks of another national
championship scoring machine.
Eight Point-Winners
As a starter, the Stanford track coach
has eight of the performers who brought
home the bacon last year. These eight
men accounted for thirty of the forty
three points that once again brought the
championship to the Pacific Coast. Three
stars of the 1928 team were lost by
graduation: Emerson Spencer, Hob King,
and Kim Dyer.
Here are last year's winners who will
probably be among those selected by the
Cardinal coach to compete in the 1.C.4-A.
meet on May 31 and June 1 :
Captain Ross Nichols, 120 high hurdle
champion; Eric Krenz, shot put and dis
cus winner; Harlow Rothert, second in
shot put; A1 Forster, fifth in shot put;
Leo Kibby, third in javelin; Bill Spar
ling, fourth in javelin; Fred Zombro,
third' in broad jump; and Ward Ed
monds, tied for third in pole vault.
A few new faces may appear among
the Cardinal group when national com
petition commences. Hec Dyer, who ran
Charley Borah a hot race in the 100,
will surely find a berth on the team.
Borah, national sprint champion, didn't
suppress his praises for the soph sprint
er after the U.S.C. meet.
Morrison May Go
Johnny Morrison may be sent by
"Dink" for the quarter-mile race. Alex
McKinnon, after his sensational victories
in both the half and the mile races against
the Trojan runners, should take the trip.
Consideration may be given by Coach
Templeton to several other performers
on the Card squad. Rogers Smith, soph
hurdler, has" been showing improvement.
Virgil Dowell, a black horse winner in
the Trojan contest, should do something
in the broad jump. Mario Perelli-Mi
nctti, javelin thrower, has shown fair
development of late.

the Trojan runners, should take the trip.
Consideration may be given by Coach
Templeton to several other performers
on the Card squad. Rogers Smith, soph
hurdler, has" been showing improvement.
Virgil Dowell, a black horse winner in
the Trojan contest, should do something
in the broad jump. Mario Perelli-Mi
nctti, javelin thrower, has shown fair
development of late.
Can Stanford's "boy coach" capture
the national track championship for the
third successive year ? Eastern track
stars will be waiting with 110 little con
cern to view the collection of luminaries
which Coach "Dink" Templeton will take
back east with him this spring when he
goes to Philadelphia to defend the I.C.
A.A.A.A. championship now held by the
Card track and field team.
Stanford's victory over the University
of Southern California squad and the
Southern All-Stars team seems to indi
cate that Templeton's 1929 aggregation
has the earmarks of another national
championship scoring machine.
Eight Point-Winners
As a starter, the Stanford track coach
has eight of the performers who brought
home the bacon last year. These eight
men accounted for thirty of the forty
three points that once again brought the
championship to the Pacific Coast. Three
stars of the 1928 team were lost by
graduation: Emerson Spencer, Hob King,
and Kim Dyer.
Here are last year's winners who will
probably be among those selected by the
Cardinal coach to compete in the 1.C.4-A.
meet on May 31 and June 1 :
Captain Ross Nichols, 120 high hurdle
champion; Eric Krenz, shot put and dis
cus winner; Harlow Rothert, second in
shot put; A1 Forster, fifth in shot put;
Leo Kibby, third in javelin; Bill Spar
ling, fourth in javelin; Fred Zombro,
third' in broad jump; and Ward Ed
monds, tied for third in pole vault.
A few new faces may appear among
the Cardinal group when national com
petition commences. Hec Dyer, who ran
Charley Borah a hot race in the 100,
will surely find a berth on the team.
Borah, national sprint champion, didn't
suppress his praises for the soph sprint
er after the U.S.C. meet.
Morrison May Go
Johnny Morrison may be sent by
"Dink" for the quarter-mile race. Alex
McKinnon, after his sensational victories
in both the half and the mile races against
the Trojan runners, should take the trip.
