BERKELEY, April 19.—Give credit
where credit is due. Give credit to Stan
ford for having one of the greatest track
and field teams in the United States to
day. Californians take their hats off to
j the group of athletes who run, jump,.
| and throw for Dink Templeton.
Tomorrow it is California's lot to meet
J the Redshirts on the cinder path and
needless to say no one around this neck
! of the woods is betting the family hcir
; looms that the Golden Bears will win the
; meet. But that doesn't mean that Cali
fornians concede Stanford a new high
| score record, breaking the one of 91
I points, set in the first meet between the
i two institutions by the Berkeleyans.
Bears Hopeful
The band of athletes wearing the blue
and gold will In* fighting to retain thai
I record, and after the showing made by
! the Bears against Washington, it seems
that that mark, one of the two held by
j California, may stay in Berkeley.
Walt Christie, veteran coach of the
1 Bears, is digging deep into his "bag of
I tricks" and may have a few surprises to
put before the fans tomorrow afternoon.
! In his own mind, Christie feels that his
team will score more points than sport,
j writers in this section concede them. At
the same time, the "Old Master" recog
nizes the strength of the Stanford squad
and does not underestimate the ability of
| Templeton's charges.
Distance Races Feature
The mile and two-mile runs promise to
be features with Harry Carter, Califor
nia's four-lap man, holding the edge
over Alex McKinnon of Stanford and
j Spud Mossman, the premier two-miler of
the Pacific Coast, out to set a new Big
1 Meet record.
In the javelin, Captain Curtice and
j Kibby give promise of a spear-throwing
I duel ami the possibilities of a new meet
j record in this event are fine.
j Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert will
be watched with interest by California
supporters tomorrow. This will be the
first time the majority of them have seen
these stars in action this year and both
are coming too near the world's record
in their respective events to be passed
over lightly with the situation as it stands
and the Bears not having even an outside
;chance for a victory.
The thousand or more California stu
