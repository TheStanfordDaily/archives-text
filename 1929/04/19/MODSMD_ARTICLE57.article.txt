•defeating the California freshmen last
Saturday by the close score of 66-65.
The 1932 team opened their compe
tition on March 2 when they defeated the
Southern California Prep All-Stars by
a 67-55 score. The team showed unex
pected strength, taking clean sweeps in
the century, 440, and discus. El wood

fast times.
On the following Saturday the babes
walked over the Modesto Junior College
by the score of 77-45. Despite a wet
track the Stanford squad made a very
impressive showing. The yearlings took
ten of the fourteen first places.
During vacation the frosh defeated the
Alameda All-Stars by a score of 84-38.
In an unofficial meet on the Saturday be
fore the Little Big Meet the freshmen
made a good showing against the San
Francisco Prep Stars.
The freshmen entered the Little Big
Meet handicapped by the loss of Welch
and Lombardi because of ineligibility.
Both team followers were sure that their
teams would win by a good margin.
When the smoke had cleared the Stan
ford babes were on top by the slim mar
gin of one point. Three records were
broken. Ike Ilables and Ned Johns of
the yearlings and the California relay
team made the commendable showings.
Barlow and Bondshu of the Bear Cubs
were the high point men of the day, each
taking two firsts.
The 1932 team will give the varsity
good material for next year. Ned Johns
had cleared over 12-6 in the pole vault.
•Captain Ike Hables ran his last lap of
the relay in the California meet to turn
in the fast time of 50 seconds flat. In the
javelin Rudy Rintala has thrown the
stick consistently more than 170 feet.
Many of the other men have made out
standing performances during the sea
son and will be good varsity material.
