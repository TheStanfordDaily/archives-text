# VARSITY GOLF TEAM WINS FIVE OF SEVEN MATCHES THIS YEAR
## 
### 
One of the best golf teams repre
senting Stanford in many years has
carried the Cardinal into seven im
portant matches this year, and has
come out the victor in five. The two
meetings which Captain Ward Ed
monds and his teammates lost were
not dual matches, but were tourneys
with several other California schools.

Captain Edmonds, adding to his
laurels as the "ironman" of the track
team, has played stellar golf all sea
son, maintaining his right to compete
as number one man for Stanford, and
winning his match whenever he
played. Warner Edmonds, the cap
lain's brother, has played consistently
good golf as number two man on the
team. These two players have been
(he front line of the Cardinal offense.

Richie Stevenson, who came through
as a dark-horse in the finals of the
California Intercollegiates to meet Al
len Moser of U.S.C., has played bril
liantly in spots; lack of experience is
all that lost for him the match to
Moser at Del Monte. The other mem
bers of the team have been Bill Scott,
Larry Staley, Bob Syer, Doug White,
Warren Johnson, and Ken White.
