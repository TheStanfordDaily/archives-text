# Templeton, Warner World-Famous As Strategists On Track, Gridiron
## Dink and Pop Are Leaders of Their Profession, One a Gray-Haired Man, the Other a Youthful Athlete 
### Leonard Bartlett 
Stanford boasts of two world-famous
athletic coaches. One is a gray-haired old
man; the other, a young athlete barely
out of his twenties.
Peers of their profession, Glenn S.
Warner and Robert L. Templeton are
known throughout the country as build
ers of great athletic teams. "Pop" War
ner, the "old fox" of the gridiron, year
after year sends forth his leather-hehnet
ed warriors to the battlefields of confer
ence football, and time after time this
master strategist directs his athletes to
victory.
Templeton Good
As a product of Stanford's cinder
track, "Dink" Templeton does in track
competition what Warner performs in
the realms of football. When a squad of
Cardinal track stars departs for Phila
delphia this spring, it will be in defense
of a national title won by "Dink's" pro
teges in 1927 and 1928. For eight years
Templeton has been building an aggre
gation of track performers who yearly
carve their names on pages of collegiate
records with flying cleats and thudding
weights.
Youngest Mentor
Templeton's luck in track team devel
opment has been phenomenal, considering
the age and experience of the Stanford
mentor. Though not much over thirty
years of age, "Dink" has produced four
world champions during his eight years
of Stanford coaching. He has the ability

of an alchemist to transform an athlete
from one track event into a champion in
another. When an auto accident ended
Bud Spencer's hurdling career, Temple
ton transposed Spencer into the greatest
440 runner the campus has ever seen.
Bud now holds the world's record in the
400-meter run.
Coming from the University of Penn
sylvania in 1924, Coach Warner set about
reconstructing the entire Stanford foot
ball system. It was not long before he
had defeated a California wonder team.
Cardinal red once again became predomi
nant in the color scheme of the Coast
football map. Warner, a well-known
coach before he came to Palo Alto, pro
duced winning teams with such success
that he is today known throughout the
grid world as a master of his trade.
Loyal to Warner
Profound loyalty to "Pop" is probably
the secret of Warner's notable accom
plishments among his football men. Forty
or fifty plays he may give his teams in
the course of a season. Some are stand
ard plays, others are never used. Once
in a while an almost-forgotten play is
sprung, and again the nation's sport
pages reverberate with praises to the
strategy of "Pop." But back of all this
technique and team work lies a deep
rooted loyalty, a "fight for Pop" spirit
which carries the Cardinals to victory.
Peers of their profession are Glenn S.
Warner and Robert L. Templetonâ€”the
"old fox" and the "boy coach."
