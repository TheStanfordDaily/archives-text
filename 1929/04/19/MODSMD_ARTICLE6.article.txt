"Frank A. Golder Memorial Fund" be
established by a donation from the
association treasury of $1,000 to
which individual members may con
tribute any amounts. The income from
the fund is to be used in the discre
tion of the chairman of the Hoover
War Library for the promotion of
the Russian Revolution study, which
absorbed Dr. Golder's interest.

The letter says that "there
will be no campaign for contributions,
for the whole object of this proposal
is to afford the privilege for those
who wish it, of furthering the work
which a rare friend has been forced
to lay down."
