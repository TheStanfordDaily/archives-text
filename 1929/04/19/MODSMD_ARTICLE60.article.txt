# CARDS EXPECTED TO SHUT OUT BEAR MEN IN SHOT AND DISCUS
## 
### Stephen Dietrich 
When Stanford takes all three places
in the shot tomorrow, as she is doped to
do, it will be the third straight time that
the Card weight tossers have shut out
California in that event.

Rothert, Krenz, and Forster are heavy
favorites to annex all nine points, and
thus carry on from where they left off
last year in the Big Meet and from where
the trio of Hoffman, Forster, and Fleish
hacker left off the year before.

Stanford is also favored to place one,
two, three in the discus, thereby captur
ing all eighteen points in the weight
events. In doing so the Cardinal coached
trio will bring back reminiscences of the
Big Meet of 1920, when led by Gillespie,
at a mere 124 feet, Stanford shut out the
California discus throwers.

Although Stanford's squad of weight
men this year is composed of one world
champion and several potential world rec
ord title holders, it is by no means the
first time in history that the Red Shirts
have been strong in this department.
Coach "Dink" Templeton has gained an
international reputation for turning out
champion weight tossers during the past
seven years. Krenz, Rothert, Hoffman,
and Hartranft—a rccord that speaks for
itself.
Two of Templeton's weight proteges
have broken world records, and both of
them scored points for the United States
in the Olympic Games. Back in 1926 on
a warm spring day "Tiny" Hartranft
stirred up the sport world when he let go
one of his mighty heaves in the discus.
A few weeks ago, in the same circle, in
tlie Stanford Stadium, Eric Krenz
smashed Houser's distance by an ample
margin. In fact, he threw the platter 163
feet 8 and a fraction inches.
At the Olympic Games four years ago
Hartranft showed up well in two events.
He placed second to Houser in the discus
and took sixth place in the shot. Krenz
and Rothert represented Stanford at Am

sterdam last summer. Although the lat
ter failed to place in the finals, Krenz
came through with a fourth in the shot.
Many, many years ago in 1895, when
Stanford was a newcomer in the ranks
of universities and the shot putting rec
ord was at an almost laughable distance,
California had the upper hand. The Car
dinal putters failed to score a point, al
though the winning toss was only thirty
four feet two inches.

The last big weight killing for Califor
nia came in 1923, when the state uni
versity scored clean sweeps in both the
shot and discus. In the following year
Stanford came to the front, and due to
the efforts of "Tiny" Hartranft, captured
firsts in every event. But in 1925 the
biggest upset in the history of Card-Bear
weight competition occurred. Dana Ca
rey, of California, nosed out Hartranft
in the discus, while Gerken handed him
a neat drubbing in the shot. Since that
date it has been "all Stanford," as far
as tossing weights is concerned.
When Stanford takes all three places
in the shot tomorrow, as she is doped to
do, it will be the third straight time that
the Card weight tossers have shut out
California in that event.

Two of Templeton's weight proteges
have broken world records, and both of
them scored points for the United States
in the Olympic Games. Back in 1926 on
a warm spring day "Tiny" Hartranft
stirred up the sport world when he let go
one of his mighty heaves in the discus.
A few weeks ago, in the same circle, in
tlie Stanford Stadium, Eric Krenz
smashed Houser's distance by an ample
margin. In fact, he threw the platter 163
feet 8 and a fraction inches.
At the Olympic Games four years ago
Hartranft showed up well in two events.
He placed second to Houser in the discus
and took sixth place in the shot. Krenz
and Rothert represented Stanford at Am

sterdam last summer. Although the lat
ter failed to place in the finals, Krenz
came through with a fourth in the shot.
Many, many years ago in 1895, when
Stanford was a newcomer in the ranks
of universities and the shot putting rec
ord was at an almost laughable distance,
California had the upper hand. The Car
dinal putters failed to score a point, al
though the winning toss was only thirty
four feet two inches.

The last big weight killing for Califor
nia came in 1923, when the state uni
versity scored clean sweeps in both the
shot and discus. In the following year
Stanford came to the front, and due to
the efforts of "Tiny" Hartranft, captured
firsts in every event. But in 1925 the
biggest upset in the history of Card-Bear
weight competition occurred. Dana Ca
rey, of California, nosed out Hartranft
in the discus, while Gerken handed him
a neat drubbing in the shot. Since that
date it has been "all Stanford," as far
as tossing weights is concerned.
When Stanford takes all three places
in the shot tomorrow, as she is doped to
do, it will be the third straight time that
the Card weight tossers have shut out
California in that event.

Rothert, Krenz, and Forster are heavy
favorites to annex all nine points, and
thus carry on from where they left off
last year in the Big Meet and from where
the trio of Hoffman, Forster, and Fleish
hacker left off the year before.

Stanford is also favored to place one,
two, three in the discus, thereby captur
ing all eighteen points in the weight
events. In doing so the Cardinal coached
trio will bring back reminiscences of the
Big Meet of 1920, when led by Gillespie,
at a mere 124 feet, Stanford shut out the
California discus throwers.

Although Stanford's squad of weight
men this year is composed of one world
champion and several potential world rec
ord title holders, it is by no means the
first time in history that the Red Shirts
have been strong in this department.
Coach "Dink" Templeton has gained an
international reputation for turning out
champion weight tossers during the past
seven years. Krenz, Rothert, Hoffman,
and Hartranft—a rccord that speaks for
itself.
