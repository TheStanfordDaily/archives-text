# CARD BASEBALL TEAM SLUMPS BADLY AFTER GOOD EARLY SEASON
## 
### 
The Card baseball team got away to a
good start this season by defeating two

of the strongest semi-pro teams in north
ern California, Granat Brothers of San
Francisco and Lee Haberdashers of Oak
land, but was unable to hold the pace and
cracked under the heavy guns of the
other college teams.
After trouncing the Olympic Club nine
by an 11 to 2 count, the Redshirts
dropped three in a row to the strong
Santa Clara outfit. In the first two con
tests against the Broncos, the Card pitch
ers were wild and walked many men; in
the third, the Broncos were enabled to
carry off the honors by a fluke home run
off an outfielder's glove.
Then the highly touted Keneally Seals
took a trip down to the farm and left
on the short end of a 4 to 3 score. This
was the third strong semi-pro outfit to
fall before the Cards.
In a two-game series with St. Mary's,
the Saints captured the first contest 9 to
3, and the Cards took the second by a
count of 7 to 4. Bill Sinnkins chucked for
the Redshirts and held the Moraga slug
gers well in hand.
During Easter vacation week, the lo
cals took their regular southern barn
storming tour. The Cards took the first
contest from Bakersfield, 11 to 3, but
dropped two games to U.S.C. and one to
U.C.L.A. by one-run margins. By de
feating U.C.L.A. in the last meeting of
these teams in Los Angeles, Stanford
hung up one conference victory for the
trip
The southern teams did not fare so

well up here, as the Cards defeated
U.S.C. 6 to 1 and U.C.L.A. 8 to 0. In
the latter contest Chuck Smalling let the
Bruins down with a single hit.
With Norm Horner throwing brilliant
ball, the University of California was
able to win two games from the Red
shirts and clinch the series for the third
consecutive year. He held the Card bat
ters to few hits, while the Bear sluggers
were collecting many safeties.
Recent funeral services of a Manchu
rian war lord lasted forty days.
