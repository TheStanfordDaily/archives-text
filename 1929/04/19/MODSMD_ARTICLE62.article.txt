# WARNER WORKS HARD TO PRODUCE WINNING TEAM FOR NEXT YEAR
## 
### 
Spring football practice has begun, and
Pop Warner is again hard at work, re
building the great Card grid machine for
another season.
As usual, graduation has hard hit the
Stanford squad, and with one of the most
formidable schedules in five years facing
him, the old Fox is far from optimistic.
Twelve of last year's lettermen are gone
including over half of the first string.
The two guard positions left vacant by
the great duo, Post and Robesky, are the
hardest to fill. Heiser and Driscoll arc
the probable first string men in this po
sition, but Hamilton, Forster, Wilson,
Bardin, Hulen, and Dawson are expected
to form strong competition.
A number of Warner's proteges are
still busy with other sports. Rothert,
Forster, and Tandy are out on the oval,
and the baseball diamond claims Taylor,
Simkins, Smalling, and Steinbeck. After
Saturday, all of them will be out of the
gridiron for the rest of the quarter.
