# VERSATILE CARDINAL ATHLETE THREATENS CHRISTIE'S HURDLERS
## Ward Edmonds Provides New Power to Templeton's Track, Field Squad 
### 
"Iron Man" Edmonds, as the doughty
Cardinal has been dubbed, should spell
hi-4 name with a capital V —for ver
satility. For the fair-haired Ward,
after two sensational seasons as one
of the country's best pole vaulters,
lias now added hurdling, both high
and low, to his list of activities.
Coming from a small high school
near San Diego, Edmonds was un
known during his first year at Stan
ford, even though he vaulted 12 feet
to win a second place in the Little
Wig Meet, and also won a third place
in the high hurdleß.
Edmonds was then induced by
Coach Dink Templeton to give up
hurdling and to concentrate on pole
vaulting. This he did very success
fully ,and was soon consistently do
ing 13 feet G inches, and one time
cleared 13 feet 10 inches. On several
occasions he barely missed topping
14 feet 2 inches, which would have
given him the world's record. Many
of his followers expect him to clear
lhis mark before the present season
is finished.
With the start of the 1929 season
Edmonds again took up high hurdling
and later on tried his legs on the low
sticks. He has placed second or third
each meet in the highs and has twice
won the low hurdles.
To see Edmonds sail over the bar at
better than 13 feet and then trot over
to the starting line to run a flight of
hurdles in close time and once again
return to his vaulting is truly remark
able. "Iron Man" Edmonds, indeed!
He can also high jump better than
six feet, and captains the Cardinal
goli team. He covers most any course
in par or better, and is a contender
in all the amateur tournaments on
the coast.
