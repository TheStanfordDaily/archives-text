# Cards Win Seventeen, U.C. Sixteen Of "Big Meets"
## 
### 
Stanford and California will stage
their thirty-sixth track meet tomorrow.
Out of the thirty-five meets, Stanford has
won seventeen, California sixteen, and
two have ended in a tie. 1906 was the
only year that did not see a Big Meet.
The great earthquake just three days
before the meet was scheduled forced a
suspension of the university classes and
activities.
The largest total yet made in any
meet was rolled up by the Berkeley team
of 1893 in the first Big Meet. The final
count was 91 to 35, which feat was prac
tically reversed last year and in 1927
when Templeton's outfit garnered 90 and
a fraction to 40. The closest struggles
in history were in IWS when Stanford
nosed out the Blue and Gold by one-fifth
of a point and in 1913 when the Cardi
nals won by a margin of two-fifths of a
point.
