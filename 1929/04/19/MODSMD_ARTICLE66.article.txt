# CARDS SUPREME OVER BEARS AS PROVED BY 1929 TRACK RESUME
## 
### 
California will enter the Big Meet to
morrow after a discouraging season of
defeats. Out of four varsity meets the
Bears have only been able to bring home
one victory and that was the first meet
of the year.
The season opened with a fine start
when on March 16 the Junior College
All-Stars, representing Modesto, San
Mateo, Marin, and Sacramento, were de
feated by California 91 1-6 to 30 5-6.
The All-Star team was only able to take
four first places leaving the Bears with
ten. This meet showed U.C.'s strength on
the track but weakness in the field events.
March 23 the squad rested holding only
a practice. On March 30 the strong
Southern California varsity met the
Bears in Los Angeles, defeating them 96
to 35. It was said that even optimistic
Dean Cromwell, Trojan, was surprised at
the score piled up by his team in this
meet.
The following Saturday, April 6, Cali
fornia lost to the Olympic Club 49 1-5 to
81 4-5. This was the same team that the
Cards had defeated in their opening meet
M'/j to 46J4. In the contest with the
Bears, the Olympic Club won 12 out of
the 15 first places.
Then the University of Washington
team came south last Saturday to give the
Bears one last chance before the Big
Meet to show their power. In the first
part of the meet the California varsity
upset the dope by winning the 100-yard
dash, the two-mile run, and gaining eight
points in the broad jump. But this was
no avail for the Washington team came
through with nine first first places and
won the meet to 55yi.
Stanford on the other hand meets Cal
ifornia tomorrow with a complete record
of victories for the previous meets this
season. The Card squad opened the 1929
season on March 9 when it met the
Olympic Club team on the Stadium track
and won with a score of SA'/j to 46'/i. It
was in this meet that Eric Krenz crashed
through to break the world's record in
the discus by more than five feet.
The Redshirts spent the next two and
a half weeks in working and practicing,
and kept training during the spring vaca
tion for the indoor meet at Seattle with
the University of Washington. Stanford
won this meet 73 to 58, breaking two
world's indoor records. Harlow Rothcrt
smashed the record in the shot, and
Krenz in his first performance on an in
door field broke the record in the discus.
The week following this meet was
spent in the most intensive work of the
year preparing for what was doped to be
the Cards' stiffest battle, the track and
field meet with Southern California
which was held in the Stadium on April
6. This was a thrilling meet, with the
Cards facing upsets and possible defeat
at first, and then coming through with a
decisive victory of 74 to 57. Ward Ed
monds and Alex McKinnon were respon
sible for twenty-one points.
On April 13, last Saturday, the Stan
ford varsity passed the hundred mark
when they defeated the Southern Cali
fornia All-Star team to 33%. This
proved to be a battle between Card var
sity men in many of the events.

ifornia tomorrow with a complete record
of victories for the previous meets this
season. The Card squad opened the 1929
season on March 9 when it met the
Olympic Club team on the Stadium track
and won with a score of SA'/j to 46'/i. It
was in this meet that Eric Krenz crashed
through to break the world's record in
the discus by more than five feet.
The Redshirts spent the next two and
a half weeks in working and practicing,
and kept training during the spring vaca
tion for the indoor meet at Seattle with
the University of Washington. Stanford
won this meet 73 to 58, breaking two
world's indoor records. Harlow Rothcrt
smashed the record in the shot, and
Krenz in his first performance on an in
door field broke the record in the discus.
The week following this meet was
spent in the most intensive work of the
year preparing for what was doped to be
the Cards' stiffest battle, the track and
field meet with Southern California
which was held in the Stadium on April
6. This was a thrilling meet, with the
Cards facing upsets and possible defeat
at first, and then coming through with a
decisive victory of 74 to 57. Ward Ed
monds and Alex McKinnon were respon
sible for twenty-one points.
On April 13, last Saturday, the Stan
ford varsity passed the hundred mark
when they defeated the Southern Cali
fornia All-Star team to 33%. This
proved to be a battle between Card var
sity men in many of the events.
California will enter the Big Meet to
morrow after a discouraging season of
defeats. Out of four varsity meets the
Bears have only been able to bring home
one victory and that was the first meet
of the year.
The season opened with a fine start
when on March 16 the Junior College
All-Stars, representing Modesto, San
Mateo, Marin, and Sacramento, were de
feated by California 91 1-6 to 30 5-6.
The All-Star team was only able to take
four first places leaving the Bears with
ten. This meet showed U.C.'s strength on
the track but weakness in the field events.
March 23 the squad rested holding only
a practice. On March 30 the strong
Southern California varsity met the
Bears in Los Angeles, defeating them 96
to 35. It was said that even optimistic
Dean Cromwell, Trojan, was surprised at
the score piled up by his team in this
meet.
The following Saturday, April 6, Cali
fornia lost to the Olympic Club 49 1-5 to
81 4-5. This was the same team that the
Cards had defeated in their opening meet
M'/j to 46J4. In the contest with the
Bears, the Olympic Club won 12 out of
the 15 first places.
Then the University of Washington
team came south last Saturday to give the
Bears one last chance before the Big
Meet to show their power. In the first
part of the meet the California varsity
upset the dope by winning the 100-yard
dash, the two-mile run, and gaining eight
points in the broad jump. But this was
no avail for the Washington team came
through with nine first first places and
won the meet to 55yi.
