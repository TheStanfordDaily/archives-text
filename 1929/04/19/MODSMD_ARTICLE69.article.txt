# Past Big Meets Featured Bicycle Races, Knee-Length Track Suits
## 
### 
Past Big Meets, like past Big Games,
have their high lights and oddities. Big
Meets in the early years of the Univer
sity drew paltry gate receipts of $8,000,
and were attended only by a few hand
fuls of rooters.
The first Big Meet back in 1893 was
held on April 22 at the Olympic Club
grounds in San Francisco. In those days
the track suit uppers had short sleeves
and were worn on the outside of the
shorts closely resembling the type of
men's swimming suits in the vogue
around 1910. According to the Daily
Palo Alto "the attendance at the field
day was very good, but the weather was
cold and raw and had a depressing effect
upon the 'thinly clad contestants."
Cards Win "Bike" Race
There was a mile walk, a two-mile bi
cycle race, and a sixteen-pound hammer
throw. The bicycle race was the only
event in which Stanford took all three
places. Events unthought-of were the
javelin, discus, the two-mile run, and the
relay. The pole vault went at 10 feet, the
high jump at 5 feet 8 inches, and the
shot put at 36 feet 10 inches. Some of
the times in the races were: 220 yards,
24: 1-5; half-mile, 2.05: 2-5; mile, 4.51:'
2-5, 220 low hurdles, 28: 2-3, and the
120 high hurdles, 17: 4-5.
In 1906, just a few days before the
earthquake, the first Little Big Meet was
held, the victory going to the Bear Cubs
73 l / 2 to 48'/ 2 .
Made World's Record
In 1908 Scott, the Stanford varsity
captain, broke the world's record in the
pole vault, clearing the bar at 12 feet
10 3-16 inches.
Feg Murray, famous news syndicate
cartoonist, came into prominence in 1914
when he was high point man of the Big
Meet with 12% points, and set a new
low hurdles record in 24 4-5 seconds.
Murray reached his zenith in 1916 when
he captained the Cardinals and captured

the hurdles event in the 1.C.4-A. meet. I
"Close Shave"
In 1915 after the relay had been run
California led 57 to 56 with the broad
[jump hanging in the balance. The Stan
ford jumpers came through to take six
points and the meet.
There were two stars in 1919. Jess
Wells made himself famous by winning
both sprints and both hurdle races for a
total of 20 points, and "Dink" Templeton
contributed a broad jump of 22 feet
inches and a high jump of 6 feet 3
inches to cinch the meet for the Cards.
Discus and javelin throwing was held
as an exhibition in 1918, and became rec- |
ognized individual events in 1919, which
year was also the last year that the ham
mer throw was an event.

Past Big Meets, like past Big Games,
have their high lights and oddities. Big
Meets in the early years of the Univer
sity drew paltry gate receipts of $8,000,
and were attended only by a few hand
fuls of rooters.
The first Big Meet back in 1893 was
held on April 22 at the Olympic Club
grounds in San Francisco. In those days
the track suit uppers had short sleeves
and were worn on the outside of the
shorts closely resembling the type of
men's swimming suits in the vogue
around 1910. According to the Daily
Palo Alto "the attendance at the field
day was very good, but the weather was
cold and raw and had a depressing effect
upon the 'thinly clad contestants."
Cards Win "Bike" Race
There was a mile walk, a two-mile bi
cycle race, and a sixteen-pound hammer
throw. The bicycle race was the only
event in which Stanford took all three
places. Events unthought-of were the
javelin, discus, the two-mile run, and the
relay. The pole vault went at 10 feet, the
high jump at 5 feet 8 inches, and the
shot put at 36 feet 10 inches. Some of
the times in the races were: 220 yards,
24: 1-5; half-mile, 2.05: 2-5; mile, 4.51:'
2-5, 220 low hurdles, 28: 2-3, and the
120 high hurdles, 17: 4-5.
In 1906, just a few days before the
earthquake, the first Little Big Meet was
held, the victory going to the Bear Cubs
73 l / 2 to 48'/ 2 .
Made World's Record
In 1908 Scott, the Stanford varsity
captain, broke the world's record in the
pole vault, clearing the bar at 12 feet
10 3-16 inches.
Feg Murray, famous news syndicate
cartoonist, came into prominence in 1914
when he was high point man of the Big
Meet with 12% points, and set a new
low hurdles record in 24 4-5 seconds.
Murray reached his zenith in 1916 when
he captained the Cardinals and captured

the hurdles event in the 1.C.4-A. meet. I
"Close Shave"
In 1915 after the relay had been run
California led 57 to 56 with the broad
[jump hanging in the balance. The Stan
ford jumpers came through to take six
points and the meet.
There were two stars in 1919. Jess
Wells made himself famous by winning
both sprints and both hurdle races for a
total of 20 points, and "Dink" Templeton
contributed a broad jump of 22 feet
inches and a high jump of 6 feet 3
inches to cinch the meet for the Cards.
Discus and javelin throwing was held
as an exhibition in 1918, and became rec- |
ognized individual events in 1919, which
year was also the last year that the ham
mer throw was an event.

Past Big Meets, like past Big Games,
have their high lights and oddities. Big
Meets in the early years of the Univer
sity drew paltry gate receipts of $8,000,
and were attended only by a few hand
fuls of rooters.
The first Big Meet back in 1893 was
held on April 22 at the Olympic Club
grounds in San Francisco. In those days
the track suit uppers had short sleeves
and were worn on the outside of the
shorts closely resembling the type of
men's swimming suits in the vogue
around 1910. According to the Daily
Palo Alto "the attendance at the field
day was very good, but the weather was
cold and raw and had a depressing effect
upon the 'thinly clad contestants."
Cards Win "Bike" Race
There was a mile walk, a two-mile bi
cycle race, and a sixteen-pound hammer
throw. The bicycle race was the only
event in which Stanford took all three
places. Events unthought-of were the
javelin, discus, the two-mile run, and the
relay. The pole vault went at 10 feet, the
high jump at 5 feet 8 inches, and the
shot put at 36 feet 10 inches. Some of
the times in the races were: 220 yards,
24: 1-5; half-mile, 2.05: 2-5; mile, 4.51:'
2-5, 220 low hurdles, 28: 2-3, and the
120 high hurdles, 17: 4-5.
In 1906, just a few days before the
earthquake, the first Little Big Meet was
held, the victory going to the Bear Cubs
73 l / 2 to 48'/ 2 .
Made World's Record
In 1908 Scott, the Stanford varsity
captain, broke the world's record in the
pole vault, clearing the bar at 12 feet
10 3-16 inches.
Feg Murray, famous news syndicate
cartoonist, came into prominence in 1914
when he was high point man of the Big
Meet with 12% points, and set a new
low hurdles record in 24 4-5 seconds.
Murray reached his zenith in 1916 when
he captained the Cardinals and captured

the hurdles event in the 1.C.4-A. meet. I
"Close Shave"
In 1915 after the relay had been run
California led 57 to 56 with the broad
[jump hanging in the balance. The Stan
ford jumpers came through to take six
points and the meet.
There were two stars in 1919. Jess
Wells made himself famous by winning
both sprints and both hurdle races for a
total of 20 points, and "Dink" Templeton
contributed a broad jump of 22 feet
inches and a high jump of 6 feet 3
inches to cinch the meet for the Cards.
Discus and javelin throwing was held
as an exhibition in 1918, and became rec- |
ognized individual events in 1919, which
year was also the last year that the ham
mer throw was an event.
