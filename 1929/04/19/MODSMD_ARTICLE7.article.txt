# University Boxing Tourney Is Cancelled By Maloney
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney announced yes
terday that the University boxing cham
pionships, scheduled for April 30 and
May 1, have been canceled. Next year
the tournament will take place two
weeks after the novice bouts in the au-

tumn quarter.

Not enough men signed up to make
the bouts worth while. Difficulty in get
ting into training after a three-week lay
off and participation in other spring
sports is responsible for this poor show
ing.
