M. Charest, general counsel of the
Internal Revenue Bureau, ruled today
a college fraternity house used as a
meeting place, for entertainment, and
as a place in which its members live,
was a social organization and con
tributions to it were not deductable
from gross income in computing its
income taxes.
The question was raised by a tax
payer seeking to deduct contributions
to his fraternity on the ground that
it wan an organization for scientific,
lit'-rary, or educational purposes.
The opinion did not give the name
of the college, the fraternity, or the
taxpayer.

aeon by 70,000 persons.
