# Varsity Fencers Victorious Over U.S.C., U.C.L.A. Teams
## 
### 
Stanford fencers enjoyed a fairly
successful season during the past few
months, placing second to the Olym-1
pic Club in a tournament with teams
from U.C., U.5.1.V., and the Olympic
Club, and taking a close second to
California in the fencing division of
the Minor Sports carnival held in this
section of the state recently.
The Cards established themselves
as masters of the U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. j
fencing teams, but lost by very close
margins to the Bears.
