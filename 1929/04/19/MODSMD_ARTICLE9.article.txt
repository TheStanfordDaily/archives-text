# VARSITY NINE DOWNS MEIJI TEAM 4 TO 3
## Wilton, Staley Get Two Hits In the Tenth to Break Tie and Win Game 
### Don Oswill 
With a thrilling tenth-inning rally to
net the winning run, Stanford's varsity
baseball team defeated the Meiji Uni
versity nine here yesterday by a score of
4 to 3. Frank Wilton and Larry Staley,
with two consecutive hits, broke up the
hall game and disappointed the many Jap
anese fans who had come to witness their
team from across the Pacific.

Entering the eighth inning with a 3
to 1 lead, Nakeniuna, Meiji pitcher, yield
ed three hits and two runs to the Card
batters to tie the score. In the tenth Wil
ton smacked out a double to deep center,
and Staley came through with a hot
single to score the winning run.

The Japanese nine threatened at all
times, and in the seventh nicked Kern
for three safeties and a run. Harder was
then sent to the mound for the Cards,
and held the Meiji sluggers helplessly in
hand during the rest of the contest. Meiji
scored its first run in the initial inning
when Tabe singled, pilfered second and
third, and tallied on a single by Matauki.

When on the bases, these little men
from far-off Japan were heedless of all
ordinary base running procedure. Any

time they thought there was a chance,
they were away for the next sack. Tabe
had four stolen bases to his credit, as
well as playing a fine game in the field.

Spud Harder again gets credit for a
victory. This is Harder's third win in
as many starts this season, and leaves
him with a higher percentage than any
other chucker on the squad.

When on the bases, these little men
from far-off Japan were heedless of all
ordinary base running procedure. Any

time they thought there was a chance,
they were away for the next sack. Tabe
had four stolen bases to his credit, as
well as playing a fine game in the field.

Spud Harder again gets credit for a
victory. This is Harder's third win in
as many starts this season, and leaves
him with a higher percentage than any
other chucker on the squad.

With a thrilling tenth-inning rally to
net the winning run, Stanford's varsity
baseball team defeated the Meiji Uni
versity nine here yesterday by a score of
4 to 3. Frank Wilton and Larry Staley,
with two consecutive hits, broke up the
hall game and disappointed the many Jap
anese fans who had come to witness their
team from across the Pacific.

Entering the eighth inning with a 3
to 1 lead, Nakeniuna, Meiji pitcher, yield
ed three hits and two runs to the Card
batters to tie the score. In the tenth Wil
ton smacked out a double to deep center,
and Staley came through with a hot
single to score the winning run.

The Japanese nine threatened at all
times, and in the seventh nicked Kern
for three safeties and a run. Harder was
then sent to the mound for the Cards,
and held the Meiji sluggers helplessly in
hand during the rest of the contest. Meiji
scored its first run in the initial inning
when Tabe singled, pilfered second and
third, and tallied on a single by Matauki.
