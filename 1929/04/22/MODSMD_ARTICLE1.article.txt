# HOOVER SCORES DEBENTURE PLAN OF FARM RELIEF
## President Sends Letter To Chairman McNary Stating Ten Reasons for Decision House to Resume Work With Bill, Will Vote Wednesday; Mellon, Hyde Back Hoover 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 21. (JP) —
President Hoover, in a letter sent to
day to Chairman McNary, of the Sen
ate Agriculture Committee, said he
Avas convinced that the export deben
ture plan of farm relief under con
sideration by that committee "would
bring disaster to the American farm
er."
He presented ten specific reasons
upon which he predicted an expressed
belief that the theoretical benefits
would not be reflected to the farmers;
that the debenture plan would lead
to profiteering by speculators and
(■ there as well as overproduction of
the affected commodities, thus adding
to the difficulties from which the
farmers now suffer from that cause.
Attached to the President's letter
were communications from Secre
taries Mellon and Hyde and the Com
merce Department which condemned
the plan in almost as vigorous lan
guage as that employed by the Chief
Executive and upon which Mr. Hoo
ver based most of his own conclu
sions that the plan put forward by
the National Grange is dangerous as
well as uneconomical.
Senator McNary has called his com
mittee to meet in special session at
JO a.m. tomorrow to consider the com
munications and there is conjecture
as to what action the committee will
take since it decided last week to re
port the debenture plan irrespective
of what views the Chief Executive
might express.
An unofficial poll of the committee
tonight disclosed six for the plan and
.six against with the deciding votes
in the hands of two Democrats, Smith
of South Carolina, and Thomas of
Oklahoma, and the one Farmer-Labor
member of the Senate, Shipstead of
Minnesota.
Even should the committee decide
to report the measure back with the
provision authorizing the Federal
Farm Board to put the debenture plan
into operation upon application of one
or more Farmers' Co-operatives, ad
ministration leaders believe the Sen
ate will reject it in view of the strong
opposition of President Hoover.
The House will resume considera
tion of its own measure which does
not include a debenture plan tomor
row under the five minutes' rule for
amendments and under a program
calling for its passage on Wednesday.
Debate also begins tomorrow in the
Senate, but with a vote apparently
several weeks away.
