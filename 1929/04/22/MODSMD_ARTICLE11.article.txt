# DR. WILBUR ASKS ALUMNI TO LOOK TOWARD FUTURE
## Letter From President Read At Reunion Day Dinner; Frank Keesling Is Chosen Head 
### 
"I hope that the returning gradu
ates will think of Stanford in terms
of the past with all of its fond mem
ories, but even more in terms of the
decades ahead," said Dr. Wilbur in
the letter that was read aloud at the
Alumni Banquet held Saturday night
in Encina Commons. "It is a great
deprivation to me not to be on the
campus to extend my personal good
wishes." He expressed the opinion that
"we can look forward to an institu
tion of national if not international
importance in which we can all take
unusual pride."
As acting president of the Univer
sity, Dr. Swain welcomed the alumni
and the new president of the associa
tion, Frenk Keesling, '98. Paul Down
ing, the outgoing president, expressed
his appreciation of the way in which
the graduates had helped him during
his term of office. Winston Norman
made an appeal for the help and co
operation of the alumni in getting the
new theatre, and outlined the progress
of this movement.
The banquet, which was the climax
of Alumni Day, was attended by over
three hundred people, including fac
ulty members, University athletes,
and for the most part, graduates.
Charles Parks and Gordon Davis were
in charge of the entertainment which
was furnished by the Glee Club, by
Burnell Gould and Paul Speegle who
presented the Radio Fiesta of the gay
M Jo's which had been given for the
Benefit Vaudeville, and by Jeanette
Owens. Scott Webster led in singing
and cheering which ended the dinner.
At a business meeting in the morn
ing, the alumni elected Frank Kees
ling president for the next term, Roy
Reppy vice-president, and John Ezra
McDowell to continue as secretary
treasurer. Following this there was a
meeting of the Branner Memorial
committee.
An alumni-faculty "get-together" tea
held in the Women's Clubhouse from
4:30 to 5:30 was attended by almost
two hundred people.
