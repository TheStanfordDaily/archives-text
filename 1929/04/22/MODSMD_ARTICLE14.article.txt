# NAVAL POLICY OF U. S. WILL BE REVEALED
## American Views on Reduction Of Armaments Made by Gibson at Geneva 
### 
GENEVA, April 21. (/P) —Au import
ant statement outlining American
views on reduction of armaments, but
chiefly on reduction of naval arma
ments, will be made tomorrow morn
ing by Ambassador Hugh S. Gibson
at the preliminary commission for a
disarmament conference.
The fact that the American Ambas
sador to Belgium would make a pro
nouncement of the American policies
was learned tonight as the result of
the unexpected official announcement
that the meeting scheduled for 3:30
tomorrow afternoon had been ad
vanced to 10 a.m. by special request
of the American delegation.
At the same time it was reported
in conference circles that Mr. Gibson
desired to make an announcement on
the naval question.
It was learned that the American
delegates, following the speech of
Lord Cushendun on Friday, arranged
with President Loudon of the Com
mission for an opportunity to present
their views on Monday.
In fulfillment of the belief of Presi
dent Herbert Hoover that the prob
lem of armaments must be treated like
ail others on a basis of common
sense, the impression prevailed to
night—although nothing was disclosed
of the American intention—that Am
bassador Gibson would seize the op
portunity to emphasize American
readiness to negotiate for real reduc
tions in naval strength.
Reports have circulated here that
the Americans would propose a "naval
pact of non-aggression." No informa
tion was available on this point to
night but observers were strongly in
clined to doubt it.
