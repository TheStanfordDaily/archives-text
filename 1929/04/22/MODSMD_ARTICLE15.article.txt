# PHOTOGRAPHY EXPERT LECTURES TOMORROW ON VISUAL EDUCATION
## 
### 
"Can the movies teach?" is the
question to be answered by George E.
Stone, Secretary of Visual Education
Service, Inc., tomorrow evening at
7:30 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
The lecture will be illustrated by
slides and films in a number of fields
of educational interest which Stone
has been developing.
A graduate in biology of the Uni
versity of California, Stone has ex
perimented in the field of photogra
phy, particularly color photography,
both moving and still. He developed
a film entitled "How Life Begins," il
lustrating biological processes and
used widely during the period of the
War, and other films designed to
represent an elementary biology text.
He was in France as official photo
grapher of his division. He is known
to members of the University as the
artist designer of the Illustrated Re
view for the past three years.
Stone has made a number of in
ventions for quick photography. Com
bining capability as an inventor with
technical understanding of photo
graphy, scientific education of a bio
logical type, and a strong artistic
sense, Stone has contributed to an
effort represented by Visual Education
Service to develop pictures and films
of an educational nature on a non
commercial basis.
