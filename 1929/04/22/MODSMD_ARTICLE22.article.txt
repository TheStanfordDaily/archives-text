OTANFORD'S 1929 Templeton-trained product of the track and field soundly
trounced the California Bears here Saturday 94 2-3 to 36 1-3 and in so
doing broke the Big Meet scoring record of 91 points which has withstood
the assaults of Cardinal athletes for thirty-five years. Four Big Meet records
were smashed and another equalled. This victory, the sixth in as many years
over the Bears, gives to the Cards the Pacific Coast dual meet championship
and establishes them as one of the greatest teams ever to represent Stanford
and probably the most powerful in the United States today.
The shot put, discus, javelin, and broad jump records all went by the board,
and the Big Meet mark in the hundred was tied. As for the meet records that

'were broken, all were in the field
events. The outstanding performance
of the day, undoubtedly, was the jave
lin throw of 209 ft. 7 in. by Churchill
of California, an outsider who was not
conceded even a third place in pre
meet dope sheets. This long toss bet
ters Joaquin's 1927 record of 200 ft.
2 in. by more than nine feet. Captain
Curtice of California took second with
more than nine feet. Captain Curtice
of California took second with a throw
of Stanford placed third with another
of 204 ft. 8% in.; and Bill Sparling
record-breaking toss of 202 ft. 3% in.
Weight Records Set
As was to be expected, Eric Krenz
and Harlow Rothert hung up i)ew Big
Meet marks in the discus and shot
put, respectively. Krenz, world's dis
cus champion, broke his own meet
record in the platter-heaving event,
sending the discus out 156 ft. 2 in.,
1914 in. farther than his previous
mark. After the regular competition
was over, the curly-headed champion
attempted to break his own world's
record of 163 ft. 8% in.; and he did
get out one throw of more than 162
ft., but stepped out of the circle in
so doing. Norman McLeod of Stanford
was second in this event and Waters
of California surprised to take third.
Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, heaved the shot 49 ft. 11%
in. to break the Big Meet record of
49 ft. B*4 in. held by Hartranft. Krenz
was second with a put of 48 ft. 8% in.
and Forster third at 46 ft. 6% in.
Virgil Dowell, who has been de
veloping into a great broad-jumper
this season, leaped 24 ft. 1% in. to
better Kim Dyer's Big Meet mark of
24 ft. I*4 in. Anderson placed second
and West third to give Stanford a
clean sweep.
McKinnon Beats Carter
"Iron Man" McKinnon, the veteran
Stanford miler who has come back,
again proved that he is one of the
headiest runners that has ever worn
the Cardinal, and one of the pluckiest,
when he beat Carter of California, the
favorite in the four-lap event, to the
tape by four yards in the time of
4:29 4-5, six seconds lower than Car
ter's best time this season. McKinnon
out-gamed and out-thought his faster
opponent, and it was a great sight to
I see him come driving around the last
turn and into the stretch, sprinting
like a hundred-yard man and fighting
it out stride for stride with Carter.
Mac has a world of fight in that small
body of his, and his courage was too
much for the long-legged Californian,
who broke about thirty yards from
the finish and almost fell. Johnny
