U.C.-Card Records Set in Shot Put, Discus, Broad Jump, and
Javelin; McKmnon Unexpectedly Beats Carter in Mile;
Dyer Passes Bisbee in Century to Equal Existing Time

OTANFORD'S 1929 Templeton-trained product of the track and field soundly
trounced the California Bears here Saturday 94 2-3 to 36 1-3 and in so
doing broke the Big Meet scoring record of 91 points which has withstood
the assaults of Cardinal athletes for thirty-five years. Four Big Meet records
were smashed and another equalled. This victory, the sixth in as many years
over the Bears, gives to the Cards the Pacific Coast dual meet championship
and establishes them as one of the greatest teams ever to represent Stanford
and probably the most powerful in the United States today.
The shot put, discus, javelin, and broad jump records all went by the board,
and the Big Meet mark in the hundred was tied. As for the meet records that

'were broken, all were in the field
events. The outstanding performance
of the day, undoubtedly, was the jave
lin throw of 209 ft. 7 in. by Churchill
of California, an outsider who was not
conceded even a third place in pre
meet dope sheets. This long toss bet
ters Joaquin's 1927 record of 200 ft.
2 in. by more than nine feet. Captain
Curtice of California took second with
more than nine feet. Captain Curtice
of California took second with a throw
of Stanford placed third with another
of 204 ft. 8% in.; and Bill Sparling
record-breaking toss of 202 ft. 3% in.
Weight Records Set
As was to be expected, Eric Krenz
and Harlow Rothert hung up i)ew Big
Meet marks in the discus and shot
put, respectively. Krenz, world's dis
cus champion, broke his own meet
record in the platter-heaving event,
sending the discus out 156 ft. 2 in.,
1914 in. farther than his previous
mark. After the regular competition
was over, the curly-headed champion
attempted to break his own world's
record of 163 ft. 8% in.; and he did
get out one throw of more than 162
ft., but stepped out of the circle in
so doing. Norman McLeod of Stanford
was second in this event and Waters
of California surprised to take third.
Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, heaved the shot 49 ft. 11%
in. to break the Big Meet record of
49 ft. B*4 in. held by Hartranft. Krenz
was second with a put of 48 ft. 8% in.
and Forster third at 46 ft. 6% in.
Virgil Dowell, who has been de
veloping into a great broad-jumper
this season, leaped 24 ft. 1% in. to
better Kim Dyer's Big Meet mark of
24 ft. I*4 in. Anderson placed second
and West third to give Stanford a
clean sweep.
McKinnon Beats Carter
"Iron Man" McKinnon, the veteran
Stanford miler who has come back,
again proved that he is one of the
headiest runners that has ever worn
the Cardinal, and one of the pluckiest,
when he beat Carter of California, the
favorite in the four-lap event, to the
tape by four yards in the time of
4:29 4-5, six seconds lower than Car
ter's best time this season. McKinnon
out-gamed and out-thought his faster
opponent, and it was a great sight to
I see him come driving around the last
turn and into the stretch, sprinting
like a hundred-yard man and fighting
it out stride for stride with Carter.
Mac has a world of fight in that small
body of his, and his courage was too
much for the long-legged Californian,
who broke about thirty yards from
the finish and almost fell. Johnny
Parker took third to give Stanford six
of the nine points in this event.
Edmonds High-Pointer
Ward Edmonds as usual shared
honors with McKinnon as the Stan
ford hero, the Card vaulter being
high-point man of the day with a total
of thirteen markers to his credit. He
took his customary firsts in the pole
vault and low hurdles and second in
the highs. Ward is a tine competitive
athlete and almost as good a hurdler
as he is a vaulter —that is to say, one
of the three or four best in the coun
try. Ho was two yards behind Captain
Ross Nichols in the high barriers in
a 15 2-5 s. flight and was followed by
Rogers Smith, giving Stanford a clean
sweep. Edmonds raced the lows in
25 1-5 s., Smith taking second and
Pogolotti of California grabbing third
from Nelson. The winning height in
the pole vault was thirteen feet. The
remaining four points were divided
between two other Stanford vaulters,
Hulsman and Berry, and Scrivner of
the Bears, who tied at 12 ft. 6 in.
Hec Dyer, Teinpleton's blond sprint
flash, who, by the way, is only a
sophomore, demonstrated that he is
the fastest short-distance man to per
form for the Cardinal in many years
by breaking even time in both the
century and furlong, equalling the
Big Meet 100-yard dash record of
9 4-5 seconds. His time of 21 4-5 in
the 220 is comparatively as good. In
both races he was several yards ahead
ot Bisbee, California's best. Lauritzen
was third in the hundred and Rec
nagel, another Stanford sprinter, third
in the two-twenty.
Morrison Takes 440
Johnny Morrison, although appar
ently running a slow opening two
twenty, came through with a tremen
dous finish in the quarter-mile to win
by six yards from his teammate, Syer,
in the excellent time of 48 4-5 sec
onds. Clark of California, who led
Morrison for the first 250 yards, was
third, a yard behind Syer.
The two-mile went to Mossman of
California, a wonderful little runner
who should be breaking records be
fore his years of collegiate competi
tion are over. The red-headed Califor
nia sophomore has a beautiful, easy j
stride and ran his way to an appar
ently effortless victory in 9 m. 45 s.
Mossman set a fast pace and had no
difficulty in keeping it throughout the
eight laps, stepping away from Bob
Brown of Stanford until almost a
third of a lap separated the two at
the finish. Brown had a strong sprint
and crossed the finish line a few
yards ahead of Loofbourrow of Stan
ford.
Half-Mile Goes to U.C.
Chase of California had a little bit
more sprint in the half-mile than Tom
Neikirk of the Cards and was able to
fight off the Stanford runner's chal
lenge and break the tape two yards
in the lead. Gordon French, Neikirk's
teammate, took third.
The high jump, as expected, went
to Jacklevitch of the Bears, who
cleared 6 ft. Vi in. Second place re
sulted in a tie between Madison and
French of Stanford at 5 ft. 11 in.
The mile relay proved to be a highly
exciting affair, and it was only Mor
rison's great final lap that saved the
race for the Cards. Shove ran a good
opening lap, giving Bobby Gooden a
four-yard lead. Gooden held it fairly
well, passing the baton to McDermott
a yard ahead of the Bear second-lap
man. McDermott fell as he gave Mor
rison the baton, and the powerful
Card anchor man was three yards
back at the start of his lap. He
opened up with a terrific sprint on
the final turn, passing Clark of Cali- j
fornia and striding across the finish j
line eight yards in the lead. Tho time ,
was 3:23 2-5.

U.C.-Card Records Set in Shot Put, Discus, Broad Jump, and
Javelin; McKmnon Unexpectedly Beats Carter in Mile;
Dyer Passes Bisbee in Century to Equal Existing Time

OTANFORD'S 1929 Templeton-trained product of the track and field soundly
trounced the California Bears here Saturday 94 2-3 to 36 1-3 and in so
doing broke the Big Meet scoring record of 91 points which has withstood
the assaults of Cardinal athletes for thirty-five years. Four Big Meet records
were smashed and another equalled. This victory, the sixth in as many years
over the Bears, gives to the Cards the Pacific Coast dual meet championship
and establishes them as one of the greatest teams ever to represent Stanford
and probably the most powerful in the United States today.
The shot put, discus, javelin, and broad jump records all went by the board,
and the Big Meet mark in the hundred was tied. As for the meet records that

'were broken, all were in the field
events. The outstanding performance
of the day, undoubtedly, was the jave
lin throw of 209 ft. 7 in. by Churchill
of California, an outsider who was not
conceded even a third place in pre
meet dope sheets. This long toss bet
ters Joaquin's 1927 record of 200 ft.
2 in. by more than nine feet. Captain
Curtice of California took second with
more than nine feet. Captain Curtice
of California took second with a throw
of Stanford placed third with another
of 204 ft. 8% in.; and Bill Sparling
record-breaking toss of 202 ft. 3% in.
Weight Records Set
As was to be expected, Eric Krenz
and Harlow Rothert hung up i)ew Big
Meet marks in the discus and shot
put, respectively. Krenz, world's dis
cus champion, broke his own meet
record in the platter-heaving event,
sending the discus out 156 ft. 2 in.,
1914 in. farther than his previous
mark. After the regular competition
was over, the curly-headed champion
attempted to break his own world's
record of 163 ft. 8% in.; and he did
get out one throw of more than 162
ft., but stepped out of the circle in
so doing. Norman McLeod of Stanford
was second in this event and Waters
of California surprised to take third.
Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, heaved the shot 49 ft. 11%
in. to break the Big Meet record of
49 ft. B*4 in. held by Hartranft. Krenz
was second with a put of 48 ft. 8% in.
and Forster third at 46 ft. 6% in.
Virgil Dowell, who has been de
veloping into a great broad-jumper
this season, leaped 24 ft. 1% in. to
better Kim Dyer's Big Meet mark of
24 ft. I*4 in. Anderson placed second
and West third to give Stanford a
clean sweep.
McKinnon Beats Carter
"Iron Man" McKinnon, the veteran
Stanford miler who has come back,
again proved that he is one of the
headiest runners that has ever worn
the Cardinal, and one of the pluckiest,
when he beat Carter of California, the
favorite in the four-lap event, to the
tape by four yards in the time of
4:29 4-5, six seconds lower than Car
ter's best time this season. McKinnon
out-gamed and out-thought his faster
opponent, and it was a great sight to
I see him come driving around the last
turn and into the stretch, sprinting
like a hundred-yard man and fighting
it out stride for stride with Carter.
Mac has a world of fight in that small
body of his, and his courage was too
much for the long-legged Californian,
who broke about thirty yards from
the finish and almost fell. Johnny
Parker took third to give Stanford six
of the nine points in this event.
Edmonds High-Pointer
Ward Edmonds as usual shared
honors with McKinnon as the Stan
ford hero, the Card vaulter being
high-point man of the day with a total
of thirteen markers to his credit. He
took his customary firsts in the pole
vault and low hurdles and second in
the highs. Ward is a tine competitive
athlete and almost as good a hurdler
as he is a vaulter —that is to say, one
of the three or four best in the coun
try. Ho was two yards behind Captain
Ross Nichols in the high barriers in
a 15 2-5 s. flight and was followed by
Rogers Smith, giving Stanford a clean
sweep. Edmonds raced the lows in
25 1-5 s., Smith taking second and
Pogolotti of California grabbing third
from Nelson. The winning height in
the pole vault was thirteen feet. The
remaining four points were divided
between two other Stanford vaulters,
Hulsman and Berry, and Scrivner of
the Bears, who tied at 12 ft. 6 in.
Hec Dyer, Teinpleton's blond sprint
flash, who, by the way, is only a
sophomore, demonstrated that he is
the fastest short-distance man to per
form for the Cardinal in many years
by breaking even time in both the
century and furlong, equalling the
Big Meet 100-yard dash record of
9 4-5 seconds. His time of 21 4-5 in
the 220 is comparatively as good. In
both races he was several yards ahead
ot Bisbee, California's best. Lauritzen
was third in the hundred and Rec
nagel, another Stanford sprinter, third
in the two-twenty.
Morrison Takes 440
Johnny Morrison, although appar
ently running a slow opening two
twenty, came through with a tremen
dous finish in the quarter-mile to win
by six yards from his teammate, Syer,
in the excellent time of 48 4-5 sec
onds. Clark of California, who led
Morrison for the first 250 yards, was
third, a yard behind Syer.
The two-mile went to Mossman of
California, a wonderful little runner
who should be breaking records be
fore his years of collegiate competi
tion are over. The red-headed Califor
nia sophomore has a beautiful, easy j
stride and ran his way to an appar
ently effortless victory in 9 m. 45 s.
Mossman set a fast pace and had no
difficulty in keeping it throughout the
eight laps, stepping away from Bob
Brown of Stanford until almost a
third of a lap separated the two at
the finish. Brown had a strong sprint
and crossed the finish line a few
yards ahead of Loofbourrow of Stan
ford.
Half-Mile Goes to U.C.
Chase of California had a little bit
more sprint in the half-mile than Tom
Neikirk of the Cards and was able to
fight off the Stanford runner's chal
lenge and break the tape two yards
in the lead. Gordon French, Neikirk's
teammate, took third.
The high jump, as expected, went
to Jacklevitch of the Bears, who
cleared 6 ft. Vi in. Second place re
sulted in a tie between Madison and
French of Stanford at 5 ft. 11 in.
The mile relay proved to be a highly
exciting affair, and it was only Mor
rison's great final lap that saved the
race for the Cards. Shove ran a good
opening lap, giving Bobby Gooden a
four-yard lead. Gooden held it fairly
well, passing the baton to McDermott
a yard ahead of the Bear second-lap
man. McDermott fell as he gave Mor
rison the baton, and the powerful
Card anchor man was three yards
back at the start of his lap. He
opened up with a terrific sprint on
the final turn, passing Clark of Cali- j
fornia and striding across the finish j
line eight yards in the lead. Tho time ,
was 3:23 2-5.

9 4-5 seconds. His time of 21 4-5 in
the 220 is comparatively as good. In
both races he was several yards ahead
ot Bisbee, California's best. Lauritzen
was third in the hundred and Rec
nagel, another Stanford sprinter, third
in the two-twenty.
Morrison Takes 440
Johnny Morrison, although appar
ently running a slow opening two
twenty, came through with a tremen
dous finish in the quarter-mile to win
by six yards from his teammate, Syer,
in the excellent time of 48 4-5 sec
onds. Clark of California, who led
Morrison for the first 250 yards, was
third, a yard behind Syer.
The two-mile went to Mossman of
California, a wonderful little runner
who should be breaking records be
fore his years of collegiate competi
tion are over. The red-headed Califor
nia sophomore has a beautiful, easy j
stride and ran his way to an appar
ently effortless victory in 9 m. 45 s.
Mossman set a fast pace and had no
difficulty in keeping it throughout the
eight laps, stepping away from Bob
Brown of Stanford until almost a
third of a lap separated the two at
the finish. Brown had a strong sprint
and crossed the finish line a few
yards ahead of Loofbourrow of Stan
ford.
Half-Mile Goes to U.C.
Chase of California had a little bit
more sprint in the half-mile than Tom
Neikirk of the Cards and was able to
fight off the Stanford runner's chal
lenge and break the tape two yards
in the lead. Gordon French, Neikirk's
teammate, took third.
The high jump, as expected, went
to Jacklevitch of the Bears, who
cleared 6 ft. Vi in. Second place re
sulted in a tie between Madison and
French of Stanford at 5 ft. 11 in.
The mile relay proved to be a highly
exciting affair, and it was only Mor
rison's great final lap that saved the
race for the Cards. Shove ran a good
opening lap, giving Bobby Gooden a
four-yard lead. Gooden held it fairly
well, passing the baton to McDermott
a yard ahead of the Bear second-lap
man. McDermott fell as he gave Mor
rison the baton, and the powerful
Card anchor man was three yards
back at the start of his lap. He
opened up with a terrific sprint on
the final turn, passing Clark of Cali- j
fornia and striding across the finish j
line eight yards in the lead. Tho time ,
was 3:23 2-5.

U.C.-Card Records Set in Shot Put, Discus, Broad Jump, and
Javelin; McKmnon Unexpectedly Beats Carter in Mile;
Dyer Passes Bisbee in Century to Equal Existing Time

OTANFORD'S 1929 Templeton-trained product of the track and field soundly
trounced the California Bears here Saturday 94 2-3 to 36 1-3 and in so
doing broke the Big Meet scoring record of 91 points which has withstood
the assaults of Cardinal athletes for thirty-five years. Four Big Meet records
were smashed and another equalled. This victory, the sixth in as many years
over the Bears, gives to the Cards the Pacific Coast dual meet championship
and establishes them as one of the greatest teams ever to represent Stanford
and probably the most powerful in the United States today.
The shot put, discus, javelin, and broad jump records all went by the board,
and the Big Meet mark in the hundred was tied. As for the meet records that

'were broken, all were in the field
events. The outstanding performance
of the day, undoubtedly, was the jave
lin throw of 209 ft. 7 in. by Churchill
of California, an outsider who was not
conceded even a third place in pre
meet dope sheets. This long toss bet
ters Joaquin's 1927 record of 200 ft.
2 in. by more than nine feet. Captain
Curtice of California took second with
more than nine feet. Captain Curtice
of California took second with a throw
of Stanford placed third with another
of 204 ft. 8% in.; and Bill Sparling
record-breaking toss of 202 ft. 3% in.
Weight Records Set
As was to be expected, Eric Krenz
and Harlow Rothert hung up i)ew Big
Meet marks in the discus and shot
put, respectively. Krenz, world's dis
cus champion, broke his own meet
record in the platter-heaving event,
sending the discus out 156 ft. 2 in.,
1914 in. farther than his previous
mark. After the regular competition
was over, the curly-headed champion
attempted to break his own world's
record of 163 ft. 8% in.; and he did
get out one throw of more than 162
ft., but stepped out of the circle in
so doing. Norman McLeod of Stanford
was second in this event and Waters
of California surprised to take third.
Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, heaved the shot 49 ft. 11%
in. to break the Big Meet record of
49 ft. B*4 in. held by Hartranft. Krenz
was second with a put of 48 ft. 8% in.
and Forster third at 46 ft. 6% in.
Virgil Dowell, who has been de
veloping into a great broad-jumper
this season, leaped 24 ft. 1% in. to
better Kim Dyer's Big Meet mark of
24 ft. I*4 in. Anderson placed second
and West third to give Stanford a
clean sweep.
McKinnon Beats Carter
"Iron Man" McKinnon, the veteran
Stanford miler who has come back,
again proved that he is one of the
headiest runners that has ever worn
the Cardinal, and one of the pluckiest,
when he beat Carter of California, the
favorite in the four-lap event, to the
tape by four yards in the time of
4:29 4-5, six seconds lower than Car
ter's best time this season. McKinnon
out-gamed and out-thought his faster
opponent, and it was a great sight to
I see him come driving around the last
turn and into the stretch, sprinting
like a hundred-yard man and fighting
it out stride for stride with Carter.
Mac has a world of fight in that small
body of his, and his courage was too
much for the long-legged Californian,
who broke about thirty yards from
the finish and almost fell. Johnny
Parker took third to give Stanford six
of the nine points in this event.
Edmonds High-Pointer
Ward Edmonds as usual shared
honors with McKinnon as the Stan
ford hero, the Card vaulter being
high-point man of the day with a total
of thirteen markers to his credit. He
took his customary firsts in the pole
vault and low hurdles and second in
the highs. Ward is a tine competitive
athlete and almost as good a hurdler
as he is a vaulter —that is to say, one
of the three or four best in the coun
try. Ho was two yards behind Captain
Ross Nichols in the high barriers in
a 15 2-5 s. flight and was followed by
Rogers Smith, giving Stanford a clean
sweep. Edmonds raced the lows in
25 1-5 s., Smith taking second and
Pogolotti of California grabbing third
from Nelson. The winning height in
the pole vault was thirteen feet. The
remaining four points were divided
between two other Stanford vaulters,
Hulsman and Berry, and Scrivner of
the Bears, who tied at 12 ft. 6 in.
Hec Dyer, Teinpleton's blond sprint
flash, who, by the way, is only a
sophomore, demonstrated that he is
the fastest short-distance man to per
form for the Cardinal in many years
by breaking even time in both the
century and furlong, equalling the
Big Meet 100-yard dash record of
9 4-5 seconds. His time of 21 4-5 in
the 220 is comparatively as good. In
both races he was several yards ahead
ot Bisbee, California's best. Lauritzen
was third in the hundred and Rec

ft., but stepped out of the circle in
so doing. Norman McLeod of Stanford
was second in this event and Waters
of California surprised to take third.
Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, heaved the shot 49 ft. 11%
in. to break the Big Meet record of
49 ft. B*4 in. held by Hartranft. Krenz
was second with a put of 48 ft. 8% in.
and Forster third at 46 ft. 6% in.
Virgil Dowell, who has been de
veloping into a great broad-jumper
this season, leaped 24 ft. 1% in. to
better Kim Dyer's Big Meet mark of
24 ft. I*4 in. Anderson placed second
and West third to give Stanford a
clean sweep.
McKinnon Beats Carter
"Iron Man" McKinnon, the veteran
Stanford miler who has come back,
again proved that he is one of the
headiest runners that has ever worn
the Cardinal, and one of the pluckiest,
when he beat Carter of California, the
favorite in the four-lap event, to the
tape by four yards in the time of
4:29 4-5, six seconds lower than Car
ter's best time this season. McKinnon
out-gamed and out-thought his faster
opponent, and it was a great sight to
I see him come driving around the last
turn and into the stretch, sprinting
like a hundred-yard man and fighting
it out stride for stride with Carter.
Mac has a world of fight in that small
body of his, and his courage was too
much for the long-legged Californian,
who broke about thirty yards from
the finish and almost fell. Johnny
Parker took third to give Stanford six
of the nine points in this event.
Edmonds High-Pointer
Ward Edmonds as usual shared
honors with McKinnon as the Stan
ford hero, the Card vaulter being
high-point man of the day with a total
of thirteen markers to his credit. He
took his customary firsts in the pole
vault and low hurdles and second in
the highs. Ward is a tine competitive
athlete and almost as good a hurdler
as he is a vaulter —that is to say, one
of the three or four best in the coun
try. Ho was two yards behind Captain
Ross Nichols in the high barriers in
a 15 2-5 s. flight and was followed by
Rogers Smith, giving Stanford a clean
sweep. Edmonds raced the lows in
25 1-5 s., Smith taking second and
Pogolotti of California grabbing third
from Nelson. The winning height in
the pole vault was thirteen feet. The
remaining four points were divided
between two other Stanford vaulters,
Hulsman and Berry, and Scrivner of
the Bears, who tied at 12 ft. 6 in.
Hec Dyer, Teinpleton's blond sprint
flash, who, by the way, is only a
sophomore, demonstrated that he is
the fastest short-distance man to per
form for the Cardinal in many years
by breaking even time in both the
century and furlong, equalling the
Big Meet 100-yard dash record of
9 4-5 seconds. His time of 21 4-5 in
the 220 is comparatively as good. In
both races he was several yards ahead
ot Bisbee, California's best. Lauritzen
was third in the hundred and Rec
nagel, another Stanford sprinter, third
in the two-twenty.
Morrison Takes 440
Johnny Morrison, although appar
ently running a slow opening two
twenty, came through with a tremen
dous finish in the quarter-mile to win
by six yards from his teammate, Syer,
in the excellent time of 48 4-5 sec
onds. Clark of California, who led
Morrison for the first 250 yards, was
third, a yard behind Syer.
The two-mile went to Mossman of
California, a wonderful little runner
who should be breaking records be
fore his years of collegiate competi
tion are over. The red-headed Califor
nia sophomore has a beautiful, easy j
stride and ran his way to an appar
ently effortless victory in 9 m. 45 s.
Mossman set a fast pace and had no
difficulty in keeping it throughout the
eight laps, stepping away from Bob
Brown of Stanford until almost a
third of a lap separated the two at
the finish. Brown had a strong sprint
and crossed the finish line a few
yards ahead of Loofbourrow of Stan
ford.
Half-Mile Goes to U.C.
Chase of California had a little bit
more sprint in the half-mile than Tom
Neikirk of the Cards and was able to
fight off the Stanford runner's chal
lenge and break the tape two yards
in the lead. Gordon French, Neikirk's
teammate, took third.
The high jump, as expected, went
to Jacklevitch of the Bears, who
cleared 6 ft. Vi in. Second place re
sulted in a tie between Madison and
French of Stanford at 5 ft. 11 in.
The mile relay proved to be a highly
exciting affair, and it was only Mor
rison's great final lap that saved the
race for the Cards. Shove ran a good
opening lap, giving Bobby Gooden a
four-yard lead. Gooden held it fairly
well, passing the baton to McDermott
a yard ahead of the Bear second-lap
man. McDermott fell as he gave Mor
rison the baton, and the powerful
Card anchor man was three yards
back at the start of his lap. He
opened up with a terrific sprint on
the final turn, passing Clark of Cali- j
fornia and striding across the finish j
line eight yards in the lead. Tho time ,
was 3:23 2-5.

U.C.-Card Records Set in Shot Put, Discus, Broad Jump, and
Javelin; McKmnon Unexpectedly Beats Carter in Mile;
Dyer Passes Bisbee in Century to Equal Existing Time

OTANFORD'S 1929 Templeton-trained product of the track and field soundly
trounced the California Bears here Saturday 94 2-3 to 36 1-3 and in so
doing broke the Big Meet scoring record of 91 points which has withstood
the assaults of Cardinal athletes for thirty-five years. Four Big Meet records
were smashed and another equalled. This victory, the sixth in as many years
over the Bears, gives to the Cards the Pacific Coast dual meet championship
and establishes them as one of the greatest teams ever to represent Stanford
and probably the most powerful in the United States today.
The shot put, discus, javelin, and broad jump records all went by the board,
and the Big Meet mark in the hundred was tied. As for the meet records that

'were broken, all were in the field
events. The outstanding performance
of the day, undoubtedly, was the jave
lin throw of 209 ft. 7 in. by Churchill
of California, an outsider who was not
conceded even a third place in pre
meet dope sheets. This long toss bet
ters Joaquin's 1927 record of 200 ft.
2 in. by more than nine feet. Captain
Curtice of California took second with
more than nine feet. Captain Curtice
of California took second with a throw
of Stanford placed third with another
of 204 ft. 8% in.; and Bill Sparling
record-breaking toss of 202 ft. 3% in.
Weight Records Set
As was to be expected, Eric Krenz
and Harlow Rothert hung up i)ew Big
Meet marks in the discus and shot
put, respectively. Krenz, world's dis
cus champion, broke his own meet
record in the platter-heaving event,
sending the discus out 156 ft. 2 in.,
1914 in. farther than his previous
mark. After the regular competition
was over, the curly-headed champion
attempted to break his own world's
record of 163 ft. 8% in.; and he did
get out one throw of more than 162
ft., but stepped out of the circle in
so doing. Norman McLeod of Stanford
was second in this event and Waters
of California surprised to take third.
Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, heaved the shot 49 ft. 11%
in. to break the Big Meet record of
49 ft. B*4 in. held by Hartranft. Krenz

U.C.-Card Records Set in Shot Put, Discus, Broad Jump, and
Javelin; McKmnon Unexpectedly Beats Carter in Mile;
Dyer Passes Bisbee in Century to Equal Existing Time

OTANFORD'S 1929 Templeton-trained product of the track and field soundly
trounced the California Bears here Saturday 94 2-3 to 36 1-3 and in so
doing broke the Big Meet scoring record of 91 points which has withstood
the assaults of Cardinal athletes for thirty-five years. Four Big Meet records
were smashed and another equalled. This victory, the sixth in as many years
over the Bears, gives to the Cards the Pacific Coast dual meet championship
and establishes them as one of the greatest teams ever to represent Stanford
and probably the most powerful in the United States today.
The shot put, discus, javelin, and broad jump records all went by the board,
and the Big Meet mark in the hundred was tied. As for the meet records that

'were broken, all were in the field
events. The outstanding performance
of the day, undoubtedly, was the jave
lin throw of 209 ft. 7 in. by Churchill
of California, an outsider who was not
conceded even a third place in pre
meet dope sheets. This long toss bet
ters Joaquin's 1927 record of 200 ft.
2 in. by more than nine feet. Captain
Curtice of California took second with
more than nine feet. Captain Curtice
of California took second with a throw
of Stanford placed third with another
of 204 ft. 8% in.; and Bill Sparling
record-breaking toss of 202 ft. 3% in.
Weight Records Set
As was to be expected, Eric Krenz
and Harlow Rothert hung up i)ew Big
Meet marks in the discus and shot
put, respectively. Krenz, world's dis
cus champion, broke his own meet
record in the platter-heaving event,
sending the discus out 156 ft. 2 in.,
1914 in. farther than his previous
mark. After the regular competition
was over, the curly-headed champion
attempted to break his own world's
record of 163 ft. 8% in.; and he did
get out one throw of more than 162
ft., but stepped out of the circle in
so doing. Norman McLeod of Stanford
was second in this event and Waters
of California surprised to take third.
Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, heaved the shot 49 ft. 11%
in. to break the Big Meet record of
49 ft. B*4 in. held by Hartranft. Krenz
was second with a put of 48 ft. 8% in.
and Forster third at 46 ft. 6% in.
Virgil Dowell, who has been de
veloping into a great broad-jumper
this season, leaped 24 ft. 1% in. to
better Kim Dyer's Big Meet mark of
24 ft. I*4 in. Anderson placed second
and West third to give Stanford a
clean sweep.
McKinnon Beats Carter
"Iron Man" McKinnon, the veteran
Stanford miler who has come back,
again proved that he is one of the
headiest runners that has ever worn
the Cardinal, and one of the pluckiest,
when he beat Carter of California, the
favorite in the four-lap event, to the
tape by four yards in the time of
4:29 4-5, six seconds lower than Car
ter's best time this season. McKinnon
out-gamed and out-thought his faster
opponent, and it was a great sight to
I see him come driving around the last
turn and into the stretch, sprinting
like a hundred-yard man and fighting
it out stride for stride with Carter.
Mac has a world of fight in that small
body of his, and his courage was too
much for the long-legged Californian,
who broke about thirty yards from
the finish and almost fell. Johnny
Parker took third to give Stanford six
of the nine points in this event.
Edmonds High-Pointer
Ward Edmonds as usual shared
honors with McKinnon as the Stan
ford hero, the Card vaulter being
high-point man of the day with a total
of thirteen markers to his credit. He
took his customary firsts in the pole
vault and low hurdles and second in
the highs. Ward is a tine competitive
athlete and almost as good a hurdler
as he is a vaulter —that is to say, one
of the three or four best in the coun
try. Ho was two yards behind Captain
Ross Nichols in the high barriers in
a 15 2-5 s. flight and was followed by
Rogers Smith, giving Stanford a clean
sweep. Edmonds raced the lows in
25 1-5 s., Smith taking second and
Pogolotti of California grabbing third
from Nelson. The winning height in
the pole vault was thirteen feet. The
remaining four points were divided
between two other Stanford vaulters,
Hulsman and Berry, and Scrivner of
the Bears, who tied at 12 ft. 6 in.
Hec Dyer, Teinpleton's blond sprint
flash, who, by the way, is only a
sophomore, demonstrated that he is
the fastest short-distance man to per
form for the Cardinal in many years
by breaking even time in both the
century and furlong, equalling the
Big Meet 100-yard dash record of
9 4-5 seconds. His time of 21 4-5 in
the 220 is comparatively as good. In
both races he was several yards ahead
ot Bisbee, California's best. Lauritzen
was third in the hundred and Rec
nagel, another Stanford sprinter, third
in the two-twenty.
Morrison Takes 440
Johnny Morrison, although appar
ently running a slow opening two
twenty, came through with a tremen
dous finish in the quarter-mile to win
by six yards from his teammate, Syer,
in the excellent time of 48 4-5 sec
onds. Clark of California, who led
Morrison for the first 250 yards, was
third, a yard behind Syer.
The two-mile went to Mossman of
California, a wonderful little runner
who should be breaking records be
fore his years of collegiate competi
tion are over. The red-headed Califor
nia sophomore has a beautiful, easy j
stride and ran his way to an appar
ently effortless victory in 9 m. 45 s.
Mossman set a fast pace and had no
difficulty in keeping it throughout the
eight laps, stepping away from Bob
Brown of Stanford until almost a
third of a lap separated the two at
the finish. Brown had a strong sprint
and crossed the finish line a few
yards ahead of Loofbourrow of Stan
ford.
Half-Mile Goes to U.C.
Chase of California had a little bit
more sprint in the half-mile than Tom
Neikirk of the Cards and was able to
fight off the Stanford runner's chal
lenge and break the tape two yards
in the lead. Gordon French, Neikirk's
teammate, took third.
The high jump, as expected, went
to Jacklevitch of the Bears, who
cleared 6 ft. Vi in. Second place re
sulted in a tie between Madison and
French of Stanford at 5 ft. 11 in.
The mile relay proved to be a highly
exciting affair, and it was only Mor
rison's great final lap that saved the
race for the Cards. Shove ran a good
opening lap, giving Bobby Gooden a
four-yard lead. Gooden held it fairly
well, passing the baton to McDermott
a yard ahead of the Bear second-lap
man. McDermott fell as he gave Mor
rison the baton, and the powerful
Card anchor man was three yards
back at the start of his lap. He
opened up with a terrific sprint on
the final turn, passing Clark of Cali- j
fornia and striding across the finish j
line eight yards in the lead. Tho time ,
was 3:23 2-5.

U.C.-Card Records Set in Shot Put, Discus, Broad Jump, and
Javelin; McKmnon Unexpectedly Beats Carter in Mile;
Dyer Passes Bisbee in Century to Equal Existing Time

OTANFORD'S 1929 Templeton-trained product of the track and field soundly
trounced the California Bears here Saturday 94 2-3 to 36 1-3 and in so
doing broke the Big Meet scoring record of 91 points which has withstood
the assaults of Cardinal athletes for thirty-five years. Four Big Meet records
were smashed and another equalled. This victory, the sixth in as many years
over the Bears, gives to the Cards the Pacific Coast dual meet championship
and establishes them as one of the greatest teams ever to represent Stanford
and probably the most powerful in the United States today.
The shot put, discus, javelin, and broad jump records all went by the board,
and the Big Meet mark in the hundred was tied. As for the meet records that

'were broken, all were in the field
events. The outstanding performance
of the day, undoubtedly, was the jave
lin throw of 209 ft. 7 in. by Churchill
of California, an outsider who was not
conceded even a third place in pre
meet dope sheets. This long toss bet
ters Joaquin's 1927 record of 200 ft.
2 in. by more than nine feet. Captain
Curtice of California took second with
more than nine feet. Captain Curtice
of California took second with a throw
of Stanford placed third with another
of 204 ft. 8% in.; and Bill Sparling
record-breaking toss of 202 ft. 3% in.
Weight Records Set
As was to be expected, Eric Krenz
and Harlow Rothert hung up i)ew Big
Meet marks in the discus and shot
put, respectively. Krenz, world's dis
cus champion, broke his own meet
record in the platter-heaving event,
sending the discus out 156 ft. 2 in.,
1914 in. farther than his previous
mark. After the regular competition
was over, the curly-headed champion
attempted to break his own world's
record of 163 ft. 8% in.; and he did
get out one throw of more than 162
ft., but stepped out of the circle in
so doing. Norman McLeod of Stanford
was second in this event and Waters
of California surprised to take third.
Harlow Rothert, world's indoor
champion, heaved the shot 49 ft. 11%
in. to break the Big Meet record of
49 ft. B*4 in. held by Hartranft. Krenz
was second with a put of 48 ft. 8% in.
and Forster third at 46 ft. 6% in.
Virgil Dowell, who has been de
veloping into a great broad-jumper
this season, leaped 24 ft. 1% in. to
better Kim Dyer's Big Meet mark of
24 ft. I*4 in. Anderson placed second
and West third to give Stanford a
clean sweep.
McKinnon Beats Carter
"Iron Man" McKinnon, the veteran
Stanford miler who has come back,
again proved that he is one of the
headiest runners that has ever worn
the Cardinal, and one of the pluckiest,
when he beat Carter of California, the
favorite in the four-lap event, to the
tape by four yards in the time of
4:29 4-5, six seconds lower than Car
ter's best time this season. McKinnon
out-gamed and out-thought his faster
opponent, and it was a great sight to
I see him come driving around the last
turn and into the stretch, sprinting
like a hundred-yard man and fighting
it out stride for stride with Carter.
Mac has a world of fight in that small
body of his, and his courage was too
much for the long-legged Californian,
who broke about thirty yards from
the finish and almost fell. Johnny
Parker took third to give Stanford six
of the nine points in this event.
Edmonds High-Pointer
Ward Edmonds as usual shared
honors with McKinnon as the Stan
ford hero, the Card vaulter being
high-point man of the day with a total
of thirteen markers to his credit. He
took his customary firsts in the pole
vault and low hurdles and second in
the highs. Ward is a tine competitive
athlete and almost as good a hurdler
as he is a vaulter —that is to say, one
of the three or four best in the coun
try. Ho was two yards behind Captain
Ross Nichols in the high barriers in
a 15 2-5 s. flight and was followed by
Rogers Smith, giving Stanford a clean
sweep. Edmonds raced the lows in
25 1-5 s., Smith taking second and
Pogolotti of California grabbing third
from Nelson. The winning height in
the pole vault was thirteen feet. The
remaining four points were divided
between two other Stanford vaulters,
Hulsman and Berry, and Scrivner of
the Bears, who tied at 12 ft. 6 in.
Hec Dyer, Teinpleton's blond sprint
flash, who, by the way, is only a
sophomore, demonstrated that he is
the fastest short-distance man to per
form for the Cardinal in many years
by breaking even time in both the
century and furlong, equalling the
Big Meet 100-yard dash record of
9 4-5 seconds. His time of 21 4-5 in
the 220 is comparatively as good. In
both races he was several yards ahead
ot Bisbee, California's best. Lauritzen
was third in the hundred and Rec
nagel, another Stanford sprinter, third
in the two-twenty.
Morrison Takes 440
Johnny Morrison, although appar
ently running a slow opening two
twenty, came through with a tremen
dous finish in the quarter-mile to win
by six yards from his teammate, Syer,
in the excellent time of 48 4-5 sec
onds. Clark of California, who led
Morrison for the first 250 yards, was
third, a yard behind Syer.
The two-mile went to Mossman of
California, a wonderful little runner
who should be breaking records be
fore his years of collegiate competi
tion are over. The red-headed Califor
nia sophomore has a beautiful, easy j
stride and ran his way to an appar
ently effortless victory in 9 m. 45 s.
Mossman set a fast pace and had no
difficulty in keeping it throughout the
eight laps, stepping away from Bob
Brown of Stanford until almost a
third of a lap separated the two at
the finish. Brown had a strong sprint
and crossed the finish line a few
yards ahead of Loofbourrow of Stan
ford.
Half-Mile Goes to U.C.
Chase of California had a little bit
more sprint in the half-mile than Tom
Neikirk of the Cards and was able to
fight off the Stanford runner's chal
lenge and break the tape two yards
in the lead. Gordon French, Neikirk's
teammate, took third.
The high jump, as expected, went
to Jacklevitch of the Bears, who
cleared 6 ft. Vi in. Second place re
sulted in a tie between Madison and
French of Stanford at 5 ft. 11 in.
The mile relay proved to be a highly
exciting affair, and it was only Mor
rison's great final lap that saved the
race for the Cards. Shove ran a good
opening lap, giving Bobby Gooden a
four-yard lead. Gooden held it fairly
well, passing the baton to McDermott
a yard ahead of the Bear second-lap
man. McDermott fell as he gave Mor
rison the baton, and the powerful
Card anchor man was three yards
back at the start of his lap. He
opened up with a terrific sprint on
the final turn, passing Clark of Cali- j
fornia and striding across the finish j
