# Stanford Defeats Yale
## 
### 
"Yale men are all right, but I do love Stanford."
In that brief, compound sentence, Nell O'Day, "a mere chit of an
acrobat," eighteen years old, who had come from the West, told inter
viewers from the Yale News where her heart lay. It was a great blow to
Yale's amour pro pre, because New Haven seldom shows enough enthusi
asm for a visiting figure on the theatre boards to merit the News repre
sentatives' seeking an interview, but when the actress is vouchsafed con
tact with the press, she invariably says she thinks Yale fellows are the best
in the world. Not so Nell O'Day, and so startling was her espousal of
Stanford in preference to Yale, that the Yale Alumni Weekly makes the
following editorial of the episode: (Incidentally, no one hereabouts, not
even Gordon Davis, seems to have any idea as to who Nell O'Day may be
or in what manner she experienced our charm.)
? Capitulation
Nurtured, like the son of John Stuart Mill, to a profound mistrust of
all things human, the average undergraduate is rarely found to commit
himself on any question at all. The easy skepticism of the college man
(sometimes called Harvard Indifference, a term that has its origin in the
fact that Harvard was the country's first large college; hence the character
istic was first discerned there and by a not unnatural metonymy identified
with Harvard) —the easy skepticism of the «_allege man is his most typical
and most valuable distinction, giving him individuality, setting him apart
from the impressionable and credulous world like a patent of nobility. Not
the less real is this distinction for its ineluctable transiency; though he
soon becomes as trusting and as resiliency hopeful as other humans, for a
time he is a detached and lordly laugher at the world's manoeuvres to attract
him. He is in that happy period of suspension when he perceives the essen
tial futility of all enthusiasms, and hovers for a term, all-seeing, before he
dons his blinkers and finds his niche. Wiser than he ever will be again, he
knows that all opinions are unsound, all tastes treacherous, all causes foolish
and all effort wasted. Thus he will hold, indulge, support or apply none
of them.
Is this air solipsism never to be penetrated nor dissolved until, after his
graduation, the relentless world beats it slowly down? Yes, occasionally;
but only via the heart, which, however, once touched, reacts like a ripe to
mato. The undergraduate's moments of real zeal are so few as to be dan
gerous. So when he is aroused to the point of demonstrative approbation,
he is apt to present a spectacle of the most singular fatuity. Witness the
voluntary immersion of all Oxford in the weedy Isis when Zuleika Dobson
gave the signal.
Well, Yale, too, has had her Zuleika, just last week; and although we
came through relatively dry-shod, it was not done without making a some
what gory pageant of our so bravely concealed, so distantly denied emotion
alism. A glowingly feminine Lochiuvar, she came out of the West with a
five-a-day variety act called "Laces and Graces," one of the John Murray
Anderson Publix Revue Numbers. Her name is Nell O'Day. Her act con
sisted entirely in her being hurled to and fro on the arms of a half-dozen
chorus men. Unlike Dobson, she cannot extract a full-blown goose from
the collar of the red gentleman in the third row. Yet she wears on her
belt the cardiac scalps of half of Yale College, and received from each local
audience more reboant rounds of ecstatic applause than the walls of the
Olympia are likel) r to hear for many years to come. Herein may be studied
at its most paradoxical the behavior of the affections of "the most critical
audience in the country," as New Haven is known among the Thespians.
Alice Brady, Ethel Barrymore can pass through town without eliciting so
much as a nod of critical recognition ; while a mere chit of an acrobat who
has not been on the stage three weeks sets a throng on its ear. She did this
with no aids but those of a radiant personality and an instinct for coquetry,
as follows:
Appearing on the same bill with Douglas Fairbanks, she was bound
to be seen, unawares, by a certain number of undergraduates. To these, the
vanguard of her following, her rare beauty was sufficient cause for telling
their friends. Her fame grew. By her tenth performance she was enough
of a toast to draw down some News reporters for an interview. And at this
juncture she brought her art-concealing art of charm into play. The inter
ested but sophisticated interviewers, who had never talked with an actress
who did not tell them that she thought Yale men were the best fellows in
the world, asked her the usual question, expecting to receive vicariously
Yale's usual meed of praise. "Yale men are all right," was her subversive
reply, "but 1 do love Stanford." The reporters were aghast. It was with
difficulty, but increased excitement, that they were able to carry on the
interview. In a nervous trance they jotted down her other statements, that
she was eighteen years old, that her co-workers were very kind, that she
was interested in Asiatic history. Suddenly she expressed the hope "that she
might see Yale from a more intimate viewpoint; but," says the Nezvs, "she
successfully parried the immediate efforts of the News representatives to
satisfy her request."
When this interview was published, Yale apathy throughout the Uni
versity was roused to angry fascination. Who was this woman who refused
to bow the knee, who offered up her sacrifices at a foreign shrine? Stan
ford, indeed. Thousands flcKked to see her. She must be brought to terms.
With the wily humility that true egotism displays when rebuffed, the under
graduate turned out cn masse to do her honor. But though he came to win
her, he remained to be won. From each performance issued new converts to
her rosy grace, her supernal tints. She was beset with floral tributes, with
invitations to the dance. A frenzied canvass was engineered by the News
in the hope of cutting down Stanford's lead in the race for her affections.
On the last day here, even the lethargic management of the Olympia Thea
ter realized that something was afoot, and belatedly, superfluously adver
tised her name in headlines. When her train, the O'Day Flyer, bore her
away to fresh triumphs in the north, most of the University was on hand
at the station; frantic students tried to secrete themselves amid the rods and
gaskets of her car, or, disguised as lanterns, squatted with sly fatuity on
the observation platform ; and when her waving handkerchief vanished down
the track, the vaunted self-possession of the Yale undergratduate deli
quesced in a flood of tears.
