CONCERNING CAMPUS OPINION
The Editor, Sir:
The atmosphere of Campus Opin
ion In the past few days has been
highly reminiscent of one of the good
old mud-slinging campaigns which
used to rage in this fair land of ours
every election-time. Without in any
way attempting to take sides in the
prohibition controversy, I would like
to make a few suggestions to those
who would do so, in the interest of
both peace an intelligibility:
1. Personalities are not arguments.
If a man whom I hated like the devil
told me my house was burning down,
I should be more inclined to sprint in
the direction of my house than to stop
and swear at him for telling me
something 1 don't like to believe.
2. Don't be too subtle. Martin
Frankel might be interested to know
that his IG-point satire summarizing
the arguments "for" prohibition was
so subtle that it left some people in
doubt as to whether it was serious
or not. As a matter of fact, some of
the arguments he satirized are per
pectly good points for prohibition, to
which he merely adds a vague, bitter
comment, without any clearly logical
effort to disprove them. Such an at
tempt was bound to be misunderstood.
3. More facts and less rhetoric. It
is true that prohibitionists are apt to
fall into a flag-waving attitude: "It
is right because it is the law." But I
believe it is no less true that wets
are unable to refrain from munching
on the luscious words "pussyfooter,"
"hypocrite," "Aunty-everything," and
so on, spewing them out at every pos
sible opportunity, to the elimination
ot any attempt at making a point.
And do people who deify the term
"personal liberty" believe in Santa
Claus? It should be obvious that
there is just so much "free" liberty
floating around this earth, and that
beyond this amount one cannot go
without getting Into common prop
erty. A world without restraints
would be a fine mess, unless man
were a much nobler being than he
is now.
It may seem that I have pointed
more at the wets than the drys. If
so, it is only because it has not yet
been sufficiently noted that many of
the arguments used by the wets are
as full of prejudice and intolerance
as those they laugh at in the drys. I
am for some sort of modification my
self, but mainly because of the psy
chological effect, rather than any

| hope that modification would greatly
j better existing conditions in any oth
:er way. Would that more wets could
| admit that the real strength of their
; movement has lain in the unreason
able but entirely human fact that, ir
i respective of the justice of the matter,
i people, especially those of the upper
classes, do not like to have to submit
j to any restraints upon their individual
| liberty, whether they would actually
like to exercise that liberty or not.

"NO REIGN OF MORALITY"
Now that the "shouting and the
tumult" has died, 1 feel safe in ven
turing a statement. I am not attempt
ing to institute a reign of morality
upon the Stanford campus; neither
am I the "blue-nosed killjoy" which
some have said. My purpose during
the recent Prohibition controversy has
been the entirely sincere one of at
tempting to uphold what I consider to
be right in the matter.
As far as the outcome of the stu
dent vote is concerned, I confess I
was indeed surprised. I had expected
Prohobition in all its manifestations
to be overwhelmingly renounced. In
stead, the Eighteenth Amendment was
upheld. Students generally resent
anything which they think is being
forced upon them by their elders;
such is Prohibition. I suggest that the
vote would never have been held had
the "Daily" believed the result would
be otherwise than it was. (Solely my
personal opinion.)
However, we are in a strange mud
dle. The Campus repulsed what it
thought to be the terrors of Prohibi
tion, such as the Volstead Act, and
retained the Eighteenth Amendment.
It was afraid to entirely renounce the
principle of Prohibition, and tried to
•circumvent it by taking away its
props. Seemingly, students believe in
Prohibition as one of those lofty
ideals of a super-society good to have
about, but very, very unpleasant to
apply. Mankind does try so hard to
retard its own progress.
Of course, we know that the right
will win out; that confidence saves us
many times from becoming pessimists.
When we consider how long man has
been on the earth, how long it has
taken him to get where he is now, a
few years more or less really makes
no difference in the moral progress
of civilization.
Sincerely,
—Sturgis Riddle
