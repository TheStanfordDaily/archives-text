S Wings of Wax. By Janet Hoyt. (New
York: J. H. Sears & Co., Inc. $2.50.)
Since the war a great flood of youth
has poured into universities all over
the country, and more especially into
the coeducational state universities.
I Many of these young people have
I come from homes where "the only
| reading was the newspaper." They
I have come with a general desire "to
i better themselves," seeking "not life,
j but the means of livelihood." Where
I 2 ; 000 were once, ten times that num
ber swarm now. In such a huge, in
choate mass unity and fellowship are
' necessarily lost, the crowd becoming
I as impersonal as that of any city.
J This situation has created many new
! problems, and it is of these problems,
j and one man's attempt at dealing with
j them, that Janet Hoyt's novel is prin
| cipally concerned.
Woban, a Middle Western coedu
| cational state university, is the scene
j of the story, which begins with the
| coming to Woban of its newly elect
| ed president, Victor Marston. Still
under 40, Marston was tall, handsome,
! and full of charm, a man for whom
i people, women especially, had "taken
j trouble all his life." Enthusiastic, a
j sentimentalist and an idealist, he was
! full of inchoate ideas and visionary
faith in the "glowing characteristics"
of the youth of the present day. He
was also vain. Admiration was the
very breath of life to him, and he
could get on only with those who
burned incense to him. And he had
no clearly defined code, no philosophy
of life. He knew he was going some
where; he fancied he was soaring
high; but his goal was, so to speak,
the sky in general. His intentions
were good, and he was kindly dis
posed toward the world at large, and
| especially toward that part of it that.
! was young, pretty, female, and ador
| ing. Given to snap judgments, a mor
al coward, ho was nevertheless a man
whose personal appeal was all but ir
resistible. What he did to Woban,
and what Woban did to him, makes
tlie narrative.
It is an extremely long, very de
j tailed account of th'e difficulties con
fronting the executive of a big uni
versity, problems many of which cen
ter about the question of sex equal
ity. Many of these problems are il
lustrated by the histories of individual 1
students who in one way or another
come in contact with the president,
from pretty, extremely modern Betty

Chalmers, who proves that she really
is able to take care of herself, to her
no less pretty chum, Edith Ebberley.
who only fancies she possesses that
the conscientious student, head of the
Women's Self - Government Associa
tion, who so quickly won Marston's
dislike, to Amy Narbath, one of the
objects of his sentimental clemency.
Marston accepted much of the patter
of the day: "The young people of to
day . . . won't be reasonable until
they learn that we will be reasonable
too," he declares, and calls the women
students "sensible girls, with more
sound judgment, every one of them,
than the women over them." This
sentimental idealism of Marston's
comes into sharp conflict with things
as they are. Then there are the in
trigues, the financial matters, the in
fluence of the alumni and of athletics,
and with all these the complications
of Marston's personal life. If the
novel is a very long, it is also a very
full one; there are several sensational
episodes, but they are not treated in
a sensational manner. Of the book's
accuracy only those familiar with
present-day conditions in such places
as Woban are competent to judge; to
the Eastern reader it seems unexag
gerated and real, as well as decidedly
interesting, while the characterization
is excellent throughout. "Wings of
Wax" is a careful, conscientious study
of certain aspects of modern educa
tion as they affect character. If its
conclusion seems rather forced, the
general course of the narrative is
logical, and, though one finds some
difficulty in believing in his scientific
attainments and brilliancy as an in
vestigator, Marston is a real person,
drawn with skill and in the round.

the Eastern reader it seems unexag

interesting, while the characterization
is excellent throughout. "Wings of

of certain aspects of modern educa
tion as they affect character. If its
conclusion seems rather forced, the

logical, and, though one finds some

Marston accepted much of the patter
of the day: "The young people of to
day . . . won't be reasonable until
they learn that we will be reasonable
too," he declares, and calls the women
students "sensible girls, with more
sound judgment, every one of them,
than the women over them." This
sentimental idealism of Marston's
comes into sharp conflict with things
as they are. Then there are the in
trigues, the financial matters, the in
fluence of the alumni and of athletics,
and with all these the complications
of Marston's personal life. If the
novel is a very long, it is also a very
full one; there are several sensational
episodes, but they are not treated in
a sensational manner. Of the book's
accuracy only those familiar with
present-day conditions in such places
as Woban are competent to judge; to
the Eastern reader it seems unexag
gerated and real, as well as decidedly
interesting, while the characterization
is excellent throughout. "Wings of
Wax" is a careful, conscientious study
of certain aspects of modern educa
tion as they affect character. If its
conclusion seems rather forced, the
general course of the narrative is
logical, and, though one finds some
difficulty in believing in his scientific
attainments and brilliancy as an in
vestigator, Marston is a real person,
drawn with skill and in the round.
S Wings of Wax. By Janet Hoyt. (New
York: J. H. Sears & Co., Inc. $2.50.)
Since the war a great flood of youth
has poured into universities all over
the country, and more especially into
the coeducational state universities.
I Many of these young people have
I come from homes where "the only
| reading was the newspaper." They
I have come with a general desire "to
i better themselves," seeking "not life,
j but the means of livelihood." Where
I 2 ; 000 were once, ten times that num
ber swarm now. In such a huge, in
choate mass unity and fellowship are
' necessarily lost, the crowd becoming
I as impersonal as that of any city.
J This situation has created many new
! problems, and it is of these problems,
j and one man's attempt at dealing with
j them, that Janet Hoyt's novel is prin
| cipally concerned.
Woban, a Middle Western coedu
| cational state university, is the scene
j of the story, which begins with the
| coming to Woban of its newly elect
| ed president, Victor Marston. Still
under 40, Marston was tall, handsome,
! and full of charm, a man for whom
i people, women especially, had "taken
j trouble all his life." Enthusiastic, a
j sentimentalist and an idealist, he was
! full of inchoate ideas and visionary
faith in the "glowing characteristics"
of the youth of the present day. He
was also vain. Admiration was the
very breath of life to him, and he
could get on only with those who
burned incense to him. And he had
no clearly defined code, no philosophy
of life. He knew he was going some
where; he fancied he was soaring
high; but his goal was, so to speak,
the sky in general. His intentions
were good, and he was kindly dis
posed toward the world at large, and
| especially toward that part of it that.
! was young, pretty, female, and ador
| ing. Given to snap judgments, a mor
al coward, ho was nevertheless a man
whose personal appeal was all but ir
resistible. What he did to Woban,
and what Woban did to him, makes
tlie narrative.
It is an extremely long, very de
j tailed account of th'e difficulties con
fronting the executive of a big uni
versity, problems many of which cen
ter about the question of sex equal
ity. Many of these problems are il
lustrated by the histories of individual 1
students who in one way or another
come in contact with the president,
from pretty, extremely modern Betty

Chalmers, who proves that she really
is able to take care of herself, to her
no less pretty chum, Edith Ebberley.

Women's Self - Government Associa

dislike, to Amy Narbath, one of the
objects of his sentimental clemency.
