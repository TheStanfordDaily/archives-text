The following column was censored
two weeks ago. Since that time the
j editor of this department has been
at his country estate at Sulking-on
the-Gripe awaiting protests from well
wishers and other readers. When j
none came, it just didn't seem worth
' while going on. Then we hit upon a
simple Truth. How true it is that the
commonest things escape us, or the
police, anyhow. Probably none of our
readers can write! And there you j
have it in a nutshell, or have you?
At any rate, i.e.—
What with spring coming on and !
stockings coming off, we have decid- j
ed to be lazy for the nonce and let a
local advertising man turn out the j
column for today. He doesn't know |
he is funuy, but he may become a 1
regular contributor —who knows?
WHOOPEE! A Silent Production
COLLEEN MOORE in
"Why Be Good?"
Right from the shoulder. Right at
your heart. The real lowdown on
Flaming Youth.
Also Vitaphone Acts
A comedy scream from start to finish
Of course, what Vitaphone act isn't?

"Cohens and Kellys in Atlantic City"
You've seen them in New York —
You've seen them in Paris —Now

WOW!
Sure, that's the word—WOW!
"Absolutely the funniest picture
ever made"
It'd have to go some to beat "Abie's
Irish Rose." Boy!
"We guarantee that this is the
World's Funniest Picture. Come
prepared to laugh harder than
you've ever laughed before."
These exhausting preparations!
And then . . .
"The Sin of Sins"!
The Picture of Pictures!
Not to mention . . .
Hear William Boyd make love under !
an Oriental Moon. You'll marvel — |
You'll thrill —You'll cheer!
That is, unless you're pretty much of
an old crank.
WHOOPEE!
He was strong as an oak. She clung
like ivy—but he didn't mind a bit. . .
A trainload of comedy hooked to a
locomotive of action.
Wouldn't the gentleman be surprised
if he saw one of the pictures!

The following column was censored
two weeks ago. Since that time the
j editor of this department has been
at his country estate at Sulking-on
the-Gripe awaiting protests from well
wishers and other readers. When j
none came, it just didn't seem worth
' while going on. Then we hit upon a
simple Truth. How true it is that the
commonest things escape us, or the
police, anyhow. Probably none of our
readers can write! And there you j
have it in a nutshell, or have you?
At any rate, i.e.—
What with spring coming on and !
stockings coming off, we have decid- j
ed to be lazy for the nonce and let a
local advertising man turn out the j
column for today. He doesn't know |
he is funuy, but he may become a 1
regular contributor —who knows?
WHOOPEE! A Silent Production
COLLEEN MOORE in
"Why Be Good?"
Right from the shoulder. Right at
your heart. The real lowdown on

WOW!
Sure, that's the word—WOW!
"Absolutely the funniest picture
ever made"
It'd have to go some to beat "Abie's
Irish Rose." Boy!
"We guarantee that this is the
World's Funniest Picture. Come
prepared to laugh harder than
you've ever laughed before."
These exhausting preparations!
And then . . .
"The Sin of Sins"!
The Picture of Pictures!
Not to mention . . .
Hear William Boyd make love under !
an Oriental Moon. You'll marvel — |
You'll thrill —You'll cheer!
That is, unless you're pretty much of
an old crank.
WHOOPEE!
He was strong as an oak. She clung
like ivy—but he didn't mind a bit. . .
A trainload of comedy hooked to a
locomotive of action.
Wouldn't the gentleman be surprised
if he saw one of the pictures!
