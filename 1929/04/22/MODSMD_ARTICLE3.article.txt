SAN DIEGO, April 21. (/P)â€”Six per
sons were killed here today when a
passenger carrying plane of the Mad
dux Air Line was struck in mid-air by
an army pursuit plane which was fly
ing overhead and suddenly lost alti
tude.
The crash came at an elevation of
2,000 feet a few minutes after the
Maddux plane had started from a lo
cal field for Phoenix, Arizona.
All occupants of both planes were
killed.
J. E. Bishop, a ground eye-witness,
said that both planes fell suddenly
due to an atmospheric condition but
the army plane came down with
greater speed, striking the Maddux
machine on the right wing.
The army plane then fell clear of
the passenger machine and Lieuten
ant Glen H. Keefer at the controls,
jumped. His parachute caught on the
wing of his descending plane and he
struck the ground and was dead when
reached.
The large Maddux plane fell like a
wounded bird, carrying to death Hor
ace H. Murphy, pilot, L. D. Pratt, re
lief pilot, and three passengers, A. D.
Duajardo, his daughter Amelia, 18,
and a "Miss Kelly" who was bound
for Phoenix, the passenger list showed.
