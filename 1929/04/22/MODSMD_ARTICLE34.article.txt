# SPORTS OF 1929
## The 						Melrose Marvel 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Listed in "Who's Who in American
Sports" just ahead of Jack Dempsey,
you will find the following: "DeMar,
Clarence Harrison, U.S. Marathon
champion. Born: Madena, Ohio, June
7, 1888. Son of George Washington
and Caro Davidson (Abbott) De Mar.
Ed.: Farm and Trade Sch., (Boston);
Maple Lawn Acad. (Vt.); Univ. of Vt.;
Univ. Extension, A.A. Harvard, 1915."
Then follows his remarkable ath
letic record, with marathon victories
in important races from 1911, when
he was 23, to 1928, when he was 40,
and ends with the following interest
ing items: "Pres. Occupation: Com
positor. Ward Record: In service
from May 1918 to Aug. 1919; Mem.
A.E.F., Co. 1, 301 st Inf. Affiliations:
Amer. Legion (Chaplain, Melrose
Post No. 90); First Baptist Church
(Melrose); Typographical Union No.
13; Scoutmaster in Boy Scouts; Odd
Fellows."
What do you make of a man like
that, who, in spite of setting type all
day, has time to be a Legion chaplain,
a Boy Scout Master, a Sunday School
teacher, and America's greatest mara
thon runner at the age of 40?
Up to the 1929 Boston Marathon
(that little jaunt of 26 miles, 385
yards, held annually on Patriots' Day

from Hopkinton to the heart of the
Hub), DeMar had won six of these
gruelling races, not to speak of nu
merous other long distance runs. He
won the Patriots' Day race in 1927
and 1928, and his first victory came
eighteen years ago! DeMar trains al
most entirely by running to and from
his work, and is truly a remarkable
figure in American athletics.
I made a sketch of him on the
"President Roosevelt" as the Olympic
team returned from Amsterdam, and
couldn't help but be impressed with
the fine, well-modelled, scholarly head
he had on his shoulders. He uses that
splendid old noodle when he runs, too.

you will find the following: "DeMar,
Clarence Harrison, U.S. Marathon
champion. Born: Madena, Ohio, June
7, 1888. Son of George Washington
and Caro Davidson (Abbott) De Mar.
Ed.: Farm and Trade Sch., (Boston);
Maple Lawn Acad. (Vt.); Univ. of Vt.;
Univ. Extension, A.A. Harvard, 1915."
Then follows his remarkable ath
letic record, with marathon victories
in important races from 1911, when
he was 23, to 1928, when he was 40,
and ends with the following interest
ing items: "Pres. Occupation: Com
positor. Ward Record: In service
from May 1918 to Aug. 1919; Mem.
A.E.F., Co. 1, 301 st Inf. Affiliations:
Amer. Legion (Chaplain, Melrose
Post No. 90); First Baptist Church
(Melrose); Typographical Union No.
13; Scoutmaster in Boy Scouts; Odd
Fellows."
What do you make of a man like
that, who, in spite of setting type all
day, has time to be a Legion chaplain,
a Boy Scout Master, a Sunday School
teacher, and America's greatest mara
thon runner at the age of 40?
Up to the 1929 Boston Marathon
(that little jaunt of 26 miles, 385
yards, held annually on Patriots' Day

from Hopkinton to the heart of the
Hub), DeMar had won six of these
gruelling races, not to speak of nu
merous other long distance runs. He
won the Patriots' Day race in 1927
and 1928, and his first victory came
eighteen years ago! DeMar trains al
most entirely by running to and from
his work, and is truly a remarkable
figure in American athletics.
I made a sketch of him on the
"President Roosevelt" as the Olympic
team returned from Amsterdam, and
couldn't help but be impressed with
the fine, well-modelled, scholarly head
he had on his shoulders. He uses that
splendid old noodle when he runs, too.
