MAKING HISTORY
Every Dig Meet makes history
in a certain sense, but the one
Saturday was so outstanding that
a textbook could well be written
about it. The old Stanford-Cali
fornia high-score record stood for
thirty-six years and we wonder
if the sports writers thirty-six
years from now will still be com
menting about "the 94 to 36
victory that has never been
broken."
Maybe they will and maybe they
won't, but they will look back on the
Big Meet of 1929 with the same self
satisfied smiles with which the pres
ent-day moderns regard the meet of
1893 with its bicycle races, woolen
track suits, and woefully weak rec
ords.
During the couhse of Saturday's
colorful contest four Big Meet
records were established. "These
marks will stand for a mighty
long time," was the remark passed
by a correspondent as he munched
a ham sandwich in the press box.
Back in 1893 they probably said
the same thing. But as long as scien
tific principles are applied to athletic
events and as long as Stanford gets
a freshman class with potential track
material, Big Meet marks will con
tinue to be bettered.
Whether one is an optimist or a
pessimist depends on how he re
gards the following: at the con
clusion of Saturday's contest, the
Cardinals lost twelve men who
accounted for 36 points—36 7-12
to be exact. Edmonds, Nichols,
McKinnon, Lauritzen, Syer, Loof
bourrow, Forster, Sparling, Huls
man, Anderson, G. French, and
Gooden competed in their last Big
Meet for Stanford.
To balance this loss is the crop of
promising sophomores and juniors
coming up for next season. On the
other hand this year's freshman squad
was not as powerful as aggregations
in the past have been. Rather dismal.
But the catch of the whole mat- k
ter remains that Stanford's teams
are coached by one of the fore
most strategists in the United
States. Dink Templeton can be
depended on to bring out the best
in any bunch of recruits and to
develop a team that will take as
many points as its quality affords.
The Cards will still be supreme
for many years to come.
Even a coach has his human side.
Bobby Gooden has worked hard for
three years, but his best was not quite
good enough for him to receive a
Block "S." Dink put Gooden in the
relay and took a chance on the out
come and breaking the 91-point rec
ord. Bobby fulfilled Dink's trust and
finished his lap two yards in the lead
and won his letter.
As long as such a spirit exists
track is never in danger of be
coming a cut-and-dried commer
cial proposition and will remain
the king of competitive sports.
