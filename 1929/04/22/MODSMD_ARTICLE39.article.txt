# STANFORD CONVALESCENT HOME IS GOVERNED BY SOUND. EFFICIENT FINANCIAL DIRECTORS
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
Efficiency in every detail is found
in the Stanford Convalescent Homo.
Particularly in the financial organ
ization of Stanford's own charity is
this American characteristic of get- ;
ting the most out of every dollar to
be seen. Students can be sure that j
in giving their money to the campus j
home for convalescent children that j
they will get 100 per cent return on j
the money invested. The A.S.S.U. |
Drive for funds commences April 29. !
During the past year there were ;
16,701 "child days" at the Home. This
means that the 155 children who were j
cared for stayed an average of nearly |
104 days each. If all the beds which ,
were available had been occupied all j
the time, there would have been 16,880 ,
"child days" used, so that the occu- j
pancy was actually 98.7 per cent of .
the possible number of children. Com
pared to the figure for other years,
this is a "remarkably high per cent,"
according to Dr. D. Charles Gardner
who is chairman of the Board of
Trustees of the Home. "The occu- [
pancy is always very high," said Dr. j
Gardner. Since 1924 it has been 91.6, !
99.4, 98.4, and 98.7 per cent.
By the recent figures included In
the report of John Pearce Mitchell, j
treasurer of the Home, it has been j
found that it cost $2.35 in 1928 to care j
for one child one day. This is a de- I
crease from 1927 when the cost of |
one child was $2.57. The distribution
of the cost per child per day fol-1
lows:
Subsistence $0.59 or 25%
Clothing $0.06 or 2.5% j
Education, recreaTlon .. $0.01 or 0.5% j
Operation, maintenance $0.53 or 23%
Administration and gen
eral operation $1.11 or 47%
Medical treatment $0.05 or 2%
Cost per day $2.35 or 100%
The student contributions to the
Home form a substantial part of the |
income. Last year the students raised 1
$2500 in their Drive, and this aided j
very materially in the operation of the !
charity.
The income for the Convalescent I
Home comes from several different ,
sources. In 1928 the interest from the [
endowments on the Home amounted 1
to $5,400, and the operating receipts j
from parents of children who wished j
to pay for part of the expenses came >
to $7,618. From organizations Npnd
donations of goods came $1,969, and

the contributions from the San Fran
cisco and San Jose Community Chests
came to $16,430. This includes all the
sources of income to the Home except
that variable amount which is given
by individuals each year for the main
' tenance of the children.
Individuals sent Stanford's charity
$5,961 last year to aid in running the
| Home for the children. As the stu
ident Drive netted $2,500, it can be
seen that the annual A.S.S.U. Drive
I for funds plays a large part in the
i financial administration of the Home.
Il is hoped by the students managing
[ the Drive to secure a larger sum this
; year as there is now a new building
jon the grounds, the Babcock unit
| which was opened to twenty children
last September.
