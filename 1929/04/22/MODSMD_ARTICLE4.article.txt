# U.C. BEATS STANFORD IN FINAL GAME, 9-8, SWEEPING BIG SERIES
## Laird, Wilton Lead Cardinal Attack; Laird Elected Captain for 1929 
### 
California defeated Stanford on the
diamond here Saturday by a score of
9 to 8, to make a clean sweep of the
series and take their first California
Intercollegiate Baseball Conference
championship.
As a ball game it was a fitting finale
to the full day of sports held here
with Stanford threatening seriously in
the late innings to the extent of six
runs, and driving Norm Horner, lead
ing and undefeated Conference pitcher,
from the box the first time this season.
The Cards walked into the lead in
the second, when Wright hit a fluke
homer through Powers, Bear center
fielder, and scored Laird ahead of
him. California evened things up in
their half of the fourth, on a single,
triple, and a neat squeeze play. In the
following frame the Bears tallied two
more on an error, two walks, and a
single. In the eighth the Berkeleyans
again scored on four safe blows and a
sacrifice.
The Cards came back strong in their
half of the same frame, filing the bases
on a muffed throw, a single, and a
pass. Then Bill Laird came through
with a homer over the left field wall,
scoring three men ahead. It was
Laird's fourth straight hit of the day,
and put the Cards to within one run
of the Bear total.
Spud Harder was the fourth Stan
ford pitcher to enter the game; he
walked Stevenson, and the latter ad
vanced on a passed ball, and scored
on Valianos' infield hit. This run
proved to be the winning margin.
Hunken and Staley singled to start
the ninth, Berg was out to the infield,
Hardy walked, and the former two
scored when Valianos bungled John
son's hot grounder to short. Laird
walked and Horner was removed in
favor of Schmidt. Wright grounded
into a double play, Hardy being
j thrown out at the plate, and Wyatt
I getting the ball to first in time to
| catch Wright. The Cards missed a
beautiful chance to tie things up; a
j chance that might have been realized
on a squeeze play.
Third Baseman Bill Laird was
I elected to captain the Card varsity
I in 1930. Laird has played a fine brand
|of ball all year, and was a leading
i hitter of the team. Frank Wilton
j played his last game for a Stanford
! team Saturday, getting three safeties
| Mid turning in an excellent fielding
performance.

California defeated Stanford on the
diamond here Saturday by a score of
9 to 8, to make a clean sweep of the
series and take their first California
Intercollegiate Baseball Conference
championship.
As a ball game it was a fitting finale
to the full day of sports held here
with Stanford threatening seriously in
the late innings to the extent of six
runs, and driving Norm Horner, lead
ing and undefeated Conference pitcher,
from the box the first time this season.
The Cards walked into the lead in
the second, when Wright hit a fluke
homer through Powers, Bear center
fielder, and scored Laird ahead of
him. California evened things up in
their half of the fourth, on a single,
triple, and a neat squeeze play. In the
following frame the Bears tallied two
more on an error, two walks, and a
single. In the eighth the Berkeleyans
again scored on four safe blows and a
sacrifice.
The Cards came back strong in their
half of the same frame, filing the bases
on a muffed throw, a single, and a
pass. Then Bill Laird came through
with a homer over the left field wall,
scoring three men ahead. It was
Laird's fourth straight hit of the day,
and put the Cards to within one run
of the Bear total.
Spud Harder was the fourth Stan
ford pitcher to enter the game; he
walked Stevenson, and the latter ad
vanced on a passed ball, and scored
on Valianos' infield hit. This run
proved to be the winning margin.
Hunken and Staley singled to start
the ninth, Berg was out to the infield,
Hardy walked, and the former two
scored when Valianos bungled John
son's hot grounder to short. Laird
walked and Horner was removed in
favor of Schmidt. Wright grounded
into a double play, Hardy being
j thrown out at the plate, and Wyatt
I getting the ball to first in time to
| catch Wright. The Cards missed a
beautiful chance to tie things up; a
j chance that might have been realized
on a squeeze play.
Third Baseman Bill Laird was
I elected to captain the Card varsity
I in 1930. Laird has played a fine brand
|of ball all year, and was a leading
i hitter of the team. Frank Wilton
j played his last game for a Stanford

California defeated Stanford on the
diamond here Saturday by a score of
9 to 8, to make a clean sweep of the
series and take their first California
Intercollegiate Baseball Conference
championship.
As a ball game it was a fitting finale
to the full day of sports held here
with Stanford threatening seriously in
the late innings to the extent of six
runs, and driving Norm Horner, lead
ing and undefeated Conference pitcher,
from the box the first time this season.
The Cards walked into the lead in
the second, when Wright hit a fluke
homer through Powers, Bear center
fielder, and scored Laird ahead of
him. California evened things up in
their half of the fourth, on a single,
triple, and a neat squeeze play. In the
following frame the Bears tallied two
more on an error, two walks, and a
single. In the eighth the Berkeleyans
again scored on four safe blows and a
sacrifice.
The Cards came back strong in their
half of the same frame, filing the bases
on a muffed throw, a single, and a
pass. Then Bill Laird came through
with a homer over the left field wall,
scoring three men ahead. It was
Laird's fourth straight hit of the day,
and put the Cards to within one run
of the Bear total.
Spud Harder was the fourth Stan
ford pitcher to enter the game; he
walked Stevenson, and the latter ad
vanced on a passed ball, and scored
on Valianos' infield hit. This run
proved to be the winning margin.
Hunken and Staley singled to start
the ninth, Berg was out to the infield,
Hardy walked, and the former two
scored when Valianos bungled John
son's hot grounder to short. Laird
walked and Horner was removed in
favor of Schmidt. Wright grounded
into a double play, Hardy being
j thrown out at the plate, and Wyatt
I getting the ball to first in time to
| catch Wright. The Cards missed a
beautiful chance to tie things up; a
j chance that might have been realized
on a squeeze play.
Third Baseman Bill Laird was
I elected to captain the Card varsity
I in 1930. Laird has played a fine brand
|of ball all year, and was a leading
i hitter of the team. Frank Wilton
j played his last game for a Stanford
! team Saturday, getting three safeties
| Mid turning in an excellent fielding
performance.
