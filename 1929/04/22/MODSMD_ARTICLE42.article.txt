# Dean McCowan Compares Four Gospels In Lecture
## 
### 
That the Gospel of Mark was the
first to he written is the conclusion
of modern investigators who study
the early histories of the four gospels
and compare them, according to Dean
C. C. McCowan of the Pacific School
of Religion in a lecture last night.
He said further that Luke added
personal knowledge and a lost docu
ment known as "Q" and wrote the
gospel named for him, and that Mat
thew added much material of Jewish
origin to the documents of Luke. The
gospel of John, which must have been
written at a later date, is thought to
have been intended as a mystical ap
preciation of the character of Jesus.
