# CARD TENNIS TEAM BEATS U.C PLAYERS
## Win Fourth Straight Victory As Frosh Lose to Bear Racquet Wielders 
### 
Making a clean sweep of the
matches, Stanford's varsity tennis
team chalked np its fourth straight
victory over the racquet wielders of
tlie University of California in the
annual matches played on the Car
dinal courts Saturday morning. The
Bear cubs evened up the honors of
the day, however, by scoring a 5 to 0
win over the Stanford youngsters.
Careful defensive playing and only
occasional streaks of brilliant offen
sive work marked most of the singles
matches. The doubles matches on the
whole were fast and hard fought with
good net work featuring the playing
of both teams.
The only one of the varsity singles
matches to be won in straight sets
was that between John Doeg, number
1 man on the Cardinal team, and Cap
tain Rick Hoogs of California. Doeg
took the first set with little trouble
but in the second was forced to 8-6
before winning. Chuck Weesner was
apparently way off form during the
first two sets of his match with Nebo
Chasseur, number 2 man on the Ber
keley squad, winning the first 8-6 and
losing the second 4-6. In the deciding
set, however, he rallied and held his
opponent to one game.
After losing the first set to Brick
Budge, 4-6, Captain Wheatley came
back to win the next two 6-3, 7-5.
Budge put up a hard fight but was
not equal to the fast playing that
Wheatley displayed in the final set.
The closest doubles match was that
between Easton and Driscoll of Stan
ford and Hoogs and Budge of Cali
fornia. This match was featured by
Easton's accurate net playing.
Following are the complete results:
Singles—Doeg d. Hoogs 6-4, 8-6; Wees
ner d. Chasseur 8-6, 4-6, 6-1; Wheatley
d. Budge 4-6, 6-3, 7-5. Doubles —Hall-
Farwell d. Ward-McKee 6-3, 6-4; Eas
ton-Driscoll d. Hoogs-Budge 6-4, 8-6.
Handicapped by the loss of Ban
croft and Hickman, first and third
ranking players who were declared
ineligible, Stanford's freshmen were
no match for the hard-hitting Califor
nia youngsters. The Bear cubs won
all but one of the doubles matches in
straight sets.
George Forney, number 2 man on
the Cardinal squad, displayed the best
brand of tennis for the losers, but fell
before Ludlow of California 6-4, 6-4.
Forney and Bergstrom, playing to
gether in the doubles match, won the
first set 2-6, but weakened in the
next two and lost the match, 2-6, 6-3,
6-2.
Following are the complete results:
Singles-Hyde d. Williams 6-3, 6-2;
Ludlow d. Forney 6-4, 6-4; Ribble d.
Logan 6-2, 6-2. Doubles —Smith and
Dean d. Bergstrom and Forney 2-6,
6-3, 6-2; Becker and Conrad d. Rob
inson and Johnston 6-4, 6-3.
