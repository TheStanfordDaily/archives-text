GET DEBUNKED!

High-powered sales appeal has robbed words like
"quality" of their old familiar meanings. We buy
price because "best" and "greatest" have been
thrown at us so often that we have decided what
costs most must be best .... Here is an appeal to
use your own judgment .... Go and see what any
shoe store has to offer for ten or twelve dollars—
then come and see Regals at $6.60. You'll realize
then, more than ever before, what terms like
QUANTITY PRODUCTION, SPECIALIZED
BUYING, RETAILING THROUGH YOUR
OWN STORES, and EFFICIENCY can mean to
you, the ultimate consumer.
