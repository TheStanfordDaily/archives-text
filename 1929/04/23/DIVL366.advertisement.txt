Gentlemen:
in the past twenty years I have been
a consistent smoker. I was always
anxious to smoke a pipe; but no mat
ter how often I tried, I soon changed
my mind. 1 have tried all kinds of
pipe tobacco, but not once was I satis
lied with the laste of any of them until
just recently 1 gave my pipe another
trial.
It was my luck to choose Edgeworth
this time, with the results that 1 am
still using it and will continue to do so.
1 only hope that you will continue to
give that same mild, high-grade qual
ity in the future.
1 have started not less than sixteen
men to start or give Edgeworth a
trial, and they are still using that
same unequaled non-biting tobacco to
this day. 1 can recommend Edge
worth tobacco to anybody who en
joys a cool non-biting brand of good
tobacco; and as long as 1 enjoy same,
you can rest assured that I am going
to be a good ad., and many a pipe
smoker will be asked to give it a fair
trial, and they themselves can act
as judges.
I always give praise where praise ia
due. After 1 was convinced of the
wonderful quality of Edgeworth I
could not help but tell you people the
same as I have been telling and will in
th? future tell others.
Hoping that you will continue with
the same quality in Edgeworth, I am
Very truly yours,
(Signed) Joseph J. Stahl
