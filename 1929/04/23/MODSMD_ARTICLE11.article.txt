# 'Apprenticeship' Period Necessary For Graduates, Says Dr. Suzzallo
## 
### William Grace 
Dr. Henry Suzzallo, '99, has a mes
sage of encouragement for the Stan
ford men who graduate every June
wondering how they are going to find
their places in the business world with
only an A.B. degree as a credential.
Every man, collegian or non-colle
gian, must serve a period of appren
ticeship, believes Doctor Suzzallo. It
is a necessary transition period of
practical training which follows
schooling and precedes the fully re
sponsible and adequately remunera
tive practice of a business or of a
profession.
"In the old days, trades and profes
sions were mastered through appren
ticeship, learning in the presence of
the practical situation with the exam
ple and aid of the masters. When in
creased schooling was provided, the
well-educated were few, and they rose
rapidly, without a long apprenticeship.
Now, when college graduates are far
more numerous, they still have the

rosy expectations of a previous day.
Their thinking needs amendment. It
is not up-to-date. This false outlook
leads to anxiety throughout the senior
year.
Five Stages of Life
"A college man with a modern per
spective will see his life in five major
stages, each emphasizing a different
accomplishment: (1) a broad, liberal
training for the man and citizen he
wants to be; (2) a pre-vocational mas
tery of the studies and sciences that
underlie his future occupation; (3) a
professional study of the facts, prin
ciples, attitudes, and techniques which
are the working elements of his future
specialization; (4) a disciplined ap
j prenticeship where lie utilizes his pre
vious academic training in the forms
and ways that a practical everyday
life calls fof them, under direction
and with ascending part-pay; and (5)
j a responsible, self-directed practice of
! his occupation where, if competent,
he receives an adequate living re
muneration.
Expect Low Pay
"The university student who com- :
pletes a professional school course, j
has, within academic walls, passed
through the first three stages," Dr.
Suzzallo continued. "The new gradu- |
ate engineer, lawyer, and others of
their kind expect two or three years
of inadequate pay spent in working
their way up to a really responsible
place of service.
"Strange to say, the liberal arts
graduate who has passed through only
the first of these stages within aca- |
demic walls too often expects by some |
luck to pass to the fifth stage at once. |
"Instead of worrying merely about
%
how he is going to complete his col- i
lege course, he ought to be concerned
both about how he is going to com- j
plete his college course and how he is j
to make his apprenticeship cover the
three missing aspects of training in
the single stage of apprenticeship.
And his personal financing should be
thought of not as a problem that will
bo closed with graduation but as one ;
which will be solved only with the ,
close of his period of apprenticeship. ]
""If the liberal arts graduate has in j
some respects a more complicated ap- i
prenticeship, he has had a broader
and more flexible training, and a long-!
er humanistic discipline with which
to meet it. It is a just and effective ;
compensation. Later he will not be
sighing for the broader foundations !
which his more specialized classmates j
will sooner or later wish they had
obtained at the university."
Opportunities Open
Speaking always to the man who j
will not go on to graduate or profe3-
sional school but who will at once
seek his opportunity in life, Dr. Suz
zallo suggests that there are certain
best opportunities for him. They arc
to be found (1) in occupations, rapid
ly changing their traditional charac
ter (retail merchandising for exam
ple), (2) in fields where the percent
age of highly schooled men is low
(transportation management), (3) in
domains where the specialized tra'n
ing required is not closely standard
ized (realty), and (4) in new services
just beginning to develop a market
demand (personnel management), and
(5) wherever the service calls for
diverse and complicated adjustments j
requiring a liberal human outlook
(general business management).
"Blind Alley" Jobs
"Above all, do not look for too big
a job at too good pay," the educator
concluded. "This may merely beckon j
the college graduate into a blind-alley
job. Post-graduate apprenticeship calls 1
for a modest standard of living, the ;
willingness to learn, much hard work, j
and faith in the worth of liberal train
ing in the long run of life."
Dr. Suzzallo has been occupied for
the last two years as a research asso
ciate in higher educational adminis
tration for the Carnegie Foundation j
for the Advancement of Teaching. His 1
offrce is in New York but his work
has carried him all over Europe as '
well as the United States. In this
period he has been a visiting profes
sor in twelve European universities,
and the next fall he will in addition
to his Foundation duties give a series
of lectures as Visiting Professor of
Education in Columbia University,
New York.
