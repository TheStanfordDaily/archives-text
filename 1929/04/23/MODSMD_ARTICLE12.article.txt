# EDUCATION BY MOVIES TOPIC FOR LECTURE
## George E. Stone, Photograph Expert, to Illustrate Talk With Slides 
### 
"Can the Movies Teach?" will be
the subject of an illustrated lecture
to be given by George E. Stone in the
Assembly Hall tonight at 7:30 o'clock.
Stone is secretary of the Visual Edu
cation Service, Incorporated; he will
show slides and films in several fields
of educational interest which he has
been developing.
Stone, who is a graduate in biology
of the University of California, recent
ly made a film entitled, "How Life
Begins," which illustrated biological
processes. This film, along with sev
eral others, was designed to represent
an elementary biology text. It was
used widely during the period of the
World War. Stone served in France
as official photographer in his divi
sion during that time. As an artist de
signer, Stone has given some of his
work to the Stanford Illustrated Re
view during the past three years.
He has experimented in the field of
color photography in both still pic
tures and moving pictures and has
made a number of inventions for
quick photography. Stone has con
tributed to an effort represented by
Visual Education Service to develop
pictures and films of an educational
nature on a commercial basis. His
combined capabilities as an inventor
with technical understanding of pho
tography, scientific education of a
biological type, and a strong artistic
sense have made him particularly
useful.
