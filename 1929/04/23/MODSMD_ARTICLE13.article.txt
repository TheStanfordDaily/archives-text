# "ANCIENT ONE" CALLS FOR COPY; FRIDAY IS CHAPARRAL DEADLINE
## 
### 
"Copy, copy," moaned the Old Boy
late yesterday as he mournfully swept
the cobwebs out of his famous long
gray beard. "And when I say 'copy,'
I don't mean to violate the honor
code â€”just bring in your own, original
two-line jokes, puns, and what have
you 011 or before Friday for my Local
Interest Number of Chaparral."
The Ancient One was much moved
by the recent "Utopia Daily" and in
tends to put out an issue that will
welcome sly digs at various Univer
sity activities. Among the suggested
victims are the Rally Committee, the
Election Board, Stanford Theatricals,
8.A.C., the Commons, Lagunita, ath
letic teams, the band, Stanford cus
toms and traditions, and others of
greater and lesser note.
Again he reminds the campus joke
stcrs that the deadline is Friday.
