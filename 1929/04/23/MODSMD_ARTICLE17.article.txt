Three one-sided games, one of them
a shut-out, featured the opening of
the third round of the intramural
baseball series yesterday afternoon on
the mural ball diamonds.
Striking out seventeen batters and '
holding the Theta Delts to one infield
hit, Don Story pitched the Breakers
to an easy win. Story's mixture of i
speed balls and fast-breaking curves
completely baffled the fraternity play
ers and they fanned out one, two,
three in all but two innings.
A1 Miller led the Breakers' hitting ;
attack with five safe blows out of j
five trips to the plate. Besides show- |
ing up well at bat, Don Oswill caught
a nice game and pegged out a couple
of Theta Delts trying to steal second j
base.
i
Chi Psi broke into the win column ;
with an unexpected win over Sigma
Nu. The winners played errorless ball
and turned in two neat double plays, :
Winger to D. Russ to Harris. Playing
with only seven men during most of
the contest, Sigma Nu played a ragged
fielding game and failed to hit in the !
pinches.
Although Kim Dyer struck out
twelve batters, he was wild at times
and blew up in the second and seventli
innings, in each of which the Chi
Psi's shoved across seven runs. C.
Brink and Winger, both of the Chi
Psi Lodge, were the heavy hitters
with two hits each, one of Brink's j
going for three bags. F. Russ looked '
good behind the plate for the winners
and picked four runners off second i
base.
In the only other game of the day
Sequoia I pounded the ball all over
the diamond to beat Phi Sigma Kappa
by a score of 13 to 4. James Trim- j
mingham chucked good ball for the
hall team, letting down the Phi Sigs
with three scattered hits. The Sequoia
Infield handled the ball well, Will
Silva standing out at shortstop.
El Toro won on a forfeit when En
cina 2W failed to put In an appear
ance. Yesterday's win put Toro in the
lead of League 4 with three straight â– 
victories.
