What, then, is this Prohibition? Is it a simple law that must lie en
forced like any other law? Or is it as mixed up with emotions and mores
and principles and behavior as was the Stamp Tax, a hundred and fifty
years ago? It is broken daily, hourly; it is enforced by violence, murder,
and the expenditure of millions of dollars yearly—where it is enforced
at all. We have had nearly ten years of it. It is time, as Mr. Hoover
says, to take stock. Are we, as our European neighbors think us, a vio
lent, lawless, unreasoning nation? Or can we soberly, sanely, with justice
and decency, submit this question to the most penetrating inspection ? Is
America Wet? Is it Dry? Is it half-and-half? Once more The Nation
appeals for a countrywide referendum on the subject. The existing situ
ation is intolerable.—The Nation.
