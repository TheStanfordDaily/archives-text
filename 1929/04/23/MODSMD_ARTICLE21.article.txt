# Education Quackery

### 
We are living in an age of patent-medicine remedies in the field of
education. The various projects for achieving the millennium in our
colleges are exceeded in number and absurdity only by the plans for
world peace and brotherhood. Perhaps this is due to the fact that no one
has offered a hundred thousand dollars for a prize-winning solution of
collegiate problems. At any rate, the general consensus of opinion among
the medicine men is that whatever is wrong with the colleges can be
swiftly and thoroughly remedied by a plan. According to Professor
Munro of Harvard, the only necessary qualification for an educational
expert is that he be "a glib fellow away from home."
We find this type of faker present in several violent forms. We have
the abolitionists, who believe that the perfect college may be developed
by abolishing football, fraternities, lectures, or examinations. As substi
tutes they offer intramural sports, social equality, intensive classroom
work, and original research. Unfortunately these cure-alls have proved
themselves effective only on paper. Then there are the vocationalists, who
have carried their democratic deification of "working one's way through
college" to the point of founding part-time institutions. By this novel
method the best features of both vocational and cultural education are
sacrificed.
A third group of reformers seek Parnassus by means of question
naires, orientation courses, and free advice to freshmen. Their theory is
that the best way to discover the true purpose of a college education is to
catalogue and analyze the written replies of questionnaire victims. The
right way to set the freshman on the high road to knowledge is to give
him a course covering the history of civilization or the philosophy of life.
To prevent him from making any mistakes, there shall be student and
faculty advisers who will instill into his young and innocent mind their
mature wisdom. These systems have all been tried over a number of
years, but as yet they have not sensibly affected the maladjustment or
imbecility of the average student body. . . .
The state universities are forced to cure their digestive troubles by
expelling a large proportion of each class annually. The endowed insti
tutions protect themselves by strictly limiting their enrollment. . . .
According to legitimate ( !) educational theorists, the deficiency is not
one of system, organization, or program, but of personnel. Teaching is
not a matter of methodology but rather one of personality. The institu
tion which handpicks its student body and selects its faculty with a con
sideration of human as well as of scholarly values will achieve true dis
tinction. The college which seeks after a perfection by plan, and neglects
the individual and personal element, can never reach its objective—how
ever lofty its aim may be.—The Daily Princctonian.

sideration of human as well as of scholarly values will achieve true dis
tinction. The college which seeks after a perfection by plan, and neglects
the individual and personal element, can never reach its objective—how
ever lofty its aim may be.—The Daily Princctonian.
We are living in an age of patent-medicine remedies in the field of
education. The various projects for achieving the millennium in our
colleges are exceeded in number and absurdity only by the plans for
world peace and brotherhood. Perhaps this is due to the fact that no one
has offered a hundred thousand dollars for a prize-winning solution of
collegiate problems. At any rate, the general consensus of opinion among
the medicine men is that whatever is wrong with the colleges can be
swiftly and thoroughly remedied by a plan. According to Professor
Munro of Harvard, the only necessary qualification for an educational
expert is that he be "a glib fellow away from home."
We find this type of faker present in several violent forms. We have
the abolitionists, who believe that the perfect college may be developed
by abolishing football, fraternities, lectures, or examinations. As substi
tutes they offer intramural sports, social equality, intensive classroom
work, and original research. Unfortunately these cure-alls have proved
themselves effective only on paper. Then there are the vocationalists, who
have carried their democratic deification of "working one's way through
college" to the point of founding part-time institutions. By this novel
method the best features of both vocational and cultural education are
sacrificed.
A third group of reformers seek Parnassus by means of question
naires, orientation courses, and free advice to freshmen. Their theory is
that the best way to discover the true purpose of a college education is to
catalogue and analyze the written replies of questionnaire victims. The
right way to set the freshman on the high road to knowledge is to give
him a course covering the history of civilization or the philosophy of life.
To prevent him from making any mistakes, there shall be student and
faculty advisers who will instill into his young and innocent mind their
mature wisdom. These systems have all been tried over a number of
years, but as yet they have not sensibly affected the maladjustment or
imbecility of the average student body. . . .
The state universities are forced to cure their digestive troubles by
expelling a large proportion of each class annually. The endowed insti
tutions protect themselves by strictly limiting their enrollment. . . .
According to legitimate ( !) educational theorists, the deficiency is not
one of system, organization, or program, but of personnel. Teaching is
not a matter of methodology but rather one of personality. The institu
tion which handpicks its student body and selects its faculty with a con
sideration of human as well as of scholarly values will achieve true dis
tinction. The college which seeks after a perfection by plan, and neglects
