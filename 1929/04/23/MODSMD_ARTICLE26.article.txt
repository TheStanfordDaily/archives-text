## SPEAKING OF GRAFT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Just a word about a decision reached
by some officious Mugwump on the
8.A.C.; (A board whose motto is:
"Get Garish Greenbacks from all
Gabies and Gaffers.") viz, That Frosh
ballplayers must pay the regular price
of admission to varsity games or come
out in uniform. Now I ask you, breth
ren, with tears in my whiskers, is that
right? No, of course it isn't. In the first
place, it is robbery to charge any of
the students admission to our base- j
ball games. Our team needs support, i
and plenty of it, but very few are [

willing to dig down into the proverbial
old sock to see any intercollegiate
game. Professional ball nowadays is
so far superior to that played by col
leges that the latter is no drawing
card. The B.A.C. ought to come out of
the fog and quit pinching the pennies
until the Indians set up a war cry. No
one is particularly keen on paying
two-bits just to plant his carcass down
on some old splintery bleachers for
nine innings of a comedy of errors.
Not that the two-bits is such a vast
i sum, it's the idea of it that's riling.
â€”Harry Catlin.
