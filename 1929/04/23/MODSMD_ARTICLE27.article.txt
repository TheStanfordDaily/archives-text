# A 						WORD TO YELL LEADERS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Although it is late in the season to
be doing so, I wish to criticize our
present yell leaders and offer a sug
gestion to those who succeed them.
All through the track season our
yell leaders have shown little regard
for the also-rans and those who got a
mere second or third place. For those
who made a first there was much
cheering, but for those who weren't
quite bo good there has been deep and
engulfing silence. Even if a man does
not place, as long as he is a Stan

ford man, a member of the Stanford
squad, he deserves a yell as much as
the winner of the event.
As a matter of fact, yelling for in
dividuals is a thing not generally
practiced by the leading colleges now
a-days. The team captain is the only
one who deserves an individual yell
and he only because he represents
the team. However, if we are going
to have individual yelling, let's let all
the boys in on it, whether they Win
or lose.
Sincerely, Jerry.
