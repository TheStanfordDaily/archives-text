"The Broadway Melody"—Columbia.
The most pretentious talkie yet
made, this picture presents two femi
nine stars who are certainly going to
be the big hits of the new style
movies. Bessie Love and Anita Page,
in addition to "It, dese, dem, and
dose," have perfect voices. They also
dance and sing—and oh! what appeal
they possess.
Last fall this writer met Bessie Love
and predicted that if the camera ever
pictured her real charm she would be
a knockout. Well, we modestly take a
little bow —for at last Miss Love has
been given a role suitable to her tal
ents. And how she does step right up
and win the audience. Her characteri
zation as "Hank," the vaudeville act
ress who intends to make blas6
Broadway wake up, is one of the very
best —if not the best —individual por
trayals ever screened. Five feet of
condensed ultra-personality — that's
Bessie Love. Like the audience, we
give this little girl a great big hand.
The other hit of the show is Anita
Page, who plays "Queenie," the act
ress sister of "Hank." Since our
prophecy of last fall materialized so
successfully, we are tempted to make
another. Anita Page, nineteen years
old and the most gorgeous blonde
we've seen in yeahs and yeahs, is
going to be one of the big stars of
Hollywood. She not only looks like a
million, but she is practically the only
one of the younger generation of stars
who knows what the acting racket is
all about. She fully lives up to all the
requirements of a difficult role. When
the hero sings "You Were Meant For
Me" to her, every man in the audi

fence subconsciously joins in on the
"And I was meant for you" phrase.
Charles King, a real Broadway star,
was imported to Hollywood for the
leading man's role. He was worth the
carfare —he acts well enough and
sings the song hits of the picture very
effectively. And if you don't know
"You Were Meant For Me," "The
Broadway Melody," and "The Wed
ding of the Painted Doll" now—you
will certainly learn them after you
hear and see them sung in this pic
ture.
The story is not very original, con
cerning "Hank" and "Queenie," the
Mahoney Sisters, who arrive in New
York to put their names up in the
bright lights. But the fine acting of
the two girls makes every minute in
teresting. And then lots of backstage
scenes give theatrical glamour, and
"The Wedding of the Painted Doll"
tableau gives a Ziegfield touch.
There are some technical faults.
For instance, when the hero is talking
to Anita Page and starts to sing to
her while in her apartment, a marvel
ous orchestra pipes up as an accom
paniment. Such uncalled-for music de
stroys the reality of the scene. And
during the painted doll tableau a mys
terious voice sang the song—who it
was the audience was never permitted
to know. We like to know who's
whooping when we hear voices.
"The Broadway Melody" is hardly
worth the high prices and a special
trip to the city. But when it comes to
Palo Alto you must see those two
charmers —Bessie Love and Anita
Page—as "Hank" and "Queenie."
