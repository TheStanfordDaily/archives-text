# CABBAGES and THINGS

By Philip Suace
Second week of the official rushing
season started yesterday.
The catch was large.
How did the season happen to Ret
cut down to three weeks? asks Moore
Anon. Easy. Everybody was penalized
for illegal tactics.
At that, bowing three times a night
before the Mystic Cow is no worse
than sitting three times a day before
something far more- mysterious at
Encina Commons.
Euphronia thinks that Greek Let
ters is part of the Classical Literature
Department.
The lure of Greek words is mysterious
The freshmen get hot and delirious
The season is over
And what once seemed clover
Is Spinach—what could be more seri
ous?
"The fraternities," comes a faintly
reminiscent cry, "get the cream of the
freshman class."
And cream turns sour.
Couplet
The . . . a's left a monied Frosh
within Encina dorm
God works in a mysterious way his
wonders to perform.
Nonsense Verse
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Hall and Row, and Row and Hall,
And Life is but a Dream.
Lest this department be accused of
sour grapes, be it known that "ye
editor" of "Cabbages and Flings" was
once head of a very mysterious or
ganization known as Sigma Phi Nu.
It was so mysterious that nobody
knew what the ideals were. It wasn't

long before it became known as Sigma
Phi Nothing. Then we knew it was
time to quit.
From yesterday's Daily:
"Captain Curtice of California took
second with more than nine feet. Cap
tain Curtice of California took second
with a throw of Stanford placed third
with another of 204 ft. 8% in.; and
Bill Sparling record-breaking toss of
202 ft. 3% in."
Not only that, but etaoin shrdlu.
At any rate, it is easy to see that
the javelin was an upset event.
This column came very nearly not
being written (what a pity! comments
an onlooker). It seems that the Daily,
for reasons unknown, has installed a
park bench in the office. Well, we
went to sleep from force of habit, and
were only wakened by the nightly cry
of "SCOOP—STOP THE PRESSES!"

of "SCOOP—STOP THE PRESSES!"
By Philip Suace
Second week of the official rushing
season started yesterday.
The catch was large.
How did the season happen to Ret
cut down to three weeks? asks Moore
Anon. Easy. Everybody was penalized
for illegal tactics.
At that, bowing three times a night
before the Mystic Cow is no worse
than sitting three times a day before
something far more- mysterious at
Encina Commons.
Euphronia thinks that Greek Let
ters is part of the Classical Literature
Department.
The lure of Greek words is mysterious
The freshmen get hot and delirious
The season is over
And what once seemed clover
Is Spinach—what could be more seri
ous?
"The fraternities," comes a faintly
reminiscent cry, "get the cream of the
freshman class."
And cream turns sour.
Couplet
The . . . a's left a monied Frosh
within Encina dorm
God works in a mysterious way his
wonders to perform.
Nonsense Verse
Row, row, row your boat
Gently down the stream
Hall and Row, and Row and Hall,
And Life is but a Dream.
Lest this department be accused of
sour grapes, be it known that "ye
editor" of "Cabbages and Flings" was
once head of a very mysterious or
ganization known as Sigma Phi Nu.
It was so mysterious that nobody
knew what the ideals were. It wasn't

long before it became known as Sigma
Phi Nothing. Then we knew it was
time to quit.
From yesterday's Daily:
"Captain Curtice of California took
second with more than nine feet. Cap
tain Curtice of California took second
with a throw of Stanford placed third
with another of 204 ft. 8% in.; and
Bill Sparling record-breaking toss of
202 ft. 3% in."
Not only that, but etaoin shrdlu.
At any rate, it is easy to see that
the javelin was an upset event.
This column came very nearly not
being written (what a pity! comments
an onlooker). It seems that the Daily,
for reasons unknown, has installed a
park bench in the office. Well, we
went to sleep from force of habit, and
were only wakened by the nightly cry
of "SCOOP—STOP THE PRESSES!"
