# ALDINE PRESS BOOKS OF 15TH CENTURY ON DISPLAY IN LIBRARY
## Valuable Copies of Classic Literature Accentuate Fine Grade Type 
### 
Many volumes turned out by the
famous Aldine Press of Venice are
now on exhibit In the upstairs cases
at the Library.
Aldus Pius Manutius, founder of the
press, printer and publisher of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, was
a student of the classics; he took
pride in putting out fine copies of
Greek and Latin works. The classical
volumes which Aldus Pius Manutius
edited and published served for cen
turies as the authoritative versions.
Among the volumes on exhibit in
the Library now are the famous De
Re Natura of Lucretius, Psalerium
Graecum, and a number of Latin octa
vos. Although the Library owns no
works of the Aldine Press in Greek,
there are included in the collection
several reproductions of such print
ing.
The fame of Aldus Pius Manutius,
who lived from 1450 to 1515, rests
largely on his having originated the
cursive, or italic type. He also is re
sponsible for the first complete and
perfect fonts of Greek type, which
were used for many years after the
shutting down of the Aldine presses.
To him, as well, goes the credit for
putting the standard classics within
the reach of more people by means
of his small inexpensive octavo vol
umes.
