# SPORTS OF 1929
## Victorious Voigt 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Is this the "Man of Destiny" among j
the amateur golfers? Is 1929 to be ;
the year in which George Voigt proves j
to the world that he is the master of -
Bobby Jones, George Von Elm, Horton j
Smith, Walter Hagen, and all the j
other knights of the niblick who keep
in the public eye because of their
prowess on the links? While making ;
no attempt to answer these questions,
the young man himself not only :
started the year off auspiciously by
finishing first in the amateur-pro !
event in the Miami Beach open, but
carried or. the good work this month
with his third consecutive win in the j
North and South amateur tournament j
at Pinehurst.
Voigt, after years of struggling
against slight physique, poverty, and
inability to score in a national event,
has seemingly conquered all three j
foes, and now, with good health, a
good job in Wall Street, and the rec-1
ord of being the lowest scorer of them
all in the qualifying rounds of the
1928 amateur at Brae Burn, he firmly
believes himself to be "Golf's Man of
Destiny," and ,1929 to be the year in
which his dreams will come true.
Followers of golf will remember
how Voigt was cleared of the charges
of professionalism by the United
States Golf Association, which gave 1
him a clean bill of health, even
though he suddenly changed from a

j low-salaried Government clerk in j
j Washington to a desirable member of ;
i an exclusive club and a valuable bond 1
' salesman, because of his remarkable
; gifts as a golfer.
George's shots are straight-and-out
flawless. He never slams long screech
ing drives, but he keeps on the fair
way. He is looked upon by the pros i
as the darkest menace among the |
amateurs to the laurels they would
like to win in the open events.
