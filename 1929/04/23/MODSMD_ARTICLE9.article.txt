# HOOVER ADDRESSES ASSOCIATED PRESS AT HEW YORK LUNCHEON
## Speech Broadcast Over Two National Radio Chains To Entire Nation 
### 
NEW YORK, April 2%. (ff)â€” Presi
dent Hoover departed for Washing
ton at 2:54 o'clock this afternoon
after addressing the annual luncheon
of the Associated Press at the Wal
dorf-Astoria Hotel.
In his address, which was broadcast
to the country over two national radio
chains, Mr. Hoover said concerning
Prohibition:
"In order to dispel certain illusions
in the public mind on the subject,
let me say at once that while viola
tions of law have been increased by
inclusion of crimes under the eight
eenth amendment and by the vast
sums that are poured into the hands
of the criminal classes by the patron
age of illicit liquor by otherwise re
sponsible citizens, yet this is but one
segment of our problem."
The President suggested as a crime
deterrent that newspaper publishers
invest the acts of enforcement officers
with some of the glamor of romance
and heroism "which our American
imaginative minds throw around those
who break the law."
As he did in his inaugural address
seven weeks ago, the President placed
squarely before the people their re
sponsibility in the matter of law ob
servance and said the real problem
was to awaken the consciousness, the
moral sense, of the citizen and, if
necessary, to segregate where they
cculd do no future harm "degenerate
minds," which have not the intelli
gence and the moral instinct to obey
the law as a matter of conscience.
Mr. Hoover was introduced by
Frank B. Noyes, president of The As
sociated Press. He said that in asking
the President to speak at the luncheon
he had assured him of the publishers'
desire that the Chief Executive speak
with utmost frankness.
