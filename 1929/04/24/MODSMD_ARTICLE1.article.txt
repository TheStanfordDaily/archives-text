### 
PARIS, April 23. (£>)— After a little
more than ten weeks of existence en
deavoring to settle the problem of
German reparations, the second Dawes
committee began to draw up its will
today. Representatives of some coun
tries on the committee were still try
ing to make that work appear prema
ture by efforts to prolong its life.
Consultations thus far held have
brought forward no remedy, however,
and the new offer which had been an
nounced in some quarters as likely to
be made by Dr. Schacht after his talks
yesterday with Owen D. Young and
Emil Moreau, did not materialize.

Private conversations are continu
ing between the German and the
Allied experts with a view to bringing
demands and offers nearer together.
In German circles, however, no hope
Is held that the divergence can be so
narrowed as to permit a present
arrangement for final liquidation of
the reparations problem. But for the
report to the various governments and
for possible subsequent negotiations
it is desirable that the difference be
narrowed as much as possible.
It is now fairly well established that
Dr. Schacht, head of the German dele
gation, brought back no new offer with
him from Berlin and had not made
one of his own responsibility.
