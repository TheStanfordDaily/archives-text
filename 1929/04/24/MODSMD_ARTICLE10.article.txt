# CARDS TO ENTER POWERFUL TEAM IN FRESNO MEET
## Templeton Selects Twenty-Man Team to Compete In Relays; Four Frosh Enter 
### 
Selection of a powerful 20-man team
to represent Stanford in the annual
Fresno Relays Friday and Saturday
indicates conclusively that Coach
Dink Templeton Is out to win the 1929
Raisin Day meet at Fresno. Last year,
with an incomplete team, the Cards
finished second, only one point be
hind U.S.C.
Teams will be entered in all four
relays, and a victory is likely in every
one of them. Dyer, Lauritzen, McDer
mott, and Syer make up the quarter
mile team, with Morrison taking
Syer's place on the 880-yard team.
Stanford's mile team of Shove, Syer,
McKinnon, and Morrison, undefeated
in dual competition this year, Is fa
vored to capture this event. McKin
non, Neikirk, French, and Parker
make up the four-man two-mile team.
Teams are being entered in all of the
relays, because a first place in one of
them counts ten points.
Weight Men Compete
Hec Dyer and John Lauritzen will
be entered in the open 100-yard dash
as well as in the two relays. Captain
Ross Nichols and Rogers Smith will
try to pick up first and second places
in the high hurdles; while Krenz and
Rothert will compete and are certain
to capture their customary first places
in the discus and shot. Kibby and
Sparling, Templeton's two javelin men
who have both bettered 200 feet this
year in competition, will be entered
in the spear-tossing event. The other
Card entries will be Edmonds and
Hulsman, pole vault; Dowell and An
derson, broad jump; and French and
Madison, high jump.
An unattached team of four fresh
men will enter both the quarter- and
half-mile relays. This team will be
composed of Giberson, Hables, Elwood,
and Lombardi.
A special meeting of the track squad
will be held this afternoon on the Old
Oval at 4 o'clock to elect a captain for
next year. All men who competed in
the Olympic Club and collegiate meets
this year are eligible to vote.
