# VISUAL EDUCATION IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SCHOOLS-STONE
## 
### 
"Visual education through slides
and motion pictures brings before the
eyes of school children an otherwise
impossible range of subjects," said
George A. Stone in his lecture in the
Assembly Hall last night. "It makes
the conception more vivid, more ac
curate, and more lasting."
Ilustrating his contention, Stone
showed slides comparing drawings
made from verbal definitions with pho
tographs, as well as a great sweep of
varied educational views including na
tural history, architecture, astronomy,
aviation, art, foreign peoples, and
scenic pictures.
These slides were followed by a
composite reel of motion pictures con
taining excerpts from Stone's famous
film, "How Life Begins," which com
pressed into a few moments the re
sults of many months of work. Pic
tures of the seldom-observed processes
cf reproduction, plant growth, meta
morphosis, embryo development, the
flow of radio waves, and the carrying
of the malaria parasite by the mosqui
to were projected to give an adequate
idea of the enormous scope of visual
education.
Valuable educational films are now
being distributed in all of the schools
of the state by the Visual Education
Service which was founded by Stone
two years ago, and which organization
aims to manufacture every type of
photographic material which may be
used in the schoolroom, operating on
a non-profit basis.
"The extension and utilization of
this system," he concluded, "will
prove to be an increasingly important
factor in education."
