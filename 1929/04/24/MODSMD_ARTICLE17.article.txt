(Editor's Note: This is the fifth of
a series of articles with Stanford men
on the research work of their depart
ment. In this article, a considerable
portion is given to a history of Palo
Alto as modern geologists and paleon
j tologists picture it. Dr. James Perrin
Smith, bearing degrees from Wofford,
; Vanderbilt, and Gottingen, was for
merly assistant geologist with the U.S.
Geological Survey. He has been at
! Stanford since 1892.)

A history of California —more color
] ful, more thrilling than any ever writ
ten by man, beginning hundreds of
thousands of years beforo the human
I race laid eyes on the blue Pacific —is
told by modern geologists.
Using not written records, books,
or catalogued notes, or photographs,
but data obtained from the tombs of
I the earth, Dr. Smith describes the
days when the sea covered what are
now the Sacramento and San Joaquin
valleys, and an arm of the ocean
stretched from what now are the
; cities of Redding and Bakersfield.
Then, after a period of centuries,
came a huge land upheaval, and the
water receded to the Pacific, leaving
j only sluggish rivers in its place. In
I the uncovered valleys, a coating of

■ grass appeared, and soon forests of
majestic redwoods were growing
J throughout the Santa Clara valley.
I Long before this land was a bay
j basin, as it is now, it was a river
valley, with a supply of fresh water
that was to allow the existence of its
i later inhabitants.
These warm, fertile valleys were
! not long without representatives of
J the hundreds of beasts, birds, and
fi&hes that had come to the western
i continents from Europe, Africa, and
! Asia.
Animals Rove Forests
Bands of wild horses and huge red
maned lions soon found their way to
; the redwood forests, foxes, fierce
i wolves, and giant cave bears came to
the foothills, while in the mountains
! were the ancestors of today's moun
tain sheep.
From some distant home came vil
lainous blood-sucking, sabre-toothed
tigers, hairy mammoths and masto
dons, great wide-horned bison, llamas,
ground sloths, and oven camels.
Across the Pacific came strange fish;
the Japanese abalone arrived long be
fore man and made its home on Cali
