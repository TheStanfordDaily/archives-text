# CURRY SUCCEEDS OLVANY AS NEW TAMMANY CHIEF
## Leader Favors Renomination Of Mayor Walker in New York City Fall Election Election Made Unanimous on Motion of E. J. Ahearn, of Fourth Municipal District 
### 
NEW YORK, April 23. (/P)â€”John P.
Curry, an old-fashioned district leader,
was today elected big chief of Tam
many Hall to succeed George W. Ol
vany, who resigned.
Curry won with 12 1-6 votes over
Edward J. Ahearn, leader of the
Fourth District, who had 10 2-6. Mar
tin G. McCue, leader of the East Side
District, regarded until today aa
Curry's strongest opponent, withdrew
his name before the voting began and
threw his support to Ahearn.
Although the general committee,
composed of district leaders and their
feminine co-leaders, was in session
nearly two hours, only one vote was
taken. On the motion of Ahearn, they
made the election of Curry unanimous
before they adjourned.
Curry was one of the leading oppon
ents of the selection in 1924 of Judge
Olvany to succeed the late Charles V.
Murphy. Curry's slogan at that time
was: "A leader, not a lawyer." Since
he had not been a district leader,
Judge Olvany was regarded by the
district leaders at the time as an out
sider.
Curry immediately declared himself
"unqualifiedly" in favor of the renomi
nation of Mayor Walker for the muni
cipal election in the fall.
