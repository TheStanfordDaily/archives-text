# A 						Disagreement About a Trotting Horse
## 
### 
Behind that first experimental effort on the Stanford Farm some fifty
years ago to photograph objects in motion lies an interesting story. Sena
tor Stanford was known up and down the coast and in all racing circles
for his excellent blue blood race horses. His stables and a track were
on the Farm.'
The problem arose in the Senator's mind as to what was the cycle
of motion executed by a trotting horse. It was his theory that the horse
raises all four feet from the ground while trotting. In discussing the
matter with one of his friends, the Senator found a strong upholder of
the opposite theory. The disagreement grew to the portentiousness of a
$25,000 wager, and the Senator set out to prove his point.
The services of Eadweard Muybridge, a noted photographer of San
Francisco, were procured, and the first steps were begun. After several
years of work, by the use of a series of cameras ingeniously arranged, it
was proved clearly that a trotting horse does raise all four feet during
the cycle of motion. Senator Stanford won his $25,000 wager at a cost
of $12,000, the expense of conducting the experiment.
This effort to prove a theory of animal motion was the initial step
toward perfecting the motion picture. The fiftieth anniversary of the
incident will be commemorated here May 8 by the placing of a suitable
memorial and the convening of representatives of the motion picture
industry, gigantic child of that fifty-year-old disagreement about a trot
ting horse.
