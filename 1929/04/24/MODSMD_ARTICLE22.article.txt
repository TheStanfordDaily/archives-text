# The 						Fraternity Is Exposed
## 
### 
The latest issue of The Saturday Evening Post contains a story en
titled "Brothers in the Bond," which rather heavily exposes the fraternity
system. It cannot be said that the story is the personal lament of some
disappointed college man, but rather the reflection of a man who has
experienced the fraternity system of the modern American college and
university campus and who now turns to reflect upon the simplicity and
crudeness of fraternities.
The story is subtly written. To those who are unacquainted with fra
ternities the story is just another set of adventures of college men, but
to one who has been in a chapter meeting of a social fraternity the story
is highly amusing. It reveals what goes on within a fraternity—how the
brotherly spirit is singularly absent in the chapter meeting, how the fra
ternity man exaggerates when it comes to pledging men and how the
fraternity man judges another man—by the automobiles he owns, the
clothes he wears, the social position of his family.
The intricacies of the cut throat, rushing system are very aptly re
vealed—how the freshman chooses his brothers for the next four years
and how the tables suddenly become turned after the chapter has its quota
of pledges or after enough money is represented in the freshman class
to guarantee the brothers some financial gain.
The story is interesting and enlightening, one which should, but will
not, make the fraternity man realize what a small boy he really is.—
