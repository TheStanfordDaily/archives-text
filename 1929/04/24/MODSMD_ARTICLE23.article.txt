# ANITA PAGE, FAMED MOTION PICTURE STAR, STOPS AT CAMPUS ON FIRST NORTHERN TOUR
## 
### Ben Maddox 
Anita Page, the only girl I've ever
seen who looks as alluring as a Col
lege Humor cover, visited Stanford
yesterday. And the eighteen-year-old
star of "The Broadway Melody" more
than lived up to the high expectations
of those who have seen her on the
screen.
What would you do if you had a
seventeen-year-old daughter, took her
on a trip, went to Hollywood, and
after a week there had her signed as
leading lady for one of the biggest
stars of the screen? That's what hap
pened to Anita's parents.
Her father, an engineering graduate
of Columbia in 1909, and her mother
are as deeply interested in their
daughter's career as Anita is herself.
It was just a year ago that the young
lady played opposite William Haines
in "Telling the World." Since then
she has played leads in half a dozen
very popular pictures, including
"Dancing Daughters." And now, at
the age of eighteen, she is tbo star
of the most pretentious talking pic
turo yet produced—"The Broadway
Melody."
All of this sudden success is being
taken very sanely by the Page fam
ily. No night life and whoopee for
Anita. She is not the Clara Bow type,
even though she has plnyed some very
modern minßes. A real nice girl, that's
Anita Pago.

The funny thing about her discovery
is that the studio and the public ex
pected her only to be a beautiful foil
for real actors. Imagine everyone's
astonishment when Anita emoted
more effectively than many of the
old-timers who have grown up in pic
tures. Her voice—and she has never
had any specialized training in speak
ing—is excellent in talkies. All this
about stage veterans driving out the
silent actors is thus proved just talk,
because Anita speaks right up with
an A-l voice.
This was the first time the Page
family had ever been in northern
California; they came up so Anita
could appear at the opening of "The
Broadway Melody" in San Francisco
last Sunday. The young star's next as
signment is the leading role opposite
William Haines in "The Gob." He
likes to have her In his pictures, and
she enjoys working with him.
Anita is taking this sudden plunge
into fame with more common sense
than any actor-person I've ever met.
I think this is duo to her fine family
training. There's no doubt in my mind
that she is a potential big star of
tomorrow.
There Is nothing more deadly to the
hearts of men than a really beautiful
blonde, and eighteen-year-old Miss
Page has everything the heart desires.
Save your money against u wintry
day, Greta Garbo!

family had ever been in northern
California; they came up so Anita
could appear at the opening of "The
Broadway Melody" in San Francisco
last Sunday. The young star's next as
signment is the leading role opposite
William Haines in "The Gob." He
likes to have her In his pictures, and
she enjoys working with him.
Anita is taking this sudden plunge
into fame with more common sense
than any actor-person I've ever met.
I think this is duo to her fine family
training. There's no doubt in my mind
that she is a potential big star of
tomorrow.
There Is nothing more deadly to the
hearts of men than a really beautiful
blonde, and eighteen-year-old Miss
Page has everything the heart desires.
Save your money against u wintry
day, Greta Garbo!
Anita Page, the only girl I've ever
seen who looks as alluring as a Col
lege Humor cover, visited Stanford
yesterday. And the eighteen-year-old
star of "The Broadway Melody" more
than lived up to the high expectations
of those who have seen her on the
screen.
What would you do if you had a
seventeen-year-old daughter, took her
on a trip, went to Hollywood, and
after a week there had her signed as
leading lady for one of the biggest
stars of the screen? That's what hap
pened to Anita's parents.
Her father, an engineering graduate
of Columbia in 1909, and her mother
are as deeply interested in their
daughter's career as Anita is herself.
It was just a year ago that the young
lady played opposite William Haines
in "Telling the World." Since then
she has played leads in half a dozen
very popular pictures, including
"Dancing Daughters." And now, at
the age of eighteen, she is tbo star
of the most pretentious talking pic
turo yet produced—"The Broadway
Melody."
All of this sudden success is being
taken very sanely by the Page fam
ily. No night life and whoopee for
Anita. She is not the Clara Bow type,
even though she has plnyed some very
modern minßes. A real nice girl, that's
Anita Pago.

The funny thing about her discovery
is that the studio and the public ex
pected her only to be a beautiful foil
for real actors. Imagine everyone's
astonishment when Anita emoted
more effectively than many of the
old-timers who have grown up in pic
tures. Her voice—and she has never
had any specialized training in speak
ing—is excellent in talkies. All this
about stage veterans driving out the
silent actors is thus proved just talk,
because Anita speaks right up with
an A-l voice.
