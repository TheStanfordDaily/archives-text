"The Big Pond"—Alcazar.
When you know that Robert Mc-
Wade is the stellar player in this
Duffy production, you know that there
is going to be plenty of hilarity. Mr.
McWade has another "grouchy" role,
and when he sputters the audience
roars. This particular play shows him
as a rich American Rotarian whose
daughter wants to marry a French
man. Imagine what the Babbity gen
tleman thinks of that liow-de-do.
The daughter being as obstinate as
her papa, strategy is resorted to by
the irate McWade. The Frenchman,
who seems to fit in with the gondolas
of Venice (where the first act is laid),
is invited to visit the American fam
ily in Vernon, Ohio. Papa just wants
Main Street to get one good look at
the foreigner, and when the town
laughs at his continental ways Mc-
Wade knows his daughter will throw
the fellow over.
Papa knows she will, but picture
the surprise of the audience when it
views Pierre some months after his
importation to Ohio. He has made a
tremendous success as a business
man. In winning papa, however, he
loses the daughter—who, above all
else, is determined not to marry a
Rotarian. She announces her engage
ment to another man, manslaughter
almost results, and —well, see "The
Big Pond" for details.
McWade has a role eminently fitted
for him, although this is not as clever
a play as his "Daddies" and "New
Brooms." Lucile Nikolas, as the
daughter, is the best member of the
supporting cast, with Donald Fremont,
as the foreign Pierre, and James Bush
as his American rival, being worthy
of mention for good work.
There's nothing unusual about "The
Big Pond." Pleasant "transatlantic"
comedy enlivened by the ever-amus
ing Robert McWade's characteriza
tion of a grouchy Ohio millionaire who
hates foreigners.
