# The
						Maniac—President Theatre.
## 
### 
Chalk up another entertainment hit
to the credit of the Duffy Players as
a result of their premier presentation
of "The Maniac," now in its opening
week.
You can label this play as an "en
joyable thriller," which means that it
is exciting and nerve-tingling without
being gruesome, horrible, or nerve
wracking. "The Maniac" is a new
play written, staged, and directed by
Tom Barry. It has a wealth of humor
ous lines and a clever plot and situa
tion.
The excitement centers around the
presence of a dangerous maniac in a
lodge in the White Mountains early
in the spring of 1929. And the pres
ence of the madman in that' house
makes the audience quite as nervous
as it does the occupants.
It seems far-fetched to call the aver
age mystery play pleasurable enter
tainment. It is more like self-inflicted
torture. You go with fear and trem
bling, throughout the performance you
sit panicky on the edge of your seat,
and you leave worn-out and jumpy. Is
that pleasure?
And here is where "The Maniac" de
serves praise. It is not one of these
"average" mystery plays. It is pleas
urable without being too much of a
strain on the nervous system. It has
laughs that come from good lines, nof
merely the nervous type that results
when "he wasn't killed after all."
Edmund Breese, a veteran of 3G
years on the stage and in motion pic
tures, gives a really admirable per

formance in the part of Father Wilks.
He is charming as the good priest
whose presence relieves the fears of
those in the maniac-infested lodge.
Miss Gay Seabrook, a favorite of
Duffy audiences, makes a comedy hit
in the part of Minnie, but it hardly is
a suitable characterization for the
wife of an author.
The choicest and most amusingly
piayed part in the whole play is that
of Spike Hennessey, a New York gun
man. William Lloyd does the good
work.
The arrogant and proud rich mother
of the heroine is satisfactorily done
by Jane Morgan; while her daughter,
Ruth, played by Doris Phillips, is the
shapely little morsel who is the chief
attraction of the maniac. Robert Irv
ing Mitchell plays the manly and
capable part of the hero.
