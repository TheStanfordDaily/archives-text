# HAGAN RUNS TO BUY CHINA; TURK CUSTOMS PRESENT CONUNDRUMS
## Stanford Research Worker Returns With Stories Of Village Life 
### 
Turkish social customs are strange,
concluded Harold R. Hagan recently
as ho rushed toward a crockery store
in the Near East to purchase some
coffee cups to serve an unexpectedly
large number of Turkish women call
ing on his wife.
Hagan, on his return here from do
ing research work in fig bacteria, re
lated the following incident:
"A short time after my wife and I
established ourselves in a little inland
village in Turkey, a Turkish gentle
man requested, for his wife, the privi
lege of a visit to my wife.
"The request was granted and a
second one was shortly received, ask
ing permission to bring a friend. This,
also, whs granted, and the day ar
rived.
"Imagine our great consternation,
then, when the lady came, not with
ore friend, but with eight! Being a
man, I was not to be favored with
the company of the Turkish ladies,
so I hurried out to buy sufficient cof
fee cups for the visitors.
"Interesting custom, but how em
barrassing !
"My wife and I caused great talk
in that little town. For example, the
Turkish men —who forbid their wo
men to appear unveiled or to talk to
men —were under the impression that
1 was terribly strict with my wife.
"One man, noticing that I did not
send Mrs. Hagan to the spring to
carry home one or two live-gallon jars
of water, said to me, 'You keep your
wife home as much as you can. You
don't even let her go to the spring.'"
Hagan, who was sent by the Na
tional Biscuit Company to work on
the problem of eradicating fig diseases,
spent several months in a little village
over 700 years old. It contained no
more than 100 homes.
Here he and his wife had many in
teresting problems to contend with,
including the absolute necessity of
installing a complete plumbing sys
tem with very scanty supplies and
the aid of wholly untrained Turkish
workmen. The Ilagans were able to
secure their food only as the inhabit
ants of the village could spare it, and
found that between the bazaar days—
which were a week apart—they had
to depend almost entirely on the good
will of the natives to secure provi
sions.
