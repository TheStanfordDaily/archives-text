## 
### 
With more than sixty men report
ing for spring soccer practice, the
greatest number in Stanford's his
tory, Coach Harry Maloney looks for
ward to another successful season
next year.
Only three men will be lost to the
Cardinals through graduation this
June. The players are Captain Wally
Fell and Hub Moffitt, backs, and Will
Silva, forward. Maloney has plenty of
juniors to fill these vacancies, and
in addition he has a strong sophomore
team.
Two first teams have been picked
from the spring squad and these are
drilling three times a week. Passing,
kicking, and formation work in scrim
mage make up an afternoon's pro
gram.
Bill Nichols, Wilfred Mujica, and
George Eberhart, three sophomores
who were largely responsible for the
Stanford win over Berkeley last fall,
will be the mainstays of Maloney's
forward wall. Captain Herb Mayer is
consistently good at center half. Bob
Reynolds and Rod Jackson, another
pair of sophomores, have also shown
up well in the halfback positions.
