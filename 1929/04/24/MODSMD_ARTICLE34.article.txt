# SPORTS OF 1929
## A 						Little Giant 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Another proof of John McGraw's ,
smartness (as if any further proof is |
needed) was his signing, last Novem-j
ber, Raymond W. Schalk to coach and j
catch for the Giants. While the "Chi- j
cago Cracker" is nearly 37 years old, j
and a veteran of sixteen seasons with
the White Sox, he will catch a few
games for New York, and act as
coach, along with Bert Niehoff.
At San Antonio, before the arrival
of the "Little Napoleon" himself, Ray
Schalk took charge of things and
made a big hit by his willingness to
work and his pep and fire. He seemed
younger than most of the rookies and
proved most valuable in getting things
started in the way John McGraw likes. \
The acquisition of Schalk gives the i
Giants two former Chicago backstops, i
who were looked upon as the best in
the business about five years ago. j
Bobby O'Farrell, formerly of the j
Cubs, and most valuable National j
League player in 1926, is the other j
Giant catcher who survived a long i
period of activity in the Windy City. !
Strangely enough, both former Chi-!
cago catchers, were also managers
for a brief space of time. Schalk man- j
aged the White Sox from November ;
1926 to July 1928, while O'Farrell
bossed the St. Louis Cardinals from
December 1926 to November 1927. |

Schalk, patriotically enough, was ap
pointed manager on Armistice Day
and resigned on Independence Day.
"Iron Man" Ray, although much
smaller than most catchers, used to
handle Big Ed Walsh's delivery as
well as any of the big "truck-horse"
catchers could. He caught one hun
dred or more games for eleven suc
cessive seasons.
