"Dickens in Camp" by Bret Harte, and
"To a Girl Dancing" by George Ster
ling. The first, illustrated by Angelo,
was selected by the American Insti
tute of Graphic Arts for 1928. Equally
well printed are: "The Ballads of
Francois Villon," "Song of Songs,"
love lyrics of ancient Palestine, "Let
ters of Amerigo Vespucci" concerning
his four voyages to the New World,
"Letters of Columbus," and the "Philo
bibian of Richard Aungerville."
Oscar Wilde's famous "Salome," il
