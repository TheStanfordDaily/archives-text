"That gang of misfits that hang
I out in the Daily Office will be easy
i pickings for my trained, up-to-the
| minute ball tossers next Sunday."
i With these words and a sly flip of an
| ink bottle at a linotype, "Ban" Malm,
' manager, owner, and treasurer of the
j Press baseball team, voiced his coufl
! dence in his men yesterday.
The Press has a decided advantage
I over the Daily diamond artists. For
the past three weeks the typesetters
have been going through strenuous
! practice and they are in the pink of
, condition. The Daily has done nothing
i in the way of preparing, but the team
j intends to don the moth-eaten mitts
i during the week to get into shape.
Ernie Hipp, captain and third
j sacker of the Press outfit, is certain
I that the Press will come out of the
ruckus on the long end of the score.
! Charlie Wegner, trainer of the back
room boys, gives a deep chuckle when
| the game is mentioned.
I The owners of the local aggregation
i are far from optimistic.
j "We have a good catcher in Os
will," said Calvin I"). Wood, well-known
I newspaper editor, "but the rest of the
j team is certainly pitiful. If we can't
scrape up at least eight ringers, I
think I'll be forced to play."
Eugene Diers was sent back to Sing
Sing for violating his parole when he
picked up a doll at a carnival in New
i "York.
