# Actual Action Movies Made Here By Gov. Stanford Were First In World

Movie Day celebration at Stanford
on May 8 will commemorate the fif
tieth anniversary of Governor Stan
ford's and Eadweard Muybridge's
work in taking the first moving pic
tures ever made of a horse in action
and of a human being.
The above photograph shows the
studio that Stanford equipped for Muy
bridge. It had a series of twenty-four
cameras along a stretch of track, with
lines marked on its surface. The large
light-reflecting background is shown
on either side of the runway.
As early as 1872 Governor Stanford,
a lover and close observer of horses,
in order to prove his conviction that
a trotter in full stride sometimes had
all four feet off the ground at one
time, had Muybridge, a skillful and
well-known photographer of San Fran
cisco, try for instantaneous photo
graphs. Indifferent success was

achieved at this time on account of
the long exposures required. A few
years later the improvement of wet
plates made briefer exposures pos
sible.
Then, beginning in 1878, Stanford
undertook a series of experiments to
secure successive instantaneous pho
tographs of the same animal, which
would form a record of the animal's
complete action. This had never been
done before. Up to this time, attempts
had been made to present impressions
of motion through various devices
which gave fleeting glimpses of suc
cessive poses and event to project
such "moving pictures" on a screen,
but always the separate postures had
to be drawn by hand or posed for a
camera in accordance with guesses as
to actual posture. Muybridge's pic
tures presented the horse, and later
other animals and men, in the natural
attitudes that they assumed in action.
