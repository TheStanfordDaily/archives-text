Man Reaches Coast
As centuries rolled on, many of
these animals disappeared, and many
changed their habits. When man final
ly made his home here, he found no
elephants, no mastodons, no tigers
or camels, but mountain lions and
smaller bears, slinking wolves, and
fleet-footed deer. These others, though,
who no longer roamed through the
valleys, left their marks there as cer
tainly and definitely as if they had
been photographed. In ice caves, in
lakes of pitch, even in the very
ground, are found today their skele
tons or frozen carcasses.
The first human arrivals, so far as
science knows today, were the In
dians. They lived here, improving
their life, until when the first white
men came to California, the Indians
were a high-class, semi-civilized race,
knowing the art of the bow and ar
row, the art of firemaking, and the
fundamentals of architecture and the
science of government. In many re
spects they were similar to semi
civilized Oriental races.
Seek Climatic History
Paleontologists today are intensely
interested in the climatic history of
the world. By examining fossil plants
and comparing them with similar liv
ing ones found in other regions, they
are enabled to state with some cer
tainty what sort of climate prevailed
in many localities at different periods.
For example, Dr. Smith explained, at
one time southern California weather
was similar to that of present-day
Puget Sound. Central California, warm
er now than in earlier days, formerly
had weather now prevailing in th'J
Klamath district.
Another great problem is the locat
ing of the original home of certain
forms of life. Members of the Stan
lord department are now engaged in
investigations on shellfish that have
come down to the west coast of North
America from Arctic regions, on tropi
cal Atlantic fauna that have crossed
into the Pacific, and of forms that
have come into the Gulf of California.
Investigate Gulf
This last field, that of the Gulf of
California and the little-investigated
Lower California, has provided a
highly fertile district for Stanford
students. This month, L. W. Wiedy,
W. W. Valentine, and D. F. Hamelin,
graduate students in the Stanford
geology department, have returned
from a three months' cruise in the
Gulf, bringing a great collection of
mollusca.
These three men used a yacht
equipped by Valentine's father for
long fishing cruises, and which was
easily adapted into an excellent scien
tific vessel.
Including material of the Pliocene,
Pleistocene, and very recent eras, this
collection is reputed to be the great
est ever brought out of the Gulf. "It
has added greatly to our knowledge of
the fauna of Lower California," claims!
Dr. Smith, "containing thousands of
specimens, many of which are new
to science."

these animals disappeared, and many
changed their habits. When man final
ly made his home here, he found no
elephants, no mastodons, no tigers
or camels, but mountain lions and
smaller bears, slinking wolves, and
fleet-footed deer. These others, though,
who no longer roamed through the
valleys, left their marks there as cer
tainly and definitely as if they had
been photographed. In ice caves, in
lakes of pitch, even in the very
ground, are found today their skele
tons or frozen carcasses.
The first human arrivals, so far as
science knows today, were the In
dians. They lived here, improving
their life, until when the first white
men came to California, the Indians
were a high-class, semi-civilized race,
knowing the art of the bow and ar
row, the art of firemaking, and the
fundamentals of architecture and the
science of government. In many re
spects they were similar to semi
civilized Oriental races.
Seek Climatic History
Paleontologists today are intensely
interested in the climatic history of
the world. By examining fossil plants
and comparing them with similar liv
ing ones found in other regions, they
are enabled to state with some cer
tainty what sort of climate prevailed
in many localities at different periods.
For example, Dr. Smith explained, at
one time southern California weather
was similar to that of present-day
Puget Sound. Central California, warm
er now than in earlier days, formerly
had weather now prevailing in th'J
Klamath district.
Another great problem is the locat
ing of the original home of certain
forms of life. Members of the Stan
lord department are now engaged in
investigations on shellfish that have
come down to the west coast of North
America from Arctic regions, on tropi
cal Atlantic fauna that have crossed
into the Pacific, and of forms that
have come into the Gulf of California.
Investigate Gulf
This last field, that of the Gulf of
California and the little-investigated
Lower California, has provided a
highly fertile district for Stanford
students. This month, L. W. Wiedy,
W. W. Valentine, and D. F. Hamelin,
graduate students in the Stanford
geology department, have returned
from a three months' cruise in the
Gulf, bringing a great collection of
mollusca.
These three men used a yacht
equipped by Valentine's father for
long fishing cruises, and which was
easily adapted into an excellent scien
tific vessel.
Including material of the Pliocene,
Pleistocene, and very recent eras, this
collection is reputed to be the great
est ever brought out of the Gulf. "It
has added greatly to our knowledge of
the fauna of Lower California," claims!
Dr. Smith, "containing thousands of
specimens, many of which are new
to science."
