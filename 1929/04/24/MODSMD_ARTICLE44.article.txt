# ANNUAL STUDENT DRIVE FOR CONVALESCENT HOME FUNDS BEGINS ON CAMPUS MONDAY
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
In 1921 a summer camp with 20
children in the old Stanford home.
In 1929 the Stanford Convalescent
Home with the Stanford residence,
two large spacious buildings, and a
third unit, similar in architecture,
under the process of construction, en
larging the capacity to 65 children.
Such is the phenomenal growth and
expansion of Stanford's own charity,
the Stanford Convalescent Home. The
annual student drive for funds to help
operate the campus charity com
mences next Monday, April 29.
The Home stands today as a symbol
of the charity of the founders, as it
was in serving the convalescent chil
dren of the San Francisco community
that Dr. Gardner first conceived the
idea of using the Old Stanford resi
dence as a summer home. He felt
that such community service was
something of which the Leland Stan
fords themselves might well be proud.
In 1921 the Stanford Convalescent
Home was incorporated, and became
an intimate part of the University
and the student life. Dr. Gardner has
been the guiding spirit of the Home
since its inception and he has been
president of the Board of Trustees
since 1921. The endowments grew con
sistently year by year, and the demand
for places at the Home increased so
greatly that the McLaughlin unit was
added in 1923.
Forty children were then accommo
dated by the two buildings, the old
white home of the Stanfords and the
new stucco McLaughlin unit. The bed
patients were kept in the new build
ing, and the founders' residence was
occupied by the run-about children
and used for play and school.

Last year an admission ward was
udded to the McLaughlin unit to pro
tect the children in the Home from
any diseases that the newcomers
might bring with them. This addition
made it possible to take care of forty
five convalescents and expose them
to the health-cures of Stanford sun
shine.
Last year through the gracious
gifts of Mrs. Harry Babcock of San
Francisco another unit, similar in
structure to the McLaughlin building
was added to the Home. It was dedi
cated in November, and the run-about
children were placed in the new build
ing. The Stanford house is now used
exclusively for play- and school-rooms.
Under construction at the present
time is a third unit, exactly like the
other two in architecture, and placed
directly behind the Babcock building.
By this unit the capacity of the Home
will be increased by twenty children.
The funds for this building have been
donated by the Women's Auxiliary
Board, and in a few months it is hoped
to fill it with run-about children. The
Convalescent Home will then extend
its cures and cares over sixty-five chil
dren.
Stanford is unique in possessing
this instrument of charity as an inte
gral part of its campus. The Homo
serves to complete the Stanford com
munity in offering the students an op
portunity for worthwhile service in
the midst of their intellectual pursuits
at the University.

Because of increased burden of of
ficial duties since the illness of his
father, King George, the Prince of
Wales recently sold his twelve hunt
ing horses for $20,000.

ficial duties since the illness of his
father, King George, the Prince of
Wales recently sold his twelve hunt
ing horses for $20,000.
In 1921 a summer camp with 20
children in the old Stanford home.
In 1929 the Stanford Convalescent
Home with the Stanford residence,
two large spacious buildings, and a
third unit, similar in architecture,
under the process of construction, en
larging the capacity to 65 children.
Such is the phenomenal growth and
expansion of Stanford's own charity,
the Stanford Convalescent Home. The
annual student drive for funds to help
operate the campus charity com
mences next Monday, April 29.
The Home stands today as a symbol
of the charity of the founders, as it
was in serving the convalescent chil
dren of the San Francisco community
that Dr. Gardner first conceived the
idea of using the Old Stanford resi
dence as a summer home. He felt
that such community service was
something of which the Leland Stan
fords themselves might well be proud.
In 1921 the Stanford Convalescent
Home was incorporated, and became
an intimate part of the University
and the student life. Dr. Gardner has
been the guiding spirit of the Home
since its inception and he has been
president of the Board of Trustees
since 1921. The endowments grew con
sistently year by year, and the demand
for places at the Home increased so
greatly that the McLaughlin unit was
added in 1923.
Forty children were then accommo
dated by the two buildings, the old
white home of the Stanfords and the
new stucco McLaughlin unit. The bed
patients were kept in the new build
ing, and the founders' residence was
occupied by the run-about children
and used for play and school.

Last year an admission ward was
udded to the McLaughlin unit to pro
tect the children in the Home from
any diseases that the newcomers
might bring with them. This addition
made it possible to take care of forty
five convalescents and expose them
to the health-cures of Stanford sun
shine.
Last year through the gracious
gifts of Mrs. Harry Babcock of San
Francisco another unit, similar in
structure to the McLaughlin building
was added to the Home. It was dedi
cated in November, and the run-about
children were placed in the new build
ing. The Stanford house is now used
exclusively for play- and school-rooms.
Under construction at the present
time is a third unit, exactly like the
other two in architecture, and placed
directly behind the Babcock building.
By this unit the capacity of the Home
will be increased by twenty children.
The funds for this building have been
donated by the Women's Auxiliary
Board, and in a few months it is hoped
to fill it with run-about children. The
Convalescent Home will then extend
its cures and cares over sixty-five chil
dren.
Stanford is unique in possessing
this instrument of charity as an inte
gral part of its campus. The Homo
serves to complete the Stanford com
munity in offering the students an op
portunity for worthwhile service in
the midst of their intellectual pursuits
at the University.
