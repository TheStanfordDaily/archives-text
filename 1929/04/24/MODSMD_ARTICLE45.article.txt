A five-inning pitchers' battle and a
six-inning slugfest comprised the
games played yesterday afternoon in
the intramural baseball tournament.
Only two games were played off yes
terday, the other two scheduled con
tests going as forfeits when the losers
failed to put in an appearance.
Scoring four runs on four succes
sive hits in the first frame, Beta Theta
Pi chalked up an early lead to nose
out Phi Delta Theta by a two-run
margin. Teague opened the rally with
a weak infield hit. "Foot-a-week" Roth
el t, Mears, and Ticknor each followed
with a timely single and the damage
was done.
After the first inning big "Mike"
Reynolds settled down and held the
Retas to one safe blow, a long triple
by "Nellie" Smith in the fifth frame.
Tom Murphy pitched good ball for the
winners, letting the Phi Delt batters
down with three scattered hits. Cal
Strong featured in the outfield with
a couple of nice catches, while Chuck
Smalling showed up well behind the
plate for the losing outfit.
Holding El Cuadro to three hits, Ed
Robinson pitched Delta Chi to an easy
win over the club outfit. Yesterday's
victory was the third straight for the
fraternity team, and it just about
cinched the championship of League
1 for last year's mural titleliolders.
Robinson's curves were breaking
right and he struck out fourteen of
the El Cuadro players. Although

! nicked for eleven hits, Bob Ricklefs
' chucked a fair game of hall for the
losers and retired twelve batters via
' the strike-out route.
Both teams played ragged ball
throughout the six innings, though the
catcher on each squad showed up well.
Besides catching a great game for
Delta Chi, A1 Biagginl led the hit
ting with four bingles out of four
trips to the plate. Chuck Wagner was
on the receiving end for the losers.
I Jennings got the longest hit of the
j day, when he cracked out one of
| Ricklef's offerings for a home run.
