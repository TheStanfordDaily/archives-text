# SECOND ROUND PLAY COMPLETED IN ROBLE TENNIS TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
The second round of the Roble ten
nis tournament was completed yester
day, and the singles matches will
enter the quarter finals this week. The
doubles matches have reached the
finals.
The two doubles contests of the
semi-finals played during the past
week were both two-set matches. The
results were: Barbara Beach Thomp
son and Betts Hawkins d. Maxine
Cushing and Lois White, 7-5, 8-6;
Pauline Wilson and Betty Davidson
d. Wakoko Domoto and Edna Barker,
6-3, 6-1. The two victorious teams that
will meet in a final match on May 5
won by virtue of superior driving
abilities and good placement. The final
promises to be closely contested, but
a slight edge is given to the Thomp
son-Hawkins teams, considering the
comparative ease with which they won
their first matches.
The results of the second round of
singles contests are as follows: Pyle
d. Barker, 1-6, 6-4, 6-2; Grannis de
fauted to Wilson; Thompson defeated
White, 6-4, 4-6, 6-3; Spaulding d. Sny
der, 6-3, 7-5; Hawkins d. Morgan, 6-3,
6-1; Clark d. Hickman, 6-4, 6-4; Cart
lidge d. Davidson, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. The
third round will end next Monday,
April 29, with the completion of the
following matches: Thompson vs. Wil
son; Spaulding vs. Hawkins; Clark
vs. Cartlidge; and Pyle vs. the winner
of the Shupp-Curtis match on Thurs
day.
The singles final will also be played
on Sunday, May 5. Three silver cups
are offered as trophies to the winners
of the singles and doubles contests.
