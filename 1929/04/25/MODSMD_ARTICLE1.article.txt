# LEAGUE MEETING DROPS PROPOSAL TO BAN BOMBING
## Geneva Conference Rejects Germans' Plan to Make Airplane Attacks Illegal Great Britain Backs Naval Disarmament Proposed by Ambassador Hugh Gibson 
### 
GENEVA, April 24. </P) —Germany's
proposal for prohibition of aircraft
bombing in war time was rejected to
day by the preparatory commission on
disarmament of the League of Nations.
Out of 25 national delegations at the
conference only five countries sup
ported the project.
However, in refusing to insert the
bomb prohibition clause in the draft
treaty which the commission is formu
lating, the delegations voting against
the proposal accepted a subsequent
resolution offered by Nicolas Politis,
of Greece, affirming that they had no
intention of authorizing the dropping
of bombs on civilian populations.
Count von Bernstorff in arguing for
his proposal said that in a few hours
bombing airplanes flying over Paris,
Berlin, and London could take a toll
of half a million victims. The Ger
mans insisted that if this method of
warfare was permitted war would be
come not only more horrible but more
cowardly.
The proposal made by Count von
Bernstorff banned all use of explosive
bombs whether against armies or
civilians. The countries supporting his
proposal were Russia, China, Sweden,
and The Netherlands.
