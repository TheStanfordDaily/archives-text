# ROW GOES HAYWIRE
## 
### 
( Editorial)
The most flagrant violation of
rushing rules since regulations
were first established has been
witnessed throughout the pres
ent season. Every night during
the past week fraternity men
have been openly rushing the
freshmen. Last night the halls of
Encina were filled with cliques
of fraternity men endeavoring to
talk the first-year men into going
Row their particular house.
The fraternities have lost all
sense of fair play and it is a case
of dog eat dog. Each house puts
up the excuse, "We've got to do
it for self protection."
Doug Lewis, chairman of the
Inter fraternity Council, and his
organization are directly respon
sible for the situation. The past
years have seen violations, but
nothing as bald and as ruthless
as this. The Row has been cen
sured unjustly many times, but
this is a case when the severest
censure is not enough.
The Row can well look to its
reputation. What freshman can
place any confidence in organiza
tions that set themselves rules to
be followed and lived up to and
then laugh at them and disobey
them as glibly as they agreed to
them? The Row might also elect
an Interfraternity Council that is
capable of functioning as it is
supposed to function.
