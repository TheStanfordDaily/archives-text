# STANFORD TO MEET OXFORD DEBATE TEAM
## Emerson Accepts Offer To Debate English Squad After Thanksgiving 
### 
Oxford will debate a Stanford team
sometime during next fall, announced
Professor James G. Emerson, debate
coach, last night after he had referred
an offer from the English University
to the Debate Council.
Dr. Swain, acting president, re
ceived the Oxford offer last week and
although favorable action was almost
assured by members of the Debate
Council, formal acceptance was not
made until yesterday.
No proposed questions for the con
test were contained in the letter from
Oxford, but negotiations are now go
ing forward to arrange the final de
tails of the debate. Two years ago
when an Oxford team toured the West
the prohibition question was exten
sively used with the Englishmen at
tacking the American temperance
statutes.
Three British teams will tour the
country during the year under the
auspices of the American Student
Federation. Cambridge and the Uni
versity of New Zealand will confine
themselves to American colleges east
of the Mississippi, while the men
from Oxford will meet western insti
tutions.
Professor Emerson, in accepting the
Oxford challenge, expressed the hope
that the meeting may be arranged for
sometime after the Thanksgiving holi
day. Stanford's early schedule on for
ensic contests will probably be heavy,
and Stanford speakers will require a
considerable length of time after
registration to prepare for the finished
debaters from England.
