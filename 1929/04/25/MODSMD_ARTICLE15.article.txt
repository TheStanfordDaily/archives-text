# RECORD PREDICTED IN FUND CAMPAIGN FOR CONVALESCENT HOME
## 
### 
Stanford spirit will reveal its char
itable side next Monday when the first
appeal for funds for the Convalescent
Home Drive begins. Under the direc
tion of Stanford Steinbeck and Mary
Barstow, the many committees man
aging the campaign for Stanford's
charity have been working, and will
start into action Monday morning.
"Let's break another Stanford rec
ord" has been selected as the slogan
lor the annual drive, and it is hoped
that the students themselves will an
swer the appeal for funds to maintain
the campus charity as successfully as
Stanford men and women have an
swered the call of service during the
past year.
Speakers will appear in all the liv
ing groups next Monday noon and
night. Figures cut from wood with
various slogans on them will be placed
on the Quad and at various local
points. These figures were donated
and cut for the A.S.S.U. drive by the
Merner Lumber Company of Palo
Alto. The Varsity Theatre will give
a benefit vaudeville program Monday
night.
Monday will be "tag day" in Palo
Alto as it is planned to appeal to the
city as well as the student body this
year. Another committee has been
formed to canvass the faculty as this
has not been done in an organized
form before.
The student donations form an in
tegral part of the operation receipts
of the Convalescent Home. Last year
the University contributions amounted
to almost half of the individual dona
tions to the Homeâ€”the sum of ap
proximately $2800. But it is expected
that the University, following in the
track team's wake, will "break an
other Stanford record."
