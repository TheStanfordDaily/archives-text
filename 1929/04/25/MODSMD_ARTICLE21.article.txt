# ERIC KRENZ CHOSEN CAPTAIN OF 1930 CARDINAL TRACK TEAM
## Card Leader Wins Shot, Discus at I.C.4-A. Meet Last Year; Holds Discus Record With Heave of 163 Feet 
### 
Eric Krenz, world's discus champion and double winner in the 1928 1.C.4 A.
meet at Boston, was yesterday chosen to captain the Cardinal track and field
team next year.
Krenz, a junior, has had a phenomenal record as a weiglitman. Inter
collegiate champion in both the shot and discus when a sophomore, holder
of the world's discus record when a junior, little more was left for this
curly-haired giant than the captaincy of Stanford's winning team.

- Eric hails from Stockton, and as
far back as one can remember, he has
been putting the shot and tossing the
discus with little respect for existing
records. As a high school student, he
was interscholastic discus champion
with a mark of 133 feet. His best high
school record with the 12-pound shot
was 44 feet.
Krenz began his activities as a
wearer of the Stanford Cardinal by
putting the 16-pound shot 46 ft. 8 in.
and throwing the discus 143 ft. 9 in. to
take two first places in the 1927 Little
Big Meet. In the 1.C.4 A. meet last
year the mighty Card weightman put
the shot 50 ft. 1 in. and tossed the
discus 154 ft. 11 in. to be a double
winner against the pick of college
athletes. Climaxing his remarkable
1928 year, Krenz was selected as a
member of the American Olympic
team and took fourth place at Amster
dam with a put of 49 ft. 2 in.
Then to top it all Krenz smashed
the world's discus record by more
than five feet in his first meet of the
1929 season, that with the Olympic
Club, March 11. His tremendous heave
measured 163 ft. 8% in.
Krenz, with nineteen of his team
mates, will leave tomorrow for Fresno
to participate in the annual West
Coast Relays there Saturday.
