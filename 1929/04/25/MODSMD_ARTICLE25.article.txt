# Pittsburgh Would Stifle Free Discussion
## 
### 
Academic mortuary â€”thus did Scott Nearing term the modern Amer
ican university in an article not long ago. Well might he have said that
of the University of Pittsburgh where an effort by the student Liberal
Club to hear a discussion of the Mooney-Billings case resulted in the club
and its distinguished guest-lecturer, Dr. Harry Elmer Barnes, Smith Col
lege sociologist, being driven into a nearby open lot where they conducted
their discussion regardless of university action.
To the student who believes the university is a cultural center of free
and open discussion and consideration of any and all questions related to
the welfare and existence of mankind, this is reprehensible. No matter
what opinion is held by the university authorities on the Mooney-Billings
case it is an actual problem involving jurisprudence and the legal struc
ture and machinery of a state. Such a problem should not be beyond the
consideration of any student in any university.
It is paradoxical that an institution professing as its reason for ex
istence the teaching of the student to think for himself, to investigate, to
weigh, to learn all that he can about living and all that living involves,
should frustrate the efforts of its students to consider an actual contem
porary problem.
Must the student sit back and spin pretty theories about the sacking
of Troy, the money system of Babylon, the size of the amoeba, the com
position of Roman greaves, the whole musty bag of antique and now dead
problems rather than delving into the living issues of the day? Why go
to college, if consideration of living issues is prohibited? What if the
state of California has committed an injustice? Let it be proved and
rectified. The Mooney-Billings case involves the very thing, law enforce
ment, that President Hoover is appealing to the whole American people
to consider.
The Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees the
American people the right of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly
in these words, "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom
of speech or of the press; or the rights of the people to peaceably as
semble." Not only has the University of Pittsburgh cast aside the
academic ideal of free thought, but also the constitutional right of Ameri
can citizens to speak freely and assemble when they will. It is hoped that
student opinion will protest this throughout the country.
