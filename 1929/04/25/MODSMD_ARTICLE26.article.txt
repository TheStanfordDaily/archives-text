### 
It is highly gratifying to those who believe in the Honor System or
Code as it is termed at Stanford, to witness the results of the University
of California questionnaire on the matter. Of the 1571 students to fill
out the questionnaire, 1094 believed the honor system to be a definite
deterrent to cheating. What better justification of the system could be
asked.
This strong majority believing the system to be a deterrent is ample
proof that it is an institution in the American university that will stay and
continue to maintain the respect of the majority of students. It gives
great hope to those who want to be respected as honorable students ca
pable of bearing a trust,-rather than criminals needing the billy club of a
policeman to check their actions.
