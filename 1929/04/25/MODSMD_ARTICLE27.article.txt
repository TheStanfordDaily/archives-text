# Krenz, The New Captain
## 
### 
Eric Krenz will captain the nationally famous Stanford track team
next year. Krenz' ability has been heralded in sport columns all over the
nation. Having set about in a small way to make himself the best discus
thrower in the world, he did it. His scholarship record shows him to be
somewhat of a student as well as an athlete. The Daily congratulates
him upon his recent honor and anticipates great things from him and the
team he will captain next spring.
