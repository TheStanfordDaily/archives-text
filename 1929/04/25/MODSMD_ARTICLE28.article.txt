# Collegiate Opera Bouffe
## 
### 
The hero was a college editor. Came insidious political forces, the
glamorous Greek letter fraternities, and in the heat of election time the
ballot box was spirited away. It is bruited that the pilfering was done
by these same political forces. Up rose the college editor and decried
such nefarious practices and their machinators. (Take heart, college edi
tor. Chicago uses machine guns.) And then 10, the mighty forces, the
insidious forces kidnapped the editor and "took him for a ride." The
hilarious little affair of stripping him and making him walk home fol
lowed.
Of course San Mateo Junior College, for such is the scene of this
little drama, didn't take its cue from Stanford. The Stanford political
fiasco of some short time back only involved the stuffing of a ballot box,
no kidnapping, no fraternities, so much less dramatic. But these impetu
ous youths always go staid elders one better. It must be great to be young
and filled with such hoop-la and folderol.
