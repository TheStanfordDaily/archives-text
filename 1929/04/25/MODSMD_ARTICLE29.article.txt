# Oxford To Invade Stanford
## 
### 
The Oxford debate will be held here next year. A fine bit of news is
this and one the Daily heartily welcomes. Debating, dying gladiator that
it has been proclaimed, is a worthy activity fit for any man of mettle
and brain. The Oxford debate should give Stanford an increased inter
est in this oldest of college extra-curricular activities, for didn't Socrates,
one-time teacher and man about town in Athens, spend his days digging
up verbal disputes with the townsmen and their sons?
