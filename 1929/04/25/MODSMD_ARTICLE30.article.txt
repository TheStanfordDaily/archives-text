Dark Hester. Anne Douglas Sedge
wick. (New York: Houghton,
Mifflin Company. 1929.)
The old and the new generations
are on parade in Anne Douglas Sedge
wick's most recent novel, "Dark Hes
ter." Only this time it is not the Mid-
Victorian elders in a war against mad
and riotous youth. The generation just
coming of age is set against the
generation now at its prime, and the
clash between them, as represented
in Miss Sedgewick's novel, is a far
more subtle thing than maturity's
heavy disapproval of cocktails and
wild parties.
Hester, the young heroine, belongs
to a crowd that estranges itself from
the old order, not by extravagant bold
ness of conduct, dress, and conversa
tion, but by a fundamental difference
in attitude and ideals. Hester's friends
can not be dismissed with frowns or
shrugs or horrified head-shaking, as
the "fast younger set" can be. They
are much harder to understand, and
to reckon with than that.
In the words of the author, "Thay
were terribly intelligent, their laugh
ter ripped up ancient faiths, their
gravity undermined stalwart policies.
They seemed to believe in none of the
creeds one hacl ever heard of, but they
held creeds of their own with a fierce
intolerance."
On the other hand stands Monica,
Hester's mother-in-law, who in Hes
ter's eyes, is a typical "smug, shel
tered, upholstered woman .reared on
obsolete tradition, sustained by a

doomed social system, buttressed by
old china and the mezzotints of sim
pering ancestresses."
The gulf between the two types of
minds and reactions is developed with
smoothness and well-handled detail.
The situation is given depth and made
convincing through the fact that
Monica and Hester meet and clash
again and again over one man, so
that these three, the man, the mother,
and the wife, suffer so intensely and
dramatically over their conflict in
ideals, because of a love that can not
help but be jealous.
Hester's persistent indifference to
Monica's values cut the older woman
so deeply, that she grows to hate her
son's wife. The interest steadily
mounts as the situation grows more
tense, and the hatred more bitter.
Technically, the workmanship of the
growing climax is superb, but right
here lies perhaps the only defect of
the book —it reads almost like a de
tective novel in the faultless chain of
circumstances that lead up to its sin
gularly poignant crisis. The web is
too perfect.
This is a rather serious criticism,
for it gives an element of artificiality
to an otherwise very beautiful novel.
Still, Miss Sedgewick is undoubtedly
one of the leading stylists of today,
and no one can read "Dark Hester"
without keenly realizing the author's
marvelous sense of words, and her
deep, thrilling, and at the same time,
finely restrained feeling.

tense, and the hatred more bitter.
Technically, the workmanship of the
growing climax is superb, but right
here lies perhaps the only defect of
the book —it reads almost like a de
tective novel in the faultless chain of
circumstances that lead up to its sin
gularly poignant crisis. The web is
too perfect.
This is a rather serious criticism,
for it gives an element of artificiality
to an otherwise very beautiful novel.
Still, Miss Sedgewick is undoubtedly
one of the leading stylists of today,
and no one can read "Dark Hester"
without keenly realizing the author's
marvelous sense of words, and her
deep, thrilling, and at the same time,
finely restrained feeling.

Dark Hester. Anne Douglas Sedge
wick. (New York: Houghton,
Mifflin Company. 1929.)
The old and the new generations
are on parade in Anne Douglas Sedge
wick's most recent novel, "Dark Hes
ter." Only this time it is not the Mid-
Victorian elders in a war against mad
and riotous youth. The generation just
coming of age is set against the
generation now at its prime, and the
clash between them, as represented
in Miss Sedgewick's novel, is a far
more subtle thing than maturity's
heavy disapproval of cocktails and
wild parties.
Hester, the young heroine, belongs
to a crowd that estranges itself from
the old order, not by extravagant bold
ness of conduct, dress, and conversa
tion, but by a fundamental difference
in attitude and ideals. Hester's friends
can not be dismissed with frowns or
shrugs or horrified head-shaking, as
the "fast younger set" can be. They
are much harder to understand, and
to reckon with than that.
In the words of the author, "Thay
were terribly intelligent, their laugh
ter ripped up ancient faiths, their
gravity undermined stalwart policies.
They seemed to believe in none of the
creeds one hacl ever heard of, but they
held creeds of their own with a fierce
intolerance."
On the other hand stands Monica,
Hester's mother-in-law, who in Hes
ter's eyes, is a typical "smug, shel
tered, upholstered woman .reared on
obsolete tradition, sustained by a

doomed social system, buttressed by
old china and the mezzotints of sim
pering ancestresses."
The gulf between the two types of
minds and reactions is developed with
smoothness and well-handled detail.
The situation is given depth and made
convincing through the fact that
Monica and Hester meet and clash
again and again over one man, so
that these three, the man, the mother,
and the wife, suffer so intensely and
dramatically over their conflict in
ideals, because of a love that can not
help but be jealous.
Hester's persistent indifference to
Monica's values cut the older woman
so deeply, that she grows to hate her
son's wife. The interest steadily
mounts as the situation grows more
tense, and the hatred more bitter.
Technically, the workmanship of the
growing climax is superb, but right
here lies perhaps the only defect of
the book —it reads almost like a de
tective novel in the faultless chain of
circumstances that lead up to its sin
gularly poignant crisis. The web is
