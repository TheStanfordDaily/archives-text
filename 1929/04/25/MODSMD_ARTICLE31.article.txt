# SIDELINE SLANTS...
## THREE YEARS STRAIGHT? 
### 
When Dink Templeton and his crew
of Cardinal tracksters hop the rattler
here for Philadelphia on the afternoon
of May 24, they will be en route to
the 1929 meet of the Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association of Amer
ica, as favorites to win this nationally
famous track and field exhibition for
the third straight year.
Versatility has characterized the
Cards' 1929 track team. With such
stars as Ward Edmonds, Eric
Krenz, Harlow Rothert, and Hec
Dyer, all participating in two or
more events, Coach Templeton
has always been assured of at
least 30 points. Then add to this I
great array such stars as Alex
McKinnon, Johnny Morrison, Cap
tain Ross Nichols, Virgil Dowell,
Walt Hulsman, Johnny Lauritzen,
Leo Kibby, Bill Sparling, and nu
merous others, it is no wonder
that Stanford's great track coach
can smile when the 1.C.4-A. meet
is mentioned.
Unless there is a train wreck on the
way East, the Redshirts should make
it three straight without much trou
ble. In the two weight events alone
they should take from fifteen to
eighteen points. Rothert and Krenz
are scheduled to finish one, two in
the shot, with Forster in fourth or
fifth place. In the discus Krenz is
figured to win hands down, while his
teammates, McLeod and Rothert,
should garner at least two or three
points.
The javelin throw should afford
some keen competition among Pacific
Coast athletes, although the East al
ways shows a good deal of strength in
this number. Kibby and Sparling will
probably do the honors for Stanford,
and are generally conceded a good
chance to take at least two or three
points.
Virgil Dowell should annex from
three to five points in the broad jump
if he continues to leap over 24 feet as
he did last Saturday against Califor
nia. His sophomore teammate, Arnold
West, who has been jumping between

the 23- and 24-foot mark consistently
during the past two weeks, should also
break into the scoring column.
In the pole vault Ward Ed
monds, the three-event man, will
represent the Cards. His main
competition should be Fred Sturdy
of Yale whom he defeated in an
exhibition at Seattle the latter
part of last month, and Jack Wil
liams, the Trojan luminary, who
defeated him here on April 6.
Edmonds, according to the pres
ent schedule, will compete in two
events, his old favorite, the pole
vault, and the one in which he
has shown so much promise this
year, the low sticks. Captain Ross
Nichols will defend his 1929 title
in the high hurdles, and unless he
falls down and breaks a leg,
should finish ahead of the field.
These two men alone should col
lect a total of at least seven
points in their two events.
Hec Dyer and Johnny Morrison may
be the ones to furnish the big surprises
in the Philadelphia meet. Dyer has
shown steady improvement through
out the season, and if he runs in only
one of the sprint events, the 220, and
It seems not at all unlikely that he
will, Stanford should cop another two
or three points.
Morrison in the quarter mile, al
though he has failed to make any
startling times so far this season, may
come through in this meet for a
fourth or fifth and help to swell the
Redshirt total.
Stanford in past seasons has de
pended to a great extent on her
strength in the field. Even when
she sent some of her much-her
alded speed merchants East they
failed to come through, the weath
er or the track always seeming to
handicap them. This year the
Cards are rated a little stronger
on the track, with their field
; strength about on a par with past
years. If the track men come
through, Stanford should run up a
bigger total than she made in 1928
—43 points. But even at the most
conservative estimate they should
garner at least 30 to 35, which,
judging by the scores of previous
years, should be good for a first
place, and the 1.C.4-A. title for the
third straight time.

monds, the three-event man, will
represent the Cards. His main
competition should be Fred Sturdy
of Yale whom he defeated in an
exhibition at Seattle the latter
part of last month, and Jack Wil
liams, the Trojan luminary, who
defeated him here on April 6.
Edmonds, according to the pres
ent schedule, will compete in two
events, his old favorite, the pole
vault, and the one in which he
has shown so much promise this
year, the low sticks. Captain Ross
Nichols will defend his 1929 title
in the high hurdles, and unless he
falls down and breaks a leg,
should finish ahead of the field.
These two men alone should col
lect a total of at least seven
points in their two events.
Hec Dyer and Johnny Morrison may
be the ones to furnish the big surprises
in the Philadelphia meet. Dyer has
shown steady improvement through
out the season, and if he runs in only
one of the sprint events, the 220, and
It seems not at all unlikely that he
will, Stanford should cop another two
or three points.
Morrison in the quarter mile, al
though he has failed to make any
startling times so far this season, may
come through in this meet for a
fourth or fifth and help to swell the
Redshirt total.
Stanford in past seasons has de
pended to a great extent on her
strength in the field. Even when
she sent some of her much-her
alded speed merchants East they
failed to come through, the weath
er or the track always seeming to
handicap them. This year the
Cards are rated a little stronger
on the track, with their field
; strength about on a par with past
years. If the track men come
through, Stanford should run up a
bigger total than she made in 1928
—43 points. But even at the most
conservative estimate they should
garner at least 30 to 35, which,
judging by the scores of previous
years, should be good for a first
place, and the 1.C.4-A. title for the
third straight time.

When Dink Templeton and his crew
of Cardinal tracksters hop the rattler
here for Philadelphia on the afternoon
of May 24, they will be en route to
the 1929 meet of the Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association of Amer
ica, as favorites to win this nationally
famous track and field exhibition for
the third straight year.
Versatility has characterized the
Cards' 1929 track team. With such
stars as Ward Edmonds, Eric
Krenz, Harlow Rothert, and Hec
Dyer, all participating in two or
more events, Coach Templeton
has always been assured of at
least 30 points. Then add to this I
great array such stars as Alex
McKinnon, Johnny Morrison, Cap
tain Ross Nichols, Virgil Dowell,
Walt Hulsman, Johnny Lauritzen,
Leo Kibby, Bill Sparling, and nu
merous others, it is no wonder
that Stanford's great track coach
can smile when the 1.C.4-A. meet
is mentioned.
Unless there is a train wreck on the
way East, the Redshirts should make
it three straight without much trou
ble. In the two weight events alone
they should take from fifteen to
eighteen points. Rothert and Krenz
are scheduled to finish one, two in
the shot, with Forster in fourth or
fifth place. In the discus Krenz is
figured to win hands down, while his
teammates, McLeod and Rothert,
should garner at least two or three
points.
The javelin throw should afford
some keen competition among Pacific
Coast athletes, although the East al
ways shows a good deal of strength in
this number. Kibby and Sparling will
probably do the honors for Stanford,
and are generally conceded a good
chance to take at least two or three
points.
Virgil Dowell should annex from
three to five points in the broad jump
if he continues to leap over 24 feet as
he did last Saturday against Califor
nia. His sophomore teammate, Arnold
West, who has been jumping between

the 23- and 24-foot mark consistently
during the past two weeks, should also
break into the scoring column.
In the pole vault Ward Ed

When Dink Templeton and his crew
of Cardinal tracksters hop the rattler
here for Philadelphia on the afternoon
of May 24, they will be en route to
the 1929 meet of the Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association of Amer
ica, as favorites to win this nationally
famous track and field exhibition for
the third straight year.
Versatility has characterized the
Cards' 1929 track team. With such
stars as Ward Edmonds, Eric
Krenz, Harlow Rothert, and Hec
Dyer, all participating in two or
more events, Coach Templeton
has always been assured of at
least 30 points. Then add to this I
great array such stars as Alex
McKinnon, Johnny Morrison, Cap
tain Ross Nichols, Virgil Dowell,
Walt Hulsman, Johnny Lauritzen,
Leo Kibby, Bill Sparling, and nu
merous others, it is no wonder
that Stanford's great track coach
can smile when the 1.C.4-A. meet
is mentioned.
Unless there is a train wreck on the
way East, the Redshirts should make
it three straight without much trou
ble. In the two weight events alone
they should take from fifteen to
eighteen points. Rothert and Krenz
are scheduled to finish one, two in
the shot, with Forster in fourth or
fifth place. In the discus Krenz is
figured to win hands down, while his
teammates, McLeod and Rothert,
should garner at least two or three
points.
The javelin throw should afford
some keen competition among Pacific
Coast athletes, although the East al
ways shows a good deal of strength in
this number. Kibby and Sparling will
probably do the honors for Stanford,
and are generally conceded a good
chance to take at least two or three
points.
Virgil Dowell should annex from
three to five points in the broad jump
if he continues to leap over 24 feet as
he did last Saturday against Califor
nia. His sophomore teammate, Arnold
West, who has been jumping between

the 23- and 24-foot mark consistently
during the past two weeks, should also
break into the scoring column.
In the pole vault Ward Ed
monds, the three-event man, will
represent the Cards. His main
competition should be Fred Sturdy
of Yale whom he defeated in an
exhibition at Seattle the latter
part of last month, and Jack Wil
liams, the Trojan luminary, who
defeated him here on April 6.
Edmonds, according to the pres
ent schedule, will compete in two
events, his old favorite, the pole
vault, and the one in which he
has shown so much promise this
year, the low sticks. Captain Ross
Nichols will defend his 1929 title
in the high hurdles, and unless he
falls down and breaks a leg,
should finish ahead of the field.
These two men alone should col
lect a total of at least seven
points in their two events.
Hec Dyer and Johnny Morrison may
be the ones to furnish the big surprises
in the Philadelphia meet. Dyer has
shown steady improvement through
out the season, and if he runs in only
one of the sprint events, the 220, and
It seems not at all unlikely that he
will, Stanford should cop another two
or three points.
Morrison in the quarter mile, al
though he has failed to make any
startling times so far this season, may
come through in this meet for a
fourth or fifth and help to swell the
Redshirt total.
Stanford in past seasons has de
pended to a great extent on her
strength in the field. Even when
she sent some of her much-her
alded speed merchants East they
failed to come through, the weath
er or the track always seeming to
handicap them. This year the
Cards are rated a little stronger
on the track, with their field
; strength about on a par with past
years. If the track men come
through, Stanford should run up a
bigger total than she made in 1928
—43 points. But even at the most
conservative estimate they should
garner at least 30 to 35, which,
judging by the scores of previous
years, should be good for a first
place, and the 1.C.4-A. title for the
third straight time.
