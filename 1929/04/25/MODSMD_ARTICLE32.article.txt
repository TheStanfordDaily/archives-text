# DEANS OF MEN AS EDUCATIONAL FACTORS STRESSED BY CULVER AT NATIONAL MEET
## 
### 
"There is still plenty of genuine ro
mance and adventure in education.
There is still the call for pioneers.
There is still the demand for sacrifice
and self-denial," said George Bliss
Culver in his presidential address at
the Eleventh Annual Conference of
Deans of Men held on April 11, 12,
and 13 in Washington, D.C.
Seventy colleges were represented
at the meeting held under the auspices
of the George Washington University.
"The Dean of Men as an Educational
Factor" was the subject of Dean Cul
ver's speech. Dr. Wilbur was another
Stanford speaker on the conference
program. He spoke on "Shifting stand
ards of Student Conduct." Professor
A. T. Murray participated in a wreath
laying ceremony held at Washington's
tomb at Mount Vernon.
In discussing the dean of men as
an educational factor, Dean Culver
said, "I believe that we should try to
remember that we represent the hit
man element in education. A high
I.Q. frequently opens the academic
doors but it provides no educational
endowment policies. There are many
individual educational problems that
are not set forth in the Registrar's

| office and not touched on in the class
] room, problems that are of utmost
importance to the student."
"It is an easy and somewhat popular
gesture to state that the Great War,
the Eighteenth Amendment, and the
automobile, together with easy money,
have upset, demoralized, and com
j pletely changed all our educational
| outlook and processes. I believe that
this is not true. They are simply new
problems supplanting old ones.
"If we are qualified by education
and experience in life, if we are happy
1 and human, and are more interested
in helping others than in adding to
j our personal prestige, our lives and
! work will be much worth while. Let
us not become mere traffic officers,
halting or moving machines, nor filling
I station attendants measuring out gas
or oil by tho gallon or quart or wiping
| off windshields, or preachers or moral
' ists. We are consultant engineers in
j the great science of life.
"David Starr Jordan always said
j that the world steps aside for the
i man who knows where he is going. I
believe that it does more than that.
It runs forward to meet him and
points the road ahead."
