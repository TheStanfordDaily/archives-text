Tarsus, Turkey-in-Asia, April
10. —The ancient ceremony of
kissing the bride has been banned
here by the Mayor of Tarsus. He
claims that the custom has caused
such a rush that a dignified wed
ding often became the scene of a
small-sized riot.
A SURER CURE
The Mayor of a Turkish town
(According to dispatches)
Has definitely come to frown
On osculation matches.
The headline writer tells the news
In "Mayor Bans Bride Kissing." |
A casual reader might excuse
Considerable hissing.
It seems each Turkish nuptial day
Is featured by a riot.
The Mayor only seeks a way
To keep a wedding quiet.
But yet another plan! We hide
Our cynic crown politely.
We seen the pictured Turkish bride !
If we remember rightly.
They'd scarcely cause the heart to ;
fail-
Not even the most stony.
So why not raise the bridal veil
Before the ceremony?
