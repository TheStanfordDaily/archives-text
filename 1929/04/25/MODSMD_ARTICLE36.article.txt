Socking the slow ball curves of
three pitchers all over the diamond
for a total of twenty hits and twenty
five runs, Alpha Tau Omega estab
lished a new high scoring record for
the 1929 intramural baseball season,
when it swamped Theta Chi yesterday
afternoon in a five-inning game.
After pitching pretty fair ball in the
first inning, Whitney Wright blew up
iu the second frame under a barrage
of hits and was touched for eleven
runs. R. Howe replaced Wright on
the mound for Theta Chi und fared
but little better under the heavy
A.T.O. attack. Don Carr chucked for
the losers in the fifth inning, and held
the winning team to a single run.
Theta Chi, besides playing ragged
ball in the field, was weak at the bat.
Wood, pitching for A.T.0., held the
losers to four scattered hits and
blanked them during the first four
frames. He retired eight batters by
the strike-out method.
Stark Fox caught a good game for
the winners and led the batters with
three safe blows out of three times at
bat, one of them going for a home run.
Wood also slugged one out for four
bags.
In the only other game of the day
the Barbarians played fast ball to shut
out Alpha Kappa Lambda. Three
pitchers did the chucking for the in
dependent team and let the fraternity
players down with five hits. The Bar
barians piled up a comfortable lead
in the first inning, when they rapped
out ten hits to score eight runs, and
then coasted in to an easy win.
The infield on the winning outfit
played a speedy game, turning in a
neat double play in the fifth, Wilson
to B. Queen to Farrand. John Truman
showed up well at bat and hit a long
home run to score two on the bases
ahead of him.
HI Campo and Sigma Alpha Epsilon
each won by forfeit, as their oppon
ents failed to put in an appearance.
