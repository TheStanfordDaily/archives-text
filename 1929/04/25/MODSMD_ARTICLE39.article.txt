# BALL CLASSIC NEARING Record Crowd Is Expected PRESS FAVORED TO WIN
## 
### 
With the Daily-Press baseball game |
only four days in the offing, interest,
up at the Press Building is at a high
peak. Early reports indicate a record-1
breaking crowd and negotiations are I
under way with the B.A.C. to provide !
more bleachers for the classic. Mathe- i
matical calculations are the chief j
topic of conversation at the Daily Of-1
fice, and betting is rampant behind
the lumber piles in the Corporation
Yard.
"Last year we beat that mob of
has-beens by a score of 15 to 4, and
this year we won't give 'em a single j
run," remarked Ernie Hipp, captain j
and third-baseman of the Press outfit. ;
"Undoubtedly we will be forced to
play against a bunch of ringers, but j
as long as they don't camouflage the j
bases or bribe the umpires, we can't j
lope."
Jim Frank, first-sacker and honor-!
ary captain of the local aggregation, j
is the only one who has any confi- J
dence in the ink-slinkers. "Maybe we j
never have won a game," he said,
"but our looks will win it for us this
year. The Press hasn't even got a '
prayer."
Meanwhile the day draws closer and !
indications point to an overwhelming j
victory for the typesetters. It looks
bad for the Dailyâ€”yes, very bad.
