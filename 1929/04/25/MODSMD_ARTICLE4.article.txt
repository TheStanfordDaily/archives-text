"National-mindedness and Interna

fessor George Herbert Mead, of the
University of Chicago, in the Little
Theatre at 4:15 o'clock this afternoon.
Mead has made a name for himself
both in Chicago and in other cities as
a moral and intellectual influence,
especially in the universities of the
country. He is a graduate of Harvard,
and studied for three years in the uni
versities of Leipzig and Berlin. He
has been instructor, assistant profes
sor, and associate professor of philo
sophy in the universities of Michigan
and of Chicago, and is now serving as
Mills Lecturer in philosophy at the
University of California for the pres
ent semester.
Mead has also been an important
member of investigating commissions
concerned with the social and muni
cipal problems of Chicago, and for
several terms was president of the
Chicago City Club. He is a member
of the American Philological Associa
tion, of the American Philosophical
Association, and of the American As
sociation for the Advancement of
Science. The Philological Association
recently appointed him to serve as
Paul Carus Lecturer for 1931, because
of his extensive knowledge in the field
of philosophical problems in natural
science.
