# CONVALESCENT CHILDREN ARE LOYAL TO STANFORD; LEARN SCHOOL SONGS
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
"I like to hear that Stanford has
beaten California," said one of the
sun-browned boys at the Convalescent
Home yesterday afternoon when the
twenty children of the Babcock unit,
clad in red and blue coveralls, scam
pered out into the playground.
"We can sing almost all of the
Stanford songs," chimed in another
boy as a group gathered to have its
reading lesson from Mrs. Harrington
who teaches them the three R's under
the tall eucalyptus trees of the old
Stanford farm. "We want to hear the
band play, though, and I hope it
comes this year," continued one of
the children who remembered the stir
ring songs played last year at Labor
Day.
School is carried on out of doors
for the children who can be seen every
afternoon from 2:30 to 5 o'clock pon
dering over their lessons in the girls'
tree-house. Yesterday little Ruby was
getting her "sums"; Arthur was try
ing to follow the words in his book
as the teacher read to him; and Dor
othy was puzzling over a composition
she had to write on the picture of a
party of children. Dorothy's composi
tion is quite a masterpiece of its own
type; it follows:
"Marys Birday Party
"Little Mary is going to have a
birday. She is nviting her frends
to her birday party. She will be
sex year old. She is going to star
school. Her father give her a littl
purs and a nice beg dill. Mary had
a good tim at her birday party."
While Dorothy was struggling over
her "birday party," little Anatole was
working on a literary tid-bit which
proved quite heretical in its view
point. His paper was:
"The Boys Wagon
Once there was a boy named
Bobby. Bobby got the wagon for
his birthday. It was red. He would
ride his wagon to the store. One
day as lie was riding his wagon
down a hill it hit a rock and Bobby
fell out. The paint came off the
wagon and Bobby said he would
have to paint it again. So he went
home and told his mother. His
mother said he could not paint his
wagon ontil his father came home.
Bobby did not want to wait that

long so he went out in the back
yeard and got some red paint and
painted it anyway."
Life at the Convalescent Home is
one of a peaceful and happy commun
ity There is a regular schedule, for
the day, and the children run and
play in Stanford's sunshine until th<;v
have regained, or in some cases,
gained their health. All the children
are happy for one reason or another,
but perhaps the unique reason is the
surprised remark of one little Hamp
ton Stanford that he "liked to live at
the Home best because he never had
to wash the dishes."
