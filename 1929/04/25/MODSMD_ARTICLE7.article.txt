# ITALIAN PROFESSOR, VISITING CAMPUS, SCORES MUSSOLINI
## Dr. Gaetano Salvemini Describes Dictator as Combination of Theodore Roosevelt, Barnum, and Al Capone 
### MARGARET CUMMINGS 
"Mussolini? I will give you the prescription—thirty-three per cent Roose
velt, thirty-three per cent Barnum, and thirty-four per cent A1 Capone!"
In this formula we find the American counterpart of Italy's dictator, thinks
I)r. Gaetano Salvemini, whose independent political thinking makes him
quite unpopular with the Fascist regime. Dr. Salvemini, a campus visitor
yesterday, was formerly a professor of modern history at the University of
Florence. He is the author of several books, and has recently released one

? on "Italy and the Fascist Regime."
His dark eyes twinkling with mirth,
and with the force of his abounding
vitality of mind and personality, Dr.
Salvemini pictures the present status
of Italy and the Italians under the
domination of Mussolini.
"The rule of Mussolini is the rule of
an armed and organized minority in
control of an unarmed and unorgan
ized majority. Mussolini's opponents
are deprived of freedom of the press,
freedom of speech, and assembly.
That makes Mussolini always right,
because he has no contradiction.
"But don't you think Mussolini has
been good for Italy in that he came
into power when the country needed
a strong hand?" "No. Mussolini has
j been an evil for Italy. His justifica
■ tion has been an insult to the Italian
| people since he has made the world
I believe they could not take care of
; themselves and run their own govern
ment.
"He is an evil because he is destroy
! ing the human spirit of the people.
iYou can't teach men to be citizens by
; means of bludgeons and castor oil.
j Even the cry of economic prosperity
! has been a false justification of Mus
j solini's rule, since in the last three
| years Italy has been going through
I one of the most severe economic
| crises in her history. The prevailing
; catastrophic economic conditions are
' revealed in the commercial reports
J of the American attache.
"You Americans who travel in Italy
are likely to be favorably impressed
i with the Fascist regime, because it is
■ the wealthy people in Italy particu
' larly who are supporting it. Visiting
j Americans, who 'do' the fifteen im
portant Italian cities in fifteen days
! obtain their impressions from this one
i class. Besides, your guide is always
! a good Fascist who would find himself
j in jail if he didn't sing the praises of
Mussolini. If you could speak Italian,
j and lived in Italy for six months
! where you could talk to the worker
! and see the things underground, it
would all appear much different from
the get from the facade."
Salvemini explained that the majority
of the middle classes and workers op
pose Mussolini, as do the intelligent
sia.
Dr. Salvemini regards the pact be
tween Mussolini and the Pope as a
sign that the Dictator felt himself
> weak, and so had to give in to the
| Pope, and to substitute a system of
