Mouse coats, beach coats, evening coats, sport coats,
street coats —isn't a lot of life spent in a coat?
Any college woman who is a serious student of style,
realizes the significance of the coat and the special
smartness of the velvet coat, dynamically seamed and
stitched, for Summer wear. The College Shop has
them for her and also has flannels and tweeds if they
are her preference.
