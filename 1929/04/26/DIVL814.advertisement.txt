Sad World
Ysung k%m
DREAMS THAT COME TRUE
I am sitting alone in my room tonight,
Dreaming and smoking my old cob
pipe;
I smoke and dream, and dream until
I got a plot, and get a thrill.
I am in the writing game, you see;
And the pipe-dreams softly bring to me
Scenes of carnage where the red blood
ran,
And the dreams all come from a bright
Blue can.
It's just a can of Edgeworth-cut—
Fragrant as flowers —sweet as a nut;
Of all Fate's kindly gifts to man
la this gift of dreams from the bright
Blue can.
I sit me down at eve, to smoke;
And soon am wrapped in a magic cloak;
It has banished trouble, it has ban
ished pain,
And the sad old world is young again.
