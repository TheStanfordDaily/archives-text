# German Discount Rate Boosted By Reichbank Heads
## Transfer Clause of Dawes Plan Provides for Aid In Money Decline 
### 
BERLIN, April 25. (/P)—The Reiclis
bank today raised its discount rate
from G. 5 to 7.5 per cent.
The action, delayed as long as pos
sible in order not to hamper German
industry, was believed by some to
have been taken by the directors of
the bank at the request of the Dawes
Plan transfer committee which mot
yesterday in Paris.
It was considered as possible re
lieving a situation brought on by
heavy gold and currency exports and
continued heavy domostic demands on
the bank which had depleted its gold
reserve.
PARIS, April 25. action
of the Reichsbank in raising its dis
count rate came on the day after ex
pert consideration of a situation which
threatened breakdown of the Dawes
Plan, upon which the entire European
post-war debt structure is built.
A closed session of the Dawes Plan
transfer committee was held yester
day at the call of S. Parker Gilbert,
agent general for reparations, to con
sider the situation represented by con
tinued large withdrawals of foreign
currency and export of gold from the
German bank. While the transfer com-

raittee issued no communique it was
said they had been told this depletion
of the bank's gold reserves threatened
a fall soon to its legal level.

The transfer clause of the Dawes
Plan provides for just such a contin
gency, affording protection to German
currency in the event the payments
under the Dawes Plan seem likely to
endanger it. Thus, under its function
ing, Germany might even be released
from payment of part or all of any
annuities until the situation was reme
died.
