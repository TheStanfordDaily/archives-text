"When we have completed our work
in this field, we shall understand better
the demands that are made on the human
organism by the various kinds of mental
work." Dr. Walter R. Miles, professor
of experimental psychology, was explain
ing the work he has been doing recently
on the measurement of the loss of weight
of the human, body during sleep, and the
similar experiments he is planning to
carry out in measuring the loss of weight
during waking hours.
Dr. Miles has been working on one of
the oldest problems in the field of psy
chology, and one that has never been
settled. Sanctorius Sanctorius, a profes
sor of medicine at Padua who later prac
ticed medicine at Venice, constructed a
balance arrangement in 1614 to measure
the loss of weight of the human body
through respiration. At that time it was
not known that the body also lost weight
through the skin. Sanctorius made cx

tensive investigations, and from the data
he gathered he formulated a large num
ber of rules of health. His entire experi
mental studies were centered about the
belief that the loss of weight had an
important bearing on the health. Sanc
torius found that the body lost weight
during sleep, and formulated the aphor
ism that: "If the night's rest be less than
usual, there is a diminution of the ex
halation of perspirable material . .
Dr. Miles observed his own weight
night and morning for forty consecutive
days in his investigations on loss of
weight during sleep. He found that when
he slept six and one-half hours or less,
he lost thirty-six grams per hour. When
he slept between six and one-half and
seven and one-half hours, his weight loss
averaged thirty-eight grams, and during
eight or more hours' sleep, he lost forty
two grams per hour. In the experiment,
therefore, he substantiated the results of
Sanctorius.
Dr. Miles' investigations differ from
those of most other experimenters in that
he is looking for the effects of psycho
logical and not physical factors. He has
purchased a large balance scale which
he has rigged up with a chair in place
of one of the pans. With this apparatus,
Dr. Miles will measure the loss of weight
of the human body during waking hours,
measuring the variation caused by a num- ;
her of changing factors. He will com
pare losses during time of mental effort!
with losses during periods of comparative
relaxation, both physical and mental. The
scale is so delicate, despite its size, that ,
it will register a change in weight of a
one-millionth part of the weight of the
average man, and the losses will be re
corded by taking one-gram weights from
the balance pan as the weight changes.
The experiment is expected to be more
satisfactory than others that have been
performed along the same lines because
the subject will be free of restraint dur
ing the period of observation, and lie
cause the factors of actual discomfort,
so often present in psychological experi
ments, will be eliminated. Dr. F. G. Ben
edict of the Carnegie Nutrition Labora
tory performed an experiment similar to
the ones worked out by Dr. Miles, but all
observations were from the standpoint of !
metabolism. Dr. Miles was formerly as
sociated with the Carnegie laboratory,
where he acted as psychologist for eight
years.
By means of comparisons between the
aged and the young, the adult and the
child, much information will be available
to science concerning the amounts of en
ergy needed for various kinds of mental

work, according to Dr. Miles. There is
also a possibility that the work may be
linked up more closely with studies of
diets and other physiological problems.

he slept six and one-half hours or less,
he lost thirty-six grams per hour. When
he slept between six and one-half and
seven and one-half hours, his weight loss
averaged thirty-eight grams, and during
eight or more hours' sleep, he lost forty
two grams per hour. In the experiment,
therefore, he substantiated the results of
Sanctorius.
Dr. Miles' investigations differ from
those of most other experimenters in that
he is looking for the effects of psycho
logical and not physical factors. He has
purchased a large balance scale which
he has rigged up with a chair in place
of one of the pans. With this apparatus,
Dr. Miles will measure the loss of weight
of the human body during waking hours,
measuring the variation caused by a num- ;
her of changing factors. He will com
pare losses during time of mental effort!
with losses during periods of comparative
relaxation, both physical and mental. The
scale is so delicate, despite its size, that ,
it will register a change in weight of a
one-millionth part of the weight of the
average man, and the losses will be re
corded by taking one-gram weights from
the balance pan as the weight changes.
The experiment is expected to be more
satisfactory than others that have been
performed along the same lines because
the subject will be free of restraint dur
ing the period of observation, and lie
cause the factors of actual discomfort,
so often present in psychological experi
ments, will be eliminated. Dr. F. G. Ben
edict of the Carnegie Nutrition Labora
tory performed an experiment similar to
the ones worked out by Dr. Miles, but all
observations were from the standpoint of !
metabolism. Dr. Miles was formerly as
sociated with the Carnegie laboratory,
where he acted as psychologist for eight
years.
By means of comparisons between the
aged and the young, the adult and the
child, much information will be available
to science concerning the amounts of en
ergy needed for various kinds of mental

work, according to Dr. Miles. There is
also a possibility that the work may be
linked up more closely with studies of
diets and other physiological problems.

"When we have completed our work
in this field, we shall understand better
the demands that are made on the human
organism by the various kinds of mental
work." Dr. Walter R. Miles, professor
of experimental psychology, was explain
ing the work he has been doing recently
on the measurement of the loss of weight
of the human, body during sleep, and the
similar experiments he is planning to
carry out in measuring the loss of weight
during waking hours.
Dr. Miles has been working on one of
the oldest problems in the field of psy
chology, and one that has never been
settled. Sanctorius Sanctorius, a profes
sor of medicine at Padua who later prac
ticed medicine at Venice, constructed a
balance arrangement in 1614 to measure
the loss of weight of the human body
through respiration. At that time it was
not known that the body also lost weight
through the skin. Sanctorius made cx

tensive investigations, and from the data
he gathered he formulated a large num
ber of rules of health. His entire experi
mental studies were centered about the
belief that the loss of weight had an
important bearing on the health. Sanc
torius found that the body lost weight
during sleep, and formulated the aphor
ism that: "If the night's rest be less than
usual, there is a diminution of the ex
halation of perspirable material . .
Dr. Miles observed his own weight
night and morning for forty consecutive
days in his investigations on loss of
weight during sleep. He found that when
he slept six and one-half hours or less,
he lost thirty-six grams per hour. When
he slept between six and one-half and
seven and one-half hours, his weight loss
