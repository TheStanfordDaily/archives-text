"When we have completed our work
in this field, we shall understand better
the demands that are made on the human
organism by the various kinds of mental
work." Dr. Walter R. Miles, professor
of experimental psychology, was explain
ing the work he has been doing recently
on the measurement of the loss of weight
of the human, body during sleep, and the
similar experiments he is planning to
carry out in measuring the loss of weight
during waking hours.
Dr. Miles has been working on one of
the oldest problems in the field of psy
chology, and one that has never been
settled. Sanctorius Sanctorius, a profes
sor of medicine at Padua who later prac
ticed medicine at Venice, constructed a
balance arrangement in 1614 to measure
the loss of weight of the human body
through respiration. At that time it was
not known that the body also lost weight
through the skin. Sanctorius made cx

tensive investigations, and from the data
he gathered he formulated a large num
ber of rules of health. His entire experi
mental studies were centered about the
belief that the loss of weight had an
important bearing on the health. Sanc
torius found that the body lost weight
during sleep, and formulated the aphor
ism that: "If the night's rest be less than
usual, there is a diminution of the ex
halation of perspirable material . .
Dr. Miles observed his own weight
night and morning for forty consecutive
days in his investigations on loss of
weight during sleep. He found that when
he slept six and one-half hours or less,
he lost thirty-six grams per hour. When
he slept between six and one-half and
seven and one-half hours, his weight loss
averaged thirty-eight grams, and during
eight or more hours' sleep, he lost forty
two grams per hour. In the experiment,
therefore, he substantiated the results of
Sanctorius.
Dr. Miles' investigations differ from
those of most other experimenters in that
