# SPECIAL SESSION PASSES BILL TO RELIEVE FARMER
## Proposed Bill Would Create Federal Farm Board With Control of Loaning Funds House Passes New Measure By Vote of 367 to 34 as Debenture Plan Is Ousted 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 25 (/P).
—The new farm relief bill having the
support of the Hoover administration
was pased by the House today just ten
days after the convening of the special
session of Congress, which was called
primarily to provide means for alleviating
agricultural ills.
The vote was 367 to 34, only two Re
publicans being among those in oppo
sition—Tinkham of Massachusetts and
Stafford of Wisconsin, the latter a new
member.
The House bill would launch the gov
ernment upon a program which its advo
cates contended would enable the farmer
to help himself to prosperity. It would
create a Federal Farm Board with a
revolving fund of $500,000,000 to be used
in loans to co-operative associations.

The support given it by both Republi
cans and Democrats brought the bill
through the House unchanged in any ma
jor respect from the form in which it
came from the agriculture committee.
The three minor changes that were made
were proposed by committee members to
clarify the language of the bill.
The House vote was taken after a
week of discussion and after unsuccess
ful efforts had been made to incorporate
in the measure the equalization fee prin
ciple of the twice vetoed McNary-Hau
gen bill.
A futile effort also was made to in
corporate the export debenture proposal.
The vote found most of the former
advocates of the debenture plan and the
equalization fee ranged alongside their
former opponents in support of a bill
that is minus both of those features. The
majority of those who voted against the
bill were advocates of one or both of
these proposals who still hope that the
bill as it finally emerges from the Sen
ate may be changed in several respects.
The bill which now goes to the Senate
would create a Federal Farm Board with
broad powers to promote the orderly
marketing of agricultural products.
The measure was sent to the Senate,
where a bill with the disputed export
debenture plan is pending. The House
had refused to accept that method of
farm relief, which was inserted in the
Senate measure by its agriculture com
mittee after vigorous disapproval by
! President Hoover.

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 25 (/P).
—The new farm relief bill having the
support of the Hoover administration
was pased by the House today just ten
days after the convening of the special
session of Congress, which was called
primarily to provide means for alleviating
agricultural ills.
The vote was 367 to 34, only two Re
publicans being among those in oppo
sition—Tinkham of Massachusetts and
Stafford of Wisconsin, the latter a new
member.
The House bill would launch the gov
ernment upon a program which its advo
cates contended would enable the farmer
to help himself to prosperity. It would
create a Federal Farm Board with a
revolving fund of $500,000,000 to be used
in loans to co-operative associations.

The support given it by both Republi
cans and Democrats brought the bill
through the House unchanged in any ma
jor respect from the form in which it
came from the agriculture committee.
The three minor changes that were made
were proposed by committee members to
clarify the language of the bill.
The House vote was taken after a
week of discussion and after unsuccess
ful efforts had been made to incorporate
in the measure the equalization fee prin
ciple of the twice vetoed McNary-Hau
gen bill.
A futile effort also was made to in
corporate the export debenture proposal.
The vote found most of the former
advocates of the debenture plan and the
equalization fee ranged alongside their
former opponents in support of a bill
that is minus both of those features. The
majority of those who voted against the
bill were advocates of one or both of
these proposals who still hope that the
bill as it finally emerges from the Sen
ate may be changed in several respects.
The bill which now goes to the Senate
would create a Federal Farm Board with
broad powers to promote the orderly
marketing of agricultural products.
The measure was sent to the Senate,
where a bill with the disputed export
debenture plan is pending. The House
had refused to accept that method of
farm relief, which was inserted in the
Senate measure by its agriculture com
mittee after vigorous disapproval by
! President Hoover.
