# Millions Of Dollars Lost By Cattle Growing Horns
## 
### 
TORONTO, Ontario, April 24. (/P)â€”
Millions of dollars are lost, says the
Canadian Packers' Council, because
cattle are allowed to grow horns. Not
only do cattle with horns injure other
animals, but they sometimes suffer
market discrimination.
Horns, the council says, are a strik
ing example of the desire to retain
established characteristics of certain
purebred strains even after those
characteristics have lost their useful
ness. Breeders of dairy cattle are
pointed to as particularly susceptible
to the practice.
