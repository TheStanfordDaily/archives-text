is one rich in history and in literature.

works, including of course a number
from "Paradise Lost," illustrated with
pictures by William Blake, and from
many rare illustrated works on Milton.
Mr. Ellsworth tells the story of the
translating of Pepys' Diary from the
faded pages in shorthand, 3000 of them,
making when written out in longhand

Bunyan is treated by the lecturer in an
interesting way, with pictures of re

ress."
In his previous appearances at Stan

He remembers much that these writers
said to him, and thus brings to his lec
tures an anecdotal flavor.
After his retirement from publishing,
Ellsworth brought the results of his lit
erary experiences into the realm of lec
turing and has made a unique place for
himself in the programs of schools and
colleges throughout the country. From
his careful researches into the life and
customs of various periods in English
literature, he is able to present literary
subjects in each case against a pictorial
background of lantern slides specially
prepared from paintings in color and
from rare prints and manuscripts.
The seventeenth century, covered by
the lecture on Milton and John Bunyan,
is one rich in history and in literature.
The lecturer makes John Milton the chief
character and the story of his life is
told with readings from his greatest
works, including of course a number
from "Paradise Lost," illustrated with
pictures by William Blake, and from
many rare illustrated works on Milton.
Mr. Ellsworth tells the story of the
translating of Pepys' Diary from the
faded pages in shorthand, 3000 of them,
making when written out in longhand
about 10,000 pages. The life of John
Bunyan is treated by the lecturer in an
interesting way, with pictures of re
cently identified sites of many of the
places described in "The Pilgrim's Prog
ress."
In his previous appearances at Stan
ford, Ellsworth has given lectures on
"The Times of Queen Elizabeth,"
"Shakespeare and Old London," "Dr.
Johnson and His Circle," and "The Age
of Queene Anne."
