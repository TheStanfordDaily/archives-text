"Stanford judicial procedure is very
much advanced," Janet Harris and
Benetta Merner, president and presi
dent-elect of A.W.S. declared on their
return Wednesday from the intercol
legiate convention of women students
held at Norman, Oklahoma. "Only a
few schools allow the power of student
suspension to their student govern
ments," they continued further.
They reported that the four days of
the convention, from April 16-20, were
fpont in discussion of vocational guid
ance for women, international affairs,
and the activity programs of the wo
men's governing bodies of the various
colleges. Under the last topic social
and judicial regulations, activities, and
regulations, were considered. The dis
cussion of international relations in
cluded particular consideratoin of

foreign student problems.
"This year's convention was exceed
ingly well-handled," Miss Harris said.
Michigan was chosen for the loca
tion of the national convention in
1931. A sectional convention in Wy
oming is being planned for next year.
There were 127 delegates, from sixty
seven universities, at the Norman
convention.
"We were surprised, too," they con
tinued, "at the scarcity of cars in
Norman, until we learned that no j
registered student Is permitted to own
a car. They go everywhere and any- J
where in taxicabs for twenty-five \
cents." They commented also on the J
women's regulations at the Oklahoma
University, stating that women were
supposed to be in at 7 o'clock on week
nights and at 11:30 on week-ends.

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 25 (/P).
' —Postmaster General Brown has his
| hands full of a sticky subject—the suffi-
I ciency of mucilage on the hack of postage
i stamps.
Scores of complaints have reached the
| Postoffice Department that the stamps
| do not carry enough glue and after they
1 have been moistened and placed on let-
I ters they literally jump off or are lost
in transit with the result that the letters
arc returned to the senders.
The Posmaster General is conferring
with members of the Bureau of Engrav
ing and Printing to determine if there is
need of more or better mucilage.
