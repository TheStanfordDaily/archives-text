# Convalescent Home Drive Stanford's Opportunity For Community Service
## 
### 
"The Convalescent Home Drive is
Stanford's one opportunity for service
to the community," Stanford Steinbeck,
who is managing the A.S.S.U. campaign
for funds which begins on the campus
Monday, said yesterday.
"Stanford men and women are well
known for their service to the world
after they leave college, but in this Drive
the students themselves have an oppor
tunity to show their community spirit
and perform a worth-while service," con
tinued Steinbeck. "Most all Eastern and
European universities have their own
special social service work, and it is usu
ally done in the large cities near the
colleges. Stanford is fortunate in having
her own charity right on the campus."
The Drive, under the direction of a
number of committees, will swing into
action on Monday morning. Posters and
stickers, with the various slogans adopt
ed by the advertising committee under
the direction of Helen Stanford, were

distributed on the campus yesterday.
Tags will be sold in Palo Alto Munday
and Tuesday.

Speakers will commence their cam
paign canvass of the living groups Mon
day noon, and it is hoped to establish
"another Stanford record" this year in
the charity Drive. Treasurers will re
port their contributions to the Row and
Hall chairmen Monday night, and the
results of the various living groups will
be printed in the Daily Tuesday morning.

In connection with the Convalescent
Home Drive, the Varsity Theatre will
give a special performance Monday night,
presenting four campus acts of vaude
ville. The Glee Club quartet, Burnell
Gould with his "Maxims and Morals of
Songland," and "Strange Interlocution,"
will be three of the skits given. All mon
ey over the regular costs of the show
will be donated to the Home Fund.

Labor Day will end the official Drive
on Wednesday afternoon. All classes
toill be excused during the afternoon.
