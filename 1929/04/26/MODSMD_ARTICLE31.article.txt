# EUROPEAN ETCHINGS SHOWN IN EXHIBITION AT CAMPUS GALLERY
## Prints by Figura, Hirago, and Coussens Secured by Lemos Last Year 
### 
The collection of prints now being
shown at the Stanford Art Gallery in
cludes specimens from the work of some
of the most prominent figures in Euro
pean art circles, among which may be
named Figura, Hirago, and Coussens.
The exhibition, representing the various
numbers gleaned by Director Pedro Le
mos, of the Stanford Museum, in his
European trip of last year, is an unusual
departure from most of the previous dis
plays in the gallery.
The seventy-eight prints that make up
the collection are composed of three dif
ferent types : line etchings, color etchings,
and wtxxl blocks, and are done in black
and white and color.
Two pleasing numbers are wood blocks
which Mr. Lemos procured in Czecho
slovakia. They are elaborate in design
and emphasize the decorative value of
prints of this nature. One is done in
black and white, and the other in color.
Wood Blocks
'I he wood blocks from Holland are
characterized by perfection of design.
Two of these are the work of a master
of ceramic art, and this quality appears
very definitely in his prints.
Figura's work is outstanding, being
done in colored etching, which in his
numbers represents a combination aqua
tint and hard ground etching. A few of
the prints are done in mono-type. In this,
a zinc plate is used, as in ordinary etch
ing, with the colors painted on the plate,
cither in oil or printer's ink. After the
print is made, it is gone over with the
paint applied directly to its surface. If
two prints are made from the same plate,
the second is called an "echo" print.
Japanese Artists
Three etchings done by Hirago, the
Japanese artist who held an exhibition
here three years ago, are on display. Hi
rago's numbers are noteworthy because
he has employed an original process by
which he obtains an unusual quality in
his mass etching.
Several prints of dogs, birds, and cats
appear in the collection. Although these
subjects are commonplace now on ac
count of their present popularit ywith the
average American collector, Mr. Lemos
felt that their merit from a technical
standpoint was enough to justify them
being added to this group.
New Process
Coussens' numbers are characterized
by a new process, known as soft ground
ctching. Before the ink is put on the
plate, a color wash is painted over it and
this is first printed 011 paper, and then
the ink is stamped on. This method gives
a soft, blurred effect quite different from
the other types of etchings that are
shown.
The most brilliant print in the display
is a wood block of birds, done in a blaz
ing scarlet. It is one of the most interest
ing pieces in the entire group because
01' its vivid coloring, but the softer hued
prints likewise have a charm and deli
cacy of finish that should not be over
looked.

The exhibition, representing the various
numbers gleaned by Director Pedro Le
mos, of the Stanford Museum, in his
European trip of last year, is an unusual
departure from most of the previous dis
plays in the gallery.
The seventy-eight prints that make up
the collection are composed of three dif
ferent types : line etchings, color etchings,
and wtxxl blocks, and are done in black
and white and color.
Two pleasing numbers are wood blocks
which Mr. Lemos procured in Czecho
slovakia. They are elaborate in design
and emphasize the decorative value of
prints of this nature. One is done in
black and white, and the other in color.
Wood Blocks
'I he wood blocks from Holland are
characterized by perfection of design.
Two of these are the work of a master
of ceramic art, and this quality appears
very definitely in his prints.
Figura's work is outstanding, being
done in colored etching, which in his
numbers represents a combination aqua
tint and hard ground etching. A few of
the prints are done in mono-type. In this,
a zinc plate is used, as in ordinary etch
ing, with the colors painted on the plate,
cither in oil or printer's ink. After the
print is made, it is gone over with the
paint applied directly to its surface. If
two prints are made from the same plate,
the second is called an "echo" print.
Japanese Artists
Three etchings done by Hirago, the
Japanese artist who held an exhibition
here three years ago, are on display. Hi
rago's numbers are noteworthy because
he has employed an original process by
which he obtains an unusual quality in
his mass etching.
Several prints of dogs, birds, and cats
appear in the collection. Although these
subjects are commonplace now on ac
count of their present popularit ywith the
average American collector, Mr. Lemos
felt that their merit from a technical
standpoint was enough to justify them
being added to this group.
New Process
Coussens' numbers are characterized
by a new process, known as soft ground
ctching. Before the ink is put on the
plate, a color wash is painted over it and
this is first printed 011 paper, and then
the ink is stamped on. This method gives
a soft, blurred effect quite different from
the other types of etchings that are
shown.
The most brilliant print in the display
is a wood block of birds, done in a blaz
ing scarlet. It is one of the most interest
ing pieces in the entire group because
01' its vivid coloring, but the softer hued
prints likewise have a charm and deli
cacy of finish that should not be over
looked.
The collection of prints now being
shown at the Stanford Art Gallery in
cludes specimens from the work of some
of the most prominent figures in Euro
pean art circles, among which may be
named Figura, Hirago, and Coussens.
