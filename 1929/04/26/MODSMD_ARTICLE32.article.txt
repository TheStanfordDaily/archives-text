# Phi Sigma Kappa, Cuadro Teams Win In Horseshoes
## 
### 
One forfeit and one close match were
the results of yesterday's round of the
Intramural Horseshoe Tournament. The
Phi Sigs took their match when the
Kappa Alpha man failed to show up, and
El Cuadro's barnyard golfers beat the
Sigma Nu's by a total score of 276 to
224.
Sequoia I and El Tigre play today at
4 o'clock and Delta Tau Delta will meet
Theta Delta Chi at 5 o'clock. Both
matches will take place on the intramural
courts near the old varsity tennis courts.
A Titian painting in the Yale Art
Gallery remained unidentified for fif
