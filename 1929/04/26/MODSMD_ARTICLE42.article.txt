# The 						Row Takes Action

### 
This season's rushing, fiasco points to one thing; namely, that that sys
tem of regulations which is entirely ignored by the body of men who
have agreed to obey it is an impossible system. The conduct followed
by fraternity men makes the system of rushing, not the regulations writ
ten down in serious meeting and blatantly scoffed at by those same men.
If closed season rushing is a mere hypocrisy, make open rusing openly
carried out the system. The freshmen could be bothered no more under
an oj>en system than they have been this year under the present preten
sion of fairly regulated rushing.
The Interfraternity Council in closed meeting last night accepted the
resignation of Doug Lewis as chairman and elected Don Muller to that
office. The organization warned fraternities that the system of regula
tions would be carried out during the remainder of the season. Clarifica
tion and revision of the rushing system was recommended.
1 he spirit of the meeting, it is reported, was one evincing a sincere
desire to see the entire affair remedied. If it accomplished nothing else,
the meeting demonstrated an effort to rectify previous abuses.
lo those men on the Row and in the Halls who want to see fair play
a fact in the relations of fraternities and in the relation of Halls and Row,
the entire affair has been a disgusting mess. It has stirred up no end of
animosity and hard feelings over a matter that sinks to insignificance in
its relation to the matters that actually count in University life.
