# That First Million
## 
### 
With exactly five days left in which to complete the "First Million,"
which Stanford with the co-operation of the Rockefeller Foundation is
endeavoring to raise for the increase of professors' salaries, the alumni
clubs of San Francisco and other centers are making a final drive for
success, according to word received at the President's Office on the
campus.
The movement was started by the agreement of the Rockefeller Foun
dation to contribute $300,000 if the University would itself raise $700,-
000. Of the required $700,000 there remains $16,000 to he secured, and
the final date of the Rockefeller Foundation's agreement is May 1. What
ever amount has not been collected by that time will be lost.
The raising of Stanfords' "First Million" was primarily an alumni
undertaking, but University officials point out that a considerable propor
tion of the sum already contributed has come through gifts from others
than alumni and gifts from such interested friends will be particularly
valuable at this time, since every dollar contributed will add $1.43 to the
University's permanent resources and every dollar not raised involves an
equivalent loss. If the whole remaining $16,000 is gained it will increase
the Stanford endowment to the extent of $23,000.
Stanford has collected every pledge that it could, it is announced, and
the only possibility of completing the total fund lies in new gifts within
the next five days.—Palo Alto Times.
