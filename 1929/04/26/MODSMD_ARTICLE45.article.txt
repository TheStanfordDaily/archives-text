LONDON, April 25. (/P) —Motion pic
tures that can be seen on a screen
standing in full daylight, and that
even more clear when the screen is in
sunlight, have been achieved by Mar
tin Harper, an expert in motion pic
ture machinery.
The colors in the screen are the
secrets of success. To the eye, when
no picture is projected, this screen ap
pears a dull black. Mr. Harper says
that while "visually black," it is' not
so actually, but is made by mixing
three colors.
If black is the color from the mo
tion picture film, the mixed color
screen remains black, but if the color
is a lighter shade the colors of the
screen combine to reflect that shade.
The laat letter written by Charles
Dickens was sold for $2400 at Sothe
by's, London.
