BIGADOS, Turkey, April 25 (>P). —
Despite the old Koranic taboo, the new
Turkey is becoming more and more prone
to look on the wine when it is red or
any other color, and, more than that, to
brew her own.
The Kemalist government, which has
made alcohol one of the sixteen state
monopolies, has sent the director of the
monopoly to Europe to study wine mak
ing. The director chose this rich Ana
tolian grape region as the location for
Turkey's future wine industry.
The steep ascent to Montmartre,
Paris art quarter, may be eased. A
proposal is abroad to install an esca
lator.

Twenty bears were captured re
cently on a runch in Presidio County,
Texas.
