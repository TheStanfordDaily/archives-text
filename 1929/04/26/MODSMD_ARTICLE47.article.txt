A FITTING LEADER
A great athlete takes his place among
the captains of Stanford track teams.
Eric Krenz is chosen to succeed Ross
Nichols, and will lead the 1930 varsity.
A world's champion in one event—the
discus, and a powerful contender in an
other—the shot put, the giant Stanford
star is a fitting nominee to the Cardinal
hall of fame.
Krenz holds the present 1.C.4-A. cham
pionships in both shot and discus; Big
Meet, conference, intercollegiate, nation
al, and world's records in the discus, and
an N.C.A.A. title thrown in. Today he
stands supreme in his field, an almost cer
tain winner in the 1929 1.C.4-A. meet at
Boston.
Last Saturday, when he threw
the discus over 156 feet to set a
new Stanford-California record,
he stepped among the great Stan
ford leaders. These great ones
are many; those of the modern
era begin with Morris Kirksey,
varsity track captain in 1922, the
year that California and Stan
ford fought out the Big Meet to
a tie. Today Kirksey,
with Campbell and Dyer of Stan
ford, holds the Card-Bear rec
ord for the 220 dash at 21.8 sec
onds.
Lane Falk, first of Stanford's famed
hurdlers, ran both barrier races in the
1923 Big Meets to new records; his
time in the low hurdles has never been
equaled in Big Meet competition. In
1924 Captain Nelson Van Judah, stellar
quarter-miler and relay man, led his team
to an 83-46 victory over the Golden
Bears.
The following year, Bill Rich
ardson led the attack on national
records—an attack which has not
yet ceased — when he raced
through the half mile in 1:58.8
to set a new Big Meet and na
tional intercollegiate mark. Run
ning in the Big Meet relay, he
beat out his arch-rival, Boyden,
to give Stanford a two-point vic
tory. The summer before, he
won a place on the American
Olympic Games team.
Larry Babcock, who with Richardson,
Storie, and Miller holds the existing
California-Stanford relay record, was
elected captain for 1926. That rccord,
3:19, has remained unapproachable.
He was succeeded by Captain Bud
Spencer, Stanford's most famous 440
man. Developing into a mediocre fresh
man hurdler, he was injured in an auto
mobile wreck after the Little Big Meet.
The following year he appeared again on
the. Stanford oval, this time as a quarter
miler. In race after race, his lanky legs
carried him to victory, and, as anchor
man, he was an integral member of the
relay quartet.
In 1928 Spencer set the exist
ing Big Meet record of 48 sec
onds; the same year he placed
second in the 1.C.4-A.'s. And in
the Olympic trials at Stanford,
he captured the world record for
400 meters. He was defeated in
later trials for the Olympic quar
ter mile, but as a member of the
relay team he ran to an Ameri
can victory. This, from a mid
dle-class hurdler.
With two more meets left on the
schedule, the present varsity has already
won national recognition. Leading it has
been Captain Ross Nichols, hurdler par
excellcnce, who has followed well in the
footsteps of his two sensational prede
cessors—Falk and Swede Leistncr. He
holds the present Big Meet record, and
is 1.C.4-A. champion.
And now comes Krenz, al
ready a champion—and the first
weight star to hold the captaincy
in many years. He follows a
score of great athletes. Can he
better their fame?
