# Quarantine To Prevent Spread Of Florida Fly
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 25 (/P).
â€”Regulations for a federal quarantine
restricting the movement of fruits and
certain vegetables to prevent the spread
of the Mediterranean fruit fly will be
promulgated by the Department of Agri
culture just as soon as they can be draft
ed into proper form.

Dr. C. L. Marlatt, chief of the De
partment's plant quarantine and control
administration bureau, said today that re
ports of a widespread quarantine over the
entire South were entirely unfounded
and that no restrictive measures would
be imposed except in Florida.
The spread of the fly was regarded in
government circles as the gravest threat
to agriculture the South has had. Prac
tically every fruit and vegetable grown
in the cotton states is subject to the fly,
including cotton itself.
