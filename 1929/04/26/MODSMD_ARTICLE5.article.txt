# "REVENGEFUL" BRIDGE TEA GIVEN TOMORROW BY THETA SIGMA PHI
## 
### 
For all those —and there are lots of
'em —who escaped their doughnut sale
last quarter, Theta Sigma Phi has
planned a revengeful bridge-tea which
will break upon an innocent campus
tomorrow afternoon.

Two hundred folding tables have
had their amazing leg-construction
solved —at the expense of nine bruised
thumbs —and are waiting patiently for
the influx of the local bridge fiend and
his ilk. A slight fee —namely two dol
lars per table or four-bits the indi
vidual —will be levied to overcome
miscellaneous charges for transporta
tion, refreshments, lost cards carried
away in coat cuffs (Adelbert, do wo
men carry coat cuffs?), and bribery
to the dean of men's office.
The Theta Sigs, as they so unas
sumingly term themselves, have sum
moned the services of Kathleen Nor
lis, renowned author, who under the
mock title of guest of honor, will be
forced to tell the journalistic ladies
how to write —write news stories,
confessions, or daily weather
reports.
It is expected that many men, worn
to bitter exhaustion after the throes
cf rushing, will drop into the Women's
Clubhouse during the afternoon for
respite—whereupon they will got pick
ed for the great indoor sport of bridge.
The Theta Sigs, in a moment of con
scientious weakness, have promised
to turn all excess profits into their
dilapidated scholarship fund.
CHAMPAIGN-URBANA, 111., April
25.—The unveiling of a live model, whose
identity is being concealed, will conclude
a dancc to be given by the Skctch Club
I of the University of Illinois.
