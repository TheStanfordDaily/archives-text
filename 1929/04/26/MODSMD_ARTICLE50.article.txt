AT THE THEATRES
ALCAZAR —The Big Pond, featur- |
ing Robert McWade as a grouchy, !
American Butter-and-Egg man abroad. \
He rates foreigners. Fair.
COLUMBIA — Broadway Melody.
Talkie.
CURRAN—House of Women with
Nance O'Neil is in its last two weeks.
The acting is excellent, but the play
is a rather dull dramatization of Louis
Bromfield's novel, "The Green Bay
Tree."

1 GEARY —The Front Page. We've
praised this enough already. If you
miss it it's your own fault.
GREEN STREET—Easy for Zee
Zee. ("Zee Zee" does not mean "gin
ger snaps.")
| PRESIDENT —The Maniac is an en
joyable mystery play—meaning that
you will be able to sleep after seeing
it. Also, that old veteran Edmund
lireese is a capable actor. The play is
funny, too.
—Clifford F. Weigle.
