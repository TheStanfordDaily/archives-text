It is understood that some fraternity
men invaded Encina Hall Wednesday
night.
$$ $ $
This must not go on.
$$ $ $
We hear that the lawyer will be dis
pensed with, and the various fraternity
men will do all the swearing.
$$ $ $
To save trouble to the few fresh
men that are left, fhe Interfraternity
Council will visit the rooms and de
termine preferences.
$$ $ $
Freshmen need not leave the room.
$$ $ $
In fact, they had better not.
$$ $ $
Ceremonies, a band concert, and a short
rally will follow.
$$ $ $
We learn that freshmen, instead of
being taken out of the Hall in Rush
ing, are being taken in.
$$ $ $
Conceive the embarrasment of a cer
tain fraternity that pledged a man three
times in one night only to discover he
was one of the custodians.
$$ $ $
Freshman pledges will be given a
short season in the janitors' quarters
to accustom them to their new sur
roundings.
$$ $ $
They will train on Encina meals in
order to prepare for the post-rushing let
down on the Row.
$$ $ $
The lads that lived on bread and
water in a San Mateo jail not so
long ago will, of course, have a dis
tinct advantage.

The Houses call seductively
(Forgive our raucous laughter) ;
The Freshmen fall, the Row takes all,
But —oh ! —the morning after !
At a late hour last night, the editor
of this department was awakened
from his high but humble cot by the j
gnashing of teeth. A silence, then the!
sound was renewed. "Another gnash," j
we murmured, springing into action.
Swinging open the door, we saw i
what used to be an unusual, not to I
say an unprecedented sight. Upon and j
down the corridor of Encina Hall j
strode fraternity men —back and forth j
—back and forth. They all held yellow >
circulars in their hands.
"We are lost," they murmured. "All I
our pledges have deserted us."
"Tut tut," we said, patting the near
est one violently. "And why have they
deserted you?"
"Oh, just because of this ol' hand
bill," one lad, with a Grecian profile

answered. On it was written: "Fresh
men —Look Before You Leap!"
"Cheer up," we said. "You can
pledge some more this afternoon. To
day is Pledging Day, you know."
"Gosh, that's right," they cried. "We
nearly forgot."
