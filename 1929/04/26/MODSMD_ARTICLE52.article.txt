# STARS STILL GROW SO HARVARD FINDS

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 25 (IP).â€”
A little thing that went unnoticed for
several years in photographs of the spec
tra of stars is the source of a discovery
that many stars seem to be growing. It
is explained in a Harvard observatory
circular by Dr. Harlow Shapley, director.
Certain dark lines across these pictures,
which show the presence of iron and
magnesium in the stars, are very preva
lent among the hotter suns. Iron and
magnesium are two of the elements com
mon in meteors. Special methods of anal
ysis applied to these lines led the Har
vard astronomers to conclude that they
come from meteors falling upon the stars.
In that part of the heavens where
stars are most numerous, there are dark
spaces called dark nebulae, attributed to
masses of meteors and meteoric particles.
The bands on the photographs are heavi
est in those regions of the sky where
these dark clouds are thickest.
"The bands are the first direct evidence
we have had," Dr. Shipley says, "of the
existence of enormous quantities of sec
ondary bodies around stars. It seems
likely that a part of the mass lost by a
star through its radiation is replaced by
the meteors falling upon it.
"We appear to have found an indica
tion that the meteoric matter of the dark
nebulae, and of space in general, can be
observed spectroscopically as it replen
ishes the stars.
"In stars in the dark nebular clouds,
or even in lighter nebulosity such as the
Pleiades, the radiation degradation of a
star's energy may be much retarded, or
balanced, or possibly even reversed."
