# Levees Are Endangered As Heavy Rains Flood Stream

### 
QITINCY, Illinois, April 25. (/P)â€”All
of the levees protecting nearby drain
age districts were endangered today
as additional heavy rains forged the
Mississippi's tributaries and started a
rise in the parent stream which was
expected to exceed all records.
Hundreds of families fled to higher
ground after the weather observatory
at Hannibal, Mo., announced "the
Mississippi at Quincy will reach from
22 to 22.4 feet by Friday."
There are 14,000 acres in the Lima
Lake tract and 16,000 in the Hunt
area, with approximately 200 families
living there. If the dike breaks in one
of these districts, both will be flooded
and probable damage will result.
