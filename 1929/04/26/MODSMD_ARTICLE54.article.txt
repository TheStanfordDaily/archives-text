### 
GENEVA, April 25 (#>).â€”'The Ameri
can delegation to tlie Preparatory Com
mission for a Disarmament Conference
has decided against immediate delivery to
Great Britain, France, Italy, and Japan
of the memorandum now being prepared
to explain the technical purport of the
American formula of equivalent tonnage.
Another development of naval matters
was the distinct drift of both British and
American delegations to the belief that
the proposed naval conference had better
l>e merged with the second Washington
naval parley due in 1931. By this ar
rangement the five great naval powers
could mould a treaty for reduction in
cruisers, destroyers, and submarines
while re-examining the requirements of
modification of the Washington treaty in
battleships and aircraft carriers in the
light of scientific development.
