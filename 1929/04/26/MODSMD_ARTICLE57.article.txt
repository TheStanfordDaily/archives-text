# SPORTS OF 1929
## A 						Super Athlete 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Pennsylvania, once mighty in track ath
letics, slipped badly for several years, and
now appears to be on the way back to
greater glories. One reason for this ren
aissance in running, jumping, and weight
throwing is Barney Berlinger, one of
the most remarkable all-around athletes
since the days of Jim Thorpe. This new
Red and Blue hero can do almost any
event on the program, and do it well, j
and, what is more important, he is skilled*-
enough to enter four competitions in a
big meet like the indoor 1.C.4-A. and
place in all of them.
"Burly" Barney is only twenty-one, and ;
stands six feet one inch and tips the j
scales at 197. Can you imagine a guy that
heavy pole-vaulting thirteen feet 4-}$
inches or high-jumping six feet
You'd think he would be a shot-putter.
Well, he is, and a javelin and discus
thrower too, and, besides that, he throws
the hammer a bit. "Is there anything this
big bozo can't do?" you ask. Well, Bar
ney writes me, "Two things I hate to do
—run the mile and study."

Stewart, another United States Olympic
Decathlon contender, seems to be able to
do at Southern California. In the indoor
Eastern Intercollegiate meet, Barney
scored 9j4 points, placing second in the
pole-vault, fourth in the shot-put, tying
for third in the broad-jump, and tying
for fourth in the high-jump. Then two
| weeks later he won the all-around cham
' pionship at the University of Illinois re
lay carnival, setting a new record of 6,070
points for the grueling seven-event test.
