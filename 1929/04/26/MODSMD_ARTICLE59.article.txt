# BOMBSHELL CIRCULAR URGING FRESHMEN TO RECONSIDER BEFORE PLEDGING DISTRIBUTED
## 
### 
A Ijombshell was thrown into the fra
! ternity rushing situation on the cam
pus last night with the widespread dis
i ti ibution of a circular in Encina Hall,
urging all freshmen to reconsider be
fore pledging. The pamphlets were
first found in Encina at 5:45 o'clock
ic the afternoon and several copies
had reached the Row by supper-time.
The circular read:
FRESHMEN!
Look Before You Leap!
" You are being stampeded.
The rushing season iB an elaborate
Camouflage. Every honest fraternity
man admits it.
Stanford is a democratic institu
tion.
Sure, the liow has advantages—so
has the Hall.
The independent man stays inde
pendent. Only a stenographer takes
dictation.
Don't fall for the Pin, the Pledge,
the Letters, or the Ceremony—it's all
hooey.
Happiness is not concentrated on
the Row.
If you join, join with your eyes
open. Pick your house, don't take any
thing just to be one of the boys.
Judge a house by its men.
Is it YOU they want —or the Car,
your Crest, or your Coin?
Would you rather have 30 friends
or 3,000?
Don't judge 'i 1« me by th<j earn in
front —some may not be paid for.
Don't join on the food —it'll never
be the same again.

The Hall wants men who will stand
on their own feet. Slickers and snobs
take the brass —the Halls will be glad
to see you go.
Illegal rushing has its morning
after.
Stanford holds no brief for the Small
Town Hero.
Hoover chose the Hall.
Back slapping now, but Paddling
later.
Freshmen, don't make a mistake
which will mar your lives. Rational
ize. Don't be coaxed by a hoax. Make
your own decision.
IT'S UP TO YOU!
