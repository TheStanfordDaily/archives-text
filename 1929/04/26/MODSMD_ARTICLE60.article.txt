NEW YORK, April 25 (/P). â€” The
American Petroleum Institute today was I
in agreement with the Federal Oil Con-j
servation Board in its plan for an inter- !
state compact to halt overproduction.
The directors after a four-hour session
unanimously agreed to co-opcrate with
the federal board in the study of its pro
gram and meanwhile hold in abeyance
their own plan of limiting 1929 produc
tion to the 1928 level.
General Lazaro Cardenas, federal
commander in southern Sonora, in- 1
formed the government today that the
rebel army retreated from Masiaca
Mist night and that federal troops
were able to enter the town today
without resistance.
