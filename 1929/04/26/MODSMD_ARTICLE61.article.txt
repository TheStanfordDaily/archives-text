# SPRING CLASSIC OF LOCAL DIAMONDS FINDS FORCES OF BRAIN, BRAWN READY
## Printers, Reporters, Out for Victory in Tilt of Century; Both Teams Have All-Star Line-ups for Sunday's Game 
### BY FAKE DELIVERY 
JIORDES and multitudes, representing the cream of all the fans of the
" land, are heading for the Varsity baseball diamond, scene of the battle
of the century, when the Press and Daily clash in deadly combat at 10 o'clock
Sunday morning.
The inkslingers are out to avenge last year's defeat of 15 to 4, but in spite
of much encouragement and very light practice, the Daily is pretty much
fagged out. The Press are determined to cut another notch in their linotypes
and have been putting in a month of strenuous practice. At present the

Press seems to have the edge. <
Even the managers of the local ag
gregation admit that their team is not
scouting, the name of this prodigy
was discovered, and his photograph
was taken. The Daily star appears to
be a certain Angus McWurp, fresh
man. When interviewed, McWurp gave
out a great deal of hot dope on his
team. "Yes," he said, "the boys are
all on edge, and with me pitching,

80 good. but. it is be
lioved that they have
some stellar player
that they are keep
ing under cover un
til the game starts.
After a great deal of

the Press hasn't a ghost of a chance."
McWurp will be held as a relief
twirler, and may not even get in the
ruckus. The starting lineup of the
Daily outfit is Oswill c, Ricklefs p,
Frank lb, O'Meara 2b, Wright 3b, Mc-
Garr ss, Reeder If, Moore cf, and
Terwilliger rf.

Merle
Emr y ,
mascot of
the Daily,
i a frankly
open in his
adoration of
hi s team,
spend i n g
hours In
i the Office
sitting on
the files and

listening to
the baseball talk. Templeton Peck and
Frank Baker, past editors, drop in
now and then (mainly then) and
reminisce on the old days when they
proudly strutted their stuff.
The Press has a sure-fire gang who
act like a bunch of big-timers. Uriell,

veteran of throe years, will lead off
and play first base. Captain Ernie
Hipp or Schmidt will hold down the
keystone sack. The rest of the team
is Wilholmy If, Hamlet ss, Borro c,
G. Whitten cf, C. Whitten rf, Warren
:>b, and Mayrhofer p. The back-room
boys also boast of one "Pa" Furbush,
general utility and pinch-hitter extra
ordinary.
The typesetters have been practic
ing up in the Corporation Yard on
various ways of rattling the Daily
pitching staff. The boys have been

trying all sorts of sound effects and
have even tried to get out the fresh
man class at night to see the moon.
The feminine members of the Daily
staff are optimistic and say they will

be out in
force on Sun
day morning [
ta give the
boys a thrill. 1
The owner of
the newspa
per gang is
quite reticent ;
on the out
come of the
game. "I re-

fuse to make a statement," was his
remark.

The Press hoys, feeling confident in
the ability of their team, have offered
odds as to the outcome being in their !
favor, but the inkslingers, though
claiming to havo the better outfit, fail
io (jike up the big odds offered by
Jtaoir opponents.
