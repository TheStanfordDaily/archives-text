Intramural Title
In the battle for the intramural title,
El Toro, winner of last year's all-Uni

meet, the club outfit has piled up a
total of 100 points, and now leads its
closest rival by a comfortable 14%-
point margin.
The mural leaders got off to a flying
start last fall, when they captured
the cross country event. This was
followed up with a win in the track
meet over Breakers, and the two first
places netted them 50 tallies. Break
ers kept right on El Toro's heels, how

The winter schedule was closely
contested by the various living groups.
