# "NEVER GIVE UP" IS MOTTO OF DOUGHTY CARD DISTANCE MAN
## Alex McKinnon Has Enviable Track Record in Mile, 880-Yard Events 
### LEONARD BARTLETT 
A speedy miler who trains on quar
ters —four or five of them a day—is
Alex McKinnon, the swift-footed young
gentleman who helped to pull the
Cardinal bacon out of the Southern
California fire, and who staged a
great comeback against Harry Carter,
his Nemesis across the bay, in the
mile race last Saturday.
McKinnon's three years of Temple
ton coaching and collegiate competi
tion have taught him many lessons in
the game. "Never give up" is a spirit
which Alex McKinnon always carries
with him.
When he was a soph McKinnon was
Ihe only Stanford athlete to place in
the distance runs at Philadelphia in
the 1.C.4-A. meet. He took fourth
place. His time for the mile was ap
proximately 4 m. 24 s.
During the 1928 season McKinnon's
best time in the mile was against the
University of Southern California
squad when he circled the oval in
4 m. 26 s. He placed third in the Big
Meet last year.
Alex's sensational victories against
U.S.C. in both the mile and 880 will
be remembered as bright spots of the
1929 season. He took the mile iu 4 m.
33 s., and won the half in 2 m. 3-5 s.
McKinnon also captured the half mile
race against the Southern California
All-Stars. His time was 1 m. 59 s.
One of the traditions of the University
of Illinois is a spring series of twilight
band concerts given by the Illiui band
out of doors.
