# CARD NETMEN SCORE NINE ONE-SIDED WINS DURING 1929 SEASON
## Eligibility of Doeg, Weesner, Makes Stanford Team Best in America 
### 
One-sided victories in nine matches
and the championship of the Southern
Division of the Pacific Coast Confer
ence in both the singles and doubles
is the record of Stanford's varsity
tennis team to date.
Despite the fact that John Doeg and
Chuck Weesner, first and second rank
ing players, were ineligible until the
beginning of the spring quarter, the
Cardinal racquet wielders, led by Cap
tain Wheatley, completed a tour of
Southern California, during which
they defeated seven of the strongest
college and club teams in that sectiou
of the state.
With Doeg and Weesner back in the
lineup, the Stanford players had an
easy time winning the Pacific Coast
Conference Southern Division Cham
pionships at Berkeley, Doeg capturing
the singles title by defeating Weesner
in the finals and taking the doubles
championship with Wheatley as a
teammate. Last Saturday the same
team defeated the Californians again
by a 5 to 0 shutout.

The only defeat that the Cardinal
tennis team has suffered was in an
early-season meet at the hands of the
Occidental players, the latter winning
two of the three matches. The sting
of this defeat was removed, however,
during the southern tour when the
Stanford net stars won over Occi
dental by a 4 to 2 score.
