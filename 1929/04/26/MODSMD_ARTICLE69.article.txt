# CARDS PREPARE FOR TOUGH GRID SEASON IN '29
## Indications Point Toward Winning Football Year; "Pop" Warner Optimistic All Major Contests Except That With Washington to Be Played in Local Bowl 
### 
With spring football practice in full
swing, now that the other intercollegiate
sports seasons are practically over, Pop
Warner and the followers of the Stan
ford Red are turning their attention to
the 1929 season.
Though Pop maintains his usual pes
simism concerning prospects for the com
ing season, more optimistic indications
point to what should be Stanford's great
est season. The schedule is a formidable
one and all the big games are to be
played in the local Stadium, which adds
extraordinary attraction to this fall's con
tests.
A number of lettermen will be lost
from last year's team, but in most cases
the vacancies on the squad can be fdled
without much difficulty. The exceptions,
of course, are the guard positions left
vacant by the graduation of "Dynamite"
Post and Don Robesky, the Cardinal's
contribution to the Ail-American list
during 1928. Pete Heiser and Hull Dris
coll are the two leading candidates for
these positions, with Hamilton, Forster,
Wilson, Hulen, and Dawson following
close behind them on the list.
Walt Heinecke will play center and
will possibly have Perry Taylor as first
substitute choice. Artman will be back
at tackle, but Tiny Sellman's position at
the opposite end of the line will have to
be filled. Ray Tandy is the logical man
for this berth.
A number of good ends and backfield
men will be on hand. The combination
which worked the passing plays so well
last year, Simkins and Frentrup, will be
outstanding players among the backs.
Captain Mush Muller, Joe Bush, Hodge
Davidson, and Kay Albertson will take
care of the end position. Harlow Rothert
will possibly play half this year instead
of fullback and can be expected to do
the team's punting.
The season's three greatest attractions,
the Big Game with California, the con
test with Southern California's Thunder
ing Herd, and with the West Point Ca
dets will all be home games and will
prove an advantage to the Cards on that
account.
