# MONACO VOTERS ASK FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO CONTROL CASINO
## 
### 
NICE, France, April 25 (/P).' —Predic-
tions have been numerous along the Ri
viera that unless the June 1 election of
Monte Carlo goes to the liking of the
discontented elements there the princi
pality of Monaco will, within six months,
ask France to take over administration of
the tiny realm.
The trouble is between the 700 voters
of the country and the management of
the Monte Carlo casino. The citizens
claim that they are being governed in the
interest of a gambling ring instead of by
the constitution.
Newspapers along the French Riviera
have given considerable space to the sit
uation and have been quoting history to
prove that Prince Louis' little state is
really a "fief" of France.
The value of the principality can be
measured in dollars, of which there are
hundreds of millions invested within its
narrow bounds. But there is also a small
harbor of forty-two acres extent, land
locked and with a depth of 90 feet at the
entrance and 24 feet at the quay side.
