# SPIRITUAL VALUE OF WAR IS HIGH SAYS CHICAGO PROFESSOR
## "Defense Only Welds Unity" Declares C. H. Mead in Stanford Lecture 
### 
"The spiritual values of war," said
Professor George Herbert Mead of the
University of Chicago in his lecture on
"National-mindedness and International
mindedness" yesterday afternoon, "are a
hardiness of body and mind, an ability
to pay all for one supreme good, a rising
above self in the subordination of minor
interests to major, and a sense of oneness
with the others in the community. The
most important of these is the last.
"The only effective feeling of unity
springs from a response to a common
enemy. It took hatred of foreigners to
unify the Chinese; Mussolini is uniting
Italy by arousing the Italian soul through
threat of war; the Solid South is the
result of a common hostility; the clan
spirit is as strong as it is only because of
the fighting impulse; and labor unions
have their force only through the occa
sional fighting they do. There is no other
primal instinct so strong as this one of
battle, and no other which serves to unify
as it does. The impulse of helpfulness is
immediately subordinated to that of fight
ing. In peace times, we are all ready to
consider our neighbors potential enemies.
We are wary of those with whom we
would fight whole-heartedly for a com
mon cause. The sex impulse isolates in
dividuals, and family life segregates
them. But men are quickly and solidly
fused in common devotion to the father
land and defense from a common enemy.
"Henry James has suggested in his es
say "The Moral Equivalent of War" that
the youth of the country be conscripted
for useful labor, in the performing of
which they will be highly conscious that
their labor is necessary to the community.
This substitution of a cult of youth-labor
for war to unite the nation is only an il
lustration, not a practical program. Af
ter all, a cult cannot be legislated into
existence.
