# DAN C. C. M'COWAN TO LECTURE SUNDAY ON "LIFE OF JESUS"
## 
### 
"Major Factors in the Life and
! Teachings of Jesus" will be the topic
j of the second of a series of four lec
! tures by Dean C. C. McGowan of the
| Pacific School of Religion, to be given
Sunday evening at 7:30 in the lobby
i of the Old Union. The series is spon
sored by the Y.M.C.A. and the Me
j mortal Church.
So much has been said and so little
understood about the actual man,
Jesus, probably one of the most sig
| nificant figures of history, that it is
j especially fortunate that so prominent
: and liberal a scholar as Dr. McGowan
j can be secured to lecture on the sub
! ject, Ben Culver, Y.M.C.A. secretary,
| said today.
In his address last Sunday Dr. Mc
, Gowan presented the first four books
|of the New Testament, showing a
j way out for those who stumbled over
j contradiction and discrepancy exist
j ing in the Bible. He pointed out that
1 an understanding of the structure of
j those books clear up the difficulties,
and that only those who hold to a
i literal interpretation run into misun
derstanding.
