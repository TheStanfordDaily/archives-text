# GOVERNMENTS AGREE TO GIVE RUM RUNNER DISPUTE TO ARBITERS
## "I'm Alone" Sinking Case to Be Placed Before Two Chosen Judges 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., April 25 (JF).
- The United States and Canada have
agreed to arbitrate the dispute over the
sinking of the Canadian rum runner "I'm
Alon>Â»" by the American Coast Guard.
This decision was disclosed tonight by
die diplomatic correspondence on the "I'm
Alone" case, which was made public by
Secretary Stimson.
The case will be submitted to two ar
biters, one selected by each government,
under the terms of the liquor smuggling
treaty between the United States and
Great Britain. They will decide whether
Canada is entitled to redress.
Canada made formal representations to
the United States on April 9 concerning
the sinking of the "I'm Alone" off the
Louisiana coast on March 22 by the Coast
Guard patrol boat Dexter.
Accepting the American suggestion of
arbitration, Canada's reply expressed re
gret of "inability to concur in certain im
portant aspects" of the American presen
tation. Discrepancies as to the position
of the "I'm Alone" and the speed of the
vessel were said by the note to "appear
capable of solution only by an examina
tion of all tiie evidence by an impartial
tribunal:"
