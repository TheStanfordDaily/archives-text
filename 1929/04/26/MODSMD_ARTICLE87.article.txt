## 
### 
DUBLIN" (/p) — I The Free State is by
act of parliament reducing the num
ber of its drink shops.

The police decide which houses are
redundant and submit their findings
to the district justices. The state ad
vances the money to compensate the
dispossessed drink sellers and recover
the sum from those who are left on
the theory that they must benefit by
the restriction of competition. Three
hundred saloons were thus extinguish
ed in the first year.
When the act of parliament was
passed there was in the Free State
one drink shop for every 230 of the
population as against one for every
650 in Scotland. Today, despite the re
duction, there is still one drink shop
for every 220, a higher proportion than
when the reform began. The explana
tion is that the census has revealed a
smaller population than was esti
mated.
