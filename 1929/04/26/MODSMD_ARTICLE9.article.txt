# CARD TRACK IN LEAVING TODAY FOR FRESNO
## Stiff Competition Is Expected In West Coast Relay Meet Tomorrow 
### Frank Whiteley 
The twenty Cardinal track and field
men who are leaving today for Fresno to
take part in the annual West Coast Re
lays tomorrow are in for some stiff com
petition, if the entry list is any indication.
California, U.S.C., the Olympic Club; and
the Los Angeles Athletic Club, as well
as Stanford, are entering teams; and this
means that the best athletes in the West
will be seen in action.
There will be many close battles for
the points both in the field and on the
track. The 100-yard dash will bring to
gether Captain Charlie Borah of U.S.C.,
Hec Dyer of Stanford, Frank Wykoff,
Russell Sweet of the Olympic Club, and
Frank Lombardi. First place will be a
toss-up between these five.
Rothert, Brix in Shot
A great three-cornered fight is sched
uled in the shot put when Captain-elect
Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert, Tem
pleton's "old faithfuls," meet Herman
Brix, Washington star and second place
winner in the 1928 Olympic Games. All
three can do better than 50 feet, and
Brix and Rothert have exceeded 51 feet.
The three were teammates on the Olym
pic team.
Ward Edmonds of the Cards and Jack
Williams of U.S.C. will provide an in
teresting duel in the pole vault, and it is
possible that the world's record of 14 ft.
1 in. may be bettered. Williams defeated
Edmonds in the recent Stanford-U.S.C.
meet, vaulting 13 ft. 10 in., a height
which the Card could not get over after
running the two hurdles races.
Krenz, of course, is favored in the
discus, and he will undoubtedly try to
break his own world's record of 163 ft.
in.
Cards Enter Relays
As its name implies, the Fresno meet
is principally a relay meet. Stanford will
enter teams in all four relays—quarter
mile, half-mile, mile, and two-mile. All
of the Card teams are strong, and a vic
tory in at least two of the relays is likely.
The mile team of Shove, Syer, McKin
non, and Morrison has not been defeated
so far this year. The Stanford 880-yard
relay team of Dyer, Lauritzen, McDer- j
mott, and Morrison will also make a |
strong bid for a first place. The other |
two Cardinal teams in the quarter-mile j
and two-mile relays will be very much |
in the running and will have to be taken j
into account before any pre-meet doping
is done. Dyer, Lauritzen, McDermott, j
and Syer make up the single lap team; I
and McKinnon, Neikirk, French, and |
Parker are the members of the two-mile j
team.
A1 Pogolotti, California hurdler who J
has been on the injured list most of the j
year, is getting into shape rapidly and
should press Captain Ross Nichols and
Rogers Smith in the high hurdles.
Javelin to Be Feature
The javelin will come close to being
the feature event of the day. Kibby and
Sparling of Stanford, Churchill and Cur- j
tice of California, and Mortenson of I
U.S.C. have all done better than 200 feet J
in competition this year. Churchill, be- j
cause of his 209-foot throw against Stan- l
ford, is favored. Perelli-Minetti, Stan- J
ford's promising sophomore, tossed the
spear more than 198 feet against Califor
nia and wasn't able to place.
The other members of the Stanford
team are Dowell and Anderson, broad
jump; Hulsman, pole vault; and Madison
and French, high jump. Dowell, if he
leaps 24 feet or better again this week, is
almost certain of a first place.
An unattached team of four Card
freshmen — Giberson, Hables, Elwood, i
and Lombardi —will enter the quarter- !
mile and half-mile relays.

nia and wasn't able to place.
The other members of the Stanford
team are Dowell and Anderson, broad
jump; Hulsman, pole vault; and Madison
and French, high jump. Dowell, if he
leaps 24 feet or better again this week, is
almost certain of a first place.
An unattached team of four Card
freshmen — Giberson, Hables, Elwood, i
and Lombardi —will enter the quarter- !
mile and half-mile relays.
The twenty Cardinal track and field
men who are leaving today for Fresno to
take part in the annual West Coast Re
lays tomorrow are in for some stiff com
petition, if the entry list is any indication.
California, U.S.C., the Olympic Club; and
the Los Angeles Athletic Club, as well
as Stanford, are entering teams; and this
means that the best athletes in the West
will be seen in action.
There will be many close battles for
the points both in the field and on the
track. The 100-yard dash will bring to
gether Captain Charlie Borah of U.S.C.,
Hec Dyer of Stanford, Frank Wykoff,
Russell Sweet of the Olympic Club, and
Frank Lombardi. First place will be a
toss-up between these five.
Rothert, Brix in Shot
A great three-cornered fight is sched
uled in the shot put when Captain-elect
Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert, Tem
pleton's "old faithfuls," meet Herman
Brix, Washington star and second place
winner in the 1928 Olympic Games. All
three can do better than 50 feet, and
Brix and Rothert have exceeded 51 feet.
The three were teammates on the Olym
pic team.
Ward Edmonds of the Cards and Jack
Williams of U.S.C. will provide an in
teresting duel in the pole vault, and it is
possible that the world's record of 14 ft.
1 in. may be bettered. Williams defeated
Edmonds in the recent Stanford-U.S.C.
meet, vaulting 13 ft. 10 in., a height
which the Card could not get over after
running the two hurdles races.
Krenz, of course, is favored in the
discus, and he will undoubtedly try to
break his own world's record of 163 ft.
in.
Cards Enter Relays
As its name implies, the Fresno meet
is principally a relay meet. Stanford will
enter teams in all four relays—quarter
mile, half-mile, mile, and two-mile. All
of the Card teams are strong, and a vic
tory in at least two of the relays is likely.
The mile team of Shove, Syer, McKin
non, and Morrison has not been defeated
so far this year. The Stanford 880-yard
relay team of Dyer, Lauritzen, McDer- j
mott, and Morrison will also make a |
strong bid for a first place. The other |
two Cardinal teams in the quarter-mile j
and two-mile relays will be very much |
in the running and will have to be taken j
into account before any pre-meet doping
is done. Dyer, Lauritzen, McDermott, j
and Syer make up the single lap team; I
and McKinnon, Neikirk, French, and |
Parker are the members of the two-mile j
team.
A1 Pogolotti, California hurdler who J
has been on the injured list most of the j
year, is getting into shape rapidly and
should press Captain Ross Nichols and
Rogers Smith in the high hurdles.
Javelin to Be Feature
The javelin will come close to being
the feature event of the day. Kibby and
Sparling of Stanford, Churchill and Cur- j
tice of California, and Mortenson of I
U.S.C. have all done better than 200 feet J
in competition this year. Churchill, be- j
cause of his 209-foot throw against Stan- l
ford, is favored. Perelli-Minetti, Stan- J
ford's promising sophomore, tossed the
spear more than 198 feet against Califor
nia and wasn't able to place.
The other members of the Stanford
team are Dowell and Anderson, broad
jump; Hulsman, pole vault; and Madison
and French, high jump. Dowell, if he

tice of California, and Mortenson of I
U.S.C. have all done better than 200 feet J
in competition this year. Churchill, be- j
cause of his 209-foot throw against Stan- l
ford, is favored. Perelli-Minetti, Stan- J
ford's promising sophomore, tossed the
spear more than 198 feet against Califor
nia and wasn't able to place.
The other members of the Stanford
team are Dowell and Anderson, broad
jump; Hulsman, pole vault; and Madison
and French, high jump. Dowell, if he
leaps 24 feet or better again this week, is
almost certain of a first place.
An unattached team of four Card
freshmen — Giberson, Hables, Elwood, i
and Lombardi —will enter the quarter- !
mile and half-mile relays.
