WASHINGTON, D.C., April 25 (JP).
â€”Wholesale and constant forgery and
counterfeiting of documents to secure the
admission of aliens into the United States
have been brought to the attention of the
State Department.
The forged documents, against which
the Department is now building a vigi
lance system, include American passports,
passport visas, birth certifications, and
papers to be presented by aliens for per
mission to enter the United States..
Most of the forgery of passports was
said at the State Department to be done
to secure the uninterrupted admission into
the United States of "undesirable aliens"
or prospective immigrants whose turn to
come to the United States under the
quota of their countries will not come for
many years.
