j "Whither mankind?" may perplex crit
ics of flaming youth, but scientists still
' disagree on the origin of man.
Dr. George L. Collie of Beloit College,
conductor of numerous anthropological
! expeditions, contends that the northern
j Sahara desert, now a barren waste, was
the home of the world's first real men.
Opposed to his theory is his student of
twenty-five years ago, Dr. Roy Chapman
J Andrews, who argues that the Gobi des
: ert, in Asia, was the "cradle of hu-
I manity."
| Expeditions headed by both men have
uncovered valuable findings in far cor
i ners of Asia and Africa. Dr. Andrews
! found in Asia bones of the largest mam
i mal yet discovered. In the Sahara Dr.
i Collie unearthed bones of a race of men
j whose existence was hitherto unknown.
