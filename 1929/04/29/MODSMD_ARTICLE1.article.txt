# PREDICT SENATE WILL CHALLENGE ANDREW MELLON
## Right of Secretary to Hold Place Questioned as Farm Relief, Religion Discussed Attorney General Declares Mellon Is Holding Office Within Law; Breaks Rule 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 28. (/P)—The
•challenge of the right of Andrew W.
Mellon to serve as Secretary of the
Treasury promises to join the all-ab
sorbing topics of farm relief and re
ligion before the Senate this week.
A vote is in prospect tomorrow in
the Senate Judiciary Committee on
the report of Chairman Norris declar
ing that Mr. Mellon as a stockholder
in various business enterprises vio
lates an old statute forbidding the
Secretary of the Treasury to be inter
ested in carrying on trade or com
merce. In view of the recent opinion
given by Attorney General Mitchell to
President Hoover declaring that Mr.
Mellon is holding his office within the
law, there is some doubt regarding
what effect, if any, a Senate vote on
the Mellon status will have.
It is agreed that the Senate can do
no more than express its opinion. If
impeachment is resorted to that must
oe initiated in the House. In view of
the Attorney General's opinion there
is some doubt that the District Attor
ney would institute action against the
Secretary for violation of the 100-
year-old statute even if the Senate
held it had been violated.
The question of the right of Mellon
to serve has been talked about the
Capital during the eight years of his
administration but it was brought to
a showdown when Senator McKellar,
[K.'mocrat, Tennessee, introduced a
resolution asking the Judiciary Com
mittee to investigate his relation to
the old statute. Friends of Mellon in
the Senate voiced no objection to the
investigation and the resolution was
adopted.
Mr. Mellon in a letter to Senator
Keed, Republican, Pennsylvania,
which was laid before the committee,
said he owned stock in the Gulf Oil
Corporation, the Aluminum Company
of America, and other business, but
not a controlling interest in any. He
said he had sold all of his National
Hank stock and had resigned any
executive connections with the busi
ness world.
The whole question hinges on
whether a stockholder is "interested
or concerned in carrying on trade or
commerce." Senator Norris says he is.
Attorney General Mitchell says he
isn't.
