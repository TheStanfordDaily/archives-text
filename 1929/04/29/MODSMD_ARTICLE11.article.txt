# M'COWAN SPEAKS ON CHRIST; TELLS LIFE BACKGROUND, PURPOSE

"We cannot expect to be able ever
to write a biography of Jesus," said
Dean C. C. McCowan of the Pacific
School of Religion, in his lecture last
night on "Major Factors in the Life
and Teaching of Jesus." "We have
not a life of Jesus; W4 have merely a
series of pictures of Jesus. And after
all, that is all we need."
Dean McCowan talked on Jesus' so
cial background, his individuality, his
point of view and conception of the
world, and his plan and purpose. He
devoted a great deal of his discussion
to a contrast and distinction between
Biblical society and modern society,
in an attempt to present a clear con
ception of Christ and his work.
A rather startling statement made
by McCowan was that, "It's one of
the scandals of Christianity that we've
forgotten that Jesus was a Jew." He
enlarged upon this point with a dis
cussion of Jesus as a devout and typi
cal, although individual, Jew.
