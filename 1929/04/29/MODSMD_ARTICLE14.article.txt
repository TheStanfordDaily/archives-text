# CONVALESCENT HOI STUDENT DRIVE OPENS OFFICIALLY TODAY
## Campaign Has "Let's Break Another Record" for 1929 Slogan 
### Sylva Weaver 
With an appeal to the spirit of ser
vice in every Stanford man and wo
man, with a "tag day," a poster
covered campus, a benefit theater pro
gram, and an organized canvass of the
University living groups and Palo
Alto, the 1929 Convalescent Home
Drive commences officially this morn
ing. Labor Day, Wednesday, will cul
minate the student campaign.
"Let's break another Stanford rec
ord" is the slogan of the annual
A.S.S.U. campaign for funds to help
maintain Stanford's own charity. Big
Meet and world's records have all
come to Stanford, and it is hoped by
Stanford Steinbeck, who is managing
the Drive, that the student body will
avail itself of the opportunity to break
a record —the record set last year for
funds was $2800.
Steinbeck in Charge
Under the direction of Steinbecl
and Mary Barstow a number of com
mittees have been appointed to carry
on the Drive in the various living
groups. The treasurers in the halls and
the fraternities will report their con
tributions to Jack McDowell and
Betty Clarke on the Row, Irwin War
ner in the halls, and Margaret Mud
gett in Roble.
