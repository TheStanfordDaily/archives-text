## To Be Sold Only to Juniors Until Friday; 30 Dues Dispensed With 
### 
Junior Prom bids will go on sale
this ufternoon, from 1 to 3 o'clock in
the Old Union, and will be sold only
to juniors until Friday when seniors
may buy them. Next week they will
be put on sale for the entire student
body.
Bids are $5.00, and the junior class
dues of $2.00 which in the past have
been paid with the purchase of the
Prom bids, have been dispensed with
this year, so that juniors can ob
tain tickets for the same price as
men in other classes, instead of fo
$7.00. This has been done in order
to make it more definitely a class
dance.
Dean Morrison is general chairman
of the dance. Silhouettes of black and
white will be used as the basis for
the decorations, which are being
managed by Saff Nye. The programs
of black suede with an overlay futu
ristic design of silver will carry out
the silhouette idea.
