# ANNUAL BALL GAME WITH PRESS PROVES FATAL TO DAILY MEN
## Good Pitching Feature in 7-3 Tilt; Mayrhofer Strikes Out Fifteen Men 
### 
Stanford's annual baseball classic of
Press gang versus Daily gang came to
a sad and bitter end for the Daily
outfit yesterday when the boys from
the back room walked off the field
with the long end of a 7-3 score. The
game was played on the varsity dia
mond and it wasn't a bad game as
such games usually go.
Good pitching featured the contest,
Mayrhofer of the Press and Ricklefs
of the Daily both twirling good ball
and being especially effective in the
pinches. Mayrhofer yielded four hits
to the Daily sluggers and struck out
fifteen men while the Press crowd
garnered six hits off Ricklefs and
twelve of them were turned back by
the strikeout route.
Hitting honors of the day went to
Mayrhofer, Press pitcher, and to Os
will, captain and catcher for the Daily.
McGarr made a fluke home run in the
ninth inning when he hit a single and
came all the way home on three suc
cessive bad throws.
For the first seven innings things
looked pretty bad for the pen-pushers
from the Daily. The Press outfit scored
twice in the first, fourth, and sixth
frames on various mixtures of errors
and timely hits. Their last run was
scored in the seventh inning when
Wilhelmy walked, stole second, and
came home on Gene Whitten's hit to
left field.
In the ninth the Daily put on a be
lated rally that garnered three runs
and gave the spectators a few thrills.
Outside of this nothing else was ac
complished for not a hit was made
off Mayrhofer until the seventh inning.
In this inning Oswill hit to deep cen
terfield, McGarr hit a liner that was
too hot for the third baseman to han
dle, and Ricklefs got to first on the
