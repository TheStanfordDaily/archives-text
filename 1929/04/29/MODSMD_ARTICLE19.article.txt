# ANNUAL BALL GAME WITH PRESS PROVES FATAL TO DAILY MEN
## Good Pitching Feature in 7-3 Tilt; Mayrhofer Strikes Out Fifteen Men 
### 
Stanford's annual baseball classic of
Press gang versus Daily gang came to
a sad and bitter end for the Daily
outfit yesterday when the boys from
the back room walked off the field
with the long end of a 7-3 score. The
game was played on the varsity dia
mond and it wasn't a bad game as
such games usually go.
Good pitching featured the contest,
Mayrhofer of the Press and Ricklefs
of the Daily both twirling good ball
and being especially effective in the
pinches. Mayrhofer yielded four hits
to the Daily sluggers and struck out
fifteen men while the Press crowd
garnered six hits off Ricklefs and
twelve of them were turned back by
the strikeout route.
Hitting honors of the day went to
Mayrhofer, Press pitcher, and to Os
will, captain and catcher for the Daily.
McGarr made a fluke home run in the
ninth inning when he hit a single and
came all the way home on three suc
cessive bad throws.
For the first seven innings things
looked pretty bad for the pen-pushers
from the Daily. The Press outfit scored
twice in the first, fourth, and sixth
frames on various mixtures of errors
and timely hits. Their last run was
scored in the seventh inning when
Wilhelmy walked, stole second, and
came home on Gene Whitten's hit to
left field.
In the ninth the Daily put on a be
lated rally that garnered three runs
and gave the spectators a few thrills.
Outside of this nothing else was ac
complished for not a hit was made
off Mayrhofer until the seventh inning.
In this inning Oswill hit to deep cen
terfield, McGarr hit a liner that was
too hot for the third baseman to han
dle, and Ricklefs got to first on the
shortstop's error. With the bases full
O'Meara grounded out to the first- j
baseman. Other highlights of the game
were when the Daily rooting section,
all two of them, arose as one and gave
a long and hearty cheer for their col
leagues in arms.
Burt Davis showed up on the field j
armed with his camera and flashlight j
powder, but Old Mitch, caretaker of
the field, ran him off for fear of blow- |
ing up the bleachers. It is rumored
that he did obtain one picture of the
star first-baseman of the Daily mak- j
ing a beautiful stop with his chin of
Mr. Phillip Space's bullet-like pergs. |
Phillip had an off day both at bat and i
in the field. It is rumored that the
cause of all this was the fact that he
has been spending his nights serenad
ing under Roble's sun porch instead
of going home to bed as all good ball
players should.
Oswill played a nice game for the
Daily, catching good ball and using j
his head when it came to fooling the j
opposing team. Borro, catching for the ;
Press, was one of the mainstays of
his team and two of their runs were ,
due to his sharp hitting. The Daily 1
gang had a hard time getting their i
outfielders to coine in and play in the I
same ball game with them. Some of i
the Castilleja infants were sitting just
outside the centerfield fence so maybe i
there was a reason for Terwilliger's
running around in circles when sev
eral balls were hit to him. At least no !
balls were hit over the outfielders' :
heads.
