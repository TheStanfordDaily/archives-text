# FAST S.C. TEAM HANDS STANFORD FIRST 1929 UPSET
## Trojans Beat Out Cards by 12 Points in Annual West Coast Relays at Fresno Shove, McDermott, Morrison, Syer Win Relay; Nichols Is Triumphant in Hurdles 
### 
FRESNO, April 28. (Special)— Led
by the twinkling heels of Captain
Charlie Borah, the Southern Califor
nia track team handed Stanford its
first defeat this season in the annual
West Coast Relays at Fresno yester
day. The Trojans ran up a strnig 01
first places, with enough seconds
thrown in, to beat out the Cards,
57% to 45%. Farther down came
L.A.A.C., the Olympic Club, California,
and the Trojan frosh.
As one meet record after another
came tumbling down from the high
shelf where it had been jdaced last
year, the ten thousand spectators re
fused to become alarmed, and without
any great commotion watched first
Frank Wyckoff, in Class B, and then
Borah run the 100-yard dash in the
world's record time of 9 3-5 seconds.
Close behind Borah, and closing in on
him like an unleashed greyhound,
came Hec Dyer of Stanford.
The Trojan flash barely beat out his
Stanford rival in the last lap of the
440-yard relay, led his teammates to
victory in the SBO relay, and then sat
down to cool his heels.
L.A.A.C. Wins Two-Mile
Both Cards and Trojans were beat
en in the two-mile relay, by the
L.A.A.C. quartet which included the
justly famed Nick Carter, who ran as
pretty a half-mile as the Fresnans
will ever see, marking up a new meet
time of 7:57.
The Stanford runners came back to
the spotlight in the last two track
events, beating out their competitors
with great ease. Captain Nichols of
the Cards, after winning his heat in
15 flat, skimmed over the high hur
dles in the brilliant time of 14 3-5,
while Leistner, L.A.A.C., and Weber,
S.C., toppled over enough barriers to
keep them away back of the Stanford
skipper.
In the final relay, the one-mile,
Templeton's runners had to go two
hundred miles from home to show
what they could do. Shove and Mc-
Dermott, running first and second for
the Cards, took a slight lead, but Syer
ran the race of his life, giving Mor
rison a fifteen-yard start, and skid to
bis face. Then, sitting up occasionally
with a huge grin on his face, he would
gasp "Cmonjohnnie, cmonjohnnie."
But Johnnie needed no aid, and loafed
home in the startling time of 3:18 2-G,
Weight Setbacks
Both of the star Stanford weight
men suffered setbacks in the shot and
discus, while the Card javelin men,
broad-jumpers, and high-jumpers were
shut out. The Trojans did not do so
well themselves in the field events, but
by this time their score on the track
insured them a first place in the meet.
Huge Herman Brix toiled away to
a mark of 51 feet 11 5-8 inches in the
shot put, giving the L.A.A.C. its sec
ond new record of the day. Rothert
exceeded his usual efforts with 50
feet 7% inches, but Brix's toss was
taking the thing entirely too far.
Krenz took third with 48 feet 6%
inches.
The discus provided one of the
great upsets of the day when Corson
of the Olympic Club won at 151 feet
2 inches. Krenz, the outstanding fa
vorite of the event, was put back to
second with 148 feet IVi inches. Hall,
of the S.C. frosh, took third, and Roth
ert fourth.
Broad Jump
When 24 feet could not receive
recognition in the broad jump, most
of the entries retired from the scene.
Martin, of the Olympic Club, leaped
24 feet 7% inches, taking first, while
between there and 24 feet % inch
came Barber, Kim Dyer, and Paul.
The javelin and high-jump proved
to be two cases of too far and too
high. DeMers, young Oregon high
school boy competing for the L.A.A.C.,
won the spear-tossing with a throw
of 207 feet 1 inch. Mortenson, Trojan
entry, had not been given a chance to
stand the competition, but landed in
second place. The two Californians,
Captain Curtice and Churchill, cap

lured third and fourth.
Williams of SC. took his second
victory over Ward Edmonds of Stan
ford when the latter failed at 13 feet
•i inches, and dropped bark into a tie
for second with Hubbard of S.C. Wil
liams, who cleared 13 feet 6 by what
the spectators called a yard, made 13
feet 1% inches, but knocked the bar
off with great agility when it was
hoisted to 14 feet 2 inches.
