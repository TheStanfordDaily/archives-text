# Senior, Sophomore Women To Clash On Track Today
## 
### 
The first of the series of women's
interclass track meets will take place
this afternoon between the seniors
and sophomores. Although the 1929
team is small, the individual members
have had greater practice thnn the
sophomores, and will probably take
most of the first places.
Katherine Doyle, senior captain,
will run both the hurdles, leaving the
dashes to Thelma Patton. Patton holds
both the hurdle records, but will not
participate in those events until later
in the season. Another first place for
the seniors is assured in the shot put,
in which Lydia Bowen may break her
own record made a year ago. Mar
garet Bullard, sophomore captain, will
probably score well in the track
events.
