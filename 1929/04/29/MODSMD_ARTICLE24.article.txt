Once again the male portion of the Daily staff has wearied tempor
arily of putting out five papers per week, and has declared a holiday,
leaving responsibility in the hands of the women.
In days gone by the Women's Edition has appeared on paper of
various pastel shades, and the columns have been filled predominantly
with activities of the women. The editorial policy of this issue, however,
is against such self-imposed discrimination. Today's Daily is therefore
a regular rather than a special edition. The staff of women is not small
and is quite capable of handling the job.
