Today opens the three-day drive to "break another Stanford record"
in obtaining contributions to the Convalescent Home. This year, con
trary to custom, no definite quota has been set. Last year the quota was
$3500. It is hoped that money obtained from this drive will reach that
amount and even exceed it.
One hundred and fifty-five children were cared for at the Home
during 1928. It is not sentimentality to remember that this care meant
life and health to these children, many of whom were starving for
sunshine and play as well as for proper nourishment. It is the privilege
as well as the responsibility of Stanford students to take care of them.
Last year it cost $2.35 a day to support each child at the Home..
Surely it is not too much to ask that each student give enough to make
possible one day's care at the Home for someone.
