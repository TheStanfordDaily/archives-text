# Another Temperance Problem

Although the number of freshman men admitted to Stanford this
year was cut by 100 from last year's quota, 210 men pledged during this
rushing season as contrasted with 226 last year. Anyone acquainted with
campus gossip during the past two weeks, and we all are, would be in
clined to believe that the rough-and-ready, get-your-man tactics inaugu
rated this spring worked quite well.
In contrast to this free-for-all, one is reminded of the rigid restric
tions which govern women's rushing (and the women observe these rules,
in spite of the fact that it is impossible to convince any fraternity man
on the point). Two weeks are allowed the sororities in which to entertain
the incoming women at luncheon and dinner, and charm them into com
ing your particular house. But this charming must be very subtly done,
for at no time while at table, bridge, or dancing, may the sorority sisters
tell the nugget how marvelous they think she is, and how much they
would love to have her wear their pledge pin, or that their house, and no
other, is the right one to go on grounds of national and campus standing.
Two weeks are spent talking, but no mention is allowed of the subject
at hand.
While the men may be guilty of undue pressure in the "sweat ses
sions" whereby a freshman is talked into taking the button, they are
allowed to talk freely, and use whatever facts, figures, and persuasion
they think suitable.
No sorority woman may enter Roble during rushing, and what is
more, none of them do. The house meetings common in Encina in the
past two weeks stand in vivid contrast. Sisters, when one of them is a
freshman, may not be in Roble together unless properly chaperoned.
Men may visit brothers in Encina with a sponsor's permission.
Women's rules are strict, sometimes to the point of absurdity, and
rushing could well be made much more satisfactory by a greater lenience.
But they are observed, and houses compete on even grounds in this
respect. There is no fear of losing out by not resorting to illegal rushing,
and has been the men's excuse this season.
Supposedly next year fraternities will comply more closely with
interfraternity regulations, whatever they are then, than they have done
this time. It is to be hoped that here, as is so desirable in the matter
of Prohibition, the rules can be made to fit the facts, and so can be
observed.
