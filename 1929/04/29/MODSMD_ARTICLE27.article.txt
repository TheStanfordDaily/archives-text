# OLDER SPEAKS ON MOONEY CASE; PI SIGMA ALPHA GOES ON RECORD FAVORING RELEASE
## 
### 
That the evidence in the famous
Mooney case of 1916 had been insuffi
cient to convict Thomas Mooney and
Warren Billings for bomb-throwing,
and that they should be released from
prison was the belief expressed by
Fremont Older, editor of the San
Francisco Call, who spoke Friday
night at a meeting of Pi Sigma Alpha,
honorary political science society.
Older is well-known as a newspaper
man in San Francisco and the vi
cinity, having been managing editor
of the Bulletin for twenty-four years
before he took the position of editor
of the Call. His book, "My Own Story,"
tells his thrilling experiences as a
participant in the graft prosecutions
of 1906. In spite of the fact that his
life was continually under guard dur
ing this time, he was kidnapped, and
tnken south, where he was finally
rescued. Older has been prominent
since then in criminal work, and to
day helps many men leaving prison,
by giving them work on his farm.
"During one of the San Francisco
preparedness parades of 1916," he said,
relating the story of the Mooney case,
"ten people were killed by a bomb
explosion. Suspicion Immediately cen
tered upon Thomas Mooney, a labor
leader and general trouble maker who
had boen influencial in the I'. G. and
E. strike, and on Warren Billings, a
labor tramp. They were convicted on
slim evidenco, and the former was
sentenced to hanging, while the lat
ter received a life imprisonment sen
tence.
"President Woodrow Wilson, believ

ing them to be innocent, appointed a
committee of investigation, to be
headed by Felix Frankfurter, of the
Harvard Law School. 'Not guilty' was
the report of the commmittee, and
Wilson wired Governor Stevens, who
changed Mooney's sentence to life im
prisonment.
"The evidence on which these men
were convicted has since been dis
proved by two witnesses from Los
Angeles who put Oxman on the train
in that city twenty minutes before
the explosion occurred; and by the
confession of an underworld charac
ter that Oxman was in San Francisco
the day of the outrage.
"In spite of much strong feeling that
they were innocent, including the
statements of many of the men who
had helped to run them down, Mooney
and Billings have been in prison for
thirteen years, kept there by the
powerful elements of the community
who do not want labor trouble-makers
abroad. They are too radical even for
(he labor leaders themselves. Billings
is thirty-three now, and taking a great
interest in gardening at San Quentin;
while Mooney, in Folsom, is living on
a milk-and-orange-juice diet, being
quite a sick man."
Pi Sigma Alpha, after the editor's
talk, voted to go on record as believ
ing in the innocence of Mooney and
Billings.

powerful elements of the community

abroad. They are too radical even for

interest in gardening at San Quentin;

That the evidence in the famous
Mooney case of 1916 had been insuffi
cient to convict Thomas Mooney and
Warren Billings for bomb-throwing,
and that they should be released from
prison was the belief expressed by
Fremont Older, editor of the San
Francisco Call, who spoke Friday
night at a meeting of Pi Sigma Alpha,
honorary political science society.
Older is well-known as a newspaper
man in San Francisco and the vi
cinity, having been managing editor
of the Bulletin for twenty-four years
before he took the position of editor
of the Call. His book, "My Own Story,"
tells his thrilling experiences as a
participant in the graft prosecutions
of 1906. In spite of the fact that his
life was continually under guard dur
ing this time, he was kidnapped, and
tnken south, where he was finally
rescued. Older has been prominent
since then in criminal work, and to
day helps many men leaving prison,
by giving them work on his farm.
"During one of the San Francisco
preparedness parades of 1916," he said,
relating the story of the Mooney case,
"ten people were killed by a bomb
explosion. Suspicion Immediately cen
tered upon Thomas Mooney, a labor
leader and general trouble maker who
had boen influencial in the I'. G. and
E. strike, and on Warren Billings, a
labor tramp. They were convicted on
slim evidenco, and the former was
sentenced to hanging, while the lat
ter received a life imprisonment sen
tence.
"President Woodrow Wilson, believ

ing them to be innocent, appointed a
committee of investigation, to be
headed by Felix Frankfurter, of the
Harvard Law School. 'Not guilty' was
the report of the commmittee, and
Wilson wired Governor Stevens, who
changed Mooney's sentence to life im
prisonment.
"The evidence on which these men
were convicted has since been dis
proved by two witnesses from Los
Angeles who put Oxman on the train
in that city twenty minutes before
the explosion occurred; and by the
confession of an underworld charac
ter that Oxman was in San Francisco
the day of the outrage.
