DOWN WITH THE BASTILLE!
These are days of broken hearts.
Encina is full of them. (They are
strewn hither and yon, in the lobby,
in the corridors, and on the window
sills.)
The last returns are in, and Friday
numerous young gentlemen wept
tears of joy as, entering their future
Stanford homes amidst general oscu
lation, they were greeted as pledges
by the Brotherhoods.
But many another young man, in the
darkness of his room at Encina, wept
tears of bitterness Friday night (the
pledges meanwhile weeping tears of —
well, weeping tears at the Mark Hop
kins, and so on) knowing at last that
his dream of many years was shat
tered, that he would never wear the
cherished Pin, that the Encina Bastille
would be his home throughout his
Stanford days (and that for four long
years his outlook would be striped by
the barred windows of Encina —on the
sill of which, do not forget, rests his
broken heart).
A few, a very few, stay hall because
they want to. Some stay because they
would have one Pin and no other, and
it was not offered to them. Others stay
—just because. Next year some of
them will not come back. They will
take their broken hearts somewhere
else (leaving the lobby, the corridors,
and particularly the window-sills quite
deserted.) The rest will return, philo
sophical, apathetic, or defiant (or in
ebriated).
This morning, between the room
mate who pledged and the roommate
who did not, the relationship is some
how different; and as the weeks pass
the gulf will widen. The new brother
to-be will be dropping up to the House
for lunch, and there will be flurry of

; affairs and, finally, initiation. Their
college worlds will be different.
Stanford is supposedly famous for
its democracy. Among the women this
is true. But it is absolutely impossible
for Stanford men to be democratic,
even though they may wish to be,
under the present hall-or-row situa
tion.
There is a definite boundary line
between the fraternities and the halls,
whereas there is no such demarca
tion between the sororities and Roble.
A Stanford woman is judged by her
fellow-women for herself alone, re
gardless of where she chooses to live.
A great percentage of women living in
Roble are there in preference to the
Row. There are some, of course, who
were disappointed at rushing time;
but the woman who did not join a
sorority, although wishing to do so,
can explain it by saying "I didn't want
to go Row."
The disappointed man cannot use
this alibi. As someone has "It's
easier to pledge a fraternity than to
spend all your time explaining why
you didn't." Even when he does ex
plain, though he may have sincere
convictions against going Row, are his
reasons believed?
In one way, fraternities are a bene
fit: they provide small living groups
which allow a fourth of the men at
Stanford to escape t!ie repressive
boredom (ouch!) of four years in the
hall Bastille. But there will be no de
cent democracy among Stanford men
until there are small living units for
the entire Three Thousand —and with
the Greek letters rubbed off the door
steps.
In other words, fraternities at Stan
ford should be abolished!
