Granada Theatre —Coquette
Fadeout, and final curtain. A portly,
heavy-cheeked gentleman in the first
balcony growled audibly, "terrible."
But his wife, just like 95 per cent of
the other women in the audience of
the Granada theatre Saturday night,
was too busy with her handkerchief to
give any response to his remark.
Well, perhaps the sort of thing that
Mary Pickford does in "Coquette," her
first talkie, didn't appeal to the mas
sive, bald-headed gentleman, and he
may have been quite sincere in his
criticism. But it is difficult to see how
anyone could sit through that picture
unimpressed, unless he were more
callous than a human being has a right
to be.
"Coquette" is magnificent from so
many angles. To begin with, there is
its exquisite leading lady. Mary Pick
ford with bobbed hair has as lovely a
profile and as sweet a smile as ever.
In "Coquette" she plays the part of
a beautiful southern belle —not an
extremely sophisticated role, but still
a long departure from the "little girl
with long curls" part that has made
her famous. Maybe her southern ac
cent is responsible for her marvelous
success in this new character. Her
voice is really lovely and the soft
drawl required in her part brings out
ali its charm. You would never guess
that she came from Canada —the way
she says "heah" and "Ah'm" and "ma
dad" has not affectation.
All the voices are good, by the way,
although in a few spots the men's are
blurred so that sometimes a speech is
lost. But there is no harshness any
where, and the lisping, breathy qual
ity that is one of the worst defects of
"talkies" is almost entirely absent.
Two of the actors are from the south,
and this doesn't hurt their southern

dialect at all.
Mary Pickford's acting will be a
surprise, even to those who think that
they know already how great an artist
she is. The picture, adapted by Sam
Taylor from the play which Ann Pres
ton Bridgers and George Abbott wrote,
has certain big moments, and the lit
tle coquette never fails to give a
strong and tender interpretation of
them.
The court scene, where she is on
the witness stand for lier father who
is on trial for his life, is almost too
overwhelmingly good. A sensitive,
high-strung girl faces the gruelling of
a merciless attorney, and lies and lies,
in the face of memories that are more
than she can bear. Mary Pickford is
at her best here.
With the first character giving such
a superb performance, a less brilliant
cast would very easily appear rather
insignificant. But Johnny Mack Brown,
Matt Moore, and John Sainpolis, each
puts everything into his part that it
affords —which means a great deal, for
the story has a moving and vital plot,
and its tragedy falls on all of its char
acters. Briefly, it concerns a southern
girl who falls in love with a man
whom her father, an aristocratic
southern gentleman, feels is beneath
her. It looks for a while as if she will
have to choose between the two. But
before this can happen, Fate takes
the choice out of her hands.
One of the points that certainly
must not be overlooked is the fact
that the picture is allowed to end as
it should. The accepted American
taste for happy endings didn't bother
the director, evidently. There is no
relief to the tragedy, not even any
hint that everything will work out all
right again sometime. It just ends.
And the audience walks out without
talking very much. —M. L. R.

With the first character giving such
a superb performance, a less brilliant
cast would very easily appear rather
insignificant. But Johnny Mack Brown,
Matt Moore, and John Sainpolis, each
puts everything into his part that it
affords —which means a great deal, for
the story has a moving and vital plot,
and its tragedy falls on all of its char
acters. Briefly, it concerns a southern
girl who falls in love with a man
whom her father, an aristocratic
southern gentleman, feels is beneath
her. It looks for a while as if she will
have to choose between the two. But
before this can happen, Fate takes
the choice out of her hands.
One of the points that certainly
must not be overlooked is the fact
that the picture is allowed to end as
it should. The accepted American
taste for happy endings didn't bother
the director, evidently. There is no
relief to the tragedy, not even any
hint that everything will work out all
right again sometime. It just ends.
And the audience walks out without
talking very much. —M. L. R.
Granada Theatre —Coquette
Fadeout, and final curtain. A portly,
heavy-cheeked gentleman in the first
balcony growled audibly, "terrible."
But his wife, just like 95 per cent of
the other women in the audience of
the Granada theatre Saturday night,
was too busy with her handkerchief to
give any response to his remark.
Well, perhaps the sort of thing that
Mary Pickford does in "Coquette," her
first talkie, didn't appeal to the mas
sive, bald-headed gentleman, and he
may have been quite sincere in his
criticism. But it is difficult to see how
anyone could sit through that picture
unimpressed, unless he were more
callous than a human being has a right
to be.
"Coquette" is magnificent from so
many angles. To begin with, there is
its exquisite leading lady. Mary Pick
ford with bobbed hair has as lovely a
profile and as sweet a smile as ever.
In "Coquette" she plays the part of
a beautiful southern belle —not an
extremely sophisticated role, but still
a long departure from the "little girl
with long curls" part that has made
her famous. Maybe her southern ac
cent is responsible for her marvelous
success in this new character. Her
voice is really lovely and the soft
drawl required in her part brings out
ali its charm. You would never guess
that she came from Canada —the way
she says "heah" and "Ah'm" and "ma
dad" has not affectation.
All the voices are good, by the way,
although in a few spots the men's are
blurred so that sometimes a speech is
lost. But there is no harshness any
where, and the lisping, breathy qual
ity that is one of the worst defects of
"talkies" is almost entirely absent.
Two of the actors are from the south,
and this doesn't hurt their southern

dialect at all.
Mary Pickford's acting will be a
surprise, even to those who think that
they know already how great an artist
she is. The picture, adapted by Sam
Taylor from the play which Ann Pres
ton Bridgers and George Abbott wrote,
has certain big moments, and the lit
tle coquette never fails to give a
strong and tender interpretation of
them.
The court scene, where she is on
the witness stand for lier father who
is on trial for his life, is almost too
overwhelmingly good. A sensitive,
high-strung girl faces the gruelling of
a merciless attorney, and lies and lies,
in the face of memories that are more
than she can bear. Mary Pickford is
at her best here.
