# GLEE CLUB IN FINAL 1929 CONCERT GIVES EXCELLENT PROGRAM
## Variety Numbers Include Two Clog Dances, Unusual Jazz Orchestra 
### Mary Edith Jones 
In a successful and pleasing per
formance, the Stanford Men's Glee
Club ended its 1929 season with the
Annual Home Concert and Theater
Benefit, directed by C. Albert Kul
mann, Friday night in the Assembly
Hall.
The variety numbers on the pro
gram were exceptionally well re
ceived and called for encore after
encore. A quartet, composed of Adel
bert Culling, Ralph Wallace, Jack
Carrington, and Russel Waite, gave
some spicy selections, including the
famous ditty, "Ham and Eggs." Fred
Pearman, who will appear in the Jun
ior Opera, danced two clog numbers,
well executed. The unusual and origi
nal appeared when three members of
the club came forth with a jazz or
chestra of two clarinets and an ac
cordion.
"Old King Cole," by Forsythe, a
humorous arrangement, may be said
to have been the most popular of the
Glee Club's chorus selections. It was
one of the hits of the Paramount
Theater stage in Los Angeles during
the club's recent tour. Dramatic feel
ing was displayed in this number and
also in the "Maiden Fair" by Haydn in
which the tenors took the theme
words of the song, sung by a sere
nader, and the basses took part of
the disgruntled father of the sere
naded young lady.
By far the most difficult of their se
lections was "The Blizzard" by Cad
man; the Glee Club showed remark
able vocal qualities in its rendition
of this piece. "Invictus" by Ruhn and
"The Viking Song" were well chosen
numbers, which brought out the best
tones of the men's voices. "John Piel"
by Anderson was also a good chorus
selection.
Solo performers of the evening
were Ed Simon, Glee Club pianist,
and Adelbert Culling, baritone. Ed
Simon showed great technical ability
in his rendition of (1) "In Babilone,"
arranged by Hoffman; (2) "May
Night," by Palmgren; and (3) "Con
tredans," arranged by Hoffman. Adel
bert Culling pleased the audience with
his two contrasting selections, "Star
Eyes" by Sparks, a lyric piece, and
"Captain Stratton's Fancy" by Tay
lor, a strong energetic number.
Other selections sung by the club
were: "Hallelujah from Messiah" by
Handel; "Gondolier's Serenade" by
Schubert; "By the Sea" by Schubert;
"Die Beiten Grenadieren" by Schu
mann, especially arranged by C. Al
bert Kulmann; "Glorious Apollo" by
Webbe; '"My Bonnie Lass" by More
ley; "Dusk" by Gretchaninioff; "Oh,
Hail Us, Ye Free" by Verdi; and
"Alma Mater" and "Hail, Stanford,
Hail" as the prologue and epilogue
respectively of the program.

nal appeared when three members of
the club came forth with a jazz or
chestra of two clarinets and an ac
cordion.
"Old King Cole," by Forsythe, a
humorous arrangement, may be said
to have been the most popular of the
Glee Club's chorus selections. It was
one of the hits of the Paramount
Theater stage in Los Angeles during
the club's recent tour. Dramatic feel
ing was displayed in this number and
also in the "Maiden Fair" by Haydn in
which the tenors took the theme
words of the song, sung by a sere
nader, and the basses took part of
the disgruntled father of the sere
naded young lady.
By far the most difficult of their se
lections was "The Blizzard" by Cad
man; the Glee Club showed remark
able vocal qualities in its rendition
of this piece. "Invictus" by Ruhn and
"The Viking Song" were well chosen
numbers, which brought out the best
tones of the men's voices. "John Piel"
by Anderson was also a good chorus
selection.
Solo performers of the evening
were Ed Simon, Glee Club pianist,
and Adelbert Culling, baritone. Ed
Simon showed great technical ability
in his rendition of (1) "In Babilone,"
arranged by Hoffman; (2) "May
Night," by Palmgren; and (3) "Con
tredans," arranged by Hoffman. Adel
bert Culling pleased the audience with
his two contrasting selections, "Star
Eyes" by Sparks, a lyric piece, and
"Captain Stratton's Fancy" by Tay
lor, a strong energetic number.
Other selections sung by the club
were: "Hallelujah from Messiah" by
Handel; "Gondolier's Serenade" by
Schubert; "By the Sea" by Schubert;
"Die Beiten Grenadieren" by Schu
mann, especially arranged by C. Al
bert Kulmann; "Glorious Apollo" by
Webbe; '"My Bonnie Lass" by More
ley; "Dusk" by Gretchaninioff; "Oh,
Hail Us, Ye Free" by Verdi; and
"Alma Mater" and "Hail, Stanford,
Hail" as the prologue and epilogue
respectively of the program.

In a successful and pleasing per
formance, the Stanford Men's Glee
Club ended its 1929 season with the
Annual Home Concert and Theater
Benefit, directed by C. Albert Kul
mann, Friday night in the Assembly
Hall.
The variety numbers on the pro
gram were exceptionally well re
ceived and called for encore after
encore. A quartet, composed of Adel
bert Culling, Ralph Wallace, Jack
Carrington, and Russel Waite, gave
some spicy selections, including the
famous ditty, "Ham and Eggs." Fred
Pearman, who will appear in the Jun
ior Opera, danced two clog numbers,
well executed. The unusual and origi
nal appeared when three members of
the club came forth with a jazz or
