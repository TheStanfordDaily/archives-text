# EARLY PHOTOGRAPHER OF STANFORD HORSES DIES AT HOME FRIDAY
## 
### 
John D. Isaacs, retired railroad
executive whose inventive skill as a
young man made possible the suc
cessful action photographs taken on
Governor Stanford's Palo Alto ranch
fifty years ago, will be buried today.
He died at his San Francisco home
Friday.
With the improvement of the photo
graphic plate in the 70's Eadweard
Muybridge, who was working on the
Stanford experiments, was able to
take pictures of moving animals with
exposures of one two-thousandths of
a second, but could not focus accu
rately upon a rapidly moving object
as a trotting horse. Isaacs, then in the
Sacramento shops of the Southern
Pacific, worked out an electrical de
vice making this possible. As a re
sult for the first time in history suc
cessive photographs of the same ani
mal in a series of poses one foot
apart as it moved swiftly ahead could
be taken.
At the University's celebration of
this series of experiments in 1878-79,
the success of which constituted an
essential step in the future develop
ment of the moving picture as it
exists today, it was hoped that Isaacs
could participate, although it was
known that his health might prevent.
Isaacs progressed as constructing
engineer in railroading until he held
the chief position in that department
with companies in the East and in
California. He retired in 1923 after
of service with the Southern
Pacific.
