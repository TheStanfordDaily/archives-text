# SPORTS OF 1929
## After Foreign Honors 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
From third place in her own state
ranking in 1927 to the same position
in national ranking a year later â€”that
is the remarkable progress made by ;
Miss Edith Cross of San Francisco.
Now she is on her first European ten
nis invasion, and if she does as well
in this international venture as she
did in her first national tournament,
it will be truly a remarkable perform
ance.
When the women's national cham
pionship began at Forest Hills last i
August, Edith Cross was just another J
Californian, interesting to meet and
to watch on the courts, but not likely
to get anywhere with the Willses, Ja
cobses, Mallorys, and Wightmans.
When the week of play ended, it was
with somewhat of a shock that East
erners realized that the playing of
Edith Cross had been one of the
features of the tournament, and that
her hard-hitting and all-around abil
ity had enabled her to reach the semi

finals in the singles and the finals in
the doubles. Paired with Mrs. L. A.
Harper, also of California, Edith lost
to Helen Wills and Mrs. Wightman
at 6-2, 6-2, but not before they had de
feated the famous Mrs. Bundy and
Helen Jacobs in the semi-finals. In
the singles, Miss Cross was beaten by
Helen Wills, after winning from Miss
Gladman, Mrs. Stenz, and Mrs. Wight
man.
The following week at Longwood,
Mass., Edith Cross won more honors
for herself when, paired with E. F.
Moon of Australia, she reached the
final round of the mixed doubles
championship, defeating, en route,
such strong combinations as Mr. and
Mrs. Chapin, and Mrs. Mallory and
Jack Crawford.

Miss Cross hits as hard as any
woman player except Queen Helen,
has speed of foot, the ability to go to
the net, and a puzzling slice to her
service. She is young, and will go
far in the world of tennis.
