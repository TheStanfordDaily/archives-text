# Rebel Leaders Remain In South, Hold Back Advance
## 
### 
NOGALES, Ariz., April 28.
erals Fausto Topete and Manuel
Aguirre, of the rebel armies, were the
only important insurgent leaders who
had failed to arrive at headquarters
here today. They were reported re
maining in Southern Sonora to hold
back the victorious advance of federal
troops up the west coast.
No rebel leaders had attempted to
cross the border into the United
States late today. Fear that soldiers
of the rebel cause in Nogales might
change sides if pressed by federals,
held the insurgent leaders here, they
hinted.
