doin. Based on their performances
over the week-end from Philadelphia
to Des Moines to Fresno, George Simp

Junior College, and Charley Borah,
University of Southern California,
have established themselves as to the
country's leading dash men. Between
them this group equalled the listed
world's record of 9 3-5 seconds for the
100 yards no fewer than five times
yesterday.
DRIVE is ON
Oliltown, Ohio, a drowsy village, will
be destroyed by a city water reservoir
to be built on its site by the city of
Youngstown.
