# PLOT EMPHASIS PUTS JUNIOR OPERA IN LINE WITH MODERN TRENDS
## 
### 
Keeping in line with the modern
trend in musical comedies, there is
more plot in "Moving On," the Junior
Opera to be presented on the campus
May 11, than in most previous oper
ettas. No longer will a flimsy variation
of a boy-and-girl romance, during in
tervals of which a chorus pops onto
the stage for no other reason than
that it is about time for another song
and-dance number, fill the require
ments for a musical comedy. And, be
sides concocting a clever story, the
Junior Opera authors —Laird Doyle,
John Paul Jones, and James Webb —
have used a circus lot for the locale
of the comedy, a circus lot where all
the freaks and side-show performers
wander around; a circus lot, where
anything can, and does, happen.
Gary, the hero —played by Tom
Watt —is a small-town boy, accused of
a crime of which he is entirely inno
cent. In escaping from the police he
hides in the circus lot, where he falls
into the hands of two of the tough
characters of the company, Zuzu and
Ricardo, played by Jeanette Owens
and Tom Henry, who decide to use
him as a foil to hide their own plot
to wreck the show. The situation is
further complicated by Garry's falling
in love with Sally, one of the troup
ers, played by Helen Ward.
But with the blame of the villains'
plans to ruin the circus falling upon
him, coupled with the accusation of
the earlier crime, Garry is put in a
position which prevents him and Sally
from achieving happiness — but a
tricky turn of circumstances at the
right time gives the story its propor
musical-comedy ending.
DRIVE IS ON
