# PREDICT DEFEAT OF DEBENTURE PLAN IN SENATE THIS WEEK
## Conference of Both Houses To Handle Farm Bill Believe Leaders 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 28. (#>)—With
a close vote in prospect, the Senate
will reach a decision this week on the
disputed export debenture plan and
possibly wlil pass some form of farm
relief legislation.
Administration leaders are confi
dent that they have enough support
to defeat the debenture plan objected
to by President Hoover and that they
will be able to pass a measure similar
to that already approved by the House.
If their plans are carried out, the
farm bill will be in the hands of a
Senate and House conference by the
end of the week with the expectation
that another fortnight will see the
legislation to serve as a groundwork
for solving the agricultural problem,
enacted into law .
The calculations of the Republican
leaders, however, hinge entirely 011
the success of Administration Sena
tors in blocking the adoption of the
debenture plan. Should this provision,
in spite of their careful checking of
the Senate membership, be written
into the farm bill, none of them would
hazard a guess as to the outcome of
agricultural legislation.
