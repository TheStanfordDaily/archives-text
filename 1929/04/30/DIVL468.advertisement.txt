JIMP ANTS Pi AY
NC fAVCCITIS
The portly banker enjoys the colorful
smartness, the ease and freedom of his
Jimpants and Jim shirts....so does the trimly
built athlete....so does the husky lad who
toils aloft on iron girders....you can't con
fine a good thing like Jimpants to any
one class of men....They're made
for "regular" fellows of
every type, every
where.
