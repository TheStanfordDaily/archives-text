There
is nothing
quite like
the new
Ford
anywhere
in
design,
quality
and price
NEW FORD ROADSTER
*450
(F. O. B. Detroit, pint

THE new Ford is a
really fine car selling at
a low price. That's the
whole story of its un
usual speed, power, ac
celeration, comfort,
safety, reliability, and
low up-keep cost.
Come in and let us
tell you of the quality
that has been built into
this car and of the new
manufacturing meth
ods that enable the
Ford Motor Company
to sell it at such a low
price.
