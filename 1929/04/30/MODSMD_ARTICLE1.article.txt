# NEW YORK TRAIN WRECK KILLS 4, MANY ARE HURT
## Collision Occurs on Uptown Elevated Structure With 3,500 Passengers Aboard Fire Outbreak Starts Panic; Increased Speed Declared Cause of Subway Accident 
### 
NEW YORK, April 29. (/P)—Foui
persons were killed and 14 were in
jured today in a collision on an up
town elevated structure of two trains
•carrying approximately 3500 men and
women office workers.
The collision killed three persons
outright and fatally injured another
and fire that followed the smash
caused a straphangers' panic in which
dozens were trampled.
Early investigation attributed the
collision partly to the fact that per
fect safety had been subordinated to
the urgency of the meeting office time
clock's demands for punctuality, and
partly to a motorman's relaxing his
vigilance to consider whatever it may
be that a motorman turns his thoughts
to in the spring.
The crash occurred at 8:15 o'clock
at the height of the rush hour.
It happened above the point where
the subway trains crawl up out of the
ground and share the elevated rail
load tracks with the regular "L"
trains.
The block signal system, investiga
tion indicated, is overridden in these
lush hours, the red light being "keyed
out" to permit the trains to proceed
virtually in lockstep and so get their
occupants to their offices on time.
The collision, at the 167 th St., one
station above the Yankee Stadium,
was caused by a 10-car steel subway
train ramming a seven-car wooden
elevated train.
James Cullen, motorman of the
i-übway train, was instantly killed, as
were William J. Schultz, a 19-year-old
student, standing at the front of the
subway train, and an unidentified
youth standing on the rear platform
ot the elevated train. Michael McLean,
another passenger, died in a hospital
later of a fractured skull. Of the 44
injured seven were reported in serious
condition.
The elevated train had halted just
outßide the 107 th St. sation to let a
subway train ahead of it clear. As
Cullen was leaving the 170 th St. sta
tion the automatic stop signal was
against him.
"Cullen opened his cab and said
'hello,'" Andrew Concorn, tripper at
the 170 th St. station told the district
attorney later. "I answered him hello
and then looked ahead and saw traffic
was backed up. 1 said to Cullen. "I'm
going to key you through. Look out
for the 'L' train ahead of you.'"

and fire that followed the smash
caused a straphangers' panic in which
dozens were trampled.
Early investigation attributed the
collision partly to the fact that per
fect safety had been subordinated to
the urgency of the meeting office time
clock's demands for punctuality, and
partly to a motorman's relaxing his
vigilance to consider whatever it may
be that a motorman turns his thoughts
to in the spring.
The crash occurred at 8:15 o'clock
at the height of the rush hour.
It happened above the point where
the subway trains crawl up out of the
ground and share the elevated rail
load tracks with the regular "L"
trains.
The block signal system, investiga
tion indicated, is overridden in these
lush hours, the red light being "keyed
out" to permit the trains to proceed
virtually in lockstep and so get their
occupants to their offices on time.
The collision, at the 167 th St., one
station above the Yankee Stadium,
was caused by a 10-car steel subway
train ramming a seven-car wooden
elevated train.
James Cullen, motorman of the
i-übway train, was instantly killed, as
were William J. Schultz, a 19-year-old
student, standing at the front of the
subway train, and an unidentified
youth standing on the rear platform
ot the elevated train. Michael McLean,
another passenger, died in a hospital
later of a fractured skull. Of the 44
injured seven were reported in serious
condition.
The elevated train had halted just
outßide the 107 th St. sation to let a
subway train ahead of it clear. As
Cullen was leaving the 170 th St. sta
tion the automatic stop signal was
against him.
"Cullen opened his cab and said
'hello,'" Andrew Concorn, tripper at
the 170 th St. station told the district
attorney later. "I answered him hello
and then looked ahead and saw traffic
was backed up. 1 said to Cullen. "I'm
going to key you through. Look out
for the 'L' train ahead of you.'"
