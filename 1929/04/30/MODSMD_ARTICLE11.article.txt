# CONSTRUCTION OF CARD GOLF COURSE BEGINS IMMEDIATELY
## Nationally Famous Architects Ordered to Take Charge of Project at Once, Announces Alfred G. Masters 
### 
Dreams of a Stanford golf course, are near realization with the announcement
yesterday that A1 Masters, general manager of the Board of Athletic Control, had
been directed hy the organization to begin construction on the project at once. Word
of the move was dispatched to Bell and Thomas, nationally famous golf course
architects of Pasadena, who were ordered to take charge immediately.
The final straightening out of irrigation dicultifs, which heretofore has fore
stalled the project, was thought to be the main reason for the move toward making
the new course an actuality, although the Comptroller's office declined to make any
statements regarding the matter in the absence of Comptroller A. E. Roth.
The new grass course is expected to be one of the finest and most picturesque
in the state, and will cost approximately $100,000. The present layout of the course
provides for the first nine holes between Lake Lagunita and San Francisquito creek

and north of the County Road. The
last nine will be loeated on the other side
of the road and will run south and west
into the hills. The course is expected to
be completed before February 1 of next

year.
Because of apparent lack of interest
among people of the vicinity who are
eligible for outside memberships, the
Board has decided to cut the maximum
number eligible from 200 to 150. Ninety
six of this number have already made a
$50 deposit, which entitles them to prior
ity in membership rights.
Green fees of $6 per month or $15 per
quarter will be charged students and
faculty members.
