Playing air-tight ball behind fast
breaking curves of Vard Loomis, El
Toro cinched the championship of
League 4 in the mural baseball series
yesterday afternoon with a hard
fought win over El Tigre.
Loomis struck out twelve of the El
Tigre batters. He should have won
by a shut-out, a "boner" allowing the
losers to tally one run. Richards stole
home, when the El Tigre base coaches
talked Toro's catcher into strolling
away from the home plate.
The game was featured by the heavy
hitting of Vein Brown, outfielder for
the winners. He hit three for four,
one of them going for two bases. An
other of his hard drives went for a
triple, when Milt Cohen misjudged
the fly out in center field. Besides
catching a great game, Don Brown
led the Tigre attack with two safe
blows, a single, and a double.
Newton started in the box for the
losing outfit, but he didn't last long.
El Toro solved his deliveries in the
third inning, and socked the ball out
for three singles before Youd was
rushed into the box for Tigre.
Ed Robinson was in good form yes
terday and he pitched Delta Chi to an
easy win over the S.A.E.'s. The lanky
twirler let the losers down with throe
scattered hits, as well as striking out
seventeen batters to tie the mural
strike-out record of the season.
The winning team played a good
fielding game and hit the ball hard
to shove across eleven runs. Biaggini
and L. Hall led the hitters with three
safe blows each.
