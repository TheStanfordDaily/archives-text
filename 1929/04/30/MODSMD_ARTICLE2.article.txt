## 
### 
The May number of the Stanford
Literary Magazine will come off the
press at the end of the week and will
be on sale Monday. This issue con
tains more material than any other
of this year's and has a wide diversi
fication of articles.
Three short stories and one play
comprise the fiction of the May num
ber. "Seven Up" by Blanch Barnett
is a first person story realistically
told about a Hollywood girl who
finally finds her "luck" at dice. In
style, the story somewhat resembles
Robert Clarke's "The Gang," which
appeared in the January number.
There are also short stories by Lin
coln Hobson and Laird Doyle, a one
net play by Robert Cathcart, four es
nays, and a technical article explain
ing and illustrating Analysed Rhyme,
a new verse form.
