# Three Plays To Be Given On Campus This Summer
## 
### 
Three plays will be produced at
Stanford during the summer quarter,
according to plans announced yester
day by Gordon Davis. They are "White
Wings," by Philip Barry; "Macropou
li's Secret," by Chapek; and "Six
Characters in Search of an Author."
"White Wings" will be given its
Pacific Coast premier in the Stanford
production. "Macropouli's Secret," an
intellectual melodrama on the theme
of longevity, has for its leading char
acter a woman 360 years old. "Six
Characters in Search of an Author" is
somewhat similar but more difficult
than "Right You Are," presented on
the campus last year.
