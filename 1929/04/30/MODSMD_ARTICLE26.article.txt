# Concerning Summer Quarter
## 
### 
The Stanford Summer Quarter is one of the four regular terms of
the college year; it is on precisely the same academic plane as that of the
other three quarters; its courses have exactly the same weight toward
degrees; it is not a sort of Chautauqua under university auspices, like
some of the old-time "summer sessions" offered by some universities;
its work is not easier than in other quarters, on the contrary in some cases
it is more intensive and harder.
Nevertheless, the Summer Quarter has its own distinctive character,
different from any found during the rest of the year. Both the student
l)ody and the faculty have a larger admixture of elements from outside
the usual campus population. This offers advantages through contacts
with fellow students with varied experience and through the special
courses offered by experts from other universities, American and Euro
pean.
It is worth noting that every summer has shown a greater propotrion
of regular Stanford students taking work in the summer than in pre
ceding years, and this tendency will seemingly be maintained this year.
For such students there is opportunity to concentrate on studies without
the distractions of customary social and "activity" interests of the other
quarters, the chance to finish up some lines for which there is not time
in the schedules controlled by required courses, to catch up in "hours"
or to pile up a reserve ahead, or to shorten the number of years required
for graduation. Practically all courses can be followed in the summer
as well as other terms and in some instances special work may be under
taken that is available at 110 other time.
Summer is a normal time for recreation, and this is borne in mind.
The climate of Stanford does not make summer study the hard task
that it is in some other localities which have sultry, hot days in July and
August. Brain work can l>e done with ease and comfort here, but at the
same time there is need for relaxation, and this is met by a variety of
social events, by trips to nearby points of interest which many Stanford
students never find time for, by intramural athletic competitions, and by
an unusually large program of lectures and entertainments.
One surprising characteristic of the Summer Quarter is the quick
ness with which students coming from outside the campus are absorbed
into the native Stanford body and absorb the Stanford spirit. The Sum
mer Quarter student body is as completely Stanford as that of the rest
of the year.

For such students there is opportunity to concentrate on studies without
the distractions of customary social and "activity" interests of the other
quarters, the chance to finish up some lines for which there is not time
in the schedules controlled by required courses, to catch up in "hours"
or to pile up a reserve ahead, or to shorten the number of years required
for graduation. Practically all courses can be followed in the summer
as well as other terms and in some instances special work may be under
taken that is available at 110 other time.
Summer is a normal time for recreation, and this is borne in mind.
The climate of Stanford does not make summer study the hard task
that it is in some other localities which have sultry, hot days in July and
August. Brain work can l>e done with ease and comfort here, but at the
same time there is need for relaxation, and this is met by a variety of
social events, by trips to nearby points of interest which many Stanford
students never find time for, by intramural athletic competitions, and by
an unusually large program of lectures and entertainments.
One surprising characteristic of the Summer Quarter is the quick
ness with which students coming from outside the campus are absorbed
into the native Stanford body and absorb the Stanford spirit. The Sum
mer Quarter student body is as completely Stanford as that of the rest
of the year.

The Stanford Summer Quarter is one of the four regular terms of
the college year; it is on precisely the same academic plane as that of the
other three quarters; its courses have exactly the same weight toward
degrees; it is not a sort of Chautauqua under university auspices, like
some of the old-time "summer sessions" offered by some universities;
its work is not easier than in other quarters, on the contrary in some cases
it is more intensive and harder.
Nevertheless, the Summer Quarter has its own distinctive character,
different from any found during the rest of the year. Both the student
l)ody and the faculty have a larger admixture of elements from outside
the usual campus population. This offers advantages through contacts
with fellow students with varied experience and through the special
courses offered by experts from other universities, American and Euro
pean.
It is worth noting that every summer has shown a greater propotrion
of regular Stanford students taking work in the summer than in pre
ceding years, and this tendency will seemingly be maintained this year.
