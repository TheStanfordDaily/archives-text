# EXTENSIVE PLANS FOR NEXT QUARTER MADE BY MARINE STATION
## 
### 
Extensive plans have been made by
the Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific
Grove for intensive research and aca
ter. More courses are offered during
demic work during the summer quar
the summer term than at any other
time during the year at the Marine
Station. No formal work is offered
there in either winter or fall quar
ters.
The research program in a general
way concerns itself with oceanic bio
logy. Rich fauna and flora of the
Monterey Bay region offer laboratory
material for the investigator and be
ginning student alike. A large number
of marine animals and plants are
readily accessible. Work on normal
and controlled development of certain
of the invertebrates is under way.
One of the most recent develop
ments at the Hopkins Marine Station
is the completion of the Jacques Loeb
Laboratory, devoted to experimental
biology. The laboratory was finished
last summer.
Dr. Walter Kendrick Fisher, a Stan
ford graduate and professor of
zoology, is Director of Hopkins Ma
rine Station. Among the visiting pro
fessors who are to be at the Marine
Station are Cornelius Bernardus vau
Niel, who is conservator at the Lab
oratory for Microbiology at Delft, Hol
land. Dr. Arthur Russell Moore, pro
fessor of general physiology at the
University of Oregon, has been se
cured as lecturer in general physi
ology at the Marine Station.
The calendar of the Hopkina Ma
rine Station differs slightly from that
of the University in that instruction
begins June 20 and ends August 17.
