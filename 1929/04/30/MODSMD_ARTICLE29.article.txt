"Samuel Dodsworth was, perfectly, the
American Captain of Industry, believing
in the Republican Party, high tariff, and,
so long as they did not annoy him per
sonally, in prohibition and the Episcopal
Church. He was the president of the
Revelation Motor Company; he was a
millionaire, though decidedly not a multi
millionaire; his large house was on Ridge
Crest, the most fashionable street in Ze
nith ; he had some taste in etchings ; he
did not split many infinitives; and he
sometimes enjoyed Beethoven. He would
certainly (so the observer assumed) pro
duce excellent motor cars; he would
make impressive speeches to the sales
men ; but he would never love passion
ately, lose tragically, nor sit in contented
idleness upon tropic shores."
Do you see him—Samuel Dodsworth ?
Yes ?
Something happened to Samuel Dods
worth. And his wife, Fran, was the cause
of what happened. Having disposed of
his interest in the motor car company of
which he was president, Samuel was led
away from Zenith, from America, was led
to travel, to go to Europe, by whom?—
By his wife, of course. It was in Europe
that something happened to Sam. What
happened, changed Sam as much as a
metamorphosis changes an insect — as
much, but differently. The metamorpho
sis that affected Sam transformed his
ideas. His somatic appearance remained
as it was, unchanged. Sam was trans
formed, radically changed—but not in
any visible way, not in a way you could
see. After living in Paris, in Venice, in
Berlin—after living in Europe, in short,
Samuel Dodsworth was not at all the
same sort of man who had worked for
years and years in America, who had
"made his million" in the thriving city of
Zenith.
It happened this way. Sam's wife
thought him crude. Oh, so crude 1 He
would never be able to enjoy leisure as
she would. She was sure of that—his
wife was. Sure. She was so much "finer"
than he was—so much more sensitive.
After Sam had tried to be patient with
this wife of his—she who thought him
so crude —after he had tried, again and
again, even Sam tired of trying to be

patient, ceased trying, left his wife—left
her free to marry the German nobleman
she felt at the moment she adored. He
knew he was crude, and thought it too
had that he was. He felt lachrymose in
deed at leaving his wife to another—but
left her.
Having left his wife, Sam saw Europe
in his own way. He traveled alone. Sad
he was, and lonely. Then he met Edith
Cortright, an attractive American widow
domiciled in Venice. This woman had
lived long in Italy. She was one having
entree everywhere. She was herself of
the elite of her adopted country.
Seated by the Villa Ercole, seated on
an eminence, high above the Bay of
Naples, seated out of doors in the sun
shine, Edith speaks to Sam of America,
and of Europe too.
. . Your farmers want to get away
from their wash of acres to the city.
Your business men drive out to the golf
club in closed sedans, and tjicy don't
want just bare earth —they want the
earth of the golf course all neatly con
cealed by lawn. And I—you think of
me as sitting in drawing-rooms, but here
you've seen me reveling in sea water and
running on the beach. And often and
often when you think I'm napping in my
room, I sneak out to that little bit of
walled-off garden just above the house
and lie there in the hot sun, in the wind,
smelling of the recking earth, finding
life! That's the strength of Europe— not
its so-called 'culture,' its galleries and
neat voices and knowledge of languages,
but its nearness to earth. And that's the
weakness of America—not its noisiness
and its cruelty and its cinema vulgarity
but the way in which it erects steel-and
glass skyscrapers and miraculous cement
and-glass factories and tiled kitchens and
wireless antennae and popular magazines
to insulate it from the good vulgarity of
earth I"
About all that Edith said, and Edith
said many things, Sam wondered. Then
his ideas changed. True, he was crude
still. But it seemed to him, the new Sam,
that it was not tragic, this crudity of
his. His wife had made it needful for
him to leave her. He had then found
Edith. Then something had happened to
him. Life seemed worth living again—
with Edith.

"Samuel Dodsworth was, perfectly, the
American Captain of Industry, believing
in the Republican Party, high tariff, and,
so long as they did not annoy him per
sonally, in prohibition and the Episcopal
Church. He was the president of the
Revelation Motor Company; he was a
millionaire, though decidedly not a multi
millionaire; his large house was on Ridge
Crest, the most fashionable street in Ze
nith ; he had some taste in etchings ; he
did not split many infinitives; and he
sometimes enjoyed Beethoven. He would
certainly (so the observer assumed) pro
duce excellent motor cars; he would
make impressive speeches to the sales
men ; but he would never love passion
ately, lose tragically, nor sit in contented
idleness upon tropic shores."
Do you see him—Samuel Dodsworth ?
Yes ?
Something happened to Samuel Dods
worth. And his wife, Fran, was the cause
of what happened. Having disposed of
his interest in the motor car company of
which he was president, Samuel was led
away from Zenith, from America, was led
to travel, to go to Europe, by whom?—
By his wife, of course. It was in Europe
that something happened to Sam. What
happened, changed Sam as much as a
metamorphosis changes an insect — as
much, but differently. The metamorpho
sis that affected Sam transformed his
ideas. His somatic appearance remained
as it was, unchanged. Sam was trans
formed, radically changed—but not in
any visible way, not in a way you could
see. After living in Paris, in Venice, in
Berlin—after living in Europe, in short,
Samuel Dodsworth was not at all the
same sort of man who had worked for
years and years in America, who had
"made his million" in the thriving city of
Zenith.
It happened this way. Sam's wife
thought him crude. Oh, so crude 1 He
would never be able to enjoy leisure as
she would. She was sure of that—his
wife was. Sure. She was so much "finer"
than he was—so much more sensitive.
After Sam had tried to be patient with
this wife of his—she who thought him
so crude —after he had tried, again and
again, even Sam tired of trying to be

patient, ceased trying, left his wife—left
her free to marry the German nobleman
she felt at the moment she adored. He
knew he was crude, and thought it too
had that he was. He felt lachrymose in
deed at leaving his wife to another—but
left her.
Having left his wife, Sam saw Europe
in his own way. He traveled alone. Sad
he was, and lonely. Then he met Edith
Cortright, an attractive American widow
domiciled in Venice. This woman had
lived long in Italy. She was one having
entree everywhere. She was herself of
the elite of her adopted country.
Seated by the Villa Ercole, seated on
an eminence, high above the Bay of
Naples, seated out of doors in the sun
shine, Edith speaks to Sam of America,
and of Europe too.

from their wash of acres to the city.
Your business men drive out to the golf

he was, and lonely. Then he met Edith
Cortright, an attractive American widow
domiciled in Venice. This woman had
lived long in Italy. She was one having
entree everywhere. She was herself of
the elite of her adopted country.
Seated by the Villa Ercole, seated on
an eminence, high above the Bay of
Naples, seated out of doors in the sun
shine, Edith speaks to Sam of America,
and of Europe too.
. . Your farmers want to get away
from their wash of acres to the city.
Your business men drive out to the golf
club in closed sedans, and tjicy don't
want just bare earth —they want the
earth of the golf course all neatly con
cealed by lawn. And I—you think of
me as sitting in drawing-rooms, but here
you've seen me reveling in sea water and
running on the beach. And often and
often when you think I'm napping in my
room, I sneak out to that little bit of
walled-off garden just above the house
and lie there in the hot sun, in the wind,
smelling of the recking earth, finding
life! That's the strength of Europe— not
its so-called 'culture,' its galleries and
neat voices and knowledge of languages,
but its nearness to earth. And that's the
weakness of America—not its noisiness
and its cruelty and its cinema vulgarity
but the way in which it erects steel-and
glass skyscrapers and miraculous cement
and-glass factories and tiled kitchens and
wireless antennae and popular magazines
to insulate it from the good vulgarity of
earth I"
About all that Edith said, and Edith
said many things, Sam wondered. Then
his ideas changed. True, he was crude
still. But it seemed to him, the new Sam,
that it was not tragic, this crudity of
his. His wife had made it needful for
him to leave her. He had then found
Edith. Then something had happened to
him. Life seemed worth living again—
with Edith.

"Samuel Dodsworth was, perfectly, the
American Captain of Industry, believing
in the Republican Party, high tariff, and,
so long as they did not annoy him per
sonally, in prohibition and the Episcopal
Church. He was the president of the
Revelation Motor Company; he was a
millionaire, though decidedly not a multi
millionaire; his large house was on Ridge
Crest, the most fashionable street in Ze
nith ; he had some taste in etchings ; he
did not split many infinitives; and he
sometimes enjoyed Beethoven. He would
certainly (so the observer assumed) pro
duce excellent motor cars; he would
make impressive speeches to the sales
men ; but he would never love passion
ately, lose tragically, nor sit in contented
idleness upon tropic shores."
Do you see him—Samuel Dodsworth ?
Yes ?
Something happened to Samuel Dods
worth. And his wife, Fran, was the cause
of what happened. Having disposed of
his interest in the motor car company of
which he was president, Samuel was led
away from Zenith, from America, was led
to travel, to go to Europe, by whom?—
By his wife, of course. It was in Europe
that something happened to Sam. What
happened, changed Sam as much as a
metamorphosis changes an insect — as
much, but differently. The metamorpho
sis that affected Sam transformed his
ideas. His somatic appearance remained
as it was, unchanged. Sam was trans
formed, radically changed—but not in
any visible way, not in a way you could
see. After living in Paris, in Venice, in
Berlin—after living in Europe, in short,
Samuel Dodsworth was not at all the
same sort of man who had worked for
years and years in America, who had
"made his million" in the thriving city of
Zenith.
It happened this way. Sam's wife
thought him crude. Oh, so crude 1 He
would never be able to enjoy leisure as
she would. She was sure of that—his
wife was. Sure. She was so much "finer"
than he was—so much more sensitive.
After Sam had tried to be patient with
this wife of his—she who thought him
so crude —after he had tried, again and
again, even Sam tired of trying to be

patient, ceased trying, left his wife—left
her free to marry the German nobleman
she felt at the moment she adored. He
knew he was crude, and thought it too
had that he was. He felt lachrymose in
deed at leaving his wife to another—but
left her.
