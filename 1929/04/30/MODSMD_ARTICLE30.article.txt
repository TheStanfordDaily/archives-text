## RANDOM RECOLLECTIONS OF A FRESNO TREK 
### 
Two and a half hours late, we are
taking off for Fresno and the West
Coast Relays. The red "Miss Stan
ford," with Lieutenant Brown at the
controls, is off the ground with a roar
of her big Wright motor. A farewell
sweep over the Palo Alto field, and
we are away.
A beautiful day for flying. Bob
King, lolling in the seat beside me,
cusses the Olympic Club for forget
ting him—and worries about the meet.
All four of us mentally booting our
selves for forgetting to grab some
lunch. Over Pacheco Pass, with a
strong tail wind helping us to race
by the diminutive cars swerving along
the highway below. Fresno ahead,
roads packed with automobiles, and
we are above the field. Down we go,
speeding across the grassy runway,
and then stop before the hangars.
Rushing to the stadium in an
official car, then ail of us through
the participants' gate as Olympic
Club stars. Thank you, Mr. Hun
ter. Down on the field as Stanford
junior managers. Such luck.
The first event—the hundred.
Frank Wyckoff of Glendale hurt
ling down the lane, neatly trip
ping at the end, and recovering
to take first. Hec Dyer closing in
on curly-headed Charlie Borah.
Two watches catching each race
in 9.4 seconds, and five in 9.6.
Bob King, not the least cramped by
his ride, smiling as he clears 6 feet,
grinning at 6 feet 2, and laughing
outright as he sails over 6 feet 4%,
breaking his own meet record. He
suggests pinning the Navajo good
luck sign over the Club's winged "O"
on his jersey.
Herman Brix, built like a ten-story,
block-square building, Bhoving the
shot over 51 feet in his event. Ed
monds, a bit too nervous, falling three
limes at 13 feet 6. Williams of Troy
making it.

And then the discus. Jim Cor
son, of the Olympic Club, getting
off a throw of about 151 feet, and
winning the event. Krenz, Stan
ford hope, kept down to 148 feet.
All credit to one infantile person,
who, having picked up a mega
phone, takes it upon himself to
inform the crowd every two min
utes: "Eric Krenz —of the Stan
ford varsity—about to throw—the
discus!"
The announcer's bellow 1b awful, hla
pronunciation terrible, hla posture Im
possible. But his tlminfi —he Rives his
little recitation Just as each discus
thrower winds up. Tulk about unnerv

ing people. And the crowd is equally
bothered.
Immediately after, a Stanford
lynching party, headed by Bud
Spencer, looking for the an
nouncer.

Ross Nichols running away with the
high hurdles as if he were the only
man in the event. The result at the
finish line looks like it. Bob Syer in
vading the ranks of "Stanford's feared
quarter-milers."
Back to the flying field in Dink
Templeton's car, with King grinning
like a two-year-old. And a brand-new
wrist watch with suitable inscriptions
thereon. A lack of gas in the car,
causing a delayed arrival at the field.
The take-off again, amidst hundreds
of gaping faces. We think of Lind
bergh. Over the clouds hiding Pacheco
Pass, and swooping down on the home
field. Numerous hand-shakings, signs
of relief from waiting friends — and
dinner.
