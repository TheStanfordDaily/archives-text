Summer quarter students at Stan
ford will have the opportunity to hear
one of the best symphony orchestras
in the country conducted by world
famous conductors because of the
proximity to the campus of the Wood
land Theatre at Hillsborough where
the Philharmonic Society of San Ma
teo County will present for the fourth
season a series of concerts on Sunday
afternoons, beginning June 23 and
continuing through August 11.
Concerts will be given by the per

have been secured as guest directors
for the various concerts. Bernardino
Molinari, who last year made his

San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
during its regular season, will lead
his men for one concert in the sum
mer series.
Ernest Bloch, another conductor
now a resident of San Francisco, and
composer of the prize-winning Ameri
can Symphony "America" last winter,
will be guest conductor for one pro

the Eastman School of Music and
Conductor of the Orchestra at that
institution, is scheduled for one after
noon. The final three concerts will be
conducted by Bruno Walter.
Through the courtesy of the Board
of Directors of the Philharmonic So

be made available to summer quarter
students at Stanford at special rates.

grades from C's to B's and from B's
to A's," says Tom Barnard, editor of
the University of Washington Daily.
