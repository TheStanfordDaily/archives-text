# SPORTS OF 1929

### BY FEG MURRAY 
The Giant shortstop's middle name
is Calvin. But he is not a man of
few words, at least not compared to
Calvin Coolidge. And he is a graduate I
of Ouachita Baptist College, Arkadel- j
phia, Arkansas. (I scarcely know what
to say about that one; it's pretty
tough, especially that "Arkadelphia." j
At any rate, "Jax" is one of the many |
college graduates or near graduates !
who are performing brilliantly in the |
majors.)
The Giants, many fans claim, have i
the greatest infield in baseball today. J
They make up for not having a vet- i
eran star at second by having two ■
potential stars in Andy Reese and :
Andy Cohen. Terry, Lindstrom, and
Jackson are fixtures, and hard to beat
in any league. Jackson, now in his
eighth season with McGraw's team, is
no Hans Wagner at the bat, but he
does come through in the pinches,
and he can field and throw with the
best of them. Witness the important
series that bob up each season with i
the Cubs, Pirates, or Cards. It is in j

out like a lighthouse in a stormy
night. Playing at the top of his form,
he is an inspiration to the rest of the
team. In the Giant series with the
Cubs, for instance, a year ago last
summer, "Jax" drove in fourteen
runs, hit four homers, and batted .591
in the six games, to send the Wrigley
ites away sadder but wiser.
As a fielder, Travis has a great rov
ing radius, being especially good at
going back to his right and knocking
down drives to deep short. His throws
are marvels of speed and accuracy,
and, when he isn't handicapped by in
juries, he is easily the best shortstop
in the league.
