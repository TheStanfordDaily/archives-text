"Ole Man Sunshine" is with us and everything is bright and
rosy—How about spreading a little sunshine of your own?

to be there and do your bit —a workout in the sun is the best
thing in the world and at the same time you are helping out
those little tots —und then there's the feed and the entertain
ment after your efforts —so BE THERE READY FOR WORK— !
Now that that's off our chest how about those things that go to
make one's summer outfit a success. From now on there will be ■
plenty of tempting days for swimming and golfing, as well as
other light divertisements that real nice days call for, and be-
me, the old shop has gathered together some mighty nifty
garments for the season. For your critical inspection we offer:
