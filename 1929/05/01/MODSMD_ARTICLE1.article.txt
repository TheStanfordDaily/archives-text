# FIRST CHANGE IN FARMING BILL IS MADE IN SENATE
## Norris Amendment Affecting Export Debenture Rates Is Adopted; No Record Vote Upper House Spends All Day Discusing Farm Relief in Hope of Reaching Decision 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 30. (/?)—'The
Farm Relief bill framed by the Senate
Agriculture Committee reached the
voting stage in the Senate today and
the first change made was by adop
tion of the Norris amendment affect
ing export debenture rates.
The decision on the amendment,
which would provide for a graduated
reduction of debenture rates when
ever an increase in production of de
bentureable products is forecast, was
not considered a test of sentiment for
the debenture plan itself. There was
no record vote.
Senator McNary, of Oregon, chair
man of the Agriculture committee,
previously had suggested that adop
tion of the Norris proposal even
though he is opposed to the deben
ture plan, on the theory that no harm
could be done by perfecting prospec
tive legislation.
Before reaching a vote on the Nor
ris amendment, the Senate put in a
full day discussing the farm bill with
die hope of reaching a final decia-ion
ou the debenture plan Thursday and
on (he farm bill itself by Friday night.
The debate brought new administra
tion senators into the fight to exclude
the plan opposed by President Hoover
and also caused a brief flurry over the
merits of the last campaign as a de
ciding factor in what the farmer
wanted in the way of farm relief.
Senator Sheppard, Democrat, Texas,
contended that President Hoover and
the Republican Party had failed to
keep their promises, asserting that
the pending farm bill fails to carry
out campaign pledges.
Senator Robinson, Republican, Indi
ana, denied that the bill fails to meet
the campaign pledges of Hoover and
contended the campaign had demon
strated that the Republican plan of
farm relief was more acceptable to
the country than the Democratic pro
gram.
