# NEW WATER SYSTEM ASSURES BUILDING OF CAMPUS GOLF LINKS
## Improvements at Felt Lake And Second Pipeline to Solve Difficulty 
### 
Stanford's proposed golf course has
become a reality with the availability
of a larger campus water supply. A1
Masters, general manager of the
Board of Athletic Control, has been
directed to notify Befl and Thomas,
| nationally known golf course archi
| tects, to start work immediately on
i the new links.
Increased demands on the Sears
j vilie Lake water supply brought about
jby the increased number of athletic
I fields and residences have necessi
| tated the operation of the 12-inch pipe
: line at a maximum capacity during the
J last two years.
In order to furnish the necessary
' increased supply, the University faced
: the alternatives of building another
I line to Searsville or of enlarging Felt
' Lake and laying a 12-inch main to
' that body of water. The Felt Lake
plan was decided upon by the Uni
! versity. F. A. Herrmann was engaged
i to prepare plans for the project.
The double water capacity created
| by the Felt Lake improvements will
j relieve the maximum operating ten
' sion and will furnish ample irrigation
j for the two nine-hole courses. The
Felt Lake pipe line will pass directly
through the site of one of the courses.
The enlargement of Felt Lake will
increase its storage capacity approxi
mately fifteen times. The storage
! space of this lake will then be almost
| equal to Searsville. Another advan
tage of the dual system of water lines
is that one branch can be closed and
thoroughly cleaned during the winter
months. This is not possible under
the present system.
An additional 2,800,000 gallons of
i water will be made available by the
i Felt Lake improvements.
