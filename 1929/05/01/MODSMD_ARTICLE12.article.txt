In the only intramural baseball
! game yesterday afternoon, Delta Up-
I silon upset the dope by winning a one
! sided contest from the A.T.O.'s. This
I was the winners' first victory of the
season, as they failed to put in an
appearance for their three previous
scheduled games.
Slugging out a home run with two
men on base in the third inning, Walt
Cooper started a five-run rally to pile
up an early lead and cinch the game
for the D.U.'s. Cooper also pitched a
good game, striking out fourteen bat
ters and holding the losers to five
scattered hits. Walt Wood twirled
j for the A.T.O.'s, and although he blew
!up in the third inning, he fanned
out twelve batters.
Besides catching a nice game of ball
Pete Heiser showed up well at bat,
getting two hits out of three trips to
the plate. Cooper was the heavy hit
ter of the day with three safe blows.
Both teams played a ragged fielding
game, though Greenfield looked good
on first base for Delta Upsilon.
Today's schedule is as follows: Bar
barians vs. Tlieta Chi on diamond 1,
Sigma Nu vs. Sequoia I on diamond
2, Theta Delts vs. Chi Psi on diamond
3, and Breakers vs. Phi Sigs on dia
mond 4.
