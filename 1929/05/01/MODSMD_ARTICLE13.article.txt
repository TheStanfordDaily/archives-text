Death Valley—vividly beautiful in
' its great expanse, hot, mysterious,
dangerous—is at last yielding its
secrets to science.
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder, who has de
voted years to the study of the famed
desert in the southwest, is helping
to reveal its past history, the story
j of the days when it was not a death
trap for travelers and prospectors,
but a habitable valley.
A lake, eighty miles long and four
miles wide, covered the bottom of the
valley. Streams poured into it from
the surrounding mountains. Grass

mantled the land, where now a fur
nace-like beat prevents its growth.
Trees could be found along the hill
sides. Not always did the valley cringe
under the terrific heat that prevails
there now. At one time, evidence
shows, the average temperature was
approximately twenty degrees lower.
No man ever laid eyes on this gar
den of nature, but animals roamed
through it, and fish swam in its rivers.
These fish, whose descendants are
found in the half-dry, trickling creeks,
have relatives in some of the south
western rivers of today.
Thousands of years ago—no one
knows exactly how long—the valley
underwent a great change. The lakes
and rivers dried up, leaving shriveled
streams in their place. The covering
of grass and trees disappeared. Then
Death Valley became a desert again.
The problem of the formation of
the valley has not yet been solved.
Whether a subterranean change sent
the surrounding hills higher into the
air, whether the center dropped down,
leaving the steep cliffs at its sides, or
whether the valley was hollowed out
by erosion of wind and water, is still
unknown.
But the fertile valley did disappear,
and in its place was the furnace of
sand, surrounded by sheer cliffs; in
these were exposed vast and valuable
mineral deposits. The gold found
there attracted the first prospectors,
but the rich deposits gave out. Other
prospectors joined the earlier ones —
the "desert rats," but turned their
efforts to seeking other minerals,
borax, salt, niter, filtering clay, all
demanded by modern industry.
Now geologists, among them Dr.
Blackwelder and his colleagues, turn
toward the Valley, seeking out its
past history.
This work is a special task under
taken by the Stanford department.
The department of geology here is

j engaged in a multitude of research
topics—earthquakes and tlieir possible
occurrence, stores of oil and natural
gas, and geologic surveys. Each sum
mer a group of seniors and graduates
in the department map out a district
covering several hundred square
miles. It is possible that these Stan
ford maps may eventually be incor
porated in the state survey.
