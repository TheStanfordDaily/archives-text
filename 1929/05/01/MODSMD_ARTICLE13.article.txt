Death Valley—vividly beautiful in
' its great expanse, hot, mysterious,
dangerous—is at last yielding its
secrets to science.
Dr. Eliot Blackwelder, who has de
voted years to the study of the famed
desert in the southwest, is helping
to reveal its past history, the story
j of the days when it was not a death
trap for travelers and prospectors,
but a habitable valley.
A lake, eighty miles long and four
miles wide, covered the bottom of the
valley. Streams poured into it from
the surrounding mountains. Grass

mantled the land, where now a fur
nace-like beat prevents its growth.
Trees could be found along the hill
sides. Not always did the valley cringe
under the terrific heat that prevails
there now. At one time, evidence
shows, the average temperature was
approximately twenty degrees lower.
No man ever laid eyes on this gar
den of nature, but animals roamed
through it, and fish swam in its rivers.
These fish, whose descendants are
found in the half-dry, trickling creeks,
have relatives in some of the south
western rivers of today.
Thousands of years ago—no one
knows exactly how long—the valley
underwent a great change. The lakes
and rivers dried up, leaving shriveled
streams in their place. The covering
of grass and trees disappeared. Then
Death Valley became a desert again.
The problem of the formation of
the valley has not yet been solved.
