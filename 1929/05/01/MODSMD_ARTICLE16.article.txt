# ELLSWORTH TALKS ON MILTON, JOHN BUNYAN IN ASSEMBLY LECTURE
## 
### 
"In John Bunyan and John Milton j
we have the two great authors of their i
times," said William W. Ellsworth in !
his lecture on "Milton, John Bunyan,
and Their Times" last night in the
Assembly Hall, and it is interesting
to note that both turned to the same
source for their eternal works â€”the
Bible."
Ellsworth gave a short resum6 of
the life of John Bunyan with numer- j
ous colored slides of his homes and
his wife. "Pilgrim's Progress" as the \
only real survival of Bunyan's work,
was the chief subject of his discus
sion ,and was accompanied by ex-;
ceedingly interesting slides from the
illustrations which were added to !
"Pilgrim's Progress" by the publisher, j
"Apropos of Bunyan's allegorical!
characters, Harold Bell Wright, the
modern novelist, reports that he car- j
ries his characters entirely through
his books under allegorical names,
and at the completion of the work, he
gives them real names," remarked
Ellsworth as he showed slides of
Vanity, Self-Esteem, Arrogance, and
others.
