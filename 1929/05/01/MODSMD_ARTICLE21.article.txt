# Off the Dime! Today's Labor Day
## 
### 
Labor Day!
Swinging axes, window washing, raking, shoveling carrying, cleaning,
stacking wood, weeding, a thousand hands will do work today enough to
boost the Convalescent Home through another year.
No one will be overly wearied with the work, for there will be many
to do it. Then after the good turns have been done, Sam, the all-Univer
sity, all-time champion barbecue king of the Pacific Coast and the South
easterly Archipelagoes, chef par excellence, will serve for the famished
multitude a feast, a steaming delcctable feast of barbecue with all the
fixings.
Here is Stanford's opportunity to give and to give of that which
costs little, time and energy. The Convalescent Home is one of the
finest institutions to which Stanford can point and say, "this is of our
doing."
Some classes have been excused, the weather is most favorable, all
arrangements have been made to provide good food and rousing enter
tainment, there is no excuse for not getting on the boat this afternoon
with the gang and pushing the job over the top in flying fashion.
It's Labor Day at Stanford. Get off the dime and on the boat.
