Midnight tonight decides the fate of the First Million for Stanford,
toward which alumni and benefactors of the University have been work
ing since the present endowment campaign was inaugurated after the
war.
All but $6,000 of the $700,000 pledged to be raised by Stanford has
been received. The Rockefeller Foundation is giving the University three
dollars for every seven it raises toward its First Million. So it is that
unless the round $700,000 is not in the hands of the University by mid
night tonight, the equally round $300,000 will not be forthcoming in its
pristine entirety from the Foundation, and in stead of a full, large First
Million, the University will have raised its First Million with a large
chunk missing.
In the President's Rej>ort of 1922, the following appears concerning
the First Million. "The First Million for Stanford is to provide an an
nual income of $40,000 to $50,000 to be added to the salary roll of the
faculties ordinarily embraced in the so-called College of Liberal Arts
and Sciences. This sum of money is to be spent annually in perpetuity
for brains, the one great distinguishing characteristic of universities."
That is its purpose. It speaks for itself.
