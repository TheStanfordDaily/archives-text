The following fashion note appeared in a San Francisco newspaper.
Alas, we shed a tear, to what depth has the sacred profession of journal
ism fallen that Stanford should be thus accused? But then this is news

must don a black suit and white shirt. The new fashion came from
nowhere and will probably disappear, sauntering leisurely in the
same direction. Hut for the time being, it's the thing.
"Probably another manifestation of the trend toward luxury
exemplified by the disappearance of the Lizzie and cutdown and
their replacement by better cars," coeds pointed out.
