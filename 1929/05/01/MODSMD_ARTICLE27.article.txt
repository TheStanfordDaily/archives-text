This Delicate Creature. By Con
O'Leary. (New York: Elliot Holt.
1929.)
Boda was young, beautiful — and
poor. So when a rich old fellow, that
has title as well as millions, turns
up, only one thing can happen. There
is another man of course, that she
really loveß, but since he is poor,
horribly poor, she sends him away.
It is all according to Hoyle.
Then, very boou after her marriage,
Boda decides that there is no need at
all for her to be inhibited by her
wealthy husband, whom a hopeless
adoration for his lovely bride has re
duced. to tame stupidity. She acquires
a string of worshippers with as little
time lost as possible—who are young
and fascinating like herself (also a la
Hoyle).
But her bid for happiness in this
manner proves a very unsuccessful
gesture. She flounders around for
awhile, trying to find some amuse
ment, and making herself, her hus
band, and everyone around her gener
ally miserable.
Finally, at one of her extraordinary
dinner parties, at which she entertains
archdeacons, saxophone champions,
jockeys, and acrobatic dancers, a cer
tain character turns up that gives the
book a new twist, and from a tire
some, mediocre beginning, it changes
to the most bizarre and fantastic story
imaginable.
This character is an explorer named
Crowfled who tells Boda about a pow
erful and sinister drug. "It is the leaf

of crysomena, a sort of slater-tree to
the lotus, and when chewed you go
into a deep drowse of memory, during
which you see a sort of inverted, de
spairful vision of your whole life. You
become all those whom you have in
jured, human and animal, you may
even change sex and species. The In
dians are mightily afraid of it; it is
used by them as a punishment; when
one of the tribe does wrong he is con
demned to eat Nirvabogoea. If I were
Home Secretary I would abolish jails
and introduce this drug. There would
be no more murders, no more wars,
no prostitution, no anger any more."
So Boda takes the drug, and is
everyone and everything she has ever
met and hurt or abused in her life.
(About her worst experience comes
from being her husband.) The whole
btory is absurd and extravagant—far
too much so with nothing apparently
too ludicrous or too incongruous for
the imagination of the author. The
book resembles dreams that people
have when they go to sleep on the
fatal combination of a bad conscience
and poorly timed dissipation.
Still to dismiss the book as a wholly
silly, trumped-up, Freudian affair, al
though this is close to the truth, is
not altogether a fair verdict. It is
sophisticated, and clever enough in
spite of everything, and even amusing.
It is certainly original and there are
flashes of quick diverting irony scat
tered through it. The general tone of
the book, however, is cheap.
