With spring in the air and mustard
seed in the hair there is nothing to
do but write verse. We know a certain
—but never mind, we won't discuss
that here. Always a keen observer of
Contemporary Comedy, the editor of
this department has been vastly
amused by Rushing Season. The re
sults remind us of the ridiculous story
of the Yukon miner who found a nug
get light near his tent. That is, he
thought it was a nugget, but it turned
out to be the frozen yolk of an egg.
So for the next coupla days, like it

VARIATIONS ON
FAVORITE THEMES
"I wish I wuz a little rock"
I wish I wuz a Phi Psi
A-seitin' on a hill
A-doin' nothing all day long
But jest a-settin' still
I wouldn't eat —I wouldn't sleep—
I wouldn't even study
I'd jest set there for three whole years
N'r speak t'anybuddy.
"I never saw a purple cow"
I never saw a purple robe
Nor ever hope to tree one —
But, judging by the Beta tong
I'd rather flee than see one.
Verse: "Son of a Gambolier"
Oh there's a road to Menlo
As plain as plain can be
And if you see a Kappa Sig
Returning from a spree
Please gently roll him over
From out the right of way
Protect his brass from cars that pass—
Kind manners always pay.
"Madamoiselle from Armentieres"
The Y.M.C.A. went down into hell,
parley voo
The Y.M.C.A. went down into hell,
parley voo
The Y.M.C.A. went down into hell
To form a branch of the A.K.L.
Hinky dinky parley voo.
