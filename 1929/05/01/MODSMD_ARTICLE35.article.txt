# Honor Violator Refused Registration By Council
## 
### 
After reconsidering the evidence in
the case the Men's Council yesterday
afternoon decided to refuse admit
tance to a student convisted of vio
lating the Honor Code. The Council
had previously cancelled the registra
tion of the student in question, giving
him permission to register next fall
quarter. He applied for permission to
register for the summer quarter, with
the result given. Another Honor Code
violator was sentenced to immediate
cancellation of his registration, with
permission to register again next fall.
As usual a number of fines were
assessed against traffic offenders at
the meeting.
