# SPORTS OF 1929
## Barnes Belts 'Em 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
England's "Woolworth Building,"
James C. Barnes, otherwise known as
"Long Jim," is after that British open
Cup again, and why not —hasn't he
been present every year since 1914?
(No tournaments were held from 1915
to 1919, inclusive.) And, it might be
added, "Long has been not only
present, but also accounted for, every
year but one, 1923, when he failed to
qualify by a single stroke.
Although in ten tries for the British I
open championship, Barnes has ;
achieved victory only once —in 1925 — j
hope springs eternal, and he may re- I
peat that performance one of these j
days. In all his trips around the wind- j
sv-ept dunes and fairways of England j

and Scotland, Jim has yet to finish
with a score of less than 300. Three
times he finished with a score fo 301,
and tied for second, fifth, and eighth
in so doing. Bobby Jones' 285, made in
1927, is the record for this historic
tournament.

! American winning the British open
i championship. Yet Jim Barnes, an
i Englishman, won our United States
| open title in 1921. I guess we've come
! to look upon "Long Jim" as an Ameri
can. He came to this country in his ;
teens, and first made himself known in ;
a golfing way by winning the Western
, open title in 1914. He was Profession
al Golfers' Association champion in
1916 and 1919.
