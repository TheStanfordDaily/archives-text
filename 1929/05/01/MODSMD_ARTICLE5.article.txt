# Engineering Society Plans To Send Men To Germany
## 
### 
A plan whereby members of student
chapters of the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers may spend
part of their college years studying
shop and manufacturing methods in
Germany is being sponsored this year
by the A.S.M.E. The German Mechan
ical Engineers Society is co-operating
with the American Society in sending
these student engineers abroad.
Since 1925 many German student 3
have been coming to this country c.rd
entering the large manufacturing
plans to study methods of manufac
ture and design. In this plan of stu
dent exchange it was agreed that the
German Societies would choose the
students to study in this country and
the American Engineers would llnd
positions for them.
According to Professor Domonoske
of the Mechanical Engineering School
this plan has both advantages and dis
advantages for the prospective en
gineer. Its advantages lie in the cp
portunlty to travel, to study new
methods of designing machinery, and
to come in contact with a new people
and understand their way of thinking
and living.
The disadvantages of the plan are
that some German methods are not
equal to ours since their industrial
development, has not been nearly so
rapid. Then too, German wages are
not so high as ours, and since work
is the only means of providing a liv
ing while abroad it follows that money
is a necessary item before this plan
can be followed.
