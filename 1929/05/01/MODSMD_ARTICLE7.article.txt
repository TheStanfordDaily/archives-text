# WASHINGTON, ENGLAND MAY DECIDE ON ARMS REDUCTION
## Naval Experts May Get Together for Examination of the American Proposal for More Equivalent Tonnage 
### 
GENEVA, April 30. (yP) —Washing-
ton and not Geneva will decide the
next concrete step In reduction of
naval armaments if the prevailing im
pression here is in accord with facts.
The White House, the Washington
State Department, and Downing
Street are believed to be agreed that
a preliminary agreement between the
United States and Great Britain on
general lines is wise before there are
further public naval discussions at the
preliminary disarmament conference
here.
Failure of the Tripartite Naval Pact
is held up as a warning that there
must be no further collapse as a re
sult of lack of suitable preparations.
One or more of the delegations
would like all the naval experts to
get together for an examination of the
American proposal for tackling the
naval problem through guesses of
equivalent tonnage. Perhaps even such
conversations will be adjourned until
the viewpoints of London and Wash
ington have been brought together
close enough to eliminate all proba
bility of a misunderstanding.

It is believed that if Great Britain
and the United States are in substan
tial accord on naval matters, the dele
gations can go forward more confi
dently.
Present opinion is to the effect that
naval reductions will not be discussed
until the next session of the prepara
tory commission, which the majority
of delegates hope will not be con
voked until autumn.
This would give an opportunity to
all the nations with big narvies to
sciutinize and weigh the American
suggestions. Tokyo will want time to
study them at leisure, and France and
Italy must think of equivalent values
of tonnage not only in relation to each
other, but also with reference to their
neighbor, Spain.
The smaller countries with modest
fleets are beginning to wonder when
they will be invited to climb aboard
the band-wagon of naval reductions
and naval formulas.
Jugoslavia, for instance, is showing
a lively interest in whether the Ameri
can principles would also apply to her
r.aval forces.
