# "MOVING ON" MUSIC FEATURES AMBITIOUS NUMBERS IN VARIETY
## Work of Spaulding, Robinson, Williams, Starbird to Be on Program 
### 
In respect to its music, "Moving
On," the Junior Opera to be presented
on the campus May 11, is the most
ambitious musical comedy ever pro
duced at Stanford. Ten songs will be
featured in the show, and they will
run the gamut all the way from typi
cal opening numbers to sentimental
waltz songs, with banjo and chorus
variations. In addition there will be
several specialty numbers in the way
of tap dancing, harmony singing, and
a black-face number.
"Moving On," the theme jazz song
of the operetta, was composed by
Neal Spaulding. Written in futuristic
rhythm, it is somewhat like the
"Rhythmic Garbage" which was popu
lar in the "Theatre Fund Follies."
The words were written by Bill Rob
inson.
The theme love song of the comedy
is "Our Love Is Tangled in Moon
beams," which is a waltz with a catchy
melody written by Griffith Williams.
"A Cloud Passed Over the Moon," an
other waltz, but of the broken-hearted
variety, is also by Williams, with
words by George Starbird.
"Circus Days" is a typical opener
to a show of this kind â€”peppy, and a
catchy tune. Spaulding wrote the
music and Starbird the words. "Stop
Thief, You Stole My Heart Away" is
a i'ox-trot composed by the same cou
ple. Another fox-trot is "The Reason
Why," by Spaulding and Robinson.
One of the hits of the show should
be the "Tent Song," written by Wil
liams. This has been set to four-part
harmony for men's voices. "Living i:i
a Tent," which will be sung by a
tenor with harmony carried by the
men's chorus, has an Oriental flavor,
which will be carried out. by the dance
by the women's chorus. This was
composed by Williams and Starbird.
The "Superstition Song," a comedy
number with music and lyric by Star
bird, will be a solo number sung by
Hubbard Moffit. Another comedy num
ber is "Those Funny People," in which
Williams and Starbird poke fan at the
circus freaks.
