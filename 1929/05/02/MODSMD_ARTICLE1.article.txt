# SENATE LEADERS DEBATE FARMING BILL PROBLEMS
## Political Party Chiefs Hold Lively Discussion on Past, Present Views Toward Fee Crowded Galleries Hear Two Veterans Hurl Questions, Charges Back and Forth 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 1 (/P).—
Crowded Senate galleries today enjoyed
the unusual spectacle of a spirited de
bate between the floor leaders of the two
major political parties as Senator Wat
son, the Indiana Republican, and Senator
Robinson, the Arkansas Democrat, dis
cussed their past and present attitudes to
ward the equalization fee in farm relief
legislation.
Recent verbal exchanges on the latest
vehicle for dispute over agricultural re
lief—the export debenture plan—were
overshadowed by the pungent but good
humored colloquy. On their feet for
nearly two hours, the two leaders hurled
questions and charges back and forth
while the gallery throngs leaned forward
to listen and occasionally laughed at
some pointed remark.
After the debate had subsided some
what, Robinson looked toward his oppo
nent and asserted with a smile that he
hoped "my distinguished friend will soon
terminate his tirade and come to lunch
eon with me."
The set-to occurred as Watson under
took to reply to a recent assertion by the
Arkansas Senator that Republican farm
leaders had deserted the equalization fee
lor political expediency. Robinson him
self, the Indianan declared, once voted
against the equalization fee after describ
ing it as a "tax" levied without the con
sent of the person against whom it was
to be assessed.
Another defense of President Hoo
ver's farm views was made by Senator
Fess, Republican, of Ohio, who said there
was nothing to show that the farm bill
passed by the House differed in a single
instance from the expressions on farm
relief made by the President during the
campaign.
An amendment to the farm bill was of
fered by Senator McNary of Oregon,
chairman of the Agriculture Committee,
to eliminate fruits and vegetables from
the operation of the bill. The Senator
said he did this because the fruit and
vegetable organizations did not desire to
be affected. They also asked to be elimi
nated from the operation of the equaliza
tion fee when the McNary-Haugen bill
was before Congress and their request
was met.
