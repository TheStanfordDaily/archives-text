# TRACK SQUAD TO ENTER PACIFIC A. A. U. MEET
## Cards Will Again Meet U.C., Olympic Club in Kezar Contest Saturday 
### Frank Whiteley 
Dink Templeton's track and field
men, undefeated in collegiate dual
meet competition in the last three
years, will again compete for honors
in the annual meet of the Pacific As
sociation of the American Athletic
Union when they appear in the 1929
P.A.A.A.U. championships In the
Kezar Stadium at San Francisco Sat
urday. Templeton is entering a com
plete team, and more than three Cards
will compete in some events. The meet
will officially start at 2 o'clock, al
though the hammer throw will begin
at 12:30 o'clock and the five-mile run
at 1 o'clock.
Besides the regular program of four
teen events in which the Cards have
been competing this year, there will
be three additional field events and
one extra track event. The five-mile
run, the 16-pound hammer throw, the
SG-lb. weight throw, and the hop-skip
and jump will be the added events. No
mile relay will be run.
Competition Keen
Team competition will be keen, with
the Olympic Club, the University of
California, the Young Men's Institute,
and several small colleges entered.
"Casey" Kazanjian is Stanford's
hope in the hammer and 56-pound
weight throws. He has thrown the
former 145 feet and the latter more
than 35 feet. His principal opponent
will probably be Jack Merchant of the
Olympic Club, veteran Olympic Games
.star.
Hec Dyer, by right of his placing
ahead of Russ Sweet of the Olympic
Club at Fresno last Saturday, is fa
vored to win the century from the
Olympic Club sprinter at Kezar. Mc-
Dermott and Lauritzen of the Cards;
Frank Lombardi, Stanford freshman;
and Kizel, prep school flash who won
the 200-meter American Olympic trials
last year, will be on hand to make
Dyer step. Either Kizel or Lombardi
is a likely winner.
Eric Krenz and Harlow Rothert will
be there to put the shot and throw
the discus, and what competition there
is in these events will be furnished by
the two Stanford men. Krenz was a
trifle off form at Fresno, and for the
first time this year failed to better
150 feet in the discus.
A Battle of Spears
In the javelin Curtice and Churchill
of California will again meet Sparling,
Kibby, and Perelli-Minetti of Stan
ford; and an interesting battle for the
points should develop. The first four
have thrown farther than 200 feet in
competition, and Perelli-Minetti has
done 198 feet.
Captain Ross Nichols and Rogers
Smith of the Cards will be matched
against Hawley and Leistner of the
Club.
