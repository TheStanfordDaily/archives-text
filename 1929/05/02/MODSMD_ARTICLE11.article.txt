## Rioters Erect Barricades in Main Thoroughfare of The Pankstrasse 
### 
BERLIN, May 1 (,/P). â€”Serious rioting
broke out tonight in the working class
quarter in northern Berlin. Three po
licemen were reported killed and more
than a score injured. More than 500 po
lice late tonight were fighting nearly 3,000
communists armed with pistols, clubs,
and stones.
The rioters erected barricades in the
main thoroughfare of the Pankstrasse
and its side streets. The police charged
them repeatedly with batons until the
commanding officer realized that his force
was too weak for these tactics and or
dered his men to open fire. Then ar
mored cars were brought up and the
police finally captured the barricades.
Communist ambulances and first aid
squads were overwhelmed by the num
ber of victims brought from the fighting
front.
Fighting was also reported from east
ern and southeastern parts of the city.
Those sections were plunged into dark
ness.
The Pankstrasse and the Poesliner
strassc were under repair and a quantity
of paving material, including blocks, was
lying about. The communists erected
barricades from this material and from
behind them received the police with pis
tol and rifle volleys.
Shots were fired also from windows
of nearby houses and when the armored
cars arrived their searchlights were
turned upon those vantage points and the
rioters were quickly driven from them
by well directed police fire. The houses
were invaded after the police had
stormed and carried the barricades and
many of the sharpshooters were found
and arrested.
