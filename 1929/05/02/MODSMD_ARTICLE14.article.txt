When the last weary btaniord student |
had departed last night, and the fires of I
the barbecue were cold, it was a "spic
and span" and startlingly clean Convales
cent Home that stood out against the
dark blue sky. Labor Day was over; !
Stanford had performed its task, and j
done it well.
Trees and stumps that had been a part j
of the morning scene were no more, and j
many weeds that had been cluttering up :
gardens had disappeared. Eight cords of
wood had been placcd in the basement of
the McLaughlin building, and five more
were in the Babcock unit. It was a great I'
day for work and play and Stanford I
spirit.
"We are standing on the playground of i
Leland Stanford, Jr.," said Dr. D. j
Charles Gardner, standing among the!
pieces of lath and timber which are being ]
used in the newest and fourth unit to the
Home. Hundreds of students were gath
ered around the chaplain to hear the dedi
cation ceremonies of the Auxiliary build
ing and to watch Mrs. G. B. Culver lay
the cornerstone "in the name of charity 1
which is love."
"We arc grateful to the students for
this Labor Day," continued the chaplain,"
and we are grateful for their contri

butions to the maintenance of the Home."
Mrs. Newell Bullock then gave a short
history of the Home and emphasized the
fact that it had not lost the "Home"
spirit, despite its increasing size.
The barbecue followed the dedication,
and many hundred students rushed to the
lines around the barbecue pit. The food
supply was handled admirably, and there
was quick service for everyone. All the
food for Labor Day was donated by the
various living groups on the campus.
The Board of Athletic Control contrib
uted a part of the meat.
Entertainment de luxe was provided by
the Dramatic Council following the bar
becue. Seven spicy varieties of radio acts
wCte given, and each proved more hi
larious than the former. Hal Conroy and
Paul Speegle would probably be funny
in reciting a list of dates.
A1 Cass kept the show rollicking along
in high merriment and added immeasur
ably with his quips and pranks. The
music trio proved a happy find, and Fred
Pearman showed that he had rhythm in
his toes. Virginia Moulton and Kather
inc Crane lent a tantalizing "blue" air
to the performance, and IXL certainly
lived up to its name.
The work at the Home was very ef
ficiently managed by Bentiie Craft and
his committees,
