# LAW STUDENTS WILL DEBATE MOOT COURT FINALS; $200 PRIZE
## 
### 
Call and Armour will meet Draper
and Vincenti in the final round of the j
annual Moot Court tournament at 8 j
o'clock in Room 12 of the Law build- j
ing. The case tried will be discussion j
on the question: "Does the 1923 1
amendment to the California Consti
tution concerning community propor- !
ty affect the rights of the wife to!
property acquired after 1923?"
The case will be conducted as a
regular trial in court, and will be on
a point of law as yet untried in Cali
fornia. The Moot Court Hoard could
not secure the services of active Su
preme Court justices because the Su
preme bench will be called upon to
decide a similar case soon, and as a !
consequence, the Board has secured I
former Supreme Court Justice Charles i
A. Shurtleff and Frank M. Angelotti, 1
and Henry Monroe, who is chief couti-!
sel for the California Title Insurance j
Company, to act as a bench of three !
judges for the case.

Charles Eells, a retired attorney of
Carmel, has offered a prize of $200
to the winners of the case, while the
losers will each receive a set of Pro
fessor Owens' Form Books which
were donated by Professor Owens and
the Stanford Law Association.

The Stanford Law Association will
hold a banquet at 6:30 preceding the
trial. At the banquet, the names of
the newly elected members of the
Order of the Coif, an honorary law

society, will be announced. The
Order of the Coif is composed of law
students who are in the upper five per
cent of their classes in grades.
