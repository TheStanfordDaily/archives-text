# FORMER RECORD IS BROKEN AS HOI DRIVE NETS OVER $2,809
## Final Total Expected to Exceed $3,000 Mark; Merchants of Palo Alto Contribute to Fund; Sororities and Men's Halls Lead in Donations 
### 
Stanford's charity record cracked last night when the first reports from the
Convalescent Home Drive indicated that the fund to date was $2,809.91. This is the
preliminary report from treasurers in various living groups and does not mean
the final sum. Many groups have not been heard from, and several of the totals
are incomplete. The Drive last year came to $2,800.
Palo Alto's merchants have donated a fair share to the campaign fund. The
benefit vaudeville at the Varsity Theatre last Monday night when three Stanford
acts were presented added $50 to the Drive. The concessions at Labor Day yesterday
yielded $102.68 for Stanford's charity. The candies and orange juice sold yesterday
were donated to the Home by the Goblin Orange Juice Company, the Nipa Hut
and the Peninsula Creamery Company.

Incomplete returns from the men's
halls by Irwin Warner show a donation
jof $611, while Roble's contribution will
j come between $450 and $500 according
Jto Peggy Mudgett.
( The tag day sale which was carried
jon Monday and Tuesday in Palo Alto
jby Harriet Huntingdon's committee net
ted a sum of $54. Incomplete informa
tion from the fraternities reveal dona
tions amounting to $500. Compared to

'on the Row. From the faculty comes a
contribution of approximately $200.
