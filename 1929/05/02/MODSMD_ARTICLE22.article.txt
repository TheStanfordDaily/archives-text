# A 						Thirty-Eight Year Wait
## 
### 
Thirty-eight years ago the University erected what it then termed a
"temporary structure" to be used as a gymnasium for the Five Hundred.
The "temporary structure," a bit moth-eaten but still in one piece, is still
being used as a gymnasium for the Five Hundred.
Constant effort to obtain a suitable building on the part of the women
and those interested in the project has accomplished little or nothing.
Plans, containing a statement of the needs of the women, a floor plan
elevation of the proposed building, its cost, and a method of financing it
have been placed before the Board of Athletic Control at the request of
that organization. The plans were submitted at the end of fall quarter.
The Board of Athletic Control, after Board of Trustee fashion, has re
ferred the plans to two of its various committees and action waits upon
these committees.

That the Board of Athletic Control should do something toward con
structing a women's gymnasium cannot be doubted, but what of the
University itself?
Who built the men's gymnasium?
The University invested $110,000 in that structure. Has it no re
sponsibility in this matter of providing suitable quarters for the women?
In thirty-eight years it certainly could have shelled out a dollar or two
toward this necessary building.
The Board of Athletic Control has an expansive program of building
outlined for the immediate future. Perhaps there are items on that pro
gram that could wait five, ten, or even thirty-eight years to be built, and
let the money l>e used for the women's gymnasium.
The cost of the proposed gymnasium has been estimated at $300,000.
The plan is to amortize this through funds from the Board of Athletic
Control at the rate of $30,000 yearly, the Board carrying the interest on
the unpaid principal.
The University waits on the Board of Athlctic Control, the Board of
Athletic Control waits on the University and its committees, the women
wait on both and get nowhere fast.
Whether the University and the Board of Athletic Control can get
together and agree to put up the money or whether one of them does it
alone makes little difference, it is something that has waited just about
long enough.
Everything comes to him who waits, but after all thirty-eight years is
quite a space to sit and wait for anything, even a women's gymnasium.
