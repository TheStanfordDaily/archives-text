# Sidelights on Labor Day..
## 
### 
It was a big day at the Stanford j
Convalescent Home yesterday. It can j
be justly termed one of Stanford's
biggest athletic and social events. It
was both, plus a demonstration of
charity. We saw no news reel photo- !
graphers on duty, but long before the !
day was over, it was evident that their j
absence from the Home yesterday was
their own loss; if there ever was an
event of news interest it was the
sight of seeing more than a thousand
students combining their efforts to
do a year's work in one afternoon.
It was a case of "everybody do
something." The strong men bared
themselves to the waist, felled
trees and split logs. Others cut
lawns, raked fields, dug gardens,
hauled wood, repaired toys or
trimmed plants. Girls washed win
dows, or sold candy, ice crerm,
smokes, and orangeade.
Twenty-four little Stanford lambs
willingly followed the slogan, "Give
till it hurts." They gave their all and
thus provided 900 pounds of roast
meat for the workers. Sam McDonald, |
chief chef of the barbecue each year,
was on duty early preparing food for ;
1,300 hungry people.
I)r. Gardner was all smiles yester
day. He is ono of the many outstand
ing individuals who is present at
Labor Day functions every year.
If O. O. Mclntyre were present
he might have made the following
notations of Impressions:
A sultry day. Everyone is per-

spiring .... The clatter of trac
tors and the slashing thud of axes
does not cease .... Fords and
Chevrolets are parked everywhere
about the grounds. Packards and
LaSalles, too. . . . Not only fresh
men are staring sadly at big blis
ters on their hands Nearly
all the co-eds are without stock
ings. How do they manage to get
so tan this early in the year?
Perhaps sorority house roofs help.
. . . . Spring has asserted itself
at last The orangeade girls
are adept at pouring from a jug
slung carelessly over an elbow.
. . . . Girls are having little trou
ble selling smokes and refresh
ments. It's not all on the merit of
the commodities. Nor the demand.
. . . . Perry Taylor proving that
he can split a log in one stroke.
. . . . Occasional slackers holding
down the grass under shade trees.
. . . . Officer Olsen working up an
appetite as the aroma arises from
the barbecue pit ..A few
freshmen depriving the kiddies of
their swings and teeters for a few
minutes The band makes
up for its absence at the Big Meet.

It was a big day at the Stanford j
Convalescent Home yesterday. It can j
be justly termed one of Stanford's
biggest athletic and social events. It
was both, plus a demonstration of
charity. We saw no news reel photo- !
graphers on duty, but long before the !
day was over, it was evident that their j
absence from the Home yesterday was
their own loss; if there ever was an
event of news interest it was the
sight of seeing more than a thousand
students combining their efforts to
do a year's work in one afternoon.
It was a case of "everybody do
something." The strong men bared
themselves to the waist, felled
trees and split logs. Others cut
lawns, raked fields, dug gardens,
hauled wood, repaired toys or
trimmed plants. Girls washed win
dows, or sold candy, ice crerm,
smokes, and orangeade.
Twenty-four little Stanford lambs
willingly followed the slogan, "Give
till it hurts." They gave their all and
thus provided 900 pounds of roast
meat for the workers. Sam McDonald, |
chief chef of the barbecue each year,
was on duty early preparing food for ;
1,300 hungry people.
I)r. Gardner was all smiles yester
day. He is ono of the many outstand
ing individuals who is present at
Labor Day functions every year.
If O. O. Mclntyre were present
he might have made the following
notations of Impressions:
A sultry day. Everyone is per-

spiring .... The clatter of trac
tors and the slashing thud of axes
does not cease .... Fords and
Chevrolets are parked everywhere
about the grounds. Packards and
LaSalles, too. . . . Not only fresh
men are staring sadly at big blis
ters on their hands Nearly
all the co-eds are without stock
ings. How do they manage to get
so tan this early in the year?
Perhaps sorority house roofs help.
. . . . Spring has asserted itself
at last The orangeade girls
are adept at pouring from a jug
slung carelessly over an elbow.
. . . . Girls are having little trou
ble selling smokes and refresh
ments. It's not all on the merit of
the commodities. Nor the demand.
