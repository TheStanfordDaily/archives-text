A Young People. By Hans Kinck.
(New York: E. P. Dutton. 1929.)
"A Young People," the first book
of the Norwegian writer, Hans Klnck,
to be translated into English, is a
story symbolic of the political youth
of the Norwegian people at the time
of their uprising against the rule of
Sweden.
It <;pens in a village school-room
with the master catechising the young
sters about suicide. The subject was
painful to Sjurd Bjorntveit, "a broad
shouldered lad with prominent cheek
bones, a low forehead and freckles,"
because his father had recently hung
himself from a rafter in a barn bel
onging to Jens Teigland's father.
Sjurd angrily refused to give the an
swers demanded of him; but Jens
answered as glibly as if the boy who
shared his seat were not suffering
keenly over the proceedings. "Only
God who has given us life, has a right
to take it, and since the suicide ends
his life with a sin, he naturally puts
himself in peril of eternal damnation."
This was the beginning of a hos
tility between the two boys that lasted
ali their lives and affected everything
they did. Jens was physically frail,
fanciful, affectionate, social, religious
and self-seeking. Sjurd was hardy,
anti-social, irreligious, grasping, cruel
and self-seeking. Each aspired to be
a leader: Jens, apparently because
his religious instinct led him to seek
the welfare of his people; Sjurd, ap
parently because he strove to com
pensate for the inferiority and humili
ation seared into his boyhood. Jens
went away to school, lost the dialect
of his people, learned to make effec
tive speeches and to organize his
plans. Sjurd worked in his dead fath
er's place, arranged a shrewd remorse
less coup by which he transformed
himself from a poverty-stricken farm
er into a well-to-do merchant, soon
had half the men of the community in
his debt, and became a local power.
Jens was a liberal because it seemed
to him that the liberals would free

his people. Sjurd shifted according to
his personal advantage.

To begin with most people favored
Ttigland's plans; but he was not able
to take as high a hand with Sjurd as
he wished, because Sjurd knew that
Jens, in spite of his prayers and
idealism, was habitually misappropri
ating public funds. They attacked each
other violently in public on general
principles, but each remained pru
dently silent as to concrete evidences
of the other's malfeasance. Hostile as
they were, they were bound together
in villainy; just as they were also
bound together by their really pas
sionate love of their country. Their
numerous clashes, their schemes and
counter schemes make a story as
turbulent as the political epoch they
epitomize.

I imagine that a Norwegian reader
will have the same ambiguous but un
questioned pleasure in identifying all
the details of this acid etching of his
local scene that an American reader
has In Babbitt; and I imagine that "A
Ycung People" is the same sort of
ruthless caricature that Babbitt is.
None, except a degenerate community,
is ever quite so thoroughly given tip
to heartless speculations as this Nor
degian village seems to be. Even
under every pressure to betray oneself,
pressure as great, let us say, as the
late war hysteria, honest men rise
up in every hamlet and cross-roads
to speak the truth. Yet caricatures
have a truth of their own, if we re
member their nature, and, stranger
as I am to Norwegian customs and
characteristics, this story yet seems
to me to have all the savage and dis
arming earmarks of that disturbing
quality. Fortunately there are compe
tent witnesses to its versimilitude.
Kinck has been highly praised by
Georg Braiules, by Thomas Mann, and
by an impressive array of distinguish
ed European writers. In form this
story of the 80's seems to have an
ticipated many of the devices of ex
pressionism.
