"The Grand Old Duke of York"
The Grand Old D.K.E.'s
Pledged half a dozen men
They drove them up to 'Frisco
And drove them home again
And though they weren't so tight
they weren't sober
And though hardly sober, not tight
Arid though they were neither bright
nor dumb
Tlicy were neither dumb nor bright.
"Rose Kissed Me Today"
Zetes pledged me today—
Will they keep me tomorrow?
Though the hashing helps pay
My Crest's forged—ln a way
This will cause them to sorrow.
Zetes pledged me today—
WILL they keep me tomorrow?
The Limerick —
A rising young sophomore D.U.
Said "Hell, I have nothing to do —
Beside going to school —
But to scrub out the pool
And help trim the hedge for the view."
"There was a man from our town"
There was a man in our class
And he was wondrous wise
He staggered up the Row one day
And joined the Sigma Chi's
And when he heard what he had done
He cried "Gawd, what a break!"
He staggered down the Row again
And jumped into the lake.
