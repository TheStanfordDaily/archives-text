# STANFORD SMOKERS TO INDULGE IN NEW AMERICAN PASTIME
## 
### 
Members of Stanford fraterni
ties and eating clubs and diners in
Encina Commons will be introduced
for the first time to that new and
increasingly popular national pas
time, the blindfold test, when rep
resentatives of the Daily will be
sent out this noon to conduct the
test in an effort to determine the
most popular cigarette on the cam
pus.
Four of the best known brands
will be used, the trade mark of each
being covered by a black band. The
brands will be numbered and the
smoker is to rate the cigarettes by
number. The same test has been
conducted in several other colleges
throughout the country during the
past few months.
