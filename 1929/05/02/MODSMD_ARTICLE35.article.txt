# STUDENTS URGED TO TAKE SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR "QUAD" AT ONCE
## 
### 
"There arc only a few Quads left, and
there will be absolutely no last-minute
reduced sales as of former years," said
Homer Craig, manager of the 1929 Quad,
â– yesterday. "Subscriptions may be obtained
from the office or any managerial try
oiitcc, and anyone living in Palo Alto or
vicinity may phone the office any after
noon between 1 and 2 o'clock and a sales
man will be sent out to get the subscrip
tion."
About 75 per cent of the book has been
scut to the printers. One of the special
feaures of this year's Quad will be two
layouts concerning Herbert Hoover and
containing a drawing of Hoover and a
personal statement from him. With the
Hoover addition, it is considered that the
Quad will be a valuable permanent addi
tion to anyone's personal library.
At present the San Francisco engrav
ers arc striking for higher wages and
shorter hours, and this may tic up the
book and delay its publication. The book
will have approximately 500 pages as in
other years.
