# Junior Opera Sets To Portray Circus Days And "Big Top" Scenes
## 
### 
This way, ladies and gentlemen—this
way. Hear them sing—see them dance—
all in the big show, "Moving On," to be
given May 11. There are freaks—there
are animals (offstage)—there's a hero
AND a heroine—all in the Big Top now
going up in the Assembly Hall under the
direction of Harold Helvenston.
Five sets are being built by Helven
ston and his stage crew for the Junior
Opera, and they range from one done in
the manner of the Chauvc Souris to
those in the realistic mood of an Ameri
can circus. Act one, the locale of which
is an obscure corner of the lot, not only
immediately catches the musical comedy
mood of the show, but also suggests the
pick-'em-up-and-lay-'em-down a t m o s
phere of a circus.
In scene one of the second act, the cook
tent is designed to show off the freaks
who rest here during their intermissions
from the Midway routine. The second
scene of the same act is one of the show's
high spots. It is the exterior of Zuzu's
(the villainess) circus wagon reproduced
in all its gaudy colors and flashing gilt.
Helvenston's technique in this setting is
interesting, for he has managed to sug
gest the spirit of the whole by merely
showing a part of the wagon.

Act three, scene one—the Barker's
backdrop—is the most colorful set of the
entire show. Done in a kaleidoscopic
manner, it is reminiscent of the Rus
sian stylists, and catches the spirit of the
gay Midway, with its noise, life, and
weird freaks. Then in the last scene,
the entrance to the Big Top, the stage
is cluttered with paraphernalia scattered
around during the demolition of the cir
cus preparatory to moving on.
Helvenston's task in creating settings
for this Junior Opera has been excep
tionally difficult, for an unusually large
cast—close to seventy people are at times
on the stage—makes it necessary for the
sets to occupy a minimum of space. At
the same time, he has had to create a feel
ing of the space and roominess which
exists on an actual circus lot.
