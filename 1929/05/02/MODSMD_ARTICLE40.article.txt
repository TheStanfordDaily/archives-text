### 
SAN BERNARDINO, Cal., May 1.
(/P) â€”A forest fire stirred up by a
strong north wind which fanned into
flames coals left from the burning of
a fire break, today swept over valu
able timber lands in Day Canyon in
the San Gabriel mountains, west of
here, and was said by rangers to be
out of control after burning 325 acres.
A wealthy marble-dealer in New
York was crushed to death in his own
monument works.
