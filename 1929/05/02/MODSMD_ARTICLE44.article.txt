# THOMPSON DISCUSSES THE SEVEN DICTATORS OF EUROPEAN NATIONS
## Multiple Party Systems and Readjustment Need Are Principal Causes 
### Theodore DeMotte 
"Europe's need of readjustment im
mediately after the war and the multiple
party systems are the principal causes of
the prevalence of dictatorships through
out Europe." Walter Thompson, associ
ate professor of Political Science, was
discussing the numerous dictatorships ex
isting at present in Europe.
European nations needed some quick
action on a number of financial and eco
nomic problems just after the World
War," Thompson continued, "and many
of the countries found that the parlia
mentary systems were too cumbersome to
deal with the work rapidly enough. When
strong men appeared, the legislative bod
ies were glad to give the power over to
them in order to get action. The multiple
party systems on the continent necessi
tated coalitions of factions for almost
every measure passed, with the result that
legislation was terribly congested. The
time was ripe for dictatorships, and it is
not surprising that they came.
Democracy Inefficient
"It is a fact that democratic govern
ments are notoriously inefficient, much
more so than the old "benevolent despo
tisms" of Frederick the Great and of
pre-war Germany. When countries need
ed efficiency as badly as did the European
nations after the war, dictatorships were
the solutions of the problems. Also the
people were accustomed to obeying orders
after the war, and the change from war
to peace dictatorships was not great.
"The city manager and commission
forms of city government are similar to
the governments set up in many of the
countries of Europe. The commission
form of government in America started
with the Galveston disaster, when an
emergency demanded efficiency in man
agement. People are naturally inclined
to say, 'If dictatorial governments are
best in times of great emergencies, why
not try them when things are normal ?' "
Activities Curtailed
Democracy's only justification for ex
istence, in the opinion of Professor
Thompson, is the fact that it satisfies the
people, and that people will stand for a
curtailment of activities under a demo
cratic government that they would not
accept from a dictator.
The fact that France, with its highly
developed multiple party system and its
serious reconstruction problems, has not
gone into the ranks of the dictator-con
trollcd countries is probably due to that
country's disastrous experience with Na
poleon 111, which resulted in the defeat
in 1870, according to Professor Thomp
son.
At present, seven regular dictatorships
exist in Europe: in Russia, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Poland, Turkey, and Jugosla
via. Roumania, Czecho-Slovakia, Alba
nia, and Lithuania either have had, or are
considering, dictatorial governments.
Russia and Italy have the most firmly
established dictatorships, in which the
dictators keep the power by military
means, and where they are attempting to
perpetuate the dictator idea by means of
education; in Italy by means of the
young Fascist group started by Musso
lini, and in Russia by means of training
in the public schools.
Professor Thompson believes that with

the exception of Italy and Russia, the J
dictatorships will probably disappear j
| without upheavals when they have served '
j their purposes. In Italy and Russia, |
| trouble will probably result before the j
: dictators are removed from power. In'
I Spain, the people seem willing for Primo
de Rivera, present dictator, to continue
i in power, but he wishes to resign because
| of his advancing years.
j Opposed to the prevalence of dictator- !
I ships in Europe, Professor Thompson j
pointed out the wave of democracy that'
| is sweeping the Orient, especially China !
and Japan. As the greatest problem in [
the question of dictatorships, he sees the !
! problem of successors to such men as j
Mussolini. Dictators, he says, are not in :
the habit of building up strong men to
succeed them, for fear of a loss of j
i power. When a dictator goes, there is
I no man to take his place, and the result
Sis confusion and often revolution.

Democracy Inefficient
"It is a fact that democratic govern
ments are notoriously inefficient, much
more so than the old "benevolent despo
tisms" of Frederick the Great and of
pre-war Germany. When countries need
ed efficiency as badly as did the European
nations after the war, dictatorships were
the solutions of the problems. Also the
people were accustomed to obeying orders
after the war, and the change from war
to peace dictatorships was not great.
"The city manager and commission
forms of city government are similar to
the governments set up in many of the
countries of Europe. The commission
form of government in America started
with the Galveston disaster, when an
emergency demanded efficiency in man
agement. People are naturally inclined
to say, 'If dictatorial governments are
best in times of great emergencies, why
not try them when things are normal ?' "
Activities Curtailed
Democracy's only justification for ex
istence, in the opinion of Professor
Thompson, is the fact that it satisfies the
people, and that people will stand for a
curtailment of activities under a demo
cratic government that they would not
accept from a dictator.
The fact that France, with its highly
developed multiple party system and its
serious reconstruction problems, has not
gone into the ranks of the dictator-con
trollcd countries is probably due to that
country's disastrous experience with Na
poleon 111, which resulted in the defeat
in 1870, according to Professor Thomp
son.
At present, seven regular dictatorships
exist in Europe: in Russia, Italy, Spain,
Portugal, Poland, Turkey, and Jugosla
via. Roumania, Czecho-Slovakia, Alba
nia, and Lithuania either have had, or are
considering, dictatorial governments.
Russia and Italy have the most firmly
established dictatorships, in which the
dictators keep the power by military
means, and where they are attempting to
perpetuate the dictator idea by means of
education; in Italy by means of the
young Fascist group started by Musso
lini, and in Russia by means of training
in the public schools.
Professor Thompson believes that with

the exception of Italy and Russia, the J
dictatorships will probably disappear j
