# SPORTS OF 1929
## Sizable and Shifty 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
A large and powerful gent has come i
back to the major leagues after a j
year's absence, and now holds down j
the job of guarding the initial sack j
for the Pittsburgh Pirates, whereas he 1
used to play the same bag for the
Chicago White Sox. A lucky break
for him, you'll probably agree, for the
team froifi Smokeville has a chance j
to get into the world's series, where- ,
as the Pale Hose have about as much
chance of playing in the autumn
classic as Wilbert Robinson has of
being appointed President Hoover's |
valet.
Sheely is the gentleman's name â€” '
Earl Homer Sheely, of Bushnell, 111.
Born on Lincoln's birthday, 1895, i
right-handed anyway you take him, [
and as heavy as Jack Dempsey is j
now and much taller. It was not until i
1921 that Earl Sheely got himself a
job in the majors, although he had
played around in the Pacific North
west and for Salt Lake ever since
1912. The White Sox signed him on

| the strength of his .371 batting aver
j age, made in the rarified atmosphere
J of Salt Lake in 1920. But unlike Paul
: Strand, famous hero from the Mor
' mon City who was a flop with the
Athletics, Sheely continued to bat
.300 or better for several seasons in
Chicago's South Side park.
While never rated as a great bat
ter, Sheely occasionally lives up to
j his middle name and puts over a
j homer on some rival pitcher. But it is
I as a "human bull's-eye that he really
I shines at first. His great size, reach,
: and agility make him almost irnpos
! sible to miss, and the Pirate infielders
will not make many wild throws this
i season with the big blond on first
base.
An international congress to study
i means of combatting malaria will be
j convened in Rome next fall.
France's influenza epidemic has be-
I come so serious that it is necessary
l import nurses from England.
