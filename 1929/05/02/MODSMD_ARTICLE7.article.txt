# HOOVER BANS N. Y. LAWYER FROM OFFICE
## President's Summary Order Removes DeGroot From Federal Position 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., May 1 (/P).—
President Hoover today summarily re
moved from office William A. DeGroot,
federal attorney for the Eastern and
New York district, who had refused re
quests of two successive Attorneys Gen
eral that he resign.
The chief executive acted upon a rec
ommendation of Attorney General Mitch
ell, who wrote Mr. Hoover that "there
seems to be no difference of opinion
among judges, members of the bar, or
officials or attorneys in the Department
of Justice as to the existence of unsatis
factory conditions in Mr. DeGroot's of
fice and as to the necessity for supplant
ing him by a competent and reliable man
i who will thoroughly reorganize the office
and make immediate and extensive
changes in the personnel."
The President's order, addressed to
DeGroot, said:
"You are hereby removed from the
office of United States attorney, Eastern
! district of New York, effective immedi
ately."
As to DeGroot's request for a public
hearing before the President acted, it
was stated that a hearing had been held
under former Attorney General Sargent.
On this point, Mr. Mitchell said:
"It would be a waste of time to com
ply with Mr. DeGroot's request for any
| further hearing."
This is the first case of the summary
dismissal of a public official since the
j Hoover administration took office, but
White House officials said there were
j many precedents in previous administra
tions. Perhaps the best known is that
of the Oregon postmaster who was re
moved from office by President Wilson
and who lost his fight on an appeal to
the United States Supreme Court.
Ordinarily dismissal is brought about
! by the simple expedient of sending the
! nomination of the successor of the dis
missed officer to the Senate, but in this
particular case a successor had not been
selected and the summary order was is
sued in place of a nomination.
