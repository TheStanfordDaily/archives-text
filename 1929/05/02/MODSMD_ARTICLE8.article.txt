i WASHINGTON, D.C., May 1 Â«/P).-
j The smoke screen having again appeared
; in the capital as the medium by which
suspected bootleggers escaped pursuing
police, more than usual interest was at
tached today to a long prohibition dis
cussion in the House in which the smoke
screen and President Hoover's recent law
enforcement speech figured.
Police were guarding various en
trances into the district and Private
Henry Rinke was recovering from ncar
j blindness' occasioned by smoke loosed
I from a rum car, which eluded him after
a chase of many blocks. The intensity
lof the situation in the current war be
| tween police and rum runners had been
J increased by two pistol battles, one itv
j near-by Maryland and another in Vir
ginia. One negro was wounded.
Representative Miller, Republican, of
| Washington, proposed in a bill that the
stamp of "justifiable homicide" be put on
cases where an officer kills a person in

attempting to halt an automobile from
which a smoke scrcen is being projected.
