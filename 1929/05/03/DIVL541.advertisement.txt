Gentlemen:
Just a line to let you know where
some of your tobacco has been going
for the last ten years.
I have been smoking Edgeworth for
the past ten years; in fact, since I
started smoking, and it is just as good
now as it was then. Have given other
brands a fair trial, but there is none
like Edgeworth. During that time I
have had costly pipes and some not so
costly, but I have decided that it is
not the pipe but what is in it that
counts.
With best wishes for your continued
success in the manufacture of this high
grade tobacco, I am,
Sincerely,
(Signed) N. A. Vaeth

started smoking, and it is just as good
now as it was then. Have given other
brands a fair trial, but there is none
like Edgeworth. During that time I
have had costly pipes and some not so
costly, but I have decided that it is
not the pipe but what is in it that
counts.

Gentlemen:
Just a line to let you know where
some of your tobacco has been going
for the last ten years.
I have been smoking Edgeworth for
the past ten years; in fact, since I
started smoking, and it is just as good
now as it was then. Have given other
brands a fair trial, but there is none
like Edgeworth. During that time I
have had costly pipes and some not so
