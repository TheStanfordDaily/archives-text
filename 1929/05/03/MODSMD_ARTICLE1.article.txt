# SCHACHT, YOUNG SILENT ON DEBT REPARATION PLAN
## Negotiations For Settlement Of Germany's Reparations Not Progressing at Berlin Final Decision To Be Reached Within Next Few Days; Not Certain of Outcome 
### 
PARIS, May 2. (/P) â€”Negotiations for
the settlement of German reparations
at the second Dawes committee re
mained at a standstill tonight after a
conversation between Owen D. Young,
chairman of the committee, and Dr.
Hjalmar Schacht, who had just re
turned from Berlin.
Neither Mr. Young nor Dr. Schacht
and his colleagues would disclose the
nature of their talk, further than that
it got down to essentials. They would
draw no conclusion from their con
versations.
All that experts on the other dele
gations would say after they had been
acquainted with the substance of Dr.
Schacht's talk with Mr. Young, was
the conference was still alive.
I)r. Schacht himself intimated that
a final decision would be reached
within a couple of days, but declined
to indicate whether hoped it would
be favorable to an accord.
Emile Moreau, chief of the French
delegation, is leaving Paris tomorrow
for Sunday's municipal elections
throughout France, so that nothing
decisive can be arrived at in any case
until after his return on Monday.
Meanwhile the conversations of Dr.
Schacht with Mr. Young and other
experts will continue tomorrow.
A great issue before the conference
:s whether rifles, machine guns, big
and little mortars, tanks, and armored
cars shall be limited by a direct meth
od or by the indirect method of esti
mating how much they cost.
France, Italy, Japan, and Czecho
slovakia advocated what is called the
system of budgetary limitation of war
material. The United States, Soviet
Russia, Germany, Turkey, and The
Netherlands are opposed, believing
that the budgetary method leads no
where.
Presenting the American attitude
today Mr. Gibson declared that fluctu
countries made it impracticable to
adopt the budgetary system of limita
tion. In his way of thinking, limitation
01 the physical means of waging war
by figuring in terms of money would
give only a false picture of the real
situation.
The question of reduction of the
fleets as a supplement to the Wash
ington Naval Treaty will be adjourned
at a date which will be left unfixed.
Meantime the five powers will con
tinue conversations on the naval prob
lem. The form of these conversations
was understood to be not yet deter
mined but would presumably be ex
changes of notes between the five
nations.
These may possibly develop into a
meeting of experts from the United
States, Great Britain, Japan, France,
and Italy.
The main theme of these conversa
tions will be the American suggestion
for agreement upon a formula for es
timating the equivalent tonnage of
cruisers, destroyers, and submarines.
