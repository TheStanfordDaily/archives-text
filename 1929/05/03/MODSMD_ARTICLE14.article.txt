# CONVALESCENT DRIVE TOTAL SWELLS AS DONATIONS CONTINUE TO POUR IN
## 
### 
Surpassing last year's mark by more
than $500, Stanford's annual charity
drive for the Convalescent Home went
gloriously over the top yesterday. With
$3266.88 already in the hands of the
Home committee and more funds con
stantly pouring in, a new record has been
reached in this year's campaign for Stan
ford's Convalescent Home.
Donating almost one-half of the total
amount of money collected for the Home,
Stanford's "500" from Row and Roble
once again responded wholeheartedly to
the charity appeal and contributed
$1502.50.
Along the Row, the Kappa Kappa
Gammas topped the list of donors. Fra
ternities contributed $389.65, while the
halls and clubs gave $758.15. The fac
ulty contributed $450, and $104.97 was
netted Wednesday by concessions operat
ed on Labor Day.
