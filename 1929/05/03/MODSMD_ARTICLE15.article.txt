# JUNIOR OPERA TO FEATURE FREAKS
## 
### 
The Bearded Lady, Barbara the
Blonde, leads the freaks by a hair in the
biggest collection of marvels in one barn
in the world, which will appear in the
Junior Opera, Mo-ring On, May 11. This
phenomenon is played by Parnie Storey
and is one of the principals of the circus
drama.
The exhibition of the prodigies of civ
ilization occurs in the third act, and in
cludes over eight of the usual side-show
headliners. Oswald, the Human Skeleton
and Tall Man, is among the group. Ella
the Fat Lady, weight five hundred and
seventy-five pounds, sleeps, sits in spe
cially reinforced chairs, is another whim
some feature.
Sailor Jack, the Tattooed Man, is one
of the most colorful of the ladies and
gentlemen of the Midway, being tattooed
in languages from all over and under the
world by Harold'Helvenston. A Knife-
Thrower and a Sword-Swallower com
plete the outfit.
Not only will the freaks appear in
person themselves, au naturel and in their
acts, but in between the choruses of the
Opera, a student audience will be given
an opportunity fur insight into the real
life of a side-show Marvel. The dialogue
for the curiosities is one of the outstand
ing features of the play, and is claimed
to he as prodigious as the freaks them
selves.
