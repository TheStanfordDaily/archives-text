# HELEN PETERSEN AND JEAN MAGNUS DEBATE AGAINST U.S.C. TEAM
## 
### 
I
| With the main arguments of the i
| discussion revolving about the point i
I of whether the abuses now existent !
as a result of the plea of temporary j
j insanity as a defense for crime are j
inherent in the plea or can be reme- j
died and still leave the plea intact, j
the women debaters of U.S.C. and ;
Stanford presented well-balanced argu
ments last night in the Little Theatre j
j in the second annual -women's debate j
i between the two universities.
The question was: "Resolved, That
! temporary insanity as a defense of
j crime be prohibited by law." Speakers \
! for U.S.C. in support of the resolution
were Bonnie-Jean Lockwood, '30, and
; Helen Petersen, '31, while Jean Mag
; nus, '32, and Hallien Hickman, '32, of
, Stanford, argued against the question.
The affirmative stated, "We con-
J demn the plea of temporary insanity
as a defense of crime because it com
pels a temporarily insane man to
come into court and defend himself
against a crime which the law says
was never committed." And the nega
tive answered: "The right of trial by
jury is the right of the jury to pass J
on every fact which may go to deter-
mine the guilt or innocence of a man j
I and the abolition of the insanity plea
j would do away with the right of the
j jury to decide on the criminal intent." j
Dean Mary Yost presided at the de- j
bate and in the end announced that |
the audience decision showed that
equal numbers of votes had been in
fluenced by both sides.
