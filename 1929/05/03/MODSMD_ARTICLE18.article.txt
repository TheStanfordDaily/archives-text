### FRANK WHITELEY 
In their final Northern California appearance this year Stanford's Cardinal
track and field champions will make a bid for American Athletic Union honors in
the annual P.A.A. meet at the Kezar Stadium in San Francisco tomorrow. Coach
Dink Templeton is entering a full-strength team, and it will encounter plenty of
opposition in the form of the Olympic Club and the University of California.
The meet will start at 2 o'clock, although two events, the hammer throw and
five-mile run, have been scheduled earlier, at 12:30 and 1:00, respectively.
Entries for the meet total 131, Stanford leading the list with forty-two, and
the Olympic Club coming next with forty-one. California is entering eleven men.
All of the athletes have rounded into their mid-season form by now, and some
exciting battles for the places are assured. With the added events of the fifty-six-

ypound weight, the hammer throw, and
the five-mile run, Coach Charlie Hunter's
Winged "O" tracksters will have an ex
| cellent chance to avenge that &4'/$ to
defeat at the hands of the Cards earlier
this spring.
Stanford has only one man, Casey Ka
zanjian, who has any chance of defeat
ing the Olympic Club entries in the ham
mer and 56-pound weight events. Nor
man McLeod, Card sophomore, is a pos
sibility for a point in the hammer.
Eric Krenz finished second in the dis
cus for the first time this year at Fresno
last week, Jim Corson of the Olympic
Club sneaking over a win with a throw
of 151 feet; and accordingly P3ric will
jbe after Corson's scalp tomorrow.
Another revenge fight is promised in
! the mile between Harry Carter of Cali
fornia and Alex McKinnon of Stanford.
McKinnon beat the lanky Bear four-lap
man by two yards in the Big Meet two
weeks ago in a 4 :295. race, and the Cali
fornian did not particularly like the idea
of finishing second in much slower time
than he is capable of. Spud Mossman,
Christie's red-headed sophomore two-mil
er, will also be entered in the mile.
In the sprints Hec Dyer, who finished
only two feet behind Borah in a 9 3-5
second hundred at Fresno, will be

mile; Elwood, 100, 220; Lombardi, 100,
J 220; and Johns, pole vault.
In their final Northern California appearance this year Stanford's Cardinal
track and field champions will make a bid for American Athletic Union honors in
the annual P.A.A. meet at the Kezar Stadium in San Francisco tomorrow. Coach
Dink Templeton is entering a full-strength team, and it will encounter plenty of
opposition in the form of the Olympic Club and the University of California.
The meet will start at 2 o'clock, although two events, the hammer throw and
five-mile run, have been scheduled earlier, at 12:30 and 1:00, respectively.
Entries for the meet total 131, Stanford leading the list with forty-two, and
the Olympic Club coming next with forty-one. California is entering eleven men.
All of the athletes have rounded into their mid-season form by now, and some
exciting battles for the places are assured. With the added events of the fifty-six-

ypound weight, the hammer throw, and
the five-mile run, Coach Charlie Hunter's
Winged "O" tracksters will have an ex
| cellent chance to avenge that &4'/$ to
defeat at the hands of the Cards earlier
this spring.
Stanford has only one man, Casey Ka
zanjian, who has any chance of defeat
ing the Olympic Club entries in the ham
mer and 56-pound weight events. Nor
man McLeod, Card sophomore, is a pos
sibility for a point in the hammer.
Eric Krenz finished second in the dis
cus for the first time this year at Fresno
last week, Jim Corson of the Olympic
Club sneaking over a win with a throw
of 151 feet; and accordingly P3ric will
jbe after Corson's scalp tomorrow.
Another revenge fight is promised in
! the mile between Harry Carter of Cali
fornia and Alex McKinnon of Stanford.
McKinnon beat the lanky Bear four-lap
man by two yards in the Big Meet two
weeks ago in a 4 :295. race, and the Cali
fornian did not particularly like the idea
of finishing second in much slower time
than he is capable of. Spud Mossman,
Christie's red-headed sophomore two-mil
er, will also be entered in the mile.
In the sprints Hec Dyer, who finished
only two feet behind Borah in a 9 3-5
second hundred at Fresno, will be
j matched against Frank Lombardi of the
| Stanford freshmen; Bob Kiesel, high
; school sensation from Mount Tamalpai;
land Russ Sweet of the Olympic Club.
Two thrilling races are promised with
Dyer having the edge because of his con
sistent performances this season.
The 120-yard high hurdles is sure to
be one of the feature events of the day
with Captain Ross Nichols of Stanford,
Captain-elect Pogolotti of California,
j Podge Smith, and Ward Edmonds en
tered. All are capable of 15 seconds or
I better. Nichols won the final heat of the
| high barriers at Fresno in 14 3-5 s.
j Sparling, Kibby and Perelli-Minetti—
! Stanford's javelin tossing trio — will
again be pitted against California's three
I spear throwers, Curtice, Churchill, and
j Baxter. With a throw of more than 202
| feet Sparling was only able to place third
| in the Big Meet.
There will be no mile relay.
