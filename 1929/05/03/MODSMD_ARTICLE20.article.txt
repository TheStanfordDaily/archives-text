# "Those Repressed Nineties"
## 
### 
Patent-leather-haired sheiks may well thumb their noses at the Bicycle-
Built-for-Two age that just precedes them, yet those old boys with their
walrus mustaches and peg-topped pants might well show these callow lads
? thing or two.
What with fast sixes and eights, rotgut bootleg liquor, talking movies,
night clubs and other of our modern playthings, we plume ourselves in
being young sophisticates capable of enjoying life as the old boys never
could. They didn't "know what it was all about." Perhaps not, but let
one of the old boys tell a thing or two about his mauve decade.
Repressed nineties?
* % * * + *
NOW, LAD, draw your stool up closer to my Morris chair, and let old Rufus
tell yon about the nineties, that enlightened and regenerated era.
It was a time of progress and revolutionary effort in almost every branch of
thought and gaiety—a period in which someone was forever piping all hands on
deck for grog and the Golden Rule was in operation right up to the closing hour.
Prosperity was the keynote of it all—and the abandon was something that hasn't
died down yet. Indeed, this present generation of upstarts which we old timers have
despaired for since the World War are nothing more nor less than the fruits of
the un-repressed nineties. Why, they couldn't have turned out any other way—and
bless 'em, they're a swell crop.
Everywhere people were discarding Grant, Lee and Jackson as heroes and
adopted John L. Sullivan and "Cap" Anson. Robert Ingersoll, Nietzsche, Samuel
Butler and Emile Zola—agnostics, students, champions—went around shaking their
fist at G<xl and a blundering nature.
Verdi was putting real meat into opera librettos, and O. Henry, languishing in
an Ohio bastile, artfully whittled the short story down to its best form.
Oscar Wilde opened the world's eyes to prison inhumanity through his Ballad
of Reading Gaol, while Victor Herbert scrawled exquisite melodies upon rathskeller
tablecloths and downed more Pilsner. Joseph Jefferson, Lottie Collins and Delia
Eox, somewhere, were putting a keen edge on the day for about 8000 people.
The Bowery was a gay alley flower which everybody plucked and carried back
home in the button hole after a whirl at the metropolis. Bock Beer was a nickel
and men dallied with smoked herring or mayhaps a link of sausage at the free lunch
counter as the night raced merrily on to music from a mysterious new contraption
called the phonograph.
George Bernard Shaw, behind a flaming beard, had become adept at tweeking
the world's nose and then blowing his whiskers in its face; which is an old way of
"making 'em like it."
George Ade, straight from Purdue, was making long noses at pedagogues with
his Fables in Slang. Paul Erlich, gifted microbe hunter, slammed his door on the
churchy bigotry of "As ye sow —" and went right on shaping that magic bullet,
"606." Carmencita, brilliant ill red and yellow, flung great abandon into the dance,
and had straight-laced ladies coming in to spy on her through veils only to rush
before august editors to put a stop to it.
San Francisco's Barbary Coast was piling up enough rowdyism to blow fiction
writers over the Volsteadean doldrums. One-lunged motors on buggy wheels,
packed to the tail light with young blades, staggered up unpaved streets, and stopped
before the "Eden Musee," latest evolution in amusements, and dropped a dollar in
pennies into risque picture machines, and the sport was to find one in which the
heroine had a rip in her black tights.
Charles E. Blaney whipped new life into the theater with his booming melos
and had impulsive kids tumbling out of nigger heavens with excitement. The bur
lesque show was in its heyday.
Stage comedians—the Ikes and Mikes, the Webers and Fields, the Mclntyres
and Heaths—were springing up everywhere, and Mark Twain had the world holding
its belly with a brand of humor that hasn't been equaled since.
Horsecars rattled over streets and here was a beautiful law which kept con
ductors from throwing drunks off while the things were in motion. Chewing to
bacco had hit its high level and migratory bootblacks did a clean-up business in
districts where corner hooligans spat the amber juice at peaceful pedestrians' shoes.
Every city voted to have its own Coney Island. Barnutn and Bailey had the
population "lost" and dancing at the end of a snapping whip, and even the stomach
ache from stale lemonade was a pleasure—today. "Down Went McGinty" and and
"Ta-ra-ra-boom-deay" blared from every throat and started up this bumptious
racket of Tin Pan Alley.
Clothes designers put something like a decent shape to the derby hat, even if
the inside did look like a baby's coffin. The subway was built, and parties were
organized for the fun of spending a beautiful Sunday riding through tunnels.
Fourth of July was a day commensurate with the significance of our Inde
pendence, as hospital registers would indicate. Dime novels and the penny-dreadfuls
were under every mattress. "Rcadymade" cigarets were stylish, and no collection of
inserts was complete without a picture of Fritzi Scheff.
OF COURSE, there were other things like diphtheria and no cure for it, roller
towels, hangovers, brawls, mad dogs, the polka, Sen-Sen, drummers, third degrees,
cock-fights, phoney investment companies, and people wrote letters to newspapers.
But we'll skip all that. Besides, some of the hangovers and brawls weren't so bad
after all. And even so, those things don't indicate "repression."
—Rufus Wair in- the San Francisco Bulletin
Yes, the gay nineties had their "fire" and made "whoopee" in quite
as successful way as this more mechanical era of ours.

packed to the tail light with young blades, staggered up unpaved streets, and stopped
before the "Eden Musee," latest evolution in amusements, and dropped a dollar in
pennies into risque picture machines, and the sport was to find one in which the
heroine had a rip in her black tights.
Charles E. Blaney whipped new life into the theater with his booming melos
and had impulsive kids tumbling out of nigger heavens with excitement. The bur
lesque show was in its heyday.
Stage comedians—the Ikes and Mikes, the Webers and Fields, the Mclntyres
and Heaths—were springing up everywhere, and Mark Twain had the world holding
its belly with a brand of humor that hasn't been equaled since.
Horsecars rattled over streets and here was a beautiful law which kept con
ductors from throwing drunks off while the things were in motion. Chewing to
bacco had hit its high level and migratory bootblacks did a clean-up business in
districts where corner hooligans spat the amber juice at peaceful pedestrians' shoes.
Every city voted to have its own Coney Island. Barnutn and Bailey had the
population "lost" and dancing at the end of a snapping whip, and even the stomach
ache from stale lemonade was a pleasure—today. "Down Went McGinty" and and
"Ta-ra-ra-boom-deay" blared from every throat and started up this bumptious
racket of Tin Pan Alley.
Clothes designers put something like a decent shape to the derby hat, even if
the inside did look like a baby's coffin. The subway was built, and parties were
organized for the fun of spending a beautiful Sunday riding through tunnels.
Fourth of July was a day commensurate with the significance of our Inde
pendence, as hospital registers would indicate. Dime novels and the penny-dreadfuls
were under every mattress. "Rcadymade" cigarets were stylish, and no collection of
inserts was complete without a picture of Fritzi Scheff.
OF COURSE, there were other things like diphtheria and no cure for it, roller
towels, hangovers, brawls, mad dogs, the polka, Sen-Sen, drummers, third degrees,
cock-fights, phoney investment companies, and people wrote letters to newspapers.
But we'll skip all that. Besides, some of the hangovers and brawls weren't so bad
after all. And even so, those things don't indicate "repression."
—Rufus Wair in- the San Francisco Bulletin
Yes, the gay nineties had their "fire" and made "whoopee" in quite
as successful way as this more mechanical era of ours.

There will lie a meeting of the freshmen men members of the editorial
and business staffs at 1 p.m. today in the editor's office.
Patent-leather-haired sheiks may well thumb their noses at the Bicycle-
Built-for-Two age that just precedes them, yet those old boys with their
walrus mustaches and peg-topped pants might well show these callow lads
? thing or two.
What with fast sixes and eights, rotgut bootleg liquor, talking movies,
night clubs and other of our modern playthings, we plume ourselves in
being young sophisticates capable of enjoying life as the old boys never
could. They didn't "know what it was all about." Perhaps not, but let
one of the old boys tell a thing or two about his mauve decade.
Repressed nineties?
* % * * + *
NOW, LAD, draw your stool up closer to my Morris chair, and let old Rufus
tell yon about the nineties, that enlightened and regenerated era.
It was a time of progress and revolutionary effort in almost every branch of
thought and gaiety—a period in which someone was forever piping all hands on
deck for grog and the Golden Rule was in operation right up to the closing hour.
Prosperity was the keynote of it all—and the abandon was something that hasn't
died down yet. Indeed, this present generation of upstarts which we old timers have
despaired for since the World War are nothing more nor less than the fruits of
the un-repressed nineties. Why, they couldn't have turned out any other way—and
bless 'em, they're a swell crop.
Everywhere people were discarding Grant, Lee and Jackson as heroes and
adopted John L. Sullivan and "Cap" Anson. Robert Ingersoll, Nietzsche, Samuel
Butler and Emile Zola—agnostics, students, champions—went around shaking their
fist at G<xl and a blundering nature.
Verdi was putting real meat into opera librettos, and O. Henry, languishing in
an Ohio bastile, artfully whittled the short story down to its best form.
Oscar Wilde opened the world's eyes to prison inhumanity through his Ballad
of Reading Gaol, while Victor Herbert scrawled exquisite melodies upon rathskeller
tablecloths and downed more Pilsner. Joseph Jefferson, Lottie Collins and Delia
Eox, somewhere, were putting a keen edge on the day for about 8000 people.
The Bowery was a gay alley flower which everybody plucked and carried back
home in the button hole after a whirl at the metropolis. Bock Beer was a nickel
and men dallied with smoked herring or mayhaps a link of sausage at the free lunch
counter as the night raced merrily on to music from a mysterious new contraption
called the phonograph.
George Bernard Shaw, behind a flaming beard, had become adept at tweeking
the world's nose and then blowing his whiskers in its face; which is an old way of
"making 'em like it."
George Ade, straight from Purdue, was making long noses at pedagogues with
his Fables in Slang. Paul Erlich, gifted microbe hunter, slammed his door on the
churchy bigotry of "As ye sow —" and went right on shaping that magic bullet,
"606." Carmencita, brilliant ill red and yellow, flung great abandon into the dance,
and had straight-laced ladies coming in to spy on her through veils only to rush
before august editors to put a stop to it.

Repressed nineties?
* % * * + *
NOW, LAD, draw your stool up closer to my Morris chair, and let old Rufus
tell yon about the nineties, that enlightened and regenerated era.
It was a time of progress and revolutionary effort in almost every branch of
thought and gaiety—a period in which someone was forever piping all hands on
deck for grog and the Golden Rule was in operation right up to the closing hour.
Prosperity was the keynote of it all—and the abandon was something that hasn't
died down yet. Indeed, this present generation of upstarts which we old timers have
despaired for since the World War are nothing more nor less than the fruits of
the un-repressed nineties. Why, they couldn't have turned out any other way—and
bless 'em, they're a swell crop.
Everywhere people were discarding Grant, Lee and Jackson as heroes and
adopted John L. Sullivan and "Cap" Anson. Robert Ingersoll, Nietzsche, Samuel
Butler and Emile Zola—agnostics, students, champions—went around shaking their
fist at G<xl and a blundering nature.
Verdi was putting real meat into opera librettos, and O. Henry, languishing in
an Ohio bastile, artfully whittled the short story down to its best form.
Oscar Wilde opened the world's eyes to prison inhumanity through his Ballad
of Reading Gaol, while Victor Herbert scrawled exquisite melodies upon rathskeller
tablecloths and downed more Pilsner. Joseph Jefferson, Lottie Collins and Delia
Eox, somewhere, were putting a keen edge on the day for about 8000 people.
The Bowery was a gay alley flower which everybody plucked and carried back
home in the button hole after a whirl at the metropolis. Bock Beer was a nickel
and men dallied with smoked herring or mayhaps a link of sausage at the free lunch
counter as the night raced merrily on to music from a mysterious new contraption
called the phonograph.
George Bernard Shaw, behind a flaming beard, had become adept at tweeking
the world's nose and then blowing his whiskers in its face; which is an old way of
"making 'em like it."
George Ade, straight from Purdue, was making long noses at pedagogues with
his Fables in Slang. Paul Erlich, gifted microbe hunter, slammed his door on the
churchy bigotry of "As ye sow —" and went right on shaping that magic bullet,
"606." Carmencita, brilliant ill red and yellow, flung great abandon into the dance,
and had straight-laced ladies coming in to spy on her through veils only to rush
before august editors to put a stop to it.
San Francisco's Barbary Coast was piling up enough rowdyism to blow fiction
writers over the Volsteadean doldrums. One-lunged motors on buggy wheels,
packed to the tail light with young blades, staggered up unpaved streets, and stopped
before the "Eden Musee," latest evolution in amusements, and dropped a dollar in
pennies into risque picture machines, and the sport was to find one in which the
heroine had a rip in her black tights.
Charles E. Blaney whipped new life into the theater with his booming melos
and had impulsive kids tumbling out of nigger heavens with excitement. The bur
lesque show was in its heyday.
Stage comedians—the Ikes and Mikes, the Webers and Fields, the Mclntyres
and Heaths—were springing up everywhere, and Mark Twain had the world holding
its belly with a brand of humor that hasn't been equaled since.
Horsecars rattled over streets and here was a beautiful law which kept con
ductors from throwing drunks off while the things were in motion. Chewing to
bacco had hit its high level and migratory bootblacks did a clean-up business in
districts where corner hooligans spat the amber juice at peaceful pedestrians' shoes.
Every city voted to have its own Coney Island. Barnutn and Bailey had the
population "lost" and dancing at the end of a snapping whip, and even the stomach
ache from stale lemonade was a pleasure—today. "Down Went McGinty" and and
"Ta-ra-ra-boom-deay" blared from every throat and started up this bumptious
racket of Tin Pan Alley.
Clothes designers put something like a decent shape to the derby hat, even if
the inside did look like a baby's coffin. The subway was built, and parties were
organized for the fun of spending a beautiful Sunday riding through tunnels.
Fourth of July was a day commensurate with the significance of our Inde
pendence, as hospital registers would indicate. Dime novels and the penny-dreadfuls
were under every mattress. "Rcadymade" cigarets were stylish, and no collection of
inserts was complete without a picture of Fritzi Scheff.
OF COURSE, there were other things like diphtheria and no cure for it, roller
towels, hangovers, brawls, mad dogs, the polka, Sen-Sen, drummers, third degrees,
cock-fights, phoney investment companies, and people wrote letters to newspapers.
But we'll skip all that. Besides, some of the hangovers and brawls weren't so bad
after all. And even so, those things don't indicate "repression."
—Rufus Wair in- the San Francisco Bulletin
Yes, the gay nineties had their "fire" and made "whoopee" in quite
as successful way as this more mechanical era of ours.

There will lie a meeting of the freshmen men members of the editorial
and business staffs at 1 p.m. today in the editor's office.
Patent-leather-haired sheiks may well thumb their noses at the Bicycle-
Built-for-Two age that just precedes them, yet those old boys with their
walrus mustaches and peg-topped pants might well show these callow lads
? thing or two.
What with fast sixes and eights, rotgut bootleg liquor, talking movies,
night clubs and other of our modern playthings, we plume ourselves in
being young sophisticates capable of enjoying life as the old boys never
could. They didn't "know what it was all about." Perhaps not, but let
