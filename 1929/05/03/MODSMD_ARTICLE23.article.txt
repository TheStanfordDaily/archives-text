AT THE THEATRES
ALCAZAR—The Big Pond is a
play in which Robert McWade gives a
genuinely amusing performance. It is
about a "big butter and egg man" who
goes abroad.
COLUMBIA—The Broadway Mel
ody. Talkie.
CURRAN—The House of Women,
with Nance O'Neil, finishes the last week
of its run. David Belasco presents The
Bachelor Father, direct from New
York with original cast, beginning Mon
day night.
GEARY—The Front Page. Despite
the fact that certain anti-vice societies
are lifting parts of the play out of gen
eral spirit and context and calling them
immoral and what-not, I still contend
that this play is excellent and worth
seeing.
GREEN STREET—Easy for Zee
Zee is in its umpty-umpth week.
PRESIDENT—The Maniac, an en
tertaining mystery play in which Edmund
Breese fully shows that he has had
thirty-six years of acting experience—
and he hasn't gone stale by a long shot.

RELIGION. By Edward Scribner
Ames. (New York: Henry Holt &
Company. $3.00.)
I know that the very title of this book
is going to scare away a good many col
lege readers from going further. I start
ed reading the book with the same atti
tude.
Imagine my embarrassment when I
found it as interesting as any novel (and
more interesting than many I have to
wade through). It is one of those books
where you always want to read "just one
more chapter" before you set it aside to
allow for a few hours of sleep.
Most college students are between the
devil and the deep blue sea. They have
cast aside the traditional dogmas and
credos of their ancestors' religion as be
ing entirely out of harmony with modern
life and science. They wander around in
a mental blank. They can't accept for
mal theology with its strong hangover of
medievalism; but they feel, at the same
Professor Ames outlines the middle
time, that there is something more signi
ficant to life than is presented in the
futilism and despair philosophy of many
of our modern realists.

path. He, for instance, postulates a God
that is created by men after the pattern
of their own highest ideals. He does this
through a combination of the modern
scientific methods of philosophy, psychol
ogy, and sociology. Religion, according
to Professor Ames, grows from the com
munal life of men. It is as much a fac
tor in life, and is just as real ,as is the
idea of family or nationality, or person
ality.
"Religion" is, primarily, a study of the
philosophy of religion; but it is written
for the average man, not his peers in
philosophy. A keener and more experi
enced mind than mine is could possibly
pick some flaws in his philosophic deduc
tions. I can't.
Another good point of this discussion
of religion is that the subject is discussed
entirely apart from particular creeds or
faiths. Christianity, Mohammedanism,
Buddhism, Confucianism—they all serve
the same fundamental purpose, that of
being a means whereby man can formu
late his ideals and aspirations into a pat
tern that will give his life form and
purpose.
The finest short statement of what
Professor Ames (professor of Philoso
phy of the University of Chicago) does
in "Religion" is given by Professor
George Albert Coe. Coe says:
"It is a contribution to the critical
study of the psychology and the philoso
phy of religion. For it works out with
a thoroughness of detail never before at
tempted the affirmative possibilities of re
ligion upon a purely empirical basis. The
lopping off of one religious tradition
after another in response to scientific
knowledge is usually accompanied by a
defense of what remains. Not so with
Ames. For him religion is not a re
mainder ; it is the aggressive mastery of
the empirically known conditions of life.
He accepts radical empiricism as a pre
supposition, and he attempts to work out
what amounts to a religious interpreta
tion of Dewey's philosophy. The result
is a new species within the historical suc
cession of philosophies of religion."
"Religion" is strongly recommended as
a modern and intelligent presentation of
a question that is bothering every one of
us who is trying to work out any sort of
a philosophy of life and living. Don't let
the title of the book frighten you.
