IRATE HOPEFUL
The Editor, Sir:
I am glad to see that the Daily has
brought to the fore the question of the
proposed women's gymnasium. The mat
ter has been sleeping ever since the archi
tectural plans for the gym were presented
to the Board of Athletic Control at the
end of fall quarter, and the plans were
referred to committees, who have done
nothing.
We are accused of asking for more
equipment than five hundred people need.
We might point out that more than $100,-
000 has been spent in the last few years
on the men's gym, while hardly a dollar
has gone to Roble Gym in the last thirty

eight. All the generations of 50()'s who I
have had to use this structure would add !
up to a number deserving of a $300,000
expenditure. Furthermore, the space re
quired by an activity such as dancing
should be taken into consideration.
Unless you have played tennis on one
of the few and rocky Roble Gym courts,
or danced in a structure that shakes with
every movement, you cannot appreciate
the discomfort the women have to put up
with. If the men had to use equipment
of that sort, they would have lynched the
B.A.C. long ago. We have to be ladylike, j
We want the Board of Athletic Con- [
trol to start doing things!
