"Frankie and Johnnie"
Toro and Breakers were lovers
Oh my Gawd, how they did love!
Swore they would baptize each other
Just as sure as the stars above
Each rough neck clan
Bent on doin' wrong
Toro went down to Dumbarton
Getting quite sloppy with beer
All the Halls they said "Lordy,
Who's tootin' that auto horn here?
Give rne that can
I'll sure do them wrong!"
Campo came 'round next morning
Said, "Dammit, give us a rest —
Always knew that El Toro
Was not bin' but a "doggone" pest
You also-rans
You been doin' us wrong.
i
This story has no moral
This story has no end
This story only goes to show
That there ain't no good in Men.
They are such roughs—
Always doin' wrong.
"Dixie"
Oh I wish I wuz in Dixie
Hooray, K.A.!
We started off in Dixie land
And there we rate to beat the band
K.A., Hooray!
We'd better he in Dixie!
Hooray, K.A.!
Away down South in Dixie!
"Trees"
I think that I shall never see
Another well-known S.A.E.
An S.A.E. whose ear is prest
Against the earth's faint rumbling
breast
A lad who looks at God, and raves
To find Him half as good as Daves i
An S.A.E. whose house is new
Like last year's bird's-nest painted |
blue

Whom rushing puts into the dumps
Who intimately lives with chumps
Poems are made by fools —maybe
God didn't make the S.A.E.
"Casabianca"
(with variations)
The boy stood on the burning deck j
Whence all but he had fled
"A staunch and sturdy Alpha Delt,"
Admiring watchers said,
"But why not leave the burning ship |
When every hope is gone?"
The words leapt like a leaping sword —
"Sail on, and On, and On!"

This story only goes to show
That there ain't no good in Men.
They are such roughs—
Always doin' wrong.
"Dixie"
Oh I wish I wuz in Dixie
Hooray, K.A.!
We started off in Dixie land
And there we rate to beat the band
K.A., Hooray!
We'd better he in Dixie!
Hooray, K.A.!
Away down South in Dixie!
"Trees"
I think that I shall never see
Another well-known S.A.E.
An S.A.E. whose ear is prest
Against the earth's faint rumbling
breast
A lad who looks at God, and raves
To find Him half as good as Daves i
An S.A.E. whose house is new
Like last year's bird's-nest painted |
blue

Whom rushing puts into the dumps
Who intimately lives with chumps
Poems are made by fools —maybe
God didn't make the S.A.E.
"Casabianca"
(with variations)
The boy stood on the burning deck j
Whence all but he had fled
"A staunch and sturdy Alpha Delt,"
Admiring watchers said,
"But why not leave the burning ship |
When every hope is gone?"
The words leapt like a leaping sword —
"Sail on, and On, and On!"
Abandoning the fraternities to start

"Frankie and Johnnie"
Toro and Breakers were lovers
Oh my Gawd, how they did love!
Swore they would baptize each other
Just as sure as the stars above
Each rough neck clan
Bent on doin' wrong
Toro went down to Dumbarton
Getting quite sloppy with beer
All the Halls they said "Lordy,
Who's tootin' that auto horn here?
Give rne that can
I'll sure do them wrong!"
Campo came 'round next morning
Said, "Dammit, give us a rest —
Always knew that El Toro
Was not bin' but a "doggone" pest
You also-rans
You been doin' us wrong.
