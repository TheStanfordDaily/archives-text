## 
### 
COALINGA, May 1. (TP)â€”'The spot-
I ting by four companies of locations
! for new oil wells in the Kettleman
: Hills field, western Fresno county,
; leads local men to believe that the
1 government's new conservation order
' and the plan of the American Petro
' leum Institute to hold down produc
j tion will not stop development, of the
| new Kettleman field.
The Kettleman field, prospected i
i unsuccessfully for 20 years, leaped
into national attention recently when
two gushers were brought in, each i
running well over 2,000 barrels a day. ;
