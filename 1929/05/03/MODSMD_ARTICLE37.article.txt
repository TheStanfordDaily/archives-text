# The 						Iron Man
## 
### 
Whcti the greatest professional golf
ers in the world —and some of the great
est amateurs—tee off at Edinburgh on
May 6, a young Scot, who was born and
raised right where this tournament is to
be held and who bravely sacrificed an
eye and part of an arm for his country
in the war, will be one of the most feared
threats in the whole tournament. He is
not a member of the United States or
British Ryder Cup teams, nor a former
winner of the British open, but he is the
greatest master of iron play in the game
today—Tommy Armour, of Washington,
D.C., winner of the United States and
Canadian open titles in 1927.
And if you are looking for further
feathers in Mr. Armour's cap—or rather,
plumes for his helmet—be it known that,
in 1920, he won the French amateur
championship. That was naturally before
he turned pro, which step he did not take
until 1925. Golf fans will easily remem
ber the hectic battle in which Armour
won his United States open title, after a
play-off with Harry Cooper, at Oakmont,
Pittsburgh. In order to get a tie the day
before, he had to get a 3 on a 460-yard
finishing hole in the last round, and in
order to win in the play-off he picked up
five strokes in the last six holes. Tom
my's 50-foot putt at the fifteenth hole
was the real upsetting blow to his cocky
opponent.

I It is needless to say that Armour will
I click in the forthcoming tournament. To
j say that he will "cleek" would be better,
j The cleek is his favorite shot, and,
j armed with this club and his other irons,
I the Knight in Armour will be a danger
j ous foe to any golfer on the lists at
| Muirfield.
