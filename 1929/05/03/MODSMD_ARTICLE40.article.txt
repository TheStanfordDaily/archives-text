Saturday, May 4, is the last day short

Theta Sigma Phi, women's honorary
journalistic society, is sponsoring. The
stories are limited to two thousand words
and should be turned in to either Blanch

The preliminary elimination will be
done by members of Theta Sigma Phi,
and the final judging is in the hands of
Professor Edith R. Mirrielees and Pro

The first prize of $10 has been donated
by Theta Sigma Phi, and the second

Magazine in which the prize-winning
short story will be published.
A non-inflamable paper has been
