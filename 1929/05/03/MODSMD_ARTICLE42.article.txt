# DISCIPLINED FREEDOM IS EDUCATION'S IDEAL DECLARES COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR

NEW YORK, May 2 (/P). — Public)
education today is between two fires. On
the one, it is tempted by the soft senti
mentalism of the extreme freedom-the
ory; on the other, it is assailed by the
hard materialism which stigmatizes the j
budgets for public education as "sancti- •
fied squander."
Public education will solve these prob- j
lems. It will resist these temptations and
these pressures. But it will take hard
thinking and some heroic action to do it.
In the meantime, it is facing a task the
magnitude of which we are only dimly
sensing.
This vast expansion of education which '
has so greatly complicated our problem ;
entry into the United States, charged j
tant of our material prosperity. It is in
part a cause of our prosperity; in part,
it is an answer to very definite needs
which other contributing causes of pros
perity have brought about.
It is indeed a clear cut expression of
the needs of our industrialized civiliza
tion. With increasing acceleration, the
routine work, the work that can be done
without judgment, is being done by auto
matic machinery.
Fewer and fewer are the opportunities
to earn a living in the routine trades;
greater and greater are the needs on the
stepped-up levels that require intelligent
adaptation.
There are nearly 2,000,000 fewer rou
tine workers in agriculture and industry
today than in 1920. There are many more
workers on the levels represented by the
professional and semi-professional call
ings. The crowding of high schools and
colleges is no accident. It is the product
of some of the most fundamental forces
in social evolution.
Even if it is vague, it is none the less I
a recognizable demand for a type of in- j
struction, inspiration, and discipline that I

I will mean for the great masses a real in
j tellectual growth. Even though they may
j be somewhat inarticulate, they are asking
for bread —and we cannot, we must not,
give them a stone.
From between these opposing forces of
soft sentimentalism and hard material
| ism we can climb to a new plane—the
j plane of a virile, practical, and dynamic
j idealism. The only kind of freedom that
j is thinkable today is disciplined freedom.
We cannot build our democratic structure
on the shifting sands of soft pedagogy.
| There must be iron in the blood of edu
cation and lime in the bone. In the indi
vidual, as in the race, true freedom is
j always as conquest, never a gift.
For the motto of an educational theory
| meet for the need of democracy in an
j increasingly industrialized civilization, I
[propose the phrase: "through discipline
I to freedom."
