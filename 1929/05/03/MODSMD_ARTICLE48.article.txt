### 
An outline of the early history of the
Christian religion, including the account
of its spread from the narrow confines of
Palestine to the limits of the civilized
world, its contacts and relationships with
pagan and mystic cults, and its various
changes from original forms, will be
given by Dean C. C. McCowan of the
Pacific School of Religion in his lecture,
"First Century Christianity, Its Spread,
Organization, Beliefs and Early Lead
ers."
This lecture, the last of the series
which has been sponsored by the Stan
ford Y.M.C.A. on origins and early his
tory of Christianity, will be given in the
lobby of the Old Union at 7 :30 Sunday
night.
A knowledge of the first century of
the religion is essential to the making of
a correct estimate of the extent to which
the modern church has departed from its
original forms, and from the teachings of
Jesus, Dr. McCowan believes. It was
during this century, while the new reli
gion was breaking with the Jews, and
before the establishment of the Roman
church, that there were the greatest op
portunities for changes in the church, and
it is this period of its history which is
veiled in the deepest obscurity.
Dr. McCowan has devoted his life to a
study of the early church, upon which
subject he has written several books. He
has spent one year of research in Pales
tine, and he will soon return there for a
two years' stay as head of a historical
research expedition.
