# Day Canyon Swept By Fire; Men Battle Aiding Winds

### 
SAN BERNARDINO, May 2. (£>)—
Southern California's first forest fire
of the season, which this afternoon
was reported out after sweeping
nearly four hundred acres of brush in
Day Canyon, tonight still was being
battled by a force of 125 men. A hot
dry wind, which had carried the blaze
rapidly up both walls of the San Ga
briel Mountains Canyon, rose again
late in the afternoon, demanding fresh
efforts by firefighters to confine the
flames to the burned area. Predictions
were made that it would be entirely
out by morning, the wind having died
out this evening.
