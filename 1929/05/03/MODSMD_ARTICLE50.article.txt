## Dr. W. F. Durand Discusses Aeronautics in Lecture At Eastern School 
### 
"Records in the field of aeronautics
have been made and broken so fre
quently within the last few years that
it is now natural to wonder what fac
tors determine the limits of perform
ance iu the air and what the actual
values of these limits are," said l)r.
W. F. Durand, professor emeritus of
Mechanical Engineering at Stanford
University, in a recent lecture at Cor
nell University according to the Cor
nell IXaily Sun.
Dr. Durand refuted the popular no
tion that greater advances in aviation
were mude during the World War than
at any other period in the history of
aviation by showing charts of records
made in the four fields —speed, dura
tion of flight, distance, and altitude.
According to recent calculations the
greatest speed at which a plane can
travel is about 380 miles per hour.
The present record is very near this
figure.
The altitude record is also very near
its probable limit but in contrast to
this highly developed phase, Dr. Du
land stated that there was consider
ably less development in the time and
distance records.
These approximations of the limits
of speed, distance, etc., are determined
by formulas based on factors such as
the inter-relation of speed and load,
propeller efficiency, and atmospheric
density. According to these, it is ob
vious that in the future there will be
some advancement in the field of aero
nautics, but that it has a definite
limit.
