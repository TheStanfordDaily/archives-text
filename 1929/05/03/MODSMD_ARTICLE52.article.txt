BERKELEY, May 2. (/!>) — Clark
Potter and George McDaniel, San
Francisco boys, have been named to
represent the University of California
in the Pacific Coast Conference inter
collegiate golf tournament at Seattle,
May 16 and 17.
The senior women will meet the
freshmen in the next track meet of
the series, scheduled for Monday af
ternoon. The seniors won their meet
with the sophomores by a score of 66
to 26. hut the freshmen gave the jun
iors a hard contest, losing by only
nine points, and will probably give
the 1929 team some stiff competition.
Kathorine Doyle, Thelma Patton,
and Lydia Bowen are each good for
at least two first places for the seniors.
Dorothy Sweet and Elinor Ophuls
have proved their ability to win points
for the freshmen. The records in the
shot put and the hurdles have both
been broken in practice, and new ones
will probably be set in the meet.
