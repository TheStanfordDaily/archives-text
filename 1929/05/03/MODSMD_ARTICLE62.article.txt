# MARVIN BREKENRIDGE DISCUSSES EUROPEAN TOURS AT STANFORD
## Special Summer Trips For 100 Students Planned By National Body 
### 
Special European tours which the
National Student Federation is plan
ning for this summer were the topic
of an informal talk given yesterday
by Marvin Brekenridge, advisory
American member of the International
Federation, who is visiting the cam
pus.
One hundred students are selected
from American universities each year,
and are then broken up into groups
of fifteen or less, to follow different
itineraries through Europe, according
to Miss Brekenridge. Everywhere they
travel they are conducted by student
guides, the tours lasting for two
months.
Miss Brekenridge recommended
that every American student who is
planning a European visit this sum
mer write to the headquarters of the
N.S.F.A. and obtain a student identifi
cation card. It makes possible free
visas in many of the countries and
special attention and information
from student headquarters.
Students for the N.S.F.A. tours are
recommended by the officers of their
own colleges. The total cost of their
tour, from the Eastern Coast, is 750
dollars. There are several places still
available for women students on the
British tour, and the German-Austrian
tour. The five-cities tour, London,
Brussels, Berlin, Vienna, Venice, has
several vacancies for men. Men should
see Ted Krougli for further informa
tion and women, Benetta Merner.
A convention of the N.S.F.A. will
be held on the Stanford campus from
January 1-4, next year.
