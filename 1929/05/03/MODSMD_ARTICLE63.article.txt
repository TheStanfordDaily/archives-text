NEW YORK, May 2. (/P) â€”A sur
vivor of the champagne and cocktail
era, the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel passed
out of existence at midnight to a toast
drunk in mineral water.
Two thousand guests attended the
final dinner in the grand ballroom.
The menu, an elaborate one, was
chosen and its its preparations and
service directed by Oscar Tschirky,
who as "Oscar of the Waldorf," had
earned a reputation that extends
around the world.
