# AMOROUS STRESSES NEED OF "TRIPLE THREAT" MEN IN MODERN INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS
## 
### 
"The automotive industry today is !
looking for triple-threat men," said I
Lieutenant-Colonel C. B. Amorous in
his talk yesterday before the Engi
neering School. "The man who can
combine engineering, financing, and ;
merchandising in a great manufactur
ing unit is the man who is wanted in
these days of mass production." "Any
industry can buy raw materials and
machines but brain-power is the one
thing that cannot be bought and that
is what the manufacturing world needs ,
! today." "A fifty-thousand-a-year man J
j can always find room at the top." Thus j
did he sum up the prime requisites :
for the man who is planning on enter- j
ing the manufacturing industry today.
Colonel Amorous gave three talks
on the campus yesterday. The first
was a non-technical lecture on the 1
needs of a young man who is planning 1
j on manufacturing, and particularly
automobile manufacturing, as a life
i work. The other addresses given in
! the afternoon and evening were pure-
I lv technical and concerned automotive
| design and the airplane engine of the
| future.
"The automotive industry," he said,
; "has made the most rapid advance of
| any industry in the history of our 1
; country. This is due mainly to the
; fact that there are no patents that
' one manufacturer can keep from an
| other. This industry is not perfect by
I a long ways yet but there is a con- |
j stant endeavor in that direction. Ma
j chines are almost perfect and it is the
! human element that must be worked
j on now. Automobile executives will
I consider the industry perfect on the !
1 day that the raw material can be put
j in one end of a factory and a finished
| machine taken out the other."
In discussing the future of airplane 1
engines, Colonel Amorous brought out |
some of the things that would have
to be overcome before much progress
could be made. "Altitude is the thing
that is holding up the parade," said
he. "When one considers the prob
lems various factors that are caused
by altitude he can easily see why this

j thing is so important. Engine cooling,
I carburation, temperature range, are
all factors due to altitude. The Mar
mon engineers do not feel today that
there is a suitable airplane motor for
; practical purposes. The great problem
'up to now has been the factor of
safety. Now that has been developed
;to a sufficiently high point and the
1 aviation world is now looking for de
-1 pendability and long life in its en
jgines. The average life of an airplane
, motor today is 200 hours. Obviously
! if the public is going to buy airplanes
the upkeep must be made much less."
A bill is now pending before the
Michigan legislature that would make
all fraternity and sorority property
tax exempt.
A new course in stage and truck line
j operation in California is being added
to the curriculum of the University of
' Southern California.

there is a suitable airplane motor for

"The automotive industry today is !
looking for triple-threat men," said I
Lieutenant-Colonel C. B. Amorous in
his talk yesterday before the Engi
neering School. "The man who can
combine engineering, financing, and ;
merchandising in a great manufactur
ing unit is the man who is wanted in
these days of mass production." "Any
industry can buy raw materials and
machines but brain-power is the one
thing that cannot be bought and that
is what the manufacturing world needs ,
! today." "A fifty-thousand-a-year man J
j can always find room at the top." Thus j
did he sum up the prime requisites :
for the man who is planning on enter- j
ing the manufacturing industry today.
Colonel Amorous gave three talks
on the campus yesterday. The first
was a non-technical lecture on the 1
needs of a young man who is planning 1
j on manufacturing, and particularly
automobile manufacturing, as a life
i work. The other addresses given in
! the afternoon and evening were pure-
I lv technical and concerned automotive
| design and the airplane engine of the
| future.
"The automotive industry," he said,
; "has made the most rapid advance of
| any industry in the history of our 1
; country. This is due mainly to the
; fact that there are no patents that
' one manufacturer can keep from an
| other. This industry is not perfect by
I a long ways yet but there is a con- |
j stant endeavor in that direction. Ma
j chines are almost perfect and it is the
! human element that must be worked
j on now. Automobile executives will
I consider the industry perfect on the !
1 day that the raw material can be put
j in one end of a factory and a finished
| machine taken out the other."
In discussing the future of airplane 1
engines, Colonel Amorous brought out |
some of the things that would have
to be overcome before much progress
could be made. "Altitude is the thing
that is holding up the parade," said
he. "When one considers the prob
lems various factors that are caused
by altitude he can easily see why this

j thing is so important. Engine cooling,
