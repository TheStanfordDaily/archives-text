The Barbarian baseball team de
feated the Theta Chi nine yesterday
in a typical intramural game of errors,
wild base running, and what not. The
winners used four pitchers during the
contest as compared to Theta Chi's
two. A home run by an unidentified
Barbarian provided the single feature
of the day. The losers loaded the bases
in the final canto, but lacked the
punch to put across the winning runs.
At the urge of a rabid Sequoia fan
to print the score of a game played
Wednesday afternoon, when all Daily
reporters were seriously laboring at
the Convalescent Home, the omission
will be remedied. It seems that Se
quoia took the measure of the Sigma

Nu outfit by a one-sided score, and
that the credit goes to one Tesche,
who pitched his team to a victory.
The high-score records of the indoor
baseball league suffered a severe set
back yesterday when the Sequoia in
door team defeated the Phi Kaps by
a score of 7 to 6. A sum total of seven
runs is the lowest score to date, to
win a ball game in the small diamond
organization. A wide edge in fielding
was responsible for the Sequoia win.
Two frosh outfits, Encina basement
and Encina 3 West, had an exciting
game, with the basement boys coming
out on top with a total of 17 runs. It
was a case of who could hit the ball
farthest, and Doub, Giberson, and
Hables hit it a long ways.
