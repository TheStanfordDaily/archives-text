### 
A new department of essays called
"Dissecting the Obvious" is one of the
distinguishing features of the May issue
of the Stanford Lit out Monday.
One of the essays appearing in this
number is Sturgis Riddle's "The Mucker
Poses among Collegians," to which there
are answers by Carroll O'Meara and
Professor Frederick Anderson. Winston
Norman has written ""Which Six and
Why," an essay in which he explains his
amplication of his "Daily Bullsession of
a few weeks ago in which he said that
four of the commandments should be
discarded.
There is also a technical article in
which Analyzed Rhyme, a new verse
form, is explained by Jean Rosenberg
and illustrated by two poems.
Thorington Putnam furnished the fron
tispiece, a linoleum cut of "Fisherman's
Wharf" in San Francisco. Short stories,
a one-act play, book reviews, and the
usual Green Street Theatre comment fill
the remainder of the magazine.
