# 'FIRST MILLION' MARK PASSED IN STANFORD ENDOWMENT DRIVE
## Persistent Efforts of Alumni Result in Subscription of $700,494.02; General Education Board to Add $300,000; 8-Year Drive Ended May 1 
### 
Stanford has raised the First Million.
The final check of figures indicates that the University's supporters exceeded
the $700,000 needed to match the $300,000 offered by the General Education Board
by $494.02. But it was only by hard, persistent work lasting far into the night of
the final day, Wednesday, May 1, that success was won.
On the morning of that day the amount was short by between six and seven
thousand dollars. A group of energetic local alumni and especially interested friends
of the University in Palo Alto undertook a final intensive personal campaign. At
dinner time, the figures showed that there was still missing the sum of $1635. This
same group redoubled its efforts and in the last desperate drive overshot the mark
by nearly $500.

' This brings to a close an effort that
was begun in 1921, following the offer
of the General Education Board, to gain
a million dollars, with the $300,000 co
operation of that national educational
foundation, to be devoted to the increase
of professors' salaries in five years.
Three times the Board has extended the
time given to the University in which to
raise the required $700,000, first to 1927,
then to 1928, and finally to May 1 of this
year.
The task of raising the fund was as
signed primarily to the alumni, but many
friends of the University not alumni, as
well as faculty members and students,
have very largely contributed.
The University put the salary increases
into effect a number of years ago, being
enabled to do so by the fact that the
General Education Board has been turn
ing over its pro rata share as rapidly as
the University raised funds through its
campaign.
