# ENCINA BOARD EIGHTEEN CENTS ABOVE OTHER CAMPOS CROUPS
## Daily Completes Comprehensive Investigation of Eating Conditions in Fraternities, Men's Clubs; Encina Charge Is $ 1.28 Per Day—Other Groups Charge $l. 10 Average 
### ALLAN HART 
Twenty-four fraternities and four men's eating club organizations on the campus
are now charging their boarders an average of eighteen cents a day less i>er man
tlian Encina Commons is charging, according to a survey just completed by tlie
Stanford Daily.
During the past six weeks the Daily has been interviewing the house managers
of all the fraternities on the campus, as well as the eating club managers, in an
attempt to learn wliat it was costing these living groups on the campus to serve

>first-class food to their boarders. The
results of this investigation appear in
itemized form in another place on this
page.
Encina Charges $1,275
The charge made by Encina Com
mons this year is $1,275 per day; this
is figured on a three-quarter basis —
$255 for approximately nine months
(200 days). This sum is collected ill
three payments of $85 each, at the
beginning of each quarter. The claim
that Encina is charging $1,349 per day
this quarter is incorrect. This is the
first year in which the Commons has
charged more than a dollar a day.
The Daily found that the other
men's living groups on the campus are
paying an average of $1,094 per day;
this price covers all the factors that
are covered by the Encina price.
"Results Mean Nothing"
Ernest S. Erwin, head of the audit
ing department of the University,
when told of the Daily's investigation,
said that the results would mean noth
| ing because the figures on the fraterni
ties could not be accurate. He named
four reasons why these figures could
not be said to prove anything. They
are: that the fraternities' books are not
sufficiently complete to include charg
es against the kitchen-dining room
department for such matters as rent.
! insurance, and other overhead; that
J house-managers charge their boarders
' on a check-book basis rather than on
J a balance-sheet basis —in other words,
they might have large bills outstand
ing downtown which would not be re
flected in their charges; that the fra
ternities do not serve as high quality
food as does Encina Commons; that
it is impossible to compare such prices
unless you compare every single item
and thus know that your figures in
cach case cover the same charges.
Objections Met J
The Daily found that about one
third of the house-managers, using
books required by their national or
ganizations, did make specific charges
for such matters as rent, depreciation,
j insurance, kitchen light, and other
overhead. For these houses, the figures
given are therefore quite complete and
j accurate. With the other houses, two
methods were used; in many cases
1 the charge made for board allowed an
jeasy profit each month, and this profit
was regularly turned itno a house
fund from which house charges were
paid. This profit thus paid the board
department's share of the deprecia
tion, rent, house insurance, and other
overhead. The other method used to
'cover these general charges was to
add to the actual price paid for board;
1 for Instance, one-fifth or one-sixth (as
the manager thought best) of the rent
paid by the house would be charged
to the dining room and kitchen, and
this amount would be added to the
per-day-per-man board charge. Thus in
' one of those three ways the Daily has
i made allowance with every house for
| rent, insurance, depreciation, and
other undistributed overhead.
It is the opinion of all the house
managers—all of whom claim that
they have no large debts outstanding
—that no fraternity could continue to
trade with any of the downtown mer
chants over a period of years with big
bills outstanding, and that these bills
(if any) would therefore necessarily
be reflected in the board charges.
Furthermore, the Daily did not And a
single house that did not have a fairly
complete and accurate set of books
upon the basis of which it made its
charges. Most national organizations
provide and require these books.
Daily Compares Food Costs
The Daily has carefully and accu
mtely compared the actual order
slips for groceries of the fraternities
and Encina Commons, and believes
that the fraternities average just as
high quality groceries as does the
Commons, if not a little higher.
The University auditor is correct
in claiming that the fraternities' fig
ures are not accurate to the exact
tenth of a cent. But the Daily has at
tempted to be very careful to include
in its figures all expenses that are
included in Encina's charge. In addi
tion, the figures for every house in

cline toward too high rather than too
low —when there was any doubt as to
which of several prices should be ac
cepted, the highest was invariably
chosen. For this reason the figures
presented are probably higher than
sufficient to cover the expenses, and
allow a little for a probable error.
The figures of the eating clubs
should be exactly comparable to that
of Encina Commons, since, being in
dependent of other house charges and
forced to meet specific overhead
charges, they are on the same basis
as Encina.

first year in which the Commons has
charged more than a dollar a day.
The Daily found that the other
men's living groups on the campus are
paying an average of $1,094 per day;
this price covers all the factors that
are covered by the Encina price.
"Results Mean Nothing"
Ernest S. Erwin, head of the audit
ing department of the University,
when told of the Daily's investigation,
said that the results would mean noth
| ing because the figures on the fraterni
ties could not be accurate. He named
four reasons why these figures could
not be said to prove anything. They
are: that the fraternities' books are not
sufficiently complete to include charg
es against the kitchen-dining room
department for such matters as rent.
! insurance, and other overhead; that
J house-managers charge their boarders
' on a check-book basis rather than on
J a balance-sheet basis —in other words,
they might have large bills outstand
ing downtown which would not be re
flected in their charges; that the fra
ternities do not serve as high quality
food as does Encina Commons; that
it is impossible to compare such prices
unless you compare every single item
and thus know that your figures in
cach case cover the same charges.
Objections Met J
The Daily found that about one
third of the house-managers, using
books required by their national or
ganizations, did make specific charges
for such matters as rent, depreciation,
j insurance, kitchen light, and other
overhead. For these houses, the figures
given are therefore quite complete and
j accurate. With the other houses, two
methods were used; in many cases
1 the charge made for board allowed an
jeasy profit each month, and this profit
was regularly turned itno a house
fund from which house charges were
paid. This profit thus paid the board
department's share of the deprecia
tion, rent, house insurance, and other
overhead. The other method used to
'cover these general charges was to
add to the actual price paid for board;
1 for Instance, one-fifth or one-sixth (as
the manager thought best) of the rent
paid by the house would be charged
to the dining room and kitchen, and
this amount would be added to the
per-day-per-man board charge. Thus in
' one of those three ways the Daily has
i made allowance with every house for
| rent, insurance, depreciation, and
other undistributed overhead.
It is the opinion of all the house
managers—all of whom claim that
they have no large debts outstanding
—that no fraternity could continue to
trade with any of the downtown mer
chants over a period of years with big
bills outstanding, and that these bills
(if any) would therefore necessarily
be reflected in the board charges.
Furthermore, the Daily did not And a
single house that did not have a fairly
complete and accurate set of books
upon the basis of which it made its
charges. Most national organizations
provide and require these books.
Daily Compares Food Costs
The Daily has carefully and accu
mtely compared the actual order
slips for groceries of the fraternities
and Encina Commons, and believes
that the fraternities average just as
high quality groceries as does the
Commons, if not a little higher.
The University auditor is correct
in claiming that the fraternities' fig
ures are not accurate to the exact
tenth of a cent. But the Daily has at
tempted to be very careful to include
in its figures all expenses that are
included in Encina's charge. In addi
tion, the figures for every house in

cline toward too high rather than too
low —when there was any doubt as to
which of several prices should be ac
cepted, the highest was invariably
chosen. For this reason the figures
presented are probably higher than
sufficient to cover the expenses, and
allow a little for a probable error.
The figures of the eating clubs
should be exactly comparable to that
of Encina Commons, since, being in
dependent of other house charges and
forced to meet specific overhead
charges, they are on the same basis
as Encina.
Twenty-four fraternities and four men's eating club organizations on the campus
are now charging their boarders an average of eighteen cents a day less i>er man
tlian Encina Commons is charging, according to a survey just completed by tlie
Stanford Daily.
During the past six weeks the Daily has been interviewing the house managers
of all the fraternities on the campus, as well as the eating club managers, in an
attempt to learn wliat it was costing these living groups on the campus to serve

>first-class food to their boarders. The
results of this investigation appear in
itemized form in another place on this
page.
Encina Charges $1,275
The charge made by Encina Com
mons this year is $1,275 per day; this
is figured on a three-quarter basis —
$255 for approximately nine months
(200 days). This sum is collected ill
three payments of $85 each, at the
beginning of each quarter. The claim
that Encina is charging $1,349 per day
this quarter is incorrect. This is the
first year in which the Commons has
charged more than a dollar a day.

The Daily found that about one
third of the house-managers, using
books required by their national or
ganizations, did make specific charges
for such matters as rent, depreciation,
j insurance, kitchen light, and other
overhead. For these houses, the figures
given are therefore quite complete and
j accurate. With the other houses, two
methods were used; in many cases
1 the charge made for board allowed an
jeasy profit each month, and this profit
was regularly turned itno a house
fund from which house charges were
paid. This profit thus paid the board
department's share of the deprecia
tion, rent, house insurance, and other
overhead. The other method used to
'cover these general charges was to
add to the actual price paid for board;
1 for Instance, one-fifth or one-sixth (as
the manager thought best) of the rent
paid by the house would be charged
to the dining room and kitchen, and
this amount would be added to the
per-day-per-man board charge. Thus in
' one of those three ways the Daily has
i made allowance with every house for
| rent, insurance, depreciation, and
other undistributed overhead.
It is the opinion of all the house
managers—all of whom claim that
they have no large debts outstanding
—that no fraternity could continue to
trade with any of the downtown mer
chants over a period of years with big
bills outstanding, and that these bills
(if any) would therefore necessarily
be reflected in the board charges.
Furthermore, the Daily did not And a
single house that did not have a fairly
complete and accurate set of books
upon the basis of which it made its
charges. Most national organizations
provide and require these books.
Daily Compares Food Costs
The Daily has carefully and accu
mtely compared the actual order
slips for groceries of the fraternities
and Encina Commons, and believes
that the fraternities average just as
high quality groceries as does the
Commons, if not a little higher.
The University auditor is correct
in claiming that the fraternities' fig
ures are not accurate to the exact
tenth of a cent. But the Daily has at
tempted to be very careful to include
in its figures all expenses that are
included in Encina's charge. In addi
tion, the figures for every house in

cline toward too high rather than too
low —when there was any doubt as to
which of several prices should be ac
cepted, the highest was invariably
chosen. For this reason the figures
presented are probably higher than
sufficient to cover the expenses, and
allow a little for a probable error.
The figures of the eating clubs
should be exactly comparable to that
of Encina Commons, since, being in
dependent of other house charges and
forced to meet specific overhead
charges, they are on the same basis
as Encina.
Twenty-four fraternities and four men's eating club organizations on the campus
are now charging their boarders an average of eighteen cents a day less i>er man
tlian Encina Commons is charging, according to a survey just completed by tlie
Stanford Daily.
During the past six weeks the Daily has been interviewing the house managers
of all the fraternities on the campus, as well as the eating club managers, in an
attempt to learn wliat it was costing these living groups on the campus to serve

>first-class food to their boarders. The
results of this investigation appear in
itemized form in another place on this
page.
Encina Charges $1,275
The charge made by Encina Com
mons this year is $1,275 per day; this
is figured on a three-quarter basis —
$255 for approximately nine months
(200 days). This sum is collected ill
three payments of $85 each, at the
beginning of each quarter. The claim
that Encina is charging $1,349 per day
this quarter is incorrect. This is the
first year in which the Commons has
charged more than a dollar a day.
The Daily found that the other
men's living groups on the campus are
paying an average of $1,094 per day;
this price covers all the factors that
are covered by the Encina price.
"Results Mean Nothing"
Ernest S. Erwin, head of the audit
ing department of the University,
when told of the Daily's investigation,
said that the results would mean noth
| ing because the figures on the fraterni
ties could not be accurate. He named
four reasons why these figures could
not be said to prove anything. They
are: that the fraternities' books are not
sufficiently complete to include charg
es against the kitchen-dining room
department for such matters as rent.
! insurance, and other overhead; that
J house-managers charge their boarders
' on a check-book basis rather than on
J a balance-sheet basis —in other words,
they might have large bills outstand
ing downtown which would not be re
flected in their charges; that the fra
ternities do not serve as high quality
food as does Encina Commons; that
it is impossible to compare such prices
unless you compare every single item
and thus know that your figures in
cach case cover the same charges.
