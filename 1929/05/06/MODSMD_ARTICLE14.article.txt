# ENCINA BOARD EIGHTEEN CENTS ABOVE OTHER CAMPOS CROUPS
## Daily Completes Comprehensive Investigation of Eating Conditions in Fraternities, Men's Clubs; Encina Charge Is $ 1.28 Per Day—Other Groups Charge $l. 10 Average 
### ALLAN HART 
Twenty-four fraternities and four men's eating club organizations on the campus
are now charging their boarders an average of eighteen cents a day less i>er man
tlian Encina Commons is charging, according to a survey just completed by tlie
Stanford Daily.
During the past six weeks the Daily has been interviewing the house managers
of all the fraternities on the campus, as well as the eating club managers, in an
attempt to learn wliat it was costing these living groups on the campus to serve

>first-class food to their boarders. The
results of this investigation appear in
itemized form in another place on this
page.
Encina Charges $1,275
The charge made by Encina Com
mons this year is $1,275 per day; this
is figured on a three-quarter basis —
$255 for approximately nine months
(200 days). This sum is collected ill
three payments of $85 each, at the
beginning of each quarter. The claim
that Encina is charging $1,349 per day
this quarter is incorrect. This is the
first year in which the Commons has
charged more than a dollar a day.
The Daily found that the other
men's living groups on the campus are
paying an average of $1,094 per day;
this price covers all the factors that
are covered by the Encina price.
"Results Mean Nothing"
Ernest S. Erwin, head of the audit
ing department of the University,
when told of the Daily's investigation,
said that the results would mean noth
| ing because the figures on the fraterni
ties could not be accurate. He named
four reasons why these figures could
not be said to prove anything. They
are: that the fraternities' books are not
sufficiently complete to include charg
es against the kitchen-dining room
department for such matters as rent.
! insurance, and other overhead; that
J house-managers charge their boarders
' on a check-book basis rather than on
J a balance-sheet basis —in other words,
they might have large bills outstand
ing downtown which would not be re
flected in their charges; that the fra
ternities do not serve as high quality
food as does Encina Commons; that
it is impossible to compare such prices
unless you compare every single item
and thus know that your figures in
cach case cover the same charges.
Objections Met J
The Daily found that about one
third of the house-managers, using
books required by their national or
ganizations, did make specific charges
for such matters as rent, depreciation,
j insurance, kitchen light, and other
overhead. For these houses, the figures
given are therefore quite complete and
j accurate. With the other houses, two
methods were used; in many cases
1 the charge made for board allowed an
jeasy profit each month, and this profit
was regularly turned itno a house
fund from which house charges were
paid. This profit thus paid the board
department's share of the deprecia
tion, rent, house insurance, and other
overhead. The other method used to
'cover these general charges was to
add to the actual price paid for board;
1 for Instance, one-fifth or one-sixth (as
the manager thought best) of the rent
paid by the house would be charged
to the dining room and kitchen, and
this amount would be added to the
per-day-per-man board charge. Thus in
' one of those three ways the Daily has
i made allowance with every house for
| rent, insurance, depreciation, and
