# The 						Commons High Price
## 
### 
An investigation of the files of the Daily over a period of more than
five years shows that dissatisfaction with the eating conditions at the
Encina Commons lias existed in varying degrees throughout the jjeriod.
This year has been no exception. The Daily has observed this fact
and has endeavored to find its basic causes. The thing that stands out
as the foremost cause of dissatisfaction is the price of board. This year
has seen the price rise higher than before. It is now $1,275 per day or
$255 for 200 days (three quarters).
The Daily believed that this price was too high for the food and
service given the men eating in the Commons. To ascertain whether or
not its belief was justified, a survey was made of all the men's organiza
tions on the campus. All twenty-eight were canvassed. In each instance
the price per day for board was figured to include the overhead of each
group. The result of the survey showed that the average daily cost per
man in the twenty-eight groups is $1,094. This leaves a difference of
eighteen cents between living groups price and Encina Commons price.
It is believed that the Encina Commons serve no better quality of
food than do the fraternities and eating clubs; comparison of grocery
slips substantiates this. A large overhead no doubt pushes the price up
a great deal, and yet is it to be concluded that high overhead and cost in
Encina Commons should be eighteen cents a day more than the average of
overhead and cost in twenty-eight living groups?
It is a complex problem, one that cannot be gone into in its many
ramifications by the Daily, yet this large difference points to a serious
fault somewhere. The Daily does not assume that it is competent to
investigate the matter comprehensively and point out all the causes that
bring about this high price, yet it has shown that the Encina Commons
is charging more than is consistent with fairness, for it cannot be
believed that the food and service obtained in all the living groups differs
so radically from that of the Encina Commons as the difference in price
would imply.
In short, Encina Commons is charging $1,275 per day for board that
is not so superior to that served by the living groups for $1,094 as to
justify this large difference in price.
