# International Paper Is Balked
## 
### 
The nation-wide reaction of disapprobation at the move made by
the International Paper and Power Company to buy the major interests
in eleven eastern daily newspapers is a healthy sign in the American
democracy. Undoubtedly it has been instrumental in checking that move.
No more deplorable thing could happen than the purchase and con
trol of that number of newspa{)ers by a power trust, a special interest.
The American press is one of the fundamental possessions of the
American people. It should be entirely free and untrammeled, catering
to none, representing all. The common welfare is its highest aim and
ideal and in the light of this how could it belong to a money interest and
fairly remain free? It couldn't. It has been said that, like the calf
which given enough rope, hangs itself, the special interest that buys a
paper and makes it its organ and champion loses public support and in
losing this kills itself. That may be so, yet there is every reason to
believe that the move of the International Paper and Power Trust would
be followed by other special interests and soon, the American people
without a free press would be forced to support the subsidized and
controlled press.
A controlled press! No more degrading thing could occur to Ameri
can journalism. So it is that the steps now being taken to keep the
International Paper and Power Company out of American journalism
are hailed as healthy signs. The American people realize the importance
of a free press and are ready to defend this right.
The Boston Herald, one of the dailies concerned, expounding the
transaction, said, "It had been felt that a close contact between a great
producer and a great consumer of white paper would work out to the
advantage of both companies, the readers of each newspai>er, and the
community."
If this expresses the Boston Herald's attitude toward journalism;
that is, that a newspaper is a "consumer of white paper," there is no
doubt that it willingly would allow itself to be bound and tied down by
a power trust such as the International Paper and Power Company. This
attitude is entirely lacking in the ideals, the desire to fight for public
welfare that motivate the independent American press. It is the attitude
of an old man grown too old to stand 011 his own feet and fight for
himself and so ready and willing to be taken into a haven of security,
subsidized at the expense of his own independence.
A trust-owned, monopolized press will mark the fall of democracy
and the rise of complete plutocracy. American citizens may well fight
and fight with conviction for their ..democratic right to a free press.

are hailed as healthy signs. The American people realize the importance
of a free press and are ready to defend this right.
The Boston Herald, one of the dailies concerned, expounding the
transaction, said, "It had been felt that a close contact between a great
producer and a great consumer of white paper would work out to the
advantage of both companies, the readers of each newspai>er, and the
community."
If this expresses the Boston Herald's attitude toward journalism;
that is, that a newspaper is a "consumer of white paper," there is no
doubt that it willingly would allow itself to be bound and tied down by
a power trust such as the International Paper and Power Company. This
attitude is entirely lacking in the ideals, the desire to fight for public
welfare that motivate the independent American press. It is the attitude
of an old man grown too old to stand 011 his own feet and fight for
himself and so ready and willing to be taken into a haven of security,
subsidized at the expense of his own independence.
A trust-owned, monopolized press will mark the fall of democracy
and the rise of complete plutocracy. American citizens may well fight
and fight with conviction for their ..democratic right to a free press.
The nation-wide reaction of disapprobation at the move made by
the International Paper and Power Company to buy the major interests
in eleven eastern daily newspapers is a healthy sign in the American
democracy. Undoubtedly it has been instrumental in checking that move.
No more deplorable thing could happen than the purchase and con
trol of that number of newspa{)ers by a power trust, a special interest.
The American press is one of the fundamental possessions of the
American people. It should be entirely free and untrammeled, catering
to none, representing all. The common welfare is its highest aim and
ideal and in the light of this how could it belong to a money interest and
fairly remain free? It couldn't. It has been said that, like the calf
which given enough rope, hangs itself, the special interest that buys a
paper and makes it its organ and champion loses public support and in
losing this kills itself. That may be so, yet there is every reason to
believe that the move of the International Paper and Power Trust would
be followed by other special interests and soon, the American people
without a free press would be forced to support the subsidized and
controlled press.
A controlled press! No more degrading thing could occur to Ameri
can journalism. So it is that the steps now being taken to keep the
International Paper and Power Company out of American journalism
are hailed as healthy signs. The American people realize the importance
of a free press and are ready to defend this right.
