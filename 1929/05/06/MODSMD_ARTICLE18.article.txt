# A 						Rejuvenated "Lit"

### 
Staging a conic back of sorts, the Stanford Literary Magazine appears
today under the guidance of its new editor, John Rogers, a rejuvenated
publication. Its career through the year has been one of violent purple
realism of the college sort and first-rate "tripishness." Today's edition
shows a variety of material, a better choice of material, the injection of
controversy, a Ixxiksholf of interest, and an editorial worth reading.
The Daily congratulates the new editor on his first issue.
