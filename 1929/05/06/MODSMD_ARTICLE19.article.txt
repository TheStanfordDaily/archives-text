IMPRESSIONS OF SOVIET RUSSIA
and the Revolutionary World. By
John Dewey. (New York: The New
Republic. $1.00.)
It is a curious fact that the philoso
pher of pragmatism has a boyish en
thusiasm for revolutions. He liked
the schoolboy revolutionists of China,
the Moslem revolutionists of Turkey,
the Indian revolutionists of Mexico,
and in Russia he hailed the psycho
logical revolution —"an enormous psy
chological experiment in transforming
the motives that inspire human con
duct." Ho felt for the first time "some
inkling of what may have been the
moving spirit and force of primitive
Christianity. He felt it particularly in
the schools. "There is no country,
unless it be possibly Mexico, where
the aesthetic aim and quality so dom
inate all things educational as in
Russia today." In these brief impres
sionistic reports of his wanderings in
revolutionary lands one discovers, not
a cautious professor of philosophy but
an eager experimenter, fascinated to
discover that at moments in history
human beings can escape the dead
ening effect of a machine society upon
the individual.
These are, after all, only sketches
for a new world, essentially the notes
of an enthusiastic, young-minded re
porter. What will happen when the
release of the moment is gone? John
Dewey offers no prophecy. There is
a passage in his chapter "Imperialism
Is Easy" in which he seems to feel the
inevitability of imperialistic control
of industrially backward countries.
Ha notes the difficulty of retaining
the rhythms of Indian pottery pat
terns as the standard of living of the
Mexican peon rises. He dreads the
day, "humanly inevitable," when the
new faith in Russia "will have faded
into the light of common day and be
come conventional and stereotyped."
Perhaps the book is more significant
as a revelation of John Dewey than
as a picture of Russia.

THE DISTANT STARS. By Elizabeth
Carfrae. (New York: Harper and
Brothers. $2.00.)
This is a complicated but highly
moral tale of the upper circles. Martin
Bradley, famous surgeon, marries
Barbara Jefferies, many years his
junior. They love each other with
great intensity, but Martin's time is
bo taken up with his surgery that,
more ingenuously than ingeniously,
he appoints his young assistant, Barry
Dexter, to act as his wife's escort on
the many occasions when he is called
to some patient. The expected does
not quite happen, but Martin thinks
it has, and divorces his innocent wife,
who, to add to the confusion, is, un
known to him, with child. After
many years of struggle he is, by a
series of remarkable coincidences,
brought face to face with his former
wife and his daughter, and there is a
reconciliation, in spite of the fact
that he is now a dope fiend. Miss
Carfrae shows considerable skill in
working out a plot that contains so
much misunderstanding and so little
misbehaving.

RENO. By Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr.
(New York: The Macaulay Com
pany. $2.00.)
The two hundred and fifty-one
pages of Cornelius Vanderbilt Jr.'s
novel, "Reno," do not realize the ex
pectations roused in the reader by the
lurid jacket and pale pink cover of
the book. Though the book is full of
action —of kidnapping and revenge, of
love and divorce and remarriage—it
practically preaches a moral. Details
of the divorce colony are given to
show conditions that should not ex
ist. And the heroine is as lovely, the
hero as clean-minded, as any heroine
and hero in any old-fashioned novel.
How certain Reno customs have be
come folkways is of interest, yet, on
the whole, the book lacks that quality
which makes people real and the
things that happen to them important.
"Reno" belongs to that class of nov
els in which the characters are play
things in events which do not grow
out of their personalities, but into
which they are plunged because the
author wants to tell a story.
STANFORD LITERARY MAGAZINE,
May, 1929.
We all like scraps and arguments —
anything and everything from dog
fights in front of the Library to the
World War. For that reason I like the
Lit for May, even though it is garbed
in a brilliant orange cover; and I
think you'll enjoy it too. (It goes on
Quad sale today. Adv.)
Sturgis Riddle, an old friend whom
ycu have probably met in the columns
of the Daily, hurls a vittriolic broad
side into the ranks of the college stu
dents with his article, "The Mucker
Pose Among Collegians." Riddle says,
' Something is wrong with the colle
giate altitude. —Just as the artificiali
ties of etiquette were cultivated in the
last century, so now, the mucker pose
is being universally assumed." He
says, for instance, that student con
versation is "vulgar, inane, and ster
ile." Some of Riddle's remarks are
sadly exaggerated, some of them sting

and are true enough to make the col
lege reader squirm uneasily. But "A
Professor Answers" and "In Defense
of Students" are two nicely handled
articles by Frederick Anderson and
Carroll O'Meara, respectively, which
take the other side of the issue. They
make a noble attempt to exonerate
Joe College. Decide for yourself
whether or not they succeed.
And then there is the reviewer
(M. K.) who has decided opinions of
his own. He thinks Thomas Hardy's
poetry is worth reading only "as a
freak of literature" and he calls it
"hopelessly stupid, endlessly detailed,
filled with bad meters, worse rhym
ings, and uninteresting subject mat
ter."
M. K., this same reviewer, then pro
ceeds to tear to pieces "Boston" by
Upton Sinclair. He thinks that "most
of the book is written in unintelligible
Italo-English accents, and the rest of
it is amazing for its poor construction
and bad composition." All of this
opinion is, to say the least, independ
ent, in view of the fact that "Boston"
is a closer runner-up for the Pulitzer
award, and many people think it would
win if it were not quite so Socialistic.
The stories in the magazine are
well-balanced as to subject matter, al
though none of them are "outstanding
literature."
Years ago I said I would tear out
my hair if I ever read another poem
about the fog. But I take it back,
for the current Lit contains two
poems by Jean Rosenberg on that
well-worn old subject that I wish to
commend. They are in analyzed rhyme
(the Lit will tell you what it is). Here
is the first:
Fog in the City
"The fog, half smoke, hovered and
dripped
Over the city, The lights were lost
Within a drowsy mist.
Their quivering reflections dropped
And left a shimmering mark
On the oiled streets wet and dark."
—Clifford F. Weigle.
