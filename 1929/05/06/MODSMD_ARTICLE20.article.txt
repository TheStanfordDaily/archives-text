Without further ado, we present —
VARIATIONS on
FAVORITE THEMES

"Barbara Frietchie"
Up from the meadows filled with corn
Hot after May's sweet smelling mom
The A.T.O.'s quite knee deep stand
In hay (hey hey)—a motley band.
. . . All night long in Alpha's halls
Sounded loud screams and raucous
calls
All night long (or thereabouts)
Folks were smashed by sliding louts.

"Shoot if you must this awful etuff
But leave the green—go in the
rough"
A shade of sadness, a blush of shame?
The dance is known for lack of
same.
Ever jazz rhythms rose and fell
Over the mob that loved them well
And some hours later, feeling "right"
Folks tumbled out into the night.
A.T.O.'s barn dance is o'er
And hay wagons gather hay no more
Honor to hicks! and let a tear
Fall for Sweet Peace in Menlo Beer.
"Little Boy Blue"
The rough Phi Delt is covered with
dust
But sturdy and staunch he stands
And the rambling old house is covered
with must
And the paint is peeling in strands.
Time was when the rambling old
house was gay
And the Rushing was crashing
through
Ah them was (he days! And to look
back today
Is what makes our Little Boy Blue.
"The Chambered Nautilus"
. . . Build thee more stately mansions,
Alpha Sig!
Although thy house is big
Its shell is oh so thin.
And those worn creaking walls that
shake within
Will soon collapse, making a hollow
din
Leaving a matchless view
'Twixt Chinese Club and dear old
Delta U.
