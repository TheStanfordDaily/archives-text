# Motion Pictures Used By Stanford In Studying Horses 50 Years Ago
## 
### 
Slow motion pictures for the study
of rapidly moving objects are sup
posed to be a fairly recent invention,
but Senator Stanford used this device,
or one very much like it, to study the
paces of his trotting horses over fifty
years ago.
Stanford had for a long time be
lieved that the prevailing theories of
animal motion were wrong. Among
other things in contradiction to the
theories then existing he believed a
trotting horse raises all four feet
from the ground during the cycle of
its motion. A friend of his placed a
bet of $25,000 against him that this
was not so.
Senator Stanford persuaded E. J.
Muybridge, a noted photographer in
action picture work, to take a series
of instantaneous pictures of horses in
motion to determine whether or not
his theories were correct.
The series of experiments which
followed resulted in important
changes in the theories of animal mo
tion. The existing laws were proved
to be wrong and many pictures and
statues depicting horses in motion
were proved to be erroneous.
Senator Wins Bet
Stanford won his bet, but only after
he had paid about $12,000 for appa
ratus. Another fact, however, of equal
importance, was that the pictures
taken enabled Stanford to study the
paces of his horses so minutely that
he was able to train and balance them
so as to attain the maximum speed.
Tho results were astonishing. Stanford
horses held the world's championship
for many years. So fast were his trot
ting horses that cases have been re
ported where they were ruled off of
southern tracks because they spoiled
the competition.
The first experiments were con
ducted by Muybridge in 1872. In the
beginning only a single camera was
used. A great number of instantane
ous pictures were taken of Occident,
a famous trotting horse. Several of
these showed the horse with all four
feet off the ground while trotting.
These pictures proved that a fast
trotting horse has all four feet off
the ground twice during a complete
set of motion. They were received
throughout the world with astonish
ment and incredulity.^
Further Experiments
So successful were there first ex
periments that when Muybridge re
turned to California in 1878, Senator
Stanford determined to carry out a
more extensive series of experiments.
This time, instead of one camera, a
row of twelve cameras was used. The
cameras were placed along the track
at a distance of twenty-one inches
apart. Numbers were placed along the
track so that each picture had a defi
nite number. The shutters were re
leased one after the other in rapid
succession by a clockwork. The pic
tures were taken against a white
background so that the moving horses
appeared as silhouettes.
The method of making the expo
sures was later changed. Wires con
nected with each shutter were
stretched across a groove in the track.
The sulky wheel passing through the
groove over the wires released the
shutters in succession as the horse
passed before them. Later the shut
ters were opened by a series of
threads, stretched a height of four
feet across the track which, when the
horse touched them, pulled an elec
trical contact closed thus causing an
electromagnet to release the shutter.
The threads were thin enough so that
they broke without wounding the
horse. The number of cameras was
also increased to twenty-four and the
distance between them decreased to
twelve inches.
Twenty-Four Cameras
The whole series of pictures was

taken in less than a second, and be- J
cause they show successive stages of j
motion they are exactly similar to |
modern motion picture films. The only 1
difference was that twenty-four fixed
cameras were used instead of one j
camera with a moving film. Muybridge
later applied the idea obtained from
these pictures to the invention of the
motion picture machine. The pictures
were projected in a zoetrope.
The copy of the book by Stillman
entitled "The Horse in Motion" and
a complete collection of the photo
graphs by Muybridge are to be found
among the personal belongings of the
Stanford family in the museum.

cause they show successive stages of j
motion they are exactly similar to |
modern motion picture films. The only 1
difference was that twenty-four fixed
cameras were used instead of one j
camera with a moving film. Muybridge
later applied the idea obtained from
these pictures to the invention of the
motion picture machine. The pictures
were projected in a zoetrope.
The copy of the book by Stillman
entitled "The Horse in Motion" and
a complete collection of the photo

Slow motion pictures for the study
of rapidly moving objects are sup
posed to be a fairly recent invention,
but Senator Stanford used this device,
or one very much like it, to study the
paces of his trotting horses over fifty
years ago.
Stanford had for a long time be
lieved that the prevailing theories of
animal motion were wrong. Among
other things in contradiction to the
theories then existing he believed a
trotting horse raises all four feet
from the ground during the cycle of
its motion. A friend of his placed a
bet of $25,000 against him that this
was not so.
Senator Stanford persuaded E. J.
Muybridge, a noted photographer in
action picture work, to take a series
of instantaneous pictures of horses in
motion to determine whether or not
his theories were correct.
The series of experiments which
followed resulted in important
changes in the theories of animal mo
tion. The existing laws were proved
to be wrong and many pictures and
statues depicting horses in motion
were proved to be erroneous.
Senator Wins Bet
Stanford won his bet, but only after
he had paid about $12,000 for appa
ratus. Another fact, however, of equal
importance, was that the pictures
taken enabled Stanford to study the
paces of his horses so minutely that
he was able to train and balance them
so as to attain the maximum speed.
Tho results were astonishing. Stanford
horses held the world's championship
for many years. So fast were his trot
ting horses that cases have been re
ported where they were ruled off of
southern tracks because they spoiled
the competition.
The first experiments were con
ducted by Muybridge in 1872. In the
beginning only a single camera was
used. A great number of instantane
ous pictures were taken of Occident,
a famous trotting horse. Several of
these showed the horse with all four
feet off the ground while trotting.
These pictures proved that a fast
trotting horse has all four feet off
the ground twice during a complete
set of motion. They were received
throughout the world with astonish
ment and incredulity.^
Further Experiments
So successful were there first ex
periments that when Muybridge re
turned to California in 1878, Senator
Stanford determined to carry out a
more extensive series of experiments.
This time, instead of one camera, a
row of twelve cameras was used. The
cameras were placed along the track
at a distance of twenty-one inches
apart. Numbers were placed along the
track so that each picture had a defi
nite number. The shutters were re
leased one after the other in rapid
succession by a clockwork. The pic
tures were taken against a white
background so that the moving horses
appeared as silhouettes.
The method of making the expo
sures was later changed. Wires con
nected with each shutter were
stretched across a groove in the track.
The sulky wheel passing through the
groove over the wires released the
shutters in succession as the horse
passed before them. Later the shut
ters were opened by a series of
threads, stretched a height of four
feet across the track which, when the
horse touched them, pulled an elec
trical contact closed thus causing an
electromagnet to release the shutter.
The threads were thin enough so that
they broke without wounding the
horse. The number of cameras was
also increased to twenty-four and the
distance between them decreased to
twelve inches.

passed before them. Later the shut
ters were opened by a series of
threads, stretched a height of four
feet across the track which, when the
horse touched them, pulled an elec
trical contact closed thus causing an
electromagnet to release the shutter.
The threads were thin enough so that
they broke without wounding the
horse. The number of cameras was
also increased to twenty-four and the
distance between them decreased to
twelve inches.
Twenty-Four Cameras
The whole series of pictures was

taken in less than a second, and be- J
cause they show successive stages of j
motion they are exactly similar to |
modern motion picture films. The only 1
difference was that twenty-four fixed
cameras were used instead of one j
camera with a moving film. Muybridge
later applied the idea obtained from
these pictures to the invention of the
motion picture machine. The pictures
were projected in a zoetrope.
The copy of the book by Stillman
entitled "The Horse in Motion" and
a complete collection of the photo
graphs by Muybridge are to be found
among the personal belongings of the
Stanford family in the museum.
