# MODEL "A" ROADSTER APPEALS TO YOUTH
## 
### 
"Youth has been served ideally in
the realm of motor cars by the Model
"A" Ford roadster," said Walter G.
Bernthal, local Ford dealer, in com
menting on the present day tendency
of a great many families to provide
a motor car for every member.
"Adults of today have come to
recognize," said Mr. Berntlial," that
youth is just as important a period
in life as maturity. We have it but
once, and its problems are even more
vital than those of our seasoned years.
Time is as real a factor to youth as
to age, and the young man and young
woman are as interested in quick
transportation as are their elders.
"The Ford Roadster is an automo
bile that is well adapted for adults,
either for pleasure or business pur
poses, having the quickness in traffic,
the speed, comfort, and stability that
characterize the new Ford. But it pos
sesses also the freedom and exhilara
tion of the open car on the open road,
and because of the ease with which it
may be handled, is an ideal car for the
younger members of the family.
"It should be borne in mind that
large numbers of young men and
young women of the present day are
excellent automobile' drivers, having
dexterity and quickened reactions
from their athletic contests that many
adults do not possess. Due to the
trend to a larger number of motor cars
for the family, it is expected that the
Ford roadster will be one of the popu
lar Ford types during the coming va
cation period.
"The roadster is available in differ
ent colors, has the quick collapsing
top that may be handled easily by
one person, and a wide, comfortable
seat. The roadster is available with a
rumble seat at extra cost."
