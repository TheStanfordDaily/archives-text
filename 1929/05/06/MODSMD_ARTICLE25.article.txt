# SPORTS OF 1929
## A 						Cleveland Clouter 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Did you ever hear of a Scotch In
dian? No, I don't mean the one who
put a hot brick in his hat "to keep his
wig-warm," but a baseball player of
Scottish descent who patrols the out
field for the Cleveland Indians. Ar
riving in this world on February 7,
1893, exactly one year to the day be
fore Babe Ruth, Charles D. Jamieson
is proud of his Scottish ancestry, and
proud of his record as a baseball
player.
In fourteen years of service with
Washington, Philadelphia, and Cleve
land, Charley has played in more than
1,500 games, scored more than 930
runs and knocked out 1,760 hits. In
this period, too, he stole 124 bases,
and bis batting average hovered
above the .300 mark most of the time;
in fact, it reached .358 in 1924, and
his lifetime figure to date is .305. But

it Is his 1929 average that "Good
Time Charley" is especially proud of.
In the first figures released on Mon
day morning, April 22, there was
"Jamie" right at the top of the Amer
ican League's five leading batsmen,
with a mark of .583 compiled by
smacking out seven hits in twelve
times at bat in the first four games
of the season. A certain not-unknown
gentleman named Hornsby had ex
actly the same average in the older
circuit,
Charley is as left-handed as they
moke 'em, in batting, throwing, and
eating. He is 5 feet 8 inches tall and
weighs 165 pounds, and, if he has his
greatest season in his thirty-seventh
year, it will be something for all good
Scotch-Indians to celebrate, even to
â€¢ lie extent of spending some real mon
ey for fire-water!
