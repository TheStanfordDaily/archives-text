# CARD SOCCER PLAYERS HOLD S.F. BARBARIANS TO TIE IN FAST GAME
## 
### 
Excellent defensive play enabled
Stanford's soccer varsity to hold the
Barbarians, semi-finalists in the San
Francisco Football League, to a 2-2
tie in a game played here Saturday
afternoon. Score at half time was 2-0
in favor of the Cardinals.
Making the most of their opportuni
ties, the Stanford forward line kicked
two goals during the first half, al
though on only three occasions were
they in a position to score. Play
throughout the game was chiefly con
fined to Stanford territory, but the
brilliant work of Ed Robinson, Cardi
nal goalkeeper, and of the Stanford
fullbacks, Wittausch, Burns; half
during most of the contest.
Next Saturday the varsity will meet
the Rovers, another San Francisco
club team.

Lineups for the Barbarian game
were as follows:
Stanford — Goalkeeper, Robinson;
fullbcaks, Wittausch, Burns; half
hacks, Captain Mayer, Reynolds,
