# WOMEN'S INTERCLASS TRACK MEET BETWEEN SENIORS, 1932, TODAY
## 
### 
Several new records will probably
be made in the women's track meet
this afternoon between the seniors
and the freshmen. Lydia Bowen has
been putting the shot over thirty feet
consistently in practice, and has twice
set the record, once last year at 31
feet 5% inches, and again a week ago
at 31 feet 6 inches. She hopes to
raise it again today.
Thelma Patton and Katherine
Doyle, who took second and third re
spectively in the hurdles at the A.A.U.
meet at San Francisco Saturday, have
both been running the high hurdles
in record time. Last spring Patton
broke the women's world record for
the event repeatedly. If she runs the
event this afternoon it will be her
first interclass hurdles competition
this season, and her teammate, Doyle,
will doubtless give her a hard fight
for first place.
The freshmen have not been in prac
tice long enough to make any record
breaking scores, but they have a
strong team, headed by Captain Dor
othy Sweet and Elinor Ophuls, and
will give the seniors some strong com
petition for high score honors.
The requirements lor a modern col
lege president are outlined by the
Michigan Daily thus: "what Michigan
needs in the chair is a scholar, poli
tician, diplomat, and glorified travel
ing salesman at a modest salary."
