# Orange Colored "Lit" Will Be On Campus Sale Today
## 
### 
Sincerely believing that loud and
flashy colors go hand in hand with
spring, and overcome with the many
popples in bloom and the thought of
returning southward after the final
examinations, the Lit staff offer, this
morning an orange Lit, the fifth issuo
of the year. The usual price of 25
cents will prevail at all Quad news
stands.
The May contribution of Stanford's
literati contains more articles than
any other issue this year, including a
new essay department. The usual
Green Street Theatre review as well
as reviews on other theatres may be
found, and there are a number of
book reviews.
