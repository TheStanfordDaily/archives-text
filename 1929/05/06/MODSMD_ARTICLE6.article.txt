# Germans, Britons Japanese Accept Young Agreement
## Proposed Plan Will Lower Reparations of Both France, Belgium 
### 
PARIS, May 5. (/P) â€”The repara
tions settlement shoe is now on the
other foot, and it is chafing the
French press. Germany, England, and
Japan have accepted the compromise
evolved by Owen D. Young just as
failure appeared to stare the commit
tee of experts in the face. Two weeks
ago the fate of the conference rested
on the Germans, now upon the verdict
of the French and Belgian delegations
on Tuesday depends whether the
knotty question is definitely settled
at this time.
The memorandum of Mr. Young
was concluded in all its details late
this afternoon. Tomorrow morning,
together with the German note indi
cating acceptance of it with certain
reservations, it will be distributed to
all members of the experts committee.
Each delegation will then begin separ
ate study so as to be in position to
discuss both documents on Tuesday.
The solution proposed by Mr. Young
and the American delegation means
another appreciable concession and
loss to both France and Belgium as
compared with their lowest figures
presented to the conference chairman
some weeks ago. The atmosphere in
reparations circles this evening indi
cated that both France and Belgium
were none too favorable to this solu
tion. French circles felt that they had
been maneuvered by Dr. HJalmar
Schacht, chief of the German dele
gation. They said it would be an error
to interpret the spirit of conciliation
in France for one of renuciation.
The French point out that under
the Allied memorandum presented
three weeks ago France would receive
8,000,000,000 gold marks while under
the "German-American" figures, as
the Young proposal is popularly
termed, she would get only 5,500,000,-
000. Translated into the paper franc
this means a formidable looking re
duction figure of 15,000,000,000 francs.
