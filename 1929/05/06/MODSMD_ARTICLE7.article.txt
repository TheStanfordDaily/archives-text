siege in two suburbs of the capital
was in no way relaxed tonight al
though the day passed without fur

scattered shots in the early hours be

which in four days from May Day had
brought death to 27 persons and seri
ous wounds to hundreds.

Strong police cordons today still
encircled the districts of Neukoelin
and Wedding and barbed wire ob
structions still closed the areas.
