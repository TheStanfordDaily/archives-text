# Seat Sale For "Moving On," Junior Opera, Will Take Place Tomorrow
## 
### 
Seat sale for the Junior Opera,
"Moving On," to be presented May
11, will be held tomorrow at 1 o'clock,
a3 usual in front of the Women's
Clubhouse â€”but, at any time Tuesday
from noon till one, the campus may
expect to be startled, alarmed, sur
prised, noncomplussed, shocked, and
educated by a prodigious and extra
ordinary mystery to be conducted un
der the auspices of the Maxwell Cir
cus. No manager can be found that
will affirm the rumors but students
are warned to eat their lunch late, so
they may be on hand for any miracles.
Three times as harmonious as any
past Junior Opera, the score for
"Moving On," will achieve an effect
unique in campus productions. The
co-authors of the music, Griff Williams,
Neal Spaulding, and George Starbird,
have emphasized arrangement and
harmony rather than single-feature
numbers. With ten fine songs the in
novation of a men's chorus, singing
three-part harmony, a men's trio and
a women's trio, a men's quartette, and
a banjo chorus of ten, will find a
wealth of opportunity for popular ef
fect.
In general the music is a combina
tion between an operetta and the
usual run of musical comedy songs,
following the modern trend of such
successes as "The Desert Song" and
"The Student Prince." Another un
usual feature is that the music has
been adaptod to the mood and dra
matic exigencies of the libretto rather

than the plot adjusted to the numbers
at hand.
"Moving On," the fast moving
whoopee theme song, will feature the
banjo chorus, as well as several good
finales. "The Tent Song," with the
men's chorus singing three-part har
mony, will be another of the numbers
that should be popular. The whole
song in arrangement follows the chan
tey tradition, with bass accompani
ment imitating the pound of hammers
and sledges in tho rising of a circus
big top.
"Living In A Tent" should be an
other favorite. Introduced by Tom
Watt, with the men's chorus humming
tenor harmony, an Oriental dance with
the women's chorus builds up to an
Oriental solo by Francos Boone, one
of tho highlights of tho program. "A
Freak Song" will feature the Stanford
Glee Club quartette.
The two love songs are expected to
soothe every broken heart on the cam
pus. Both of them follow the new
trend in popular music of strong lyric
appeal and emphasis on melody and
harmony. The disappointment num
ber, "A Cloud Passed Over the Moon,"
will be sung by the men's chorus a
capello and Tom Watt. It is a long
song of varying tempo with a short
refrain In waltz time, corresponding
to the type of "Deep In My Heart."
"Our Love Is Tangled in Moonbeams,"
introduced by Helen Ward and Tom
Watt, will bo sung with the men's and
women's trios.
