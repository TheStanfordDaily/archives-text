# CARDS WIN P. A. TITLE FROM O.C. TEAM, 80 TO 72
## Olympic Club Sprinter Runs Century in 9 2-5 S. To Defeat Hec Dyer 
### Frank Whiteley 
Notwithstanding a handicap of com
peting in four non-collegiate events
in which it picked up only two points,
Stanford's varsity track and field team
scored an 80 to 72 victory over the
Olympic Club in the Annual Pacific
Association championships in the
Kezar Stadium at San Francisco Sat
urday. One world's record and a Pa
cific Coast mark were bettered,
Itussell Sweet, former Montana
sprinter now running for the Winged
O, provided the thrill of the meet
when he led Hec Dyer of Stanford to
the tape in the century in 9 2-5 s., one
fifth of a second faster than the
recognized world's record. Sweet was
aided by a strong wind at his back,
so the record will not be counted. The
Olympic runner got away to a perfect
start and had a three-yard lead on
Dyer all the way to the finish. Dyer
came back in the 220-yard dash with
a clean-cut win over Sweet in the fast
time of 21 3-5 s.
Kelley Breaks Record
Bob Kelley, veteran San Francisco
mail man and for nine consecutive
years winner of the P.A. title in the
hop, step, and jump, made it ten
straight Saturday and in so doing
broke his own Pacific Coast record by
almost a foot. His winning jump, if it
can bo called a jump, measured 49 ft.
1 1-8 in. Bob Patton of California was
second, with Martin of the Olympics
third, and Anderson of Stanford
fourth.
In the four non-collegiate events —
the 16-pound hammer throw, the 56-
pcund weight throw, the 5-mile run,
and the hop, step, and jump—the
Olympics scored 30 points. Anderson's
fourth in the hop, step, and jump and
Carley's fourth in the 5-mile run were
the Cards' only points in these events.
Kibby and Sparling of Stanford par
tially evened things up with Captain
Curtice of California in the javelin,
the two Cards taking first and second,
and the Bear, who placed ahead of
them in the Big Meet, only getting
fourth. Baxter, another Californian,
was third. Kibby's winning toss was
203 ft. 2 in.
Storie Takes 880
Bill Storie, former Stanford star and
Olympic Club captain, surprised every
one to finish first in the half-mile,
