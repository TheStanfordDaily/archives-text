# CARDS WIN P. A. TITLE FROM O.C. TEAM, 80 TO 72
## Olympic Club Sprinter Runs Century in 9 2-5 S. To Defeat Hec Dyer 
### Frank Whiteley 
Notwithstanding a handicap of com
peting in four non-collegiate events
in which it picked up only two points,
Stanford's varsity track and field team
scored an 80 to 72 victory over the
Olympic Club in the Annual Pacific
Association championships in the
Kezar Stadium at San Francisco Sat
urday. One world's record and a Pa
cific Coast mark were bettered,
Itussell Sweet, former Montana
sprinter now running for the Winged
O, provided the thrill of the meet
when he led Hec Dyer of Stanford to
the tape in the century in 9 2-5 s., one
fifth of a second faster than the
recognized world's record. Sweet was
aided by a strong wind at his back,
so the record will not be counted. The
Olympic runner got away to a perfect
start and had a three-yard lead on
Dyer all the way to the finish. Dyer
came back in the 220-yard dash with
a clean-cut win over Sweet in the fast
time of 21 3-5 s.
Kelley Breaks Record
Bob Kelley, veteran San Francisco
mail man and for nine consecutive
years winner of the P.A. title in the
hop, step, and jump, made it ten
straight Saturday and in so doing
broke his own Pacific Coast record by
almost a foot. His winning jump, if it
can bo called a jump, measured 49 ft.
1 1-8 in. Bob Patton of California was
second, with Martin of the Olympics
third, and Anderson of Stanford
fourth.
In the four non-collegiate events —
the 16-pound hammer throw, the 56-
pcund weight throw, the 5-mile run,
and the hop, step, and jump—the
Olympics scored 30 points. Anderson's
fourth in the hop, step, and jump and
Carley's fourth in the 5-mile run were
the Cards' only points in these events.
Kibby and Sparling of Stanford par
tially evened things up with Captain
Curtice of California in the javelin,
the two Cards taking first and second,
and the Bear, who placed ahead of
them in the Big Meet, only getting
fourth. Baxter, another Californian,
was third. Kibby's winning toss was
203 ft. 2 in.
Storie Takes 880
Bill Storie, former Stanford star and
Olympic Club captain, surprised every
one to finish first in the half-mile,
running the distance in competition
for the first time in his career. A
splendid driving finish enabled him to
win by three yards from Alex McKin
non of Stanford.
Captain Ross Nichols had a hard
time of it beating his teammate, Podge
Smith, in the high hurdles, breaking
the tape only a yard ahead of the
Card sophomore in a 15 s. race. A
little later in the afternoon Smith
pushed Edmonds all the way in the
low barriers. Ward's time wan
24 4-5 s. Edmonds, of course, was
high-point man of the day, taking a
first in the pole vault as well. His
height in this event was 13 ft. Huls
man of Stanford was second, Ouerra
of the Olympic Club third, and Berry
of the Cards fourth.
Krenz Wins Discua
Eric Krenz had little trouble win
ning the discus with a long throw of
154 ft. 6 in. One of his throws bettered
the 160-foot mark; but Krenz was
ruled to have fouled; and it was not
counted. Following Krenz in order
were Kleckner of St. Ignatius College,
and Rothert and Tandy of Stanford.
The Cards scored a clean sweep in
the shot, winning all four places.
Rothert took first with a heave of 49
ft. 6% in., Krenz, Forster, and Way
taking the remaining places.
Morrison ran a nice lap in the quar
ter-mile to finish ahead of Storie of
the Club in 49 1-5 s. Shove was third
and Syer fourth.
Harry Carter and Red Mossman of
California provided a pretty race in
the mile, running evenly almost to the
finish line. Carter's final sprint proved
too much for the Bear sophomore, and
the former won by a slight margin in
4:33 2-5 8.
In the team competition California
finished third with 19 points, St. Igna
tius placing fourth with 5 points.

in which it picked up only two points,
Stanford's varsity track and field team
scored an 80 to 72 victory over the
Olympic Club in the Annual Pacific
Association championships in the
Kezar Stadium at San Francisco Sat
urday. One world's record and a Pa
cific Coast mark were bettered,
Itussell Sweet, former Montana
sprinter now running for the Winged
O, provided the thrill of the meet
when he led Hec Dyer of Stanford to
the tape in the century in 9 2-5 s., one
fifth of a second faster than the
recognized world's record. Sweet was
aided by a strong wind at his back,
so the record will not be counted. The
Olympic runner got away to a perfect
start and had a three-yard lead on
Dyer all the way to the finish. Dyer
came back in the 220-yard dash with
a clean-cut win over Sweet in the fast
time of 21 3-5 s.
Kelley Breaks Record

third, and Anderson of Stanford
fourth.

pcund weight throw, the 5-mile run,

Olympics scored 30 points. Anderson's
fourth in the hop, step, and jump and
Carley's fourth in the 5-mile run were
the Cards' only points in these events.
Kibby and Sparling of Stanford par
tially evened things up with Captain
Curtice of California in the javelin,

them in the Big Meet, only getting
fourth. Baxter, another Californian,
was third. Kibby's winning toss was
203 ft. 2 in.
Storie Takes 880
Bill Storie, former Stanford star and
Olympic Club captain, surprised every
one to finish first in the half-mile,
running the distance in competition
for the first time in his career. A

win by three yards from Alex McKin
non of Stanford.
Captain Ross Nichols had a hard
time of it beating his teammate, Podge
Smith, in the high hurdles, breaking
the tape only a yard ahead of the
Card sophomore in a 15 s. race. A
little later in the afternoon Smith
pushed Edmonds all the way in the
low barriers. Ward's time wan
24 4-5 s. Edmonds, of course, was
high-point man of the day, taking a
first in the pole vault as well. His
height in this event was 13 ft. Huls
man of Stanford was second, Ouerra
of the Olympic Club third, and Berry
of the Cards fourth.

Eric Krenz had little trouble win
ning the discus with a long throw of
154 ft. 6 in. One of his throws bettered

the shot, winning all four places.

ter-mile to finish ahead of Storie of
the Club in 49 1-5 s. Shove was third
and Syer fourth.
Harry Carter and Red Mossman of
California provided a pretty race in
the mile, running evenly almost to the
finish line. Carter's final sprint proved
too much for the Bear sophomore, and
the former won by a slight margin in
4:33 2-5 8.
In the team competition California
finished third with 19 points, St. Igna

in which it picked up only two points,
Stanford's varsity track and field team
scored an 80 to 72 victory over the
Olympic Club in the Annual Pacific
Association championships in the
Kezar Stadium at San Francisco Sat
urday. One world's record and a Pa
cific Coast mark were bettered,

sprinter now running for the Winged
O, provided the thrill of the meet
when he led Hec Dyer of Stanford to
the tape in the century in 9 2-5 s., one
fifth of a second faster than the
recognized world's record. Sweet was
aided by a strong wind at his back,
so the record will not be counted. The
Olympic runner got away to a perfect
start and had a three-yard lead on
Dyer all the way to the finish. Dyer
came back in the 220-yard dash with
a clean-cut win over Sweet in the fast

fourth in the hop, step, and jump and

the Club in 49 1-5 s. Shove was third
and Syer fourth.
Harry Carter and Red Mossman of
California provided a pretty race in
the mile, running evenly almost to the
finish line. Carter's final sprint proved
too much for the Bear sophomore, and
the former won by a slight margin in
4:33 2-5 8.

finished third with 19 points, St. Igna
tius placing fourth with 5 points.

in which it picked up only two points,
Stanford's varsity track and field team
scored an 80 to 72 victory over the
Olympic Club in the Annual Pacific
Association championships in the
Kezar Stadium at San Francisco Sat
urday. One world's record and a Pa
cific Coast mark were bettered,
Itussell Sweet, former Montana
sprinter now running for the Winged
O, provided the thrill of the meet
when he led Hec Dyer of Stanford to
the tape in the century in 9 2-5 s., one
fifth of a second faster than the
recognized world's record. Sweet was
aided by a strong wind at his back,
so the record will not be counted. The
Olympic runner got away to a perfect
start and had a three-yard lead on
Dyer all the way to the finish. Dyer
came back in the 220-yard dash with
a clean-cut win over Sweet in the fast

was third. Kibby's winning toss was
203 ft. 2 in.
Storie Takes 880
Bill Storie, former Stanford star and

non of Stanford.
Captain Ross Nichols had a hard
time of it beating his teammate, Podge

low barriers. Ward's time wan

high-point man of the day, taking a
first in the pole vault as well. His

the Club in 49 1-5 s. Shove was third
and Syer fourth.
Harry Carter and Red Mossman of
California provided a pretty race in
the mile, running evenly almost to the
finish line. Carter's final sprint proved
too much for the Bear sophomore, and
the former won by a slight margin in
4:33 2-5 8.

Notwithstanding a handicap of com
peting in four non-collegiate events
in which it picked up only two points,
Stanford's varsity track and field team
scored an 80 to 72 victory over the
Olympic Club in the Annual Pacific
Association championships in the
Kezar Stadium at San Francisco Sat
urday. One world's record and a Pa
cific Coast mark were bettered,
Itussell Sweet, former Montana
sprinter now running for the Winged
O, provided the thrill of the meet
when he led Hec Dyer of Stanford to
the tape in the century in 9 2-5 s., one
fifth of a second faster than the
recognized world's record. Sweet was
aided by a strong wind at his back,
so the record will not be counted. The
Olympic runner got away to a perfect
start and had a three-yard lead on
Dyer all the way to the finish. Dyer
came back in the 220-yard dash with
a clean-cut win over Sweet in the fast
time of 21 3-5 s.
Kelley Breaks Record
Bob Kelley, veteran San Francisco
mail man and for nine consecutive
years winner of the P.A. title in the
hop, step, and jump, made it ten
straight Saturday and in so doing
broke his own Pacific Coast record by
almost a foot. His winning jump, if it
can bo called a jump, measured 49 ft.
1 1-8 in. Bob Patton of California was
second, with Martin of the Olympics
third, and Anderson of Stanford
fourth.
In the four non-collegiate events —
the 16-pound hammer throw, the 56-
pcund weight throw, the 5-mile run,
and the hop, step, and jump—the
Olympics scored 30 points. Anderson's
fourth in the hop, step, and jump and
Carley's fourth in the 5-mile run were
the Cards' only points in these events.
Kibby and Sparling of Stanford par
tially evened things up with Captain
Curtice of California in the javelin,
the two Cards taking first and second,
and the Bear, who placed ahead of
them in the Big Meet, only getting
fourth. Baxter, another Californian,
was third. Kibby's winning toss was
203 ft. 2 in.
Storie Takes 880
Bill Storie, former Stanford star and
Olympic Club captain, surprised every
one to finish first in the half-mile,
running the distance in competition
for the first time in his career. A
splendid driving finish enabled him to
win by three yards from Alex McKin
non of Stanford.
Captain Ross Nichols had a hard
time of it beating his teammate, Podge
Smith, in the high hurdles, breaking
the tape only a yard ahead of the
Card sophomore in a 15 s. race. A
little later in the afternoon Smith
pushed Edmonds all the way in the
low barriers. Ward's time wan
24 4-5 s. Edmonds, of course, was
high-point man of the day, taking a
first in the pole vault as well. His
height in this event was 13 ft. Huls
man of Stanford was second, Ouerra
of the Olympic Club third, and Berry
of the Cards fourth.
Krenz Wins Discua
Eric Krenz had little trouble win
ning the discus with a long throw of
154 ft. 6 in. One of his throws bettered
the 160-foot mark; but Krenz was
ruled to have fouled; and it was not
counted. Following Krenz in order
were Kleckner of St. Ignatius College,
and Rothert and Tandy of Stanford.
The Cards scored a clean sweep in
the shot, winning all four places.
Rothert took first with a heave of 49
ft. 6% in., Krenz, Forster, and Way
taking the remaining places.
Morrison ran a nice lap in the quar
ter-mile to finish ahead of Storie of
the Club in 49 1-5 s. Shove was third
and Syer fourth.
Harry Carter and Red Mossman of
California provided a pretty race in
the mile, running evenly almost to the
finish line. Carter's final sprint proved
too much for the Bear sophomore, and
the former won by a slight margin in
4:33 2-5 8.
In the team competition California
finished third with 19 points, St. Igna
tius placing fourth with 5 points.
Two Stanford women competed in
the women's part of the P.A. meet.
Thelma Patton took a second in the
hurdles and Katherine Doyle a third
