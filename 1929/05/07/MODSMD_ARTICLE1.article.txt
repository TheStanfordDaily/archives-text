# STUDENTS COMPLAIN OF UNFAIR PRICES IN FOOD INVESTIGATION
## Board Rate Works Hardship On Organizations as Men Leave, Say Club Leaders No Statement Forthcoming From Auditor Erwin; Roth Returns From Trip East 
### Allan Hart 
The general reaction of boarders at
the Encina Commons to the eating
conditions there is one of strong
ly questioning the fairness of the
price charged for board. The matter
of quality of the food enters into the
question but emphasis is on the mat
ter of price.
Attempts to secure statements from
Ernest S. Erwin, University auditor,
and from Almon E. Roth, Comptroller,
proved fruitless, both men having
other appointments. Roth returned to
the campus yesterday noon from an
Eastern trip.
Proof that there is and has been
definite dissatisfaction with condi
tions at the Commons was found when
the Daily secured statements from
representative freshmen and from the
presidents of the clubs that eat at
Encina. The following statement was
made by these student leaders in re
sponse to an inquiry by the Daily as
to the clubs' attitude:
Leaders Complain
"The food is on the whole better
than it has been during the past four
years. There is less dissatisfaction
with the food quality than in the past.
"The clubs do feel, however, that
the present price is not justified by
the quality and amount of food served.
Moreover, the high price is not com
patable with the best interests of the
clubs, as shown by the increasing ob
jections of the members to this price.
"And in view of the comparative
figures published by the Daily in re
gard to other living groups, we would
appreciate some justification for the
exhorbitant charge of Encina Com
mons."
An attempt was made to secure
brief statements from representative
freshmen who eat at Encina Com
mons. Men were sought who would
give relatively fair and unprejudiced
opinions. Following are the state
ments:
Sunday Meal Light
"The Sunday night meals are not
sufficient for one to satisfy his appe
tite. Cold half-baked potatoes are an
unpleasant feature. One cracker for
desert is despairingly unsatisfactory.
"Over-abundance of starch and
grease in vegetables."
"No refunds during rushing."
"As a hasher I have an opportunity
to observe at first hand the deplor
| able inefficiency and incompetency of
t the executive organization."
"The quality of the groceries at the
Commons may be the same as at the
I fraternities, but the quality of the
food put on the table at Encina is
much lower."
Erwin Comments
"Judging from Mr. Erwin's state
ment in Monday's Daily praising the
high quality of Encina food it appears
that he must only eat there on Satur
days."
"There is no reason why very much
better meals could not be served in
Encina Commons when (1) every
freshman must pay $1.27 a day for
meals whether he is there or not;
(2) only about one-third of the Frosh
eat breakfast; (3) only about one-half
eat meals on Friday night and on
Sunday; (4) during the present quar
ter only about one-half of the stu
dents have eaten meals at Encina on
any day because of fraternity rush
ing, and now that they are pledges
they eat most of their meals at their
House."
"For the amount of money we pay,
we deserve better food."
Food Poorly Prepared
"I believe that the quality of the
food when purchased is above ques
tion, but In the preparation something
happens to it that makes it not par
ticularly palatable. Also I believe the
preponderance of soft foods is more
suitable to an invalid than to one who
cares to make a full or partial use of
Stanford's athletic facilities."
"It is possible to eat well downtown
for a dollar a day, and certainly the
Palo Alto restaurants are not run on
a non-profit basis, as the Commons are
supposed to be."
"One cause for complaint is that
there is no refund for tickets that are
not used and for this reason meals
outside the campus are paid for
twice."
"Considering the large buying
power of the Commons, it seems to
me that a better quality of food could
be obtained."
