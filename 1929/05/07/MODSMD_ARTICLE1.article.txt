# STUDENTS COMPLAIN OF UNFAIR PRICES IN FOOD INVESTIGATION
## Board Rate Works Hardship On Organizations as Men Leave, Say Club Leaders No Statement Forthcoming From Auditor Erwin; Roth Returns From Trip East 
### Allan Hart 
The general reaction of boarders at
the Encina Commons to the eating
conditions there is one of strong
ly questioning the fairness of the
price charged for board. The matter
of quality of the food enters into the

appreciate some justification for the
exhorbitant charge of Encina Com
mons."
An attempt was made to secure
brief statements from representative
freshmen who eat at Encina Com
mons. Men were sought who would
give relatively fair and unprejudiced
opinions. Following are the state
ments:
Sunday Meal Light
"The Sunday night meals are not
sufficient for one to satisfy his appe
tite. Cold half-baked potatoes are an
unpleasant feature. One cracker for
desert is despairingly unsatisfactory.
"Over-abundance of starch and
grease in vegetables."
"No refunds during rushing."
"As a hasher I have an opportunity
to observe at first hand the deplor
