### William Grace 
Awarding of block and circle letters
for winning against Southern Cali
fornia or placing in intersectional
championship contests is a constitu
tional change to be discussed in Ex
Committee meeting tonight.
Changes in three major and four
minor sports awards will be presented
to the A.S.S.U. executive body. They
were drawn up by the Athletic Award
Investigation committee, Hilliard Gif
fen, chairman. Its members are Theo
Harder, Robert Syer, Roy Mitchell,
Ralph Malcolm, Walter Heinecke,
Herkimer Adams, and George Bodle.
The new additional requirements
proposed will probably be as follows:
football — fifteen minutes against
U.S.C.; baseball —nine innings of the
U.S.C. series; track —a point or frac
tion thereof in the U.S.C. meet; box
ing—winning of a Far Western Colle
giate Boxing Tournament title; fenc
ing—winning of the majority of bouts
on the Minor Sport Tournament; golf
—team or individual honors in the
Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Golf
Tournament, or winning a majority of
possible points in the matches in the
Union Sports Carnival; gymnastics—
to be one of the four highest in the
minor sports program gymnasium tour
nament.
In addition, every man competing
on a winning team against California
or in the Minor Sport Tournament
will be awarded his circle "S," it is
proposed.
Two other amendments will be dis
cussed by Ex Committee: one pro
vides for succession of the vice-presi
dent of A.S.S.U. to president, in case
of disqualification of the latter; the
other would create an election board
of eleven members and a chairman.
All amendments have to be passed
by student body election.
