# Disarmament To Await Action Of Big Navy Powers
## Commission Disagrees Over Methods of Reducing Land Protection 
### 
GENEVA, May 6. (,/P) —The prepara
tory disarmament commission ad
journed today with the next move
toward disarmament awaiting action
by the Big Five naval powers. In ad
journing, the commission left the date
of the next meeting open, but with
the understanding that it will be
convened anew when the naval na
tions announce that they have
achieved enough progress toward a
naval agreement to justify summoning
of what is expected to be the last
session of the commission before con
vocation of an international confer
ence on disarmament. *
The commission adjourned without
being able to register agreements on
the methods of reducing land arma
ments. Tables were arranged, how
ever, for limiting land and air effec
tives and military airplanes. Chemical
and bacteria warfare was again
banned.
An encouraging start was made on
the problem of naval reductions in
consequence of the American initia
tive which, in the closing hours of the
preliminary conference, again was
hailed with words of welcome from
the British, French, Japanese, and
Italian delegations. Consideration of
the methods of limiting navies, how
ever, was postponed at the request
of the naval powers themselves who
wished to seek an agreement by nego
tiation outside of the commission.
