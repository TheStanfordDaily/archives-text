John Revell, and Rufus Spalding,
played under the name of the Stan
ford Freebooters, but did not repre
sent the University in these games.
The first game, Saturday afternoon,
provided some real thrills for the
crowd. The Flintridge team, composed
of Bailey, 1, Jack Frost, 2, and Bill
Keck, 3, was leading at the end of
the fifth period 9 to 6, but in the last
chukker the Stanford malletmen un
corked a fast offense, marked by good
teamwork, which enabled them to
score five goals and take the match.
In the second contest, on Sunday
afternoon, the Club men tried hard
to overcome an early lead of the
Cardinal players, making a spirited
rally in the next to the last chukker
which nearly tied the score. The
Flintridge players for this game were:
Bud Keck, 1, Major Fullerton, 2, and
Bill Keck, 3.
