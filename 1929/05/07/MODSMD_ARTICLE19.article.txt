The most beautiful sport of all—crew.
The question, as to whether Stanford will re-adopt this famous col
lege sport is to be decided at the Student Body election on May 21, pro
viding the Executive Committee sees fit to accept a petition framed by
the Skull and Snakes, honor society, at a meeting held yesterday noon.

The petition reads:
Since there has been so much
student discussion regarding the
matter, and since Skull and
Snakes are interested in campus
opinions, they hereby petition the
Executive Committee to place on
the ballot at the student election
May 21, the question as to whether
crew shall be re-adopted as a ma
jor sport at Stanford.
Daily Makes Study
Through the efforts of the Daily an
I intensive study has been made during
J the past two weeks in regard to the
crew situation.
Major Goodsell, former world's
sculling champion and himself a great
i crew enthusiast, was asked by the
; Daily to look over the situation and
give an approximate figure on the cost
of starting crew and carrying it
I through the first three years of its
existence. He was also obtained by
j the Daily to speak to the Skull and
i Snake society regarding the possibili
ties of crew at Stanford.
Stanford alumni, interested in the
return of crew, advised that the mat
j ter be put up to the students —prefer-
' ably by a test vote. If the students
I favor the return of this famous sport,
1 they seemed to think there would be
! little trouble in getting the backing
of alumni and the Board of Athletic
Control in re-adopting it.
Favor San Carlos Site
Representatives of this paper were
i instrumental in locating the best pos
' sible course that has yet been un
covered in this vicinity. It is called
Steinbergen Slough, and is located
opposite San Carlos, nine miles from
here —a twenty-minute ride. This body
of water is practically a straightaway
and extends for nearly three and one
half miles back from the bay, main
taining an approximate width of one
hundred yards—wide enough to ac
commodate from four to six shells
even at low tide.
Eastern institutions cannot under
stand why Stanford is not represented
in this field. Powerful Stanford track
and football teams have made that
name famous throughout the nation.
A crew could not help but add glory
and prestige.
In 1932 California will play host to
the Olympic Games. Crew holds a
prominent position on the Olympic
program, and Stanford must start
now if she hopes to make a substan
tial bid for the honor of representing
the United States in this sport.
Huskies, Bears Applaud
Communications from the Univer
sity of Washington and the University
of California show that Stanford can
rely upon the support of both in the
event she decides to readopt crew.
The George Pocock Company, Seattle
boat-builders, have also offered to as
sist in giving the Cards a start in
this sport by furnishing shells for the
first two years at cost.
Over 50,000 people attended the re
cent rowing classic between the Hus
kies and Bears in the Oakland Estu
ary. It is reasonable to expect that an
equal number would turn out for a
Stanford regatta. A Stanford crew
could meet aggregations from Cali
fornia, Washington, and Oregon State
College, which instituted this sport
during the past year.

of water is practically a straightaway
and extends for nearly three and one
half miles back from the bay, main
taining an approximate width of one
hundred yards—wide enough to ac
commodate from four to six shells
even at low tide.
Eastern institutions cannot under
stand why Stanford is not represented
in this field. Powerful Stanford track
and football teams have made that
name famous throughout the nation.
A crew could not help but add glory
and prestige.
In 1932 California will play host to
the Olympic Games. Crew holds a
prominent position on the Olympic
program, and Stanford must start
now if she hopes to make a substan
tial bid for the honor of representing
the United States in this sport.
Huskies, Bears Applaud
Communications from the Univer
sity of Washington and the University
of California show that Stanford can
rely upon the support of both in the
event she decides to readopt crew.
The George Pocock Company, Seattle
boat-builders, have also offered to as
sist in giving the Cards a start in
this sport by furnishing shells for the
first two years at cost.
Over 50,000 people attended the re
cent rowing classic between the Hus
kies and Bears in the Oakland Estu
ary. It is reasonable to expect that an
equal number would turn out for a
Stanford regatta. A Stanford crew
could meet aggregations from Cali
fornia, Washington, and Oregon State
College, which instituted this sport
during the past year.
The most beautiful sport of all—crew.
The question, as to whether Stanford will re-adopt this famous col
lege sport is to be decided at the Student Body election on May 21, pro
viding the Executive Committee sees fit to accept a petition framed by
the Skull and Snakes, honor society, at a meeting held yesterday noon.

The petition reads:
Since there has been so much
student discussion regarding the
matter, and since Skull and
Snakes are interested in campus
opinions, they hereby petition the
Executive Committee to place on
the ballot at the student election
May 21, the question as to whether
crew shall be re-adopted as a ma
jor sport at Stanford.
Daily Makes Study
Through the efforts of the Daily an
I intensive study has been made during
J the past two weeks in regard to the
crew situation.
Major Goodsell, former world's
sculling champion and himself a great
i crew enthusiast, was asked by the
; Daily to look over the situation and
give an approximate figure on the cost
of starting crew and carrying it
I through the first three years of its
existence. He was also obtained by
j the Daily to speak to the Skull and
i Snake society regarding the possibili
ties of crew at Stanford.
Stanford alumni, interested in the
return of crew, advised that the mat
j ter be put up to the students —prefer-
' ably by a test vote. If the students
I favor the return of this famous sport,
1 they seemed to think there would be
! little trouble in getting the backing
of alumni and the Board of Athletic
Control in re-adopting it.
Favor San Carlos Site
Representatives of this paper were
i instrumental in locating the best pos
' sible course that has yet been un
covered in this vicinity. It is called
Steinbergen Slough, and is located
opposite San Carlos, nine miles from
here —a twenty-minute ride. This body
of water is practically a straightaway
and extends for nearly three and one
half miles back from the bay, main
taining an approximate width of one
