The most beautiful sport of all—crew.
The question, as to whether Stanford will re-adopt this famous col
lege sport is to be decided at the Student Body election on May 21, pro
viding the Executive Committee sees fit to accept a petition framed by
the Skull and Snakes, honor society, at a meeting held yesterday noon.

The petition reads:
Since there has been so much
student discussion regarding the

opinions, they hereby petition the
Executive Committee to place on
the ballot at the student election
May 21, the question as to whether
crew shall be re-adopted as a ma

Major Goodsell, former world's

Stanford alumni, interested in the
return of crew, advised that the mat

! little trouble in getting the backing
of alumni and the Board of Athletic
Control in re-adopting it.

of water is practically a straightaway
and extends for nearly three and one
half miles back from the bay, main
taining an approximate width of one
hundred yards—wide enough to ac

Eastern institutions cannot under

in this field. Powerful Stanford track
