# The 						Eighteen Cent Difference Still Remains
## 
### 
Aside from the subjective facts of present dissatisfaction with the eat
ing conditions at the Encina Commons as evidenced by men eating there,
the objective fact of a too high price stands out as sufficient reason for
an investigation, an explanation, and a change in that price.
The quality of the food does not differ enough, if at all, from that
served in other campus living groups, to justify this large difference in
price. The overhead or the inefficiency of the management, or both, cause
the difference. In either case it is unfair to place the burden upon the men
eating there, the majority of whom eat there through compulsion.
Dissatisfaction with the quality of food served at the Commons is a
subjective thing that cannot be lield entirely against the management.
However it is a definite symptom worthy of note when it recurs year after
year, as it does.
The criticism occurring in one of the statements printed in today's
story on the situation: namely, that the meals missed by men during
rushing and throughout the year at breakfast should be an economic sav
ing enough to cut the price somewhat is very apt. The Encina Commons
are not responsible for meals served and not eaten but it cannot be denied
that it profits in the long run by the missing of meals and especially, as in
the case of rushing, when it knows that the majority of the freshmen will
be absent.
The Daily cannot swallow this eighteen cent difference in price be
tween the living groups and the Commons. It cannot accept it as mean
ingless. It asks for an explanation. If it is unjustified in believing that
this is unfair, it is willing to admit its error.
