# The 						Strong Possibilities For Crew
## 
### 
Sideline Slants contains today a well substantiated argument for the
return of crew to Stanford as a major sport. The Daily has made a
thorough study of the conditions to be encountered with the re-establish
ment of this sport.
An admirable course suiting all the needs of crew has been found below
San Carlos in the San Francisco Bay. Property nearby is not high priced,
thus permitting the purchase of a boathouse site at a reasonable price. "The
initial cost of instituting crew it has been estimated would be $65,000 and
the annual cost to support it $29,000. These figures are based primarily
on the cost and upkeep at California. Crew there runs into a bigger figure
than it does at any other institution.
The very nature of the sport disproves the contention that it will take
men from other sports. As a matter of fact it opens a new field in major
intercollegiate sport for men who would otherwise not participate in ath
letics.
Tonight the Executive Committee at the petition of Skull and Snakes
will consider whether or not it will place the question on the I>nllot at the
spring election, the question being, "Shall Stanford re-establish crew?"
The Daily sincerely hopes that the verdict of the Committee will be
in favor of bringing the question before the student body. Only an en
thusiastic backing from the student body can reinstate crew. The physical
difficulties have been pointed out as being much less pretentious than they
were assumed to be; the matter now rests with student body opinion.
