# The
						Bullsession
## ANOTHER NULLIFICATION BATTLE 
### 
With the probable introduction to
day of the revised tariff schedule by
the House Ways and Means Commit
tee will begin another congressional
battle to nullify the efforts of the
United States in the international
field. Advance information on the
recommendations of the committee in
dicate that President Hoover's "limit
ed revision" program has received the
sanction of the group, but our eco
nomic jingoists are already planning
an attack to secure the usual "revision
upward."
Adherence to the World Court and
the League of Nations was balked by
our log-rolling nationalists and it now
seems that they plan to wave the red
flag in the face of tho European bull.
Conciliatory gestures toward Euro
pean nations have been the rule with
neveral administrations now, but with
the ever-present War debt settlements
complicating tho issues, our rabid
protectionists have been goading
Europeans with their economic policy.
It is certain that those nations with
whom we have made debt settlement
agreements cannot possibly maintain
their schedule of payments in the face
of constantly increasing tariff duties
preventing the flow of European
goods to the United States. After all
things are discounted, the United
States has a monopoly on tho gold
supply of the world, and furthermore,
if gold Importations were possible, wo

could not with safety accept them
without upsetting the economic bal
ance of the country. Europe must pay
with goods if at all, and we are plan
ning further curtailment of importa
tions.
There is only one solution of the
problem left to the debtor nations:
that of discriminatory tariffs against
the goods of the United States, and
Europe is beginning to see the latent
power of such a policy. Even free
trade England is becoming protection
ist.
Refusing to adhere to the ready
made international modes of disarma
ment and arbitration, the United
States Is nevertheless trying to pro
mote such agreements, struggling, as
it were, with a school boy congress.
Of course, we cannot be too critical
of our representatives in Washington
since they are supposed to present the
opinions of their constituents, and
America has been sold on protection.
However, we shall soon see whether
these representatives can comprehend
the larger situation which confronts
them and do their duty despito the
possible loss of a few votes. Will they
wave the flag and cause the bull to
wreck the international china shop,
or will they bo content to let him
serve as an oxen pulling the indus
trial plow of a new and united eco
nomic world?
