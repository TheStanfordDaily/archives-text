## CROWING FOR CREW 
### 
VTOW THAT ancient cry of "What
" about crew," so long lunged by
Chaparral, again is echoing over the
hay-fields. Skull and Snakes, suddenly
galvanizing into action, yesterday de
termined upon calling for the Execu
tive Committee to ascertain in a
popular referendum what Stanford
students think about crew, In order
that eventually the Board of Athletic
Control may be humbly petitioned to
consider again the hoary plea for
rowing.
This might seem to be merely an
other campaign in a year which has
been well punctuated with campaigns;
but this promises to be an interest
ing fight, with strong opposition in
the offing. Certain members of the
Board of Athletic Control, including
General Manager A. R. Masters, are
heartily opposed to the reintroduetion
of crew, and their influence will have
a great deal of weight. Their objec
tions are embodied in the following
two reasons.
1 Crew is too expensive. It would
cost $100,000 to acquire a site for
and establish a boathouse, and to
provide shells and oars. Annual ex
penditure on crew would be about
$40,000 over all; income would be
practically nil.
sy Under the present limitation of
" freshman men, not enough ma
terial would be available for crew;
moreover, many athletes would be at
tracted to crew to the possible detri
ment of existent sports.

The Dally, through its sports edi
tor, has taken a good deal of pains
to discover what the actual problems
of instituting crew would be. In the
first place, he has found a course,
three-and-a-half-miles long and prac
tically a straightaway, 100 to 150
yards wide —able to accommodate six
shells —located in the bay below San
Carlos, about nine miles from the
campus. So promising is the site, that
Major J. Goodsell, former single scull
champion of the world and a San
Francisco rowing enthusiast, who in
troduced the subject of crew at Stan
ford to Skull and Snakes yesterday,
said that it has possibilities of being
one of the best courses on the coast.
And the cost of acquiring a location
on which to build a boathouse, the
Sports Editor has ascertained, will be
practically negligible.
• • »
Now as to the reported cost of the
venture. A1 Masters estimates that
$100,000 would be required to launch
it, as it were. But Jack MacKenzie, as
sistant general manager at the Uni
versity of California, told the Daily
that no more than $65,000 wotild be
needed to acquire a site, build and
equip a boathouse, and purchase row
ing equipment. This estimate is based,
obviously, on the costs which Cali
fornia has had to meet in establish
ing its crew. And the fact remains
that California spends more than any
other college in the United States on
this sport.
Masters argues that the yearly ex
pense of crew would be about $40,000.
MacKenzie reports that California's
annual expense is $29,000, which in
cludes the salary of the coach, the
annual purchase of one new shell and
oars, and the cost of maintaining and
sending 27 men to Poughkeepsie, New
York, for the intercollegiate regatta.
It might be pointed out that Califor
nia's training expense is much heavier
than Stanford's would be, since the
university haß to pay the living ex
penses of its crews from the 10th of
May until the middle of June, when
they leave for the East. Stanford
would incur no such expense, since
the University would be in session
during that time.
* * *
So much for the cost of crew. Get
ting the material is a problem which
admits of much argument. MacKenzie
declares that football men are avail
able for crew, but the experience of
California has not tended to bear that
out. Dan McMillan is the only con
spicuous example of a crew and foot
ball man. Obviously, basketball, track,
and baseball men could not turn out
for crew. But, on the other hand, it
may be argued that crew does not
need precisely the type of athlete
which the other sports need. Your
football, basketball, track, and base
ball men need to be swift of foot; but
you sit down to crew. Rowing demands
co-ordination and condition, pre-emi
nently. Of course physique is a re
quisite; so Is temperament. But,
given the proper physique and tem
perament, a coach can develop an
oarsman out of raw material, without
drawing on other sports for athletes.
• * *
Whether Stanford has the raw ma
terial to support crew is a question
which Dr. Storey ought (with the help
of his Btaff) to be able to answer.
• • ♦
We shall leave ofT discussion of
whether Stanford has the man power,
to conclude with the prediction that
rowing will receive a tremendeous im
petus in this region with the coming
of the 1932 Olympic Games rowing
competition to either Lake Merced
(one of the Spring Valloy Lakes) or

to the bay. There will be ten days of
rowing which will leave ho great an
impression in the minds of sport fol
lowers that the sport will thrive
greatly thereafter.
• ♦ *
A university with the standing of
Stanford in the athletic world can
not afford to neglect a sport holding
the position which crew holds. If we
are to maintain our athletic prestige
at all, we must consider the advan
tages of this great sport.

able for crew, but the experience of
California has not tended to bear that
out. Dan McMillan is the only con

may be argued that crew does not
need precisely the type of athlete

you sit down to crew. Rowing demands
co-ordination and condition, pre-emi

heartily opposed to the reintroduetion
of crew, and their influence will have
a great deal of weight. Their objec
tions are embodied in the following
two reasons.
1 Crew is too expensive. It would
cost $100,000 to acquire a site for
and establish a boathouse, and to
provide shells and oars. Annual ex
penditure on crew would be about
$40,000 over all; income would be

The Dally, through its sports edi

to discover what the actual problems
of instituting crew would be. In the
first place, he has found a course,
three-and-a-half-miles long and prac
tically a straightaway, 100 to 150
yards wide —able to accommodate six
shells —located in the bay below San
Carlos, about nine miles from the
campus. So promising is the site, that
Major J. Goodsell, former single scull
champion of the world and a San
Francisco rowing enthusiast, who in
troduced the subject of crew at Stan
ford to Skull and Snakes yesterday,
said that it has possibilities of being
one of the best courses on the coast.
And the cost of acquiring a location
on which to build a boathouse, the

Now as to the reported cost of the
venture. A1 Masters estimates that
$100,000 would be required to launch
it, as it were. But Jack MacKenzie, as
sistant general manager at the Uni
versity of California, told the Daily
that no more than $65,000 wotild be
needed to acquire a site, build and
equip a boathouse, and purchase row
ing equipment. This estimate is based,
obviously, on the costs which Cali
fornia has had to meet in establish
ing its crew. And the fact remains
that California spends more than any
other college in the United States on
this sport.
Masters argues that the yearly ex
pense of crew would be about $40,000.
MacKenzie reports that California's
annual expense is $29,000, which in
cludes the salary of the coach, the
annual purchase of one new shell and
oars, and the cost of maintaining and
sending 27 men to Poughkeepsie, New
York, for the intercollegiate regatta.
It might be pointed out that Califor
nia's training expense is much heavier
than Stanford's would be, since the
university haß to pay the living ex
penses of its crews from the 10th of
May until the middle of June, when
they leave for the East. Stanford

Now as to the reported cost of the
venture. A1 Masters estimates that
$100,000 would be required to launch
it, as it were. But Jack MacKenzie, as
sistant general manager at the Uni
versity of California, told the Daily
that no more than $65,000 wotild be
needed to acquire a site, build and
equip a boathouse, and purchase row
ing equipment. This estimate is based,
obviously, on the costs which Cali
fornia has had to meet in establish
ing its crew. And the fact remains
that California spends more than any
other college in the United States on
this sport.
Masters argues that the yearly ex
pense of crew would be about $40,000.
MacKenzie reports that California's
annual expense is $29,000, which in
cludes the salary of the coach, the
annual purchase of one new shell and
oars, and the cost of maintaining and
sending 27 men to Poughkeepsie, New
York, for the intercollegiate regatta.
It might be pointed out that Califor
nia's training expense is much heavier
than Stanford's would be, since the
university haß to pay the living ex
penses of its crews from the 10th of
May until the middle of June, when
they leave for the East. Stanford
would incur no such expense, since
the University would be in session
during that time.
* * *
So much for the cost of crew. Get
ting the material is a problem which
admits of much argument. MacKenzie
declares that football men are avail
able for crew, but the experience of
California has not tended to bear that
out. Dan McMillan is the only con
spicuous example of a crew and foot
ball man. Obviously, basketball, track,
and baseball men could not turn out
for crew. But, on the other hand, it
may be argued that crew does not
need precisely the type of athlete
which the other sports need. Your
football, basketball, track, and base
ball men need to be swift of foot; but
you sit down to crew. Rowing demands
co-ordination and condition, pre-emi
nently. Of course physique is a re
quisite; so Is temperament. But,
given the proper physique and tem
perament, a coach can develop an
oarsman out of raw material, without
drawing on other sports for athletes.
