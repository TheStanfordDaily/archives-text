Awake And Rehearse. By Louis Brom
field. (New York: Stokes Co.
349 pp. 1920.)
There is in English literature a
classic trope, a metaphorical expres
sion, likening all the world to a stage,
and men in the world to actors. Of
course, you have read it or heard it
uttered. But it is such a platitude. It
is so commonplace. You accept as a
truism that the world is a stage and
men in it only actors. Perhaps. But
you know very often little indeed of
what is truism, put as a trope, im
plies. It may well be you are too busy
acting to think at all profoundly
about the acting of others. Or, there
may be another reason. You may
have cultivated a certain aloofness
from commonplace things such as
platitudes, this one among them. For
you then, truisms are passe. They are
not esoteric.
Whether or not you have assumed
for yourself a certain superior aloof
ness and thus felt a doubt that so
much could ever be told of the world
and its men in so very few simple
words —whether or not, I say, read
Bromfield's short stories, thirteen in
number, put between covers in a book
called "Awake and Rehearse."
Men enter upon the stage at birth
and leave it at death. It is with the
exit Bromfield is concerned. Not only
are Bromfield's characters moribund,
they are, many of them, dead. And
so that we may see them as they
were while they played their parts
on the stage, in the world, that is,
Bromfield has awakened in memory
from their sleep of death, these men
and women, characters of his crea
tion —has awakened them and made
them rehearse the parts they played
while life was in them still.
Bromfield tells his tales of men and
women who played parts well or ill in
life's drama, who came to naught
when they died, when they "shuffled
off this mortal coil."
Bromfield has a peculiar insight
into the motives which cause men to
do as they do. If the world is a stage,

and if too men are mere actors, Brom
field is a director of much ability.
These men and women enter from the
wings, come forward close to the foot
lights, play their parts on the prosce
nium, disappear—all at the instance
of a master director. Then there is a
change of scene —other men and wo
men come on the stage and go away—
disappear to make place for yet
others.
Although most of the stories have
as their locale, Paris, there is a story
with its setting in the German Black
Forest and one with a German water
ing place as a setting. There is too
one story of a culprit brought into an
American court and tried.
Abnormal people seem to have a
fascination for Bromfield. This is no
unique fascination —by no means, but
Bromfield treats of his strange people
with a subtle irony that is vastly
pleasing, treats of them with an irony
peculiarly his own. Not only do these
abnormal people have a fascination
for Bromfield, but in writing of them
Bromfield makes you, the reader, feel
with him a fascination for them also.
Bromfield's irony is not at all of a
piece with the sort of satire Sinclair
Lewis puts on paper. Though Brom
field is often occupied with morbid
aspects of life, it does not make you
ill to read him, as it does make you
ill, for instance, to read some of the
things Sherwood Anderson has writ
ten. There is in Bromfield an irony
truism that the world is a stgae and
lightening even the heaviest story.
Bromfield writes not as a beautiful
prose as Anderson does, but his
dreariest tale is not nearly so dreary
as any of Anderson's Winesburg ones.
Though Bromfield seems by far a
better writer of novels, than he is of
short stories, all these put together
in "Awake and Rehearse" are very well
worth a reading. Ernest Hemingway,
or Charles Caldwell Dobie, is perhaps
a better short story writer than is
Bromfield, but even so Bromfield
stands well in comparison with them.
Read "Awake and Rehearse" by all
means. —Gunnar Norberg.
