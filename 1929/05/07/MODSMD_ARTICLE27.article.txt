### Philip Space 
(Editor's Note: Herewith is the fifth
installment of Mr. Philip Space's care
ful and earnest investigation of the
Row (in verse). The Bixth "Varia
tions" will appear in this paper at an
early date —as early as tomorrow.)
ROBLE OBSERVATORY, May 6.—
Fronf this vantage point, overlooking
the whole Social Situation at Stan
ford, we begin our sixth day of spy
glass work. The task is arduous, and
it is all we can do to drag ourselves
away to our work. Still, though food
is low, spirits are high.
We hope to clean up on the fra
ternities this week (that is, unless
the fraternities clean up on us) and
start on the sororities. This will re
quire high courage, and we may have
to move up to the very top floor. But
that is another story . . .

"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"
Twinkle, twinkle, Sigma Nu
Naught to do but scan the view
Up above the world so high
What would come if you should die?
When the first faint star is set
When the grass with dew is wet
Then you don your rompers tight —
Throw kid parties through the night.
Twinkle, twinkle, Sigma Nu
What else do you know or do?
Up above the world so high
Who would care if you should die?
"The House by the Side of the Road"
Let me live in a house by the side

of the road
Where the racing cars go by
Some well to the good, some bound
for the bad
A'coming along to the rye.
. . , I would not sit in the driver's
seat
Nor heave the lover's sigh
Let me live with Phi Sigs quite aside
from the Row
While the rest of the world goes by.
