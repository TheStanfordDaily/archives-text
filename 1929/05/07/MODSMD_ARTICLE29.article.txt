# BILL FOR REVISION OF LEGISLATURE IN STATE LOSES BY TWO VOTES

### 
SACRAMENTO, May 6. (/P)â€” A pro
posal for complete revision of the
legislative branch of California gov
ernment was defeated in the assembly
by but two votes today.
A resolution introduced by Assem
blyman Morgan Keaton and Ray Wil
liamson providing for revamping of
the legislative branch failed to gain
the necessary two-thirds vote for pas
sage and the author, Keaton, moved
for reconsideration of the measure
tomorrow.
The amendment, if passed by both
houses and placed before the people
In 1930, would ask for an almost con
tinuous legislature. Salaries of legis
lators would be raised from $1200 to
$3600. Assemblymen would be elected
for four years instead of two, and
sessions would be annual instead of
every two years. Committees would
be permanent. Proponents of the
measure predict that much state busi
ness now handled by boards, bureaus,
and divisions would fall into the com
mittees' hands.
