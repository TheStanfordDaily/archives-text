# 'MOVING ON' FREAKS TO PARADE CAMPUS TODAY IN MYSTERY
## 
### 
Mystery!
Where? All up and down the
Row, in and out of corners,
roundabout the campus ... a
mystery will amaze even the
most skeptic scoffers at the mys
terious at 12:45 today. Late last
night even the Daily was able to
unearth but a single clue con
cerning this great mystery â€”and
that was that freaks of mavvel
ous mein will appear in connec
tion with the mystery proces
sion, such freaks as one would
ordinarily expect to find only in
a circus. Be that as it may, the
campus may expect to look, lis
ten, and marvel during the cus
tomary silent hour of noon.
And after the mystery has ap
peared and vanished, the seat
sale for the Junior Opera, "Mov
ing On," will begin in front of the
Women's Clubhouse at 1 o'clock,
with tickets being offered at
$1.50, $1.25, and $1.00.
