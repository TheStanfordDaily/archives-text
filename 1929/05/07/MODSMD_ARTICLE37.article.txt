## 
### 
"Yes, the May "Local Interest" num
ber of Chaparral is due to appear
Thursday," said the Old Boy yester
day, "and I'm certain that many of
the institutions about the University
will get a big boob —I mean boot —out
of it."
The Foolish One has decided to de
vote the next Chappie entirely to local
stuff —even local elections —for he be
lieves that the track team, debaters,
a certain alumnus of the class of '95,
and the president of the University
will take care of outside worldly af
fairs.
It is rumored that both the Daily
and the Quad lay claim to originating
the forthcoming issue, the journalists
with their Utopian edition, and the
Quad with its Razz Section. The Old
Wheezer, however, stoutly maintains
that he found the idea tucked away in
the recesses of his famous long gray
beard.
"Whoever did thing up the idea,
though, certainly thought of a good
one," said George Pascoe, circulation
manager of the comic publication,
"and I think the issue will break all
existing sales records."
