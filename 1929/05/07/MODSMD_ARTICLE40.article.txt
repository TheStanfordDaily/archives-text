# WILL CIVILIZATION PERISH? SCIENTIST PROPOSES REMEDY

### 
Serfs toiling under the driving
whips of their masters. Galley
slaves, chained, manacled, work
ing with never a respite. The
civilizations of Rome and Greece,
Egypt and Assyria. Is the world
heading for this?
So predicts a world-renowned
scientist, who, with his col
leagues, is giving his life to pre
vent such a reversion. What else
can happen, he asks, when man's
coal and oil are gone, his en
gines can no longer be run, and
the unit of man power replaces
other sources of power?
In tomorrow's Daily appears
an outline of his work, showing
what the world of science may
be able to do to prevent this
great disaster.
