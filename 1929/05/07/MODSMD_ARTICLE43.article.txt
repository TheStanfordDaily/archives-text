# SPORTS OF 1929
## Two Marions 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Give a thought to the name of
Marion. There have been many
Marions in history and literature.
Francis Marion, of Revolutionary
fame, for instance. And Victor Hugo's
"Marion Delorme." Not to mention
Marion Davies; Marion, Ohio; J
"Marry'n haste and repent at leisure,"
etc., etc. Then there are two famous '
golfing Marions, Marion Hollins and
Marion Turpie, who went to England
together to try to win the British !
women's golf championship, which is ;
to be contested on the historic Royal
and Ancient Golf Club's links at St. j
Andrews, Scotland, the week begin
ning May 13th.
Of the two Marions, Miss Hollins is I
the more famous. In 1921 she won the I
United States women's championship
at the Hollywood Golf Club, Oeal,
N.J., defeating Miss Alexia Stirling,
defending champion, 5 and 4. I don't
know when Marion Hollins made her
first bid for the women's title, but in
1913 she was runner-up to Miss G.
Ravenscroft of England. That was
sixteen years ago, and Miss Hollins
can still play a lot of fine golf—she
beat Miriam Burns Horn when the
latter was national champion a year
ago at Del Monte —so it would be very
silly to make any crack about "The
old gray Marion ain't what she used
to be."
Miss Marion Turpie is more or less ;

a new star in the "glorious firmament
of golfdom." Called "The Sweetheart
of the Links" because of her pleasing
smile and sunny disposition, many
think that this Marion is ordained to
be champion because she was born
|at St. Andrews, where she is about
to make her first bid for international
| golf honors. She calls New Orleans
her home, does this 21-year-old Dixie
Queen, and she is already listed as
! champion of the South, and Pan
| American champion. She is a sound
stylist, and added experience will put
I her among golf's leading women play
ers.
