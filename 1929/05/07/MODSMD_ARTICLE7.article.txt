# Three Events To Be Sponsored By Third Year Class
## Junior Week Will Feature "Moving On," Prom, and Water Carnival 
### 
The Class of 1930 is supreme!â€”for
a week. For this is the traditional
week during which juniors rule and
play. Formal festivities will be inau
gurated Friday night with the Junior
Prom. The annual Water Sports Carni
val will occupy Saturday morning and
the opera, "Moving On," is scheduled
for Saturday night. Dean Morrison is
general chairman of the week.
Attractive silhouettes, featuring
John Held, Jr., collegiate characters,
will transform the Pavilion into an
illustrated exposition of modern col
lege types. These sets have been spe
cially constructed for Saff Nye, chair
man of the decoration committee, and
are done in black and silver.
Feature Novel Programs
Every care has been taken to make
the dance one of the most complete
in Stanford history. Invitations for the
ladies have been engraved. Programs
will be made of black and silver
suede and will also follow out the sil
houette idea.
A varied program has been com
pleted by Norton Thornton and the
water sports committee for the water
carnival Saturday morning. The fea
ture race of the day will be a quarter
mile swim with national and Olympic
champions entered in the event.
Three novelty races have been plan
ned and the junior class will give four
silver loving cups.
The annual interclass Swedish
Marathon will take place as usual.
This year a strong freshman squad
will threaten the supremacy of the
junior team, winners of the event last
year. Ed Throndson, Herb Marsh, and
"Whitye" Burns will present exhibi
tion and comedy diving numbers.
Interpret Circus Life
Interpreting the joys, loves, and
sorrows of a circus life, the fast-mov
ing musical comedy, "Moving On," will
conclude the week-end of gaiety when
it is produced in the Assembly Hall
Saturday night.
With numbers written by Neal
Spaulding, George Starbird, Grif Wil
liams, and Bill Robinson, this season' 3
opera promises to be one of the most
ambitious ever presented on the Stan
ford stage. Tom Watt and Helen Ward
with a host of other campus stars are
featured in the production.
