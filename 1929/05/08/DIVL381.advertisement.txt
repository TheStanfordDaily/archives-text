THE structural difference between a Dayton Steel Racquet
and other types is as striking as that between an airplane
and a motor car. In an airplane tunnel test the Dayton showed
48% less air resistance. That's why it gets your ball over quicker
—20% quicker. That's why it actually gives you the jump on
speedier players. You've a right to demand facts. Here's the
second question of a series:
Q. How does the thinner construction of the Dayton affect
its comparison with a standard wood racquet in size, weight.,
and balance?
A. Measurements at the Y. C. Lab. showed the Dayton to be
exactly its rated weight, the wood 2% over weight. With the
wood racquet as a standard for dimensions, center of gravity,
moments of inertia, etc., the average variation of the Dayton
was less than 5%. Prof. L. H. Young of M. 1.T., who made the
tests, says"The makers are to be commended upon an exceeding
ly clever piece of design." Dayton Steel Racquet Co., Day ton, O.
