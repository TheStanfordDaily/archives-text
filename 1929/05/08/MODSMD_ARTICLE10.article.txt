Man's petroleum supply may suffice
but twenty years, his coal hardly a
century. Unless he can devise a new,
a practical source of energy within a
hundred years, his great civilization
built on coal and steel is doomed, and
galley slaves and serfs may reappear.
This is the belief of Dr. Merman
Spriehr, director of the Carnegie In
stitution's Laboratory which is now
being built on the Stanford campus.
He and his colleagues are preparing
to begin investigation on this work
within two months, paving the way
to the utilization of the ever-present
but inaccessible source of power—
sunlight.
Very rarely is necessity the parent
of invention where new principles are
concerned, but now in this highly com
plex tank it is the duty of scientists

I to exercise foresight in a matter that
I touches the very heart of human wcl

a prodigious rate —his world of en

of petroleum. But his world is waste

cipal of his legacy, and pays no heed

The source of the energy which
drives his machines is not a steady

of internal-combustion engines, can

a series on research ivork on the Stanford
campus. Dr. Spochr, who has been eon-

nearly twenty years, returns to Stanford

Man's petroleum supply may suffice
but twenty years, his coal hardly a
century. Unless he can devise a new,
a practical source of energy within a
hundred years, his great civilization
built on coal and steel is doomed, and
galley slaves and serfs may reappear.
This is the belief of Dr. Merman
Spriehr, director of the Carnegie In
stitution's Laboratory which is now
being built on the Stanford campus.
He and his colleagues are preparing
to begin investigation on this work
within two months, paving the way
to the utilization of the ever-present
but inaccessible source of power—
sunlight.
Very rarely is necessity the parent
of invention where new principles are
concerned, but now in this highly com
plex tank it is the duty of scientists

I to exercise foresight in a matter that
I touches the very heart of human wcl
! fare. Civilized man is using energy at
a prodigious rate —his world of en
(glnes and motors is swallowing ton
after ton of coal, gallon after gallon
of petroleum. But his world is waste
ful —even profligate—it uses the prin
cipal of his legacy, and pays no heed
I to the future.
