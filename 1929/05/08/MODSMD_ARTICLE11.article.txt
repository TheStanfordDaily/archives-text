# HONOR SOCIETY PLEA FOR MOONEY-BILLINGS SENT TO GOV. YOUNG
## Pi Sigma Alpha Asks State Head to Reconsider; Justice Ignored 
### 
Pi Sigma Alpha, Political Science
Honor Fraternity, sent a petition to
Governor C. C. Young Monday night,
asking for reconsideration of the Tom
Mooney and Warren K. Billings case.
Following is the context of the plea
which was signed by the members of
Pi Sigma Alpha:
To His Excellency, C. C. Young,
Governor of the State of California:
We, the members of Pi Sigma
Alpha, Political Science Honor Frater
nity of Stanford University, believe in
the principles of justice upon which
this government is founded. We be
lieve that the maintenance of justice
is the cornerstone of constitutional
government, and that the miscarriage
of justice will undermine that confi
dence in free government on which
our political institutions rest.
After a serious consideration of the
available evidence, we are convinced
that these principles of justice were
violated in the trial and subsequent
imprisonment of Tom Mooney and
Warren K. Billings. An examination
of the evidence clearly indicates that
these men were victims of hysteria,
class-feeling, and popular resentment.
Subsequent revelations prove that the
verdict of guilt against them was
based on framed evidence and per
jured testimony. Because of this trav
esty of justice, these men are being
punished for a crime of which they
are innocent.
We believe that the principles upon
which the government of the United
States and the State of California
fare founded, guarantees justice to
every man, rich or poor, regardless
of class or creed, political beliefs or
economic doctrines. In the words of
the great French Cardinal, "While in
these hands dwelt empires, the hum
blest craftsman, the obscurest vassal,
the very leper shrinking from the sun
—though loathed by charity, might
ask for justice." Institutions of free
government must rest on the eternal
principles of fair play.
We feel that the continued impris
onment of these innocent men is a
blot upon the good name of California,
and places our state in a bad light
before the world.
The pardoning power of the govern
ment furnishe sthe only legal means
of redressing the injustice accorded
to Tom Mooney and Warren K. Bil
lings. We, therefore, respectfully pe
tition Your Excellency to grant an un
conditional pardon to them.

jured testimony. Because of this trav
esty of justice, these men are being
punished for a crime of which they
are innocent.
We believe that the principles upon
which the government of the United
States and the State of California
fare founded, guarantees justice to
every man, rich or poor, regardless
of class or creed, political beliefs or
economic doctrines. In the words of
the great French Cardinal, "While in
these hands dwelt empires, the hum
blest craftsman, the obscurest vassal,
the very leper shrinking from the sun
—though loathed by charity, might
ask for justice." Institutions of free
government must rest on the eternal
principles of fair play.
We feel that the continued impris
onment of these innocent men is a
blot upon the good name of California,
and places our state in a bad light
before the world.
The pardoning power of the govern
ment furnishe sthe only legal means
of redressing the injustice accorded
to Tom Mooney and Warren K. Bil
lings. We, therefore, respectfully pe
tition Your Excellency to grant an un
conditional pardon to them.
Pi Sigma Alpha, Political Science
Honor Fraternity, sent a petition to
Governor C. C. Young Monday night,
asking for reconsideration of the Tom
Mooney and Warren K. Billings case.
Following is the context of the plea
which was signed by the members of
Pi Sigma Alpha:
To His Excellency, C. C. Young,
Governor of the State of California:
We, the members of Pi Sigma
Alpha, Political Science Honor Frater
nity of Stanford University, believe in
the principles of justice upon which
this government is founded. We be
lieve that the maintenance of justice
is the cornerstone of constitutional
government, and that the miscarriage
of justice will undermine that confi
dence in free government on which
our political institutions rest.
After a serious consideration of the
available evidence, we are convinced
that these principles of justice were
violated in the trial and subsequent
imprisonment of Tom Mooney and
Warren K. Billings. An examination
of the evidence clearly indicates that
these men were victims of hysteria,
class-feeling, and popular resentment.
Subsequent revelations prove that the
verdict of guilt against them was
based on framed evidence and per
jured testimony. Because of this trav
esty of justice, these men are being
punished for a crime of which they
are innocent.
We believe that the principles upon
which the government of the United
States and the State of California
fare founded, guarantees justice to
every man, rich or poor, regardless
of class or creed, political beliefs or
economic doctrines. In the words of
the great French Cardinal, "While in
these hands dwelt empires, the hum
blest craftsman, the obscurest vassal,
the very leper shrinking from the sun
—though loathed by charity, might
ask for justice." Institutions of free
government must rest on the eternal
principles of fair play.
We feel that the continued impris
onment of these innocent men is a
blot upon the good name of California,
and places our state in a bad light
before the world.
The pardoning power of the govern
ment furnishe sthe only legal means
of redressing the injustice accorded
to Tom Mooney and Warren K. Bil
lings. We, therefore, respectfully pe
tition Your Excellency to grant an un
conditional pardon to them.
