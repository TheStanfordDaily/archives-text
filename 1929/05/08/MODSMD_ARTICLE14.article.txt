"The May Chaparral on sale tomor
row contains a wide variety of local
wisecracks and good wholesome razz,"
said the Ancient One yesterday, "and
its close relation with campus institu
tions is sure to arouse many chuckles
and much comment."
Among the longer articles in the
"Local Interest" number is the "Woo
ing of Hooverwatha," by Bob Paine,
which relates how Wilbur-ha-ha was
enticed to the land of the Potomac.
There is also "The Suit Case," or
"The Moth Ball Murders," a Philo
Vance abroad story by the same au

other credo, "Chappy Believes," which
ably tells the beliefs of many of the
Stanford students concerning the Uni

Among the drawings is a full-page
illustration of the unfortunate effect
of the "Front Page" on the Stanford
Daily, penned by Gould and O'Meara.
"Encinasylum" is a conception of the
present-day rushing system, and
Elizabeth Roper Jordan, '25, has sent
in a drawing.
On the editorial page is a report of
the Theatre Fund and its progress.
