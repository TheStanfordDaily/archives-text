# DAILY FILES REVEAL COMPLAINTS ON COMMONS, UNION FOOD SINCE 1922
## 
### Marvin Skipwith 
The Encina Commons opened Octo
ber 1, 1923, a year and six months
after the opening of the Union Din
ing Hall, under the management of
Miss Etta Handy. The new Encina
Commons were also put under the
supervision of Miss Handy.
Even before the opening of tho
Commons, there had been complaints
regarding the management of the
Union dining room. Many of these
found their way into the Daily, either
through the editorial columns or the
campus opinion department.
Ono of the first was on November
2, 1922, when the editor of the Daily
started to describe the faults of the
Union Cafeteria, but became inarticu
late, concluding with the statement,
"the editor's typewriter simply re
fuses to work. It has a conscience."
Cranner was opened January 2, 1924,
but tho dining hall there was closed
February 29, 1925. According to a
statement from Miss Handy, only
fifty-two men had paid their board
there, while at least a hundred were
needed before the hall could be put on

an even basis. No reason was given
in the statement why the hall was re
ceiving such poor support from the
residents of the hall.
A statement was made by Comp- !
troller Roth at this time that begin- !
nlng the next autumn quarter all men
living in dormitories would be re- \
[ quired to eat in the dining hall oper- j
ated in connection with them. Dr. 1
| Wilbur at the same time issued this j
statement: "We have waited patient-;
ly for students to take advantage of 1
the facilities offered them, but their j
failure to do so, and the fact that the '
accommodations are now adequate to j
take care of all men living in the â€¢
dormitories has made University ac- j
, tion imperative."
Branner dining hall was never re
opened.
"There have been grumblings about j
the eating situation on the campus,"
j said an editorial note March 3, 1925, ;
prefacing a statement by Comptroller
Roth. In this statement he explained
the complete organization and re-
I sponsibility of the dining halls.
