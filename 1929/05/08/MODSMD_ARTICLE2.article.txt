# JUNIOR WEEK WATER SPORTS TO FEATURE QUARTER-MILE SWIM
## 
### 
Featuring a quarter-mile swim, the
Swedish Marathon, exhibition diving,
and many novelty events, Norton
Thornton and the junior class will
present the annual junior week water
wports carnival at 10:30 o'clock Sat
urday morning in Encina pool. Low
water in Lagunita forced the sports
committee to switch the carnival from
the lake to the plunge.
The "big" race of the day will be
the 440-yard swim, featuring national
and Olympic champions. This race
will take the place of the former
cross-lake swim. Three novelty events
have been arranged, a one-length
swim with the contestant's hands tied
behind his back, a towel-balancing
race, and a balloon race.
The junior class will award silver
loving cups to the first three places
in the 440-yard race and to the high
point man in the novelty events.
As a special laugh-provoking fea
ture, two four-man teams will stage a
night-shirt relay.
Ed Throndson and Herb Marsh will
present some exhibition diving, and
Throndson and "Whitey" Burns have
developed a comedy diving number.
