# Junior, Sophomore Women To Meet On Track Today
## 
### 
The juniors and sophomores will
meet in the next women's track meet
of the season this afternoon. Neither
team has shown itself to be particu
larly strong, but they are well-matched
and the meet should be a close one.
Marion Holley, the most outstanding
member of the '30 team, is expected
to enter the standing broadjump, an
event in which she has not competed
before but in which she has made
record-breaking scores in practice.
She will also compete in the high
jump, and one of the dashes. Margaret
Bullard, sophomore captain, will prob
ably run up a good score for her
team.
