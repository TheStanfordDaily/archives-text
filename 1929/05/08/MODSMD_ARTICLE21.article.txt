# Junior Women's Swimming Team Beats Seniors, 33-25
## 
### 
In the second women's swimming
meet of the season, held yesterday
afternoon, the Junior women downed
the Senior swimming team 33-25. A
scarcity of entrants, particularly on
the Senior team, resulted in a lack
of competition. Maxine Gushing bet
tered the time for the 25-yard breast
stroke made in the Frosh-Soph meet
j by 1.8 seconds, swimming the course
in 20.6 seconds.
