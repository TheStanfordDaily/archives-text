# Is Management to Blame?
## 
### 
The review in today's article on the Union and Encina Commons of
the dissatisfaction that has existed with these two student-patronized
organizations points, as has been said, to a condition that implies ineffi
ciency in the management of those organizations.
The high price, already discussed, further substantiates this belief that
the cause of the entire trouble is in inefficient management.
The University administration has made no effort to offer explanation
of that high price. Until it does, the Daily and the majority of the
student body will believe that it can only be explained in the main part by
inefficiency. Inefficiency looks for its cause to mismanagement. If the
present management is incapable of adjusting the trouble, in fairness to
the men involved, a new management should be installed. The responsi
bility rests upon the shoulders of the University administration.
