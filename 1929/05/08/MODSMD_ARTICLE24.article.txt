# Crew To Be Considered
## 
### 
And now after ten years during which Stanford has not had crew and
during which a great deal of talk has been current about it, the problem
will be definitely placed before the student body for its decision. The
Executive Committee has seen fit to grant the student body the privilege
of expressing its opinion upon the matter upon the petition of Skull and
Snakes.
Said one opposing meml)er of the Executive Committee during its
session last night, "The student body doesn't think about such matters.
It'll vote yes, and let it go at that." This is a moot question which only
can be answered by the individual members of the student body them
selves.
The Daily has shown that'-crew can be reinstated at Stanford at a
comparatively reasonable cost. Graduate Manager Alfred R. Masters is
quoted as having termed the Daily figures on crew "ridiculous." The
Daily feels that its figures were arrived at by just means and are accurate
as comparative figures.

As a classic sport worthy of a place among the other great sports at
Stanford, crew should be reinstated. It will offer a new field for men
otherwise not participating in major sports. It will add to Stanford's
national athletic prestige. It will be equal to its cost.
A substantial lacking from the student Ixxly in the spring election
will go a long ways toward re-establishing crew at Stanford.
The Daily will carry articles discussing the sport and its place at
Stanford giving both sides of the question so that the student body may
be well informed upon the matter before expressing its opinion.
