# A 						Commendable Action

"We, therefore, respectfully petition Your Excellency to grant an
unconditional pardon to them (Tom Mooney and Warren K. Billings)."
Thus does Pi Sigma Alpha, Political Science fraternity, take its stand
upon the present Mooney-Billings case waiting the consideration of
Governor C. C. Young.
It is a commendable stand, a stand that evidences the opinion oT a
large majority of the present college generation. Liberal organizations in
universities all over the country are taking up the cause to gain justice
for these men now in prison for a crime that all evidence proves they did
not commit.
Such an attitude and such action augurs well for the future. An active,
intelligent minority united toward the end of seeing justice done in the
political life of the United States will go far to make justice more of a
reality than it has been in the past. The Daily heartily endorses the action
of Pi Sigma Alpha.
