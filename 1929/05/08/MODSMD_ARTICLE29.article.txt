THE BACHELOR FATHER. Curran
Theatre.
Sometimes we think that the words,
"New York cast, direct from brilliant
New York run," are merely a sop to
impress us gullible Westerners with
a play that is fair-to-middling. But
this is emphatically not the case with
"The Bachelor Father" which opened
Monday night at the Curran Theatre.
David Belasco's presentation of this
play gives us everything that we
would look for in a New York produc
tion. The play, written by Edward
Childs Carpenter, is a superbly amus
ing comedy with lines that for clever
ness compare very favorably with
Bernard Shaw. And the cast is capable
and smooth in performance; with C.
Aubrey Smith as the blustery old Sir
Basil Winterton, V.C., K.C.8., K.C.G.M.,
giving, in my estimation, the best
characterization.
You can imagine the comedy possi
bilities of the story. The opening
scene introduces to us Sir Basil, a
grouchy, fussy, blithering old million
aire bachelor whose chief interest
throughout a busy life has been the
ladies. But Sir Basil is past middle
age, now, and the women are no
longer his main interest.
He decides, for the sake of variety,
to send to the four corners of the
earth and gather together his chil
dren —the fruits of what some would
term "past indiscretions." So his so
licitor travels to Italy, to America,
and to another part of England from
Sir Basil's mansion in Surrey, Eng
land, and arranges for the three chil
dren —the only ones officially listed —
to visit their father and see him for
the first time.
Then the children arrive, the three
of them hovering around twenty years
of age. There is his daughter, Maria
Credaro, whose mother is the one
time famous prima donna. Maria has
a fine voice, but her mother deapp.irs
of her becoming a great singer be
cause she is half English and hasn't
the passion in her makeup that a
prima donna requires. Adriana Dori
handles this part nicely.
June Walker, who is making her de
but with San Francisco theatregoers
but has a long list of successes to her

credit in New York, plays the part . l f
Sir Basil's other daughter, Antoinette
("Tony") Flagg, straight from Hogan's
Alley, New York. Her mother was a
captivating, red-headed vaudeville act
ress who had intrigued Sir Basil in
hia more impressionable days. Tony
is the comedy hit of the show. Her
always-out-of-breath sort of voice
combined with her American slang
and vivacious personality "put her
over big" with the first night audi
ence at the Curran.
The only difficulty with June
Walker's part of Tony is that the
character, in order to make it scream
ingly funny, is caricatured more than
the other parts. This, to me, makes it
slightly out of harmony with the rest
of the play.
Sir Basil's son is Geoffrey Trent,
played by Rex O'Malley. Geoffrey has
aspirations to be a pianist and com
poser. He falls in love with Maria, and
goes off to marry her when he finds
out that she is not his sister because
Sir Basil is not his father, "even
though he could have beon."
The second act of "The Bachelor
Father" is one of the best acta you
can bee in a long time. Th.j third act
falls down decidedly by comparison.
The author injects an unnecessary
note of seriousness into it, and does
not work out the various complica
tions as cleverly as he might have
done.
Sir Basil, in the beginning, sent for
his "brats" to look them over and, if
necessary, to put them in their place.
But, under the leadership of the
"pepper-pot" Tony, the three children
reverse the situation and show their
father what's what and why. Sir
Basil's attitude, of course, changes in
the progress of the play from one of
absolute disinterestedness and uncon
cern with his children to the pro
verbial fatherly mood of love and
deep interest and pride.
"The Bachelor Father" is highly
recommended, unless you have no
sense of humor, or cannot appreciate
the delicious comic possibilities of
t>eing a bachelor father and suddenly
dociding to gather together your off
spring, you have never seen, after
twenty years have passed.
