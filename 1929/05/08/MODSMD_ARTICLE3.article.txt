BOURGES, France, May 7. (JP) â€”
Five French military aviators were
killed at the Avord aviation field last
night, their bombing plane crashing
to earth when a wing dropped off.
The bodies could be taken from the
plane only this morning after experts
had removed two unexploded bombs
from the wreck of the machine.
