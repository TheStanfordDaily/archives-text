The Editor, Sir:
Any Stanford man who dares advo
cate changes other than those of diet
or of athletic policies certainly merits
being put off the boat. I realize that
Sturgis Riddle must be, if not
squelched, at least appalled by now,
but I feel inclined to add just one
more word of criticism —I hope of a
constructive nature.
I have attended most of my classes
at Stanford for four long years, and
in return can boast of having been
educated to the degree of being unable
to tolerate Babbitry—in others. I can
also feel superior to those self-satis
fied mediocrities who so foolishly
vaunt an assumed superiority. But for
tunately I am also sufficiently sophis

ticated to be vastly tolerant when ad
vocating change involves an effort.
Accordingly, I can appreciate a cer
tain amount of smug complacency in
my instructors and I rejoice that the
reforms they BUggest are always in
the avstract. For afte rail their mis
sion is to help us become intelligent
citizens. And surely, Mr. Riddle, an
intelligent citizen, attending a univer
sity which has its greatest faith in
prosperity, should choose other fields
from which to win his converts. Go
harrangue dissatisfied and bored peo
ple, but for the sake of tolerance and
hedonism, please cease disturbing our
slumbers.
Yours in all sincere want,
L. H. Kirkpatrick.
