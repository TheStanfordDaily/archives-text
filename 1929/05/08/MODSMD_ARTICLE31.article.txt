this source to but a relatively small
proportion of the total so that all the
water power of the continent cannot
suffice.
Sun May Be Used
A little heat is probably given to
the surface of the earth from the
interior, another small amount is the
result of certain radioactive chemical
changes, the action of the tides con
tributes some, and a further amount
is received from radiation from the
stars and the moon. Artificial petro
leum may be produced by the distilla
tion of oil shales and the liquefaction
of coal, or some other substitute for
petroleum may be discovered. But
these amounts are inadequate and in
significant when compared with the
primal source of our energy—the ra
diations from the sun.
The potential solar energy is high—
the sunlight falling on one acre of
land during a growing season of
ninety days is equal to the energy
contained in 243 tons of anthracite
coal. The method of changing these
rays into a form whereby they can
run the engines of the world, how
ever, is a most difficult problem—at
present, an impossible one. Thus far
only the plants have been able to use
sunlight as energy, and on this ability
rests the food and principal energy
supply of present-day civilization.
Photosynthesis Is Riddle
But this process of photosynthesis—
the reconversion in plants of animal
waste products into valuable and edi
ble sugar and starch —is infinitely
slow. Science is attempting to evolve
a faster method whereby the rays of
the sun will be turned on the cheap
raw materials of the plant—carbon
dioxide and water —forming Btarch,
sugar, or other material that can

serve as fuel or be converted into
fuel.
It is true that if ever the tremen
dous energy supply within the atom
is tapped, all these other sources will
be forgotten. But this delving into
atoms and protons and electrons is a
highly complex task, and science ex
pects but little from it; if researchers
engaged in this problem ever do reach
their goal, it may not be for many de
cades.
Constructing Laboratory
Therefore, the Carnegie Institution
has also laid plans for investigations
on the utilization of sunlight. Its lab
oratory, established first at Carmel,
will soon be shifted to Stanford. On
twenty acres of land leased from the
University is being built a laboratory
plant equipped for the most delicate
kind of research.
A two-story building, containing
chemical laboratories, a library, and
numerous offices, will be the central
structure. Added to this will be a
series of greenhouses, with experi
mental gardens. Accomodations will
be provided for lumping between ten
and fifteen regular workers and a
number of guest research students.
Noted Experts Secured
Working under the direction of Dr.
Spoehr will be scientists who have
won international recognition for
their investigations. Dr. H. M. Hall,
now honorary curator of the her
barium at the University of Califor
nia, will bring his entire staff and
equipment to the campus. He will do
special work oh plant taxonomy.
From Carmel will come Dr. J. H. C.
Smith, who has recently worked undor
the Nobel prize winner, Pregl of Aus
tria. Dr. Smith and his co-workerß will
work toward the development of a
rofined technique in the handling of
microscopic amounts of material. Of
the substances playing an Important
role in the process of potosyntheals
only small amounts are available and

their extraction requires the most
painstaking labor. Thus, it was point
ed out, obtaining an ounce of xantho
phyll, the brilliant yellow pigment
which is in all leaves, requires the
extraction of about 1800 pounds of
leaves.
Dr. Harold Strain, a graduate of
Stanford, and a Ph.D. of the chemis
try department, is also on the staff
of the new laboratory.
No Courses Offered
The connection with the University
will be purely co-operative. No courses
will be given by the laboratory staff,
but occasionally members of the Uni
versity faculty, or graduate students,
may use the facilities of the labora
tory for special problems.
Within two months this new labora
tory—the second coming to Stanford
backed by the resources of the great
Carnegie Foundation —will be ready
for occupancy. Millions of dollars may
be used in this search for energy. If
the workers achieve success, the
money spent—no matter how much it
may be —will be an unparalleled in
vestment.

The potential solar energy is high—
the sunlight falling on one acre of
land during a growing season of
ninety days is equal to the energy
contained in 243 tons of anthracite
coal. The method of changing these
rays into a form whereby they can
run the engines of the world, how
ever, is a most difficult problem—at
present, an impossible one. Thus far
only the plants have been able to use
sunlight as energy, and on this ability
rests the food and principal energy
supply of present-day civilization.
Photosynthesis Is Riddle
But this process of photosynthesis—
the reconversion in plants of animal
waste products into valuable and edi
ble sugar and starch —is infinitely
slow. Science is attempting to evolve
a faster method whereby the rays of
the sun will be turned on the cheap
raw materials of the plant—carbon
dioxide and water —forming Btarch,
sugar, or other material that can

serve as fuel or be converted into
fuel.
It is true that if ever the tremen
dous energy supply within the atom
is tapped, all these other sources will
be forgotten. But this delving into
atoms and protons and electrons is a
highly complex task, and science ex
pects but little from it; if researchers
engaged in this problem ever do reach
their goal, it may not be for many de
cades.
Constructing Laboratory
Therefore, the Carnegie Institution
has also laid plans for investigations
on the utilization of sunlight. Its lab
oratory, established first at Carmel,
will soon be shifted to Stanford. On
twenty acres of land leased from the
University is being built a laboratory
plant equipped for the most delicate
kind of research.
A two-story building, containing
chemical laboratories, a library, and
numerous offices, will be the central
structure. Added to this will be a
series of greenhouses, with experi
mental gardens. Accomodations will
be provided for lumping between ten
and fifteen regular workers and a
number of guest research students.
Noted Experts Secured
Working under the direction of Dr.
Spoehr will be scientists who have
won international recognition for
their investigations. Dr. H. M. Hall,
now honorary curator of the her
barium at the University of Califor
nia, will bring his entire staff and
equipment to the campus. He will do
special work oh plant taxonomy.
From Carmel will come Dr. J. H. C.
Smith, who has recently worked undor
the Nobel prize winner, Pregl of Aus
tria. Dr. Smith and his co-workerß will
work toward the development of a
rofined technique in the handling of
microscopic amounts of material. Of
the substances playing an Important
role in the process of potosyntheals
only small amounts are available and

their extraction requires the most
painstaking labor. Thus, it was point
ed out, obtaining an ounce of xantho
phyll, the brilliant yellow pigment
which is in all leaves, requires the
extraction of about 1800 pounds of
leaves.
Dr. Harold Strain, a graduate of
Stanford, and a Ph.D. of the chemis
try department, is also on the staff
of the new laboratory.

The connection with the University
will be purely co-operative. No courses
will be given by the laboratory staff,
but occasionally members of the Uni

may use the facilities of the labora
tory for special problems.
Within two months this new labora
tory—the second coming to Stanford
backed by the resources of the great
Carnegie Foundation —will be ready
for occupancy. Millions of dollars may
be used in this search for energy. If

the sun will be turned on the cheap
raw materials of the plant—carbon
dioxide and water —forming Btarch,
sugar, or other material that can

serve as fuel or be converted into
fuel.
It is true that if ever the tremen
dous energy supply within the atom
is tapped, all these other sources will
be forgotten. But this delving into
atoms and protons and electrons is a
highly complex task, and science ex
pects but little from it; if researchers
engaged in this problem ever do reach
their goal, it may not be for many de
cades.
Constructing Laboratory
Therefore, the Carnegie Institution
has also laid plans for investigations
on the utilization of sunlight. Its lab
oratory, established first at Carmel,
will soon be shifted to Stanford. On
twenty acres of land leased from the
University is being built a laboratory
plant equipped for the most delicate
kind of research.
A two-story building, containing
chemical laboratories, a library, and
numerous offices, will be the central
structure. Added to this will be a
series of greenhouses, with experi
mental gardens. Accomodations will
be provided for lumping between ten
and fifteen regular workers and a
number of guest research students.
Noted Experts Secured
Working under the direction of Dr.
Spoehr will be scientists who have
won international recognition for
their investigations. Dr. H. M. Hall,
now honorary curator of the her
barium at the University of Califor
nia, will bring his entire staff and
equipment to the campus. He will do
special work oh plant taxonomy.
From Carmel will come Dr. J. H. C.
Smith, who has recently worked undor
the Nobel prize winner, Pregl of Aus
tria. Dr. Smith and his co-workerß will
work toward the development of a
rofined technique in the handling of
microscopic amounts of material. Of
the substances playing an Important
role in the process of potosyntheals
only small amounts are available and

their extraction requires the most
painstaking labor. Thus, it was point
ed out, obtaining an ounce of xantho
phyll, the brilliant yellow pigment
which is in all leaves, requires the
extraction of about 1800 pounds of
leaves.
Dr. Harold Strain, a graduate of
Stanford, and a Ph.D. of the chemis
try department, is also on the staff
of the new laboratory.
No Courses Offered
The connection with the University
will be purely co-operative. No courses
will be given by the laboratory staff,
but occasionally members of the Uni
versity faculty, or graduate students,
may use the facilities of the labora
tory for special problems.
Within two months this new labora
tory—the second coming to Stanford
backed by the resources of the great
Carnegie Foundation —will be ready
for occupancy. Millions of dollars may
be used in this search for energy. If
the workers achieve success, the
money spent—no matter how much it
may be —will be an unparalleled in
vestment.

and cost of efficient utilization limit
this source to but a relatively small
proportion of the total so that all the
water power of the continent cannot
suffice.
Sun May Be Used
A little heat is probably given to
the surface of the earth from the
interior, another small amount is the
result of certain radioactive chemical
changes, the action of the tides con
tributes some, and a further amount
is received from radiation from the
stars and the moon. Artificial petro
leum may be produced by the distilla
tion of oil shales and the liquefaction
of coal, or some other substitute for
petroleum may be discovered. But
these amounts are inadequate and in
significant when compared with the
primal source of our energy—the ra
diations from the sun.
The potential solar energy is high—
the sunlight falling on one acre of
land during a growing season of
ninety days is equal to the energy
contained in 243 tons of anthracite
coal. The method of changing these
rays into a form whereby they can
run the engines of the world, how
ever, is a most difficult problem—at
present, an impossible one. Thus far
only the plants have been able to use
sunlight as energy, and on this ability
rests the food and principal energy
supply of present-day civilization.
Photosynthesis Is Riddle
But this process of photosynthesis—
the reconversion in plants of animal
waste products into valuable and edi
ble sugar and starch —is infinitely
slow. Science is attempting to evolve
a faster method whereby the rays of
the sun will be turned on the cheap
raw materials of the plant—carbon
dioxide and water —forming Btarch,
sugar, or other material that can

serve as fuel or be converted into
fuel.
