# SONGS, CHORUSES IN "MOVING ON" MAKE OPERA NOTEWORTHY
## Sixty People on Stage for First Act Finale; Seat Sale to Continue 
### John Rogers 
With the largest chorus that has
ever been used in a campus musical
show, singing the best songs and do
ing the trickiest dances, "Moving On,"
to be presented in the Assembly Hall
at 8:20 Saturday night, promises to
be one of the few Junior Operas which
will go down in local dramatic his
tory. Under the direction of Frances
Boone, who has coached all the danc
ing in Stanford productions for the
last three years, a chorus of sixteen
women and eight men will go through
several of the fastest and most com
plicated dances ever seen on the local
«tage.
In addition to the dancing chorus of
twenty-four, there is a men's chorus
of ten which not only gives extra
volume to the numbers sung by the
ensemble, but also executes a few
dance steps as well. Grif Williams,
who has charge of the music of the
operetta, has been coaching the group
of men, eighteen in number, in three
songs which are written in three-part
harmony. The Men's Glee Club quar
tette and a women's trio will sing
these numbers, which, in addition to
the principals, who will carry the
melody, will make a total of twenty
five voices in these special songs:
"Living in a Tent," "A Cloud Passed
Over the Moon," and the "Tent Song."
Fred Pearman is working up a fast
clcg dance to be used during a chorus
number, and Frances Boone will fea
ture a Nautch dance, which will ap
pear after a women's chorus of six
has done an Oriental number, while
the men sing the "Living in a Tent"
song.
Another innovation will be a banjo
chorus of ten which will be used in
the finale of the first act. For the
theme jazz number, "Moving On," the
eight principals and eight freaks, and
al lthe choruses will be used, making
a total of more than sixty people to
be squeezed onto the small stage.
Tickets for the opera are on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union
from 9 to 5 o'clock every day this
week. They are being offered at three
prices—sl.so, $1.25, and $1.00. One of
the largest ticket sales on the campus
was held yesterday afternoon, but
there are still several good seats left
for those who buy theirs early.
