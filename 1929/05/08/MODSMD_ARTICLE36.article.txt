# STANFORD, CALIFORNIA CREWS CLASHED FOR FIRST TIME IN 1904
## 
### 
Rowing got its start as an intercol
legiate sport on the Pacific Coast in
1904 when both Stanford and the Uni
versity of California turned out crews.
The first race, with four-oared shells,
took place on the Oakland Estuary
and resulted in victory for the Berke
ley boat.
In 1906 Stanford hired Dan Murphy
as coach and changed over to the
eiglit-oared shell. California followed
suit, but this time the Cardinals won
the regatta.
Tn 1909 crew was temporarily abol
lished at both institutions but the
students organized a boating club and
continued their rowing. The 1910 sea
son was so successful that the sport
was reinstated.
University of Washington joined
the two southern schools in 1912 and
made the annual Card-Bear regatta a
triangle affair. Stanford easily won
the race that year, and sent a crew
to the Poughkeepsie intercollegiates
where the Cardinals finished a bad
last. However, Stanford was the first
Western university to send a boat to
the Poughkepesie race.
In 1915 Frank "Husky" Guerena,
former varsity coxswain, was secured
as crew coach. Again the Cardinals
Avon the triangle i-egatta on Oakland
Estuary and again went east to
Poughkeepsie. After getting off to a
bad start, the Stanford shell came up
strong at the end of the race to finish
second, eight feet behind the winner.
The war seriously injured Stan
ford's rowing activities. The teams
began to decline until the close of
the 1920 season the sport was sus
pended from the athletic curriculum.
The efforts of Skull and Snakes for
the return of crew to the Stanford
sports program is the first organized
move of this kind since 1920.
