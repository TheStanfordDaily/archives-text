# Committee Puts Rowing Question To Student Vote
## Al Masters Brands Daily's Crew Cost Estimates As "Ridiculous" 
### Anson Reeder 
The second step in the bringing of
crew back to the Farm was reached
last night with the decision of the
Executive Committee to place on the
ballot at the student elections May
21 the proposition that "The sport of
crew be inaugurated at Stanford."
The proposition was passed follow
ing a heated argument by members
of the Committee. The final vote was
four to three favoring the proposition.
Yes —Krough, Rothert, Harder, and
Wheatley. No —Cushing, Baker, and
Bodle.
As a prelude to the voting, many
arguments were made pro and con on
the subject of crew. The main ones
in opposition being—there is no re
turn on the investment; it is too
strenuous a sport; and that rowing is
a dead issue here.
The general concensus of opinion of
those favoring an expression by the
Student Body on the subject was that,
as crew has been an issue for a good
many years, it is high time that the
students be given a chance to state
their feelings in regard to the matter.
One of the strongest opponents to
the issue declared that "The student
body would probably vote for the re
turn of crew if it were put on the
ballot because they never do any real
thinking on subjects of this kind any
way." But the fact remains that the
student body will have ample time to
discuss the subject intelligently be
fore the election May 21.
As a sidelight on the crew question
A1 Masters, general manager of the
Board of Athletic Control, stated yes
terday that the claim of the Daily
that crew could be reinstated here for
$22,675 was "ridiculous." This state
ment was made regardless of the fact
that the Daily's figures were compiled
from information received from two
universities where crew has been a
sport for years.
Masters also stated that the Univer
sity of California's cost of $29,000 an
nually for supporting crew was in no
way comparable with the estimated
cost at Stanford. But he neglected to
say why.
