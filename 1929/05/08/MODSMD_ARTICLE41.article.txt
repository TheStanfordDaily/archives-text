The Barbarian baseball team de
feated the El Campo nine yesterday
to cinch the championship of League
II in the intramural tournament. Ben
Carter, Campo pitcher, blew up in the
second inning and was responsible
for four runs. The Barbs scored four
more in the fifth frame by some smart
hitting.
Kim Dyer, pitching for Sigma Nu,
had things pretty much his won way
in the contest against Piii Sigma
Kappa. Sequoia I was enabled to walk
into the championship of League 111,
when Theta Delta Chi failed to put in
an appearance at the diamond. Alpha
Kappa Lambda forfeited to Alpha Tau
Omega.
The semi-final games of the intra
mural tournament will be played
Tuesday afternoon at 4:15. Delta Chi
will meet the Barbarians and Sequoia
will meet El Toro.
