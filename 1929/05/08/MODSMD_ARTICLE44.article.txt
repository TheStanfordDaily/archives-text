# FOOD COMPLAINTS

(Continued from page one)
In an editorial June 3, 1926, Comp
troller Roth was quoted as saying
that until more dormitories were built
Branner dining hall would have to be
closed, as there were not enough men
in Toyon and Branner willing to eat
there to make it a success. In a pre
vious statement Miss Handy said 100
students were necessary for success
ful operation; the combined capacity
of Toyon and Branner is over 300.
The June 4, 1928 Daily reported a
conference between Comptroller Roth
and Miss Handy on possible methods
of inducing students who were not
required to, to eat at Encina, thus
filling the dining halls. No decision
was reached.
With the opening of the autumn
quarter of 1928 came the increase in
the Encina Commons prices, along
with six-day service. This created a
storm of comment in the editorial and
campus opinion sections of the Daily.
A freshman petition for seven-day
operation of the dining hall failed in
its purpose. A walkout by the Encina
eating clubs was barely averted.
This enumeration of complaints re
garding Encina and the Union from
the Daily's flies over a period of years
indicates that dissatisfaction with
University-managed dining halls has
persisted ever since their opening.
