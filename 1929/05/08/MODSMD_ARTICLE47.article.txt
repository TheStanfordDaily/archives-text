Use of slow motion pictures for the
study of rapidly moving objects, al
though thought to be a recent inven
tion, was a device used by Governor
Stanford half a century ago to study
the paces of his trotting horses.
Governor Stanford persuaded E. J.
Muybridge, a noted photographer in
action picture work, to take a series
of instantaneous pictures of horses in
motion to determine whether or not
his theories were correct.
Governor Wins Bet
The first experiments were con
ducted by Muybridge in 1872. In the
beginning only a single camera was
used. A great number of instantane
ous pictures were taken of Occident,
a famous trotting horse. Several of
these showed the horse with all four
feet off the ground while trotting
§>The°3e pictures proved that a fasl
1 trotting horse has all four feet ofi
i the ground twice during a complete
set of motion. They were received
throughout the world with astonish
mont and incredulity.
Twenty-Four Cameras
Twelve cameras were placec
along the track at a distance of twen
ty-one inches apart. The shutters wer«
released one after the other in rapic
succession by a clockwork.
