# STANFORD WILL HAVE MAN ON ALL-CALIFORNIA DEBATE TEAM FOR EASTERN MEETS
## 
### 
Stanford is to be represented on an
all-California debate team which will,
if present plans materialize, tour the
East next winter, it was decided at
Ex Committee last night. California,
Southern California, and Stanford will
each send one man on the trip.
The idea of a composite team is a
new one, proposed by Steve Halsted,
debate manager. The trio will prob
ably meet fifteen or twenty teams
representing the best schools in the
East. U.C. and S.C. have not formally
passed on the idea, but it is believed
that they are favorable. The 1928-29
Trojan debate manager will probably
manage the trip.

Thirty men were awarded their
block "S" for varsity track, and fif
teen frosh track men were voted their
block numerals.
Robert Clarke was named to fill a
vacancy on the election board.
Nine amendments were passed by
the Committee to be submitted to stu
dent body vote at the May elections.
Seven of them cover methods of mak
ing awards in major and minor sports;
one enlarges the election board from
six to twelve members; and the last
provides that the vice-president of
A.S.S.U. shall succeed to president on
the resignation or disqualification of
the latter. Also, the other offices shall
be filled by the Ex Committee.
