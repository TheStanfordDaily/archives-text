"The beginnings of the motion pic
ture art are to be found right here on
the Stanford ranch," said Louis Tol
liurst in his lecture last night in the
Assembly Hall.
Tolhurst illustrated his points by
showing pieces of different films, in
cluding "The New York Hat," star
ring Mary Pickford, which was one
of the first motion picture dramas.
"A new departure in the industry,"
continued Tolhurst, "was the intro
duction by D. W. Griffith of the long
feature picture, 'The Birth of a Na
tion,' starring Lillian Gish, being the
first of this kind."
"The Jazz Singer" was another
turning point in the motion picture
industry, introducing the sound ele
ment, but the principles used have
been known for a long time.
As an example of the newest, high
est type of sound film, Tolhurst
showed scenes from "The Innocents
of Paris," in which the tone and syn
chronization were perfect.
