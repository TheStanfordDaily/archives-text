# DEBENTURE PLAN PASSES SENATE BY THREE VOTES
## Senate Retains Farm Relief Plan Despite Objections of Hoover by Margin of 47-44 Republican Leaders Believe Senate Stand Will Not Be Supported by House Vote 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 8. (/P)— De
spite President Hoover's emphatically
expressed objections, the Senate voted
47 to 44 today to retain the export
debenture plan in its farm relief bill.

Thirteen Republican independents
joined an almost solid Democratic
vote in defeating an attempt by Ad
ministration forces to eliminate the
disputed provision.

The bill already passed by the
House does not provide for deben
tures, and inclusion of the plan in
the Senate measure was held by its
opponents tonight to complicate en
actment of farm relief legislation
greatly. Republican leaders contended
the House would reject the provision
overwhelmingly, especially in view of
the President's position.
They were confident that it would
be eliminated ultimately by the con
ference committee of Senate and
House members which must adjust
differences between the two meas
ures, but were plainly concerned over
the time it might take to settle the
controversy. The Senate has yet to
vote on the farm bill itself.
Only two Democrats left their party
line-up to join with Administration Re
publicans in the elimination move.
They were Wagner of New York and
Ransdell of Louisiana.
Two other Democrats, Walsh of
Massachusetts and King of Utah were
"paired" with Senators favoring the
plan, Shipstead, Farmer-Labor, Min
nesota, and Kendrick, Democrat, Wyo
ming, both of whom are ill in hos
pitals. Among the Republicans who
disregarded the wishes of the Presi
dent were Borah of Idaho and Brook
hart of lowa, who were leading cam
paigners for Mr. Hoover prior to the
recent election.
Word of the Senate vote reached
the House almost immediately, but
little comment was forthcoming. Rep
resentative Garner, of Texas, the
Democratic leader, predicted that the
House Democrats would be practically
solid in their support of the deben
ture plan at the time of a vote on
the conference report on the farm bill.
Representative Tilson, of Connecti
cut, the Republican leader, predicted
that the House never would accept
the debenture plan.
