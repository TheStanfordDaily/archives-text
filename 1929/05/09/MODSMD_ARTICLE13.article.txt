# Heflin Denounces Order Forbidding Sinclair Stories
## Suppression of Oil Magnate Prison Publicity Flayed By Alabama Solon 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 8. (tf>) â€” The
order forbidding jail officials to give
any information concerning Harry F.
Sinclair and banning newspaper men
from the jail during hlB three months'
term was denounced in the Senate
today by Senator Heflin, Democrat,
Alabama.
With the wealthy oil man accustom
ing himself to jail routine on the sec
ond full day of his sentence, the Ala
bama Senator declared it was "time
for those in authority to stop truckling
to millionaire criminals."
The only information forthcoming at
the jail was that Sinclair's work in
the drug room had not been inter
rupted by any unusual occurrence.
Having qualified as a pharmacist as a
young man, Sinclair will carry on that
work while executing his terra behind
the bars for contempt of the Senate.
Senator Heflin told the Senate that
Sinclair was not entitled to any spe
cial privileges and described him as
"this thief who stole from the govern
ment."
"The press will not be permitted to
go to his cell and write about him,"
Heflin declared, "but a poor boy would
not have such protection or such a
shield thrown about him as has been
thrown about this millionaire pris
oner.
"Oh, when will the day come when
our authorities will stop this defer
ence to millionaire criminals? Let
them wear stripes like any other pris
oner.
" 'Don't you approach the cell of
Sinclair,' these reporters are told. You
will disturb him; he's taking a nap.'"
