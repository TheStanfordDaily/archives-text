# MAY CHAPARRAL TO HIT CAMPUS TODAY DESPITE PRESSROOM
## 
### 
"The Local Interest number of
the Chaparral has attracted so
much interest in the pressroom
that the Press took time out to
read it, and caused a delay," com
plained the Foolish One yester
day. "However," continued the
Old Dodderer as he brightened
up, "by the dint of loud cheering
and much overwork, the Chapar
ral will go on sale on the Quad
today, just as scheduled."

Deciding that the faculty
should send in their ideas, Har
old Helvenston has drawn the
cover of the May Chappie. The
cover is strikingly different from
any cover that has heretofore
appeared and shows the genius
of scenic technique. Another fea-

ture is a long poem by Bob
Paino relating the enticement of
Wilbur-ha-ha from the Oiggle
water "to the land of tho Poto
mac, to tho land of IToover
watha."
