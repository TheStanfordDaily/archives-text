# STANFORD OBSERVES FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY OF MOTION PICTURES
## Louis B. Mayer Declares His Willingness to Support Movie Courses in University 
### 
"I would be glad to support, in a ma
terial way, any move this University
would make toward establishing courses
in the motion picture industry on the
campus," said Louis B. Mayer, vice-pres
ident of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cor
poration, in his address to a University
assembly yesterday morning. "For one
of the important phases of the industry
has been largely overlooked—that is, the
education of young people for the busi
ness.
"Important, also, is its work in foster
ing understanding between the nations,
which was notably accomplished by "The
Big Parade," which was the first true
picture of conditions on the front.
"The addition of sound to the motion
picture," continued Mayer, "has been of
course a great improvement, as will be
seen in the difference between the talk
ing and th silent productions of the same
play, "Madame X." But there are sub
jects which will never lend themselves to
the sound film, and I do not believe that
the introduction of the talkie will mean
the end of the silent picture."
Professor Walter R. Miles, who has
been conducting research on the history
of the Stanford-Muybridge experiments
in action pictures, spoke on this subject,
showing the motion picture industry in its
beginnings on the Stanford stock farm
in 1872, and discussing the principles in
volved in action photography.

Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, director of the
Food Research Institute, concluded the
assembly program with a short talk on
"The Value and Cost of Research." Al
most invariably, he pointed out, research
is a sequence of three steps: first, the
curiosity which is a higher form of the
sport or play impulse; second, the devel
opment of principles on the one hand and
technical perfection on the other; and
lastly, the commercialization of the result
of the research.
