# DELTA CHI, PHI SIG'S TO DECIDE HORSESHOE CHAMPIONSHIP TODAY
## 
### 
Barnyard golfers of Delta Chi and
Phi Sigma Kappa will meet at 4
o'clock this afternoon to decide the
winner of the 1929 intramural horse
shoe tournament. At 5 o'clock El Toro
and Independents will fight it out for
third place.

Although the championship match
should be very close, the Delta Chi
players will be entering the contest
as favorites. Robinson, Biaglnni, Hall,
and Fletcher of the Delta Chi team
are all steady players, Robinson usual
ly accounting for 4 or 5 ringers a
game. Cundall of Phi Sigma Kappa
is the outstanding player of that team
and should account for a good share
of its points.

El Toro is favored to win over Inde
pendents for third place. Brown and
Demotte of the eating club team are
two of the strongest players in the
tournament, the former holding the
record for ringers with 17 during four
matches. The Phi Sigma Kappa-El
Toro match which was played last
Tuesday was the closest of the entire
tournament, the fraternity team win
ning by the close margin of 11 points.
