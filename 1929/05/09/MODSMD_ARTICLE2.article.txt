# Bill Raising Speed Limit On State Highway Passed
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, May 8 (JP).â€”The
speed limit on state highways was raised
ten miles an hour in a bill pasesd by the
assembly last night. It was introduced by
Assemblyman Morgan Keaton of Long
Reach and would permit vehicles to travel
fifty miles an hour along open straight
stretches. The bill goes to the senate.

Kealon's original measure deleted the
forty miles an hour limit without substi
tuting any limit but sensing objections to
such a measure Keaton put in amend
ments at the last minute.
