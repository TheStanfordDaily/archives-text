# Banquet Concludes Stanford Movie Day Festivities; De Mille, Wilbur On Program
## 
### 
"The motion pictures need the uni
versity's help even more than the in
dustry can help the university," nays
William deMllle, acting head of the
Motion Picture Academy of Arts and
Sciences, at banquet in Branner
hall of two hundred delegates to
Movie Day celebration last night.
President Wilbur, Dr. Swain, and
deMllle were the chief speakers, and
Mayo B. Newhall, president of the
Board of Trustees, presided. The fea
ture of the evening was a talk by Dr.
Wilbur recorded in Washington, D.C.,
especially for this occasion and pro
jected in the banquet room from a
portable movietone machine. This is
the first time it has ever been accom
plished without extensive permanent
apparatus.
DeMille spoke of how the movies
were caught totally unawares six
months ago by the development of
talking pictures. As a result, the first
pictures were quite poor, but in'half
a year have improved beyond all ex
pectation. They were like Columbus
ships, at first. But like his ships, there
had to be a start somewhere, or there
would not have been any Leviathan.
The Academy was organized before
talkies were developed, but its need
is more patent now than before.
Movies Civilizing
"Both the university and drama
have always had one thing in com
mon —their fight against ignorance.
The movies are a civilizing influence
and wipe out international misunder
standing, killing race prejudice by
showing actors not as Japanese or
Hindus, but as mothers, lovers, and
plotters."
"Since the talkies have come in, the
Academy is even closer to the Uni
versity," said deMille. "The Academy
was formed because of the need of
some body to formulate Ideas and
ideals of the industry and establish
its academic standing. We long ago
realized the educational force of the
moving picture. It is the most demo
cratic of entertainment, as the public
dictates our policy; if they do not like
a picture, no power on earth can tell
them to approve it. The talkies will
be a great force in education; they
will set a standard of proper pronun
ciation, for instance. The university
can teach appreciation of drama and
are in talkies."

Dr. Swain cited universities as the
back of all great industrial move
ments for decades past. "Governor
Stanford would note in particular the
displacement of middle-aged men by
youths in progressive industry and ac
complishment; he would note with in
terest, remembering his political
work, the use of radio, with which
millions of families can be reached
and appealed to; modern transporta
tion, particularly the airplane, would
also interest him." Dr. Swain then
thanked the Fox Movietone for re
cording, and the Bell Telephone for
projecting, President Wilbur's speech.

At the luncheon at the president's
residence yesterday, Dr. Walter R.
Miles was the principle speaker.

"For us today to photograph a strip
of motion pictures is about as easy
as to scratch a match. For those of
yesterday to make a photograph of
any kind was worth a day's work."
"Man has not the developed ner
vous mechanism for apprehending
space. It is natural that we give first
time that he has for apprehending
and foremost attention to the space
relations and only later turn to the
time relations."
"One important possibility opened
up by the electric shutters was that
of setting off several cameras at the
same instant. For this work Muybridge
usually employed five cameras. The
central one of his battery from which
a thread came to the opposite side of
the track and four others set in a
deep semi-circle so that each would
get a wholly different view of the
animal that set off this quinquepartite
photographic trap."
"I fear it has taken a very long time
to describe a very short event. The
extent of analysis that is possible
with the Stanford-Muybridge pictures
is almost limitless, fifty years has
not exhausted them."
"The name of Leland Stanford as
the first to conceive and to bring to
pass in an important way the record
ing of action through photography and
the name of Eadweard Muybridge as
his technical associate are significant
ly and permanently engraved in the
historical record of motion picture
progress."
Dr. Miles announced that Psycho
logy 54, a four-hour course in "Intro
duction to Photoplay and Art Forms"
will be given fall quarter by Profes
sor Paul R. Farnsworth.
Two memorial tablets were unveiled
in the afternoon, commemorating the
place where the motion picture de
velopment was made. Joseph D. Grant,
of the Board of Trustees, Alec B.
Frances, veteran actor, Comptroller
Roth, and Mrs. William deMllle spoke
at the unveiling ceremonies.

Dr. Miles announced that Psycho
logy 54, a four-hour course in "Intro
duction to Photoplay and Art Forms"
will be given fall quarter by Profes
sor Paul R. Farnsworth.
Two memorial tablets were unveiled
in the afternoon, commemorating the
place where the motion picture de
velopment was made. Joseph D. Grant,
of the Board of Trustees, Alec B.
Frances, veteran actor, Comptroller
Roth, and Mrs. William deMllle spoke
at the unveiling ceremonies.
"The motion pictures need the uni
versity's help even more than the in
dustry can help the university," nays
William deMllle, acting head of the
Motion Picture Academy of Arts and
Sciences, at banquet in Branner
hall of two hundred delegates to
Movie Day celebration last night.
President Wilbur, Dr. Swain, and
deMllle were the chief speakers, and
Mayo B. Newhall, president of the
Board of Trustees, presided. The fea
ture of the evening was a talk by Dr.
Wilbur recorded in Washington, D.C.,
especially for this occasion and pro
jected in the banquet room from a
portable movietone machine. This is
the first time it has ever been accom
plished without extensive permanent
apparatus.
DeMille spoke of how the movies
were caught totally unawares six
months ago by the development of
talking pictures. As a result, the first
pictures were quite poor, but in'half
a year have improved beyond all ex
pectation. They were like Columbus
ships, at first. But like his ships, there
had to be a start somewhere, or there
would not have been any Leviathan.
The Academy was organized before
talkies were developed, but its need
is more patent now than before.
Movies Civilizing
"Both the university and drama
have always had one thing in com
mon —their fight against ignorance.
The movies are a civilizing influence
and wipe out international misunder
standing, killing race prejudice by
showing actors not as Japanese or
Hindus, but as mothers, lovers, and
plotters."
"Since the talkies have come in, the
Academy is even closer to the Uni
versity," said deMille. "The Academy
was formed because of the need of
some body to formulate Ideas and
ideals of the industry and establish
its academic standing. We long ago
realized the educational force of the
moving picture. It is the most demo
cratic of entertainment, as the public
dictates our policy; if they do not like
a picture, no power on earth can tell
them to approve it. The talkies will
be a great force in education; they
will set a standard of proper pronun
ciation, for instance. The university
can teach appreciation of drama and
are in talkies."

Dr. Swain cited universities as the
back of all great industrial move
ments for decades past. "Governor
Stanford would note in particular the
displacement of middle-aged men by
youths in progressive industry and ac
complishment; he would note with in
terest, remembering his political
work, the use of radio, with which
millions of families can be reached
and appealed to; modern transporta
tion, particularly the airplane, would
also interest him." Dr. Swain then
thanked the Fox Movietone for re
cording, and the Bell Telephone for
projecting, President Wilbur's speech.

At the luncheon at the president's
residence yesterday, Dr. Walter R.
Miles was the principle speaker.

"For us today to photograph a strip
of motion pictures is about as easy
as to scratch a match. For those of
yesterday to make a photograph of
any kind was worth a day's work."
"Man has not the developed ner
vous mechanism for apprehending
space. It is natural that we give first
time that he has for apprehending
and foremost attention to the space
relations and only later turn to the
time relations."

be a great force in education; they
will set a standard of proper pronun
ciation, for instance. The university
can teach appreciation of drama and
are in talkies."

Dr. Swain cited universities as the
back of all great industrial move
ments for decades past. "Governor
Stanford would note in particular the
displacement of middle-aged men by
youths in progressive industry and ac
complishment; he would note with in
terest, remembering his political
work, the use of radio, with which
millions of families can be reached
and appealed to; modern transporta
tion, particularly the airplane, would
also interest him." Dr. Swain then
thanked the Fox Movietone for re
cording, and the Bell Telephone for
projecting, President Wilbur's speech.

At the luncheon at the president's
residence yesterday, Dr. Walter R.
Miles was the principle speaker.

"For us today to photograph a strip
of motion pictures is about as easy
as to scratch a match. For those of
yesterday to make a photograph of
any kind was worth a day's work."
"Man has not the developed ner
vous mechanism for apprehending
space. It is natural that we give first
time that he has for apprehending
and foremost attention to the space
relations and only later turn to the
time relations."
"One important possibility opened
up by the electric shutters was that
of setting off several cameras at the
same instant. For this work Muybridge
usually employed five cameras. The
central one of his battery from which
a thread came to the opposite side of
the track and four others set in a
deep semi-circle so that each would
get a wholly different view of the
animal that set off this quinquepartite
photographic trap."
"I fear it has taken a very long time
to describe a very short event. The
extent of analysis that is possible
with the Stanford-Muybridge pictures
is almost limitless, fifty years has
not exhausted them."
"The name of Leland Stanford as
the first to conceive and to bring to
pass in an important way the record
ing of action through photography and
the name of Eadweard Muybridge as
his technical associate are significant
ly and permanently engraved in the
historical record of motion picture
progress."
Dr. Miles announced that Psycho
logy 54, a four-hour course in "Intro
duction to Photoplay and Art Forms"
will be given fall quarter by Profes
sor Paul R. Farnsworth.
Two memorial tablets were unveiled
in the afternoon, commemorating the
place where the motion picture de
velopment was made. Joseph D. Grant,
of the Board of Trustees, Alec B.
Frances, veteran actor, Comptroller
Roth, and Mrs. William deMllle spoke
at the unveiling ceremonies.
"The motion pictures need the uni
versity's help even more than the in
dustry can help the university," nays
William deMllle, acting head of the
Motion Picture Academy of Arts and
Sciences, at banquet in Branner
hall of two hundred delegates to
Movie Day celebration last night.
President Wilbur, Dr. Swain, and
deMllle were the chief speakers, and
Mayo B. Newhall, president of the
Board of Trustees, presided. The fea
ture of the evening was a talk by Dr.
Wilbur recorded in Washington, D.C.,
especially for this occasion and pro
jected in the banquet room from a
portable movietone machine. This is
the first time it has ever been accom
plished without extensive permanent
apparatus.
DeMille spoke of how the movies
were caught totally unawares six
months ago by the development of
talking pictures. As a result, the first
pictures were quite poor, but in'half
a year have improved beyond all ex
pectation. They were like Columbus
ships, at first. But like his ships, there
had to be a start somewhere, or there
would not have been any Leviathan.
The Academy was organized before
talkies were developed, but its need
is more patent now than before.
Movies Civilizing
"Both the university and drama
have always had one thing in com
mon —their fight against ignorance.
The movies are a civilizing influence
and wipe out international misunder
standing, killing race prejudice by
showing actors not as Japanese or
Hindus, but as mothers, lovers, and
plotters."
"Since the talkies have come in, the
Academy is even closer to the Uni
versity," said deMille. "The Academy
was formed because of the need of
some body to formulate Ideas and
ideals of the industry and establish
its academic standing. We long ago
realized the educational force of the
moving picture. It is the most demo
cratic of entertainment, as the public
dictates our policy; if they do not like
a picture, no power on earth can tell
them to approve it. The talkies will
be a great force in education; they
will set a standard of proper pronun
ciation, for instance. The university
