The Daily joins with the Palo Alto Times in commending citizens
of Palo Alto in their efforts to help the University raise the last remaining
dollars of the First Million for Stanford. There has been, it is believed,
a feeling of good will between the University and the town since the two
began to grow together. This is recent manifestation of the fact.
Speaking of the matter, the Times says:
This raising of the last few dollars for the "First Million" was
an exhibition of friendship for Stanford unalloyed by any possible
self-interest. So far as the money itself was concerned, it made
little difference whether it was secured or not. The General Edu
cation Board had generously matched the money Stanford raised
as that money was received, without waiting for the whole $700,-
000 to l>e taken in. The comparatively small sum still lacking
would make little difference in the salaries at Stanford and no pos
sible difference could be detected in Palo Alto business. But the
blow to Stanford prestige if it failed to raise the whole amount
needed to meet the offer of the General Education Board would be
serious. It was merely a matter of Stanford's" good name and
reputation that called out the determined work of these Palo Alto
allies. They do not even receive credit for their work, for they
devoted themselves as "members of the family" to induce others
who could to contribute the needed money.
