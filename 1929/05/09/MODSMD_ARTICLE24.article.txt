# The 						Motion Picture Possibility
## 
### 
Louis B. Mayer, vice-president of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Cor
poration, offered backing to the University in his address yesterday toward
the establishment of a course or courses in the motion picture.
Mr. Mayer's is a generous offer and a noteworthy one for it is merely
a matter of time when the motion picture will be studied in the universities
cf the country in all its ramifications. It is a large industry that contains
in its many phases of art, much of technical science, and innumerable allied
crafts and trades aside from its purely business aspect.
With its recent step, the achievement of talking pictures, the motion
picture has, as Mr. Mayer put it, grown out of its infancy. The talking
picture, having made the production of motion pictures so much more
complex, will demand the highest type of trained men and women to
create it. It is to the university that all industries look for these people.
The university should then give not only the broad background that it
does, but also, to keep abreast of things, special work in this field.
Stanford, as the scene of the first developments in the motion picture,
should not lag in establishing courses in the field. The prominence of the
motion picture industry on the Pacific Coast and the prei>onderance of
Stanford students who live and make their homes on the coast gives the
industry a more immediate interest than it would have elsewhere. It is
hoped the University will consider Mr. Mayer's kind offer and take some
action toward establishing courses at Stanford in this fast growing in
dustry.
