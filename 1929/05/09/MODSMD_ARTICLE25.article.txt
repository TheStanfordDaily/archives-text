## 
### 
GENEVA, May 8. (/P) â€”China is rap
idly modernizing, its central govern
ment is getting stronger, and the
power of consular war lords in the
provinces is gradually being sapped,
in the opinion of Joseph Avenol, dep
uty secretary general of the League
of Nations.
M. Avenol returned today from an
extensive tour in the Far East. He
told the press that what was most
needed was to bring China into con
tact with the redt of the world. The
isolation was bad for the world in
general and she should be helped
financially.
