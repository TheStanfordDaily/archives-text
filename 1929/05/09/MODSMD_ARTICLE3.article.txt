# Carter Elected To Editorship Of 1929-30 Chappie
## 1929 Masque King Succeeds Shoup; Halderman New Women's Manager 
### 
Election of Nelson Carter, '30, to edi
torship of the 1929-30 Chaparral was
made Tuesday at a meeting of Hammer
and Coffin Society, publishers of the mag
azine. The editor-elect succeeds Jack
Shoup as "Old Boy" of Chaparral, and
will collaborate with him in editing the
final June number.
In nominating his successor, Shoup
paid tribute, in a speech to Hammer and
Coffin members, to the three managing
editors of Chaparral who have served
with him this yearâ€”Carter, Robert Paine,
and Alfred Esberg. Shoup characterized
them as the three best candidates for the
editorship to have come up at one time in
the history of the magazine. The three
contenders on two occasions shared the
editorial responsibility during the past
year when illness kept the editor from
his duties.
Carter is a member of Alpha Delta Phi.
He was king o fthe recent Masque Ball.
Helen Halderman was elected women's
manager at Tuesday's meeting. She suc
ceeds Florence Cooper. Miss Halderman
is a member of Pi Beta Phi.
The activities of Hammer and Coffin
during the past year were summed up by
Shoup in the course of his remarks to
the society. The chief undertaking has
been the organization of the New The
atre for Stanford Fund, which now
stands in excess of $4,000. Second in im
portance has been the proposal to extend
Hammer and Coffin society to include the
Michigan Gargoyle, the Columbia Jester,
and the Pennsylvania Punch Bowl. The
petitions of these three comics to enter
Hammer and Coffin society have given
impetus to a plan to extend Hammer and
Coffin to a prominent position among the
honorary societies of the country by com
bining the better eastern publications
with the present western members.
Chaparral will be host next November
to the Western Association of College
Comics, of which Carter, as editor-elect,
automatically becomes president. Next
year's plans include also the issuance of
a joint number with the Columbia Jester,
a project which was successfully under
taken four years ago under the editorship
of Northcutt Ely. Shoup made arrange
ments for the joint number at a meeting
of the Laughing Lion society of Colum
bia which he attended in March.
Richard Holt, manager of Chaparral,
announced yesterday that the business
and circulation managers for 1929-30 will
be chosen May 22.
