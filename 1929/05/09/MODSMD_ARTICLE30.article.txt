## WOULD ABOLISH COMPULSORY COMMONS PATRONAGE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
If you can bring about the abolition of
the compulsory eating regulation con
cerning Encina frosh by your present dis
cussion of the question there is hardly a
doubt but what you will yank the Uni
versity one step higher toward the heaven
of freedom.
Whether eating at Encina Commons
costs more or less than other campus
places is of small matter. The main point
involved is that of compulsion. If you
allow the legality and logic of the present
restriction in regards to eating imposed
on the Encina frosh, they, in turn, should
bow to the high moguls of the regime and
thank them that the board is not double
what it is now, a matter, conditions as
above being allowed, of simple change.
Last spring I had the opportunity to
interview the lady who was then Made
moiselle the Queen in so far as the chow
business of the University was concerned.
I attempted to reason with her that if one
can eat in Palo Alto for an average of
$1.25 per day of three meals, Encina
Commons should be able to serve meals
not for $1.10 per day (which I think was
the rate then charged) but for 90 cents
or better. The reply to this innocent
proposition was an avalanche of feminine
ejaculations, to wit that if I or the rest
of the nonsensical outfit then domiciled
in Encina wished to shank it down to the
town and cat in places (a rather inclusive
statement) where the food was not clean
ly prepared and undoubtedly cooked in a
manner inferior to the excellent cuisine
those in charge state Encina Commons
serves, I didn't know what was good for
my stomach. I was further informed
that the Encina Commons had nice white
sinks, and pantries, and cooks with deli
cately manicured hands, and that all the
material which has a possibility of leap
ing into my breadbasket was fondled in
a manner that prohibited any bacteria or
kindred rascals from attaching them
selves to it. To argue that Encina Com
mons has the advantage of large buying
power, low interest charges and rent and
no cause for profit was to no avail. I can
assume therefore, that, were the food

served in Encina Commons given in a
Palo Alto chowery, the cost thereof, due
to added expense, would be about $2.05
per day. If the Southern Pacific will
generously allow us cut rates we shall
soon find it cheaper to wander to Frisco
and digest there.

An editorial in yesterday's Daily naive
ly asked "Is Management to Blame?"
Let us use an elimination process: (1)
The fixed charges of the Commons are
admitted to be low, and beneath most
other eating places on the campus. (2)
The food is no better, if as good, as the
general average of University eating
places, and is outrageously monotonous in
rhxrzrior nrnn f r\ f tJnnc*» c tatpm#«nt c tr\

be derived from the opinions of the men
who have eaten during the last year in
Encina and those unfortunately still
forced to abide there. (3) The labor
force employed to cook and serve the

food, if of so great an excess of what is
necessary, is so primarily because of bad
management. (4) After putting the pos
sibility of superior food or the presence
of high fixed charges out of the number
of possibilities*which might legitimize a
higher cost of eating, the darktown
shuffle in the woodpile seems to be a
specter of bad management.

Simply because the frosh class is the
greatest collection of dolts and ignora
muses in so far as knowing the ropes of
the University goes is no reason for im
posing upon this class, year after year,
the requirement of compulsory eating in
Encina Commons. Counting meals that
the average frosh over a quarter misses,
he is paying close to if not above $1.50
per day for food. Which is quite a com
pliment to the cooks of the Commons and
the young mademoiselles who direct the
destinies of the deliciously pure and deli
cately served morsels from the Univer
sity controlled icebox.

There is a possible justification for the
present prices in Encina Commons if,
and only if, the students would continue
to eat there and pay the present prices
for grub if they were not required to eat
there. I hope no one tries to shell this
argument with the one that inasmuch as
several students not required to do eat
at the Commons therefore the whole
business is OKMNX. If some boobs have
no digestive reasoning and artistic taste
in so far as Chicken a la Maryland and
Boston Baked Beans are concerned it is
no cause that everyone should suffer
for it.
With a wink of an eye we must recall
that the University is an institution which
is supposed to know more about Aristotle
than about automats and Kaffee Hag.
Giving it the benefit of the doubt in the
first instance, our stomachs refuse to
afford similar carta blanca in the second
case. I state without so much as a doubt
ful wiggle of the ears that a Chinaman
who hashes in an eating joint for a week
knows at the end of the seven days more
about restaurants than the dainty protein
misses of Stanford will know in twelve
years and three and a quarter months.
If the University abolishes compulsory
eating at Encina the Commons will find
itself forced to reduce its prices and
splash its menu with some ideas of diver
sification of eatables. Things will then
adjust themselves. The women in charge
of the hash house may be thus cruelly
shown that they are not all Alice Foote
MacDougals but then on the other hand
there won't be so much indigestion and
letters home for money.

There is a possible justification for the
present prices in Encina Commons if,
and only if, the students would continue
to eat there and pay the present prices
for grub if they were not required to eat
there. I hope no one tries to shell this
argument with the one that inasmuch as
several students not required to do eat
at the Commons therefore the whole
business is OKMNX. If some boobs have
no digestive reasoning and artistic taste
in so far as Chicken a la Maryland and
Boston Baked Beans are concerned it is
no cause that everyone should suffer
for it.
With a wink of an eye we must recall
that the University is an institution which
is supposed to know more about Aristotle

case. I state without so much as a doubt
ful wiggle of the ears that a Chinaman
who hashes in an eating joint for a week
knows at the end of the seven days more
about restaurants than the dainty protein
misses of Stanford will know in twelve
years and three and a quarter months.
If the University abolishes compulsory
eating at Encina the Commons will find
itself forced to reduce its prices and

The Editor, Sir:
If you can bring about the abolition of
the compulsory eating regulation con
cerning Encina frosh by your present dis
cussion of the question there is hardly a
doubt but what you will yank the Uni
versity one step higher toward the heaven
of freedom.
Whether eating at Encina Commons
costs more or less than other campus
places is of small matter. The main point
involved is that of compulsion. If you
allow the legality and logic of the present
restriction in regards to eating imposed
on the Encina frosh, they, in turn, should
bow to the high moguls of the regime and
thank them that the board is not double
what it is now, a matter, conditions as
above being allowed, of simple change.
Last spring I had the opportunity to
interview the lady who was then Made
moiselle the Queen in so far as the chow
business of the University was concerned.
I attempted to reason with her that if one
can eat in Palo Alto for an average of
$1.25 per day of three meals, Encina
Commons should be able to serve meals
not for $1.10 per day (which I think was
the rate then charged) but for 90 cents
or better. The reply to this innocent
proposition was an avalanche of feminine
ejaculations, to wit that if I or the rest
of the nonsensical outfit then domiciled
in Encina wished to shank it down to the
town and cat in places (a rather inclusive
statement) where the food was not clean
ly prepared and undoubtedly cooked in a
manner inferior to the excellent cuisine
those in charge state Encina Commons
serves, I didn't know what was good for
my stomach. I was further informed
that the Encina Commons had nice white
sinks, and pantries, and cooks with deli
cately manicured hands, and that all the
material which has a possibility of leap
ing into my breadbasket was fondled in
a manner that prohibited any bacteria or
kindred rascals from attaching them
selves to it. To argue that Encina Com
mons has the advantage of large buying
power, low interest charges and rent and
no cause for profit was to no avail. I can
assume therefore, that, were the food

served in Encina Commons given in a
Palo Alto chowery, the cost thereof, due
to added expense, would be about $2.05
per day. If the Southern Pacific will
generously allow us cut rates we shall
soon find it cheaper to wander to Frisco
and digest there.

An editorial in yesterday's Daily naive
ly asked "Is Management to Blame?"
Let us use an elimination process: (1)
The fixed charges of the Commons are
admitted to be low, and beneath most
other eating places on the campus. (2)
The food is no better, if as good, as the
general average of University eating
places, and is outrageously monotonous in
rhxrzrior nrnn f r\ f tJnnc*» c tatpm#«nt c tr\

be derived from the opinions of the men
who have eaten during the last year in
Encina and those unfortunately still
forced to abide there. (3) The labor
force employed to cook and serve the

food, if of so great an excess of what is
necessary, is so primarily because of bad
management. (4) After putting the pos
sibility of superior food or the presence
of high fixed charges out of the number
of possibilities*which might legitimize a
higher cost of eating, the darktown
shuffle in the woodpile seems to be a
specter of bad management.

greatest collection of dolts and ignora
muses in so far as knowing the ropes of
the University goes is no reason for im
posing upon this class, year after year,
the requirement of compulsory eating in
Encina Commons. Counting meals that
the average frosh over a quarter misses,
he is paying close to if not above $1.50
per day for food. Which is quite a com

the young mademoiselles who direct the

An editorial in yesterday's Daily naive
ly asked "Is Management to Blame?"
Let us use an elimination process: (1)
The fixed charges of the Commons are
admitted to be low, and beneath most
other eating places on the campus. (2)
The food is no better, if as good, as the
general average of University eating
places, and is outrageously monotonous in
rhxrzrior nrnn f r\ f tJnnc*» c tatpm#«nt c tr\

be derived from the opinions of the men
who have eaten during the last year in
Encina and those unfortunately still
forced to abide there. (3) The labor
force employed to cook and serve the

food, if of so great an excess of what is
necessary, is so primarily because of bad
management. (4) After putting the pos
sibility of superior food or the presence
of high fixed charges out of the number
of possibilities*which might legitimize a
higher cost of eating, the darktown
shuffle in the woodpile seems to be a
specter of bad management.

Simply because the frosh class is the
greatest collection of dolts and ignora
muses in so far as knowing the ropes of
the University goes is no reason for im
posing upon this class, year after year,
the requirement of compulsory eating in
Encina Commons. Counting meals that
the average frosh over a quarter misses,
he is paying close to if not above $1.50
per day for food. Which is quite a com
pliment to the cooks of the Commons and
the young mademoiselles who direct the
destinies of the deliciously pure and deli
cately served morsels from the Univer
sity controlled icebox.

There is a possible justification for the
present prices in Encina Commons if,
and only if, the students would continue
to eat there and pay the present prices
for grub if they were not required to eat
there. I hope no one tries to shell this
argument with the one that inasmuch as
several students not required to do eat
at the Commons therefore the whole
business is OKMNX. If some boobs have
no digestive reasoning and artistic taste
in so far as Chicken a la Maryland and
Boston Baked Beans are concerned it is
no cause that everyone should suffer
for it.
With a wink of an eye we must recall
that the University is an institution which
is supposed to know more about Aristotle
than about automats and Kaffee Hag.
Giving it the benefit of the doubt in the
first instance, our stomachs refuse to
afford similar carta blanca in the second
case. I state without so much as a doubt
ful wiggle of the ears that a Chinaman
who hashes in an eating joint for a week
knows at the end of the seven days more
about restaurants than the dainty protein
misses of Stanford will know in twelve
years and three and a quarter months.
If the University abolishes compulsory
eating at Encina the Commons will find
itself forced to reduce its prices and
splash its menu with some ideas of diver
sification of eatables. Things will then
adjust themselves. The women in charge
of the hash house may be thus cruelly
shown that they are not all Alice Foote
MacDougals but then on the other hand
there won't be so much indigestion and
letters home for money.

The Editor, Sir:
If you can bring about the abolition of
the compulsory eating regulation con
cerning Encina frosh by your present dis
cussion of the question there is hardly a
doubt but what you will yank the Uni
versity one step higher toward the heaven
of freedom.
Whether eating at Encina Commons
costs more or less than other campus
places is of small matter. The main point
involved is that of compulsion. If you
allow the legality and logic of the present
restriction in regards to eating imposed
on the Encina frosh, they, in turn, should
bow to the high moguls of the regime and
thank them that the board is not double
what it is now, a matter, conditions as
above being allowed, of simple change.
Last spring I had the opportunity to
interview the lady who was then Made
moiselle the Queen in so far as the chow
business of the University was concerned.
I attempted to reason with her that if one
can eat in Palo Alto for an average of
$1.25 per day of three meals, Encina
Commons should be able to serve meals
not for $1.10 per day (which I think was
the rate then charged) but for 90 cents
or better. The reply to this innocent
proposition was an avalanche of feminine
ejaculations, to wit that if I or the rest
of the nonsensical outfit then domiciled
in Encina wished to shank it down to the
town and cat in places (a rather inclusive
statement) where the food was not clean
ly prepared and undoubtedly cooked in a
manner inferior to the excellent cuisine
those in charge state Encina Commons
serves, I didn't know what was good for
my stomach. I was further informed
that the Encina Commons had nice white
sinks, and pantries, and cooks with deli
cately manicured hands, and that all the
material which has a possibility of leap
ing into my breadbasket was fondled in
a manner that prohibited any bacteria or
kindred rascals from attaching them
selves to it. To argue that Encina Com
mons has the advantage of large buying
power, low interest charges and rent and
no cause for profit was to no avail. I can
assume therefore, that, were the food

served in Encina Commons given in a
Palo Alto chowery, the cost thereof, due
to added expense, would be about $2.05
per day. If the Southern Pacific will
generously allow us cut rates we shall
soon find it cheaper to wander to Frisco
