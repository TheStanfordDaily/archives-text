# WOULD PROTECT CAMPUS BIRDS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
While we are showing off our Campus
to visitors this week, let us take pains to
keep them out of the Memorial Court
and the Inner Quad lest their feelings be
sensitive enough to be unpleasantly jarred
by stepping on birds' eggs when they arc
supposed to be admiring our new tablets
to the honor of ourselves and our prog
ress.
Not the tablets, nor the hawthorne
trees, nor the May skies can quite obliter
ate the impression of ugly and ruthless
cruelty that is made by the sight of the
destroyed swallows' nests every morning
early before the janitors have washed
away the marks of the night's destruc
tion and before the distracted birds have
left the courts.
It may be that, for the fastidious, a
little dirt for a few weeks in the Court
would be intolerable. If so, could not
those for whom this would be the case
discover some method to keep the birds
from building there? Certainly in a Uni
versity that prides itself on standing in
the front ranks of scientific research,

spme substance might be found and used
that would keep the birds out of the cor
ners where they are not wanted. To let
them build two and three times in the
same season and to knock their nests
down as many times is unworthy of a
civilized community.
Relatively of course the distress of a
few hundred birds crying frantically
through our courts is nothing in the sum
of misery in the world. It is a small
matter to be sure; and we can manage to
ignore it and get by. This is the third
year that we have looked on at the spec
tacle, and passed by to our all important
tasks, while the foreign servants who
sweep up the nests and scrub off the
broken eggs say behind our backs, "Such
things are not done in my country; we
never knock down birds' nests." It is
indeed a small matter as matters go in
this world, but small as it is, it is ugly
and offensive and cruel, and out of keep
ing with the spirit of Stanford, where
even the swallows might expect a square
deal.
