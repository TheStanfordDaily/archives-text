# INVESTIGATION UNNECESSARY TO SHOW FAULTS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I feel that the investigators of the eat- [
ing conditions in the Encina Commons
are going far out of their way in inves- |
tigating the books and the auditing sys- i
terns of the various campus organizations.
One needs merely to go to any cafe or
restaurant in Los Angeles or San Fran- !
cisco and order any regular table d'hote |
luncheon, to see the great difference in the j
food. As far as expenses arc concerned, !
these establishments have besides our reg- j
ular overhead expenses the additional

[costs of experienced lielp and advertising.
I Surely this is quite an item to be con
sidered while we speak of comparative
■ priccs. There are rarely more than one
fourth of the people in a dining hall at
i breakfast. We have, then, $1.28 for two
meals. At 65 cents a meal, we should
I surely be given something which would
compare more favorably with the food
; which we may obtain elsewhere at the
i same cost. It is all so flagrant and ob
jvious. Why the big controversy?
