# COMMONS ROBBING THE FRESHMEN
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Despite all official statements to the
contrary, the Encina Commons manage
ment has been systematically robbing the
freshmen. We have attempted to peti
tion ; all such efforts have been useless.
Word is received that 45 per cent of
our money pays for the dining halls. If
this is true, the University is at fault.
The extraction of $1.28 per day during

i rushing season from 200 men who prac
tically lived on the Row is only typical
\of the inefficiency and mismanagement
now prevailing.
If refusal to board at Encina had been
possible, if any competitive eating estab
lishment on the Campus had been avail
able, Encina would have closed its doors
long ago.
