### Philip Space 
Can we crowd most of tlie rest of
the fraternities in today? We rather
think so, printers permitting. Hope
you won't mind being lumped together
so unceremoniously, boys.
"Casey at the Bat"
The outlook wasn't brilliant for the
Theta Chi's that day
The score was all against them,
with but two more hours to play
And so when Phi Sigs grabbed one
man, the A.K.L.'s the next
A sickly silence fell —one saw the
Theta Chi's were vexed.
A straggling few were sunk in deep
despair, the rest
Clung to the hope that springs eter
nal in the human breast
They thought if only Richman were
back in harness, he
Might lure some nuggets—lure and
save the ol' fraternity.
. . . Oh somewhere on the dear old
Row the sun is shining bright
The cup is passing somewhere, and
somewhere heads are light
And somewhere lads are larfing, and
somewhere ladies shout
Theta Chi's have made a ten-strike!
(They would better have struck
out.)
"Gunga Din"
(As it might be sung by a
"rival" house)
You may talk o' gin and beer
(Though you'd better not talk here)
But the white house on the slope it
doesn't use them.
But when it comes to slaughters
You should see the nearby daughters
And the engineers try SO hard not
to lose them.
For it's sigh, Si, Xi,
Though we've laughed at you and
You moulting engineers of Theta Xi
flayed you
By the Alpha O's that made you
You're a better clan than we are,
Theta Xi!
"Sea Fever"
I must go up to the Delts again
To the lonely Delts up on high
And all I ask is a tall stein
And red lights to steer me by
And the bros. kick, and the future's
black
And the House is grieving
After Bud and Bob and Spud and Nick
Have left or are leaving.
Barring spring fever, falling objects,
and acts of God, we will finish the
fraternities tomorrow, take a brief
fling at the rest of the clubs, and then
dip our honeyed pen into the sorority
situation. The latter isn't a promise,
and who asked for one, anyway?
