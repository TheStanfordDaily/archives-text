# Mules Replace Ponies In New French Polo Games
## 
### 
PARIS, May 8. (/P) â€”Polo is played
upon ponies and some years ago the
rollers skates brand flourished in New
England, hut it remained for the fre
quenters of aristocratic Bois de Bou
logne to introduce polo on mules.
Ermenonville is the stage set for
the new polo. It is played with four
men and four mules a side, similar to
polo on ponies.
The game while slower than that
on ponies gains in length play
what it loses in speed. The chuckers
instead of being a few minutes each
last a half hour.
