# FAVORS BETTERMENT OF ENCINA MEALS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As an Encina freshman, I am heartily
in favor of the move for the betterment
of the Encina meals. I do not feel that
it is necessary to go to the fraternities
and other eating groups on the campus
to determine the proper cost of good
meals, especially when better meals served
at our own Stanford Union cost appre
ciably less. I have been constantly re
minded of the fact that previous attempts
to express the general sentiment have
been met with a cold shoulder, but I cer
tainly do not consider this any excuse for
remaining silent.
