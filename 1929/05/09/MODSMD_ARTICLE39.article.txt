# ENCINA MEALS NOT WORTH $1,275
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Encina meals arc quite poor—certainly
not worth $1,275 a day. This figure is
even more ridiculous when it is noted that
for most boarders it covers only two
meals. Not more than one fourth of
those who buy meal books for Encina eat
breakfast there.
