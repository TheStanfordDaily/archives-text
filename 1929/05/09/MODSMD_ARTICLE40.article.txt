# ENGINEERS OF SOUTH AMERICA CONFRONTED BY MANY OBSTACLES
## Labor Situation All Wrong; Young Engineer Gains Little of Worth 
### Arthur McGarr 
"Peru and the other West Coast
countries of South America are no
place for the young engineer who is
just making a start in life after finish
ing his college career." Thus did
Frank W. Collins, miuing and mechan
ical engineer of San Francisco, sum
up the opportunities that lie ahead of
one who is planning on South America
as a future field of action. Collins was
for many years chief engineer for
Bradley, Bruff, and Latardche, consult
ing engineers, which position he re-
Higued to take up work with the Cerro
do Pasco Mining Company of Peru.
He is now chief engineer in the de
signing department, of the Joshua
Hendey Iron Works of San Francisco.
Labor Situation Wrong
"In the first place," he said, "the
experience and the ideas that the
young engineer gets from work in
those countries is all wrong. Labor
troubles, climate, altitude, loneliness,
and the great distance from home all
combine to make his job one that re
quires the patience and experience of
a much older man. The South Ameri
can Indian provides a wonderful edu
, cation in the proper way to do things
; wrong. The labor situation is all
«wrong. If the ludian has enough to last
him from one day to the next he can
not see just why he should work. With
those things confronting superintend
ents and engineers, a job gets to
mean just how quickly and how easy
this piece of work may be done. The
main Idea is to finish the work and
get home.
Altitude Affects Health
"Altitude is a thing that almost
ruins a man physically if he stays in
the high places long enough. The
Cerro de Pasco mines are the highest
in Peru, around seventeen thousand
feet, and we had to send our engi
neers down to sea level for two weeks'
vacation every six months. A man's
nffiriency is exceedingly low at such
an altitude. The climate is bad and
mal'es life pretty dreary. After a
* proip of men have been working on
a job together for several months the
too 'ion gets so great and nerves are
on t mch an edge that it is almost im
poaaible to get the proper spirit of
co-<pe ration.
Loses Outside Contact
"A. white man cannot work at any
raariual labor in South America and
expect to keep his superiority to the
uat.ve labor. This attitude is due to
the Spanish couquistadores who en
-da ed the Indian and made manual
his <r a thing for the downtrodden
ses only.
» have seen men make great suc
cesses of themselves in South Amer
ica," said Mr. Collins, but without ex
ception these men would have been
just as great, if not greater, successes
in this country. A person who works
in South America is just that much
behind the times when he comes back
to this country. He loses contact with
his friends, his profession, and the
tfiings that are going on in the world
outside. With all these things in mind
it is easily seen just how good a man
it takes to make a go of his job in
South America."

Labor Situation Wrong
"In the first place," he said, "the
experience and the ideas that the
young engineer gets from work in
those countries is all wrong. Labor
troubles, climate, altitude, loneliness,
and the great distance from home all
combine to make his job one that re
quires the patience and experience of
a much older man. The South Ameri
can Indian provides a wonderful edu
, cation in the proper way to do things
; wrong. The labor situation is all
«wrong. If the ludian has enough to last
him from one day to the next he can
not see just why he should work. With
those things confronting superintend
ents and engineers, a job gets to
mean just how quickly and how easy
this piece of work may be done. The
main Idea is to finish the work and
get home.
Altitude Affects Health
"Altitude is a thing that almost
ruins a man physically if he stays in
the high places long enough. The
Cerro de Pasco mines are the highest
in Peru, around seventeen thousand
feet, and we had to send our engi
neers down to sea level for two weeks'
vacation every six months. A man's
nffiriency is exceedingly low at such
an altitude. The climate is bad and
mal'es life pretty dreary. After a
* proip of men have been working on
a job together for several months the
too 'ion gets so great and nerves are
on t mch an edge that it is almost im
poaaible to get the proper spirit of
co-<pe ration.
Loses Outside Contact
"A. white man cannot work at any
raariual labor in South America and
expect to keep his superiority to the
uat.ve labor. This attitude is due to
the Spanish couquistadores who en
-da ed the Indian and made manual
his <r a thing for the downtrodden
ses only.
» have seen men make great suc
cesses of themselves in South Amer
ica," said Mr. Collins, but without ex
ception these men would have been
just as great, if not greater, successes
in this country. A person who works
in South America is just that much
behind the times when he comes back
to this country. He loses contact with
his friends, his profession, and the
tfiings that are going on in the world
outside. With all these things in mind
it is easily seen just how good a man
it takes to make a go of his job in
South America."
"Peru and the other West Coast
countries of South America are no
place for the young engineer who is
just making a start in life after finish
ing his college career." Thus did
Frank W. Collins, miuing and mechan
ical engineer of San Francisco, sum
up the opportunities that lie ahead of
one who is planning on South America
as a future field of action. Collins was
for many years chief engineer for
Bradley, Bruff, and Latardche, consult
ing engineers, which position he re-
Higued to take up work with the Cerro
do Pasco Mining Company of Peru.
He is now chief engineer in the de
signing department, of the Joshua
