# PLAN ANNUAL PARTY FOR QUAD EDITORIAL, MANAGERIAL STAFFS
## 
### 
The annual party for the managerial
and editorial staffs of the Quad is to
he held this year on Saturday, May
18, at Brookdale Lodge. This party,
which is held every year at the lodge,
is for those who have been doing the
business, editorial, and writing work
for the Quad during tho year.
The plans for the day include swim
ming in the afternoon and dinner and
dancing in the evening.
In former years the party has been
held later in the quarter when the ap
pointments for the next year's Quad
have been made and the book is off
the press, but it was necessary to
have it sooner this year because of
ihe short quarter and early finals.
