# Debate Societies To Argue Athletics Subject Tonight
## 
### 
Euphronia and Wranglers Societies
will meet in the Women's Clubhouse
at 7:30 tonight to debate the ques
tion: "Resolved: That Athletics Are
Over-emphasized at Stanford."

As the subject of the debate was
chosen by Euphronia, Wranglers was
allowed to choose the side which it
would support. The women's society
will uphold the affirmative, repre
sented by Violet Crosbie and Helen
Smith. Leon Carley, a varsity debater
and coach of the freshman debate
team, and Donald Galbralth, a new
member, will be the Euphronia team.
The public is invited to attend the de
bate.
