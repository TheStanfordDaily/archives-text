### 
Prof. Alfred S. Niles of the Aero
nautical Engineering Department, in
collaboration with Joseph S. Newell,
associate professor of structural en
gineering at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, has Just written a book
entitled "x\irplane Structures." The
book is a complete compilation of all
the structural theories and scientific
designs of airplanes up to the present
time, and is largely a revision of "Air
plane Design," a book published by
the Army Air Corps for use in army
aircraft work. A few of the things dis
cussed are general design procedure,
torsion, truss analysis, graphical meth
ods, weight estimations, and connec
tions.
John Wiley and Sons, Inc., are the
publishers of the book which, accord
ing to reviewers, is a real contribution
to the field of structural aeronautics.
