# TILDEN LEAVES FOR DAVIS CUP MATCHES WITH FRANK HUNTER
## Expects American Team to Down Italian, French Stars in Tennis 
### 
NEW YORK, May 8. (/P)â€”Far from
conceding world tennis supremacy to
the French for another year, Bill Til
den and Frank Hunter, sailing at mid
night to tackle the Tri-Color stars in
the big European tournaments, expect
the United States to be in there bat
tling for everything including the
Davis Cup.
Praising America's younger players,
Hunter predicted that the newly
named team of John Hennessey, John
Van Ityn, and Wilmer Allison, with
George Lott as emergency man, will
sweep through the home zone and on
to Europe without losing a single
Davis Cup match.
Tilden went his partner one better
by declaring a conviction that the
Americans will down the Italians in
the inter-zone final, "winning by four
matches to one, at least," and then
will meet the French in the challenge
round with an outside chance for us
to lift the cup."
Whether Tilden and Hunter will be
used in the all-important phases of the
Davis Cup campaign is still a ques
tion, but Big Bill said quite frankly
that they are available if desired by
the Davis Cup committee.
If America does regain some of its
lost tennis laurels this season, thinks
Tilden, it will not be because of any
loss of strength on the part of the
French team. Cochet, Lacoste, Borotra,
and company are going to be better
than ever, he is convinced.
