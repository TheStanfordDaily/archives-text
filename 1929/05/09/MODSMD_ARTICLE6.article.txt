Circus days—chase the blues away—
Circus days—
And from the first words of the open
ing chorus to the last hop, skip, and jump
of the finale, "Moving On" will shake the
boards of the Assembly Hall stage Sat
urday night as no other Junior Opera has
succeeded in doing. And to show how the
campus expects this to be the greatest
musical comedy of the Stanford theater,
already all the $1.50 seats have been sold.
However, the Dramatic Council reports
that there are several good $1.25 and
$1.00 tickets still available. As the Bar
ker in the show says : "Come ovah ! Come
ovah!"—or you'll be left scrambling for
Roughs' tickets at the last moment.

Plot ? There's plenty of that, surround
ed by the glamor of the circus lot, the
absurdity of the freaks, and deep, desper
ate criminal complications. Two rival cir
cus owners, two low-down lion tamers —
tough as an Encina apple pie—and, de
spite all these obstacles, a young country
boy falls in love with the daughter of the
circus-owner. Crimes of which he is in
nocent are heaped upon his head, until
it seems impossible to believe that he and
the girl can ever achieve happiness. But
does he? Well—what's a musical com
edy for if he doesn't?

Settings? Five of them, in all of which
Harold Helvenston has captured the fast
moving, colorful life of a circus. Large
tents and small tents, circus parapher

nalia, the gaudy circus wagon of crimson
and gilt where the lion tamers live—all
have been designed with a lavishness
which matches the spirit of the operetta.
But the high spot of the show (from
a scenic viewpoint) will be the Midway,
which has been created after the manner
of the Chauve Souris—a vivid and ex
travagant burlesque of realism. Helven
ston has also selected over two hundred
costumes to be worn by the choruses and
principals.
Music? There are ten songs, several of
which would do credit to a professional
show—none of which fall below the high
standards set by previous Junior Operas.
In fact, it would not be surprising if one
or two of them should eventually gain
nation-wide prominence. Louis B. Mayer
should stay over a couple of days and
grab off some of them for his talking
movies.
And dancing? For the last three weeks
the chorus of twenty-four has been work
ing itself ragged trying to keep up with
Frances Boone's "Circus Days" songs,
and then learning to be acrobatic for one
of the other dances. Beside the six cho
rus numbers in this operetta, the dancing
in the past Junior Operas has been simple
stuff.
Life, color, action—all of these are in
the musical comedy. The spirit of the
show is exemplified in the last words of
the theme jazz song:

j What zve're doing—that's just moving on
