MANILA, P.1., May 8 (JP).—Five
groups of scientists who have spent
months of time, thousands of dollars,
and traveled thousands of miles for the
sake of a four-minute look at the total
eclipse of the sun tomorrow were over
joyed today at the prospect of fair weath
er for their observations.

The eclipse will appear at sunrise in the
far southwestern corner of the Indian
ocean and will be visible over a curved
streak of the earth's surface almost from
the eastern coast of Africa to a point
somewhere near mid-Pacific, just south
of the equator. This streak, which will
average about 100 miles in width, will
be darkened as the moon partially blots
out the light of the sun.
