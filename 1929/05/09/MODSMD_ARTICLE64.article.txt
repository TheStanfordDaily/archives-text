# SPORTS OF 1929
## The 						Cards' New Ace 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Another college football player
to have made good in major league
baseball. He is Charley Gelbert, for
mer gridiron star of the Lebanon
Valley eleven, who, a couple of sea
sons ago was the big gun of the small
Pennsylvania college's sensational vic
tory over Brown University. Now
Charley is the shortstop of the St.
Louis Cardinals, and is using his
speed to good advantage on the dia
monds of the National League.
You might think that the left side
of the Cardinal infield would be a bit
weak with Haney or High at third,
and a rookie like Gelbert at short.
Perhaps, in comparison to the right
side, it is, for it would take a Lind
strom and a Jackson to come up to
Friseh and Bottomley; but Gelbert
seems to be holding his own, throw
ing to first like a rifle bullet, and
profiting from the fact that he has

the veteran Fordham Flash close by
to steady him.
There was considerable doubt in
the minds of the sideliners who
watched the Cards in their spring
drills that Gelbert would fill the gap
at shortstop, but now they all agree
that the ex-collegian has "come
through like a million dollars," and
that he is even a better fielder than
Tommy Thevenow. So far, his batting
has not equaled his work with Roches
ter last year, but in the field, especial
ly at going to his left, he is in a class
by himself.
Gelbert is shown as captain of the
1927 Lebanon Valley football team in
a photo in Spalding's Football Guide
for 1928, but my dope has it that he
was assigned to Syracuse in June
1926, and played baseball for Topeka
in 1927. Maybe Brown didn't know
about that when they lost that 12 to
13 game in the fall of 1927!
