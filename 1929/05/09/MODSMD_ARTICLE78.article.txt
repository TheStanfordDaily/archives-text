WASHINGTON, May 8. (JP) â€” Low
wages and "onerous" working condi
tions were blamed today by William
Green, president of the American
Federation of Labor, for the workers'
strike in the Southern textile mills
as he urged the Senate manufactures
committee to approve the resolution
authorizing a Senate investigation.
Mr. Green was the first witness
heard by the committee as it took up
the resolution of Senator Wheeler,
Democrat, Montana, proposing a Sen
ate inquiry. He contended the attitude
of the mill owners was "sowing the
seeds of communism" and described
the question as one of national con
cern.
