# King George Will Return To Windsor Castle Soon
## 
### 
LONDON, May 8. (/P) â€”Announcement
was made today that King George and
Queen Mary will leave Craigweilhouse,
Bognor, for Windsor next Wednesday.

King George was removed to Bognor
on Feb. 9 of this year in order that he
might benefit from the sea air in his
convalescence from his recent serious
illness. For some weeks past the im
provement in His Majesty's health
was such that it was hoped he could
return to Windsor shortly. He had ex
pressed a desire to assume his duties
in connection with the forthcoming
general elections.
