Would Vote
To Re-elect
This Smoke
So. Richmond, Va.

Richmond, Va.
Gentlemen:
As a constant user of EDGE
WORTH Tobacco for the past four
years, I can sty I have enjoyed the
comforts and pleasure of the World's
Finest Tobacco. If EDGEWORTH
were running for re-election, here is
one sure vote for it. Its uniform
quality is the outstanding feature and
I recommend it highly. The EDGE
WORTH Club hour over WIiVA
is highly pleasing and helps to form
a good combination.
Fraternally yours,
(Signed) Franklin Montgomery
