# GOVERNMENT OF BRITAIN FROWNS ON REPARATIONS
## Winston Churchill Declares Foreshadowed Proposals Inacceptable to Cabinet Exchequer Chancellor Hints That Delegates Have Not Power to Sign Agreement 
### 
LONDON, May 9. (£>)—Winston
Churchill, chancellor of the exche
quer, told the House of Commons this
afternoon that the kind of proposals
foreshadowed on German reparations
in the London press yesterday would
be inacceptable to the Baldwin cabi
net. Under n<* circumstances would
the government entertain such pro
posals, Mr. Churchill declared.
There was a certain intentional
vagueness of phrase about Mr. Church
ill's statement, but Its essence was
that British delegates to the Paris
conference had no power to commit
the British government to any agree
ment and that such proposals as "had
been foreshadowed in the newspapers
yesterday" would be inacceptable.
Mr. Churchill studiously avoided
mentioning Owen D. Young, who is
the author of the proposal in question,
and just as carefully avoided saying
whether the government under any
conditions would oppose any modifica
tions of the Spa agreement for allo
cating reparations payments among
the Allies.

PARIS, May 9. (/P) —The statement
of the British government's position
on reparations revision by Chancellor
Winston Churchill today was not ex
pected here to affect the work on
which the international experts now
are engaged. Chairman Owen D.
Young and others have already an
nounced that if agreement could be
reached on the general total of repa
rations the various governments if
necessary could revise the percent
ages among themselves later.
The text of the statement by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer to the
House of Commons arrived here to
night after the experts had concluded
their work for the day and they de
clined to comment. The general pub
lic will not learn of it until tomorrow
for it was not received in time for
publication in the afternoon news
papers.
