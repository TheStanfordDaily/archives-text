# 'MOVING ON' HAS PROFESSIONAL VERSATILITY
## Numerous Opportunities For Song Hits Offered by Complicated Plot 
### John Rogers 
Moving on—show's in town; just
time for us to say,
"Well, so long—"
That's the trouble with Junior
Operas—they come for one perform
ance and then disappear into the
limbo of one-night shows. And "Mov
ing On," to be presented under the
direction of Gordon Davis tomorrow
night at 8:20 in the Assembly Hall, is
one of the few campus musical come
dies which deserves a return engage
ment, for in many respects it displays
a professional versatility which many
metropolitan shows lack.
The authors of the operetta—Laird
Doyle, John Paul Jones, and James
Webb —have taken a hint from the
"Student Prince" and the "Desert
Song" and have written a book which,
while it has plenty of plot and serious
complications (which are not serious
enough to prevent a happy ending at
the last moment), gives opportunities
for the introduction of several songs.
And the song-writers have composed
pieces which are actually a part or
the show, and are not mere fillers, as
has been the case of so many past
Junior Operas.
Tom Watt, who plays Garry, the
hero, besides having several duets
with Helen Ward, as Sally, the daugh
ter of the circus owner, also sings two
numbers with the combined men's
choruses. In the love theme-song, the
women's trio sings one of the choruses
with Sally, and curing one of Zuzu's
(the lion tamer's wife played by Jean
ette Owens) songs, the entire women's
chorus sings with her while it dances.
Although the show centers around
the two young lovers, it has captured
the spirit of a circus with all its
hectic life, color, and movement. One
night stands in the "sticks," disgrun
tled freaks from the Midway side
shows, plotting on the part of the lion
tamers to aid a rival circus owner
ruin the show, and tough, intimate life
of the performers—all these are por
trayed under the Big Top which has
gone up in the Assembly Hall under
the supervision of tent-boss Helven
ston. And the fast lines of the script
put even the current number of
Chaparral to shame.
The largest block of Roughs' seats
—275 in number —ever offered the
campus will go on sale at the Assem
bly Hall box office at 7 o'clock tomor
row night. Other tickets at $3.25 and
$1.00 may be obtained at the A.S.S.U.
office in the Old Union until noon to
morrow. Edwin Smith, dramatic man
ager, requests that all those who or
dered tickets claim them today or they
will be sold.

Moving on—show's in town; just
time for us to say,
"Well, so long—"
That's the trouble with Junior
Operas—they come for one perform
ance and then disappear into the
limbo of one-night shows. And "Mov
ing On," to be presented under the
direction of Gordon Davis tomorrow
night at 8:20 in the Assembly Hall, is
one of the few campus musical come
dies which deserves a return engage
ment, for in many respects it displays
a professional versatility which many
metropolitan shows lack.
The authors of the operetta—Laird
Doyle, John Paul Jones, and James
Webb —have taken a hint from the
"Student Prince" and the "Desert
Song" and have written a book which,
while it has plenty of plot and serious
complications (which are not serious
enough to prevent a happy ending at
the last moment), gives opportunities
for the introduction of several songs.
And the song-writers have composed
pieces which are actually a part or
the show, and are not mere fillers, as
has been the case of so many past
Junior Operas.
Tom Watt, who plays Garry, the
hero, besides having several duets
with Helen Ward, as Sally, the daugh
ter of the circus owner, also sings two
numbers with the combined men's
choruses. In the love theme-song, the
women's trio sings one of the choruses
with Sally, and curing one of Zuzu's
(the lion tamer's wife played by Jean
ette Owens) songs, the entire women's
chorus sings with her while it dances.
Although the show centers around
the two young lovers, it has captured
the spirit of a circus with all its
hectic life, color, and movement. One
night stands in the "sticks," disgrun
tled freaks from the Midway side
shows, plotting on the part of the lion
tamers to aid a rival circus owner
ruin the show, and tough, intimate life
of the performers—all these are por
trayed under the Big Top which has
gone up in the Assembly Hall under
the supervision of tent-boss Helven
ston. And the fast lines of the script
put even the current number of
Chaparral to shame.
