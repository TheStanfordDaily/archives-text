# BERK ANTHONY NAMED 'MOST FOOLISH FROSH' BY CHAPARRAL EDITOR
## 
### 
Berk Anthony of the class of '32
was last night unanimously declared i
to be the most "foolish freshman" on
the Chaparral staff, that most coveted
distinction among would-be humorists, j
The fortunate lad was then awarded a j
silver loving cup among the great ap- j
plause of his foolish fellow-artists.
The occasion was no less than the !
annual Chaparral banquet, when the 1
Old Boy gathers around him all of his
intimates to make one last whoopee!
splurge before the outgoing of the!
current staff.
Jack Shoup, editor-in-chief of the
Chappie, entertained the staff last j
night at his Los Altos home, and, true
to form, the Old Boy's mirth ran ram- i
pant.
