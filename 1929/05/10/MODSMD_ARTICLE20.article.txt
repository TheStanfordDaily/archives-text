# B. A. C. CAN'T BACK BOTH CREW, WOMEN'S GYMNASIUM-RASTERS
## Annual $30,000 Appropriation for Ten Years Asked by A.W.S. Committee; Storey Favors Conservative Policy 
### 
AN A.W.S. committee, working on the proposed women's gymnasium, started
a rapid-fire movement for an answer from the H.A.C. as to appropriations
for the gym by an interview with A1 Masters, manager of the board, and
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, head of the physical education department.
Masters is quoted as saying that he was "personally in favor of giving
money to the women for the proposed gymnasium," but that he was "not

â€¢speaking for the Board."
Masters repeated his declaration
given to the Palo Alto Times a few
days ago: "Reinstatement of crew at
Stanford will mean that proposed
plans for the construction of the gym
will have to be abandoned because of
the financial difficulties of the 8.A.C."
Dr. Storey was not in favor of ap
propriating all the money asked for
by the women, which is $30,000 each
year for a period of ten years, bat
was in favor of giving the women
some funds for the physical education
department.
The A.W.S. New Gym Committee
planned yesterday to further the cam
paign for the gym by promoting cam
pus opinion in favor of it and by inter
viewing members of the Board of Ath
letic Control.
The committee, advised by Helen
Masters Bunting, head of the women's
physical education department, con
sists of Rosamund Clarke, chairman,
Dorothy Bogen, Gertrude Laidlaw,
Ruth Roseberry, and Marion Holley.
Benetta Merner, president of A.W.S.,
is an ex-officio member of the com
mittee.
