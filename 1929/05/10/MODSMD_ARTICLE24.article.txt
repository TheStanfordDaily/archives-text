# Women's Gym and Crew
## 
### 
If in thirty-eight years the women have got no farther toward the
building of a women's gymnasium than they have now, it is hard to
believe that in that thirty-eight years they have kept up a consistent, or
ganized effort to get one. it is a known fact that they have done nothing
outside the University to get their gym. The University, which is in the
end responsible for the financing and equipping of the women's physical
education department, has done nothing. Now the women ask that the
Board of Athletic Control immediately give them $300,000, not to mention
some $82,000 interest which will acrue to this sum and will needs he paid
by the Board.
The loudest clamor has arisen of late from the women at the Daily's
endeavor to make an inquiry into the possibility of reinstituting crew at
Stanford. For thirty-eight years the women accomplish nothing and then
when crew is brought up as a possible returned sport, the women become
greatly aroused and shout, "Down with crew. It's a matter of crew or
women's gymnasium, and we want a new gymnasium."
No one intended to thrust the new gym idea back into the shadows of
obscurity where it has futilely struggled these many years. The Daily
has hacked the new gym idea since it was a four column calendar.
No, the Daily had no intention of shouldering out the women. It
does favor crew, it does feel that a student expression upon the matter
will settle the problem once and for all, and so it is carrying on its plan
to gain this opinion. The Daily believes that the University should do
something to help the women in their efforts. It also believes that if the
Board of Athletic Control can, it should do its shareâ€”that body owes
something to the women of the University. The women's gymnasium
should be built, but give crew a chance also.
