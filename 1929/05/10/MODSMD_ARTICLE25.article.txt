IS IT A QUESTION OF WHICH ONE?
Crew or a new women's gymnasium?
This is the way the proposition is
expressed by the Stanford Board of
Athletic Control. Increased financial
outlay caused by the Boards activities
outside the sports realm in such ven
tures as the building of a $450,000
dormitory, the replacing of the present
seats in the stadium, and a $50,000
donation to Stanford's first million en
donient, is said to be the reason.
The question is—lf Stanford does
not get crew, will the women get a
new gymnasium? There probably is
no "fair-minded" person who would
say that the University would benefit
more by crew than they would from
a new women's addition, but as yet
there is no guarantee that the fair
sex will gain the vantage they have
so long coveted.
Seldom is the student body forced
to consider this matter seriously. For
the past decade, and probably before
that time, rumors of a new structure
were current. But as yet nothing, in
this regard, has been accomplished.
And yet a few days ago the question
of crew was raised and the women
immediately said, "Nothing doing, we
want a new gymnasium."
Admitting that the structure known
as Roble Gymnasium is a deplorable
spectacle, what have the women done
to warrant consideration in the mat
ter of a new building? A small group
have managed to keep the subject
from dying out all together, hut the
big majority have taken no active in
terest, and no attempt has been made
to raise money from outside sources.
The Board of Athletic Control has
been looked upon as the eventual
quarry, and even the attempts to in
terest them have been half-hearted.
Although the Board should be ex
pected to donate at least part of the
amount necessary for building a now
structure, no pressure has been
brought to boar on that organization.
The general manager has been inter
viewed, it is true, and is reported to
have said that he, personally, hoped
that the women would get the money.

But he is also quoted as saying that
he would like very much to see crew
i here, although he gave various rea
! sons, financial and otherwise, why it
! would not be practical to establish
that sport at the present time.
To put the question in such a man
ner as "Shall it be crew or a new
| women's gymnasium" is absurd. That
is to say, shall we spend $25,000 or
! $300,000. True, a building is some
| thing that will endure, but $300,000
1 is also a great deal of money, and is
j not to be obtained for the asking. Yet
| the women seem to expect the Board
i to expend that much money without
| any apparent effort on their part. Why
haven't any of the Board members
been approached on the subject? At
least why haven't any of the student
members been approached?
Is this just another spasmodic out
burst, or have the Stanford women
finally decided to go at the matter
in a whole-hearted manner? If the
; latter is true, they are to be con
j gratulated. If not, why hold up the
i question of crew?
