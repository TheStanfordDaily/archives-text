BLACK MAGIC. By Paul Morand.

At the present moment the negro is
causing quite a stir in the intellectual
world. A number of writers, making an
undeserved cult of the negro (and a cult
that can do him little ultimate good),
look to the black race —to its music, its
undeniably rich and melodious speech
rhythms, its unsophisticated emotionalism
—for some magic that will suffuse and
revivify our laggard culture. On the
other hand, some others decry the cult
of the primitive and look for little in the
"lush emotionalism" of the negro. Then
there is still another current attitude, the
undynamic attitude that regards the ne
gro as neither problem nor portent and
prefers to take nothing more than an
esthetic interest in the black race. It is
this attitude that determines the work of
Paul Morand in "Black Magic."
There lias never been any particular
depth to the work of Paul Morand. Like
his Renaud in "The Living Buddha," he
"takes the world of the senses for what
it is worth" and murmurs, "What's the
use? One is beaten in advance." In
"Black Magic" he takes the black races,
whether they live in the United States, in
Haiti, in Africa, for what they are worth
as material for esthetic effects, as the dec
orative stuff of a smooth, high-geared
prose that is modern in its surface aspects
and not particularly searching. He uses
his "thirty thousand miles" in "twenty
eight negro countries" as so much colored
glass to stain the white dullness of this
eternity of life, and in so doing he proves
a very amusing person. But the words
"amusing," "companionable," "witty"
about cover this diplomat and litterateur
who means to live well, "e'est-a-dire, le
plus vite possible."
"Black Magic" hardly tries to human
ize the negro. Its characters, "Congo"
Taylor, Octavius Bloom, Dr. Lincoln
Vamp, the Dictator Occide, Pam Freed
man, King Mongku, are more in the line
of silhouettes. Morand puts these silhou
ettes through many amusing paces, but it
is surroundings that interest him to the
exclusion of the heart. The Morand mind
is like a very swift firefly. It darts, for
example, at Octavius Bloom, a gentle
man of such little color that he can "pass"
for white, illumines for a moment the
problem of the negro in Georgia, casts a
swift glow on the tribulations of the
black man who passes successfully at
first in a Delaware seaside resort, only to
come to discovery and grief, and then
twists the story ironically. You perceive
many implications, but Morand doesn't
give you time enough to relate them to
the individual Octavius Bloom. Thus,
where he succeeds as an entertainer and
a decorator, he fails as a writer of fic

tioii—whose most profound duty is to
create character.
And yet, in spite of his ultimate fail
ure, there is one very fine thing about
Morand. He is keenly alive to the details
of the modern world; his stories are of
our times. For example, he speaks of
"two blacks beneath the red lamp . . . like
negatives just showing their shape in the
developer"—and the simile is distinctly
modern. A dance floor shakes "like
Brooklyn Bridge when the trolleys pass";
"sporting reporters" and baseball are
mentioned; Woolworth's five-and-ten
cent stores serve Morand with figures of
speech; Paul Whiteman's band is used
to make a point; the radio is not skipped.
The son of Senator Applejack — the
young hypocrite l— is furnished with a
plausible background as editor of the
Harvard Lampoon, and the airplane and
the mechanical piano come into the chron
icles. A colored minister describes the
onward rush of the two trains —
the fast train of God, and Satan's
express, matching their speed to see
which would arrive first at the bed
side of old Mammy Dejoye.
Of all the stories in "Black Magic,"
"The Black Tsar" is the most effective.
It combines fantasy and satire. There is
fervor in it. In writing it Paul Morand
seems to have been touched with some
concern for what values are going to
govern the world. He doesn't betray him
self, but one feels certain that for once
Paul Morand has removed his tongue
from his cheek.
