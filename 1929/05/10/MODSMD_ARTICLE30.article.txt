Today we finish the fraternities and
clubs. If you think you've been ne
glected, it would perhaps be well to
say nothing at all about it. But every
body's been mentioned. Is everybody
happy? Well . . .
VARIATIONS on
FAVORITE THEMES
"June"
(fragment)
What is so rare as a Delta Chi?
There, if ever, spring obscure folks
After curfew-time, up there lie
More than one of Life's Little Jokes.
Baseball players—and what else?
Listen —
Would anyone know if one was
misßin'?
"Smells'*
(Christopher Morley)
Why is it that the scribes have dwelt
So little on the Tlieta Delt?
These are the tendencies we've felt:
A house quite unimpressive, set
Part way up Lasuen, and let
To lads fraternal (you just bet)
A lawn too small for virile play
No parking place, no entranceway,
No cheering after rushing day . . .
Who IS a Theta Delta, pray?
"Wynken, Blynken, and Nod"
(with liberties)
Arcos, Capitan, Tigre, and Cuad —
ro (d) out. (Well, wooden shoe?)
After the Commons food had been
gnawed
Hollering "Give us our due!"
"Where are you going and what do
you wish"
Miss Handy asked the four
"We are going to town for an edible
dish"
(Which made Mister Erwin sore)
"Unlike Oliver Twist we don't want
any more!"
We're winkin'
and blinkin*
—Oh God!
