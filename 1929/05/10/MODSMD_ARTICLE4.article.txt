# ENTRIES FOR ANNUAL R.O.T.C. HORSE SHOW TO CLOSE TOMORROW
## 
### 
All members of the R.O.T.C. who wish
to enter the annual Horse Show to be
held May 31 must sign up today or to
morrow morning with Captain Richard
A. Gordan. Drawings for mounts will
take place tomorrow afternoon at 1:30,
and all contestants must be present or
appoint someone to represent them at
that time.
The show will be given in the R.O.T.C.
riding hall, east of the Encina polo field,
and not in the new show ring as was an
nounced in Monday's Daily. This year's
affair, the tenth in the history of the
Stanford R.0.T.C., is being sponsored by
Scabbard and Blade, honorary military
society.
Although there will be no races or
steeplechases on the program this year,
the events listed offer more thrills to the
audience and greater opportunities for
the display of ability by the competitors
than those of any previous show. The
day's program will include: mounted
wrestling, mounted tug of war, musical
chairs, horsemanship contest, military
jumping, polo bending race, polo sake
race, touch and out jumping, and a spe
cial exhibition of stunt riding or "mon
key drill" by the members of the en
listed detachment.
