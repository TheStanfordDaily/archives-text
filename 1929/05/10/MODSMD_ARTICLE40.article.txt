# INTIMATE ACCOUNTS FROM FILM HISTORY RECEIVED BY MILES
## 
### 
Since the Movie Day recently observed
at Stanford, Dr. Walter R. Miles, who
has taken an active part in the anniver
sary observance ceremonies, has received
a number of letters, commending the Uni
j versity on the celebration and giving
I some interesting reminiscences 011 the
early efforts of Senator Stanford and of
Muybridge in the development of the
j movie.
Sherman T. Blake, a resident of San
Francisco, wrote Dr. Miles, telling of the
very first pictures that Muybridge took,
j Blake wrote that he, at the time 17 years
j old, was designated to aid Muybridge in
I his work at what was called the Old Bay
District track.
Blake says, "We took along an express
wagon with a heavy orange red cloth tent
for a dark room. We used an improvised
ruby light with a candle in it. When a
horse sprung the instantaneous shutter
by means of a string stretched across the
track, Muybridge would immediately take
the plate holder from the camera and de
velop the picture. I distinctly recall my
joy and pleasure when Muybridge called
from the dark room, 'I've got a picture
of the horse jumping from the ground.'
I also have the memory of carrying many
buckets—heavy wooden ones—of water
to the dark room during the developing
of the pictures.
It was later that Muybridge developed
the idea of using a battery of cameras,
making it comparatively simple to get a
picture of the horses with all four feet
off the ground at once. Blake, as did the
others who wrote, expressed great pleas
ure over the commemoration exercises in
recognition of the early achievements at
Stanford with the movies, and was espe
cially glad that such a ceremony had been
sponsored by the University. Blake said
that he had had some of the original pho
tographs, but that they were destroyed in
the San Francisco earthquake and lire of
1906.
Dr. Miles will undoubtedly prepare a
full historical account of the Stanford-
Muybridge experiments for publication,
and he is anxious to receive anything in
the line of documents, letters, or old
prints that might relate to the early ex
periments or to those men who collabo
rated in them.
