LOS ANGELES, May 9 (JP).—Defeat I
in the Mexican rebellion has brought
to Los Angeles a little group of worn,
discouraged men, once outstanding '
figures in their own nation, but now
exiles in a country strange to them.
These unsuccessful revolt leaders,
a few of them wealthy but most of J
them near want, are prepared to ad-1
just themselves to American life and '
industry. The threat of a firing squad
awaits them below the border.
