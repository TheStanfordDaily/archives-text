# MURRAY CONFRONTED BY MANY PROBLEMS IN WASHINGTON POST
## Stanford Professor Deluged With Applications For Seats in Church 
### 
When Dr. Augustus Taber Murray
ol the Classical Literature department
went to Washington to preside over
the Friends' meeting there at the re
quest of President Hoover, he was
immediately confronted with number
lees problems, according to reports
from his friends who have visited him
recently.
Dr. Murray's church is a very small
one, with a capacity of not more than
300 persons when the Sunday School
mom is thrown open. The Quakers
had never been accustomed to asign
ing pews to members as do many
other churches. Dr. Murray was at
once deluged with applications. His
mail has become a serious problem,
for he receives many invitations to
speak at religious meetings, conven
tions, and other social and cultural
affairs.
Prior to the Easter services, Dr.
Murray received requests for more
than 700 "tickets" for the occasion.
One enterprising "worshipper" frantic
ally urged his claim to four seats, two
of which, according to his special re
quest,. were to be so placed that he
could "look at the President without
appearing to stare."
Dr. Murray also receives many let
ters containing suggestions for ser
mon topics. The idea of the writers
of these letters is to have Dr. Murray
use the material, thereby bringing it
to the attention of Hoover, and caus
ing him to act upon the information
he receives in that manner. Dr. Mur
ray's mai» contains quantities of what
might be termed "nut" letters, with all
kinds of impossible requests and sug
gestions.
A very good picture of Dr. Murray
■was recently printed in the rotogra
vure section of the New York Times,
while his church is, of course, the
most celebrated at the Capital because
of the President's attendance. The
Doctor will be back on the campus
for the summer quarter to instruct
classes as usual.
