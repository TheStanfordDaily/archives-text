## 
### 
Albert Rhys Williams, who has just
concluded a study of peasant life in
Russia, will speak on "Five Years In
Russian Villages" next Tuesday eve
ning at 7:30 o'clock in the assembly
hall.
Williams, who is a native of Ohio,
was educated in Germany and re
turned to this country to become an
ordained Congregational minister in
which post he served for seven years
1 in Boston. He then acted as corres
! pondent for the Outlook for a year,
1 and later became a lecturer on the
j Chautauqua route. He was in Russia
! during the war, serving as assistant
| in the Commissariat and Department
I of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet gov
j ernment. He prepared much of the
I propaganda sent into Germany and
j is known as the organizer of the In
ternational Legion.
From 1922 to 1928 Williams watched
the life of the people of typical Rus
sian villages, settling in each one for
months —sometimes a year or more —
at a time. Far away from the cultural
influences of the cities in the rural
districts, where the ancient traditions
are still deeply rooted, he observed
the social revolution which is tearing
up the old habits and customs, and
forming a new social order. In the
far Archangel, in the ancient province
of Suzdal, on the lower Volga, amongst
the Tartars, in the old ikon-painting
villages of Vladimar, in the mountains
of the Caucasus, and in the Crimea —
under extraordinarily varied condi
tions, Williams has travelled and
lived.
"The Russian Land," his latest book,
deals with his five years in the villages
of this country. He is also the author
of "In the Claws of The German
Eagle," written during the war;
"Lenin: The Man and His Work";
"Through the Russian Revolution";
and a pamphlet, "Seventy-Six Ques
tions and Answers."
