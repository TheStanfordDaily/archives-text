# KRUEGER WORKS ON SIZE MEASUREMENT OF BACTERIA AGENT
## 
### Ellis Galt 
Measuring the Bize of an agent
which may, in the future, be used to
cure many diseases, is the latest ex
periment to be performed by Dr. A. P.
Krueger, assistant professor of bac
teriology, and his assistants.
Discovered in 1916 by Professor
d'Herelle at the Pasteur Institute, this
agent, known as bacteriophage, has
already been used by Dr. Krueger and
two colleagues in experiments at the
Stanford University Hospital which
successfully combatted certain types
of infections in the urinary tract.
Bacteriophage acocmplishes its work
by causing the dissolution of bacteria.
Besides having great possibilities for
curing diseases, the phage Is in itself
harmless.
The nature of the phage is not
known, and, in pursuit of information
as to its character, Dr. Krueger, and
Henry T. Tamada, his assistant, per
formed a series of experiments to de
termine the size of the bacteriophage,
which is invisible even under a micro
scope.
The phage was first purified and
measured while in this state by mak
ing collodion filters of known pore
size. The experimenters noted at what
point the material was retained. Then,
by measuring the filters according to
formulae for rate of flow, and by re
tention of colloidal particles of known
size, Dr. Krueger and Tamada arrived
at a measure for the pure phage cor
puscle.
Another result of the experiments
was the discovery that the phage
readily attaches itself to protein ag
gregates in ordinary suspensions and
is then much larger. This discovery
led to further studies of colloidou
filters by Dr. Krueger and Robert Rit
ter, but these have not yet been com
pleted.
Further work dealing with the elec
trical charge of purified bacteriophage,
and whether it possesses an iso-elec
trie point, is now being undertaken by
Dr. Krueger with the assistance of
Seymour Smith and O. J. Gibson.
Publication of the results of bac
teriophage therapy in combatting in
fections of the urinary tract will ap
pear soon in the medical journal,
"Archives of Internal Medicine."
These clinical studies were performed
some time ago at the Stanford Univer
sity Medical School by Drs. Krueger,
Schultz, and Faber on 87 cases of in
fection of this sort.

Discovered in 1916 by Professor
d'Herelle at the Pasteur Institute, this
agent, known as bacteriophage, has
already been used by Dr. Krueger and
two colleagues in experiments at the
Stanford University Hospital which
successfully combatted certain types
of infections in the urinary tract.
Bacteriophage acocmplishes its work
by causing the dissolution of bacteria.
Besides having great possibilities for
curing diseases, the phage Is in itself
harmless.
The nature of the phage is not
known, and, in pursuit of information
as to its character, Dr. Krueger, and
Henry T. Tamada, his assistant, per
formed a series of experiments to de
termine the size of the bacteriophage,
which is invisible even under a micro
scope.
The phage was first purified and
measured while in this state by mak
ing collodion filters of known pore
size. The experimenters noted at what
point the material was retained. Then,
by measuring the filters according to
formulae for rate of flow, and by re
tention of colloidal particles of known
size, Dr. Krueger and Tamada arrived
at a measure for the pure phage cor
puscle.
Another result of the experiments
was the discovery that the phage
readily attaches itself to protein ag
gregates in ordinary suspensions and
is then much larger. This discovery
led to further studies of colloidou
filters by Dr. Krueger and Robert Rit
ter, but these have not yet been com
pleted.
Further work dealing with the elec
trical charge of purified bacteriophage,
and whether it possesses an iso-elec
trie point, is now being undertaken by
Dr. Krueger with the assistance of
Seymour Smith and O. J. Gibson.
Publication of the results of bac
teriophage therapy in combatting in
fections of the urinary tract will ap
pear soon in the medical journal,
"Archives of Internal Medicine."
These clinical studies were performed
some time ago at the Stanford Univer
sity Medical School by Drs. Krueger,
Schultz, and Faber on 87 cases of in
fection of this sort.
Measuring the Bize of an agent
which may, in the future, be used to
cure many diseases, is the latest ex
periment to be performed by Dr. A. P.
Krueger, assistant professor of bac
teriology, and his assistants.
