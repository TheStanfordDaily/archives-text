# MOVIE APPARATUS IS NOW BEING SHOWN AT CAMPUS ART GALLERY
## 
### 
Aii exhibition of unusual novelty is
now being shown at the Stanford Art
Gallery and will remain on display dur
ing the rest of this month. Through the
courtesy of the Association of Moving
Picture Arts and Sciences of Hollywood,
the gallery has secured a collection of
apparatus and materials being used by
the movie industry in making modern
pictures.
Of even greater interest to movie fans
are the relics likewise included in this
collection. The first outfit worn by Char
lie Chaplin in his pictures, and the whip
used by Douglas Fairbanks in "Don Q"
are attracting the most attention.
The material from Hollywood is sup
plemented by the pictures and camera
which E. J. Muybridge used in taking
action shots of Senator Stanford's race
horses. Muybridge's work was signifi
cant in the history of moving pictures, as
these photographs, made at the order of
Senator Stanford in 1878, were the first
experiments in action photography.
A special exhibition of prints by the
leading print artists of Europe, composed
of a variety of etchings and block prints,
will also be shown during the rest of
May. These numbers were collected by
Pedro Lemos, director of the Stanford
Museum, on his European trip of last
year.
