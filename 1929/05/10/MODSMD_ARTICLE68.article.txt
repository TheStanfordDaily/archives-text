# SPORTS OF 1929
## A 						Burleigh Pirate 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
A little experience helps a pitcher
a lot —especially a spit-ball pitcher.
Take Burleigh Grimes, for instance.
Back in 1917, his first full year in the
majors, he won three and lost sixteen
games for the Pirates. Eleven years
later, back with the Smoky City team
again, after a tour of Brooklyn and
New York, the Bad Man from Wiscon
sin won twenty-five games and lost
only fourteen. "What a whale of a
difference a few years make!"
The fact that the husky Wisconsin
ite enjoyed his best year in his thir
teenth season, and when he was 35
years old too, gives promise for a
score or more of victories in 1929.
Burleigh's good seasons always have
come in pairs, too. He won 23 games
for Brooklyn in 1920, and 22 in 1921.
Then in 1923 and '24 he coupled to
gether 21 and 22 wins. Now watch him
add about 24 to last year's quarter of
a century!
John McGraw must gnash his teeth
every time he thinks of that trade

| of the winter of 1927 that sent Grimes
I to the Pirates for Vic Aldridge. Vic,
[of course, was a dismal failure. A
holdout, then unable to win, then sent
! to the minors. No earthly good to the
! Giants, while Grimes was not only a
, great aid to the Pirates, but also in
j strumental ni keeping the New York
j ers from winning the pennant.
It doesn't seem so long ago that
! Burleigh was a member of Brooklyn's
j high-priced quartette, Vance, Wheat,
Fournier, and himself. The total salary
of these four babies was more than
1 $61,000 in 1926. Not as much as Ruth's
j today, but plenty, just the same, espe
j daily for four Dodgers. Now, only
i Vance remains in Flatbush, and Uncle
j Robbie must certainly wish, with Mc
' Graw, that he had Burleigh Grimes
| back in his flock.
"Lord Burleigh" is built like the
' Rock of Gibraltar and is full of ag
gressive spirit. And being one of the
few surviving spit-ball pitchers doesn't
work to his advantage, either.

[of course, was a dismal failure. A
holdout, then unable to win, then sent

It doesn't seem so long ago that
! Burleigh was a member of Brooklyn's
j high-priced quartette, Vance, Wheat,
Fournier, and himself. The total salary
of these four babies was more than
1 $61,000 in 1926. Not as much as Ruth's
j today, but plenty, just the same, espe
j daily for four Dodgers. Now, only
i Vance remains in Flatbush, and Uncle
j Robbie must certainly wish, with Mc
' Graw, that he had Burleigh Grimes
| back in his flock.
"Lord Burleigh" is built like the
' Rock of Gibraltar and is full of ag
gressive spirit. And being one of the
few surviving spit-ball pitchers doesn't
work to his advantage, either.

A little experience helps a pitcher
a lot —especially a spit-ball pitcher.
Take Burleigh Grimes, for instance.
Back in 1917, his first full year in the
majors, he won three and lost sixteen
games for the Pirates. Eleven years
later, back with the Smoky City team
again, after a tour of Brooklyn and
New York, the Bad Man from Wiscon
sin won twenty-five games and lost
only fourteen. "What a whale of a
difference a few years make!"
The fact that the husky Wisconsin
ite enjoyed his best year in his thir
teenth season, and when he was 35
years old too, gives promise for a
score or more of victories in 1929.
Burleigh's good seasons always have
come in pairs, too. He won 23 games
for Brooklyn in 1920, and 22 in 1921.
Then in 1923 and '24 he coupled to
gether 21 and 22 wins. Now watch him
add about 24 to last year's quarter of
a century!
John McGraw must gnash his teeth
every time he thinks of that trade

I to the Pirates for Vic Aldridge. Vic,
[of course, was a dismal failure. A
