LOS ANGELES, May 9.
Tory skirmishing along the gasoline
battlefront, which had quieted recent
ly, tonight saw the price-cutting war
renewed in some sections of this city.
Richfield Oil Company of California
raised its price to 19% cents per gal
lon, while other major companies
clung to the "established" price of
18% cents, however, independent
dealers and some stations belonging
to large production companies were
selling as low as 12% cents, while, the
average price in the affected districts
was 14% cents.
