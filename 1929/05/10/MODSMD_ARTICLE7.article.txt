# ASTRONOMERS SUCCEED IN PHOTOGRAPHING CORONA OF SUN IN PHILIPPINE ECLIPSE
## 
### 
MANILA, May 9. (/p) —Astronomers from Hamburg, Germany, and Wash
ington, D.C., who brought tons of instruments half way around the earth
for a four-minute clear view of the sun in eclipse were successful today at
Hollo, central Philippines.
The sun's corona, visible only during total eclipse of the sun, was photo
graphed through huge telescopes upon the ground and from two airplanes
<S>which soared 5,000 and 10,000 feet

above the earth in rare atmosphere.
As a result, it is hoped that some
thing further may be learned of tho
composition of the corona, which may
reveal the secrets of the atom and
the ultimate structure of the universe.
The scientists also hope by study of
the photographic plates to learn some
thing of the chemical composition of
the corona, its origin, its relation to
sun spots, and the rapidity with which
it takes shape.
Four astronomical expeditions point
ed their instruments at the sun from
Philippine stations for about five
hours, during which it was partially
obscured by the moon, with totality
only four minutes. The largest of
these expenditures was the well
equipped one from the Naval Observa
tory at Washington, headed by Com
mander C. H. J. Iveppler.
This expedition and that of Dr.
Reginald L. Waterfield of Johns Hop
kins University and Dr. Wyndham
E. B. Lloyd of London were stationed
at Iloilo, with directors of the Manila
observatory. At Sogod, Island of
Cebu, the University of Hamburg's
expedition, took its stand, but was
unfortunate when clouds obscured the
eclipse.
Reporting the successful observa
tions at Iloilo, Commander Keppler
said that the naval eclipse program
was completed as scheduled, "secur
ing thirteen variable exposures on
plates with the 65-foot camera and
forty-six others with two polar axis
and celostat cameras."
The eclipse was visible only in a
shadowy path about 100 miles wide
that extended across the Indian ocean
eastward from Africa through Poly
nesia into the Pacific. Along this path
way were stationed several astrono
mical expeditions, but reports received
here indicated that weather condi
tions in the Philippines were far more
favorable than elsewhere for the ob
servations.
As seen from Manila, about 90 per
cent of the sun's face was obscured.

was completed as scheduled, "secur
ing thirteen variable exposures on
plates with the 65-foot camera and
forty-six others with two polar axis
and celostat cameras."
The eclipse was visible only in a
shadowy path about 100 miles wide
that extended across the Indian ocean
eastward from Africa through Poly
nesia into the Pacific. Along this path
way were stationed several astrono
mical expeditions, but reports received
here indicated that weather condi
tions in the Philippines were far more
favorable than elsewhere for the ob
servations.
As seen from Manila, about 90 per
cent of the sun's face was obscured.
MANILA, May 9. (/p) —Astronomers from Hamburg, Germany, and Wash
ington, D.C., who brought tons of instruments half way around the earth
for a four-minute clear view of the sun in eclipse were successful today at
Hollo, central Philippines.
The sun's corona, visible only during total eclipse of the sun, was photo
graphed through huge telescopes upon the ground and from two airplanes
<S>which soared 5,000 and 10,000 feet

above the earth in rare atmosphere.
As a result, it is hoped that some
thing further may be learned of tho
composition of the corona, which may
reveal the secrets of the atom and
the ultimate structure of the universe.
The scientists also hope by study of
the photographic plates to learn some
thing of the chemical composition of
the corona, its origin, its relation to
sun spots, and the rapidity with which
it takes shape.
Four astronomical expeditions point
ed their instruments at the sun from
Philippine stations for about five
hours, during which it was partially
obscured by the moon, with totality
only four minutes. The largest of
these expenditures was the well
equipped one from the Naval Observa
tory at Washington, headed by Com
mander C. H. J. Iveppler.
This expedition and that of Dr.
Reginald L. Waterfield of Johns Hop
kins University and Dr. Wyndham
E. B. Lloyd of London were stationed
at Iloilo, with directors of the Manila
observatory. At Sogod, Island of
Cebu, the University of Hamburg's
expedition, took its stand, but was
unfortunate when clouds obscured the
eclipse.
Reporting the successful observa
tions at Iloilo, Commander Keppler
said that the naval eclipse program
was completed as scheduled, "secur
ing thirteen variable exposures on
plates with the 65-foot camera and
forty-six others with two polar axis
and celostat cameras."
