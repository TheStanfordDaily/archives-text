# ALLEN IMPRESSED BY MUSIC CONTEST HELD IN BRITISH COLUMBIA
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, has just returned from Victoria,
8.C., where he acted as adjudicator of
piano and organ playing competition
among young students for the annual
music festival.
Mr. Allen was much impressed with
the remarkable stimulus offered by
this contest. He says: "The amazing
thing was that in a total of 35,000
there were nearly 4000 entrants in the
various solo, choral, and ensemble
classes. Four halls were packed every
morning and afternoon, and the larg
est church in the city has a capacity
crowd every evening. Some contest
ants came from the mainland, not
only from British Columbia, but the
States of Washington and Oregon, and
the festival bids fair to be of an in
creasingly international nature, em
bracing the whole of the Northwest."
