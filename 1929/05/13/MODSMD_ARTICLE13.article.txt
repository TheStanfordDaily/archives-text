# MUSIC, CHORUSES OF "MOVING ON" OUSTANDING FEATURES OF OPERA
## 
### H. J. K 
Pink lemonade set to music, with a
chaser or so of the front page variety,
suited the taste of the audience of the
1930 Junior Opera well, Saturday
night in the Assembly Hall. "Moving
On," by Laird Doyle, John Paul Jones,
and James Webb, was a clever musi
cal comedy with unusually good racy
dialogue.
One of the multiple features, the
music and Jeanette Owens' interpreta
tion of Zuzu were highlights. The
melodies by Griff Williams, Neal
Spaulding, and George Starbird, were
of fine lyric quality. The score was
iexceptional in Junior Opera history,
much of it being of standards which
would credit professional musical com
ody. "Stop Thief, You Stole My
Heart," by Spaulding, and "Our Love
j Is Tangled in Moonbeams" were two
beautiful melody numbers, and the
res! of the program contained songs
lhat would all have been features in
an operetta of less consistent musical
score.
Of (he principals, the wildcat lion
| charmer, Zuzu, played by Jeanette
Owens, ran off with the honors. With
a part easy to overplay, she succeeded

in emphasizing the best dramatic op
portunities of her character with most
attractive villainy. Tom Watt, as
Garry, the small-town boy, made the
best of a rather colorless part and
played to particular advantage in the
scenes with Zuzu.
Helen Ward, as Sally, the tight-rope
walker, had a part barren of little but
sunshine and Pollyanna, but did her
best with the opportunities offered. Of
(he three, only Watt's voice was well
suited to the difficult range required
| by the melodies. In his numbers with
| the men's chorus, "Living in a Tent"
| seemed the best.
Paul Speegle, as Roy, had not only
one of the besjt parts of the script, but
also earned himself a place in the
rogues' gallery of campus comedians.
Speegle is not the red-headed Delmer
Daves nor A1 Cass, but his histronic
lability is of the same variety. Parnie
Storey, as Barbara, the Bearded Lady,
the feminine comedy relief of the
i show, as well as being a tonsorial suc
' cess, was a worthy foil for Roy.
Tom Henry, as Ricardo, the bad
mun .took the Wild Duck wave from
i his hair and dyed it as black as his
interpretation of the villain. Hal Con
roy made an elegant barker and set
ofT the freaks to an advantage. The
freaks themselves were a marvel to
behold, and the tattoed man, Sailor
Jack, played by Tom Pike, drew ap
plause from the audience. It's a shame
they aren't permanent for they would
have done any circus proud.
The chorus was above average, too.
Not only were the girls very pretty,
but the choreography was excellent.
Francis Boone, as director of the danc
ing and also for her own solo nautch
dance, is to be complimented. The
first act, with four large chorus num
bers, was outstanding. "The Reason
Why" appealed to us particularly, but
it is difficult to discriminate in the
clever dances.
The sets, by Harold Helvenston and
his crew, were colorful as well as in
teresting technique. The quick
changes were especially noteworthy
and if this record continues in campus
productions another tradition will
have been shattered. The lighting was
a let-down in the general standard,
but the incidental off-stage noises of
the circus more than made up for the
defect. It is scarcely polite to mention
Peter Crosby along with the lions, but
his singing entre'acts should surely be
mentioned with appreciation.
"The Superstition Song," out of
which Hub Moffitt, excelelntly dis
guised as a darky, brought all the
spooks, was one of the best specialty
acts of the show. Fred Spearman, also
in the guise of a darky, entertained
the circus crowd as well as the audi
ence, with his well-executed tap

dance. The banjo novelty number, in
which seven campus banjoists, Bill
Barks, Bill Johnston, Dick McCurdy,
Frederick Mendenhall, Ralph Simons,
Larry Thomas, and Bob Thornton, ap
peared, added color to the perform
ance.
All in all, it was a Junior Opera
better than average and if someone
would lend it a theatre in San Fran
cisco it would deserve an evening's
chance to add to the Theatre Fund
Benefit. The authors of the book lived
up to their promises of plot and man
aged very well by the colorful locale
they selected. The juicy profanity was
at times a little querulous but never
theless consistently amusing. "Moving
On" would, in short, be one of our
choices for All-American.
