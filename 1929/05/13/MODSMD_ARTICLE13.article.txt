# MUSIC, CHORUSES OF "MOVING ON" OUSTANDING FEATURES OF OPERA
## 
### H. J. K 
Pink lemonade set to music, with a
chaser or so of the front page variety,
suited the taste of the audience of the
1930 Junior Opera well, Saturday
night in the Assembly Hall. "Moving
On," by Laird Doyle, John Paul Jones,
and James Webb, was a clever musi
cal comedy with unusually good racy
dialogue.
One of the multiple features, the
music and Jeanette Owens' interpreta
tion of Zuzu were highlights. The
melodies by Griff Williams, Neal
Spaulding, and George Starbird, were
of fine lyric quality. The score was
iexceptional in Junior Opera history,
much of it being of standards which
would credit professional musical com
ody. "Stop Thief, You Stole My
Heart," by Spaulding, and "Our Love
j Is Tangled in Moonbeams" were two
beautiful melody numbers, and the
res! of the program contained songs
lhat would all have been features in
an operetta of less consistent musical
score.
Of (he principals, the wildcat lion
| charmer, Zuzu, played by Jeanette
Owens, ran off with the honors. With
a part easy to overplay, she succeeded

in emphasizing the best dramatic op
portunities of her character with most
attractive villainy. Tom Watt, as
Garry, the small-town boy, made the
best of a rather colorless part and
played to particular advantage in the
scenes with Zuzu.
Helen Ward, as Sally, the tight-rope
walker, had a part barren of little but
sunshine and Pollyanna, but did her
best with the opportunities offered. Of
(he three, only Watt's voice was well
suited to the difficult range required
| by the melodies. In his numbers with
| the men's chorus, "Living in a Tent"
| seemed the best.
Paul Speegle, as Roy, had not only
one of the besjt parts of the script, but
also earned himself a place in the
rogues' gallery of campus comedians.
Speegle is not the red-headed Delmer
Daves nor A1 Cass, but his histronic
lability is of the same variety. Parnie
Storey, as Barbara, the Bearded Lady,
the feminine comedy relief of the
i show, as well as being a tonsorial suc
' cess, was a worthy foil for Roy.
Tom Henry, as Ricardo, the bad
mun .took the Wild Duck wave from
i his hair and dyed it as black as his
