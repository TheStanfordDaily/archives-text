# FORMER CARD COXSWAIN TAKES STAND ON QUESTION OF CREW READOPTION
## 
### ANSON REEDER 
Contrary to various and sundry reports, the voting on the proposition as
to the reinstatement of crew at Stanford which will appear on the ballot
May 21, will have some direct bearing on the question, if the opinion of
Frank ("Husky") Guerena, alumni member of the Board of Athletic Control
and former Card coxswain and rowing coach, means anything.
Guerena, in a statement to a San Francisco paper Thursday, declared that
"student interest in the sport is the principal issue. There is also the financial

problem," he add
ed, "but if the stu
dents at Stanford
want crew and are
willing to support
it, then it is quite
probable that the
Cardinals will next
fall resume the
sport which was
discontinued i n
1921."
The former coach
of Stanford's win
ning crews in 1915-
16 is a great row
ing enthusiast and
this is not the first
time that he has
voiced himself in
favor of that sport.
In an interview to
the Daily last No
vember Guerena
when asked wheth
er there was any
possibility of re
establishing crew
at Stanford declar
ed, "That depends
entirely upon the
attitude of the stu
dent body."
He believes after
making a thorough
investigation of the
subject that Stan
ford has better


Steinbergen Slough, shown in the map above, is lo
cated opposite San Carlos, nine miles from here. It is
looked upon as the probable course over which Stanford
crews will again wield their oars, providing the Student
Body decides to reinstate that sport here at the election
on May 21. (Drawing by Hubler.)
