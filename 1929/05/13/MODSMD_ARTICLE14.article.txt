Contrary to various and sundry reports, the voting on the proposition as
to the reinstatement of crew at Stanford which will appear on the ballot
May 21, will have some direct bearing on the question, if the opinion of
Frank ("Husky") Guerena, alumni member of the Board of Athletic Control
and former Card coxswain and rowing coach, means anything.
Guerena, in a statement to a San Francisco paper Thursday, declared that
"student interest in the sport is the principal issue. There is also the financial

problem," he add
ed, "but if the stu
dents at Stanford
want crew and are
willing to support
it, then it is quite
probable that the
Cardinals will next
fall resume the
sport which was
discontinued i n
1921."
The former coach
of Stanford's win
ning crews in 1915-
16 is a great row
ing enthusiast and
this is not the first
time that he has
voiced himself in
favor of that sport.
In an interview to
the Daily last No

the University of California. The
Steinbergen Slough, shown in the map
on page one, is over 150 feet wide
even at low tide, and will accommo
date a launch as well as the necessary
number of shells. The course is also
sheltered from unfavorable winds and
is deep enough throughout so that lit
tle or no dredging would be necessary.
Stanford, it isp ointed out by many,
is attempting to put off the step which
they will eventually take anywayâ€”
that of readopting crew. All the east
ern colleges of any repute that are
locted near bodies of water, make
crew one of their biggest sports. On
the coast California and Washington
have already pointed the way to those
in the East who are interested in this
form of athletic competition.
