# CONGRESS FACES NEW DEBATES IN SUMMER'S HEAT
## Tariff, Farm Measures Lag; Administration Is Balked By Increasing Difficulty New Maneuyer by Leaders, All-Summer Recess Are Rumored at Washington 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 12. (/p) â€”
Threats of long contests in both the
Senate and House on the tariff and
farm relief issues today turned the
thoughts of Congressional leaders to
a recess as the heat of summer blank
eted Washington.
With the farm bill still in the de
bating stage in the Senate and the
tariff measure just getting a start on
what appears to be a rough path in
the House, the program for the extra
session is far behind the expectations
of the administration.
Senator Watson of Indiana, the Re
publican leader, has been giving seri
ous thought to a three-week recess
next month after the House passes
the tariff measure and while it is be
fore the Senate finance committee.
But now come rumors of a new
maneuver by the administration and
other rumors that an all-summer re
cess is in contemplation. Those advo
cating the long recess declare it will
serve the purpose of permitting a
cooling off in the majority party ranks
in the Senate which were split wide
open in the bitter fight over Mr.
Hoover's farm program.
This schism in the Republican fold
in the Senate promises to get another
airing tomorrow with Senator Brook
hart of lowa, intending to discuss the
"pseudo-Republicans" whom Senator
Ress, of Ohio, the party whip, com
plained of last week after the failure
of the Republican majority to defeat
the export debenture provisions of the
farm bill.
It is the hope of Senate leaders to
dispose of the farm bill tomorrow or
Tuesday and send it to the House for
an adjustment of differences revolv
ing chiefly around the export deben
ture provision which is not in the
House bill but which the Senate
voted into the measure over the ob
jection of the President.
With the farm bill out of the way,
the Senate will take up the combined
measure for authorization of the 1930
census and for reapportionment of
the House on t>e basis of that census.
Another stiff fight is in prospect there
and when that is out of the way, the
Senate will be called upon to pass its
judgment as to the reliability of An
drew Mellon as Secretary of the
Treasury in view of his stock holdings.
