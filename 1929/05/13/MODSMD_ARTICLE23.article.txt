# When Is Crew Not a Women's Gymnasium?
## 
### 
In answer to the remarks of two women in today's Campus Opinion,
we wish to correct a few mistakes.
The aforementioned are incorrect when they say that the women have
accomplished something in thirty-eight years. The University in that
time has grown from a very small institution to one of national standing,
and the women's gymnasium, a part of this growing institution, has re
mained the same. Committees may have met, much talk may have been
made, but for actual accomplishment what is to be shown? A fine plan, a
vague idea that the Board of Athletic Control will help build a new
gymnasium, another vague assurance that in 1932 the University will do
Something (making it forty-one years during which the women's interests
in the eyes of {jirt University have been less important than various and
sundry important projects), and now more talk.
In an editorial of May 2, the plan of paying for the new building by
$30,000 yearly was explained, but the women in their interests for a new
gym didn't read this. Perhaps the editorial on May 10 in using the word
"immediately" was inexact, let it pass. It did use the words, "The women
should have a new gymnasium."
The argument is put forth that only $4,000 has been raised by the
New Theatre for Stanford Fund and so how could the women raise
anything for their gymnasium. If in four months $4,000 has been raised
for a new theatre, how much could have been raised in thirty-eight years ?
There's a little problem for home-work.
Now after all this editor and sports editor baiting is done, let's be
honest. The Daily has, as has been said these many times, been all for a
new gymnasium for the women. It has pointed out time and again the
deplorable condition of the present building. It has done what any news
paper can do to further a cause, it has given fair publicity to the whole
affair.
And now in an effort to gain something definite concerning another
matter that has hung fire for a long time, ten years to be exact, the Daily
is censured by the women. Their argument is that this matter, which is
crew, cannot do anything but hinder our interests. From where did this
idea come? Is there any motive behind it other than a move to help the
women? Will the complete overthrow of any effort to return crew get
the women a new gymnasium? These and a few other questions might
well be asked.
The Daily reiterates its stand. The women should and must have a
new gymnasium. The University has fallen down in its obligation to them
and cannot deny responsibility in the matter. The Board of Athletic Con
trol, while not obligated like the University, if it can, should do its part
toward building the gymnasium. The hamstringing of crew will not guar
antee the proposed building. And finally, a student opinion opposing crew
will not build the desired building. A student opinion favoring crew will
do much toward reinstituting that sport. So it is the Daily will gain an
opinion on crew and whether it is favorable or unfavorable we believe
that a definite settlement of the problem will be reached.

trol, while not obligated like the University, if it can, should do its part
toward building the gymnasium. The hamstringing of crew will not guar
antee the proposed building. And finally, a student opinion opposing crew
will not build the desired building. A student opinion favoring crew will
do much toward reinstituting that sport. So it is the Daily will gain an
opinion on crew and whether it is favorable or unfavorable we believe
that a definite settlement of the problem will be reached.
In answer to the remarks of two women in today's Campus Opinion,
we wish to correct a few mistakes.
The aforementioned are incorrect when they say that the women have
accomplished something in thirty-eight years. The University in that
time has grown from a very small institution to one of national standing,
and the women's gymnasium, a part of this growing institution, has re
mained the same. Committees may have met, much talk may have been
made, but for actual accomplishment what is to be shown? A fine plan, a
vague idea that the Board of Athletic Control will help build a new
gymnasium, another vague assurance that in 1932 the University will do
Something (making it forty-one years during which the women's interests
in the eyes of {jirt University have been less important than various and
sundry important projects), and now more talk.
In an editorial of May 2, the plan of paying for the new building by
$30,000 yearly was explained, but the women in their interests for a new
gym didn't read this. Perhaps the editorial on May 10 in using the word
"immediately" was inexact, let it pass. It did use the words, "The women
should have a new gymnasium."
The argument is put forth that only $4,000 has been raised by the
New Theatre for Stanford Fund and so how could the women raise
anything for their gymnasium. If in four months $4,000 has been raised
for a new theatre, how much could have been raised in thirty-eight years ?
There's a little problem for home-work.
Now after all this editor and sports editor baiting is done, let's be
honest. The Daily has, as has been said these many times, been all for a
new gymnasium for the women. It has pointed out time and again the
deplorable condition of the present building. It has done what any news
paper can do to further a cause, it has given fair publicity to the whole
affair.
And now in an effort to gain something definite concerning another
matter that has hung fire for a long time, ten years to be exact, the Daily
is censured by the women. Their argument is that this matter, which is
crew, cannot do anything but hinder our interests. From where did this
idea come? Is there any motive behind it other than a move to help the
women? Will the complete overthrow of any effort to return crew get
the women a new gymnasium? These and a few other questions might
well be asked.
The Daily reiterates its stand. The women should and must have a
new gymnasium. The University has fallen down in its obligation to them
and cannot deny responsibility in the matter. The Board of Athletic Con
trol, while not obligated like the University, if it can, should do its part
toward building the gymnasium. The hamstringing of crew will not guar
antee the proposed building. And finally, a student opinion opposing crew
will not build the desired building. A student opinion favoring crew will
