# How About Off-Campus Dramatics?
## 
### 
In the past it has been suggested after several campus productions
that these dramatic events be presented elsewhere after their campus
run much in the fashion of off-campus glee club concerts. The suggestion
has been made this year, to be exact, was made immediately after the
Junior Opera.
Heretofore there has been 110 other reason than to give the production
for the sake of giving. Now there is a legitimate reason, in fact a
capital reason to give the current production a showing elsewhere. The
presentation of "Moving On" again would bring in certain financial
remuneration which would add its mite to that yawning need, the New
Theatre for Stanford Fund. A capital reason.
As to "Moving On," let it be said that it was a noble production.
Considering the disadvantages and limitations of our own Assembly Hall,
God rest it, the production rose to great heights. Never until we rest in

thing of the nature of those seats as a top-notch inquisitional torture.
A word al>out those settings. What is there about this man Hclvcnston
that with a yard of cloth, a stick of wood, and a pot of paint he can
transform the barn-like stage of the Assembly Hall into anything from
a mountain-top in "The Devil and the Cheese" to a circus big top in
"Moving On"?
Every succeeding production should impress the student body and
those who attend campus shows of the urgent need of a new theatre
not only of the need but also of how deserving of a new theatre Stanford
dramatics have proved themselves. How about putting on another show
for this new theatre?
