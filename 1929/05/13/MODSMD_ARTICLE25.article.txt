Diana. By Henrich Mann. (New York:
Coward-IVlcCann, 1929.)
"Diana" is a richly imaginative, fan
tastic story, that is given depth and
firmness from the strong pen of its
German author so that it soars, and
yet at the same time somehow rings
true. It is the story of a splendid
dream, that turns out to be no more
than the thinnest mirage, and brings
tragedy to the principal characters.
The heroine of Diana is a beautiful
but impractical girl, the Duchess Vio
! lante of Assy. Her intense nature in
volves her in a rather sordid peasant
uprising in the kingdom of Dalmatia,
in which she loses through her mis
understanding of peasant psychology.
She sees the peasants as glorified
young demi-gods, and pictures herself
as leading a noble coup d'etat, for the
sake of a people that is strong and
beautiful. She is carried away by her
romantic nature, and her passionate
feeling for beauty.
So Diana idealizes her subjects, al
though she thinks that she really
knows them —"their voices, their lan
guage, their blood." But she finds
later that they were demi-gods only
when they remained like statues.
When they moved they became ani
mals.
The Duchess makes a gallant fight.
She tries to introduce education, jus
tice, and prosperity, but she fails at
every step, and when the conspiracy
collapses miserably, she finds that
these people of hers are only "somber,
wine-drinking, cursing beaßts, reaching
for their knives when avaricious and
drunken." Then the author, rather
callously refusing to extract her from
this failure by giving her a lover or
a devoted husband out of the revolu
tion, lets the book end while its hero
ine is at the height of her disillusion
ment. It is a very effective ending.
Even without seeing that Heinrieh
Mann wrote this book, and reading in
the foreword that it was translated
from the German by Erick Posset and
Emmet Glore, you would know that
Diana was from a foreign pen. The
style has a broadness and a vitality j
that present American writers do not i

| seem able to achieve. This German
writer possesses an astonishing fer
tility of imagination, and uses extra
ordinarily beautiful language. How
-1 ever, it is not simply a question of
| style superiority. American writers
; with the same vocabulary, and the
same imagination, could not write
such a book.
For one thing the better class of
writers here is characterized by re
serve and restraint. This Heinrich ig
nores utterly. He never uses sugges
tion to gain his marvelous effects of
incredible beauty or of incredible
ugliness. No matter what the object,
he describes it squarely and boldly, and
I fills his pages with passages that are
I unforgettable, sometimes because of
| their exquisiteness, and sometimes
because they are so excessively re
pulsive.
His portraits take hold of the
reader. For instance: "Princess Curcu
hobbled across the floor. She was a
surprising sight. When she walked
her lame knees made her impatient,
she seemed anxious to get ahead of
them, wildly waving her arms and
lapping the floor violently with her
cane. Almost sinking under the weight
,of her flesh, she bent so far forward
that the lower part of her back was
higher than her shoulders. Because
of this her dress was raised in the
back showing the old lady's swollen
legs. From her Egyptian profile, with
its flat nose, almost resting on her
upper lip, shot forth the troubled
glances of a bird of prey that has
missed its victim Her figure
grew strangely bulky below the hips;
her flesh tended to glide in lumps,
from her cheeks to her neck, from her
neck to her bosom, from her bosom
to her belly, and from her belly to
her legs. It seemed to flow down
along her stick as if it would dissolve
into jelly on the floor."
Diana is the first book that this
author has had translated into Eng
lish. Translations are in demand right
now, but even if this were not the
case, the book would be widely read,
because it is both diverting and worth
while. —M. L. R.
