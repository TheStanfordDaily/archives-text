The Editor, Sir:
In answer to the remarks of the
editor and sports editor in last Fri
day's paper, we wish to correct a few
mistakes in those articles.
The editor is incorrect when he says
that the women have accomplished
nothing for thirty-eight years. For
several years attempts have been
made to get a new gym. Last year,
the A.W.S. Committee met with the
B.A.C. in Roble Gymnasium to discuss
ways and means for a new gym. It
was seen by the Board at that time
that a new gym was an immediate
necessity. The B.A.C. said that they
would consider the matter when com
plete plans were drawn up. The Com
mittee therefore employed an archi
tect and submitted his plans in Feb
ruary of this year. Since then no ac
tion has been taken, pending the ac
tion of the B.A.C. on the plans.
It would be a foolish demand to
ask the Board to give us $300,000 im
mediately, as the editor erroneously
states we are doing. We ask for
$30,000 a year for a period of ten
years. This does not seem unreason
able, considering the fact that we have
been waiting thirty-eight years for it.
Mr. Reeder suggested that we at
tempt to raise money from outside
sources. In view of the difficulty with

which the First Million was com
pleted, we do not believe this method
very practical. Moreover, when one
considers that only some four thou
sand dollars have been raised for the
New Theatre Fund, such suggestions
appear almost impossible to carry out,
at least within any reasonable time.
The Editor states that it was the
question of crew which aroused the
women to action for a new gym. This
is not true. The immediate reason for
such action was the appointment of
a new A.W.S. Committee, with its new
plans for an extensive eampaigr.
These plans were made before the
question of crew became an issue. The
second reason for a campaign at this
time is the fact that the B.A.C. is ex
pected to take action within the next
two weeks. We very much desire fa
vorable consideration of our plans,
and believe that support from the stu
dents might further such action.
Surely, such support is not too much
to ask for, particularly when you
consider that the women have been
contributing a thousand dollars a year
to the basketball pavilion, for the past
eight years, and that through the pur
chase of tickets, they add several
thousand dollars each year to the
funds of the B. A. C.

and believe that support from the stu
dents might further such action.
Surely, such support is not too much
to ask for, particularly when you
consider that the women have been
contributing a thousand dollars a year
to the basketball pavilion, for the past
eight years, and that through the pur
chase of tickets, they add several
thousand dollars each year to the
funds of the B. A. C.

The Editor, Sir:
In answer to the remarks of the
editor and sports editor in last Fri
day's paper, we wish to correct a few
mistakes in those articles.
The editor is incorrect when he says
that the women have accomplished
nothing for thirty-eight years. For
several years attempts have been
made to get a new gym. Last year,
the A.W.S. Committee met with the
B.A.C. in Roble Gymnasium to discuss
ways and means for a new gym. It
was seen by the Board at that time
that a new gym was an immediate
necessity. The B.A.C. said that they
would consider the matter when com
plete plans were drawn up. The Com
mittee therefore employed an archi
tect and submitted his plans in Feb
ruary of this year. Since then no ac
tion has been taken, pending the ac
tion of the B.A.C. on the plans.
It would be a foolish demand to
ask the Board to give us $300,000 im
mediately, as the editor erroneously
states we are doing. We ask for
$30,000 a year for a period of ten
years. This does not seem unreason
able, considering the fact that we have
been waiting thirty-eight years for it.
Mr. Reeder suggested that we at
tempt to raise money from outside
sources. In view of the difficulty with

which the First Million was com
pleted, we do not believe this method
very practical. Moreover, when one
considers that only some four thou
sand dollars have been raised for the
New Theatre Fund, such suggestions
appear almost impossible to carry out,
at least within any reasonable time.
The Editor states that it was the
question of crew which aroused the
women to action for a new gym. This
is not true. The immediate reason for
such action was the appointment of
a new A.W.S. Committee, with its new
plans for an extensive eampaigr.
These plans were made before the
question of crew became an issue. The
second reason for a campaign at this
time is the fact that the B.A.C. is ex
pected to take action within the next
two weeks. We very much desire fa
vorable consideration of our plans,
and believe that support from the stu
dents might further such action.
Surely, such support is not too much
to ask for, particularly when you
