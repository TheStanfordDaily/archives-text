WHAT PRICE CREW?
"If we have crew, it will steal ma
terial from other sports such as foot
ball and track." This seems to be one
of the loudest groans whenever the
subject of crew reinstatement is men
tioned.
But this sport does not take
from the others, the reason being
It demands a different type of
man. Rowing requires a rather
tall, rangy, and wiry individual,
with strong legs as well as arms.
It would take a certain class of
men who are not now doing any
thing particularly outstanding in
any other branch of athletics, and
so there would be practically no
loss to the coaches they are now
under.
There are few exceptions to the
rule. California has not had a man
who participated In both football and
crew since 1922 when Dan McMillan
played tackle on the Wonder Team
and held down a position on the var
sity eight. And such is the case with
most colleges and universities that
support crew.

Another fallacious argument against
crew is its alleged strenuousness. The

common belief is that it breaks down
a man physically, the after effects
sometimes continuing throughout life.
Certain crews are cited; for example,
someone will say, "Look at its after
effects, only one man is living that
rowed on Podunk's crew in 1906. That
proves crew is too strenuous. It
causes an enlarged heart which even
tually results in the death of the oars
men." Such a theory has been proven
false as the following excerpt will
show:
This statement was made by
James A. Ten Eyck, dean of
American rowing coaches and
himself a crew mentor at Syra
cuse University. "I have had
literally thousands of oarsmen
under my charge, and in all the
fifty years of my experience, there
has never been a fatality nor a
serious injury, due to rowing,
among all these men. I know of
but two casualties among oars
men, and in both cases these men
were proved to have been physi
cally unsound, so that the injury
could in no way be laid to rowing
activity.
"Every now and then some mis
informed or only partially in
formed person comes along and
talks profoundly about the 'ars
men's enlarged heart.' The fact
has been established by statistics
compiled at Yale and Harvard
(the result of examinations ex
tending over a period of years) i

that crew men were longer lived
than any other group of students,
athletic or non-athletic. This state
ment should silence all hysteri
cal discussion about 'oarsmen's
hearts.' As for the 'former athlete'
who is all through with any kind
of strenuous exercise at 40, there
is something to look to besides
his having been a college athlete."

tances," by James Ten Eyck in the
May 27, 1925, "Outlook.")
