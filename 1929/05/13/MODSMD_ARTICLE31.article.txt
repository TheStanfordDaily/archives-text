# SPORTS OF 1929
## The 						Record-Cracker 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Out in Ohio is a shy little violet
named George Simpson, who can run
so fast that he makes Major Segrave
look like a piker, and who has been
giving that old hundred-yard record
of 9 3-5 an awful beating lately. Be
tween April 20 and May 4 he bettered
the world's record twice and equaled
it once, which is real sprinting in any
kind of weather, and with Claude Bra
cey, of Rice Institute, Texas, running
at about the same rate of speed, it is
cjuite likely that a new standard
world's mark of 9 2-5 for the "cen
tury" will be established before the
season is over.
On April 20, in the Ohio State-Pitts
burgh dual meet at Columbus, the
black-haired Buckeye flyer ran the 100
in 9.5 seconds and the 220 in 20.6,
which equals the accepted standard
for that distance. There was no wind

blowing there at the time, except that
made by the Ohio Comet himself.
The scene shifts to the Penn Re
lays, at Franklin Field, Philadelphia,
on April 27. This time the 22-year-old
Ohio State junior defeated the speedy
Karl Wildermuth, of Georgetown, by
three yards in the invitation hundred,
to equal the accepted world's record
of 9 3-5, held by Dan Kelly, Howard
Drew, Charley Paddock, Cyril Coaffee,
and Chet Bowman.
A week later, at the Ohio Relays at
Columbus, George did it again, this
time in 9.5. This equaled once more
Paddock's American mark, not ac
cepted by the International Amateur
Athletic Federation.
Simpson is the Western Conference
champion, and failed to make the 1928
Olympic team only because he pulled
a tendon in his leg in the semi-final
heat.
