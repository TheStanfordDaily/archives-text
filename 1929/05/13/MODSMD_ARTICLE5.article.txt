# Long Conference On German Debts Will Close Soon
## 
### 
PARIS, May 12. (/P) â€”Today ushered
in the fourteenth week of the confer
ence of international experts on re
vision of German reparations and the
general opinion in the conference cir
cles was that, whatever the outcome,
it would be the final week.
The conference hinges on two im
mediate points. The first is whether
the German conditions to the proposal
of Chairman Owen D. Young will be
accepted by the Allies. The second,
which at present is held in abeyance,
is whether the allied creditors can
agree on a distribution among them
selves of the reparations annuities on
a distribution among themselves of
the reparations annuities on a smaller
scale than each had hoped.
The situation in these two respects
will be set forth in a report by Sir
Josiah Stamp which will be placed be
fore a plenary session on Tuesday. Dr.
Hjalmar Schacht, chief of the German
experts, spent the week-end confer
ring with leading industrialists of his
country, presumably seeking their
support for compromise measures. It
was now understood that the main
feature of the German reservations is
a stipulation of Germany's right to de
man revision of annuities at the end
of ten or fifteen years. Germany feels
she should benefit from any revision
by the United States of debt funding
agreements with the creditors of Ger
many.
