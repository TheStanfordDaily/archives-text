# Women's Interclass Track Meet Will Be Held Today
## 
### 
The freshman and sophomore wo
men's track teams will meet this af
ternoon in the next to the last inter
class meet of the season. The result
of the competition is problematic, as
the teams are evenly matched, having
made about the same average in scor
ing against the juniors and seniors in
the last four meets.
Dorothy Sweet, freshman captain,
will probably be the star of the meet.
She has run better time in the dashes
than any other underclassman, and
has proved a superior ability in the
running broadjump.
