# IOWA SCHOOL IS CLOSED BY STUDENT RIOT
## Board of Trustees Causes Disturbance by Firing Entire Faculty 
### 
DES MOINES, lowa, May 12. (#>) —
The doors of Dea Moines University,
Baptist Institution, were barred today
following the student riot of last night
which broke up a meeting of the
board of trustees and damaged build
nigs, following the ousting of the en
tire faculty.
Dismissal of the faculty members
and the subsequent disturbance was
said to have been the outgrowth of a
long standing Fundamentalist-Modern
ist controversy at the institution.
Dr. Harry Wayman, president of the
school, recently refused to discharge
a professor, against whom charges
of "modernistic utterances" were
brought, and called a meeting of the
board of trustees to consider asking
the resignation of the complainants,
including Dr. T. T. Shields, president
of the board.
The board yesterday upheld the com
plainants, however, and ousted Presi
dent Wayman and his faculty.
How long the school would remain
inactive was undetermined. Dr.
Shields, who left last night for Buffalo
to attend a meeting of the Baptist
Bible Union of North America, said
it would be closed indefinitely. The
fate of the school is expected to be
decided at the meeting. Dr. Shields,
accompanied by E. A. Roberts of
Cleveland and E. A. Brownlee of
Toronto, had a police escort to the
railway station.
A riot squad of policemen was
necessary to disband the group of
students that stormed the board meet
ing last night, driving the trustees to
cover in a closet, defacing the walls
with eggs, breaking furniture, and
scattering records. The student body,
while backing President Wayman,
was said to have another grievance
due to Dr. Shield's ban on fraterni
ties and sororities.
Max Schimpf, of New York, who
presided at a 22-hour session of the
trustees of Des Moines University
Friday and Saturday, revealed tonight
that the board investigated charges
of alleged moral turpitude against Dr.
T. T. Shields, board president, and
Miss Edith M. Rebman, secretary, had
found them without foundation.
