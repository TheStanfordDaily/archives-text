What Famous Users Say About Richfield
In my opinion, Richfield Qasoline and Richlube Motor
Oil is the ideal combination for every car. It is a com
bination that will give greatest efficiency in the opera
tion of the car, both from the standpoint of power,
speed and dependability as well as in economy of
operation. I have used them exclusively for many years
in racing motors and in my own private cars and can
conscientiously recommend them to every motorist as the _ _
finest products of their kind that are made.
