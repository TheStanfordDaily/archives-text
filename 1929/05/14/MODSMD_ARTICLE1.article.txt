# LEADERS GATHER FORCES TO PASS FARM MEASURE
## Republican Chiefs Commence Final Drive to Get Bills On Books Before Summer Acceptance by Lower House Is Not Probable; Against Plan for Revenue Raising 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 13. (/P)â€”New
signs of trouble for farm relief arose
today as Republican leaders in Con
gress began to collect their forces for
the drive to get that legislation on
the statute books and the tariff meas
ure through the House before the ar
rival of summer.
As the Senate neared a vote on its
farm measure carrying the controver
sial export debenture provision, word
came from House leaders that they
would refuse even to receive this bill
because they considered the deben
ture provision infringes upon the
right of the House to initiate all reve
nue raising legislation.
Senator Brookhart of lowa, one of
those called "pseudo Republicans," in
a letter recently by Senator Fess, Re
publican, Ohio, informed the Senate
today that he was not "mad" at the
Ohioan but was "just sorry for him."
Senator Watson of Indiana, the Re
publican leader, brushed aside sugges
tions for an all-summer recess, but he
is still looking favorably on a recess
tor a month or three weeks as soon
as the House gets through with the
tariff bill and while it is before the
Senate finance committee for consider
ation.
The path ahead of a resolution by
Senator Wheeler, Democrat, Mon
tana, to investigate working condi
tions in the textile industry, was
smoother by the withdrawal of Sena
tor Simmons, Democrat, North Caro
lina, of opposition. This was made con
tingent upon including the whole in
dustry in the probe, which was origi
nally limited to three Southern states.
Hoping to get the farm bill out of
the way tomorrow, the Senate will
turn immediately to the combined
measure for reapportionment of the
House and the authorization of the
1930 census.
