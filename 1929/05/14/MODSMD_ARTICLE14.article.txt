# Plan Hawaiian Theme For Toyon Dance Decorations
## 
### 
An Hawaiian theme will feature the
decorations for Toyon Club's informal
sport dance, to be given May 24. The
sport dance, which takes the place of
the Co-ed dance usually given in the
spring but abandoned this year be
cause of its apparent decline in popu
larity, will be the only one given by
the club this quarter.
The committee in charge of the
dance is composed of Les Garner,
chairman; Spud Harder, Alexis S.
Ehrman, George McKee, and Joe Gor
don. Although the date for the bid
sale has not yet been announced, the
committee has ruled that only 100 bids
will be sold.
