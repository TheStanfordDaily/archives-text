## Injunction Granted Against Action of Des Moines University Board 
### 
DES MOINES, lowa, May 13. (/P) —
A court order today reopened Des
Moines University, Baptist Funda
mentalist institution, after it had been
closed indefinitely Saturday night by
the trustees.
The district court granted an in
junction on application of six students
against the action of the board of
trustees which resulted from a stu
dent bombardment with eggs and
stones of the administration building
as a protest against ousting by the
board of the entire faculty, including
President Harry C. Wayman.
Although classes proceeded in an
orderly fashion today the Students'
Ministrial Association including sev
eral ordained Baptist ministers,
adopted a resolution protesting the
"domineering attitude" of Dr. T. T.
Shields, president of the board.
The cause of the student uprising
was said in the resolution to lie in
the fact that "the board of trustees
allowed Dr. Shields to summarily dis
miss the entire faculty without re
ceiving any report or recommendation
whatsoever from the administration
knowing that the act would surely
jeopardize the credits of the students
and would drive the faculty and stu
dent body away.
Aside from a few broken windows
and egg splotches on the walls of
unversity buildings—the damage from
the student riot was estimated at $75
—the campus had resumed its normal
appearance today. Students assembled
at 7:30 a.m. to hear an announcement
by President Wayman that he would
obey the board's ruling to close the
school.
