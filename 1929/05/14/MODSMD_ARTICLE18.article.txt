# CARD POLOISTS SHOW IMPROVED TEAMWORK FOR O.S.C. CONTESTS
## 
### 
Showing a great improvement in
teamwork and hitting ability, the
Stanford varsity played its last prac
tice game yesterday afternoon on the
Encina Polo field in preparation for
the games with 0.5.C., Thursday and
Saturday.
Although the Oregon State lineup
will include three letter men, Preston
Varney at 1, William McGinnis at 2,
and Twain Bodmer at 3, only one of
these played against Stanford at Cor
vallis last year and the team has
played only two outdoor contests this
year. These men, together with Cedric
Boeseke, have won six straight in
door polo games at Corvallis, and
have lost only one game tills season.
Offsetting the greater experience of
the Oregon men will be the fact that
they will play on unfamiliar horses
and in an outdoor game. If the Stan
ford malletmen improve as much in
the games as they have the past week,
the two matches will be full of action
for all concerned.
