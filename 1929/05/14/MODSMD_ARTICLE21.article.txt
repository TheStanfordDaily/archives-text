# HAY-BURNING FROSH DISMAYED AT COST OF $20 PER STACK
## 
### 
Spring Is Here.
Although occasional haystack
fires were reported last week, the
season really got under way last
night with six conflagrations be
fore 9:30 o'clock. The first two
fires, between Encina and the
Library, were well supported.
However, few rooters made the
trip to the third in front of
Toyon, and the three fires near
Roble were entirely without stu
dent attendance.
Consternation reigned among
the frosh humorists when it was
discovered that Encina contri
butes the financial backing for
the fireworks at $20 per stack.
Even the most conservative pre
dict a bigger and better bonfire
season as soon as the upper
classmen find out that the fresh
man class is underwriting the
best up and coming sport on the
farm, after crew.
