# SOPHOMORES FAVORED TO DEFEAT JUNIORS IN CLASS SOCCER TODAY
## 
### 
Juniors meet sophomores today in
what will probably be the deciding
game of the interclass soccer series.
Because of an injury sustained in
practice yesterday by Christensen,
star junior forward, the sophs are
favored to win.
With four varsity forwards, Val
lenga, Mujica, Eberhardt, and Nich
ols, playing, the sophomores are ex
pected to present a fast attack. In ad
dition to these men, three other letter
men will start for the second-year
men. They are Reynolds at half, and
Burns and Dalton, fullbacks.
The juniors, led by Captain Mayer,
have a smooth-working eleven, and
may surprise to gain the victory. Be
sides Mayer, two other varsity men
will compete for the juniors, O'Don
nell at forward, and Wittausch at full.
The sophomore team as freshmea
last year won the interclass soccer
championship. This year they have
beaten the freshmen 2-0 in the only
game yet played. The juniors won
their first game from the seniors by
default.
