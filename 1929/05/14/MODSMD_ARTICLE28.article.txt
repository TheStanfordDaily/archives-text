# Ignore the Facts?
## 
### 
Sitting hack in complacent indifference the University administration
has ignored the discnssion of the present eating conditions in Encina
Commons and its cause, inefficiency. The Daily presented a comparative
price list showing that the University charge to student hoarders is en
tirely too high, it pointed out the existence of dissatisfaction this year
and during the past several years, it concluded that dissatisfaction coupled
with high price looks for its cause to one thing: inefficient management.
No explanation has been made by the University. The Daily points
now to the Union. The Union has as its organization principle, student
direction. This is not a fact in practice. A dollar of every ninety-nine
dollars paid by students quarterly goes to the Union. This amounts to a
yearly sum of over eight thousand dollars paid by students giving them
a doubtful return. Are supposedly self-supporting stores, dining hall,
cafeteria, and dormitory rooms the return to the student body for this
eight thousand dollar yearly investment?
According to president's reports for the past five years a profit has
been made by the Union as a whole of $43,000. Perhaps this is the eight
thousand yearly investment.
The University administration may ignore the queries made by the
Daily, but the facts still remain. The Commons charges too much, the
Union is given student financial support for negligible return, the Union
—anon-profit-making, student-directed (?) organization—makes a rather
too substantial profit, and the management of this entire organization is
inefficient or the present situation would not exist. Must the student body
accept these facts and join the University administration in its compla
cent indifference?
