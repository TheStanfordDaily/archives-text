# Another Bar in the Prison

### 
Stanford women are carefully sheltered from the hard and cruel
world by numerous rules and regulations of the Administration. The
winds of freedom blow every day until 10:30 and then they quiet down
peacefully under the tranquil stillness of administrative requirements.
The 1928 Women's Council worked hard and long in putting into
action for the time a system of automatic late leaves for the women. The
winds actually started blowing a little stronger for a while. One of the
most progressive steps of last year's Council was the institution of auto
matic late leaves for all women on publications. This was something that
has been needed for some years, and from the very nature of the work
done on the publications, automatic late leaves are necessary.
Last week the 1929 Council abolished the 1:30 automatic late leaves,
and changed it to 11 :30. Thus two hours were cut off the work, and the
competition is made much more difficult. Competition is an integral part
of all work on publications—and as every woman finds two or three men
against her, how is there going to be even a semblance of a fair chance
for her in the light of this new rule?
It has been stated that individual women will be given special per
mission to work on publications after 11:30. Well and good, but what
member of Council wishes to be called on the phone at 11:25 to be
asked permission for late leave as some eleventh hour "hot news" breaks
on the Daily, cr some additional work must be done on the Quad before
morning? It is rarely ever possible to predict what is going to happen
during the course of an evening, and the argument that the privilege will
be abused is extraordinarily foolish as no one will stay up until that hour
simply for the sake of staying up. College work requires a certain degree
of health, and all people on publications find it necessary to consider the
problem of apportioning their time carcfully.
More than the inconvenience this new regulation is bound to work
oil A.W.S. members of the staffs of publications, this loss of two hours
represents a step backward in women's administration. The aim of all
student councils should be progress, and this act reveals retrogression—
and places one more bar in the prison against which Mr. Norman has
so much to say.
