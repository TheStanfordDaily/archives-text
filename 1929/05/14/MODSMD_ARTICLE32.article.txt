"? Women's Gym?" reads the
sticker circulated by the women on
the campus this morning. It seems
peculiar that after all these years of
agitation that the women should be
gin an earnest campaign for a new
gym just at the time that the question
as to the reinstatement of crew at
Stanford arises.
It appears as though the Board of
Athletic Control has refused to take
a definite stand in regard to either.
"Crew or a new women's gym?" they
say. But is it a question? The women
have no guarantee from that organiza
tion that they will get a new addition
even if crew is not installed, and the
reverse is true —that even if crew is
reinstated is no reason why the wo
men wouldn't have as good a chance
as they now have.
In the first place the Board of Ath
letic Control is not responsible for
the well-being of the women's athletic
plant. That is up to the University—

and it should be up to them to build
a new addition. Why the B.A.C. should
ever raise the question of which one i
seems self-explanatory—they desire
to wash their hands of the whole af
fair.
The best and probably the only suc
cessful way to solve the problem
would be to cut out the "unfair sex"
and replace their number with an
equal number of men, which would
not only help to bolster the lower divi- |
sion but would also help to make a j
more democratic institution out of
Stanford.
The popular fallacy that women im- j
prove the culture of mere men is
"applesauce" as far as this institution
is concerned. Look at Yale and Har
vard, they have existed through the
decades without ever considering the
problem of co-education. The abolition
of women here would be the biggest
step toward advancement that this
institution has ever taken.
