# MORE GOLD FOR THE THEATRE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
When Stanford dramatic talent can
create such an admirable production
as the 1929 Junior Opera, it is too
good an opportunity for swelling the
Theatre fund not to present it again.
There are a number of students who
have not seen it; some who would
like to see it again; and the circus
extravaganza presents great possibili
ties for popular appeal. Students and
the general public, I am sure, would
avail themselves of the opportunity to
see it again.
It is a challenge to the imagination
when one realizes the potentialities
of a Stanford School of the Theatre.
If Davis and Helvenston, with the as
sistance of a few students like Laird
Doyle, Jimmie Webb, and Paul Jones,
can give the campus theatrical fare

like "Moving On," there is no limit to
what they could do with modern stage
equipment.
"Moving On" was a remarkable
achievement in dramatics as it pre
sented an excellent plot, exceptional
songs, colorful and artistic sets, and
very able direction. It was a well
rounded performance with Helven
ston's artistry outstanding. It was the
best Junior Opera I have ever seen.
May I express the hope that the
Dramatic Council will see fit to find
it possible to produce the colorful cir
cus melodrama again, as a tribute to
Stanford dramatics and for the sake
of the golden coins which will roll
into Hammer and Coffin and bring
the new theatre that much nearer
realization. Let's catch the Opera be
fore it moves on too far.
Sincerely, '29.
