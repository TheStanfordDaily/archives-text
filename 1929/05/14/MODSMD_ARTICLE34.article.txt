# BIRD LOVERS PROTEST

### 
The Editor, Sir:
We also have noticed the raids on
the swallow nests that caused the
letter in this morning's Daily. The
writer bases his complaint 011 humani
tarian motives. We wish to join him
in this but there is also a legal aspect
to the case. According to signs posted
on the campus this is a state game
refuge and it is illegal for anyone to
kill birds or disturb their nests. We

are at a loss to understand by what
right the University breaks this law,
and destroys the homes of these bene
ficial birds because they cause a little
dirt.
Respectfully,
