Will the eighteenth day of this
month see a "May B" come true?
Twice before have "May-B's" hap
pened for Col. E. R. Bradley, that
popular Kentucky sportsman. In 1921
it was Behave Yourself, and in 1926
it was Bubbling Over. You see, the
good Colonel always names his race
horses with cognomens beginning
with the letter "B," and, strangely
enough, whenever one of his "May-B's"
come in first in this most famous of
all American Derbies, another is sure
to come in second. That happened
eight years ago with Behave Yourself
and Black Servant, and three years
ago with Bubbling Over and Bagen
baggage.
If one of Bradley's entries from the
Idle Hours Farm stable comes in first
at Churchill Downs on the eighteenth,
it will be the first time in history that
one owner has won three Kentucky
Derbies. George Long is the only
other man besides Bradley, if memory
does not fail, who has owned two
winners. If Blue Larkspur leads the
Big Parade home this year, it will be
plenty of money in the bank for
Colonel B. They tell me that the Ken
tucky sportsman will clean up half a
million if the son of Black Servant de
livers in the Derby. He grabbed up
all the 10 to 1 money he could lay his
hands on in the winter books and put
up so much dough that the price went
down to 2Yi to 1.
Blue Larkspur, it is said, will not
run in the Preakness, although his
closest rival for Derby honors, Clyde
Van Dusen, will start in the Pimlico
classic. The "Big B" colt has already

j scored one victory over the son of
j Man O' War. The Bradley entry won,
j among other races as a two-year-old,
the Juvenile stakes, the National Stal
lion race, and the Saratoga Sweep
j stakes. A name of color hasn't won
i the Kentucky Derby since 1924, when
Black Gold turned the trick. Maybe
i It's Blue Larkspur's turn in 1929!
