# RUSSIAN LIFE IS TOPIC FOR TALK TONIGHT
## Williams Tells Observations In Rural Villages After Five-Year Visit 
### 
Quaint Russian customs will be de
scribed this evening when Albert
Rhys Williams lectures on "Five
Years in Russian Villages" at 7:30
o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
Williams, who spent five years
studying peasant life in the villages
of Russia and observing the many
strange customs of that country, said
in a recent lecture, "A tent of one
of the Russian sects is that a man
should beat his wife because, first, it
is an expression of his love for her,
and second, because it is good fcr her
health.
"Some Russian singers refuse to
learn to read or write for fear it will
'cause their memories to go out.' Some
of them know 100,000 verses â€”enough
for three weeks of non-stop singing.
Formerly they sang: 'As things are
so must they be; as our mothers spun
so spin we.' But today they sing: 'We
will lay our burdens upon the ma
chine'."
Living for five years in villages
where thousands of peasants have
never heard the sound of a locomotive
whistle, and where their innate con
servatism and oriental fatalism re
sult in the lowest per acre production
in the world, Williams found a new
type of peasant.
Williams is author of a number of
books on Russia, including "Through
the Russian Revolution," and a re
cent one on "The Russian Land"
which tells of his life in the isolated
rural districts. He tells of a revolu
tion which he watched, in the words
of Boris Sokolov, Director of the Cen
tral Museum of the Peoples of Rus
sia, "with a heart beating in unison
with the hundred millions of people
fighting for a new life and freedom."
