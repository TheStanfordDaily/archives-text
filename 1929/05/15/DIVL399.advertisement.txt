STEED is the keynote of the modern game. The Dayton
Steel Racquet is the fastest in the world. Thin steel strings
in a thin steel frame give it 48% less air resistance and greater
strength than any standard wood-and-gut racquet.
That's why a Dayton-driven ball gets over 20% faster.
That's why the Dayton gives you the jump on speedier players.
You've a right to demand facts. Here's the third question
of a series :
Q. How do thinner steel strings affect the life of the ball?
A. In any case more than 90% of the wear on a tennis l>all
is caused by abrasion of the gritty court, not by the racquet.
The most delicate laboratory scales revealed no difference what
ever in the amount of cover removed from two identical sets of
balls given the same number of chop strokes, one set with a
gut, one with a Dayton Steel Racquet. Dayton Steel Racquet
