# JUNIORS WIN SOCCER GAME FROM '31 MEN WITH SCORE OF 1 TO 0
## 
### 
Ten minutes of extra play were re
quired for the juniors to beat the
sophomores 1-0 yesterday afternoon,
thus winning the 1929 interclass soc
cer championship. Just before the
period ended Jennings kicked one past
Wight, soph goal-keeper, to score the
only goal of the day.
The two teams appeared evenly
matched, and waged one of the
fiercest contests ever to be seen in
interclass competition. During the sec
ond half the juniors were on the ag
gressive most of the time, but, held
back by the furious efforts of the soph
fullbacks, were unable to score.
Both teams played excellent defen
sive ball. Bill Wittau√üch, junior half
back, played a whale of a game, being
usually found in the thick of the ac
tion anywhere on the field.
