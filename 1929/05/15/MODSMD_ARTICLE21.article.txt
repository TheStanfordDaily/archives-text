## 
### 
El Toro 5, Sequoia 4
Delta Chi 5, Barbarians 4
Both El Toro and Delta Chi were
forced to play extra Innings in yes
terday's semi-final baseball games in
order to reach the final round. Toro
pushed across its winning run in the
ninth frame, and Delta Chi made its
winning marker in the tenth inning.
Vard Loomis pitched a fine brand
of ball for Toro, having sixteen strike
outs to his credit. The score was tied
up in the sixth inning, and the club
men finally tallied in the ninth with
two successive hits. Bob Krause of
the winners led the hitting for the
game with three for four. Loomis col
lected two safeties.
The Delta Chi, Barbarian ten-inning
conflict was one of the best games
seen this year on the intramural
grounds. The whole contest was a
pitchers' battle between John True
man of Encina, and Ed Robinson of
the Row team. The Barbs scored
twice in both the second and third
innings, while Delta Chi made two in
the first, one in the fifth, one in the
sixth, and the final winning run in the
tenth.
