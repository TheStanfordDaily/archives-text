# SENATE PASSES FARM BILL WITH DEBENTURE PLAN
## Sharp Differences Between Houses Occasion Doubt as To Final Passage of Bill McNary Suggests Conference Committee for Agreement On All Disputed Sections 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 14. (/P) â€” A
farm relief bill unacceptable to Presi
dent Hoover because it contains the
export debenture plan was passed to
day by the Senate, 54 to 33, after a
full month's labor.
Both branches of Congress now
have acted upon agricultural relief
legislation, but the greatest uncertain
ty surrounds its final enactment be
cause of the sharp difference between
the Senate and the House on the de
benture action. The President early in
the session strongly objected to that
method of farm relief.
The Senate measure will be mes
saged tomorrow to the House where
administration leaders are inclined to
refuse the bill. They base this on
contentions that the Senate had no
right to initiate the debenture pro
posal on the theory that it is revenue
legislation and therefore constitution
ally must originate in the House.
Strong opposition to this opinion was
expressed today in the Senate and
administration leaders have been
working to prevent a deadlock.
The farm bill was passed in the
Senate largely by the same combina
tion of Democrats and Republican in
dependents who voted for the deben
ture plan.
Immediately after the measure had
been passed, Senator McNary, as
chairman of the agriculture commit
tee, obtained consent to have a con
ference committee appointed for the
purpose of meeting with a similar com
mittee from the House, should one be
authorized, to agree on disputed sec
tions.
