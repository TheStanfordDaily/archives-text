# CARD POLO MEN END PRACTICE FOR O.S.C CONTEST TOMORROW
## 
### 
Training for the Card-O.S.C. polo
matches to be held here tomorrow and
Saturday was completed yesterday by
a light workout in the riding hall.
Lieutenant M. L. Stockton, polo
coach at the Oregon College, and his
squad of five players will arrive late
tonight. Preston Varney, a two-year
letter man, plays at the number one
position. William McGinnis, number 2,
is a three-year letter man who played
against the Cards last year at Oregon.
Twain Bodmer will play number 3,
and Cedrlc Boeseke, who is playing
his first year of collegiate polo, will
hold down the back position for the
Orangemen. The fifth member of the
squad is Dellis Cornutt.
These men have been playing an
excellent brand of polo, both indoors
and outdoors, in the north, and have
lost only one game in eight.
