## BEING INCONSISTENT TO AN ADVANTAGE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It is noticed in Monday's Daily that
Mr. Vard Loomis was appointed by
the Executive Committee to fill the
vacancy of men's sophomore repre
sentative caused by the resignation of
Thad McNamara.
It is not the purpose of this article
to attack the selection. The situation,
however, recalls to mind a past inci
dent pertaining to filling of vacancies.
If we are not mistaken, Mr. Loomis
was the defeated candidate for the
office he now holds through appoint
ment. This in itself is not very signifi
cant, but when it is recalled that dur
ing the fall of 1928 the Executive
Committee was criticized for its ap
pointment of Mr. Dick Holt for Men's
Council in preference to one of the
defeated candidates, it goes to show
that the Executive Committee has evi
dently changed its policy.
The justification for Holt's appoint
ment was in part as fololws: "By be
ing defeated for an office, a man is
automatically eliminated from further
consideration for it, because the ma
jority has expressed by its disapproval
of him. That is to say, he is eliminated
until such time as he may again run
in a popular vote. Since Holt was not
in the Men's Council race last spring,
he qualifies for his appointment in at
last this one respect."
But, then, why be consistent, espe

cially if it is to your particular ad
vantage not to be?
