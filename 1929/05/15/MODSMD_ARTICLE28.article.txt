The Editor, Sir:
Last Sunday was Mother's Day. We
all know that universities are sophis
ticated, and Stanford is one of the
most, no doubt, even as it is reputed
to be the most godless. For the latter
one can claim scientific basis to a
limited extent, but what basis can we
ascribe for rank omission of all notice
of Mother's Day except from the ads?
1 went to Chapel Sunday morning
because it was Mother's Day, and I
wished to join with others in honor
ing my Mother. I heard a sermon on
pacifism. Not one verse of song, not
one announcement, not one sentence
or reference of the preacher, not one
word of prayer for our Mothers. Is this
the way Stanford usually observes
Mother's Day? Does that "new mis
sion" of the Church prescribe its hon
oring Mothers? Is that ceremony car
ried out by a group of roughs some
where in secret, while the piously
good listen to theoretical and em
pirical sermons?
If the church has now become so
great that it must preach the sacred
ness of man's relation to aliens and
calmly ignore what is probably the
most sacred relation in life, then truly
I hope that it will become, in the
words of last Sunday's theorist, "an
organization with a past only."
Sincerly yours, T. A. J.
