FRIEDRICHSHAFEN, May 14. (/p)
—Final reparations for departure of
the giant dirigible Graf Zeppelin, on
its second trip to America were under
way here today. The take-off is plan
ned for dawn today.
A last trial flight of one hour and
three quarters was made at dusk yes
terday under command of Captain
Lehman, assistant to the ship's mas
ter, Dr. Hugo Eckener. The motors
functioned perfectly and everything
was pronounced in readiness for what
—despite its having blazed the trial
in a previous Journey—is regarded as
its great adventure.
The little south German town was
a bee hive of activity today, with its
quarters crowded with passengers,
newspapermen and sightseers. At the
Zeppelin's hangar mechanics and han
dlers busied themselves putting last
minute touches to the dirigible's ap
paratus and fittings.
It was assumed here after taking
off this morning Dr. Eckener will
shape his course to Lakehurst, N.J.,
as far south as the Azores, or even
further south, since adverse weather
conditions are expected to prevail
nlong the northern route. The extreme
southern course measures 7500 miles
as compared with 4000 minimum mile
age along the northern course.
