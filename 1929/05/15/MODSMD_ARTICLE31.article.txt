MANPOWER?

"If Stanford does decide to rein
state crew, where will she get her
material?" many are asking.
The cut in lower division students
has undoubtedly caused a serious
problem here. With only 350 freshmen
entering annually, it is predicted that
the question will become acute within
the next two or three years. Already
track and football mentors are be
moaning the loss of each year's small
crop of sterling athletes.
But still isn't it rather a fallacy
to say that Stanford cannot sup
port another sport. Disregarding
the cut, if it is possible, there are
now not over 250 men participat
ing (that is as members of dif
ferent squads) in major sports
here at the present time. This is
placing the number at a maximum,
for many of these men are active
in more than one sport.
Taking this as a logical basis
and adding the 350 men who en
ter each year as freshmen there
are still 1900 men from which to
choose a group of nine to repre
sent the University in this sport.
And surely there are nine men
among that number who could
bring added laurels to this insti
tution.
There is no good reason why this
form of athletic activity Rhould steal
from other sports. Rather it would
furnish a new activity for a group of
men who are not now doing anything
in a major Bport.
