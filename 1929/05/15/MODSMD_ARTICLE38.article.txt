# STANFORD WILL AGAIN OPPOSE BEAR, TROJAN TRACK MEN SATURDAY
## Javelin, Mile, 880-Yard Run Among Doubtful Events; Hec Dyer Favored 
### 
When the Cards compete in the
Pacific Coast Conference, southern di
vision, track and field meet in Los
Angeles Saturday, they will be oppos
ing the University of California track
men for the fourth time this year and
the Southern California Trojans for
the third. In all three of their encoun
ters with the Bears Stanford has come
off ahead, but its record with U.S.C.
is a little different, the Southerners
having one defeat and one victory
credited to them against Stanford.
Stanford trounced California in the
annual Big Meet, the Pacific Coast
Relays at Fresno, and the Pacific Asso
ciation meet at San Francisco. The
U.S.C.-Stanford dual meet was decided
in favor of the Cards, 74% to 56%, but
in the FYesno Relays April 18 the
Trojans came back to win from the
Cards, 57% to 45%.
Although California and U.C.L.A.
will be entered Saturday, the meet
should develop into another Stanford-
U.S.C. battle for honors. California's
athletes cannot be conceded more
than twenty points, while the U.C.L.A.
Bruins cannot be doped to take that
many. A good sprinter and a fair high
jumper seem to be the only potential
point-scorers on the Bruin team.
Many places which Stanford took
in the dual meet with U.S.C. will be
doubtful Saturday, and it is possible
that the Trojans may be able to sneak
through to a victory. First, of course,
comes the javelin. Kibby was winner
of this event in the U.S.C. meet; but,
since that time three excellent javelin
men have developed in the form of
Curtice Churchill, and Baxter of Cali
fornia; and if they are able to shut
Stanford out it will be decidedly to
the advantage of Southern California.
Mortenson of U.S.C., who placed sec
ond against Stanford, is another
spear-tosser who must be reckoned
with.
The mile and half-mile are two more
events in which Stanford is not likely
to score as many points as it did in
the Trojan meet. Alex McKinnon ac
counted for first places in both races,
but Saturday he will probably only be
entered in one event and cannot be
figured as a sure winner in even that.
Harry Carter of California will take
care that McKinnon doesn't beat him
again if the Card veteran runs , the
longer race. If he runs the half, he
will again be pitted against Schurr
and Gloege of U.S.C. His victory over
Schurr earlier this year was only by
a matter of a few feet.
The points Stanford may lose in the
mile, half-mile, and javelin will be
made up for by the points which Dyer
is likely to pick up for the Cards in

the sprints. Captain Charlie Borah of
the U.S.C. team pulled a muscle in
the A.A.U! meet in Los Angeles last
week and will not be able to run
again this year. This leaves Dyer as
the favorite.

point-scorers on the Bruin team.
Many places which Stanford took
in the dual meet with U.S.C. will be
doubtful Saturday, and it is possible
that the Trojans may be able to sneak
through to a victory. First, of course,
comes the javelin. Kibby was winner
of this event in the U.S.C. meet; but,
since that time three excellent javelin
men have developed in the form of
Curtice Churchill, and Baxter of Cali
fornia; and if they are able to shut
Stanford out it will be decidedly to
the advantage of Southern California.
Mortenson of U.S.C., who placed sec
ond against Stanford, is another
spear-tosser who must be reckoned
with.
The mile and half-mile are two more
events in which Stanford is not likely
to score as many points as it did in
the Trojan meet. Alex McKinnon ac
counted for first places in both races,
but Saturday he will probably only be
entered in one event and cannot be
figured as a sure winner in even that.
Harry Carter of California will take
care that McKinnon doesn't beat him
again if the Card veteran runs , the
longer race. If he runs the half, he
will again be pitted against Schurr
and Gloege of U.S.C. His victory over
Schurr earlier this year was only by
a matter of a few feet.
The points Stanford may lose in the
mile, half-mile, and javelin will be
made up for by the points which Dyer
is likely to pick up for the Cards in

the sprints. Captain Charlie Borah of
the U.S.C. team pulled a muscle in
the A.A.U! meet in Los Angeles last
week and will not be able to run
again this year. This leaves Dyer as
the favorite.
When the Cards compete in the
Pacific Coast Conference, southern di
vision, track and field meet in Los
Angeles Saturday, they will be oppos
ing the University of California track
men for the fourth time this year and
the Southern California Trojans for
the third. In all three of their encoun
ters with the Bears Stanford has come
off ahead, but its record with U.S.C.
is a little different, the Southerners
having one defeat and one victory
credited to them against Stanford.
Stanford trounced California in the
annual Big Meet, the Pacific Coast
Relays at Fresno, and the Pacific Asso
ciation meet at San Francisco. The
U.S.C.-Stanford dual meet was decided
in favor of the Cards, 74% to 56%, but
in the FYesno Relays April 18 the
Trojans came back to win from the
Cards, 57% to 45%.
Although California and U.C.L.A.
will be entered Saturday, the meet
should develop into another Stanford-
U.S.C. battle for honors. California's
athletes cannot be conceded more
than twenty points, while the U.C.L.A.
Bruins cannot be doped to take that
many. A good sprinter and a fair high
jumper seem to be the only potential
point-scorers on the Bruin team.
