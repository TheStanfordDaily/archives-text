# Building Trades Workers' Lockout Reversed By Union
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 14. (£>)—' The
cause for a lockout of 75,000 building
trades workers voted to begin at 5
o'clock tomorrow afternoon was re
moved today.
The lockout was voted yesterday by
the Building Trades Employers Asso
ciation because of failure of the Build
ing Trades Council to stop sympa
thetic strikes in support of a strike
of an electrical union which refused
to furnish workers to three electrical
contractors. Today the electrical union
reversed itself and announced that it
would now permit its men to work
for the previously "blacklisted" trio.
