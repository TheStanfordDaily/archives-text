# STANFORD CURATOR TO CLASSIFY SELECTION OF PHILIPPINE SHELLS
## 
### 
Consider first what it would be like
to be selected as one from the entire
world to do a certain task. Then add
to this the pleasant sensation of know
ing that even at 71 years of age, you
are still the most competent and ef
ficient person in the world for this
particular job, and you will have a
fairly good idea of how Mrs. Ida S.
Oldroyd, curator of the shell museum
at Stanford, must feel today.
Mrs. Oldroyd lias been selected by
the Bureau of Science in Manila, P.1.,
to classify one of the world's largest
collection of shells, a task which will
last until October this year.
The collection, which was made by
J. F. Quadras of Manila approximately
fifty years ago, contains more than
30,000 shells, representing 10,000 spe
cies. They are to be returned to Manila
after classification for research use
by the Bureau of Science.
