"To hear what these peasants of
300,000 villages in Russia are saying,
to know what they are thinking and
doing, is of vast importance at this
time of their awakening," said Albert
Rhys Williams in a lecture last night
in the Assembly Hall.
The recent revolution has brought
to the peasant an improved and re
duced military service and agricul
tural education. The most important
result, however, is that he has ob
tained possession of the land. A de
cree from the Soviet Government in
, 1917 realized the slogan of "The land
belongs to God and the people who
use it." The Soviet feels his power
depends not on words but on deeds.
In his study of rural Russia, Wil
liams found the Home of Leo Tolstoi
standing preserved by the peasants
j who appreciate to the full his part in
their progress. This home has been
converted into a library and museum.
This mass of people is like a huge,
. vigorous, powerful, vital, giant rising
j to power. "But," concluded Williams,
j "close observance of the Russian peas
ant reveals him also to be grateful
; at heart, intelligent, and sensitive to
j beauty."
