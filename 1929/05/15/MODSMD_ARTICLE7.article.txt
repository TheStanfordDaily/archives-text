# APPOINT MEN FOR CONCERT MANAGERSHIP
## Carl Mather, William Greene, Ruth Patterson Made Series Directors 
### 
Appointments of the managers of
the 1929-30 A.S.S.U. Concert Series
were announced last night. Carl
Mather will be Concert Manager;
Ruth Patterson, Publicity Manager;
William S. Greene, House Manager.
The newly appointed Concert Manager
served as House Manager during the
past season. They will begin work
immediately on next year's series.
The salaries paid the holders of the
three offices are fifty dollars a con
cert to the Concert Manager, and
twenty dollars a concert to each of
the other two managers.
Managerial tryouts for the A.S.S.U.
Concert Series will begin at 7:30 p.m.
today with a meeting of prospective
managers in the A.S.S.U. offices in
the Old Union.
Three salaried positions, Concert,
House, and Publicity managers, are
to be filled from the ranks of the
tryoutees. During the period of the
tryouts the work consists of selling
tickets, routine office procedure, pre
paring the Pavilion, and doing pub
licity work in connection with Bay
region papers.
Securing pledges for subscriptions
during the spring quarter will give
tryoutees an advantage over late
comers.
