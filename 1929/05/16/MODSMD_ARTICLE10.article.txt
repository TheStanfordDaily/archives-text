# WOMEN'S GYM FINANCE PLAN SENT B. A. C. BY BUNTING LAST FEBRUARY
## 
### 
Definite plans for financing the pro
posed women's gymnasium, sent to
the Board of Athletic Control last
February by Helen Masters Bunting,
were submitted yesterday to the Daily i
by the women's physical education de
partment head. After a request for
"definite plans" had been made by
the B.A.C. last spring quarter, Miss
Bunting tendered her report on Feb
ruary 1 in a letter to the Board.
"The letter shows exactly what is
desired by the women for the gymna
sium, and proves that the women
made definite advances long before
the question of crew was brought up,"
declared Miss Bunting. "The women
felt that a vigorous campaign was
necessary since it was nearing the
end of the spring quarter and no word j
j had been received for the Board of
I Athletic Control other tlian a notice I
j to the effect that the request was re- |
terred to the Finance Committee. The !
| crew question was not anticipated l>y !
i
| the women as coming at the same
j time as the gym campaign."
The letter follows:

"At a joint meeting of the B.A.C.
and the Committee for the New Gym
nasium held last spring, the need of
the University for a new gymnasium
for women was formally recognized.
At that time, however, plans for both
construction and finance were in
definite, and therefore no action could
be taken. Having followed certain of
the suggestions made at that meeting,
the committee now offers something
more specific.
"Dr. Wilbur, acting for the Board
of Trustees, has suggested a plan for
financing the new gymnasium. The
Board of Trustees will advance the
full $300,000. covering the cost of
construction and equipment, 011 the
condition that the sura be returned
with interest in annual payments of
$;>O,OOO over a period of ten years.
"The only way of carrying out the
plan is through a campus organiza
tion, since it would be impracticable
for the women, as it would be for the
men, to undertake raising this sum
by individual effort. The Board of Ath
letic Control is the only organization
to which we can turn in order to ob
tain funds for these annual payments.
"We feel justified in asking this as
sistance, since the Board of Athletic
Control has an annual source of reve
nue in gate receipts, and since these
gate receipts come from women as
well as men. Over a period of years
the Board of Athletic Control has ex
pended these net profits for the bene
(it of the men students, aggregating
approximately $1,000,000. Has not the
time come for a proportionate expendi
ture to be made for the women, since
there is such an urgent need for a
new gymnasium?
"We understand that the Board of
Athletic Control is about to outline a
plan of expenditure over a period of
live to ten years. We earnestly hope
that a new gymnasium for women
will be the first item in that plan.
"We would, therefore, appreciate
your serious consideration in the mat
ter of granting us this financial as
sistance."

The letter follows:

"At a joint meeting of the B.A.C.
and the Committee for the New Gym
nasium held last spring, the need of
the University for a new gymnasium
for women was formally recognized.
At that time, however, plans for both
construction and finance were in
definite, and therefore no action could
be taken. Having followed certain of
the suggestions made at that meeting,
the committee now offers something
more specific.
"Dr. Wilbur, acting for the Board
of Trustees, has suggested a plan for
financing the new gymnasium. The
Board of Trustees will advance the
full $300,000. covering the cost of
construction and equipment, 011 the
condition that the sura be returned
with interest in annual payments of
$;>O,OOO over a period of ten years.
"The only way of carrying out the
plan is through a campus organiza
tion, since it would be impracticable
for the women, as it would be for the
men, to undertake raising this sum
by individual effort. The Board of Ath
letic Control is the only organization
to which we can turn in order to ob
tain funds for these annual payments.
"We feel justified in asking this as
sistance, since the Board of Athletic
Control has an annual source of reve
nue in gate receipts, and since these
gate receipts come from women as
well as men. Over a period of years
the Board of Athletic Control has ex
pended these net profits for the bene
(it of the men students, aggregating
approximately $1,000,000. Has not the
time come for a proportionate expendi
ture to be made for the women, since
there is such an urgent need for a
new gymnasium?
"We understand that the Board of
Athletic Control is about to outline a
plan of expenditure over a period of
live to ten years. We earnestly hope
that a new gymnasium for women
will be the first item in that plan.
"We would, therefore, appreciate
your serious consideration in the mat
ter of granting us this financial as
sistance."
Definite plans for financing the pro
posed women's gymnasium, sent to
the Board of Athletic Control last
February by Helen Masters Bunting,
were submitted yesterday to the Daily i
by the women's physical education de
partment head. After a request for
"definite plans" had been made by
the B.A.C. last spring quarter, Miss
Bunting tendered her report on Feb
ruary 1 in a letter to the Board.
"The letter shows exactly what is
desired by the women for the gymna
sium, and proves that the women
made definite advances long before
the question of crew was brought up,"
declared Miss Bunting. "The women
felt that a vigorous campaign was
necessary since it was nearing the
end of the spring quarter and no word j
j had been received for the Board of
I Athletic Control other tlian a notice I
j to the effect that the request was re- |
