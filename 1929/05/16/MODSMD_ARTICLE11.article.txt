# TONIGHT'S RALLY TO SEND CARD TEAM SOUTH
## Trojan Squad Handicapped By Borah's Leg Injury But Hopes For Victory 
### 
A send-off rally for the Cardinal
track team will be held at 8:15
tonight at the Southern Pacific
depot, it was announced yester
day by the Rally Committee. Yells
for the departing athletes will be
led by Scott Webster. The train is
scheduled to leave for Los An
geles at 8:30.
With two broad-jumpers and a hur
dler again in flrst-class shape, U.S.C.
is still confident of capturing the title
in the quadrangular Pacific Coast Con
ference meet, southern division, in the
Los Angeles Coliseum next Saturday,
notwithstanding the fact that Captain
Charlie Borah will be unable to com
pete because of an injured leg.
Jimmie Payne, who until Ward Ed
monds took up hurdling seriously, was
considered the best low barrier man
on the Coast, is said to be in top form
for the first time this year. He and
Ward should provide a thrilling race
in the low sticks. Paul and Hill are
the two Trojan broad-jumpers who are
back in condition, and Virg Dowell
will have his hands full keeping one
of them from copping first place.
With Coach Dink Templeton taking
a team of twenty-seven track and field
men on the southern trip, it is evident
that Stanford will make a strong bid
for first place. The meet should de
velop into another exciting Stanford-
U.S.C. dual affair, with California and
U.C.L.A. fighting it out for fifteen or
twenty points apiece.
Johnny Morrison of the Cards and
Vic Williams of the Trojans can be
counted on to furnish one of the fea
ture races of the day. Williams is a
fine quarter-miler, and his victory
over Morrison in the Stanford-U.S.C.
meet was clean-cut. However, Mor
rison has turned in better perform
ances for the season as a whole; and
Williams will have to do some fast
stepping to beat the Card a second
time. Bob Syer turned in two excellent
races in the Big Meet and the Fresno
Relays, and he and Maynor Shove
will be fighting it out with Pearson
of the Trojans for third place.
Stanford's supremacy in the field
eventß can not be challenged by the
other three schools. Krenz and Rothert
should rule supreme in the shot with
Krenz a certainty to take the discus.
Forster is the likely man for third
place in the shot, and McLeod and
Rothert are favored to take second
and third in the discus for the Cards.
Williams of U.S.C. and Edmonds
will renew their feud in the pole
vault, with a possibility that a world's
record may fall. If Edmonds is not
too busy hurdling, he will have an
even chance of beating the tall south
ern vaulter, who has defeated him
twice this season.
The outcome of the broad jump is
uncertain, Dowell having the edge
over Paul and Hill because of his vic
tory in the Stanford-U.S.C. meet. For
all four teams entered Saturday the
high-jump is a weak event, and it is
