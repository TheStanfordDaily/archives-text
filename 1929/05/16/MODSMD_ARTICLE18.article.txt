## 
### 
"Not Herbert," a melodramatic mys
tery farce of four acts, written by
Howard Irving Young, will be the
Senior Farce, according to an an
nouncement made last night by Gor
don Davis, dramatic director. Final
selection of the cast will be made to
night.
The Stanford performance will be
the first production on the Pacific
Coast of this play, a New York suc
cess two seasons ago. Deep, dark mys
tery, windows opened stealthily, mis
sing jewels, lights turned off, screams,
combine with farcical comedy to make
"Not Herbert" an excellent example
of melodramatic art.
The title of the play is taken from
the activities of Herbert, a studious
bookworm, derided by his acquain
tances because of his scholarly inter
ests. A surprising denouement ex
poses this supposedly meek individual
in a far different light.
Thirteen characters, all with ex
cellent parts, make up a well-balanced
ca3t.
