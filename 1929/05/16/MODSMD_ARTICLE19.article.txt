In one of the best-prepared and
wittiest debates held at Stanford this
year the Cardinal forensic squad
closed its season last night by meet
ing a team from the College of Pacific
in the Little Theatre.
It was a no-decision argument, fea
tured by humor from start to finish,
011 the subject, "Resolved, That for
eign criticism of American character
istics, cultures, and ideals is justified."
The affirmative was upheld by the
trio from Stockton consisting of Gil
bert Colyear, Earl McDonald, and
Gerald Kennedy, while John Cranston,
Pardee Lowe, and Arthur Angel up

patch," they were finally forced to
meet the affirmative on their own
ground and a matching of wits and
jokes took place that kept the audi
ence in laughter throughout the eve
