# The 						Family Row Is Settled
## 
### 
Well now here we are, aren't we all, just a great big happy
family. The awful winter has passed and spring is here with a new
boss for the happy family and everybody is settled down to the little
task of ending the quarter plus something or other. It doesn't matter, i
just as long as it's plus.
The facts of the case are that two very dependable, very hard- j
working, very sincere lads have fought mightily to have the privilege
of sitting behind this typewriter every day and reeling off just such
tripe as this. A vain privilege. And now one has won, thanks to the ;
co-operation of a substantial majority of the staff.
Bloody but unbowed, the present editor rises to extend the raw ■
red hand of congratulation. He lias stood the campaign despite the j
efforts of many to send him to an early grave. Yes, thank God, winter
has passed and spring is here.
The hue and cry goes up, "The king is dead, long live the king," !
and we have not as yet heard the last clod drop on our coffin.
Then there are those bright and shining faces that will go to the j
head of the class along with the new editor next fall. There is little
Alice Ingraham, a sweet child, and chubby Bob Speers, and pert Hu
Gagos; these comprise the editorial board elect. Among those to
steer the nightly career of the Daily are Leonard Bartlett, William
Grace, Kenneth Mansfield, and Frank Whiteley, all worthy steersmen.
To the new editor, and the new appointees, the present editor raises an
overflowing bumper and loudly proclaims the day. Volume 76 of the j
Daily should be a rousing fine volume.
