# PROFESSOR G. H. STUART URGES THAT PEACE BE LOOKED UPON AS PRESENT DAY NECESSITY
## 
### 
"Peace is not simply to be consid
ered as an ultimately desired possi
bility. The rational approach to the
world's greatest problem should be
to think of it as an essential necessity
of the present," declared Dr. Graham
H. Stuart, Stanford professor of politi
cal science in a recent address before
an assembly at the University of Ore
gon. Dr. Stuart has spent several
years in Europe and South America
studying problems dealing with inter
national affairs. Next year he will go
to various countries in Europe as
visiting Carnegie professor.
Dr. Stuart quoted Bertrand Russel,
famous British philosopher, in stating
that war is a permanent institution.
Lord Bryce believes that the problem
constitutes itself as a race between
civilization and war; one will destroy
the other.
Among the factors for the realiza
tion of permanent peace are the work

ing out of suitable economic ties be
tween various nations so that their
conflicting interests will not be so
antagonistic as to result in hostilities.
In observing personally the tactics
of the League of Nations and its treat
ment of problems arising in the dif
ferent countries, Dr. Stuart believes
that its advantages are: it eliminates
secret diplomacy, all treaties now
have to be registered and published
before the public; secondly, the man
date system settles disputes in a tact
ful and peaceful manner within a very
short time.
In concluding, the lecturer stated
that the policy of the United States
should be one of self-restraint —the
high tariff with Europe is a danger
ous step. The United States should
co-operate with her neighbors and this
co-operation depends on the public
opinion aroused in the intellectual
groups of the coming generation.
