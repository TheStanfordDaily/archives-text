## THE 						DOCTOR'S DILEMNA—GEARY 
### 
When you have George Bernard
Shaw at his best in a brilliant, scath
ing play, and then have that play pre
sented by actors of the New York
Theatre Guild, what better recom
mendation can a performance have?
This is precisely the combination that
is playing for only one week at the
Geary Theatre.
The Doctor's Dilemna is delightful
all the way through, even though there
are five acts which last for three
hours. Shaw rips the medical profes
sion to pieces and shows doctors to
be opinionated bigots placing their
sole faith In some single theory and
by its use killing almost as many
patients as they save.
But Shaw is not content to attack
the doctors alone. He gets in subtle
digs at other problems—conventional
morality, vivisection, war —for in
stance.
This particular play, different from
some of Shaw's, is not long-winded,
and it is intelligible to us average
mortals. There is a delightful uneasi
ness to being the audience to one of
his plays. You can feel that Shaw is
making you the mouse, while he is
an amused cat pawing you around for
the sheer fun of doing it. Shaw builds
up a case for a certain character; you
sit back and agree with a self-satisfied
smile on your face. Then he sets to
work and tears down the very situa
tion and opinion he has built up.
Thereupon you feel very small and
dumb and want to hide behind your
ears.
The Doctor's Dilemna is that sort of
a play. You'll revel in the brilliance
of the lines, and leave with your
sense of self-importance somewhat
snuffled. The superb cast of the Thea
tre Guild acts in a way that completes
the success of the performance.
There are no individual stars among
the Guild players. A member will play
a stellar part today, a small bit tomor
row. Nor is the.'e any distinctly out
standing role in this play save that
of the one important woman part.
Main interest, however, involves the
characters of Sir Colenso Ridgeon,
whose tuberculosis cure discovery
made the reason for the play; Jen
niter Dudebat, attractive and trusting
wife of Louis Dudebat, consumptive
artist loose in matters of money and
women, and Louis himself, with the
kindly and patriarchial figure of Sir

| Patrick Cullen, retired physician, al
ways commanding attention, and Sir
j Ralph Bloomfield-Bonington, physician
! to royalty, as the chief butt of the
author.
Without exception, the roles were
j superbly played by Warburton Gam
; ble as the staid scientist, Ridgeon,
who permitted a man to die that he
might marry his widow —and admit
ted it; by Elisabeth Risdon, beautiful
and with a tone of compelling drama
in her voice, as Jennifer; by Alan
Mowbray, as the careless and non
chalant Louis; by Brandon Evans as
Sir "Paddy," and Edwin Maxwell as
the blatant Sir B. B.
This play, which I cannot recom
mend too highly, is the first of a
repertoire of four plays to be pre
sented by the Theatre Guild, each for
one week. Next week they will pre
snt "The Second Man." After that
"Ned McCobb's Daughter" and "John
Ferguson" will 1 play for one week re
spectively.

A book published by Stanford Uni
versity Press, entitled "Analytical
Principles of the Production of Oil,
Gas, and Water from Wells," by Stan
ley C. Herold, has been chosen by the
American Institute of Graphic Arts
for the "Fifty Books of the Year" ex
hibit for 1929. The exhibit opened in
New York on May 7, at the Grolier
Club and in the foyer of the New
York Public Library. It will not reach
the Pacific Coast until next spring.
This year 389 volumes were sub
mitted to the jury from publishers,
university presses, and book clubs
throughout the United States. The
chief instruction to the jury is that
the selection be made from the point
of view of the problems presented to
the publisher and designer. All of the
books were such as were manufac
] tured in the United States in the year
ending March 1, 1929. Trade books
and those of limited edition and spe
cial handling are represented in al
most equal proportion.
University presses are, as usual,
well represented on the list. In addi
tion to Stanford, Yale University
Press has two books, and Harvard,
Oxford, Chicago, and .Pennsylvania
one each. The Book Club of California
had two books accepted. The trade
books chosen represent the output of
about twenty different publishers.
