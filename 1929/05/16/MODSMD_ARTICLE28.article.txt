The Editor, Sir:
It has been the custom of Women's
Councils in these last years to do all
in their power to loosen up women's
rules and regulations. Gradually but
surely changes for the better have
been creeping in. A few Springs ago,
smoking was removed from the
"Don't" list and is now an accepted
fact. A second betterment was the
change regarding the lengthening of
the time limit that men guests might
remain at women's living groups dur
ing week-end evenings. This last year
has seen one of the greatest improve
ments in the automatic 11:30 late
leave system.
It seemed as though the women had
at last found themselves and were
moving along in the right direction.
Then suddenly the new Council and
Conference met to change the rules
once more. But instead of going ahead
they have slipped back a step. Now
the regulations stand that no women's
editors shall receive 1:30 leaves for
publications except for special occa
sions. This change is unprecedented,
as in former years all women's editors
have automatically received 1:30
leaves. The editorial in yesterday's
paper pointed out sufficient reasons
for the continuance of this former
regulation.
When a woman has become one of
the editors of her publication she has
responsibilities to meet. The Daily
does not go to press until midnight
at the earliest. This means that the
women's editor may not stay to see
the paper out except on "special oc
casions" (whenever that may be!)
Perhaps Council does not realize that
it may be imperative for her to stay
at the office until this time a number

of times during the year.
Copy editors, too, should be allowed
later than 11:30 leave on their nights
"on desk." They ought to stay until
the paper goes to press because this
is also a part of their college jour
nalistic training. Copy editors are the
future night and women's editors, and
they should not be denied any of the
necessary newspaper experience. An
automatic 12:30 system for women's
editors and copy editors would far
better suit their editorial needs. This
also applies to the women's editor of
the Quad as during spring quarter
there is enough work to keep her
busy after 11:30.
If women must run home at 11:30,
when some special work has come
up, it cannot be expected that they
will be able to work on an equal basis
with the men on the staff, and it is
hardly fair to expect them to.

as in former years all women's editors
have automatically received 1:30
leaves. The editorial in yesterday's
paper pointed out sufficient reasons
for the continuance of this former
regulation.
When a woman has become one of
the editors of her publication she has
responsibilities to meet. The Daily
does not go to press until midnight
at the earliest. This means that the
women's editor may not stay to see
the paper out except on "special oc
casions" (whenever that may be!)
Perhaps Council does not realize that
it may be imperative for her to stay
at the office until this time a number

of times during the year.
Copy editors, too, should be allowed
later than 11:30 leave on their nights
"on desk." They ought to stay until
the paper goes to press because this
is also a part of their college jour
nalistic training. Copy editors are the
future night and women's editors, and
they should not be denied any of the
necessary newspaper experience. An
automatic 12:30 system for women's
editors and copy editors would far
better suit their editorial needs. This
also applies to the women's editor of
the Quad as during spring quarter
there is enough work to keep her
busy after 11:30.
If women must run home at 11:30,
when some special work has come
up, it cannot be expected that they
will be able to work on an equal basis
with the men on the staff, and it is
hardly fair to expect them to.

The Editor, Sir:
It has been the custom of Women's
Councils in these last years to do all
in their power to loosen up women's
rules and regulations. Gradually but
surely changes for the better have
been creeping in. A few Springs ago,
smoking was removed from the
"Don't" list and is now an accepted
fact. A second betterment was the
change regarding the lengthening of
the time limit that men guests might
remain at women's living groups dur
ing week-end evenings. This last year
has seen one of the greatest improve
ments in the automatic 11:30 late
leave system.
It seemed as though the women had
at last found themselves and were
moving along in the right direction.
Then suddenly the new Council and
Conference met to change the rules
once more. But instead of going ahead
they have slipped back a step. Now
the regulations stand that no women's
editors shall receive 1:30 leaves for
publications except for special occa
sions. This change is unprecedented,
as in former years all women's editors
have automatically received 1:30
leaves. The editorial in yesterday's

for the continuance of this former
