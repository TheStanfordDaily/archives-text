### 
VATICAN CITY, May 15. (/P)â€” Pope
Pius, in addressing alumni, pupils, and
the faculty of Mondrahone College to
day, touched upon education and the
state. While the Pontiff did not men
tion directly the Italian government,
at one point he said that "the state
is not made to absorb, swallow, and
destroy the individual and family;
that would be an absurdity which
would be against nature, seeing that
the family comes first in society and
the state."
