# EL TORO NINE PLAYS DELTA CHI TODAY IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME
## 
### 
El Toro's baseball team will meet
the Delta Chi nine this afternoon at
4 o'clock on the varsity diamond to
decide the intramural championship.
Toro won the right to play in the
finals by defeating Sequoia Tuesday
by a score of 5 to 4, and Delta Chi
won from the Barbarians by the same
count. Both games went for extra in
nings, so today's contest should be a
real battle.
Vard Loomis is scheduled to pitch
for the Clubmen today. Loomis was a
regular chucker on last year's frosh
baseball team, and has had little trou
ble with the intramural outfits this
year. He has an average of over four
teen strikeouts per game, setting a
new mural record by retiring eighteen
men via the strikeout route in one
contest. Bob Krause and Les Garner
are the leading sluggers on the Toro
nine.
The Delta Chi team will be seeking
its second successive championship.
Ed Robinson, who pitched Delta Chi
to the intramural title last year, will
start on the mound today. Robinson
has a nice fast-ball and is the pos
sessor of no mean strikeout record.
A1 Biaggini will work behind the log
for Delta Chi. He is the leading hitter
of the team and works well in the
catching position.
