Active members, alumnae, and hon

ior women's honor society, went on
record as "heartily endorsing the
statement of the urgent need for a
new women's gymnasium as made by
A.W.S. and W.A.A." at a meeting
Monday.
It was moved, seconded, and carried
that copies of this resolution be sent
to the Board of Athletic Control and
Board of Trustees with the recom
mendation that each body "give ear
nest consideration to furthering this
project, so essential to the best in
terest, both athletic and social, of
women on the campus."
The Executive Committee also went
on record at its last meeting as unani

women's gymnasium.

on any college campus was completed
recently at the University of Oklahoma
for the use of students of petruleum en
