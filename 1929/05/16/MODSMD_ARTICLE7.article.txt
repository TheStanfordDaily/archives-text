# NINETY DEAD, MANY HURTIN OHIO DISASTER
## Explosion of Poison Gas Is Cause of Casualties in Burning Clinic 
### 
CLEVELAND, May 15. (/P) â€”Poison
gas and two explosions which followed
burning of X-ray films in the Cleve
land clinic today claimed nearly 100
lives.
Tonight there were 95 known dead
and hospital authorities worked des
perately to administer artificial respi
ration to 43 more who were overcome.
Victims of the disaster were dying at
short intervals and physicians sent
out appeals for additional oxygen in
the fear that the supply in the city
might prove insufficient. Oxygen is
declared the only effective means of
overcoming the gas burns.
Nearly all of the deaths were at
tributed to the deadly gas which fil
tered through the four-story brick
building slowly at first and then, aug
mented by a second and greater ex
plosion than the first, rushed up from
the basement and cut off escape down
the stairways and elevators.
Survivors said those asphyxiated
were dead, their faces turning a sickly
yellowish brown color within two min
utes after inhaling the gas.
The fumes were given off by fire of
undetermined origin, which destroyed
X-ray films in the basement. Some
pharmacists said it was bromine gas,
while Dr. William E. Lower, one of
the founders of the clinic, said it re
sembled the deadly phosgene gas em
ployed in the World War.
It was ironic that the disaster oc
curred in the very place where the
most advanced instruments and lab
oratories of science had been turned
against pain and death.
The clinic was owned principally by
Dr. George W. Crile, nationally known
physician, who was too occupied with
relief work to comment on the catas
trophe.
CLEVELAND, May 15.
ty-five per cent of the victims of the
explosion and fire in the Cleveland
clinic today died of gas, Coroner A. J.
Pearse said tonight. The coroner said
he would begin an official inquest into
the tragedy when the victims had been
identified.
