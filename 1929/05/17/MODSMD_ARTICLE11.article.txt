### 
Two (students who have not ap
peared before in Stanford dramatics
have been selected by Gordon Davis
to play the leads in "Not Herbert!,"
the Senior Farce to be presented June
12. The strenuous elimination tryouts
extended over a period of four nights,
and it was only after careful selection
that the twelve parts in Howard
Young's four-act comedy-mystery
melodrama were filled.
Trow Stephens will take the role
of Herbert Alden, the young man
around whom the complications of the
play revolve. His appearance here
will mark Stephens' first dramatic
work. Hazel Reynolds, who has had
a good deal of theatre experience out
side the University, will play Ruth
Webster, Herbert's fiancee.
However, this is not merely a two
part play, for all the other characters
are almost as important as the leads.

Gaillard Fryer, who had minor parts
in "The Devil in the Cheese" and
"What Every Woman Knows." Ed
mund North, new to the campus stage,
will play the role of Tracy Sutton, the

ter, taken by Meredyth Savage, who
has appeared in the O.S.C. theatre.
Three actors who are already popu
lar with Stanford audiences have
been selected for parts in the farce.
Jack McDowell, who took the male
lead in "What Every Woman Knows,"
will play the part of Stephen Alden,
Herbert's father. Fanshaw, the detec
tive, will be interpreted by Cecil Doll,
who has appeared in many of- the past
campus successes. And Virginia Vol
land, who played opposite Gordon
Davis in "The Queen's Husband," will
take the part of Polly, one of the
crooks.
Katherine Teach, new to the Stan
ford theatre, has been selected for the
role of Bertha Alden, Herbert's moth
er, and Claire Pierce, who appeared
in last year's Senior Farce, "Expres
sing Willie," will play Mrs. Blaine, a
New York society woman. George, the
crook who is Polly's teammate, will
be interpreted by Bernard Lapachet,
who has appeared in dramatic work

Two (students who have not ap
peared before in Stanford dramatics
have been selected by Gordon Davis
to play the leads in "Not Herbert!,"
the Senior Farce to be presented June
12. The strenuous elimination tryouts
extended over a period of four nights,
and it was only after careful selection
that the twelve parts in Howard
Young's four-act comedy-mystery
melodrama were filled.
Trow Stephens will take the role
of Herbert Alden, the young man
around whom the complications of the
play revolve. His appearance here
will mark Stephens' first dramatic
work. Hazel Reynolds, who has had
a good deal of theatre experience out
side the University, will play Ruth
Webster, Herbert's fiancee.
However, this is not merely a two
part play, for all the other characters
are almost as important as the leads.
The butler, Fletcher, will be taken by
Gaillard Fryer, who had minor parts
in "The Devil in the Cheese" and
"What Every Woman Knows." Ed
mund North, new to the campus stage,
will play the role of Tracy Sutton, the
fianc6 of Cynthia Alden, Herbert's sis
ter, taken by Meredyth Savage, who
has appeared in the O.S.C. theatre.
Three actors who are already popu
lar with Stanford audiences have
been selected for parts in the farce.
Jack McDowell, who took the male
lead in "What Every Woman Knows,"
will play the part of Stephen Alden,
Herbert's father. Fanshaw, the detec
tive, will be interpreted by Cecil Doll,
who has appeared in many of- the past
campus successes. And Virginia Vol
land, who played opposite Gordon
Davis in "The Queen's Husband," will
take the part of Polly, one of the
crooks.
Katherine Teach, new to the Stan
ford theatre, has been selected for the
role of Bertha Alden, Herbert's moth
er, and Claire Pierce, who appeared
in last year's Senior Farce, "Expres
sing Willie," will play Mrs. Blaine, a
New York society woman. George, the
crook who is Polly's teammate, will
be interpreted by Bernard Lapachet,
who has appeared in dramatic work
at St. Ignatius College. Jim, Fan
shaw's assistant, will be played by J.
Chilton Shirely.
