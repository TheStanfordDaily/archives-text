# CARDS ARE FAVORITES TO WIN "BIG FOUR" MEET TOMORROW
## Templeton Takes Twenty-Seven Men to Los Angeles For Final Western Appearance Before Philadelphia Invasion; Trojan Team Offers Threat 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
Twenty-seven Cardinal track and field men left last night for Los Angeles to
make a bid for (lie Pacific Coast Conference Championship, southern division, in
the first annual quadrangular meet in the L.A. Coliseum tomorrow. This will be
the Cards' last appearance in Western competition this year and will serve as a
conditioner for the 1.C.4-A. meet in Philadelphia May 31 and June 1.
Because of its splendid dual meet record this year Stanford is favored to fight
its way to a close victory over U.S.C. tomorrow. The Trojans were conceded an
even chance of beating the Cardinal men until Captain Charlie Borah, almost a
cinch for ten points in the sprints, pulled a muscle last week. Cromwell may use
Borah in one of the sprints, but with the 1.C.4-A. championships only two weeks

»away, it is likely that the U.S.C. leader
will not be allowed to run.
Although a fifteen-man team will rep
resent California, it is not probable that
the Bears will take better than a third;
and they will have to work to keep the
U.C.L.A. track men from finishing in
■ this place.
Borah Injured
With Borah on the injured list, Hec
Dyer, Templeton's sophomore sprinter,
is a clean-cut favorite to trim Maurer
of U.S.C., Bisbee of California, and Hill
of U.C.L.A.
Captain Ross Nichols should have
things his own way in the high hurdles.
Podge Smith and Ward Edmonds, his
teammates, will give Pogolotti of Cali
fornia and Webber and Payne of the
Trojans plenty of competition for the
other places. Edmonds, who has been
defeated in only one low hurdles race
this year, will have a somewhat harder
time of it in the lows when he meets
Jimmy Payne of the Trojans. Payne
is said to be in much better condition
than he was when Edmonds defeated
him in the U.S.C.-Stanford meet.
It looks as though Templeton plans to
enter Alex McKinnon in only the half
mile, leaving Johnny Parker to take care
of the mile. McKinnon has run some
good half-milers this year and will have
an excellent chance of turning in a win
tomorrow if he only runs in the one
race. Parker is a 4:30 man for the four
laps, and this should give him a place,
possibly a second, tomorrow.
Griset in Two-Mile
Ray Griset will be Stanford's only
entrant in the two-mile. This is his first
year of competition, and he is credited
with some promising performances. In
the U.S.C. meet a strong final sprint
enabled him to pass his teammates,
Brown and Loofbourow, and place third.
Templeton feels confident that Griset can
run under ten minutes, but this won't
be fast enough to give him more than a
third against Mossman of California and
Woodruff of the Trojans.
Johnny Morrison, Stanford quarter
miler, and Vic Williams of U.S.C. are
scheduled to provide the feature race of
tomorrow's meet. Both can do under
49 s.
Harlow Rothert and Eric Krenz should
furnish their usual duel in the shot put,
with Rothert favored because of his con
sistent competitive marks of better than
50 feet. Krenz will have things his own
way in the discus, and if conditions are
satisfactory lie may be able to break his
own unofficial world's record of 163 feet
8y 4 inches. McLeod and Rothert are the
likely men to place second and third be
hind Eric.
Javelin Close
The javelin, pole vault, broad jump,
and high jump will all be closely con
tested. Six javelin men — Kibby and
Sparling of Stanford; Curtice, Churchill,
and Baxter of California; and Mortenson
of U.S.C. —can all do 200 feet or better.
Perelli-Minetti of the Cards has tossed
the spear 198 feet, so it is apparent that
between these seven athletes there will
be plenty of competition.
Ward Edmonds and Jack Williams
will renew their feud in the pole vault,
Williams being a slight favorite because
of his victories over Ward in their two
encounters this season.
Dowell of Stanford and Hill and Paul
of U.S.C. arc fairly evenly matched in
the broad jump, Dowell having the ad
vantage because of his win in the Tro
jan-Card meet. All three are consistent
at 23 ft. 6 in.
High-Jumpers Weak
None of the four schools entered has
better than an average high jumper, and
it is a toss-up as to who will emerge the
winner. Madison and French are Stan
ford's entries.
Stanford's four-man one-mile,, relay
team ran a beautiful race in the Fresno
Relays two weeks ago to win in 3:18 2-5
and for this reason is doped to capture
the relay tomorrow from the U.S.C.,
California, and U.C.L.A. teams. The
four Stanford quarter-milers who will
run in the relay are Shove, McDermott,
Sver, and Morrison.
