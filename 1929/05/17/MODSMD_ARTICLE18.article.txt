# The 						Goose That Lays The Golden Egg

You can't have crew because there isn't enough man power at Stan
ford.
Here is a potent argument that was thrown at the Daily when it
suggested the return of crew. The argument lias heen fairly answered
through the testimony of crew coaches who claim that the type of man
needed for crew does not as a rule enter other sports. That has been gone
over carefully. Well and good if this were the Stanford of several years
back. The argument strikes more deeply now. Compare turn outs for all
sports this year with last and these'with the year before.
The little argument strikes right at the root of many a grievous prob
lem which has faced Stanford from the time the elimination of the lower
division was begun.
The University has profited indirectly and greatly by one sport above
all others, football. Last year nearly a half million dollars was netted by
the Board of Athletic Control through football gate receipts. Next year
looks as though it would equal this. But, what will the Board of Athletic
Control do when in three, four or more years 110 freshmen and sophomore
men have turned out for football and the great teams of the past that
have made Stanford competition sought after are 110 more?
A team may be made from third year transfer men providing third
year transfer men are the same grade of athletes who would have gone to
Stanford had Stanford still a lower division. It is hard to believe that
top-notch athletes will play on junior college teams two years to wait
until they can get in Stanford's when they can go to any of Stanford's
rivals and play three years varsity. No, Stanford cannot possibly have
the same championship teams it has had, and what obvious conclusion
follows? With 110 championship teams, there will be no half million gate
receipts. And even though the University may look with disdain upon
athletics as a terrible invader of its academic solitude, it has accepted little
gifts occasionally from gate receipts. What then will they do when they
want, say, another fifty thousand to round off a million for Stanford
drive, or a new dormitory?

The University has no doubt in ponderous fashion weighed out its
decision to cut off the lower division and all its official members are no
doubt congratulating each other on its immediate success. But perhaps
when Stanford has become a graduate school, with all that that implies,
when it has lost much of its national renown which comes from just such
ignominious things as football, and when that half million golden goose
egg fails to appear each year, these same profound minds may think back
and perhaps hold a shadow of regret.

The University has killed the goose that lays the golden egg and is
still manifestly pleased with itself because it has not as yet dug deep
enough into the body of the thing to find that there is no gold there after
all. The lower division will go, Stanford may herald a new era of edu
cation by this move, but its heralding will be so far ahead of all the rest
that for the next generation or more Stanford will be a strange place
devoid of much of the strength and vigor that it now possesses through
its lower division.
