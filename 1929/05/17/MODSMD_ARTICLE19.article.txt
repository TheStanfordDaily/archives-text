# Three Months In Jail For What?
## 
### 
Redwood City's jail now harbors one Carl Rave, a mechanic by trade,
and will continue to harbor this man for the next three months because
he sold a pamphlet entitled, "Family Limitation" by Mrs. Margaret
Sanger, lie was prosecuted and sentenced under the obscenity law rather
than under the statute which definitely prohibits the spread of contra
ceptive information to prevent an appeal to a higher court.
Mrs. Maria Bessanti, the wife of an Italian laborer, wrote the follow
ing to the Palo Alto Times:
When we had three little children we knew that we could not
care for any more, and had to separate although we lived in the
same house. As time went by our home life became more and
more strained. My husband . . . brought the pamphlet home. Rave
had written his name on it at my husband's request. Yes, it saved
our family, and not ours alone for it traveled around the neighbor
hood.
No conclusion is necessary. The motive of Rave may or may not have
been a humanitarian one, but the results of his action were beyond a
doubt humanitarian. When an enlightened electorate strikes its present
archaic laws affecting birth control off the statute book, fiascos 1 ike this
will no longer occur.
