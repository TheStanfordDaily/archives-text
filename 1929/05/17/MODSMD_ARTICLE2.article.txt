## 
### 
Important changes have been
made in the rules governing the
assignment and distribution of
alumni football tickets, according to
a statement issued yesterday by
John E. McDowell, alumni secre
tary. The new regulations, which
are now in effect, arc as follows:
1. Alumni dues must be paid by
July 1, 1929.
2. Graduates and former students
who have attended the University
six quarters or four semesters shall
have first preference.
3. Former students who have at
tended the University less than six
quarters or four semesters shall
have second preference. Formerly
all students received the same con
sideration regardless of the number
of quarters in attendance at Stan
ford.
All undergraduates, excepting
those planning to graduate this
quarter, who do not intend to re
turn to the University in October
must tile their names and addresses
with the alumni secretary, 174 Ad
ministration Building, in order to
receive application blanks for tick
ets to the Big Game in the fall.
