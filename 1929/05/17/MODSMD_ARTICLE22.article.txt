COLUMBIA — Strange Interlude.
This much-talked about nine-act play
will be given by the Theatre Guild of
New York for a limited engagement
of four weeks, commencing Monday
evening, May 20.
"Strange Interlude" has excited the
curiosity of theatregoers from coast
to coast because of two unusual facts
-—its length and its asides. Its length
has by now become almost legendary,
so many have been the jokes made up
about what one wit called "just an
ordinary nine-act play." The play be
gins its courst at 5:30 in the afternoon
and continues until 11 p.m., with an
intermission for dinner from 7:40 to 9.
The other novel element about the
play is a revival, in more pungent
form, of the old-fashioned- aside, Mr.
O'Neill's use of the old device being
entirely new. In "Strange Interlude,"
the characters not only speak openly
to each other, but they voice, for the
benefit of the audience, their inmost
thoughts, which are often contradic
tory of what they are saying. Mr.
O'Neill has written this play in line
with the latest theories of psychology
with regard to the importance of the
unconscious mind, so that his charac
ters think aloud, for the audience,
thoughts which they do not even
know, themselves, that they are think
ing, and in this way he exposes the
true depths of his characters as no
stage-figures have ever been probed
into before.

The theme of "Strange Interlude"
is 100 complicated to sum up briefly,
but it may be said that it concerns
the- life history of one woman's strug
gle for happiness—a woman whose
selfishness leads her to devour the
lives of three men, and even to try to
unfold the life of her son.
Judith Anderson will play the lead
ing role in the presentation of the
play at the Columbia Theatre, and
others in the cast will be Harry C.
Bannister, Ralph Morgan, Donald
Macdonald, Helen Ann Hughes, Wal
ter Vonnegut, Maud Durund, James
Tod, and Lester Sheehy.
GEARY—The Doctor's Dilemna is
finishing a one-week run under the
Now York Theatre Guild. This play of
Shaw's is heartily recommended. The
Second Man opens Monday. Harold
Helvenston stopped me this morning
to say it's great, stuff.
CURRAN—The Bachelor Father. An
amusing, high-clas, slightly gay com
edy about —well —about a bachelor
father.
ALCAZAR. —The Big Pond, with
Robert McWade, is in its fourth week.
A big butter-and-egg man abroad.
PRESIDENT—The Maniac, with Ed
mund Breese. A mystery play that's
not too scary all about a maniac and
his terrorizing of the occupants of a
mountain lodge.
GREEN STREET—Easy for Zee Zee
is still running after something like
3S weeks of off-color hut ridiculously
funny comedy.
—Clifford F. Weigle.
