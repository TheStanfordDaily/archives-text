# CALIFORNIA OARSMEN TRAINING TO DEFEND POUGHKEEPSIE TITLE
## Rumored That Bear Freshman Crew Will Accompany Varsity on Trip 
### 
BERKELEY, May 16. (PlP)—With
the last academic activities of the
spring semester over this week, Uni
versity of California oarsmen are once
more on the water, practicing for
their annual trip to Poughkeepsie and
the national regatta. The California
varsity holds the national intercolle
giate title, in addition to the Olympic
Games championship. The Bears won
their first varsity race on the Hudson
last summer, but in doing so broke
the old course record by more than
seventeen seconds to establish a new
all-time mark of 18 minutes, 35 4-5
seconds.
While Ky Ebright, the taciturn ex
coxswain who trains the Californians,
has refused to commit himself, it is
taken for granted here that the fresh
men will travel with the varsity this
year. The California babes are re
garded as the greatest first-year boat
ever developed at Berkeley.
Present plans call Tor regular, twice
a-day workouts until June 5, when the
crews will leave for Poughkeepsie.
Vassar Alumnae House, where the
Californians have lived for the last
three summers, will be their quarters
once more, but the famous "lucky"
boathouse they occupied last summer
—the boathouse that has never failed
to shelter either winner or runner-up
for some five years—will not be theirs.
However, there is some consolation in
the thought that it won't be anyone's
else, either, for the shed has been
torn down.
Ebright and Nagler are each work
ing with two boats now. Definite se
lection of the men to travel will prob
ably not be announced until early in
June.
