# "DESERT SONG" STAR EXPLAINS TRICKS OF VITAPHONE COMEDIES
## Louise Fazenda Tells How She Achieves Peculiar Movie Make-Ups 
### Ben Maddox 
Louise Fazenda, than whom there
is no one funnier in the "moo'n
pitchers," broke down and told all
about how she does it, how she sets
herself rigged up so absurdly, and
where she gets her ideas for her
unique characterizations.
She provides the humor for the
Vitaphone production of "The Desert
Song," and was in San Francisco this
past week-end for the opening.
Not that Louise sings in it! She
lets the Red Shadow do the crooning
while she rides the donkey. "And
because in the picture I rode the don
key in from the desert —backwards —1
guess people expect me to do an acro
batic act when I make personal ap
pearances. The donkey was rather
broad," she reminisces, "but that
doesn't make me capable of putting
on a juggling act when I step out onto
the stage!"
Louise says that she gets her ideas
for her characters from the street.
."Funny costumes are the result of
"poor taste. There are really plenty of
'well-intentioned but badly dressed
women in real life. Then I had a lot
of old maid aunts myself, so perhaps
you can credit some of my screen
make-ups to relatives!"
When she plays those peculiarly
shaped, timid ladies, she wears a spe
cial corset amply padded fore and aft
and all around. Personally she is very
attractive, but the public and the pro
ducers value her genius for comedy
too highly to let her be her real self
oil the screen.
She is witty and decidedly intelli
gent. The gorgeous stars may go and
aound may come, but Fazenda is ever
the laugh hit of the movies. At first
she was worried about how she would
go over in the talkies, but her voice
records so well that she now faces
the "mike" with ease. And she can't
explain how to be funny —a thing just
is or it isn't. Funny papers, f'rinstance,
can't make her laugh.
I wanted to know how she screamed
uaturally—after hearing that weird
scream of hers in "The Terror."
"I've never had any occasion to
scream naturally!" was her prompt
retort. "No one's ever held me up or
tried to blackjack me. All my scream
ing is done in the studios —and at that
I'm probably the best screamer in
Hollywood. Next time you see the fair
young heroine hollering for the hero
—try and see under the table. I'll
probably be there trying to time my
voice so her mouth can use it pro
perly!"
Although Miss Fazenda seldom
"gets her man" on the screen, due to
the scenarios' demands that she sacri
fice her looks for laughs, she was mar
ried last fall to Hal Wallis, manager
of the First National Studios. And
yes, there is one time she screams
when she's not being paid. That's at
Big Game time when Louise gives her
"vocal all" to Stanford put
the ball across.
