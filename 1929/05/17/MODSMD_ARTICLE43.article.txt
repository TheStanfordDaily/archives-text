# OPPORTUNITIES ARE GREAT IN METEOROLOGY
## Professor J. G. Brown Offers Several Courses in Little-Known Science of Atmospheric Conditions 
### Arthur McGarr 
"Meteorology today is coming to be
recognized as one of the most valuable
sciences known to the practical
world." In this way did Professor J. G.
Brown of the Physics Department sum
up the increasing use now being made
of the study of weather in all its vari
ous phases. "And because this fact has
not been recognized before," he said,
"there is in this country a great lack
of suitable men to fill the important
positions open to those trained in the
study of climatology and meteoro
logy."
"Stanford was one of the first
schools to provide for courses in this
science. When the University wae
founded a special professor was
brought out here for the express pur
pose of teaching meteorology. Dr.
Stearn was selected and he spent an
entire year in Germany studying
under perhaps the greatest meteorolo
gist of all times, Dr. Hahn. Stearns
then came back to Stanford, but be
fore he could get his work organized
he died and Stanford's meterology
courses never became an established
fact. Nothing was done about the mat
ter until five years ago when Profes
sor Brown became interested in the
subject and offered instruction in the
subject. Since then he has been offer
ing a few courses each year with sev
eral students taking the work under
him.
Involved in Aviation
Meteorology is one of the basic
studies of aviation. Many accidents
are caused by poor weather conditions,
and it is easily seen why this science
should bulk so large in this field. And
agriculture too, although it is not a
life and death matter, is in need of
the trained meteorologist. The United
States Weather Bureau has always
offered an opening for men who un
derstand the whys and wherefores of
the weather.
"Until a short time ago," Professor

Brown said, "there were very few
schools that had any kind of courses
in meteorology." Since aviation has
taken this country by storm, there has
been an increased interest taken in
the effects of the weather on flying
conditions. The Guggenheim Founda
tion has recently encouraged the
study in the schools and colleges of
the United States. A special agent of
this foundation has just completed a
tour of the country where he studied
especially the courses in meteorology
given in the various universities."

Meteorology Difficult

"People generally have the idea that
meteorology is a simple subject that
may be mastered in a few easy les
sons. The truth of the matter is that
there are few people who have had
enough mathematics and physics to
even begin the study of this science.
This is not said to scare people from
the study of meteorology but rather
to show just what is involved in the
plotting of weather maps, the fore
casting of weather, and the predic
tions of conditions of interest to avia
tion and agriculture.
"Meteorology today needs college
men trained in science. There are
plenty of men who can read an in
strument for the practical side of the
subject but as in engineering and
everywhere else, the man who knows
why a thing happens as well as what
happens, is always sure of going to
! the ton."
