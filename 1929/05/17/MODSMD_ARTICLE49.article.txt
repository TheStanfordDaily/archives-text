# Start Of Graf Zeppelin Imperilled By Stowaway

### 
FRIEDRICHSHAFEN, Germany,
May 16 (/P). â€”Passengers and metnl>ers
of the crew aboard the Graf Zeppelin,
speeding its way to America today, little
realized that their start was nearly pre
vented by the folly of a would-be stow
away.
A 22-year-old tailor named Lenker,
from Kulmbach, conceived the foolhardy
idea of hanging on the hangar roof and
trying to jump onto the Zeppelin as the
airship was taken out of the hangar.
Zeppelin officials said that had he not
been spotted by workmen he probably
would have lost his own life and so
damaged the dirigible that it might have
taken weeks to repair it.
