# DELTA CHI'S CAPTURE SECOND CONSECUTIVE MURAL BALL CROWN
## Winners Score Five Tallies In Fifth Inning to Cinch Contest and Title 
### 
The Delta Chi baseball team de
feated El Toro yesterday by a score j
of 5 to 1 to cop the intramural eham-!
pionship. The Row nine made all five |
of their markers in the fifth inning,
overcoming a one-run lead that Toro |
had established in the first frame.
Vard Loomis pitched shutout ball J
for the Clubmen until the fatal fifth i
round. Pearson and Salisman were !
walked, and the Toro right-fielder mis- j
judged an easy pop fly to let in two j
runs. Then Gentry, Delta Chi's pro-'
feasor second baseman, hit a hard j
double to right field to bring another !
marker across the platter. Larry Hall, 1
next batter, hit a fluke home run
through an outfielder's legs to bring
the Delta Chi total up to five.
El Toro made its lone run in the
first frame, when Garner singled, was
sacrificed to second, and came home
on d'Alessio's safe hit over second. A
rally started by the Clubmen in the
final frame filled the bases, but Ed
Robinson, Delta Chi chucker, tightened
up and fanned the next two men. Les
Garner led the hitting for the Toroites
with two safeties.
This Is the second straight year
that Delta Chi has won the intramural
baseball title, and Robinson has been
their mainstay in the pitcher's box.
AI Biaginni and Larry Hall proved to
be the heaviest willow-wielders on the
squad. Score by innings follows:
Delta Chi 0 0 0 0 5 0 o—s
El Toro 1 0 0 0 0 0 o—l
Batteries: Delta Chi, Robinson and
Biaginni. El Toro, Loomis and Garner.
Umpire, Don Brown.
