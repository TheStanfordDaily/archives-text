It seems that not only Ex Commit- !
tee, Cap and Gown, and other or- j
ganizations on the campus are inter
ested in the women's gym campaign, !
but it was revealed through a note left j
in that dilapidated structure that the I
janitor of said building is "going on
record" as favoring the present move
ment.
The letter read as follows:
"I have four hours each afternoon |
which I should be glad to give tq the j
committee who is in charge of the I
campaign for a new Women's Gym, if ;
1 can be of any service in its good I
work.
"I thought perhaps they might need
someone to tack up posters or other
advertising matter. Will you please
advise me if I can be of service?" !
