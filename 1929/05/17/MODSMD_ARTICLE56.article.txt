pipe in the basement room, Deputy
Wardens Max Gross and P. T. Ferrie,
I who made an investigation, reported.
| It was the story of Bofferty Bogg, a
j plumber, who was sent to repair the
j pipe, which led to the investigation
|aiul decision that the heat caused the
! flames which liberated clouds of poi
! sonous gases and overcame many of ;
j the 300 occupants of the building.
As reports were received regularly
iof additional deaths, due to the in

! mounted toward the 130 mark with
