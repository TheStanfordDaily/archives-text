# SPORTS OF 1929
## "The Haig" Does It Again 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
The hardest test of gameness in a big
Igolf tournament is to take the lead and
hold it. When Walter Hagen caught Leo
Diegel in the third round of the recent
British open championship and then kept
his lead through the last round, he merely
gave further proof to the well-known
fact that he is one of the gamest, as well
i as one of the most skillful of all golfers.
I He likes best to lie behind, for then he
j fights hardest, and oh, how Sir Walter
1 loves a good fight! But ahead or behind,
'this home-bred golfer has now won four
i British open crowns in the last eight
j years, and finished second in another. It
| is quite possible that he may yet equal or
J better Harry Vardon's record of six vic
tories in this greatest of all golf cham
i pionships.
In 1920, Walter Hagen, then United
j States open title-holder for the second
• time, went to England to play in his first
| British open. He finished a very bad
I fifty-fifth, but gave no excuses, merely
saying, "I'll be back to try it again." The
next year he was tied for sixth, and he
I won in 1922, was second in 1923, won

| again in 1924, finished in a tie for third
' in 1926, won for the third time last year,
I and is now champion for the second year
in succession.
All hail this 37-year-old wizard of the
links! This Beau Brummel, who started
1 out to be an ambidextrous baseball pitch
' or, then got a license as a taxidermist,
and finally took up GOLF, which he
turned into GOLD to the tune $50,000 to
! $75,000 a year ! Strength, form, co-ordi
i •
nation of eye, brain, and muscle, judg
ment of distance, concentration, game-
I ness, nerve, the will to win, constant
practice—mix 'em all up and you have
Walter Hagen, greatest of all profession
al golfers!

Walter Hagen, greatest of all profession
al golfers!

The hardest test of gameness in a big
Igolf tournament is to take the lead and
hold it. When Walter Hagen caught Leo
Diegel in the third round of the recent
British open championship and then kept
his lead through the last round, he merely
gave further proof to the well-known
fact that he is one of the gamest, as well
i as one of the most skillful of all golfers.
I He likes best to lie behind, for then he
j fights hardest, and oh, how Sir Walter
1 loves a good fight! But ahead or behind,
'this home-bred golfer has now won four
i British open crowns in the last eight
j years, and finished second in another. It
| is quite possible that he may yet equal or
J better Harry Vardon's record of six vic
tories in this greatest of all golf cham
i pionships.
In 1920, Walter Hagen, then United
j States open title-holder for the second
• time, went to England to play in his first
| British open. He finished a very bad
I fifty-fifth, but gave no excuses, merely
saying, "I'll be back to try it again." The
next year he was tied for sixth, and he
I won in 1922, was second in 1923, won

| again in 1924, finished in a tie for third
' in 1926, won for the third time last year,
I and is now champion for the second year
in succession.
All hail this 37-year-old wizard of the
links! This Beau Brummel, who started
1 out to be an ambidextrous baseball pitch
' or, then got a license as a taxidermist,
and finally took up GOLF, which he
turned into GOLD to the tune $50,000 to
! $75,000 a year ! Strength, form, co-ordi
i •
nation of eye, brain, and muscle, judg
ment of distance, concentration, game-
I ness, nerve, the will to win, constant
practice—mix 'em all up and you have
Walter Hagen, greatest of all profession
al golfers!
