### 
CANTON, China, May 16 (/P).—'Two ,
well equipped armies totaling 170,(XX)
men engaged in serious battle tonight on
two fronts with this rich commercial city j
as the prize. The lighting went on both i
east and west of Canton, but the reports
trickling back did not indicate with
whom the advantage lay.
The defending Kwangtung forces con-1
sisted of 70,000 men well equipped with
modern rifles, hand grenades, light field
artillery, Thompson sub-machine guns,
German machine guns, and automatic pis
tols. They had a tremendous advantage |
in possession of twenty airplanes of |
which their opponents have none. The j
Cantonese navy is also three times as
large as the attacking fleet. Besides four
modern gun boats there arc twenty-six
armed launches.
The attacking Kwangsi army, advanc
ing down the west and north rivers, had
100,000 soldiers equally well equipped
except for air and water fighting. Since
their task is to take the offensive their
greater number does not constitute an
o\ erwheltning advantage.
