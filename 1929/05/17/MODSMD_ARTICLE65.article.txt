### 
CLEVELAND, 0., May 10 (/P).â€”A
system of national airways interconnect
ed by radio and interspersed with ade
quately lighted landing fields will, in the
future, insure safety for air passengers, '
although flyers never will completely
conquer darkness, dense fog, and storms. :
This was brought out today at the first 1
national airport convention here.
To function for adequate safety, air
ports must operate night and day and
work with accurate instruments to deter
mine winds, temperatures, air pressures, j
ceilings, and other information vital to
safe flying, W. R. Gregg, senior meteor- j
ologist of the United States Weather J
liureau, said.
