# TREMENDOUS HEAT USED TO STUDY BEHAVIOR OF ELECTRONS IN ATOMS
## By Allan Hart 
### 
Heating the small piece of metal being
studied to a temperature of over 5000
degrees Fahrenheit—half as hot as Old
Sol himself—is the function of a bronze
furnace operated by Dr. George R. Har
rison, associate professor in the physics
department, over in the cool and shady
catacombs under the Quad.
Dr. Harrison is carrying on a study
gf the relative intensity of the lines of
the spectrum, in an attempt to learn how
the dancing, twisting electrons in an atom
behave—whether they prefer to jump to
the side, over each other, or around in a
circle.
Great Heat Necessary
In order that the electrons may be
studied, it is necessary either to stimu
late electrically or to heat to a high tem
perature the atoms of which some sub
stance is composed. The metal is heated
to 5000" Fahrenheit—all known metals
change to vapor at this high temperature
—in which condition it gives off an in
tense light. This light is focused by a
ten-meter concave diffraction grating—
there are not more than two or three
others like it in the world—on a long
series of photographic plates. This grat
ing really serves as a tremendously large
spectroscope; it occupies a room 40 feet
square.
Photograph Electrons
''When the plates are developed," Dr.
Harrison explained, "there are found
thousands of spectral lines; each line cor
responds to an 'electron-jump' in the
atom being studied.

[ "Now what we want to do is to find
| out which lines are blacker than others,
j because that will tell which 'electron-
I jumps' are the more probable."
The furnace itself is made of bronze,
! weighing three to four hundred pounds,
j Inside of it is a graphite carbon tube.
! The material to be studied is placed with
! in this tube, from which the air is then
j pumped. A current of 2000 amperes is
sent through the tube, heating the ma
terial to the desired temperature. The
light from the metal then passes through
quartz windows at the ends, where it is
caught by the concave grating. The
grating throws the light on the photo
graphic plates in the form of a very
j long spectrum. The spectral lines are
reproduced in their relative intensity on
the plates.
Measure Wave Length
"The blackness of the lines," said Dr.
Harrison, is measured by a micropho
tonieter which determines the amount of
silver in each line set free by the action
of the light of that wave length."
The Stanford furnace was modeled
somewhat after one at the Mount Wil
son observatory, though with many im
provements. The materials that arc now
being studied are titanium, vanadium,
iron, cobalt, and nickel.
The study is of interest, according to
Dr. Harrison, for two reasons: it in
volves the structure of the atom, which
governs the nature of all matter; and it
provides information of value to astron
omers in their study of the stars.
