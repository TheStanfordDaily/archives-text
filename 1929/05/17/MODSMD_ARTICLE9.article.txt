## Dirigible Forced Homeward With Disabled Motors Lowering Speed

| FRIEDRICHSHAFEN, May 17. (/P)
| —The Zeppelin Works received word
early this morning that the Graf Zep
pelin with two of its five motors out
of commission, was making slow
I headway against a strong wind but
; was Hearing the estuary of the Rhone
river.
FRIEDRICHSHAFEN, May 17. (/P)
—The drigible Graf Zeppelin tonight
slowly cruised homeward from the
Mediterranean with two of her five
motors crippled and eighteen disap
pointed passengers who had hoped
that Lakehurst, N.J., would be their
first stop.
The giant airship in its first twelve
hours of flight had covered nearly
1,000 miles and had reached a point
between the Balearic Islands in the
Spanish Mediterranean and Gibraltar.
From there she was to have pursued
a course over the Azores, and possibly
Bermuda, to America.
Instead,, the motor trouble, appar
ently due to the crankshafts of con
necting rods, caused her commander,
Dr. Hugo Eckener, to swing the ship
around and head for the home hangar
here. His decision was reached at 6:35
p.m. (12:35 Eastern Standard Time).
It was the first time that the Graf
Zeppelin had turned back from any
of the long voyages which had been
set for her. The first voyage to Amer
ica was accomplished despite storms
which damaged and called for heroic
repair of her fabric. No hitch devel
oped on other flights except on the
second Mediterranean cruise when for
the first time in mid-air, it was said,
a propeller was removed and replaced
while the ship hovered nearly motion
less over Spain.
