# CREW FIGURES OF 9 COLLEGES ARE SHOWN BY QUESTIONNAIRE
## Installation, Annual Cost, and Man Power Is Queried in Nation-Wide Rowing Survey Cost of Initial Equipment Is Placed at $10,000 Mark by Cornell Graduate Manager 
### Anson Reeder 
Climaxing an intensive study of the
•crew situation, the Daily today is giv
ing definite figures and information on
the cost, upkeep, and other details as
regards this sport at nine representa
tive colleges in the United States.
The colleges to whom the question
naire was sent were: University of
California, Cornell, Harvard, Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, Syracuse,
University of Washington, Wisconsin,
and Yale.
The question of installation costs
and upkeep were intricately covered,
as this has been one of the main
points stressed by those who oppose
this sport. Although crew was found
to be a deficit in every case as far as
finances were concerned, the univer
sities that sponsor it believe that they
are justified in continuing it on its
merits.
Harvard spends more than any
other university, $75,000 annually, on
this sport, and feels that it is worth
while. To quote William J. Bingham,
director of athletics at that institu
tion, "Rowing has been a sport at
Harvard since 1850. At the present
time we have 107 shells. Crew is one
of the most popular sports here and
it costs our athletic board about
475,000 a year for everything. With
so many men using our equipment
we feel justified in spending this
amount of money and we have had
as many as forty-three eights on the
river at one time."
Yale is second with an annual ex
pense of approximately $G5,000, while
the third highest, Pennsylvania, drops
to $32,000. The remaining six uni
versities spend from $10,000 to $23,000
per year. Harvard, Yale, and Pennsyl
vania are extremely high in their
figures as the costs quoted by the
other six prove. These prices in most
cases cover the cost of a training
table over a period of two to two and
one-half months which involve an ex
penditure of from $2500 to $4000.
Having accumulated their equip
ment over a period of years, none of
the crew directors could give any fig
ures as to the exact cost of establish
ing the sport. Although Romeyn
Berry, graduate manager at Cornell
University, gave the value of equip
ment there as $43,000, he also stated
that this sport might be established
at a much lower figure. "Our plant
has grown gradually over a period of
fifty years. Ten thousand dollars
ought to cover the necessary equip
ment actually needed to start row
ing."
California also estimated the cost
of equipment necessary to begin this
sport at $10,000, excluding a boat
house, which may be built for $5,000
on up.
As to the question of manpower
California and Wisconsin, the two
universities with the largest number
of men in their student bodies, have
the smallest turnouts. Only 100 candi
dates, including oarsmen, coxswain,
and managers, turn out at California.
Wisconsin also has a small turnout
mainly because they have no inter
collegiate competition unless a trip is
made to Poughkeepsie. Here the situ
ation is different. Stanford would
have at least two coast teams for
competitors in this sport.
At Harvard, where crew is as much
an intramural sport as an intercolle
giate sport, there is an average turn
out of 800 men. Other eastern col
leges have from 200 to 350 men out.
The majority of the nine universities
also look upon this sport as being on
a par with football and track.
The following comments were vol
untarily made by general managers
to whom the questionnaire was sent.
"Where any college is so situated as
to have boating facilities readily avail
able rowing is the finest kind of sport
to encourage."—Cornell.
"The cleanest sport in the whole
college group and a game that can be
carried into later life." —M.I.T.
"Feel that rowing is one of the
finest of college sports."—Syracuse.
"On a par with any of the major
sports. Produces real men." —U. of W.

of equipment necessary to begin this
sport at $10,000, excluding a boat
house, which may be built for $5,000
on up.
As to the question of manpower
California and Wisconsin, the two
universities with the largest number
of men in their student bodies, have
the smallest turnouts. Only 100 candi
dates, including oarsmen, coxswain,
and managers, turn out at California.
Wisconsin also has a small turnout
mainly because they have no inter
collegiate competition unless a trip is
made to Poughkeepsie. Here the situ
ation is different. Stanford would
have at least two coast teams for
competitors in this sport.
At Harvard, where crew is as much
an intramural sport as an intercolle
giate sport, there is an average turn
out of 800 men. Other eastern col
leges have from 200 to 350 men out.
The majority of the nine universities
also look upon this sport as being on
a par with football and track.
The following comments were vol
untarily made by general managers
to whom the questionnaire was sent.
"Where any college is so situated as
to have boating facilities readily avail
able rowing is the finest kind of sport
to encourage."—Cornell.
"The cleanest sport in the whole
college group and a game that can be
carried into later life." —M.I.T.
"Feel that rowing is one of the
finest of college sports."—Syracuse.
"On a par with any of the major
sports. Produces real men." —U. of W.
Climaxing an intensive study of the
•crew situation, the Daily today is giv
ing definite figures and information on
the cost, upkeep, and other details as
regards this sport at nine representa
tive colleges in the United States.
The colleges to whom the question
naire was sent were: University of
California, Cornell, Harvard, Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, Syracuse,
University of Washington, Wisconsin,
and Yale.
The question of installation costs
and upkeep were intricately covered,
as this has been one of the main
points stressed by those who oppose
this sport. Although crew was found
to be a deficit in every case as far as
finances were concerned, the univer
sities that sponsor it believe that they
are justified in continuing it on its
merits.
Harvard spends more than any
other university, $75,000 annually, on
this sport, and feels that it is worth
while. To quote William J. Bingham,
director of athletics at that institu
tion, "Rowing has been a sport at
Harvard since 1850. At the present
time we have 107 shells. Crew is one
of the most popular sports here and
it costs our athletic board about
475,000 a year for everything. With
so many men using our equipment
we feel justified in spending this
amount of money and we have had
as many as forty-three eights on the
river at one time."
Yale is second with an annual ex
pense of approximately $G5,000, while
the third highest, Pennsylvania, drops
to $32,000. The remaining six uni
versities spend from $10,000 to $23,000
per year. Harvard, Yale, and Pennsyl
vania are extremely high in their
figures as the costs quoted by the
other six prove. These prices in most
cases cover the cost of a training
table over a period of two to two and
one-half months which involve an ex
penditure of from $2500 to $4000.
Having accumulated their equip
ment over a period of years, none of
the crew directors could give any fig
ures as to the exact cost of establish
ing the sport. Although Romeyn
Berry, graduate manager at Cornell
University, gave the value of equip
ment there as $43,000, he also stated
that this sport might be established
at a much lower figure. "Our plant
has grown gradually over a period of
fifty years. Ten thousand dollars
ought to cover the necessary equip
ment actually needed to start row
ing."
California also estimated the cost
of equipment necessary to begin this
sport at $10,000, excluding a boat

on up.

so many men using our equipment
we feel justified in spending this
amount of money and we have had
as many as forty-three eights on the
river at one time."
Yale is second with an annual ex
pense of approximately $G5,000, while
the third highest, Pennsylvania, drops
to $32,000. The remaining six uni
versities spend from $10,000 to $23,000
per year. Harvard, Yale, and Pennsyl
vania are extremely high in their
figures as the costs quoted by the
other six prove. These prices in most
cases cover the cost of a training
table over a period of two to two and
one-half months which involve an ex
penditure of from $2500 to $4000.
Having accumulated their equip
ment over a period of years, none of
the crew directors could give any fig
ures as to the exact cost of establish
ing the sport. Although Romeyn
Berry, graduate manager at Cornell
University, gave the value of equip
ment there as $43,000, he also stated
that this sport might be established
at a much lower figure. "Our plant
has grown gradually over a period of
fifty years. Ten thousand dollars
ought to cover the necessary equip
ment actually needed to start row
ing."
California also estimated the cost
of equipment necessary to begin this
sport at $10,000, excluding a boat
house, which may be built for $5,000
on up.
As to the question of manpower
California and Wisconsin, the two
universities with the largest number
of men in their student bodies, have
the smallest turnouts. Only 100 candi
dates, including oarsmen, coxswain,
and managers, turn out at California.
Wisconsin also has a small turnout
mainly because they have no inter
collegiate competition unless a trip is
made to Poughkeepsie. Here the situ
ation is different. Stanford would
have at least two coast teams for
competitors in this sport.
At Harvard, where crew is as much
an intramural sport as an intercolle
giate sport, there is an average turn
out of 800 men. Other eastern col
leges have from 200 to 350 men out.
The majority of the nine universities
also look upon this sport as being on
a par with football and track.
The following comments were vol
untarily made by general managers
to whom the questionnaire was sent.
"Where any college is so situated as
to have boating facilities readily avail
able rowing is the finest kind of sport
to encourage."—Cornell.
"The cleanest sport in the whole
college group and a game that can be
carried into later life." —M.I.T.
"Feel that rowing is one of the
finest of college sports."—Syracuse.
"On a par with any of the major
sports. Produces real men." —U. of W.
