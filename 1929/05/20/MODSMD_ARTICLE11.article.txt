# TWO FLIERS TRY TO SET NEW RECORD
## Attempt to Break Refueling Endurance Record of Army Monoplane 
### 
FORT WORTH, Texas, May 19. (Jp)
—Two commercial fliers took a re
built Ryan Brougham airplane into
the air here at 11:33 o'clock this
morning on an attempt to break the
refueling endurance record estab
lished by the army monoplane Ques
tion Mark on the Pacific Coast sev
eral months ago. The plane, piloted
by Reg. L. Robbins, with Jim Kelly as
co-pilot, carries a single motor, where
as the Question Mark was tri-motored.
The takeoff was made at Meacham
Field.
The endurance plane, christened
"Fort Worth," was entirely rebuilt
for the record attempt. Refueling is
planned to be made once daily. The
ship took off with 250 gallons of gaso
line and will take on 100 gallons every
24 hours of the flight.
The dual control will be operated
by Robbins while the ship is being re
fueled. Kelly will handle the refuel
ing hose to be dropped by another
ship. The pipe into which the hose
will fit has been fitted into the side
of the plane instead of in the center
as was done on the Question Mark.
Capt. W. T. Ponder, World War air
veteran, who flew for France before
the United States entered the war,
will pilot the refuelling plane, also a
Ryan.
To break the record, the fliers must
remain in the air until Saturday night.
The initial refueling of the plane,
which was christened "Fort Worth,"
will be ready tomorrow morning.
