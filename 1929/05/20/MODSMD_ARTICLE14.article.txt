# CARD TRACK TEAM UNOFFICIAL WINNER OF LOS ANGELES MEET
## Vexatious Problem Facing 3 California Contenders to Philadelphia I.C.-4A. Is Hand Rest Use 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May 19.
fornia's Big Three universities —Stan-
ford, Southern California, and Cali
fornia —today are preparing to send
powerful contenders for individual
laurels on the field and track to the
Philadelphia I.C.A.A.A.A. late this
month —and also a vexatious problem.
The problem was an outgrowth of
yesterday's first annual California in
tercollegiate meet. "Are wooden
blocks held to the ground by short
spikes and used principally as hand
rests in starting the sprints and spar
ingly as foot braces outlawed under
the rule against the use of mechanical
aids in starting?"
To this question Dink Templeton,
Stanford coach, who allowed his team
members to use the blocks in spite
of their disqualification by Kinter
Hamilton, referee, answered "No."
But Dean Cromwell, S.C. coach, an
swered "Yes."
Robert S. Weaver, Chairman of the
Southern Pacific Association of the
A.S.U., agreed with Hamilton and
Cromwell.
Although Templeton said he would
not appeal the decision of Hamilton
on his "invention" he intimated he
was satisfied with "official second
place in the meet" in spite of "an
unofficial win." He declared he would
allow his "boys to use the blocks at
Philadelphia if they thought they were
helps." He admitted their use was an
experiment. Cromwell expressed a
first belief that Templeton's stars
would "not be allowed on the track
at Philadelphia if they attempt to use
the blocks."
That is the problem California's Big
Three will present to the 1.C.4-A.
