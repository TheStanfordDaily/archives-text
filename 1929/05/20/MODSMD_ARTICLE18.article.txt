# Varsity Is Technically Only Second Place Finisher in Southern Division of P.C.C. on Saturday
## 
### Frank Whiteley 
Stanford's varsity track team re
turned to the campus yesterday, ac
tually the winner of the Pacific Coast
Conference Championships, southern
division, in Los Angeles Saturday by
a score of 71% points to U.S.C.'s 58,
but technically only second-place win
ner with 46 points to Southern Cali
fornia's 71%. Nobody seems to be
quite certain as to what toam really
won the meet.
The mix-up began when Coach Dink
Templeton produced an innovation in
California track in the form of some
small wooden blocks to be used by
his runners as hand rests at starting.
Dink insisted that the blocks be used
since eastern runners use such blocks
as foot braces; Coach Dean Cromwell
of the Trojans was just as insistent
that the blocks not be used. Referee
Kinter Hamilton upheld Cromwell's
ODjection, and use of the blocks was
declared to be illegal. The result was
that the blocks were used, and as each
Stanford runner finished he was dis
qualified.
Score Protested
The announced score, widely pro
tested by the spectators, was U.S.C.
Stanford 46; California 30; and
U.C.L.A. 8%.
Forgetting the farcial nature of the
meet and considering only the per
formances made, it will be found that
the afternoon's entertainment in the
L.A. Coliseum turned out to be a
splendid track and field exhibition.
First, there are the two new inter
collegiate records. Harlow Rothert,
Templeton's "foot-a-week" shot putter,
heaved the 16-pound ball 51 feet 1%
inches to better his own American
intercollegiate record of 51 feet Vz
inch. Captain Curtice of California
was the other record-breaker with a
javelin throw of 209 feet 9% inches.
Edmonds High-Point Man
Ward Edmonds again was high-point
man of the day, taking one first and
tying for two others to give him a
final total of thirteen points. Ward
vaulted his usual 13 feet 6 inches to
tie with Jack Williams of U.S.C., won
the high hurdles in 15 s. fiat when
Captain Ross Nichols fell, and then
came through to finish the 220-yard
low hurdles in a dead heat with Jim
mie Payne of the Trojans in 23 2-5 s.
This latter mark equals Steve Ander
son's Pacific Coast record and con
clusively proves that Edmonds is one
of the greatest hurdlers ever devel
oped at Stanford.
Alex McKinnon has time after time
this year come up from behind with
a great finishing sprint to win the
mile or half-mile; and he ran true to
form Saturday, beating Schurr of
U.S.C. to the tape in the eight-eighty
by a yard, the time being 1:58.
Dyer Wins 220-Yard Dash
The blocks didn't seem to help Hec
Dyer particularly in the hundred, and
Maurer of the Trojans won the shorter
sprint by Inches. Dyer came back in
the two-twenty to run the best race
of his career and win by four yards
in 21 2-5 s.
Then there is Johnny Morrison's
48 2-5 second lap in the quarter-mile
among the outstanding marks of the
day. This Is Morrison's best time this
year and is the fastest recorded on
the Pacific Coast during the present
season. Johnny secured the lead at
the start and was never headed by
Vic Williams of U.S.C.
Eric Krenz was not in top form but
had little difficulty in winning the
discus with a throw of 152 feet 4 2-5
inches.
Madison, Cardinal high-jumper, sur
prised everyone by clearing a height
of G feet I*4 inches to take first place.

formances made, it will be found that
the afternoon's entertainment in the
L.A. Coliseum turned out to be a
splendid track and field exhibition.
First, there are the two new inter
collegiate records. Harlow Rothert,
Templeton's "foot-a-week" shot putter,
heaved the 16-pound ball 51 feet 1%
inches to better his own American
intercollegiate record of 51 feet Vz
inch. Captain Curtice of California
was the other record-breaker with a
javelin throw of 209 feet 9% inches.
Edmonds High-Point Man
Ward Edmonds again was high-point
man of the day, taking one first and
tying for two others to give him a
final total of thirteen points. Ward
vaulted his usual 13 feet 6 inches to
tie with Jack Williams of U.S.C., won
the high hurdles in 15 s. fiat when
Captain Ross Nichols fell, and then
came through to finish the 220-yard
low hurdles in a dead heat with Jim
mie Payne of the Trojans in 23 2-5 s.
This latter mark equals Steve Ander
son's Pacific Coast record and con
clusively proves that Edmonds is one
of the greatest hurdlers ever devel
oped at Stanford.
Alex McKinnon has time after time
this year come up from behind with
a great finishing sprint to win the
mile or half-mile; and he ran true to
form Saturday, beating Schurr of
U.S.C. to the tape in the eight-eighty
by a yard, the time being 1:58.
Dyer Wins 220-Yard Dash
The blocks didn't seem to help Hec
Dyer particularly in the hundred, and
Maurer of the Trojans won the shorter
sprint by Inches. Dyer came back in
the two-twenty to run the best race
of his career and win by four yards
in 21 2-5 s.
Then there is Johnny Morrison's
48 2-5 second lap in the quarter-mile
among the outstanding marks of the
day. This Is Morrison's best time this
year and is the fastest recorded on
the Pacific Coast during the present
season. Johnny secured the lead at
the start and was never headed by
Vic Williams of U.S.C.
Eric Krenz was not in top form but
had little difficulty in winning the
discus with a throw of 152 feet 4 2-5
inches.
Madison, Cardinal high-jumper, sur
prised everyone by clearing a height
of G feet I*4 inches to take first place.

Stanford's varsity track team re
turned to the campus yesterday, ac
tually the winner of the Pacific Coast
Conference Championships, southern
division, in Los Angeles Saturday by
a score of 71% points to U.S.C.'s 58,
but technically only second-place win
ner with 46 points to Southern Cali
fornia's 71%. Nobody seems to be
quite certain as to what toam really
won the meet.
The mix-up began when Coach Dink
Templeton produced an innovation in
California track in the form of some
small wooden blocks to be used by
his runners as hand rests at starting.
Dink insisted that the blocks be used
since eastern runners use such blocks
as foot braces; Coach Dean Cromwell
of the Trojans was just as insistent
that the blocks not be used. Referee
Kinter Hamilton upheld Cromwell's
ODjection, and use of the blocks was
declared to be illegal. The result was
that the blocks were used, and as each
Stanford runner finished he was dis
qualified.

The announced score, widely pro

Stanford's varsity track team re
turned to the campus yesterday, ac
tually the winner of the Pacific Coast
Conference Championships, southern
division, in Los Angeles Saturday by
a score of 71% points to U.S.C.'s 58,
but technically only second-place win
ner with 46 points to Southern Cali
fornia's 71%. Nobody seems to be
quite certain as to what toam really
won the meet.
The mix-up began when Coach Dink
Templeton produced an innovation in
California track in the form of some
small wooden blocks to be used by
his runners as hand rests at starting.
Dink insisted that the blocks be used
since eastern runners use such blocks
as foot braces; Coach Dean Cromwell
of the Trojans was just as insistent
that the blocks not be used. Referee
Kinter Hamilton upheld Cromwell's
ODjection, and use of the blocks was
declared to be illegal. The result was
that the blocks were used, and as each
Stanford runner finished he was dis
qualified.
Score Protested
The announced score, widely pro
tested by the spectators, was U.S.C.
Stanford 46; California 30; and
U.C.L.A. 8%.
Forgetting the farcial nature of the
meet and considering only the per
formances made, it will be found that
the afternoon's entertainment in the
L.A. Coliseum turned out to be a
splendid track and field exhibition.
First, there are the two new inter
collegiate records. Harlow Rothert,
Templeton's "foot-a-week" shot putter,
heaved the 16-pound ball 51 feet 1%
inches to better his own American
intercollegiate record of 51 feet Vz
inch. Captain Curtice of California
was the other record-breaker with a
javelin throw of 209 feet 9% inches.
Edmonds High-Point Man
Ward Edmonds again was high-point
man of the day, taking one first and
tying for two others to give him a
final total of thirteen points. Ward
vaulted his usual 13 feet 6 inches to
tie with Jack Williams of U.S.C., won
the high hurdles in 15 s. fiat when
Captain Ross Nichols fell, and then
came through to finish the 220-yard
low hurdles in a dead heat with Jim
mie Payne of the Trojans in 23 2-5 s.
This latter mark equals Steve Ander
son's Pacific Coast record and con
clusively proves that Edmonds is one
of the greatest hurdlers ever devel
oped at Stanford.
Alex McKinnon has time after time

Stanford's varsity track team re
turned to the campus yesterday, ac
tually the winner of the Pacific Coast
Conference Championships, southern
division, in Los Angeles Saturday by
a score of 71% points to U.S.C.'s 58,
but technically only second-place win
ner with 46 points to Southern Cali
fornia's 71%. Nobody seems to be
quite certain as to what toam really
won the meet.
The mix-up began when Coach Dink
Templeton produced an innovation in
California track in the form of some
small wooden blocks to be used by
his runners as hand rests at starting.
Dink insisted that the blocks be used
since eastern runners use such blocks
as foot braces; Coach Dean Cromwell
of the Trojans was just as insistent
that the blocks not be used. Referee
Kinter Hamilton upheld Cromwell's
ODjection, and use of the blocks was
declared to be illegal. The result was
that the blocks were used, and as each
Stanford runner finished he was dis
qualified.
Score Protested
The announced score, widely pro
tested by the spectators, was U.S.C.
Stanford 46; California 30; and
U.C.L.A. 8%.
Forgetting the farcial nature of the
meet and considering only the per
formances made, it will be found that
the afternoon's entertainment in the
L.A. Coliseum turned out to be a
splendid track and field exhibition.
First, there are the two new inter
collegiate records. Harlow Rothert,
Templeton's "foot-a-week" shot putter,
heaved the 16-pound ball 51 feet 1%
inches to better his own American
intercollegiate record of 51 feet Vz
inch. Captain Curtice of California
was the other record-breaker with a
javelin throw of 209 feet 9% inches.
Edmonds High-Point Man
Ward Edmonds again was high-point
man of the day, taking one first and
tying for two others to give him a
final total of thirteen points. Ward
vaulted his usual 13 feet 6 inches to
tie with Jack Williams of U.S.C., won
the high hurdles in 15 s. fiat when
Captain Ross Nichols fell, and then
came through to finish the 220-yard
low hurdles in a dead heat with Jim
mie Payne of the Trojans in 23 2-5 s.
This latter mark equals Steve Ander
son's Pacific Coast record and con
clusively proves that Edmonds is one
of the greatest hurdlers ever devel
oped at Stanford.
Alex McKinnon has time after time
this year come up from behind with
a great finishing sprint to win the
mile or half-mile; and he ran true to
form Saturday, beating Schurr of
U.S.C. to the tape in the eight-eighty
by a yard, the time being 1:58.
Dyer Wins 220-Yard Dash
The blocks didn't seem to help Hec
Dyer particularly in the hundred, and
Maurer of the Trojans won the shorter
sprint by Inches. Dyer came back in
the two-twenty to run the best race
of his career and win by four yards
in 21 2-5 s.
Then there is Johnny Morrison's
48 2-5 second lap in the quarter-mile
among the outstanding marks of the
day. This Is Morrison's best time this
year and is the fastest recorded on
the Pacific Coast during the present
season. Johnny secured the lead at
the start and was never headed by
Vic Williams of U.S.C.
Eric Krenz was not in top form but
had little difficulty in winning the
discus with a throw of 152 feet 4 2-5
inches.
Madison, Cardinal high-jumper, sur
prised everyone by clearing a height
of G feet I*4 inches to take first place.
Following is a summary of the
meet:
