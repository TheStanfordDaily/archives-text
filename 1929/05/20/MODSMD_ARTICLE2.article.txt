# FORMER CARD CREW CAPTAIN HOPES FOR RENEWAL OF SPORT
## 
### 
The following wire was re
ceived yesterday from R. H.
Seward, captain of Stanford's
1912 crew. His sentiments in re
gard to this great sport exempli
fy those of other alumni inter
ested in crew with whom the
Daily has communicated:
Stanford Daily,
Stanford University,
California.
Am heartily in favor of re
establishment of rowing at Stan
ford Expense should not be pro
hibitive as other colleges with no
greater revenues support crew.
In 1910, crew was discontinued
as intercollegiate sport but crew
men kept rowing alive by pay
ing their own expenses. Senti
ment of many old Stanford men
that this great sport should be
brought back. Believe that a rea
sonable diversification in sports
is essential to the continued life
of those great sports which now
receive so much justified support.
R. H. Seward, '12.
