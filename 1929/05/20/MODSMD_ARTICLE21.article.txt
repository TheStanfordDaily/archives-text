# Crew, A Popular Sport
## 
### 
The Daily in its investigation of crew has found two outstanding
things: first, that immediate and enthusiastic response was gained from
every university queried in the matter; second, the same sort of response
was gained from alumni who were here when crew was a Stanford sport.
Cost, manpower, and facilities, these are the three arguments put forth
against the return of crew. The Daily has presented a cost estimate that
is within reason verified by rowing authorities..
The matter of manpower is one not only facing a possible crew squad
but every sport. If Stanford wishes to maintain its present eminence in
intercollegiate sport, this little matter of manpower will become a problem
far more grave than whether or not there are enough men to produce a
worthwhile squad. But that is not to be considered now. With the men
that are here a crew squad could be organized without cutting into other
sports. Crew coaches have pointed to the fact that crew men are not the
type that enters other sports.
And the final point, facilities, has been met by the fact that within
nine miles is a fine course with contiguous reasonably priced land for a
boathouse site.
The possibility of the return of crew rests very much with the
opinion of the student body. Tomorrow the student body will have an
opportunity of expressing this opinion. If it decides against it, the
matter will have been definitely closed for all times. If it decides in
favor, the cause will be greatly furthered.
