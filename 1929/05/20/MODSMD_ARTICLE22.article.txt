# Chief Justice Taft on College Men
## 
### 
Chief Justice Taft of the Supreme Court, at one of those gatherings
where sentimental old grads get together and weep on one another's
shoulders over the "golden haze of college days," uttered a profound bit
of wisdom, a profound bit with a barb to it that should dig into the
nonchalant youth who now make up the American student class. Said
Justice Taft, "When a man grows as old as I have, he then feels like
resorting to profanity as he ought not to do at the misconception of life
and the use of education and the use of universities by these feather
headed young men that don't look ahead to know the opportunities they
have and to appreciate those opportunities."
Careful investigation by a score of research workers, a battery of
survey takers, no end of questionnaire collectors' reveals the amazing fact
that if every student attending Stanford were to consolidate the actual
working hours of a college career into an eight-hour day schedule he
could boil down the four years to one year of intensive work.
Now the Daily doesn't advocate such a slave-driving schedule but
it does stop and ruminate over the matter. What sort of citizens will
these college students make when they get out and have to spend eight
hours or more behind roll-top desks? Will this easy-going life have been
such fine preparation for the hard work that will come?
Chief Justice Taft called college attendance by many students "for
social reasons," and "to establish themselves by reason of the fact that
they are called college men" "a dreadful waste."
To those who attend the university and gain no more than a "mis
conception of life," "social" advantages, and that mystic brand "a college
man," the four years are worthless. But the question is raised wouldn't
those same individuals waste those same four years outside of college
as readily as they waste them in college?
It more or less resolves itself to the matter of individual personality.
If the young man has the stuff in him to accomplish something, to make
the most of his life, he'll do it without benefit of college as well as he
will with it. College will have been a useful instrument with which he
will have been able to have carved his way a little more quickly and more
easily, but it will not have been the guarantee of success.
