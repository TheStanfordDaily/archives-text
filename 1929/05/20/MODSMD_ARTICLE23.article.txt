# "Well Done, Men"
## 
### 
Today's news columns carry the announcements of the promotions on
the Business Staff of the Daily. These people have worked hard and
long during the past year, and because of their good work they have won
their promotions. Theirs are tasks which receive little praise from those
not connected with the Dialy, hut tasks which, were they not performed,
would render efficient publication impossible.
Congratulations! May Volume 76 prosper under your leadership.
