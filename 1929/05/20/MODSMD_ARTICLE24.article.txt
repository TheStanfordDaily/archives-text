The Book of Bette, by Eleanor Mer
cein. (New York: Harper &
Brothers. 1929.)
"The Book of Bette," following so
closely on the heels of "Basquerie" is
surprisingly fresh and full of charm
for the second of what may become a
regular series of novels claiming the
same romantic setting, the Basque.
"Basquerie," which achieved such a
far-reaching popularity upon its pub
lication, dealt with Esteban, a Basque,
and his wife Emilie, an American. The
new book follows the events in the
life of Bette, Estehan's young sister,
during her bridal quest. The books are
unmistakably linked together, are
particularly interesting when read in
order, but lose nothing of either story
or background when read separately.
Eleanor Mercein, Mrs. Kelly, has
made this country with its people, its
ideals, standards, and life seem so
fascinating that often the plot, in
contrast to the descriptions and side
lights on Basque-ways, pales into in
significance. Still the characters are
real people, and act definitely. There
is nothing undecided about any of
them!
The Urruty family is undeniable
entertaining. There is the matriarch,
elderly grand'mere and undisputed
wielder of sway in the household,
who, although most severe in outward
appearances, had at one time been
quite a belle of old Spain herself, and
who still retains the memory of it.
Emilie, American wife of Esteban,
with her new world ideas in the very
midst of old set ways and aged super
stitions, is one of the more colorful
characters.
Hasul Chavas, noted violinist, tem
peramental, living with a band of
wandering gypsies, slips in and out
of the story, lending a bit of intrigue.
John de Maytie, son of the exotic
Pilar, danseuse, artiste, beloved of
many, plays twice the part in the life

of Bette that could have been ex
pected from first descriptions.
Bette herself is a very definite per
son. A Basque at heart, consciously in
fluenced by her sister-in-law, is a
starry-eyed dreamer, and at the same
time a clear-sighted, practical young
woman. The plot centers around a
trip across the Pyrenees to the Span
ish side. Accompanied by the entire
family, Bette is taken to Castille to
become the wife of one of the two
sons of a Duke, once the acknowl
edged suitor of the Matriarch.
In Castillo is found all the romance
of the times. "Bells wildly pealing;
dancing, dancing everywhere, in the
streets, at the very altar, where the
"seizes," in honor of the risen Christ,
perform their ancient stately measure
to the sharp-rattle of castanets; the
Easter bullfight, a great garden of
carnations, roses, jasmine, worn in
the women's hair; lovers whispering
in the darkness; beautiful ladies, al
ways with flowers in their tall combs,
driving along the Paseo de las Delicas
—loveliest of avenues —in open, flower
decked carriages, attended by gallants
on Andalusian stallions, dressed in
long, tight-fitting trousers and open
boleros and wide, high-topped hats
with bands beneath the chin." It is a
man's world, this Spanish peninsula,
with its bullfights and picadors, its
arenas, where in days past to "torear
a cavello" was the sport of gentlemen!
A charming, though sometimes sub
merged plot, gripping descriptions of
simple home-life among a simple peo
ple, the strange windings of fate bind
ing the Basque and the gypsy, a di
verting tang of America in the old
world, and a delightful Bette, heeding
the call of the trail, and following the
"road away," make "The Book of
Bette" one of the most worthwhile
books reviewed in a long time. It is a
book to be enthusiastic about, for
pleasurable reading. Read it yourself!
