# ALTERATIONS TO CONVERT CELLAR, STORE INTO UNIT
## 
### 
"The Roost," traditional gathering
place of Stanford roughs, is no more.
Plans for the merging of the Union
Store and the Cellar into one operat
ing unit are now being carried out,
with extensive alterations scheduled
for the summer months.
During the revision of the lower
floors of the Old Union building, the
Store will be operated in temporary
quarters in one corner of the present
Cellar, while "Roost" fountain service
will be taken over by the Cellar.
For some time the Union Board of
Governors has been contemplating
changes in the building and stores in
order to make the place more ideal
for the gathering of student organi
zations, reducing operating costs, and
affording better service for student
patrons.
Official sanction for the proposed
changes was given by the Board at
a meeting held Wednesday and the
work of making temporary arrange
ments for the continuation of the
service of the two stores in the Cellar
section was started Saturday morn
ing.
Service will be continued in the
Cellar section of the building this
morning as usual when the combined
sales organizations take over their
duties in the temporary quarters pro
vided over the week-end.
The plans call for the completion
of the alterations and the opening of
the new unit by September 15.
When the revision of the building
is completed, the present Union Store
and the Cellar will be combined into
one large "L"-shaped room with a
large fountain occupying the center
of the space around which fifty seats
will be provided.
Lounging Place
In order to make this merger, it
will be necessary to excavate the sec
tion now occupied by the Store down
to the level of the Cellar. The men's
dressing room will occupy the space
across the hall from the present lo
cation, while the shoe shop will be
placed in a room to be constructed
in the southern end of the present
store.
The final location of the Union
Store will be about where the south
ern part of the Cellar kitchen now
is situated. In front of the store
counters will be provided a lounging
place supplied with periodicals and
newspapers and appropriately fur
nished.
When the reconstruction is com
pleted in September, both fountain
and booth service will be available
in one place, the booths being ar
ranged around the wall as they now
are, while the store will be nearby in
the same room.
