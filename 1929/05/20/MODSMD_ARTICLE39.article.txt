In the air races held at Santa Rosa
yesterday and Saturday, Lieutenant
Norman A. Goddard of the Palo Alto
Flying School won two first places
and one second. The event was one
of a series of similar contests held
this year at various airports through
out the state. Skill in manoueverlng
and making turns are considered as
factors, as well as speed. The second
place was in the dead stick landing
contest, in which the plane is landed
to a mark with the motor stopped.

A barking dog led police to the body
of his master in Auburn, N.Y.
