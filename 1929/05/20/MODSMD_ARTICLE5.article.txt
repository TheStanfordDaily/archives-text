In a fast and hotly contested game

State polo four defeated a fighting
Cardinal team seven goals to two in
the final contest of a two-game series.

championship.
The only serious accident of either
tilt occurred in the first few minutes
of the first period when Jack Dill's
mount twisted and broke its leg on
a quick turn and had to be taken
from the field. A moment later Bill
McGinnis took the ball the length of
the field for the first Oregon score.
Stanford took the ball on the throw
in, and relayed it down the field to
even the score when Revell backed
the ball between the posts. Just be
fore the end of the period, Boeseke
accounted for the second O.S.C. tally
after Clinton had set the ball up in
front of the goal.
A goal by McGinnis early in the
second chukker was the only score
of the period.
The third chukker was all in favor
of the Cards. Revell scored after good
teamwork had placed the ball within
striking distance of the goal, and the
Oregon team was on the defensive for
the remainder of the time.
The rest of the game showed the
real power of the Oregon team, which
threatened the Stanford goal repeat
edly, scoring once in the fourth and
fifth cliukkers and twice in the sixth.
Bodmer at number 2 led the Ore
gon offensive, and Boeseke at back
played an airtight defensive game be
sides scoring two goals.
Revell, Gorliam, and Dill, of the
Stanford squad, all played a creditable
game.

In a fast and hotly contested game
played Saturday afternoon on the En
cina field the well-balanced Oregon
State polo four defeated a fighting
Cardinal team seven goals to two in
the final contest of a two-game series.
By winning this game—which was
much closer than the score indicates,
the play being confined to the middle
of the field most of the time —the
Orangemen established their claim to
the Pacific Coast collegiate polo
championship.
The only serious accident of either
tilt occurred in the first few minutes
of the first period when Jack Dill's
mount twisted and broke its leg on
a quick turn and had to be taken
from the field. A moment later Bill
McGinnis took the ball the length of
the field for the first Oregon score.
Stanford took the ball on the throw
in, and relayed it down the field to
even the score when Revell backed
the ball between the posts. Just be
fore the end of the period, Boeseke
accounted for the second O.S.C. tally
after Clinton had set the ball up in
front of the goal.
A goal by McGinnis early in the
second chukker was the only score
of the period.
The third chukker was all in favor
of the Cards. Revell scored after good
teamwork had placed the ball within
striking distance of the goal, and the
Oregon team was on the defensive for
the remainder of the time.
The rest of the game showed the
real power of the Oregon team, which
threatened the Stanford goal repeat
edly, scoring once in the fourth and
fifth cliukkers and twice in the sixth.
Bodmer at number 2 led the Ore
gon offensive, and Boeseke at back
played an airtight defensive game be
sides scoring two goals.
Revell, Gorliam, and Dill, of the
Stanford squad, all played a creditable
game.
The lineups: Oregon —1. McGinnis
(2), 2. Bodmer (2), 3. Clinton (1),
4. Boeseke (2). Stanford —1. Short
ridge, 2. Revell (2), 2. Cox, 3. Gorham,
4. Dill.
