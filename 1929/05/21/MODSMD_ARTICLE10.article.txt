# GUERARD TO DISCUSS "FRANCE REVISITED" IN LECTURE TONIGHT
## 
### 
"France Revisited" will be the sub
ject of a talk by Professor Albert
Guerard, lecturer in general literature,
to be given in the Assembly Hall to
night at 7:30 o'clock.
Having recently spent nine months
in that country, he will tell of his trip
from the viewpoint of one who seeks
to insure for future generations, in
the face of economic and social neces
sity, adequate historical and artistic
records of past achievements. During
his stay in Paris he studied the monu
ments and buildings of Paris, par
ticularly noting the problem of the
extension of the city. Professor Guer
ard, in his recent book "The Future
of Paris," expresses in this connection
his disbelief in any great danger of
congestion in the capitol, because of
the French indifference toward con
centration of business.
Professor Guerard will also discuss
French political conditions, and tell
something of his stay in Alsace-Lor
raine and in Switzerland.
