# 'ALL-CALIFORNIA' DEBATING TOUR IS ASSURED
## 
### 
Definite arrangements have been
completed for an eastern tour of the
All-California debate team, to be com
posed of one man from each of Cali
fornia's three leading universities —
Stanford, University of Southern Cali
fornia, and University of California.
Southern California's executive
body has given official approval to the
plan, according to Steve Halsted, Stan
ford manager, who returned yesterday
from a conference with the Trojan
debate officials. Stanford's part in the
trip was made definite when the Ex
Committee made the necessary appro
priation on May 7. The University of
California debate manager has ex
pressed keen interest in the trip, ac
cording to Halsted, and the Bears'
participation only awaits definite ac
tion by the executive body when Cali
fornia opens in August.
The men will meet on the Stanford
campus during the latter part of De
cember, according to present plans,
from where they will start on the tour
after several days of intensive pre
paration with the three coaches. They
will return to Los Angeles about Feb
ruary 10.
It is probable that no debates can
be scheduled definitely till next fall,
but present plans call for the team's
meeting twenty or twenty-five colleges
on the trip. The probable itinerary
will route the men first through the
Northwest, where institutions in Ore
gon and Washington will be met.
Starting east from there, the team
will debate various colleges in the
Middlewest and then go north to Mon
treal and Toronto. The most intensive
days of the tour will be on the Atlan
tic coast, where it is hoped that de
bates will be scheduled with all the
larger universities. The return to Los
Angeles will probably be through the
southern part of the country.
Leo Adams, present debate man
ager at U.S.C. and president of the
student body for next year, has been
chosen definitely as manager of the
trip. Each of the three universities
will contribute $300 to finance the
tour. Three or four questions will be
prepared, preferably on subjects with
which the eastern colleges will be
familiar.

tion by the executive body when Cali
fornia opens in August.
The men will meet on the Stanford
campus during the latter part of De
cember, according to present plans,
from where they will start on the tour
after several days of intensive pre
paration with the three coaches. They
will return to Los Angeles about Feb
ruary 10.
It is probable that no debates can
be scheduled definitely till next fall,
but present plans call for the team's
meeting twenty or twenty-five colleges
on the trip. The probable itinerary
will route the men first through the
Northwest, where institutions in Ore
gon and Washington will be met.
Starting east from there, the team
will debate various colleges in the
Middlewest and then go north to Mon
treal and Toronto. The most intensive
days of the tour will be on the Atlan
tic coast, where it is hoped that de
bates will be scheduled with all the
larger universities. The return to Los
Angeles will probably be through the
southern part of the country.
Leo Adams, present debate man
ager at U.S.C. and president of the
student body for next year, has been
chosen definitely as manager of the
trip. Each of the three universities
will contribute $300 to finance the
tour. Three or four questions will be
prepared, preferably on subjects with
which the eastern colleges will be
familiar.
