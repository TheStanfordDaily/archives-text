# SUPREME COURT VERDICT FAVORS O'FALLON CLAIM
## Decision Impairs Work of Interstate Commission In Rate Making 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20. (#>)â€”' The
result of years of labor by the Inter
state Commerce Commission in valu
ing railroads for rate-making and
other purposes was seriously impaired,
if not entirely swept aside today by
the Supreme Court.
The highest tribunal, dividing 5 to
3 with Justice Butler not participating,
held that the commission in its valua
tion work must observe such elements
as the present cost of construction or
reproduction.
There were also suggestions that
the application of the theory of con
trolling rates by estimating value of
railroad property and fixing them at
a point to give a reasonable return
might have been shown to be difficult
under the present law and its con
struction by the Supreme Court as to
induce Congress to consider new legis
lation. The view of commissioners ap
parently is that the present level of
rail rates is substantially at the most
practicable point and that rail car
riers generally would hardly be ex
pected to ask for general revision,
aside from the legal phases involved.
The commission decided to withhold
any public statement on the subject.
The controversy reached the
Supreme Court through an appeal by
the St. Louis and O'Fallon Railroad,
a nine-mile coal line in Southern
Illinois. It sought to have set aside an
order issued by the Interstate Com
merce Commission calling for a re
fund of a part of its earnings. Coming
under what is known as the recapture
clause of the transportation act, per
mitting railroads to retain one-half
of their earnings in excess of six per
ccnt., and requiring them to pay over
to the government the other half, the
case was based primarily on the valid
ity of the methods used by the com
mission in valuing railroad property.
