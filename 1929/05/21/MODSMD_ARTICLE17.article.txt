# OREGON DEFEATS CARD RACQUET TEAM AFTER TAKING COAST HONORS
## 
### 
After dividing honors in the Pacific
Coast Conference championships held
in Los Angeles last week-end, Stan
ford's varsity tennis team was yester
day afternoon defeated by the Oregon
net men, 4 matches to 2. John Doeg,
Stanford sophomore, won the singles
championship in the South, and Har
rison and Lockwood of Oregon won
the doubles.
Doeg and Harrison of Oregon
were the two players to reach
the finals of the singles, Doeg winning
6-3, G-4. The Stauford doubles team
of Doeg and Wheatley was defeated
in the finals by Harrison and Lock
wood.
In the matches yesterday Stanford
suffered from the loss of Chuck Wees
ner, who has taken out a leave of ab
sence. Doeg and Wheatley played an
excellent brand of tennis in winning
the first two singles matches, but the
remainder of the team failed to come
through. In the first doubles match,
where a Cardinal victory would have
tied the meet, Doeg and Hall led 5
to 2 in the third and deciding set but
were beaten out 9 to 7.
