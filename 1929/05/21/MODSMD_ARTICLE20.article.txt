# STUDENT BODY TO TAKE STAND TODAY ON QUESTION OF CREW
## Daily's Estimate of Cost of Racing Equipment Verified By Pocock, Shell Builder Ballot Will Contain Inquiry As to Possible Support of Rowing as Cardinal Sport 
### Anson Reeder 
Today is the day that the Stanford
student body will have its chance to
say whether it is desirous of reinstat
ing the most colorful of college sports
—crew.
Fourteen years ago at this time a
Cardinal crew practiced daily on the
old Redwood Creek seven miles from
here, preparing to meet the best that
the East had to offer. They had al
ready conquered the University of
California and Washington and hope
ran high on the campus with the pos
sibility of an Eastern victory and in
ternational fame.
Second at Poughkeepsie
Not many weeks later this same
eight travelled to Poughkeepsie and
placed a second in the regatta there
after trailing the field at the halfway
mark.
After that, due to a great extent to
the war, rowing dwindled in popular
ity. Finances were also instrumental
in its downfall, mainly because there
was not so great a revenue coming in
from other sports, and for that reason
no way to support it. But now that
Stanford has no legitimate excuses
to offer —for as the Daily's crew ques
tionnaire showed, what were difficul
ties a few years ago are not any
longer as they may now be overcomo
without a great degree of effort —this
great sport beckons for recognition.
Prestige and the advantages that the
greatest amateur sport has to offer
are not to be overlooked.
Daily Figures Authentic
As an interesting sidelight on the
situation, May 7 the Daily printed a
list of equipment necessary for re
establishing crew here. Since that
time there has been a great deal of
discussion as to the reliability of the
figures quoted as the cost of this
eqipment.
The figures in question were:
Barge—priced at $1100
Two shells at $1250 each 2500
Fifty new oars at $20 each.... 1000
Coaches' launch priced at 2500
In order that all doubt as to their
authenticity might be removed the
list was mailed to George Pocock and
Company, builders of the racing shells
used by the universities in this coun
try, for verification. The following
communication was received several
days ago:
To the Stanford Daily:
Your quotation of prices on rowing
equipment was entirely correct. While
the tendency of the cost of this equip
ment is upward owing to the growing
scarcity of excellent material that this
work requires, I can guarantee these
same prices will hold for at least
another year, and perhaps a good deal
longer.
We supplied Stanford with rowing
equipment years ago when she was
more often thought of as the big threat
and fear of the Eastern crews. The
sport writers in the East used to call
them the clumsy built Western shells
—now every university in America is
using them, including the great crews
of California and Columbia. Here's to
your success in reinstating crew the
eldest and only true amateur sport
left.
Very truly yours,
George Pocock.

Very truly yours,
George Pocock.
Today is the day that the Stanford
student body will have its chance to
say whether it is desirous of reinstat
ing the most colorful of college sports
—crew.
Fourteen years ago at this time a
Cardinal crew practiced daily on the
old Redwood Creek seven miles from
here, preparing to meet the best that
the East had to offer. They had al
ready conquered the University of
California and Washington and hope
ran high on the campus with the pos
sibility of an Eastern victory and in
ternational fame.
Second at Poughkeepsie
Not many weeks later this same
eight travelled to Poughkeepsie and
placed a second in the regatta there
after trailing the field at the halfway
mark.
After that, due to a great extent to
the war, rowing dwindled in popular
ity. Finances were also instrumental
in its downfall, mainly because there
was not so great a revenue coming in
from other sports, and for that reason
no way to support it. But now that
Stanford has no legitimate excuses
to offer —for as the Daily's crew ques
tionnaire showed, what were difficul
ties a few years ago are not any
longer as they may now be overcomo
without a great degree of effort —this
great sport beckons for recognition.
Prestige and the advantages that the
greatest amateur sport has to offer
are not to be overlooked.
Daily Figures Authentic
As an interesting sidelight on the
situation, May 7 the Daily printed a
list of equipment necessary for re
establishing crew here. Since that
time there has been a great deal of
discussion as to the reliability of the
figures quoted as the cost of this
eqipment.
The figures in question were:
Barge—priced at $1100
Two shells at $1250 each 2500
Fifty new oars at $20 each.... 1000
Coaches' launch priced at 2500
In order that all doubt as to their
authenticity might be removed the
list was mailed to George Pocock and
Company, builders of the racing shells
used by the universities in this coun
try, for verification. The following
communication was received several
days ago:
To the Stanford Daily:
Your quotation of prices on rowing
equipment was entirely correct. While
the tendency of the cost of this equip
ment is upward owing to the growing
scarcity of excellent material that this
work requires, I can guarantee these
same prices will hold for at least
another year, and perhaps a good deal
longer.
We supplied Stanford with rowing
equipment years ago when she was
more often thought of as the big threat
and fear of the Eastern crews. The
sport writers in the East used to call
them the clumsy built Western shells
—now every university in America is
using them, including the great crews
of California and Columbia. Here's to
your success in reinstating crew the
eldest and only true amateur sport
left.
Very truly yours,
George Pocock.
