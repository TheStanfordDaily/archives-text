# B.A.C. SENDS DAILY COMMUNICATION ON CREW RESTORATION
## 
### 
The following statement con
cerning the reinstatement of
crew at Stanford was received
yesterday by the Stanford Daily
from Don Llebendorfer, director
of the Board of Athletic Control
News Bureau:
"By adding crew to our already
full list of sports, we would be
dividing our interests and man
power. This would certainly
weaken other teams. The argu
ment that crew takes a different
type of man from other sports
will not hold water. The same
type of athletes who are needed
in football, basketball, baseball,
and in some track events is ne
cessary in crew.
"It is true that crew men are
not out for other sports in other
colleges, but the reason is
that practically all sports now
require work the year around.
Crew is all right in larger uni
versities where there are not
enough sports to give every man
a chance to make some team.
However, at Stanford, none of
our squads are overburdened
with material and the addition
of another sport, which was once
abandoned, would soon tell on
the other teams.
"Glenn S. ('Pop') Warner."
