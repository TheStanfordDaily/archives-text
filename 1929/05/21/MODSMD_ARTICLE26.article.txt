# Reinstate Crew
## 
### 
Ton years of intermittent consideration of the return of crew to
Stanford will find a definite summing up of that consideration today.
The student body will answer once and for all by ballot the question,
"Shall crew be reinstated?"
A strange entangling of interests and cross purposes has evolved
from the bringing of crew to the public gaze. First the Board of Athletic
Control reacted with a vigorous protest. Then by some mysterious means,
the women took up the cry, and crew became not a matter for ordinary
consideration, but a startling issue.
By a backhand method of reasoning, it was claimed that crew and
a new women's gymnasium do not mix, that one excludes the other. If
it were guaranteed that the defeat of crew would bring about the con
struction of a new women's gym, then there would be conclusive
grounds for a protest from the women at the Daily's effort to promote
a consideration of the matter. But there has been 110 guarantee, therefore
there is 110 ground for protest.
Coach Glenn S. (Pop) Warner, football mentor, in a communication
to the Daily, expresses his views 011 crew. It is a matter of manpower,
declares Coach Warner. If it is a matter of manpower, then it is a
purely Stanford difficulty and a potent argument against the elimination
of lower division. Not only the possible crew squads but football squads,
and squads in all other sports are going to suffer and suffer in the
extreme from the cutting of the lower division classes. The argument is
strong, assuming that the lower division will go, and its effect is not
merely going to be felt in as yet unmaterialized crew squads.
To place Stanford among a group of outstanding universities by
competition in one of the oldest and greatest sports, to give a major
sport to a type of student who would not otherwise take part in athletics,
to reinstate one of Stanford's one-time finest sports, the Daily urges the
favorable vote of the student body on today's ballot for the reinstatement
"of crew.
The editorial staff of the Daily will meet the editor-elect today in a
special session of the Afternoon Club following a heated staff meeting
