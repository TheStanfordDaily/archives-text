BOY, THE RULE BOOK!
They say that Stanford's Pop War
ner has caused more football rules to
be written than any other man. His
ingenuity has led gridiron high mo
guls a merry chase.
And now comes Dink Templeton,
youthful mentor of Cardinal track ath
letes, who created a furor last Satur
day that would do credit to Warner
at his smartest.
For the English majors, jani
tors, and invalids who aren't
familiar with the situation, let it
be explained that Templeton con
ceived the idea of starting his
runners from hand rests, thus rais
ing the head and shoulders to
attain a better balance. It had
worked quite well in practice last
week, but when Referee Kinter
Hamilton, at the California Inter
collegiates in Los Angeles Satur
day, espied the Stanford mana
gers busily pounding down the
blocks for the northern speed
sters, he quickly but emphatically
turned his thumbs down.
The dapper Templeton protested.
The crowd howled. But Mr. Hamilton
was firm.
"Thou shalt not use blocks," he
declared. "If thou dost, thy points
shall not count."
"Okay," Stanford's Dink iB reported
to have replied, "we'll use 'em any
way."
They did. Both Mr. Hamilton and
Mr. Templeton stuck by their guns.
The Cardinal runners used their start
ing blocks, and officials ruled out
every point obtained thereby. And
Stanford "officially" lost a meet, al
though the Cardinals scored the high
est number of points.
Now comes the problem of what
national track officials will rule
on the question. Some doubt
teems to exist as to whether exist
ing rules make any mention at
all of mechanical aids in starting.

Even if they do, Templeton does
n't think his brain child is any
violation. On the other hand,
Dean B. Cromwell, coach of
U.S.C.'s "epoch making" track
and field organizations, Is con
trary.
Templeton says he will use his in
vention at the 1.C.4-A. Cromwell, con
trary still, avers that Philadelphia of
ficials won't let him. Whether Stan
ford "leg men" use the blocks back
east or not, the fact remains that the
Cardinals lost a perfectly good track
meet. And that is very sad.
Unless we are misinformed, it is
customary for rules to be made by a
committee especially chosen for that
purpose. When Pop Warner cracks
out with something new and different
in the way of football spangles the
referee doesn't stop the game and
make up a new rule instanter. He
does his squawking at a meeting of
the rules committee after the season
is over. At least he gives the wily
Pop credit for being smart.
Perhaps Mr. Hamilton might tear
a page from the book on gridiron
etiquette, and give the Devil his due.
Anyway, it was a "noble ex
periment," to use the phrasing of
our own Herbert.
