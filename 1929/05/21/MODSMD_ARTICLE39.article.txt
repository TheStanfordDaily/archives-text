# ADOPTION OF CREW URGED BY FORMER CARD ROWING CHIEF

Sports Editor, Stanford Daily,

Dear Sir:
It is, of course, a normal condition
—at least we found it so at Stanford
—that those who turn out for rowing
do so for the love of the sport merely,
because it was only once during the
entire crew season that the public —
and this includes the student public —
had an opportunity to lend its moral
support. That condition also was some
indication that those on the crew were
there for the sake of the sport, and
not for any glory which might result
in the eyes of fellow students or the
public.
It should be recalled that the Stan
ford crew of 1915 was the first West
ern crew which engaged the attention
of Eastern critics. That was the crew
that rowed at Poughkeepsie on June
29, 1915, defeating crews of Columbia,
University of Pennsylvania, and Syra
cuse, and losing the varsity four-mile
race to Cornel by 1 1-5 seconds, after
rowing from behind for the last mile,
and gaining on the Cornell crew at
every stroke. Of course, that crew has
been followed to Poughkeepsie by
other famous crews, from the Univer
sity of California and the University
of Washington, but after all, Stanford
gets the credit for the first Western
crew which was a serious contender
for national honors, and that was the
1915 crew.
It has been argued that Stanford is
more inaccessible to water than the
University of California. This is not
true. The University of California
crew practices on the Oakland Estu
ary, where the water is practically
continually disturbed by one kind of
water craft and another, from ferry
boats to tugboats. There is no doubt
whatsoever that in the bay near Palo
Alto can be found water which is far
more desirable, and which is in closer
proximity to the Campus of Stanford
than Redwood City, but even Redwood
City is nearer to the campus than the
Oakland Estuary is to the University
of California campus.
If you really want to bring the sport
back to Stanford, you must make up
your minds, in the first place, to spend
some money. It seems to me that the
revenue from football should certain
ly take care of the expense of crew.
Students who would not participate in
any other sport will be attracted to
this sport, because all comers are on
an equal footing, and those who are
inexperienced do not have to over
come advantages which others may
have gained in prep school.

Dear Sir:
I am afraid my thoughts on the
matter cannot be contained in a short
note, but will condense my estimate
of the situation, past and present, as
best I know how.
To begin with, crew has been a
great sport at Stanford. I was thrilled
to read the headlines of a Stanford
crew not given a chance by experts,
going back to the Poughkeepsie Re
gatta in 1915 and finish neck and neck
with Cornell the winner.
As to the Pacific coast, Stanford's
return to the sport, I believe, would
be followed by such schools as U.S.C.
and the Southern Branch taking up
crew, as 1 understand there has been
considerable talk along that line.
It requires little imagination to fore
see the equivalent of the Poughkeep
sie Regatta on the Pacific coast!
The question of expense has always
been anolgomous with crew at Stan
ford. It was curtailed for this reason
in order to help allow funds for a
building program which included the
stadium. With the present revenue
from sports, crews should not be a
severe drain.
Out here, crew is entirely a college
sport and gives equal chance to all,
and will attract a greater proportion
of those who need physical training
the most because they are not in com
petition with those who have had pre
vious training in this sport.
It would give me great pleasure to
see Stanford on the water again. If I
can be of any aid in contacts down
here, or do anything to promote the
interests of crew, please feel free to
call upon me.

great sport at Stanford. I was thrilled
to read the headlines of a Stanford
crew not given a chance by experts,
going back to the Poughkeepsie Re
gatta in 1915 and finish neck and neck
with Cornell the winner.
As to the Pacific coast, Stanford's
return to the sport, I believe, would
be followed by such schools as U.S.C.
and the Southern Branch taking up
crew, as 1 understand there has been
considerable talk along that line.
It requires little imagination to fore
see the equivalent of the Poughkeep
sie Regatta on the Pacific coast!
The question of expense has always
been anolgomous with crew at Stan
ford. It was curtailed for this reason
in order to help allow funds for a
building program which included the
stadium. With the present revenue
from sports, crews should not be a
severe drain.
Out here, crew is entirely a college
sport and gives equal chance to all,
and will attract a greater proportion
of those who need physical training
the most because they are not in com
petition with those who have had pre
vious training in this sport.
It would give me great pleasure to
see Stanford on the water again. If I
can be of any aid in contacts down
here, or do anything to promote the
interests of crew, please feel free to
call upon me.

Dear Sir:
It is, of course, a normal condition
—at least we found it so at Stanford
—that those who turn out for rowing
do so for the love of the sport merely,
because it was only once during the
entire crew season that the public —
and this includes the student public —
had an opportunity to lend its moral
support. That condition also was some
indication that those on the crew were
there for the sake of the sport, and
not for any glory which might result
in the eyes of fellow students or the
public.
It should be recalled that the Stan
ford crew of 1915 was the first West
ern crew which engaged the attention
of Eastern critics. That was the crew
that rowed at Poughkeepsie on June
29, 1915, defeating crews of Columbia,
University of Pennsylvania, and Syra
cuse, and losing the varsity four-mile
race to Cornel by 1 1-5 seconds, after
rowing from behind for the last mile,
and gaining on the Cornell crew at
every stroke. Of course, that crew has
been followed to Poughkeepsie by
other famous crews, from the Univer
sity of California and the University
of Washington, but after all, Stanford
gets the credit for the first Western
crew which was a serious contender
for national honors, and that was the
1915 crew.
It has been argued that Stanford is
more inaccessible to water than the
University of California. This is not
true. The University of California
crew practices on the Oakland Estu
ary, where the water is practically
continually disturbed by one kind of
water craft and another, from ferry
boats to tugboats. There is no doubt
whatsoever that in the bay near Palo
Alto can be found water which is far
more desirable, and which is in closer
proximity to the Campus of Stanford
than Redwood City, but even Redwood
City is nearer to the campus than the
Oakland Estuary is to the University
of California campus.
If you really want to bring the sport
back to Stanford, you must make up
your minds, in the first place, to spend
some money. It seems to me that the
revenue from football should certain
ly take care of the expense of crew.
Students who would not participate in
any other sport will be attracted to
this sport, because all comers are on
an equal footing, and those who are
inexperienced do not have to over
come advantages which others may
have gained in prep school.

1915 crew.
It has been argued that Stanford is
more inaccessible to water than the
University of California. This is not
true. The University of California
crew practices on the Oakland Estu
ary, where the water is practically
continually disturbed by one kind of
water craft and another, from ferry
boats to tugboats. There is no doubt
whatsoever that in the bay near Palo
Alto can be found water which is far
more desirable, and which is in closer
proximity to the Campus of Stanford
than Redwood City, but even Redwood
City is nearer to the campus than the
Oakland Estuary is to the University
of California campus.
If you really want to bring the sport
back to Stanford, you must make up
your minds, in the first place, to spend
some money. It seems to me that the
revenue from football should certain
ly take care of the expense of crew.
Students who would not participate in
any other sport will be attracted to
this sport, because all comers are on
an equal footing, and those who are
inexperienced do not have to over
come advantages which others may
have gained in prep school.

Dear Sir:
I am afraid my thoughts on the
matter cannot be contained in a short
note, but will condense my estimate
of the situation, past and present, as
best I know how.
To begin with, crew has been a
great sport at Stanford. I was thrilled
to read the headlines of a Stanford
crew not given a chance by experts,
going back to the Poughkeepsie Re
gatta in 1915 and finish neck and neck
with Cornell the winner.
As to the Pacific coast, Stanford's
return to the sport, I believe, would
be followed by such schools as U.S.C.
and the Southern Branch taking up
crew, as 1 understand there has been
considerable talk along that line.
It requires little imagination to fore
see the equivalent of the Poughkeep
sie Regatta on the Pacific coast!
The question of expense has always
been anolgomous with crew at Stan
ford. It was curtailed for this reason
in order to help allow funds for a
building program which included the
stadium. With the present revenue
from sports, crews should not be a
severe drain.
Out here, crew is entirely a college
sport and gives equal chance to all,
and will attract a greater proportion
of those who need physical training
the most because they are not in com
petition with those who have had pre
vious training in this sport.
It would give me great pleasure to
see Stanford on the water again. If I
can be of any aid in contacts down
here, or do anything to promote the
interests of crew, please feel free to
call upon me.
