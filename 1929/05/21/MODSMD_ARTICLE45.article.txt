# SPORTS OF 1929
## The 						Big Question Mark 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
The case of "William Tilden II ver
sus the tennis players of France, Ger
many, and England" will be heard on
the courts of Europe this summer,
beginning with the Gallic champion
ship and ending with another try for
the historic Davis Cup, now securely
held by Messieurs Lacoste, Cochet,
and Borotra. The main question is, of
course, whether or not "Big Bill," who
is sometimes known as "Bad Bill,"
will include in his repertoire such of
his well-known acts as "Triumphant
Old Age" and "Outwitting Father
Time," or confine himself to such
roles as "The Dying Gaul" and "The
Fall of the Wizard of 1926."
Bill has it in him to rise, Phenix

| like, from the ashes of defeat and
! put over a surprising win now and
jthen, as a year ago when he boat
j Lacoste in the Davis Cup challenge
j round in Paris. But Bill is woefully
1 off his game right now, or was when
he sailed early in May, and it will
take a superhuman effort on the part
of the gaunt Philadelphian to keep
from being put out early in the big
j European championships in which he
and Frank Hunter will participate.
However, superhuman efforts are a
habit of Long William's, and it may
be that the cagy Old Wizard will out
i fox both his opponents and his critics,
j and come home with a scalp or two
I ere September rolls around.
