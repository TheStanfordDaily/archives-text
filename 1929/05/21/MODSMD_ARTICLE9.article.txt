# U.S. MAY REDUCE GERMANY'S DEBT IF ALLIES AGREE
## America's Action Dependent On Similar Reductions By Other Nations 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20.
duction by the United States of its
claim against Germany for expenses
of the army of occupation was con
sidered a possibility in official circles
,tonight if the other Allies agree to
make a similar cut in their claims.
The decisions on the entire repara
tions problem which have so far been
reached by government officials, in
cluding those at the conference Presi
dent Hoover held Sunday night with
Executive Department officials and
Congressional leaders, have merely
been in the nature of anticipating
questions which will necessitate the
shaping of a policy by the American
government.
It. was emphasized in high govern
ment circles today there has so far
been no change in the American
policy on this question of reparation.
The attitude which it is believed this
government would take in the event
the anticipated questions arise has
been made known to the American
representatives, who do not represent
the Washington government officially,
at the meetings of the experts on
reparations in Paris.
At present the principal decision
made by officials here has been that,
if the other allied nations agree to
reduce their claims for occupation
costs of their arrhies on the Rhine,
this government will probably feel
called upon to do likewise. The
amount of this reduction is not known,
but Secretary Stimson of the State
Department suggested that conclu
sions might be drawn from the fact
that the other allies have approxi
mately ten per cent of their claims
still outstanding.
Only about 30 per cent of the
American claims for army costs have
been paid but Secretary Stimson in
timated that the United States would
be willing to cancel a proportional
amount of its outstanding claim of
$203,667,110.75 if the other allies
should see fit to cancel a part of
theirs.
