# FRENCH SLOW TO RENOVATE OLD CUSTOMS
## Prof. Guerard Characterizes France as Country of Decadent Ways 
### 
"France still thinks in terms of one
or two centuries ago," said Professor
Albert GuerarH of the English Depart
ment, in his lecture on "France lie
visited," in the Assembly Hall last
night.
"The French cling to the theory of
the party system, but there has never
been the true party system there in
the American or English sense. In
stead there are numerous changing
groups, to which the same man may
adhere at the same time, on different
policies. These groups form coalitions
which result in many crises, but which
are on the whole strong because the
satisfactory men are retained regard
less of changes in the cabinet.
"The Alsacians," continued Guerard,
"have always been a question. This
province was German in history and
tradition until 1648, when France took
it by force. Since then the Alsacians
have been French at heart. They vol
untarily learned the language of their
new rulers, and became an integral
part of France in the Revolution. The
struggle of today is purely a clerical
question.
"Contrary to the usual conception,"
he said, "American tourists have not
spoiled Paris. The American wants
old things to remain old, curious and
quaint; in fact" he has restored many
of the traditions which Europe has
been casting off. But Paris has a prob
lem in the question of extension. She
has urban congestion and inconven
ient, unsanitary suburban conditions;
and to overcome these disadvantages,"
he concluded, "Paris must conquer
the hostiliiy of the central govern
ment, which in reality is provincial,
and she must strengthen her munici
pal government, which is now run by
log-rolling politicians who survived
from the World War."
