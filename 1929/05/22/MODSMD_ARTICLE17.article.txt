# A.S.S.U. REVOTE FOR CONTESTED POSITIONS TO BE HELD TUESDAY
## 
### 
A second election to run off close
votes between two candidates for
seven different offices will be held
Tuesday, May 28, it was decided in
Ex Committee last night.
Robert Bell's appointment as senior
track manager for the 1929-30 season
was confirmed, and George Hammond,
Thomas Melgaard, Robert Perry, Bar
ney Drefus, and Joe Newell were
named junior managers in the order
named, with A1 Denny and Graham
Young, alternates.
Louis Vincenti, who has been stu
dent manager for the past year, was
passed at the recommendation of A1
Masters to hold that position again
for 1929-30.
Charles B. Smith was approved as
senior soccer manager for next year,
with Fred Bell, Whitney Wright, and
John T. Kelly as junior managers.
A special freshman award for hav
ing won four major sport numerals
was granted to Rudolph Rintala, who
was on the football, basketball, base
ball, and track teams. The Committee
also passed an amendment to the
A.S.S.U. by-laws providing for a Con
valescent Home Committee of five
students, which will have charge of
Labor Day and the annual drive for
funds.
Two petitions, each signed by fifty
studetns, as required to put their
questions to student body ballot, were
discussed by the Ex Committee and
tabled without action. The first peti
tion proposed an amendment similar
to the one passed by student vote yes
terday changing Article VI, Section
2e, with the exception that four in
nings in the California series wins a
block "S," and that it be retroactive
for the past season.
The second petition proposed that
all the amendments concerning
awards which were passed by student
vote yesterday should be made re
troactive for the past season. The
Committee strongly disfavored start
ing the precedent of making changes
in awards retroactive, and decided to
discuss the matter later. The Com
mittee is required by the A.S.S.U.
Constitution to put these questions
to a student body vote within thirty
days, but as the quarter ends in three
weeks, they will not be forced to take
action on the matter.
