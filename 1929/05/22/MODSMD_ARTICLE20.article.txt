# Crew Wins To Lose
## 
### 
By a majority of one hundred sixty-two the consensus of the student
body favored the inauguration of crew at Stanford. With so narrow a
margin, it cannot be said that the student body desires the return of this
sport. This then is the result of the Daily's inquiry into the matter.
From the student body's point of view the matter is closed. Facts
and figures, gained by the Daily, presented substantial arguments for
the return of crew and backed these arguments with a practical plan
whereby it could be reinstated. However, without strong student body
backing the matter cannot be carried further.
One thing stands out very clearly: the chief objection to the return
of crew was not enough manpower. Ten years ago, Stanford was able
to support crew as well as other sports. How does the present student
body differ from that of ten years ago? It has less lower division men.
Crew is now a lost cause, but what of the other major sports in the
years to come- Where will the manpower come for these teams? How
will Stanford measure up to the other universities in sports?
Already the cut in the lower division has been felt in every sport, and
only the first cut has been made. It can be pointed out that athletics
after all is an extra-curricular activity and that the University isn't built
for the production of all-American athletes and winning teams. But
that argument loses a bit of its sparkle when those little practical matters
of revenue from sports and prestige from intercollegiate competition are
mentioned.
The Board of Athletic Control, when the Daily instigated its inquiry
on crew, presented this argument, that the reinstatement of crew would
prevent the construction of a new women's gymnasium. The Daily be
lieved that this argument meant nothing because the Board of Athletic
Control made no guarantee that should crew not be reinaugurated a new
gym would be built. However, since the Board made such a statement,
assuming that it meant something by it, the women now may present their
request and have more assurance than ever before that they will get
what they want.
The Daily reiterates its policy: a need, such as a new women's gym
nasium, of thirty-eight years standing is a disgrace to the University.
Whether it is the Board of Athletic Control or the University that
University's responsibility. If the Board builds it, so much to the
credit of that organization. It can do things like that now; in the years
to come when the lower division elimination has caused the athletic
decline of Stanford, new gymnasiums and other campus improvements
will look elsewhere for support.
