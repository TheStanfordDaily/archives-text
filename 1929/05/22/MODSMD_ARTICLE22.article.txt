# More Tryoutees Wanted For Concert Series Staff
## 
### 
More tryoutees are wanted to try
out for the A.S.S.U. Concert Series
Staff, announces Carl Mather, Concert
Manager. While about eleven try
outees were present at the first meet
ing, there is still an opportunity for
those wishing to take it. Three sal
aried positions are open to freshmen
or others who plan to be in the Uni
versity for three more years.
The work will consist in securing
deposits on next year's Series, record
ing orders, working on the mailing
list, etc. Students trying out at this
time will gain a distinct advantage
over those who start in next full. No
previous experience or musical ability
are at all essential.
Pi Mu Epsilon, national honorary
mathematics fraternity, has estab
lished a chapter at the University of
Oklahoma.
