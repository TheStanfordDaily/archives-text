Farewell to Youth, by Storm Jameson.
(New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 1928.)
The title of this novel is certainly
of personal and very real significance
to its author; for it marks her "fare
well to youth" and entrance to ma
turity as a writer. The artistic but fal
tering touch so perceptible in Miss
Jameson's earlier books has lost none
of its artistry hut has acquired a de
lightful surety.
This is not a happy story. But then
when does one cast aside youth with
a laugh? Unless it be a bitter laugh,
which is worse than a sigh. This book
has somewhat that laugh, though "bit
ter," is perhaps too strong a word
and "ironic" might suit the near-tragic
quality better.
"Farewell to Youth" is a story of
that lost generation which was in its
late 'teens or very early twenties
when the World War began. It wasn't
the actual experiences of the war that
wrecked Nat Grimshaw's life; for, as
he said himself, he rather enjoyed the
excitement and exhiliration of it, the
months of life with men in a men's
world, the imminence of death, the
sharing of danger and discomfort
which brought forth the best and the
worst in you. Of course, there were
the horrible things, the things you
didn't dare think about lest you lose
your reason as some of them did, and
all in all it was rather an imbecilic
way of doing things as you were con
scious all the time, and he'd never
have the nerve for another war; but
it was a good life nevertheless.

No, it wasn't the war that did it. It
was the things that went on at home
during those wasted months. If all
the world had been at war, they might
have kept step; but as it was you
broke into a run for a time and you
couldn't step right back in. You had
changed; people who had stayed home
had changed; and situations had
changed. When he returns, Nat says, ;
speaking of himself and his contem- j
poraries, "We are the lost generation,
the ones whose first youth was bitten !
out by the war. We've lost time, and
the expectation of great events. We've
had our greatest event. We're lost
and restless in a world that changed
when we had our backs to it. Most (
of us are dead and the rest undone. !
We are the lost generation."
Yet this is not a sentimental book, |
not just another post-war story. The j
style is at times so utterly charming j
that one almost forgets to follow the
plot. Delightful and individual charac- j
ters and clever dialogue make "Fare- j
well to Youth" an achievement. Nat j
Grimshaw, young and sensitive and
very English in the way that is the j
best of the English; Denny, his pretty
and unfaithful wife who is the prin
ciple cause of his disillusionment; his
clever, childishly-wise mother; his
gentle, thoughtlessly-cruel father; all j
these go through the novel with a
whimsical amusement at their own |
actions that gives an astonishing illu- j
sion of reality.
Storm Jameson has, of a certainty,
bid Farewell to Youth and "come of
age."

ters and clever dialogue make "Fare- j
well to Youth" an achievement. Nat j
Grimshaw, young and sensitive and
very English in the way that is the j
best of the English; Denny, his pretty
and unfaithful wife who is the prin
ciple cause of his disillusionment; his
clever, childishly-wise mother; his
gentle, thoughtlessly-cruel father; all j
these go through the novel with a
whimsical amusement at their own |
actions that gives an astonishing illu- j
sion of reality.

Farewell to Youth, by Storm Jameson.
(New York: Alfred A. Knopf. 1928.)
The title of this novel is certainly
of personal and very real significance
to its author; for it marks her "fare
well to youth" and entrance to ma
turity as a writer. The artistic but fal
tering touch so perceptible in Miss
Jameson's earlier books has lost none
of its artistry hut has acquired a de
lightful surety.
This is not a happy story. But then
when does one cast aside youth with
a laugh? Unless it be a bitter laugh,
which is worse than a sigh. This book
has somewhat that laugh, though "bit
ter," is perhaps too strong a word
and "ironic" might suit the near-tragic
quality better.
"Farewell to Youth" is a story of
that lost generation which was in its
late 'teens or very early twenties
when the World War began. It wasn't
the actual experiences of the war that
wrecked Nat Grimshaw's life; for, as
he said himself, he rather enjoyed the
excitement and exhiliration of it, the
months of life with men in a men's
world, the imminence of death, the
sharing of danger and discomfort
which brought forth the best and the
worst in you. Of course, there were
the horrible things, the things you
didn't dare think about lest you lose
your reason as some of them did, and
all in all it was rather an imbecilic
way of doing things as you were con
scious all the time, and he'd never
have the nerve for another war; but
it was a good life nevertheless.

No, it wasn't the war that did it. It
was the things that went on at home
during those wasted months. If all
the world had been at war, they might
have kept step; but as it was you
broke into a run for a time and you
couldn't step right back in. You had
changed; people who had stayed home
had changed; and situations had
changed. When he returns, Nat says, ;
speaking of himself and his contem- j
poraries, "We are the lost generation,
the ones whose first youth was bitten !
out by the war. We've lost time, and
the expectation of great events. We've
had our greatest event. We're lost
and restless in a world that changed
when we had our backs to it. Most (
of us are dead and the rest undone. !
We are the lost generation."
