# SPORTS OF 1929
## Goes Back For More 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
You might think that Peter de Paolo
would be through with automobile
racing for good, after crashing into
a brick retaining wall while practic
ing for last year's Memorial Day race,
and rolling over and over a couple of
times, but you'd be mistaken. The
fable has it that the tortoise beat the
hare, and so, having "turned turtle"
without serious results, smiling Pete
decided to go back for more and will
try to beat the mechanical jack-rab
bits and greyhounds who will vie for
the money and glory that goes to the
winner of the annual Memorial Day
race at Indianapolis.
It is just four years since the popu
lar Italian, a nephew of Ralph de
Palma, won this classic of all Ameri
can auto races. His time of 4 hours,
56 minutes, 39.46 seconds still stands

as the recognized mark for 500 miles.
Think of it! Better than 100 miles an
hour for 500 miles! But then, the pis
ton displacement of the castor-oil
burning motors was reduced the next
year from 122 cubic inches to 91%, so
de Paolo's record will probably last a
long, long time.
The Hoosier capital is just as agog !
over its annual big racing event as I
Louisville was over its Derby. And j
150,000 or more people watch (lie In- j
; dianapolis speed classic each year, '
1 which, unless two and two don't make
four, is sport's largest crowd. Tommy
Milton is the only man ever to win
the big race twice. He retired some
time ago, and perhaps thus escaped
i the sad fate of such famous drivers j
| as Dario Resta, "Howdy" Wilcox, Gas
j ton Chevrolet, Jimmy Murphy.
