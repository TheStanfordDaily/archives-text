### 
W.A.A. Board decided last night to
postpone the Annual Field Day, origi
nally set for Saturday, to June 1. All
four spring sports, swimming, tennis,
archery, and track, will be held on
that day. Women's gym classes are
to be carried on into next week, and it
has been customary to hold the Field
Day at the completion of the quarter's
gym work.
Plans have been made by the Board
to hold one of the four sports on the
day previous to the other sports in
order to avoid conflict in those tak
ing part in two, but the Board de
cided last night to hold all four on
Saturday, June 1. A barbecue to which
all Stanford women are invited is to
take place at noon. Awards of letters
will be held at the barbecue.
