# MOTHERS' EFFECT ON WORLD PEACE DESTINY IS SUBJECT OF TALK BY KATHLEEN NORRIS
## 
### 
"Today the problem of world peace
is foremost in the world, and it is the
destiny of the mothers to solve it,"
said Mrs. Kathleen Norris in a talk
before the Stanford Women's Moth
ers' Clab yesterday afternoon in the
Women's Clubhouse.
The world is full of authentic in
formation about the last war, and it
is only by studying the last war that
fu)ure wars can hope to be prevented.
Everyone should read at least one
authentic book, believes Mrs. Norris.
She commented favorably upon a re
cent book, "Politics of Feace," by
Charles E. Martin, which is in the
Stanford World Politics series, and
recommended "Falsehood In War
Time," by Sir Arthur Ponsonby. She
believes that David Starr Jordan is
one of the foremost of world pacifists.
There never could be a war fought
without untruth because war is es
sentially a lie. War is carried on
only by the assistance of propaganda
which causes fear. Wars are fought
because we are made afraid and in
fear we act without thought
War should be considered as an

economic problem. If the withdrawal
of United States foreign trade were
threatened it would be sufficiently
powerful to keep any country from
going to war and it is up to the women
to apply the threat. Women have the
power to enforce an unofficial boycott
by refusing to patronize certain for
eign brands of articles.
Money is put before life. Every war
has drafts which include all the avail
able men, but just a small part of a
man's income is very carefully taken
away. Drafts are not fair to mothers,
Mrs. Norris emphasized, as the son
who has excellent mental and physical
characteristics is sent to the front
while those who have been carelessly
brought up with poor health, morals,
etc., are refused by the draft and re
main safely at homo.
The time to prepare for peace is
poace time, but it is essential to know
the facts of war. "I do not believe that
we will ever have another world war,"
stated Mrs. Norris. "The immense
proportion of money now spent on
war will be used for constructive or
philanthropic purposes."

philanthropic purposes."
"Today the problem of world peace
is foremost in the world, and it is the
destiny of the mothers to solve it,"
said Mrs. Kathleen Norris in a talk
before the Stanford Women's Moth
ers' Clab yesterday afternoon in the
Women's Clubhouse.
The world is full of authentic in
formation about the last war, and it
is only by studying the last war that
fu)ure wars can hope to be prevented.
Everyone should read at least one
authentic book, believes Mrs. Norris.
She commented favorably upon a re
cent book, "Politics of Feace," by
Charles E. Martin, which is in the
Stanford World Politics series, and
recommended "Falsehood In War
Time," by Sir Arthur Ponsonby. She
believes that David Starr Jordan is
one of the foremost of world pacifists.
There never could be a war fought
without untruth because war is es
sentially a lie. War is carried on
only by the assistance of propaganda
which causes fear. Wars are fought
because we are made afraid and in
fear we act without thought
War should be considered as an

economic problem. If the withdrawal
of United States foreign trade were
threatened it would be sufficiently
powerful to keep any country from
going to war and it is up to the women
to apply the threat. Women have the
power to enforce an unofficial boycott
by refusing to patronize certain for
eign brands of articles.
Money is put before life. Every war
has drafts which include all the avail
able men, but just a small part of a
man's income is very carefully taken
away. Drafts are not fair to mothers,
Mrs. Norris emphasized, as the son
who has excellent mental and physical
characteristics is sent to the front
while those who have been carelessly
brought up with poor health, morals,
etc., are refused by the draft and re
main safely at homo.
The time to prepare for peace is
poace time, but it is essential to know
the facts of war. "I do not believe that
we will ever have another world war,"
stated Mrs. Norris. "The immense
proportion of money now spent on
war will be used for constructive or
philanthropic purposes."
