Sail into that summer vacation... right.. .with all the joys I
that only the ocean can give...on the super-express liners—
"HAKM&RDW'YALE*
\
ITiIS IS MORE than a voyage—it's a liberal education in |
maritime merriment and mirth. Music...a wonderful din- l
ner...and dancing all evening—unless a moonlit deck is a
Stronger attraftion! The one way to enjoy traveling as a party,
with fun for the whole party together, is the delightful sea-way,
on one of the famous collegiate liners—Harvard and Yale. ,
