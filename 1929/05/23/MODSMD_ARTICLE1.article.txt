# WAR DEBT MEET FATE RESTS WITH GERMAN EXPERTS
## Creditor Nations Give Final Report to Head of German Commission at Conference Owen D. Young Plan Modified To Meet With Demands of Debtor Country Delegates 
### 
PARIS, May 22. (£>)—' The fate of
the reparations conference was to
night in the hands of the German
experts. The creditor delegates said
their last word in a revised edition
of the conference's report which was
presented to I)r. Hjalmar Schacht
with a covering letter shortly after
noon today.
The report, as it stands, and the
letter accepted most of the conditions
to which the German experts subordi
nated their acceptance of the annui
ties plan proposed by Owen D. Young.
The allied delegates rejected the
German demand for the right to post
pone payments within Germany on
protected annuities on their own initia
tive. They lifted the lien on German
industrial enterprises and agreed that
the Dawes lien on German railroads
be considered as a second mortgage
so as to facilitate financing them.
The creditors further granted the
German demand that the uncondition
al part of the annuities for the first
37 years be reduced from Mr. Young's
figure of 830,000,000 marks (approxi
mately $207,500,000) to GG0.000.000
marks (approximately $165,000,000).
They demanded, however, that the
unprotected part be increased after
a certain number of years so as to
reach 830,000,000 marks in the 29th
year.
Dr. Schacht's demand that the Ger
mans should have the right to call in
at par at any time the bonds through
which part of the reparations debt
eventually will be mobilized was re
jected.
