# Dog Catcher Tangles With Barkless Dog; Barks Shin

### 
EVANSTON, 111., May 22. (/P)â€”Geno
De Servi, dog catcher of Northwestern
University campus and surrounding
town, lost his desire to ensnare un
muzzled canines after a peculiar ex
perience yesterday. When within a
few feet of a dog, De Servi cast his
net, and followed through with a flying
tackle to cinch the prize.
Today the dog catcher has three
sprained fingers, a blackened eye, and
a barked shin. The dog was an iron
ornament.
