# SENATE DESIRES HOUSE VOTE ON EXPORT DEBENTURE PLAN
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 22. (/P)—A pro
posal was made to the House mem
bers of the Farm Relief Conference
Committee by Senate spokesmen to
day that the House be permitted to
vote on the export depenture plan as
an amendment to the tariff bill, in
order to satisfy a Senate demand that
the other branch of Congress express
itself upon the proposition.
The suggestion was carried to Rep
resentative Garner, of Texas, the
Democratic leader, who was named as
the man who should propose inclusion
of debentures in the tariff measure.
While no immediate decision was
forthcoming, there was little informa
tion that indicated the proposal would
be adopted.
The suggestion was made after
House conferees again persisted in
their refusal to negotiate differences
in the farm bills passed separately by
the House and Senate until the de
benture section was eliminated from
the discussions. Senate members of

the committee insisted that the House
in some way express itself on the plan
and suggested that it might as well
be done by a vote on a proposal to
include it in the tariff bill.
This, the Senate conferees argued,
would satisfy demands of the Senate
and also circumvent the contention of
the House that it should be the first
to propose debentures because that
branch views it as revenue raising
legislation. By proposing debentures
as a part of the tariff bill, rather than
vote on them as part of the farm re
lief measure, Senate committeemen
pointed out, the constitutional objec
tions of the House would be met.
Although it was supposed that
amendments to the tariff bill would
be limited, it was suggested that
Representative Garner move to re
commit the measure to the Ways and
Means Committee with instructions to
include the debenture plan, thus mak
ing the resultant vote directly on the
debenture proposal.
