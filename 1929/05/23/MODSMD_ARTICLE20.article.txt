## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 22.
dent Hoover has decided to limit pub
lic: receptions at the White House to
one day each week and will put the
new schedule into effect next week.
Originally such receptions were held
daily but shortly after Mr. Hoover's
inauguration the number was reduced
to two each week with the announce
ment that later it would be further
curtailed. It is expected that eventu
ally the receptions will be entirely
eliminated from the President's pro
gram. For the last two months the
receptions have been held each Mon
day and Thursday, but after this week
they will take place only on Wednes
days.
