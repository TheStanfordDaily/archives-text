# DELTA CHI, PHI KAPS, EL TORO, DELTS WIN MURAL RELAY HEATS
## 
### 
Delta Chi, Delta Tau Delta, El Toro,
and Phi Kappa won their heats in the
preliminaries of the Spring Intramural
Relay held yesterday afternoon. These
teams and Sequoia, which made the
fastest time of second-place takers,
will meet in the finals Friday after
noon at 4:15 o'clock. Judging from
times turned in yesterday, the relay
final should be fast and close, as Delts
made the fastest time of 3:16 2-5.
The last heat, although run in the
slowest time, turned out to be a real
battle. Sigma Chi led until the final
lap when Dean Sweeney, of Phi Kappa
Sigma, passed Eliot in the last one
hundred yards. Eliot barely nosed
nut the Phi Sigma Kappa anchor man
to take second place.
The Intramural Relay, eight men
running a mile, is an event separate
from the Intramural Track and Field
Championship, and place-winners iii
both events score equally in the an
nual intramural rating. The final two
events of track and field, the 880 and
the discus throw, take place this af
ternoon.
