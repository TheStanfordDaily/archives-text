# FEAR LEVEE BREAK
## 
### 
MEMPHIS, Tenn., May 22. (/P) â€”
Greatest anxiety over possible levee
breaks in the Mississippi river and its
tributaries today today was felt at
Hickman, Ky., and Mounds Landing,
Miss. Government and civil engineers
fought to hold the streams back from
homo and farm lands.
