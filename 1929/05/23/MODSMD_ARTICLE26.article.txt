# I.C.4-A TO DECIDE ON TEMPLETON'S "TRACK BLOCKS"
## Dink's Invention May Be Used In Philadelphia by Cards if Passed by Official Board Anderson Will Replace West In Broadjump; Four Men Being Coached for Discus 
### Frank Whiteley 
Coach Dink Templeton will use his
red blocks in the 1.C.4-A. champion
ships in Philadelphia May 31 and
June 1 if the governing body in charge
of 1.C.4-A. competition approves their
use in its meeting May 30. Templeton
will present his "invention" before
this meeting, and final decision as to
whether or not hand rests may be
used in the 1.C.4-A. meet will be
reached then.
The track meet in the South Satur
day was run under the rules of the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion, and it will be up to this body
to decide what team won that meet,
U.S.C. or Stanford. The N.C.A.A. has
already sanctioned the use of foot
braces, according to Templeton; and
it is very possible that it will also
approve of hand rests.
The American Athletic Union, the
third great governing body in United
States track competition, has recom
mended the use of foot braces; that
is, if statements of Avery Brundage,
its president, may be taken as repre
sentative of the policy of the A.A.U.
He declared that foot rests are a dis
tinctive improvement in track compe
tition.
Templeton will take his blocks back
to Philadelphia, and they will be used,
depending on the decision of the
1.C.4-A. Committee. The blocks are
of varying heights; and, according to
Templeton, "anyone can get a good
start with them."
One change in the list of men to
make the trip East was announced
last night, Anderson in place of West
in the broad jump. West is unable to
make the trip because of his studies.
There is a possibility that part of
the Stanford team may remain iu
Chicago on the return trip to compete
in the N.C.A.A. meet the week follow
ing the 1.C.4-A. competition. Last year
(he Cards won the National Collegi
ates with an overwhelming total of
71 points to 43 for Illinois, which
placed second. If Stanford does enter
a team in this meet, probably not
more than seven men will compete.
Dink has been working for the past
two afternoons with his discus men,
and he seems to be out after four
places in the 1.C.4-A. affair. Eric Krem,
Harlow Rotliert, Norman McLeod, and
Ray Tandy are all going East to take
part in this event; and it is very
likely that the four of them will place.
Krenz, holder of the unofficial world's
record of 163 ft. 8% in. will be the
favorite to the Philadelphia meet.
The other three men are fairly con
sistent at 140 ft., which distance ought
to be good enough to place them.
