Stanford students have the opportunity of securing the best seats
for the 1929-30 Concert Series by subscribing during the present canvass.
The Concert Series has ceased to be an experiment, and has become an
institution, judging from its success of the past seasons. While the pro
gram for next year has not definitely been decided upon, an array of talent
seldom heard outside of metropolitan districts is promised.
A definite change for the better has been made in the allotting of
tickets. No longer will a subscriber pay one price for seats that range
from bad to worse. Next season each person will have the same seat for
all concerts, the price being based on a sliding scale according to the
location. The confusion of distribution will also be eliminated. In addi
tion, another improvement that would greatly add to the comfort of the
subscribers is finding some means to heat the barn-like Pavilion on the
chilly evenings.
Regardless, those who secure their tickets now will be assured the best
seats, while those who wait will have no one but themselves to blame if
their seats are not all they desire.
