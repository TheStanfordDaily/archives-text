# The 						Mooney-Billings Case
## 
### 
Good old American conservatives are fighting hard to maintain their
inertia and stubborness in the face of hundreds of pleas for the release of
Mooney and Billings. For months now, the Civic Liberties Union, com
posed of liberals like Darrow and Drieser and Wise, has besieged our
friends with petitions. And now, even colleges are awakening from
academic lethargy to take up the cause. Led by the University of Wis
consin organization, Liberal Clubs in colleges throughout the country, in
cluding Ithaca, are distributing petitions among faculty and students.
Unquestionably, Mooney and Billings are innocent of the charge of
manslaughter for which they were convicted thirteen years ago. President
Wilson recognized that shortly after the trial. They could not have been
guilty of planting the bomb that killed ten persons in the San Francisco
Preparedness Day parade in 1916. Witnesses since then have confessed
to perjured evidence; furthermore, the trial judge, every surviving mem
ber of the jury, even the prosecutor of the case, declare publicly that
Moony and Billings are innocent.
It is an outrage that Governor Young of California should ignore this
unquestionable evidence of the innocence of the two men, and stubbornly
withhold his pardon. To right a manifest wrong is far more vital than to
appease the reactionary interests which blurt out nonsense about the "right
men on the wrong evidence." We may hope that the culminative effect of
thousands of pleas for the liberation of Mooney and Billings will force
this tyranny to relent.â€”The Cornell Daily Sun.
