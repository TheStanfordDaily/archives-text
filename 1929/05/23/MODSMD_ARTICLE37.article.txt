Father William. By Donald Ogden
Stewart. (New York: Harpers,
1929.)
"You are old, Father William! the
young man said,
'And your hair has become very
white,
And yet you incessantly stand on
your head.
Do you think at your age it is
right?" "
—Alice in Wonderland.
With this well-known jingle as a
start, Donald Ogden Stewart swings
off to one of the really humorous
novels that have come out this year.
Father William is a laugh from the
first page to the last. The comedy,
without being slapstick or heavy, con
sistently hits the mark. The average
reader has only to pick up the book
and relax over it, and when he isn't
smiling, it will be because he is laugh
ing outright.
Austin, the Father William of the
book, is the star character. You can't
help feeling that the author must
have enjoyed himself immensely work
ing out this character, and while he
was having such a big time he pro
duced a near-masterpiece. In two or
three paragraphs, this engaging figure
is completely explained to the reader
—his soul, his past life, his philosophy,
even his diet. Mr. Stewart turned his
humor loose upon him, with very
edifying results.
When the story opens Austin is
feeling frightfully satisfied with him
self. The fact is that he had been
having a very good time for years—at
least ever since his wife had died.
This was five years ago, and she had
left him with seventeen chairman
ships, and two children. The chair
manships had been quickly gotten rid
of, but the children remained, and
they were an enormous problem.
Still, the trouble that his two off
spings give him is as nothing com
pared to the state that the blue eyes
of Pussie Whitehouse, nineteen and
adorable, leave him one morning.
From then on, although he does not
quite stand on his head incessantly,
his world is so completely upset that
he might just as well be literally in
"Father William's" position.
The real complications set in when
the father and the son find themselves
both in love with the irresistable
Pussy. It will only take about two
hours for you to find out how they
are finally extricated from this pain
ful situation, for when you once start
the book, you are almost sure to go
straight through it without stopping.
Father William is delightfully easy
to read. It is also highly gratifying,
from two standpoints: either the read
er will be pleased with his own sense
of humor, when he finds himself
laughing all the way through, or if
he is sophisticated, he will be equally
pleased with himself for not laughing

i —since that of course would be the ;
| result of the superior subtlety of his
mind. The humor of the book is frank
ly "obvious."
But while the humor may be rather
; too blatantly easy, the characteriza
! tion is sufficiently keen to satisfy the ,
i most discriminating appreciation. Any
how, disregarding all points of sub
tlety and fineness of style, the book
is one that you can genuinely enjoy.
'And isn't that enough?

GEARY —The Second Man. This is ;
an ironical comedy that is deliciously
amusing. It is running for this week
I only and is the second in the reper
tory of four plays being presented by
the New York Theatre Guild.
"The Second Man" is a frail sort of :
a thing; the plot is simple and excit- i
ing; it is mostly conversation, with
little in dramatic strength. Because
it is this type of play, it would fall
flat were it not done by a cast as i
excellent as that of the Theatre Guild.
But since the cast is well-nigh per
fect and the conversation is full of
light, clever, philosophical generaliza- '
tions, "The Second Man" is an en
joyable evening's entertainment for j
anyone with a sense of humor. I j
recommend it on that basis.
There are only four people in the
cast of this play. They have all been
picked with a deft eye for charac
terization. The backbone part is that
of Clark Storey, third-rate writer and
unprincipled, sophisticated, cynical {
young bachelor. Alan Mowbray, who |
was the tubercular artist in "The j
Doctor's Dilemma," presented last
week, takes the part of Storey.
Mowbray is ideally suited to the
part. It is around him that the action j
and conversation of the play revolves. |
There are two women who love him,
Mrs. Kendall Frayne, played by Elisa- '
belli Risdon, and Monica Grey, played j
by Peg Entwistle. The other man is !
Austin Lowe, rich young chemist but
without the gift of gab that Storey i
has. This part is played by Neal Cald
well.
The whole three acts are set in j
J Storey's studio. Here is where Storey j
J putters around, pretending to write. I
It is to the studio where the two wo- j
men come who love him. The one a
rich widow whom he doesn't love, but i
desires to marry for the sake of con
venience and money. The other wo-
J man is an idealistic young girl of
twenty who loves Storey for his selfish
j sophistication.
Of course the play ends happily, but
| only after amusing complications that
I nu'.ke room for much comment on the
| liojle experiment of living happily in
our modern civilized world.
Next week the Guild players will
present "Ned McCobb's Daughter" by :
Sidney Howard for a run of one week, j
