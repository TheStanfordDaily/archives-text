# E.G. Reid, Professor Of Aerodynamics, In Tri-Motor Air Crash
## 
### 
Professor Elliott G. Reid, of the
aerodynamics department, was one of
the seven passengers who miraculous
ly escaped death shortly after mid
night Tuesday night, when a Boeing
tri-motored plane burst into flames
while making a forced landing near
Reno, Nevada.
According to dispatches from Reno,
the left motor of the plane failed just
a few minutes out of Elko, forcing
Pilot Hugh Barker to make a forced
landing with his seven passengers and
cargo of mail. He is said to have
pointed the machine downward at a
sharp angle so that it dived toward
the earth like a huge firebrand. Land
ing without lights, Barker was for
tunate in striking a fiat piece of desert
and made a smooth landing.
Abe Warner, assistant pilot, had the
cabin door open before the blazing
plane came to a stop and the passen
gers clambered to safety on the
ground.
The destruction of the transport,
which was too far gone to save, re
sulted in a loss of about $85,000, the
cause of the accident being, it is said,
a leak in the gas tank. The liberated
gas made contact with a spark in the
motor, and the left wing was ignited
bv the flames which spouted from the
dead engine. The plane was still 2000
feet in the air when the fire started.
Automobiles were dispatched to the
scene of the disaster to bring the
pilots and passengers, who were un
hurt, back to Elko, a distance of about
five miles.
Professor Reid was on his way back
to the campus from Langley Field,
Virginia, where he attended the ses
sions of the Aircraft Engineering Re
search Conference.
