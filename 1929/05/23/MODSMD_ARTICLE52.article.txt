# "GOD KNOWS WHERE' WILL ROGERS WILL APPEAR IN CONCERT
## 
### 
Will Rogers' name is on the
tentative program of the A.S.S.U.
Concert Series for next year.
Though his fame is not great as
a musician, he gives a distinct
type of entertainment, and is
probably the only man who can
keep his audience laughing for
two hours.
His career has been a varied
one. He has appeared in the
roles of comedian in the Ziegfield
Follies, Mayor of Beverly Hills,
newspaper feature writer, motion
picture star, politician, and lec
turer.
Will Rogers is well-known
everywhere. In fact, he is so well
known that, according to Ripley,
he once received a letter which
was addressed only with his pho
tograph. Underneath the photo
graph were written the words,
"God Knows Where."
