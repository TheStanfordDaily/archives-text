; Feeling ran high in Sydney today
i against university students who
i caused a near riot by a student "rag"
last night. The students visited the
! Tivoli theatre in a body, pelted the
i performers with rotten fruit, howled
down the vice-chancellor of the uni
| versity, and threw firecrackers at the
j president of the Undergraduates' As-
I sociation, who tried to restore order.
