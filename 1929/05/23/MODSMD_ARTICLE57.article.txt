## Tony's Big Year 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Give a thought to Anthony Michael
Lazzeri, who has been "flagellating
the leathery spheriod" at a tremen
dous pace during the recent western
trip of those boisterous Yankees. He
started out in Chicago on May 4tli,
getting a double in the first game, a
triple and a homer in the second, and
two doubles and a home run in the
third. The White Sox were glad to
see Tony move away from there after
that —yes, sir!
So Lazzeri invaded St. Louis. In
the first game he got no hits and
made an error. For shame, Tony!
But lie made up for this on May Bth
with two screeching singles. The next
day he contributed a single and a
four-bagger, and said good-bye to the
Mound City. As against the Browns,
he failed to hit in his first game

against the Tigers, but committed no
' error. In the second game he got two
; singles, batting in one run, and in the
third batted in two runs with a dou
ble. And so it went, with the popular
: Italian pounding the Western pitch
ing all over the lot. In four consecu
, five times at bat (in two games) he
; hit two home runs, a triple, and a
double!
Isn't it just Tony's tough luck for
| them to go and abolish the most valu
. able American League Player prize
{ when he was the logical man to win
it this year? This is only the Wallop
j ing Wop's fourth year in the majors,
yet each year he has done better than
the last, and given more evidences
of his skill, gameness, and alert men
| tality. The Italians are rightfully
; proud of this Native Son.
