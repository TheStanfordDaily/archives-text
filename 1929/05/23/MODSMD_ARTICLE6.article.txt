# PATTON WINS MATCH FROM DUNLAP; LEADS W.A.A. ROUND ROBIN
## 
### 
Thelma Patton, winner of the sen
ior tennis matches, leads in the wo
men's interclass round robin tourna
ment which is being played to decide
the University championship.
Patton, who was last year's runner
up for the title, defeated the present
champion, Sue Betty Dunlap, 6-1, 9-7,
on the Roble courts yesterday. Both
players exhibited good tennis, and al
though Dunlap was for the most part
on the defensive, she made-some ex
cellent placements. The match was a
mixture of fast cross court drives and
line placements.
Previous to her match with the
sophomore star, Patton won from
Betts Hawkins by a reversal of the
same score, 9-7, 6-1. With the games
at 5-2, and within one point of losing
the first set, Patton steadied and by
driving to her opponent's backhand
succeeded in winning the next three
games to even the score. Lack of court
experience in following weak shots to
the net only to be passed by well
placed drives contributed to the fresh
man's defeat.
The University championship will
be determined by the number of
matches won and lost in the round
robin tournament in which every
class winner meets. The player win
ning the most matches becomes the
titleholder while the other three hon
orary all-star positions will be de
cided on a similar basis of rating.
