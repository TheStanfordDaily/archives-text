GENEVA, Switzerland, May 22. (/p)
â€”Paraguayan charges that Bolivia is
preparing military action of a large
scale in the Chicao-Boreal region and
Bolivian accusations that Paraguay
has made unjustifiable incursions in
Bolivian territory were contained in
documents published by the League
of Nations today and distributed to all
members.
The Paraguayan charges were con
tained in a letter from R. V. Caballero,
Paraguayan representative in Paris.
He wrote the League on May 13 say
ing Paraguay had learned from vari
ous highly trustworthy sources that
Bolivia was preparing military action
with the object of suddenly placing
Paraguay in the presence of a state
of war.
It was charged that contrary to the
agreements in the Washington proto
col signed in January, Bolivia was
concentrating troops at points where
the military outposts of the two coun
tries were in touch before the Com
mission of Enquiry and Conciliation
appointed in Washington has given
its decision. It also was said that
trains were leaving La Paz daily
carrying troops and military material
to the Paraguayan frontier.
