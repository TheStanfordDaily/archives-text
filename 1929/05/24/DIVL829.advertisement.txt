A Vacation Precaution
Don't leave your jewelry, securities, and
valuable papers at home when starting
your vacation. Fire and thieves are no
respecters of precious belongings. For
a few cents you can rent a safe deposit
box which will guard your valuables from
flames and burglars.
Silverware and other bulky valuables,
too large for a safe deposit box, can be
stored for the summer in our great steel
storage vaults.
