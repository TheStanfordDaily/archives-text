### 
WASHINGTON, May 23. (/P) â€” I The
Senate was challenged today by Sena
tor LaFollette, Republican, Wiscon
sin, to employ its rule of expulsion
on him if he tells his constituency
how he votes on nominations in execu
tive sessions.
The Wisconsin Senator issued his
defy as he denounced the Senate rules
committee for investigating news
papermen instead of members of the
Senate for the publication recently
by several newspapermen of a roll call
purporting to show the vote on con
firmation of Irvine Lenroot as a Fed
eral judge.

The speech was the signal for an
other round of discussion of the Sen
ate's indignation over the constant
publication of proceeding" in its execu
tive sessions. The crowded press gal
teiv joined in the laughter as Senator
Dill, Democrat, Washington, warned
the rules committee that it would
likely have to investigate itself for
""leaks" from its committee if it holds
the proposed investigation of news
papermen in executive session.
Earlier in the day, Senator La Fol
lette offered an amendment to the
rules to provide that representatives
from the press associations be ac
corded the privilege of the floor.
This courtesy was withdrawn from
the press associations yesterday on
demand of the Wisconsin Senator
after the rules committee had voted
unanimously to deny the privilege of
the floor to one press association. No
action was taken on the LaFollette
amendment.

The association expelled was one
of the news agencies carrying the pur
ported Lenroot roll call. Paul Mallon,
who signed the story carried by the
organization, has been called by the
rules committee on Monday.

The roll call has been described as
"inaccurate." Because of the charges
of inaccuracy, Senator JNorris, Re
publican, Nebraska, today asked unani
mous consent that the roll call be
made public, but Senator Hastings,
Republican, Delaware, objected.
