# PROF. REID CENSURES NEWSPAPERS FOR EXAGGERATING AIR CRASH STORY
## 
### 
"Any airplane accident can happen
today, nobody will be hurt, and yet
tomorrow morning just about every
newspaper in the land will have two
inch headlines about the matter."
Thus did Professor E. G. Reid, of the
Aeronautics School, give his opinion
of the unfortunate accident which
befell the Boeing tri-motor plane
which was destroyed by fire just out
side of Elko on Wednesday morning.

Newspaper dispatches gave the fol
lowing account, "Diving earthward
like a huge firebrand, a Boeing tri
motored plane, piloted by Hugh Bar
ker, made a forced landing in the
sagebrush just outside of Elko, Nev.,
after the left motor had given out.
Abe Warner, co-pilot, had the cabin
door open before the blazing plane
came to a stop and the passengers
clambered to safety on the ground.
The plane was 2000 feet in the air
when the fire started."

What really happened was this:
"The plane refueled at the Elko air
port and immediately took off again.
Just about the time it left the ground
ine left motor went dead. Just ahead
and to the left were some hills, and
on account of the right motor the
plane veered to the left. Barker, the
pilot, by manipulating the controls,
and cutting out the right motor, kept
tho ship in the air until some kind of
a landing place appeared. At no time
was the plane more than 75 feet off
the ground. Barker had to fly eight
miles until smooth ground appeared
below. Then he brought the plane
down in what proved to be a swamp.

The landing gear sunk in the mud and
was torn off by the momentum of the
plane. As soon as a stop was made,
the passengers climbed out. About
three of them were left when fire
broke out in front of the cabin. Every
body got out in safety and most of the
luggage was saved. The plane was
totally destroyed."

"You can see the false situation
created by the newspaper dispatches,"
continued Professor Iteid. "And this
is the great trouble with airplane ac
cident stories. They simply do not
give the real facts and as a result the
industry suffers and likewise the pub
lic. Most people believe the stories
and consequently do not have the true
angle of air safety. This is the first
of the Boeing tri-motor planes to
crack up and as far as I know Is the
first of the commercial tri-motors on
a regular run to ever crash. Any tri
motored airplane can fly on its two
motors provided it has sufficient alti
tude. Three important factors were
against this Hoeing plane and caused
its crash. The engine cutting out, a
badly located airport, and lack of alti
tude.
"If the public Is ever to become
air-minded all of this high-powered
stretching of facts must bo stopped,
without the airplane, this country
will not go very far in the way of high
speed transportation. The answer to
this situation lies in either educating
the press to give the details right, or
else in teaching the public to believe
only about one-tenth of what they
read as regards airplane accidents."

came to a stop and the passengers
clambered to safety on the ground.
The plane was 2000 feet in the air
when the fire started."

What really happened was this:
"The plane refueled at the Elko air
port and immediately took off again.
Just about the time it left the ground
ine left motor went dead. Just ahead
and to the left were some hills, and
on account of the right motor the
plane veered to the left. Barker, the
pilot, by manipulating the controls,
and cutting out the right motor, kept
tho ship in the air until some kind of
a landing place appeared. At no time
was the plane more than 75 feet off
the ground. Barker had to fly eight
miles until smooth ground appeared
below. Then he brought the plane
down in what proved to be a swamp.

The landing gear sunk in the mud and
was torn off by the momentum of the
plane. As soon as a stop was made,
the passengers climbed out. About
three of them were left when fire
broke out in front of the cabin. Every
body got out in safety and most of the
luggage was saved. The plane was
totally destroyed."

"You can see the false situation
created by the newspaper dispatches,"
continued Professor Iteid. "And this
is the great trouble with airplane ac
cident stories. They simply do not
give the real facts and as a result the
industry suffers and likewise the pub
lic. Most people believe the stories
and consequently do not have the true
angle of air safety. This is the first
of the Boeing tri-motor planes to
crack up and as far as I know Is the
first of the commercial tri-motors on
a regular run to ever crash. Any tri
motored airplane can fly on its two
motors provided it has sufficient alti
tude. Three important factors were
against this Hoeing plane and caused
its crash. The engine cutting out, a
badly located airport, and lack of alti
tude.
"If the public Is ever to become
air-minded all of this high-powered
stretching of facts must bo stopped,
without the airplane, this country
will not go very far in the way of high
speed transportation. The answer to
this situation lies in either educating
the press to give the details right, or
else in teaching the public to believe
only about one-tenth of what they
read as regards airplane accidents."
"Any airplane accident can happen
today, nobody will be hurt, and yet
tomorrow morning just about every
newspaper in the land will have two
inch headlines about the matter."
Thus did Professor E. G. Reid, of the
Aeronautics School, give his opinion
of the unfortunate accident which
befell the Boeing tri-motor plane
which was destroyed by fire just out
side of Elko on Wednesday morning.

Newspaper dispatches gave the fol
lowing account, "Diving earthward
like a huge firebrand, a Boeing tri
motored plane, piloted by Hugh Bar
ker, made a forced landing in the
sagebrush just outside of Elko, Nev.,
after the left motor had given out.
Abe Warner, co-pilot, had the cabin
door open before the blazing plane
came to a stop and the passengers
clambered to safety on the ground.
The plane was 2000 feet in the air
