# Endurance Plane Going Strong At Hundredth Hour
## Motor Purrs Smoothly, But Both Pilots Are Tiring; 10 Refuelings Made 
### 
FORT WORTH, Texas, May 23. (/P)
â€”The civilian endurance plane Fort
Worth, with more than 100 hours of
sustained flying behind it, neared the
"stretch" of the 151 hours 40 minutes
and 15 seconds goal set by Pilot Reg
L. Robbins and his mechanic, James
Kelly, as dusk settled over the air
planes above this city for the fifth
time since the flight got under way
Sunday at 11:33 a.m.
The hundredth hour mark was
reached at 3:33 p.m. today. The next
historic mark to be equalled was the
flying time of the Graf Zeppelin re
corded at approximately lll 1 hours,
a record for that type of ship.
A* second mark to be passed some
hours later if all goes well was the
flying time of 118 hours established
by the ill-fated French dirigible Dix
mude. If successful, the Fort Worth
would be the first civilian ship to
pass the historic sustained flying
marks, although the army's Question
Mark laid them low.
The single motor in the rebuilt
Ryan continued to purr smoothly as
it had since the grind began at 11:33
a.m. Sunday. Robbins indicated he and
Kelly were fatigued when a note he
dropped, said: "The motor and the
ship are in good shape and we are
a little tired, but won't let it bother
us."
Ten times since it took off the en
durance plane has been refueled in
the air. On each occasion the Fort
Worth and the refueling plane flew
to within twenty feet of one another
