# POWERFUL TRACK TEAM LEAVES TODAY TO DEFEND I.C.4-A. TITLE
## Fourteen Cardinals Will Make Trip to Philadelphia; Seven Men Are Veterans of Last Year's Championship Squad; Stanford Primed for Third Win 
### FRANK WHITELEY 
Fourteen Cardinal tracksters, accompanied by Coach Dink Templeton and
Manager Don Hamblin, will leave this afternoon for Philadelphia to defend their
twice-won title in the fifty-third 1.C.4-A. championships May 31 and June 1.
The Cards will entrain at 4:27 p.m. at Oakland on the Pacific Limited for Chi
cago, and will arrive in Philadelphia at 5:55 p.m. Tuesday. This will allow them
several days of practice before the meet starts on May 31. Word has been received
from its mayor that Harrisburgh, capital of Pennsylvania, will tender the Stanford
team an official reception on its arrival in that city.
Stanford, because of its impressive 43-25 point victory in the 1.C.4-A. meet last
year, is the clean-cut favorite to repeat again this year and for the eighth time in
nine years to secure the national title for the Pacific Coast. California has won the
1.C.4-A. trophy three times since 1920, U.S.C. twice, and Stanford twice.

Stanford can count on about thirty
points with the possibility of ten more
being scored. Eric Krenz, captain-elect
of the Cardinal team and double winner
in the shot and discus at Boston last year,
is favored to take the discus and place
second to his teammate, Harlow Rothert,
in the shot. Krenz's chief competition in
the discus will come from Anderson of
Cornell and Weicker of Yale, both mem
bers of the 1028 American Olympic team.
Between them Krenz and Rothert should
score fourteen points, and possibly more,
depending on Rothert's performance in
the discus.
Captain Ross Nichols, victor in the
120-yard high hurdles in the Boston
1.C.4-A.'s, should repeat his win next
Saturday. The Stanford leader stepped
out and won the high barrier event in the
Pacific Coast Relays in Fresno three
weeks ago in 14 3-5 s., which indicated
what he is capable of this season. Collier
of Brown, who placed third in the Am
sterdam Olympic Games, should press
Nichols to the limit.

Podge Smith, sophomore hurdler, has
been a consistent 15-second man all year
and should be good for a point or two
at Philadelphia. Templeton will prob
ably use him only in the highs.
Then there is Ward Edmonds, who has
twice won points for Stanford in the
pole vault in 1.C.4-A. competition and has
been high point man in every meet he
has competed in this year. Dink has not
decided as yet in what events he will use
Ward. He is almost a certainty to com
pete in the pole vault, in which event he
will be an even favorite with Williams
of U.S.C. and Sturdy of Yale; and it is
likely that he will be entered in the high
hurdles as well. His performances in the
lows have been better this season than in
