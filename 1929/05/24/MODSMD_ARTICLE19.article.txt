# ROMANO'S EDITORIAL BACKS DENOUNCEMENT OF EINSTEIN THEORIES

### 
VATICAN CITY, May 23. (&)â€”Ob
servatore Romano in an editorial to
day says that Cardinal O'Connell of
Boston was perfectly right in denounc
ing the theories of Dr. Albert Einstein
recently.
The paper, which is used by the
Vatican frequently for official an
nouncements, commends the Ameri
can Cardinal, declaring that in the
professor's theories was a "tendency
to cut off faith in God from human
life. This is authentic atheism even
if camouflaged as cosmic pantheism."
In an address at Boston last month
Cardinal O'Connell warned the New
England province of the Catholic
clubs of America against Dr. Ein
stein's theory of relativity as "be
fogged speculation producing univer
sal doubt about God and his creation,"
and "cloaking the ghastly apparition
of atheism."
Dr. Einstein, when told of the
Cardinal's statement, said that it left
him cold and devoid of interest, adding
that he was wholly disinclined to
enter into a controversy with the
Cardinal. Rabbi Herbert S. Goldstein
of New York later made public a mes
sage he had received from Dr. Ein
stein, saying: "I believe in Spinoza's
God who reveals himself in the or
derly harmony in being, not in God
who deals with the fates and actions
of men."
