# Roos Bros. Annual Punting Contest To Be Wednesday
## 
### 
The best kickers on Pop Warner's
spring football squad will make a noble
effort to "boot" the pigskin out of sight
or farther next Wednesday afternoon
when the annual punting contest for the
Roos Brothers trophy will be held 011 the
varsity field.
Ltid Frentrup, who has won the con
test for the past two years, is favored
to repeat his performances. Harlow Ro
thcrt, who was conceded a chance to up
set Frentrup, will l>e in the East with the
track team, so the blond halfback should
have clear sailing. In the event that
Frentrup does win, lie will get perma
nent possession of the trophy.
