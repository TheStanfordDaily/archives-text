# Clearing A Moot Point

"In the light conversation" of its editorial column the Palo Alto
Times considered a portion of an editorial appearing in this column
Wednesday, and considered that portion as it saw fit.
The point made by the Times is this, "An editorial in the Stanford
Daily indicates that according to the student viewpoint the university
exists for sports."
Now it's a shame to disagree with so established and mature a journal
as the Palo Alto Times, but when that stentorian mouthpiece of the city
of Palo Alto deliberately misrepresents an argument of the Daily, it
cannot refrain from registering slight displeasure. Of course one should
never register displeasure when one is misrepresented, but then, we are
young; the Palo Alto Times reeks with age and experience.
It would be futile to set down what the Daily really believes in this
matter, because the Palo Alto Times could never understand. The Daily
s{>eaks a different tongue. But just to make an effort, inarticulate though
it may be, the following is presented.
From the Daily editorial, used to such excellent advantage by the
Times, the following is quoted, "It can be pointed out that athletics after
all is an extra-curricular activity and that the University is not built
for the production of Ail-American athletes and winning teams. But that
argument loses a little bit of its sparkle when those little practical matters
of revenue from sports and prestige from intercollegiate competition are
mentioned."
The Daily is very young, very immature, but it is convinced that an
extra-curricular activity that nets the University a nice little annual nest
egg of half a million dollars is not to be sneered at, nor does it believe
that the producer of this aforementioned pittance should run the Uni
versity, nor that the University should be run so that the producer of this
little sum might continue to lay its nest-eggs, but what sort of a practical
man is it that would cut out an annual, assured income such as is derived
from athletics simply because he believed it unacademic?
If Stanford were rolling in wealth, if it were a gigantic laboratory
wherein nothing but the deepest intricacies of pure and undefiled study
were its raison d'etre, then athletics should be abolished. But Stanford
is not this. This is not the conception of the American university which
it is believed Stanford typifies. So, with athletics an established phase of
the University life, why suddenly rise up and cast it out?

Allow the Daily, estimable and accurate Palo Alto Times, to inform
you of its opinion. It does not believe that the University should be or
is run for athletics. Is that plain enough? It does not believe that stu
dent opinion believes the University should be or is run for athletics. Is
that also clear? And it does believe that the abolition of athletics, unless
the entire conception of the University is revised, would be a grievous
error as unwise as the brash, but oft-referred-to lad who killed the well
known golden-egg laying goose.

Nor must athletics look alone to its ability to buy dormitories, endow
ments, and new women's gymnasiums for its excuse to be a part of the
University. Intercollegiate competition gives the University wider re
nown and more prestige than any of the extra-curricular activities it
fosters. And of course the benefit to the individual participant cannot
be measured any more than the fame it gives the University, but this
alone should be justification for athletics. The Daily hopes it has made
itself clear.

young; the Palo Alto Times reeks with age and experience.
It would be futile to set down what the Daily really believes in this
matter, because the Palo Alto Times could never understand. The Daily
s{>eaks a different tongue. But just to make an effort, inarticulate though
it may be, the following is presented.
From the Daily editorial, used to such excellent advantage by the
Times, the following is quoted, "It can be pointed out that athletics after
all is an extra-curricular activity and that the University is not built
for the production of Ail-American athletes and winning teams. But that
argument loses a little bit of its sparkle when those little practical matters
of revenue from sports and prestige from intercollegiate competition are
mentioned."
The Daily is very young, very immature, but it is convinced that an
extra-curricular activity that nets the University a nice little annual nest
egg of half a million dollars is not to be sneered at, nor does it believe
that the producer of this aforementioned pittance should run the Uni
versity, nor that the University should be run so that the producer of this
little sum might continue to lay its nest-eggs, but what sort of a practical
man is it that would cut out an annual, assured income such as is derived
from athletics simply because he believed it unacademic?
If Stanford were rolling in wealth, if it were a gigantic laboratory
wherein nothing but the deepest intricacies of pure and undefiled study
were its raison d'etre, then athletics should be abolished. But Stanford
is not this. This is not the conception of the American university which
it is believed Stanford typifies. So, with athletics an established phase of
the University life, why suddenly rise up and cast it out?

Allow the Daily, estimable and accurate Palo Alto Times, to inform
you of its opinion. It does not believe that the University should be or
is run for athletics. Is that plain enough? It does not believe that stu
dent opinion believes the University should be or is run for athletics. Is
that also clear? And it does believe that the abolition of athletics, unless
the entire conception of the University is revised, would be a grievous
error as unwise as the brash, but oft-referred-to lad who killed the well
known golden-egg laying goose.

Nor must athletics look alone to its ability to buy dormitories, endow
ments, and new women's gymnasiums for its excuse to be a part of the
University. Intercollegiate competition gives the University wider re
nown and more prestige than any of the extra-curricular activities it
fosters. And of course the benefit to the individual participant cannot
be measured any more than the fame it gives the University, but this
alone should be justification for athletics. The Daily hopes it has made
itself clear.
"In the light conversation" of its editorial column the Palo Alto
Times considered a portion of an editorial appearing in this column
Wednesday, and considered that portion as it saw fit.
The point made by the Times is this, "An editorial in the Stanford
Daily indicates that according to the student viewpoint the university
exists for sports."
Now it's a shame to disagree with so established and mature a journal
as the Palo Alto Times, but when that stentorian mouthpiece of the city
of Palo Alto deliberately misrepresents an argument of the Daily, it
cannot refrain from registering slight displeasure. Of course one should
never register displeasure when one is misrepresented, but then, we are
young; the Palo Alto Times reeks with age and experience.
