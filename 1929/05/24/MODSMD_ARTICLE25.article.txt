# Husband Fails To Provide Three Hour Bride' Divorces
## 
### 
RENO, May 23 (#>). â€”After two trips
across the continent in search of his
bride, who he claimed had been spirited
away from him three hours after their
marriage, Joseph B. Foster, youthful in
surance adjuster, lost her for good in the
divorce court here today. The wife was
Mary Jones Foster, daughter of H. W. C.
Jones, retired railroad financier of New
York. He came here to fight the case,
but said it could all lx: settled if he could
talk to her alone for a few minutes.
This conference took place today in the
sheriff's office and the bride told Foster,
he admitted, that she did not care for
him. Mrs. Foster was given a divorce
on grounds of failure to provide.
