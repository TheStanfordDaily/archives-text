## STRANGE INTERLUDECOLUMBIA 
### 
Clinical study, O'Neillesque white ele
phant, boresome string of dialogues and
asides, indecent claptrap, immoral and
impossible, such comments have filled the
critical columns of the San Francisco
newspapers on the current presentation
of Strange Interlude, Eugene O'Neill's
nine-act tragedy.
George Jean Nathan, when the play
was first written and before it was pro
duced, wrote a veritable panegyric laud
ing it as the first and greatest of mod
ern American dramas. There you have
the opposing points of view on this
slrnnge Strange Interlude.
Having read the play, having read
endlesj criticism of it, and having
thought over it considerably, the writer
anticipated its production with keen in
terest. He is confessedly an admirer of
O'Neill; hence his criticism may be
prejudiced. But after sitting through
the six-hour play, he still finds himself a
keen admirer of O'Neill and believes as
when he read the play that it is an ex
cellent piece of work.
From the point of view of what is a
drama in the classical sense of the word,
it is undoubtedly long and unusual. For,
so long have people thought of drama in
two to three-hour lumps that when a new
type is presented which entails their con
centrating their mental attention for
more than that prescribed two to three
hours, they become exceedingly piqued
and like little children in the old-time
long-winded Methodist preacher's church,
they squirm in their seats, make extreme
ly funny remarks to one another, yawn,
stretch, and are terribly bored. Like chil
dren they are incapable of thinking for
more than a brief time, and then they
must be moving, moving where it doesn't
matter, so long as they are moving.
A foreigner characterized America as
a circus for grown-up children. Had he
witnessed the reaction of many people in
the audience during the production of
this play ,he would have been in some
doubt as to whether these adult Ameri
cans had grown up yet.
But that does not concern the play it
self. A finer group of talented actors
has not been seen in San Francisco for
many years than that group which is
now presenting the O'Neill play. With
out an exception, each member of the cast
interprets his part with rarest skill. One
character, that of Nina, the protagonist
of the play, might bear certain censure.
Her voice and attitude did not portray
the softness and the grace that it seems
that character should have had. For ex
ample, when Nina first feels the quicken
ing of her child within her, there follows
a reverie that is very beautiful. Judith
Anderson made of this reverie a harsh
sort of thing, by the very tone of her
voice.
The remainder of the cast was suited
each to his role excellently. Charles
Marsden enacted by Ralph Morgan lived
and aged before your eyes. His under
standing of the character and his por
trayal were of the finest. The characters
of Dr. Darrell and Sam Evans were the

flesh and blood of the O'Neill conception, j
As to this matter of what of the play, |
itself. Who is to term it immoral, or
not a fine drama? What of the Greek
tragedies? Did they tell of the moral,
normal side of life? Did they draw the |
line at the abnormal or the unusual? Is ;
there anything more normal in the action j
of Oedipus than in that of Nina Leeds
Evans? Oedipus may have been more
the victim of blind chance, yet how much
did Nina have to do with the shaping of j
her life? Circumstances brought Ocdi- j
pus to marry his mother; what else!
brought Nina to marry the son of a fam- j
ily possessing a streak of insanity in its j
blood ?
The play is frank, but not vulgar. It,
in revealing the thoughts of its charac
ters, broaches upon topics not found in
ordinary conversation, but most certainly I
found in ordinary thought, O'Neill to i
this writer has created a great work. He
has intertwined and subtly linked the
lives of a group with such delicacy, with
such truthfulness, and with such under
standing that despite the bulkiness and
non-conformity to traditional dramatic
form, of his play, his work cannot be
called other than great.
Critics have declared that the play
contains not one whit of the spiritual or
the finer aspect of living. Perhaps it
doesn't, yet doesn't the tragedy of the
lives of its characters strike the truth as
nothing else could that their lives were
futile, were tragic for no other reason
than that they considered themselves in
the scientific light of guinea pigs to be
prodded and made to react as simple cells
under a microscope. They believed that
they could from a wholly rational point
of view experiment with human life and
ignore that intangible, still to be under
stood thing, the human soul, and obtain
a mathematical exact result in their ex
perimentation. This to the writer's mind
was the tragedy of the play, the tragedy
that raised it and made of it a great
work. It proved to him conclusively that
life is more beautiful than theory and
that all the theory of the materialistic
philosopher and the scientific investigator
has not as yet touched upon the deepest
mainsprings of human life.

anticipated its production with keen in
terest. He is confessedly an admirer of
O'Neill; hence his criticism may be
prejudiced. But after sitting through
the six-hour play, he still finds himself a
keen admirer of O'Neill and believes as
when he read the play that it is an ex
cellent piece of work.
From the point of view of what is a
drama in the classical sense of the word,
it is undoubtedly long and unusual. For,
so long have people thought of drama in
two to three-hour lumps that when a new
type is presented which entails their con
centrating their mental attention for
more than that prescribed two to three
hours, they become exceedingly piqued
and like little children in the old-time
long-winded Methodist preacher's church,
they squirm in their seats, make extreme
ly funny remarks to one another, yawn,
stretch, and are terribly bored. Like chil
dren they are incapable of thinking for
more than a brief time, and then they
must be moving, moving where it doesn't
matter, so long as they are moving.
A foreigner characterized America as
a circus for grown-up children. Had he
witnessed the reaction of many people in
the audience during the production of
this play ,he would have been in some
doubt as to whether these adult Ameri
cans had grown up yet.
But that does not concern the play it
self. A finer group of talented actors
has not been seen in San Francisco for
many years than that group which is
now presenting the O'Neill play. With
out an exception, each member of the cast
interprets his part with rarest skill. One
character, that of Nina, the protagonist
of the play, might bear certain censure.
Her voice and attitude did not portray
the softness and the grace that it seems
that character should have had. For ex
ample, when Nina first feels the quicken
ing of her child within her, there follows
a reverie that is very beautiful. Judith
Anderson made of this reverie a harsh
sort of thing, by the very tone of her
voice.
The remainder of the cast was suited
each to his role excellently. Charles
Marsden enacted by Ralph Morgan lived
and aged before your eyes. His under
standing of the character and his por
trayal were of the finest. The characters
of Dr. Darrell and Sam Evans were the

flesh and blood of the O'Neill conception, j
As to this matter of what of the play, |
itself. Who is to term it immoral, or
not a fine drama? What of the Greek
tragedies? Did they tell of the moral,
normal side of life? Did they draw the |
line at the abnormal or the unusual? Is ;
there anything more normal in the action j
of Oedipus than in that of Nina Leeds
Evans? Oedipus may have been more
the victim of blind chance, yet how much
did Nina have to do with the shaping of j
her life? Circumstances brought Ocdi- j
pus to marry his mother; what else!
brought Nina to marry the son of a fam- j
ily possessing a streak of insanity in its j
blood ?
The play is frank, but not vulgar. It,
in revealing the thoughts of its charac
ters, broaches upon topics not found in
ordinary conversation, but most certainly I
found in ordinary thought, O'Neill to i
this writer has created a great work. He
has intertwined and subtly linked the
lives of a group with such delicacy, with
such truthfulness, and with such under
standing that despite the bulkiness and
non-conformity to traditional dramatic
form, of his play, his work cannot be
called other than great.
Critics have declared that the play
contains not one whit of the spiritual or
the finer aspect of living. Perhaps it
doesn't, yet doesn't the tragedy of the
lives of its characters strike the truth as
nothing else could that their lives were
futile, were tragic for no other reason
than that they considered themselves in
the scientific light of guinea pigs to be
prodded and made to react as simple cells
under a microscope. They believed that
they could from a wholly rational point
of view experiment with human life and
ignore that intangible, still to be under
stood thing, the human soul, and obtain
a mathematical exact result in their ex
perimentation. This to the writer's mind
was the tragedy of the play, the tragedy
that raised it and made of it a great
work. It proved to him conclusively that
life is more beautiful than theory and
that all the theory of the materialistic
philosopher and the scientific investigator
has not as yet touched upon the deepest
mainsprings of human life.

long-winded Methodist preacher's church,
they squirm in their seats, make extreme
ly funny remarks to one another, yawn,
stretch, and are terribly bored. Like chil
dren they are incapable of thinking for
more than a brief time, and then they
must be moving, moving where it doesn't
matter, so long as they are moving.
A foreigner characterized America as
a circus for grown-up children. Had he
witnessed the reaction of many people in
the audience during the production of
this play ,he would have been in some
doubt as to whether these adult Ameri
cans had grown up yet.
But that does not concern the play it
self. A finer group of talented actors
has not been seen in San Francisco for
many years than that group which is
now presenting the O'Neill play. With
out an exception, each member of the cast
interprets his part with rarest skill. One
character, that of Nina, the protagonist
of the play, might bear certain censure.
Her voice and attitude did not portray
the softness and the grace that it seems
that character should have had. For ex
ample, when Nina first feels the quicken
ing of her child within her, there follows
a reverie that is very beautiful. Judith
Anderson made of this reverie a harsh
sort of thing, by the very tone of her
voice.
The remainder of the cast was suited
each to his role excellently. Charles
Marsden enacted by Ralph Morgan lived
and aged before your eyes. His under
standing of the character and his por
trayal were of the finest. The characters
of Dr. Darrell and Sam Evans were the

flesh and blood of the O'Neill conception, j
As to this matter of what of the play, |
itself. Who is to term it immoral, or
not a fine drama? What of the Greek
tragedies? Did they tell of the moral,
normal side of life? Did they draw the |
line at the abnormal or the unusual? Is ;
there anything more normal in the action j
of Oedipus than in that of Nina Leeds
Evans? Oedipus may have been more
the victim of blind chance, yet how much
did Nina have to do with the shaping of j
her life? Circumstances brought Ocdi- j
pus to marry his mother; what else!
brought Nina to marry the son of a fam- j
ily possessing a streak of insanity in its j
blood ?
The play is frank, but not vulgar. It,
in revealing the thoughts of its charac
ters, broaches upon topics not found in
ordinary conversation, but most certainly I
found in ordinary thought, O'Neill to i
this writer has created a great work. He
has intertwined and subtly linked the
lives of a group with such delicacy, with
such truthfulness, and with such under
standing that despite the bulkiness and
non-conformity to traditional dramatic
form, of his play, his work cannot be
called other than great.
Critics have declared that the play
contains not one whit of the spiritual or
the finer aspect of living. Perhaps it
doesn't, yet doesn't the tragedy of the
lives of its characters strike the truth as
nothing else could that their lives were
futile, were tragic for no other reason
than that they considered themselves in
the scientific light of guinea pigs to be
prodded and made to react as simple cells
under a microscope. They believed that
they could from a wholly rational point
of view experiment with human life and
ignore that intangible, still to be under
stood thing, the human soul, and obtain
a mathematical exact result in their ex
perimentation. This to the writer's mind
was the tragedy of the play, the tragedy
that raised it and made of it a great
work. It proved to him conclusively that
life is more beautiful than theory and
that all the theory of the materialistic
philosopher and the scientific investigator
has not as yet touched upon the deepest
mainsprings of human life.

Clinical study, O'Neillesque white ele
phant, boresome string of dialogues and
asides, indecent claptrap, immoral and
impossible, such comments have filled the
critical columns of the San Francisco
newspapers on the current presentation
of Strange Interlude, Eugene O'Neill's
nine-act tragedy.
George Jean Nathan, when the play
was first written and before it was pro
duced, wrote a veritable panegyric laud
ing it as the first and greatest of mod
ern American dramas. There you have
the opposing points of view on this
slrnnge Strange Interlude.
Having read the play, having read
endlesj criticism of it, and having
thought over it considerably, the writer
anticipated its production with keen in
terest. He is confessedly an admirer of
O'Neill; hence his criticism may be
prejudiced. But after sitting through
the six-hour play, he still finds himself a
keen admirer of O'Neill and believes as
when he read the play that it is an ex
cellent piece of work.
From the point of view of what is a
drama in the classical sense of the word,
it is undoubtedly long and unusual. For,
so long have people thought of drama in
two to three-hour lumps that when a new
type is presented which entails their con
centrating their mental attention for
more than that prescribed two to three
hours, they become exceedingly piqued
and like little children in the old-time
long-winded Methodist preacher's church,
they squirm in their seats, make extreme
ly funny remarks to one another, yawn,
