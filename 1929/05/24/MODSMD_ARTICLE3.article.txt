# BIDS FOR '29 BALL GO ON SALE TODAY AT A.S.S.U. OFFICE
## 
### 
Bids for the Senior Ball, which
will begin Friday night, June 14, and
end Saturday, go on sale today at
the A.S.S.U. offices in the Old
Union at $10 each, according to a
statement made last night by Hub
Moffitt, chairman of the Senior
Ball committee.
Plans are rapidly progressing for
making this year's ball the best in
history. The programs, which have
already been ordered, are more
elaborate than any which have ever
been used before. The ball will be
held in the Toyon ballroom, which
is by far the best floor on the
campus.
The number of bids to be sold is
limited to 175.
