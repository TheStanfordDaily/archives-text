## 
### 
LAREDO, Tex., May 23 (/P).—Acconi
panied by an escort of twenty soldiers
from the staff of President Portes Gil
of Mexico, Dwight W. Morrow, United
States Ambassador to Mexico, reached
here late today from Mexico City.

Although the ambassador said he was
making a "vacation trip" home, he gave
the impression that he had returned to
the United States for the marriage of
his daughter, Anne, to Colonel Charles
A. Lindl)ergh. The soldiers on the spe
cial car, he said, were sent by the Mexi
can government "merely as a courtesy."
Although Morrow told newspaper men
he was "not to be quoted on any matters
of state," he said the marriage of his
daughter and the flyer of New York to
Paris fame "will take place while I am
on this trip north."
He said he would go directly to his
home at Englewood, N.J., without visit
ing Washington. He declined to discuss
the Mexican revolution. The rebels fre
quently have attacked Morrow and his
policies. The opinion was expressed here
that the soldiers might have been on the
car to protect the ambassador against a
possible attack, since conditions still are
unsettled in portions of Mexico.
