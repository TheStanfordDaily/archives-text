### 
CHICAGO. May 23 (£>).—Mrs. Catha
rine Kozial was afraid her 11-year-old
son, Louis, would hurt himself with the
family revolver which he had discovered
under the mattress.
"No, no," Louis," she said, taking the
gun from him. "You might shoot your
self."
As she fumbled with the mechanism,
seeking to remove the shells, the gun was
discharged and the bullet buried itself
in the boy's body, above the heart. He
may die.
