ANENT TROY AND
THE BEARS
Some rather unkind things have
been said in this worthy sheet, and
in others, concerning the spirit of
Stanford's two greatest rival institu
tions —U.S.C. and the University of
California.
Maybe such cracks were justified
at the time they were made. Maybe
they weren't. We won't argue that
now.
Whether justified or not, they
are past and better forgotten.
What is interesting just now is
something entirely different;
something that refreshes a lag
ging belief in collegiate sports
manship.
It all grew out of that comedy
of blocks staged in Los Angeles'
white pillared Coliseum last Sat
urday when Stanford "lost" a
quadrangular track meet to Dean
Cromwell's Sons of Troy.
By "winning the contest U.S.C.
gained possession of some sort of an
award —exact proportions and de
scription unknown. It is alleged to be
a very pretty piece of hardware, how
ever, and one that would look good
in anybody's trophy room.
Comes now word from the Trojan
campus that loyal sons of U.S.C. are
demanding that the award be sent
prepaid to "Dink" Templeton & Co.,
because the Cardinal men were right
ful winners, they say. That, we ven
ture to remark, is a very pretty ges
ture. Even those who have been
loudest in panning the Southerners
must admit that upon this occasion
U.S.C. isn't lacking in the finer shades
of sportsmanship.
And in this same connection,
members of Templeton'? relay
team report that the Bear run
ners, who "won" the race because
No. 1 man for the Cards used
starting blocks, came around af
terward and offered to give their
medals to the disqualified Stan
ford quartet.
Another pretty gesture.
