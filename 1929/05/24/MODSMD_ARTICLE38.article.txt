SYRACUSE, N.Y., May 23. (/P)â€”
Birth control and companionate mar
i riage are not new, but have been in
; existence since the dark ages, accord
ding to Louis K. Anspacher, who lec
tured before the Syracuse Federation
of Women's Clubs recently.
Apropos of woman's status, both in
! the past and at present, Anspacher
made such remarks as: "The more
clothes women wear, the less moral
the sex is The Spartans wore
no clothing, and were the happiest,
j most moral people in ancient times."
"Woman is the race. She is the life
j stream. The masculine sex is more a
| biological incident than anything else.
Out of woman comes man, and that is
the essence of her power I see
a new era when men and women will
be equal in individuality .... with
j each making individual and neces
j sary contributions to exalt the race."
