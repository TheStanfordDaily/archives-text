# PRATT SAYS STATE RAINFALL SHORTAGE ENDANGERS FORESTS
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, May 23. (/P)â€”
Shortage of rainfall and snow in the
mountains (luring the past winter
months threatens an unusually hazard
ous field and forest fire situation dur
ing the current dry season, M. B.
Pratt, state forester, declared here
today.
Despite this, fire losses may be lower
than suffered last year, Pratt said,
because fourteen additional patrolmen
have been added to California's fire
fighting brigade under an agreement
with the federal government whereby
the United States general land office
pays the salaries of the men.
The state fire hazard period extends
from May 15 to Oct. 31. During the
latter month the majority of conflagra
tions occur along the coast. This is
believed due to strong northerly or
southerly west winds prevailing dur
ing that month.
Pratt and W. B. Rider, his assistant,
feel that if motorists, hikers, campers,
and others guard carefully against
leaving extinguished their cigars,
cigarettes, pipe ashes, and camp fires,
the record of conflagrations in 1929
will not duplicate the 1928 losses,
1,100,000 acres of timber, brush, and
grain lands burned and several mil
lions of dollars wasted.
The new members of the state fire
patrol are to have particular care of
public domain areas. There are more
than 20,000 acres of such unappro
priated lands in the state, Pratt said,
which the state has heretofore borne
the expense of protecting.
