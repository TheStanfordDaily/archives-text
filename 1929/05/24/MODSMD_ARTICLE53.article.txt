### 
MOSCOW, May 23.
events of more than passing import
ance to the future of the Soviet Union
have transpired within the past few
days.
Alexis Ivanovitch Rykoff has re
signed his post as president of the
Council of People's Commissars of the
Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Re
public (R.S.F.S.R.), the principal So
viet Republic of the Russian Soviet
Union.
M. Rykoff, however, still retains his
post as president of the Council of
People's Commissions of the Union,
or the Union of Socialist Soviet Re
publics (U.S.S.R.) as it is called. This
latter post carries with it authority
over Ukraine, R.S.F.S.R., White Rus
sia, Transcontinental Russia, etc.,
while the post given up concerned only
the R.S.F.S.R., or what might be
called, Russia-in-Europe-Proper.

The entrance to a still in Omaha
was found to be "Santa Claus style"
â€”a chimney was the only opening.
