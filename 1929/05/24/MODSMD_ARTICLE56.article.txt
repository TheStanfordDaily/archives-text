# CORNELL PROFESSOR REVEALS RESULTS OF RECENT BRAIN STUDY
## 
### 
Important facts on the relative im
portance of the size and shape of the
brain have recently been made public
in a study by Dr. J. W. Papez of Cor
nell University, of the brain of Dr.
11. G. Wilder, former Cornell profes
sor, and of the late Helen H. Gardener,
noted feminist. The claims of many
distinguished women, "That the brain
of a woman need not be inferior to
that of a man's" was confirmed and
also that the size of a brain is no
measure of intellect.

The greater the length and depth
of the furrows in the frontal, occipital,
and temporal regions appears to show
that these local developments favor
in a very important way the acquisi
tion of cultural and scholastic habits.

Dr. Wilder's brain showed a splen
did development in the speech area
which is located in the back part of
the brain, and in the center of hear
ing located in the temporal region,
the brain yielded large relative dimen
sions. Musical and literary abilities are
supposed in some way to be depend
ent on this endowment. In the brain
of Helen H. Gardener, who was not
musical, the temporal measurements
do not indicate a development above
the average.
A vehement abhorrance of tobacco
smoke in any form was explained be
cause Wilder's brain showed an
olfactory center which is devoted to
the function of smell.
Dr. Wilder's brain is now a part of
a large collection assembled at Cor
nell University of some 1600 speci
mens which include, in addition to
the brains of human adults and chil
dren, those of apes, monkeys, and
other mammals and vertebrates.
