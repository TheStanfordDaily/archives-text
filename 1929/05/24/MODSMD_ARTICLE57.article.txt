# "Cop-Killers" Strike Two Aces From Chicago Force

### 
CHICAGO, May 23. (/P)— "Cop-kil
leis," most despised of murderers
under the policeman's code, have with
in a week struck two aces from the
Chicago force, an unusual circum
stance in a city where gunmen have
been cautious heretofore about pulling
the trigger against men wearing stars.
Gang murders come and go, crime
grist in the police working day; but
"cop-killing" strikes anger and a de
termination for vengeance throughout
♦.he force. The. killing yesterday of
Detective Sullivan was looked upon
as a particularly severe blow, not only
because Sullivan was one of the aces
of the squad which has been working
on the Valentine's Day gang massa
cre, but because he also was on the
trail of men who killed Detective
Lawrence Martin last week.
