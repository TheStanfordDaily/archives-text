# ILLINOIS LEGISLATORS DOUBT FEDERAL RIGHT TO CONTROL ALCOHOL
## 
### 
SPRINGFIELD, 111., May 23. (>p)—
The Illinois House of Representatives
lias challenged the power of Congress
to control medicinal and Industrial
alcohol and non-intoxicating beverages
by passage of a bill directing the
Attorney General to bring suit in the
United States Supreme Court to de
cide what state rights had been
granted Congress with ratification of
the 18th Amendment. The vote, taken
last night, was 69 to 52.

The Supreme Court decided recent
ly in a suit brought by an individual
that the state specifically granted con
trol of alcoholic beverages to Con
gress and implied the granting of con
trol of other alcohols and beverages.
Representative Leßoy Green, of Rock
ford, 111., sponsor of the House bill,
declared he believed a suit brought
by a state would have more weight
with the Supreme Court than one in
stituted by an individual.
