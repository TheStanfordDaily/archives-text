LOS ANGELES, May 22. (£>)— An
injunction suit to halt the operation
of airplanes at the Grand Central air
terminal, Glendale, was brought in
superior court today by Mrs. Clare
Ulbright. She contended that the
property, on which her home adjoins,
is a residence district and its use as
an airport prohibited under the zon
ing laws. Annoyances to which she
was subject were listed as follows:
Flashing of landing lights, noise of
motors, objects being dropped from
planes in the air, and the possibility
of an airplane crashing through a
residence roof.
The case was taken under advise
ment until May 28.
The terminal is used by the Pick
wick and Maddux Air Lines.
