Keep your eye on anybody named
Anderson, especially if that "Andy"
decides to go out for honors in sports.
For the clan of Anderson (call 'em
the Clandersons, if you will) invar
iably succeeds in athletics, and a long
list of those bearing that famous name
who have reached the top in golf,
tennis, track, and other sports is mute
evidence of this success.
Right now three Andersons are
starring in track and field sports.
"Steve" Anderson, of the University
of Washington, will be hopping a
rattler for Chicago soon to take part
in the annual National Collegiate
meet. "Steve" is one of the country's
best hurdlers; in fact, he was the
country's very best high hurdler at
the final Olympic tryouts in Boston
last year, and at the games in Am
sterdam, where he placed second to

| Atkinson, of South Africa. This spring
he beat Ross Nichols, the 1.C.4-A.
champion, in an 80-yard indoor race,
in Seattle, and also won the low hur
dles.
John P. Anderson, of Cornell, who
placed fifth in the Olympic discus
throw and won the indoor intercolle
giate shotput crown in March, is
throwing the discus far enough to
scare Eric Krenz, outdoor 1.C.4-A.
champion and unofficial world's rec
ord-holder. "Andy" threw 150 feet, 3
inches at the Penn relays, and at the
Ohio relays threw the Greek pie-plate
i 157 feet, 5% inches, just eight inches
short of Hud Houser's accepted world
I mark.
Another Anderson, Ovie, of Finland,
who placed third in the Olympic 3,000-
meter steeplechase race, won the
Metropolitan A.A.U. ten-mile cham
j pionship on Sunday, May 12.
