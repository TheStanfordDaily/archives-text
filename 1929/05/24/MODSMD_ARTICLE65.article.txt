### 
FRESNO, May 23. (JP)â€”The fire- i
house burned down today. Or at least
one of them did, old chemical No. 1,
used for storage purposes in recent:
years. It started from a grass fire
against which the fire department has
been waging an educational campaign
recently. The alarm was turned in by |
L. A. Moore, Fresno's fire marshal, ;
who happened to be passing by. It '
was the first alarm Captain Moore had i
ever turned in, although he has an- j
swered thousands of them. Firemen j
figured the loss at $1500.
