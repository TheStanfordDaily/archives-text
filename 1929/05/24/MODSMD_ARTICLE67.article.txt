, Cantonese government has notified
* the foreign consular boily that the
I Kwangsi military movement against
the eity has collapsed with surrender
j of 5,000 Kwangsi troops at Lupao, 25

of the victory, which was said here
to have resulted in Kwangsi generals'
I failure to maintain their supplies and
i ammunition.
The Kwangsi attack, highly sue
! cessful at first, thus failed when Can-
