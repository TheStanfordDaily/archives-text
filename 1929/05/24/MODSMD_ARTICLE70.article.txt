### 
WASHINGTON, May 23. (/P) â€”' The
Senate occupied itself briefly today
iii debate of the bill for census taking
and congressional reapportionment,
with the principal interest attached
to the amendment of Senator Wagner,
Democrat, New York, to put all census
employees under Civil Service regula
tion.
As reported by the Senate commerce
committee, the measure provided spe
cifically that the director of census
could appoint the some 100,000
employees necessary to take the cen
bus without regard to the Civil Ser
vice laws.
Party Aid Feared
Wagner asserted that unless the
employees are put under Civil Ser
vice, "political leaders and bosses"
think will help their party. He de
will appoiut the enumerators they
clared that during the taking of one
census, political appointees failed to
count 200,000 citizens of New York
"in an effort to deprive that great
Democratic city from its proper repre
sentation."
A vote on the Wagner amendment
Is expected to be taken tomorrow
and Senator Johnson, Republican, Cali
fornia, who is in charge of the bill,
was hopeful that a final vote also
could be reached.
G.O.P. Opposition
The Wagner amendment was op
posed by Senator Burton, Republican,
Ohio, who contended it would result
in confusion. He asserted that when
the Democrats were "in control in
1919" they failed to put enumerators
under the Civil Service in the bill en
acted that year.
"Why did they wait until they were
in a minority to bring up this ques
tion?" he asked. "Not one syllable
was uttered in favor of the proposal
then, and a golden opportunity was
lost."
