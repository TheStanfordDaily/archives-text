# Senate Rule Does Not Bar Reporter From Press Box

### 
WASHINGTON, May 23. (/P)â€”ln
barring representatives of Press Asso
ciations from the privilege of going
on the floor of the Senate because
of a purported roll call printed by the
United Press Associations and de
scribed as inaccurate, the Senate did
not prohibit them from working in
their regularly assigned places in the
press gallery.
The gallery reserved for the press
is directly over the chair of the Vice-
President and faces all of the Sen
ators. The privilege of visiting the
floor is said to have been extended in
order that newspaper men might enter
the chamber and thus avoid having
to call Senators outside to ask them
various questions.
