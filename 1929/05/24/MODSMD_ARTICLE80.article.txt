# SUBMARINE'S "LUNG," NEW ESCAPE DEVICE, PROVES PRACTICABLE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 23. (#>)â€”'Tests
of the navy's new submarine escape
| device, "the lung," have demonstrated
i its practicability in escape from a sub
mersible helpless at a depth of 302
j feet.
The navy department announced
| today that tests, made in the Wash
ington navy yard diving tank, with
submarine officers of the S-4 using
the device, proved pressure could be
i built up in the tank to correspond
i with water pressure at a depth of 302
feet. None of the officers felt any ill
effects.
The lung was used in actual escape
from the rebuilt S-4 from a depth of
200 feet off Key West last winter.
Inasmuch as the S-4 was constructed
to withstand sea pressure of 200 feet
depth, tests of the lung in escape
i from greater depths necessarily were
made in the diving tank. New con
struction by all navies, it was ex
plained by t he navy department, tends
j toward greater test depths for subma-
I rines.
