# STUDENT REST HOMES DECLARED SUCCESSES BY HEALTH DIRECTORS
## 
### 
The Rest Homes for Stanford students
inaugurated this year as an experiment
under the auspices of the Mothers' Club
have been especially commended by l)r.
Clelia Mosher, Medical Adviser of
Women, and Dr. Harry Torrey, Director
of Student Health Service.
"The past few experimental months
have clearly demonstrated that there is a
place for such an institution on the Cam
pus to care for those students who are
tired, or convalescent, or mildly ill and
in need of a few days of quiet, comfort
able rest under homelike conditions,"
writes Dr. Torrey to the Mothers' Club.
Mrs. Owen has taken care of twenty
seven girls in the women's home this
year and Mrs. Morrison, who has charge
of the men's home, has bad approximate
ly twenty-two men. The students gener
ally pay for their room and board but,
with the financial aid of the Mothers'
Club, rest and care have been made pos
sible in several cases where it would not
have otherwise been given. The Club has
recently raised sufficient funds by pri
vate subscription to start the work next
fall.
