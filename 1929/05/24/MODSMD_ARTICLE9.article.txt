"Because it is founded on the ever
lasting principle that man must eat, the
Sequoia Eating Club will have no rea
son to fear that its existence will be
threatened in the way that political, so
cial, and economic conditions are," de
clared Professor Arthur M. Cathcart last
night before the ninth annual banquet of
the club.
"Although the engineers are destined to
be expert witnesses, I have no doubt that
the lawyers will have great ability to
search out the truth," continued Profes
sor Cathcart before the 160 members and
guests of the club gathered at the Car
dinal Hotel.
Dr. Charles Gardner offered words of
comfort to the students to cheer them in
the coming examinations. "Have no
fear," he said, "examinations are tests of
your knowledge, not of your ignorance."
Ferd Cummins was awarded a prize
of five dollars for his title as most popu
lar hasher for the year. William A. Glen
presided as toastmaster and relinquished
his position as manager of the club to
James Purcell, manager-elect.
A glee club quartet and an instrumental
