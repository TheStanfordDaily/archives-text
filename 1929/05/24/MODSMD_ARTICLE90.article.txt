# DEFERRED PAYMENT SCHEME FOR FRENCH DEBT IS ANTICIPATED
## 
### 
PARIS, May 23. (/P) —French politi
cal circles today looked for ratifica
tion by parliament soon of the Mellon-
Berenger debt accord of 1926, which
provided for a system of deferred pay
ments of France's debt to the United
States.
Heretofore much has depended
upon the outcome of the reparations
conference but it was understood Pre
mier Poincare would very ■ soon ask
Parliament's approval for the agree
ment which he himself has kept alive
for three years by adhering approxi
mately to its terms, even though it
had not been adopted formally.

The French government, unless the
debt accord is ratified, must pay the
United States $400,000,000 in August
on account of the surplus war stocks
purchased after the war. Should the
debt accord be ratified this sum would
be merged with its total and under
the deferred payment arrangement
thi3 year's payment would be only
$32,500,000.

The obvious advantages of this ar
rangement might le counted upon to
still much parliamentary opposition to
the agreement, observers here tonight,
said, even though a particularly bad
settlement or none at all was arrived
at by the reparations experts. In the
event of an advantageous reparations
settlement much of this opposition
would be removed automatically.

The courteous reminder understood
to have been given by the American
Secretary of State to Ambassador
Claudel at Washington that the agree
ment was remaining unusually long in
abeyance has been taken here in good
spirit, and with general recognition
that the time has come when some
thing must be done.
