# RIVALRY OF STANFORD, S.C. IS TALKIE THEME ON SOUTHERN CAMPUS
## 
### 
The Stanford-Southern
California rivalry will form the theme
of a talking picture, "College Days,"
being filmed on the Trojan campus
by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, according
to the Daily Trojan. The annual foot
ball game between the two universi
ties is the climax of the story, the
Big Game scenes having been taken
at the Stanford-U.S.C. game this fall.
Southern California students who
have taken part in the filming have
earned over $7000.
In regard to Sam Wood, the direc
tor, who is an experienced producer
of pictures dealing with college life,
the Daily Trojan says, "Mr. Wood in
this picture is attempting to produce
upon the screen a story of college life
that will not be chuck full of jazz-mad
youth gargling cocktails and necking
promiscuously upon the campus, and
furthermore the substitute will not
win the game in the final minutes of
play."
