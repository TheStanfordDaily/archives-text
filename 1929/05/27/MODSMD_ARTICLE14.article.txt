# FORT WORTH PLANE SETS RECORD; 173 HOURS IN AIR
## Endurance Craft Is Forced Down by Broken Propeller; Betters "Question Mark" 150-Hour Flight 
### Associated Press 
The week-end aerial derby, which
pioduced three flight record ventures,
was climaxed by the nearly Ryan
monoplane Fort Worth, piloted by R.
L. ltobbins and James Kelly, Texas
flyers. The Fort Worth came down at
4:05 p.m. Sunday after approximately
172% hours in the air, during which
time all endurance marks for air
planes and lighter than air craft were
shattered.
The old mark was surpassed Satur
day night at 7:13:15 o'clock at which
time the Fort Worth had been in the
air one hour longer than the flying
time of the army's tri-motored mono
plane Question Mark. The Fort \V r orth
was propelled by a single motor,
which never ceasea to function with
precision. The landing was forced be
cause of a strained propeller, dam
aged in a rainstorm while the ship
was flying in the vicinity of Dallas
Saturday night.
The monoplane, Miss Ranger, which
took off at Wichita, Kansas, at 8:54:30
a.m. Saturday on another endurance
attempt, had been aloft thirty-three
hours at 5:54:30 p.m. Sunday. The

| Cessna ship, piloted by Owen Haugh
j land and Gene Shank of Minnesota,
was headed northward Sunday after
noon for the flyers' home state. A
cruise from Minnesota to Ranger,
Texas —the city after which the ship
was named —was planned before the
flyers' return to the home airport for
the finish.
The solo flight, which got under
way at Los Angeles Saturday morn
ing at 5:15 o'clock, came to an end
early the next morning at 2:25 o'clock,
after Herbert J. Fahy had kept his
Lockheed Vega monoplane in the air
twenty-one hours and sixteen minutes.
Ho was attempting to break the
thirty-five hours thirty-three minutes,
twenty-one seconds' record established
unofficially last February by Martin
Jensen at New York. Bad weather
conditions forced the plane to earth.
At Old Orchard, Maine, two trans
atlantic flights were apparently in
prospect. The French ship, Yellow
Bird, was groomed for a trip to Eu
rope. The Green Flash, with Roger Q.
Williams and Lewis A. Yancey as
pilots, was in readiness for a takeoff
probably today.
