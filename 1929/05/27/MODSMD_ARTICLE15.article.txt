# CARD TEAM SPEEDING EASTWARD TO I.C.4-A.; WORKOUT IN NEVADA
## Stanford Men Have Car To Selves; Sparling First To Start Studying 
### 
ABOARD STANFORD SPECIAL, \
EN ROUTE TO PHILADELPHIA,
May 26. (/P) —The Stanford track
team, sixteen strong, is well under
way on its invasion of the East to at
tempt to cop the intercollegiate track
laurels for the third consecutive time.
At the same time Coach Dean
Cromwell and his Southern California
tracksters are speeding toward Phila
delphia farther south. One day nearer
Philadelphia, the scene of the j
I.C.A.A.A.A. championships, is the I
California team of six members under j
Walter Christie.
The East in the meantime is pre- j
paring to meet this powerful Western ;
threat with more concern than ever, j
for since 1920 only one Eastern team
has succeeded in capturing the inter
collegiate crown. Stanford is favored
to repeat its 1928 triumph and South
ern California and California are cer
tain to make a strong showing.
The first day passed practically
without incident for the Stanford
party. Many of the men are putting ;
their time to good use in study but j
there is always a card game of one [
kind or another in progress. Bill i
Sparling was the first man to open
his books and start to work. He was
pounding away on his typewriter
twenty minutes before the train left
the Oakland pier.
The team has the entire car to itself
and an air of complete informality
prevails as is the custom on trips.
The most popular costume is a blue
shirt, white linen knickers, and bed
room slippers.
They were awakened early this j
morning by the cackle of a flock of
chickens mingled occasionally with
the bark of a dog or the mew of a
cat. It was a most realistic perform
ance by Messrs. Tandy, McLeod, and
Rothert, but suddenly the antics of
this barnyard chorus was interrupted
by the plaintiff wail of a tiny baby
crying as though its heart would j
break. It was only when someone 1
looked in Virg Dowell's berth that the J
deception was realized. Virg may not
be a ventriloquist but he ceretainly j
put it over on most of the boys.
The team took it3 first workout at j
Carlin, Nevada. The weight men lim
bered up with the shot and discus
while (he men took a few exercises j
and ran up and down the platform. |
Everyone seems to be in the best of
spirits but all are anxious to make j
the time on the train pass as rapidly i
j as possible.

ABOARD STANFORD SPECIAL, \
EN ROUTE TO PHILADELPHIA,
May 26. (/P) —The Stanford track
team, sixteen strong, is well under
way on its invasion of the East to at
tempt to cop the intercollegiate track
laurels for the third consecutive time.
At the same time Coach Dean
Cromwell and his Southern California
tracksters are speeding toward Phila
delphia farther south. One day nearer
Philadelphia, the scene of the j
I.C.A.A.A.A. championships, is the I
California team of six members under j
Walter Christie.
The East in the meantime is pre- j
paring to meet this powerful Western ;
threat with more concern than ever, j
for since 1920 only one Eastern team
has succeeded in capturing the inter
collegiate crown. Stanford is favored
to repeat its 1928 triumph and South
ern California and California are cer
tain to make a strong showing.
The first day passed practically
without incident for the Stanford
party. Many of the men are putting ;
their time to good use in study but j
there is always a card game of one [
kind or another in progress. Bill i
Sparling was the first man to open
his books and start to work. He was
pounding away on his typewriter
twenty minutes before the train left
the Oakland pier.
The team has the entire car to itself
and an air of complete informality
prevails as is the custom on trips.
The most popular costume is a blue
shirt, white linen knickers, and bed
room slippers.
They were awakened early this j
morning by the cackle of a flock of
chickens mingled occasionally with
the bark of a dog or the mew of a
cat. It was a most realistic perform
ance by Messrs. Tandy, McLeod, and
Rothert, but suddenly the antics of
this barnyard chorus was interrupted
by the plaintiff wail of a tiny baby
crying as though its heart would j
break. It was only when someone 1
looked in Virg Dowell's berth that the J
deception was realized. Virg may not
be a ventriloquist but he ceretainly j
put it over on most of the boys.
The team took it3 first workout at j
Carlin, Nevada. The weight men lim
bered up with the shot and discus
while (he men took a few exercises j
and ran up and down the platform. |
Everyone seems to be in the best of
spirits but all are anxious to make j
the time on the train pass as rapidly i
j as possible.
