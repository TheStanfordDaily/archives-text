# EL TORO WINNER OF INTRAMURAL CUP FOR 1928-29
## Eating Club Had Substantial Lead of 40Â½ Points; Delta Chi Takes Second Honors Winners Are Champions for Second Successive Time; Will Select Own Trophy 
### 
El Toro, with a total of 183 points,
for the second consecutive time won
the special intramural championship
trophy, awarded each year to the team
that scores the greatest number of
points in the year's intramural com
petition. Delta Chi was second with
142% points while Sequoia scored 135
points to place third. The awarding of
this trophy climaxes a year of compe
tition among some fifty teams in
track, baseball, basketball, cross-coun
try, and golf.
Toro led the field the whole year.
; Fifty points were garnered during fall
] and winter quarters and eighty-three
during spring quarter. Delta Chi did
not win a first place until spring quar
ter when they won both baseball and
horseshoes. If the fraternity boys had
started out as they finished, the raca
would have been much more interest
j ing. As it was, the main contest de
l veloped into a race for second place
| with Seqouia I losing this place by a
mere seven points. El Toro scored
firsts in cross-country, fall track, and
spring track. In addition the club won
their league in baseball, basketball,
and placed second in the eight-man
one-mile relay that finished off the in
tramural season last Friday.
The usual trophy given to intra
mural winners is a bronze statue of a
I winged athlete, mounted on top of
the world. Underneath this is a place
for the name of the winning club and
the name of the trophy. The whole
thing is mounted on a marble base.
But this year, according to C. W.
Davis, Director of Intramural Ath
letics, since Toro won the trophy
last year, it will be permitted to select
any symbol of victory it wishes.
The first ten teams finished in the
following order: El Toro, Delta Chi,
Sequoia 1, Phi Kappa Sigma, Break
ers, Sigma Nu, Sigma Chi and El
Campo (tied for seventh), Alpha Tau
Omega, and Theta Chi.
