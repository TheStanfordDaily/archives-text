# German Reparations Meet Fails To Reach Agreement
## 
### 
PARIS, May 26. (/P) â€”Definite an
nouncement that the reparations con
ference has failed to reach an agree
ment is looked for by many in touch
with the experts following a brief Sun
day morning session, at which Dr. H.
Jalmar Schacht, spokesman for the
Germans, laid his cards on the table
to Owen D. Young, American chair
man of the conference.
Dr. Schacht, it is understood, stood
pat on his proposals. The creditors
will have their final say Monday and
thye also are believed to have made
up their minds to stick by their guns.
