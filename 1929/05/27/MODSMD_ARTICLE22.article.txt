# A 						Prank That Is A Felony
## 
### 
It might be of casual interest to those prankish Encina inmates
who have been so considerately borrowing the cars left parked near
the hall to know that such action is deemed a felony and bears a
penalty of a thousand dollar fine or six months in jail or both.
In the past few weeks it has become a custom to borrow unlocked or
even locked cars for periods of twelve to twenty-four hours and to leave
them any place from San Jose to San Francisco. This is quite a jolly
little trick and is advised as a means for those less fortunate individuals
who cannot honestly borrow cars to gain their desired transportation.
Last week-end, a Buick, a Chevrolet, and a new Ford disappeared for
varying lengths of times and were found nearby later without gas and
with plenty of mileage run up during their absence. The new game
enjoyed a fine showing during the week-end.
At this rate it can be expected that a round half-dozen will disappear
next week-end, a dozen the next, and so on until by the process of
geometric progression in a very short time every car on the campus will
be borrowed during the week-end and good clean fun will be enjoyed by
one and all.
When, however, one of these practical jokesters with an eye to his
own practical need, is caught, and the owner of the car brings charges
against him, there will be nothing to protect the clown. He will pay
the thousand dollar fine, spend six months in jail, or do both of these very
enjoyable little things, and have nothing to say.
