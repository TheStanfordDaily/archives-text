# These Drab After Years
## 
### 
If that acrimonious article, The Saturnalia of College Reunions, ap
pearing in the current issue of Harpers, with all its bitterness, does
nothing else, it nurtures in the mind of the about-to-be alumnus a new
hope.
For, throughout the four years of college and in many cases during
the years before, it has been dinned into the minds of young people and
shouted from the house-tops that college days are the best days, that the
golden haze of college days can never be equaled in the years after com
mencement, etc., etc., until it seems as though there is one thing for the
young graduate to do, commit suicide. Life can never hold the interest,
the variety, the worth in the drab after years, so die young and happy.
But here is a new hope. Says the writer of the article, 'Rarely if
ever do we sigh for die vanished brightness of college years. We are
living the more satisfactory and interesting lives of folk in the late
thirties and early forties. That may be why so many of us get small
thrill or profit out of reunions. We are neither frustrated nor subject
to adult infantilism."
At last someone has come forth with the theory that the years after
college are not drab, dull, and irksome. It may be adult infants looking
back upon the days when they were able to act like adult infants with
less trouble, or it may be frustrated adults who see college days in the
glamour of memory, in either case it is a regrettable attitude, a futile
point of view.
College days, days of adjustment and adaptation, days of learning
and the overcoming of limitations, are no doubt enjoyable to many, yet
why more so than the days beyond.
The sooner the young graduate cuts away from the "college man"
idea, the sooner he stands on his own and lets himself be measured for
what he is and not for what his diploma says lie is, the sooner will the
years afterward become other than drab. What sorrier sight is there
than the man who cannot forget that he is a graduate of dear old "Blank
University,' and who sighs in the dying radiance of that past glory,
doing nothing.
