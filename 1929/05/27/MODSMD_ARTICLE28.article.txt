THE POLITICS OF PEACE. By
Charles E. Martin. (Stanford Uni
versity Press. $4.00. 1929.)
"Above the Nations is Humanity."
As a fitting end to a volume having
to do with the bringing about of
peace, of universal peace, in the
world, Martin quotes from Goethe the
line above. There are many nations
in the world. True. But this also is
true: these nations have in common
something called "humanity." It is
needful indeed that we see not alone
that the nations all about us are
many, but that there is among them
something common to all —a sort of
unity, if you please. To say there is
some great unity here in the world is
no novel saying—no anomaly either
is it. You have heard it uttered often,
even during wars, from pulpits! It is
trite then to speak of the oneness of
all mankind. You hear it, that is, the
sound of the words of it, uttered,
reaches your ears, but it is true of
you, this, perhaps: you have ears and
yet you hear not. In one way you
hear, in another you do not. You hear
words, but you sense no meaning in
them. You do not understand them.
You do not care to trouble to under
stand them. Or, you consider it folly
to try to understand. Wars will come.
Peace is good. But wars will come.
World unity? Maybe that will come
too. Still —what of it? I'll be dead
by that time, you say.
Yet this unity of all the world to
be built on the basis of the common
"humanity" of men of all the na
tions, is something men must labor
now to bring about in order that it
may be consummate some day in the
future. International unity will come
not all at once at the dawning of a
future day, but will come gradually,
bit by bit, will come with the group
ing of some of the nations today and
of others tomorrow, and of others
another day after that. There will be
at once no absolute unity, no absolute
poace, but there will be tendencies
toward unity, tendencies toward
peace. Says Martin, more than a
little ironically, perhaps:
"A nation which wills to be mili
taristic will be so. A nation which
seeks in its heart to be peaceful will
be so. Disarmament, arbitration, the
regulation of war, and the guaranties
of security are steps in the right di
rection. Cannot the soul of man re
spond to its deepest yearning and rid
itself of the spirit which seems to
spell its doom? We cannot be alto
gether blamed if, in an honest effort
to do so, we at first miss the mark,
so long as our aim is high."
In another place, Martin writes:

"And just as Machiavelli and
Treitschke interpreted to the people
of their times the politics of war, so
there must be today a statement and
jan interpretation of the politics of
j peace."
| Read then, not Machiavelli's "The
'Prince," but what? — why, Martin's
"The Politics of Peace." Of course.

THE TREND OF THE AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY. By David Starr Jor
dan. (Stanford' University Press.
A limited edition of 250 auto
graphed and numbered copies.
$7.50.)
This is a beautifully printed book,
on high grade paper and bound in
red leather. It contains three essays
or articles by David Starr Jordan
which discuss the change and prog
ress in the curriculum and spirit of
the American college and university.
The first article, "The Evolution of
the College Curriculum," was the in
augural address, in 1887, of Dr. Jor
dan as first president of the newly
established College Association of In
diana. Deemed i-adical at that time,
practically every proposal made in
that address except one has been in
corporated into the American univer
sity. The one suggestion not yet
adopted, but held by many to be a
coming change, is that the degree of
Bachelor of Arts be abolished.
Then Dr. Jordan came to Stanford.
By 1898 he had nursed the University
through its more infantile years, and
at the commencement in that year he
made a speech which he called "An
Apology for the American Univer
sity." It deals with certain aspects
of progress suggested by his experi
ence as President of Stanford. This
comprises the second essay in the
book.
The third is called "The Arrierican
University System, Past and Present."
It was completed in 1927, ten years
after Dr. Jordan's retirement with the
title Chancellor Emeritus.
"The Trend of the American Uni
versity" is a book which the owners
of in years to come will treasure as
an ideal memory of the "'Grand Old
Man" of Stanford University. It
shows him to be ever a leader, both
as an educator and as a humanist.
ft is truly a tribute to be able to
pay to a man when you can say that
his thoughts were always ahead of
the world's. Forty years separate the
first and last of these essays, yet they
are both ahead of their time. They
call for changes that the world has
yet to make. They point out David
Starr Jordan as a leader of mankind.

THE POLITICS OF PEACE. By
Charles E. Martin. (Stanford Uni
versity Press. $4.00. 1929.)
"Above the Nations is Humanity."
As a fitting end to a volume having
to do with the bringing about of
peace, of universal peace, in the
world, Martin quotes from Goethe the
line above. There are many nations
in the world. True. But this also is
true: these nations have in common
something called "humanity." It is
needful indeed that we see not alone
that the nations all about us are
many, but that there is among them
something common to all —a sort of
unity, if you please. To say there is
some great unity here in the world is
no novel saying—no anomaly either
is it. You have heard it uttered often,
even during wars, from pulpits! It is
trite then to speak of the oneness of
all mankind. You hear it, that is, the
sound of the words of it, uttered,
reaches your ears, but it is true of
you, this, perhaps: you have ears and
yet you hear not. In one way you
hear, in another you do not. You hear
words, but you sense no meaning in
them. You do not understand them.
You do not care to trouble to under
stand them. Or, you consider it folly
to try to understand. Wars will come.
Peace is good. But wars will come.
World unity? Maybe that will come
too. Still —what of it? I'll be dead
by that time, you say.
Yet this unity of all the world to
be built on the basis of the common
"humanity" of men of all the na
tions, is something men must labor
now to bring about in order that it
may be consummate some day in the
future. International unity will come
not all at once at the dawning of a
future day, but will come gradually,
bit by bit, will come with the group
ing of some of the nations today and
of others tomorrow, and of others
another day after that. There will be
at once no absolute unity, no absolute
poace, but there will be tendencies
toward unity, tendencies toward
peace. Says Martin, more than a
little ironically, perhaps:
"A nation which wills to be mili
taristic will be so. A nation which
seeks in its heart to be peaceful will
be so. Disarmament, arbitration, the
regulation of war, and the guaranties
of security are steps in the right di
rection. Cannot the soul of man re
spond to its deepest yearning and rid
itself of the spirit which seems to
spell its doom? We cannot be alto
gether blamed if, in an honest effort
to do so, we at first miss the mark,
so long as our aim is high."
In another place, Martin writes:

"And just as Machiavelli and
Treitschke interpreted to the people
of their times the politics of war, so
there must be today a statement and
jan interpretation of the politics of
j peace."
| Read then, not Machiavelli's "The
'Prince," but what? — why, Martin's
"The Politics of Peace." Of course.

THE TREND OF THE AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY. By David Starr Jor
dan. (Stanford' University Press.
A limited edition of 250 auto
graphed and numbered copies.
$7.50.)
This is a beautifully printed book,
on high grade paper and bound in
red leather. It contains three essays
or articles by David Starr Jordan
which discuss the change and prog
ress in the curriculum and spirit of
the American college and university.
The first article, "The Evolution of
the College Curriculum," was the in
augural address, in 1887, of Dr. Jor
dan as first president of the newly
established College Association of In
diana. Deemed i-adical at that time,
practically every proposal made in
that address except one has been in
corporated into the American univer
sity. The one suggestion not yet
adopted, but held by many to be a
coming change, is that the degree of
Bachelor of Arts be abolished.
Then Dr. Jordan came to Stanford.
By 1898 he had nursed the University
through its more infantile years, and
at the commencement in that year he
made a speech which he called "An
Apology for the American Univer
sity." It deals with certain aspects
of progress suggested by his experi
ence as President of Stanford. This
comprises the second essay in the
book.
The third is called "The Arrierican
University System, Past and Present."
It was completed in 1927, ten years
after Dr. Jordan's retirement with the
title Chancellor Emeritus.
"The Trend of the American Uni
versity" is a book which the owners
of in years to come will treasure as
an ideal memory of the "'Grand Old
Man" of Stanford University. It
shows him to be ever a leader, both
as an educator and as a humanist.
ft is truly a tribute to be able to
pay to a man when you can say that
his thoughts were always ahead of
the world's. Forty years separate the
first and last of these essays, yet they
are both ahead of their time. They
call for changes that the world has
yet to make. They point out David
Starr Jordan as a leader of mankind.

THE POLITICS OF PEACE. By
Charles E. Martin. (Stanford Uni
versity Press. $4.00. 1929.)
"Above the Nations is Humanity."
As a fitting end to a volume having
to do with the bringing about of
peace, of universal peace, in the
world, Martin quotes from Goethe the
line above. There are many nations
in the world. True. But this also is
true: these nations have in common
something called "humanity." It is
needful indeed that we see not alone
that the nations all about us are
many, but that there is among them
something common to all —a sort of
unity, if you please. To say there is
some great unity here in the world is
no novel saying—no anomaly either
is it. You have heard it uttered often,
even during wars, from pulpits! It is
trite then to speak of the oneness of
all mankind. You hear it, that is, the
sound of the words of it, uttered,
reaches your ears, but it is true of
you, this, perhaps: you have ears and
yet you hear not. In one way you
hear, in another you do not. You hear
words, but you sense no meaning in
them. You do not understand them.
You do not care to trouble to under
stand them. Or, you consider it folly
to try to understand. Wars will come.
Peace is good. But wars will come.
World unity? Maybe that will come
too. Still —what of it? I'll be dead
by that time, you say.
Yet this unity of all the world to
be built on the basis of the common
"humanity" of men of all the na
tions, is something men must labor
now to bring about in order that it
may be consummate some day in the
future. International unity will come
not all at once at the dawning of a
future day, but will come gradually,
bit by bit, will come with the group
ing of some of the nations today and
of others tomorrow, and of others
another day after that. There will be
at once no absolute unity, no absolute
poace, but there will be tendencies
toward unity, tendencies toward
peace. Says Martin, more than a
little ironically, perhaps:
"A nation which wills to be mili
taristic will be so. A nation which
seeks in its heart to be peaceful will
be so. Disarmament, arbitration, the
regulation of war, and the guaranties
of security are steps in the right di
rection. Cannot the soul of man re
spond to its deepest yearning and rid
itself of the spirit which seems to
spell its doom? We cannot be alto
gether blamed if, in an honest effort
to do so, we at first miss the mark,
so long as our aim is high."
In another place, Martin writes:

"And just as Machiavelli and
Treitschke interpreted to the people
of their times the politics of war, so
there must be today a statement and
jan interpretation of the politics of
j peace."
| Read then, not Machiavelli's "The
'Prince," but what? — why, Martin's
"The Politics of Peace." Of course.

THE TREND OF THE AMERICAN
UNIVERSITY. By David Starr Jor
dan. (Stanford' University Press.
A limited edition of 250 auto
graphed and numbered copies.
$7.50.)
This is a beautifully printed book,
on high grade paper and bound in
red leather. It contains three essays
or articles by David Starr Jordan
which discuss the change and prog
ress in the curriculum and spirit of
the American college and university.
The first article, "The Evolution of
the College Curriculum," was the in
augural address, in 1887, of Dr. Jor
dan as first president of the newly
established College Association of In
diana. Deemed i-adical at that time,
practically every proposal made in
that address except one has been in
corporated into the American univer
sity. The one suggestion not yet
adopted, but held by many to be a
coming change, is that the degree of
Bachelor of Arts be abolished.
Then Dr. Jordan came to Stanford.
By 1898 he had nursed the University
through its more infantile years, and
at the commencement in that year he
made a speech which he called "An
Apology for the American Univer
sity." It deals with certain aspects
of progress suggested by his experi
ence as President of Stanford. This
comprises the second essay in the
book.
The third is called "The Arrierican
University System, Past and Present."
It was completed in 1927, ten years
after Dr. Jordan's retirement with the
title Chancellor Emeritus.
"The Trend of the American Uni
versity" is a book which the owners
of in years to come will treasure as
an ideal memory of the "'Grand Old
Man" of Stanford University. It
shows him to be ever a leader, both
as an educator and as a humanist.
ft is truly a tribute to be able to
pay to a man when you can say that
his thoughts were always ahead of
the world's. Forty years separate the
first and last of these essays, yet they
are both ahead of their time. They
