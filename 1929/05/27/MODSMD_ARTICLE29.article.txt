The Editor, Sir:
As a result of the recent discussion |
of crew, and with it the concurrent j
remarks concerning the Lower Divi
sion, I became curious to again look
into this latter subject, and, as a re- j
suit, I have before me a pamphlet |
entitled "The University records of i
students from junior colleges," by j
John Pearce Mitchell and Walter j
Crosby Ellis which, I understand, \
duplicates much of the material used j
by Dr. Wilbur to favorably convince '
tli«? Board of Trustees with respect to |
the proposed abolition of the Lower :
Division. This pamphlet is indeed in- |
teresting. It is a mass of "hooey." j
The "study" is largely irrelevant in j
respect to the use that has been made j
of it, as by a little reflection it be
comes apparent that to study the aca
demic accomplishments of Junior Col
lege students, as they reflect the ful
filment by the J.C. of the "prepara
tory" function; comparison should be
made between former J.C. students
and a group of "native" Stanford stu
dents having "I.Q.'s" of the same fre
quency distribution. Unless this is
done, the results are open to ques
tion on the grounds as to whether
the J.C. is not merely a means of ,
selection and whether or no this se- !
lection could not be done with less j
time and energy if performed in a j
different manner as by intelligence j
tests. (See Terman.)
The "study" itself is most valuable !
statistically because of the several j
"native" Stanford groups used as a j
basis for comparison—e.g., on pages i

367, 372, 374. (This is especially open
to attack as it contains only members
of one class and one wonders why the
whole class was not used instead of
such a large sample.), and 383 —but
this is not all; to a casual reader it
seems that, every place where a
choice is possible, the method which
is used is the one favorable to the
J.C. and this forces one to the con
clusion that the investigators, Mr.
Mitchell and Mr. Ellis, are incompe
tent (or dishonest-). From a statistical
standpoint their work is worthless,
though it has, no doubt, proved a most
valuable piece of propaganda with
which to entrap the unwary.

remarks concerning the Lower Divi
sion, I became curious to again look
into this latter subject, and, as a re- j
suit, I have before me a pamphlet |
entitled "The University records of i
students from junior colleges," by j
John Pearce Mitchell and Walter j
Crosby Ellis which, I understand, \
duplicates much of the material used j
by Dr. Wilbur to favorably convince '
tli«? Board of Trustees with respect to |
the proposed abolition of the Lower :
Division. This pamphlet is indeed in- |
teresting. It is a mass of "hooey." j
The "study" is largely irrelevant in j
respect to the use that has been made j
of it, as by a little reflection it be
comes apparent that to study the aca
demic accomplishments of Junior Col
lege students, as they reflect the ful
filment by the J.C. of the "prepara
tory" function; comparison should be
made between former J.C. students
and a group of "native" Stanford stu
dents having "I.Q.'s" of the same fre
quency distribution. Unless this is
done, the results are open to ques
tion on the grounds as to whether
the J.C. is not merely a means of ,
selection and whether or no this se- !
lection could not be done with less j
time and energy if performed in a j
different manner as by intelligence j
tests. (See Terman.)
The "study" itself is most valuable !
statistically because of the several j
"native" Stanford groups used as a j
basis for comparison—e.g., on pages i

367, 372, 374. (This is especially open
to attack as it contains only members
of one class and one wonders why the
whole class was not used instead of
such a large sample.), and 383 —but
this is not all; to a casual reader it
seems that, every place where a
choice is possible, the method which
is used is the one favorable to the
J.C. and this forces one to the con
clusion that the investigators, Mr.
Mitchell and Mr. Ellis, are incompe
tent (or dishonest-). From a statistical
standpoint their work is worthless,
though it has, no doubt, proved a most
valuable piece of propaganda with
which to entrap the unwary.
