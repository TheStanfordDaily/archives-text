A MISUNDERSTOOD CHAMPION
Mr. James Joseph Tunney, exponent
of the dignified profession and former
I instructor of Shakespearian literature
; at Yale University, is resting not so
i easily in his palatial villa on the
1 Island of Brioni overlooking the pur
ple waters of the Adriatic.
| Gentleman Gene, who a little over
! a year ago decided to drop his title
| and the glamour of the sports world
j via the marriage route, has since that
I time been touring the continent with
j his wife, the former Polly Lauder,
; New England society belle, and Thorn
ton Wilder, famous American novelist.
Two worries have helped to fur
row the brow of the former cham
pion during the past month. The
main one has been the serious
illness of his wife caused by com
plications following an operation
on April 30. Since her illness ap
proached the danger point a few
days ago Tunney has brought all
surgeons of any distinction, with
in flying dis-ance, to his aid.
Latest reports say that she will
recover.
The other worry, if it can be
called that, is the $500,000 breach
of promise suit of Mrs. Katherine
Fogarty, former wife of a Texas
plumbing contractor, who it ap
pears, is attempting to plumb the
I said James Joseph for that
amount. Certain American news
papers, as has been the case of
times before, are making a great
hullabaloo over the event, al
though it probably means nothing.
Mrs. Fogarty and her attorney
either have no evidence against Tun
i ney or are afraid to lay their cards on
| the table. Their statements all tend to
evade the point in question. Mrs. Fo
i garty says that she received payments
|of $25,000 in 1925-6-7, but she flatly
J declined to admit that the money was
j sent to her either by Tunney or his
■ agents. However, her attorney, Col-
I onel Lewis L. Field of New Haven,
[Connecticut, issued no denial when
j queried on the subject, although he
did assert that the sum $75,000 was
I incorrect.
Billy Gibson, manager of there
! tired champion, is quoted as saying,
"I think that Gene told his wife every-
I thing a couple of months before they
were married, and I believe, made a
! clean breast of the Fogarty business
j at that time.
If there was anything to make
a clean breast about it is all past
now. Our prediction is that James
Joseph Tunney will continue his
honeymoon as soon as his wife
recovers from her illness, and the
Fogarty affair will become history
as have many other incidents in
the lives of men who have reached
the pinnacle of fame in the busi
ness or profession they have
chosen.
Tunney has come in for more
than his share of criticism ever
j ....since his advent as champion. Be
cause he attempted to raise box
ing to a higher plane, he is per
haps the most misunderstood man
i who ever entered the sour
science. To the ham-and-eggers he
was the unpopular champion be
cause he refused to cater to the
ballyhoo of the masses. But to
the people who were fond of box
ing for sport's sake, his exhibi
tions of co-ordination of brain and
i brawn pointed to new era in the
"leather-pushing" game.
