# SPORTS OF 1929
## He Scales The Heights 
### FEG MURRAY 
It's been taken for granted for sev
eral years that Yale always has a
good pole-vaulter. Ever since T. G.
Shearman won the event for Old Eli
in the 1888 1.C.4-A. games, Yale vault
ers have been consistently good and
have triumphed in the outdoor East
ern "Intercollegiate" no less than
twenty-two times, including ties for j
first. C. S. Campbell of Yale made
the first twelve-foot vault in 1.C.4-A.
history in 1909, A.C. Gilbert of Yale
made the first twelve-foot vault in !
Olympic history in 1908, Bob Gardner
of Yale made the first thirteen-foot
vault in 1912, and Sabin Carr, also
of Yale, made the first fourteen-foot j
vault in 1927, and then did 14 feet 1 ,
inch indoors to show that it was no
mistake.
Then along comes gangling Fred
Sturdy, who went to Yale from Los >
Angeles High School, and who was
practically unknown last year owing j
to the publicity his team-mate Sabin
Carr received. But Fred was devel- J
oped in the same school and by the
same tutors —A 1 McGall and A. C. j
Gilbert, "The Old Master" —as Carr, |
and I see no reason why he should ,
not soar to even greater heights.
Frederic Sturdy is 6 feet 2 inches j
tall and weighs 155 pounds, while i
Carr was 5 feet 10 and tipped the j

scales at 168. Only Lee Barnes of
Southern California, whose mark of
14 feet I*£ inches has not yet been
accepted, has cleared the fourteen
loot mark in competition. Last Octo
ber in the National Junior champion
ships Sturdy set a new record of 13
feet 3 3-8 inches. Then in the vari
i ous indoor meets last winter he
i cleared 13:7, 13:4, 14, 13:9, 13:7%, and
! 13:6. In an indoor meet in Seattle,
j Wash., he was beaten by Ward Ed
! monds of Stanford, but he will meet
; his conqueror this week in the
j 1.C.4-A. games at Philadelphia, and a
1 new world's record should result, if
old Jupiter Pluvius will behave him
| self.

It's been taken for granted for sev
eral years that Yale always has a
good pole-vaulter. Ever since T. G.
Shearman won the event for Old Eli
in the 1888 1.C.4-A. games, Yale vault
ers have been consistently good and
have triumphed in the outdoor East
ern "Intercollegiate" no less than
twenty-two times, including ties for j
first. C. S. Campbell of Yale made
the first twelve-foot vault in 1.C.4-A.
history in 1909, A.C. Gilbert of Yale
made the first twelve-foot vault in !
Olympic history in 1908, Bob Gardner
of Yale made the first thirteen-foot
vault in 1912, and Sabin Carr, also
of Yale, made the first fourteen-foot j
vault in 1927, and then did 14 feet 1 ,
inch indoors to show that it was no
mistake.
Then along comes gangling Fred
Sturdy, who went to Yale from Los >
Angeles High School, and who was
practically unknown last year owing j
to the publicity his team-mate Sabin
Carr received. But Fred was devel- J
oped in the same school and by the
same tutors —A 1 McGall and A. C. j
Gilbert, "The Old Master" —as Carr, |
and I see no reason why he should ,
not soar to even greater heights.
Frederic Sturdy is 6 feet 2 inches j
tall and weighs 155 pounds, while i
Carr was 5 feet 10 and tipped the j

scales at 168. Only Lee Barnes of
Southern California, whose mark of
14 feet I*£ inches has not yet been
accepted, has cleared the fourteen
loot mark in competition. Last Octo
ber in the National Junior champion
ships Sturdy set a new record of 13
feet 3 3-8 inches. Then in the vari
i ous indoor meets last winter he
i cleared 13:7, 13:4, 14, 13:9, 13:7%, and
! 13:6. In an indoor meet in Seattle,
j Wash., he was beaten by Ward Ed
! monds of Stanford, but he will meet
; his conqueror this week in the
j 1.C.4-A. games at Philadelphia, and a
1 new world's record should result, if
old Jupiter Pluvius will behave him
| self.
