j Shank and Okeu Haugliland, commer
j cial flyers who took off here Satur- ,
i day morning in their monoplane "Miss i
| Ranger" in an attempt to break the ;
■ world's endurance record, refueled j

crimson ship for Robbinsdale, Minn. 1
J The start was made at 7:15 o'clock j
! and with a strong tail wind the two
expected to reach the Minnesota city
| shortly after noon.
The third actual refueling contact
made at 6:04 a.m., almost 22 hours
after the plane went aloft, was de
' scribed as "perfect" by the two re
' fueling ship pilots, Verne Nelson and
j O. P. Harrah. Seventy gallons of gaso
line and breakfast consisting of toast
and cheese were transferred to the
two men. Half an hour later they set
a course to the north, toward their
home state. The refueling plane left
thirty minutes later. Two contacts
were made late yesterday.
