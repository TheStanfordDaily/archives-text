# LAST CHAPARRAL OF YEAR OUT THURSDAY; FEATURES ART WORK
## 
### 
Before retiring for the summer the
Old Boy is making one grand and
glorious wind-up in the June issue of
Chaparral that will be offered to the
hungry populace on Thursday. It is
not often that we have the pleasure of
boobing the seniors but he is making
up for lost time before they escape
forever. And then, too, it is a swell
chance to have a good laugh at those
summer jobs before he starts in work
ing himself.
The Old Boy is quite proud of the
art work that is displayed this time.
A cover has been done by Berk An
thony that depicts the sad scene of
the International Correspondence
School grad leaving the campus.
Then, too, that talented artist, Gregor
Duncan, has turned out a full-page
drawing of a Hollywood premier that
is remindful of Russel Patterson at
his best. As for literary, he is pre
senting a clever burlesque titled, "The
Bridge of San Francisqnito Creek,"
which is satirizingâ€”guess what? The
outgoing editor is also taking advan
tage of his last month in power by
offering a complete novelette, "Out
of the Frying Pan." All in all, every
one has had just a peachy time and,
as Mumsie said, "it was just the best
Christmas we ever have had."
