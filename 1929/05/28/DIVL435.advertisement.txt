Those "Suntan" Shades of beige which harmonize
with so many of Summer's Frocks are emphasized
in our showing of New Pumps for afternoon wear.
The pump we illustrate has a vamp of Real
Lizard (Sunburn Beige) with matching Kid back
and heel. This slipper is not only pleasant to
look at but also is profitable to wear—for no
leather in vogue today maintains its lustre with
out scuffing as does genuine lizard.
