# NEW POSSIBILITY TO BREAK DEBT DEADLOCK FOUND
## Technicians Work All Night On New Computations to Change Reparations Dates Difference in Two Payments Would Reach $151,200,000 If New Sum Areed Upon 
### 
PARIS, May 27. (JP)—'Technicians
worked through the night on compu
tations that the experts of the repara
tions conference tomorrow may use
them to give new life to the negotia
tions.
Owen I). Young and his staff today
gave new vigor to the committee,
which was considered moribund at
the end of last week, by examining
with other experts a new possibility
of a way out of the deadlock between
the Germans and the Allies.
The operation most favored takes
the form of new calculations as to
what the annuities originally proposed
by Mr. Young would yield if they
began at other dates than April 1,
1929, which was the basis for the
original calculations. The experts to
night would not reveal what the new
-dates were.
The creditor experts still insist that
payments under the Dawes plan ought
to continue at least until the end of
this year. Dr. Iljalmar Schacht holds
to his demand that they cease with
April 1929.
The difference in actual payments
between the two points of view would
be about 630,000,000 marks (approxi
mately $151,200,000). The creditors
relied on this additional sum to en
able them to agree on a repartition
of payments among'themselves which
would permit acceptance of the Young
annuities.
Since Dr. Schacht rejects this view,
it is necessary to find some way of
reconciling the divergent opinions.
It is hoped that accountants may
elucidate the situation respecting the
present value of the annuities and
their final yield in such a way as to
enable the creditors to make conces
sions to Germany. If they succeed,
there will remain in the way to agree
ment only two of the German condi
tions those as to suspension of repara
tions payments, in case of economic
difficulties, in Germany, and the right
to call for a new conference to revise
any decision now taken.
