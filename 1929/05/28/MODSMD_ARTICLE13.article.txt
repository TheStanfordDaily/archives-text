FORT WORTH, Texas, May 27. (?)
â€” Reg. L. Robbins and James Kelly
i today began to reap some of the re
wards in store for them as the new
holders of the world's endurance flight
j record.
Rested by a long sleep after com-
J pleting 172 hours, 32 minutes, 1 sec
! ond of continuous flight in their single
motored monoplane Fort Worth, the
| air men awoke today to find presents
and lucrative offers pouring in on
| them.
The acclaim and bids for their ser
vices were in sharp contrast with the
I little aid the former railroad mechan
i ic and the erstwhile cowpuncher re
ceived in preparing for the endurance
test.
Scores of offers for vaudeville en
gagements, newspaper and magazine
articles on the flight, and various
positions with aircraft concerns were
received.
