# Allen To Speak Tonight In First Of Music Series
## "Music as a Language" Will Be Subject of Lecture In Assembly Hall 
### 
Warren D. Allen's lecture on "Music
as a Language," to be given tonight
at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly Hall,
will serve as an introduction to a
series of lecture-recitals which will
start next fall under the auspices of
the Committee on Public Exercises.

Realizing the need of some such
popular lectures on the elements of
music, in the absence of music courses
from the curriculum, Professor E. E.
Robinson, chairman of the committee,
has arranged the series, which will be
given on every fourth Tuesday next
year. Melody, rhythm, and harmony,
as well as other less fundamental ele
ments entering into the composition
and appreciation of music, will be
taken up next autumn. Allen will de
vote much of each evening to illus
trate on the piano his points.
Allen's talk tonight will be purely
introductory to and explanatory of the
series which will follow next year; he
will, however, give a few illustrative
selections on the piano incidental to
his lecture.
