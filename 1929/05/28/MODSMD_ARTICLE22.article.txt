CHICAGO, May 27. (JP)â€”'The Big
Ten Conference athletic eruption, oc
casioned by the expulsion of lowa,
today had boiled down to silence and
watchful waiting by member schools.
lowa officials, professing to still be
unenlightened as to specific causes of
the disbarment, were preparing for an
investigation and had invited Major
John L. Griffith, conference athletic
commissioner, to aid them. Griffith
was to leave for lowa City tonight.
Reports of impending action against
ether member schools, with North

the faculty committee which penalized
lowa meets again and that no meet
