## Approve Score of Committee Amendments; Impose Duty On Hides, Shoes, Leather Garner, Texas, Will Seek to Abolish Tariff Commission In Favor of New Tax Body 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 27. (;P)—ln an
atmosphere electrified with charges
of trading," partisan debate, and
resurrected campaign arguments, the
House approved another score of com
mittee amendments to the tariff bill
today and paved the way for a final
vote late tomorrow.
The session, lasting more than six
hours, was the stormiest of any since
the Republican-framed measure was
taken up three weeks ago, and out
of it emerged an amendment, ap
proved by a vote of 190 to 90, placing
a duty of 10 per cent on hides, rates
ranging from 12% to SO per cent on
leather, and a levy of 20 per cent on
boots and shoes.
All of these commodities have been
on the free list for years and were
retained in that category in the pres
ent. bill as first reported. Urgent de
mands for duties, however, led to
reconsideration and the committee
made concessions to members from
the cattle raising and New York and
New England shoe manufacturing
states.
Of the other amendments approved,
the Ways and Means Committee was
victorious in every instance and not
one change was effected by any mem
ber outside the committee group.
A dozen or more amendments re
main to be acted upon tomorrow be
fore all are voted on en bloc just
prior to a final vote.
A motion to recommit the measure
will be made before the vote on
passage is taken. Representative Gar
ner, of Texas, the Democratic leader,
will offer the motion to send the
measure back to the Ways and Means
Committee with instructions to amend
it in three important particulars.
He will seek to abolish the present
tariff commission, to repeal the flexi
ble provisions authorizing the Presi
dent to change import duties, and to
provide for a fact-finding board of
four members to be appointed by the
Speaker of the House and Vice-Presi
dent and made solely responsible to
Congress.
He would restore the power which
the bill takes away from the customs
courts and gives to the Secretary of
the Treasury to review valuations in
cases of appeals from appraisements.

All of these commodities have been
on the free list for years and were
retained in that category in the pres
ent. bill as first reported. Urgent de
mands for duties, however, led to
reconsideration and the committee
made concessions to members from
the cattle raising and New York and
New England shoe manufacturing
states.
Of the other amendments approved,
the Ways and Means Committee was
victorious in every instance and not
one change was effected by any mem
ber outside the committee group.
A dozen or more amendments re
main to be acted upon tomorrow be
fore all are voted on en bloc just
prior to a final vote.
A motion to recommit the measure
will be made before the vote on
passage is taken. Representative Gar
ner, of Texas, the Democratic leader,
will offer the motion to send the
measure back to the Ways and Means
Committee with instructions to amend
it in three important particulars.
He will seek to abolish the present
tariff commission, to repeal the flexi
ble provisions authorizing the Presi
dent to change import duties, and to
provide for a fact-finding board of
four members to be appointed by the
Speaker of the House and Vice-Presi
dent and made solely responsible to
Congress.
He would restore the power which
the bill takes away from the customs
courts and gives to the Secretary of
the Treasury to review valuations in
cases of appeals from appraisements.
