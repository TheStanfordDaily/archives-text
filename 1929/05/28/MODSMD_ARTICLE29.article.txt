# Dr. Wilbur Under the Scalpel
## 
### 
Dr. Wilbur is likely to finish his term in Washington as the worst
hated or the most-esteemed member of President Hoover's Cabinet. This
is the opinion expressed by "The Gentleman at the Keyhole," political
writer for "Collier's."
"Prexy Steps Out" is the title of an article in a recent number of
that weekly magazine, in which the political proportions of Dr. Wilbur
are discussed.
"Dr. Wilbur came to Washington like the last college president here,
Dr. Woodrow Wilson, rather unpopular in his college which is Leland
Stanford University," the article says.
Reference is made to the elimination of the lower division and to
Dr. W r ilbtir's attitude toward fraternities and sororities.
"I feel that this revelation about the addiction of Dr. Wilbur to
scholarship will make his days in the Interior Department more difficult,"
says the "peeping gentleman."
"The good doctor is a cat in a strange garret. Compared to such
sympathetic souls as his predecessors, Albert P>. Fall, Dr. Hubert Work
or Franklin K. Lane, who went from the Cabinet to the payroll of Do
heny, Dr. Wilbur is a bull in a china shop. Dr. Wilbur is already cancel
ing oil leases by the scores. He evidently doesn't know Mr. Babbitt by
his first name.
"Dr. Wilbur is a fighter. He is disparaged a little in Washington by
the name Wilbur, for he is a brother of Curtis D., who was secretary
of the navy under President Coolidge.
"The physical resemblance between the two brothers is disconcerting.
Curtis D. is a tall shambling man, stoop-shouldered, inches more than
six feet high.
"Ray Lyman is taller and thinner, at least six feet six high, with his
head thrust forward at an inquiring angle. Ile looks like a gigantic ques
tion mark.
"I am indicating that he is likely to have his troubles, esi>ecially with
the western half of Congress, whose chief occupation is to extort favors
from the Interior Department. Every Secretary of the Interior from the
time of Ballinger has been too pliant. lie is likely to be too stiff for the
West; and unless the East, which usually does not know who is Secre
tary of Interior, learns to admire him, he is likely to find that he has
leaped from the frying pan of a college president with standards of
learning into the fire of a Secretary of Interior with a public conscience.
"Those who know him best say he has personal charm which will
help him, that he will be popular socially, that lie is an interesting con
versationalist, an amusing story teller, an effective speaker. He is likely
to need all of these qualities. For the struggle with the Babbittry of
alumni is nothing compared with the Babbittry that demands the public
lands and that would defraud the Indians.
"He is the one Hoover man in the Hoover Cabinet. Every other
Cabinet member is more or less of an accident.
"Dr. Wilbur is the President's personal choice untrameled by politics.
He is, moreover, the social conscience of the Hoover administration. But
at any rate, all his life has been devoted to human improvement. He was
first a physician, then a teacher, then a practicing physician, and finally,
an educator."
