## TRES BIEN, NOUS N'AURONS PAS DE CORSAGES 
### 
Tho Editor, Sir:
Since there are but .a few more is- j
sues of the Daily to be published this j
quarter, I wish to call attention to j
the question of corsages at the Senior
Ball. It is a well-known and somewhat
well-followed rule that corsages are
taboo at Stanford; yet after follow
ing tJiis rule after a fashion for three
>ears we find that the Seniors seem j
to think that they had better have one
last splurge with the result that cor
sages seem to be chic and h la mode
at the Senior Ball. Since one must
pay $10 for a bid (plus $2 for Senior
dues) and plenty more for "esscn- j
tials," I think the regular Stanford
tradition of "no corsages" should be
followed by those attending the Senior
Ball. May those who wear them feel
ns uncomfortably conspicuous and
out of place as if they were h la
naturel.
Perhaps the I>aily could publish |

| some scorching tirade against cor
sages, thus supplying us with a writ
; ten excuse which we can submit as
| evidence that they are mal h propos,
liors de combat, or what have you.
Yours for some co-operation,
Heaven protect the working man.
