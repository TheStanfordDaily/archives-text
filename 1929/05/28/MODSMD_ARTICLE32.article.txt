# The 						Bullsession

### 
On Voltaire's funeral car were the
words: "He gave the human mind a
great impetus; he prepared us for
freedom."
One hundred and fifty-one years
later last Wednesday the freedom of
the mind he prepared us for was con
sumated when the Boston customs
collector banned his rollicking narra
tive "Candide" from entrance into
the port on the grounds that it was
"obscene," slating that importation
of the book was in violation of the
United States tariff laws "because of
its text."
When it was written, in 1751, its
suppression would have been excused
by general intolerance of the time.
That it was barred from the United
States in 1929 could probably be ex
plained by no one except the learned
Pangloss, Candide's instructor, and a
professor of metaphysico-theologicos
monigology. It would take an expo
nent of that noble science to tell why
thirteen copies of a book on the
shelves of high school libraries, on
sale in every bookstore in the coun
try. and on the required reading lists
in many courses in literature, should
be banned on the ground that it was
"obscene."
The book was denied entrance to
the country under a new ruling of the
Treasury department (a department

of the government composed of men
especially versed in the finer points
of morality and literature) that any
customs collector could forbid the im
portation of any book he chose. This
leads to a delightful inconsistency,
which will probably result in the end
with the publication of a list of ports
with the names of books which may
be imported there. Or perhaps enter
prising chambers of commerce will
notify European book exporters of the
splendid opportunities of their ports.
Portland, Maine, can advertise that it
is the only port in the country admit
ting Bocaccio's works, and do a thriv
ing business importing Decamerons.
But a bewildered exporter desirous
of getting a copy of Rabalais into the
land of the free will probably be
forced to send it around to Portland,
Oregon.
All of which leads to observation
from Voltaire, on laws:
"Monkeys are more like merry
andrews than a regularly governed
people; they do not appear associated
under fixed and fundamental laws. We
resemble monkeys more than any
other animals in the talent of imita
tion, in the levity of our ideas, and
in that inconstancy which has always
prevented our having uniform and
durable laws."
â€”Marvin Skipwith.
