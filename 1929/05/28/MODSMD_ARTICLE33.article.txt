A Preface to Morals. By Walter Lipp
mann. (New York: Macmillan.
$2.50.)
Mr. Lippman presents his substitute
for the now worn-out and out-grown
religion of our fathers. His thesis is
a re-statement in modern language
and tempo of the teachings of the
great humanists. His ultimate plea is
that each of us strive to reach a
philosophical maturity leading to a
disinterested partnership with the
world. This attitude, believes Lipp
marin, would enable us to get out of
life the same fullness and satisfaction
as did the humanists of old who de
veloped that outlook.
And Mr. Lippmann is a man to be
taken seriously, and what he says is
worth pondering over. He is not an
ascetic scholar, or religious bigot. He
is a student of the world and of man
kind. He was recently appointed edi
tor of the New York World. Some
of the books he has written are:
"Liberty and the News," "The Stakes
of Diplomacy," "Public Opinion," and
"The Phantom Public."
To get back to the subject of the
book. Lippmann says, "When men
find that they no longer believe seri
ously and deeply that they are gov
erned from heaven, there is anarchy
in their souls until by conscious effort
they find ways of governing them
selves."
Mr. Lippman offers what he sees
as the escape from the chaos of
modernity. His style is frank and
free swinging. He says things in a
way that makes them interesting.

"A Preface to Morals" is divided
into three parts. The first is devoted
to a discussion of what Mr. Lippmann
calls the dissolution of the ancestoral
order; in these chapters he discusses
the causes and consequences of that
break-up of authority and tradition in
religion, politics, art, the family, and
the internal life of man which has
produced the moral and intellectual
confusion of our age.

The second part is devoted to the
foundations of humanism, and con
sists of an attempt to show that the
insight of the sages as to how man
may find peace and happiness in him
self, neglected and misunderstood
hitherto by the mass of men, is now
confirmed by the researches of mod
ern psychology.
The third part is called "The
Genius of Modernity," and is an at
tempt to show that a true insight into

the nature of modern industry, poli
tics, and sexual relations leads to the
conclusion that what the sages meant
by "high religion," what philosophers
call "disinterestedness," what psych
ologists call "a matured personality"
are the same ideal, and that this ideal
is inherently and necessarily the
supreme ideal of modern men.
I heartily recommend that you dip
into this book at your next oppor
tunity. You'll find it a fascinating
treatment fo a subject that concerns
every one of us.

| Corporate Earning Power. By William
Leonard Crum. (The Stanford
University Press. 1929. $5.)
William Leonard Crum is Professor
of Statistics at the Graduate School
t of Business here at Stanford. He has
i prepared this book in a field that is
relatively unexplored. And it is the
most authoritative and revealing study
of corporation incomes in the United
States now available.
It presents an analysis and interpre
tation of the statistics on corporate
capital and income which have been
published annually since 1916 by the
United States Treasury in connection
with the taxation of corporate income.
The data on which the book is based
are therefore the most comprehensive
and most nearly uniform of any avail
able statistics on corporate industry.
The leading analyses of the book
are first, time studies of the variations
in the margins of profit in each line
of industry, and second, studies of
the relative earning power of different
lines of business at the same time.
The results are presented in both
tabular and graphic form, and the
interpretation of the observed rela
tionships is orderly and detailed.

Business men, statisticians, invest
tors, and investment advisors will find
the information presented of immedi
ate value and the methods employed
of permanent usefulness.

ascetic scholar, or religious bigot. He
is a student of the world and of man
kind. He was recently appointed edi
tor of the New York World. Some
of the books he has written are:
"Liberty and the News," "The Stakes
of Diplomacy," "Public Opinion," and
"The Phantom Public."
To get back to the subject of the
book. Lippmann says, "When men
find that they no longer believe seri
ously and deeply that they are gov
erned from heaven, there is anarchy
in their souls until by conscious effort
they find ways of governing them
selves."
Mr. Lippman offers what he sees
as the escape from the chaos of
modernity. His style is frank and
free swinging. He says things in a
way that makes them interesting.

"A Preface to Morals" is divided
into three parts. The first is devoted
to a discussion of what Mr. Lippmann
calls the dissolution of the ancestoral
order; in these chapters he discusses
the causes and consequences of that
break-up of authority and tradition in
religion, politics, art, the family, and
the internal life of man which has
produced the moral and intellectual
confusion of our age.

The second part is devoted to the
foundations of humanism, and con
sists of an attempt to show that the
insight of the sages as to how man
may find peace and happiness in him
self, neglected and misunderstood
hitherto by the mass of men, is now
confirmed by the researches of mod
ern psychology.
The third part is called "The
Genius of Modernity," and is an at
tempt to show that a true insight into

the nature of modern industry, poli
tics, and sexual relations leads to the
conclusion that what the sages meant
by "high religion," what philosophers
call "disinterestedness," what psych
ologists call "a matured personality"
are the same ideal, and that this ideal
is inherently and necessarily the
supreme ideal of modern men.
I heartily recommend that you dip
into this book at your next oppor
tunity. You'll find it a fascinating
treatment fo a subject that concerns
every one of us.

| Corporate Earning Power. By William
Leonard Crum. (The Stanford
University Press. 1929. $5.)
William Leonard Crum is Professor
of Statistics at the Graduate School
t of Business here at Stanford. He has
i prepared this book in a field that is
relatively unexplored. And it is the
most authoritative and revealing study
of corporation incomes in the United
States now available.
It presents an analysis and interpre
tation of the statistics on corporate
capital and income which have been
published annually since 1916 by the
United States Treasury in connection
with the taxation of corporate income.
The data on which the book is based
are therefore the most comprehensive
and most nearly uniform of any avail
able statistics on corporate industry.
The leading analyses of the book
are first, time studies of the variations
in the margins of profit in each line
of industry, and second, studies of
the relative earning power of different
lines of business at the same time.
The results are presented in both
tabular and graphic form, and the
interpretation of the observed rela
tionships is orderly and detailed.

Business men, statisticians, invest
tors, and investment advisors will find
the information presented of immedi
ate value and the methods employed
of permanent usefulness.

A Preface to Morals. By Walter Lipp
mann. (New York: Macmillan.
$2.50.)
Mr. Lippman presents his substitute
for the now worn-out and out-grown
religion of our fathers. His thesis is
a re-statement in modern language
and tempo of the teachings of the
great humanists. His ultimate plea is
that each of us strive to reach a
philosophical maturity leading to a
disinterested partnership with the
world. This attitude, believes Lipp
marin, would enable us to get out of
life the same fullness and satisfaction
as did the humanists of old who de
veloped that outlook.
And Mr. Lippmann is a man to be
taken seriously, and what he says is

way that makes them interesting.

"A Preface to Morals" is divided
into three parts. The first is devoted
to a discussion of what Mr. Lippmann
calls the dissolution of the ancestoral
order; in these chapters he discusses
the causes and consequences of that
break-up of authority and tradition in
religion, politics, art, the family, and
the internal life of man which has
produced the moral and intellectual
confusion of our age.

The second part is devoted to the
foundations of humanism, and con
sists of an attempt to show that the
insight of the sages as to how man
may find peace and happiness in him
self, neglected and misunderstood
hitherto by the mass of men, is now
confirmed by the researches of mod
ern psychology.
The third part is called "The
Genius of Modernity," and is an at
tempt to show that a true insight into

the nature of modern industry, poli
tics, and sexual relations leads to the
conclusion that what the sages meant
by "high religion," what philosophers
call "disinterestedness," what psych
ologists call "a matured personality"
are the same ideal, and that this ideal
is inherently and necessarily the
supreme ideal of modern men.
I heartily recommend that you dip
into this book at your next oppor
tunity. You'll find it a fascinating
treatment fo a subject that concerns
every one of us.

| Corporate Earning Power. By William
Leonard Crum. (The Stanford
University Press. 1929. $5.)
William Leonard Crum is Professor
of Statistics at the Graduate School
t of Business here at Stanford. He has
i prepared this book in a field that is
relatively unexplored. And it is the
most authoritative and revealing study
of corporation incomes in the United
States now available.
It presents an analysis and interpre
tation of the statistics on corporate
capital and income which have been
published annually since 1916 by the
United States Treasury in connection
with the taxation of corporate income.
The data on which the book is based
are therefore the most comprehensive
and most nearly uniform of any avail
able statistics on corporate industry.
The leading analyses of the book
are first, time studies of the variations
in the margins of profit in each line
of industry, and second, studies of
the relative earning power of different
lines of business at the same time.
The results are presented in both
tabular and graphic form, and the
interpretation of the observed rela
tionships is orderly and detailed.

Business men, statisticians, invest
tors, and investment advisors will find
the information presented of immedi
ate value and the methods employed
of permanent usefulness.

A Preface to Morals. By Walter Lipp
mann. (New York: Macmillan.
$2.50.)
Mr. Lippman presents his substitute
for the now worn-out and out-grown
religion of our fathers. His thesis is
a re-statement in modern language
and tempo of the teachings of the
great humanists. His ultimate plea is
that each of us strive to reach a
philosophical maturity leading to a
disinterested partnership with the
world. This attitude, believes Lipp
marin, would enable us to get out of
life the same fullness and satisfaction
as did the humanists of old who de
veloped that outlook.
And Mr. Lippmann is a man to be
taken seriously, and what he says is
worth pondering over. He is not an
ascetic scholar, or religious bigot. He
is a student of the world and of man
kind. He was recently appointed edi
tor of the New York World. Some
of the books he has written are:
"Liberty and the News," "The Stakes
of Diplomacy," "Public Opinion," and
"The Phantom Public."
To get back to the subject of the
book. Lippmann says, "When men
find that they no longer believe seri
ously and deeply that they are gov
erned from heaven, there is anarchy
in their souls until by conscious effort
they find ways of governing them
selves."
Mr. Lippman offers what he sees
as the escape from the chaos of
modernity. His style is frank and
free swinging. He says things in a
way that makes them interesting.

"A Preface to Morals" is divided
into three parts. The first is devoted
to a discussion of what Mr. Lippmann
