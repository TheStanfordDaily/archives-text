# Seniors Asked To Send In Pledges For Class Fund
## 
### 
Seniors who are sending pledges to
the "1929 Class Fund for Instruction
and Research" of the "Alumni Uni
versity Fund" should do so promptly
so that there will be no need for a
personal canvass, Steve Halsted,
class treasurer, said yesterday. In the
past, several of the classes have
stipulated a minimum pledge of $5.
The committee has deemed it best not
to do so, but wishes to leave it en
tirely up to the individual.

The fund is one to which each class
member will contribute as much as
he desires each year. In deciding the
amount which one wishes to pledge,
it should be remembered that contri
butions are made annually only with
the privilege of discontinuing such
payments should it become temporar
ily necessary, Halsted remarked.
