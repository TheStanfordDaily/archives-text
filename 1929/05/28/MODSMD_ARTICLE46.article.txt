# June Number Of Chaparral Will Appear Next Tuesday
## 
### 
So overcome is the Ancient One at
the thought of leaving his dear read
ers in another two weeks, that he
wept bitter tears yesterday which
rusted up the press machinery and
has caused a delay in the publication.
"Contrary to popular belief," said
the Foolish Dodderer, "the June
Chaparral will not go on sale until
Tuesday of next week instead of this
Thursday." Then he brightened up
and wiped his eyes on his long beard.
"But 'twill be all the better to write
for, my dears. Now I can have more
time to think up some good-bye puns
aud boobing for the seniors."
