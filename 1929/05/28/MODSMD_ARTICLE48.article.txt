# REMEDIES FOR POISON OAK ARE SIMPLE, SAY CHEMISTS, BOTANISTS

### Catherine Spaulding 
Chemists and botanists have de
clared that there is no longer any
need for those individuals who are
susceptible to poison oak, or poison
ivy, to suffer from it. There are sev
eral very simple remedies made of
common, non-propriety chemicals,
that will banish poisoning in almost
all eases.
A preventative recommended by I)r.
James B. McNair of the Field Museum
of Natural History, Chicago, is a five
per cent solution of ferric chloride in
water, or in a mixture of water, alco
hol, and glycerine. This is to be
washed on all exposed skin surfaces
before going into the woods, and al
lowed to dry without wiping. The thin
deposit of iron salt neutralizes the
ivy poison immediately upon contact.
Dr. Clelia Mosher, Stanford Women's
Medical Advisor, recommends another
preventive—French Castile soap lath
er allowed to dry on the skin.
For those who have already become
poisoned, Dr. James F. Couch of the
United States Department of Agricul
ture recommends a wash of a three
per cent solution of potassium perman
ganate. This oxidizes the poison, and
healing follows rapidly. The remedy
leaves the skin brown, but the stain
may be removed with a one per cent
solution of oxalic acid.
