# SPORTS OF 1929
## A
						Leaping Tiger 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Among the 1928 Olympians who will
be seen in action on Franklin Field,
Philadelphia, on May 31 and June 1,
in the annual 1.C.4-A. meet, is a tall
young blond who wears the orange
and black of old Nassau, and who
scampers around from one event to
another almost as much as Princeton's
famous "Pelican" Thompson used to
do.
The name of this young athlete is
Benjamin V. I). Hedges and, with
those initials, he just had to go out
for track, so, blessed with a fine pair
of legs, he took up high-jumping and
was able to tie for second in the rain
and mud at the 192S 1.C.4-A. meet at
Cambridge, Mass. Encouraged by this
success, he tried out for the United
Slates Olympic team and placed
fourth in the great meet at Cambridge

to Bob King, "Chuck" McGinnis, and
Harold Osborn, with a fine leap of 6
feet, 3 inches.
At Amsterdam, Ben Hedges was one
of the surprises of the American team.
He tied for second with Menard, of
France, at 6 feet, 3% inches, defeat
ing Osborn, the world's record-holder,
and then won the jump-off for the
silver medal and the honor that goes
with it. Believe me, Mr. B. V. D.
Hedges was one happy boy when that
competition was over!
Recently, in the annual Yale-Prince
ton dual meet, Ben scored fifteen
points all by himself, set two new
records (in the high hurdles and the
high jump), and won the broad jump
with a single leap. His nimble legs
and stout heart kept Princeton from
being utterly routed, for Yule won the
meet 86 to 49.
