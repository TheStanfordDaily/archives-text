## 
### 
SEWARD, Alaska, May 27. (/P)â€”
Stories of heroism and efficient work
that prevented a heavy loss of life
as the steamer Aleutian sank in seven
minutes off Kodiak Island, Alaska,
yesterday, reached here late today by
radio.
Although the vessel had a bad list
and sank rapidly only a few persons
suffered minor injuries and the only
death was that of Manuel Dorras, ship
janitor, who went back to obtain a
"lucky horseshoe."

President Hoover has been given a
pass, enclosed in an elephant hide
cane, for all games in the National
League.
