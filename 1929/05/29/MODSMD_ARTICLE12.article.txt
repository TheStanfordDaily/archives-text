# EAST BUZZING WITH TALK OF CARD TRACK CHANCES; TEMPLETON'S IDEA
## 
### 
NEW YORK, May 28. (&)—Most
everyone except their coach, "Dink"
Templeton, has had something to say
about how and why Stanford's track
and field athletes should romp off with
the intercollegiate championships this
week at Philadelphia.
It seems fair enough, therefore, to
let "Dink" have the floor for an analy
sis of the Cardinal strength for the
Big Meet. Here's what he writes the
Associated Press about the 14 men he
will send into action at Franklin
Field.
"Hec Dyer, 9 4-5 and 21 2-5 for the
sprints, a long, skinny runner with
plenty of power and lots of room for
improvement.
"Ross Nichols, who has had no com
petition so far this year and should
be just right (for the 120-yard high
hurdleß).
"Podge Smith, a nice hurdler who
has done 15 seconds and has improved
more than any man on the squad.
"Johnny Morrison, 48 2-5 for the
440, also greatly Improved.
"Harlow Rothert, who seems to be
consistently two feet better than he
was last year in the shot and is just
commencing to catch onto the dißCus.
"Eric Krenz, who has been in a
slump in both the discus and shot

since his great early season start, but
who is due to break out of it. He was
down with 'flu' in midseason and
hasn't snapped clear out of it.
"Leo Kibby, third last year in the
javelin, consistent around 200 feet, as
is Bill Sparling, who was fourth.
"Virg Dowell, who broad-jumped
24-1 in our Big Meet, but has slumped;
and 'Skinny' Anderson, a consistent
23-foot jumper.
"Ray Tandy and Norm McLeod, dis
cus men who have hit 140 but have
shown much greater possibilities.
"Ralph Madison, a 6-1 high jumper,
who hadn't show.n a thing all season
until about a week ago.
"Ward Edmonds, 13-6 in the pole,
15 flat in the high hurdles, and 23 3-5
in the low hurdles. Will probably run
him in the highs and pole.
"It is a strong team for the East,"
concludes Templeton, "only because
of the presence of Krenz and Rothert.
If they should go bad, it would be no
trouble at all for us to blow the meet."
The Eastern experts expect little
or no "blowing." They look for Stan
ford to win by anywhere from 10 to
20 points, although the battle may be
much closer than last year, whon the
Cardinals led their nearest rival, Yale,
by 17 2-3 points.
