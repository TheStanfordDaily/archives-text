# HOUSE APPROVES TARIFF BILL BY 264 TO 147 VOTE
## New Measure Will Allow Hoover More Power in Rate Changing 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 28. (&)â€”'The
tariff bill written by the Ways and
Means Committee Republicans fuid
designed to afford additional protec
tion from foreign competition to thou
sands of products of American farms
and factories, was passed by the
House today by a vote of 254 to 147.

The measure, carrying substantial
increases in import duties on articles
embraced in every section of the
seven-year-old Fordney-McCumber law,
provides for a reorganization of the
tariff commission and the granting of
increased power to the President in
the matter of changing rates. It now
goes to the Senate, where the finance
committee plans to hold extensive
hearings before reporting it for con
sideration on the floor.
With plans under way for an all
summer recess, it was the opinion of
Republican leaders tonight that the
proposed legislation would not be
talten up by the Senate itself for sev
eral months.
Passed by a margin of 117 votes,
the bill was given the final House
stamp of approval four months and
! three weeks from the day the subject
| was tackled id public hearings and
| after more than 100 amendments pi'O
! posed by the Ways and Means Com
mittee had been given further ap
proval en bloc.
The measure recreates the tariff
commission by giving the President
authority to terminate the terms of
the present six commissioners at his
will by sending the names of their
successors to the Senate for confirma
tion. He could retain any present
member, however, if he so desired.
The new commission would be com
posed of seven members instead of six
and the President would be author
ized to ignore party affiliations in
selecting his appointees. The present
law provides that not more than three
commissioners may be of the same
political party.
Salaries of the commissioners would
be raised from $7,500 to $12,000 and
their terms would be for seven years
instead of twelve as at present.
