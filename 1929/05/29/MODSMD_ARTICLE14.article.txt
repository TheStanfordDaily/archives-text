# Liquor Suspects Plead Not Guilty To Charges
## 
### 
RENO, Nev., May 28. (/P) â€”Sixteen
of the men indicted by the federal
grand jury and arrested in Reno on
charges of selling alcoholic liquor
Saturday, entered pleas of not guilty
in federal court at Carson City today.
The authorities on Saturday expected
them, in view of the Jones law, to
plead guilty and be fined, so today's
action was a surprise.
