# SENIORS TO PRESENT "NOT HERBERT" FIRST TIME ON WEST COAST
## Four-Act Farce Tinged With Mystery; Ticket Sale To Start June 6 
### John Rogers 
Farce, tinged with mystery and
melodrama —that is what makes How
ard Young's four-act play, "Not Her
bert," chosen as the Senior Farce for
production in the Assembly Hall on
the night of June 12, one of the fast
est comedies of recent years. Never
before presented on the Coast, the
Stanford audience will be the first in
the West to see Herbert, ostensibly a
moon-struck, poetic simpleton, turn
deep, desperate criminal —all because
the spirit of poesy and moonlight in
fluence bim. He's funny that way.

With three different settings to plan,
Harold Helvenston in this, his tenth
campus show, again has to surmount
the difficulties presented by the in
adequate Assembly Hall stage and a
small stage crew. At the same time,
he has bad to design two wealthy
Long Island drawing rooms and a
New York study. He has provided for
hi,? expected quick changes by using
a "skeleton" setting, in which differ
ent flats are put on the permanent
frame of the scene.

In many ways, with its wall safe
and hidden compartments and other
extraordinary contrivances, this will be
one of the trickiest group of sets Hel
venston has designed for Stanford
dramatics. And, matching the fast
comedy of the play, the settings are
painted in light colors. The first scene
should be particularly interesting, for
it will be the first time that a campus
piay has been given a definite touch
of the moderne.

Tickets will go on sale in front of
the Women's Clubhouse on June 6 —
Thursday of next week—at $1.00 and

tained at the A.S.S.U. office in the
