# B.A.C. TO DECIDE ON WOMEN'S GYM AT NEXT MEETING
## 
### 
"Whether or not the Stanford wo
men are to have a new gymnasium
will undoubtedly be decided at the
next meeting of the Board of Athletic
Control on June 3," declared A1 Mas
ters, general manager of that organiza
tion, in an interview to the Daily
yesterday.
The Finance Committee of the
Board has placed this item at the
head of the list on their building pro
gram for 1929-30. Although this does
not necessarily mean that favorable
action will be taken by the 8.A.C., it
does mean that the matter will come
before the Board for immediate con
sideration.
It is thought that the Board is in
favor of supplying the needs of the
women. A gym with adequate facili
ties, rather than a building which will
require yearly expenditures for a cer
tain length of time, will be the. type
of gym the Board is expected to take
action on.
Rosamund Clarke, chairman of the
A.W.S. New Gymnasium Committee,
called a meeting of that group Mon
day to discuss the progress of the
gymnasium campaign and to make
further plans.
