# WAGNER IS AWARDED SPECIAL CERTIFICATE FOR ENGINEERING WORK
## 
### 
Edmond Wagner, Stanford chapter
of American Society of Mechanical
Engineers, has just been awarded a
certificate of commendation for spe
cial attainments in the field of mech
anical engineering. In addition to this
certificate, Wagner will receive a
junior membership in the society for
one year and the society pin.
Each year the San Francisco Sec
tion selects a student from one of the
tololwing universities: University of
California, Santa Clara, and Stanford
University. The award is based on the
recommendation of the honorary
chairman of the student branch and
upon the section committee's opinion
of the student. Judgments are based
on scholarship, outside activities, and
general attitude to work.
Wagner recently talked before a
joint meeting of the three universi
ties' student branches on "Welded
Joints and Fittings." He demonstrated
such an understanding of the subject
that the San Francisco Society de
cided he should receive the award.
In addition to this talk, Wagner was
judged favorably on the fact that he
has worked his way through Stanford,
and has been active in outside affairs.
