# Senior Class To Donate Fountain To University
## 
### 
The Senior Class gift this year will
be a donation toward a fountain fund,
it was derided at a meeting last night.
Three hundred and fifty dollars was
voted toward raising the necessary
$1100 to build a fountain in front of
the Library.
The seniors decided that any resi
due in the class treasury should go
to the Convalescent Home. Senior
Week celebrations were discussed,
and committee reports heard. A sug
gestion was made that graduation
exercises be held in the stadium in
stead of in the Memorial Church, so
that there would be plenty of Beats.
