# Liberal Educational System

### 
Educational system has been attacked for the last twenty or thirty
years throughout the country. Meiklejohn at Wisconsin, llolt at Rol
lins, the proposed Harvard plan, these characterize some of the move
ments under way to change the existing system.
The student universally has objected to the mechanical aspect of
education, that is, so many units, so many courses, so many hours of
lectures, so many examinations as the components of a college degree.
The student with initiative and the desire to study certain things as he
saw fit has been highly irked at this situation, this production of brains
by mass methods.
At Stanford in 1925 a movement was begun that in a way makes
amends for the cut and dried aspect of the lock-step system. Under the
title, The Independent Study Plan, a means is offered whereby the stu
dent may use his own initiative in his university work. The plan is open
to students of exceptional qualifications at the beginning of their junior
or senior years.
Dartmouth College has instituted a plan for a very few of its ranking
seniors that goes to the extreme in giving the student freedom in his
educational work. Those chosen to follow the plan will not pay tuition,
will not attend classes if they do not wish to attend, and will not be
required to take any examinations. In short they will be allowed to follow
the intellectual life at Dartmouth as they see fit. This would be the ideal
in education, but unfortunately few students would be strong enough to
follow that plan and get anything from their university life other than
a good time.
Stanford's Independent Study Plan endeavors to give certain latitude
to the student and at the same time put definite checks on him that will
make him direct his studies and get something from them.
