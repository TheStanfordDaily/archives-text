THE SAME OLD STORY
The Big Ten, most puritanic athletic
conference in the country, has taken
action against one of its members be
cause of alleged charges of proselyt
ing.
Major John L. Griffith, high
mogul of the Loop, will arrive
this morning to personally inves
tigate the charge that the Univer
sity of lowa has used undue per
suasion in obtaining men who
can suitably care for her athletic
activities.
On Saturday afternoon a meeting of
the conference faculty committee was
held in Evanston, 111. In a secret ses- j
sion the Hawkeye institution was ex- j
pelled as a member of the league, j
This resulted in an attack upon Paul j
E. Belting, deposed Director of Ath
letics at lowa, who declared several
months ago, when his resignation was
asked for, that he had lost his fight '
for clean athletics there.
Rotten-egging, as seems to have be
come the vogtle among lowa institu
tions, was resorted to by the under
graduates in their anger against Belt
ing. Police action was necessary to
halt the violence.
The bitterness was somewhat
alleviated yesterday by the rumor
that Northwestern, Purdue, and
Indiana were also to be expelled
from the ranks of the once mighty
"Big Ten." The report came fol
lowing a story that Pat Page, In
diana's coach, was receiving
$12,000 annually for his coaching,
part of which sum was paid by
alumni of that institution.
Unless some drastic action is
taken soon, it appears very much
as though the whole conference
would be thrown into an uproar
with a general mud-slinging con
test as a fitting climax to opera
tions. It Is unlikely that any of
the Big Ten have a clean slate in
the matter of subsidizing athletes.
Probably the common practice of
obtaining them would have gone
on for years without any trouble
had not action been taken against
the Hawkeyes. And even after

the smoke clears away and things
quiet down there will be no radi
cal change from the system which
has caused so much comment dur
ing the past few days.

THE SAME OLD STORY
The Big Ten, most puritanic athletic
conference in the country, has taken
action against one of its members be
cause of alleged charges of proselyt
ing.
Major John L. Griffith, high
mogul of the Loop, will arrive
this morning to personally inves
tigate the charge that the Univer
sity of lowa has used undue per
suasion in obtaining men who
can suitably care for her athletic
activities.
On Saturday afternoon a meeting of
the conference faculty committee was
held in Evanston, 111. In a secret ses- j
sion the Hawkeye institution was ex- j
pelled as a member of the league, j
This resulted in an attack upon Paul j
E. Belting, deposed Director of Ath
letics at lowa, who declared several
months ago, when his resignation was
asked for, that he had lost his fight '
for clean athletics there.
Rotten-egging, as seems to have be
come the vogtle among lowa institu
tions, was resorted to by the under
graduates in their anger against Belt
ing. Police action was necessary to
halt the violence.
The bitterness was somewhat
alleviated yesterday by the rumor
that Northwestern, Purdue, and
Indiana were also to be expelled
from the ranks of the once mighty
"Big Ten." The report came fol
lowing a story that Pat Page, In
diana's coach, was receiving
$12,000 annually for his coaching,
part of which sum was paid by
alumni of that institution.
Unless some drastic action is
taken soon, it appears very much
as though the whole conference
would be thrown into an uproar
with a general mud-slinging con
test as a fitting climax to opera
tions. It Is unlikely that any of
the Big Ten have a clean slate in
the matter of subsidizing athletes.
Probably the common practice of
