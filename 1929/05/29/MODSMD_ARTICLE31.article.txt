Anthony Comstock —Roundsman of the
Lord. By Heywood Broun and
Margaret Leech. (Albert and
Charles Boni, New Work.)
"The United States is one great so
ciety for the suppression of vice." —
From the District Attorney's Plea —
U.S. versus D. M. Bennet. And An
thony Comstock, from 1862 until 1915
was the guiding light of this great
drive which left no spot in America
untouched during all these years. He
it was, who cut such a wide swath
across the field of American reform
movements that he earned the enmity
of persons in all nations. Photography
and salacious literature were An
thony's diet day after day and he
never ceased fighting the publishers
and vendors of this type of literature.
In fact, so great was his zeal that
after a few years of warfare the books
and magazines left to clean up were
few and far between.

Anthony Comstock was born in New
Canaan, Connecticut, in 1844. He came
ot staunch Puritan stock and as Hey
wood Broun says, "Perhaps the bleak
countryside and his heritage of strict
living had something to do with his
acts of later years." At an early ago
religion became a great influence on
his life and from then on, as Anthony
himself put it, he would be content if
only Jesus were satisfied. At eighteen
he had raided his first saloon and
after that his life was more or less a
succession of just such events.

The Civil War broke into his re
forming career but even (luring the
war he found time to conduct prayer
meetings and to arrange for church
services. He never drank, nor used
profane language, nor did he have
any use for anyone that did. The story
is told of how an army captain fell
from Anthony's estimation by his use
of profanity. Such zeal and devoutness
must surely reach its reward some
day.

And Comstock's was not long in
coming. By 1868 he had definitely en
tered the ranks of the reformers and
in subsequent years no field of vice
was left untouched by him. Porno
graphy was his long suit. Kaloons and
gambling dens were lots of fun but
when it came to runniDg down these
"vicious threats against the young
people of our land," as Comstock was
wont to call them, there was just not

anybody able to keep up the fast pace
that he set. Heywood Broun summed

I it up in this manner: "When sex flew
in the window, Anthony flew off the
j handle."
In later years art caine in for a
grand beating. At least Anthony at
tempted to give it one. Anything nude
j was enough to drive the old man wild
, and in those days of "September
Morn" and others he had quite a few
chances to become pleasurably ex
cited. Bernarr MacFadden was just
then beginning to discover the beaut}
of the female form and the value of
exercise and few clothes to develop
! it. To illustrate it MacFadden put on a
"Beauty Show" in Madison Square
Garden. Anthony got wind of the thins
and as a result of the publicity which
he gave it the show literaMy boomed.
As it turned out, the show was more
or less of a flop. According to a story
in the New York Times they were
terribly disappointed by "a tame spec
tacle of athletic sports" and a series
nf tableaux which included a chesty
man as Ajax defying the lightning.
In his last years birth control and
kindred subjects began to be talked
about. But poor old Anthony was too
far gone to take much of an interest
in this travesty on God's idea of how
nature should be run, and in 1915 he
l died —a truly righteous and God-fear
ing man if ever there was one. In his
diary we find, "One heart throb and
all is over. How stands the record?
Things I ought to have done left un
done, done things I ought not, stum
bled and fallen many times, sinned
over and over again, all unworthiuess,
—yet, blessed thought, one Name is
all sufficient. To that dear refuge let
me fly." And thus he passed away
and the ranks of the reformers lost a
fiery spirit who all these years had
carried the cross of righteousness in
the manner he thought best.
Mr. Broun and Miss Leech have
given us a good picture of this zealous
! man and in doing so they have also
j painted a good picture of all the re
-1 form movements of the past sixty
i years. We would recommend this book
if only for the reason that it explains
| and traces in fine fashion all the great
social movements that lead up to the
j society which we have today. Besides
j all this it is written in fine style
and in the vein that only H. L. Menck
| en and Hey wood Broun seem to have
acquired. And we will also guarantee
that there are some things in the
book that will surprise this callous
; generation of college men and women.
