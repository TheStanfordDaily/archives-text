# CABBAGES and THINGS

Let us have a last fling or two. For
those who have missed us during the
last week or so, we will admit that
experience has made us a very elusive
target.
FABLES of the FARM
(With a bow at Chaparral)
—Only these aren't fables. Now it
can be told —since Rushing is over —
how seriously the Freshmen took it
all. At least three authentic stories
have come to our attention from the
'29 Greens Picking Season. You
should have seen the ones that got
away.
The first concerns the Freshman
who was determined he was going
Row.
"Yessir," he said with a beautiful
seriousness, "I like it better up there.
The living conditions are better. (!)
I'm getting pretty sick of this Hall."
"But you don't have to live in En
cina, you know," a Staunch Hall Man
(mythical figure) pointed out.
"Well, yeh, but there's the food.
Why, I been up on the Row a lot this
week and alt the meals are better'n
we get here at Encina!"
Then there was the Frosh who was
inquiring concerning the fraternal af
filiations of various prominent char
acters. Soon he came to Dink Temple
ton.
"Say, what house did oP Dink be
long to?" asked the Freshman, an
eaper light shining in his eyes.
"None at all," a club man replied.
"He was a Breaker."
"WHAT!" yelled the yearling. "Do
you mean to tell me that Dink Tem
pleton couldn't make a fraternity?!!"
Last, but certaiuly not least, is the
anecdote of the Freshman who was
asked to go to San Francisco on the
ar.nual party of one of the Hall clubs
—name on request.
Rut he had a brother on the Row.
This worthy had put his foot down.
"No, sir," he said, "you stay away
from those roughies."
One of the Club members argued it
out with the Freshman.
"Aw, come along," he urged.
"No, I guess maybe I better not."
"You like the fellas, don't yuh?"
"Gee—l'll say."
"Well, then come along."
"I know, but my brother doesn't
want me to go. I asked him."
"Well, your brother isn't running
your life, is he? You're independent—
you can do as you like, can't you?"
"Gee, that's right," exclaimed the
Frosh. "Say, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll go ask my brother again!"
Governor Shafer of North Dakota
has approved a bill putting the en
tire slate in the Central Standard
Time zone.
