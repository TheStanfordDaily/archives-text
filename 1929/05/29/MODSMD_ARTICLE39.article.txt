## 
### 
EAST ST. LOUIS, 111., May 23. (If)â€”
Racing against time to Parks Airport
here from five widely separated start
ing points throughout the United
States, pilots of nine commercial air
planes qualified today for the $5,000
Gardner trophy air race to the Indian
apolis Speedway, and return on Me
morial Day.
Seven other planes out of eighteen
starters finished the race, but did not
figure in today's prize money or quali
fy for the trophy race. No serious ac
cidents marred the races, although
several fliers made forced landings
and several of those who completed
the race barely had enough fuel to
reach the airport.
