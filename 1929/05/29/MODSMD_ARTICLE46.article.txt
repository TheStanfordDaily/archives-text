# Roos Bros. Annual Punting Contest Is To Be Today
## 
### 
The best kickers on Pop Warner's
spring football squad will make a
noble effort to "boot" the pigskin out
lof sight or farther today when the
annual punting contest for the Roos
Brothers trophy is held on the varsity
field.
Lud Frentrup, who has won the con
j teet for the past two years, is favored
Ito repeat his performances. Harlow
j Rothert, who was conceded a chance
to upset Frentrup, is in the East with
the track team, so the blond halfback
should have clear sailing. In the event
| that Frentrup does win, he will get
permanent possession of the trophy.
