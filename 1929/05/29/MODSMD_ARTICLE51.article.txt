# SPORTS OF 1929
## A 						Record-Holder 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
One of the most remarkable of all 1
the world's records that have been
made in track and field sports is Earl |
Thomson's time of fourteen and two- I
fifths seconds in the 120-yard high !
hurdles. It is right in a class with a
9 2-5 hundred yards, or a 47 second
quarter-mile, and any follower of foot
racing knows that you don't see any- J
body running those times more than
once in a blue moon.
The speedy young giant who set
this remarkable record just nine years
ago could still give most of the
hurdlers in the country a good argu
ment, but, as he is a paid coach, and
hence a "pro," he is barred from com
peting with the so-called amateurs.
But Earl Thomson must get many a
thrill as he remembers that day at
Franklin Field, Philadelphia, when he
skimmed over the hurdles like a

swallow to break the intercollegiate
ami the world's record in one mad,
scientific dash down the track.
I remember it very vividly, as I
held the previous intercollegiate rec
ord, of 15 seconds, which Tommy
equaled in his preliminary heat. When
that time was announced, I knew that
the record was surely going to flop,
but never dreamed of any new mark
as low as 14 and 2-sths. Bob Simpson,
who held the previous world's mark
at 14 3-sths, is, like Thomson, now a
coach, being mentor at lowa State
University.
A year later, at the National Colle
giate meet, Earl equaled his own rec
ord in Chicago, when he hadn't had
a spiked shoe on in two weeks. Watch
his Navy team clean up next spring.
His boys have been handicapped by
injuries this year, but he should cash
in in 1930.
