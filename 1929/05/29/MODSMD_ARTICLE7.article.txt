Three Btreet railway trackmen were

against the side of a moving trolley
car. The trackmen were welding rails
and had red lanterns set about them
but the motorist swept through the
lights and went on. His number was
not obtained. John Sullivan, Donald
Keyes, and Thomas Theodas were the
ones injured.
