# "MUSIC AS A LANGUAGE" IS ALLEN'S TOPIC
## 
### 
"The common purpose which all the
arts have is to enrich and beautify a
life which might otherwise be dull,
uninteresting, and material," said
Warren D. Allen in his lecture last
night on "Music as a Language."
Analyzing music in terms of art, he
identified melody with line, illustrat
ing this comparison with the old Eng
lish song, "Danny Boy," in the simple
melody of which there is no empha
sis on tone color. Adding a second
musical element to the same compo
sition, he played it with harmony,
which may be said to be the color of
music; and finally adding the element
of rhythm by giving the words of the
song, he brought out the relation be
tween music and poetry.

"Regardless of which of these three
phases of appeal may dominate the
mind of the listener," continued Mr.
Allen, "the important question is
whether the artist has something to
say. For expression is the common
purpose of all artists. But besides the
emotional impulse necessary to ex
pression, the artist must have a plan
or design formed by the intellect.
There must be coherence. No one is
qualified to judge the beauty of a
single tone; because alone it means
no more than a letter of the lan
guage. It is only in combination with
others that it assumes meaning."
This talk was the introduction to a
series of lecture recitals by Mr. Allen,
to begin next fall, and to deal with
the historical developments und the
appreciation of melody, harmony, and
rhythm in music.
