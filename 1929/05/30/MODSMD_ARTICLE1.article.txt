# CARDINALS SEEK THIRD 4-A TITLE AT PHILADELPHIA
## Fourteen Stanford Performers Favored in Meet Set for Tomorrow and Saturday Krenz, Rothert Mainstays of Cards Ambition to Remain East Track Champions 
### Frank Whiteley 
Fourteen Sons of the Stanford Red,
undefeated in Pacific Coast dual meet
competition this year, will defend their
twice-won title in the fifty-third I.C.
A.A.A.A. Track and Field Champion
ships tomorrow and Saturday at Frank
lin Field, Philadelphia, against the pick
of United States college tracksters.
These fourteen Cards, who vanquished
the powerful Washington, U.S.C., and
California teams successively, are fa
vored to bring the 1.C.4-A. championship
to Stanford for the third time in three
years and to a California university for
the eighth time in the last nine years.
Pre-tneet doping places the probable
Stanford total at thirty-five points, with
a minimum estimate of thirty and a
maximum of forty. I-ast year the Cards
triumphed with a score of forty-three
points.
Depend on Weight Men
It will be up to Eric Krenz and Har
low Rothert, Coach Dink Templeton's
two great weight men, to assure Stan
ford of another 1.C.4-A. trophy. Krenz,
captain-elcct of the 1930 varsity and
unofficial holder of the world's discus
record, is almost a cinch to account for
a first in the platter heaving event and
a first or a second in the shot. Eric was
a double winner in both events at Boston
last year.
His chief competition in the shot will
come from Rothert, whose consistent 50
to 51 foot performances this season give
him the edge. Harlow has been improv
ing in the discus and ought to be good
for a point or two here. If this pair of
Cards does not perform in its usual un
beatable fashion, it will be just "good
by meet" as far as Stanford is concerned.
Then there are the other twelve men.
They are all splendid competitive ath
letes ; but they will be up against the
finest the nation has to offer in the way
of track and field stars. And the Cards
will have to equal or better their seasonal
marks to keep Stanford ahead of the
East's and Middlewest's challengers. The
South will also be represented, and there
will be two other western entrants —Cali-
fornia, U.S.C.
Nichols Favored
Captain Ross Nichols, 1.C.4-A. high
hurdles champion, is a veteran in "big
time" competition and is favored to re
peat in the high sticks. There are other
veterans on the Stanford roster —Leo
Kibby, Bill Sparling, John Morrison,
Ward Edmonds—but there are also seven
men who will be competing in an 1.C.4-A.
meet for the first time.
Podge Smith, hurdler; Hec Dyer,
sprinter; and Norman McLeod, discus
thrower, are all sophomores, but Tem
plcton is figuring each of them for some
points. Smith will back Nichols up in
the highs and will probably be the only
Stanford entry in the lows. Dyer's per
formances in the short distances—9 4-5
and 21 2-s—ought to be good enough to
enable him to break into the scoring col
umn and possibly to take a first. McLeod
is consistent at 140 feet in the discus and
is capable of even better marks.
Leo Kibby and Bill Sparling placed
third and fourth, respectively, in the
1.C.4-A. at Boston, but will have a
harder time doing so in this year's meet,
chiefly because of the appearance this
season of three college javelin throwers
capable of better than 200 feet. They
are Mortcnson of U.S.C., and Curtice and
Churchill of California. The latter two
have bettered the 209-foot mark.
Morrison competed in last year's meet
and weathered his way through the trials
in the quarter-mile to the final heat,
where he failed to place. His lap of
48 2-5 made in the California Inter
collegiate meet in Los Angeles recently
is about the fastest recorded in the United
States this year.
Last comes Ward Edmonds, high point
man in every meet in which Stanford has
taken part this year. Ward has pole
vaulted and run both hurdle races, turn
ing in championship performances in all
three events in almost every meet. He
will probably be used in the pole vault
and high hurdles.
