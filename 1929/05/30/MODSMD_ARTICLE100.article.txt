# MAY MAKE TALKIES IN SEVERAL LANGUAGES
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 29. (/P)â€”Pro
uuction of movies with live heroes, ;
five heroines, and five villains, is re
garded as a possibility by N. D. Gol- ,
den, asistant chief of the motion pie- I
tures division of the Department of
Commerce.
It is all on account of the talkies. I
It seems that residents of Paris,
Buenos Aires, Rome, and, for that
matter, London, can't always under
stand what it is that the gunman hero
calls his moll. And, if they can't
understand, Mr. Golden reasons, j
there's always a possibility that the !
foreigners won't care to hear the |
films. People are like that.
So the idea is that separate com
panies speaking American, French,
Spanish, Italian, German, and, pos
sibly English, will rotate on the ex
pensive Hollywood sets, putting out as
many language versions of each pho
toplay as there are markets.
