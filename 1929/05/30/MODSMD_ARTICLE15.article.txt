# ELEVEN DOLLAR REBATE TO BE GIVEN BOARDERS BY COMMONS
## Money Will Be Available in Encina Custodian's Office Today For All Regular Boarders During Winter And Spring Quarters 
### ALLAN HART 
A rebate of eleven dollars will be paid by Encina Commons to students who
have been regular boarders during the winter and spring quarters of this year,
according to announcement made yesterday.
The money will probably be available in the Custodian's office at Encina hall
some time today. Lists of students to whom money is due will be posted in the

halls today.
Action in favor of a rebate was taken
some time ago by the student board of
governors, who met to determine what
should be done with profits made during
the year by the Commons. It was be
lieved then that the rebate should be made
on the basis of the spring quarter, but it
was later found that this would not be
fair in every case. A check was there
fore made by the university auditor's
office to determine in individual cases to
whom the rebate should go. In general,
all who have held regular coupon books
for the last two quarters will get the re
bate; exceptions will be made when jus
tified in individual cases, however.
University officials pointed out that
the price announced at the first of the
year is an estimate, based on the expected
number of student boarders and on the
probable market prices. The present re
bate, available because of profits made
since last February, is possible because of
the absences of the freshmen during this
quarter and because of a slight drop in
market prices.
