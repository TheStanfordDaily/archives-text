# FACULTY-STUDENT TEA WILL BE SPONSORED BY FELLOWSHIP CLUB
## 
### 
An hour's conversation over a cup of
hot tea, and a place where students and
faculty may meet informally will be
provided for the remaining days of this
quarter and next year by the Stanford
Fellowship in the Wcmen's Clubhouse.
From 4 to 5 o'clock, beginning next Mon
day and lasting through finals, free tea
will be served on every afternoon except
Saturday and Sunday to students and
faculty.
The eighteen members of the Fellow
ship Board have been sponsoring visits to
the homes of professors for the past year.
Next year the Fellowship plans to estab
lish a permanent meeting place for stu
dents and faculty in the Gubhouse. Tea
will be served each afternoon next year.
The Fellowship Board itself will pre
side over the afternoon social gatherings,
and will also assume responsibility for the
affairs. It is planned to extend the mem
bership in the Fellowships to 200. Both
students and faculty may belong. Mem
bership may be secured at any of the
teas this quarter which are open to all
students and faculty who are interested
in attending.
