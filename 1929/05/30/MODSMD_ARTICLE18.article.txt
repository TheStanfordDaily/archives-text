# BASSETT WILL READ "JOHN BROWN" POEM IN LECTURE TUESDAY
## 
### 
"John Brown's Body," which recently
took the Pulitzer Prize, will be read by
Professor Lee Emerson Bassett as the
last Tuesday evening program of the
year, on June 4 at 7 :30 in the Little The
ater.
Professor Bassett has selected portions
to read which will give glimpses of the
entire narrative, including the more strik
ing situations and characters in such a
way as to give the reading unity. Be
cause of its stirring narrative and its
realistic portrayal of the atmosphere of
the times and characters, Bassett feels
that in "John Brown's Body" Stephen
Vincent Benet, the poet, has accomplished
a great work, ft has to the average per
son, he believes, the appeal of a novel.
