### 
Today's issue marks the close of
Volume 75. No longer will the pound
ing of typewriters, muffled (?) curses,
and the stentorian roars of Charley
Wegner calling: for more copy be heard
through the still night. For, let it be
known, 'tis but nine days till finals,
and, like all the rest of harrassed
humanity, the Daily staff must spend
its time in rest and prayer to get
ready for the coming onslaught. Finis
coronat opus!
