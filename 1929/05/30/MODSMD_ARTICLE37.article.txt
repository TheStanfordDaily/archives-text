# Gasoline Stations Fraud Halted After Two Weeks
## 
### 
SEATTLE, May 28. (/P) â€”L. C. Hood,
who established a chain of more than
30 gasoline stations here within two
weeks, was sought tonight on charges
of perpetrating a wholesale fraud
which was believed to have netted
him more than $5,000 a week.
Hood, who said he came from Los
Angeles, was charged with represent
ing himself as head of a California
oil company bearing his name and
intent on starting a new gasoline war
here. In a whirlwind organization he
leased a string of service stations and
employed managers, exacting $100 or
$200 from each, supposedly as a bond.
