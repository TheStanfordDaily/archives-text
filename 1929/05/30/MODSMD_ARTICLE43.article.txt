# Aged Prospector Seeks Aid To Continue Mining
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, May 29 (JP).â€”Half
a century's search for a bonanza today
found Cliff Deyo, 73-year-old prospector,
in Los Angeles seeking financial assist
ance in mining heavy deposits of tur
quoise, bloodstone, and agate and some
gold he claims to have discovered in
Death Valley.
The weight of a 20-pound cold stone
meteor dug from a clay bank in the
furnace-hot valley, which he carried with
him to town, had not "burdened the spirits
of the veteran of many gold rushes.
Failure to sell this remnant to a museum
did not disturb him.
