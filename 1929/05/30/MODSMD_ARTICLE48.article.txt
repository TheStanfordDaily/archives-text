# YELLOW JUNE LIT DUE NEXT TUESDAY

Not content with gazing at poppies,
frozen orange juice at the Union, and
the tan displayed about the women's
steps, the editor has decided to garb
the last number of the year of the
Stanford Literary Magazine in a gor
geous yellow. And so dazzled have the
publishers become at this wild out
buist, that the book will be delayed
one day and will not be out to blind
the campus until Tuesday.
Besides the usual Green Street
Theatre review, the June issue will
have four short stories, four essays,
and a technical stage article by Har
old Helvenston. There is a frontis
piece by Elizabeth Jackson depicting
the Inner Quad at the place where
the class plates are laid.
