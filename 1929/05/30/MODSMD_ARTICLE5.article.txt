# Edgren, Famous Sport Writer, Lauds Pacific Coast Athletic Teams
## 
### 
"The West has a great advantage I
In climate, and in men too." That's
the way Robert Edgren, syndicate
sports writer who was visiting on the
campus yesterday, explains the West's
athletic superiority. The advantage in
men, he pointed out, comes from the
fact that the eastern coast is being
crowded with a foreign population and
that this condition has not as yet
traveled West.
Edgren has just returned to the
Pacific Coast from the East where he
has been in frequent contact with
sporting authorities and coaches. The
changed attitude of the East toward
Western athletics particularly im
pressed Edgren.
"Visiting New York last month, I
found a new condition," he ermarked.
"For many years, ever since the
Pacific Coast started its competition
in athletic sports against the Eastern
college teams, the East has been ex
tremely critical of Western perform
ances. There always has been talk
about 'western timing.' The East did
n't believe anything it heard about
Western sprinting until Charlie Pad
dock won the hundred and the two
twenty in an Eastern championship
meet, equalling his own world's rec
ords in both events. And when the
effect of that performance wore off.
the East went back to its talk of
'Western timing' and 'Western bluff'
in all sports.
"But this time in New York I didn't
hear a single uncomplimentary word
about Western sport. Everyone said,
'Gee, that Stanford team that came
back and beat the Army last year
was a corker. Greatest team seen hera
siuce the days of White and DeWitt
and Shevlin.
"I assured them Stanford did â€”had
played a tough tied game with Cali
fornia only a week before. 'Well,' they
said, 'if there are any other teams
that can make THAT team work out
there, football has moved West.'
"And that's something of an admis
sion for any Easterner, brought up
in the notion that the sun rises over
the Atlantic Ocean.
"And Stanford's track team! New
York sporting writers this year were
hopeless for the first time and came
right out and admitted that Stanford
really had a chance to win the Inter
collegiates at Philadelphia.
"Of course, with California, South
ern California, and Stanford winning
the big Eastern track and field meet
year after year, and an eastern col
lege, Yale, breaking in only once since
the slide started, it would be hard for
the East to think that 'Western tim
ing' is responsible for everything now."
