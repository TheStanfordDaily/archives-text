# Here Ends The First Lesson
## 
### 
This is the final edition of Volume 75 of the Stanford Daily. The
Editor ends his work without regret and with the belief that he has
served to the best of his ability. During his term of office, the Daily has
concentrated its attention upon several things.
First, it has supported the New Theatre for Stanford Movement to
the extent of some dozen editorials and many galleys of news, ihe editor
believes that this is a most worthy cause. Initiated by Hammer and
Coffin Society and backed by the student body, the movement, it is true,
has raised only some four thousand dollars. Vet in the raising of this
sum, the movement has been given an impetus which will not be balked.
The editor hopes that the War Memorial Fund of $117,000 may be used
toward the project. This aided by a generous benefactor or two should
enable the New Theatre for Stanford to materialize within the next few
years.
The Daily instigated a campus questionnaire on Prohibition. Not once
did know that whatever small modicum of campus thought it focused on
did know that whatever small modicum o campus thought it ocused on
the problem amply justified its effort. Prohibition has not been a success.
The Daily believes this and is backed in its opinion by the majority of
the student body. Perhaps this generation, when it is in power, providing
it continues to believe as it does now, will be able to change this present
international joke.
Illegal rushing was rampant during the men's rushing season. The
Daily called attention to this fact the morning before pledging day. No
surer proof of the inadequacy of the present rushing system can be had
than the manner in which rushing went on this quarter.
The Inter-fraternity Council may next year make necessary revision
of the system and, considering the inertia of people to change existing
rules, it may not. Nothing was done this year. Next year may see a more
capable Council.
The evident stampede of the first year men for the Row points to
the increasing influence of the fraternity in Stanford life. Organizations
such as the Greek letter fraternities and sororities and the eating clubs
are doing more to tear down the democratic spirit characteristic of
Stanford in the past than any other single thing. That spirit of equality
and fair play which gives every man his due upon his merit and for no
other reason cannot exist where there are organized groups pushing the
interests of their members regardless of merit. This can be witnessed
in elections and appointments.
If it is postulated that wherever there are men living in a large group
there will be small groups which by their very nature of exclusiveness
cannot be democratic, then the Row and the clubs must be accepted and
put up with. Yet. this is far from the ideal of democracy, the ideal that
has made it possible for the poorest man to come here and make a name
for himself despite family position, wealth, or affiliations. The organized
group will kill this if the present trend continues.
What of the Daily's investigation of the Commons eating conditions?
Much criticism came from the Administration indirectly and the man
agement of the Commons because of this investigation. The Daily real
ized from the start that it was limited by its own ignorance in the com
plex matter of the management of a large eating establishment. But the
simple fact of a too high price stood out clearly. No business tycoon
was needed to see this. Working on this basis the Daily investigated
eating conditions elsewhere on the campus and compiled a comparative
price which showed that the price was high. Until the Administration
and the Commons management lie in their graves, they will maintain that
those figures meant nothing. Perhaps they meant nothing, but the Com
mons has declared today that an eleven dollar rebate will be given to the
Commons boarders. Perhaps the Daily was wrong? Who knows?
Then the flurry over crew. For ten years the return of crew had
been bruited about the campus. Countless editors had written their little
essays on the matter and it ended there. The Daily this year wanted to
get something definite on the matter. Another questionnaire. Does the
student body want crew reinstated? The answer was in the affirmative
by a narrow margin, too narrow to endeavor to reinstate the sport against
the Board of Athletic Control's opposition. But the affair raised a deeper
point.
Crew cannot be reinstated because of manpower. This was the most
potent argument flung by those opposing its return. However an inves
tigation of manpower revealed that all sports have felt the University's
diminishing manpower this year thanks to the elimination of the Lower
Division. The years to come will see an increased lack of manpower.
Stanford's great teams will exist 110 more. Who cares? Evidently the
Administration does not. Despite the revenue, despite the national pres
tige coming from sports, the Administration will undoubtedly continue
its plan and Stanford will lose one of its finest things, intercollegiate
sport.
Then the dear, dear Five Hundred and their little thirty-nine year old
pipe dream of a new gymnasium. My how the little dears fluttered when
crew was suggested. They scratched and stuck stickers and fumed and
now by gollies it looks like that old Shylock miser the B.A.C. is going
to crash through and make the musty pipe dream come true. The Daily
sincerely hopes the women will get what they are after. The University
has passed them by these many years, perhaps the B.A.C. will help them.
The editor has, during this volume, made errors in judgment, he has
made many mistake's, and he is thankful for all of them. From those
errors and those mistakes he has learned more than he could have learned
in a thousand dry tomes. For four years the Daily has signified Stanford
and all Stanford means to him. Whatever he has given the Daily can
only be an infinitesimal part of what the Daily has given him. Perhaps
he will graduate not a scholar, but he would rather graduate having been
editor of the Daily than with any other honor or accomplishment to his
credit. He will not weigh his work. That he leaves to his friends and
particularly his enemies.
Believing that the editorship means so much, his sincere congratula
tion of his successor, Merle F. Emry, has a very deep basis. May his
term be as profitable to him and as worthwhile as the present editor's
has been to him.
To Milton Silverman, the outgoing editor expresses his deepest grati
tude. Few men have worked with more energy, with more ingenuity, or
with more loyalty to the Daily than has Silverman.
No election was harder fought than the last. Emry and Silverman by
their competence and their efforts to win the position made the Daily
from the newspaper point of view the news sheet that it has been.
With as fine men in line for advancement 011 the staff the future of
the Daily augurs well. May the Daily become outstanding among the
newspapers of American universities.
And now, the job is done.

Coffin Society and backed by the student body, the movement, it is true,
has raised only some four thousand dollars. Vet in the raising of this
sum, the movement has been given an impetus which will not be balked.
The editor hopes that the War Memorial Fund of $117,000 may be used
toward the project. This aided by a generous benefactor or two should
enable the New Theatre for Stanford to materialize within the next few
years.
The Daily instigated a campus questionnaire on Prohibition. Not once
did know that whatever small modicum of campus thought it focused on
did know that whatever small modicum o campus thought it ocused on
the problem amply justified its effort. Prohibition has not been a success.
The Daily believes this and is backed in its opinion by the majority of
the student body. Perhaps this generation, when it is in power, providing
it continues to believe as it does now, will be able to change this present
international joke.
Illegal rushing was rampant during the men's rushing season. The
Daily called attention to this fact the morning before pledging day. No
surer proof of the inadequacy of the present rushing system can be had
than the manner in which rushing went on this quarter.
The Inter-fraternity Council may next year make necessary revision
of the system and, considering the inertia of people to change existing
rules, it may not. Nothing was done this year. Next year may see a more
capable Council.
The evident stampede of the first year men for the Row points to
the increasing influence of the fraternity in Stanford life. Organizations
such as the Greek letter fraternities and sororities and the eating clubs
are doing more to tear down the democratic spirit characteristic of
Stanford in the past than any other single thing. That spirit of equality
and fair play which gives every man his due upon his merit and for no
other reason cannot exist where there are organized groups pushing the
interests of their members regardless of merit. This can be witnessed
in elections and appointments.
If it is postulated that wherever there are men living in a large group
there will be small groups which by their very nature of exclusiveness
cannot be democratic, then the Row and the clubs must be accepted and
put up with. Yet. this is far from the ideal of democracy, the ideal that
has made it possible for the poorest man to come here and make a name
for himself despite family position, wealth, or affiliations. The organized
group will kill this if the present trend continues.
What of the Daily's investigation of the Commons eating conditions?
Much criticism came from the Administration indirectly and the man
agement of the Commons because of this investigation. The Daily real
ized from the start that it was limited by its own ignorance in the com
plex matter of the management of a large eating establishment. But the
simple fact of a too high price stood out clearly. No business tycoon
was needed to see this. Working on this basis the Daily investigated
eating conditions elsewhere on the campus and compiled a comparative
price which showed that the price was high. Until the Administration
and the Commons management lie in their graves, they will maintain that
those figures meant nothing. Perhaps they meant nothing, but the Com
mons has declared today that an eleven dollar rebate will be given to the
Commons boarders. Perhaps the Daily was wrong? Who knows?
Then the flurry over crew. For ten years the return of crew had
been bruited about the campus. Countless editors had written their little
essays on the matter and it ended there. The Daily this year wanted to
get something definite on the matter. Another questionnaire. Does the
student body want crew reinstated? The answer was in the affirmative
by a narrow margin, too narrow to endeavor to reinstate the sport against
the Board of Athletic Control's opposition. But the affair raised a deeper
point.
Crew cannot be reinstated because of manpower. This was the most
potent argument flung by those opposing its return. However an inves
tigation of manpower revealed that all sports have felt the University's
diminishing manpower this year thanks to the elimination of the Lower
Division. The years to come will see an increased lack of manpower.
Stanford's great teams will exist 110 more. Who cares? Evidently the
Administration does not. Despite the revenue, despite the national pres
tige coming from sports, the Administration will undoubtedly continue
its plan and Stanford will lose one of its finest things, intercollegiate
sport.
Then the dear, dear Five Hundred and their little thirty-nine year old
pipe dream of a new gymnasium. My how the little dears fluttered when
crew was suggested. They scratched and stuck stickers and fumed and
now by gollies it looks like that old Shylock miser the B.A.C. is going
to crash through and make the musty pipe dream come true. The Daily
sincerely hopes the women will get what they are after. The University
has passed them by these many years, perhaps the B.A.C. will help them.
The editor has, during this volume, made errors in judgment, he has
made many mistake's, and he is thankful for all of them. From those
errors and those mistakes he has learned more than he could have learned
in a thousand dry tomes. For four years the Daily has signified Stanford
and all Stanford means to him. Whatever he has given the Daily can
only be an infinitesimal part of what the Daily has given him. Perhaps
he will graduate not a scholar, but he would rather graduate having been
editor of the Daily than with any other honor or accomplishment to his
credit. He will not weigh his work. That he leaves to his friends and
particularly his enemies.
Believing that the editorship means so much, his sincere congratula
tion of his successor, Merle F. Emry, has a very deep basis. May his
term be as profitable to him and as worthwhile as the present editor's
has been to him.
To Milton Silverman, the outgoing editor expresses his deepest grati
tude. Few men have worked with more energy, with more ingenuity, or
with more loyalty to the Daily than has Silverman.
No election was harder fought than the last. Emry and Silverman by
their competence and their efforts to win the position made the Daily
from the newspaper point of view the news sheet that it has been.
With as fine men in line for advancement 011 the staff the future of
the Daily augurs well. May the Daily become outstanding among the
newspapers of American universities.
And now, the job is done.
This is the final edition of Volume 75 of the Stanford Daily. The
Editor ends his work without regret and with the belief that he has
served to the best of his ability. During his term of office, the Daily has
concentrated its attention upon several things.
First, it has supported the New Theatre for Stanford Movement to
the extent of some dozen editorials and many galleys of news, ihe editor
believes that this is a most worthy cause. Initiated by Hammer and
Coffin Society and backed by the student body, the movement, it is true,
has raised only some four thousand dollars. Vet in the raising of this

enable the New Theatre for Stanford to materialize within the next few
years.
The Daily instigated a campus questionnaire on Prohibition. Not once
did know that whatever small modicum of campus thought it focused on
did know that whatever small modicum o campus thought it ocused on
the problem amply justified its effort. Prohibition has not been a success.
The Daily believes this and is backed in its opinion by the majority of
the student body. Perhaps this generation, when it is in power, providing
it continues to believe as it does now, will be able to change this present
international joke.
Illegal rushing was rampant during the men's rushing season. The
Daily called attention to this fact the morning before pledging day. No
surer proof of the inadequacy of the present rushing system can be had
than the manner in which rushing went on this quarter.
The Inter-fraternity Council may next year make necessary revision
of the system and, considering the inertia of people to change existing
rules, it may not. Nothing was done this year. Next year may see a more
capable Council.
The evident stampede of the first year men for the Row points to
the increasing influence of the fraternity in Stanford life. Organizations
such as the Greek letter fraternities and sororities and the eating clubs
are doing more to tear down the democratic spirit characteristic of
Stanford in the past than any other single thing. That spirit of equality
and fair play which gives every man his due upon his merit and for no
other reason cannot exist where there are organized groups pushing the
interests of their members regardless of merit. This can be witnessed
in elections and appointments.
If it is postulated that wherever there are men living in a large group
there will be small groups which by their very nature of exclusiveness
cannot be democratic, then the Row and the clubs must be accepted and
put up with. Yet. this is far from the ideal of democracy, the ideal that
has made it possible for the poorest man to come here and make a name
for himself despite family position, wealth, or affiliations. The organized
group will kill this if the present trend continues.
What of the Daily's investigation of the Commons eating conditions?
Much criticism came from the Administration indirectly and the man
agement of the Commons because of this investigation. The Daily real
ized from the start that it was limited by its own ignorance in the com
plex matter of the management of a large eating establishment. But the
simple fact of a too high price stood out clearly. No business tycoon
was needed to see this. Working on this basis the Daily investigated
eating conditions elsewhere on the campus and compiled a comparative
price which showed that the price was high. Until the Administration
and the Commons management lie in their graves, they will maintain that
those figures meant nothing. Perhaps they meant nothing, but the Com
mons has declared today that an eleven dollar rebate will be given to the
Commons boarders. Perhaps the Daily was wrong? Who knows?
Then the flurry over crew. For ten years the return of crew had
been bruited about the campus. Countless editors had written their little
essays on the matter and it ended there. The Daily this year wanted to
get something definite on the matter. Another questionnaire. Does the
student body want crew reinstated? The answer was in the affirmative
by a narrow margin, too narrow to endeavor to reinstate the sport against
the Board of Athletic Control's opposition. But the affair raised a deeper
point.
Crew cannot be reinstated because of manpower. This was the most
potent argument flung by those opposing its return. However an inves
tigation of manpower revealed that all sports have felt the University's
diminishing manpower this year thanks to the elimination of the Lower
Division. The years to come will see an increased lack of manpower.
Stanford's great teams will exist 110 more. Who cares? Evidently the
Administration does not. Despite the revenue, despite the national pres
tige coming from sports, the Administration will undoubtedly continue
its plan and Stanford will lose one of its finest things, intercollegiate
sport.
Then the dear, dear Five Hundred and their little thirty-nine year old
pipe dream of a new gymnasium. My how the little dears fluttered when
crew was suggested. They scratched and stuck stickers and fumed and
now by gollies it looks like that old Shylock miser the B.A.C. is going
to crash through and make the musty pipe dream come true. The Daily
sincerely hopes the women will get what they are after. The University
has passed them by these many years, perhaps the B.A.C. will help them.
The editor has, during this volume, made errors in judgment, he has
made many mistake's, and he is thankful for all of them. From those
errors and those mistakes he has learned more than he could have learned
in a thousand dry tomes. For four years the Daily has signified Stanford
and all Stanford means to him. Whatever he has given the Daily can
only be an infinitesimal part of what the Daily has given him. Perhaps
he will graduate not a scholar, but he would rather graduate having been
editor of the Daily than with any other honor or accomplishment to his
credit. He will not weigh his work. That he leaves to his friends and
particularly his enemies.
Believing that the editorship means so much, his sincere congratula
tion of his successor, Merle F. Emry, has a very deep basis. May his
term be as profitable to him and as worthwhile as the present editor's
has been to him.
To Milton Silverman, the outgoing editor expresses his deepest grati
tude. Few men have worked with more energy, with more ingenuity, or
with more loyalty to the Daily than has Silverman.
No election was harder fought than the last. Emry and Silverman by
their competence and their efforts to win the position made the Daily
from the newspaper point of view the news sheet that it has been.
With as fine men in line for advancement 011 the staff the future of
the Daily augurs well. May the Daily become outstanding among the
newspapers of American universities.
And now, the job is done.
This is the final edition of Volume 75 of the Stanford Daily. The
Editor ends his work without regret and with the belief that he has
served to the best of his ability. During his term of office, the Daily has
concentrated its attention upon several things.
First, it has supported the New Theatre for Stanford Movement to
the extent of some dozen editorials and many galleys of news, ihe editor
believes that this is a most worthy cause. Initiated by Hammer and
Coffin Society and backed by the student body, the movement, it is true,
has raised only some four thousand dollars. Vet in the raising of this
sum, the movement has been given an impetus which will not be balked.
The editor hopes that the War Memorial Fund of $117,000 may be used
toward the project. This aided by a generous benefactor or two should
enable the New Theatre for Stanford to materialize within the next few

the student body. Perhaps this generation, when it is in power, providing
it continues to believe as it does now, will be able to change this present
international joke.
Illegal rushing was rampant during the men's rushing season. The
Daily called attention to this fact the morning before pledging day. No
surer proof of the inadequacy of the present rushing system can be had
than the manner in which rushing went on this quarter.
The Inter-fraternity Council may next year make necessary revision
of the system and, considering the inertia of people to change existing
rules, it may not. Nothing was done this year. Next year may see a more
capable Council.
The evident stampede of the first year men for the Row points to
the increasing influence of the fraternity in Stanford life. Organizations
such as the Greek letter fraternities and sororities and the eating clubs
are doing more to tear down the democratic spirit characteristic of
Stanford in the past than any other single thing. That spirit of equality
and fair play which gives every man his due upon his merit and for no
other reason cannot exist where there are organized groups pushing the
interests of their members regardless of merit. This can be witnessed
in elections and appointments.
If it is postulated that wherever there are men living in a large group
there will be small groups which by their very nature of exclusiveness
cannot be democratic, then the Row and the clubs must be accepted and
put up with. Yet. this is far from the ideal of democracy, the ideal that
has made it possible for the poorest man to come here and make a name
for himself despite family position, wealth, or affiliations. The organized
group will kill this if the present trend continues.
What of the Daily's investigation of the Commons eating conditions?
Much criticism came from the Administration indirectly and the man
agement of the Commons because of this investigation. The Daily real
ized from the start that it was limited by its own ignorance in the com
plex matter of the management of a large eating establishment. But the
simple fact of a too high price stood out clearly. No business tycoon
was needed to see this. Working on this basis the Daily investigated
eating conditions elsewhere on the campus and compiled a comparative
price which showed that the price was high. Until the Administration
and the Commons management lie in their graves, they will maintain that
those figures meant nothing. Perhaps they meant nothing, but the Com
mons has declared today that an eleven dollar rebate will be given to the
Commons boarders. Perhaps the Daily was wrong? Who knows?
Then the flurry over crew. For ten years the return of crew had
been bruited about the campus. Countless editors had written their little
essays on the matter and it ended there. The Daily this year wanted to
get something definite on the matter. Another questionnaire. Does the
student body want crew reinstated? The answer was in the affirmative
by a narrow margin, too narrow to endeavor to reinstate the sport against
the Board of Athletic Control's opposition. But the affair raised a deeper
point.
Crew cannot be reinstated because of manpower. This was the most
potent argument flung by those opposing its return. However an inves
tigation of manpower revealed that all sports have felt the University's
diminishing manpower this year thanks to the elimination of the Lower
Division. The years to come will see an increased lack of manpower.
Stanford's great teams will exist 110 more. Who cares? Evidently the
Administration does not. Despite the revenue, despite the national pres
tige coming from sports, the Administration will undoubtedly continue
its plan and Stanford will lose one of its finest things, intercollegiate
sport.
Then the dear, dear Five Hundred and their little thirty-nine year old
pipe dream of a new gymnasium. My how the little dears fluttered when
crew was suggested. They scratched and stuck stickers and fumed and
now by gollies it looks like that old Shylock miser the B.A.C. is going
to crash through and make the musty pipe dream come true. The Daily
sincerely hopes the women will get what they are after. The University
has passed them by these many years, perhaps the B.A.C. will help them.
The editor has, during this volume, made errors in judgment, he has
made many mistake's, and he is thankful for all of them. From those
errors and those mistakes he has learned more than he could have learned
in a thousand dry tomes. For four years the Daily has signified Stanford
and all Stanford means to him. Whatever he has given the Daily can
only be an infinitesimal part of what the Daily has given him. Perhaps
he will graduate not a scholar, but he would rather graduate having been
editor of the Daily than with any other honor or accomplishment to his
credit. He will not weigh his work. That he leaves to his friends and
particularly his enemies.
Believing that the editorship means so much, his sincere congratula
tion of his successor, Merle F. Emry, has a very deep basis. May his
term be as profitable to him and as worthwhile as the present editor's
has been to him.
To Milton Silverman, the outgoing editor expresses his deepest grati
tude. Few men have worked with more energy, with more ingenuity, or
with more loyalty to the Daily than has Silverman.
No election was harder fought than the last. Emry and Silverman by
their competence and their efforts to win the position made the Daily
from the newspaper point of view the news sheet that it has been.
With as fine men in line for advancement 011 the staff the future of
the Daily augurs well. May the Daily become outstanding among the
newspapers of American universities.
And now, the job is done.
