# The 						Bullsession
## CONGRESSIONAL EFFICIENCY TAKES ANOTHER STEP FORWARD 
### 
The output of legislation from Wash
ington, always copious, promises a fur
ther increase in quantity within the next
year or so—at least if the graphs pre- ,
pared by industrial experts showing the (
effect of temperature on production are ;
accurate. No longer will the lawmakers !
of the nation swelter in the summer heat i
while thinking up added restrictions to !
impose on the populace.
A new device, shortly to be installed in j
the legislative halls, will keep the tem- !
perature down to a maximum of sixty
degrees.
If lowering the temperature fifteen j
degrees enables girls working in eastside
factories to make the remarkable increas
es painting features on celluloid dolls re
ported by the efficiency experts, imagine
what will be the effect of lowering the
temperature thirty degrees in the House
and Senate chambers. The six thousand
laws passed last year may easily mount to
ten, and perhaps, with a little extra effort,
to twelve thousand each year.
The real hardship will come this sum
mer. Orders were placed for two sets of
cooling apparatus, but only one arrived.
By some method which was not made
public, the House secured this, leaving
the Senate to swelter in temperatures re
puted to hover around ninety. That will

mean that while the House passes bills
at the rate of three each hour, the Sen
ate will be able to pass the same bills only
jat the rate of two per hour. This will
; cause an unbalanced condition which it
; may take another extra session to over
! come.
The House is paying dearly, however,
! for being the first to install cooling equip
j ment. Their plans to take a two months'
; recess immediately after passing the tariff
I bill may be cruelly upset by the Senate,
i Certain members there take the attitude
| that since the House now has automatic
j refrigeration, they might as well stay all
summer and enjoy it. Of course, while
the House passes laws in comparative
comfort, the Senate, working in typical
Washington heat, will be able to enjoy
nothing except revenge.
Despite Mie expected increase in output,
there is a brighter side to this congres
sional cooling system. Speaker Long
worth advances a theory that laws passed
in a temperate atmosphere are more hu
mane than those proposed under less
pleasant conditions.
In view of the fact that the Volstead
act was passed after a three weeks' dead
lock in the heat of September, 1919, this
theory seems entirely plausible.

impose on the populace.
A new device, shortly to be installed in j
the legislative halls, will keep the tem- !
perature down to a maximum of sixty
degrees.
If lowering the temperature fifteen j
degrees enables girls working in eastside
factories to make the remarkable increas
es painting features on celluloid dolls re
ported by the efficiency experts, imagine
what will be the effect of lowering the
temperature thirty degrees in the House
and Senate chambers. The six thousand
laws passed last year may easily mount to
ten, and perhaps, with a little extra effort,
to twelve thousand each year.
The real hardship will come this sum
mer. Orders were placed for two sets of
cooling apparatus, but only one arrived.
By some method which was not made
public, the House secured this, leaving
the Senate to swelter in temperatures re
puted to hover around ninety. That will

mean that while the House passes bills
at the rate of three each hour, the Sen
ate will be able to pass the same bills only
jat the rate of two per hour. This will
; cause an unbalanced condition which it
; may take another extra session to over
! come.
The House is paying dearly, however,
! for being the first to install cooling equip
j ment. Their plans to take a two months'
; recess immediately after passing the tariff
I bill may be cruelly upset by the Senate,
i Certain members there take the attitude
| that since the House now has automatic
j refrigeration, they might as well stay all
summer and enjoy it. Of course, while
the House passes laws in comparative
comfort, the Senate, working in typical
Washington heat, will be able to enjoy
nothing except revenge.
Despite Mie expected increase in output,
there is a brighter side to this congres
sional cooling system. Speaker Long
worth advances a theory that laws passed
in a temperate atmosphere are more hu
mane than those proposed under less
pleasant conditions.
In view of the fact that the Volstead
act was passed after a three weeks' dead
lock in the heat of September, 1919, this
theory seems entirely plausible.
