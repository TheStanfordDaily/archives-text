GEARY —Ned McCobb's Daugh
ter. This third play of the New York
Theater Guild's repertory of four is an
other triumph for a group of superb
actors. "Ned McCobb's Daughter" will
run for this week only; next week the
final play will be presented—St. John
Ervine's "John Ferguson."
A one-time citizen of California, Sid
ney Coe Howard, is the author of "Ned
McCobb's Daughter." Howard is one
of the three leading playwrights in the
United States today—the others being
Eugene O'Neill and George Kelly.
In this play, Howard gives an admir
able, real, and full presentation of the
New England character. It compares
favorably with the picture of wine-grow
ing Californians that he gave us in "They
Knew What They Wanted."
Howard has written here a melodra
matic comedy that has certain undeniable
elements of greatness. It is a good play,
well written, finely characterized and
deucedly interesting. Elizabeth Risdon
stands out as a fine actress in the part of
Carrie McCobb battling for duty against
a sneaking, nasty dog of a husband and
his tricky brother.
She meets defeat staunchly, when this
beer baron has her in his power; but
when he demands that her children shall
put the veneer of respectability on his
disreputable business, with her house as
his center of operations, she rebels and
defeats him with his own tricks.
A coffin in the room where illicit love
making, shrewd bargaining, and conflict
of wits are carried on adds a grisly
touch to the setting. Old Captain Mc-
Cobb died just as he was about to reveal
the crookedness of her husband to Carrie,
and the action of the rest of the play
takes place 011 the night of that day and
the following morning.
Brandon Evans, who was so enjoyable
as the old Sir "Paddy" in "The Doctor's
Dilemma," plays the part of the old man
in this play with a vigor and a vital
power that is tremendously satisfying.
Lawrence Leslie as the plotting bootleg
ger is a perfect characterization. Neal
Caldwell we see again, this time in the
role of the contemptible husband of Car
rie. Peg Entwhistle gives a pretty and
accomplished performance as Jenny, who
has fallen victim to George's charm—the
same charm that caused Carrie to marry
him.

his tricky brother.
She meets defeat staunchly, when this
beer baron has her in his power; but
when he demands that her children shall
put the veneer of respectability on his
disreputable business, with her house as
his center of operations, she rebels and
defeats him with his own tricks.
A coffin in the room where illicit love
making, shrewd bargaining, and conflict
of wits are carried on adds a grisly
touch to the setting. Old Captain Mc-
Cobb died just as he was about to reveal
the crookedness of her husband to Carrie,
and the action of the rest of the play
takes place 011 the night of that day and
the following morning.
Brandon Evans, who was so enjoyable
as the old Sir "Paddy" in "The Doctor's
Dilemma," plays the part of the old man
in this play with a vigor and a vital
power that is tremendously satisfying.
Lawrence Leslie as the plotting bootleg
ger is a perfect characterization. Neal
Caldwell we see again, this time in the
role of the contemptible husband of Car
rie. Peg Entwhistle gives a pretty and
accomplished performance as Jenny, who
has fallen victim to George's charm—the
same charm that caused Carrie to marry
him.

GEARY —Ned McCobb's Daugh
ter. This third play of the New York
Theater Guild's repertory of four is an
other triumph for a group of superb
actors. "Ned McCobb's Daughter" will
run for this week only; next week the
final play will be presented—St. John
Ervine's "John Ferguson."
A one-time citizen of California, Sid
ney Coe Howard, is the author of "Ned
McCobb's Daughter." Howard is one
of the three leading playwrights in the
United States today—the others being
Eugene O'Neill and George Kelly.
In this play, Howard gives an admir
able, real, and full presentation of the
New England character. It compares
favorably with the picture of wine-grow
ing Californians that he gave us in "They
Knew What They Wanted."
Howard has written here a melodra
matic comedy that has certain undeniable
elements of greatness. It is a good play,
well written, finely characterized and
deucedly interesting. Elizabeth Risdon
stands out as a fine actress in the part of
Carrie McCobb battling for duty against
a sneaking, nasty dog of a husband and
his tricky brother.
