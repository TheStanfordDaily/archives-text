# STEALING THROUGH LIFE.

Ernest Booth. (New York. 1929.
Alfred A. Knopf, publisher.)
"You're young as hell to be out steal
ing, kid"—these words, spoken by a
coarse, blustering chief of police to a boy
thief not yet eleven years old, heralded
the entrance of Ernest Booth to a life of
almost uninterrupted crime, that was des
tined in the end to send him up for life
at San Quentin.
Ernest Booth was born in New York
in 1899, and at an early age began a series
of robberies and forgeries that resulted
in a five-year sentence at San Quentin for
him. He escaped from this place, was
shortly recaptured, served his sentence,
and then began again, only this time his
succession of bank robberies, burglaries,
grand larcenies, and forgeries was far
more serious. His last sentence was life,
and now he, with five other inmates at
San Quentin, is occupied with developing
freely his somewhat belated literary am
bitions.
His last book, "Stealing Through Life,"
is a much adorned autobiography, based
on the events of his unusual career,
dwelling 011 the childhood wanderlust that
led to his first misdemeanors, and tracing
his life through all its astonishing list of
crimes. The book furnishes a unique
document in certain rcspects, as no such
recital lias previously been made by a

habitual criminal sufficiently articulate to
record his exploits.
Certainly "Stealing Through Life" is
nothing if not articulate. The smooth,
polished, elaborate style with which the
most barefaced robberies are described
has a strange incongruity. It is unde
niable, however, that the genuine literary
ability of this so-called "habitual crimi
nal" makes the book very fascinating, and
unless the reader consciously refuses to
let the glamor of it carry him away, he
is apt to pronounce the account "worth
while, compelling, and authentic." The
author intends this to happen—he is mak
ing a very clever bid for the public to
find in his book a stinging indictment of
the handling of the entire prison, culprit,
and officer problem in the United States.
And he succeeds in making some of
his points good. You will find his prefa
tory remarks are disarming. He rather
unobtrusively expresses the hope that he
has worked out the fundamental causes
for his being brought to prison, at the
same time denying any intent to justify
himself. He also suggests with the same
disarming unobtrusiveness that the crime
wave that this country is so alarmed over
can be calmed by the intelligent applica
tion of simple and obvious changes. His
book will, of course, make these changes
clear. But does he do this? Not too well,
I think.
Picture a chunky, somber faced little
boy, reading Dickens at the age of nine
—as well as Horatio Alger, Jr., and fill
ing his precocious little soul with "rest
lessness and a growing dissatisfaction"
(whether as a result of Dickens or Alger,
Jr., is not made quite clear). At any
rate his first arrest is definitely put down
as due to a Horatio Alger, Jr., complex.
Ernest and his pal went to see the world,
led astray by "Do and Dare" and "Risen
from the Ranks." Is it reform of juve
nile literature that Mr. Booth is crying
for?
Then Mr. Booth is always being dis
illusioned. First it is Sunday schools,
then city mayors, and then professors. It
is more than he can bear, and so he
revolts against society. Reform religion,
politics, and education—a big program,
Mr. Booth !
But even if Mr. Booth's book will not
stand a cool, impartial scrutiny, it has
far too many merits to be wholly scorned.
He writes beautifully, and never fails to
make his words count. There is no drag
ging in spite of the frequent stretches
of something very close to moralizing,
and the incidents flash by. If you are
content to take this simply as a good
story, you won't be disappointed, for, in
spite of the author's protests to the
contrary, glamor smears every page.
