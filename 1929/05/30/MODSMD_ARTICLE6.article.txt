The annual Spring Field Day of
women's sports to be held Saturday
morning will start at 9:30 o'clock with
the final contests of the season In
track and archery. Tennis will start
at 10:30 o'clock, and a barbecue froe
to all campus women at 12 will mark
the end of the morning sports. An in
terclass swimming meet to begin at
1:30 o'clock will be the last event
of the day.
Freshman and senior women are ex
pected to fight out the battle for the
class victors of the day between them.
The frosh have the lead in the swim
ming meets, having all wins and no
losses on their record for the past
season. The seniors have the edge in
the track events, and also in the ten
nis finals. Thelma Patton is leading
In the round robin which has
been carried on during the past two
weeks between the holders of the
class tennis titles. However, the sen
iors have lost all their swimming
meets, and this fact may prove a

drawback in the final count.
A tentative list of women taking
part in the swimming meet has been
released by Phyllis Linscott, W.A.A.
swimming manager. They are as fol
lows: Frosh, Captain Beatrice Clyne,
Margery Thomas, Barbara Beach
Thompson, Jaquelline Bugge, Peggy
Gage, and Mary Cummins; Sophs,
Captain Margaret Willis, Constance
Morse, Elizabeth harsh, Sue Betty
Dunlap, and Mary Edith Jones; Jun
iors, Captain Miriam Miller, Frances
Yeazell, Maxine Cushing, and Jessie
Fleming; Seniors, Captain Sally Mil
ler, Katherine Doyle, Editha Wright,
Mate McLaren, Juanita White, Eliza
beth VanLoben Sels, and Phyllis Lin
scott.
The last two matches of the tennis
round robin will bo played on the
! Field Day, Thelma Patton vs. Marian
Leachman and Belts Hawkins vs. Sue
Petty Dunlap. Patton has won two of
her three matches, and Dunlap comes
second with one victory and one de
feat. Both Hawkins and Leachman
have lost one match and will play
one more match this week before
Saturday.
The seniors are doped to win the
track end of field day, although prob
ably not by a large score. The sched
ule of competitors and events had not
yet been made, but Thelma Patton,
Marion Holley, Katherine Doyle, and
Dorothy Sweet will be the stars of the
track events. Marion Holley has been
practicing the high jump steadily all
quarter and hopes to set a new record
in it. Lydia Bowen will probably break
her own last year's record in the shot
put.
In archery, those who will probably
make among the best scores are Har
riet Burroughs, Lucy Ritter, Jean Mar
quis, Lillian Schuck, Margaret Kem
penich, Beatrice Elkins, and Elizabeth
Erlin. An individual cup will be pre
sented to the one winning the highest
score in archery, providing the score
is high enough.
Managers of the four sports for next
year to serve on W.A.A. Board will be
elected immediately after the compe
tition of each sport. Presentation of
awards, class, and individual cups and
Block "S" sweaters, will be made at
the barbecue at noon.
