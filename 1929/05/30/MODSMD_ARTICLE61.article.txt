Candidates for degrees will, as
usual, wear academic dress. Candi

to carry their hoods on their arms,
so that the president may confer the
hoods with the degrees. Arrangements
for academic costume may be made
through the Stanford Bookstore, and
orders should be left there by June 7.
The Class of 1929 has arranged to
place on sale at the Stanford Book
store class souvenir programs of Com
mencement Week, and engraved an
nouncements of the Commencement
Exercises. The announcement is in
the name of the University, and is so
worded as to be appropriate for use
by candidates for advanced degrees,
as well as by the senior class. The
souvenir programs are $1 each and
the announcements are two for
twenty-five cents.
The Class of 1929 scroll will be
placed in the office of the Alumni

June 2, and all seniors are urged to
sign it. Payment of class dues is a
prerequisite to signing.
The Senior Ball will be the crown
ing social activity of the senior class
and will be held in Toyon Hall start
ing on Friday evening, June 14, and
lasting till daybreak on Saturday
morning, June 15. The decorations for
the ball are being designed by Harold
Helvenston and should prove very
novel as this is the only dance held
on the campus that Helvenston has
decorated.
The favors for the dance will be
book-shaped compacts with a Stanford
seal on them and the programs will
be in the form of an academic cap.
Breakfast will be served at sunrise
for the revellers in the Encina Com
mons. A few bids for the ball still
remain on sale in the Old Union.
