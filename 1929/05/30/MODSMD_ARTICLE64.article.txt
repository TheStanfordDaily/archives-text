## 
### 
COLTON, Calif., May 29. (/P)A path
etic scene, children and teachers
weeping, occurred today when the
Colton Union High School was sud
denly closed due to lack of funds.
Fifty-five seniors were deprived of the
honor of graduation and some three
hundred other students found their
education brought to an abrupt halt.
Closing of the high school followed
a special election here yesterday in
which a $25,000 bond issue failed to
pass. The bond issue provided for
clearance of a $17,000 deficit in con
struction costs six years ago and
$8,000 for alterations. Only a light
vote had been cast. Closing of the
school for an indefinite period fol
lowed.
