writing contest. Barbara Dewlaney
has been woman's editor of the Stan

is the prize-winning article:
By Barbara Dewlaney
" 'He would have made a good chef.'
"Thus spoke the wife of Coach Pop
Warner, beloved football mentor of
the Stanford Cardinals.
"The grim, scheming, cigarette
puffing Pop is rather a domestic man
who is as much at ease in a big apron
before the kitchen range as he is on
the gridiron directing his men in
scrimmage. All the grime, dirt, and
sweat of the football field have never
alienated Pop's affection for the world
of pots and pans.
" 'Not only is he adept in the sim
plest of culinary arts, but he is fond
of originating new dishes,' Mrs. War
ner told the interviewer. It is not
probable that the average man would
starve so long as there are cans to
open, but the less substantial eatables
requiring skill in preparation are
usually left severely alone by the non
professional male cook. Pop, on the
contrary, finds delight in concocting
salads and other dainties.
" 'He often says if he were a woman
he'd spend his time originating and
making new combinations of delect
ables,' Mrs. Warner explained. The
next time an elite hotel needs pub
licity it might approach Warner with
a neat sum and solicit his contribution
of a recipe for green pea ice-cream or
strawberry soup."
