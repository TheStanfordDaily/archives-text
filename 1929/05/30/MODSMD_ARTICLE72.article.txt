# THAT GOLDEN SHELL AGAIN!
## 
### 
It may seem a long while yet before
the Poughkeepsie regatta, but with so
many events popping every week now in
sports it will seem like no time at all be
fore we are all assembled up there 011 that
beautiful Hudson, yelling our heads off
at one of the prettiest sporting events of
them all, the university eight-oared-crew
race, to be held this year on June 25.
To those who have never seen a big
race between two or more shells, and to
whom rowing is a funny sport because
"God never intended man to get his ex
ercise sitting down and going backward,"

I would recommend a seat in the observa
tion train at the Poughkeepsie regatta on
a beautiful summer's clay. Then, if they
don't return rowing converts, their cases
must be hopeless.
California, champions in 1928, will re
turn next month with seven of the eight
who rowed last year back in the shell
again. Only one oarsman of that mar
velous crew which beat the record for the
course last year in a driving rain is miss
ing this year, but the peppy little cox
swain, Don Blessing, has also graduated,
and it was, perhaps, more difficult to re

(place him than it was to find a substitute
| for "Curley" Stalder at bow.
The flaming tongue of Don Blessing
had as much to do with the ten successive
; victories of "The Golden Gate" as its
j eight stalwart oarsmen did. Now a young
man named "Moon" Mullin is coxing the
Blue and Gold shell, and, if the six-length
j victory over Washington last month may
i he taken as an example of Mr. Mullin's
I ability, why Don Blessing has an effective
j substitute. However, a "cursory" glance
j when they come East will suffice.
Now just a word about "Ky" Ebright,

the "Little Napoleon" among rowing
coaches. "Ky" is one of the enigmas of
the coaching game because he absolutely
refuses to play to the crowd, and glory,
seemingly, means nothing to him at all.
One evening in April he thought his var
sity was getting a little overconfident. He
gave them a proper dressing-down and
then told them to row down the Oakland
Estuary, across San Francisco Bay, and
out the Golden Gate until they got all the
"swell-headedness" out of their systems.
I It was a properly chastened crew that
j came hack to the boathouse.
