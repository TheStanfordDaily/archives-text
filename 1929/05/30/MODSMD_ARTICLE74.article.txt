ST. LOUIS, May 29. (Jp) â€”Personal
safety in flight has become the prin- !
cipal problem in aviation, in the opin- i
ion of Lieut. James Doolittle, noted 1
pilot with the Guggenheim Founda- J
tic.n, New York City, which was given j
to the third national aeronautic meet-1
ing here today. He added "much has I
been done but there remains much
yet to be done."
More and better airports, airways
studded with emergency landing fields, i
power plant reliability, and low land
ing speeds were among the essentials j
listed by Doolittle for lessening per-j
sonal peril. He would also have the
manufacturer construct the craft so
that it "crashes well."
