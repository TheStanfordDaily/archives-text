# UNBALANCE OF ELECTRICITY IS HELD TO BE ONE CAUSE OF ALL DISEASES
## 
### 
ATLANTA, Ga., May 29 (/P). —A the
ory that there is fundamentally only one
disease, due to loss of electrical balance
in the body, has been presented to the
Interstate Post Graduate Medical Asso
ciation of North America here.
The author is Dr. J. E. R. McDonagh,
surgeon of the London Lock hospitals.
His ideas bring together some of the re
cent findings of the many ways in which
slight electrical effects manifest them
selves in the body.
He holds that resistance to disease is
the one vital factor in health, and that
if the resistance is high enough, no kind
of infection can get started.
This resistance, he says, depends on the
state of the protein particles. The pro
teins are called the life-carriers of the
body. They are complcx substances,
forming an important part of body cells.
"If an invader," says Dr. McDonagh,
"either of a bacterial or a chemical na
ture, is able to subject the protein par
ticles to a dehydration, disease is caused —
the term infection being used when the
invader is a micro-organism. When the
protein particles are subjected to dehy-

I dration, they part with certain absorbed
constituents.
I "One of the first of these to be freed
;is electricity: a change of energy oc
j curs, heat instead of electrical energy
being liberated, thus explaining why,
when micro-organisms gain a footing in
! the body, the victim exhibits a rise in
| temperature.
"The fight between the invaded and
the invader boils down to being one for
the retention of electricity. If the para
sites lose their electricity, their bodies
break up and go into true solution as do
the protein particles of the body when
the invader gets the upper hand.
i "Since the battle is of such a simple
nature, it becomes quite clear that the
sole aim of treatment is to restore to the
body's protein particles, the electrons they
have lost."
