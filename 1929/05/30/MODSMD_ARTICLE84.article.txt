# VARSITY WILL RECEIVE TEST TOMORROW AS SPRING PRACTICE CLOSES WITH GAME
## 
### Howard Moore 
Spring football practice will officially I
close tomorrow afternoon when two
picked teams from the varsity squad
clash in a regular refereed game. This
will be Warner's last appearance on the
field until September 16, when he will
lead forth his proteges for one week of
intensive practice before the opening
game with the West Coast Army on
Saturday, September 21.
Looking back on the spring tpiarter
practice, the Old Fox is, as usual, far
from optimistic. The first team, espe
cially in the backfield, has been hard hit
by graduation. Twelve of last year's let
termen, including six regulars, will be
missing.
The two guard positions, left vacant by
the great Post-Robesky duo, will be one
of the hardest gaps to fill. Pete Heiser,
captain of the frosh team two years ago,
is a likelihood at one of the posts, and
the other one will probably be taken over
by Driscoll. There are also Dawson,
Hamilton, Bardin, Forster, and Wilson,
who are expected to put in a strong bid.
Artman will return for another year at
tackle, but his running mate, Sellman,
will be sorely missed from the other side
of the line. At present, it looks like a
toss-up between Tandy and Klabau to |
fill Sellman's shoes, although there are j
Thompson, Ehrhorn, Bogue, from last I
year's reserves, and Grey and Doub from j
the frosh team that look good for the :
position.
Captain "Mush" Muller and Johnny
Preston will take care of the flanks and
there will be a wealth of substitutes in
Worden, K. Albertson, Bush, Neil, Col
vin, and "Red" Hand, a transfer from
Sacramento Junior College.
"Pop" may receive another setback in
the center of the line. Little Walt Hei- j
necke will get out of the hospital next
week, but his kidney trouble may keep
his out of the lineup next fall. Three men
are staging a neck and neck battle for
the job in case Heinecke will be unable

to play—Perry Taylor, who was out with
a dislocated shoulder last season, Cy
Mann, and M. Albertson.
Fleishhacker and Smalling will resume
their old duel lor quarterback with Harry
Hillman pushing them both.
The loss of Spud Lewis, the capable
field general of last year, steady Bob
Sims, and flashy Frank Wilton, has seri
ously depleted the list of experienced
halfbacks. Lud-Frentrup is a cinch for
one halfback job, but there is a host of
possibilities for the other. Marks, Mof
fatt, and Clark of last year's varsity and
Rintala of the frosh are all contenders
for the post. Harlow Rothert has been
transferred from full and will undoubt
edly see action at half.
Simkins has a sure hold on Biff Hoff
man's old position at full and Muirhead
and Caddell appear to be capable under
studies.
Down on the sun-baked plains near Los
Angeles, Papa Jones has been grooming
a trio of backfield men to defend the
Trojan stronghold. Moses, Saunders, and
Duffield are his three ball toters and he
also has fleet-footed McCaslin on one of
the flanks, and Captain Nathan Barrager
who is considered a possibility for Ail-
American center.
Over in Berkeley, his Nibs has an iden
| tical combination in readiness for the j
1929 season. Lorn, Barr, and Eisan are
his backfield stars —all of them two-year
lettermen. He also has handsome Mr.
Avery, former Olympic Club end, who
scored one of the California touchdowns
in the Big Game last fall. And there is
Captain Roy Reigels in the center of the
line who is determined to run in the right
direction this year.
Knee-deep in the slush of the frozen
north, Washington has an excellent op
| portunity to lose, not only to her ancient
j rival, Washington State, but also to al
most every other team in the western
conference. With the graduation of one
Charles "Chuck" Carroll, about half of
the Purple and Gold team went to smash.
