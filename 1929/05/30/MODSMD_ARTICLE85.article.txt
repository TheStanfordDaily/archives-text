## 
### 
Mrs. Joseph Walter Bingham, wife of I

j ment, will conduct a course during the j
' summer quarter on the educational as
pects of the Parent-Teacher movement. !
The subject will be taught Monday, Tues-1
day, Thursday, and Friday at 10; two
| units will be given the first term.
The course includes a study of the j
fundamental principles and aims of the '
Parent-Teacher organization ; a summary i
of the concrete examples of the fine serv- !
ice it is rendering in progressive educa- j
tional centers; a discussion of legitimate !
fields of activity and working out of cer- j
tain projects in detail; a survey of co- j
operating agencies and the assistance that j
may be expected from these sources; and !
actual demonstration of how an associa- j
tion should be organized, a meeting con- |
ducted and a program planned.

operation of a Parent-Teacher Associa- I
tion. the course will be of value to teach-1

which they are located. There is consid- j
erable literature of practical value avail- j
able, much of which is free.
