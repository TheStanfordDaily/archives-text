# Opportunity Knocks Now For "Chappie" Tryoutees
## 
### 
Now is the time for every good man
to get into some activity. And the
Old Boy opines that there is no better
activity on the campus than working
on the Chaparral.
Tryouts are now beginning for three
excellent positions: business manager,
circulation manager, and women's
manager. The tryout period for the
first position lasts two years, and that
for the latter two positions, one year.
AIJ who are interested in working
on the magazine are urged to attend
a meeting in the Chaparral office, up
stairs in the Press Building, Thursday
afternoon at 2 o'clock. There will be
practically no work to do this quar
ter, but it will be advantageous for
the tryoutees to get in touch with the
magazine as soon as possible.
