j For the eighth time in nine years a
j western university is scheduled to steal
the 1.C.4-A. track and field meet. Back
| at Philadelphia the aspiring and perspir
ing athletes of more than a score of col
leges will attempt to stop a group of
j fourteen Stanford men from copping
their third straight championship.
Pennsylvania is generally con
| ceded the best chance of halting
the Cards, with Barney Berlinger,
her all-round star, expected to do
; the major portion of the point
gathering. Berlinger's success in
four events will largely decide the
fate of the Quaker institution.
In New York Coach Dink Tem
pleton informed reporters that
Stanford had a strong team be
| cause of the presence of Rothert
I and Krenz. "If they should go
I wrong it would be no trouble for
us to blow the meet, he declared.
Easterners in the"know" expect
little "blowing" however. They
look for the Cards to win by from
ten to twenty points although the
final result may be much closer
than last year when Yale finished a
poor second 17 2-3 points behind.
On the Atlantic seaboard the West is
credited with developing the best sprint,
weight, hurdle, and pole vault men, which
j leaves the East excelling in the javelin,
the jumps, the distance, and the middle
distance races. Although there is no way
to account for the particular weakness
in the javelin and the jumps, there is
undoubtedly some reason for the appar
ent weakness in track events.
In 1926 Stanford sent Bill Richardson,
then captain, and a great half-miler back
to compete in the Intercollegiates. With
him was his teammate Ted Miller, just
as great a quarter-miler as Richardson
was an 880 man. Both were doped to
be among the leaders in their respective
events. But whether it was the weather,
the long ride, or the track conditions, it
proved a disastrous meet as far as they
were concerned. Richardson finished a
poor fifth while Miller failed to show.
Previous to their trip east Richardson
had run consistently between 1:53 and
1 :55 in his favorite event, while Miller
could usually be depended on for a 48 s.
or better in the 440. Eastern tracks seem
to be a jinx for western distance men,
and that is the reason why points are
seldom spotted in these events when dop
ing the results of the 1.C.4-A. or the
N.C.A.A.
The same is more or less true in the
other track events, too. That is why the
experts usually say, we can depend on
at least so many points in the field events,
and if we're lucky maybe we will grab
this many on the track.
Whether the growing scarcity of ma
terial due to the cut in lower division
students is already becoming evident, or
whether Pop Warner is intent upon in
troducing a new vogue, has not yet been
determined, but the fact remains that the
remnants of a 1928 Stanford varsity and
those aspiring for a job on next year's
aggregation will put on a tussle for the
Card fans Friday afternoon.
It will greatly resemble a regular, sure
enough game, with the opposing players
seated at each side of the field, a referee,
and all the essentials except a mob to
push through in finding one's destination.
The latest news, hot off the grid
iron, is to the effect that the "Old

Fox" will use his A formation al
most exclusively in 1929. Although
the B formation for which the
Card eleven fumbled and fumed
throughout the last season will
probably not be dropped altogeth
er, there is little likelihood of its
being used except as a threat,
which means of course that oppos
ing elevens will always have to be
on the alert for this attack.
Evidently Pop believes that B
lacks the punch of the old A for
mation. And, it may be added, it
is a much more difficult formation
to master. It is more complicated,
and although it may be more likely
to fool the opponents, it is just as
likely to lose ground because of
poor execution.
"Athletics and studies do not mix," is
the cry of those favoring a flat-chested
institution. Although it has been defi
nitely proved at a number of universities
that this does not hold true, it is ex
tremely exceptional when an ail-Ameri
can football star turns Phi Beta Kappa,
especially when majoring in the Depart
ment of Engineering. Such is the case
of Seraphim "Dynamite" Post, one of
Pop Warner's sturdy guards, who com
pletes his college career, speaking both in
tellectually and athletically, in a blaze of
glory this quarter.
There are perhaps few fans who could
tell you about his engineering abilities,
which seem to speak for themselves, but
there are undoubtedly thousands of them
around the country who could tell you
what a "sweet" football player he is.

was an 880 man. Both were doped to
be among the leaders in their respective
events. But whether it was the weather,
the long ride, or the track conditions, it
proved a disastrous meet as far as they
were concerned. Richardson finished a
poor fifth while Miller failed to show.
Previous to their trip east Richardson
had run consistently between 1:53 and
1 :55 in his favorite event, while Miller
could usually be depended on for a 48 s.
or better in the 440. Eastern tracks seem
to be a jinx for western distance men,
and that is the reason why points are
seldom spotted in these events when dop
ing the results of the 1.C.4-A. or the
N.C.A.A.
The same is more or less true in the
other track events, too. That is why the
experts usually say, we can depend on
at least so many points in the field events,
and if we're lucky maybe we will grab
this many on the track.
Whether the growing scarcity of ma
terial due to the cut in lower division
students is already becoming evident, or
whether Pop Warner is intent upon in
troducing a new vogue, has not yet been
determined, but the fact remains that the
remnants of a 1928 Stanford varsity and
those aspiring for a job on next year's
aggregation will put on a tussle for the
Card fans Friday afternoon.
It will greatly resemble a regular, sure
enough game, with the opposing players
seated at each side of the field, a referee,
and all the essentials except a mob to
push through in finding one's destination.
The latest news, hot off the grid
iron, is to the effect that the "Old

Fox" will use his A formation al
most exclusively in 1929. Although
the B formation for which the
Card eleven fumbled and fumed
throughout the last season will
probably not be dropped altogeth
er, there is little likelihood of its
being used except as a threat,
which means of course that oppos
ing elevens will always have to be
on the alert for this attack.
Evidently Pop believes that B
lacks the punch of the old A for
mation. And, it may be added, it
is a much more difficult formation
to master. It is more complicated,
and although it may be more likely
to fool the opponents, it is just as
likely to lose ground because of
poor execution.
"Athletics and studies do not mix," is
the cry of those favoring a flat-chested
institution. Although it has been defi
nitely proved at a number of universities
that this does not hold true, it is ex
tremely exceptional when an ail-Ameri
can football star turns Phi Beta Kappa,
especially when majoring in the Depart
ment of Engineering. Such is the case
of Seraphim "Dynamite" Post, one of
Pop Warner's sturdy guards, who com
pletes his college career, speaking both in
tellectually and athletically, in a blaze of
glory this quarter.
There are perhaps few fans who could
tell you about his engineering abilities,
which seem to speak for themselves, but
there are undoubtedly thousands of them
around the country who could tell you
what a "sweet" football player he is.

the B formation for which the
Card eleven fumbled and fumed
throughout the last season will

poor execution.

j For the eighth time in nine years a
j western university is scheduled to steal
the 1.C.4-A. track and field meet. Back
| at Philadelphia the aspiring and perspir
ing athletes of more than a score of col
leges will attempt to stop a group of
j fourteen Stanford men from copping
their third straight championship.
Pennsylvania is generally con
| ceded the best chance of halting
the Cards, with Barney Berlinger,
her all-round star, expected to do
; the major portion of the point
gathering. Berlinger's success in
four events will largely decide the
fate of the Quaker institution.
In New York Coach Dink Tem
pleton informed reporters that
Stanford had a strong team be
| cause of the presence of Rothert
I and Krenz. "If they should go
I wrong it would be no trouble for
us to blow the meet, he declared.
Easterners in the"know" expect
little "blowing" however. They
look for the Cards to win by from
ten to twenty points although the
final result may be much closer
than last year when Yale finished a
poor second 17 2-3 points behind.
On the Atlantic seaboard the West is
credited with developing the best sprint,
weight, hurdle, and pole vault men, which
j leaves the East excelling in the javelin,
the jumps, the distance, and the middle
distance races. Although there is no way
to account for the particular weakness
in the javelin and the jumps, there is
undoubtedly some reason for the appar
ent weakness in track events.
In 1926 Stanford sent Bill Richardson,
then captain, and a great half-miler back
to compete in the Intercollegiates. With
him was his teammate Ted Miller, just
as great a quarter-miler as Richardson
was an 880 man. Both were doped to
be among the leaders in their respective
events. But whether it was the weather,
the long ride, or the track conditions, it
proved a disastrous meet as far as they
were concerned. Richardson finished a
poor fifth while Miller failed to show.
Previous to their trip east Richardson
had run consistently between 1:53 and
1 :55 in his favorite event, while Miller
could usually be depended on for a 48 s.
or better in the 440. Eastern tracks seem
to be a jinx for western distance men,
and that is the reason why points are
seldom spotted in these events when dop
ing the results of the 1.C.4-A. or the
N.C.A.A.
The same is more or less true in the
other track events, too. That is why the
experts usually say, we can depend on
at least so many points in the field events,
and if we're lucky maybe we will grab
this many on the track.
Whether the growing scarcity of ma
terial due to the cut in lower division
students is already becoming evident, or
whether Pop Warner is intent upon in
troducing a new vogue, has not yet been
determined, but the fact remains that the
remnants of a 1928 Stanford varsity and
those aspiring for a job on next year's
aggregation will put on a tussle for the
Card fans Friday afternoon.
It will greatly resemble a regular, sure
enough game, with the opposing players
seated at each side of the field, a referee,
and all the essentials except a mob to
push through in finding one's destination.
The latest news, hot off the grid
iron, is to the effect that the "Old

Fox" will use his A formation al
most exclusively in 1929. Although
the B formation for which the
