# HELEN WILLS DEFEATS "BILLIE" TAPSCOTT IN THIRD-ROUND MATCH
## 
### 
PARIS, May 29 (/P). â€” Miss Helen
Wills, defending her women's singles
title in the French tennis championships,
reached the fourth round today by de
feating Miss Ruth ("Billie") Tapscott
of South Africa, 6-1, 6-3.
There was a light drizzle but it did
not seem to bother Helen, who promptly
ran into a four to one lead.
The second ranking South African
player was unable to provide any sort of
opposition to the American champion.
Helen's stroking was much too fierce for
Miss Tapscott, who, after winning her
first service and making the games one
all, lost five straight games none of which
went to deuce.
