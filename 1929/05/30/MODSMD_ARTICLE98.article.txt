leben, German tennis star, eliminated
Mrs. May Sutton Bundy, California

ships today. The scores were 7-5, 6-1.
Mrs. Bundy's defeat left Mias Helen
Wills, the defending champion, the

Mrs. Bundy's indomitable fighting
; spirit appeared to be all that was left
of the American champion of 25 years

Friedleben. Trailing in the first set by
one game to four, Mrs. Bundy staged
one of her old-time May Sutton ral
lies and with a run of four straight
games forged into the lead, 5-4. But
the effort told, the German ranking
number 2 then carrying three games
I in a row for the set.
