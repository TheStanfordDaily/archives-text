Shoes for...
THE
I MAN
In the business world men are often judged
by their appearances.
If you are to be rated "high" then you must
select Shoes which go best with the Clothes
you wear and the things you do.
Follow your own personal whims as to pat
terns and prices but —see to it that the Shoes
You Wear are appropriate to the rest of
your apparel.
It's easy to do. If you don't know, ask us.
