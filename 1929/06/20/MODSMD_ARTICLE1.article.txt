First Western Meeting
This is the first western meeting
of the Harvard Economic Society,
which is successor to the Harvard
University Committee on Economic
Research organized about twelve
years ago to carry on various lines of
economic research. Investigations into
certain fundamental problems con
nected with the business cycle were
carried on by the committee. These
investigations led to the development
of the Harvard Index of General Busi
ness Conditions and the related sys
tem of forecasting cyclical fluctua
tions.
After extensive fundamental inves
tigations the committee began publi
cation of the Review of Economic
Statistics in January, 1919, and two
years later the publication activities
were extended by the inauguration of
a weekly forecasting letter service.
These two publications were taken
over by the Harvard Economic Society
upon its incorporation in 1927.
