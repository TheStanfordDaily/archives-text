# PLAN TO START WORK SOON ON GYMNASIUM BUILDING FOR WOMEN
## To Construct New $225,000 Structure Around Open Court Near Roble 
### 
Work will start this summer on a
new gymnasium for Stanford women
as soon as detailed plans are complete
and the contracts are let. The new
building became assured last Thurs
day when the board of trustees ap
proved of the arrangement by which
the Board of Athletic Control will
make $225,000 available for the con
struction of the gymnasium.

General plans for the building are
already determined. The gymnasium
will be located nearer Roble Hall than
is the present structure and will be
built around an open court which will
serve as a social center for activities
connected with the gymnasium. Pro
vision has also been made for two
swimming pools, one for class work
particularly and the other for recrea
tional purposes.
The asurance of a new and ade
quate gymnasium building for women
follows an agitation of several years.
President Wilbur about a decade ago
placed such a building as among the
most pressingly needed requirements,
and in 1922 his annual report noted it
as at the head of the list. The Uni
versity had no funds that could be
made available and hoped that the
building might come as a gift. The
women themselves made an appeal to
tho Board of Athletic Control and dur
ing this last year carried on an active
campaign to this end.
