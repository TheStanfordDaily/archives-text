dent's House.

"Mrs. Wilbur and I are glad of this
chance to meet the Stanford people
before we have to leave again," said
President Wilbur. "In Washington
our thoughts are constantly turning
back here. We are reminded of Stan
ford every day. There has not been
a day since we have been in Wash
ington when somebody has not seen
me about something that touched
Stanford —whether it has been a for
mer student who brought up some
matter of University interest or some
body seeking information about a
Stanford man or woman for a posi
tion, or somebody interested in the
work Stanford is doing in education.
"Repeatedly it is impressed on me
that our University is known and
watched with interest on the Atlantic
coast as well as on the Pacific.
Stanford Free to Grow
"When the Stanfords planned the
University and placed it here they
could not visualize the tremendous
growth in education that would take
place along with the growth in popu
lation in California and the West, but
they gave the University a charter
that left it free to grow. It was very
fortunate that Stanford was given an
independent position and in those

early years a sufficient endowment so
that it could enter on those fields of
education it seemed most likely to
handle well and to adapt itself to the
varying levels which could correspond
to the elevations reached during the
succeeding years in education, parti
cularly in California. More students
go farther in education in California
lhan in other parts of the country,
and Stanford is unhampered by char
ter restrictions in meeting the needs
of these students. On the contrary, it
is enjoined by the expressed inten
tions of its founders to strive to meet
changing educational needs.

"Stanford retains its early vitality
of youth and the character of youth
in looking forward and growing. All
Stanford people, whether on the cam
pus or far away from the campus,
can take just pride in their Univer
sity and feel this fellowship of pride
and of loyalty to the fundamental
Stanford tradition."

and Stanford is unhampered by char
ter restrictions in meeting the needs
of these students. On the contrary, it
is enjoined by the expressed inten
tions of its founders to strive to meet
changing educational needs.

"Stanford retains its early vitality
of youth and the character of youth
in looking forward and growing. All
Stanford people, whether on the cam
pus or far away from the campus,
can take just pride in their Univer
sity and feel this fellowship of pride
and of loyalty to the fundamental
Stanford tradition."
President and Mrs. Wilbur will be
at home very informally to all summer
quarter students and faculty members
at 8 o'clock this evening at the Presi
dent's House.

This will give students and faculty
an opportunity to greet Dr. Wilbur
and Mrs. Wilbur personally during
their brief stay on the campus. Dr.
Wilbur leaves tomorrow on a tour of
inspection of various projects of the
Department of-the Interior before his
return to his office in Washington,
which he expects ta reach about the
middle of July.

East Knows Stanford
"Mrs. Wilbur and I are glad of this
chance to meet the Stanford people
before we have to leave again," said
President Wilbur. "In Washington
our thoughts are constantly turning
back here. We are reminded of Stan
ford every day. There has not been
a day since we have been in Wash
ington when somebody has not seen
me about something that touched
Stanford —whether it has been a for
mer student who brought up some
matter of University interest or some
body seeking information about a
Stanford man or woman for a posi
tion, or somebody interested in the
work Stanford is doing in education.
"Repeatedly it is impressed on me
that our University is known and
watched with interest on the Atlantic
coast as well as on the Pacific.
Stanford Free to Grow
"When the Stanfords planned the
University and placed it here they
could not visualize the tremendous
growth in education that would take
place along with the growth in popu
lation in California and the West, but
they gave the University a charter
that left it free to grow. It was very
fortunate that Stanford was given an
independent position and in those

early years a sufficient endowment so
that it could enter on those fields of
education it seemed most likely to
handle well and to adapt itself to the
varying levels which could correspond
to the elevations reached during the
succeeding years in education, parti
cularly in California. More students
go farther in education in California
lhan in other parts of the country,
and Stanford is unhampered by char
ter restrictions in meeting the needs
of these students. On the contrary, it
is enjoined by the expressed inten
tions of its founders to strive to meet
