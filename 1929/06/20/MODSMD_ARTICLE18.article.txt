# Welcome to the Farm

As Director Sellards says in his note of welcome to new students on
the campus this quarter, all the old-timers join in extending a cordial
greeting. More than that, the old-timers would impress on the newcomers
that registering as Stanford students has made them citizens of this
"red-tiled principality," as Dr. Jordan has called it, in full standing. They
are no longer aliens or strangers. They belong here. All the rights and
privileges of Stanford men and women are theirs.
These rights and privileges are theirs for the taking, but they must
do the taking. Nobody will force you, new citizens of Stanford, to share
in the life and activities of Stanford, but you will lose and the Uni
versity will lose if you fail to do so. The summer quarter has a greater
proportion of students not here in other quarters than the autumn, winter
and spring terms do, but it is nevertheless Stanford. There are other dif
ferences —absence of intercollegiate athletics, for example —but its spirit
and character are nevertheless Stanford.
The summer quarter has its own distinctive character. Intercollegiate
rivalry is dormant for a space, the fraternities and sororities are quies
cent, some of the regular "activities" are given a respite. But Stanford
continues and remains itself. And all students on the campus today are
Stanford students. Whether they gain the benefits of being a Stanford
student or become hermits in the midst of a life that is full and colorful
is for their own choice. There are no "outsiders" here except by their
own choice.
