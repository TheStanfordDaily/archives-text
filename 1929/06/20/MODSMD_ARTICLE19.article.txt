# Wise Concentration
## 
### 
Sure, this summer quarter requires the same academic standards of
scholarship as other quarters, or whatever it is that the official pronounce
ment says in emphasizing that this is a regular term of the University
and not a sort of off-season time for easy getting by in pleasantly mild
courses. Indeed, the proportion of earnest students here for serious pur
poses is very likely greater than in other quarters, making high grades
more than ordinarily difficult through the stress of competition.

But all the same, it is summer and summer is a normal time for some
degree of relaxation and recreation, especially for those who are inten
sively occupied during the rest of the year, as a good many of the students
registering today are.

There is an actual danger that some of these students will concen
trate on their studies exclusively. Concentration on studies is wise when
the matter in hand is studies, but wisdom also dictates some relaxation
from this close application to the main interest.
Sound common sense will lead a good student to give mind and body
the benefit of varied exercise. For the mind the University administra
tion has provided a remarkably attractive set of profitable employments
in lectures of many sorts and in musical programs. It would be poor
judgment that would pass all these by and lose the mental and spiritual
broadening and uplift they offer in order to stick narrowly to the three
or four subjects of a chosen curriculum, especially when more effective
work could be done on those subjects if the mind were freshened by being
directed for a time to other interests.

It is advisable even to take a little time out for play, for the same
reason, l ake some of the week-end excursions; go to some of the social
parties; take a walk out into the hills, take a swim in the pool. Freshen
up between periods of concentration.
