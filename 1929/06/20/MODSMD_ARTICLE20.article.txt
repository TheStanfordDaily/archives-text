# Summer Quarter Daily
## 
### 
The Summer Daily—which is published twice a week—strives to be
a useful community newspaper. The humorous anomaly of a "Daily"
appearing only on Tuesdays and Thursdays is accepted because the Stan
ford Daily is the official name of the student body newspaper, which this
is, and conditions have not so far warranted its being published every day
during the summer quarter.
But, name aside, the twice-a-week seeks to be useful in all the ways
it can to this Stanford community. It will keep its readers informed about
what is happening and what is planned. In the absence of some of the
centripetal forces of the other quarters its hopes to serve to pull the stu
dent body together at this time by being a source of information about
what is going on and offering a forum for the discussion of matters of
common interest.
The Daily will welcome communications on any subjects which may
usefully be brought before the Stanford body, student and faculty. We
ask only that the subjects be worth public attention, that the writers make
themselves known to us, although we do not insist that names be signed
in publication, and that—without making an arbitrary space limitation —
they be as brief as possible.
Every student upon registering automatically becomes a subscriber to
the paper and a part owner. Others are invited to subscribe at $1 for the
quarter. On the campus the Daily will be distributed by carrier. In Palo
Alto the comparatively small number may obtain their copies on the days
of publication at the Southern Pacific news stand at the depot, through
the courtesy of the management there. Paying subscribers will receive
their papers through the postoffice. Some students may want to subscribe
for papers to be sent by mail to families and friends. The expenditure of
a dollar may be a good investment since it will save some portion of the
labor of letter writing about subjects of general interest which will be
covered in the paper.
