# Give Them Your Address
## 
### 
The suggestion of the postoftice that students and faculty give it
correct addresses to ensure the prompt delivery of letters is worth heed
ing. The postoffice after all is managed by men with human limitations
which prevent their knowing by instinct where people go to when tlicy go
away from where they were and a letter is no homing pigeon. The Regis
trar's office, too, might profitably be informed if you change your resi
dence after you have given it there. And if yon can persuade all your
correspondents that Stanford letters ought not to have "Palo Alto" on
them you will have done something that nobody else has ever succeeded
in doing. But it's worth trying, if for nothing more than the sport of
the thing.
