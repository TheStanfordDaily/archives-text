# OPEN NEW MEMORIAL LIBRARY; BOOK GIFT VALUED AT $35,000
## 
### 
Different from anything else in th 6
Stanford Library building is the room
housing the Charlotte Ashley Felton
Memorial Library, the gift of Mrs.
Kate Felton Neilson. This room, with
its atmosphere of a fine private li
brary much in the character of Colo
nial America, although in no way a
"period" room, is in keeping with the
collection, which is the private library
of the donor in the gathering of which
she spent a number of years. Her gift
is named in honor of her mother and
the room, which she had prepared for
it at an expense of $3500, was formally
dedicated during the recent com
mencement season. The books are
largely first editions of American and
English authors, valued at $35,000.
The wall coverlugs of the room in
deep red damask set the note of quiet
which characterizes the library and
is carried out. in the furnishings of
dark wood and harmonizing uphol
stery of the chairs.
In connection with the new memorial
library Mrs. Neilson has established
a fellowship for a graduate student
at Stanford for advanced study. This
award, to ge known as the George
Loomis Fellowship in American Liter
ature, will provide $500 a year for re
searches within the scope of the
Charlotte Felton Library.
Mrs. Neilson, whose home is in San
Francisco, has been a Stanford bene
factor for some time, especially in
connection with the medical school
and hospitals, as well as of other
public enterprises, including the Fel
ton Memorial Grove of redwoods.
