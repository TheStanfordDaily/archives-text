# POSTOFFICE MAKES SUGGESTIONS FOR SPEEDING LETTERS
## Urges Campus People to Fill Out Directory Cards at Once 
### 
If you prefer to receive your mail
as promptly as possible rather than
to have letters run around in circles
or lie undelivered for awhile before
reaching you, the Stanford postoffice
offers a few suggestions.

Make sure that the postoffice knows
where you are and how you prefer to
have your letters delivered. The post
office maintains a directory for this
purpose, but it cannot put you in the
directory, the staff points out, unless
you give the information. They have
some pink cards that you can fill out.

Have your mail addressed to Stan
ford University, not to Palo Alto un
less you live in Palo Alto. Notify your
correspondents to address your let
ters to Stanford University and to
leave off the unnecessary and trouble
making Palo Alto. If a letter that
should come to the campus is shunted
to Palo Alto through a postal clerk
catching that name as he sorts mail,
working against time on a mail car,
there is inevitable delay in forwarding
it to the campus. Have your letters
sent here direct in the first place.
If you change your address after
you reach here notify the Stanford
postoffice immediately so that they
can make the correction in the direc
tory.
With a population shifting so large
ly from quarter to quarter, the Stan
ford mail handlers say they have a
difficult time at best, but can accom
plish prompt delivery if those who
want prompt delivery will do their
share in making it possible.
