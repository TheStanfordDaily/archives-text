# GERMAN WILL TALK ON THE UNIVERSITIES OF HIS NATIVE LAND
## Professor von der Leyen of Cologne to be First Speaker In Wednesday Series 
### 
"German Universities, Old and
New," will be the subject of the first
of the series of Wednesday afternoon
lectures on June 26. These Wednesday
lectures will be a regular feature of
the summer quarter. Professor Fried
rich von der Leyen, who will give this
first talk, is well-equipped to discuss
the subject, so far as modern German
universities are concerned through
his personal contacts and experiences
with them. He has been a student at
the Universities of Marburg, Leipzig,
Berlin, and Munich, and a member of
the faculty at Munich and at Cologne,
from which he is now on leave to be
a member of the German department
at Stanford this quarter.

Dr. von der Leyen is a scholar of
broad interests and an interesting
lecturer. His visit to Stanford is not
his first American teaching experi
ence, as he was a visiting professor
at Yale a number of years ago.
The Wednesday lectures will be
given in the Little Theatre at 4:15
o'clock.
The second lecture in the series, on
July 29, will be by Professor Ferdi
nand C. S. Schiller, who is teaching
at the University of California at
Berkeley this summer and who will
speak on "Eugenics as a Moral Ideal."
