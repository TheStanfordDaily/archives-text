# SPORT AIRPLANE ON VIEW
## 
### 
Aviation enthusiasts may see the most
modern development in sport airplanes at
the Palo Alto School of Aviation field
from 12 to 2 o'clock in the afternoon by
inspecting a new Waco Ten-T plane pur
chased by Dr. Albert B. McKee of
Woodside for his son Donald. The ship,
with the latest improvements, including
tapered wings and streamline construc
tion, is to be kept at the local field until
young McKee learns to fly.
