# SANTA CRUZ TRIP IS FIRST OF SERIES OF WEEK-END AUTO TOURS
## Saturday Excursions Will Include Many Points of Interest 
### 
Following a custom of former sum
mer quarters, Director John A. Sel
lards has arranged for a series of
Saturday automobile trips for students
to nearby points of interest at special
low rates.
The first of these excursions will be
to Santa Cruz on June 29, providing
a chance to view three characteristic
features of neighboring topography—
the Santa Clara Valley, the redwood
covered mountains between the valley
and the ocean, and the beach of Mon
terey bay.
The first part of the journey is
along the valley floor and into the
foothills at Los Gatos, the route of
this portion of the excursion lying
among the prune and apricot orchards
that make Santa Clara county famous
throughout the world.
Through California Forests
At Los Gatos the road winds up into
the Santa Cruz mountains and over
the crest of the range along the beau
tifully paved Santa Cruz grade. Red
woods and other typical California
forest trees flank the road, with
glimpses here and there of heavily
wooded mountains, deep valleys, oc
casional mountain ranches or summer
homes, and on the later stretches of
the famous Monterey bay and the
Pacific.
Santa Cruz has for many years
been a beach resort and amusement
place that attracts thousands of
visitors. There is a good bathing
beach and a variety of other oppor
tunities for a good time, including a
large number of restaurants, some of
them specializing on the fish caught
in the neighborhood. The excursion
ists will provide their luncheons ac
cording to their fancy.
