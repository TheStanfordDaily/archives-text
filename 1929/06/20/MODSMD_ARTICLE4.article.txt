# ALLEN WILL DISCUSS WOODLAND THEATRE CONCERT PROGRAMS
## University Organist Presents First Lecture-Recital This Afternoon 
### 
The first of a series of weekly
Thursday afternoon lecture-recitals by
University Organist Warren D. Allen
will be given in the Memorial Church
this afternoon at 4 o'clock. The plan
of these recitals is to provide informal
discussions of the programs of the
symphony concerts at the Woodland
Theatre. Each Thursday Organist Al
len will have his program on the
organ consist largely of excerpts from
the symphony selections of the fol
lowing Sunday, giving a non-technical
talk on the music and its composers
before playing the compositions on
the organ.
In accordance with this idea, Mr.
Allen will take as his theme this
afternoon the program to be con
ducted next Sunday by Bernardino
Molinari, the numbers of that concert
being: "Autumno" by Vivaldi, Beetho
ven's Symphony No. 7, "Alle fonti del
Clitunno," a new composition by
Gasco, Strauss' "Don Juan," and Wag
ner's "Meistersinger" prelude.

These informal explanations of the
Woodland Theatre programs by the
Stanford organist are in furtherance
of the co-operative arrangement by
which Stanford students and faculty
members are given special rates by
the Sunday symphony management.
Mr. Allen hopes that by giving some
understanding of the music to those
who will attend the Sunday concerts
he may help them to gain greater
pleasure from them.
