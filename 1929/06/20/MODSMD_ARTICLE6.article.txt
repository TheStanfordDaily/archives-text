# DIRECTOR EXTENDS WELCOME TO NEW STANFORD STUDENTS
## 
### BY JOHN A. SELLARDS 
A cordial welcome is extended to all
students attending Stanford Univer
sity during the summer quarter. We
want the former students who are
returning for advanced work, and
visiting students who come from
widely separated points of the United
States and other countries, to feel
that they are a part of the campus
community. Students remaining on
from the spring quarter, who are on
familiar ground, join with us in ex
tending the spirit of hospitality. The
student body in summer, though less
closely organized than that of the rest
of the academic year, is united by
many common interests, and oppor
tunities for meeting at informal gath
erings are offered frequently.
Standards Maintained
The summer quarter at Stanford is
a part of the regular academic year;
neither requirements nor curricula
are lowered. Members of the regular
faculty, men whose high standing in
leadership and research we all know,
remain on duty in each department;
they are joined by noted educators
from other institutions of America and
of Europe. In no way is there any
falling off from the Stanford standard
of scholarship. Nevertheless, there is
a seasonal change in student life.
Athletic and other student activities
are not so pressing. Through the sum
mer, students are advised to concen
trate their work, and allow a reason
able time of freedom in which to profit
by the many opportunities for general
culture and healthful recreation.
Extra-Curricular Opportunities
Lecturers of world-wide reputation
will be with us from time to time.
Much of the best in music may be
heard, both on the campus and in the
nearby Woodland Theatre, where the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
will present a series of concerts under
the leadership of guest conductors. In
the Art Gallery will be successive ex
hibitions of European paintings and
handicraft. Dramatic performances of
merit are offered, with the students as
players. Excursions to points of in
terest, including Lick Observatory,
are aranged for the week-ends.
We wish for all our students a most
successful summer, with progress in
Iheir studies and research, with in
spiration and recreation from the com
muity life to which Stanford wel-

A cordial welcome is extended to all
students attending Stanford Univer
sity during the summer quarter. We
want the former students who are
returning for advanced work, and
visiting students who come from
widely separated points of the United
States and other countries, to feel
that they are a part of the campus
community. Students remaining on
from the spring quarter, who are on
familiar ground, join with us in ex
tending the spirit of hospitality. The
student body in summer, though less
closely organized than that of the rest
of the academic year, is united by
many common interests, and oppor
tunities for meeting at informal gath
erings are offered frequently.
Standards Maintained
The summer quarter at Stanford is
a part of the regular academic year;
neither requirements nor curricula
are lowered. Members of the regular
faculty, men whose high standing in
leadership and research we all know,
remain on duty in each department;
they are joined by noted educators
from other institutions of America and
of Europe. In no way is there any
falling off from the Stanford standard
of scholarship. Nevertheless, there is
a seasonal change in student life.
Athletic and other student activities
are not so pressing. Through the sum
mer, students are advised to concen
trate their work, and allow a reason
able time of freedom in which to profit
by the many opportunities for general
culture and healthful recreation.
Extra-Curricular Opportunities
Lecturers of world-wide reputation
will be with us from time to time.
Much of the best in music may be
heard, both on the campus and in the
nearby Woodland Theatre, where the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
will present a series of concerts under
the leadership of guest conductors. In
the Art Gallery will be successive ex
hibitions of European paintings and
handicraft. Dramatic performances of
merit are offered, with the students as
players. Excursions to points of in
terest, including Lick Observatory,
are aranged for the week-ends.
We wish for all our students a most
successful summer, with progress in
Iheir studies and research, with in
spiration and recreation from the com
muity life to which Stanford wel-

comes them
