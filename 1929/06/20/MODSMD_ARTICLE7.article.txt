# ALL-STUDENT DANCE AT ROBLE NEXT WEEK FIRST GET-TOGETHER
## 
### 
The first general student social af
fair of the quarter will be the all
student dance at Roble Hall Friday
night, a week from tomorrow. This
first get-together of the summer is de
signed for all students registered in
the University.

An excellent orchestra will furnish
music for dancing from 9 o'clock until
1 and there will be card tables for
those who prefer to play bridge or
whist.
Refreshments will be provided.
Since all students are desired to
attend this informal party no formal
invitations are needed and none will
be sent out. In previous years this
first Roble function has proved to bo
one of the pleasantest of the quarter,
and plans are being arranged to en
sure equal success this year.
