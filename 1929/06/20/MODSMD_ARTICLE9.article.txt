## Woodland Theater Symphony Programs Given Weekly from Now to August 11 Busses Will Run from Roble to Hillsborough and Back for Campus Patrons 
### 
Director Sellards has arranged again
this summer as in previous years with
the Philharmonic Society of San
Mateo County for special rates for
Stanford students and faculty mem
bers for the series of symphony con
certs in the Woodland Theatre Sun
day afternoons from June 23 to Au
gust 11.
The opening of the summer quarter
and of tho outdoor symphony series
come this year at times that permit
Stanford people to attend all the con
certs. In former years the concerts
have begun before Stanford opened
for the quarter, so that the first con
cert was missed.
Molinari First Conductor
Bernardino Molinari, the eminent
and popular Italian musician, will be
conductor of the first concert, next
Sunday afternoon, and on the Sunday
after that. He made his first Cali
fornia appearance last year and won
instant success with symphony lovers
of this state, as he had the year be
fore in New York, when he was first
heard in America after long success
in Rome.
Conductors for other concerts in
clude Alfred Hertz, Eugene Goossens,
Ernest Blocli, and Bruno Walter.
The San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra has made the annual series in
the Woodland Theatre a center of
musical enjoyment in the three years
during which the concerts have been
held.
New Stage Prepared
The Woodland Theatre, which lias
been constructed for these outdoor
concerts, is adjacent to the Hillsbor
ough school, just off El Camino Real
highway between Burlingame and
San Mateo.
Complete new stage equipment has
been erected in preparation for the
season. Extensive study and consider
able experiment have resulted in the
perfection of plans for a structure
which, while furnishing shelter and
shade for orchestra members, will give
a maximum sounding-board back
ground, and at the same time avoid
any obvious or intruding supports at
the front of the stage.
Special Stanford Rate
For Stanford students and faculty
members a rate of $4 for a book of
eight admissions has been arranged,
the regular price of such books being
$5. These admission coupons may be

used one at a time for the eight indi
vidual concerts or for several admis
sions to one concert, as the purchaser
desires. They may be purchased at

tration building.
A special bus will leave Roble Hall
each Sunday and make the trip to the
Woodland Theatre In time for the
concert, and will return to the cam
pus after the concert. The route for
private automobiles by San Mateo
avenue from El Camino Real is plain
ly marked and there is ample parking
space close to the theatre. For those
who go by train there is free trans
