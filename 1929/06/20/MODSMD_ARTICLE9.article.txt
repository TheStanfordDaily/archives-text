# SUNDAY CONCERT SERIES OFFERED AT SPECIAL RATE
## Woodland Theater Symphony Programs Given Weekly from Now to August 11 Busses Will Run from Roble to Hillsborough and Back for Campus Patrons 
### 
Director Sellards has arranged again
this summer as in previous years with
the Philharmonic Society of San
Mateo County for special rates for
Stanford students and faculty mem
bers for the series of symphony con
certs in the Woodland Theatre Sun
day afternoons from June 23 to Au
gust 11.
The opening of the summer quarter
and of tho outdoor symphony series
come this year at times that permit
Stanford people to attend all the con
certs. In former years the concerts
have begun before Stanford opened
for the quarter, so that the first con
cert was missed.
Molinari First Conductor
Bernardino Molinari, the eminent
and popular Italian musician, will be
conductor of the first concert, next
Sunday afternoon, and on the Sunday
after that. He made his first Cali
fornia appearance last year and won
instant success with symphony lovers
of this state, as he had the year be
fore in New York, when he was first
heard in America after long success
in Rome.
Conductors for other concerts in
