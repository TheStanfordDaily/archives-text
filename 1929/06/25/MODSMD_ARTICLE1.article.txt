### 
An illustrated lecture on "Cities of
Southern Spain" will be given by Pro
fessor Aurelio Espinosa of the Ro
manic Languages department at 8
o'clock this evening in the Little
Theatre.
This lecture, the first Tuesday eve
ning program this summer, is based
upon personal visitation, and Profes
sor Espinosa will cover in detail the
cities of Granada, Seville, Cordova,
and Toledo. Although Toledo is not a
southern city, it is of particular in
terest because of its Moorish archi
tecture and was at one time the capi
tal of Spain.
Special emphasis will be placed
upon the development of Arabic archi
tecture in Spain, embracing the mix
ture of the Arabic and the Christian
up to the end of the sixteenth cen
tury, and the final conquest and es
tablishment of the Arabic in Spain.
Professor Espinosa has been con
nected with the Romanic Languages
department of Stanford since 1910. In
1921 he was made a corresponding
member of the Royal Spanish Aca
demy, and became a corresponding
member of the Real Academia de Cien
tias y Artes in the same year. In 1922
he became Commendator con Placa de
la Orden de Isabel la Catolica and
was president of the American Folk
lore Society in 1924 and 1925.
