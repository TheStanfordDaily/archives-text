# Roble Holds First Summer Open House Friday Evening
## 
### 
Roble Hall will hold an all-campus
open house Friday evening from nine
until one. All registered students and
faculty members are cordially invited.
A Rood orchestra will provide music
for dancing, there will be tables in
the lobby for those who would rather
play cards, and refreshments will be
served. This informal evening will be
the first of its kind during the entire
summer quarter.
