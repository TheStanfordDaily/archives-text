# MITCHELL DEPLORES '500' RULE AS LIMIT ON STANFORD WOMEN
## Registrar Backs Percentage Theory of Limitation as Better "Tradition" 
### 
"The limitation of the number of
women students permitted in the Uni
versity to five hundred seems rather
unjust in view of the growth of the
University," said Dr. J. P. Mitchell,
University registrar, in a talk on
Stanford Traditions at All-Saints Epis
copal Church, Palo Alto, Sunday
evening.
"Stanford is free from many binding
traditions which might tend to hinder
our progress. In fact, there are only
three institutions which have lasted
long enough to be called traditions."
One is "No Smoking on the Quad."
This is an old tradition which has
stood for years. Another is the Honor
Code, which has stood for ten or fif
teen years. It tends to make the stu
dents more independent. The third is
the limitation of women.
"The object of this rule was prob
ably to limit the women students to
fifty per cent or less of the student
body. It is a shame that the amend
ment was not worded to state a cer
tain per cent, say thirty or forty, in
stead of a definite limit. As the rule
stands it seems unfair to the women
but it is a part of the constitution so
it cannot be violated."
He went on to enumerate some of
the undertakings and special work
which is being carried on by Stanford
with the aid of other institutions.
"Stanford," he said, "is exceedingly
fortunate in being well-endowed by
many charitable institutions. It is con
sidered as being very prosperous. As
a matter of fact it is not, but it has
succeeded in keeping out of bank-

ruptcy, which is more than many other
universities have been able to do. Our
income goes mostly to salaries for
the faculty, although we had a build
ing spurt when we built Toyon hall,
Branner hall, the new Roble hall, and
the eating clubs back of Encina.
"The Board of Athletic Control is
fortunate in the fact that it has a
large income, and therefore it has
planned some new improvements. Of
these improvements only the new gym
nasium and the golf course can be
made public at this time."
