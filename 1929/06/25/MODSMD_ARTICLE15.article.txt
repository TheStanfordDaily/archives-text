# JUNGEBLUT TO LEAVE STANFORD FOR WORK IN INFANT PARALYSIS
## To Seek Cure for Dreaded Disease in Two Years' Work in New York 
### 
Dr. Claus W. Jungeblut has resigned
his position of associate professor of
bacteriology at Stanford to take a
position as associate professor of bac
teriology at Columbia University. For
the first two years Dr. Jungeblut will
be in charge of research work on in
fantile paralysis.
The funds for this work are in the
"hands of a national committee, and
are being divided over a number of
Eastern and European collegesâ€”
Columbia University, New York Uni
versity, University of Chicago, and
others. The plan is for two or three
years of concentrated effort to find
the cause, the means of dissemina
tion, and the possibilities for cure.
The program contemplated is very
large, and the work is to be divided
among the several universities so that
there will be no duplication.
So far nothing very definite along
this line has been accomplished al
though considerable work has been
done by the Rockefeller Institute. It
is hoped that this research will re
veal whether or not some type of
artificial serum, other than that ob
tained from the convalescent human
being, may be produced. The work will
be carried on along the lines of serum
therapy, and possibly chemo-therapy
in an endeavor to find something to
take the place of the serum.

Dr. Jungeblut will work with Dr.
F. B. Gay of Columbia and W. H. Park
of the New York Department of
Health, is chairman of the National
Poliomyelitis Commission.
