# DAVIS CUTS LIST FOR FIRST PLAY; 41 SUCCESSFUL
## Turnout Large for "Adding Machine"; 28 Women, 19 Men Competing for Parts Further Tryouts To Be Held Tonight in Assembly Hall; Need Graduate Students 
### 
Preliminary tryouts held last night
for the Elmer llice play, "The Adding
Machine," resulted in the selection of
twenty-eight women and nineteen men
who are eligible for the second tryouts
to be held in the Assembly Hall to
night.
Gordon Davis, director of dramatics,
called the turnout "unusually large"
and the "quality and variety of types
excellent." However, he states that
anyone who did not try out last eve
ning will be given an opportunity at
tonight's trials, to be held in the As
sembly Hall from seven to eight.
A number of graduate students are
needed to fill several of the more
mature roles. Contrary to the usual
rule, freshman women are eligible for
dramatics this quarter. An unusually
large number of minor parts are open
because of the several mob scenes.
The cast will number twenty-five.
"The Adding Machine" will be pre
sented July 12 as the first of the
summer play series. Introduced four
years ago in New York by the Thea
tre Guild, it is similar in type to
Rice's "Street Scene" which was
awarded this year's Pulitzer Prize.
The play offers a modernistic quality
unusual to campus dramatics of the
regular season.
Those who survived the first try
outs and who will report tonight from
eight to nine are:
Ruth Beede, Nora Blichfeldt, B.
Booth, Elizabeth Boynton, Katherine
