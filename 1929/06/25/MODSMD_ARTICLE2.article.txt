# SUMMER RULES FOR WOMEN UNCHANGED DECLARES DEAN YOST
## 
### 
Regulations for women during the
summer quarter are practically the
same as those carried out during the
regular school year, according to Dean
Yost. All undergraduates, including
members of sororities whose houses
are disorganized during the summer
term, are required to reside at Roble
Hall, unless living with their parents.
Additional copies of University rules

for women are now being printed and
will be available to all women students
this week. University rules for women
are not formulated from a standpoint
of discipline but are based rather on
the ideals of what constitutes good
citizenship, Dean Yost said.
