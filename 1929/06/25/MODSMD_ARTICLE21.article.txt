Registrar J. Pearce Mitchell voiced the regret of a great majority
of Stanford people when in his informal talk about Stanford customs/
and traditions the other evening he said that it was one of our "traditions"
the permanence of which he was sorry for.
The fixed minority of women at Stanford produces an unhappy
situation in many ways; it is not good for the men to have the proportion
of women so much smaller than their own number that it leads to
suspicions, at least, that the women can assume very exclusive and inde
pendent airs, and it is not the best thing for the women.
And there is no wholly satisfactory way out of it,seemingly. The
fixed limitation of five hundred women students is a part of the constitu
tion of the University, placed there by Mrs. Stanford, as surviving
founder, to insure that the institution established as a memorial to her
son, should not by any possibility become preponderantly a women's
college. Maybe the provision might be removed by legal procedures,
but nobody wants to risk tampering with the foundations of the Univer
sity by legislation action or court action.

Moreover, as things stand now with the endowment, to increase the
number of women would necessarily automatically reduce the number
of men, for the resourcs of the University have already dictated that the
size of the student body cannot be permitted to become much greater
unless there is increased funds to care for the added students properly.
Th most talked-of solution of the difficulty is a sister university, for
women alone, set up near Stanford, supervised by the same authori
ties, enjoying many Stanford privileges, and giving degrees of equal
value. That would eradicate most of the practical difficulties—if some
body would provide the million or two needed.
