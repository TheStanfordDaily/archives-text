# Listening To The Siren
## 
### 
The siren of the campus motor cop is not usually so nearly continuous
in its wails as it has been these first days of the new quarter. Officer
Olsen is evidently giving his imitation of the busy bee which improves
each shining hour and makes and sounds as it flits from place to
place because he wants rest and leisure later. ITe hopes, apparently, to
impress on campus auto drivers that there are speed regulations on
the Farm and that it pays to observe these regulations. Violating them
brings penalties, and those penalties have to be paid if students desire
to remain in residence. Once the motor policeman has got this big idea
across lie won't have to chase so many speeders and can trundle more
gently about or sit at intersections at his observant ease. The wise thing
to do, then, is to learn what the campus motor rules are and keep within
them. It is ever so much more fun hearing the siren blown for some
body else than for you.
