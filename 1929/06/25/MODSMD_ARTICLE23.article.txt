# Even Married Students Buy

Tlie Palo Alto Times points out, for the encouragement of the busi
ness men of its city, that summer quarter students who are married and
bring their families with them provide more than the ordinary amount
of college student buying power. It says:
"The 1929 summer quarter is now under way, with indica
tions for a record term enrollment. From year to year the summer
registration at Stanford grows. Though the number of students
in the vacation period is smaller than that of the other quarters
of the year, the difference in local population is made up in large
part by the fact that many of the summer students, being of the
graduate and professional class, bring their families with them.
And that means much to Palo Alto business houses."
Many of the summer quarter students will doubtless subscribe to
the Times, which makes it a good advertising medium to obtain their
trade. All of the summer quarter students without exception are auto
matically subscribers to the Stanford Daily.
