### 
Signs about the campus still offer inducements to take summer tours
that are already on the high seas, to attend summer schools that are
already in session hundreds or thousands of miles away, to buy tickets
for events that are now history, to get theses typewritten, to do all sorts
of things that can 110 longer be done. The signs are out of date, worse
than useless, sometimes a source of confusion, and always an eyesore.
Nobody seems to be able to prevent the evil or stop it. The sole and
only usefulness of these evidencs of indifference and carelessness is their
availability as something to fuss about. Tear 'em down.
