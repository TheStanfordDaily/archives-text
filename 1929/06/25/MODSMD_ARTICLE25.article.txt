# Might Visit the Museum
## 
### 
It is a stock joke—and a human fact—that people never go to the
points of chief local interest unless they have occasion to take visitors
from a distance there. That sort of thing holds true of Stanford's many
interesting places. There arc Stanford men and women who have never
been inside the museum; some, maybe, almost never enter the art gal
lery; probably some don't even know where the site of the old trotting
farm is, with its interesting tablets and monument. Any of these places,
and a number of others is worth a half hour's time now and then.
