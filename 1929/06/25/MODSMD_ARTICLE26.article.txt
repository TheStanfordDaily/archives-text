We invite all readers to make the fullest use of the Daily as a means
of keeping abreast of what is going on, as a medium for getting to the
whole community items of information concerning activities and enter
prises in which they are interested, and as a vehicle for launching opinions
for consideration and discussion.

The Memorial Church organ showed sense. It is a good Native Son
of the Golden West and when the temperature reached the abnormal
and abominable heights it attained last week-end, as it has no right to
do in California, the organ just refused to play. It wouldnt' work.
None of us would if that sort of weather were permitted to keep up.
