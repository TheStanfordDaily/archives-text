# CONSTRUCTION WORK ON CELLAR WILL BE ENDED BY OCTOBER
## Enlargement of Stanford Meeting Place Will Aid During Rush Hours 
### 
In order to merge the Cellar with
"The Roost" the floor of the section
formerly occupied by the latter is
being brought down to a level with
the main room. When that is finished
service will be given in that part of
the building while alterations are con
tinued in the rest of the Cellar space.

Larger accommodations in the
Cellar, popular refreshment rendez
vous, and in the much-patronized book
store will be realized when the aca
demic doors open again next October.

The problem of handling the great
number of patrons in these places at
rush periods during the day and dur
ing many festival occasions during
the year has long been a perplexing
problem to the respective directors.
Consequently students and faculty
may look favorably upon the improve
ments that are now under way.
When completed, the Cellar will be
enlarged by another fountain which
will have a capacity for seating forty
more people, an additional number of
booths, and by an extension of the
tobacco department. The new sec
tion, which was formerly a separate
soft drink and tobacco store, will be
completely renovated and furnished
with the most modern equipment.
There was some consideration given
to the idea of installing strictly futur
istic designs in furniture and in gen
eral appearance but Blakewell and
Brown, architects for the work, be
lieve that a conservative style of
decoration would be more suitable and
would also blend more favorably with
the present furnishings of the Cellar.
They explain that futuristic designing
is attractive and pleasing to the eye
because of its unusual contrast of
colors but that continual and pro
longed familiarity with it is apt to
cause it to become dull and tiresome.

Roost" the floor of the section formerly

When that is finished service will be

the Cellar space.
The final location of the Union store
will be about where the southern part of
the Cellar kitchen now is situated. In
front of the store counters will be a
lounging place supplied with periodicals
and newspapers and appropriately fur
nished.
Revision of the lower floors of the Old
Union Building will be completed be
fore the opening of the fall term. When
the reconstruction is finished both foun
tain and booth service will be available
in one place, the booths being arranged
around the wall as they now are, while
the store will be nearby in the same
room.
Operation of the three eating places,
the Union dining room, Cafeteria and
Cellar is an indication of the growth in
summer enrollment since it has never lie
fore been necessary to have the three.
Alterations in the building formerly
occupied by the Y.M.C.A. are progres
sing rapidly with the idea of making this
building available as soon as possible for
the Stanford Bookstore, which will oc
cupy this additional space as soon as
it is ready.

the main room. When that is finished
service will be given in that part of
the building while alterations are con
tinued in the rest of the Cellar space.

Larger accommodations in the
Cellar, popular refreshment rendez
vous, and in the much-patronized book
store will be realized when the aca
demic doors open again next October.

The problem of handling the great
number of patrons in these places at
rush periods during the day and dur
ing many festival occasions during
the year has long been a perplexing
problem to the respective directors.
Consequently students and faculty
may look favorably upon the improve
ments that are now under way.
When completed, the Cellar will be
enlarged by another fountain which
will have a capacity for seating forty
more people, an additional number of
booths, and by an extension of the
tobacco department. The new sec
tion, which was formerly a separate
soft drink and tobacco store, will be
completely renovated and furnished
with the most modern equipment.
There was some consideration given
to the idea of installing strictly futur
istic designs in furniture and in gen
eral appearance but Blakewell and
Brown, architects for the work, be
lieve that a conservative style of
decoration would be more suitable and
would also blend more favorably with
the present furnishings of the Cellar.
They explain that futuristic designing
is attractive and pleasing to the eye
because of its unusual contrast of
colors but that continual and pro
longed familiarity with it is apt to
cause it to become dull and tiresome.

In order to merge the Cellar with "The
Roost" the floor of the section formerly
occupied by the Store is being brought
down to a level with the main room.
When that is finished service will be
given in that part of the building while
alterations are continued in the rest of
the Cellar space.
The final location of the Union store
will be about where the southern part of
the Cellar kitchen now is situated. In
front of the store counters will be a
lounging place supplied with periodicals
and newspapers and appropriately fur
nished.
Revision of the lower floors of the Old
Union Building will be completed be
fore the opening of the fall term. When
the reconstruction is finished both foun
tain and booth service will be available
in one place, the booths being arranged
around the wall as they now are, while
the store will be nearby in the same
room.
Operation of the three eating places,
the Union dining room, Cafeteria and
Cellar is an indication of the growth in
summer enrollment since it has never lie
fore been necessary to have the three.
Alterations in the building formerly
occupied by the Y.M.C.A. are progres
sing rapidly with the idea of making this
building available as soon as possible for
the Stanford Bookstore, which will oc
cupy this additional space as soon as
it is ready.
