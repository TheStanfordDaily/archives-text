# WANDERING PRODIGALS RESTORED TO FAMILY

### 
Even their own mother didn't know
them!
It happened this way: a duck owned
by Dr. J. C. Almack of the Education
department, evidently lured to the
cool, fern-lined patio of the homo of
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, by the organ music, laid eighteen
eggs in the court, all but one of which
hatched.

Four of the ducklings were given
away and had remained with their
new owner but a few weeks when
they were returned to the Almacks
for the vacation period. The parent
ducks, not recognizing their offspring,
played havoc with them, pulling out
most of their top feathers in their
displeasure.
The duck family has finally become
reconciled and is now back on the
job of ridding the whole block of
bugs and slugs.

Dr. Douglas Houghton Campbell,
emeritus professor of botany at Stan
ford. was elected president, Dr. E. C.
Martin, professor of physiology at
Stanford, was re-elected vice-president,
and Professor J. O. Snyder of the
Stanford Zoology department was re
elected a director of the Pacific and
Southwestern divisions of the Ameri

of Science at its recent Conference
held at Berkeley Saturday.
