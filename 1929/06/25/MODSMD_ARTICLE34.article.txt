# ONLY SEVENTY-FIVE OAK TREES REMOVED FROM GOLF COURSE
## Locations at Stanford Links Changed by Architects To Save Scenery 
### 
Only seventy-five oak trees of the
approximately five thousand that
cover the 175 acres of Stanford's
championship golf course were re
moved in order to make room for the
fairways of the eighteen holes. The
architects, Thomas and Bell of Pasa
dena, who built Castlewood and Bel-
Air, made every possible effort to
save the trees by re-designing the lo
cations. The course will cost fully
$100,000 and will be ready for playing
by the first of next year. The grass
will be planted in August. About one
half of the $42,000 a year necessary
for maintenance will come from one
hundred and fifty outside member
ships, each costing $125 a year.
The charge to students and faculty
members will be one dollar on week
days and two on Saturdays and Sun
days, and holidays under the "pay as
you play" plan. For the "fanatics,"
the privileges for three months will
cost $15. As yet, no club house has
been provided but one will be erected
as soon as sufficient appropriations
are made. At present the equipment
Includes a caddy house, workshop,
and concessions, The fairways
nearly four miles have a capacity of
between three hundred and four hun
dred a day.

The normal course is 6400 yards
long but the Stanford course, by tee
ing off back of the greens, is 6640
yards. Coo coos bent grass is to be
used on the greens anil Patravalias
and Kentucky Blue grass on the fair
ways. Experts will find the course a
difficult one, yet at the same time it
will accommodate the worst dub, who
is wise enough to go around the trees
and hazards instead of over them.
The course crosses the creek five
times.
Some sort of a precaution, such as
a net, will protect autos on the road
past the first tee. A foot bridge is
to be built across the road. The work
of grading and constructing the sand
traps and bunkers, including the lay-

ing of pipe lines, is being carried on
by the Board of Athletic Control.
As yet the pro has not been selected
and applications are still coming in
for consideration.

The normal course is 6400 yards
long but the Stanford course, by tee
ing off back of the greens, is 6640
yards. Coo coos bent grass is to be
used on the greens anil Patravalias
and Kentucky Blue grass on the fair
ways. Experts will find the course a
difficult one, yet at the same time it
will accommodate the worst dub, who
is wise enough to go around the trees
and hazards instead of over them.
The course crosses the creek five
times.
Some sort of a precaution, such as
a net, will protect autos on the road
past the first tee. A foot bridge is
to be built across the road. The work
of grading and constructing the sand

save the trees by re-designing the lo

$100,000 and will be ready for playing
by the first of next year. The grass
will be planted in August. About one
half of the $42,000 a year necessary
for maintenance will come from one
hundred and fifty outside member
ships, each costing $125 a year.
The charge to students and faculty
members will be one dollar on week
