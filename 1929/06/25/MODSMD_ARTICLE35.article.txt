# PAGAN BELIEFS DEFY SCIENCE, IS CLAIM OF STANFORD PROFESSOR
## 
### 
Before the thirteenth annual meet
ing of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science at Berke
ley last week, Professor W. H. Man
waring of Stanford submitted a re
port maintaining that science, in spite
of its tremendous progress, has yet
to disprove certain pre-pagan beliefs
concerning the theory of evolution.
Professor Manwaring spoke before
the subject of " 'Protein Symbiosis,' a
the subject of "Protein Symbiosis," a
Possible Factor in Evolution." Pro
teins, it is explained, are highly com
plex compounds which are the funda
mental constituents of all living cells,
both plant and animal. When man
eats other animals he takes these for
eign proteins into his system. Up to
the present science has maintained
that these proteins were naturalized
within the body by gastric juices, and
that otherwise they could not be
utilized.
But recent research, Professor Man
waring said, has thrown doubt on this
accepted fact. It is 110 longer possible
to say definitely what happens to
them, but it is known that in some
instances, at least, they maintain their
identity as sheep, sow, rabbit, etc.,
proteins. As a result, he continued,
science is brought once more to the
philosopher's viewpoint, and may well
ask itself whether the foreign pro
teins do not maintain their identity,
help to shape the future of the indi
vidual, and perhaps effect however
slightly, the course of evolution of the
species.
