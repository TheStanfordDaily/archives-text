# Doctor Murray To Resume Pastorate This September
## 
### 
Dr. Augustus T. Murray will return
to Washington, D.C., this September
to continue his work as minister of
the Friends' Meeting. He was granted
leave of absence from the University
last fall to accept this position at the
Invitation of President Hoover.
Dr. Murray arrived a few days ago
to give classes this summer. He will
resume his work as professor of
classical literature here in June, 1930.

About thirty-five women will take
part in the air derby this fall, which
will cover 2200 miles from Santa
Monica, California, to Cleveland, Ohio.
