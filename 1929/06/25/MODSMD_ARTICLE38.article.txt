# COLUMBIA PROFESSOR TALKS TOMORROW ON 'MODERN EDUCATION'
## 
### 
"Modern Education in Europe" is
the subject which Dr. I. N. Kandel,
Assistant Director of the Institute of
International Education and professor
at Columbia University, has chosen
as the topic for an address which he
will give tomorrow morning at 11
o'clock in the Little Theatre.
Students enrolled here for the sum
mer and especially those registered
in the school of education, will be in
terested in this announcement, as Dr.
Kandel's wide experience as an edu
cator and a traveller gives him a
wealth of background material upon
which to draw.
Recently returned from Europe as
a representative of the Institute, Dr.
Kandel has just concluded his stay
at the University of California, where
he has been teaching at inter-session,
and, after short visit at Stanford,
will return to Columbia.
