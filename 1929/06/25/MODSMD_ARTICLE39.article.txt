# "KNOW GOD" THEME OF MORELAND SERMON IN MEMORIAL CHAPEL
## 
### 
One essential of knowledge is to !
know what and who is God. No mat
ter how many diplomas a person lias
he is not educated until he knows God.
This knowledge is revealed only to
those who seek after it. This was the
opinion expressed by William Hall
Moreland, Bishop of Sacramento, in
his sermon at the Memorial Chapel
iast Sunday morning.
Bishop Moreland went on to state
that God is revealed to the modern |
seeker in everything about him, but
especially in beauty, for beauty is
love, and God is love. He is a per- j
sonality which prevades everything, j
He must be sought with the idea that I
there is always more to learn about j
Him. If one takes the stand that God
is entirely understood stagnation sets
in. Progress in science and religion
depends on man's diligence in seek
ing God.
