# Allport Explains Trends In Social Psychology Study
## 
### 
Recent trends in social psychology,
(he problems that arise in this field,
and the experiments that are being
made in the study of this subject,
were the topics on which Dr. Floyd H.
Allport lectured yesterday in the Lit
tle Theatre. Dr. Allport is professor
of political and social psychology in
the school of citizenship and public
affairs at Syracuse University, and is
a visiting professor at the summer ses
sion at the University of California at
Los Angeles.

Dr. Allport explained the difference
between social and behavioristic
psychology, and stated that although
the individual is the seat, or locus,
of psychology, the study of the indi
vidual does not entirely explain group
behavior. There is a school of psych
ologists, known as the individualist
school, that believes in approaching
the subject through the innate and
instinctive human tendencies. How
ever, according to Dr. Allport, this
over-simplifies the problem. Professor
Dewey and the cultural determinists
favor the societal approach, which is
in terms of the social group. Profes
sor Dewey claims that human instinc
tive behavior is so greatly modified
by the social organization that it can
not be considered as an important
factor.
Dr. Allport told of experiments that
were conducted on groups of people
working together. He said that these
experiments showed the effect of the
presence of others on their opinions,
for individuals are inclined to be much
more radical in their views when not
with a large number of other people.
Furthermore, the presence of others
tends to speed up their work quanti
tatively, but lowers the quality.
He explained the difference between
the "face to face" approach, in which
the response involves the whole per
sonality and most of the habitual re
sponses, and the narrower, more
limited approach that calls for a re
sponse that does not express the
whole personality, but which is limited
to a narrower sphere of behavior be
cause it is a response to a more dis
tant stimulus.
A more interesting approach to the
social scientist, said Dr. Allport, is
the study of large scale reactions, or
pluralistic behavior. The difficulty en
countered here is that the group is

often personified. Sociologists cannot
study the group as a natural science
subject. They cannot begin such a
3tudy, because the first unit is the in
dividual. A similar problem is encoun-

tered in the study of institutions, for
these too are personified, making
scientific study impossible.
