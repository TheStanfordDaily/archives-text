# SANTA CLARA MEN AID IN MEMORIAL PAGEANT AT SAN JUAN MISSION
## 
### 
The romance of California's early
Mission days will be revived at his
toric San Juan Bautista Sunday, at a
picturesque celebration commemorat
ing the founding of the old mission
one hundred and thirty-two years ago.
A pageant depicting the days of the
early Spaniards and the activities of
the Mission fathers among the Indians
has been written for the event by
Grace T. Mitchell and this will be en
acted by students of the University
of Santa Clara. A musical program
and a parade reminiscent of the Mis
sion era will precede the pageant and
a Spanish barbecue will be held in the
rear of the Mission during the after
noon.
To motorists traveling El Camino
Real, Mission San Juan Bautista is
probably one of the best-known of the
mission chain, on account of its con
venient location just off the main
highway where the motor route passes
through San Juan, reports the Tour
ing Bureau of the California State
Automobile Association. San Juan is
ninety miles from San Francisco via
U.S. 101 (El Camino Real) and nine
teen miles beyond Salinas.
