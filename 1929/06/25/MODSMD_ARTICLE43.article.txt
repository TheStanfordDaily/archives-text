# VAN PATTEN WRITES ON MEDICAL BOOKS OF LATIN AMERICA
## Stanford Librarian Presents First Treatment of Subject in English 
### 
The "Medical Literature of Central
America and Mexico," by Nathan Van
Patten, Director of Libraries at Stan
ford, will be published in Spanish in the
Bulletin of the National Library of Mex
ico. Mr. Van Patten presented this
paper, illustrated by forty lantern slides,
at the recent meeting of the Bibliograph
ical Society of America, which was held
in Washington, D. C., jointly with the
fifty-first annual meeting of the Ameri
can Library Association.

The monograph, the result of consid
erable research, is the first comprehen
sive treatment of the subject in English.
The Pan-American Union is especially
interested in the paper as are the national
libraries and medical societies of the
countries concerned.

The work covers the period, 1570 to
1929. Francisco Bravo's "Opera Mede
cinalia," published in 1570 in Mexico
City, was the first medical work print
ed in the Americas, forty-six years prior
to Figueroa's Tratados earliest South
American publication, and a hundred and
seven years before Thatcher's broadside
appeared in Boston.

Mr. Van Patten, who recently returned
from the meeting of the American Li
brary Association in Washington, is con
tinuing to serve on the Committee on
Library Co-operation with the Hispanic
Peoples and on the Committee on Union
List of Periodicals.

While in the East he also attended the
meetings of the Special Libraries As
sociation in Washington. This associa
tion is sponsoring the preparation of an
exhaustive bibliography of water trans
portation. The Stanford librarian is re
gional director of the Pacific Coast.
