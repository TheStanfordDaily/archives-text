# STUDENT GOVERNMENT IN ACTIVE OPERATION FOR SUMMER QUARTER
## 
### 
Student government at Stanford is
in active operation during the sum
mer quarter. The position of student
body president is filled by Ted
Krough, and Dean Culver has ap
pointed Harry Strickler, Eric Krenz,
Leo Kibby, Murray Draper, and
Krough to men's council.

Men's council has jurisdiction over
student conduct, traffic violations, and
honor code violations. Violations of
the latter are punishable by expul
sion from the University, probation,
or hours added to graduation.

Traffic violations are punishable by
fines, and for repeated and serious
offenses the council may take away
the driver's license. Traffic violations
are in the main similar to those of
any city, including parking where
there are signs specifically designat
ing no parking, parking in front of
fire plugs and in front of any steps
leading to university buildings, dis
regarding stop signs and violating
speed limits. Particular attention is
called to the fact that although the
limit along Palm drive is 40 miles per
hour, the limit across all intersec
tions entering Palm drive is 15.

Improper student conduct is pun
ishable by hours at the Convalescent
Heme or hours added to graduation.

The executive committee has turned
over the date book to Director Sel
lard's office and all social functions
sponsored by campus organizations
or groups must have the dates sanc
tioned by this office. For off campus
functions it is necessary to consult
with either the Dean of Women or the
Dean of Men before applying for the
date.
