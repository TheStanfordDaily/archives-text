# PLAYGROUND OPENED FOR CAMPUS SCHOOL BY RECREATION HEAD
## 
### 
Complying with numerous requests
from parents on the campus and in
Palo Alto for a place of recreation for
children at the University, the City of
Palo Alto has inaugurated a play
ground at the Campus School, corner
of Santa Ynez street and Mayfield
avenue.
The playground, which was opened
last Thursday, will be directed by
Mrs. Laura M. Clifford, principal of
the Johnson School in the San Joaquin
Valley.

Daily programs of games, handi
crafts, and a story hour are planned
from 9 to 12 in the morning and from
1 to 4 in the afternoon. There will be
no charge for the use of the super
vised playground, although children
who choose to devote their time to
handicrafts may be asked to supply
their own materials for the work.

Six such playgrounds are already in
operation in Palo Alto under the super
vision of Charles Randall Clifford, di
rector of playgrounds and community
recreation in Palo Alto, who is gen
eral supervisor of the campus play
ground. Clifford has been supervisor
of the department of physical educa
tion in the Palo Alto City Schools for
the past five yeafs.

Prince Charles, second son of King
Albert of Belgium, was fined 100
francs for not voting last Sunday.
