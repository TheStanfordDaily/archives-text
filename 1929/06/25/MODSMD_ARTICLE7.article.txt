# STANFORD TAPPED SKULL AND BONES; LINKS YIELD RELICS
## 
### 
Excavation turned to exhuma
tion on the new Stanford golf
course last Saturday when work
men uncovered several ancient
graves and found themselves
face-to-face with the skeletons of
some early California Indians.

The pipe-line trencher ran the
honey gauntlet, throwing the re
mains of the Redskins far into
the air and the workers into re
treat. A stealthy re-approach re
sulted in the discovery of sev
eral mortars and pestles in addi
tion to the human remnants.
That the skulls were those of
early Indians was announced by
Professor Tolman of the Geology
department after a careful ex
amination. The bones will be re
tained in the department and the
crude utensils will be sent to the
museum.
