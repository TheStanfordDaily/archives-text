# Abas Quartet Charms At Branner Concert
## 
### 
Choosing to charm their audience
with light music rather than with
technique the Abas quartet gave the
first of their three concerts in Bran
ner Hall last night. From the very
first selection, Mozart's Quartet in D
Minor, the group held the interest of
their audience, painting melody pic
tures and drawing exquisite tone
shadings.
The artists reached their fullest
ability, from the audience's point of
view, in their second group which was
composed of two numbers by J.
Speaight, "A Lonely Shepherd," and
"Fuck." The latter was particularly
pleasing in its light, sprightly music
that seemed almost to make Puck live
within the audience, and dance his
elfish dance in unabandoned glee.

The music of the last number, Quar
tet in A Major by Schumann was, like
the first number, a combination of the
various themes of one Quartet, and it
was in this number that the technique
of the quartet was perhaps the most
obviously demonstrated. The quartet
again soared to heights in the last
movement leaving with the audience a
sense of living music and beautifully
shaded tones.
This quartet, composed of Nathan
Abas, William Wolski, Romain Ver
ney, and Michel Penha will give their
next recital in Branner Hall on July 2.
