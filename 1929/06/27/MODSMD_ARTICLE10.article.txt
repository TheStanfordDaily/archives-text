# Athletic Board Plans Five New Swim Pools
## 
### 
Work will start this summer on five
new swimming pools as soon as de
tailed plans are complete and the con
tracts are let. Two of the pools will
be connected with the new women's
gymnasium, one being for classwork
and the other for recreational pur
poses.
The three men's pools will be back
of Encina Gymnasium. One of the
pools will be used for recreation, one
for competition and for classwork,
while the third will be used for diving
and water polo.
A new feature for polo goals has
been devised by Ernie Brandsten,
Stanford swimming coach, eliminating
all overhead braces.
A new shower room will occupy
most of the site of the present pool.
The sand pit will be placed so that
it will be necessary for the divers to
pass through the shower room before
entering the pool. This will prevent
sand getting into the water.
The pools are to be tiled and will
be of regulation size, 75 feet long. A
mechanical chloride distributor will
be installed in each pool, which will
aid the re-circulation process in clari
fying and purifying the water.
