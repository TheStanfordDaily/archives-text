# PALO ALTO HOSPITAL TO BE LOCATED NEAR STANFORD ARBORETUM
## Building to Cost $450,000; To Be of Most Modern Design, Structure 
### 
Of most modern design and struc
tural beauty, the new Palo Alto Hos
pital will be erected in the near future.
The building will be located on a site
donated by the University authorities,
situated along the north edge of the
Arboretum about 1500 feet from the
highway and accessible therefrom by
the road which enters 200 yards north
of Palm Drive.

When complete the hospital and
equipment will cost $450,000 and will
provide Palo Alto with such as few
cities of her size can boast. The build
ing will accommodate one hundred
beds, entirely replacing the old frame
structure now being utilized. The de
plorable condition of the latter first
incited agitation for the new hospital,
and is hard pressed to handle the
cases it receives.
Management by University officials
is provided, and will be of distinct
benefit to the hospital and to the city
of Palo Alto. Any bad effects of politi
cal management are thus avoided, and
there are available as a result of this
management the facilities of the vari
ous science departments of the Uni
versity. Also by placing the buying
facilities of the University at the dis
posal of the hospital the city is en
abled to obtain supplies at a consider
able discount.
