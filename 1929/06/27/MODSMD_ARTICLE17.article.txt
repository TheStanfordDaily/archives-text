plete, Gordon Davis, director of Stan
ford dramatics, pleased with the fine
quality and exceptional variety of
types, last night finished the selection
of players for the campus production
of the well-known Elmer Rice play.
Burnell Gould will act in the diffi
cult role of Mr. Zero, the "apotheosis
of nonentity" around whom the entire
drama is centered. Davis has been
successful in discovering exceptional
types for the twenty-two parts, and,
with such promising material assures
the campus of an excellent production
of this unusual expressionistic play,
the first of its kind ever produced at
Stanford.

Play of Higher Standard
"An unusual treat awaits the cam
pus in 'The Adding Machine,'" says
Davis. "A summer quarter audience is
a more adult group than the average.
The standard of choice in our selec
tion of plays is lifted, and we feel
that we will be followed in cultural
appreciation of the highest standards.
Students in summer school seem to
like a little more thought with their
amusement."
This Elmer Rice drama, which on
July 12 will open the summer program,
is an unusually significant play in the
opinion of critics. The theme of the
drama is that of the predestined wage
slave, and it is presented in an adapta
tion of German expressionism. These
modernistic characteristics should
prove popular with the summer quar
ter audience.
