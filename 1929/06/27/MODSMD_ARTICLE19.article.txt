In the death of Mrs. Ilenry J. Crocker the sick and poor have lost a
warm-hearted benefactor. Stanford in her had a genuine co-operator
in the work it tries to do for these sick and poor. She built the first
considerable addition to the Convalescent Home on the campus as a
memorial to a friend. No woman can have a finer memorial than the
gratitude of little children, and this memorial is Mrs. Crocker's.
