Mr. 8.A.C., we have cursed your name. Mr. 8.A.C., we have de
nounced your policies, execrated your minions, heaped abuse 011 your
bloody head. But now, Mr. 8.A.C., we offer thanks, thanks ten-fold,
thanks a hundred-fold —and with a glimpse at the thermometer, thanks
a thousand-fold.
You are building us a golf course, you have promised a new gym
for the Five Hundred, and today you make public even more: three new
swimming pools.. May the gods of sportdom look smilingly upon you,
and bless you with crowded stadiums and packed pavilions. The women
will have two pools in their new gym. Now the men, who have been
filling their single tank until the water slopped over the edges, will have
three.
Three swimming pools. No longer will paddling swimmers be re
quested to give the water over to speedy varsity swimmers. No longer
will they take the long, dreary road to Searsville when one pool needs a
scouring. No longer will novitates look longingly at 440-yard men
swirling through the water, look longingly—and then take up calisthenics.
These additions to the Stanford athletic plant give promise of in
creased pleasure on warm afternoons like these. They will allow 1111-
iifterrupted instruction of the untrained. They will provide better
accommodation for greater varsity men.
Year after year, Coach Brandsten and his assistants have turned out
Stanford swimming teams that have been of the best, beating down
competition, trampling records and setting higher ones. Each season
Cardinal divers and water poloists have won intercollegiate, national, and
even international honors. And now, Mr. 8.A.C., you have done what
we wholeheartedly commend; you have accorded fitting honor to a
great sport.
