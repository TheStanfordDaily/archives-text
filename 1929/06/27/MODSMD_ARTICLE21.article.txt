# The 						New Trend

### 
In the days when our first higher institutions of learning, Harvard,
William and Mary's, and Yale, were founded, and for many years after
that, the sole purpose of a university was to teach students. At first they
taught merely Latin and Greek and later spread their teaching to other
fields.

Today a university not only teaches, but has many other functions
besides. Take Stanford, for example. In these very first issues of the
Stanford Daily there are articles telling of the building of the new
Palo Alto Hospital on our University's campus, and of the completion of
the Carnegie Institution Laboratory on our property. The United States
Department of Agriculture has an experimental station on Stanford
land, the Palo Alto School of Aviation uses our property, the Palo Alto
Union High and the Mayfield school lease their property from Stanford.
These are just a few of the activities that show the trend of our present
educational institutions. They are interested in these functions and try
to help them.
Formerly a man withdrew from the world for four years when he
entered college. Now he enters an institution that is interested in any
thing that is for the betterment of the world.
