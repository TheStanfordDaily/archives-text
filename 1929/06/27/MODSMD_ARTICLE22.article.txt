Tt has been suggested that the arterial stop at Lasuen and Portola
streets is a hindrance to traffic rather than an aid when Lasuen is shut
off during classes. P>y closing Lasuen street, traffic is diverted into
Portola street. Cars coming in the opposite direction, although on the
main thoroughfare going toward the postoffice and the Row, must stop
on reaching Lasuen street.
It is held that this tends to retard traffic rather than to keep it moving,
inasmuch as both lines of cars must slow down to make the turn. On
the other hand, this may be desirable to prevent tangles when cars parked
south of the library drive out into the traffic. Three lines of cars moving
toward this narrow intersection indeed present possibilities of congestion.
The suggestion for a change is worth consideration. If it is found
that the present stop is advantageous, well and good. But if it is found
that the stop should not be in force when the chains are placed across
Lasuen street, the sign could be removed or covered.
