Mr. Philip Space, that eminently notorious adventurer, returns to
the Daily. I lis sprightly column of incidental observations on fraterni
ties, professors, campus institutions—especially the Cactus Gardens, and
the administration—and his gentle slaps at local celebrities, have won for
the venerable gentleman a place, if not of respect, at least of attention in
the Stanford Daily. And then it's all good clean fun.
