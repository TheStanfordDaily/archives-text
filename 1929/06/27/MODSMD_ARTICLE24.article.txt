Stanford has only three traditions,
says Registrar Mitchell —citing the
limitation of women (how true), the
Honor Code, and the sentiment against
smoking on the Quad.
Tut, tut, Mr. Registrar, have you
forgotten the Hello Spirit?
Hidden away in the cool tomb, the
Administration Building, in which are
buried the hopes of all those who
wanted to take what they wanted
when they wanted it —harried by fond
mothers who want to send their prodi
gies to Stanford —the Registrar may
be forgiven for an error of omission.
Mr. Mitchell is a Stanford man, but
even the best Stanford man might
forget, plunged into the Tombs past
those heavy, face-batting doors that
creak so ominously.

But the Hello Spirit should not be
forgotten—it is the commonest ex
pression of Stanford's ideal of Demo
cracy. "The Winds of Freedom are
Blowing." Dr. Jordan made this the
expression of Stanford spirit. The
breeze, one finds, is pleasantest where
the atmosphere is most friendly.

For the summer student this is par
ticularly important. The Hello Spirit,
practically speaking, is embodied in
the idea of greeting everyone you
meet on the Quad.

Strongest in the days of a smaller
Stanford, the Hello Spirit is still Stan
ford's finest tradition. But it is a bit
dormant during the summer. The rea
son is obvious. New students are not
acquainted with Stanford traditions.
Registrar Mitchell reminded everyone
of three. Let's add the Hello Spirit.

Then there's the custom of grabbing
rides to and from Palo Alto. The street
car folks are good-natured about the
snub, so summer student motorists
will do well also to fall in with the
Hop In tradition.

A few of the old college ideas re
main. There is still the artificial dis
tinction between upper and lower
classmen. Freshmen and sophomores
do not wear cords. Women do not use
the law steps—without applause, at
any rate. The Stanford Rough is still
King at campus functions. There is
no attitude toward those who work,
not even one of respect—they are just
Stanford students. Most of the work
around here is done by students, any
how, and some of the studying.

Freedom of thought, unstandardiza
tion in dress, independence of action
(women please skip), democracy,
friendliness —all are traditions em
bodied in Stanford's realizable ideals.
This is the Stanford Farm. Dude
ranchers will be uncomfortable.

Then there's the custom of grabbing
rides to and from Palo Alto. The street
car folks are good-natured about the
snub, so summer student motorists
will do well also to fall in with the
Hop In tradition.

A few of the old college ideas re
main. There is still the artificial dis
tinction between upper and lower
classmen. Freshmen and sophomores
do not wear cords. Women do not use
the law steps—without applause, at
any rate. The Stanford Rough is still
King at campus functions. There is
no attitude toward those who work,
not even one of respect—they are just
Stanford students. Most of the work
around here is done by students, any
how, and some of the studying.

Freedom of thought, unstandardiza
tion in dress, independence of action
(women please skip), democracy,
friendliness —all are traditions em
bodied in Stanford's realizable ideals.
This is the Stanford Farm. Dude
ranchers will be uncomfortable.

TUT, TUT, MR. REGISTRAR

Stanford has only three traditions,
says Registrar Mitchell —citing the
limitation of women (how true), the
Honor Code, and the sentiment against
smoking on the Quad.
Tut, tut, Mr. Registrar, have you
forgotten the Hello Spirit?
Hidden away in the cool tomb, the
Administration Building, in which are
buried the hopes of all those who
wanted to take what they wanted
when they wanted it —harried by fond
mothers who want to send their prodi
gies to Stanford —the Registrar may
be forgiven for an error of omission.
Mr. Mitchell is a Stanford man, but
even the best Stanford man might
forget, plunged into the Tombs past
those heavy, face-batting doors that
creak so ominously.

But the Hello Spirit should not be
forgotten—it is the commonest ex
pression of Stanford's ideal of Demo
cracy. "The Winds of Freedom are
Blowing." Dr. Jordan made this the
expression of Stanford spirit. The
breeze, one finds, is pleasantest where
the atmosphere is most friendly.

For the summer student this is par
ticularly important. The Hello Spirit,
practically speaking, is embodied in
the idea of greeting everyone you
meet on the Quad.

Strongest in the days of a smaller
Stanford, the Hello Spirit is still Stan
ford's finest tradition. But it is a bit
dormant during the summer. The rea
son is obvious. New students are not
acquainted with Stanford traditions.
