# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### Philip Space 
We certainly didn't think we'd ever
come to this. The summer was going
to be a period of rest and recreation,
unhampered by howls of "copy" and
"you so and so." But it's in the blood
and, besides, the Administration wants
us to stick around this quarter. Not
to conduct this column especially, you
understand, just to stick around —and
incidentally take all the courses that
look like they ought to be required.
This is another one of Stanford's tra
ditions that the Registrar forgot (see
Bull Session).
Today's "Cabbages" will, it begins
to appear, be in the nature of an in
formal chat.
For instance, every new student j
should become acquainted with Stan
ford's famous scenes. This department
is conducting a special tour. The edi
tor will be in charge of the Cactus
Gardens Bureau. Admission will be
by special arrangement with the in
structor. There will be no syllabus
fee, but students are advised to enroll
early in order to make the course in
par. On account of a local ordinance,
no sirens will be allowed on the out
side of cars.
Warning is given that the Cactus
Gardens is no place for the spineless.
Our inevitable co-ed friend, Euphro
nia, thinks that it is going to be a
buss tour.
A second series of excursions will
be made to the strawberry fields.
"W here the Cactus Gardens are nicest
by moonlight, the berry fields are
much better on a dark night—the
darker the better.
It is a great game refuge, but the
last time we were over there we saw
a bird shot —several, in fact.
One should not miss the Study Hall
in the library. This is not to be con
fused with the Steady Hall, which is
near the site of Lagunita, nor the
Unsteady Hall, otherwise known as
Sequoia, which threatens to collapse
when the woodpeckers have to find
some place besides the Women's Gym
to plant acorns.
Freshmen are advised to visit Fra
ternity Row during the summer, since
it is the only time that they will be
safe from kidnapping.
This department, finally, will see to
it that everyone gets a good look at
Hoover's Home for the last time be
fore it is placed in the Stanford Mu
seum for the convenience of visitors.
At the present time it is just one of
the Happy Homes on San Juan Hill.
This move, we understand, has been
O.K'd by the Chief Executive since he
plans to take up a position as Medicine
Ball Man with the New York Y.M.C.A.
when his present job expires. Dr. Wil
bur will be head of the Volleyball De
partment, the position held here by
Dr. Storey.
