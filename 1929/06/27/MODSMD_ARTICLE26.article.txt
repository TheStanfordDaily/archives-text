# EDUCATION INVADED BY GREAT ACTIVITY, COLUMBIA PROFESSOR
## 
### 
"The most striking thing about edu
cation, here and in Europe, is the
feverish activity," said Dr. I. N. Kan- j
del, assistant director of the Institute
of Internatoinal Education, and pro
fessor at Columbia University, in an
address yesterday in the Little Thea
tre.
Dr. Kandel said that the world is
passing through a period of unrest and \
uncertain theories. The war has had |
a great influence, because the war
speeded up attention to this matter,
and brought recognition of the indi
vidual. France, before the war, was
| largely agriculture in character, but
now the population is shifting to the
industrial life of the cities.
Movement Opposed
Because of the uncertain economic j
foundations of the European coun-1
tries, and because, with the exception |
of Russia and Italy, they have no !
guiding philosophy, there does exist j
some acrimony and bitter feeling to
ward this movement. Nevertheless,
the European countries are adopting
the new system of education. In Eng- j
land, for instance, the subject of edu
cation occupied a prominent place in
the platform of all three leading par
ties in the recent election.
This is the beginning of a new era
in educational opportunities, accord

ing to Dr. Kandel. From 1918 to the
present time is the turning point in
the development of education. Funda
mentally the same principls are ack
nowledged everywhere, due to a uni
versally richer conception of demo
cracy.
