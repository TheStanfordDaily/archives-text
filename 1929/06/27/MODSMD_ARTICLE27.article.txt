# STANFORD LEADER IN IMMUNITY RESEARCH SAYS DR. MANWARING
## New Theory Would Change Entire Present System Of Clinical Methods 
### 
That Stanford is the recognized
leader in the United States at the
present time in research on a new
theory of immunology was the state
ment made by Dr. W. H. Manwaring
of the Bacteriology department in an
interview yesterday. Dr. Manwaring
and his staff have been working for
abcut three years on this new theory
which, if established, will revolution
ize the whole system of clinical meth
ods that have existed for over fifty
years.
Proteins Keep Traits
The essence of the new theory is
that various proteins, when taken into
the body as foods or serums, do not
wholly lose their original identity.
"This theory is as yet not estab
lished," said Dr. Manwaring. "Mean
while we must content ourselves with
the following modest conclusion: the
prolonged retention, hybridization,
and semi-permanent symbiosis of exo
genous and endogenous foreign pro
teins and related chemical substances
with human tissues, a basic hypothesis
in primitive clinical medicine, has not
yet been experimentally ruled as a
possible etiological factor in anaphy
laxis, immunity, cancerous growth, de
generative disease, environmental
adaptation, and the hereditary trans
mission of acquired characteristics."
Spoke Before A.A.A.S.
Dr. Manwaring spoke on this sub
ject in its possible relation to the
theory of evolution before the Pacific
Coast meeting of the American Asso
ciation for the Advancement of Sci
ence in Berkeley recently.
He will give a dinner address on
the same topic for the American
Association for the Study of Allergy
in Portland on July 8. This address,
which will be entitled "Immunological
Prophecy from Ancient Hierogly
phics," will also appear in print in
"Science." He will give another ad
dress on the same subject before the
American Medical Association in Port
land on July 12. This will be entitled
"Parental Protein Hybrids and Sym-1
biens." I
