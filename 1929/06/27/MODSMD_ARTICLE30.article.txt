When summer comes students' ap
petites turn to such as orange juice
and lettuce. Stimulating meats and
brain foods are sadly neglected, even
by those diligent searchers after
knowledge who spend their vacation
wandering rather dazedly about the
halls of learning. Consequently the
Cellar shifts its job to ladle out such
delicacies as salads, crispy sand
wiches, and such flavors as mix well
with agitated water.

The first summer that the Cellar
has remained open discloses that
breakfast, with its insistence upon
speed rather than service, is still the
rush period of the day, the big de
mand being the traditional "coffee
and a snail." At noon sandwiches have
their hour, to be followed in student
favor by "cokes," "shakes," and
"sodas."
Women and men agree in the matter
of appetite except that milk is favored
by the fair ones while coffee is the
choice of the virile.
The Cellar is almost exclusively a
student habitat, although during the
summer occasional slightly bewildered
tourists wander in. The new location
of the Roost in the Cellar is gradually
being discovered by the new summer
students, and with the discovery is
growing the traditional popularity of
the place as the reading, gossiping,
congregating point of the campus.
