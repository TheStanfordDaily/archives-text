# POETRY OF EMERALD ISLE NOT MELANCHOLY SAYS PROF. KNOWLTON
## 
### 
"All Irish poetry does not run in
the melancholy trend as Matthew Ar
nold has said. It runs in the happy
moods as well as the sad," said Dr.
Edgar C. Knowlton, visiting professor
of English from Ohio Wesleyan Uni
versity, in a short talk on "Old Irish
Poetry" in the Little Theatre yester
day.
"Very much of Irish poetry deals
with the beauty of nature, and the
wild life of the birds and animals. It
gets very sentimental at times. But
of course it also has its melancholy
sides."
