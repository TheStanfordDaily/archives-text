# REINFORCED CONCRETE MATERIAL FIRST USED IN STANFORD MUSEUM
## Railroad Rails Strengthened Building Against Shocks Of 1906 Quake 
### 
The world's first reinforced concrete
building was the Stanford Museum,
completed in 1893. The museum,
which is strengthened by railroad
rails, withstood the earthquake of
1906 better than any other campus
structure, the mosaics not having to
be replaced as was necessary in the
Memorial Church.

Mrs. Stanford took a personal inter
est in the museum, since it contains
a great variety of objects collected by
the Stanfords in their trips around the
world, as well as gifts from other
donors. Mrs. Stanford visited Tibet,
Egypt, and Japan in her world search
for interesting material.

The articles personally collected by
Leland Stanford, Jr., in whose mem
ory the University was founded, oc
cupy two rooms. The collecting in
stinct was aroused in young Stanford
at the age of eight when his father
gave him a case in which to put his
collections.
The sledge with which Governor
Stanford drove the last spike in the
transcontinental railroad, numerous
paintings and mosaics of the Stan
l'ords, Indian pottery and basketry,
Egyptian mummies and stone tablets,
Byzantine columns of lava, rare books,
and textiles illustrate the variety of
material in the museum.. The Oriental
collection is said to be the best of its
kind. One of the largest objects in
any museum is the locomotive, "Gov
ernor Stanford Number One," the first
passenger engine purchased by the
Central Pacific Railroad. It was ship
ped in parts around Cape Horn to
California.
Newly collected South American In
dian and European material will soon
be on exhibition in the Museum which
is open daily from 10 to 5.
