# BEAUTY OF SOUTHERN SPANISH CITIES SHOWN IN ESPINOSA LECTURE
## 
### 
In a vividly illustrated lecture en
titled, "Cities of Southern Spain,"
given Tuesday evening in the Little
Theatre, Professor Aurelio M. Espi
nosa of the Romanic Languages de
partment, brought to his audience
some of the beauty and grandeur of
Spanish architecture erected before
the sixteenth century.
Professor Espinosa placed special
emphasis on the Arabic element, which
together with the Christian, influ
enced the development of Spanish
architecture between 800 and 1500.
Although the Arabs, coming in 711,
conquered and occupied all of Spain

but the extreme northern part, today
thsre is found Arabic architecture
only in the South. This is due to the
slow growth of Arabic culture which
finally developed in southern Spain.
Professor Espinosa stated that To
ledo, although not a southern city,
was the frontier ground of Christian-
Moorish architecture, which he illus
trated by the mosques which were the
outstanding Moorish architecture in
Spain from 800 to 1200. The Cordova
mosques, featuring horseshoe arches,
dominated by red and blue colorings,
are noted for their grandeur, size, and
illusory effect, and became the mecca
of the Arabs of the Western World, i
The Moors reached the height of
their architectural development at the
end of the fourteenth century. This
later type of Spanish architecture was <
illustrated by a famous Jewish Syna

gogue built in the twelfth century. In
( concluding, Professor Espinosa said
, that this synagogue, which today
stands as a national monument, is the
most beautiful and impressive type of
Arabic architecture in Spain.
