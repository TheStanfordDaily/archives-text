# Dr. Snow Returns To Alma Mater As World Figure In Social Hygiene
## 
### 
Colonel William F. Snow, M.D., gen
eral director of the American Social
Hygiene Association which meets here
today, is one of the truly significant
and justly prominent men graduated
from Stanford University.

Dr. Snow graduated as a classmate
of President Ray Lyman Wilbur in
189 G. While yet a student at Stanford
he was responsible for the organiza
tion of the student guild that con
tinues to be a source of substantial
benefit to Stanford students. He was
professor of Hygiene and Public
Health here, and served California
as State Health Commissioner. In 1915
he became general director of the
American Social Hygiene Association,
and was made chairman of the League
of Nations' committee investigating
traffic in women and children.

Of his work during the World War
Newton D. Baker, then Secretary of
War, says in speaking of him: "The
American army . . . was 'the cleanest,
most temperate, most sane, and least
criminal' body of men of like numbers
known to history. The credit for the
cleanness of that army and its effi
ciency is in part due to the enthusias
tic zeal with which he labored to re
duce disability from vice conditions."
In 1916 Dr. Snow was instrumental
in sending Raymond B. Fosdick to
study hygienic conditions along the
Mexican border. Fosdick says of him,
"Since the war it has been my privi
lege to be associated with Dr. Snow
on the board of the American Social
Hygiene Association, where my rela
tions with him have been intimate.
The same unselfish devotion which he
showed during the war is an insepar
able element in his work, and Stanford
University with her mission of service

to the world can afford to be proud of
one of her noble sons."

David Starr Jordan expressed his
admiration of Dr. Snow when he said,
"He is one of the most useful men
that Stanford has sent out, and few
men who have obtained the promi
nence in public life that he has have
made so little effort to secure public
notice."
The most fitting summary of the
standing of Dr. Snow nationally and
internationally came from the pen of
Dr. Charles W. Eliot, who wrote that
"in regard to Dr. Snow's service, I
believe him to be the most effective
man in the field of public health, not
'one of the most effective.'"

ciency is in part due to the enthusias
tic zeal with which he labored to re
duce disability from vice conditions."
In 1916 Dr. Snow was instrumental
in sending Raymond B. Fosdick to
study hygienic conditions along the
Mexican border. Fosdick says of him,
"Since the war it has been my privi
lege to be associated with Dr. Snow
on the board of the American Social
Hygiene Association, where my rela
tions with him have been intimate.
The same unselfish devotion which he
showed during the war is an insepar
able element in his work, and Stanford
University with her mission of service

to the world can afford to be proud of
one of her noble sons."

Honored by Jordan
David Starr Jordan expressed his
admiration of Dr. Snow when he said,
"He is one of the most useful men
that Stanford has sent out, and few
men who have obtained the promi
nence in public life that he has have
made so little effort to secure public
notice."
The most fitting summary of the
standing of Dr. Snow nationally and
internationally came from the pen of
Dr. Charles W. Eliot, who wrote that
"in regard to Dr. Snow's service, I
believe him to be the most effective
man in the field of public health, not
'one of the most effective.'"
Colonel William F. Snow, M.D., gen
eral director of the American Social
Hygiene Association which meets here
today, is one of the truly significant
and justly prominent men graduated
from Stanford University.

Dr. Snow graduated as a classmate
of President Ray Lyman Wilbur in
189 G. While yet a student at Stanford
he was responsible for the organiza
tion of the student guild that con
tinues to be a source of substantial
benefit to Stanford students. He was
professor of Hygiene and Public
Health here, and served California
as State Health Commissioner. In 1915
he became general director of the
American Social Hygiene Association,
and was made chairman of the League
of Nations' committee investigating
traffic in women and children.
Praised by Baker
Of his work during the World War
Newton D. Baker, then Secretary of
War, says in speaking of him: "The
American army . . . was 'the cleanest,
most temperate, most sane, and least
criminal' body of men of like numbers
known to history. The credit for the
cleanness of that army and its effi
ciency is in part due to the enthusias
tic zeal with which he labored to re
duce disability from vice conditions."
