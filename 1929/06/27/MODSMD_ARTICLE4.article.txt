# ROBLE DANCE TOMORROW IS OPEN TO ALL
## 
### 
Tomorrow night Roble Hall will be
the scene of the first "jolly-up" to be
held on the campus this quarter. This
all-campus open house dance will be
an informal affair and is being given
mainly for the purpose of getting the
students together and giving the new
ones a touch of the social life of the
University.
The reception rooms of the Hall will
be transformed into an inviting dance
flcor, and a good orchestra will pro
vide music. For those not interested
in dancing, tables will be furnished
for cards. Refreshments will be served
during the evening.
This get-together is but one of the
pleasant functions to be held at Roble
Hall this summer, and all registered
students and faculty members are in
vited. The patrons and patronesses
will be Dean Mary Yost, Mrs. Mary
Stearns, and Director Sellards.
Harriet Burroughs is in charge of
the dance and every attempt is being
made to make it an outstanding suc
cess.
