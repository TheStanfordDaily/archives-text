# BOULDER DAM IS VITAL IN STATE FUTURE---WILBUR
## Secretary of Interior Returns From Trip; Explains Importance of Project 
### 
"I have been looking at the future
of California," said Secretary of the
Interior Ray Lyman Wlibur on his re
turn from an official visit to the Boul
der Dam site and the Kettleman Hills
district.

Only a bold stroke such as the con
struction of the Boulder Dam will be
adequate to open up the potentialities
ot' the Southwest. "There are two
things that the Boulder dam will do,"
Dr. Wilbur said. "It will furnish a
water supply to a considerable por
tion of the country; it will furnish a
power supply so that industries can
be developed in this area." He empha
sized the results which may be ex
pelted from the development of an
area mhich has so many possibilities.
To Be Record Dam
"Boulder Dam will be a record high
dam," said Dr. Wilbur. "It will hold
a lake 85 miles long* holding the flow
of the river for 13 months." To con
struct the dam, four tunnels, two on
each side of the river, will have to be
built for drainage. The tunnels will
be fifty feet in diameter, about one
mile long. After the dam is completed,
the two inside tunnels will be used
to supply power to the plants, just
below the dam, while the two outside
will be used for surplus. The construc
tion of two coffer-dams, one above and
one below the dam, will also be neces
sary to keep the work site dry.

"In the Kettleman Hills the ques
tion is whether the gas underground
there shall be burned under boilers
to develop and maintain industry or
whether California's future is blown
off in the air," said Dr. Wilbur. "There
is fuel there to insure the industries
we must have for growth of this part
of the state indefinitely, but wild,
short-sighted competition to get it out
of the ground means only indefensible
waste.
"We didn't go down there to get
cold," was Dr. Wilbur's comment on
his recent trip. He intends to leave
the campus Friday on his inspection
of the Northwest. He expects to reach
Washington, D.C., about the middle of
July.
