### 
Saturday morning at 8 o'clock a
seven-car caravan of student and fac
ulty excursionists under the direction
of Senorita Perez of the Romanic Lan
guages department will depart for the
coast and Santa Cruz.

Director Sellards, Room 173 of the Ad
ministration building. Meals en route
being left to the discretion of the in
dividual, the fee will be only three

Trip of Historic Interest
The historic and scenic values of
the trip will be of unusual interest to
those unfamiliar with the region. The
'route will lead south through the cen
i ter of Santa Clara Valley, famous
fruit-growing and canning region.
! Ascending from the valley floor at the
mouth of the Santa Cruz canyon, the
road will pass through Los Gatos.
Santa Cruz Is Goal
Santa Cruz, the goal of the excur-
Sibnists, is in itself a spot of beauty

and of historic interest. A visitor's
impression of the resort is given best
by the Rev. George O'Connell, famous
writer of California history, in reac
tion to his first visit there. He terms
Santa Cruz as . . one of the love
liest seaside resorts in the world.
From noble Ben Lomond on the north
west, six miles away, and many an
other mountain cleft with precipitous
canyons and covered with monster
redwood trees, to its hills, its teeming
orchards and vineyards, its forests of
oak and madrone, and at its feet the
incomparable bay of Monterey, its at
tractions are wellnigh numberless."
The town of Santa Cruz is another
of the sites of early California mis
sions. Though a hostile tribe of In
dians of Asiatic cast of countenance
and with a civilization lower than any
found on the American continent, in
habited this beautiful cove, the relent
less churchmen entered and extended
their conversion to the region. On the
morning of August 28, 1791, Father
Junipero Serra and his handful of fol
lowers erected the first cross to mark
the founding of a settlement.

The town of Santa Cruz is another
of the sites of early California mis
sions. Though a hostile tribe of In
dians of Asiatic cast of countenance
and with a civilization lower than any
found on the American continent, in
habited this beautiful cove, the relent

their conversion to the region. On the
morning of August 28, 1791, Father
Junipero Serra and his handful of fol

the founding of a settlement.

Trip of Historic Interest
The historic and scenic values of
the trip will be of unusual interest to
those unfamiliar with the region. The
'route will lead south through the cen
i ter of Santa Clara Valley, famous
fruit-growing and canning region.
! Ascending from the valley floor at the
mouth of the Santa Cruz canyon, the
road will pass through Los Gatos.
Santa Cruz Is Goal
Santa Cruz, the goal of the excur-
Sibnists, is in itself a spot of beauty

and of historic interest. A visitor's
impression of the resort is given best
by the Rev. George O'Connell, famous
writer of California history, in reac
tion to his first visit there. He terms
Santa Cruz as . . one of the love
liest seaside resorts in the world.
From noble Ben Lomond on the north
