# KELLOGG TREATY ENDANGERED BY JAPAN POLITICS
## Ichihashi Reveals Fight of Nippon Conservatives as Pact Ratification Looms Phrase, Thought Insignificant, Basis of Protest; Power Of Emperor Causes Trouble 
### 
While Japanese politics almost up
set the Kellogg-Briand anti-war pact,
Dr. Yamato Ichihashi, associate
professor of history at Stanford, be
lieves that the furor resulting from
use of the apparently insignificant
phrase—"in the name of the people"—
was unnecessary since the people of
Japan wished the treaty ratified, and
since many of the Japanese diplomats
wish the phrase—"in the name of the
people"—to be a fact in Japan as well
as in republics which signed the pact.

This apparently insignificant phrase
was used by the opposition in the
Privy Council as a reason for claim
ing that the pact was unconstitutional.
Japan's sovereignty is vested in the
Emperor, they claimed, not in the peo
ple. Professor Ichihashi says that the
Privy Council of Japan is made up of
men who are all retired from some
government position. They are, there
fore, older and more conservative men
than those of the Foreign Office.
Following Usual Custom
Count Uchida, a former member of
the Privy Council, former Minister of
Foreign Affairs, and former Ambas
sador to the United States, was ap
pointed by the Japanese government
to attend the anti-war conference. He
followed the usual custom of Japanese
diplomacy in sending to the executives
of the government the movements of
the conference, and had their official
sanction before he signed the docu
ment. Professor Ichihashi further ex
plained that men of the Foreign Office,
and the Naval Officers have had a
great deal of opportunity to come in
contact with, and get the point of view
of the occidental and occidental gov
ernment while some members of the
Privy Council have not had that op
portunity, and still feel that the power
should rest with the Emperor, and
not be delegated to the people.
Count Ushida, a former member of
flee were not confronted with the sig
nificance of the phrase until the pact
and its signature went before the
Privy Council. Count Ushida resigned
from the Privy Council as a result of
the furor, and Professor Ichihashi of
fers the speculation that it will result
in the downfall of the present Japa
nese Cabinet, and the present faction
in control.
Japan Fifteenth to Sign
The Privy Council sent the pact to
the Emperor on June 26 with advice
that he approve the signature. Em
peror Hirohito approved the ratifica
tion on Jihie 27.
Japan has, according to Professor
Ichihashi, made a sacrifice in setting
aside her ideals of government for
the furthering of world peace.
