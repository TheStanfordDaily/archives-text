# DAVIS CHANGES CAST OF "ADDING MACHINE" AS REHEARSALS BEGIN
## Howard Addleston to Take Role of "Shrdlu‚Äù in Place of Bissell 
### 
Several changes have been made in
the cast of the Elmer Rice play, "The
Adding Machine." Gordon Davis, di
rector of dramatics, announced last
night that readjustments are com
pleted and that the cast is settling
down to earnest and concentrated
work on the first expressionistic
drama ever produced on the Stanford
stage.
Howard Addleston will replace
Dwight Bissell as "Shrdlu," and Virgil
Anderson will fill Addleston's former
place as "A Head." The role of "Lieu
teiiant Charles" will be assumed by
Byron Snow instead of by Bates Booth.
L. G. Harvey will act as "A Police
man," a new part.
Gould in Fifth Play
The members of the cast are not
only well adapted to their roles but
are also unusually experienced in the
field of dramatics. Burnell Gould, who
plays the part of Mr. Zero, a very ordi
nary man with suppressed desires, is
the moving force of the play. His five
previous appearances in campus pro
ductions give him the support of a
variety of experience. Until this play
he has been featured in character
parts such as Ezra, the Constable, in
"The Haunted House," as Don Juan in
"The Romantic Young Lady," and as
Old Ekdal in "The Wild Duck." In the
"Football Gaieties" he will be remem
bered for his radio skit, and the
"Theatre Fund Follies" for several
comedy parts.

Gould in Fifth Play
The members of the cast are not
only well adapted to their roles but
are also unusually experienced in the
field of dramatics. Burnell Gould, who
plays the part of Mr. Zero, a very ordi
nary man with suppressed desires, is
the moving force of the play. His five
previous appearances in campus pro
ductions give him the support of a
variety of experience. Until this play
he has been featured in character
parts such as Ezra, the Constable, in
"The Haunted House," as Don Juan in
"The Romantic Young Lady," and as
Old Ekdal in "The Wild Duck." In the
"Football Gaieties" he will be remem
bered for his radio skit, and the
"Theatre Fund Follies" for several
comedy parts.
