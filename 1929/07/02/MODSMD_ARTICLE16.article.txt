Comes the word that Stanford's bacteriology laboratories are rapidly
winning world recognition for research in immunity. It is gratifying to
learn that the University which has built up one of the outstanding
medical schools in the country is developing an equally prominent de
partment in a more specialized science.
Handicapped from the first by numerous difficulties, of which lack
of funds and equipment is the most striking, the men in the bacteriology
laboratories are striving to build a department which will be known not
only for its courses in instruction, but for the results of its research.
International honors have already been accorded outstanding men at
the medical school in San Francisco. Such figures as Hanzlik in pharma
cology, Bloomfield in general medicine, and Ophuls in pathology are
already leaders in the world of science.
And now come three men in bacteriology. Dickson, now turning his
hand to public health, has been termed the recognized authority on
botulinus poisoning. Manwaring, an expert in anaphylaxis, in sixteen
years has become one of America's leading workers in immunology.
Jungeblut leaves for Columbia in September to continue his investiga
tions on infantile paralysis.
What these men have done is but an indication of what can be
accomplished when even passable facilities are provided. The search for
the cause and cure of man's many ailments is a costly one, costly in men
and in laboratories, assistants, apparatus, instruments, experimental
animals. When the barriers provided by these heavy expenses are sur
mounted, then the men can exercise their full abilities to give Stanford
the leadership in bacteriological research.
