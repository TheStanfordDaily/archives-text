Few if any of Stanford's record-breaking summer colony seemed to
be missing from the first jolly-up of the quarter. The affair deserves
bountiful commendation as, for example, a big success, and a good time
was had bv all.

Hardened stags viewing new arrivals with no little surprise and
much pleasure. Fair visitors astonished by the appearance of the campus
male with cords and beard noticeably lacking. Dubious freshmen slightly
perturbed by the formal informality of the entire evening. An imposing
evening, no doubt.
That the event achieved its goal cannot be questioned. New contacts,
the purpose of the gathering, were undoubtedly made, and those who
attempted dancing in <fhe two crowded ballrooms will swear that the
contacts were close ones.
Some day we shall hunt out those unknown goddesses of Roble who
so graciusly welcomed us and very humbly ask for another spacious room
or two to be given over to the more vigorous entertainment. We really
must. Our new shoes are absolutely wrecked.
