The Stanford rough has almost been obliterated. With the influx
of new students for the summer, the student of previous quarters finds
himself comparable to the man without a country, except that he is in
his native land, but it doesn't belong to him.
"So you're from Washington? I'm from Texas myself. Now, down
in Texas we do so and so," and there follows an exchange of experiences
and perhaps of impressions of Stanford. Over in the corner, the Stan
ford man sits with his mouth full of teeth, usually unable to add anything
to the conversation. He's merely a fixture on the campus.
In the eating clubs, in the Cellar, and in the informal bull-sessions
on the Quad steps, this condition prevails. Seemingly, newcomers would
rather exchange pleasantries with some other newcomer with whom they
feel they have something in common than with a year-round student.
This applies even to locating places around the campus or vicinity, it
apparently being more fun to look for a place with a new acquaintance
from another state than to ask a veteran Stanford student where it is.

Organizations of students who come from the same locality or the
same state have never been a feature of summer quarter at Stanford.
We would rather have the entire student body be one family. Let the
students of previous quarters be congenial and willing to help in locating
places for those unfamiliar with Stanford. And let newcomers forget
their homes.

It's not that there is any seething storm lurking beneath the peaceful
exterior of the campus. It's not that there are a multitude of unnoticed
beauteous flowers growing without the Daily's illumination. But where
some fourteen hundred humans gather together, live together, eat to
gether, snooze noiselessly together in 10 o'clock lectures—and they do
all of that at Stanford—why, then, there must be something that each of
the fourteen hundred would someday like to get off his or her chest.
Therefore, with a desire to maintain perfect peace and contentment,
the Daily throws open its Campus Opinion column, scarred and battered
from healthy battles of the past.
Communications, so long as they be short, will be welcome guests at
Box 3014. Mail them in, and specify a nomine de guerre (taken from
the French) if you don't want your own name printed. But sign them
anyhow—even if only to satisfy our own curiosity.

their homes.

It's not that there is any seething storm lurking beneath the peaceful
exterior of the campus. It's not that there are a multitude of unnoticed
beauteous flowers growing without the Daily's illumination. But where
some fourteen hundred humans gather together, live together, eat to
gether, snooze noiselessly together in 10 o'clock lectures—and they do
all of that at Stanford—why, then, there must be something that each of
the fourteen hundred would someday like to get off his or her chest.
Therefore, with a desire to maintain perfect peace and contentment,
the Daily throws open its Campus Opinion column, scarred and battered
from healthy battles of the past.
Communications, so long as they be short, will be welcome guests at
Box 3014. Mail them in, and specify a nomine de guerre (taken from
the French) if you don't want your own name printed. But sign them
anyhow—even if only to satisfy our own curiosity.
The Stanford rough has almost been obliterated. With the influx
of new students for the summer, the student of previous quarters finds
himself comparable to the man without a country, except that he is in
his native land, but it doesn't belong to him.
"So you're from Washington? I'm from Texas myself. Now, down
in Texas we do so and so," and there follows an exchange of experiences
and perhaps of impressions of Stanford. Over in the corner, the Stan
ford man sits with his mouth full of teeth, usually unable to add anything
to the conversation. He's merely a fixture on the campus.
In the eating clubs, in the Cellar, and in the informal bull-sessions
on the Quad steps, this condition prevails. Seemingly, newcomers would
rather exchange pleasantries with some other newcomer with whom they
feel they have something in common than with a year-round student.
This applies even to locating places around the campus or vicinity, it
apparently being more fun to look for a place with a new acquaintance
from another state than to ask a veteran Stanford student where it is.

Organizations of students who come from the same locality or the
same state have never been a feature of summer quarter at Stanford.
We would rather have the entire student body be one family. Let the
students of previous quarters be congenial and willing to help in locating
places for those unfamiliar with Stanford. And let newcomers forget
their homes.
