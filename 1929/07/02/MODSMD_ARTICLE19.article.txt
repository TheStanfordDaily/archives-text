Bernardino Molinari, tempestuous
conductor of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, gave his second and
concluding concert at the Woodland
Theatre in Hillsborough last Sunday
before a highly appreciative audience.
Henri Deering, young American art
ist, appearing as guest pianist with
the orchestra, won much of the ap
plause with his presentation of Cesar
Franck's Symphonic Variations, for
piano and orchestra. The deft mould
ing of the variant verses flowed
subtley into a bright, sparkling con
clusion.
The succession of minuet move
ments of Handel's Concerto Grosso,
No. 10, with the added appeal of an
extended passage for the violin, opened
Molinari's program. After an inter
mission came the prelude to The Af
ternoon of a Faun. Debussy's im
pressionistic number, less familiar,
perhaps, than his earlier and more
typical works, the Blessed Damozel

and Three Nocturnes, imposed an at
mosphere of light and color, of eman
cipation from "scientific apparatus."
Rising to eerie, tempestuous heights,
Moussorgsky's "A Night on the Bald
Mountain" was the most striking num
ber on the program. The crashing, de
moniac music of the legendary dance
of the black god Tchernobog bears the
mark, not only of Wagner's Valhall
music, but of the chaotic whirl, the
uncanny Slavic quality of Rimsky-
Korsakov.
As a concluding number to his stay
at the rustic bowl, Molinari thrilled
his audience with the delicious im
petuosity of Dukas' "The Sorcer's Ap
prentice."
The concert for next Sunday will
be conducted by the inimitable Alfred
Hertz, San Francisco's own symphony
leader. This will be the only time
that Hertz will appear at Hillsborough
this season.
