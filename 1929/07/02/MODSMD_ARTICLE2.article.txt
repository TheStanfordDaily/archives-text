# Sex Education In Colleges Backed By Dr. W.F. Snow
## Stanford Graduate Speaks At Campus Meeting of Social Hygienists 
### 
Sex education in schools is essen
tial. Collective citizen action aimed
against commercialized vice, and the
promotion, of character building
agencies will provide training for suc
cessful married life. These were the
conclusions reached by Dr. William
Freeman Snow, '96, in his address be
fore the American Social Hygiene As
sociation at its informal meeting here
last Thursday.

The morning session was addressed
by Miss Jean B. Pinney and Dr. Max
J. Exner. The former spoke on the
relation of sex hygiene to community
betterment. She stated that the pro
priety of sex education in the schools
was being accepted by the public. Al
ready there are 202 colleges co-operat
ing in the movement to put courses in
sex study among educational facili
ties.

Dr. Exner spoke on "The Progress
of Sex Education." He pointed out that
the aim of sex education was not
merely to curb immorality, "but to
bring to the individual the best knowl
edge and most powerful incentives
for right-living that are available."
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, professor of
hygiene and physical education at
Stanford, opened the afternoon ses
sion by introducing Edward L. Keyes,
M.D., president of the association. Dr.
Keyes told a little of the work and
nature of the organization, and sug
gested the need for practical sex edu
cation.
He was followed by Dr. Snow, gen
eral director of the association, and
the man who is responsible more than
any other for the work done in con
trolling social diseases in America.
Dr. Snow did not speak, as was ex
pected, on the subject of "Traffic in
Women and Children." He talked for
awhile upon his experiences here at
Stanford, and then told of the objects
and accomplishments of the society.
He stressed the necessity of educat
ing the public without frightening it,
and declared that the most effectual
means is to promote understanding.
