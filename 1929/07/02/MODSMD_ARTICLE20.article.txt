# GREAT FUTURE FOR CHINA FORETOLD BY SECRETARY WILBUR
## 
### 
The Pacific Ocean is no longer to
be considered a barrier between
America and the Orient, said Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary
of the Interior, in a speech before the
National Conference of Social Work
last Friday evening at the San Fran
cisco Civic Auditorium.

That great expanse is becoming
narrower, he continued, if not in ac
tuality at least through the growing
spirit of friendship and co-operation
which exists between the countries
which border upon it. He foretold of
a great future for China and the
Philippines, and asked the sympathy
and co-operation of Americans. His
appeal was made more to the altruism
and good will of his listeners than to
their pocketbooks.
Dr. John S. Burgess of Yenching
University, Pekin, China, also spoke
at the meeting.
