# PROFESSOR DUNIWAY DEPLORES 500 LIMIT: LIMITATION OF LOWER DIVISION WINS PRAISE
## Believes Increase Is in Line With Other Stanford Improvements 
### 
"The limitation of the number of
Stanford women to five hundred is
indeed unfortunate," is the opinion of
Professor Clyde A. Duniway, President
of Carleton College and visiting pro
fessor this summer in the history de
partment.
"In view of the numerous advanc
ing steps which the University has
taken in respect to the limitation of
the Lower Division and in the build
ing up of the various departments in
the University, it is deplorable that
the number of Stanford women can
not be increased," continued Professor
Duniway, who recognizes Stanford as
a university whose objective is to be
a first-rate pre-professional and pro
fessional university rather than an
ordinary American college.
Impressed by Growth

Professor Duniway, who was a pro
fessor of American History at Stan
ford from 1897 until 1908, when he
left to become president of Montana
University, says that he is impressed
by the great expansion and progress
that has taken place at Stanford, espe
cially in respect to the great develop
ment of the attractive residential sec
tion of the University, the advances
that are being made in the medical
school, and the progress in Food Re
search Institute work.
Will Help Stanford
In commending Dr. Wilbur on his
action in regard to the reduction of
the Lower Division, President Duni
way says he believes that there are
only a few other colleges in the United
States that are able to take such a
step now. He also believes that this
action is not only a far-sighted step
on the part of Dr. Wilbur and the
board of trustees, but that it will aid j
Stanford greatly in attaining its proper
place in the university world.
Besides being president of Carleton
College and having served as presi
dent at Montana, Professor Duniway [
has been president of the University ,
of Wyoming and of Colorado College. |
