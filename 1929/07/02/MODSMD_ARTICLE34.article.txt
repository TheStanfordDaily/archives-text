# GOD NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR EVIL SAYS BISHOP MORELAND IN SERMON
## 
### 
God should not be held responsible
for the evil in the world was the theme
of the sermon given by the Right
Reverend William Hall Moreland,
Bishop of Sacramento, in the Memorial
Church Sunday morning.
"The Creator would not destroy his
own work," said Bishop Moreland. A
painter would not tear down his work
after he had finished it.
Bishop Moreland does not accept
for his personal opinion either the ex
planation of evil as a force combat
ting good or as an unreality existing
only in our thoughts. He believes that
evil is the domination of materialism

that shuts out the light of the good
and beauty of God.
In an interview the Bishop said that
the effect of tabloids is not the only
element instrumental in the spread
of evil. Publications opposing the ad
vances of those sciences which have
enabled us to lift ourself from the
plagues of the Middle Ages, are as
detrimental as the sensational types
of journalism.
"God hates disease for the same
reason that an inventor would oppose
any element which would tend to crip
ple his invention," said Bishop More
land in his sermon.
Madell Gille Allen, soprano, and
Esther Houk Allen, contralto, sang
"The Lord Is My Shepherd."
