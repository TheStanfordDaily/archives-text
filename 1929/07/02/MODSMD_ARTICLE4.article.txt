# WINGED 'O' MEN FAVORED TO WIN AT A. A. U. MEET
## Chances of Olympic Club Boosted by Presence Of Card Athletes 
### 
Containing the names of 250 of the
country's best athletes, the list for
the National A.A.U. junior and senior
track and field championships closed
last night. The contests will be held
in Denver tomorrow, Thursday, and
Friday.
"Smiling Charlie" Hunter, Olympic
Club track and field coach, is optimis
tic concerning the possibilities of an
other championship for the Pacific
Coast.
"I think we can win," said Hunter.
"All sorts of reports are coming from
Chicago about the wonderful Illinois
Athletic Club team, and its eight for
mer Olympic Games men, but believe
me, the struggle for the title will be
between the Olympics and the Los An
geles Athletic Club. I think we can
nose out Cromwell's men."
Olympic Clubs Figures 36 Points
An Olympian victory is possible,
thinks Hunter, figuring 36 points for
his club. The Los Angeles Athletic
Club, with 35 members, is expected to
score approximately the same number
of points as the Olympic Club. Since
35 to 40 points has been enough to
win, a coast team should take the
meet. The Olympic Club is favored
because of its list of Stanford stars,
Ward Edmonds, Eric Krenz, Harlow
Rothert, Kim Dyer, Casey Kazanjian,
and Bill Storie.

Official notification to athletes of
the Pacific Coast that they will not be
allowed the use of Coach Dink Tem
pleton's starting blocks, was received
from Daniel J. Ferris, secretary-treas
urer of the Amateur Athletic Union.
Seven 9:3-5 Entries
The 100- and 220-yard dash events
in the senior division, carrying para
mount importance because of the
thoroughly representative field, will
have fourteen entrants. Seven of
these have equalled or unofficially
bettered the accepted mark of 9 3-5
seconds for the century. They are
Russell Sweet, Olympic Club, San
Francisco; Claude Bracey, Rice Insti
tute; Cy Leland, Texas Christian Uni
versity; Eddie Toland, University of
Michigan; George Simpson, Ohio
State, and Frank Wykoff and Charley

Seven 9:3-5 Entries
The 100- and 220-yard dash events
in the senior division, carrying para
mount importance because of the
thoroughly representative field, will
have fourteen entrants. Seven of
these have equalled or unofficially
bettered the accepted mark of 9 3-5
seconds for the century. They are
Russell Sweet, Olympic Club, San
Francisco; Claude Bracey, Rice Insti
tute; Cy Leland, Texas Christian Uni
versity; Eddie Toland, University of
Michigan; George Simpson, Ohio
State, and Frank Wykoff and Charley
Paddock, representing the Los An
geles Athletic Club.
Containing the names of 250 of the
country's best athletes, the list for
the National A.A.U. junior and senior
track and field championships closed
last night. The contests will be held
in Denver tomorrow, Thursday, and
Friday.
"Smiling Charlie" Hunter, Olympic
Club track and field coach, is optimis
tic concerning the possibilities of an
other championship for the Pacific
Coast.
"I think we can win," said Hunter.
"All sorts of reports are coming from
Chicago about the wonderful Illinois
Athletic Club team, and its eight for
mer Olympic Games men, but believe
me, the struggle for the title will be
between the Olympics and the Los An
geles Athletic Club. I think we can
nose out Cromwell's men."
Olympic Clubs Figures 36 Points
An Olympian victory is possible,
thinks Hunter, figuring 36 points for
his club. The Los Angeles Athletic
Club, with 35 members, is expected to
score approximately the same number
of points as the Olympic Club. Since
35 to 40 points has been enough to
win, a coast team should take the
meet. The Olympic Club is favored
because of its list of Stanford stars,
Ward Edmonds, Eric Krenz, Harlow
Rothert, Kim Dyer, Casey Kazanjian,
and Bill Storie.

Official notification to athletes of
the Pacific Coast that they will not be
allowed the use of Coach Dink Tem
pleton's starting blocks, was received
from Daniel J. Ferris, secretary-treas
urer of the Amateur Athletic Union.
