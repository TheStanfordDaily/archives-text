Made State Park
The Big Basin or the California
Redwood Park is in the Santa Cruz
Mountains, and is one of the great
historic spots of California. Part of
the tract was purchased by the state
to save the redwoods from destruc
tion by sawmill or fire. The geological
structure of the area is complex and
unusual, and if only for this reason

the trip would be worth taking. But
the geological interest is perhaps sec
ondary to the ancient redwood trees
which still stand in their natural sur
roundings. The underbrush has been
cleared away to enable tourists to
enjoy this primeval forest, with its
many waterfalls, streams, and some
of the more rare plant and bird life.
Road Into Basin Improved
The trip into the Basin will be
made over the improved road leading
from Saratoga Springs which was re
cently opened after being closed to
travel for some months while exten
sive repairs were being made. The
worst grades have been eliminated
and the road has been widened and
straightened until it is one of the
safest scenic roads in the state.
Those who make the trip may es
cape the heat in the outdoor swim
ming pool sheltered from the sun by
immense redwood trees.
