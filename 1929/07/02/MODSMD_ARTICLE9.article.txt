### 
Ruth Lansburgh, '29, announced her
engagement to Harold Helvenston at
a tea given last Sunday at the Hotcli
kias home here on the campus. The
tea was given ostensibly in honor of
the twenty-first wedding anniversary
of Mr. and Mrs. G. A. Lansburgh, and
the announcement came as a distinct
surprise.
Miss Lansburgh is a member of
Roble Club and Cap and Gown, and
served on Women's Council and as a
sponsor. She has also been prominent
in campus dramatics and is noted as
a horsewoman and swimmer. Helven
ston came to Stanford from Yale last
year to assist Gordon Davis as tech
nical director of dramatics. He is a
member of Sword and Sandals and
of Hammer and Coffin, and has been
prominent in literary activities here.
