# AUTHORITY ON MIDDLE AGES TO GIVE TALK
## 
### 
Father George Lacombe, who has
just returned from Paris, bringing
with him much valuable material
from his own investigation of me
dieval thought, will talk in the Little
Theatre tomorrow afternoon at 4:15.
His subject will be "The Contribu
tion of the International Union of
Academies to Medieval Research
Work."
Awarded his Ph.D. degree at Stan
ford in 1922, Father Lacombe has been
carrying on his research work at the
Union International d'Academies in
Paris. He is a scholar and specialist
in medieval matters and has published
two articles in this held.
These articles appeared in the Feb
ruary and March issues of the Com
monweal under the title, "What Were
the Middle Ages?" The editors of the
Commonweal pointed out that "schol
ars are digging out facts about the
Gothic centuries and have restored at
least the outlines of medieval
thought." Their comment on La
combe's articles gave proof of his
accuracy and thoroughness of investi
gation when the editors declared the
articles a "careful and authoritative
exposition of what has been accom
plished."
