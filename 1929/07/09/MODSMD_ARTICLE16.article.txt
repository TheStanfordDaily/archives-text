With the production of "The Adding
Machine" but a few days away, Gor
don Davis has made an important
change in the cast. Tom Henry was
called from Los Angeles and will re
place Byron Snow as Lieutenant
Charles, the character who has the
important function of delivering the
author's message—the ironic theme of
the play. The part is one which re
quires experience and technical com
mand.
Successfully carrying the leads in
three campus productions during the
past year, Henry has the necessary
qualifications and experience for such
a difficult role. He was particularly
conspicuous as Iljalmar Ekdal in "The
Wild Duck." In the Junior Opera,
"Moving On," he was the lion tamer,
and in the sophomore play, "The
Haunted House," he played the author.
Rice Play Powerful
The past week has seen the cast
hard at work on the production which
is rapidly swinging into perfection.
This modern expressionistic play by
Elmer Rice is an unusually dynamic
and powerful drama which should
please its summer quarter audience.
The highly stylized sets designed
by Harold Helvenston, technical di
rector, and executed by Theatre Work
shop classes, are nearing completion.
The play demands a variety of scenes
and Helvenston has suggested in the
sets the grim and sardonic humor of
the play itself. Sacrificing realism, he
has planned the seven scenes with
extreme simplicity, with the express
purpose of creating the desired atmos
phere and conveying the theme of the
play. Light will be used as one of the
principal means for effect.
Scenes Varied
The motif of "The Adding Machine,"
symbolizing Mr. Zero's place in life,
is suggested throughout the sets.
"The first scene, the bedroom of Mr.
and Mrs. Zero, suggests squalor and

contortion of circumstances," says
Helvenston. Two of the most striking
scenes are of a graveyard at night
and the scene called "A Pleasant
Place," which is a modernistic con
ception of the hereafter. The setting
for the last act is also in the world
beyond, a glorified office —"the ship
ping department of the soul factory."
