"Through the summer, students are advised to ... . allow a rea
sonable time of freedom in which to profit by the many opportunities
for general culture and healthful recreation. '
"It is hoped that students will take advantage of the recreational
opportunities offered and will carry away with them the memory of an
enjoyable summer at Stanford."
So speaks the Administration. So speak those who sincerely desire
that a memory of an enjoyable quarter be retained by guests on the
campus. Yet today "A Perturbed Senior" and "A Visiting Student"
voice a protest, heard many times before, on the bonds that grimly re
strict the goings and comings of Stanford women.
Heaven spare one from making rules on women's conduct. And
Heaven knows that some rules are necessary. Whether they will or no,
Stanford women determine to a large extent the public's view of the
University. And then, freshman women, newly arrived, ready for their
first burst of freedom, must be toned down a bit until they learn not to
take their freedom in too large gulps.
One would think that juniors and seniors in Roble could step out of
the hall doorway after the forbidding hour of 10:30 occasionally during
the quarter. One would think that teachers, special students, scholarly
matrons could—
But no, Visiting Student, you can term Roble's system of late leaves
ridiculous, absurd, preposterous, silly, unreasonable, anything you want.
But it won't do any good. It never has done any.
You and Perturbed Senior are at Stanford to take advantage of our
recreational opportunities, you see, and they stop promptly at 10:30.
If you arc a good little girl, maybe Mrs. Roble will let you stay out for
an hour later a few times. Four, to be exact. And after that time, you
must go to your room and acquire culture. That means, you'll soon dis
cover, getting ten hours of sleep instead of nine.
The Mission at Carmel, the beaches at Santa Cruz, the theatres of
San Jose, and the shows and dances of San Francisco have absolutely
no value in summer —after 10:30.
