Stanford is rapidly changing from an institution with sports the
year round to one with each sport taking a good twelve months of each
year. The star athlete who divided his time between the four or five or
six major activities is giving way to the one who gives all his time to one.
Track is no longer a spring recreation. Cardinal champions, after an
autumn of training, spend the winter in indoor meets, and the spring and
summer in outdoor competition. Football men, not content with games
in fall and winter, and practice in spring, give all summer to the
"hardening-up" process.
Baseball, as does basketball, requires six months for practice, and six
for intercollegiate and club games.
From all over the country come reports of varsity swimmers who top
off a winter of work-outs and a spring of competition with a summer of
championship races. Stanford tennis players finish their winter and spring
of team play with a tour of innumerable eastern and middle-western
tournaments throughout the summer.
What will be the end of all this? Will Stanford, with other institu
tions of scholastic purpose, be forced to turn over a considerable part of
its plant to teaching men how to play the year long, play for money as
well as for pleasure? Athletics today are drawing more and more in
terest, demanding more and more accommodations. The slogan of "fight
for dear ol' Siwash" is rapidly vanishing. What will take its place?
"How much can T make in the Big Leagues?"
Jobs on a college campus and in college towns are held out beseech
ingly to men wearing block X's on their sweaters, men who will be the
mainstay of the Siwash fighting eleven next fall. Pipe courses arc in
the curriculum, offering little difficulty to crack milers to stay in college.
And the Big Ten is not the only conference that has found the problem
of proselytizing in its midst. How many colleges and universities 111
America can show a clean slate in this respect?
Amateur sports is coming perilously close to being one of this era's
greatest commercial institutions.
