Gordon Davis has his first play of the summer season simmering
nicely, ready for serving Friday night. Just what the play is about, or
when it was written, or who censored it, or what evangelical society
praised it to the skies, we know not. If Davis produces it, it must be
good.
We remember last summer, when each of his three plays drew packed
houses, and one demanded an encore. We remember last summer, when
we got to one of those one o'clock scat sales an hour late, and got tickets
in Row V.

That's what we get for being friendly, and trying to give advice.
Now that we've dared mention it, we'll undoubtedly get located in Row
XX—don't they go that far back? —and be termed negligent by the
roomatc. We always did cut our own throat.
