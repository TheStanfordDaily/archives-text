The Editor, Sir:
Why should all women living at
Roble this summer be made to suffer
under a regulation that only freshman
and sophomore women observe during
the other quarters of the year?
It seems ridiculous that these sum
mer students be restricted to four
mid-week late leaves for the entire
quarter because a little trouble is
necessary to determine the academic
status of some of the women. This
slight effort that would lead to such
fuller satisfaction of the women seems
I too much for those who are in a posi
tion to expend it.
To inflict a system as rigid as this
one on a great many women who have
been allowed many more privileges
here during other quarters, as well
as on those who have been entirely
independent of institutional control of
any kind throughout the year is cer
tainly absurd.
Why should not the majority rule
in this case as in others? Certainly
freshman and sophomore women are

not in the majority at Roble this sum
mer.

The Editor, Sir:
As a senior and a woman student —
the significance of the latter will be
apparent to any Stanford habitu6 —I
now raise my voice in protest against
the latest bit of protective legisla
tion, namely the question of the cur
tailment of late leaves. The number
allotted to a senior women in other
quarters is eight. Summer quarter au
thorities have reduced that number
to four for the one simple reason that
it is too difficult for them to deter
mine the status of the women in Roble,
i.e., freshman, sophomore, etc.

Four late leaves for all four classes
benefits one class only, the freshman,
and deprives the juniors and seniors
of two and four late leaves. Just what
sort of student government have we
when such a measure can be passed
without the vote of any of the stu
dents?
—A Perturbed Senior.
