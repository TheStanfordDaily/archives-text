Conductor Alfred Hertz and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra pre
sented an unusual and interesting
program at the third of the Woodland
Theatre concerts on Sunday last, and
an enthusiastic audience was present
to greet the popular orchestra leader
The overture to Richard Wagner's
great opera, "Tannhauser," formed
the opening number of the concert.
Its interweaving of profound har
monies with airy, then langorous
rhythms—the opposition of the reli
gious motif and the song of the sirens
—was so delicately handled that the
rapt audience was left at the conclu
sion of the composition profoundly
stirred by its beauty.

Much different was the second part
of the program. This was the music
from the ballet, "Skyscrapers," by
Carpenter. Written in 1924 for the
Diaghileff Ballet, it was first produced
at. the Metropolitan Opera House in
1926. It was intended to portray the
basic rhythm of work and play which,
the composer felt, typified American
life. Whether or not it successfully
does so is impossible to ascertain
from the music alone. The action of
the ballet would seem to be a neces
sary accompaniment. The orchestra
was augmented, for this selection, by
an air whistle, a banjo, and a bass
drum. Marie Verdi, soprano, and E. G.
Imhaus, baritone, assisted with the
incidental vocal effects. The music can
best be described as sublimated jazz.
Its symbolism was somewhat difficult
of analysis, but would doubtless be
effective with the ballet.

In his final selection, Hertz was
given full opportunity to display his
genius and that of his orchestra. The
difficult Symphony No. 7 in C Major
was performed. This was one of the
last compositions of Franz Schubert,
and perhaps his most magnificent. Its
performance was excellent, and highly
appreciated, as the long-lasting ap
plause testified at the conclusion of
the great piece. —L. O. H.

Wilson Follett in the June issue of
the Bookman makes a great deal of
fuss about the credit given to news
paper men for verbal economy and
the effectiveness therefrom. Follett in
this number of the Bookman has writ
ten an essay called "The Printed
Word," in which he rants at great
length about newspaper style.
In the first paragraph he declares
that the journalist is supposed to make
twenty words suffice where an ordi
nary mortal would use fifty to get the
same effect, that his office is so over
estimated that American universities
encourage literary "would-be's" to

serve an apprenticeship to journalism
in order to write a disciplined, con
densed style. He objects further, in
this same paragraph, that the belief
that the newspaper is "master of
pithy utterance, is so wide-spread that
newspapermen actually believe it
themselves, in face of daily disproof
that would annihilate their conviction
on almost any other subject in the
world."
Then, in the rest of the essay, Mr.
Follett tries to show that the journal
ist's reputation is unfounded, and that
four-fifths of modern newspaper writ
ing is much more diffuse and wasteful
than anything else in print that is any
where nearly as readable. He submits
three reasons for the prevalent delu
sion that journalism is the great
school of economy in the use of
words, as follows:
First, that there is a great deal the
journalist has to ignore as outside his

province, and therefore he is credited
with a talent for succinctness, merely
on the ground of what his profession
requires him not to attempt.

Second, that the news story opens
with a sentence designed to answer as
many questions as possible—who?
what? when? where? how? why?—
and the reporter's grasp of this talent
"has about as much to do with trench
ant expression as ability to keep the
box-score of baseball game."

And third, that the "ingenious short
hand resorted to by the writer of
headlines, is so closely planned for its
space as to involve actual letter count
ing," and although the English of
headlines is the ultimate in terseness,
it constricts more than it comprises.

After giving these reasons which he
considers as constituting almost the
whole story of why so many people
regard the daily paper as a model of
consision, he finishes his argument by
elaborating on the fact that the busi
ness of journalism is transacted in an
amazingly limited and impoverished
vocabulary. The rest of the essay con
sists in giving numerous examples to
illustrate his point.
However, whether his essay is ef
fective or not, it would do no harm
to remember that some of the greatest
modern writers have made their liter
ary bows after passing through the
journalist's office.

Conductor Alfred Hertz and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra pre
sented an unusual and interesting
program at the third of the Woodland
Theatre concerts on Sunday last, and
an enthusiastic audience was present
to greet the popular orchestra leader
The overture to Richard Wagner's
great opera, "Tannhauser," formed
the opening number of the concert.
Its interweaving of profound har
monies with airy, then langorous
rhythms—the opposition of the reli
gious motif and the song of the sirens
—was so delicately handled that the
rapt audience was left at the conclu
sion of the composition profoundly
stirred by its beauty.

Much different was the second part
of the program. This was the music
from the ballet, "Skyscrapers," by
Carpenter. Written in 1924 for the
Diaghileff Ballet, it was first produced
at. the Metropolitan Opera House in
1926. It was intended to portray the
basic rhythm of work and play which,
the composer felt, typified American
life. Whether or not it successfully
does so is impossible to ascertain
from the music alone. The action of
the ballet would seem to be a neces
sary accompaniment. The orchestra
was augmented, for this selection, by
an air whistle, a banjo, and a bass
drum. Marie Verdi, soprano, and E. G.
Imhaus, baritone, assisted with the
incidental vocal effects. The music can
best be described as sublimated jazz.
Its symbolism was somewhat difficult
of analysis, but would doubtless be
effective with the ballet.

In his final selection, Hertz was
given full opportunity to display his
genius and that of his orchestra. The
difficult Symphony No. 7 in C Major
was performed. This was one of the
last compositions of Franz Schubert,
and perhaps his most magnificent. Its
performance was excellent, and highly
appreciated, as the long-lasting ap
plause testified at the conclusion of
the great piece. —L. O. H.

Wilson Follett in the June issue of
the Bookman makes a great deal of
fuss about the credit given to news
paper men for verbal economy and
the effectiveness therefrom. Follett in
this number of the Bookman has writ
ten an essay called "The Printed
Word," in which he rants at great
length about newspaper style.
In the first paragraph he declares
that the journalist is supposed to make
twenty words suffice where an ordi
nary mortal would use fifty to get the
same effect, that his office is so over
estimated that American universities
encourage literary "would-be's" to

serve an apprenticeship to journalism
in order to write a disciplined, con
densed style. He objects further, in
this same paragraph, that the belief
that the newspaper is "master of
pithy utterance, is so wide-spread that
newspapermen actually believe it
themselves, in face of daily disproof
that would annihilate their conviction
on almost any other subject in the
world."
Then, in the rest of the essay, Mr.
Follett tries to show that the journal
ist's reputation is unfounded, and that
four-fifths of modern newspaper writ
ing is much more diffuse and wasteful
than anything else in print that is any
where nearly as readable. He submits
three reasons for the prevalent delu
sion that journalism is the great
school of economy in the use of
words, as follows:
First, that there is a great deal the
journalist has to ignore as outside his

province, and therefore he is credited
with a talent for succinctness, merely
on the ground of what his profession
requires him not to attempt.

Second, that the news story opens
with a sentence designed to answer as
many questions as possible—who?
what? when? where? how? why?—
and the reporter's grasp of this talent
"has about as much to do with trench
ant expression as ability to keep the
box-score of baseball game."

And third, that the "ingenious short
hand resorted to by the writer of
headlines, is so closely planned for its
space as to involve actual letter count
ing," and although the English of

than anything else in print that is any
where nearly as readable. He submits
three reasons for the prevalent delu
sion that journalism is the great
school of economy in the use of
words, as follows:
First, that there is a great deal the
journalist has to ignore as outside his

province, and therefore he is credited
with a talent for succinctness, merely
on the ground of what his profession
requires him not to attempt.

Second, that the news story opens
with a sentence designed to answer as
many questions as possible—who?
what? when? where? how? why?—
and the reporter's grasp of this talent
"has about as much to do with trench
ant expression as ability to keep the
box-score of baseball game."

And third, that the "ingenious short
hand resorted to by the writer of
headlines, is so closely planned for its
space as to involve actual letter count
ing," and although the English of
headlines is the ultimate in terseness,
it constricts more than it comprises.

After giving these reasons which he
considers as constituting almost the
whole story of why so many people
regard the daily paper as a model of
consision, he finishes his argument by
elaborating on the fact that the busi
ness of journalism is transacted in an
amazingly limited and impoverished
vocabulary. The rest of the essay con
sists in giving numerous examples to
illustrate his point.
However, whether his essay is ef
fective or not, it would do no harm
to remember that some of the greatest
modern writers have made their liter
ary bows after passing through the
journalist's office.

Conductor Alfred Hertz and the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra pre
sented an unusual and interesting
program at the third of the Woodland
Theatre concerts on Sunday last, and
an enthusiastic audience was present
to greet the popular orchestra leader
The overture to Richard Wagner's
great opera, "Tannhauser," formed
the opening number of the concert.
Its interweaving of profound har
monies with airy, then langorous
rhythms—the opposition of the reli
gious motif and the song of the sirens
—was so delicately handled that the
rapt audience was left at the conclu
sion of the composition profoundly
stirred by its beauty.

Much different was the second part
of the program. This was the music
from the ballet, "Skyscrapers," by
Carpenter. Written in 1924 for the
Diaghileff Ballet, it was first produced
at. the Metropolitan Opera House in
1926. It was intended to portray the
basic rhythm of work and play which,
the composer felt, typified American
life. Whether or not it successfully
does so is impossible to ascertain
from the music alone. The action of
the ballet would seem to be a neces
sary accompaniment. The orchestra
was augmented, for this selection, by
an air whistle, a banjo, and a bass
drum. Marie Verdi, soprano, and E. G.
Imhaus, baritone, assisted with the
incidental vocal effects. The music can
best be described as sublimated jazz.
Its symbolism was somewhat difficult
of analysis, but would doubtless be
effective with the ballet.

In his final selection, Hertz was
given full opportunity to display his
genius and that of his orchestra. The
difficult Symphony No. 7 in C Major
was performed. This was one of the
last compositions of Franz Schubert,
and perhaps his most magnificent. Its
performance was excellent, and highly
appreciated, as the long-lasting ap
plause testified at the conclusion of
the great piece. —L. O. H.

Wilson Follett in the June issue of
the Bookman makes a great deal of
fuss about the credit given to news
paper men for verbal economy and
the effectiveness therefrom. Follett in
this number of the Bookman has writ
ten an essay called "The Printed
Word," in which he rants at great
length about newspaper style.
In the first paragraph he declares
that the journalist is supposed to make
twenty words suffice where an ordi
nary mortal would use fifty to get the
same effect, that his office is so over
estimated that American universities
encourage literary "would-be's" to

serve an apprenticeship to journalism
in order to write a disciplined, con
densed style. He objects further, in
this same paragraph, that the belief
that the newspaper is "master of
pithy utterance, is so wide-spread that
newspapermen actually believe it
themselves, in face of daily disproof
that would annihilate their conviction
on almost any other subject in the
world."
Then, in the rest of the essay, Mr.
Follett tries to show that the journal
ist's reputation is unfounded, and that
four-fifths of modern newspaper writ
ing is much more diffuse and wasteful
than anything else in print that is any
where nearly as readable. He submits
