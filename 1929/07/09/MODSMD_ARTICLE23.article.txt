# CABBAGES and THINGS

### Philip Space 
Already there haa come complaint
after complaint that we are just an
old cynic—doing nothing to brighten
this ol' world and make it a better
place in which to live. "Whyn't you
give somebody else a chance" one
reader cries—"have an Edgar Guest
conductor, so to speak." This is against
our policy, but we ourselves have
written a little Poem of Cheer entitled
SMILE SMILE SMILE
Brighten up, neighbor, can't you see
the sun?
Everyone is laughing and having lots
of fun.
What though clouds seem bleary?
What though days seem dreary?
Brighten up, neighbor, can't you see
the sun?
Brighten up, neighbor, can't you see
the sun?
Suppose your mortgage now IS due
and you ain't got the mon'.
It's true your wife is dying,
But then it's no use crying.
Brighten up, neighbor, can't you see
the sun?
Brighten up, neighbor, can't you see
the sun?
Times are very happy when all is said
and done.
Yes, the taxes now are due —
Certainly you're feeling "blue,"
But brighten up, neighbor, can't you
see the sun?
Brighten up, neighbor, can't you see
the sun?
Forget that your ol' troubles seem to
weigh a ton.
Give those troubles all the "razz."
Brighten up with pep and jazz!
Brighten up, neighbor, can't you see
the sun?
Brighten up, neighbor, can't you see
the sun?
Grin and rest and grin some more,
then the battle's won.

Baldness means you're dandruff free.
Old age has its memory.
So brighten up, neighbor, can't you
see the sun?
And SMILE SMILE SMILE
Teeth or no teeth, SMILE!!!

Just when you're thinking nothing
could be worse, along comes this head
line from the ever-reliable San Fran
cisco Chronicle —
"GAS FAW DOWN
AND GO BOOM"

Prof. Space's definition of a Super
man :
One who can walk with a cafeteria
tray without spilling the coffee.
