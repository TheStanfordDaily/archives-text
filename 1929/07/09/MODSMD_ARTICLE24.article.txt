# Summer Students Borrow High Percentage Of Books
## 
### 
That summer students are making
greater use of the library facilities
than the students of other quarters is
indicated by statistics that show that
last Tuesday 1032 books were bor
rowed from the Library. This number
is only 169 less than the highest mark
of the year, which reached 1201 on
April 21, when more than twice aa
many students were enrolled.
Reference books in all subjects,
especially in education, are in great
demand, for the summer students in
general carry such intensive course√ü
that they have little time for "light
reading."
