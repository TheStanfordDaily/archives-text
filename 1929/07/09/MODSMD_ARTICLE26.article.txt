# MORE SEX EDUCATION IS NEEDED DECLARES DR. HARRY B. TORREY
## Child Should Be Taught to Understand; Study Must Begin at Home 
### 
"Frankness in regard to sex is the
wtlvation of the race," declares Dr.
Harry Beal Torrey, professor of hy
giene and physical education.
According to Dr. Torrey, we will not
avoid sex as we have in the past. The
sex problem is not nearly as bad as it
was in the mid-Victorian era when it
was not regarded as a fit subject for
conversation.
"Judging by the past, sex education
will enter more and more into the
school curriculum, Dr. Torrey says.
"Sex pervades life. It cannot be sepa
rated from other phases of life. Sex
information is diffused throughout
many subjects such as biology, psych
ology, and literature. Courses in sex
education have no place as separate
subjects."
Dr. Torrey believes that the sex
education of the child should begin in
the home early, simply, and simul
taneously with the rest of his educa
tion. The child, in his relations with
his mother and his father, has obtained
the major portion of his sex educa
tion before he enters school.
"Today's parents as a whole are
not well-equipped to carry on such in
struction," Dr. Torrey says. "One of
the important functions of the train
ing of parents is the teaching of the
child to understand and handle his
sex life."
Instead of telling the child the
stork myth, Dr. Torrey would give
him pets in whose life he could ob
serve the common phenomena of
sexual life unemotionally.
According to Dr. Torrey, two of the
best sources of information on the
subject are the American Social Hy
giene Society of New York and the
Social Hygiene Educational Associa
tion of San Francisco.
