# MEDICAL COURSE MAY INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGY INSTRUCTOR BELIEVES
## 
### 
Psychology may soon become an in
tegral part of professional medical
training was the opinion of Miss
Helen Marshall, instructor in psych
ology and psychiatry at the Stanford
Medical School in San Francisco, when
interviewed yesterday.
"The successful doctor is a natural
student of human nature. The time
will come when doctors as well as
nurses will feel it necessary to study
psychology," said Miss Marshall.
"This study is teaching the nurse
to put herself in her patient's place.
It is helping her to feel how her pa
tient might feel. It is bringing to her
mind those attentions that might
make her patient happier."
"With mental testing psychology has
definitely proved its value in the medi
cal clinic," Miss Marshall declared.
"Lack of intelligence is the only thing
wrong with a great many people who
come to see a doctor."
Psychiatry has been taught for a
considerable period of time as a par
ticular field of the medical course.
The treatment of the insane is a prob
lem for a doctor who has had special
training in this subject.
Miss Marshall has been doing work
in psychiatry in San Francisco. She
is giving a course in abnormal psych
ology here this summer.
