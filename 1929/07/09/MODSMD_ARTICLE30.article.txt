# AGREEMENT NEAR IN NAVY PARLEY, RUSSELL CLAIMS
## Political Science Professor Thinks Chances Better Than in 1927 
### 
Prospects for reaching an agree
ment in the Anglo-American Naval
Conference in the near future are
good, and decidedly better than in
1927 when the Washington Confer
ence failed to bring a decision, is the
spinion of Dr. Frank M. Russell, act
ing associate professor of political
science at Stanford during the sum
mer quarter.
"The possibility of reaching an early
settlement on the reduction of naval
strength, primarily between Great
Britain and the United States, rests
on two factors," states Professor Rus
sell. First, that Mr. Hoover, a man of
abundant initiative and energy, and
possessing great insight into interna
tional affairs, is in the White House;
and second, that the Labor Party is
in office in Great Britain and is com
mitted to a policy of friendship with
the United States. Another valuable
asset to both nations is that the Labor
Party is also liberal in its general in
ternational outlook.

"Apparently the naval experts on
the respective sides are not to be
permitted to obstruct the work of the
statesmen in this conference," con
tinues Dr. Russell, "but are to be
used as far as their technical knowl
edge will enable statesmen on both
sides to achieve a reduction of naval
armament on which they have set
their minds."

Professor Russell bases his opinion
of this paramount question on a close
scrutiny of the actions and confer
ences of Rainsay Mac Donald and Am
bassador Dawes, and is reported one
of the best-informed men in the United
States on international relations. He
was graduated from Stanford in 1912,
receiving his Ph.D. here in 1925. He
has been a member of the University
of California faculty since 1921 and
is replacing Professor Scelle, who was
to come from the University of Dijon,
France, as a member of the summer
quarter faculty.
