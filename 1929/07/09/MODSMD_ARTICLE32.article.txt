# TOLMAN SUGGESTS GAS TRANSFER TO SOLVE KETTLEMAN TROUBLE
## Would Involve Piping Fuel To Coalinga Fields For Storage 
### 
"The transferring of billions of
cubic feet of gas from the Kettleman
oil fields to the exhausted Coalinga
fields, a natural underground reservoir
thirty miles away, will no doubt be
the solution of the Kettleman Hills
oil question," is the opinion of Pro
fessor C. F. Tolman of the geology
department.
"Handicapped by a recent state law
prohibiting the removal of oil without
the utilization of the gases mixed
with it, the Kettleman companies are
faced with two alternative solutions,"
Professor Tolman went on. "There be
ing no immediate market for the great
quantities of gas produced in this
newly discovered oil district, the gas
must either be stored or drilling for
the oil suspended."

The storing of the gas will involve
the piping of the troublesome but
valuable fuel to the exhausted Coal
inga oil fields thirty miles from the
Kettleman Hills. Here the gas will be
forced underground and stored indefi
nitely. At present, the discovery-well
is supplying sufficient gas to meet
the consumption of central California.

According to Professor Tolman, the
storing of the gas in the Coalinga
oil fields will be of double advantage.
The pressure of the gas, it is ex
plained, will force additional oil from
the practically dry wells, obtaining
oil that otherwise could not have been
secured.
Conservation of the gases in Cali
fornia has been an issue for some
time, and was recently given much
attention by Secretary of the Interior
Wilbur. It is estimated that millions
of cubic feet of useful gas are wasted
annually in the oil industry, the mar
ket for the oil being so much greater
than that of the gas.
