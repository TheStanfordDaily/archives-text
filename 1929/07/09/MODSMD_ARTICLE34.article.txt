ties of Japan, China, and the Pacific
Area, under the auspices of the Car

the Faculty of Social Sciences at the

Dr. Martin will lecture this autumn
before the Imperial Universities of
Tokyo and Kyoto and Doshisha and
Waseda universities in Japan, and the

tional universities in China. He will
also give special addresses before
scientific bodies and learned societies.

The purpose of Dean Martin's visit,
ad stated by Dr. Butler, is to "multiply
and strengthen the bonds of intellec
tual and scholarly understanding and
friendship between Japan, China, the
countries of the Pacific, and the United
States, to perform such academic ser
vices as may be found useful and
practicable."

He will give two series of lectures
at the universities, one on "The Con
stitutional Government of the United
States," and one on "The Essentials
of American Civilization."
