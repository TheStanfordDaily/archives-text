# PROFESSOR W. B. LEE PERFECTS NEW GLUE IN CAMPUS RESEARCH
## California Climate Assists Doctors Lee, McBain in Cohesion Test 
### 
Sticking a stamp on an envelope is
a common experience but why the
stamp sticks is an outstanding prob
lem in the field of adhesives. The an
swer belongs to William Bell Lee, for
merly of the University of Bristol,
England, and acting assistant profes
sor of chemistry at Stanford, who has
perfected the first satisfactory cellu
loid glue and who has published five
papers in collaboration with Dr. James
William Mcßain who came to Stan
ford from the University of Bristol in
1927 to act as professor of chemistry.

By his investigation with adhesives,
at Stanford, Dr. Lee has gained an
insight into the theoretical aspects of
adhesion and has already formulated
some of its laws. At present, he is
conducting a check on the experiment
of Sir William Hardy, leading British
scientist.
Checks "Mahomet's Coffin"
Sir Hardy claims that two optically
polished metal or glass surfaces, the
smoothest things known, when placed
cne on top o fthe other, do not touch
but float at a distance of several
inicrons. By the use of an interfero
ecope which measures the reflected
rays of a mercury arc lamp, Dr. Lee,
using air free from dust and moisture,
is enabled to perform an experiment
much more accurate than the one
inade originally. He calls the pheno
mena "Mahomet's coffin."
So far, only a preliminary check has
been made but it has been discovered
that the law of gravitation is of no
value in dealing with adhesives since
the results of cohesion are ridiculously
small.
New Adhesives Used
During his researches, Dr. Lee has
discovered that pure chemical sub
stances in the form of a film about
one millionth of an inch thick are ex
tremely strong when used as an ad
hesive between smooth metal sur
faces. T.N.T., as an adhesive, will
stand a pressure of one-half ton to
the square inch and ordinary shellac
will bear a load up to two tons to
the square inch.
According to Doctor Lee, experi
ments with adhesives can be carried
on to better advantage in California
than in England since the climate
here is less humid.

will bear a load up to two tons to
the square inch.
According to Doctor Lee, experi
ments with adhesives can be carried
on to better advantage in California
than in England since the climate
here is less humid.
Sticking a stamp on an envelope is
a common experience but why the
stamp sticks is an outstanding prob
lem in the field of adhesives. The an
swer belongs to William Bell Lee, for
merly of the University of Bristol,
England, and acting assistant profes
sor of chemistry at Stanford, who has
perfected the first satisfactory cellu
loid glue and who has published five
papers in collaboration with Dr. James
William Mcßain who came to Stan
ford from the University of Bristol in
1927 to act as professor of chemistry.

By his investigation with adhesives,
at Stanford, Dr. Lee has gained an
insight into the theoretical aspects of
adhesion and has already formulated
some of its laws. At present, he is
conducting a check on the experiment
of Sir William Hardy, leading British
scientist.
Checks "Mahomet's Coffin"
Sir Hardy claims that two optically
polished metal or glass surfaces, the
smoothest things known, when placed
cne on top o fthe other, do not touch
but float at a distance of several
inicrons. By the use of an interfero
ecope which measures the reflected
rays of a mercury arc lamp, Dr. Lee,
using air free from dust and moisture,
is enabled to perform an experiment
much more accurate than the one
inade originally. He calls the pheno
mena "Mahomet's coffin."
So far, only a preliminary check has
been made but it has been discovered
that the law of gravitation is of no
value in dealing with adhesives since
the results of cohesion are ridiculously
small.
New Adhesives Used
During his researches, Dr. Lee has
discovered that pure chemical sub
stances in the form of a film about
one millionth of an inch thick are ex
tremely strong when used as an ad
hesive between smooth metal sur
faces. T.N.T., as an adhesive, will
stand a pressure of one-half ton to
the square inch and ordinary shellac
will bear a load up to two tons to
the square inch.
According to Doctor Lee, experi
ments with adhesives can be carried
on to better advantage in California
than in England since the climate
here is less humid.
