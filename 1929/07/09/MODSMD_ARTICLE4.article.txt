# ABAS FOUR IN LAST CAMPUS APPEARANCE
## 
### 
Presenting a program especially
pleasing because of its contrasts, the
Abas String Quartet gave its third
and final concert in Branner Hall last
night. The first two groups were of a
somewhat formal character, being se
lections by Beethoven and Ravel.
Within these groups there were also
delightful contrasts, such as Beetho
ven's "Adagio ma non Troppo," and
his "Presto." The third group con
sisted of lighter and more informal
numbers, such as Borodine's "Noc
turne," Harrison's "Humoresque," and
Sandley's "Swedish Folk Song." A
large audience attended the concert,
and expressed its appreciation of the
technique of the artists, and the
beauty of their music.

The second of the concerts, given
by the quartet Tuesday evening, con
sisted of three numbers made up of
different movements. The first was
Opus 18, No. 1, by Beethoven. The
second, Taneiew's "Theme and Varia
tions" Opus 7, was a representation of
modern Russian music. The last,
Dvorak's Opus 96, was made up of
four movements of which the Lento
was particularly appreciated.
