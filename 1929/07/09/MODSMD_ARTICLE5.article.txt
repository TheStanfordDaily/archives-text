Entry sheets for the annual sum
mer school singles and doubles ten
nis tournament for men are now on
the bulletin board in the Encina Gym
nasium. The tournament is open to
all registered students and members
of the summer school faculty. Entries
should be made this week, as the
sheets will be taken down Friday, and
drawings made and posted Monday.

A fifteen-dollar standard gut racquet
lias been given as a trophy for the
singles tournament by The Tennis
Shop of Palo Alto.

If there is any desire for a mixed
doubles, or a women's singles tourna
ment, these can be arranged after the
men's tournament has been played
off, according to E. B. Bugge, tennis
instructor. A special faculty tourna
ment may be held. In any of these
cases, there must be at least six
teen entries in the singles tourna
ments, or sixteen couples in the dou
bles.
