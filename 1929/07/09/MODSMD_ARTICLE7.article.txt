That Stanford's new swimming pools
would be ready for use by autumn
quarter was indicated today by the
activity of the contractors who have
already begun preliminary operations.

Estimates place the cost of the
whole project, including the new
wing, the bleachers, and the tearing
out of the old pools, at $105,000. Con
struction of the new plunges will be
carried on in such a way that there
will always be one available during
the present quarter.

The three pools will have plaster
walls and floor, and tile scum gutters.
The class tank will be 33 by CO feet,
and from 4 feet to 4 feet C inches in
depth. The diving and water polo pool
will be 40 by 60 feet, with a depth of
from 9 to 12 feet. The varsity plunge
will be 40 by 75 feet, with a depth
of 6 feet 6 inches to 7 feet. The
present pool is 40 by 100 feet and of
a depth of 4 to 9 feet. The new
shower and locker rooms will be 40
by 110 feet.

The bleachers, 9 to 15 rows of them,
will seat 220 people. The class and
diving pools will occupy the site of
the present tank. The varsity pool
will be back of these, in the direction
of Encina Hall, and will have bleach
ers on two sides.
Contract to build the three new
swimming pools was awarded to Grant
L. Miner of Palo Alto last week by the
Beard of Athletic Control. Contract
for the three filtering plants was
awarded to the California Filter Com
pany of San Francisco. Plans for the
construction of the new wing of the
gymnasium are not yet complete, and
no bids will be received for at least
two weeks.
