# German Universities Democratized, Overcrowded Following World War
## 
### 
German universities have changed
more in the past ten years than they
did in the hundred years before the
war.
This was the keynote of an illus
trated lecture, "German Universities
—Old and New," given by Professor
von der Leyen in the Little Theatre
last Wednesday. Dr. von der Leyen,
who is from the University of Cologne,
is acting professor of German.
The number of German university
students before the war, 40,000, has
increased to 70,000 resulting in serious
overcrowding. This has been due
mainly to the introduction of new and
fascinating subjects, such as journal
ism, dramatics, and eugenics. There
is a rising interest in English, French,
and the classical studies, with the
greatest increases in number of stu
dents in law, and economic and politi
cal science.
"Less Drinking"
"The German students of today are
more intellectual, more susceptible to
education, less given to excessive
drinking, and have a greater interest
in sports than previous generations.

Many students are supporting their
parents and younger brothers and sis
ters as well as themselves by manual
labor and tutoring," Professor von der
Leyen stated.

"The universities, realizing that the
working classes are the hope of Ger
many's future, have become more lib
eral in their admission requirements."

Professor von der Leyen said that
to the pre-war ideals of the German
universities —research and teaching—
there has been an effort to add another
—education for national leadership —
and to give the right emphasis to all
three. He deplored the fact that Ger
man politics sometimes influence the
appointment of professors and that
examinations are overvalued.
"The larger universities have great
er importance than the smaller, the
students preferring the bigger cities
which offer cheaper living conditions,
movies, and better libraries," Profes
sor von der Leyen said.
"Germany can learn much from the
universities of the United States and
should continue to exchange ideas,
professors, and students."
