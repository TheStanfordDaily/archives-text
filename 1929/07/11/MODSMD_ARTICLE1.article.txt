# MEDIEVAL STUDY AIDED BY UNION SAYS LACOMBE
## European Countries Join in International Movement to Simplify Research Study Unification Now Sought to Ease Task of Scholars in Historical Field of Work 
### 
The International Union of Acade
mies has contributed much to the
simplification of Medieval Research,
according to Father George Lacombe,
Ph.D., Stanford '22, in his talk in the
Little Theatre yesterday. At present
the Union is working on three pro
jects the unification of the customs
of publication signs, a new edition of
DuCange, and a catalog of incipits
from all the known manuscripts.

The work on the unification of the
customs governing publication signs
is an endeavor to produce a set of
signs which will mean the same thing
in all languages. Father Lacombe
pointed out that as the signs are now
one symbol may mean "added by edi
tor" in one language, and "a sup
pressed word" in another.

The edition of DuCange, explained
Father Lacombe, involves the collect
ing of all textbooks published in Latin
from the Middle Ages up to the period
of the Renaissance. These manuscripts
must be collected separately in each
country, and from them a list of non
classical Latin words worked up.
These lists will then be published in
a separate volume for each country,
and from these volumes a scholar may
work down the philology of any word.

The new edition of DuCange is based
on the work of the scholar DuCange
whose work was first published in the
17th Century.

Incipits, or the first five words of
every manuscript, are a decided aid
in helping to decide the date and au
thor of ancient manuscripts, Father
Lecombe pointed out, and when these
have been catalogued with the prob
able date and author, the work of
scholars will be immensely reduced.
America may have the privilege of
giving the world a great deal along
that line for no one knows what manu
scripts are in this country, and the
collection of American manuscripts
may prove an immense aid in estab
lishing the identity of others.
The Union of Academies is now
composed of eighteen countries, Ger
many being the only European coun
try which does not belong. The Union
meets at Brussels, and the official
language is French.
