# Balzac's Imagination Praised by Guerard in Tuesday Lecture
## 
### 
"Balzac's imagination was far in
advance of the pre-industrial age in
which he lived," was the opinion ex
pressed by Albert L. Gu6rard, profes
sor of General Literature, in a lecture
given in the Little Theatre Tuesday
night.
"That a study of law is the best
preparation for a literary career is
exemplified by Balzac's life," con
tinued Professor Gu6rard, "and the
atmosphere of the law office is in all
of Balzac's works, for law is an ex
cellent preparation for life, and life
for literature."

Professor GuSrard spoke of the
tragic aspect of Balzac's whole life,
for Balzac's youth and most of his
life was overshadowed by sadness.
"The constant struggle of this great
writer for success and the hovering
between popular recognition, contempt,
and opulence, and the debtor's prison
are reflected in Balzac's works, and
reveal the author to be a romanticist
with the germ of realism appearing
for the first time," said the lecturer.

"A man of Balzac's business out
look,"- said Professor Gu6rard, "was
far in advance of his age, and had he
lived today he would have made an
excellent business man."
