# SMOKERS ARE MENACE TO CAMPUS, CLAIM OF STANFORD FIRE CHIEF
## 
### 
The Stanford Fire Department is
doing a rushing business these days.
And it's all due to the evils of smok
ing. So says Chief R. E. Dugan, sur
veying the amount of fire damage
done since the beginning of the sum
mer quarter on and around the cam
pus.
"We have fought ten grass fires dur
ing the past two weeks," he went on,
"and in every case the cause was due
to the criminal carelessness of indi
viduals in the matter of smoking and
neglecting to extinguish cigarette or
match. With the co-operation of stu
dents and tenants much needless de
struction could be avoided."

The Fire Chief speaks from a fund
of practical experience, having seen
service in the San Francisco Fire De
partment for eighteen years. He has
held his present position for the past
seven years. The territory over which
he has control includes all of Stan
ford, eight miles in length and about
two miles wide. This area is protected
by the two campus fire houses. Three
fire engines are used.

Dugan advises that in case of fire
the quickest way to get help is to send
the call in directly through one of the
alarm boxes on the campus.
