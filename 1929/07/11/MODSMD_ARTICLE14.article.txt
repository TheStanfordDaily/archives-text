# Summer Dramatic Season to Open Tomorrow with "Adding Machine"
## 
### 
"Sure I killed him! But I'm a regular guy, see? Just like youse fellows!"
The case of Buruell Gould as Mr. Zero will be summed up tonight at the
final dress rehearsal of "The Adding Machine." Rehearsal last night was
devoted to last touches upon the difficult production and set a standard
assuring excellence for the production tomorrow night in the Assembly Hall.
Under the directorship of Gordon Davis and the auspices of Stanford
Dramatic Council, "The Adding Machine" by Elmer Rice will open the sum-

mer dramatic season. The play is con
sidered one of the most significant
and dynamic of the modernistic plays
and offers a number of innovations in
dramatic as well as technical require
ments.

First Time in W«st
The theme is the evolution of the
eternal bookkeeper. His possibilities
in the hereafter are treated with sar
donic humor, but the problems of his
life are developed in a powerful cli
max. The production Friday night will
be the first Western presentation of
the play, and has hitherto been re
garded as making too heavy demands
to be risked by the usual amateur
company.
Tickets for the play may be se
cured at either the A.S.S.U. office
in the Old Union, or at Keeble's
in Palo Alto until 5 o'clock Fri
day afternoon. Roughs, according
to the old Stanford custom, will
be granted their traditional prero
gatives at 7 o'clock tomorrow
night, when the box office will
open at the Assembly Hall.
Roughs' seats will be placed on
sale at the traditional price of
50 cents.
Leads Are Experienced
Burnell Gould, as the lead, Mr. Zero,
will play a difficult role requiring a
wide range of tempo. His previous
experience in campus dramatics
should prove valuable in the variety
of characterization called for. June
Clemons as Daisy Diana Dorothea De
vore will play her first campus role
since "Hell Bent Fer Heaven," in
which she made a lasting impression
several summers ago at Stanford.

The cast of twenty-two includes sev
eral students popular with campus
audiences. Tom Henry, as Lieutenant
Charles, the boss of the shipping de
partment in the soul factory, will play
the key role of the drama. Dorothy
Tully and Margaret Watts, as Judy
O'Grady and Mrs. Zero, will be two
actresses new to the Stanford stage.

Highly stylized sets have been com
pleted by Harold Helvenston and his
Theatre Workshop class for the pro
duction, similar in atmosphere to the
play itself. Several new lighting de
vices will be introduced and a number
of innovations in settings may be ex
pected.

life are developed in a powerful cli
max. The production Friday night will
be the first Western presentation of
the play, and has hitherto been re
garded as making too heavy demands
to be risked by the usual amateur
company.
Tickets for the play may be se
cured at either the A.S.S.U. office
in the Old Union, or at Keeble's
in Palo Alto until 5 o'clock Fri
day afternoon. Roughs, according
to the old Stanford custom, will
be granted their traditional prero
gatives at 7 o'clock tomorrow
night, when the box office will
open at the Assembly Hall.
Roughs' seats will be placed on
sale at the traditional price of
50 cents.
Leads Are Experienced
Burnell Gould, as the lead, Mr. Zero,
will play a difficult role requiring a
wide range of tempo. His previous
experience in campus dramatics
should prove valuable in the variety
of characterization called for. June
Clemons as Daisy Diana Dorothea De
vore will play her first campus role
since "Hell Bent Fer Heaven," in
which she made a lasting impression
several summers ago at Stanford.

The cast of twenty-two includes sev
eral students popular with campus
audiences. Tom Henry, as Lieutenant
Charles, the boss of the shipping de
partment in the soul factory, will play
the key role of the drama. Dorothy
Tully and Margaret Watts, as Judy
O'Grady and Mrs. Zero, will be two
actresses new to the Stanford stage.

Highly stylized sets have been com
pleted by Harold Helvenston and his
Theatre Workshop class for the pro
duction, similar in atmosphere to the
play itself. Several new lighting de
vices will be introduced and a number
of innovations in settings may be ex
pected.
"Sure I killed him! But I'm a regular guy, see? Just like youse fellows!"
The case of Buruell Gould as Mr. Zero will be summed up tonight at the
final dress rehearsal of "The Adding Machine." Rehearsal last night was
devoted to last touches upon the difficult production and set a standard
assuring excellence for the production tomorrow night in the Assembly Hall.
Under the directorship of Gordon Davis and the auspices of Stanford
Dramatic Council, "The Adding Machine" by Elmer Rice will open the sum-

mer dramatic season. The play is con
sidered one of the most significant
and dynamic of the modernistic plays
and offers a number of innovations in
dramatic as well as technical require
ments.

First Time in W«st
The theme is the evolution of the
eternal bookkeeper. His possibilities
in the hereafter are treated with sar
donic humor, but the problems of his
life are developed in a powerful cli
max. The production Friday night will
