# Water And Stanford's Future
## 
### 
"The town of Palo Alto and Stanford University will also soon need
water from the Hetch-Hetchy-Spring Valley system." This is a side
remark of the committee of engineers which reported on the water
situation in San Mateo county. Iliat situation is serious and on the
verge of being desparate, the engineers declare. It threatens to throttle
growth.
Santa Clara county is in no better state than San Mateo. The abso
lute need of water for continued growth has always been known, the
inadequacy of supplies has been realized for years, but still nothing
effective has been done to forestall the inevitable strangling of develop
ment.
Stanford has always appreciated the necessity of water for its welfare.
Before the Stanford Farm became the University campus, the creation
of Searsville Lake and of Lagunita attested to the perception that upon a
supply of water depended the usefulness of the land. Since the University
was established Searsville has been greatly increased in capacity, and
additional wells have been sunk for drinking water. There could be no
golf links except that Felt Lake, by means of a dam, can be made to
impound more water than it now holds. If more water could be put on
Stanford land, the income from that land could be increased, for the
benefit of the University. But we have about reached the end of our own
possible resources.
"Soon" is the engineers' word after their survey of conditions; "Stan
ford University will soon need water from the Hetch-Hetchy-Spring
Valley system." This whole peninsula and valley are bound together by a
common need of water and by the certainty of blockaded prosperity if
water is not obtained.
It seems a little strange that the future of a university should in any
way depend upon water being spread upon land, but in California water
is life, and Stanford's life will be considerably affected by the way in
which all the communities in this region work together to secure the
water that is essential for life and continued growth.
