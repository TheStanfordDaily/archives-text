"When in Rome do as the Romans do."
This is a bit of advice that comes to us from long ago, but it well
applies to Stanford because of the difference between this University
and most of the others of the country. The idea is not that we want you
to do as others do, but that we wish you to get the advantages of the
distinctive characteristics of Stanford while you are here.

Stanford is essentially a residence university. That is, practically all
students and the majority of faculty members live on the campus. When
classes are over they are home. They do not have to take an automobile
or trolley car and go to some other part of a big city to eat and sleep, as
they do at so many universities.
Stanford lias all the characteristics of a small city—a postoffice, a fire
department, a street maintenance department, a water system, stores,
restaurants, courts of justice, and other features of city government.
The university part is really the capital of this little kingdom—our
campus—comprising approximately thirteen square miles. \\ hen a man
becomes a Stanford student he is no longer a visitor to Rome, but a
Roman. Upon registration a man has full Stanford citizenship conferred
upon him.
