# Looking Like a Scholar
## 
### 
You can't tell bv tlie looks of a frog how far he can leap. Neither
can you always tell from external appearances whether or not a man is a
scholar. But Stanford lias its share of those individuals, who, in addition
to acquiring knowledge after a fashion, feel that they are scholars and
must therefore look the part.
Just try to pick out some of the country's most famous scholars merely
by their demeanor. Tt can't be done. They are the most natural individuals
in the whole world; developing the correct scholarly look is the least of
their troubles. If they feel like putting an arm around the person they are
talking to, or wearing a panama hat with the brim left to care for itself,
they are going to do so. On the whole, they are extremely simple and
direct in their speech and attitude.
Contrast such men with the student who hopes to be a savant, perhaps
on such meager grounds as the pat on the shoulder by h kind professor
who gives him the one A in his career and predicts great things for him.
And what a rude awakening it will be when he wakes up to find out that
the true scholar is not necessarily found behind the wise expression of a
would-be savant.

There will be a meeting of the Daily staff in the office at 1 o'clock
Monday afternoon. All members of the editorial board, reporters' stall
and business office are requested to attend.
