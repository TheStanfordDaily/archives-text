## CURFEW SHALL NOT RING TONIGHT! 
### 
Our esteemed contemporary, Mr.
Philip Space, in his column elsewhere
in this issue, waxed "poetic" concern
ing the latest Row at Roble. He even
offers a slogan for the embatted
school teacher who, used to telling
Johnny to stay after school or to keep
ing her sister's kids out of the streets
after supper-time, is kept in at nights
by a benevolent Stanford Administra
tion. Curfew Shall Not Ring Tonight!
Mr. Space suggests.

Fat chance! Fat chance of Stanford
women sloganing against anything ex
cept, perhaps, the Question of Crew.
What if you can't go out at night after
10:30, ladies —what are you going to
do about it? You'll take your four
week-night late leaves and like it!
The emancipation of women has at
last put a dainty feminine figure next
to the Satisfied Male in the cigarette
ads, but it hasn't yet extended to those
Independent Oases in a Desert of
Doit*ts —the American Colleges.
Not so long ago Winston Norman,
writing in this very column, raised
the roof, not to mention the lid, when
he called Roble Hall a "Bastille."
Oh no! the girls cried, it's nothing
of the kind! Maybe not. Maybe the

regulations ARB stricter elsewhere.
What of it? The fact has a tendency
to remain that Stanford women are
hemmed in and herded. When they
go out at night, and most of all when
they come in, is not only THEIR busi
ness, but the Administration's. For
haven't fond parents entrusted their
chilldren to the Administration? Sure.
Oh well, Conservative, hold out for
SOME regulations if you want to. We
might agree with you there. But have
a good laugh about elderly women
who are not yet A.B.'s —juniors and
seniors who are at least old enough
to deserve better—getting four late
leaves a quarter for week nights.
Seniors and juniors usually get six
or eight per term, but in the summer
they're all so mixed together it's too
difficult to find what class they belong
to, say the Instigators. Oh no. It's all
too clear what class they belong to.
They're Stanford Women —the justly
famous Five Hundred.
From the windows of Encina you
can see herds of contented sheep,
moving about as they are told to
move. What an object lesson if there
were some grazing ground near Roble!
