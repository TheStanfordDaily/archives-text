## HE LOOKS AT THE NEGRO PROBLEM 
### 
There are always intelligent men
whc feel keenly the negro status —and
will write about it. G. Peyton Westen
baker is one of those men. In the
July number of the American Mer
cury he has written an article called
"A White Man in the South" —a sym
pathetic, comprehensive study of the
value of the negro.

He divides his article into four
parts. In the first he gives an exposi
tion of the white man's attitude to
ward the black, which is that of a
cold, superior reserve. This attitude,
Westenbaker says, lacks the sym
pathy and respect which the negro
most wants. He then gives a few
illustrations to show the cruel treat
ment that the negroes are expected
to undergo.
In the second part he gives the
negro's attitude, which is one of a
cowering outcast. He says frankly
that that which hurts the negro most
is not the treatment he gets in court,
but the realization that his life is a
port of jail sentence, that his color
shuts him off from any real liberty or
social freedom as effectually as prison
bars. "He lies in a primitive African
settlement, next door to civilization,"
and no matter how sympathetic a
white man may feel toward an intelli
gent, cultivated negro—more interest
ing perhaps than his own friends, he
would never invite him to dinner or
bother much about his burden. That
would comprise a certain burden and
"we struggle enough to keep ourselves
—we are learning self-preservation."

In the next part Westenbaker asks,
"What can we do for the down-trod
den darky, if we think it onr duty to
lift him from the mire?" Which, all
in all, when he answers it, amounts to
nothing. Socially we cannot accept
him —or we ourselves shall cease to
he accepted socially. We might write
about him —but the average sort of
person whose opinions we should have
to change, pays no attention to ration
al arguments "They are brought up
on tradition and mass emotion." We
may educate the negro, but that would
make him more keenly sensitive about
his color, and more resentful of the
distinctions which he feels. "An edu
cated negro must live in a strange
and unhappy world of introspection."
Again, there are some Southerners
who feel that the negro is an actual
menace. "Miscegenation is the great
bogie of all Southerners. Many are
eager to ship all negroes back to
Africa, lest the Nordic blood be im
perilled."
Westenbaker summarizes these
statements as an answer for his ques
tions —
"We are capable of appreciating the
negroes' hardships, but we aren't will
ing to end them at our own expense.
Our sympathy is quite impersonal and
has no reason to be anything else."

11l the last part he says that there
have been innumerable reasons ad
duced for the white man's attitude,
but the final answer Is a summary of
all of them Into one general principle —
"that it is a deep instinct in men to
recognize both racial and individual
differences, to emphasize them, and
to magnify them. Man's greatest spur
is his ego. We browbeat the negroes
on the same ground that we join the

Masons and the various imitations of
Masonry. We must be different,
whether individually or collectively."
He concludes his article, then, by
saying that eventually one of three
things will happen to the negroes—
They may, like the Indians, diminish
under pressure of economic need un
til they disappear completely.
Again, they may become adjusted
to a new and more deeply psychologi
cal form of slavery, take the lowest
stratum of society and, like the ro
bots, lose everything but the animal
instinct to work and obey their masters.
Finally, they may keep struggling
up and absorbing our culture until
they reach a position where they can
genuinely challenge our racial mas
tery.
Westenbaker hopes the negroes will
survive our civilization, because he
thinks they may be a stimulus needed
to keep the white race from stagnat
ing in its own comfort. Furthermore
if the negro can take our civilization
away from us, "that will be merely
th 3 survival of the fittest."

Our sympathy is quite impersonal and
has no reason to be anything else."

11l the last part he says that there
have been innumerable reasons ad
duced for the white man's attitude,
but the final answer Is a summary of
all of them Into one general principle —
"that it is a deep instinct in men to
recognize both racial and individual
differences, to emphasize them, and
to magnify them. Man's greatest spur
is his ego. We browbeat the negroes
on the same ground that we join the

Masons and the various imitations of
Masonry. We must be different,
whether individually or collectively."
He concludes his article, then, by
saying that eventually one of three
things will happen to the negroes—
They may, like the Indians, diminish
under pressure of economic need un
til they disappear completely.
Again, they may become adjusted
to a new and more deeply psychologi
cal form of slavery, take the lowest
stratum of society and, like the ro
bots, lose everything but the animal
instinct to work and obey their masters.
Finally, they may keep struggling
up and absorbing our culture until
they reach a position where they can
genuinely challenge our racial mas
tery.
Westenbaker hopes the negroes will
survive our civilization, because he
thinks they may be a stimulus needed
to keep the white race from stagnat
ing in its own comfort. Furthermore
if the negro can take our civilization
away from us, "that will be merely
th 3 survival of the fittest."

There are always intelligent men
whc feel keenly the negro status —and
will write about it. G. Peyton Westen
baker is one of those men. In the
July number of the American Mer
cury he has written an article called
"A White Man in the South" —a sym
pathetic, comprehensive study of the
value of the negro.

He divides his article into four
parts. In the first he gives an exposi
tion of the white man's attitude to
ward the black, which is that of a
cold, superior reserve. This attitude,
Westenbaker says, lacks the sym
pathy and respect which the negro
most wants. He then gives a few
illustrations to show the cruel treat
ment that the negroes are expected
to undergo.
In the second part he gives the
negro's attitude, which is one of a
cowering outcast. He says frankly
that that which hurts the negro most
is not the treatment he gets in court,
but the realization that his life is a
port of jail sentence, that his color
shuts him off from any real liberty or
social freedom as effectually as prison
bars. "He lies in a primitive African
settlement, next door to civilization,"
and no matter how sympathetic a
white man may feel toward an intelli
gent, cultivated negro—more interest
ing perhaps than his own friends, he
would never invite him to dinner or
bother much about his burden. That
would comprise a certain burden and
"we struggle enough to keep ourselves
—we are learning self-preservation."

In the next part Westenbaker asks,
"What can we do for the down-trod
den darky, if we think it onr duty to
lift him from the mire?" Which, all
in all, when he answers it, amounts to
nothing. Socially we cannot accept
him —or we ourselves shall cease to
he accepted socially. We might write
about him —but the average sort of
person whose opinions we should have
to change, pays no attention to ration
al arguments "They are brought up
on tradition and mass emotion." We
may educate the negro, but that would
make him more keenly sensitive about
his color, and more resentful of the
distinctions which he feels. "An edu
cated negro must live in a strange
and unhappy world of introspection."
Again, there are some Southerners
who feel that the negro is an actual
menace. "Miscegenation is the great
bogie of all Southerners. Many are
eager to ship all negroes back to
Africa, lest the Nordic blood be im
perilled."
Westenbaker summarizes these
statements as an answer for his ques

"We are capable of appreciating the
negroes' hardships, but we aren't will

and no matter how sympathetic a
white man may feel toward an intelli
gent, cultivated negro—more interest
ing perhaps than his own friends, he
would never invite him to dinner or
bother much about his burden. That
would comprise a certain burden and
"we struggle enough to keep ourselves
—we are learning self-preservation."

In the next part Westenbaker asks,
"What can we do for the down-trod
den darky, if we think it onr duty to
lift him from the mire?" Which, all
in all, when he answers it, amounts to
nothing. Socially we cannot accept
him —or we ourselves shall cease to
he accepted socially. We might write
about him —but the average sort of
person whose opinions we should have
to change, pays no attention to ration
al arguments "They are brought up
on tradition and mass emotion." We
may educate the negro, but that would
make him more keenly sensitive about
his color, and more resentful of the
distinctions which he feels. "An edu
cated negro must live in a strange
and unhappy world of introspection."
Again, there are some Southerners
who feel that the negro is an actual
menace. "Miscegenation is the great
bogie of all Southerners. Many are
eager to ship all negroes back to
Africa, lest the Nordic blood be im
perilled."
Westenbaker summarizes these
statements as an answer for his ques
tions —
"We are capable of appreciating the
negroes' hardships, but we aren't will
ing to end them at our own expense.
Our sympathy is quite impersonal and
has no reason to be anything else."

11l the last part he says that there
have been innumerable reasons ad
duced for the white man's attitude,
but the final answer Is a summary of
all of them Into one general principle —
"that it is a deep instinct in men to
recognize both racial and individual
differences, to emphasize them, and
to magnify them. Man's greatest spur
is his ego. We browbeat the negroes
on the same ground that we join the

Masons and the various imitations of
Masonry. We must be different,
whether individually or collectively."
He concludes his article, then, by
saying that eventually one of three
things will happen to the negroes—
They may, like the Indians, diminish
under pressure of economic need un
til they disappear completely.
Again, they may become adjusted
to a new and more deeply psychologi
cal form of slavery, take the lowest
stratum of society and, like the ro
bots, lose everything but the animal
instinct to work and obey their masters.
Finally, they may keep struggling
up and absorbing our culture until
they reach a position where they can
genuinely challenge our racial mas
tery.
Westenbaker hopes the negroes will
survive our civilization, because he
thinks they may be a stimulus needed
to keep the white race from stagnat
ing in its own comfort. Furthermore
if the negro can take our civilization
away from us, "that will be merely
th 3 survival of the fittest."
