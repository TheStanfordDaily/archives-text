## WE MUST HAVE OUR ATHLETES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It seems to be quite the style to
criticize athletics at Stanford. In the
editorial column Tuesday the point
was raised that athletics are becom
ing commercialized, that the football
men practice football four quarters a
year, that —"From all over the country
come reports of varsity swimmers who
top off a winter of training and a
spring of competition with a summer
of championship races," that —Stan-
ford tennis players finish off their
winter and spring of team play with
a tour of innumerable eastern and
mid-western tournaments throughout
the summer."
What is the result of all this show
of athletics? In the first place the
athletes are not forced to participate
in the summer. They do it as a recrea
tion. In the second place consider the
goodwill and advertising of the school
resulting from these tours. Then as
for the amount of time put in during
the school year on athletics. What is
the result? For example, consider the
Stanford teams, they are the result
of specialization, they probably have
made the school more widely known
than any other department of the

school in the last few years. The edi
torial deplored the passing of the
"star athlete," why? It tends for bet
ter teams, it gives other men a chance
to make some of the other teams. So
the passing of the "star athlete" or
"monopolist" is a blessing rather than
a curse.
But the whole gist of the article
seems to hit at commercialism of ath
letics in colleges. We clear aboat.
$350,000 a year on football.
Well let's consider this revenue.
Where does it come from? —people
who want to see the football games,
they are not coerced into buying
tickets. Where does the money go?—
into gymnasiums, swimming pools,
athletic equipment, a golf course, for
buildings, medical advisors, and edu
cational projects—absolutely useless,
isn't it?
The man who pays $5 for a football
ticket gets his money's worth in satis
faction out of the game itself, and
then he has the added satisfaction of
contributing about $4 for educational
and hygiene purposes.
And as for the pipe courses offered
to athletes, well I'm no athlete but
I would sure like to connect with some
of them myself. —Don.
