## 
### 
Stanford's distinguished guests from
the East, Coach "Biff" Jones and Ath
letic Manager Major Fleming, of West
Point, who are on the coast to Belect
a training grounds for the Army foot
ball team next fall, seemed to agree
by their words of admiration that,
next to West Point, Stanford is the
ideal school.
Guided by A1 Masters, Graduate
Manager, the Easterners spent most
of Tuesday inspecting the campus. In
the afternoon the party visited Santa
Clara College. Yesterday Jones and
Fleming went to Moraga to examine
the Saint Mary's College grounds.
They were entertained last night
by the Family Club in San Francisco.
