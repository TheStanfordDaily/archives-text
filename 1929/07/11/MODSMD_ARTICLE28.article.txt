Rummaging around has its rewards.
If we hadn't cleaned up that pantry
yesterday we might never have come
across this gem of Vox Populi, from
the "Safety Valve" column of the
San Francisco Chronicle:
TRAINING TWIG AS TREE
SHOULD INCLINE
Editor The Chronicle — Sir:
"Child Delinquency Problem":
Having raised three sons and a
daughter practically alone and
feeling the responsibility of moth
erhood for which there would be
an accounting, and not that "chil
dren are sent from God and he
would look after them but just to
bear them," as is taught to young
maidens by their ministers in the
schoolroom —to which the public
is excluded —I studied the child
and I found my most truthful boy
developed into the most untruth
ful of all when after 35, and when
I asked him how-come he told me
I was dead wrong in my teach
ings, if he told the truth on all
occasions he would be hung. Take
bootlegging: there are curtained
windows, from the door comes the
smell of rankest beer, etc., yet if
asked, should you tell the truth
you would be knocked over the
head with a brick.

Glancing through the files, one of
the Stanford Daily's invaluable new
stories (advt.) informs us that a bit
of verse from the Stanford Literary
Magazine is "almost pure poetry."
Some of the stories, too", are almost
pure.

A student is a sponge sitting in a
wet place called Education.

NEWS ITEM: All women students
who are not graduates will be allowed
only four week-night 10:30 "late
leaves." This supplants the usual sys
tem where freshmen (the only gain
ers) ordinarily get two late leaves,
the sophomores four, the juniors six,
and the seniors eight.
The Roble Powers That Be, whose
sway
O'er Stanford women reeks with
Power
Have cut the chance to disobey
A chaste and seemly bedtime hour.
But these same Powers, ever-wise,
Anticipate a lively fight.
For, 10, the woim has toined, and
cries—
"The curfew shall not ring tonight!"
