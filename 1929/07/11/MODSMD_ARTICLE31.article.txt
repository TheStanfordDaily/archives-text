# DAVIS SELECTS DRAMAS BY BEHRMAN, CHAPEK TO FOLLOW 'ADDING MACHINE'
## 
### 
Three modern plays, widely varied
in type and cosmopolitan in selection,
constitute the summer dramatics pro
gram. Gordon Davis, director of dra
matics, in planning the series, has en
deavored to bring variety into the
season by choosing plays which differ
in style of production as well as in
nationality.
"The Adding Machine," to be pre
sented tomorrow night, is a powerful,
expressionistic American drama by
Elmer Rice, the author of this year's
Pulitzer Prize play, "Street Scene."
"The Adding Machine" is an extreme
ly modernistic play, stylized in ac
tion, with deliberate distortion to ex
press the one main idea. Because of
this feature, it is a play which offers
a number of difficult problems to both
director and actors. The variety and
range of the seven scenes, all expres
sionistic in type, gives the technical
director wonderful opportunity to sup
plement the ideas of the play with
scenery.
"Second Man" Planned
Two weeks from tomorrow night,
"The Second Man," a modern high
comedy by S. N. Behrman, appears on
the Stanford stage, which, incidentally
will be the first amateur production
of this clever play. Though of Ameri
can origin, this crisp comedy is typical
of the English style. Modern nervous

tension, sophistication, suavity and
polish are felt throughout the comedy.
Despite the delightful lightness of
treatment, there is a serious side of
the play—as Davis says, "it is a com
edy which offers food for thought."
Its universal appeal is evident by the
popular reception it was given wher
ever it was presented by the Theatre
Guild on tour last year.

Because of the difficulty of the role,
Gordon Davis will assume the part of
"Clark Storey," the leading character.
There are but three other members
in the complete cast, which, by the
way, is the smallest the Stanford
stage has ever known. However, the
limited number of roles is an aid to
the brilliancy, speed, and clearness
which characterize this comedy.
Chapek Play Follows
"The Makropoulos Secret," by Karel
Chapek, to be produced August 16,
will be the final presentation. This
drama is by the same Czecho-Slova
kian playwright who wrote "R.U.R."
and "The World We Live In." It is a
tense "drama of ideas," the theme of
which deals with longevity. The secret
ofi extending one's lifetime is dis
covered by a grand opera singer who
attains the miraculous age of 367
years. Many amusing and ironic com
plications occur as the result of this
discovery, with the plot eventually
leading to a tensely dramatic climax.

deavored to bring variety into the
season by choosing plays which differ
in style of production as well as in
nationality.
"The Adding Machine," to be pre
sented tomorrow night, is a powerful,
expressionistic American drama by
Elmer Rice, the author of this year's
Pulitzer Prize play, "Street Scene."
"The Adding Machine" is an extreme
ly modernistic play, stylized in ac
tion, with deliberate distortion to ex
press the one main idea. Because of
this feature, it is a play which offers
a number of difficult problems to both
director and actors. The variety and
range of the seven scenes, all expres
sionistic in type, gives the technical
director wonderful opportunity to sup
plement the ideas of the play with
scenery.
"Second Man" Planned
Two weeks from tomorrow night,
"The Second Man," a modern high
comedy by S. N. Behrman, appears on
the Stanford stage, which, incidentally
will be the first amateur production
of this clever play. Though of Ameri
can origin, this crisp comedy is typical
of the English style. Modern nervous

tension, sophistication, suavity and
polish are felt throughout the comedy.
Despite the delightful lightness of
treatment, there is a serious side of
the play—as Davis says, "it is a com
edy which offers food for thought."
Its universal appeal is evident by the
popular reception it was given wher
ever it was presented by the Theatre
Guild on tour last year.

Because of the difficulty of the role,
Gordon Davis will assume the part of
"Clark Storey," the leading character.
There are but three other members
in the complete cast, which, by the
way, is the smallest the Stanford
stage has ever known. However, the
limited number of roles is an aid to
the brilliancy, speed, and clearness
which characterize this comedy.
Chapek Play Follows
"The Makropoulos Secret," by Karel
Chapek, to be produced August 16,
will be the final presentation. This
drama is by the same Czecho-Slova
kian playwright who wrote "R.U.R."
and "The World We Live In." It is a
tense "drama of ideas," the theme of
which deals with longevity. The secret
ofi extending one's lifetime is dis
covered by a grand opera singer who
attains the miraculous age of 367
years. Many amusing and ironic com
plications occur as the result of this
discovery, with the plot eventually
leading to a tensely dramatic climax.
Three modern plays, widely varied
in type and cosmopolitan in selection,
constitute the summer dramatics pro
gram. Gordon Davis, director of dra
matics, in planning the series, has en
deavored to bring variety into the
season by choosing plays which differ
in style of production as well as in
nationality.
