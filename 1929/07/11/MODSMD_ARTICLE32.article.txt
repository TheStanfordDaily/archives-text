By request, the exhibition of oil

Seideneck was originally a portrait
artist, but has taken up the painting
of landscapes. After studying at the
Smith Academy and Art Institute of
Chicago, at the school of Walter Thor
in Munich, and at the Royal Academy
of Munich under Professor Carl von
Marr, he spent several years on paint
ing trips through Europe. Most of his
paintings in the present exhibit were
made on a recent visit to Germany

and Italy. Besides paintings, some pen
and-ink drawings made by Seideneck
are on display. These drawings are
suitable for reproduction in wood cut
prints.
Catherine Seideneck worked and
studied in the Roycroft Shops of El
bert Hubbard in East Aurora, N.Y.
Later she studied and then taught at
the California School of Fine Arts in
Berkeley.
