# WAR-TIME PSYCHOLOGY IS STUDENT HANDICAP, WESTERGAARD BELIEF
## German Language Abolition From Schools Prevents Scientific Work 
### 
"American students undertaking
graduate work are handicapped be
cause they are often victims of war
time psychology," believes Dr. Walde
mar Westergaard, acting professor of
history. "Abolition of instruction in
the German language in our second
ary schools and in many of our col
leges and universities has prevented
tho successful pursuit of most
branches of scientific knowledge."

Professor Westergaard recalled an
Instance where knowledge of German
saved the day for a group of his
torians from various nations. "Last
summer I attended a great historical
congress in Oslo, Norway," he said.
"A number of French historians spoke
an English not much better than my
French, and we soon found that we
could get on very nicely in the lan
guage of our one-time enemies.
Australia Bars Former Enemies
"Again, Australia stood in the way
of a study of the physical features of
that continent, to be conducted by a
distinguished Vienna geologist. The
government forbade any citizen of a
former enemy country entering the
continent until the close of 1926."
A queer angle on the language situa
tion was the attitude of the French
and the Germans, themselves. During
the war, each country kept right on
studying the others' language when
the fighting was hottest, according to
Professor Westergaard.

"Our young people are just as capa
ble of scholarly work as those of
Europe," he says. "But they are
greatly handicapped by the prohibi
tion of the teaching of German and
French. It is a bit disconcerting for a
bright American student, who lias
made what he hopes is an original
study of an important problem, to
learn just when he is about to publish
his results, that a German or French
scholar has done the job already and
better than he has." This situation
will be remedied, believes Professor

Wcstergaard, if languages such as
French and German, are allowed to be
universally taught.
Many Leaders Acted Stupidly
Looking back on the actions of lead
ers during the war, Professor Wester
gaard considers many of them
"stupid." "One city council in Cali
fornia actually ordered its city li
brarian to intern all books dealing
with German history, including bio
graphies of Bismarck written by Brit
ish historians," said Westergaard.
Professor Westergaard comes to
Stanford for the summer quarter from
U.C.L.A. He has been a collector in
Sweden for the Hoover War Library,
has done research work in Vienna
and Copenhagen, and is now a student
of Northern European contemporary
history.
