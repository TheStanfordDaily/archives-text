# Thirty-Five Tons Of Coal Purchased By University
## 
### 
Making hay while the sun shines
is a proverb, but the purchase of
thirty-five tons of Utah's soft coal in
the middle of July is higher finance.

Regardless of the fine points of
finance, however, the storage depart
ment of the Corporation Yards has
received enough fuel in the consign
ment on the siding near the library,
to meet the requirements for nearly
a year. In connection with the weather,
it might be well to add that the coal's
commercial title is "Hi-Heat."
