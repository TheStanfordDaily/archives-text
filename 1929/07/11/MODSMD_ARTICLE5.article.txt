# Goossens to Lecture On Campus Following Hillsborough Concert
## 
### 
Stanford University will have the
opportunity of hearing a lecture by
one of the world's most eminent musi
cal directors. Eugene Goossens, com
poser, pianist, violinist, and director,
will speak here Wednesday, July 17.
His subject will be "Contemporary
Music." The lecture will take place in
the clubroom of Toyon Hall at 4:15
in the afternoon, and is free to the
public.
Goossens, conductor of the Roches
ter Philharmonic Orchestra, has come
seven thousand miles in order to di
rect his rehearsals with the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra for his con
cert in the Woodland Theatre July 14
â€”his first appearance in Northern
California. The young composer-con
ductor came directly from London
where his one-act opera "Judith" has
just been given its world premier.

An indication of Goossen's popular
ity is that following his engagements
here he will go immediately to the
Hollywood Bowl for his fourth con
secutive season as guest conductor.
No other director has played four suc
cessive years.
Goossen's program includes two
novelties never heard here before. The
orchestral arrangement of Stravinsky's
"Petrouchka" and "The Three Cor
nered Hat" of De Falla will make up
the last half of the program. Preceding
these will be Brahms' Symphony No.
2 in D major.
