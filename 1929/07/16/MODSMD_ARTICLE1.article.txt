# PHILOSOPHY NEAR CRISIS, VIEW OF VIENNA TEACHER
## Dr. Moritz Schlick to Talk Tonight in Little Theatre On "Future of Philosophy" Lecturer Will Trace Change In Study; Misconception Of Modern Scholars Hit 
### 
That philosophy is not a study of a
certain field but an "attitude" toward
all life and science will be the stand
taken by Dr. Moritz Schlick, visiting
professor of philosophy from the Uni
versity of Vienna, when he speaks in
the Little Theatre tonight on "The
Future of Philosophy."
In his short talk, beginning at 8
o'clock, Dr. Schlick will endeavor to
show that during the past century a
wrong idea of the subject of philo
sophy has developed throughout the
world.
"The ancients believed that a philo
sopher was a man who had a certain
attitude toward life and science. He
was not a scholar who had studied
one field of knowledge," explains the
Austrian philosopher. The modern
misconception of the student of this
ancient subject is that he is devoted
to one field. "This is absolutely false,"
adds Dr. Schlick, "as philosophy is
not restricted to one field like other
sciences."
A crisis in this study is approach
ing and soon a simpler view of philo
sophy will come, believes Dr. Schlick.
There will then be a change in the
interpretation of the subject and a

more general conception of what a
philosophical problem includes.

Dr. Schlick, as acting professor, is
teaching at Stanford for the first time,
and will return to Vienna in the fall
to resume his professorship there.
