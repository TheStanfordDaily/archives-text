# "Adding Machine" Is Applauded; Gould Scores Hit As Mr. Zero
## 
### Ted Krough 
The audience which witnessed "The
Adding Machine" Friday night was a
pleased one —pleased by the excellence
of the play, by the clever effectiveness
of the settings, and by some very pro
fessional acting. Under the capable
directorship of Gordon Davis, this ex
tremely successful production of the
expressionistic Elmer Rice drama
opened the summer season of campus
dramatics.
Moving rapidly from start to finish,
without a dull moment, the play was
one which offered unusual variety in
situations and scenic effects, as well
as a number of pleasing innovations
in stage technique. Even though many
may have missed the author's rather
subtle message, the drama was so
delightfully modern and so filled with
the unusual that it was decidedly
worthwhile.
Burnell Gould, as Mr. Zero, not only
carried his part to perfection but also
practically carried the play from bis
first appearance to the end. He gave
excellent interpretation to the role,
portraying Mr. Zero in the many moods
in which he appears throughout the
play. Equally well was he as the down
trodden, slaving office clerk and as
the happy, carefree boyish soul which
finally reached the Elysian Fields.
Miss June Clemmons as Daisy Diana
Dorothea Devore played her rather
strenuous part well, particularly in
the office scene. Considering the fact
that he had but a week of rehearsal,
Tom Henry, as Lieutenant Charles,
tarried his forceful role quite effec
tively. Margaret Watts, as Mr. Zero's
super-talkative wife, opened the play

very well with her monologue in the
first scene, but later in the play her
acting seemed more or less of an ef
fort. Though Dorothy Tully's part as
Judy O'Grady was a minor one, she
very successfully exemplified the "Hat
rack" character of the play. Howard
Addlestone did a fine piece of acting
as the righteous mother's boy who
suddenly cut his mother's throat, and
spent his time worrying because his
punishment was not severe enough.

Other members of the cast who
contributed to the success of the pro
duction were Virgil Anderson as a
head in the graveyard scene. C. J.
Mattox as Mr. Zero's unappreciative
boss, Robert Kirkwood as a young
man for whom graveyards had no at
traction, and Bromley K. Smith, as
Joe, an assistant in the shipping de
partment of the soul factory. The
Mesdames and Messieurs One, Two,
Three, Four, Five, and Six were
Muriel Mitchell and Boyd Homewood,
Vera Scott and Carl McDowell, Anna
bel Wolf and Walter Kaulfers, Annie
Crane and Charles Wade, Benetta
Merner and Cecil Doll, and Elizabeth
Boynton and G. F. Olsen. The mechan
ical party scene was well-liked.
Harold Helvenston, technical direc
tor, caught the spirit of the play in
his fantastic interpretations of the
seven scenes. Particularly impressive
were the weird graveyard scene, and
the bright, cheerful, flower-strewn
Elysian Fields. Each setting carried
a distinct atmosphere which materially
aided in creating the desired effect,
and though very simple and modern
istic in design they significantly
I served their purpose.

may have missed the author's rather
subtle message, the drama was so
delightfully modern and so filled with
the unusual that it was decidedly
worthwhile.
Burnell Gould, as Mr. Zero, not only
carried his part to perfection but also
practically carried the play from bis
first appearance to the end. He gave
excellent interpretation to the role,
portraying Mr. Zero in the many moods
in which he appears throughout the
play. Equally well was he as the down
trodden, slaving office clerk and as
the happy, carefree boyish soul which
finally reached the Elysian Fields.
Miss June Clemmons as Daisy Diana
Dorothea Devore played her rather
strenuous part well, particularly in
the office scene. Considering the fact
that he had but a week of rehearsal,
Tom Henry, as Lieutenant Charles,
tarried his forceful role quite effec
tively. Margaret Watts, as Mr. Zero's
super-talkative wife, opened the play

very well with her monologue in the
first scene, but later in the play her
acting seemed more or less of an ef
fort. Though Dorothy Tully's part as
Judy O'Grady was a minor one, she
very successfully exemplified the "Hat
rack" character of the play. Howard
Addlestone did a fine piece of acting
as the righteous mother's boy who
suddenly cut his mother's throat, and
spent his time worrying because his
punishment was not severe enough.

Other members of the cast who
contributed to the success of the pro
duction were Virgil Anderson as a
head in the graveyard scene. C. J.
Mattox as Mr. Zero's unappreciative
boss, Robert Kirkwood as a young
man for whom graveyards had no at
traction, and Bromley K. Smith, as
Joe, an assistant in the shipping de
partment of the soul factory. The
Mesdames and Messieurs One, Two,
Three, Four, Five, and Six were
Muriel Mitchell and Boyd Homewood,
Vera Scott and Carl McDowell, Anna
bel Wolf and Walter Kaulfers, Annie
Crane and Charles Wade, Benetta
Merner and Cecil Doll, and Elizabeth
Boynton and G. F. Olsen. The mechan
ical party scene was well-liked.
Harold Helvenston, technical direc
tor, caught the spirit of the play in
his fantastic interpretations of the
seven scenes. Particularly impressive
were the weird graveyard scene, and
the bright, cheerful, flower-strewn
Elysian Fields. Each setting carried
a distinct atmosphere which materially
aided in creating the desired effect,
and though very simple and modern
istic in design they significantly
I served their purpose.
The audience which witnessed "The
Adding Machine" Friday night was a
pleased one —pleased by the excellence
of the play, by the clever effectiveness
of the settings, and by some very pro
fessional acting. Under the capable
directorship of Gordon Davis, this ex
tremely successful production of the
expressionistic Elmer Rice drama
opened the summer season of campus
dramatics.
Moving rapidly from start to finish,
without a dull moment, the play was
one which offered unusual variety in
situations and scenic effects, as well
as a number of pleasing innovations
in stage technique. Even though many
may have missed the author's rather
subtle message, the drama was so
