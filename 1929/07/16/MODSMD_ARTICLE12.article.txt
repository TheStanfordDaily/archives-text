# STANFORD WILL NOT BAR TALKIE CAMERAS AT FOOTBALL GAMES
## 
### 
"Talkie" moving picture apparatus
will not be barred from the Stanford
Stadium during the coming football
season.
The Board of Athletic Control will
not follow the policies of Harvard and
other eastern colleges in prohibiting
the sound recording of athletic func
tions in the stadiums. The objection
was to "obstruction" by the extensive
apparatus required by the talking pic
ture cameramen.
To deny the admission of "talkie"
cameramen would be discourteous as
well as a move to kill valuable pub
licity for the University over the most
popular medium now in use, accord
ing to Alfred E. Masters, Board of
Athletic Control manager. The ruling
that all cameramen, including profes
sionals, must remain off the field, will,
asserts Masters, be followed as usual.
"If the sound-recording apparatus in
any way obstructs the aisles, however,
the privilege will be denied or addi
tional rulings be made.
"If all colleges prohibited the
'talkie' companies from recording the
games it would be a great handicap
to the moving picture industry," Mas
ters added. "It is evident that com
panies filming college movies are de
pendent upon actual stadium scenes
and realistic playing for effective re
sults."
