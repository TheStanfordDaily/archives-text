# The 						Graveyard Was Crowded
## 
### 
It was a pretty crowded graveyard, wasn't it?
We are talking about the spooky cemetery that was contracted into
the confines of the Assembly Hall stage for "The Adding Machine"
Friday night. Think what the scene might have been if there had been
room to make the sets as they ought to have been made.. Harold Helven
ston and his aids did wonders with the cramped space they had at their
disposal and the actors by mincing their stride helped to conceal the
limitations, but still nobody can call the Stanford stage adequate to the
things that Stanford stage craftsmen and Stanford actors could do if
they had a fair chance.
And the audience, too. . . . Some of them may have been forced
to be too wholly audience—that is hearers —if they were unfortunate
enough to have side seats from which they could not see all that was
going on on their side of the stage.
Now, the first office scene—that is the sort of thing best suited to
the Assembly Hall stage: right square in the middle. Everybody could
see that and the actors didn't have to move in the may architectural
drawings are scaled: one inch representing a foot.
Those of you who saw your first Stanford dramatic performance
Friday night can sympathize heartily now with all other Stanford stu
dents, whose continuing hope is for a better, more suitable Stanford
theatre.
The old Assembly I [all has been revamped and altered and improved
and made over, from time to time, ever since it was built, until there
is nothing more that can be done to make it better. It is a monument
to the devoted efforts of past generations to turn it into a real theatre.
But it can't be done. The old Assembly Hall is a graveyard of futile
attempts to do something that can't be done.
The only thing now is a wholly new theatre, and so present genera
tions of students are putting their efforts into creating a fund which
sometime may become big enough to pay for the building that Stanford
needs for its dramatics.
Speed the day!
