# Oh, Well, If You're Satisfied...

We seem to gather that not all the residents of Roble welcome the
words of sympathy and implications of warm-hearted eagerness to see
them happily freed from hampering regulations. That certainly is onr
inferennce from the communications that have been slapped into our
office and which we print today.
Have a heart, ladies. Stop saying those cutting things to our very
faces. We didn't start it. We just took what was told us and, all aglow
with the warmth of good-fellowship, we backed up the Roble residents
who said they did think some matters of late leaves could be improved,
considering the maturiey of judgment of some of the women upon whom
the restrictions were laid.
But if these young women who have written to us since then don't
object to the rules or don't care one way or the other, because they don't
want to go out anyway, why it's all right with us. They can stay in for
all we care. Our knight errantry is exclusively for the fair damsels who
appreciate our efforts in their behalf.
And if all Roble feels as do those whose letters appear today, why
we're through; that's all; we're through. The trouble is that apparently
not all Roble does feel that way. Even so, the Daily is not running any
"campaign." We suspect that Roble can take carc of itself. We merely
express our sympathy with those who want our sympathy and deserve it.
Any who don't deserve it or who do not want it can leave it lying cold
and clammy on their doorstep.
