# FRATERNITY LOSSES LAID TO NEED FOR BURGLAR WARNINGS
## 
### 
Calling attention to the need of a
general burglar alarm system on the
campus, several fraternity houses
were robbed last Saturday morning
between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. The robbery
was first discovered by H. C. Cole at
5 o'clock at the Beta Theta Pi house,
but since there was no one to answer
telephone calls at the other houses,
and no general alarm system, there
â– was no way to catch the burglar at
another of his stopping points. The
police department, however, was im
mediately notified.

At the Beta house C. J. Owens,
H. C. Cole, and K. Bird lost watches,
and $60 in change was taken from
various members. Dan Di lullo, Theta
Delta Chi, lost a wallet containing $15,
and the Kappa Alpha and Sigma Chi
houses reported losses. Detectives are
working on a clue and expect to arrest
the maurauder soon.

A policeman in Portland, Me., has
a pig which he has trained to dig
clams.
