# Welcome To The Secretaries' School
## 
### 
There is another student body on the campus this week, and the
members of the more continuous Stanford organization extend greetings
and a hearty welcome to the members of the Western School of Com
mercial Secretaries. We could wish that they were to be here more
than a week an dthat the week were not so fully occupied with the
activities of their school that they will have little chance to visit around
over the rest of the campus.
But if they want to be like some of the rest of us and cut a class
now an dthen we are sure they will run across somebody who will be
glad to tell them where Hoover's home is, where the old bridge used to
be, and where the golf course is going to be—all points of interest in
this academic scene.
Or if they are interested in less important matters we will direct
them to the lecture rooms of some of our most impressive faculty
members and tell them what is in the library, and let them try and find it.
Whatever they want, we'll be glad to help them try to get it if they
will let us know, for we fant them to have as good a time as can be
crowded into their brief stay on the Stanford Farm.
Of course we hope that they will gain the knowledge that is the
purpose of their school, for the benefit of their home towns, but we do
not stress that because it is certain. Really it is because the secretaries'
school has a significant purpose that we sincerely welcome them to
Stanford.
