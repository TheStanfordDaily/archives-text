## It Really Couldn't be Helped AT THE CURRAN THEATRE "LITTLE ACCIDENT" 
### 
What if it is supposed to be light
midsummer souffl6? Nine-tenths of
its lines would draw laughs in the
dead of winter. "Little Accident,"
which opened Sunday night, effec
tively sweeps the audience up in three
rapid acts of hilarity. And for three
days later the laughs continue. "Why,
remember in the second act when . . ."
One hesitates to think what might
have happened if it weren't for
Thomas Mitchell. Mitchell, with
Floyd Dell, wrote the play, staged it,
and took the leading role. As Nor
man, he appears on the morning of
his wedding—after a night of rather
heavy celebration. Then, with a head
made seemingly of lead and a tongue
of velvet, he learns he has become a
parent. A bit embarrassing, especially
on one's wedding day.
Against the vehement wishes of his

excellent best man, he goes to
the Chicago maternity hospital—to
show "a strong moral sense." And in
Chicago he is swept up in a glorious
jam, with the mother of his child and
his fiancees—two now, and Norman
Jr. By the middle of the third act,
one sees that the problem is the selec
tion of a wife for Norman. Go ahead
—try to figure it out for yourself.
"Little Accident" is a marvel of
constant embarrassment, with Thomas
Mitchell a master in the art of blush
ing, stuttering, cussing—and becoming
more embarrassed.
Isabel Raises Havoc
Madge, fiancee number one, and
Montica, number two, play consider
able damage on Norman's sense of
responsibilities. But not as much as
Isabel —well, "you don't know Isabel!"
And the best scene. The waiting
room of a maternity hospital, with
three husbands "expecting," and all
standing the arrival in great form.
