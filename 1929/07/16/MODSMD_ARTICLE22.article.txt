# Goossens Makes Debut At Woodland Concert
## 
### 
Johannes Brahms' Symphony No. 2,
in D Major, served as an admirable
introduction of Eugene Goossens to
peninsula music-lovers last Sunday.
The guest conductor of the San Mateo
Philharmonic symphony orchestra dis
played in no small measure the many
reasons for his well-founded popular
ity at Hollywood Bowl concerts.
The charming melodic quietness of
the opening of Brahms' pastoral
proved an excellent beginning for the
tumultuous final movement in which
strings and wood-winds rose to a
great height of exultation.
Throughout the orchestral suite
from Stravinsky's ballet Petrouclika,
the underlying misery of the Russian
people could not be concealed by the
seemingly comic lightness of the Len
ingrad Mardi Gras. Stravinsky insert
ed into the more classic ballet music
as no other composer could do, the
animated clowning of the visitors to
the fair, their laughing exuberance
in their crude folk-dances, and in the
antics of their entertainers. The me
lodious discordes of the barrel-organs
competing in friendly rivalry, the en
trance of the lumbering bear —a tuba,
and his peasant master —two strident

clarinets, and the dance of the three
marionettes provided a colorful back
ground for Petrouclika's love and his
death at the hands of the enraged
Moor.
Another ballet suite, this from The
Three-Cornered Hat by Manuel de
Falla, modern Spanish master, was a
brilliant conclusion to Goossen's Wood
land debut. In the third movement
the strings aroused the audience to
a pitch of intense excitement in a
gradual rise to the triumphant burst
at the end.
