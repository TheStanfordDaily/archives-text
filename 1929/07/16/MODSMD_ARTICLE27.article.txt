## Three On The Same Line! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The utter lack of understanding of
the subject written about was evi
denced by the articles concerning the
so-called "Roble Row" recently ap
pearing in the Stanford Daily. Since
the "elderly women who are not yet
A.B.'s," as well as the mature gradu
ate students, are the ones who are
supposed to be under the awful afflic
tion of co-operating with dormitory
regulations, would it not be well to
really know their feeling in the mat
ter?
During the summer quarter no
graduate women are required to live
at Roble, but all women, graduate as
well as undergraduate, are given the
privilege of so doing. A few of the
mature students to whom living in a
dormitory was a new venture may

have expected hotel service and privi
leges and felt the urge of voicing
their complaints about regulations
they did not understand. However, the
great majority of the summer resi
dents of Roble are serenely uncon
scious of being "hemmed in and
herded." Perhaps dates are lacking or
the return to childhood regulations
unconsciously supplies a renewal of
youth. Or perhaps, is it possible that
these women are finding a happier
satisfaction in making valuable friend
ships in the cheerful cosmopolitan at
mosphere of the dormitory, and in
companionship with books, than they
would find in frequent midnight roam
ings?
Yours very sincerely,
A Matron Undergraduate
A Stanford Alumnus
A Visiting Postgraduate
