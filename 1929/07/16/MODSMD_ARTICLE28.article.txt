# "Strength Is As The Strength Of Ten"

The Editor, Sir:
And some people say that the days
of knightly chivalry are past. Let
such but look to our men of Stanford
and watch the shade of Sir Gallahad
grow pale with shame. No sorrowing
damsel e'er calls in vain. Just one
little peep and the men are rushing
to her aid, no matter what dangers
they may encounter in the form of
the Committee of Five or even the
formidable Administration. Of course
they can't really do anything, but they
do give such wonderful advice. If,
perchance, none of the Five Hundred
discover that they need rescuing, then

the brave men will obligingly start,
the wailing for them, as witness in
the case of last fall's sorority confab
of which the men so proudly remind
us. Or maybe the women aren't doing
their part. Maybe they should have
decided what the men's eating clubs
should rightfully be asked to pay, or
perhaps a resolution from the women
on the subject of naughty language in
the rooting sections would have been
most helpful.
Anyway, I think it is just too sweet
of the men to be so willing to tell us
timid sheep just where we should go.
