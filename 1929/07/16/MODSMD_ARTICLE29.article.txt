# AMERICANISM SPOILS PARIS, CHARGE OF GUERARD IN ARTICLE
## Skyscrapers, Chewing Gum Threaten Peace, Charm Of French Capital

"Paris is a Lady with a Past"
The present mellow charm of the
French capital, indissolvably a part
of her past, is threatened by Ameri
canism.
"Wall Street? The Place de la Con
corde? Which will represent 'The Fu
ture of Paris'?"
Albert Gu6rard, professor of Gen
eral Literature at Stanford, in the
July issue of the Atlantic Monthly,
has tersely placed before the Ameri
can people the problems that confront
contemporary Paris.
Future Concerns U.S.
The city's future immediately con
cerns us, he declares, for in the
French capital is found a charm and
beauty that has become the common
heritage of the world, and Americans
are made responsible for the changes
that are encroaching upon the Paris
of tradition.
The tourist is not objectionable.
But the traffic jam, the subway, and
the hectic, nerve-jangling unrestraint
that properly belongs to New York
City, alarms those lover of the City
who cherish her quiet dignity and re
fined joy of living.
City Is Antiquated
Construction ceased with the Second
Empire under the assumption that
Paris was the most beautiful city on
earth. The consequences of these fifty
years of apathy are palpable, Gu6rard
believes. The city is antiquated and
congested. A vast suburban zone has
grown haphazard, unsanitary, bearing
the imprint of the dishonest specu
lator. Paris must remain a vast center
of trade and hectic amusement, but,
unless drastic measures are adopted,
the mellow charm it once offered to
all will be gone forever.
To maintain the harmony and grace
of the city Mr. Gu6rard suggests that
a limit of skyscrapers to seventy feet
be enforced, that a constructive pro
gram of modernization be inaugurated,
that "the Future of Paris" be an out
growth of the Past of Paris.
Despite automobiles, there are still
50.000 horses in New York.
