## 
### 
The latest thing in colleges!
Memories of the hectic adven
tures of the floating universities
faded as a "Motor College" from
Salisbury, North Carolina, rolled
onto the Stanford campus Sun
day. A caravan of six buses and
13 private cars including a diner,
comprise the classrooms of this
traveling university, sponsored
by Catawba College of Salisbury,
North Carolina.
The group of 110 students and
teachers are visiting 23 United
States colleges. Stanford was the
thirteenth in line.
The courses offered by this
novel school, the first extension
university on wheels â€”consists of
work in plant ecology, geology,
geography, educational psycho
logy, and hygiene.
While at Stanford the group
visited the home of President
Hoover. "We wanted to see the
home of the only Republican
North Carolina evah supported
in a presidential election," they
said.
"Stanford is the prettiest col
lege we have visited," the South
erners said.
