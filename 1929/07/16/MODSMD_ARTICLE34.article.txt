# DENTISTS' BARBECUE CLOSES CONFERENCE OF COAST DELEGATES
## Triennial Meeting Attracts Members From Seven Western States 
### 
A huge barbecue was held Friday
at the Stanford Stadium to close the
week of entertainment extended by
the dentists of San Francisco to the
delegates attending the second Pacific
Coast Dental Conference.
The first conference was held at
Portland in 1926. The next will be at
Seattle in 1932, the conference meeting
every three years. Seven states are
represented: Washington, Oregon,
California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and
New Mexico. About 1250 delegates
were in attendance at this last con
ference.
A special organ recital was given
from the Stanford Memorial Church
over the public address system at the
Stadium by Warren D. Allen, univer
sity organist, and speeches were made
by the mayor of Palo Alto and others
officiating.
Approximately 1100 dentists and
their wives were present, munching
pie and chewing barbecued lamb to
the tune of music and speeches. The
amount of food consumed was greatly
Increased by officers of the San Fran
cisco and local traffic squads, who
were there in abundance and laugh
ingly lent a helping hand to the forty
odd serving people who could not quite
keep the supply balanced with the
demand.
It may be of interest to hungry
Stanfordites to know that 37 sheep,
250 lbs. of beans, 100 gal. of coffee,
SO gal. of ice cream, 450 pies, and
innumerable buns were consumed.
