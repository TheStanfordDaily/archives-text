# MAINE EDUCATOR RAPS DEARTH OF POSITIVE STUDENT CONVICTION
## 
### 
Lack of positive intellectual convic
tions on worthwhile subjects is the

most serious criticism that may be
brought against college students to
day, in the opinion of Dean James S.
Stevens of the University of Maine.
He goes so far as to quote an author
who says that "if Abraham Lincoln
had received a college education he
never would have signed the Emanci
pation Proclamation since he would
not have been quite sure that it was
the right thing to do."

Commenting on this opinion, the
Daily lowan says that ignorance is
more desirable than uncertainty, if
such uncertainty persists after a close
analysis of the problem. "A univer
sity education should develop a stu
dent," says the lowan, "but its value
is negative if it leaves him without a
mind of his own."

Perhaps the moat meandering
stream in the world is the River Jor
dan which wanders 220 miles in cov
ering 60.
