# COLLEGE STUDENTS 'QUITTERS' CLAIM OF YALE DIVINITY DEAN
## 
### 
"Few forces on any college campus
work for Christian living," said Dr.
Charles Reynolds Brown in his ser
mon on "Religious Quitters" at the
Chapel Sunday.
"A great number of college students
are religious quitters," he said. "They
come from families which have given
them a good religious background,
but when they get to college they
'drift with the current, which seems
to be away from the church."

Dr. Brown also stated that in his
belief it is not individuals alone that
lack character today, but that there
are a great many "victories yet to be
won in the national life of the whole
world." He suggested that industry
be humanized, and that education's
end should be the development of the
spirit.
Dr. Brown, now Dean of the Yale
Divinity School, was formerly a lec
turer at Stanford in Ethics, and a pas
tor of the First Congregational
Church, in Oakland. He preached the
Baccalaureate sermon here for the
class of 1899, and is now filling the
pulpit of the Chapel for the month of
July.
