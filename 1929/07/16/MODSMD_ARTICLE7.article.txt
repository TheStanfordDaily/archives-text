# Goossens to Speak On Contemporary Music at Toyon Tomorrow
## 
### 
Eugene Goossens, who made his
first appearance as musical director
in Northern California last Sunday
afternoon at the Woodland Theatre
as guest conductor of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, will lec
ture on "Contemporary Music" at 4:15
o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the
clubroom of Toyon Hall.

Goossens ranks as one of the most
versatile of the young school of Brit
ish musicians, winning recognition as
composer, conductor, violinist, and
pianist while still in his twenties. He
comes directly from London, where
he participated in the Premiere of his
own opera, "Judith," at Convent Gar
den a few weeks ago.
Following his debut tonight at the
| Civic Auditorium in San Francisco,
and his appearance here tomorrow
afternoon, the young musician goes
South for his fourth engagement as
guest conductor of the Hollywood
Bowl concerts.
The third of a generation of famous
.musicians, Goossens conducted when
Stanford's operatic version of the
"Critic" was produced, in January
1916, in the character of "Mr. Linley
of Bath." In 1923 he succeeded Albert
Coates as director of the Rochester
I Philharmonic Orchestra. This remains
j his principal winter engagement, al-
I though he has been guest conductor
I of other big orchestras in the East.

Goossens has contributed over forty
compositions to the field of music,
which include arrangements for piano,
strings, flute, clarinet, horn, and harp.
His music is mostly chromatic, lean
ing toward the grotesque and exotic,
but in which is a fund of "genuine
musical humor." The novelty of his
selections has made them notable.
