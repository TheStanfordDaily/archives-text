# GORDON DAVIS HEADS CAST OF "SECOND MAN"; COMEDY CONTAINS BUT 4 PLAYERS
## Lucie Bentley, Ruth Beede, Jack McDowell Will Appear With Actor-Director; Rehearsals Under Way for Behrman Play Set for July 26 
### 
/GORDON DAVIS will play the lead in the next campus production—a spark
" ling sophisticated comedy by S. N. Behrman, "The Second Man." Four
characters compose the entire cast —the smallest that has ever presented a
play on the Stanford stage. This crisp comedy is characterized by brilliant
dialogue with an undercurrent of thoughtful character analysis.
Ruth Beede will play Monica Grey, an innocent, modern young girl—"a

Tennysonian Ingenue with a Freudian
patter."
Lucie Bentley has been cast in the
role of Mrs. Kendall Frayne, a stately,
sophisticated woman of thirty-five.
Jack McDowell will be Austin Lowe,
a young scientist and a genius but
inept at love-making.
Davis as Clark Storey, ambitious
writer, will be witty, charming, and
sympathetic, but tortured by "some
one else inside me —a second man —a
cynical, odious person, who keeps
watching me, grinning and sophisti
cated —horrid —mocking me. . .
Davis, actor-director, heads one play
a year. His 1928 role was King Eric in
Robert E. Sherwood's "The Queen's
Husband," which was repeated in Oc
tober. "The Second Man" is also ex
pected to have a repeat performance.
Ruth Beede, new to campus dra
matics, has played important roles in
Mills College productions—notably
"The Taming of the Shrew."
Lucie Bentley, well-known on the
Stanford stage, will follow her last
summer's lead in "The Chief Thing"
with a new role.
Jack McDowell, an eminently seri
ous-minded youth as far as the Stan
ford stage is concerned, will have a
part not dissimilar to his John Shand
in "What Every Woman Knows."
