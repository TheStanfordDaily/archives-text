# 'Second Man' Portrays Phi Bete Who Sends Chemical Substances As Tokens Of Overwhelming Love
## Jack McDowell Plays Young Scientist in Sparkling Comedy By Behrman; Davis Heads Cast of Four; Production July 26 on Campus 
### 
¥ OVE makes a genius and a Phi Bete dumb—so dumb that he sends chemical
substances as love tokens. How does Monica, the cause of all this over
whelming love, receive these tokens? The answer is found in "The Second
Man" by S. N. Behrman, next campus dramatic production.
Action of the play takes place in Clark Story's studio, all in the space of
twenty-four hours. It is a sophisticated comedy, but nevertheless strikingly
dramatic. Genuine human emotions move the supremely cultured characters.
S>These emotions —love and humor —

break through the veneer of civiliza
tion and culture to make the charac
ters most real.
Makes Love Charmingly
Gordon Davis, director of dramatics
at Stanford, plays Clary Story, writer
and literary dilettante, with volumes
of fine words and with wit the key
note of his character. Clark Story is
the character of a perfect gentleman
who is saturated with artistic emo
tions and who possesses the ability
to make love in a most charming man
ner. It is the second self of Clark
Story that gives the play its name. It
is this second self that is the grinning
sophisticate, the mocker who lurks in
the background.
Austin Lowe, the scientist who com
bines genius and love, is played by
Jack McDowell. McDowell has had
campus experience and was given this
part as a foil for Gordon Davis.
Monica Is Young
Monica, young and innocent, yet
modern, is represented by Ruth Beede.
She appears in striking contrast to the
charming, sophisticated Mrs. Kendall
Frayne, a stately lady of thirty-five
years. Mrs. Frayne is played by Lucie
Bentley, who is best remembered for
her work in "Dear Brutus" and "The
Lady of the Rose," as well as for her
part in last summer quarter's produc
tion of "The Chief Thing." This part
is somewhat similar to those charac
terizations in which she has been seen
here, but it offers more opportunity
for the portrayal of charm.
"The Second Man" is to be given
July 26. The seat sale will commence
July 23.

at Stanford, plays Clary Story, writer
and literary dilettante, with volumes
of fine words and with wit the key
note of his character. Clark Story is
the character of a perfect gentleman
who is saturated with artistic emo
tions and who possesses the ability
to make love in a most charming man
ner. It is the second self of Clark
Story that gives the play its name. It
is this second self that is the grinning
sophisticate, the mocker who lurks in
the background.
Austin Lowe, the scientist who com
bines genius and love, is played by
Jack McDowell. McDowell has had
campus experience and was given this
part as a foil for Gordon Davis.
Monica Is Young
Monica, young and innocent, yet
modern, is represented by Ruth Beede.
She appears in striking contrast to the
charming, sophisticated Mrs. Kendall
Frayne, a stately lady of thirty-five
years. Mrs. Frayne is played by Lucie
Bentley, who is best remembered for
her work in "Dear Brutus" and "The
Lady of the Rose," as well as for her
part in last summer quarter's produc
tion of "The Chief Thing." This part
is somewhat similar to those charac
terizations in which she has been seen
here, but it offers more opportunity
for the portrayal of charm.
"The Second Man" is to be given
July 26. The seat sale will commence
July 23.
