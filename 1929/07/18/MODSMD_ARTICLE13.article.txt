# Philosophy Doomed In Merger With Science Belief of Dr. Schlick
## Ancient Study to Disappear With New Movement In Education 
### 
"Philosophy is really not a science
at all but is the activity of the clari
fying of concepts," declared Dr. Moritz
Schlick, visiting professor of philo
sophy from the University of Vienna,
in an interesting lecture to a large
audience Tuesday night in the Little
Theatre.
"That we are in the beginning of a
new philosophy is evident," continued
Dr. Schlick, "and a philosophical atti
tude leading to clear thinking, and
not a course labelled "philosophy" will
be the probable future of philosophy.
The search for the validity of knowl
edge cannot be separated from the
special sciences, as all philosophy
started with the scientific attitude.
True and false are in reality the only
two kinds of thinking."
Professor Schlick stated that during
the last thirty years philosophy has
taken the form of either metaphysics
or epistemology, but neither has
proven a satisfactory solution of the
inquiry into the nature and validity
of knowledge. Most thinkers, however,
believe in metaphysics in that they
have an "intuition" into things beyond
reality.
"We are now living at a time when
insight into the interpretation of
knowledge is far better than ever be
fore, and the old distinction between
content and form has taken on a new
meaning," he said, and referred to
Ludwig Wittgenstein, the noted Ger
man philosopher, as the coming en
lightener of the new era of philosophy.
"The older conceptions are rapidly
passing away," concluded Dr. Schlick,
"and in the future few pliilohophy
books will be written, but all books
will be written in a philsopohical
manner."
