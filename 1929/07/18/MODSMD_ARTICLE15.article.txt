Dr. Lewis M. Terman's "gifted chil
dren" are making good.
After eight years of observation by
i the Stanford psychologist and his as
j sistants, the boys and girls whose
(high I.Q.'s placed them among the se
lected thousand in 1921, when these
(studies began, as youths are living up
, to the promise of their childhood.
Parents Co-operate
Dr. Terman is now completing the
continuation of his earlier study in
Volume 111 of the Genetic Studies of
Genius series. This work will be pub
lished next year by the Stanford Uni
versity Press. Nearly all of the thou
sand gifted children are available for
| this further research. Teachers and
parents are co-operating even more
whole-heartedly in this later study
than they did in the beginning.
A gifted child is one whose "1.Q."
is 130, or above. Dr. Terman found
that one of every 200 children that
he studied had a place in the class of
the "most gifted."
These thousand gifted children come
mainly from the educated middle
class. They are rather above the aver
age in health and in physical activity.
In proportion to population, twice as
many of them are Jews as Gentiles.
