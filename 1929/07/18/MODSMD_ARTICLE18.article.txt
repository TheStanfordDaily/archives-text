# "Oh, There's a Road to Roble—"
## 
### 
Sometime tomorrow night, between the hours of nine and one, the
more active campus male will throw his books out of the window and
head for the Roble detour on the way to Toyon's first all-University
dance of the quarter. He may not be early, and he may not be late, but
undoubtedly he'll be there—if only to trade one dance with his roommate.
The hard-working dance committee, slaving under the baton of Mr.
Holt, have discommoded a considerable proportion of Toyon's staid and
sober community to provide the decorations that mark a Hall dance as
an outstanding summer festivity. It seems—they say —that someone in
variably runs off with part of the fixings after each affair. But following
innumerable ingenious directions, they have recovered the draperies and
potted palms —the only potted fixtures that will be noticed —and plopped
them down in somewhat novel positions.
Then there's the punch and the orchestra and Toyon's well-known
shaded alcoves and —the eagle-eyed ticket-taker. May he have more
mercy than justice.
