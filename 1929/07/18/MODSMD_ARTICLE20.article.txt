# Consider the Southpaw
## 
### 
Not all persons are right-handed, but the University apparently thought
they were, judging from the way the classroom seats were installed. All
of them are designed for right-handed persons.
Picture a left-handed student writing on a right-handed arm rest. He
must be an amateur contortionist and turn half way around in his seat.
He gets writer's cramp and the students behind get a long look at his
profile. If he places his notebook on his lap, his busines arm pokes the
right arm of the student on his left, and they each spend the hour
wondering why there have to be southpaws.
If there are not enough southpaws to make it worth while to install
left-handed arm rests, it would be justified by the convenience of right
handed persons to have the southpaws quit bothering them.
