Our Campus Opinion Editor is a changed man these days. One can
scarcely recognize the chap as he merrily plunges into the morning mail,
seeking the day's latest bouquets and brickbats.
But every once in awhile —how our heart goes out to him!—he finds
a perfectly lovely letter, with the dirtiest remarks written on the best
stationery, but—unsigned. Poor devil. It hurts him so much to Hip the
missive, or missile, into the wastepaper basket.
And to think that all grief could be spared him if the authors would
only append their own name with the John Henry they want run. If
they only knew!
