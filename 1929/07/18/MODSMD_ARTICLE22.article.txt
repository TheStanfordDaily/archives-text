# It's Worth a Trial

### 
A student who is hungry after 9 o'clock wants to know why the
Cellar can't stay open after that hour.
We can tell him how lie can keep it open. Let him guarantee enough
sales to save the management from running a charity for his convenience.
Still there is some force in his presentation of possibilities. In former
summers the Cellar couldn't afford to open at all. Now it is doing pretty
well, apparently. And it is true that college students get hungry along
toward l>edtime. The Cellar might secure good trade between 9 and 11.
Jt is worth trying.

There will be a meeting of the Daily staff in the office at 1 o'clock
Monday afternoon. All memljers of the editorial board, reporters' staff
and business office are requested to attend.
