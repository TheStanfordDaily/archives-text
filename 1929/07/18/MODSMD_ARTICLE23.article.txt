# The 						Bullsession
## And On Your Left, Ladeez— 
### 
Now that Stanford's summer excur- 1
sions are well on their way, and each
week-end many campus visitors trek
off to Santa Cruz or Big Basin or Mt.
Hamilton, there come to mind fond
memories of other trips we've made —
memories of a lighting trout breaking
the water in the raging King's River;
of a long highway threading through
cool redwood groves; of a morning
walk up the spray-swept side of Yose
mit.e Falls; the windy summit of
Mount Lassen; of a freezing gale
screaming over the snow on Mount
Tallac —of a flat tire on the Chico
highway, with the mercury turning
somersaults in the thermometer.
Stanford is truly fortunate in its
location —this is no advertisement, as
you'll soon see —within a day's drive
of three state lines. Northern Cali
fornia, with the Klamath region—and
all its justly famed steelheads, and
Mt. Shasta, is the farthest. But San
Diego to the south is but fourteen
hours away, and Lake Tahoe to the
east is but nine.
Hearken to the Wanderlust
And within these not too distant
boundaries lie spots of beauty, of
recreation, of historic interest that
would make many a state blush for
shame.
To reach San Diego or the Klamath,
and to enjoy them and return, would
take more than twenty-four hours. But
much closer to the campus are scores
of bustling cities, ocean beaches, na
tional parks and forests, and hunting
and fishing grounds that make unused

guns and tackle quiver in their cases.
To the South—
To the south is Monterey, with its
Mission El Carmelo, its beaches, its
much-described Seventeen-Mile Drive, j
its Pebble Beach golf course, its Span
ish villas, its old whaling station. The
Pinnacles National Monument is down
there near Soledad, and the annual
California Rodeo—a truly glorious
spectacle—which starts at Salinas to
day.
Sacramento, state capital, is to the
east, with the valley cities of Stock
ton and Modesto, the hills back of
Livermore (blessed memories of au
eight-point buck!), and the orchard
lands of the San Joaquin valley.
The "River" Calls
Northward are Inverness and the
old Ptussian settlement at Fort Ross
on the coast, the resorts on the Rus
sian river, Luther Burbank's gardens
at Santa Rosa, the petrified forest and
the hot springs at Calistoga, the Bo
hemian Grove —and its High Jinks —
at Monte Rio, the Gravenstein apple
orchards near Sebastapol, and the
Muir Woods and Mill Valley district
about Mt. Tamalpais.
Here, then, is a University set down
in this veritable mass of excursion
points —all of them can be visited in
a day. Perhaps an early morning start
is necessitated, and a late evening re
turn. But need that matter?
Beg pardon! There IS some sort of
a rule about No Women Allowed —
based on a good old Stanford custom
of —it can't be Lock Outs —oh, yes,
Lock Ins. —M. M. S.

shame.
To reach San Diego or the Klamath,
and to enjoy them and return, would
take more than twenty-four hours. But
much closer to the campus are scores
of bustling cities, ocean beaches, na
tional parks and forests, and hunting
and fishing grounds that make unused

guns and tackle quiver in their cases.
To the South—
To the south is Monterey, with its
Mission El Carmelo, its beaches, its
much-described Seventeen-Mile Drive, j
its Pebble Beach golf course, its Span
ish villas, its old whaling station. The
Pinnacles National Monument is down
there near Soledad, and the annual
California Rodeo—a truly glorious
spectacle—which starts at Salinas to
day.
Sacramento, state capital, is to the
east, with the valley cities of Stock
ton and Modesto, the hills back of
Livermore (blessed memories of au
eight-point buck!), and the orchard
lands of the San Joaquin valley.
The "River" Calls
Northward are Inverness and the
old Ptussian settlement at Fort Ross
on the coast, the resorts on the Rus
sian river, Luther Burbank's gardens
at Santa Rosa, the petrified forest and
the hot springs at Calistoga, the Bo
hemian Grove —and its High Jinks —
at Monte Rio, the Gravenstein apple
orchards near Sebastapol, and the
Muir Woods and Mill Valley district
about Mt. Tamalpais.
Here, then, is a University set down
in this veritable mass of excursion
points —all of them can be visited in
a day. Perhaps an early morning start
is necessitated, and a late evening re
turn. But need that matter?
Beg pardon! There IS some sort of
a rule about No Women Allowed —
based on a good old Stanford custom
of —it can't be Lock Outs —oh, yes,
Lock Ins. —M. M. S.
Now that Stanford's summer excur- 1
sions are well on their way, and each
week-end many campus visitors trek
off to Santa Cruz or Big Basin or Mt.
Hamilton, there come to mind fond
memories of other trips we've made —
memories of a lighting trout breaking
the water in the raging King's River;
of a long highway threading through
cool redwood groves; of a morning
walk up the spray-swept side of Yose
mit.e Falls; the windy summit of
Mount Lassen; of a freezing gale
screaming over the snow on Mount
Tallac —of a flat tire on the Chico
highway, with the mercury turning
somersaults in the thermometer.
Stanford is truly fortunate in its
location —this is no advertisement, as
you'll soon see —within a day's drive
of three state lines. Northern Cali
fornia, with the Klamath region—and
all its justly famed steelheads, and
Mt. Shasta, is the farthest. But San
Diego to the south is but fourteen
hours away, and Lake Tahoe to the
east is but nine.
Hearken to the Wanderlust
And within these not too distant
boundaries lie spots of beauty, of
recreation, of historic interest that
would make many a state blush for
shame.
