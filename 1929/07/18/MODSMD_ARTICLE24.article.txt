After directing beamish visitors to
the Hoover Home, many an erstwhile
campus Hoover fan is wishing he
voted Democratic in the recent un>

it all, only wish the horde might be
repulsed with heavy losses.

Carolina visited the Hoover hill Sun
day. "We voted for fiim," they said.
The state went Republican and they
went traveling.
