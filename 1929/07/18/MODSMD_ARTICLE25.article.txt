# PERSONAL COMMENT FOR LIMITED PUBLIC
## 
### 
Against the policy of this column,
we are requested to observe, in pointed
personal remarks, that one of our most
prominent Dekes, a gentleman to
whom fisticuffs are as patty cake, is
being led about these days by a fair
visitor.
What his friends expect, evidently,
is another Boxer rebellion.
But at least Mr. Dillings doesn't
use the Hopkins Home as a rendez
vous.
