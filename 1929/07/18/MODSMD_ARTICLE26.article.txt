# PRIZE PARAGRAPH
## from the Chronicle Sporting Green 
### 
The cause of the fire has not
been definitely determined. Park
wooden stands. Preparations had
been placed under the 15-year-old
official denied any gasoline had
been made to sprinkle a small
amount of gasoline on the dia
mond and ignite it to dry out for
a game between the Detroit Stars
and the Kansas City Monarchs.
Baseball is a fascinating game.
When all other sources fail, one
can always dip into a volume and
write comment in verse. So —
A QUESTION OF GRAMMAR
The well-known Mr. Untermeyer
Exults fn verse collections
Thus pleasing those who most desire
Poetical cross-sections.
He sub-divides his poesy
(A system he thinks vital)
And, all bedecked to show us, he
Gives each verse mood a title.
There's "Phantasies" and "Common
Things"
(Which treats of scenes agrarian)
And "Children" and "Awakenings"
And —now we're no grammarian.
But would one title better fit
Its auditory niche
If "Stars to Hitch to" changed, to-wit,
To "Stars to Which to Hitch"?
Despite automobiles, there are still
50,000 horses in New York.
