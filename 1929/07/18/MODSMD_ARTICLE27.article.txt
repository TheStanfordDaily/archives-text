# MENLO CIRCUS JULY 27
## 
### 
Daring Spanish costumes, sponsors
claim, will be prevalent in the eighth
annual circus of the Menlo Circus
Club July 27. The proceeds each year
are given to the Stanford Home for
Convalescent Children. Edith Walkut
has been elected "Queen of the Cir
cus."

A firecracker worth less than a cent
is thought to have caused a $500,000
fire in Brooklyn.
