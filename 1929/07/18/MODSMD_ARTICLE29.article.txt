## Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread

Editor, Sir: ,
What is the nature of a summer
student? Does he see, hear, feel, eat
like a human being? Or 1b he toler
ated, observed, examined, and looked
upon in general as a curious speci
men ?
If his nature is more or less human
then maybe his appetite is.
If it is he probably wants to eat at
the Cellar as he returns from the li
brary at night.
But what chance has he? The
Cellar closes at nine o'clock. Why?
We don't know.
There are half as many students
here for the summer quarter as there
are for winter session and during the

i winter the Encina store and the Se
! quoia store are running competition
with the Cellar, so with two of the
three eating places eliminated and
with one-half of the student body here,
why can't the Cellar afford to stay
1 open and welcome guests another two
hours a day?
The Cellar stays open until nine;
and from six-thirty until nine there
| is practically no business. It is after
i nine that the pangs of hunger assail
wanderers and force them to seek
food and cheer. So why can't the Cel
: lar stay open and accommodate the
student body in the summer as well
as the student body in the winter?
