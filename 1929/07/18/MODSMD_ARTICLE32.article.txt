# Excavations Completed On New Swimming Pool
## 
### 
Work on the swimming pool project
has been going ahead rapidly, with
the excavations for one wholly com
pleted, and plans for the others al
ready under way. The tank behind
Encina pool has been dug to the re
quired depth and only the cementing
remains to be done. The digging of
these pools has also aided in the con
struction of the sunken baseball dia
mond, as the earth removed from them
is being used to build up the bleachers
back of the home plate. The ball field
is not being rushed, however, and in.
all probability will not be ready for
use until late next year.
