# NEW MEMORIAL ROOM TO OPEN IN LIBRARY; ADMISSION RESTRICTED
## 
### 
The new Charlotte Ashley Felton
Memorial Library will be open for use
after it has been catalogued. Its use
is restricted to the staff of the Uni
versity and students to whom the
privilege of admission has been ex
tended.
Included in the library are 3500 vol
umes of the belles-lettres of England
and the United States, beginning with
Hawthorne and his contemporaries,
and including living writers. A large
number of volumes are "first editions."
"Although the Felton collection has
the atmosphere of a private library,
it is by no means a browsing room
for idlers, and if people begin abusing
their privileges the number admitted
will have to be still further restricted,"
says Nathan Van Patten, University
librarian.
The purpose of the library is to give
Stanford students a different aspect
of life, somewhat in contrast to the
practical world. This point was
brought out by Van Patten in his
speech at the dedication, when he
said: "So much of life is a struggle
with material things that it is good
occasionally to turn towards that as
pect of our existence which is con
cerned with the intangible."

Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur emphasized
this same advantage when he said:
"Heauty has a great place in the de
velopment of youth."
