# WHAT PRICE GLORY? SHAKESPEARE LOSES TO UNDERGRADUATES
## 
### 
When it comes to using Eng
lish, the famed Bard of Avon
was nowhere.
Word comes from the Univer
sity of Missouri that Shake
speare had command of only
17,000 words as compared with
the average college student's vo
cabulary of from 39,000 to 100,000
words. The Daily Missourian
takes pains, however, to explain
that "these figures do not mean
that the students are between
two and five times as clever as
the great Shakespeare." There
are just more words in the lan
guage than there were when the
poet of Stratford wrote.
It isn't everyone who can get
by on a mere 17,000 words!
