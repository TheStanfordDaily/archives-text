With only two small blazes on the
campus reported Tuesday and none
yesterday, the campaign against the
summer fire menace is bearing re
sults, Chief Dugan believes. A grass
fire on the flying field was quickly
extinguished Tuesday noon. Shortly
afterward the firemen subdued a blaze
on a small section of the Stanford
stock farm.
