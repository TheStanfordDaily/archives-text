# Age of Speed Invades Music Says Goossens In Talk at Toyon Hall
## Harmony Replaces Melody In New Era, View of Guest Artist 
### 
The age of speed has asserted itself
even in the domain of music, accord
ing to Eugene Goossens, director of
the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra,
and guest conductor of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, in a lec
ture on "Contemporary Music" yes
terday afternoon in Toyon Hall.
"Modern music," said Goossens,
"says what it has to say in the least
number of words. The word 'elimina
tion' has come into music. Everything
superfluous in musical speech—sharps
and flats in signatures and unneces
sary transitions from key to key—is
being eliminated."
Another important difference be
tween contemporary music and that
of the older schools is that harmony
has become the fundamental basis. In
the past it was merely a window
dressing for the melody. Harmony has
the most important element for ex
pressing emotion and color.
"The spirit that animates composers
of today is the same as that which
animated Handel, Mendelssohn,
Brahms, and the other old masters,"
said Goossens. "The change in music
is external, not internal. Every piece
of modern music has a relation, struc
turally or otherwise, to former works."
Goossens urged the public to co
operate with composers. The nature
of present-day music is such that peo
ple must keep in touch with it all the
time. If they do not, they will be
unable to understand when they come
in contact with it again. People of this
sort are not qualified to judge, Goos
sens emphasized, and do an injustice
to the rest of the public if they at
tempt to criticize.
