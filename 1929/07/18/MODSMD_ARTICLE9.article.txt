# TWO CONTINENTS, STANFORD CAMPUS SEEN BY OLD FORD
## 
### 
Bearing the inscription on its
door "Universite Libre de Brux
elles, Institut Superieur de Com
merce de Mons, Belgium," a
dusty and battered Ford rattled
up in front of the Stanford Union
Monday after a journey across
the Atlantic ocean and the United
States.
The car was decorated in what
was the best collegiate style of
a year ago. Painted on it were
signs such as "Old World and
still going strong"; cowbells, and
souvenirs from the various states
through which it had travelled.
After getting a taste of local
college life at the Union, the two
adventurers set off to continue
their travels with the name of
Stanford University added to
their list of chalked signs.
