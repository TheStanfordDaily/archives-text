# THE 						BULL SESSION
## 
### 
A GLIMPSE AT THE FUTURE
To even the most unnoticing ob
server, summer quarter is different.
Avowedly akin to its three predeces
sors during the year, it bears a funda
mental aloofness, subtle thought it
may be, a spirit of novelty, of superi
ority, perhaps.
And it is different. Who can think
of the crisp football days of fall, the
•drizzling mornings of winter, the
warm, lazy, genial afternoons of
spring—who can think of these and
of summer as similar parts of a col
lege year?
Gone are the bustling undergradu
ates scampering, eternally late, to
eight-o'clocks. Gone are the jubilant
rallies for the team, black-and-white
evenings of Prom and Cotillion, fe
verish cramming for mid-quarters and
finals, tense days of fraternity rush
ing, wires home for money, gay suc
cession of dances, trips to San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles, football
games and track meets, tryouts, meet
ings, drives, caucuses, elections, mid
night bullsessions —comic in their
deadly seriousness—that settle, at
least for a week, the future of man
kind.
In their place comes a new quar
ter —a quarter in which most of these
evidences of explosive activity grave
ly retire to temporary oblivion. The
campus is something changed, some
thing removed from a world of rush
and excitement.
There is less of mob heroics —of
"die for dear old Stanford," and more
of "get what I can." Selfish? Hardly,
for this new feeling is a more un
selfish one. The roaring approval of
the mob is the reward of self-glorifica
tion. The more quiet, serious pursuit
is crowned with success only after a
harder struggle. It looks to self-ad
vancement, attainment of honors
higher than the plaudits of a youthful
generation. And individual progress,
in the long run, will do more for Stan
ford than racing down a cinder-cov
ered track —or creating idealistic ad
monitions.
One who visits a Stanford summer
session for the first time finds it good.
There is, perhaps, a more pleasant
greeting from new friends, a more
cheerful environment in classroom
and laboratory, a more serious at
mosphere at library tables, a delight
fully informal formality over the
whole campus.
Stanford is different —it is mature.
The University changes with the peo
ple on its campus, and now the peo
ple are different. There are more
graduates, more seniors, fewer
youngsters. The campus is older.
Students at summer session see
Stanford in a new light, as it may
appear in a not distant future. A
graduate and upper division school,
the goal of the University's guiding
hands, is put on display for a quarter.
To this visitor, then, a view appears
of another Stanford, with the youth—
the athletics and dances and elections
—of the old, and the maturity—the
seriousness of purpose —of the new.
A seeming paradox, perhaps, but one
whole-heartedly approved.
