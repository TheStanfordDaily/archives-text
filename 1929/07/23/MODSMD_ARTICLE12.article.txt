# COME SLIDE DOWN OUR CELLAR DOOR Curfew Pooh-Poohed In New Late Closing Hour UNION STORE HEARS STUDENT PLEAS
## 
### 
Rejoice! You can now quench your
thirst after nine o'clock. The cellar
has extended lis lock-out hours to
eleven o'clock, at least for a trial.
Starting yesterday the cash and
carry system was put into effect â€”
you pay for, and carry your own food.
But you can do so after curfew hour.
Now that the cellar has answered
the plaintive plea of the starving stu
dents and is doing its part to co
operate, it's up to the "starved ones,"
say the proprietors, to appease their
hunger at the Cellar instoad of going

down town for a snail and coffee after
library hours.
The Cellar is working under a han
dicap with so much construction work
going on in their kitchen, so please
i don't kick about a few nails in your
j coffee, or plaster decoration on your
pie, because after all it is just a
question of taste, and you'll soon got
: used to it.
The service is cafeteria style, you
get your food at the counter and eat
it where you will, booths or tables.
| And, according to the management,
j there will be sport pages for all.
