Stanford is already preparing to
act as host to the National Student
Federation of America, which holds
its convention on the campus next
January.
Convening for the first time on the
Pacific Coast, the federation will
bring more than two hundred dele
gates from nearly every university
of importance in the United States
to the Stanford Farm. Under the di
rection of Ursel Narver, president of
the organization from Oregon State,
plans for the convention are wejl
under way.
VanAmringe Chairman
Jan D. VanAmringe, a Stanford
graduate, will act as general chairman
of the congress, which will gather for
the purpose of discussing problems
of student government as well as
questions of national and internation
al interest.
Among the local arrangements, the
Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity are remodeling the old trophy
room which will serve as the head
quarters for the convention. Newly
tinted walls, rich velour drapes, a
large seminar table surrounded by
comfortable chairs, in fact complete
new furnishings will transform the
large, bare room in the Old Union
into a dignified meeting place for the
heads of the convention.
Ex Committee To Use Room
In the future this room will serve
as the meeting room of the A.S.S.U.
Executive Committee, and a small ad
joining room will be the office of the
president of the student body and of
the student manager.
The contract for re-decorating and
furnishing has been given to David
Kceble of Palo Alto and the work
has started. The decorating, under
his direction, is being executed by
the Corporation Yards, and the open
ing of fall quarter should see the
room complete. The expense is being
borne by the Associated Students and
by the Union Board of Governors.
