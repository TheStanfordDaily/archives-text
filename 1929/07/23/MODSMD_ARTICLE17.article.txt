# The 						High Mogul Is Dead

The masthead of today's Daily carries the ominous news of changes
in what was once a staid, sober newspaper. That's the Journalism Division
for you—never satisfied.
Of course there were rumors and explanations floating around.
Something about giving everybody a chance to learn something—that can
be safely ignored. And turning the summer Daily into a laboratory —
well, that's a great reason for such a crushing blow.
Here's a hard-working editor—he worked everybody—who gave the
best years of his life trying to dish up the day's news before the campus—
and what happens to him? He gets bounced. Bounced right out of his
throne, down to oblivion among the reporters.
These professors absolutely can't be trusted. They get a good man,
use him for their evil scholarly purposes, and then —brazenly asserting
that it's only to pass the editorial experience around —show him the non
slam-able door.
After the cloud of copy paper subsided, the astounded staff noticed
a new name on the editor's door-plate—Burnell Gould. A fine chap, no
doubt, but one who until no whas lived a blameless life. A new associate
editor appeared—Earl Harris, and a new member of the editorial board—
Ted Krough.
The sorrowing corpse, on his way to tte undertaker's, can only roll
over to give these three a clammy grJffij congratulations, and then
climb back on the hearse. —M, M. S.
