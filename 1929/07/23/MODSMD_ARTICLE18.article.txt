# A 						Dirty Trick—That's All—A Dirty Trick

### 
Just when the undersigned had almost resigned himself (PRINTER'S
NOTE: Did you ever resign yourself?—it's much better than getting
tired) —resigned himself, we insist, to the local equivalent of City Editor
—came the blow. We were "promoted."
Mr. Silverman got too good to stay so he got JMfeted —an excellent
reason, everyone assures us, why we are now edit<^|r
Now all the grievances come on our head. And by the way, where are
all the grievances that ought to be coming in? snub, we calls it. Our
new policy, then, will be to get as many grievances as possible—within a
decent limit, of course.
All right, we'll be editor!
But its a dirty trick—that's all—a dirty trick ! —B. G.
