# Food Past The Curfew Hour
## 
### 
So the Cellar will stay open till eleven o'clock.
No longer will the legally thirsty students have to troop down to the
leech-like Palo Alto for their nocturnal, pre-trundle refreshment.
Somebody wrote a Campus Opinion, the Daily wrote an editorial,
several good people swore lustily when they met darkness under the Old
Union at curfew hour, and it happened.
The Cellar will stay open till eleven o'clock.
But somebody has to pay for it. Unable to charge $1.33 a day (or
maybe it was $1.27) to folks who merely drop in. the management faces
a financial problem of no mean proportions (and when we say mean
proportions, we mean proportions!).
Somebody has got to eat food from nine to eleven, preferably several
people.
It is plainly up to those who cried the loudest for evening sustenance
to patronize the Cellar.
Maybe everything won't be just like Mother used to fake, but it
will be Stanford food. It will be up to every true Stanford man or
woman to eat it—or pay for it, anyhow.
But seriously, fellows, have a cup of coffee and a couple of doughnuts.
Patronize your campus institutions. For the Cellar is nothing if not an
institution —recent, it is true, but famous.
It offers a quiet, restful atmosphere (between drillings next door) and
it personifies Stanford Democracy. You help yourself.
So if you don't get your grub in a hurry you have only yourself to
blame, or perhaps the guy that inevitably shoves ahead of you and yells
louder.
We still note a few things that might do no harm. For instance,
where are the old stained boards with Noted Names carved deep?
Heidelberg at Heart, we miss 'em, dammit, we miss 'cm! Maybe when
the sumptious new unit opens they'll be back again. Maybe.
What this college really needs is a few more pocket knives.
But the Cellar is open till eleven, anyhow, even if you can't carve a
marble counter.
