# SOVIET, CHINA FIGHT BLUFF, EXPERT ON EAST CLAIMS
## Ichihashi Believes Foreign Intervention Possible If War Continues RUSS, CHINA FUNDS LOW Present Hostilities Results Of Railroad Disputes, Red Propaganda

| Neither China nor Russia is finan
j cially able to carry on an extended
i war. Both sides are merely making a
j display of force to command the re
i spect. of their own nationals. Foreign
interests in both countries are great
enough to insure both belligerents of
timely interference by other powers.
This is the opinion of Professor
Yamato Ichihashi of the Stanford his
tory department concerning the im
pending war between these two coun
tries. Dr. Ichihashi is a recognized
authority on affairs of the Far East
and the Pacific, as he was present at
all sessions, both open and private,
of the Washington Conference of
! 1921 as secretary and interpreter to
) the late Viscount Kato, senior dele
gate of Japan to the conference. On
this conference Dr. Ichihashi has writ-
I ten a book, "The Washington Con
ference and After," which was pre
; sented to the Emperor of Japan by
Dr. David Starr Jordan.
Finances Limited
Neither government has been fully
i recognized by all the foreign powers,
| and neither has sufficient foreign
credit to be able to finance a war of
jany proportions, but both govern
'ments have many internal enemies,
and dare not present a weak front. In
! tercession by foreign powers, such as
ihe United States, England, or Japan
—especially the latter, as Japan has
important interests in Manchuria —is
sure to occur before either of the
belligerents does much harm to the
other.
The present outbreak is not spon
taneous, believes Dr. Ichihashi, but
: has its origin as far back as 1894,
! when there was a war between China
and Japan. Japan, as the victor, took
the Liaoutung Peninsula, at the ex
i treme southern end of Manchuria,
I from China, but was forced to return
It to China at the insistence of Euro
pean powers, who said that Japan's
presence on the peninsula would in
terfere with general peace.
In 1896 China and Russia made a
secret military alliance against Japan,
in which China granted Russia the
right to build a railroad across Man
churia, from Manchuli to Progranich
naya, and from Harbin to Dairen. As
a result of this concession Russia
built 1500 miles of railroad in Man
churia —the original Chinese Eastern
Railway.
When Japan defeated Russia in the
Russo-Japanese War of 1904, Russia
conceded Japan a lease of the Liaou
tung Peninsula, and a portion of the
railroad as far north as Changchun.
China Given Trusteeship
In the World War, when the Bol
sheviki overthrew Kerensky and es
tablished the Soviet government, the
Inter-Allied Siberian expedition took
over the Chinese Eastern Railroad on
the grounds that Russia owed money
to these powers, and by the agree
ment of these powers, China was
given the trusteeship. In 1924, in a
treaty between Russia and China,
China returned the road to Russia as
an act of good will.
The present difficulty arose when
China seized the road, and drove
Russian officials out of Manchuria on
the grounds that Russia was spread
ing Bolshevik propaganda. Russia
sent an ultimatum to China, and sev
ered diplomatic relations because
China's answer was "vague and un
satisfactory."
