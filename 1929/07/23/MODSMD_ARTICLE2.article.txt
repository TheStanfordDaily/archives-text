# SOVIET, CHINA FIGHT BLUFF, EXPERT ON EAST CLAIMS
## Ichihashi Believes Foreign Intervention Possible If War Continues RUSS, CHINA FUNDS LOW Present Hostilities Results Of Railroad Disputes, Red Propaganda

| Neither China nor Russia is finan
j cially able to carry on an extended
i war. Both sides are merely making a
j display of force to command the re
i spect. of their own nationals. Foreign
interests in both countries are great
enough to insure both belligerents of
timely interference by other powers.
This is the opinion of Professor
Yamato Ichihashi of the Stanford his
tory department concerning the im
pending war between these two coun

authority on affairs of the Far East
and the Pacific, as he was present at
all sessions, both open and private,
of the Washington Conference of
! 1921 as secretary and interpreter to
) the late Viscount Kato, senior dele
gate of Japan to the conference. On
this conference Dr. Ichihashi has writ-
I ten a book, "The Washington Con
ference and After," which was pre
; sented to the Emperor of Japan by
Dr. David Starr Jordan.

ihe United States, England, or Japan
—especially the latter, as Japan has
important interests in Manchuria —is
sure to occur before either of the
belligerents does much harm to the
other.
The present outbreak is not spon
taneous, believes Dr. Ichihashi, but
: has its origin as far back as 1894,
! when there was a war between China
and Japan. Japan, as the victor, took
the Liaoutung Peninsula, at the ex
i treme southern end of Manchuria,
I from China, but was forced to return
