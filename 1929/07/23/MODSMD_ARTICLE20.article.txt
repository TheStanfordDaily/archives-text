David Horsburgh, who died at his home on the campus Sunday, has
been a good friend of Stanford students in a quiet way since the early
days of the University. Through the years he has extended many little
unknown aids. It was only natural that upon his retirement he made his
home here, where he has lived for nearly a decade.
