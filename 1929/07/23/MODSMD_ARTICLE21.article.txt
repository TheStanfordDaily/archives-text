"All Quiet on the West Front," by
Eric Marra Remarque, trans
lated from the German by A. W.
Wheen.
Because the Manchester Guardian
writes that "All Quiet Along the
Western Front" is "surely the great
est of all war books" —
Because numerous critics have said
of it,"It supersedes all previous his
tories and renders all previous his
tories superfluous," "At last the epic
of the lowly soldiers," "These are the
statements of the dead, the testament
of all the fallen addressed to the liv
ing of all nations," "All and every
thing that has been produced so far
is but patchwork compared with this
achievement" —
Because Christopher Morley says
frankly, "I regard any mature reader
who has a chance to read this book
and does not, and who, having read
it, does not pass it on among a dozen
others, as a traitor to humanity"—
one picks up the book and reads it.
Death Portrayed
And one reads the book through
without stopping, reads about a Ger
man foot soldier in the trenches, be
hind the lines, on leave, in the hos
pital, and again in the trenches. One
sees men dying in the fields, such
men as Kemmerich —"His lips have
fallen away, his mouth has become
larger, his teeth stick out and look
as though they were made of chalk,
the flesh melts, the forehead bulges
more prominently, the cheek bones
protrude. The skeleton is working
itself through."
One sees men living with their
skulls blown open, soldiers running
with their two feet blown off, stag

gering on splintered stumps—men
without mouths, without jaws, without
faces. One hears the terrible groans
and screams of dying men and
wounded horses, and one feels the
same overpowering despair of war.
Generation Affected
Furthermore, one sees before him
a young generation in war —fresh —
ambitious —coming to a premature
maturity with the war their only
home, a generation that is forgetting
how to lead a normal life, that will
return to a calculating world clamor
ing for more bloodshed, still glorifying
discipline and war —and yet, out of
all this, acquiring the only virtues of
war —friendship, loyalty, and courage.
This story, both horrible and won
derful, is written with blasting sim
plicity, now and then subtly ironical,
at times highly philosophical, but al
ways realistic with touches of fine
vulgarity necessary to its honesty and
candor.
Story Unprejudiced
It is not a story with Rational
prejudice, nor a novel with adventure,
but something more of an autobio
graphy—sincere, realistic, portraying
emotions not of the cheap sort It is
the story of a man who has been
through the war, and who has written
about the war sincerely and frankly
with the simplicity of a literary artist.
Remarque writes for his foreword,
"This book is to be neither an accu
sation nor a confession, and least of
all an adventure, for death is not an
adventure to those who stand face
to face with it. It will try simply to
tell of a generation of men who, even
though they may have escaped its
shells, were destroyed by the war."
