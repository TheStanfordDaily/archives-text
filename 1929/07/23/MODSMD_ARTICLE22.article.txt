# Bloch Conducts "America"
## 
### 
A highly appreciative audience
crowded Hillsborough's Woodland
Theatre last Sunday to hear Ernest
Bloch conduct the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra in the fifth con
cert of this summer's series. The out
standing feature of the concert was
the performance of the prize-winning
symphony, "America," conducted for
the first time by its composer.
The introductory number of the
program was Beethoven's famous
overture, "Coriolan" Op. 62, interpret
ing the story of the Roman patrician
Coriolanus, banished from Rome for
his defiance of the plebians. It por
trays his desire for vengeance, and
the overcoming of this desire, followed
by his death. The theme of the com
position is carried primarily by the
string section of the orchestra.
The Russian folk-tunes comprised
the second part of the program.
Their composer, Anatol Liadow, has
been characterized as "one of the
most original composers of the mod
ern Russian school." "A Religious
Verse," "A Christmas Carol," "A
Plaintive Melody," and "A Lively Air"
were played.
The "Bacchanale" from "Tannhau
ser," displayed Bloch's genius to good
advantage in its whirlwind opening
passages and in the haunting beauty
of its "climax in diminuendo."
The final composition of the con

cert, the symphony, "America," was
awaited with special interest. It was
selected last year from ninety-two
scores as the prize-winner in a con
test judged by Walter Damrosch,
Serge Koussevitzky, Leopold Stokow
ski, Frederick Stock, and Alfred
Hertz. Following the award it was
given a simultaneous premiere by the
five great orchestras which the judges
represented.
The symphony is dedicated by its
composer to Abraham Lincoln and
Walt Whitman. On its title page ap
pear the words, "An Epic Rhapsody in
Three Parts." The first section sym
bolizes tliep rimitive America and is
strong with rhythms of Indian music.
The second division, expressing the
period of the Civil War, is inspired by
Whitman's lines:
"I hear America singing, the varied
carols I hear,
Each singing what belongs to him
or her and to no one else
Singing ,witli open mouths their
strong melodious songs."
The Third movement, interpreting
the present and the future, presents
the discordant vibration of modern
life. The symphony closes with an
impressive anthem. The audience
stood during the closing measures of
the composition, and Ernest Blocli
was greeted with an ovation when he
turned from the orchestra. His talent
as a conductor was acclaimed equal
to that of a composer.

by his death. The theme of the com
position is carried primarily by the
string section of the orchestra.

the second part of the program.

been characterized as "one of the
most original composers of the mod
ern Russian school." "A Religious
Verse," "A Christmas Carol," "A
Plaintive Melody," and "A Lively Air"

ser," displayed Bloch's genius to good
advantage in its whirlwind opening
passages and in the haunting beauty
of its "climax in diminuendo."

cert, the symphony, "America," was
awaited with special interest. It was
selected last year from ninety-two
scores as the prize-winner in a con
test judged by Walter Damrosch,

ski, Frederick Stock, and Alfred
Hertz. Following the award it was

pear the words, "An Epic Rhapsody in
Three Parts." The first section sym
bolizes tliep rimitive America and is
strong with rhythms of Indian music.

period of the Civil War, is inspired by
Whitman's lines:
"I hear America singing, the varied
carols I hear,
Each singing what belongs to him
or her and to no one else
Singing ,witli open mouths their
strong melodious songs."
The Third movement, interpreting
the present and the future, presents
the discordant vibration of modern
life. The symphony closes with an
impressive anthem. The audience
stood during the closing measures of
the composition, and Ernest Blocli
was greeted with an ovation when he
turned from the orchestra. His talent
as a conductor was acclaimed equal
to that of a composer.

The introductory number of the
program was Beethoven's famous
overture, "Coriolan" Op. 62, interpret
ing the story of the Roman patrician
