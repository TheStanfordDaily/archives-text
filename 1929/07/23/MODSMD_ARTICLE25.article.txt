# PALO ALTO ADDRESS CAUSES MAIL DELAY OF 90% OF LETTERS
## 
### 
Delay in the distribution of mail in
the campus postoffice lies not in the
inefficiency of the postal employees
but in the faulty addressing of ninety
per cent of the mail, according to
Postmaster W. C. Werry, of the Stan
ford postoffice.
Stanford University and Palo Alto
are separate postoffice departments,
and the error lies in the addressing of
campus mail to Palo Alto.
"The matter of efficient mail deliv
ery," explains Werry, "can be facili
tated and a great deal of time saved
by having all mail addressed to Stan
ford University, California."
Distribution of mail in the railway
mail cars requires the segregation of
Stanford and Palo Alto mail into in
dividual lots. Consequently, a great
deal of campus correspondence is er
roneously sent to Palo Alto because
of the wrong address. A delay of from
five to twelve hours is caused on
letters bearing this discrepancy.
