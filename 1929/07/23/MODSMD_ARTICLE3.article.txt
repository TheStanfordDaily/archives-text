# YOUTH IS HAILED AS "BROADMINDED" BY DR. BROWN IN SERMON
## 
### 
"Youth tends toward idealism,
broad-mindedness, and confidence;
age is apt to be skeptical, reserved,
and practical," declared Dean Charles
Reynolds Brown in his sermon "Youth
and Age" Sunday in the Memorial
Church.
Dr. Brown hailed the open-minded,
willing youth of today as the leader
i iti the search for an ideal mode of
J living. He enlarged upon the broad
mindedness of the modern youth. He
admitted, however, that the success
of the policy is not yet confirmed, and
! denounced its flagrant form, particu
larly attacking vulgarity in literature
! and pictures.
The dean asserted that the world
is still in the experimental stage in
its quest for this ideal. He proceeded,
"The time shall come when people
will choose an ideal course of living,
| not for its popularity, economy, or
feasibility, but for the primary cause
of righteousness."
He felt that the more powerful na
j tions of the world have already made
some definite progress toward the
| ideal of world peace and that, as
! never before, they show great prom
ise of a serious friendship. He lauded
i the Kellogg pact for its influence on
j world peace.
| Dean Brown argued that "tigers
will not array themselves in opposing
lines and combat each other, because
they are of the same kind; why can
not human beings learn the same
lesson?"
Next Sunday morning will be the
last appearance of Dr. Brown in tlie
pulpit at Stanford this summer.
