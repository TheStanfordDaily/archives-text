## 
### 
"Beautiful Germany," a six-real de
piction of every phase of Modern Ger
man life, will be shown for the sec
ond time at 7:30 in the Little Theatre

It achieved such acclaim at its first
showing last April under the auspices
of the German Club that it has been
recalled to the Campus. The film was
produced by a German railroad com
pany and is being furnished free to
all American universities. It has al
ready been shown at Yale, Harvard,
and Smith before its last presentation
on the campus and has been given
since at other universities.
Views of both urban and rural Ger
many, scenes of village life, folk-danc
ing, sports events, difficult mountain
climbs, and air views of snow-capped
peaks and glaciers are included in
this unique film. Of special interest
are the pictures of famous cathedrals,
canities, public buildings, shrines, and
prominent men of today. "Beautiful
Germany" is a complement to a visit
in this old-world country and is of im
portance to those at all interested in
| Germany. The titles are in English.
