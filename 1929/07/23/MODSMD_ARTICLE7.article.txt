# Gordon Davis, Actor-Director, In Annual Stanford Appearance
## Quadrangle Takes Place of Eternal Triangle in Behrman Play 
### 
Life is presented as the eternal
quadrangle rather than the usual tri
angle in S. N. Behrinan's play, "The
Second Man." This clever comedy will
be presented on the Stanford stage
Friday evening.
Seat sale for the production begins
today at one o'clock in front of the
Women's Clubhouse, at Roble Hall,
and at Keeble's in Palo Alto.
Gordon Davis, '18, as Clark Storey,
Is presenting his annual interpreta
tion. He has been dramatic coach at
Stanford since 1920. During this time
ho has developed campus dramatics
from a very neglected activity to the
position of the little theatre move
ment which it now holds.
Davis has also been successful as
an actor —offering one characteriza
tion each summer quarter. He is well
remembered as the Hon. Hyacinth
Petavel in the "Angel in the House,"
as the mature "beau" interested in
agriculture and women in "Aren't We
All," as the religious fanatic in "Hell
Bent fer Heaven," and as the queen's
husband in the play of that name.
This play was given last summer, and
was repeated by popular request at the
time of the Hoover nomination cere
monies, and as the first production
last fall.
Plays Young Man
As Clark Storey, Davis has the first
opportunity that he has had since his
return from Europe to take the part
of a young man. Storey is a charming,
sympathetic, but very mercenary
young gentleman who takes his love
affairs so casually that trouble fol
lows where a little care might have
made life serene.
The drama centers around the
struggle of Storey with his second
self, who sometimes comes to the fore
to give life a witty and humorous
angle—but who sometimes stands in
the background passionately making
a fool of him.
Ruth Beede, Lucie Bentley, and
Jack McDowell complete the "Second
Man" cast. „
One Set Stands
Harold Helvenston and his Theatre
Workshop have planned the single set
necessary for this production, com
pletely synchronizing with Storey's
character. It carries a note of suave
ness, dignity, and solid good taste of
the "Second Man" and the lightness
and casualness of Clark himself.

This play was given last summer, and
was repeated by popular request at the
time of the Hoover nomination cere
monies, and as the first production
last fall.
Plays Young Man
As Clark Storey, Davis has the first
opportunity that he has had since his
return from Europe to take the part
of a young man. Storey is a charming,
sympathetic, but very mercenary
young gentleman who takes his love
affairs so casually that trouble fol
lows where a little care might have
made life serene.
The drama centers around the
struggle of Storey with his second
self, who sometimes comes to the fore
to give life a witty and humorous
angle—but who sometimes stands in
the background passionately making
a fool of him.
Ruth Beede, Lucie Bentley, and
Jack McDowell complete the "Second
Man" cast. „
One Set Stands
Harold Helvenston and his Theatre
Workshop have planned the single set
necessary for this production, com
pletely synchronizing with Storey's
character. It carries a note of suave
ness, dignity, and solid good taste of
the "Second Man" and the lightness
and casualness of Clark himself.
Life is presented as the eternal
quadrangle rather than the usual tri
angle in S. N. Behrinan's play, "The
Second Man." This clever comedy will
be presented on the Stanford stage
Friday evening.
Seat sale for the production begins
today at one o'clock in front of the
Women's Clubhouse, at Roble Hall,
and at Keeble's in Palo Alto.
Gordon Davis, '18, as Clark Storey,
Is presenting his annual interpreta
tion. He has been dramatic coach at
Stanford since 1920. During this time
ho has developed campus dramatics
from a very neglected activity to the
position of the little theatre move
ment which it now holds.
Davis has also been successful as
an actor —offering one characteriza
tion each summer quarter. He is well
remembered as the Hon. Hyacinth
Petavel in the "Angel in the House,"
as the mature "beau" interested in
agriculture and women in "Aren't We
All," as the religious fanatic in "Hell
Bent fer Heaven," and as the queen's
husband in the play of that name.
