# Student Forced Down In Air Trip To Sick Father
## 
### 
George W. Friede's airplane trip
to the bedside fo his sick father was
checked by severe headwinds which
forced a landing 120 miles south of
Portland. Further travel by air was
impossible so the trip was completed
by motor.
Friede, a student in the law school,
was notified of his father's illness
July 17 and immediately chartered a
plane from Lieutenant Norman God
dard of the Palo Alto School of Avia
tion. They left at 12:30 but were
forced to land because of strong
headwinds. Lack of ground lights pre
vented further afr travel.
He arrived in Portland at 2:30 a.m.
to find that his father still has a fight
ing chance although his condition is
extremely serious.
