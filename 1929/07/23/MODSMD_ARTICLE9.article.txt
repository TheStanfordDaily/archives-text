# CODDLED CLEIDOICS! SCIENTIST CREATES BARNYARD NOBILITY
## 
### 
"A couple of coddled cleidoics, An
nabel." Try that on your Greek to
morrow morning.
Comes from England a scientist so
scientific that he starts being erudite
at his own breakfast table. Eggs, to
Dr. Joseph Needham, of Cambridge
University, England, assume the
grander aspect of cleidoics. And soon
the rest of us may be able to speak
learnedly of our hen fruit.
Dr. Needham, in a lecture to be
given in the Little Theatre Thursday,
will let us all in on the significance
of the sapient nom de plume. He will
trace the whole development of the
egg from its lowest form, open and
floating in sea water, to its present
high position in the poultry market.
"What ho, Algernon, fetch me a
couple of promicus maniclulatis sonor
iensis—not too much butter —and a
bit of delaturian phrniffisaurus!"
