# THE 						BULL SESSION

ANOTHER VANISHING AMERICAN
Let the bells toll for the old-fash
ioned schoolma'am.
Gone are the days—poetic, if not
happy—when prim, starchy school
mistresses administered unpleasant
doees of knowledge by rule of rod
and "go stand in the corner." Gone
are the thumb-smeared readers whose
contents had to be learned letter-per
fect. Gone, gone, gone—everything is
gone—except the prevalent dissatis
faction with modern educational
methods.
So be it. As long as the discontent
is expressed by the parents and not
by the knowledge-seeking children, all
is yet well.

The modern teacher who goes out
from the commencement hall to her
first high school or grammar school
class is supposedly lacking in experi
ence; naturally, since hasn't even
started on the twenty- or thirty-year
stretch of an old-time teacher. But
she has an equipment as admirably
suited to her profession as a doctor,
a lawyer, or an engineer has for his.

She has a fair foundation of psych
ology, and its practical applications
in the classroom. She knows her own
subject—if not as concretely as her
predecessors, at least satisfactorily—
and a score of other subjects as well.
She is familiar with and appreciates
the problems and difficulties that be
siege the offices of her superiors; and
if she rises to higher offices, she
knows how to meet these vexing
obligations.
Her work will be done, not by rule
of thumb, but as the particular situa
tion demands. She is equipped to
meet the emergencies that will un
doubtedly arise and many that prob
ably won't.

What is the keynote of all this
change? A training in method, in
technique.
In the list of subjects laid out by
the education department of every
modern university, there are ten top
ics of teaching methods for every one
of material to be taught. Twenty
years ago, the courses in method —
where they had begun to appear—
■were decidedly innovations. Now the
teacher's Ph.D. in chemistry or Eng
lish or economics is rapidly being
supplanted by the advanced degree
in education.
A casual observer would remark
that it's a great business to fill a
teacher's head with a lot of stuff
about how to make her class learn
biology when she doesn't know enough
biology to teach it. But an A.B. or
M.A. in her special subject is a fair
indication of her stock of information.
The Ph.D. signifies that she knows
bow to dish it out so that her pupils
will take it and ask for more, and
not turn up their noses —or fall asleep
in lectures.
True, the letters after her name
don't have to mean all that. They
stand for the amount of exposure
she has undergone from experts in
■education. Whether the exposure
took is determined by how many of
her little darlings can later grab off
the A's in college.

about how to make her class learn
biology when she doesn't know enough

ANOTHER VANISHING AMERICAN
Let the bells toll for the old-fash
ioned schoolma'am.
Gone are the days—poetic, if not
happy—when prim, starchy school
mistresses administered unpleasant
doees of knowledge by rule of rod
and "go stand in the corner." Gone
are the thumb-smeared readers whose
contents had to be learned letter-per
fect. Gone, gone, gone—everything is
gone—except the prevalent dissatis
faction with modern educational
methods.
So be it. As long as the discontent
is expressed by the parents and not
by the knowledge-seeking children, all
is yet well.

The modern teacher who goes out
from the commencement hall to her
first high school or grammar school
class is supposedly lacking in experi
ence; naturally, since hasn't even
started on the twenty- or thirty-year
stretch of an old-time teacher. But
she has an equipment as admirably
suited to her profession as a doctor,
a lawyer, or an engineer has for his.

She has a fair foundation of psych
ology, and its practical applications
in the classroom. She knows her own
subject—if not as concretely as her
predecessors, at least satisfactorily—
and a score of other subjects as well.
She is familiar with and appreciates
the problems and difficulties that be
siege the offices of her superiors; and
if she rises to higher offices, she
knows how to meet these vexing
obligations.
Her work will be done, not by rule
of thumb, but as the particular situa
tion demands. She is equipped to
meet the emergencies that will un
doubtedly arise and many that prob
ably won't.

What is the keynote of all this
change? A training in method, in
technique.
In the list of subjects laid out by
the education department of every
modern university, there are ten top
ics of teaching methods for every one
of material to be taught. Twenty
years ago, the courses in method —
where they had begun to appear—
■were decidedly innovations. Now the
teacher's Ph.D. in chemistry or Eng
