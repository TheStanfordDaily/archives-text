# Applications For Big Game Tickets Being Mailed Now
## 
### 
Big Game applications are being
mailed out now. Applications to far
eastern points were mailed Sunday,
and alumni living on the coast will
receive theirs in about ten days.

Students attending the summer
quarter only will come under the
class eight, or last group. The appli
cations that come under this group
this year have a fairly good chance
of getting their tickets as the Big
Game will be held in the Stanford
stadium and it has a seating capacity
of ten thousand more than the Berke
ley bowl.
