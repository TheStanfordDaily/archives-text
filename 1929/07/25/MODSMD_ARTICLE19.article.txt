# We Bowâ€”But We Also Object

### 
We bow to a dean, but we refuse to bow to the Daily Illiiii.
This University of Illinois journal says, editorially, "After 26 years
of laboring for Illinois as the greatest collegiate track coach in the United
States, Coach Harry Gill has decided to take a year's vacation." We don't
wonder. Twenty-six years of supremacy must have been trying.
Coach Gill, it is true, has been one of the deans of American track and
field sports. But a younger generation of athletic tutors has sprung up, and
now the Stanford Daily finds itself objecting to the prideful statement
of its contemporary.
"The greatest collegiate track coach in America." We aren't so sure
about that, Illini. llow about Dink Templeton?
Laugh off the triumphs of Stanford track teams culminating in three
straight 1.C.4-A. victories if you will by saying, "Stanford had the
material," but don't forget that Templeton molded that material into
winning organizations.
Gill had his day, and is still having it. His fame is won.
If you're talking about veteran coaches, by the way, don't forget Walt
Christie of California. His teams also won three straight 1.C.4-A. titles.
And the Golden Bears may come back again.
But right now Templeton is the man.
We bow to the Deans, but in your loyalty, Daily Illini, you might gaze
off into the sunset.
