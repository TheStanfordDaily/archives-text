# DRAMA TREND AT STANFORD FOLLOWS N.Y. STAGE LEAD
## Stage Today Strikes Medium Between Entertaining, Classicalâ€”Seib PLAYS TESTED IN EAST Davis Is Following General Policy of New York Theatre Guild 
### 
Dramatics at Stanford are follow
ing the general trend of the New
York stage. An attempt is being made
to strfke a happy medium between
the classics and plays that serve
chiefly as entertainment, is the opin
ion of Lester Seib, '22, who is known
professionally on the New York stage
as Lester Vail.
"Sophisticated, blas6 New York,"
said Seib, "is the proving-ground of
all plays. The presence of a noted
actor in the cast will not assure the
success of a play on Broadway. Com
petition within the theatre circle, and
that of the movies on the outside,
makes it essential that a play have
merit to survive."
At Stanford, where Seib had his
first dramatic experience, Gordon
Davis is following the general policy
of the Theatre Guild of New York,
which is the greatest influence in
American dramatics, in presenting
plays that are entertaining, and yet
have a high literary value, such as
"The Adding Machine" and "The Sec
ond Man." The Theatre Guild puts
on plays it hopes will be commercially
successful, although its primary pur
pose is to experiment and progress
in a literary way.
The Civic Repertory Theatre, under
Eva le Gallienne, has achieved re
markable success Hi the last few
years presenting plays of a classical
or near-classical nature, such as those
by Ibsen, Shaw, Tchekov, and
Shakespeare.
Seib plans to be in New York about
August 15 to start rehearsals on Lee
Wilson Dodd's "Strong Man's House"
in which he plays opposite Mary
Nash, who played in San Francisco
last year in "The Command to Love."
Coincidentally, the first play Seib
ever saw on the Stanford campus was
"His Majesty, Bunker Bean," which
was also written by Dodd.
