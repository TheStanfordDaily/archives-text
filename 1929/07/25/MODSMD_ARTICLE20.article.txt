# Get In The Swim—But Learn How First
## 
### 
"Although she could swim but a few strokes . .
This is the epitaph to another swimming tragedy.
Most impressive in newspaper accounts of unfortunate deaths on
pleasure outings is the persistency with which certain phrases repeat
themselves.
"The boy, who had gone out too far, found he was over his head . .
"Seized with cramps when he plunged into the water shortly after
eating . .
'"Caught in an undertow when he dashed into the breakers . . .'
"Swimming far out from shore for the first time . .
"Johnson became panic-stricken when his canoe overturned . .
Each one marks a tragedy. And each one is a recurrent phrase.
What is the answer?
Is it all carelessness? Yes. Not the kind that rocks the boat or pulls
the trigger of a gun that was "empty,'' but the sort of carelessness that
seems like courage—going out into deep water —gallantly trying to save a
companion with a few weak strokes —trying to make a far shore.
It's the carelessness of not learning to swim. Lifeguards say that a
heavy percentage of deaths from drowning are in cases where the victim
was either a poor swimmer who knew he was one, and who ventured too
far or got caught in a dangerous situation, or a poor swimmer who
didn't know he was, and who met the same fate.
Self-confidence is a fine thing. It's necessary for a good swimmer, but
it's best to learn first.
Anyone can learn to swim, and swim well. There are pools here and
plenty of instructors. Those who think they can't, or won't, or who just
didn't get around to it had better stay in the wading pool until they
change their minds.
This is an aquatic generation.
Be up-to-date.
Get in the swim.
But learn how first.
