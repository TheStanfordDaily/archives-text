# Dramaâ€”A Leading Stanford Industry
## 
### 
One of Stanford's leading industries.
Dramatics, that is.
Football, and track, and education, and simple rural life.
Stanford is noted for all four. Also the drama.
Don't mind the ancient Assembly Mall. It tries mighty hard to be a
drag-anchor on Stanford theatrics. That it doesn't succeed is due to
Gordon Davis and Harold Helvenston, to that not so vague thing known
as Stanford spirit, and to a generous share of Stanford acting ability.
It's also due to the patient Stanford audiences, who don't take the
Assembly Mall seriously with its creaking seats, curtain that usually sticks,
and the rococo "diamond horseshoe" balcony.
But we won't say anything more about this. For we want you to see
"The Second Man" tomorrow night.
The second summer play marks the annual appearance of Gordon
Davis on the local splintered boards. Actor-director, he will play a mer
cenary author whose "second man" keeps prodding his ambition to lead
a comfortable life by means of an expedient marriage. Monica objects.
You will want to see Monica. Also the pleasant Mrs. Frayne. And Austin
Lowe, the young scientist whose love transcends test tubes.
See "The Second Man." It is a clever example of results in one of
Stanford's leading industries.
For Stanford is near the top of college dramatics.
Some day we'll have a theatre to match our progress.
