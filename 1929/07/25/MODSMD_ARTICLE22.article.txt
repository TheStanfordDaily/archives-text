## Crossing Bats With Superstition 
### 
"The superstitions of today are the
scientific facts of tomorrow." This
was the pill which, swallowed, made
a pleasantly blood-curdling evening
out of "Dracula," from Bram Stoker's
novel, now playing a return engage
ment at the Columbia Theatre, San
Francisco.
A vampire who sucks blood is
scarcely a whimsical character, but
always an interesting one —especially
when he sleeps in his grave by day,
and at night casts a spell over beauti
ful maidens, drawing away their blood
that he may survive another 500
years.
Built on a sound, if weird, dramatic
theme, "Dracula" scorns most of the
patent devices that make fat ladies
scream on Saturday matinees —pre-
ferring to cast a sort of horror over
the audience, based on the dramatic
av/fulness of the theme.
For a victim of the campfire be
comes his creature —roaming the
earth at night seeking new prey, ac
companied by howling wolves and
closely associated with bats and other
unpleasant denizens of the dark. What
could be worse?
Vampires Heavy Neckers
Vampires are heavy neckers, but
they leave two tiny white marks on
the throat, and that is how Dr. von
Helsing knew that Lucy Seward was
menaced by a power beyond death.
Ah! You may laugh, friends, he says,
but finally Jonathan Harker, Lucy's
lover, and even skeptical Dr. Seward
agree to seek out the vampire and
drive a stake through his heart —the
only way to destroy such monsters,
as everyone used to know in the age
of household remedies.
This is no small task when they
are competing against the wisdom of
five centuries possessed by Count
Dracula, who is discovered to be the
Menace because he feels a certain
traditional dislike for holy wafers and
water, and abhors the smell of onions

and wolfbane, as who wouldn't?

Dracula doesn't cast a shadow in
the mirror, so von Helsing might have
been in a bad way if he hadn't re
membered to carry some Holy Wafer
with him. Thus by sundry charms
and a lucky tip contributed by Ren
field, a lunatic who eats flies, then
spiders, and is working his way up the
animal kingdom when released from
Pracula's power by the Allies, Count
Dracula's long reign is halted. The
stake is driven through Dracula's
heart in his last refuge in a dark
vault, and the curtains close on what
was an extremely trying situation for
500 years, not to say two hours and a
half last night.

The cast is excellent. Particularly
good is J. Raymond Brown as Dr. von
Helsing. His naturalistic style of act
ing contrasted effectively with that
of Don Woods as Harker. Wood played
a handsome juvenile in the usual
fashion. Henry Hall as Dr. Seward
was O.K. Hazel Whitmore was good
enough as Lucy. Renfield, a fat part if
there ever was one, drew applause
as played by Harry Walker, because
of the time-worn device of carrying
a line out on an exit, capping it with
the nerve-chilling laugh of stage
lunacy.
Lugosi Swell Vampire
Bela Lugosi was just what a vam
pire should be. Handsome, yet sinis
ter, very much a Stage Presence yet
seemingly unreal, he commanded the
respect and fear to which a Count
Dracula would naturally be accus
tomed. It must be admitted that M.
Lugosi loved to dwell over his words
and revel in his role, but what vam
pire wouldn't?

"Dracula" is an evening spent in a
way you'll seldom spend an evening.
If you haven't seen it before, take a
deep breath, a well-oiled imagination,
forget the annoying Stanford Scienti
fic Method, and go to the Columbia.

are competing against the wisdom of
five centuries possessed by Count
Dracula, who is discovered to be the
Menace because he feels a certain
traditional dislike for holy wafers and
water, and abhors the smell of onions

and wolfbane, as who wouldn't?

Dracula doesn't cast a shadow in
the mirror, so von Helsing might have
been in a bad way if he hadn't re
membered to carry some Holy Wafer
with him. Thus by sundry charms
and a lucky tip contributed by Ren
field, a lunatic who eats flies, then
spiders, and is working his way up the
animal kingdom when released from
Pracula's power by the Allies, Count
Dracula's long reign is halted. The
stake is driven through Dracula's
heart in his last refuge in a dark
vault, and the curtains close on what
was an extremely trying situation for
500 years, not to say two hours and a
half last night.

The cast is excellent. Particularly
good is J. Raymond Brown as Dr. von
Helsing. His naturalistic style of act
ing contrasted effectively with that
of Don Woods as Harker. Wood played
a handsome juvenile in the usual
fashion. Henry Hall as Dr. Seward
was O.K. Hazel Whitmore was good
enough as Lucy. Renfield, a fat part if
there ever was one, drew applause
as played by Harry Walker, because
of the time-worn device of carrying
a line out on an exit, capping it with
the nerve-chilling laugh of stage
lunacy.
Lugosi Swell Vampire
Bela Lugosi was just what a vam
pire should be. Handsome, yet sinis
ter, very much a Stage Presence yet
seemingly unreal, he commanded the
respect and fear to which a Count
Dracula would naturally be accus
tomed. It must be admitted that M.
Lugosi loved to dwell over his words
and revel in his role, but what vam
pire wouldn't?

"Dracula" is an evening spent in a
way you'll seldom spend an evening.
If you haven't seen it before, take a
deep breath, a well-oiled imagination,
forget the annoying Stanford Scienti
fic Method, and go to the Columbia.
—Burnell Gould.
"The superstitions of today are the
scientific facts of tomorrow." This
was the pill which, swallowed, made
a pleasantly blood-curdling evening
out of "Dracula," from Bram Stoker's
novel, now playing a return engage
ment at the Columbia Theatre, San
Francisco.
A vampire who sucks blood is
scarcely a whimsical character, but
always an interesting one —especially
when he sleeps in his grave by day,
and at night casts a spell over beauti
ful maidens, drawing away their blood
that he may survive another 500
years.
Built on a sound, if weird, dramatic
theme, "Dracula" scorns most of the
patent devices that make fat ladies
scream on Saturday matinees —pre-
ferring to cast a sort of horror over
the audience, based on the dramatic
av/fulness of the theme.
For a victim of the campfire be
comes his creature —roaming the
earth at night seeking new prey, ac
companied by howling wolves and
closely associated with bats and other
unpleasant denizens of the dark. What
could be worse?
Vampires Heavy Neckers
Vampires are heavy neckers, but
they leave two tiny white marks on
the throat, and that is how Dr. von
Helsing knew that Lucy Seward was
menaced by a power beyond death.
Ah! You may laugh, friends, he says,
but finally Jonathan Harker, Lucy's
lover, and even skeptical Dr. Seward
agree to seek out the vampire and
drive a stake through his heart —the
only way to destroy such monsters,
as everyone used to know in the age
of household remedies.
This is no small task when they
are competing against the wisdom of
five centuries possessed by Count
Dracula, who is discovered to be the
Menace because he feels a certain
traditional dislike for holy wafers and
water, and abhors the smell of onions

and wolfbane, as who wouldn't?
