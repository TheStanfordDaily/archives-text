"Puebla De Las Mujeres," which by
"How To Speak Spanish in Fifteen
Lessons" means "The City of Women,"
was presented by the Spanish stu
dents of the University last night at
the Little Theatre, and by the number
and good looks of the women who, in
their flaming Spanish costumes,
played the parts, one is almost
tempted to petition Director Gordon
Davis to go to the Spanish depart
ment for aid in casting his produc
tions.
But if this play by Quintero Broth
ers is representative, his contempor
ary drama can learn a lesson from
its English contemporaries in its ac
tion. The play was slowed by over
balance of dialogue, though those who
could follow his subleties must have
been rewarded, judging from the de
lighted reception.
To one whose adeptness at quick
translation is no pride and joy of the
Spanish teachers, the distinct articu
lation of the priest, played by John
Reid, was a boon. When Evelyn Rum
raich, playing the part o fthe village
belle, walked on the stuffy over-fur
nished little stage in the middle of

Act One, followed by a crowd of
colorful, audacious senoritas, she in
troduced the first bit of animation â€”a
grateful element.
Credit goes to Seniorita Elisa Perez
for a smooth-running production.
There was little of that missing of
cues, waiting for lines, and awkward
ness that characterize the usual for
eign language play.
But one thing Spanish students,
even American Spanish teachers,
never seem to be able to emulate, is
that far-famed softness of voice and
rhythm of speech seldom found out
side of Spain.
All in all, the play went over. A
sizeable crowd saw and enjoyed it.
All the parts were competently taken.
