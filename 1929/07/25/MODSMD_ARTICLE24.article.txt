# STAKES MAKE QUAKES! Golfers Need Rubber Clubs MACHINE HEARS PUTTS

### 
Silence! That'll be the password on
the new Stanford golf course. Crap
shooters, gum-cliewers, and knock
kneed enthusiasts of the links will be
barred without mercy! Indian mocca
sins and rubber clubs will be listed
among the required equipment; for
an - uncannily sensitive machine, a
seismograph, will record any shock
from an explosion to a putt.
Professor Sidney Dean Townley of
the Geology department grabbed his
pad and pencil and tramped out to
the earthquake-recording seismograph
in the midst of the new golf course.
Lo and behold! Stanford had suffered
several severe quakes and a flock of
tremors.
While the perplexed professor dili
gently dug his finger-nails into his
scalp, a workman on a nearby knoll
chalked up a seismographic record in
driving a stake. Not a meritorious
one, but. a simple graphic picture of
each hammer blow 011 the University
seismograph.
The mystery was solved. The earth
quake detector has kindly kept record
of nil construction on the new golf
course. Everything from dynamite
blasts to the blows of the excavators'
picks is preserved for the efficiency
division of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
Professor Townley seriously points
out that the vibrations of the power
lawn-mowers and high-pressure water

pipe line may register troublesome
records on the seismograph. In this
event, he thinks, either the course of
the links will have to be changed or
the delicate instrument moved.

Others hope that the situation is not
quite so serious. The seismograph, it
was thought, would be more certainly
protected from jars by having the
golf course surround it, thus perma
nently preventing the encroachment
of roads, than by any other device. If
it develops that water pipes carry
vibrations from the pumps, they can
be relaid further away.
The seismograph on the Stanford
campus is one of a number from
which records are sent to a central
station at the University of California
for compilation and study. It is so
extremely sensitive that it will note
the passing of a truck along a road
half a mile away.

pad and pencil and tramped out to
the earthquake-recording seismograph
in the midst of the new golf course.
Lo and behold! Stanford had suffered
several severe quakes and a flock of
tremors.
While the perplexed professor dili
gently dug his finger-nails into his
scalp, a workman on a nearby knoll
chalked up a seismographic record in
driving a stake. Not a meritorious
one, but. a simple graphic picture of
each hammer blow 011 the University
seismograph.
The mystery was solved. The earth
quake detector has kindly kept record
of nil construction on the new golf
course. Everything from dynamite
blasts to the blows of the excavators'
picks is preserved for the efficiency
division of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
Professor Townley seriously points
out that the vibrations of the power
lawn-mowers and high-pressure water

pipe line may register troublesome
records on the seismograph. In this
event, he thinks, either the course of
the links will have to be changed or
the delicate instrument moved.

Others hope that the situation is not
quite so serious. The seismograph, it
was thought, would be more certainly
protected from jars by having the
golf course surround it, thus perma
nently preventing the encroachment
of roads, than by any other device. If
it develops that water pipes carry
vibrations from the pumps, they can
be relaid further away.
The seismograph on the Stanford
campus is one of a number from
which records are sent to a central
station at the University of California
for compilation and study. It is so
extremely sensitive that it will note
the passing of a truck along a road
half a mile away.
