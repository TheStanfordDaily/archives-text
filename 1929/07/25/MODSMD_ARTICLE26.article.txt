Among the many natural wonders
of the Calaveras park, discovered in
1852 and since preserved by the State
of California, is the "Stump House,"
an enclosure built around the stump
of a fallen Sequoia. The continuous
labor of five men for 22 days was re
quired to saw through this massive
tree which measures 30 feet in dia
meter and is now utilized as a na
tural dance floor. Its polished surface
will accommodate 16 couples, and
twice that number are able to look
on. At the entrance to the park the
road passes through the center of
an upright tree, the "Pioneer's Cabin,"

famous as one of the wonders of the
world.
Trees in the Calaveras grove are
as old as 5,000 years, and in many in
btances measure over 40 feet in dia
meter and to 450 feet in height. One
of these great trees would supply
sufficient lumber to build a dozen
homes.
Fishing, hunting, and horseback
riding are among the sports that the
excursionists will be able to take
part in during their short visit in
Calaveras.
