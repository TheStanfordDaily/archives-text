From Eureka to the Bakersfield oil
fields, the Golden Bear playera are
earning money and conditioning
themselves in preparation for the new
school year beginning August 19 when
they will don their football togs and
prance around the California stadium.

Some of the members of the Berke
ley team may get their signals mixed,
thinking it a customer ordering gaso
line. It is predicted that the Bears
are going to be a hard outfit to beat
this year as they will be much more
elusive than years before as six of
the regulars are working in the oil
fields and will be slippery customers
to handle.
Roy Riegels, center and captain
elect, has been running forward with
wheat sacks at Rio Vista, in hopes
of improving his equilibrium so that
his New Years Day occurrence will
never happen again.
There will be no Red Granges on
the Bears this year as not a member
of the squad is carrying ice. Lee Rice,
halfback, has gone on an apricot diet
in the San Joaquin valley; while Lee
Eisan, last year's quarterback, is play
ing with the kids in West Berkeley.
Benny Lom is in the haberdashery
business in San Francisco.
Ted Beckett, guard, is hanging
around the dock. He is not on the
lookout for rum-runners as his posi
tion on the football team would infer;
he is only a stevedore.
Charles Schmidt, fullback, went to
the Orient in hopes of learning a few
new tricks, but says he is all crossed
up. All the players hope to be as
hard as Axel Lindgren, guard, who is
juggling steel in San Francisco.
