# AMERICAN COMPOSER TO LECTURE MONDAY ON 'ORIENTAL MUSIC'
## 
### 
Henry Eickheim, an American com
poser, will lecture in Toyon Hall Mon
day at 4:15 on oriental music.

Formerly a violinist with the Bos
ton Symphony Orchestra, Eickheim
has devoted the last few years in
collecting and arranging the folk
songs of the East. The melodies,
which for generations have been kept
alive by the working people, each
trade with its particular repertoire,
have been the source of his orches
trations. The street vender's songs
particularly have supplied a wealth
of material which was entirely new
to the western musical world until
Eickheim arranged and conducted
them.

The lecture will be illustrated with
piano selections by Mrs. Eickheim and
by the curious native instruments
upon which the original melodies were
played.
