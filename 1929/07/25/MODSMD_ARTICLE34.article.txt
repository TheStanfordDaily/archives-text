# BRUNO WALTER WILL CONDUCT ORCHESTRA IN SUNDAY CONCERT
## 
### 
Bruno Walter will conduct the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra Sun
day afternoon in the sixth of the
series of concerts given in the Wood
land Theatre at Hillsborough this
summer. This will be the first of
Walter's three concerts which con
clude the series.

Among the rapidly increasing num
ber of European conductors who come
to this country for guest appearances
with American orchestras, few have
made as deep an impression as Wal
ter, one of the best-known of conti
nental conductors, and presiding gen
ius of the famous Munich Festivals
for twelve years. Walter is also con
ductor of the Vienna State Opera and
general musical director of the
Munich Opera.

An added feature of Walter's open
ing concert will be his appearance as
soloist at the piano in the Concerto
Grosso for String Orchestra with
Piano Obligato by Ernest Bloch. It
will indeed be a rare privilege to hear
another great work of the San Fran
cisco composer who conducted his
Epic Rhapsody "America" for the first
time last Sunday.
The complete program follows:
Overture to "Euryanthe" .Weber
Symphony No. 5 Beethoven
Les Preludes Liszt
Concerto Grosso for String Orches
tra with Piano Obligato... Bloch
Walter has the rare ability of being
able to interpret a score as though
the composer's vision had been trans
planted to him. He draws a co-opera
tion from each member of the orches
tra that becomes akin to the music of
a great organ.

The newspaper printed hour by hour
every hour in the clay is not very far
distant, according to Mr. Rene Bas
chet, president of the Paris Press
Association. He predicts a machine
working something like the familiar
ticket but by radio, occupying only a
small space.
