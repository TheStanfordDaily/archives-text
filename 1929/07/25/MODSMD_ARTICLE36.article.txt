# Careless Roble Parkers Win Officer's Attention
## 
### 
Parking cars directly in front of
Roble between the two signs is pro
hibited. Warning has been given
again to this effect, and those opti
mistic drivers who still continue to
use this convenient parking place will
soon find themselves tagged by the
campus traffic officer.

An operation was necessary to get
a pea from the ear of a 6-year-old
Poplar Bluff, Mo., girl.
