# HORRORS! 'BASTILLE' INMATES PUNISHED; HASH, WASH DISHES
## 
### 
Now who thought this up?
The inmates of the Lagunita
Bastille have been subjected to
the crowning indignity. As a
punishment for first lockouts,
girls at Roble Hall are made to
serve at Friday afternoon teas
and wash dishes afterwards.
Frankly, the girls are worried.
"What next?" they say.
One elderly matron was asked
as an honor to pour, last Friday,
and near the end of the after
noon some simple girl (there's
one in every party) came up to
her, astonished.
"Goodness, I only had to be
here two hours for getting in at
3:30 and you've been here all af
ternoon ... !"
