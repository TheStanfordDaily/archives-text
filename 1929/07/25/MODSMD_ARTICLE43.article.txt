# WILTON TO COACH AT BURLINGAME; OBTAINS SANTA CRUZ RELEASE
## 1928 W.S.C. Captain Will Handle Coast High School Team 
### 
Frank Wilton, '29, is out of the
woods.
The ex-Stanford ace will coach foot
ball and baseball at Burlingame High
School.

After extended controversy, Wilton
was released from his Santa Cruz
contract last night by the Santa Cruz
Board of Trustees. Melvin Dressel,
captain of the 1928 Washington State
gridiron squad, is to coach at the
seaside school.

When Wilton graduated he signed
a contract to coach at Santa Cruz.
Santa Cruz had already offered the
position to Dressel, but negotiations
had gone on so slowly that the Cougar
star had taken a commercial position.
A few weeks ago Burlingame proposi
tioned Wilton to coach there. And
Wilton said he would. Pooh-pooh for
Santa Cruz! But Superintendent of
Schools Karl F. Adams didn't see it
that way. He said Wilton could not
become a member of the Burlingame

faculty until his former contract had
been formally annulled. So last night's j
action settles the whole affair to the
satisfaction of all concerned, espe- I
cially Wilton, who apparently prefers j
to coach at Burlingame.
