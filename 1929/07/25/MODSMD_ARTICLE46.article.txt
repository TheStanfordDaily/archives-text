# Finds Amusement In Life

### 
"When the universe no longer holds
any amusement for a man, then it is
time for him to die," according to
Professor Nicholson of the University
of Chicago, who is an authority on
light.
Professor Nichelson is 76 years old
and still finds many interesting di
versions, he states. "1 am still amused
by many things. Science amuses me.
So do my other diversions â€”painting,
tennis, billiards, and playing the
violin."
