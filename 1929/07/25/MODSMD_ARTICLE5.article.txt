# American Interest In Norway Writing New Says Larsen In Talk
## 
### 
"Although Norway took her place
in the world's literature with the pub
lication of Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's
House" in 1789, it is only within the
last ten years that Norwegian litera
ture has awakened American inter
est," declared Dr. Henning Larsen,
acting professor in the English depart
ment, in a lecture on the "Rise of
Modern Norwegian Literature" given
yesterday afternoon in the Little
Theatre.

"The Norwegians are justified in
their pride in their recent literary
popularity," says Professor Larsen,
"for it is only within the last century
that Norway has been as an inde
pendent state." Professor Larsen
bases the tremendous growth of
Norwegian literature within the past
seventy-five years upon this factor.

Professor Larsen explained that
after Norway had gained her inde
pendence from Denmark in ISI4 her
literature reverted to the literature of
the middle ages, for, due to suppres
sion, the Norwegians had been un
able to build up an art and literature
of their own. This national worship
of the ancient form could not last,
and in 1850 Ibsen came to the front
and, within 30 years, brought the
drama to the highest point of per
fection. By 1890 realism had reached
its zenith and a new school arose
with Knut Hamsun's "Hunger" pub
lished in that year.
"The Norwegian novel grew more
slowly than the drama," continued
Dr. Larsen, "but it is now the domi
'nant type of Norwegian literature
both at home and abroad. Knut Ham
sun revolutionized the novel in pro
ducing his "Growth of the Soil" which
won the Nobel prize in 1920. Johan
Bojer, who rose to great heights in
his "Life of the Vikings" and his
"Great Hunger" has also won great
popularity with American readers."
"The most recent Norwegian
writer to win the Nobel prize is
Sigrid Undset, whose novel 'Jenny'
has been translated into English.
"There is a youthful freshness in the
modern Norwegian literature," con
cludes Dr. Larsen, "which is partly
responsible for its growing popularity
and its recognition the world over."

has been translated into English.
"There is a youthful freshness in the
modern Norwegian literature," con
cludes Dr. Larsen, "which is partly
responsible for its growing popularity
and its recognition the world over."

"Although Norway took her place
in the world's literature with the pub
lication of Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's
House" in 1789, it is only within the
last ten years that Norwegian litera
ture has awakened American inter
est," declared Dr. Henning Larsen,
acting professor in the English depart
ment, in a lecture on the "Rise of
Modern Norwegian Literature" given
yesterday afternoon in the Little
Theatre.

"The Norwegians are justified in
their pride in their recent literary
popularity," says Professor Larsen,
"for it is only within the last century
that Norway has been as an inde
pendent state." Professor Larsen
bases the tremendous growth of
Norwegian literature within the past
seventy-five years upon this factor.

Professor Larsen explained that
after Norway had gained her inde
pendence from Denmark in ISI4 her
literature reverted to the literature of
the middle ages, for, due to suppres
sion, the Norwegians had been un
able to build up an art and literature
of their own. This national worship
of the ancient form could not last,
and in 1850 Ibsen came to the front
and, within 30 years, brought the
drama to the highest point of per
fection. By 1890 realism had reached
its zenith and a new school arose
with Knut Hamsun's "Hunger" pub
lished in that year.
"The Norwegian novel grew more
slowly than the drama," continued
Dr. Larsen, "but it is now the domi
'nant type of Norwegian literature
both at home and abroad. Knut Ham
sun revolutionized the novel in pro
ducing his "Growth of the Soil" which
won the Nobel prize in 1920. Johan
Bojer, who rose to great heights in
his "Life of the Vikings" and his
"Great Hunger" has also won great
popularity with American readers."
"The most recent Norwegian
writer to win the Nobel prize is
Sigrid Undset, whose novel 'Jenny'
has been translated into English.
