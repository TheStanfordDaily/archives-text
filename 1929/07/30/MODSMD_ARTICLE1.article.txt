## COLLEGIATE HYPOCRISY 
### 
"The Winds of Freedom Blow."
Many a time has this phrase been
used to picture Stanford in all her
glory, to provide a background for the
many activities on her campus, to
give an important note to the life of
its undergraduates and its alumni.
And many a time has it been a ban
ner held aloft by righteously indig
nant students demanding explanation
for some new bothersome regulation.
Do these winds of freedom blow
over the Stanford campus?
Perhaps they still come sweeping
down on the Quad as they used to in
the early days of the University. Per
haps they still bear the refreshing
inspiration that has heightened the
fame of Stanford. But here and there,
across odd corners and doorways,
have been built walls that keep the
winds outside, and the stifling air
of dogma within.
What is a university which refuses
not only to stimulate thought but re
fuses to allow its presence? A man
derives but little more than memory
exercise when he is forced to apply
kindergarten methods of parroting to
philosophy or history or calculus in
stead of to spelling and arithmetic.
It is time that these hindering walls
of restriction were sought out and
trampled to the ground.
The college man today, to protect
himself, must do what the others do
—cower behind barricades so he will
not take cold from any bothersome
draughts.
If he is to take an examination, he
looks up in his fraternity flies to find
out what he should know. He looks
up old papers to see how the ques
tions should be answered. He takes
his examination, writing down what
he has heard the professor say, writ
ing down what somebody else said on
the same question back in 191 S.

And if he remembers the exact
■words that the professor used —it mat
ters not whether he knows the mean
ing of any of them —he gets an A in
his course. But if he answers the
question as he himself thinks, if he
dares put his own interpretations of
a problem into writing—perish the
thought, he would never last through
the first quiz.

His generation is democratic, is
tolerant to the nth degree. But will
it tolerate him if he chooses to be
anything but democratic? He must
go along with the crowd, do what they
do, think what they think, revolt when
they revolt —be democratic.
His fraternity brothers pick out his
friends, his bootlegger, his activities,
his morals, his suits, and his neck
lies. And a garish pair of socks is as
taboo as a companion who chooses
not to get drunk.

He goes out for the team —to be a
clean player, and win a letter. He
goes out, and listens to his rooters
advising him to do what he can to his
opponents without getting caught for
it.

The winds of freedom blow. So they
do, but not all Stanford rises to offer
hospitality.
