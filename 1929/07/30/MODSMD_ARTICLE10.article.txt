# Campus Pleased with 'Second Man'; Gordon Davis Fulfills Expectations
## Summer Comedy Wins Audience by Appealng Sentiment Rather Than by Mere Humor or Farcical And Comic Situations 
### THE REVIEWER 
A campus audience was well pleased
with "The Second Man." Presented
in the Assembly Hall Friday night, it
was no scathing damnation of the
morals of the younger generation, of
social conditions in Southeast Africt,
or of night life in A Large City Near
Lake Michigan. It was as pretty a
piece of summer comedy as the
venerable hall has seen in many a
year. It was not merely humorous
or comic or farcical: it had a rich,
appealing sentiment which satisfied
the audience.
In other words, it was a pleasant
dessert to top off the dinners served
that evening in the environs of the
campus.
The production of "The Second
Man" marked the return of Gordon
Davis to the Stanford stage—an an
nual event looked forward to with
the greatest of expectations. And
once again Davis made the play. Or,
rather, this time he saved it. One
trembles to think what might have
happened had a less-experienced man
taken the role of Clark Storey.
Davis didn't knock the customers

| into the aisles, nor did he make them
weep with sympathetic delight. In
j stead he made them carry away a
warmth of genial amusement with
a play that refused to resort
to subtleties to be sophisticated.
Whenever he and Lucy Bent ley, as
Mrs. Frayne, were on stage, the audi
ence could rest assured that all would
go well. Each, handling one role per
fectly, was an excellent foil for the
other. Miss Bentley brought her suave,
bland, certain quietness with the
quick, glib, sophisticated banter of
I Davis to the advantage of both. Her
motions, charming and graceful, and
her velvety voice gave her the ideal
maturity for the part.
Ruth Beede, a new acquisition of
Stanford dramatics, made her bow as
a twenty-year-old who absolutely
knew her own mind. In the role of
Monica Grey she provides the hair
tearing influence for her two frantic
lovers. Storey pulls his hair because
he does not want her —Lowe pulls his
i because he cannot have her —at least
until well on in Act 111.
