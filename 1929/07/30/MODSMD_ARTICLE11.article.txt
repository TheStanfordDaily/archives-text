Stanford must have a New Theatre!
Working toward a common goal—the future of dramatics at Stanford—•
students, alumni, and friends of the University are combining their efforts for
an aggressive fall campaign to top the mark set by Hammer and Coffin
Society in January.

Spurred by the continued success of Stanford dramatics, which followed a
brilliant 1928-29 season with the summer's "Adding Machine" and "Second

B>Man," the student committee is at
work on the plan of organization.
A central committee which, when
completed, will contain the names of
15 of Stanford's most famous friends
and graduates, is partly formulated,
it was known today.
Jack Shoup, present student chair
man, who will he succeeded in the
fall by Nelson Carter, is in charge
of the summer organization.
Norris on List
Charles G. Norris, noted novelist,
will aid the drive. Templeton Crocker
| of San Francisco will be on the com
mittee. Mrs. Louis Stern of Atherton,
j whose donations have aided the pres
| ent total of $3,246.66, is to serve. John
Considine, of United Artists, Stanford
1 graduate, may also be on the commit
! tee, and Delmar Daves and Lester
i Vail, ex-Stanford stage stars, have ac
j cepted the appointment. Paul Bis
singer, another graduate, will aid the
! New York program.
Further appointments and accept
ances will complete the central com
i mittee for the fall campaign. Alumni
' clubs will be lined up in the effort to
broadcast the proposed plan, and all
chances for early success of the Fund
will be explored.
Chappie Editor Leads
Shoup is chairman, as 1928-29 edi
tor of Chaparral, published by Ham
mer and Coffin Society, founders of
the Fund. Don Fletcher, new business
manager, who will succeed Dick Holt,
is on the committee, with Carter,
1929-30 editor.
Merle Emry, as fall editor of the
| Daily, Ralph Campiglia, dramatic
manager; Alfred Esberg, Katherine
Kelio, Burnell Gould, and Harriet
Huntington complete the student rep
resentation.
Gordon Davis, director of dramatics,
and John Sellards, endowment secre
tary and director of the summer quar
ter, are also on the Theatre Fund
organization committee.
Cost Figure $350,000
The estimated cost of a complete,
modern theatre and workshop is
$350,000, according to figures released
this spring. Present problems include
decision concerning the site of the
theatre, and possible linking with the
War Memorial fund, amounting to
more than $150,000.
The new theatre will supplant the
present Assembly Hall, which has
long been inadequate for the growth
of Stanford dramatics.
Hope that Stanford, along with its
plays, would have a school of the
theatre for the West to match the
splendid Yale drama school has been
mentioned as an added incentive to
the campaign.

Manchuria, with a population of
7,500,000, smoked 8,500,000,000 cigar
ettes last year.
