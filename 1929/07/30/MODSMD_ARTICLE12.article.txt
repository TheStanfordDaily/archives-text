# Henry Eickheim Lauds Early Oriental Music in Lecture at Toyon
## Mrs. Eickheim Illustrates Speech With Piano Selections 
### 
Oriental music greatly transcends
our present-day compositions is the
belief expressed yesterday by Henry
Eickheim, student of oriental music,
in the Toyon club room. He showed
the difference between the oriental
and the occidental music, especially
stressing the subtlety and rhythm of
the Orient.
"With crude instruments of bam
boo, carefully constructed, the Orien
tal has achieved heights of rhythm
little dreamed of by our present-day
musicians. His music lias been so re
fined that since 700 A.D. there have
been no new compositions whatever."
Eickheim compared this with present
day occidental music, of which there
were no compositions written before
the eighth century. The Oriental had
reached perfection when the Occident
al had barely started.
Eickheim also declared that if the
Occidental would lay aside his racial
prejudice, and incorporate oriental
ideas in his music, it would be greatly
improved.
Mrs. Eickheim, his wife, illustrated
the lecture with several piano num
bers. Eickheim was once a member
of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
He has spent many years in the Orient
studying its music, and now resides
in Santa Barbara where he has been
composing music the last few years.
