# Brown Dubs American Intellectual Class As 'Political Slackers'
##

"Brambles are in our legislatures,
city lialls, and congress, because the
better material of our country is un
willing to be drafted for service. This
government 'of, by, and for the peo
ple' will not run itself," said Dr.
Charles Reynolds Brown in his last
sermon here at Stanford, Sunday.
"The intellectual element of the
United States is apathetic. They
feather their nests, lie down, and ex
pect others to do the work. They pay
their taxes, overlook the eighteenth
amendment and traffic regulations,
and expect good government. In real
ity they are political slackers."
Dr. Brown said that the world is
"burdened with a lot of excess bag
gage, both material and spiritual."
He recommended "moving periodically
to get rid of this impediment which
adds no pleasure and only fills space.
Especially, habits of mind become ex
cess baggage," he said.
"What We Live By" was the sub
ject of the sermon which was built
around the four important phases of
man's life: "Faith, Love, Citizenship,
and Employment."
"The Bible has been the best seller
for centuries"; in 1928 six million
copies were sold. "This," said Dr.
Brown, "shows the importance of re
ligion to man."
But intellectual and spiritual quali
ties must have the basis of a well
ordered and economic life. And the
industrial machine of today makes
cogs of men, with the ruining of their
cultural and family life as a result.
