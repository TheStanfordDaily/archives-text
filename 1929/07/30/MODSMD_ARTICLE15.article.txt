# CELLAR FINDS EVENING HOURS POPULAR; WILL RETAIN LATE CLOSING
## 
### 
Financial success has attended the
experiment tried out last week of
keeping the Cellar open until 11
o'clock. This will be the closing time
during the remainder of summer quar
ter unless the drop in attendance for
the last five weeks makes the longer
hours unprofitable.
If it does become essential to
shorten hours again the Cellar prob
ably will close at 6 o'clock rather
than at 9, because the trade during
those hours does not cover operating
expenses. Business after 10 o'clock is
said to be sufficient to cover the loss
sustained earlier In the evening.
The cash-and-carry idea will be con
tinued throughout the quarter.
