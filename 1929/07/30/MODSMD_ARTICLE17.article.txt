# History (and Mr. Ford) Repeat
## 
### 
Henry Ford invented a new car. He is less successful at new epigrams.
In an interview noted by the valued Los Angeles Times in the current
issue of the Christian Herald, the Peace Ship pilot, in addition to calling
any man who drinks unfit to be a laborer, says that "gasoline and liquor
do not mix."
Very well, Mr. Ford, very well, but you didn't say it first.
The honor goes to our own Ray Lyman Wilbur. In fact, Dr. Wilbur
said it better â€”"Gasoline and alcohol do not mix."
We thought then, by the attendant publicity, that it was the shot heard
round the world, but Mr. Ford must have been out on one of his antique
hunts at the time.
Mr. Ford, we have been told again and again, thinks history is the
bunk. And history repeats itself.
But Mr. Ford repeats somebody else.
