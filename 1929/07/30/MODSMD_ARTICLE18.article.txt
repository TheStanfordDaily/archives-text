# Charity on Horseback
## 
### 
Judging less on its merits as a show than on its results for a good
cause, the Menlo Circus was eminently worthwhile.
The Stanford Convalescent Home for Children, figures indicate, will
be the richer by four thousand dollars.
There was something peculiarly pathetic, maybe even a little ironic,
in favored children —rich, tutored, healthy—playing games on horseback
in front of a colorful peninsula audience in order that less fortunate
youngsters might have an even break for happiness.
The forthcoming Horse Show on the campus—one of Palo Alto's big
events —will donate its profits to the same fine charity.
Stanford students, in their own annual drive, give what they can and
then go out on Labor Day and work for the Home —work at rebuilding,
clearing land, making firewood from huge trees —as their part in backing
Stanford's own charity.
Everyone has a chance to help the Convalescent Home.
The Daily extends the thanks of the student body to the Menlo Circus
for its annual aid; it congratulates the management of the Palo Alto
Horse Show on its chance to help the Stanford children again.
It all helps to make sick youngsters well.
