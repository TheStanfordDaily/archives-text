# A 						Common Need—A Common Goal

Today's front page carries the announcement, subject to extension, of
course, of the fall campaign for Stanford's New Theater Fund.
It is important that this campaign succeed.
Students, and close friends of Stanford dramatics have brought the
fund near the $4000 mark. This sum, one hundred times over, will build
a real Stanford Theater and provide facilities for a school of the drama
unsurpassed in the West.
The Fund to date is better as publicity than anything else, though it
does represent the organized efforts of students—awakened to a vital need
which the Administration has recognized, but cannot fulfill.
But the Theater needs a rallying ground to give color to the fall
campaign.
And Hammer and Coffin Society, Fund founder, has provided the
theme.
"Stanford," as a Chaparral editorial said, "needs a common hope and
ambition—later to become a monument to common achievement—which
would be a bond of unity for its students and alumni."
We heartily concur.
Stanford needs a common ambition.
Stanford needs a Theater!
