# OPPORTUNITY IN CAPEK PLAY FOR LEADING ROLES-DAVIS
## "Makropoulous Secret" to Offer Wide Variety of Character Parts DEALS WITH AUSTRIANS Tryouts To Be Held Tonight In Little Theatre for Drama Aspirants 
### 
With two woman leads and six good
men's parts, casting for "The Makro
poulos Secret" will offer more range
and opportunity than the previous
plays on the summer program.

Emilia Marty, unemotional and dis
tant, is directly contrasted by Kris
tina, young, enthusiastic, and earnest.
Baron Prus is dignified, but offers
possibilities reaching to the dramatic,
while his son, Janek, the juvenile
lead, is carried away by his emotions.
Distinctive character parts are found
in the parts of Dr. Kolonaty, Hauk-
Sendorf, and Vitek.
Tryouts will be held tonight in the
Little Theatre between 7 and 8 o'clock
for those who are interested, but have
not previously tried out. Second try
outs will be held at 8 o'clock for the
following:
E. Verna Hannah, Irene Mansfeldt,
Elizabeth Larsh, Lily Chloupek, Dor
othy Tully, Helen Mielke, Howard Ad
dlestone, Powell Carpenter, Boyd
Homewood, Neville Woodruff, Charles
Wade, Morlin Bell, Roland Eberhart,
Carl McDowell, Kenneth Higgins,, Ed
ward Field, John Yeon, John Hiestand,
Robert Kirkwood, Jack McDowell,
Bromley Smith, John Jago.
The play, one in direct contrast to
the others of the summer quarter,
concerns people of old Austria-Hun
gary, and reaches some melodramatic
points.
"Such a wide variety of types are
included in this play that .many op
portunities are offered for the devel
opment of new campus material,"
says Gordon Davis.
