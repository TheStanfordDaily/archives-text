# Get a Better Peachâ€”If You Can
## 
### 
When the University gives a hand to the Government look what
happens!
We get a new kind of peach.
W. F. Wight, Stanford graduate, puttering around in the experi
mental orchard which he has created on the campus, has evolved a peach
that not only ripens before any other freestone, but is expected to be
unsurpassed for canning. It will be yellow to the pit, without the red
streaks which show up dark in canning.
We sincerely hope that this will have improving effect on the local
peach pie problem, although the crust situation looks hopeless.
And Mr. Wight has left a box of frnit with "Ye editor."
Call again, Will, when you've got a new watermelon.

No More War Week. It's not merely talk this time. Nations arc
taking concrete steps in this direction. How about a No More War
Century ?
