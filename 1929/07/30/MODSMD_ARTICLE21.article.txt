Marked admiration was shown by
the Hillsborough audience for Bruno
Walter, who so skillfully directed the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
last Sunday afternoon in the sixth of
the series of summer concerts given
in the Woodland Theatre at San Ma
teo. The rare interpretative ability of
Walter was shown in every selection,
and both audience and orchestra
members succumbed to his magnetic
directing power.
Weber's popular Overture to "Eury
anthe," presented at the Woodland
Theatre for the first time, formed a
brilliant introduction to Sunday's pro
gram. From the opening theme, which
is developed with great power, the
movement passes into a graceful mel
ody, followed by a selection of Largo
for eight violins, and finally develops
into an episode which grows in volume
and strength until it culminates in a
brilliant and effective coda.
Under the conductor's vision, the
spirit of Beethoven lived again in his
Symphony No. 5 in C minor, the sec
ond number on the program. The first
movement of this symphony is a won
derful example of thematic invention,
and the second, the Andante, noted for
its beautiful slow movements, is real
ly a theme with variations of incom

parable grace and delicacy. The
Scherzo, gigantic with the intense de
velopment of the two themes, leads
without pause into the fourth move
ment which is reached by a heavy
crescendo and terminates in an ex
ultant, triumphant song of joy and
victory.
An outstanding feature of the con
cert was the presentation of Ernest
Bloch's classical "Concerto Grosso."
In this presentation Walter displayed
his musical talent by conducting the
String Orchestra and rendering the
piano obbligato at the same time.
Franz Liszt's symphonic poem, "Les
Preludes," effectively concluded the
unique program. This composition in
terprets life as a series of preludes
to that unknown song of which the
first solemn note is struck by Death.
In the Andante, the spirit of Love is
broken by Death's storm, and the
wounded soul seeks to indulge its
memories in the calmness of nature.
Out of this calmness the soul is
awakened with a new war tune, and
the air of fate hangs heavy over all.
The audience realized the greatness
of the conductor as he brought the
final movement through the first ex
pressive strain in tempestuous joy to
the original theme ringing once more
in serene majesty.

his musical talent by conducting the
String Orchestra and rendering the
piano obbligato at the same time.
Franz Liszt's symphonic poem, "Les
Preludes," effectively concluded the
unique program. This composition in
terprets life as a series of preludes
to that unknown song of which the
first solemn note is struck by Death.
In the Andante, the spirit of Love is
broken by Death's storm, and the
wounded soul seeks to indulge its
memories in the calmness of nature.
Out of this calmness the soul is
awakened with a new war tune, and
the air of fate hangs heavy over all.
The audience realized the greatness
of the conductor as he brought the
final movement through the first ex
pressive strain in tempestuous joy to
the original theme ringing once more
in serene majesty.
Marked admiration was shown by
the Hillsborough audience for Bruno
Walter, who so skillfully directed the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra
last Sunday afternoon in the sixth of
the series of summer concerts given
in the Woodland Theatre at San Ma
teo. The rare interpretative ability of
Walter was shown in every selection,
and both audience and orchestra
members succumbed to his magnetic
directing power.
Weber's popular Overture to "Eury
anthe," presented at the Woodland
Theatre for the first time, formed a
brilliant introduction to Sunday's pro
gram. From the opening theme, which
is developed with great power, the
movement passes into a graceful mel
ody, followed by a selection of Largo
for eight violins, and finally develops
into an episode which grows in volume
and strength until it culminates in a
brilliant and effective coda.
Under the conductor's vision, the
spirit of Beethoven lived again in his
Symphony No. 5 in C minor, the sec
ond number on the program. The first
movement of this symphony is a won
derful example of thematic invention,
and the second, the Andante, noted for
its beautiful slow movements, is real
ly a theme with variations of incom

parable grace and delicacy. The
Scherzo, gigantic with the intense de
velopment of the two themes, leads
without pause into the fourth move
ment which is reached by a heavy
crescendo and terminates in an ex
ultant, triumphant song of joy and
victory.
An outstanding feature of the con
cert was the presentation of Ernest
Bloch's classical "Concerto Grosso."
In this presentation Walter displayed
his musical talent by conducting the
String Orchestra and rendering the
piano obbligato at the same time.
