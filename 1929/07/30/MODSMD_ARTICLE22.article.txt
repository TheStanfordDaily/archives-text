# LITERARY DIGEST TYPE OF MAGAZINE SUMMER FAVORITE
## 
### 
Stanford's taste in magazines, ac
cording to the Bookstore's sales, dif
fers in the summer from that of other
quarters. Although the accepted
"best-sellers" retain the lead, the
trend is toward such periodicals as
The Forum and The Literary Digest.
The most popular publications at
any time, however, include Good
Housekeeping, The American Maga
zine, The Pictorial Review, Woman's
Home Companion, and any of the
screen magazines. Harper's sells
steadily to a few readers. The Satur
day Evening Post and Collier's are
popular in the nickle field. Liberty is
nut handled by the store.
Humor magazines are popular but
noticeably so in the fall, winter, and
spring quarters. Life has been in de
mand since it entered the ten-cent
class. All Stanford and other collegi
ate publications find their best sale
in the regular session.
The Atlantic Monthly and Scrib
ner's are no more sought than the
"adventure stories," and Popular
Mechanics is a better seller than The
Scientific American in all quarters.
The more sophisticated and expen
sive magazines, chiefly The American
Mercury, Vogue, and Vanity Fair, are
not in great demand.
