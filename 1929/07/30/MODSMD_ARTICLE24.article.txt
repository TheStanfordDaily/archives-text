# Attitude Of Youth On War Discussed By Law Student
## 
### 
Bates Booth, Stanford law student,
presented the protest of youth against
war at a "No-More-War Week" cele
bration in the Palo Alto Community
House Sunday. He classified univer
sity students into three groups in their
attitude toward war: cynical, indiffer
ent, and idealistic, and said the glori
fication of peace and the deglorifica
t.ion of war are the best hopes of the
peace movement.
"The youth movement —the violent
and bitter psychological reaction
against the war-makers —has died be
cause young people meeting in inter
national congresses are now unable
to agree on whom or on what to lay
the responsibility for war," Booth
stated.
