# DR. HENRY SUZZALLO SPEAKS AT ANNUAL EDUCATION BANQUET
## First Graduate of Stanford Department Praises Dr. E. P. Cubberley 
### 
"It is more deplorable that many
great minds never reach college than
that many stupid ones do," declared
Dr. Henry Suzzallo, trustee and re
search associate of the Carnegie
Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching, who spoke at the annual
banquet of the education department
in the Union Saturday evening.

Dr. Suzzallo, ex-president of the
University of Washington and former
member of the education faculty, is
the first graduate of the education
department. He lectures at Columbia
University.

"There is no scrap-heap of human
society," he asserted. "Every indi
vidual should have an equal oppor
tunity and every kind and degree of
talent that is socially usable should
be trained. We need a new conception
of the responsibility of education to
the state and society as the brain
firder, By taking account of individu
ality we can make education as broad
as human nature, so that it will be
come a greater power and a more
helpful institution."

According to Dr. Suzzallo, a war
between two philosophies of educa
tion —the academic and the social —is
now on and the social is winning. The
academic philosophy is supported by
the learned professor and the social
by the aspiring democratic people.
The social is ascendant in the ele
mentary school and the academic will
steadily lose ground in the secondary
school unless it clarifies its social
philosophy.

"The American school system is the
most decentralized," Dr. Suzzallo
said. "It is closer to parents and
pupils than any other." He predicted
a complete system of health educa
tion and a new dependence on charac
ter development and the psychology
of feeling and explained the need of
studying the history and philosophy
of education and comparative educa
tion with which students are impa
tient.
Dr. Suzzallo praised the breadth of
vision of Dean E. P. Cubberley of the
School of Education, declaring that no
one is contributing so much to a
working philsopoliy of education and
conferring the "honorary degree" of
"D.A.D." on Dr. Cubberley, who was
given an ovation.
"I am glad to see so many of my
boys back for summer work," said
Dr. Cubberley, who founded the de
partment in 1898.

"In the future the work of the de
partment will center in seminars and
a large, well-equipped library with
less emphasis on lectures." He told of
the growth in numbers and advance
ment in type of work made by the
education school and predicted that
teachers' colleges would take charge
of a large part of master's degree
work.

"What are you going to do about
teachers smoking?" "Are boys smart
er than girls?" and "What about mar
ried women teachers?" are the ques
tions most frequently asked of him
by reporters, said Vierling Kersey,
state superintendent of public in
struction. "It is up to us to help the

newspapers get true, worthwhile in
formation."
"Educational legislation ought to
be proposed by the best-thinking edu
cators and not by selfish sectional
groups," Kersey maintained. "There
was no state-wide organization at the
last legislature which initiated legis
lation for the benefit of the teachers
and school finance and organization
laws which are so much needed."
Dr. Harold Benjamin of the educa
tion faculty was toastmaster at the
banquet which was attended by 260.
The Marguerite MacManus String
Quartet of Oregon State College
played.
