"Japan is the logical mediator be
tween Russia and China," said Pro
fessor Yamato Ichihashi in his talk
on the Manchurian question at Roble
Sunday night.

"Russia because of her unstable
government is neither a member of
the League nor has she diplomatic
relations with many of the powers.
This leaves Japan as the logical na
tion to aid in the settlement," he con
tinued.

Ichihashi also believes that there is
little danger of a war because neither
nation is in a position financially to
fight. Because of the political turmoil
in both of the nations, each govern
ment must appear strong and compe
tent, not only to the world, but also
to its own citizens.

There has been much newspaper
talk and opinions expressed concern
ing the whole situation, many of
which are entirely unfounded, said
Professor Ichihashi, who thinks that
arbitration is the only solution to
the problem. Ichihashi advocates the
return of the Chinese-Eastern railroad
to Russia, whose claim is much
stronger than China.
