# CLAIMS REFUTED
## 
### 
The July 20 issue of "Aviation"
carried "An Analysis of Airplane
Landing Speeds" by Assistant Pro
fessor Elliott G. Reid of the Daniel
Guggenheim Aeronautic Laboratory.
The article refuted the claims of
manufacturers of planes on a theo
retical basis. Many commercial planes
claim landing speeds that are slower
than theory permits.
