### 
The Stanford Convalescent Home
treasury is richer by more than $4,000
as a result of the eighth annual Menlo
Park Circus. Spectators that crowded
the grandstands Saturday saw a
Spanish carnival put on, for the
most part, by children.
Following the formality of a sedate
"Grand Entry," various tests of horse
manship and competitive drills were
presented. The intricacies of "Bending
roles" and a "Stake Race" were suc
ceeded by a minature bull fight.
"Musical Chairs," played by chil
dren mounted on horseback, ended
eventually in a tie. Grown men,
mounted on small ponies, competed in
the Menlo Sweepstakes, and the antics
of clowns filled in between each event.
The Circus was complete in every
detail, with Roman riders, a magician,
and even "elephants."
Miss Edith Walkut, the Queen of
the Circus, presented the prizes to
the winners of the various events.
Clarence R. Walter, the ringmaster,
was surprised when he was presented
with a cup from all the children who
took part in the affair.
