# DR. NEEDHAM REVIEWS EVOLUTION OF EGG IN LITTLE THEATRE TALK
## 
### 
The evolution of the cleidoic egg.
That was the lecture given in the
Little Theater Thursday by l)r. Jo
seph Needham.
He traced the constituents of the
well known hen's egg to the combi
nation of lower forms, especially sea
life. In the course of the lecture it
developed that the cleidoic egg should
not be attributed only to the hen, but
to a long series of egg producing
organisms dating to the time when
life began. No longer should it be
considered merely a hen's egg, but
rather a highly developed combina
tion of the eggs of fishes, frogs, toads,
snakes, and lizards.

Dr. Needham is a professor of Cam
bridge University, England. Both he
and his wife are noted research
workers.
At the Hopkins Marine Station in
Monterey Dr. Needham is continu
ing the research work he has carried
on at the marine stations of Ros
coff, France, and Millport, Scotland.
Following their Stanford stay, Dr.
and Mrs. Needham will attend the
Physiolocial Congress in Boston.
