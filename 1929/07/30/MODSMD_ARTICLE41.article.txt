# CARDINAL FOOTBALL PLAYERS MAKE GOOD IN FIELD OF COACHING
## 
### 
Although Stanford grid warriors
have won great renown for their su
periority at the old Grecian sport,
the number of Cardinals who de
velop into coaches is considered one
of the best tributes to "Pop" Warner
and his world-famous system.
In the past three years no less than
nine coaches have been produced un
der the influence of the Card football
machine. All of these men held first
string positions.
Last year those who emerged from
their college football careers with
coaching ambitions were Frank Wil
ton, Lawrence "Spud" Lewis, Theo
"Spud" Harder, and Don Robesky.
Wilton, flashy halfback, who fur
nished many a thrill for Stanford
rooters, has recently accepted a
coaching position at the Burlingame
High School. "Spud" Lewis, consist
ent backfield ace, who alternated be
tween quarter and half, has been
given the job as backfield coach at
Northwestern University in Illinois.
The other "Spud," Harder, is pre
paring for a position at the Bakers
field Junior College this fall. Don
Robesky, one of the best guards in
Stanford's history, will get his first

experience at the coaching game next
season assisting Murray Cuddeback.
with the Stanford Grays.
During the year previous only ono
member of the graduating gridders
chose coaching as a livelihood. That
was Chris Freeman, giant tackle, who
is grid-mentor of Alameda High.
In 1926 four more of "Pop" War
ner's proteges were turned into the
coaching profession. Captuin Fred
Swan, another of Stanford's stellar
guards, took the position of coaching
the Burlingame High School team,
where he has remained the last two
years. In August he will go to Col
gate College as line coach. Ted Ship
key and Ed WaTker, as good a pair
of ends as ever donned football cleats,
are well situated. Shipkey is holding
down a coaching job at the Sacra
mento Junior College, while Walker
will go to Columbia next season to
take charge of the line. Leo Harris,
who made his reputation at tackle, is
working as coach of the Fresno High
School squad.
