# DR. SCHLICK OF VIENNA COMPARES EUROPEAN, AMERICAN COLLEGES
## Academic Freedom Stressed At Vienna University; No Examinations 
### 
Vienna or Stanford? If a Stanford
student were asked to choose between
a Central European university and
Stanford, lie would be torn between
the academic freedom of the foreign
institution and the thrill of the ath
letic field of the American.

Transferred to an Austrian univer
sity, the Stanford student would be
greatly impressed by the vast differ
ence between the living conditions
and educational practices of the Euro
pean institution, according to Dr.
Moritz Schlick, visiting professor of
philosophy, from the University of
Vienna.
Probably the first difference to be
noted would be that of the academic
requirements. In the Vienna univer
sity a student is absolutely free to
take any course he pleases, so long
as his work amounts to ten hours a
week. He is under no obligations, so
long as his work amounts to ten hours
a week. He is under no obligations
to attend lectures, and there is 110
control in this respect. Professor
Schlick doubts whether this freedom
is really good for the student, but
states that it forms a stimulus for the
professor to make his lecture as in
teresting as possible, in order to
avoid empty classrooms.
No Examinations
The Stanford student would, no
doubt, be surprised to find that there
are usually no textbooks, no official
assignment of reading, and no exami
nations during the semester or at the
end of it, except those a professor
might require for admission to semi
nar work. The only official examina
tion in Dr. Schlick's own department
is that for the Ph.D. degree, and here
the student must show the real abili
lies and knowledge he has acquired
in at least four years of self-chosen
major and minor studies.
The idea of academic freedom is
also expressed in the personal life of
the students. They live in private
rooms any place in the city, and quite
unlike Stanford, the University has
no dormitories, except one, rather far
from the college, for the poorer stu
dents.
Students Poor
The self-supporting Stanford stu
dent would find Vienna life very try
ing. Since the war most of the Aus
trian students are very poor, and the
competition for student work is so
great that it is practically impossible
to find work in any outside profes
sion. The chief way of earning a liv
ing is by giving lessons, and often
the Vienna students lead very heroic
lives of privation.
In the Austrian universities sports
and games are given little emphasis.
Gymnastics, swimming, riding, fenc
ing, and football are being cultivated
and encouraged, but all of these are
expensive, and the average student
has neither time nor money to in
dulge in them. "I am convinced that
at the present time it is much more
the economical status than a different
mental attitude toward physical edu
cation, that is responsible for the com
paratively small importance of sports
and games in Austrian student life,"
says Professor Schlick.

The close proximity of the Alps to
the Austrian universities (Graz, Inss
bri'ch, and Vienna) is certainly a cir

cumstance for which the Austrian stu
dents may be envied. It offers an op
portunity for mountain climbing and
skiing which is impossible in Stan
ford's vicinity. But according to Pro
fessor Schlick life on a beautiful cam
pus like that of Stanford, in the best
of all climates, seems very much hap
pier than a burdened life in a crowded
city like Vienna with its two million
inhabitants.
According to Dr. Schlick, govern
ments and institutions should do
everything in their power to enhance
the international spirit in the insti
tutes of learning and to make them
a center of mutual understanding.
The interchange of students between
the universities of different nations
as well as the exchange of professors
will help to create this spirit of in
ternational fellowship.
