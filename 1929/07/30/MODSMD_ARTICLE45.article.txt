# ENTIRE NATION SENDS 1100 ENTRIES TO VIE FOR $20,000 STAKES
## Nationally Known Horsemen Appointed Judges in Annual Exhibition 
### 
Eleven hundred entries have been
filed for the Third Annual Palo Alto
Horse Show, to be held August 3-10 on
the Stanford campus. This number is
greater than has been entered in any
horse show previously held on the
Pacific Coast.
There will be ten performances,
seven in the evenings, and three mati
nees. The matinees will be held on
Saturday, August 3, Wednesday, Au
gust 7, and Saturday, August 10.
At a meeting a few days ago in the
office of Louis Oneal, San Jose attor
ney and horse fancier, it was an
nounced that a group of San Jose
business men would donate ten tro
phies and three $100 prizes. This
brings the cash prizes to $20,000 and
increases the number of valuable
trophies.
Nationally known judges have been
engaged to award the ribbons. Henry
Cullins, of Devon, Pennsylvania, will
judge the harness horses, hunters, and
jumpers; Charles Green, of Moberly,
Missouri, the three- and five-gaited
horses; and Marco Hellman, Los An
geles, the stock horses. The show is
under the management of A. P. Flem
ing.
The battery of flood lights which
will illuminate the ring at night have
been placed and tested. A canopy over
the grandstand, a new feature this
year, will furnish shade for the mati
nees and act as a windbreak in the
evenings. The ring is being covered
with a new layer of tanbark.
