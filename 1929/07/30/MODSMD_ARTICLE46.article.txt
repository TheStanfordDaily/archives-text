# Memorial Church Locked At Night To Protect Art
## 
### 
Why is the Memorial Church locked
at night? This incident, as related
by one of the student guides, may
serve to answer this question.
"It was just about closing time in
the Memorial Church and a few vis
itors were scattered around admiring
the murals. On approaching one man,
who seemed to be attentively study
ing a piece of mosaic work, I saw that
with the aid of a nail file he was dili
gently laboring to loosen one of the
blocks of mosaic in the wall."
