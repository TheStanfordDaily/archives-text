# Students Injured As Car Overturns At Mills Field
## 
### 
Two Stanford students, George
Mauser, Alpha Tau Omega, and Joe
La Brie, suffered cuts and abrasions
early Saturday morning when the car
in which they were driving struck a
bridge near Mills field and overturned.
It was an hour before the men could
reach the San Mateo Hospital as the
road was almost deserted. La Brie,
who came out the worst in the wreck,
had to have ten stitches taken to
close a scalp wound.
The damage done to the car was
estimated at $700.
