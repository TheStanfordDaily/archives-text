# New Peach Developed by W. F. Wight '99 to Aid Packing Industry
## Fruit Perfected in Orchard Of U.S. Department Of Agriculture 
### 
A new variety of freestone peach,
more suitable to canning, has recent
ly been perfected in the Stanford ex
perimental orchard of the United
States Department of Agriculture by
W. P. Wight, '99, government orchard
ist and university lecturer, it was an
nounced today.
Streaks of red that darken upon
canning and that have always been a
detriment to the peach canning indus
try have successfully been eliminated
from this lately evolved variety. The
new fruit is a clear yellow throughout
and is consistently shaded when
cooked.
Wight states that the' new peach
will ripen three or four days later
than the Arp or Clingstone variety,
which is the earliest- yellow peach of
the season. It is expected that in the
interior valleys the new all-yellow
freestones will ripen a fortnight be
fore any other variety of the peach
family.
Another peach that is similar in
characteristics to the new variety, dif
fering only in the date of ripening,
has also been perfected by Wight.
The description of experimentation,
which has extended over a period of
several years, and the names of the
evolved fruit will be announced
through the pomological journals. Dis
tribution of wood for propagation of
either of the peaches will be withheld
indefinitely.
