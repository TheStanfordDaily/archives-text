# RABBI WOLSEY TO INTERPRET SHAKESPEARE PLAY TONIGHT
## Modern Understanding of "Merchant of Venice" Offered Campus SHYLOCK PICTURE FALSE English Writer Ignorant of Jewish Character Says Tuesday Lecturer 
### 
"I do not think that Shakespeare
ever knew a Jew."
Rabbi Louis Wolsey, former presi
dent of the Central Conference of
Amreican Rabbis, believes there are
many conceptions of the Jewish char
acter which are false and unjust, due
primarily to its misrepresentation in
Shakespeare's Shylock. He will speak
in the Assembly Hall at eight o'clock
this evening on "A Jew's Interpreta
tion of the Merchant of Venice."
Rabbi Wolsey's address deals with
the career of Roderigo Lopez, the
Jewish physician of Queen Elizabeth,
the history of the Jews in England
until their expulsion in 1290, and the
folk-tales which form the background
of Shakespeare's drama. He also in
terprets the character of Shylock in
terms of Jewish ideals of life.
Fixed a False Idea
"Many in the Occidental world be
lieve Shylock a faithful portraiture of
the Jewish personality. Even Scott in
his portrayal of the beautiful soul of
Rebecca and Dickens portraying a
fino Jewish character have not been
able to overshadow Shakespeare's re
vengeful and truculent Shylock."

This lecture is one of a series that
Rabbi Wolsey has delivered through
out the country this summer, under
the auspices of the Jewish Chautau
qua Society of America. He has
spoken at many of the leading uni
versities, including Idaho, Washing
ton, Oregon, the State Normal College
at San Diego, and the University of
Southern California.

Rabbi Wolsey is a graduate of He
brew Union College, Cincinnati. He

merous other communal societies.
Rabbi Louis I. Newman of the Tem
ple Emanu-el, San Francisco, who is
at present living in Dean George B.
Culver's home on the campus, says of

great power and insight. He has dis

States, and is active in the promotion
of social justice through religious in
stitutions."
