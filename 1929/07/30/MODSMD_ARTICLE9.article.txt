# NO SWIMMING FOR MEN; ENCINA POOL CLOSES AUGUST 10
## 
### 
Stanford men will be without
a swimming pool beginning Au
gust 10. This announcement was
made today by the Board of Ath
letic Control following reports
of the engineers in charge of the
construction of the three new
pools that the pool now being
built will not be ready in time to
be used this quarter. There will
consequently be no swimming
the last three weeks of this
quarter.
The Encina tank will be closed
August 10, and will be torn down
to permit construction of the new
wing of the shower rooms. Engi
neers found that the concrete
would not be hard enough to al
low tilling the pool under con
struction now, and it was felt
that it would better serve the
interests of the students to finish
the construction work this quar
ter.
It is planned to have all three
pools ready for use and the new
shower rooms, sand pits, and
bleachers finished by October.
