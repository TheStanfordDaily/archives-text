## IF A COLLEGE MAN BITES A DOG— 
### 
The eyes of the world fastened lit
tle more tenaciously on Pope Pius XI
when he recently left his sanctified
residence in Vatican City than they
do on the college man when he steps
off his university campus.
True, no newspaper headlines or
blaring bands greet the collegian, for
he makes his reappearance in the
world every week-end, while the Pope
made his first return from isolation
only last month. But the crowds that
give their intense attention to the
Holy Father at Rome who can do no
wrong also give each week equally
eager scrutiny to the younger gentle
man who can do considerable.

Let this not be sacrilege, but the
college man may justly join hands
with his more illustrious fellow-schol
ar in a common burden: each is on a
pedestal because of his role.

What if he be a godly man, if he
take a cold shower every morning,
brush his teeth, shine his shoes, drive
a Chevrolet roadster, smoke no cigar
ettes, drink no liquor, mouth no pro
fanity, speak to no women, sleep eight
hours a day, watch his diet, and
graduate after four years with a C

average in economics? Even if he be
such a Menckenish student, the mod
ern collegian is a marked man.

He need not have a brilliant sticker
on his windshield when he blows into
San Francisco or Los Angeles or
Peoria. He need not have his college's
name on his belt or its letter or. his
watch-fob. He is labeled from the
start.
His conversation is dissected by all
-with whom he may come into contact.
His slang, his breeziness, his sophisti-

cation, his didactic comments are
greedily absorbed by his listeners.

His clothes are microscopically ex
amined by his observers. His necktie,
his socks, his shirts, the hang of his
trousers, the cut of his coat, the tilt
of his hat are all on exhibition.

His every movement —the places he
goes, the friends he meets, the car
he drives, the games he plays, the
books he reads, the shops he patron
izes—are watched with undying inter-

As long as he behaves like a per
fectly good, harmless, uninteresting
American, he is merely a specimen
on display. But let him do anything
that Dear Aunt Agatha might frown
upon—or the Rapacious City Editor
might gloat over —then it's "College
Student in Hit-Run Crash," "Rum
Drive Nets Collegians," "University
Students in Midnight Orgy," "Police,
Students Clash in Egg Riot," "College
Man in Love Pact."
When any youth of fifteen to thirty
five throws an egg, breaks a window,
kills a cat, take 3 a drink, starts a
fire, hits a telephone pole, resists an
officer, or belabors his wife, it is re
grettable. If this selfsame youth has
an A.8., is striving for an A.8., or at
one time wanted an A.8., his antics
are front-page material.

"If a dog bites a man —that's noth
ing. But if a man bites a (log—that's
news!"
And if a college man bites a dog—
—Milton Silverman.
