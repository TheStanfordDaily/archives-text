# BRUNO WALTER TO CONDUCT ORCHESTRA AGAIN AT SUNDAY HILLSBOROUGH SYMPHONY CONCERT
## Noted European Composer to Include Mozart's Selection, "Kleine Nachtmusik," as Feature on Program; Modern Work by Prokofieff Requested 
### 
Those who attended the concert
given last Sunday in the Woodland
Theatre where Bruno Walter wielded
his baton over the personnel of the
San Francisco Orchestra need no
urging to take advantage of the privi
lege of hearing Europe's most distin
guished conductor again next Sun
day.
Music-lovers and symphony orches
tra enthusiasts by the score are
glorying in (he feast of music being
served in the final concerts of the
Woodland Theatre series, with Walter
the presiding genius.
Programs Differ
Because of the policy established
this season, whereby the programs
given Sunday afternoons differ some
what from those given in San Fran
visco Tuesday evenings, many patrons
are taking advantage of the opportun
ity to hear two programs each week
conducted by Walter during his brief
stay in Northern California.
Complying with a request of the
music committee, Walter is including

in liis second program a very modern
work, "The Symphonic Classique" of
Serge Prowofieff.
This has a special interest, since
in writing this work, the Russian
composer attempted to catch the
spirit of Mozart and put down that
which, if he were living now, Mozart
might have put into his scores.
Since Walter is very generally ac
cepted as the greatest living inter
preter of Mo'art, his reading of this
modern work will prove unusually in
teresting.
Numbers Listed
The complete program will be:
Mendelssohn's Overture to "Midsum
mer Night's Dream," Prokofleff's
"Symphonic Classique," Berloiz's
"Benvenuto Cellini," Mozart's "Kleine
Nachtmusik," Wagner's "Siegfried
Idyl" and "Overture to Rienzi."
The program also includes a real
Mozart composition, "Kleine Nacht
musik," one of the almost innumer
able works which Mozart wrote for
special occasions.
