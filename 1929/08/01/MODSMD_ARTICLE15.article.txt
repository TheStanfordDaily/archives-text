# The
						Cellar Reforms, But...
## 
### 
The Cellar, laughingly known as an eating place, has instituted a few
long-needed reforms. It can stand few more.
Students need no longer, after nine o'clock, brace their courage and
enter Palo Alto fooderies. They can eat on the campus till eleven.
They can, that is, if there's anything to eat. For the Cellar, following
out a traditional policy, runs out of edibles shortly after breakfast, and
from that time on has only Union sandwiches.
The milkshakes are always available, but anyone who had ever visited
a certain Palo Alto creamery (advt.) would take the local product as a
chaser, nothing better.
Self-service is now the rule. But every rule has exceptions, and some
have already taken exception to this one. However, it isn't so bad, and
it keeps many a regular quarter hasher in trim for the fall season.
The next step will be to have students getting their own stuff behind
the counter, mixing their own concoctions, etc. This will be a distinct
improvement, but progress must come slowly.
Only then will we know the intricacies of the Union management —
understand the operation of that effective mechanism which extracts
(and utilizes) all the bitterness from the coffee bean—or comprehend
the efficiency of the bread-staling machine.
But we must not be hypocritical, for after all, the Cellar did extend
its hours. And it has got one of our favorite carved tables in the room.
Maybe when the new store is finished things will be top-notch.
Maybe.
And by the way, while they're about it, we wish they'd re-tint the
Old Union's outside wall.
