# A
						Show in a City That Knows How

### 
San Francisco, "the city that knows how," was mighty proud of its
Panama Pacific International Exposition in 1915.
But for six months this year an American sculpture exhibit sur
passing even the wonders of that famous exposition is 011 view near the
Golden Gate.
Thousands have seen this magnificent display at the Palace of the
Legion of Honor. But thousands more haven't.
It is not too early to suggest that you "avail yourself of this oppor
tunity" to see what is probably the greatest exhibit of American sculpture
ever brought together.
Those regular quarter students who didn't visit the Palace before
they left for the summer will be out of luck, for the display will be
about ready to close when they get back in October.
