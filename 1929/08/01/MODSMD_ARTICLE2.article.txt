# RABBI SCORES SHAKESPEARE PORTRAYAL OF MONEY-LENDER
## Prejudice Against Jews Has Resulted From Pen of English Writer PLEADS FOR TOLERANCE Racial Religions, Philosophy Lead to World Peace, Contentment

"Shakespeare has given the Jew a
bad name."
Ratybi Louis Wolsey, former presi
dent of the Central Conference of
American Rabbis, believes that the
characterization of the Jew in the
"Merchant of Venice" is largely re
sponsible for the attitude the western
world has taken toward the Jewish
race, customs, and philosophy, as
truculent and bloodthirsty.

Rabbi Wolsey spoke Tuesday night
in the Assembly Hall on the subject,
"A Jew's Interpretation of the Mer
chant of Venice."

Dr. Wolsey believes that Shake
speare never actually saw a Jew. He
thinks this highly probable, since the
Jews were exiled in 1295 under Ed
ward I, and not allowed to return
until the time of Oliver Cromwell,
which was after Shakespeare's death.
Name Now Symbolic
"In the first place," Dr. Wolsey says,
"the name Shylock is not Jewish,
but in the consciousness of the west
ern world, has come to be symbolic
of the Â£]lizabethan Jew and of the
Jewish race today."

"Shakespeare took his entire plot
for 'The Merchant of Venice' from a
i
story in Spanish literature. It is a
peculiar coincident that in 1585, nine
years before the 'Merchant of Venice'
was written, a 'pound of flesh' trial
took place in Rome, in which judg
ment was given by the Pope. In this
case, the Christian wagered with the

Jew a great sum of money against a
pound of the Jew's flesh.

"In judgment, the Pope declared
that the Christian could claim his
debt if he cut no more and no less
than the pound wagered. In the end
they were both thrown into prison
for having made a wager which was
| a menace to the state."
Based in Fact
"Shakespeare used the plot, but re
versed the characters. What would
have been the decision of the Duke
; and Portia if Antonio and Shylock
| were differently placed? Would Portia
I have asked Antonio to have mercy?"
i Rabbi Wolsey thinks not.
"The whole story of the "Merchant
!of Venice" is contrary to the Jew's
i religion. Not one element in the play
j displays a knowledge or understand
ing of the Jew."
Rabbi Wolsey concluded his ad
dress with a plea for religious toler
ance. "Humanity is like an orchestra.
It is made of brass and concussion
and wind and vibration. Each unit has
its own tone to offer.
"If all the parts become unified
there will be music, but it will lack
vivacity and power and expression.
Cut if each part retains and develops
[ its originality and the whole is under
I the leadership of a master, there will
!be beautiful music.
"So it is with the world. Let the
Jews and the Christians and the
Mohammedans build their own belief
and philosophy. Then harmony and
content and peace will result.
