# STANFORD PHYSIOLOGY DEPARTMENT ATTENDS CONGRESS AT BOSTON
## 650 European Scientists To Meet With Americans For Conference

Stanford's entire physiology depart

by a single fellow countryman. This
is the first time the conference will
be held in the United States.
According to Professor E. G. Mar

added that this will be a very great
scientific occasion.
The conference, held every three
years, convenes at Boston, August 12
to 23, with Professor W. H. Howell of
Johns Hopkins as the president. Six
hundred and fifty foreign scientists
and from 600 to 1000 Americans are
expected.
Professor Martin leaves tonight and
Doctor Joseph Needham of Gonville
and Caius college, Cambridge, who
lectured here recently on the cleidoic
egg, will leave tomorrow with his
â– wife.
Members of the physiology depart
ment leaving are: Professors O. P.
Jenkins, E. G. Martin, J. P. Baumber
ger, J. R. Slonaker, F. W. Weymouth,
G. D. Shafer, John Field, V. E. Hall,
I). W. Whitaker, and two graduate stu

Professor J. M. Luck, biochemist, Pro
fessor C. H. Danforth, anatomist, and
Professor P. J. Hanzlick and M. L.
Tainter, pharmacologists, are to at

The conference is now in its 39th

developments among physiologists
throughout the world.
