# Iowans Thought Hoover Stanford Home in L. A.
## 
### 
Just another summer tourist.
Yesterday one of those new Fords
loaded with folks from the lowa corn
belt stopped in front of the Union.
"Say, where's President Hoover's
home?" they asked a student. He
wearily directed them in the general
direction of San Juan Hill.
"What university is this, anyway?"
one of the party asked.
"Stanford! We thought Stanford
University was in Los Angeles!"
Oh, C. of C., where is thy victory,
Oh, McNamee, where is thy sting!
