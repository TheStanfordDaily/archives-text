# JINX PLAGUES BETA HASHERS; ACCIDENTS ALL IN DAY'S WORK
## 
### 
The hashers at the Beta sum
mer boarding table are marked
men. Accidents to these "knights
of the dining room" are but
mere trifles in the common pur
suit of life, as five out of six of
them have been in wrecks or
melees of some kind.

Dean Torrence started the ball
rolling when he was severely
burned in a gasoline fire. Neville
Woodruff was next in line when
glass claimed its price for mis
use. Torrence had no sooner re
cuperated than the pillow cases
were changed on his bed at the
hospital for Jack Stewart to take
his place with a minor case of
blood poisoning.

An automobile wreck Saturday
gave Joe La Brie a deep scalp
wound and a few bruises, while
Monday night George Thompson
received cuts in the face and
hands from the knife of a pedes
trian whom he had picked up.

Bill Bullis, the only hasher re
maining unscathed, was notice
ably nervous when he was serv
ing the coffee yesterday morn
ing. He has decided to tote his
trusty flint-lock for protection
against the elements.
