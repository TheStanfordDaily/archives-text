# New Chinese Culture Lies In Democracy Is Belief Of Dr. T.Z.Koo
## Social, Political, Industrial Life Now Undergoing Great Change 
### 
"Modern China has left the old cul
ture and is steadily attaining its new
vision of complete democracy," de
clared Dr. T. Z. Koo of Shanghai,
China, in a lecture given yesterday
afternoon in the Little Theatre.
"China's emergence as a new na
tion began when the East and West
definitely met about a century ago,"
continued Dr. Koo, "and out of the
mingling of these two entirely differ
ent cultures came fermentation and
progress for China."
West Brings New Ideas
"Into China, the West brought the
ideas of democracy, practical science,
socialism, and individualism," said
Dr. Koo. "These four points of con
tact have brought about the political,
intellectual, industrial, social, and
moral revolution of China."
Dr. Koo states that politically the
Chinese people have turned their
backs on the old autocracy and are
beginning to think together as one
people. The scientific and practical,
instead of the old ethical training,
are now emphasized in Chinese edu
cation. The industrial revolution can
be seen in the change from the small
unit industry to mass production with
the ushering in of scientific methods."
What the Future Holds
"The social revolution of China
hinges on the change in family or
ganization and the social status of
Chinese women," said the lecturer.
"Clan loyalty is now giving way to
national loyalty, and Chinese women
are taking their place in the outside
world."
"Eventually China will settle down
to an organized form of government,"
concluded Dr. Koo, "but this develop
ment will come only through the
union of the central and local govern
ments, political training, moderniza
tion of material China, and the ad
justment of China's international re
lations."
