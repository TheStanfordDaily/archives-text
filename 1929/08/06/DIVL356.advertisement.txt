Geo. S. Parker's
"Touch-and-Go"
Method
Makes Writing Twice as Easy
Touch a Parker Duofold Pen to paper and off it
goes with a steady, even flow as fast as you can move
your hand.
No pressure! The light weight of the pen itself—
28% lighter than rubbei —does it all! No effort, no
fatigue.
This is Geo. S. Parker's 47th improvement. 32 pen
patents are included —36 years' experience in making
fountain pens.
Here is true efficiency in the Modern Style —five
flashing colors, all in Non-Breakable barrels.
This master pen is "guaranteed forever against all
defects, so you are sure of satisfaction lasting through
the years.
Parker Duofold Pencils and Parker Duofold Pens,
matched in color, make handsome sets.
Look for the imprint, "Geo. S. Parker—DUOFOLD."
That mark identifies the only genuine.
"To prove Parker Duofold is a pen of lifelong per
fection, we offer to make good any defect provided
complete pen is sent by the owner direct to the factory
with 10c for return postage and insurance.
