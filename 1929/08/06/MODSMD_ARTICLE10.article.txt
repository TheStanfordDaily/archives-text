# COMIC OPERA PLANNED FOR STANFORD WINTER QUARTER
## Gilbert â€“ Sullivan Show Favored If Move Is Approved 
### 
Comic Opera, long seen as a desir
able addition to Stanford's stage pro
gram, is being considered for winter
presentation. The treasured lyrics and
melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan, the
past century's fondest musical mem
ory, may be revived for Stanford
audiences.
While plans are only tentative,
pending decision concerning available
talent for the leading roles, there is
a definite possibility that strong back
ing would be enough to clinch the
idea.
Since the success of "Princess Ida,"
one of the minor Gilbert-Sullivan
shows, at Stanford several seasons
ago, there has been an increasing de
mand for a revival of one of the bet
ter-known operas of this famous pair.
The evergreen "Mikado," or per
haps "The Pirates of Penzance,"
"H.M.S. Pinafore," or "Patience"
lead the list of suggestions.
At that time the difficulty of secur
ing singers capable of giving full ef
fect to the cleverly synchronized Gil
bert-Sullivan tunes and lyrics stood
in the way. Tryouts, however, were
never held to prove this obstacle an
actual one.
Now it is believed that, if neces
sary, singers close to University cir
cles may be used for the most exact
ing roles. The Stanford Men's Glee
Club would, it is believed, furnish a
sturdy chorus, with the women's or
ganizations, backed by tryouts, filling
the list.
Gordon Davis, director of drama
tics, is for a Stanford comic opera.
So is Warren D. Allen, University
organist, who is now away on an
Eastern trip. They are for a Gilbert-
Sullivan opera, though a Victor Her
bert opus may possibly be considered
as less difficult.
Decision, in the fall, will rest on
the available talent.
