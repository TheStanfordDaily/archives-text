"The flowers that bloom in the spring (tra la)
Have nothing to do with the case."
For it will be winter —a California winter, it is true, but still winter —
when this famous couplet from "The Mikado" will be heard by a Stan
ford audience.
Of course, this is premature. In the first place, plans to stage a
Gilbert and Sullivan comic opera are tentative, to say the least, in the
second place, "The Mikado" may not be chosen.
Personally, we hope it is. Ko-Ko, the Lord High Executioner, and
Pooh-Bah, Lord High Everything Else, will always be amusing, no
matter how many times they strut the boards.
"Tit Willow" will always be ridiculously sad, "Three Little Maids
from School" ridiculously gay, and "To Let the Punishment Fit the
Crime" just ridiculous.
But no matter how much the older generation may weep tears of
laughter at the memory of the Savoy shows, the younger generation will
never know the joy of comic opera just by hearing Ma hum a tune
while baking pies or listening to Pa tell of the first time De Wolf Hopper
ever played in "Yeoman of the Guard."
In these days of "The Desert Song" it is well to know that better times
are past, but not past revival —that musical shows existed which were
tuneful, but didn't take themselves too seriously, and that were delightful
without being mere froth.
So Gilbert-Sullivan should be given a break on the Stanford stage,
not to discourage Junior Operas, but just to show future student authors
what can be done.
We aren't so sure that Stanford hasn't the musical talent, either. The
most difficult productions have eventually been well cast.
Stanford, in the fall, will continue having a good, if obscure, glee
club, plus a lot of good talent that never got a chance in a school where
music is chiefly heard from imported concert artists.
The era of Stanford song, famous memory of the past, is best fostered
by definite "musical extensions."
We arc for a revival of comic opera at Stanford.
