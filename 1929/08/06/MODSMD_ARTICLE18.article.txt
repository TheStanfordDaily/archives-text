						New Appointment—and a Good One

### 
Stanford has been fortunate in the men who have held the position of
physician superintendent of its hospitals since it entered the field of
medical education with the absorption of Cooper Medical College in
1908. Once more it is fortunate in securing Dr. Ralph Berger Seem,
from the University of Chicago, whose appointment to this post is
announced today.
In Dr. George P>. Somers, who joined the medical school faculty in
1911, and in Dr. Richard G. Brodrick, who succeeded him upon his death
in 1927, and who only recently died, the University had the services of
men well-trained in hospital administration.
Dr. Brodrick before his death had largely completed the major details
of the new Stanford hospital, the erection of which will be under way
before long.
Dr. Seem comes to his duties in time to bring his experience to bear
on the completion of these plans and on the designing of the new Palo
Alto hospital which will be built on the campus to replace the outgrown
structure in Palo Alto.
With sixteen years' service in conducting university hospitals, sup
plemented by careful study of the progress of hospital planning and ad
ministration in America and in Europe, Dr. Seem is exceptionally
qualified to take charge of Stanford's expanding hospital equipment.
