## Oxford Professor to Defend Idea on Philosophical, Ethical Grounds OFFERS NEW VIEWPOINT Summer Session Instructor at U. C. Little Theater Speaker Tonight 
### 
Philosophy and Eugenics.
Dr. Ferdinand C. S. Schiller, Eng
lish protagonist of humanism, will
link the two in a lecture on "Eugenics
as a Moral Ideal." He speaks tonight
at 8 o'clock in the Little Theatre.

Much interest has been displayed
lately in the study of Eugenics. Most
of the work in this science has been
| done, however, by physiologists or
j psychologists. There are many people
who have opposed this work on the
| grounds that to apply the principles
of eugenics to the human race is im
' moral.
Dr. Schiller introduces both a de
] fense of this application and a new
element into the subject itself, since
ihe speaks from the standpoint of
J ethics and philosophy.
Dr. Schiller, of the faculty of Cor
i pus Christi College of Oxford Univer
i sity, is visiting professor of philo
sophy this summer at the University
| of California.
The English pragmatist is the au
; thor of several modern books on sub
j jects in the philosophical field. Among
i them are "Riddles of the Sphinx" and
l "Formal Logic."
The lecture is open to the public.
