## Duffy Play Given World Premiere 
### 
A combination of crook drama, ro
mance, and hilarious farce, "Cooking
Her Goose," received its world pre
miere Sunday .night at the Alcazar.
Henry Duffy annouiiced its production
as somewhat of an experiment—if
San Francisco audiences show their
favor, he will take it to New York.
And San Francisco audiences approve
—at least a staid, solemn crowd of
first-nighters howled with delight
from curtain to curtain.
Petite Nydia Westman was by far
the hit of the show. She, as Nancy
Gray, is the New York heiress that
sets two millionaire families on ear
with her interrupted elopement. Find
ing her life at home just absolutely
unbearable —"I can't go on with
things, there's no going back" —that
she inveigles poor Dickie Mercer, Jr.,
mamma's little boy, to elope with her
to Atlantic City.
Elopement Is Fizzle
But Dickie isn't the man for her,
she discovers, and she ditches him.
Not, however, before she gets mixed
up in a murder and robbery, with the
murder committed in her own apart
ment. So she leaves Dickie tearing his
hair, and the Atlantic City police de
partment swearing out search war
rants by the carload.
Inclement weather —meaning a
lightning storm so real that folks in
the first aisle began feeling for um
brellas —forces her to seek shelter at
the bachelor quarters of John Blaine,
a big stock and bond man taking a
vacation. And since she is just that
type of girl, she ruins his vacation,
too.
Plot Thickens
Visitors arrive, Sergeant Daly—"l'm
seldom wrong, lady," Blaine's fiancee,

Dickie's father and doting mother,
Nancy's mother and eruptive father,
chauffeurs, butlers, servants, crooks,
blackmailers, and —and the eternal
newspaper photographer.
By the middle of tlip third act, one
can well believe that the heroine and
her various embryo husbands will be
hung, at least, tor half a dozen bur
glaries. But, since "Cooking Her
Goose" is a comedy, the last curtain
comes down on a comparatively peace
ful community —with the exception of
Nancy's father, who stiU vows eternal
damnation on somebody's soul.
Cast Well-Polished
It is difficult to pick the outstand
ing characters in such a well-polished
cast. Miss Westman, of course, is a
red-headed minx that has earned her
right to have her name in the bright
lights. Joseph De Stefani, playing the
role of her father, gathers more than
his share of laughs.
Jason Robards, as John Blaine, is
obviously the kind of man fond
mothers would like their daughters
to meet. Clean and upstanding, with
a sense of humor, and all that. His
fiancee, played by Miss Natalie Moor
liead, is what fond mothers would not
like their sons to meet.
Sergeant Is Success
And up with Miss Westman one
must put Leo Lindliard, the hard
boiled, know-it-all, cigar-chewing Ser
geant Daly. Were he but to stand in
the middle of the stage, legs sprawl
ing all over the locality, and cigar
stuck in his face, he would be a suc
cess.
Go see "Cooking Her Goose." Go,
not to see a new play, nor to see a
comedy that seems headed for Goth
am, but for an evening crammed to
the full with top-notch entertainment.
