# Bruno Walter Scores Second Triumph
## 
### 
Bruno Walter, one of the most im
posing orchestral conductors in the
musical world today, admirably dis
played his dominating power and
executive ability Sunday afternoon in
the seventh of the series of summer
concerts given under the auspices of
the Philharmonic Society of San Ma
teo at the Woodland Theatre in Hills
borough.
The noted European conductor has
proved to be one of the most popular
of the guest conductors of the sum
mer. Through his facility to direct
grand opera as well as symphony or
chestras, Walter has risen to a posi
tion of fame matching that of Arthur
Nikisch.
The introductory number to his con
cert Sunday was Mendelssohn's Over
ture from the Music to Shakespeare's
"A Midsummer Night's Dream." The
fresh spontaniety of the instrumenta
tion clearly represents the fantastic
scene from the forest with all its
sparkling elfishness. The knavish
pranks of Puck are delicately inter
woven with the fairy dignity of the
meeting of Oberon and Titania.
Prokofieff's Symphonie Classique,
Opus 25, is characterized by an ele
mental and almost savage directness,
accompanied by an artistic delicacy.
The composition seems to show itself
clearly as a Russian transcription of
Mozart.
The Overture to "Benvenuto Cellini"
provided a tempestuous contrast to
the two lighter numbers in concliul

ing the first half of the program. The
"bandit of genius" is felt to be the
dominating figure of the picturesque
background of the Roman Carnival.
The bravado and daring of the amaz
ing scoundrel vaunts itself in the
whirl of the music.
Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Serenade
for String Orchestra, Mozart's little
Serenade, opened the second half of
the program. Neither the sequence
of movements nor the structural fea
tures are subject to rigid rules. The
principal theme of the Rondo (Allegro,
G major, 2-2) is heard five times in
the course of the movement, although
not always in the same key.
A Siegfried Idyl, Wagner's tribute
to his wife, Cosima, and to their son,
Siegfried, reveals the depth of the
composer's emotional feeling for his
family. The quiet power, the peaceful
force, and the delicate strength of
the composition reflect Wagner's sym
pathetic understanding and his ap
preciation of the inspiration furnished
him by his son.
The Overture to "Rienzi" was a bril
liant conclusion to Walter's program.
It opens with a deeply impressive,
slow movement, announced by trum
pet calls, introducing Rienzi's prayer
for the people. Its strength, in strik
ing contrast to the quiet power of
A Siegfried Idyl, lies in its vigorous
intensity of feeling. The brasses for
tissimo bring the overture to a close
in a tremendous clash, founded on
the battle-hymn of the opera.

woven with the fairy dignity of the
meeting of Oberon and Titania.
Prokofieff's Symphonie Classique,
Opus 25, is characterized by an ele
mental and almost savage directness,
accompanied by an artistic delicacy.
The composition seems to show itself
clearly as a Russian transcription of
Mozart.
The Overture to "Benvenuto Cellini"
provided a tempestuous contrast to
the two lighter numbers in concliul

ing the first half of the program. The
"bandit of genius" is felt to be the
dominating figure of the picturesque
background of the Roman Carnival.
The bravado and daring of the amaz
ing scoundrel vaunts itself in the
whirl of the music.
Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, Serenade
for String Orchestra, Mozart's little
Serenade, opened the second half of
the program. Neither the sequence
of movements nor the structural fea
tures are subject to rigid rules. The
principal theme of the Rondo (Allegro,
G major, 2-2) is heard five times in
the course of the movement, although
not always in the same key.
A Siegfried Idyl, Wagner's tribute
to his wife, Cosima, and to their son,
Siegfried, reveals the depth of the
composer's emotional feeling for his
family. The quiet power, the peaceful
force, and the delicate strength of
the composition reflect Wagner's sym
pathetic understanding and his ap
preciation of the inspiration furnished
him by his son.
The Overture to "Rienzi" was a bril
liant conclusion to Walter's program.
It opens with a deeply impressive,
slow movement, announced by trum
pet calls, introducing Rienzi's prayer
for the people. Its strength, in strik
ing contrast to the quiet power of
A Siegfried Idyl, lies in its vigorous
intensity of feeling. The brasses for
tissimo bring the overture to a close
in a tremendous clash, founded on
the battle-hymn of the opera.
Bruno Walter, one of the most im
posing orchestral conductors in the
musical world today, admirably dis
played his dominating power and
executive ability Sunday afternoon in
the seventh of the series of summer
concerts given under the auspices of
the Philharmonic Society of San Ma
teo at the Woodland Theatre in Hills
borough.
The noted European conductor has
proved to be one of the most popular
of the guest conductors of the sum
mer. Through his facility to direct
grand opera as well as symphony or
chestras, Walter has risen to a posi
tion of fame matching that of Arthur
Nikisch.
The introductory number to his con
cert Sunday was Mendelssohn's Over
ture from the Music to Shakespeare's
"A Midsummer Night's Dream." The
fresh spontaniety of the instrumenta
tion clearly represents the fantastic
scene from the forest with all its
sparkling elfishness. The knavish
pranks of Puck are delicately inter
woven with the fairy dignity of the
meeting of Oberon and Titania.
