# SOCIAL SERVICE OF TWENTIETH CENTURY LAUDED BY TUPPER
## Salvation of People Now Second Requisite of Christian Church 
### 
The idea for social service, and a
conscious attempt to perfect a work
ing plan for social service, are the
great gifts of the twentieth century
to the world, according to Dr. Kerr
Boyce Tupper. Dr. Tupper stated in
his sermon Sunday in the Memorial
Church that the world is now re-enact
ing the drama of Cain. The voice of
God is asking of each one of us where
our brothers is and how it fares with
him.
Dr. Tupper sees in the movements
of the world toward peace, and the
interest of the people in social service
work the answer to these questions
of God. The people of the twentieth
century, giving their best for social
service, are making themselves the
keepers of their brothers.
The awakening of the social con
science and the brotherhood of man,
says Dr. Tupper, is the second duty
of the church. The perfect religion is
the religion which cares first for the
individual and his salvation, and the
second is to care for the people as a
whole and their salvation. The church
of this century is beginning to fulfill
this second requisite of Christianity
and is, thereby, reaching a fuller
meaning.
"Man's first duty is to man, and
man's first sympathy is with man,"
maintains Dr. Tupper. The parable of
the Good Samaritan is the greatest
guide for our social service work, and
he believes that with the ideal of our
brother's welfare before us we shall
reach that peace on earth for which
we strive.
