# REVIVAL OF ANCIENT PASTIME ON CAMPUS; FREEMAN NABS FOX
## 
### 
Fox hunting, that old English
custom, is now occupying the
time of Stanford's students, al
though in a somewhat Ameri
canized form, the horses and
hounds having been eliminated.
However, none of the zest of,
the sportsman's sport is lost in
transferring it to a two-legged
basis, according to Chris Free
man who bears the distinction of
being the first to capture a fox
in the most recent edition of the
game. Freeman and other mem
bers of University eating clubs
pursued a fox Saturday until the
quarry was finally ridden down
near the new swimming pool.
