# BLACK MOUNTAIN FIRE SEEN FROM CAMPUS NOW UNDER CONTROL
## 
### 
The brush fire in the Black Moun
tain district near Mt. Hamilton, which
was visible from the campus Sunday
night, was believed to have been
brought under control yesterday after
noon.
A more serious fire, which has
burned approximately 40,000 acres of
the Pacheco Pass district near Gilroy,
claimed its first victim yesterday
when an employe of the Miller and
Lux lands died from burns received
Sunday.
As a precautionary measure against
fires on the campus, Chief Dugan has
been burning all hazardous grass
patches. He has been employed in this
work for over a week and has covered
all parts of the campus where it is
possible to keep the fires under con
trol.
