# SATURDAY AUTO TOUR TO LICK OBSERVATORY PLANNED BY SELLARDS
## Tourists to View Planets Through Huge Telescope On Mt. Hamilton 
### 
Stanford's "star" excursion will be
repeated this week-end when the
sixth tour of the summer session
winds its way to the Lick Observa
tory on Mount Hamilton.

Majestically situated on the highest
peak of the coast range, 23 miles east
of San Jose, Lick Observatory com
mands a view for a radius of 300
miles. The astronomical colony is a
department of the University of Cali
fornia, and is fully equipped with the
world's latest apparatus.
A refracting telescope 75 feet in
length, one of the largest ever con
structed, is contained in the massive
observatory dome. The entire organi
zation was a gift to the University
of California from James Lick, Cali
fornia philanthropist, in the late '80's.

The excursionists on the previous
trip, made in the early part of July,
were given the opportunity of viewing

the moon through the giant telescope,
and various celestial bodies through
the smaller ones. While it will not be
possible to see the moon this week
end, the planet Saturn will be in posi
tion for examination.
The excursion will leave the Old
Union at 4 o'clock on Saturday and
will return to the campus about mid
night. Reservations and any informa
tion concerning the tour can be ob
tained by phoning to or calling at the
office of Director Sellards in the Ad
ministration Building.
