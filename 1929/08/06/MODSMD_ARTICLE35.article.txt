# ILLUSTRATED LECTURE ON CANADIAN BIRDS GIVEN BY STANSELL
## Pictures of Migratory Birds Of Canada Shown in Natural Colors

"We have no right whatever to de
stroy bird-life which, as a whole, is

one of nature's greatest benefits to
man. Only in a few specific instances
can birds detrimental to nature be
found," is the belief expressed by Sid
ney S. S. Stansell last Thursday in
his talk on birds. This lecture proved
so popular that another may be given
soon.
Stansell is especially noted for his
success in bird photography. He illus
trated his lecture with lantern slides
of birds he had photographed, some in
natural color. Most of these pictures
were taken in Alberta; however they
were of birds which can be found in
a few hours' drive anywhere in Cali
fornia. He is now preparing for slides,
50 pictures he has taken of bird-life
in the San Joaquin valley. Stansell's
pictures are used at the Smithsonian
Institute among the permanent dis
play of American birds.
In the lecture special reference was
given to various phases of bird-life,
adaptation to environment, body
markings and color, and manners of
migration. The Arctic Tern is given
as a remarkable example of a migra
tory bird. It rears its young in the
perpetual sunshine of the Ai'ctic sum
mer, and then migrates to the sun
shine of the Antarctic during the win
ter cycle.
During the past two years Stansell
has given over 400 bird lectures simi
lar to his last one. He has spoken in
all grades of schools, from the kinder
garten to the university. He was con
nected for 17 years with the U.S.
Biological Survey, and has also
worked in conjunction with the Cana
dian Biological Survey. Much of this
time was spent in Canada.
Stansell has taken the position of
instructor in Biology at Taft Union
High School. He is at present a stu
dent at Stanford for a master's degree
in zoology.
