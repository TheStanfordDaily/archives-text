# Drastic Action Promised Assembly Hall Smokers
## 
### 
Fire Chief Dugan, Gordon Davis,
and Harold Helvenston are up in
arms against those in the theatrical
workshop class and others who cannot
resist the temptation of a smoke even
in the Assembly Hall. Any member
of the workshop class seen smoking
in or around the hall will be auto
matically dropped from the class.
