# CENTRAL AMERICAN COCONUT THROWER AMUCK ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
"And what became of the
monk, the monk!"
Ernie Page is swinging from
tree to tree these days in search
of his pet monkey, "Big Boy."
"Big Boy" escaped Saturday
and is still at large today. He
was last seen on the roof of the
Alpha Phi house. Efforts of the
campus fire department to re
capture the Central American
were futile. The unhappy owner
announces that the conquest is
now open to all aspirants of
tropical recreation.
Page has three dollars for the
party who returns his erring pet
to the office of the Daily.
