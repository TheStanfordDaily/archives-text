# HUSKY HUNT, CARDINAL CAGE MENTOR, NAMED ON RULES COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Ernest "Husky" Hunt, varsity bas
ketball coach, will be the first Pacific

Coast representative to serve on the
A.A.U.'s joint basketball rules com
mittee. Hunt's appointment was veri
fied last night by Harry Maloney, di
rector of minor sports at Stanford
and third vice-president of the A.A.U.,
who was instrumental in bringing
Hunt's name before Avery Brundage,
president of the A.A.U.
The position on the committee has
been sought by nearly every promi
nent figure in Pacific Coast basket
ball circles. It carries the identical
importance in its field as does the
rules committee for football, of which
Coach "Pop" Warner is a member.

Hunt, as a member of the commit
tee, will include among his duties the
revision and interpretation of rules
for all college and club teams com
peting under the jurisdiction of the
A.A.U. and the N.C.A.A.
