# THE 						BULL SESSION
## ROOT OF ALL EVIL 
### 
Stanford, projected by her founders
as an institution of true learning, has
taken her place among those hundreds
of American universities in which the
students have adopted for their slo
gan, "Take the Grades and Let the
Knowledge Go."

The venerably youthful university
has toppled off the pedestal of educa
tional individuality on which she was
precariously balanced, and fallen into
the mediocre mass below.

For years Stanford has gathered
into her lecture rooms and labora
tories men and women from every
part of the civilized globe. They come
to Stanford, drawn by word of her
freedom, of the air of liberality that
pervades the Quad.

But do they find that freedom that
is the spirit of scholarship? More and
more they are confronted by some
thing quite different. A rigid system
for getting in, based even yet con
siderably on faith in a prep school
teacher's judgment. An even more un
yielding system for staying in, based
on finals, mid-quarters, term papers,
apple-polishing. An equally inflexible
system for getting out —with a di
ploma—based on required subjects,
units, honor points, and a clean rec
ord with the Men's Council.

The place isn't the one they heard
about. It is a place of "grades." The
curious ones, determined to know
exactly how close they came to flunk
ing, and the grinds, just as determined
to have everyone else know how well
they passed their quizzes, have seen
to that. They are the ones responsible
for the A, B, C business.

And what are the results of this
new policy? First, it aids graduate
schools with a limited enrollment to
select the most promising undergradu
ates as indicated by grades. Second,
it gives a student transferring from
Stanford a definite place in any uni
versity to which he may go. Third,
it makes for Phi Beta Kappa, and all
other scholastic societies. Fourth, and
from then on, it provides for frater
nity ratings, news for the folks back
home, the bawl-out, and monthly
sweatsessions.
When all these entirely logical ad
vantages have been reeled off, there
might be a few other results worth
some consideration. For example, one
might name the popularity of so-called
"pipe courses," blessed refuge of men
seeking an A.B. and little else —men
seeking grade points. Then there's the
honor code, set up last quarter in
hope of bracing the fast-falling honor
system—the honor system that could
not overcome the temptations of get
ting a B instead of a C.

The professors don't like the grade
system —they realize its persistent
unfairness and its disagreeable odor
of apple-polishing. The students cer
tainly don't like it —they, seniors and
juniors, at least, have gone through
the ceiling at the ghastly deadline
between C-minuses and D-pluses. They
know the strain of finals —and the
feeling of total ignorance the day
after the ex.

So far as we know, nobody likes
he grading system. To Gehenna with
t, we say! —Milton Silverman.
