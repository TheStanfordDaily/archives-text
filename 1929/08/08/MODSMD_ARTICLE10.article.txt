## Supervision of Marriages for Ultimate Racial Improvement; Ideal Child to Have Best Characteristics of Football Player, Movie Star, Royal Scion 
### 
A eugenical aristocracy may yet rule the world.
Dr. Ferdinand C. S. Schiller, English humanist, believes that government
might well be in the hands of clans, whose marriages would be absolutely
controlled so that a highly superior type of man might be developed. He
presented his ideas Tuesday night at the Little Theatre before an audience
that filled every available seat.
The present form of government, Dr. Schiller contends, is a weak substitute
for what it ought to be. "Democracy," he says, "is a means, not an end. The

only real argument for political equa

lity is that men are born so unequal
•that the only practical means of gov
ernment is to pretend that they are
equal. A eugenical aristocracy in the
political world would be a real ad
vance."
Mates Chosen
Control of the "matrimonial vaga
ries" of the ruling clan would be nei
ther new nor difficult. "Royalty has
always been forced to marry for po
litical convenience. In a future eugeni
cal society the clan, or family, would
interfere only when the matrimonial
choice was bad, and family pride
would tend naturally to lead men to
attempt marriage into eugenically
superior groups."
Dr. Schiller believes that any im
mediate attempts to reach such a
eugenical ideal must start from the
actual. Man must follow nature, pro
ceeding by the processes of trial and
error.
He does not, however, advocate any
startling revolutionary measures. He
suggests as a feasible plan the "Eu
genical Baby Show." The judges
would be a representative committee
of doctors, artists, philosophers, bio
logists, etc. Funds would be collected
and shows started all over the coun
try. Parents of babies entered would
have to state their pedigrees. The
babies would be examined and prizes
awarded for both personal condition
and the length and purity of their
pedigrees.
Prize Babies
The eugenical first prize winners!
They would have floods of publicity
throughout life. There would be eu
genical scholarships. Combined in the
eugenical prize-winners would be the
attractions of the football player, the
scion of royalty, and the moving pic
ture star. Distinguished, and with a
ready-made national reputation, suc
cess would be assured. No right
minded girl would dare refuse their
offers of marriage. The thoughts of
all would be turned toward eugenical
superiority.
"Eventually," says Dr. Schiller, "the
enlightened public opinion would in
sist that the state take over the bio
logical evolution of man. And the re
sult would be that the man of the
future would be as superior to his
modern prototype as the man of today
is to the gorilla or chimpanzee."

The present form of government, Dr. Schiller contends, is a weak substitute
for what it ought to be. "Democracy," he says, "is a means, not an end. The

only real argument for political equa

lity is that men are born so unequal
•that the only practical means of gov
ernment is to pretend that they are
equal. A eugenical aristocracy in the
political world would be a real ad
vance."

Control of the "matrimonial vaga
ries" of the ruling clan would be nei
ther new nor difficult. "Royalty has
always been forced to marry for po
litical convenience. In a future eugeni
cal society the clan, or family, would
interfere only when the matrimonial
choice was bad, and family pride
would tend naturally to lead men to
attempt marriage into eugenically
superior groups."
Dr. Schiller believes that any im
mediate attempts to reach such a
eugenical ideal must start from the
actual. Man must follow nature, pro
ceeding by the processes of trial and
error.
He does not, however, advocate any
startling revolutionary measures. He
suggests as a feasible plan the "Eu
genical Baby Show." The judges
would be a representative committee
of doctors, artists, philosophers, bio
logists, etc. Funds would be collected
and shows started all over the coun
try. Parents of babies entered would
have to state their pedigrees. The
babies would be examined and prizes
awarded for both personal condition
and the length and purity of their
pedigrees.
Prize Babies
The eugenical first prize winners!
They would have floods of publicity
throughout life. There would be eu
genical scholarships. Combined in the
eugenical prize-winners would be the
attractions of the football player, the
scion of royalty, and the moving pic
ture star. Distinguished, and with a
ready-made national reputation, suc
cess would be assured. No right
minded girl would dare refuse their
offers of marriage. The thoughts of
all would be turned toward eugenical
superiority.
"Eventually," says Dr. Schiller, "the
enlightened public opinion would in
sist that the state take over the bio
logical evolution of man. And the re
sult would be that the man of the
future would be as superior to his
modern prototype as the man of today
is to the gorilla or chimpanzee."
A eugenical aristocracy may yet rule the world.
Dr. Ferdinand C. S. Schiller, English humanist, believes that government
might well be in the hands of clans, whose marriages would be absolutely
controlled so that a highly superior type of man might be developed. He
presented his ideas Tuesday night at the Little Theatre before an audience
that filled every available seat.
