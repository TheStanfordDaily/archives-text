critics to be a man whose playing is
an outgrowth of his own personal
qualities. His technic is considered

"Do we instinctively deduct ten per
cent from the virtue of American
musicians because they do not wear
their hair long and have not foreign
names? Be the answer what it may,
I will swear that if Henri Deering
had come to town under the name of
Busoni or Rosenthal, the people who
heard him play would have found no
one could have played with a more
inspired romanticism."
Those who heard Deering in his
recent appearance in the Woodland
Theatre at Hillsborough noted his
ability to interpret the modern con
tributions to the musical world with
as much intellectual understanding
and strength of feeling as he put into
his interpretation of the more classi
cal numbers.
Program of Contrasts
Debussy's Clair de lune and the
Danse du feu of the modern Spanish
composer, de Falla, will serve as a
contrast to the more classical Bach
and Chopin numbers in Deering's re
cital tonight. Bach's French Suite,
No. 5 in G major, is one ot the most
interesting compositions of this par
ticular form of musical composition
of which Bach is perhaps the greatest
master.
With the Persinger Quartet of San

will be open to the public without
