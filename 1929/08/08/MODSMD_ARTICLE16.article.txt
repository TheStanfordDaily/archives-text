# Naked to the Waist!
## 
### 
The Mauve Decade is with us again. Just when we had thought that
a sensible attitude was becoming widespread concerning the human body
we were disillusioned.
No Stanford man will be permitted to go shirtless on the campus..
It's naughty. Visitors might be shocked.
Now if Stanford is to be a showcase for tourists we must, of course,
dress as Mrs. Grundy and Anthony Comstock would have us dress. But
it all seems so ridiculous.
The story of the decree, apparently, is this:
Comptroller Roth learned, or saw —in fact, it seems to have been
brought to his attention, that student laborers were working minus
shirts. They were stripped to the waist! Mr. Roth, whatever his personal
convictions may be, acted.
Orders went out. No student can work (or play) on the campus
without proper covering above the waist. Arms may be bared—even
gym shirts may be worn. But nobody may play tennis in shorts, or a
bathing suit—and nobody may get a broad tan, unless by very judicious
sun-bathing, screened. Even then the risk of being seen by female
aviators is tremendous.
So the B.A.C. was forced to clothe its workers. All the campus
police agents were told to enforce the rule.
Shirts, or ... . !
All this is very silly. These students were merely working, in the
most comfortable way—in the most healthy way. They looked good.
The present laundry sack, or dirty, torn working shirt is certainly less
admirable.
It's so ridiculous.
The thing that was once a staunch "moral issue" is increasingly a joke.
This is 1929. Next year will be 1930. One of these days this piffling
rule will have been forgotten.
The Stanford Daily respectfully suggests that the persons most
shocked at the Shirtless Horror revise their ideas a bit.
