# Chain Mail for the Well-Dressed Hunter
## 
### 
Talk about Kentucky feuds. At least the Shot At knew somebody
was sore at him. But many a deer hunter, at peace with the world, is
now at peace with the world permanently. Some fool has shot him down
from ambush, lie looked like a deer, even if he did have a shirt as
blazing red as old-fashioned underwear.
As long as these licensed Nimrods only succeed in picking off a few
cows the loss, though unwarranted, is most serious to the justly irate
farmer. But when beginner's marksmanship includes a few pot shots at
fellow hunters, with fatalities resulting, the affair is past the province of
the humorous feature story on the green hunter.
Every year (increasingly less so, it is true) we can count on a certain
number of Fourth of July injuries and deaths.
The day after hunting season opens a tragically similar list of accidents
appears in the press. It reminds one of Monday's paper after reckless
Sunday driving has taken its toll.
The new driver's test may help the auto problem. Will anything help
the shooting situation? Should hunters be given tests like drivers? They
are dealing with more surely dangerous weapons.
The problem presents itself for action. Probably a certain number
of incompetents will mar the record in every field of activity. But
progress consists in cutting down the number.
Red shirts are not enough. Apparently ,the amateur hunter considers
it open season on all moving objects, be they red, green, purple, or polka
dotted. And incidentally, it is suggested that some of these sharpshooters
may have seen a few pink-striped Monsters of the Mind before making
short work of another hunter.
It's getting so no one wants to suggest just another law. But until a
few folks can tell a deer from a jackrabbit—or a man—a strict regulation
of hunting licenses seems advisabl®.
For chain mail is mighty cumbersome even if it is what the well
dresesd hunter should wear.
