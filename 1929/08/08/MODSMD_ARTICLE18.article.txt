# The 						Last Hillsborough Concert
## 
### 
Sunday will be your last chance to hear the justly popular summer
season concerts at the Woodland Theater, Hillsborough. These worth
while musical events have drawn large peninsula audiencesâ€”pleased au
diences.
You will do well to attend.
And, continuing Stanford's excellent musical summer, Henri Decring
will play tonight in the Assembly Hall. Decring, a real American pianist,
will offer a program more extended than in his Hillsborough appearance.
You will make no mistake here, either. And, incidentally, there's no
admission charge. The best things in life are free, says a popular song.
Editorial and business staff of the Stanford Daily will meet at
il:15 Monday afternoon in the editorial office.
