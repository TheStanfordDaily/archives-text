## "Door Between" Pleases Reviewer; Tucker Stars 
### 
Death hovering over a modest little
home. A doctor, a nurse, a devoted
young wife all praying and fighting
for the life of a man —then victory
for the grim reaper.
Strange opening for a comedy, but
that's the prologue for "The Door
Between," the Vincent Lawrence com
edy which opened at the Geary Thea
tre this week.

Though the bright lights proclaim
Edna HTbbard as the star, Richard
Tucker seems to carry the honors in
this play, cleverly portraying the part
of Dr. Dillard. Miss Hibbard is Ethel
Brooks, the young widow who three
years after her husband's death mar
ries the doctor —but "in name only"—

and for half a year they live with "a
door between."

Kenneth Thompson as Richard
Hunt, the good-looking, none-too-am
bitious friend of the doctor, does his
share of the acting, and does it well.
Both Thompson and Tucker are famil
iar to the speaking screen.

The play is a light bit of comedy
which involves but three leading
characters. All the action takes place
in a room in Dr. Dillard's home. The
doctor falls in love with the pert and
rather saucy little widow, who can't

seem to forget her deceased husband.
But because of financial stress she
consents to become Mrs. Dillard, and
allows the doctor to become her "big
brother" husband.
"The Door Between"
All's well until she thinks she has
fallen in love with Richard, the doc
tor's best friend, and Richard is sure
that he has fallen in love with her.
All's not well when the doctor re
turns to find his wife in Dick's arms,
and right here the play began to take
on the atmosphere of an ominous,
tense drama, as one might expect.

Then, as one would not expect, the
medic decides that Dick has done him
the favor of a lifetime by making
Ethel forget husband Number One.
So Dillard declares they will be just
"two fellows and a girl"—and may the
best man win. One proves himself the
better lover and the comedy ends with
everybody happy—including the audi
ence.

All in all, it is a play decidedly
worthwhile, not brimming with spark
ling wit, but filled with a number of
amusing situations. It is restfully
light—the kind of a play which lets
you settle back into your seat for an
evening of effortless entertainment.

edy which opened at the Geary Thea
tre this week.

Though the bright lights proclaim
Edna HTbbard as the star, Richard
Tucker seems to carry the honors in
this play, cleverly portraying the part
of Dr. Dillard. Miss Hibbard is Ethel
Brooks, the young widow who three
years after her husband's death mar
ries the doctor —but "in name only"—

and for half a year they live with "a
door between."

Kenneth Thompson as Richard
Hunt, the good-looking, none-too-am
bitious friend of the doctor, does his
share of the acting, and does it well.
Both Thompson and Tucker are famil
iar to the speaking screen.

The play is a light bit of comedy
which involves but three leading
characters. All the action takes place
in a room in Dr. Dillard's home. The
doctor falls in love with the pert and
rather saucy little widow, who can't

seem to forget her deceased husband.
But because of financial stress she
consents to become Mrs. Dillard, and
allows the doctor to become her "big
brother" husband.
"The Door Between"
All's well until she thinks she has
fallen in love with Richard, the doc
tor's best friend, and Richard is sure
that he has fallen in love with her.
All's not well when the doctor re
turns to find his wife in Dick's arms,
and right here the play began to take
on the atmosphere of an ominous,
tense drama, as one might expect.

Then, as one would not expect, the
medic decides that Dick has done him
the favor of a lifetime by making
Ethel forget husband Number One.
So Dillard declares they will be just
"two fellows and a girl"—and may the
best man win. One proves himself the
better lover and the comedy ends with
everybody happy—including the audi
ence.

All in all, it is a play decidedly
worthwhile, not brimming with spark
ling wit, but filled with a number of
amusing situations. It is restfully
light—the kind of a play which lets
you settle back into your seat for an
evening of effortless entertainment.

Death hovering over a modest little
home. A doctor, a nurse, a devoted
young wife all praying and fighting
for the life of a man —then victory
for the grim reaper.
Strange opening for a comedy, but
that's the prologue for "The Door
Between," the Vincent Lawrence com
edy which opened at the Geary Thea
tre this week.
