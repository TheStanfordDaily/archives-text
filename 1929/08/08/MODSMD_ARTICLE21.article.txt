# ELECTRICIAN'S WORK IN RYAN 'LAB' DONE IN MILLION VOLT CAGE
## 
### 
Suspended from the roof of the
Ryan Laboratory in a screen cage
through which nearly one million volts
are directed is a mere incident for
Professor J. S. Carroll in his research
to determine the atmosphere leakage
of an electric current. The cage, 20
feet above the floor, is protected by
4 strings of insulators each 16 feet
long.
Although the discharges of elec
tricity shoot five or six feet from the
cage, Professor Carroll experiences
no unusual sensation from the tre
mendous force of the electrical energy.
If the cage were lowered five feet,
the force of the current would be
sufficient to jump from the cage to
the ground. However, such a man
made bolt of lightning would not harm
any object within the screen house.
In fact, to determine the safety of
the sensitive instruments employed
in the tests, Professor Carroll pur
posely caused a bolt to occur while
he sat in the cage.
