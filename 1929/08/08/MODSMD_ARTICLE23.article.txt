# VISITING CONDUCTOR WILL DIRECT FINAL CONCERT OF SERIES
## Bruno Walter to Include Numbers Requested By Audiences 
### 
Bruno Walter, who has enjoyed
great popularity in his last two pro
grams in the Woodland Theatre at
Hillsborough, will conduct the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra next
Sunday afternoon in the final concert
of the fourth season of open air con
certs presented by the Philharmonic
Society of San Mateo County.

The wide diversity of the numbers
included in Walter's first two pro
grams has eloquently demonstrated
the basis for his reputation in inter
preting with equal facility the works
of the old masters and the contribu
tions of modern composers to musical
literature.

The eminent European conductor is
in constant demand in all of the music
capitals of the continent to give spe
cial programs, particularly those
made up of the works of Mozart, Schu
bert, and Wagner.

Because of the popular demand for
the familiar numbers from the stand
ard repertoire, the final concert will
include such compositions as Wag
ner's Overture to "Flying Dutchman"
and Schubert's Overture to
munde."
The complete program follows:
Overture to "Flying Dutchman"
Wagner
Symphony, E flat major Mozart
Overture to "Rosamunde" Schubert
Prelude and Love Death from
"Tristan and Isolde" Wagner
"Francesca da Rimini"..Tschaikowsky
The Symphony in E flat major, only
occasionally heard, will be the prin
cipal offering of the last program,
