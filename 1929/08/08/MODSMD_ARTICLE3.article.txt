# HANDWRITING EXPERT LECTURES ON VARIOUS METHODS OF FORGERY
## 
### 
Methods employed in frustrating
the activities of forgers were ex
plained last night by A. R. Lewis,
handwriting expert of New York, to
members of the Law Association. The
talk was sponsored by Delta Theta
Phi, professional law fraternity.

Lewis has spent thirty years study
ing forged instruments and docu
ments, and is one of the four leading
experts in the United States.

He gave a number of instances in
which forged checks, raised figures,
and other fraudulent methods of this
sort have been detected by the ex
perts. Chemical tests on the inks
used, magnification, photographs, and
x-rays are employed.
Lewis had with him actual speci
mens of forgeries, among which was
a forgery of the signature of Charles
M. Schwab to a $1,000,000 note.
"Cai'elessness on the part of bank
patrons is responsible for the millions
of dollars that banks lose every year
through fraudulent paper," said Lewis.
He blamed people who leave careful
signatures at their banks, and then
scrawl their signatures to their
checks.
