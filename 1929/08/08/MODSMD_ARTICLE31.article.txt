Richard Wagner took for the sub
ject of this prelude from Lohengrin,
the descent of the Holy Grail, the
theme of which is the motif of the
work. Karg-Elert is one of the most
extreme of modern German organ
composers in his harmonic progres
sions. The piece is one of a set of
tone pictures of Lake Constance.

Seven farmers were killed in Poland
when they attempted to remove the
copper parts from a shell found on
an old battlefield near Lemberg.
