# PSYCHOLOGY STUDENTS CHECK CORRELATIONS OF SPECIAL TALENTS
## 
### 
Are people who are highly de
veloped In a very specific sence as
efficient in problems of a general na
ture?
This is the main point in the re
search that Professor Robert Holmes
Seashore's class in laboratory psych
ology is conducting. Interesting de
velopments that will be important in
the world of psychology may be ex
pected from this class in the near
future.
Instead of taking cut and dried
problems from a book, each member
of the class has been given a certain
problem which he works out with
other members of the class and with
members of the elementary class. The
class, as subjects, receives practically
no outside aid, thus any member of
the class uncovering anything of im
portance will get due credit.
One student is trying to find out
if people particularly susceptible to
geometrical illusions are proportion
ally susceptible to illusions of other
types.
Another is comparing the speed of
reading with the speed of other mus
cular activities.
A group of students is trying to
find out if people who can remember
simple melodies and rhythmic pat
terns of first trial are able to learn
more complicated patterns in fewer
trials than an ordinary person. Thus
this phase develops into a compari
son of memory span with efficiency
in learning.
Three or four other students are
comparing individual differences be
tween simple and complex muscular
skills. The research question is "Do
individual differences in a highly
specific sense work out proportionate
ly on a fairly general scale?"
