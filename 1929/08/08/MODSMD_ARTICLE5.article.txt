# 'SUN-TAN' WORKERS RUN AFOUL OF LAW; ROUGHS DON SHIRTS
## 
### 
The story of a shirt.
Beware! seekers of tan. Comp
troller A. E. Roth yesterday de
clared war on shirtless youth.
The siren of Officer Olson is
being used to warn students and
workers that the Stanford cam
pus is no place to get violet rays.
Workers on the golf course
were told to wear shirts while on
the job.
Swimming suits are not con
sidered the proper attire for ten
nis players. This is not a new
rule, but an enforcement. Stu
dents are not permitted on the
gym floor without a gym shirt
and trousers. And the same regu
lation applies to the tennis courts
and campus.
