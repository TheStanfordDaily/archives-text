# Krenz Out To Break 20-Year-old Record With 18-Pound Shot
## Kazanjian to Enter Special Weight Event; Many Cards Compete 
### 
Eric Krenz will attempt to break
the 18-pound shot record, which has
stood since 1909, in the contests held
by the South of Market Street Boys'
Association Sunday at Fairfax, Marin
county.
This event, along with the 35-pound
weight which has not been thrown in
outdoor contests for nearly 20 years,
was added by Charlie Hunter, Olym
pic Club coach, to afford Krenz and
"Casey" Kazanjian opportunities to
set new records.
Les Hables is matched against
Blanchard of the Los Angeles Athletic
Club and Storie of the Olympics in
the 440. The 75-yard dash includes
Wykoff, Bracey, Sweet, and Hables.
Eric Krenz, hitherto known as a
champion weight man, may enter the
75-yard dash, and the relay with
Hables, Storie, and Sweet, if Wykoff
does not come from the South. Krenz
was a sprinter in Stockton High
School five years ago.
Athletes entering are either unat
tached or competing for clubs which
they represent.

Stanford entrants are: Eric Krenz,
18-pound shot, 35-pound weight, and
75-yard dash; Casey Kazanjian, 18-
pound shot and 35-pound weight;
Spud Harder, 35-pound weight; Leo
Kibby, 18-pound shot and 35-pound
weight; Tex Crandall, 880 and high
jump; Doug Aiken, 880, 2-mile, and
high jump; Ray Ede, 2-mile; A1
Storms, 880 and 2-mile; Leon Carley,
880 and 2-mile; and Les Halbes, 75
and 440.
The pole vault and 4-man relay are
the only events of the nine offered
in which Stanford men have not en
tered.
Extra seats have been placed
around the grandstand to accommo
date the cowds which are expected.
