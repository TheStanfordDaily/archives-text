# GESTALT THEORY SUBJECT OF TALK BY PSYCHOLOGIST
## 
### 
The place of behaviorism in the
Gestalt theory of psychology, and the
nature of the psychological field, was
the subject of a lecture by Dr. Kurt
Koffka yesterday afternoon.
Dr. Koffka was formerly at the Uni
versity of Giesen, Germany, and has
been doing extensive research at
Smith College. He is a visiting pro
fessor at the University of California.
He likened the field of psychologi
cal research to that of physics, be
cause in both sciences the behavior
of objects is studied to discover the
properties of some general field.
The basic assumption of the Gestalt
theory is, however, that the charac
teristic properties of the field of direct
experience are also those of the so
matic field â€”the physical field of the
body. The two go hand in hand.
The Gestalt group of psychologists
emphasizes the occurrence of patterns
of perception and experience in men
tal life. This study has been intro
duced by Dr. Koffka in his book,
"Growth of the Mind," published in
1924.
