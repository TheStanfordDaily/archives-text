# URGE FOR LEARNING SENDS ERRING MONK TO DOCUMENT ROOM
## 
### 
The Alpha Kappa Lambda's
lead the Stanford fraternities in
scholarship, and Ernie Page is
an A.K.L. Which may explain
why Page's pet monkey, at large
three days, was found yesterday
in the library's document room.
Reports that his lost coconut
tosser had entered a window and
was romping in the musty arch
ives brought Page to the scene,
post-haste. The capture was
made, and the erring monk carted
home in a wastepaper basket.
But Stanford fraternity walls
do not a prison make, and "Big
Boy" fought his way to liberty
through a defective panel in less
than an hour.
So the three-dollar reward for
his return still holds.
