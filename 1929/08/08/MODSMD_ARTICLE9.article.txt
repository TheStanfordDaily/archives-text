# Settings For 'Makropoulos Secret' Stress Longevity As Drama Feature
## Capek Problem Play to Have Impressive Scenic Effects Designed by Helvenston and Created by the Theatrical Workshop Students 
### 
Settings are to have more than the
usual importance in the Stanford Dra
matic production, "The Makropoulos
Secret," which will be given in the
Assembly Hall August 16.
The three sets used are the products
of Harold Helvenston's class in Thea
trical Workshop, and have been de
signed to further maintain the idea of
longevity, which is the salient feature
of Karel Capek's play.
Spaciousness and somber coloring
will predominate in the first scene,
which is the office of Dr. Kolanaty and
where the characters will be intro
duced and a hint given of the dignity
of the plot and the note of tragedy
which is an undercurrent throughout
the play.
One spot of color and light on an
otherwise dark backstage of a Vienna
opera house makes a striking and
I

impressionistic background for the
movement of the second act, superim
posing the brilliance of Marty's life
upon the cool dignity of the other
characters.
Exotic, rococo, colorful, and yet
with the hint of somber dignity, makes
the tragedy that lurks in Marty's
bedroom form a distinctive yet not
too heavy background for the climax
of the production. This set for the
last act is a clear portrayal of the life
of the three-hundred-year-old heroine.
This play, like the others of Capek,
deals with the working out of some
problem. What would you do had you
the secret of long life? What would
life mean to one who has the secret
of longevity? These questions are
raised by Capek, and the play is an
attempt to give at least some idea of
what long life might mean to some.
Seat sale will be Tuesday.
