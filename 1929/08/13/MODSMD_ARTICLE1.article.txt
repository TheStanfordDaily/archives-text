## STANFORD FOR YOU 
### 
When you look over the Time
Schedule in October, seeking an Oasis
in the desert of "Statistical Methods,"
"History 10," "Economics 1," and
"General Biology," how would you
like a course in Stanford —just Stan
ford?
Surely this would be a welcome

Stanford History—with an eye to
fundamental Stanford traditions, re
sulting in the Stanford of today, with
the Stanford of tomorrow ahead —
there's a brief syllabus for a course
that you'll take without being asked.
Well, why not?
Surely every Stanford student
should, before he is graduated, know
his own University—know something
of its foundation, ideals, its lore, its
growth and expansion, and its plan
for days to come.
Stanford is fortunate in having a
small student body. But how many of
the 3000 know their own college? Or
of the far greater number who have
degrees?
It is important that tales be told.
Let's trace Stanford through the
pioneer days, past the Spanish war,
over the turn of the century, triumph
ing over the earthquake of 1906 —
ever building.
And let's not, in the new course in
Stanford History—forget the lore.

Shall not the present generation of
Stanford know of the student-faculty
clash that made the years around '08
tempestuous? Or of the contrasting
years when the students and the fac
ulty couldn't be told apart?

Watching the Daily Palo Alto
through the years, recording the
events of Stanford and continuing to
expand as the Stanford Daily—reading
the old Quads —recalling the founding
of Chaparral and the Old Boy's mel
lowed wit —all are, and will be, part
of "Stanford History."
And it's all quite possible, even for
the autumn quarter. That's why we're
talking about it now.
"Stanford History" could start as a
seminar—even as a form of organ
ized bull session. But we predict it
would, before long, carry University
•credit. For student interest in the
course would make it a valuable ad
dition to the list.

Stanford, when it first started, was
a distinct experiment in education. So
would the course be. The Stanford of
40 years ago is not the Stanford of
today. It is the study of the expan
sion of this experiment that would
make "Stanford History" a valuable
study in education.
The University has kept pace with
the times. The study of an institution
with its roots hardly in the last
century would be a novel course. It
would be new. And it would be worth
while educationally.
Let's put "Stanford History" in the
Announcement of Courses, with an in
teresting, virile, well-informed lec
turer at the head, and start in classes
at the Basketball Pavilion.
For assuredly, the course would be
popular.
