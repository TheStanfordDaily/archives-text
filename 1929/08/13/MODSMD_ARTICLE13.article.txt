# DEERING PLEASES CAMPUS AUDIENCE IN FIRST RECITAL
## Varied Program of Classical and Modern Numbers Heard By Appreciative Audience in Assembly Hall; Pianist Gives Three Encores 
### 
Appearing on the campus for the first time, Henri Deering, noted American
pianist, was received with much enthusiasm by Stanford music lovers last
Thursday night in the Assembly Hall.
Bach's French Suite, No. 5 in G major, portraying vividly the national
temperaments of many countries, served as a classical opening to Deering's
extremely varied program. The five Chopin numbers met with such approval
that an encore was demanded by the audience. Deering selected Chopin's
Fantasie Impromptu as his additional number.
To vary the program Visions fugitives by Prokofieff, Russian emulator of
Mozart, followed the two more classical groups. Deering's articulate touch

and clearly cut technic drew out the
indefinite and ghostly quality of Pro
kofieff's composition.
Deering's interpretation of De
bussy's Reflets dans l'eau, Clair de
lune, and La fllle aux cheveux de lin,
revealed his feeling for tho poetry
of what he plays.
The two compositions of Ravel, For
lane and Rigaudon, furnished a strik
ing relief from the more quiet num
bers.
Tango, by Albeniz, a more popular
number than the others, showed Deer
ing's remarkable ability to interpret
this particular form of music.
Danse du feu, one of the most in
teresting works of the modern Span
ish composer deFalla, was a brilliant
conclusion to Deering's recital. Two
encores were called for at the end
of the program.
