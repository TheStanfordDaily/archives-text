### 
Uncanny, fantastic, and mysterious,
"The Makropoulos Secret" offers
drama of a decided contrast to the
first two Summer Quarter produc
tions. Taking the problem of life plus
the secret of longevity, Karel Capek
has evolved a philosophic, but faint
ly serious and melodramatic interpre
tation of his ideas of life with this
secret.
Seat sale will be held today at 1
o'clock in front of the Women's Club
house and at Roble Hall. After today
tickets may be purchased at the
A.S.S.U. offices in the Old Union and
at Keeble's in Palo Alto. Roughs'
tickets will go on sale Friday night.
Roles Varied
"Makropoulos Secret" is the last
play of the season and offers oppor
tunity for new campus material. There
are several especially interesting and
different parts for the female cast.
Irene Mansfeldt as Kristina will have
the difficult role of a serious-minded
girl of sixteen who concentrates much
on her career as a singer, and her ad
miration for the Marty who has al
ready arrived in her chosen profes
sion, Virginia Volland, well-known
to Stanford audiences, will play the
part of Marty â€”the truly famous, and
the equally cold, distant, and unap
proachable heroine.
Tom Henry has been cast as the
haughty, dignified, and entirely self
contained Baron Prus. John Yeon has
the difficult role of Janek Prus, un
sophisticated, emotional, and very
especially in love with Kristina. Hauk-
Sendorf, Charles Wade, a very old
man in his dotage but still very emo
tional when he finds the woman of his
old love life, forms a very interest
ing contrast to the love-lorn and rath
er downcast Janek.
Cast Changed
Because a change in the cast was
necessary, Burnell Gould is playing
the part of Vitek. Others in the cast
are: Boyd Homewood as Dr. Kolanaty;
Neville Woodruff, as the mechanic;
John Hiestand, as Gregor; Blanche
Reed, scrubwoman; Helen Wall,
Marty's maid; and Edward Field as
the doctor in charge of Hauk-Sendorf.
