# The 						Experiment Nears Its End

i — ; ; ;
The fatal hour has arrived. What fate it shall bring is yet in the
darkness..
Burnell Gould, following the so-called laboratory procedure in the
Journalism department, has completed his experiment, but his notes are
still being written up under the title of Bull Session.
The loss of Earl Harris, who unfortunately for us has had to leave
the campus after his short stay of six weeks, has left the chair of anothei
Associate Editor vacant. Ellis Gait and Francis Wyatt have found their
seats as successors.
At any rate the experiments are nearing their end. Ihe successors are
merely finishing work begun by their predecessors.
