# The 						Mechanical Teacher Appears

Education is about to take a long step forward.
At a program last night, given to members of the faculty as a preview
of the regularly scheduled presentation for today, the Western Elcctric
Company showed its latest development—the education talkie.
Admittedly an experiment, this innovation seems destined to change
in no small measure the educational methods in vogue today. College
professors will have their delicate methods of research saved for count
less observers. Small country grammar and high schools will have skilled
methods of instruction brought to their very doorsteps. Isolated districts
will find themselves next door to great educational institutions.
Visual education will find its most fertile home in the lines of
scientific work. Chemistry, physics, geology, biology, medicine, geo
graphy, bacteriology are studies in which this new method of instruction
will be of the greatest aid. The social sciences—history, political science,
economics, world commerce —likewise will be benefited.
The talkies can be well adapted to the arts. On the celluloid strips
may be recorded a symphony concert, a great dramatic performance, a
visit to the galleries of the Louvre. Architecture, engineering, sanitation
—there is hardly a subject that cannot be taught more easily by means
of this mechanical professor.

Five times today this exhibition will be held in the Little Theatre.
Visitors will not find a finished product, ready for use in the North
Carolina school systems, nor will they see something radically new in
moving pictures. The actual image on the screen is perfectly familiar
to every theatergoer of today. What is new is its adaptation—the sug
gestion of its potentialities in an advancing profession.
