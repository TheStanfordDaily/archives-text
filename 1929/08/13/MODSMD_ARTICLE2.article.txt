# CONSUL WILL TELL OF TRIP DURING WORLD WAR TONIGHT
## Completion of Diplomatic Mission To Be Told By Von Hentig CHINESE TRIP DANGEROUS Speaker Believes American Prestige Greater Than European Nations 
### 
Dangerous, almost impossible at
times, but he did it. A. journey from
Chinese Turkestan to the Pacific coast
during the World through a
country whose people were primitive,
and whose sympathies might well lie
with the enemy.

The experiences of this journey will
be the subject of an illustrated talk
given by Dr. W. O. Von Hentig, Ger
man consul at San Francisco. He
speaks tonight at 8 o'clock in the
Little Theatre.
Dr. Von Hentig was sent by the
German government to establish
diplomatic relations with the Emir of
Afghanistan. At the outset of the
World War Germany had hoped to ally
herself with all ol' the Islamites. Dr.
Von Hentig reached Afghanistan in
1915.
He remained there over a year, and
having finally accomplished his pur
pose he wanted to go home. However,
the war was still in progress, and he
decided to go to China and remain
in Kashgar until it was over. Com
munications were poor, and finally,
against his will, he was forced to join
the staff of the German legation at
Pekln.
In order to reach Pekin he had to
travel all the way from Chinese
Turkestan to the Pacific coast.
Tonight's talk has largely to do
with this journey. Dr. Von Hentig
will explain the state of mind of the
primitive Chinese people toward the
war. The Chinese were somewhat fa
vorable to Germany at this time, says
Dr. Von Hentig, since they were an
tagonistic to Russia and Japan.
Since the war, Dr. Von Hentig says,
the European nations have lost much
of their prestige in China, and it is
toward the United States that the
Chinese are now looking.
Dr. Von Hentig spoke at Stanford
last fall, and told of his journey
through Persia, and his stay at Af
ghanistan. Tonight lie will tell the
other half of the story, "Through Cen
tral Asia to the Pacific Coast."
The lecture is open to the public.
