# Slammed In Your Face
## 
### 
Last night the Cellar closed its doors with a grand slam.
This somewhat violent shutting down might be justifiableâ€”if any
decent sort of notice had been given. But it wasn't. Ihe move was
abrupt, to say the least.
The Cellar had been running out of food all day. Rut that was not
regarded as anything unusual. The people who were shooed away at
10:15 last night, and the students who sought their snail and coffee this
morning, were somewhat surprised.
No notice had been given.
Now everybody knows the Cellar is being remodelled. We suppose
it will be greatly improved, when it finally opens in October. But it's
still a few days till October.
Repairs are repairs, but that closing was high-handed.
Jt was even discourteous.
And, for 18 days, it will mean a distinct inconvenience to Stanford
students.
