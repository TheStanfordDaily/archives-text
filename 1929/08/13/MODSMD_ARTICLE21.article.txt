After all, it's a good thing to think your college is the greatest
anywhere.
In another column, the former chief editorial writer of the Daily
lUini makes a few observations on the student who thinks his college is

There will be a meeting of the Daily Staff in the office at 1 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon. All members of the editorial board, reporters' staff,
and business office are requested to attend.
