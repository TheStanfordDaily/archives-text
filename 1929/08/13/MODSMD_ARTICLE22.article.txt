YOUNG GIRL AT SEA
"Salt Water Taffy," by Corey Ford.
G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York.
Joan Lowell got what she asked for.
"Salt Water Taffy" or "Twenty Thou
sand Leagues Away from the Sea" Is
a very clever take-off on "Cradle of
the Deep." It is perhaps as humorous
a book as any published this year, that
is if you have read Joan Lowell. Never
theless the stirring adventures of
June Triplett will give many laughs
to anyone but Miss Lowell.
Ezra Triplett's daughter truly set a
new high-water mark for modern mari
time autobiography.
June gets on her first boat when
she is three months old with her
duffle in a foot-square piece of white
linen and finds herself rather weak;
in fact, as she explains it, "weak as
a baby." It does not take long, how
ever, for her to learn to spit "Old
Coffin" chewing tobacco with the best
of them, arid is soon spitting figure
eights in the wind.
She was seven years old when she
cut open a female shark and found a
copy of "What Every Girl Should
Know" inside.
At an early age she learned to throw
the bulwarks, and play strip-poker
with the crew who learned their vo
cabulary from her.
Single-handed she captured a baby
water-spout named Gladys and kept
it for a pet. A high-light of the story
is the drinking bout between Gladys
and June which ended in a whirling
contest and Papa Triplett getting his
knee wet, which was very embarras
sing.
She was the first white woman to
witness the Dance of the Virgins, in
company with Old Sedlitz, a beach
combing salt who hailed from Epsom.
She desires to become a virgin but is
told that virgins are born, not made.
At last when her father's boat final
ly caught fire, June plunged over
board and swam back to New York
via the Horn. She is unable to go
through the Panama Canal because
Richard Haliburton is using it as his
swimming pool at a thirty-nine cents
rental.
Although June is troubled some
what because she had to carry as
excess baggage two sea dolphins and
a steamer, she is able to dictate her
autobiography to her father who is
riding beside her in a rowboat. For
two days while in a heavy fog she
swims under water.
Finally the daring Miss Triplett
emerges in the nick of time on the
lie de France to be welcomed by the
enthusiastic reporters.
Corey Ford does a good job but
the continual tomfoolery and child
ishness is apt to become trite. Still
it's a good book to while away an

hour or two between Hulme's "Re
naissance and Reformation" and
Freud.

it for a pet. A high-light of the story
is the drinking bout between Gladys
and June which ended in a whirling
contest and Papa Triplett getting his
knee wet, which was very embarras
sing.
She was the first white woman to
witness the Dance of the Virgins, in
company with Old Sedlitz, a beach
combing salt who hailed from Epsom.
She desires to become a virgin but is
told that virgins are born, not made.
At last when her father's boat final
ly caught fire, June plunged over
board and swam back to New York
via the Horn. She is unable to go
through the Panama Canal because
Richard Haliburton is using it as his
swimming pool at a thirty-nine cents
rental.
Although June is troubled some
what because she had to carry as
excess baggage two sea dolphins and
a steamer, she is able to dictate her
autobiography to her father who is
riding beside her in a rowboat. For
two days while in a heavy fog she
swims under water.
Finally the daring Miss Triplett
emerges in the nick of time on the
lie de France to be welcomed by the
enthusiastic reporters.
Corey Ford does a good job but
the continual tomfoolery and child
ishness is apt to become trite. Still
it's a good book to while away an

hour or two between Hulme's "Re
naissance and Reformation" and
Freud.
YOUNG GIRL AT SEA
"Salt Water Taffy," by Corey Ford.
G. P. Putnam's Sons, New York.
Joan Lowell got what she asked for.
"Salt Water Taffy" or "Twenty Thou
sand Leagues Away from the Sea" Is
a very clever take-off on "Cradle of
the Deep." It is perhaps as humorous
a book as any published this year, that
is if you have read Joan Lowell. Never
theless the stirring adventures of
June Triplett will give many laughs
to anyone but Miss Lowell.
Ezra Triplett's daughter truly set a
new high-water mark for modern mari
time autobiography.
June gets on her first boat when
she is three months old with her
duffle in a foot-square piece of white
linen and finds herself rather weak;
in fact, as she explains it, "weak as
a baby." It does not take long, how
ever, for her to learn to spit "Old
Coffin" chewing tobacco with the best
of them, arid is soon spitting figure
eights in the wind.
She was seven years old when she
cut open a female shark and found a
copy of "What Every Girl Should
Know" inside.
At an early age she learned to throw
the bulwarks, and play strip-poker
with the crew who learned their vo
cabulary from her.
Single-handed she captured a baby
water-spout named Gladys and kept
it for a pet. A high-light of the story
is the drinking bout between Gladys
and June which ended in a whirling
contest and Papa Triplett getting his
knee wet, which was very embarras
