# Illini' Editor Makes the Retort Courteous
## 
### 
We have heard from Illinois.
Not long ago, in the editorial col
umn, the editor took exception to the
fact that a Daily Illini editorial writer
had called Harry Gill "The greatest
collegiate track coach in America."
Lo, and behold, an ex-editor of the
same journal, Stewart Howe, was vis
iting on this campus. And Howe wrote
home.
And now, in a letter to the editor
of the Daily, Francis J. Koenig, for
mer chief editorial writer of the Daily
Illini, comes back with some great
truths. He didn't write the editorial.
He doesn't even defend it.
"I am inclined to agree heartily
with the comments you expressed in
the Stanford Daily," says Koenig.
(We have to go clear to Illinois to
find any such support as this!)
And then Koenig shows his editorial
training, his experience and observa
tion in four years of college news
paper work.
"Persons enrolled in a university
are apt to have a feeling of smugness
about the institution. Students at Illi
nois are especially cultivated in this
attitude. They feel that here at Cham
paign exists the greatest university
in the world; thnt it has the world's
best athletic teams; that it has one
of the largest libraries, etc. They be
lieve so thoroughly in the greatness
of the various aspects of the place
that they lose sight of the fact that
there are universities elsewhere."
A great truth, Mr. Koenig, and we
hope you will forgive us for quoting
your letter. Of course, it is a healthy
attitude —this Alma Mater worship—
but it certainly has its faults.
But it is in his next statement that
Koenig shows his insight, born of ex
perience'—bitter experience, doubt
less.
"A great mass of them believe that
the Daily Illini is the greatest college
daily in the world." (And it IS a good
paper.) "They are taught to believe
that." (Oh for a brother attitude at
Stanford!)
"To a number of us, who work on
the sheet, Buch a statement is a gross
exaggeration. We feel that the paper

is better than most college papers,
but we also realize that we have bet
ter facilities to produce a better paper
than most colleges. When we con
sider .... some of our unused op
portunities we realize immediately
that there are glaring faults in the
Illini.
"I will admit that for the first two
years I had the same illusion. I be
lieved that the Illini was the greatest
college daily. After more intimate con
tact with the paper, and with the peo
ple working on the paper, I have
changed my opinion."
There is a "lesson in this for all
of us."
Smugness Doesn't Pay.
"It is difficult to make great claims,
and then substantiate them," con
cludes Koenig.
"I hope the Stanford Daily has all
sorts of success."

fact that a Daily Illini editorial writer
had called Harry Gill "The greatest
collegiate track coach in America."
Lo, and behold, an ex-editor of the
same journal, Stewart Howe, was vis
iting on this campus. And Howe wrote
home.
And now, in a letter to the editor
of the Daily, Francis J. Koenig, for
mer chief editorial writer of the Daily
Illini, comes back with some great
truths. He didn't write the editorial.
He doesn't even defend it.
"I am inclined to agree heartily
with the comments you expressed in
the Stanford Daily," says Koenig.
(We have to go clear to Illinois to
find any such support as this!)
And then Koenig shows his editorial
training, his experience and observa
tion in four years of college news
paper work.
"Persons enrolled in a university
are apt to have a feeling of smugness
about the institution. Students at Illi
nois are especially cultivated in this
attitude. They feel that here at Cham
paign exists the greatest university
in the world; thnt it has the world's
best athletic teams; that it has one
of the largest libraries, etc. They be
lieve so thoroughly in the greatness
of the various aspects of the place
that they lose sight of the fact that
there are universities elsewhere."
A great truth, Mr. Koenig, and we
hope you will forgive us for quoting
your letter. Of course, it is a healthy
attitude —this Alma Mater worship—
but it certainly has its faults.
But it is in his next statement that
Koenig shows his insight, born of ex
perience'—bitter experience, doubt
less.
"A great mass of them believe that
the Daily Illini is the greatest college
daily in the world." (And it IS a good
paper.) "They are taught to believe
that." (Oh for a brother attitude at
Stanford!)
"To a number of us, who work on
the sheet, Buch a statement is a gross
exaggeration. We feel that the paper

is better than most college papers,
but we also realize that we have bet
ter facilities to produce a better paper
than most colleges. When we con
sider .... some of our unused op
portunities we realize immediately
that there are glaring faults in the
Illini.
"I will admit that for the first two
years I had the same illusion. I be
lieved that the Illini was the greatest
college daily. After more intimate con
tact with the paper, and with the peo
ple working on the paper, I have
changed my opinion."
There is a "lesson in this for all
of us."
Smugness Doesn't Pay.
"It is difficult to make great claims,
and then substantiate them," con
cludes Koenig.
"I hope the Stanford Daily has all
sorts of success."
We have heard from Illinois.
Not long ago, in the editorial col
umn, the editor took exception to the
fact that a Daily Illini editorial writer
had called Harry Gill "The greatest
collegiate track coach in America."
