# ERIC KRENZ BREAKS 20-YEAR-OLD RECORD WITH 18-POUND SHOT
## Casey Kazanjian Wins Special Weight Event; Many Cards Place 
### 
Effort is being made toward the
official recognition of the record
heave of 46 feet 3 inches made by
Eric Krenz with the 18-pound shot
Sunday at the South of Market Boys'
meet at Fairfax Park. It is claimed,
however, that the record was not
made under regulation conditions.
Krenz entered the event with a five
foot handicap, winning first place and
the award of a $100 Swiss wrist
watch.
Seven other Stanford athletes, en
tering either unattached or for the
Olympic Club, won cups. A1 Storms,
placing first in the high jump in spite
of an eight-inch handicap and second
in the 880, was awarded two cups. Les
Hables received two cups in the relay
and the 440. Casey Kazanjian won a
tobacco humidor and a cup for first
place in the 56-pound weight and
fourth place in the shot. Bob Dow,
for fourth place in the quarter, Ray
Ede, for second in the two-mile, Doug

Aiken, for third place in the half-mile,
and Tex Crandall, for fourth in the
half-mile, were awarded cups.
Crandall, unaware of the fact that
fourth place merited an award, left
the meet without his cup. However,
in due time, the El Toro collection
will be enriched with Tex's contribu
tion.

Brooklyn prohibition officers found
a still in a covered wagon.
