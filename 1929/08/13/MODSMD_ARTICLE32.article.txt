# TELEVISION PROMISED FOOTBALL FANS FOR CONTESTS OF FUTURE
## Apparatus Required Will Be Expensive, Says Dr. Karl K. Darrow 
### 
That the football fan who loves his
| fireside as well as the game may not
only hear but witness the contest by
means of i;adio and television "is
within the realm of possibility," ac
cording to Doctor Karl K. Darrow.
Such a convenience, however, would
be necessarily costly since the charges
for transmission alone would be a
hundred times the cost of a telephone
conversation, aside from the neces
sity of providing a very expensive ap
paratus.
Dr. Darrow, acting professor in the
department of physics and formerly
of the University of Chicago, is now
a member of the Technical Staff of
the Bell Telephone Laboratories of
New York City.
The greatest interest, according to
Dr. Darrow, among scientists con*
nected with communication, lies in
the construction of the first telephone
cable across the Atlantic. A cable
which will carry the human voice
must be tremendously more sensitive
than one carrying the dot and dash
of a telegraphic message. At present,
telephone conversations are radioed
between London and New York.
"Telephoto, the invention preceding
television, would have a great pos
sibility in China," said Dr. Darrow,
adding that the Chinese characters
have no equivalent in the telegra
pher's code. A page of characters can
be transmitted as a picture, however,
without the slightest difficulty or
chance of error. In this country, fac
similes of contracts, financial reports,
and rush copy for advertisements as
well as photographs are sent every
day by telephoto.
The difference in the speed of
sound and light is causing some in
conveniences for those in the rear
of the larger theatres exhibiting talk
ing movies. The difference in the rate
of travel of the two amounts to only
one-third of a second in the largest
show houses, yet the patrons are able
to detect the discrepancy between the
movement of the actor's lips and the
sound. This problem exists only in the
case of "closeups."
When the images projected on the
screen appear to be of natural size,
the patron is as unconscious of any
discrepancy as he would be at an
open-air concert where the blow on
the drum head is seen before it is
heard.
