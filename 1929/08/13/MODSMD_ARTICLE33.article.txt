for more than two hundred years?'
throw light on Virgil's spiritual sway
over European thought," she con
tinued. "This hitherto unwritten chap
ter is presented as contribution to the
history of Virgil's influence at the
two-thousandth anniversary of his
birth, when all the world is preparing

Stanford's contribution to the two
thousandth anniversary of Virgil's
birth will take place with the publi
cation of "Mapheaus Yegius and His
Thirteenth Book of the Aeneid: A
Chapter on Vi-gil in the Renaissance,"
by Dr. Anna Cox Brinton, acting pro
fessor of classical literature during
the summer. This volume will be pub
lished this fall by the Stanford Uni
versity press.
"The present vivid interest in
Italian humanism, and that perennial
admiration for Virgil which makes
his scholars in the twentieth century
no strangers to his lovers in the fif
teenth, prompts the publication of this
study of the most famous and most
widely read sequel to the Aeneid,"
