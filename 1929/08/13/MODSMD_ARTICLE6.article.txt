# No More Nourishment; Students' Hang-Out Closed For Summer
## 
### 
First the Ice cream melted away.
Then the last American cheese
sandwich gladdened the heart of a
late customer of the expiring Cellar.
Finally, the official bouncer held
the door open and announced, "All
out. End of the line."
Just outside, the "Open to the Pub
lic" sign added to the ludierousness
of the situation.
For the Cellar, at 10:15 p.m., West
ern Standard Time, last night, col
lapsed, gasped, and deceased com
pletely.
Employees confessed that they did
not know who issued the order to
close.
Not even signs were put up notify
ing the public that the Cellar was
closing for repairs.
As a result, this morning there were
no snails and coffee to snatch before
rushing to 8 o'clock, no prospect of a
liesurely afternoon bullsession in the
quiet crannies of its cool depths, and

no orange juice to top off an evening
of intensive study in the Libe.
Perhaps the management is going
the IS-day diet one better by insti
tuting an 18-day fast, it being just
that many days until the end of
the quarter.
First it was the swimming pool.
Then it was the Cellar. Maybe the
Daily will be next. Who knows?
