# ILLUSTRATED TALK ON ATTITUDE MEASURES GIVEN BY THURSTONE
## 
### 
"The Measurement of Attitude" was
the subject of the lecture given in
the Little Theatre yesterday after
noon by Dr. L. L. Thurstone of the
University of Chicago.
His lecture was based upon experi
ments and research of questions of
attitude which he has been studying
for the past few years.
"As a whole, a given group of peo
ple react much the same way to the
same questions and experiments of
attitude," stated Dr. Thurstone. He
illustrated the lecture with lantern
slide charts, all of which showed a
definite grouping of reactions in a
given group of people.
Dr. Thurstone is known as one of
the most eminent psychologists in the
country. He is widely noted for his
work in psychology at the Carnegie
Institute of Technology at Pittsburg
before and during the war. His work
was especially related to research
in the line of mechanical aptitude.
After the war he was connected with
the institute for juvenile research at
Chicago, and was also one of the first
and foremost leaders to apply satis
tical data to psychological analysis
and research.
