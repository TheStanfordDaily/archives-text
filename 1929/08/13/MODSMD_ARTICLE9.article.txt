# TALKIES HAVE EDUCATIONAL POSSIBILITIES SAY LEADERS
## Cubberley, Ichihashi Believe Method Will Change Education Ideas 
### 
Educational potentialities of the
talkies were demonstrated last night
in the Little Theatre before a group
of the faculty. Working on the theory
that education may be democratized
by the use of the talkies, three reels
of film, depicting the method of vari
ous industries and the voices and per
sonalities of certain world-renowned
men, were produced.
Films depicting the noise and the
processes of shaping molten and red
hot steel —the weaving of the largest
rug in the world, which now covers
the floor in the lobby of the New
Fox Theatre —the voice and person
ality of George Bernard Shaw, show
ing his ability as a mimic as well as
an author —the features and voice of
Lloyd George making an appeal for
a strong friendship between the Eng
lish-speaking nations, and that of
Benito Mussolini addressing the
American peoples as friends —the
click of the busy typewriters—the
roar of the smoothly running linotype
machine, giving a brief but compre
hensive pictures of the newspaper
methods of production, were used to
illustrate the plan.
Believed To Be Help
It is believed by the experimenters
that diplomacy, world relations and
citizenship would be vastly furthered
by the wide use of these talkies, and
that language, speech, and variation
would be standardized.
The ability of great magnifying the
most minute part to be demonstrated
will make the method even better
than the actual operation when the
demonstration must be made before
large groups—so it is hoped by scien
tists.
The projection of the pictures in an
automobile assembling plant gave defi-
nite and precise idea as to the time
and concentration of effort used in the
producing of the finished product.
Cubberley Enthusiastic .
Dr. E. P. Cubberley enthusiastically
says: "There are vast possibilities in
the plan. It will mean that a higher
grade of education will be taken to
the rural schools. Banding the schools
together in the districts will mean
that the smaller schools will make
this type of education entirely pos
sible."
Dr. Yamato Ichihashi believes that
speech will become more standardized,
but that it will not mean the forma
tion of an international language.
Experts of the Western Electric,
who arranged the preview for the fac
ulty, and who are now working on the
experiment in order to further per
fect it, believed that the instruments
will be used in the schools through
out the country in two or three years,
and that the arrangement will be so
simple as to make it possible for the
older students to understand and run
the machine themselves. As the ma
terial stands now the machine may be
set up in very little time, and com
pletely dismantled, in some ten min
utes.

A very clever and highly comic
story of the method of producing
sound pictures proved amusing, but
at the same time gave a rather start
ling picture of the immense complex
ity, and minute detail comprising the

I change of the sound waves into pic
tures of the sound —the synchroniza
! lion of the sound pictures and tha
pictures themselves —the perfection
| of this synchronization so that there
will be 110 chance to slip between the
pictures and the sound —the project
ing of the film on the screen and the
changing of the sound as recorded on
: the film. Audible sound by means of
two large amplifiers behind the screen.
! The screen itself is full of small per
j forations so that the sound may seem
to be 011 the screen.
The film will be shown to students
I today at 4 and 5 o'clock, and again
I tomorrow at 4 o'clock if there will be
| an audience large enough to warrant
it.

A very clever and highly comic

The nation's newest park, Teton
Park, was dedicated recently.
Educational potentialities of the
talkies were demonstrated last night
in the Little Theatre before a group
of the faculty. Working on the theory
that education may be democratized
by the use of the talkies, three reels
of film, depicting the method of vari
ous industries and the voices and per
sonalities of certain world-renowned
men, were produced.
Films depicting the noise and the
processes of shaping molten and red
hot steel —the weaving of the largest
rug in the world, which now covers
the floor in the lobby of the New
Fox Theatre —the voice and person
ality of George Bernard Shaw, show
ing his ability as a mimic as well as
an author —the features and voice of
Lloyd George making an appeal for
a strong friendship between the Eng
lish-speaking nations, and that of
Benito Mussolini addressing the
American peoples as friends —the
click of the busy typewriters—the
roar of the smoothly running linotype
machine, giving a brief but compre
hensive pictures of the newspaper
methods of production, were used to
illustrate the plan.
Believed To Be Help
It is believed by the experimenters
that diplomacy, world relations and
citizenship would be vastly furthered
by the wide use of these talkies, and
that language, speech, and variation
would be standardized.
The ability of great magnifying the
most minute part to be demonstrated
will make the method even better
than the actual operation when the
demonstration must be made before
large groups—so it is hoped by scien
tists.
The projection of the pictures in an
automobile assembling plant gave defi-
nite and precise idea as to the time
and concentration of effort used in the
producing of the finished product.
