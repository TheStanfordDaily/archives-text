## NO REST FOR THE WEARY 
### 
With "talkie" voices what they are,
one of the American's fundamental
rights is gone—he can no longer doze
in motion picture theatres.' And so
now that the talkies have invaded the
educational field on our own campus,
we view with alarm the trend of
the future. Are students to be robbed
of their traditional right to sleep in
lectures? Is the disturbing noise pro
duced in talking pictures going to
force everyone to get their sleep at
home. No! A thousand times No!
Let us band together to combat
this insidious menace. Is every class
hall to be a darkroom? Is every lec
ture to be a talkie? Will we have the
serenity of academic surroundings in
vaded by the latest affront to peace
and quiet?
It is bad enough to have to go to
the modern counterpart of the nickle
odeon to see a motion picture with
out hearing it. And even the tiniest
cinema houses are installing their
automatic noise-making devices —
whether they be Vitaphones, Movie
tones, Photophones.
Stage productions are being canned
—and ruined. A new generation is
growing up that sees everything
through the Hollywood interpretation.
The best stars of the stage are being
paid highly enough so that they are
Jending their aid to the talkies. Will
the great educators do likewise?
Let us earnestly hope not.
Or rather let us hope that the pro
ducers of talkies, before they start
their wholesale production of so
called educational subjects, keep cer
tain things in mind.
The first thing they will do well to
note is that sound, as mere sound,
has no value. The quite incomplete
samples shown here of the noise of
an automobile factory, or the making
of a newspaper were quite atrocious.
Why? Because the sound was noise—
just noise. It could not be identified.
It was entirely different when vari
ous contemporary eminent men were
shown on the screen, with somewhat
trite speeches recited to the "Great
American Nation."
One can see the value of personali
ties on the speaking screen. Like the
factory scenes, some of the talks may
be mere noise, but at least they show
a bit of the great one's personality.
The writer hastily hoped, in an
earlier paragraph, that great edu
cators would not submit to being
canned for reproduction. We retract.
We only hope that they, in the inevi
table spread of educational talkies,
realize that what they say must be
of vaiue, and must he to the point.
For they can't chalk black marks
against the restless individuals in an
invisible audience.
We await the future with a certain
confidence, some trepidation, but
mostly a great curiosity.
For with Personalities talking to
us on the screen, it will not be long
before we take the next step forward,
and hear the folks in person again.
