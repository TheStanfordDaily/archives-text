# TALKIE FILMS TO BE EDUCATIONAL FACTOR IN SCHOOL OF FUTURE
## 
### 
The group of pictures demonstrat
ing the theory of education through
the medium of the talkies will be
shown for the last time today at 4
o'clock in the Little Theatre.
The experimenters believe that in
the space of two or three years talkies
will be used to supplement the school
room lectures and textbooks.
They are anxious to see the method
so perfected that each school district
may own the necessary apparatus,
and, by circulating the films among
the district schools, carry the very
best material that can be collected
to the most outlying districts. This
would mean that cultural education
would in all probability be vastly
democratized, and thereby raise the
level of human life.
