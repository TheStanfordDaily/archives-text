# SERVICE LOOMS AS SUBSTITUTE FOR STANFORD TROLLEY
## University Authorities Favor Change In Mode of Transportation; Campus Will Receive More Efficient Service Palo Alto City Council Supports Peninsular Railway in Abandonment of Franchise in Highway Improvement; Consent of Railroad Body Sought 
### 
Motor bus service between the campus and Palo Alto will replace the
"Toonerville Trolley" in the future as a result of the cessation of street
car service, which will take place within a few weeks.
Following the combined action of the city council and the Peninsular
Railway Company Monday night to discontinue the line, the council ap
pointed a committee to confer with the railway company on plans for
establishing and routing the new bus line.
University support of the new proposition for campus transportation
was immediately given. In the opinion of Comptroller A. E. Roth, the

convenience and efficiency of a bus
service on the campus will be wel
comed by the University.
The decision to terminate campus
street car service comes as a result
of the improvement activities of the
California State Highway Commis
sion. This body has started on a pro
gram of widening the state highway.
In order to do this, it needed the nar
row strip of land now occupied by the
Peninsular Railway Company's tracks
running alongside the highway from
Palo Alto to just north of Mayfield.
To relay the track would require an
expenditure larger than the assessed
valuation of the whole line, including
the line to the campus. So the Penin
sular Railway asked the Palo Alto
city council to be relieved of the pro
visions of its franchise requiring the
company to furnish service for sev
eral years yet.
Monday evening the council agreed
to this request, and plans for the new
bus service were at once sought. Only
the permission of the State Railroad
Commission to allow the Railway's
request to discontinue its service is
needed. In addition to agreeing to this
request, the Palo Alto city council
has promised to support the company
when its case is presented to the rail
road commission.
With the abolition of street car ser
vice, the University faces the prob
lem of adequate freight delivery. It
is now believed that truck service will
be as efficient as the former service
was. A pipe line has been proposed
to be installed between the Palo Alto
Southern Pacific station and the cam
pus power plant for the delivery of
fuel oil.
If the plans of the council and the
railway meet no unexpected opposi
tion, the street car line will be aban
doned and the new bus service in
operation by the opening of the fall
quarter.
