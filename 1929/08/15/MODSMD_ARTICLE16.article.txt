# CAPEK DRAMA ENDS SUMMER SEASON; PLAY FRIDAY NIGHT
## Seats on Sale at Keeble's, Old Union; Tickets for Roughs at Door Scenes Laid in Old Vienna Designed by Helvenston Are Impressive 
### 
The last campus production of the
quarter, Karl Capek's "The Makro
poulos Secret," will be presented in
the Assembly Hall tomorrow night at
8:15. This play, with its qualities of
mystery, faint tragedy, and serious
philosophical thought, will appeal to
those who have seen and enjoyed
similar productions, such as "R.U.R.,'
by the same author, and O'Neil's
"Strange Interlude."
Tickets may be purchased at the
A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union and
at Keeble's in Palo Alto. Roughs' tick
ets will go on sale Friday night.
Four Men Affected
Capek's Emilia Marty, like Eugene
O'Neil's Nina in the "Strange Inter
lude," has her four men —at least
Capek is concerned with four of her
men. Emilia influences the life of
Janek, the adolescent whose emotions
are capable of carrying him away.
Gregor, the idealist, is enthralled with
her, idealizes her. Hauk-Senc'orf, al
though he is very old, is still living
on his memories of his past love-life.
Prus, the steel and velvet combina
tion, also becomes enmeshed in
Emilia's charms. Emilia, ancient,
beautiful, talented, holds her men,
but are they worth it all? Is this life
worth all that a person gives to it if
they know the secret of longevity?
These are the questions which enter
into Capeks problem of long life.
Opens With Law Case
Opening with the discussion of a
hereditary law case which has lasted
almost a hundred years, the first act
gives an idea of mystery, and a feel
ing of uncanniness. The second act
carries the theme on to the first cli
max reaching melodramatic points.
Tragedy intermingled with a philo
sophic vein as to the advantages and
the disadvantages of longevity form
the basis of the third act which takes
the play to a highly impressionistic
climax.
The cast includes many players
who are new to the Stanford audi
ences, but they have all had experi
ence elsewhere. Irene Mansfeldt, who
plays Capek's Kristina, has appeared
with Irving Pichell's San Francisco
Guild, a little theatre group which was
quite prominent in San Francisco a
number of years ago. Tom Henry as
Baron Prus, Virginia Volland as
Emilia Marty, and Burnell Gould as
Vitek are all well-known for their
previous work on the campus.
The others of the cast are John
