# Another Successful Season Closes
## 
### 
Tomorrow night the last of the summer play productions, "The
Makropoulos Secret,'' by Karel Capek, justly famous author of "R.U.R.,"
will close an unusually successful season.
Gordon Davis in selecting the. plays for production, chose those of
the highest type, both in literary value and in entertainment. The
usual frothy drama has been abandoned and substituted for it have been
such plays as "The Adding Machine," by Elmer Rice, "The Second Man,"
by S. N. Behrman, and "The Makropoulos Secret."'
Not that these plays are not entertaining. They are. They present a
problem to the audience amMt is in the solution of this problem that its
entertainment lies. They have been admirably suited to the college mind,
particularly the type of mind that is found at Stanford during summer
quarter.
Notice the settings tomorrow night. Designed by Harold Helvenston
and executed in the modern note by the class in stagecraft, they are truly
representative of the high quality of Stanford productions. lielvenston
has received favorable comment for his work in many of the leading
professional theatrical magazines. Theatre Magazine this month has two
pictures of stage settings designed and used in campus productions this
spring.
The Daily takes this last opportunity to repeat what has already
been said in this column: Stanford theatricals are rapidly coming to the
front and taking their rightful place among the leaders in this field.
Some day we will have a theatre to match the splendid work that is being
done on the Stanford stage â€”in the near future, we hope.
