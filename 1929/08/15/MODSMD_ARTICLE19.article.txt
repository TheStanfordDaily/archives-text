# Talkies Invade Foreign Lands
## 
### 
Coincidentally with the educational talkies that were exhibited this
week in the Little Theatre as a new experiment in educational methods,
conies the announcement from South America that the leading theatres
of the southern continent are installing American talkie equipment.
This latest development of Hollywood seems to herald the dawn of
a new era, not only in educational methods, in entertainment, but also in
that phase of American life that has been cussed and discussed the world
over—imperialism. For some years there has been a lament from
European observers that American movies were obliterating the quaint
picturesqueness of those old countries. They fear an absorption of
American ideas and ideals, perhaps more than an armed conflict. They
fear these ideas and ideals because they bring a demand for American
products and manufactures.
Canada, too, has been protesting the invasion of American goods and
American movies. Its natural culture is becoming mixed with the
American.
Now with the advent of the talkies, comes a new danger to European
markets and world culture. American ideas, American products will be
displayed in every country. Educational talkies, if present plans material
ize, will present American methods in production, American educational
procedure, and they will be in English. Thus the chances of making the
English language the commercial and cultural language of the world are
vastly increased.
Gone are the days of rough and ready, bristling imperialism. It is
now a much more subtle process, capturing the minds and the markets
of foreign countries, instead of their lands. Edison's invention is chang
ing the course of world history.
