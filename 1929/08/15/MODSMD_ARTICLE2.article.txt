# VON HENTIG'S EXPERIENCES IN EAST ASIA TRIP RELATED
## Perilous Trip Through Asia, Afghanistan During War Recounted German Diplomat Addresses Large Audience in Little Theatre 
### 
Through the enemy's posts in the
dead of night. Across mountain passes
choked with snow and ice. Achieving
the near impossible. This is the story
of Dr. W. O. Von Hentig's thrilling
and perilous diplomatic journey
across central Asia for the German
government during the war.
Dr. Von Hentig spoke Tuesday night
in the Little Theatre before one of
the largest audiences of the summer.
He illustrated part of his talk with
lantern slides of pictures taken dur
ing the trip.
Fever Sets In
Dr. Von Hentig painted a graphic
picture of the hardships endured by
his little band while crossing the vast
expanse of Asia. Leaving Afghanistan,
they crossed into China via the moun
tain passes. All the party were sick
for twenty-one days with the moun
tain fever. In China they were con
fronted with many other difficulties.
Travel by night was necessitated
by the danger of meeting Cossack out
posts. Storm and darkness made
travel almost impossible, but evading
traps, scaling precipitous mountains,
capturing and taking with them all
the natives who saw them to prevent
news of their whereabouts reaching
the enemy, Dr. Von Hentig's party
finally penetrated the Russian camps
and into China.
Chinese Suspicious
Once in China, the influence of the
Emir of Afghanistan was of some
help. However, the people were sus
picious of the German party, and only
by the most careful and diplomatic
action was it possible to win through
to the Pacific coast.
Dr. Von Hentig explained that the
friendly Chinese were highly prone
to offer gifts. The receiver was ex
pected, however, to return the gift
double. Before the trip was over the
Germans had given away practically
all of their personal possessions. Dr.
Von Hentig presented one Chinese
general with his bathing suit, which
the Oriental wore with great pride
over his uniform.
Dr. Von Hentig was 160 days cross
ing Asia after spending the previous
year in Afghanistan. In all this time
he tasted no bread, no butter, no
European food, heard no European
language, and never for one moment
was he able to abandon the etiquette
demanded by the oriental people.
Studies Orientals
During the journey Dr. Von Hentig
had opportunities to study the Chi
nese people most intimately. He said
that they are losing faith in their
older religions and beliefs, and de
veloping new arts and culture. Ameri
can students are greatly influencing
China. It will not be long, in Dr. Von
Hentig's opinion, until China will be
one of the greatest nations in the
world. Her people are great colonizers
and organizers, her men make splen
did soldiers, and she governs easily
and well.
Dr. Von Hentig eventually com
pleted his journey through Asia. He
went by way of Japan to San Fran
cisco, and after considerable delay he
was sent under guard to New York
and thence home to Germany and
Berlin.
