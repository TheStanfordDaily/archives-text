# Traffic Regulationâ€”A Goal in Sight
## 
### 
With the announcement that Palo Alto is soon to start work on
widening University avenue between the highway and the circle and
with the proposal to remove the tracks of the street car to the campus,
the junction of Palm Drive, University Avenue, and the highway, is
ready for its much-needed traffic regulation.
We are looking forward to a goal at last distinct in the distance.
Until now the sight of a traffic officer or a mechanical signal at this
junction has hardly been dreamed of as a coming reality. Now it looms
nj) as a rapidly approaching object.
A ride free from expectcd crashes, irritated shouts, and muffled
curses is one step nearer. We are hoping to he rid of the uncomfortable
concern of traffic jams and the continuous anticipation of accidents that
have been especially a part of Sunday driving.
