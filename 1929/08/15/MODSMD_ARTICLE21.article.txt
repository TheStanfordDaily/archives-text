The removal of the trolley tracks on the campus is imminent.
With it the slow, bumpy ride from Palo Alto and the long walk from
the bookstore to wherever you want to go will be things of the past.
The outcome of the disappearance of what may be called one of
Stanford's traditions will be quicker, more extended, more comfortable
transportation, probably by means of a bus circuit, more convenient than
the trolley could possibly be.
Stanford can hardly shed a tear over the death of this tradition when
jt means the life of such a system.
