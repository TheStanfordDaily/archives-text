# FINAL EXCURSION OF SUMMER WILL HEAD FOR ARTIST COLONY
## Carmel, California's Quaint Village by the Sea, Climaxes Tours 
### 
Stanford students who would flee j
from the noise and congestion of
the campus, and those who prefer
roadside paths to city sidewalks and
a moonlit beach to a Great White
Way will join the last summer excur
sion when it leaves for Carmel Satur
day morning.
Secluded amidst the promontories
of the rugged Pacific coast, and faced
by a mile of white glistening beach,
lies California's quaintest village. Car
mel, located a few miles south of
Monterey, is a city where progress is
feared, a city where art wages a con
stant battle against the dollar. Such
is the setting and such is the attitude
of this temperamental people who
have created and preserved an art
ists' Utopia.
The natural beauty of the section
of the Pacific coast that is the site
of Carmel was first described to the
American people by Dr. David Starr
Jordan, 45 years ago, and when Stan
ford's Chancellor Emeritus was a gov
ernment surveyor. Later, when the
village was begun, Dr. Jordan was
among the first to build. Other pro
fessors from the universities followed
him, all building near one another,
developing the "Professors' Row" of
today.
Seventeen-Mile-Drive
The far-famed Seventeen-Mile-Drive,
a winding scenic highway bordering
the coast, will be followed by the ex
cursionist from Monterey southward.
Skirting the Del Monte forest, this
thrive wanders among the Cypress
trees, blanched and twisted trunks,
the only natural group of Cypress on
the North American Continent.
Monterey, a small fishing commun
ity included in the itinerary of the
excursion, shone in the limelight of
early California history. Here Cali
fornia's first legislative meeting was
held and the state constitution
adopted. California's first theatre
opened in this coastal town.
Reservations for the climaxing ex
cursion of the summer season may
be made in the office of Director
Sellards in the Administration Build
ing. The fare per person will be $6.50.
Leaving the Union at 7:30 in the
morning the excursionist will return
to the campus about 9:30 the same
evening.
