### 
"Education is one of the largest
political businesses and is larger than
most corporate business enterprises,"
declared Dr. J. B. Sears of the edu
cation faculty who spoke on "Some
of Our Business Problems in Schools"
at yesterday's weekly Education Club
luncheon In the Union.
Dr. Sears said that the efficiency
of school plants must be judged with
out regard to profits, which are the
first consideration with business
plants. The problems of school busi
ness must be attacked from two
standpointsâ€”the scientific, and sound
economic progress.
