# Actors Subordinated To Stage Director In German Drama Today
## Professor von der Leyen Speaks on Teuton Drama In Little Theatre 
### 
"Germany with its abundance of
theatres has more possibilities in
stage settings than any other coun
try. Spiritual Germany feels a great
love and veneration for the great dra
matists of the world.
"Poets and actors are least and last
in a modern play," declared Dr. Fried
rich von der Leyen, acting professor
of German from the University of
Cologne, who talked on "Modern Ger
man Stage Settings" in the Little
Theatre yesterday afternoon.
Actors Second
"When one looks at a play program
the first man of interest is the stage
director, the second the artist who
designed the setting, next, the ladies'
tailor who made the dresses, the
business house that lent the furni
ture, and so on. Before you see the
actors and hear the first word of the
drama you applaud the setting."
From the poetic point of view, the
drama in the last few decades has
lost infinitely more than one can
realize. From the scenic and theatri
cal standpoint it has gained and is
gaining more and more.
Classic Settings
Dr. von tier Leyen said that new
and interesting stage settings are
found not only in the modern drama
but also in the performances of
Schiller, Goethe, Shakespeare, Rich
ard Wagner, and others. Stage set
tings today have a symbolic as well
as a literal meaning. The movies and
other technical accomplishments
make possible artistic experiments
that were not possible before.
"In the realistic dramas of Ibsen
you cannot change one sentence with
out destroying the whole work. The
modern drama suffers no damage
when it is altered; it may even be
improved."
Aided by a large number of lantern
slides, Dr. von der Leyen traced the
development of settings used in the
production of the works of such mas
ters as Wagner, Goethe, Mozart, and
Shakespeare.
Settings Pictured
Among others, he showed scenes
l'rom Mozart's "Magic Flute," Goethe's
"Faust," and Wagner's "Meister
singer," and "Percival." In general, it
was pointed out that the older set
tings were elaborate, while the more
modern were simplified to the extent
of extreme modernistic art.
For instance, the old setting of the
Palace of the Holy Grail in the Meis
tersinger was an elaborate interior.
The modern settings were merely sug
gestions of what the work was to
convey. One setting consisted simply
of Gothic arches in a fascinating pat
tern, without any attempt to depict
the actual interior of the church.

gestions of what the work was to
convey. One setting consisted simply
of Gothic arches in a fascinating pat
tern, without any attempt to depict
the actual interior of the church.
"Germany with its abundance of
theatres has more possibilities in
stage settings than any other coun
try. Spiritual Germany feels a great
love and veneration for the great dra
matists of the world.
"Poets and actors are least and last
in a modern play," declared Dr. Fried
rich von der Leyen, acting professor
of German from the University of
Cologne, who talked on "Modern Ger
man Stage Settings" in the Little
Theatre yesterday afternoon.
Actors Second
"When one looks at a play program
the first man of interest is the stage
director, the second the artist who
designed the setting, next, the ladies'
tailor who made the dresses, the
business house that lent the furni
ture, and so on. Before you see the
actors and hear the first word of the
drama you applaud the setting."
From the poetic point of view, the
drama in the last few decades has
lost infinitely more than one can
realize. From the scenic and theatri
cal standpoint it has gained and is
gaining more and more.
Classic Settings
Dr. von tier Leyen said that new
and interesting stage settings are
found not only in the modern drama
but also in the performances of
Schiller, Goethe, Shakespeare, Rich
ard Wagner, and others. Stage set
tings today have a symbolic as well
as a literal meaning. The movies and
other technical accomplishments
make possible artistic experiments
that were not possible before.
"In the realistic dramas of Ibsen
you cannot change one sentence with
out destroying the whole work. The
modern drama suffers no damage
when it is altered; it may even be
improved."
Aided by a large number of lantern
slides, Dr. von der Leyen traced the
development of settings used in the
production of the works of such mas
ters as Wagner, Goethe, Mozart, and
Shakespeare.
Settings Pictured
Among others, he showed scenes
l'rom Mozart's "Magic Flute," Goethe's
"Faust," and Wagner's "Meister
singer," and "Percival." In general, it
was pointed out that the older set
tings were elaborate, while the more
modern were simplified to the extent
of extreme modernistic art.
For instance, the old setting of the
Palace of the Holy Grail in the Meis
tersinger was an elaborate interior.
The modern settings were merely sug
gestions of what the work was to
convey. One setting consisted simply
of Gothic arches in a fascinating pat
tern, without any attempt to depict
the actual interior of the church.
