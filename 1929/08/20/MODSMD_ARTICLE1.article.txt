A VISION OF GRAND OPERA
A month more and Stanford's white
jerseyed football team will trot into
the stadium for the first time of the
season, to the well-assorted cheers
of some eighty-seven thousand or less
fans. A month more to football, and
only a bit more than that to the start
of a brilliant conference schedule.
And when the Cardinal machine
lines up for the kick-off, crouches for
the first play, and then sweeps into
a deadly offensive, there might be a
few in the rabid crowd of spectators
that will think back over the days
when the stadium was filled with spec
tators for other displays, will remem
ber when the stadium was the scene
of grand opera.
Not that football isn't a glorious
spectacle—those of us who watched
a giant fullback, almost single-handed,
tie the Trojan eleven with some
thirty-odd seconds to spare will never
doubt that. But there that huge bowl
lies —capacity eighty-seven thousand,
they say—used in the fall only twice
a week and in the spring only a little
more, and that's all.
True, once in a generation or so a
presidential candidate may accept his
party's nomination there. Lately there
has come a custom of sophomores and
freshmen doing battle within its con
fines. There may come a day when
the senior class will march over the
gridiron to receive diplomas, and
another when the stadium will offi
cially replace the cactus gardens as
the scene of evening chats. But all
this would hardly tax the big bowl.
Grand opera in the stadium. Sounds
out of place, doesn't it? But it wasn't
so long ago—seven years this June.
And in place of the quarterback's sig
nals, Martinelli —long since a Metro
politan star —singing Don Jose in Car
men, and Merola conducting Pagliacci
and Faust.
There are not many here now who
can remember those three nights,
when grand opera was heard at the
base of the Stanford foothills, when
the truly great ones sang their glori
ous arias beneath the stars. But
those who heard and remember, and
those who aren't satisfied with a con
cert series and a Junior Opera or two,
want it again.

San Francisco has its opera season
each year, and each year hundreds of
peninsula folk join the San Francis
cans in doing homage to the produc
tions brought to them. Now the opera
companies find San Francisco unsatis
factory—not in support, but in facili
ties for presentation. The Civic Audi
torium has been abandoned, and like
wise Dreamland liink. Thus, across
the bay, Oakland acts as host.
Why can't Stanford take the lead in
this as it has in other artistic ven
tures? Why can't the peninsula music
lovers come to the campus, and the
San Franciscans, too, who need travel
an hour south instead of an hour east?
The stadium is here, and its quali
ties outstandingly demonstrated by
the success of its first "season. The
patronage is at hand, and the audi
ences readily obtainable. It is time for
Stanford to bring opera—grand opera
—back to the campus.

A month more and Stanford's white
jerseyed football team will trot into
the stadium for the first time of the
season, to the well-assorted cheers
of some eighty-seven thousand or less
fans. A month more to football, and
only a bit more than that to the start
of a brilliant conference schedule.
And when the Cardinal machine
lines up for the kick-off, crouches for
the first play, and then sweeps into
a deadly offensive, there might be a
few in the rabid crowd of spectators
that will think back over the days
when the stadium was filled with spec
tators for other displays, will remem
ber when the stadium was the scene
of grand opera.
Not that football isn't a glorious
spectacle—those of us who watched
a giant fullback, almost single-handed,
tie the Trojan eleven with some
thirty-odd seconds to spare will never
doubt that. But there that huge bowl
lies —capacity eighty-seven thousand,
they say—used in the fall only twice
a week and in the spring only a little
more, and that's all.
True, once in a generation or so a
presidential candidate may accept his
party's nomination there. Lately there
has come a custom of sophomores and
freshmen doing battle within its con
fines. There may come a day when
the senior class will march over the
gridiron to receive diplomas, and
another when the stadium will offi
cially replace the cactus gardens as
the scene of evening chats. But all
this would hardly tax the big bowl.
Grand opera in the stadium. Sounds
out of place, doesn't it? But it wasn't
so long ago—seven years this June.
And in place of the quarterback's sig
nals, Martinelli —long since a Metro
politan star —singing Don Jose in Car
men, and Merola conducting Pagliacci
and Faust.
There are not many here now who
can remember those three nights,
when grand opera was heard at the
base of the Stanford foothills, when
the truly great ones sang their glori
ous arias beneath the stars. But
those who heard and remember, and
those who aren't satisfied with a con
cert series and a Junior Opera or two,
want it again.

San Francisco has its opera season
each year, and each year hundreds of
peninsula folk join the San Francis
cans in doing homage to the produc
tions brought to them. Now the opera
companies find San Francisco unsatis
factory—not in support, but in facili
ties for presentation. The Civic Audi
torium has been abandoned, and like
wise Dreamland liink. Thus, across
the bay, Oakland acts as host.
Why can't Stanford take the lead in
this as it has in other artistic ven
tures? Why can't the peninsula music
lovers come to the campus, and the
San Franciscans, too, who need travel
an hour south instead of an hour east?
The stadium is here, and its quali
ties outstandingly demonstrated by
the success of its first "season. The
patronage is at hand, and the audi
ences readily obtainable. It is time for
Stanford to bring opera—grand opera
—back to the campus.
