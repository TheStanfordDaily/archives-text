# 'Makropoulos Secret' Scores Hit As Summer Dramatic Season Ends
## Virginia Volland Triumphs as Emilia Marty; Henry, Wade, Gould Star in Karel Capek's Drama of Austrian Life in Assembly Hall Production 
### 
It doesn't always take a good play to make a successful performance. This
fact was proved last Friday night in the Stanford Dramatic Council's presen
tation of "The Makropoulos Secrett" —the last of the summer plays. What
was lacking in the mechanical make-up of the play was made up for hy good
acting, good directing, and good technical work.
The play itself was not lacking in fine points, but it had its obvious faults.
Karel Capek—the author —had developed an excellent plot; he had created
some strikingly interesting and forceful characters; and he had given the
play some intensively dramatic scenes. Capek failed, however, to make all

S>his scenes interesting—a few of them
!dragged miserably; and he wrote some
' scenes tliat were too much talk and
| too little action.
Secret of Longevity
Then the basic idea, of the play—
i that, a formula existed that would
guarantee a physically eternal life —
was rather ridiculous. Even if one
\ were to admit, that everything is pos
sible it would be hard to believe.
Virginia Volland gave a beautiful and
finished performance as Emilia Marty,
i and almost had to carry the entire
i burden of the play on her own shoul
j ders. Charles Wade, as Hank Sendorf
—the feeble-minded lover of Miss
Marty—stole the show for a few mo
ments in the second act with his stir
ring scene with Miss Volland. John
Yeon made a very successful intro
duction into campus dramatics with
his interpretation of the small part of
Janek Prus. Yeon and Irene Mans
feldt, who also gave a good perform
ance, did excellent bits of acting in
their scene.
Characterizations Good
Though Tom Henry has done good
work in some of his previous campus
plays, his work as Baron Prus was
exceptional. Burnell Gould also gave
an interesting performance, making
the character of Vitek real.
John Hiestand, as Albert Gregor,
gave a bit of an amateurish acting,
especially in his love scenes with
Emilia Marty. Although Virgil Ander
soon looked the part of a lawyer the
interpretation of his lines carried too
much shouting to be effective. Blanche
Reed, as the scrubwoman; Neville
Woodruff, as the mechanic; Helen
Wall, as the French maid; and Ed
Fields, as the physician, completed
the cast.
Gordon Davis* directing was above
average, though his groupings at
times seemed to be handled rather
awkwardly, and the action was much
too slow in the last part of the last
act.
Settings Effective
Harold Helvenston's settings were
effective as usual, though the first act

set in the lawyer's office seemed
rather under par. The colorful sets
for the second and third sets easily
made up for the unimpressive start,
and showed the effective work and
designing that is done for the campus
dramatics.
