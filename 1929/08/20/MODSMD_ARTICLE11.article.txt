# 'Makropoulos Secret' Scores Hit As Summer Dramatic Season Ends
## Virginia Volland Triumphs as Emilia Marty; Henry, Wade, Gould Star in Karel Capek's Drama of Austrian Life in Assembly Hall Production

It doesn't always take a good play to make a successful performance. This
fact was proved last Friday night in the Stanford Dramatic Council's presen
tation of "The Makropoulos Secrett" —the last of the summer plays. What
was lacking in the mechanical make-up of the play was made up for hy good
acting, good directing, and good technical work.
The play itself was not lacking in fine points, but it had its obvious faults.
Karel Capek—the author —had developed an excellent plot; he had created
some strikingly interesting and forceful characters; and he had given the
play some intensively dramatic scenes. Capek failed, however, to make all

S>his scenes interesting—a few of them
!dragged miserably; and he wrote some
' scenes tliat were too much talk and
| too little action.
Secret of Longevity
Then the basic idea, of the play—
i that, a formula existed that would
guarantee a physically eternal life —
was rather ridiculous. Even if one
\ were to admit, that everything is pos
sible it would be hard to believe.
Virginia Volland gave a beautiful and
finished performance as Emilia Marty,
i and almost had to carry the entire
i burden of the play on her own shoul
