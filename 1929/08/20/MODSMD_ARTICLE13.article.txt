# Chinas Chances Best For Survival In World Struggle For Existence Is Opinion of Dr. Edwin Copeland
## Nations Slide Into Oblivion Because of Repeated Revolution; Oriental Country Achieved Present Culture While Other Lands Still Savage 
### 
In the struggle for existence China has the best chance for survival of
any of the nations, and is destined to become the world's greatest power, Is
the opinion of Dr. Edwin Bingham Copeland, '95, now at the University of
California, a scientist, philosopher, and author of a study of practical ethics
published by the Stanford University Press.
"Nations that go in for revolutions of any sort tend to revolve themselves
into oblivion," Dr. Copeland declared in an interview. " The progressive

'nation seeks the top of the mountain,
and has no place left to go except
down the other side."
Early Civilization
"China attained something like her
present civilization when most of the
races of the world were still savage,
and thereby gained such an advan
tage over her neighbors that they
could not compete and stimulate fur
ther progress. China has been over
run at least three times by nomads,
but they had no enduring effect on
Chinese culture."
When Dr. Copeland was questioned
as to the future of the country he as
serted that history repeats itself in
the ultimate end of all progressive
countries. Countries that grow great
have a tendency to grow lax in the
observances of the customs which
made it great and its progress is then
toward the graveyard.
Customs Underrated
Progressiveness and enterprise have
a prominent place among our ideals,
admits Dr. Copeland, but in the en
thusiastic appreciation of our own
type of culture, however, we under
value old customs. Such an attitude
may possibly effect our ultimate de
struction.
The Chinese exemplify the opposite
type of culture. The merit of their
type of culture under the conditions
that exist is not a question of discus
sion. Economic competition with the
Chinese in California has resulted in
the temporary escape by keeping them
away. Sooner or later, in the opinion
of Dr. Copeland, we will meet these
well-schooled experts in survival.
Ethics Neglected
Dr. Copeland came to Stanford to
visit Dr. Jordan, who started him in
the study of organic evolution and so
inspired his present book, "Natural
Conduct," to which he has devoted
fifteen years. Ethics, the science of
happiness, Dr. Copeland feels, is badly
neglected, both in science and educa
tion. Inadequate attention to the prin
ciples of conduct is prevalent in these
fields, he asserts.
