"All conditions of student life are
different from those in America," ex
plains Dr. Michotte. The University
of Louvain spreads over the entire
city of Louvain, and includes thirty
nine separate colleges. In this respect
Louvain is similar to the universities
of Oxford and, Cambridge. Professor
Michotte will show pictures of these
various colleges.
"Louvain is a very strong moral
unit," says Professor Michotte. "Be
cause Belgium remained under Span
ish influence and did not revolt with
Holland, Catholicism is very strong
there." He estimates that there are
scarcely half a dozen students at Lou
vain that are not Catholic.
Professor Michotte is a graduate of
Louvain. He supplemented his educa
tion at the Universities of Leipsic and
Wurzburg. In 190G he became pro
fessor of psychology at Louvain. At
this time he established a laboratory
there, and since that time the equip
ment and reputation of that labora
tory has grown until today it is one
of the best-known psychological lab
oratories in Europe.
Professor Michotte is a lecturer of
considerable experience. He has been
special lecturer at the Universities of
London, Cambridge, Barcelona, and
Utrecht. Next November he will give
a series of lectures at the University
of Groningen, Holland.
This summer Professor Michotte
has been visiting professor of psycho
logy at Stanford University. The lec
ture tonight will be open to the pub
lic.
New York City has spent $4,000,000
for football and baseball stadiums for
schoolboy athletes within ten years.
