# SUMMER TRIPS TO BE DISCONTINUED UNLESS INCREASE IN DEMAND
## 
### 
The number of Stanford summer
excursions for 1930 will be reduced
unless there is an increase in the de
mand for them. This is the opinion
of the office of the director of the
summer quarter in reaction to the
lack of interest in the past summer's
tours.
The only trip that continues to be
popular with the summer students is
the annual excursion to the Lick Ob
servatory on Mount Hamilton. It is
possible that this will be the only
tour retained as a University activity.
The increasing number of cars on the
campus with the convenient possibili
ties of private trips is blamed for the
declining interest in the organized
excursions.
