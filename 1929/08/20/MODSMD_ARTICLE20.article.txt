Today 150 Japanese cadets from the Imperial Japanese training squad
ron are visiting the campus. 1 hey represent the cream of Japanese youth.
Some of these young men in twenty years will be the admirals of one
of the most powerful navies in the world. Today, they are merely visitors
in a foreign land, their strongest competitor on the Pacific.
The impressions of the United States that these young men carry
away with them will doubtless be remembered all their lives. The cry of
the alarmist, the Anglo-American feeling of superiority must be forgotten.
We, in America, can have no ill-feeling toward the millions in the East
if we are to continue our fight for world peace.
They should carry back with them an impression of a land that is
progressing industrially, educationally, and in the peaceful arts. If they
do. the chances of future wars, not only in the Pacific but all over the
globe, are greatly reduced. It is cheaper to make friends than enemies.
Japan, after the great earthquake at Tokyo, turned to America as her
friend. She asked Charles A. Beard, one of our most prominent his
torians and educators, to supervise the work of rehabilitation. Great
funds were subscribed in this country to carry out the work. As long as
we maintain this attitude of helpfulness and friendliness there will be no
trouble on the Pacific. The "Yellow Peril" cry can be forgotten.
It is strange to note that the man who greatly influenced the fear of
Japan and the "yellow hordes" twenty years ago is today financing the
flight of the Graf Zeppelin, that is now hovering over Tokyo, as a har
binger of world peace'. Our attitude is changing.
