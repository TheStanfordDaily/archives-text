# A 						Challenge to America
## 
### 
Dr. Edwin Bingham Copeland, ,( J5, in an interview published today,
labels America as one of the great nations that has grown lax in the
observation of those customs which have made it great â€”to an extent
which may lead to ultimate destruction.
Is this not a direct condemnation of the American educational system?
For it is in the schools of any nation that cultural background is instilled
into the minds of the people.
Arc students in the institutions of higher learning in America going to
stand by and let this culture, the foundation for these very institutions,
be shoved farther and farther out of our sight?
According to Dr. Copeland, China with its long-standing culture, is
destined to become the world's great power. This is a threat to America
as a nation and a challenge to the universities of the country to awaken
that interest in old customs which is necessary to preserve America's
present position of prominence in world affairs.
Little attention is being paid to the science of ethics .which Dr. Cope
land calls the science of happiness, in our public education system.
America is turning her eyes away from what is foremost in our progress.
Stanford and other similar institutions throughout the country have
an opportunity to play a role tremendous in importance not only in
directly laying the foundation for the future of America, but indirectly
in opening a pathway for other progressive nations to follow.
