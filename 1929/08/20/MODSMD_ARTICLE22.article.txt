Good. We wish no ill to the excursion company, but the poor support
given them—and their trips are for their educational value —is only an
other indication that Stanford students don't require personally conducted
tours to see the country. Each Friday, a whole day before the regular
excursion starts, carloads of collegians migrate from the campus; wher
ever one goes, to Del Monte, to the Russian River, to Tahoe, they extend
a cheery greeting. All this shows that they certainly don't stay cooped
up on the premises.
The present generation is being educated in an automobile. And its
own automobile serves quite well.
