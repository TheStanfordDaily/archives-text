Sounding once more the modern muck-raking note in stage dramas,
Broadway's latest interpretation of college life "Nowadays,"' by Arthur
F. Brash, opened recently. Following the manner of Ben Hecht's "Front
Page," the author of this startling expose proposes to flaunt the vagaries
of college "souses" in the face of babbitized Americans.
The play deals with the campus hero as the object of conquest by
three highly attractive co-eds. The principal scene is laid in a speak-easy
where, in a brawl, Boyd is attacked by a bootlegger and saved at the
crucial moment by one of the co-eds, who kills the bootlegger.
Of course, college students can't carry on that way without paying
for it, and the co-ed commits suicide. Crass melodrama at best, we
predict that this latest production of Brady's will have no effect on the
enrollment in our institutions of higher learning.
Contrary to the views expressed in many recent attacks on university
life, the majority of college students still retain their sense of decency
and propriety.
