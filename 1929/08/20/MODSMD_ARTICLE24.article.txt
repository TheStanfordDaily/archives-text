## "Wolf Solent"—Philosophical Failure 
### 
Wolf Solent, by John Cowper Powys. I
Published by Simon and Schuster.
From the inner Sanctum of Simon
and Schuster, who gave us such peren
nial masterpieces as "Trader Horn,"
"Believe It or Not," and "Cradle of
the Deep," comes word that Mr.
Powys' novel is "enduring fiction."
Yes, even I will agree to that. When
I read the novel, I called by activity
"enduring fiction." In fact I endured
so much I was delighted two-fold at
my unexpected strength, and at the
stupidity of "Wolf Solent." Stupidity,
I may add, always delights me be
cause it gives me a chance to sparkle.
Mr. Powys, holding a rustic walking
stick, assumed a pose as much akin
to the favorite posture of John Barry
more as the laws of copyright would
permit, made the cover to this prose
masterpiece. He looks like a grey
hound whose hunting days are over.
That is apparent and his haphazard
and uninteresting style of writing and
selection for this book. The hunt for
philosophy, for beauty, for new things
to interpret is past, but the hunt for
contention, for publicity continues.
The Critical comments and prefaces
of Mr. Durant and Mr. Dreiser are
almost as amusing as the book itself.
Mr. Durant judges the book philoso
phically, Mr. Dreiser, artistically.
Philosophical Failure
Mr. Powys' novel is almost a philo
sophical failure. Wolf Solent eats,
sleeps, and philosophizes as much as
anyone who may have paid five dol
lars for the book would desire. Or
that class of readers who think Will
Durant's "Story of Philosophy" is
even remotely connected with its sub
ject.
After years of writing unusual
scenes similar to his classic one about
the pigs who devoured their master
to gain his power, Mr. Powys gave
up, and decided to bestow upon the
world a sort of Tarkington subject in
I epical dress. Through a rain of ad
jectives, and a hail of adverbs, Mr.
Powys takes us readers through
Wolf's rationalistic and animalistic
lives. The quest for perfection in life
is really obtained in the final chap
ter, because Wolf goes in to have
tea and think at the same time, and
j THAT shows progress.
Not a Tragedy
The book is therefore not strictly a
tragedy, and no one who fears the
gruesome need keep away from it.
True, everything that Wolf has
touched, collapses, but then, we have

slept, eaten, and drunk with the man
for so long, that his bodily functions j
come to mean something sacred to j
us, and to symbolize an entire philo
sophy of keeping alive by using the
brains as little as possible.
Gerda, a peasant girl, is, according
to the author, beautiful, radiant, vo
luptuous, and youthful. To me, she is
the sentimental adolescent of the mo
tion pictures, a hideous thing with
curls down her back and a Pollyana
system of observation for which I
would slap her continually if I knew
her personally. Wolf likes her be
cause she tantalizes him. And she's a
woman. That means sex, and sex
means first exhiliration, then shame,
then philosophy, and then a two-vol
ume work entitled "Wolf Solent" by
John Cowper Powys.
It is impossible to say about what
else the book is written. I never found
out, and I read the volumes carefully
in pursuit of the principal problem,
which must be, other alternatives
eliminated, to prove that the nine
teetli century method of composing a
novel by throwing in bucolic scenes,
sexual problems, and countrified man
ners is dead and out of place in this
twentieth century.
Modern Mannerisms
A word might be spoken about the
mannerism modern novelists are em
ploying of terminating a book with a
chief character's selection of food or
drink. "The Wave" concluded with a
war-worn mother deciding to "buy a
glass of water." "The Unlit Lamp"
closes with a maniac's cry for his din
ner. In "Wolf Solent" the solution is
tea. A good suggestion for a stirring
finale is, "Waiter. I believe I'll take
that piece of oustard pie now."
There is something epical in
sweeping aside philosophical consider-
I ations of note, and calling attention
to the simple facts of life. Life —that's
what it all is—tea, and water, and
| beefsteaks, and such. Mr. Powys will
j touch our hearts yet, through our
stomachs.
Seriously, the book is obsolete al
ready. Powys thought about his novel
so much that he thought right out
j through it iuto an awful void, which
; is all that remains of what was prob
! ably intended to be a warm, colorful
i novel of human beings. The book ana
| lyzes beyond the limits of analysis;
it enters the realm of thoroughness
to the point of exhaustion. Profund
ity? Well, profound in the sense that
; it is just a hole, not even large, bor
' ing straight down into emptiness.
