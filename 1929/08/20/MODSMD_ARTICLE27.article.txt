# DR. VON DER LEYEN TRACES BACKGROUND OF OLD FAIRY TALES
## 
### 
"The Origin of Fairy Tales" and
"Some Aspects of Modern Spanish
Literature" were the subjects of talks
given by Dr. Frederich von der Leyen
and Dr. Damaso Alonso at the last
meeting of the Stanford Philological
Association, Thursday evening in the
Women's Clubhouse.
Using an old Egyptian epic as''an
illustration, von der Leyen, professor
of philology at the University of Co
logne, told of the first fairy tales.
These included accounts of travels,
enchantments, visits to other worlds,
and of cruel older brothers.
Tales 3000 Years Old
The tales, part of the Gilgamsh
epic, which dates from 3000 8.C., were
found at Ur, Babylonia, by American
scientists. Dr. von der Leyen also
read Egyptian fairy tales almost 3000
years old.
Dr. Amaso Alonso, professor of lan
guages, related in Spanish that Span
ish writers have recently taken a
great interest in the works of Gon
gora, a minor poet of the 17th cen
tury. As Gongora wrote primarily for
intellectual and restricted followers,
so are the modern Spanish authors
writing for this class of readers.
Gongora Praised
Realism and democracy, which have
existing in Spanish literature from its
beginning, are not the only character
istics of the literature today, accord
ing to Dr. Alonso. Dr. Alonso added
that Congora's works, like Dante's
should he read with the aid of com
mentaries to derive the full value
from them.
"Gongora, the great 17th century
Spanish poet whose literature is prob
ably the most difficult to understand
of any poet, has many admirers of all
periods since bis time as well as to
day. He represents idealism and aris
tocracy."

George N. Crocker, Law '28, has
been recommended to Attorney Gen
eral William D. Mitchell as his as
sistant by United States Attorney
George J. Hatfield in San Francisco.
