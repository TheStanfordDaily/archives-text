# PAULINE CODE SUBJECT OF DR. LESLIE LEARNED IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## Standards of Life Must Be Raised, Says Speaker In Sunday Sermon 
### 
The Pauline code of behavior was
the theme of Sunday's sermon given
in the Memorial Church by Reverend
Leslie Learned of Pasadena.
Uev. Learned declared that we are
involved in a conflict not only per
sonal, but world-wide, which will
either raise the world to a plane
nearer perfection, or lower it. He,
however, believes that we will raise
the level of life.
This is a life, Rev. Learned says,
which may be founded on a basis of
ancestral training, but we must help
to make this basis larger, more en
compassing, and higher.
Even though there are children to
day who are being allowed to do what
they will, and believe that to be
right, remarks Rev. Learned, there
still are and will be people who are
struggling to transfer instincts from
something physiological and animal
into something fine and uplifting.
Every time someone succeeds in mak
ing this transposition the world is im
proved.
Tins behavior and transposition
cannot be made unless one has a firm
belief in the power of God and Jesus
Christ, was Rev. Learned's thought.
This sermon was a prelude to next
Sunday's sermon on "Leaders."

The ruler of Khara Shar, Mongolia,
presented a model of a Buddhist tem
ple in wrought silver to the king of
Sweden. Twenty-six boxes will be
used to transport the valuable gift to
Stockholm.
