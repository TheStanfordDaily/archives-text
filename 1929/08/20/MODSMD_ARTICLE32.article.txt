# FALL PRACTICE LIST DISCLOSES LOSS OF ELEVEN LETTERMEN
## Frentrup, Rothert, Winnek, Preston, Muller Back; Heinecke Doubtful 
### 
When "Pop" Warner walks out on
the Stanford practice field Saturday
morning, September 16, to put his
Cardinal gridders through their first
workout he will find eleven lettermen
missing.
Thirteen lettermen, including four
regulars, will be present, and one
other first string player—Walter
Heinecke —may or may not lie in uni
form. He has been on the sick list
for several months and the doctors
have not as yet diagnosed the trouble.
Warner will find the greatest dif
ficulty in filling the gap in the center
of the line and at right half, as the
loss of Robesky and Sellman at guard
and the possible loss of Heinecke at
center will materially weaken the line
while Bob Sims' vacancy at right half
will be open for competition.
Lud Frentrup is expected to step
into Frank Wilton's place at left half.
Rothert and Winnek are the leading
contenders for the vacancy at right
half.
Pop has no worries about the end
positions as Captain "Mush" Muller
and Johnny Preston will be as strong
a pair of ends as will be found on the
coast.
