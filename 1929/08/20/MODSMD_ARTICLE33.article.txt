# WRONG NUMBER TO DISAPPEAR AS DIAL COMES TO CAMPUS
## 
### 
No longer will Stanford men
hopefully call P.A. 3100 when
they return next quarter.
Arguments with obliging tele
phone operators will be a thing
of the past.
For on September 15 a new
dial system will be inaugurated
on the Palo Alto exchange. No
present phone number will re
main unchanged.
Roble, 3100, will be 5171. The
University number will be
changed from 900 to 6161, The
Union, Toyon, Branner, and En
cina will be 3121; the Daily of
fice, 21624; the Board of Athletic
Control, 4181; and Associated
Students, 3308.
Consult the new phone book
for the other changes.
