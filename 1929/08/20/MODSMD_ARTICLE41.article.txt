# ENGLISH PROFESSOR WRITES TRANSLATION OF "DIVINE COMEDY"
## Work of Fifteenth Century Monks Exemplified in Binding, Printing 
### 
A counterfeit of the craft of the
15th century monks is embodied in
the binding and printing of the trans
lation of Dante's "Divine Comedy" by
Melville Best Anderson, professor
emeritus of English at Stanford, now
on exhibition in the library.

A marvel of modern printing and
binding, these vellum-bound works are
the product of John Henry Nash,
famed San Francisco printer. They
are direct imitations of the work done
in the European monasteries when
book binding was in its embryo of
development.

The edition is line-for-line transla
tion in rhyme of Dante's work involv
ing 28 years of study by the author.
Nash lauds Professor Anderson's work
as worthy of a printer's "magnum
opus" in the field of distinguished
printing and has produced the four
volumes as Nash's life achievement.

The volumes on exhibition are an
addition to the Albert N. Bender col
lection and were donated by Morgan
A. Gunst of San Francisco.
