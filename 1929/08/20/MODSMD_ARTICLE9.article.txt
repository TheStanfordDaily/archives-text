# Alonso Will Lecture In Little Theatre On New Spanish Poetry
## 
### 
"One of the most striking features
of the New Spain is that the young
literary generation is one of poets,"
says Professor Damaso Alonso, who
will lecture in Spanish tomorrow af
ternoon at 4:15 in the Little Theatre
on "Contemporary Spanish Poetry."
Professor Alonso will read and dis
cuss the works of some of the mod
ern Spanish poets who, in his opin
ion, are entitled to greater recogni
tion than they are now accorded.
There are two generations of poets
that follow the taste of Ruben Dario,
the Nicaraguan poet whose work has
had a great influence on Spanish liter
ature. Antonio Machado, born in
Seville, is a poet of Castilian gravity;
his poems are deep and intense.
Juan Ramon Jiminez is another An
dalusian, who represents the subtlety
and difficulty that are traditional in
part of Spanish poetry, as, for in
stance, in the works of Gongora, the
great poet of the 18th century.
After this generation there is a new
group of poets, such as Pedro Salinas,
Jorge Guillen, Federico Garcia Lorca,
Rafael Alberti, Vicente Aleixandre,
and Luis Cernuda.
