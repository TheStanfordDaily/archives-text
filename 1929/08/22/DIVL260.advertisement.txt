Character in Handwriting
The style of your handwriting—the size of the letters —the
way you cross your T's and dot your l's —may indicate your
character. However, the document to which you put your signa
ture reveals far more.
For example, your signature to a Life Insurance Trust Agree
ment which protects your insurance money, provides a regular
income for your family and extra money for emergencies—reveals
firmness, generosity, business judgment, and thoughtfulness for
those who come after you.
We have prepared an interesting booklet explaining how you
can use the Life Insurance Trust to protect your family. Ask at
any office for "The Life Insurance Trust—And Its Uses.''
