Souvenirs of the
Summer
You can not attend Stanford for even
a quarter without storing up a treasure
chest of pleasant memories.
Stanford's traditions and your own ex
periences here will be remembered for
years to come.
But how much nicer if you could have
a few tangible objects to link memory
with reality.
In the stores of Palo Alto you can find
all sorts of mementos, gifts, or Stanford
crested souvenirs, useful and orna
mental.
You can purchase them for as little as
a few cents or as high as you care to
go. The purchase price is not the in
dication of their value.
Soon, the article will have an intrinsic
value—because of the memories it
conjures—that will place it among the
dearest of all your possessions.
