# THE 						BULL SESSION
## PERPETUAL YOUTH 
### 
The campus grows. The constant
noise of construction, heard from one
end of the Farm to the other, is a
certain sign of progress in the vener
able young institution.
Over at the Union, workmen are
busily engaged in putting the Cellar
and the Roost together to form a
beauteous soda dispensary and cam
pus gathering-place. The Board of
.Athletic Control is building its plant
still closer to perfection. Three new
swisaming pools and an expansion in
locker rooms will be ready by Octo
ber. Construction is expected to be
completed next year on a University
golf course and a new varsity baseball
diamond.
The new Roble gym, for thirty-odd
years the goal of every Stanford wo
man, will in a few months begin to
take definite form. In San Francisco
an addition to the Stanford Hospital
will be ready before long, as will the
new Palo Alto Hospital, under the
administration of the University, on
the campus.
A definite drive is under way for
the new Stanford theatre. The result
of years of patient effort on the part
of the University Press may soon be
rewarded by a new shop building.
Completion of the Carnegie Labora
tory this month marks the most pre
tentious step so far in a new role for
Stanford —host to experimental sta
tions of scientific institutions.
Stanford, then, is a University which
realizes the value of growth. "Not to
grow," said President Wilbur, "is in
part to die." And these external, these
physical evidences of expansion are in
dicative of a progressive spirit among
the men who are guiding the Univer
sity. The Administration is truly
aspiring to keep Stanford young.
The University constantly needs
new men, young men to force to its
leadership, to fling their immature,
impractical ideas at the Administra
tion, to goad it from a path of indig
nant conservatism to one of produc
tive liberalism. These construction
projects under way throughout the
campus are in part signs of the ef
forts of these younger leaders.
Undergraduate opinion, youthful,
erratic, impossible as it may be, is
itself an adolescent representative on
the University's ruling body. As the
voice of a new generation, unsatisfied
with the conditions it finds, it must
be bridled but never suffocated.
It is good that Stanford is today
considered a young institution. When
it becomes old, nearing perfection,
then will it stop its physical and
spiritual growth, then will it lose its
enthusiasm, its ambition, its courage,
then will it turn to self-satisfaction, to
self-glorification—then it will die.
—Milton Silverman.
