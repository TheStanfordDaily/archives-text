# Wilbur On Vacation In North Sees Hoopa Indian Reservation
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, who
is now on a hunting and fishing trip in
the Sierra Nevada mountains with
J. P. Mitchell and several other friends,
will arrive in Salt Lake City for a
conference August 26-27 of the gov
ernors of the eleven western states
in an effort to gain effective co-opera
tion among these states in respect to
reclamation and other problems which
vitally affect them.
The call for the conference followed
on the heels of an announcement by
Secretary of the Interior Wilbur that
the time was ripe for the states to
consider taking over the surface
rights of the public domain.
This, coupled with what several of
the governors termed propaganda
from midwestern agricultural areas
against continued assistance to recla
mation projects, led to the belief that
united action was necessary to fore
stall such possibilities.
President Wilbur also plans to visit
the Hoopa Indian reservation on the
Klammath river while on his vacation
trip. His executive assistant, Nortli
cutt Ely, '24, is now r holding hearings
in San Francisco on the Hoopa sub
ject.
Mrs. Wilbur and Ray Lyman, Jr.,
left Monday to spend a few days at
Yosemite.
