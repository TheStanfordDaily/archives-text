# Departing Guests

### 
Stanford has been fortunate this summer in having as part of its
faculty professors from many parts of the world.
Following the custom carried on by Dr. Jordan in the early days of
the University, scholars known the world over have visited here this
summer. Specialists in their own fields, these men have brought their
ideas, their approaches, their methods, as a broadening influence into an
institution that might otherwise develop into a self-satisfied university,
intolerant of anything that does not conform completely to itself.
These professors present to Stanford a reflection of itself as it appears
to them. Stanford hopes that they are taking this reflection of its ideas,
approaches, and methods back to their universities, and are carrying its
influence to many parts of the world. ,
Stanford is keeping itself from being inbred. It is allowing itself the
freedom that has been set up by its founders as its ideal of university life.
