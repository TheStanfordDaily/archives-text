# CARDS BEGIN GRID SEASON AS DOUBTFUL COMPETITORS
## Heinecke's Return to Line Not Yet Certain; Eleven Lettermen Lost Nine Home Games Scheduled Climaxed by Army, U.C. Contests 
### 
A pitifully depleted football squad
will begin the season's workout on
September 16 with five days of prac
tice before the first scheduled game
with the West Coast Army. There will
be a hole through the center of the
line big enough for the military squad
to march through in parade formation.
The following Saturday the Cardinals
will probably be groping after the
winged heels of the powerful Olympic
Club aggregation. Oregon and Cali
fornia loom as sure stumbling blocks,
and only a lucky break will keep
U.S.C. from loitering in the shadows
of the Cardinal goal posts. In other
words Stanford's "daisy chain" has
wilted.
That's the summary of the popular
attitude on "Pop" Warner's chance to
revive a squad hit by the loss of letter
men and a possibility that Walt
Heinecke, promising center, will play
the games from the grandstand. And
that's the kind of attitude that may
make the 1929 Cardinal squad turn the
stadium into a one-way turf and gallop
through the conference a victorious
"dark horse."
Center Doubtful
Though rent by the loss of Rrtbesky
and Post, all-American guards, the
Cardinal line still promises to be a
tightly-sewed string of redshirts. With
Heinecke at center, in the event that
the M.D.'s will let him wear a uniform,
and with Pete Heiser at one guard
and the remaining one to be selected
from a group of strong contenders,
little trouble is feared from the center
of the line. It is possible that either
Marcellus Albertson or Perry Taylor
will be entrusted to the pivot position
if Heinecke fails to sign up.
The big problem facing "Pop" War
ner will be to replace Bob Sims at
right half. The list of contenders for
this job is headed by Phil Winnek and
Jlarlow Rothert, the latter having
been shifted from fullback. This sub
stitution, however, has them all guess
ing and will be a movement watched
by many a scrutinizing eye. Lud
Frentrup is marked to fill Frank Wil
ton's shoes as left halfback and will
probably be no cause for worry. Bob
Simkins will fall into "Biff" Hoffman's
fullback position without much argu
ment.
Nine Home Games
Stanford's success in the conference
will depend on the speed with which
the inexperienced men come along,
and the way the ends pull the receiv
ing act. With Johnny Preston and
Captain "Mush" Muller on the extremi
ties it appears that there will be little
trouble there. Besides being the best
pair of forward pass receiving men on
the coast, Preston and Muller are as
good a defensive duo as can be found.
From a campus standpoint Stanford
is facing its greatest season of foot
ball. All but two games are scheduled
l'or the home stadium with the West
Point game climaxing the season here
on December 28. The West Coast Army

game will open the season on Septein

ber 21, at 2:30 p.m., In tlie local sta
