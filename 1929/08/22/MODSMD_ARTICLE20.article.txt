The language tables, undertaken for the first time last year by the
summer quarter administration to arouse interest in conversational Span
ish and French, have proved such a success this summer, that plans for
the continuation and possible extension of the tables next summer are
under way.
Conversation has been conducted entirely in Spanish or French. Fines
have been imposed on those unfortunates who have unthinkingly slipped
in a word of English. The groups have sung songs and given entertain
ments at the tables, and have presented plays to the public wholly in
Spanish and French.
In acting as a supplement to academic work in the classroom, the
language tables have provided an opportunity for those who are interested
in the spoken languages to carry 011 their study further. They have
afforded a means for other university students, not enrolled in regular
work in the romanic language department, to learn to speak these
languages.
The considerable increase in the enrollment in this department this
summer over last, however, is believed to be due. at least in part, to the
influence of the language tables. We are looking forward to next year's
language tables to be an interesting part of the summer activities.
