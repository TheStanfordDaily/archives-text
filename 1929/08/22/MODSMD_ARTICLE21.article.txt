# And The Quarter Ends—
## 
### 
An enjoyable summer quarter is nearly at its end. Today the last
Daily is off the press and the slaves of the staff will throw their type
writers out of the window, getting on good terms with their textbooks
and reference lists. Finals are just around the corner.
All honor to them. From the lowest cub to the most autocratic asso
ciate editor they have mastered the Daily's combination of red tape and
folderol, of proof sheets and deadline, and come out unscathed. Milton
Silverman, he of the anarchist mien, and Burnell Gould, he of the
Menckenist trend, as the first two editors, put the paper well on its way
to editorial success. Optimistic Lincoln Hobson put it on a sound
financial standing. And the associate editors—Earl Harris, who now
angles for the wily trout; solemn Ellis Gait ; and youthful Francis Wyatt,
who tries so hard to be serious, have all won a place in the editorial heart.
It has been a pleasant session, this summer, and much credit is due
Dean Sellards and his office. There has been a colorful dramatic season,
maintaining the high standards set by its predecessors. A score of lec
turers, not all of them world figures, but well above the average, spoke to
receptive campus audiences. The Hillsborough symphony concerts were
made available to Stanford students, and such artists as Marcus Gordon
and Henri Deering were brought to their very Assembly Hall.
Conventions, with their attendant open meetings, were attractive fea
tures of the quarter. The horse show, held on campus grounds for the
benefit of the Stanford Convalescent Home, became a popular place of
entertainment. Dances and receptions were arranged, and numerous auto
excursions. Tennis and handball tournaments found their place in the
athletic program.
But it's been a quiet summer—too quiet from the standpoint of news.
There was no presidential nominee staying on the campus and no notifica
tion ceremony; no Stanford stars competing in the Olympic Games, and
no baseball tossers cavorting in the islands of the Pacific.
A record-breaking enrollment, well over fourteen hundred, will alone
testify to the success of the 1929 session.
lint the real test of its popularity cannot come until next June, when
the criterion of enrollment will come into play. Those who are at
Stanford now will spread afar their frank opinion of a summer spent
011 the campus. Their views will either build the registration for the next
summer closer to three thousand, or limit it to one. And we, expressing
our opinion now, look confidently to its climbing toward the three thou
sand mark.
Members of the Stanford Daily staff will meet at Brookdale Lodge,
in the Santa Cruz mountains, for their quarterly banquet at 6:30 Satur
day night.

lint the real test of its popularity cannot come until next June, when
the criterion of enrollment will come into play. Those who are at
Stanford now will spread afar their frank opinion of a summer spent
011 the campus. Their views will either build the registration for the next
summer closer to three thousand, or limit it to one. And we, expressing
our opinion now, look confidently to its climbing toward the three thou
sand mark.
Members of the Stanford Daily staff will meet at Brookdale Lodge,
in the Santa Cruz mountains, for their quarterly banquet at 6:30 Satur
day night.
An enjoyable summer quarter is nearly at its end. Today the last
Daily is off the press and the slaves of the staff will throw their type
writers out of the window, getting on good terms with their textbooks
and reference lists. Finals are just around the corner.
All honor to them. From the lowest cub to the most autocratic asso
ciate editor they have mastered the Daily's combination of red tape and
folderol, of proof sheets and deadline, and come out unscathed. Milton
Silverman, he of the anarchist mien, and Burnell Gould, he of the
Menckenist trend, as the first two editors, put the paper well on its way
to editorial success. Optimistic Lincoln Hobson put it on a sound
financial standing. And the associate editors—Earl Harris, who now
angles for the wily trout; solemn Ellis Gait ; and youthful Francis Wyatt,
who tries so hard to be serious, have all won a place in the editorial heart.
It has been a pleasant session, this summer, and much credit is due
Dean Sellards and his office. There has been a colorful dramatic season,
maintaining the high standards set by its predecessors. A score of lec
turers, not all of them world figures, but well above the average, spoke to
receptive campus audiences. The Hillsborough symphony concerts were
made available to Stanford students, and such artists as Marcus Gordon
and Henri Deering were brought to their very Assembly Hall.
Conventions, with their attendant open meetings, were attractive fea
tures of the quarter. The horse show, held on campus grounds for the
benefit of the Stanford Convalescent Home, became a popular place of
entertainment. Dances and receptions were arranged, and numerous auto
excursions. Tennis and handball tournaments found their place in the
athletic program.
But it's been a quiet summer—too quiet from the standpoint of news.
There was no presidential nominee staying on the campus and no notifica
tion ceremony; no Stanford stars competing in the Olympic Games, and
no baseball tossers cavorting in the islands of the Pacific.
