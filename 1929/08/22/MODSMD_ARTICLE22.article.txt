New disclosures in the remodeling
of the Cellar, habitual hang-out of
Stanford students, have been revealed
as plans for renovation have been al
tered for the last time.
Rapidly on its way to completion,
the Cellar has now taken definite
form. A spacious eating room with a
counter that will seat forty persons,
a large kitchen, a roomy lounge and
smoking room in which the rough√ü
may throw the proverbial bull, are the
main features of the improvement.
Two-tone Tile Used
Another room is being finished adja
cent to the barber shop which will
either be made into an office for the
Associated Students or into a Univer
sity store. ,
The counter is in the form of a rec
tangle with booths and tables around
three corners of it. The booths will
accommodate one hundred people.
The lower half of the walls of the
Cellar will be inlaid two-tone tile. The
floor and stairs leading from the eat
ing-room to the lounge and the barber
shop will also be of tile. Decorative
tile blocks will be inlaid in the steps.
Easy Chairs Provided
To add to this convenience there
will be two complete toasting and
sandwich making units, two hot plates
for cooking short orders when the
kitchen is closed, two steam tables,
two refrigerator tables, and two ice
water units.
One of the features of the lounging
room will be the installation of easy
chairs and smoking tables. News
papers and periodicals will be pro
vided.
