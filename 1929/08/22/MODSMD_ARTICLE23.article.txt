# Bleachers Enclose Varsity, Class Pools; Grass On Golf Greens
## 
### 
Summer construction work is being
pushed forward as rapidly as possible.
Excavation of the class swimming
pool and diving pool is almost com
pleted and levels have been taken for
the foundation of the new locker and
shower annex. The new annex wjll be
built over the old swimming pool
which has been filled with excavated
earth.
The class pool will have a level
floor 4 feet 10 inches deep throughout
and will be used only for beginning
classes.
Pool Tested
The two iron filter tanks are in
place and will be working in a few
days.
The varsity pool is filled for testing
purposes and the entire construction
has a very business-like appearance.
Carpenters are swarming over the
new bleachers which will line the west
and south sides of the enclosure. These
new stands will seat approximately
2500 spectators, none of whom will
be forced to look into the sun while
watching meets, as was the case in
previous years.
Grass on Greens
The grass is up on several of the
new greens on the golf course and
an 18-inch pipe line is being laid to
supply water for the course. The water
is piped from Felt lake which is being
dammed for that purpose. The founda
tion for the dam has been laid and
rolled. Its spillway will be at one side
of the lake rather than over the dam.
This will eliminate the danger of the
earthen dam washing out.
