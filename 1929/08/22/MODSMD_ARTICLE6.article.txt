### 
How David Starr Jordan and eighty
five Greek youths of high school age
are helping to stamp out the scourge
of malaria in modern Greece is told
by Eliot G. Mears, of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, in his
new book, "Greece Today," to be pub
lished this autumn by Stanford Uni
versity Press.
Particularly in Macedonia malaria
has been, and still is, one of the most
pernicious diseases afflicting the
Greeks, and the influx of a million and
a half refugees from Turkey gave the
disease a fresh impetus, Professor
Mears explains.

Boys of the American Farm School
at Salonika, founded in 1904, have been
active in fighting the sickness. At the
suggestion of Dr. Jordan they have
planted millions of "Gambusia affinis,"
the fish that eat mosquito larvae, in
watering places that cannot be oiled
or drained. They have also oiled the
breeding-places of mosquitoes wher
ever possible.
