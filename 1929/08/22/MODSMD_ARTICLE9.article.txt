# Belgian-American College Students Contrasted By Professor Michotte In Lecture On Louvain University
## Youth of Belgium Favors Industrial, Commercial Institutions; 10,000 Registered in Universities,8 00 Co-eds; Automobiles Unknown on Campuses 
### 
Only 800 women college students, on'iy one examination a year, and students
do not drive automobiles —in Belgium.
Other striking and significant differences between Belgian and American,
colleges were presented at the Tuesday evening lecture by Professor Albert
Eduard Michotte in the Little Theatre on the subject of "The University of
Louvain, Past and Present." Louvain is the largest of the four universities
in Belgium. The student population of Belgium is about 10,000, or one out of
every 750 inhabitants. The reason for this relatively low percentage, said

1 Professor Michotte, is that most young
people of Belgium enter industrial and
commercial schools.
Organization of studies at Louvain
is vastly different from that in Ameri
can colleges. The Belgian colleges of
fer a choice of lecture courses, all
fixed by law, and leading to academic
degrees. The system is very rigid, and
the student has no choice. Each de
gree in the university corresponds to
a known course of studies. The one
examination, which is oral, comes at
the end of the course, covering all the
completed work.
Two Languages Used
At Louvain, education is further
complicated by the necessity of teach
ing all courses in both French and
Flemish. Professors give each lecture
twice, once in each language.
Student life in Belgium differs
widely from American college life,
said Dr. Michotte. All the students
wear caps, the color of which indi
cates the part of the country from
which they come. On the caps are
badges which denote the subjects the
student is taking, and how many ex
aminations he has passed.
Students Walk
"Since the students at Louvain." ex
plained Dr. Michotte, "do not have
automobiles, and since the various
colleges, thirty-nine in all, are located
in various parts of the city, a great
deal of walking is necessitated. The
students enjoy this, however, and one
of their principle pleasures is taking
long walks in the woods. The principle
sports at Louvain are tennis and foot
ball."
Few Dormitories
Like the university students of the
Middle Ages, the students of Louvain
are constantly at loggerheads with the
townspeople, whom they consider
their inferiors. This leads to much
difficulty.
The majority of the students live in
rooms rented in the town, and they
take their meals in the public restau
rants. There are very few dormitories.
There are no self-supporting stu
dents in Belgian colleges, said Dr.
Michotte. He explained that there was
a great deal of social life among the
students, and many student associa-
I tions which take up most of the time
available from studies.
Louvain is a Catholic college but,
according to Professor Michotte, "the
attitude toward science is exactly like
that of any other non-denominational
college." This attitude was expressed,
he said, by Cardinal Mercier, a gradu
ate of Louvain, who said, "Science
must be cultivated for its own sake."
Professor Michotte illustrated his
talk with a large number of slides,
which gave the audience a clear con
cept of the architectural beauties and

remarkable landscape effects at Lou- I
vain.
I
At the conclusion of his lecture Pro
fessor Michotte paid a generous trib
ute to President Hoover. He said that ]
all Belgium was deeply grateful for
Hoover's assistance during the war,
and that Hoover had helped Louvain
materially in securing donations with- j
out which it would have been impos
sible to repair the damages suffered
in 1914.
Professor Michotte left Stanford im
mediately for New York, where he
will sail shortly for Europe.

Only 800 women college students, on'iy one examination a year, and students
do not drive automobiles —in Belgium.
Other striking and significant differences between Belgian and American,
colleges were presented at the Tuesday evening lecture by Professor Albert
Eduard Michotte in the Little Theatre on the subject of "The University of
Louvain, Past and Present." Louvain is the largest of the four universities
in Belgium. The student population of Belgium is about 10,000, or one out of
every 750 inhabitants. The reason for this relatively low percentage, said

1 Professor Michotte, is that most young
people of Belgium enter industrial and
commercial schools.
Organization of studies at Louvain
is vastly different from that in Ameri
can colleges. The Belgian colleges of
fer a choice of lecture courses, all
fixed by law, and leading to academic
degrees. The system is very rigid, and
the student has no choice. Each de
gree in the university corresponds to
a known course of studies. The one
examination, which is oral, comes at
the end of the course, covering all the
completed work.
Two Languages Used
At Louvain, education is further
complicated by the necessity of teach
ing all courses in both French and
Flemish. Professors give each lecture
twice, once in each language.
Student life in Belgium differs
widely from American college life,
said Dr. Michotte. All the students
wear caps, the color of which indi
cates the part of the country from
which they come. On the caps are
badges which denote the subjects the
student is taking, and how many ex
aminations he has passed.
Students Walk
"Since the students at Louvain." ex
plained Dr. Michotte, "do not have
automobiles, and since the various
colleges, thirty-nine in all, are located
in various parts of the city, a great
deal of walking is necessitated. The
students enjoy this, however, and one
of their principle pleasures is taking
long walks in the woods. The principle
sports at Louvain are tennis and foot
ball."
Few Dormitories
Like the university students of the
Middle Ages, the students of Louvain
are constantly at loggerheads with the
townspeople, whom they consider
their inferiors. This leads to much
difficulty.
The majority of the students live in
rooms rented in the town, and they
take their meals in the public restau
rants. There are very few dormitories.
There are no self-supporting stu
dents in Belgian colleges, said Dr.
Michotte. He explained that there was
a great deal of social life among the
students, and many student associa-
I tions which take up most of the time
available from studies.
Louvain is a Catholic college but,
according to Professor Michotte, "the
attitude toward science is exactly like
that of any other non-denominational
college." This attitude was expressed,
he said, by Cardinal Mercier, a gradu
ate of Louvain, who said, "Science
must be cultivated for its own sake."
Professor Michotte illustrated his
talk with a large number of slides,
which gave the audience a clear con
cept of the architectural beauties and

remarkable landscape effects at Lou- I
vain.

At the conclusion of his lecture Pro
fessor Michotte paid a generous trib
ute to President Hoover. He said that ]
all Belgium was deeply grateful for
Hoover's assistance during the war,
and that Hoover had helped Louvain
materially in securing donations with- j
out which it would have been impos
sible to repair the damages suffered
