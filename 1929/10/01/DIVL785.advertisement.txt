You can tell a
Stanford man by
the way he walks
That air of nonchalance and swagger is
partly because he's a Stanford man, and
partly because he's wearing Nettleton
shoes. Fortunately, our shoe stock is
twice as large as it was last year, so
there'll be enough Nettletons, Miller
Cooks, and Barclays to go around. Our

NETTLETON SHOES $15 to $18
MILLER COOK SHOES, All Styles... $10
BARCLAY SHOES $7.50 to $9
