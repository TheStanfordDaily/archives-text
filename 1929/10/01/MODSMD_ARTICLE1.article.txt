# TEXAS GOVERNOR ORDERS MARTIAL RULE IN BORGER
## National Guardsmen Assume All Police Duties; Probe by State Officials Launched Troops Will Remain in County Until All Lawlessness Is Eliminated, Says Governor 
### 
BORGER, Texas, Sept. 30 (JP). â€”Un-
der somber skies, martial law rode into
Borger today on a seven-car troop train
from Fort Worth, carrying 84 Texas
National Guardsmen. Thus climaxed the
state's investigation in the assassination
of District Attorney John Holmes here
September 13.
Its mayor free under bond on a crimi
nal charge and the entire county moving
under the shadow of impending military
rule, this tense oil town prepared today
to accustom itself to a radically new
order of things.
The governor had announced previous
ly that he would not release the procla
mation suspending civil rule until troops
who will supplant the civil authorities
were in possession of the town.
The arrival of the troops almost was
overshadowed by interest in the sched
uled preliminary hearing of Mayor Glenn
A. Pace on a charge, filed yesterday by
Texas Rangers, that he "caused" a state
witness in one of Borger's two-score un
solved murder cases of the last two years
to leave town.
The mayor's arrest was the first result,
other than the movement of troops, of
investigations by Rangers and represent
atives of the governor, sent here to hunt
the assassin of District Attorney John A.
Holmes, that they had evidence impli
cating citty and county officers in a
criminal conspiracy.
State troops will remain in Borger
and Hutchinson County until that area
is cleared of all lawlessness or until
they are removed by Governor Moody's
successor in office, the governor declared
today in announcing that the martial law
proclamation was issued Saturday, effec
tive Sunday at 3 p.m.
The first duty of the troops was to go
to the city hall and disarm all civil
authorities. The first man arrested was
Clint Mclholland, policeman, who was
held for investigation.
General Wolters established his head
quarters at the city hall building, which
also houses the city jail and a fire sta
tion. Shortly after the troops took over
the scat of the city government, Con
stable Sam Jones arrived and a pair of
brass knuckles was taken from him.
Ranger M. B. Gault then accompanied
the constable from the city hall to get
his guns.
The occupation of Borger was ac
complished quietly and quickly. There
were no demonstrations, although hun
dreds of curious persons tramped about,
following the moving center of activities.
They gathered at the depot, at the police
station, and then at the American Legion
hall, which is to barrack the Guardsmen.
Guards were stationed at vantage points
and patrolled the streets.
