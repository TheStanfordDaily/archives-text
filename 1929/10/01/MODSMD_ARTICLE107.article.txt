# DECISION BY SENATE NEARER AT START OF 4TH WEEK'S DEBATE
## Continuation of President's Tariff Rate's Powers Is Bone of Contention 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. (/P)â€” I The
Senate entered the fourth week of
tariff debate today with its first major
controversy on the verge of a deci
sion.
The iasue, whether the President's
powor to raise or lower tariff rates
upon recommendation of the Tariff
Commission shall be continued or
withdrawn, probably will reach a vote
tomorrow or Wednesday.
On the one side, in favor of con
tinuance, are ranged President Hoover
and the Republican Regulars of the
Senate. On the other, are most of the
Democrats and Republican Independ
ents.
Leaders of both sides, after a week
end of vigorous efforts to bolster the
voting strength of their respective
positions, professed confidence in the
outcome. They conceded, however,
that a single vote might decide the
issue.
