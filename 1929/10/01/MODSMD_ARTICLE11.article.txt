# TROPICAL STORM NEARING FLORIDA ALABAMA COAST
## Rescue Craft Speed to Aid Wreck Victims Left by Bahaman Hurricane 
### 
JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Sept. 30. (JP)
—Northwest Florida and the tiny strip
of Alabama coast on the Gulf of
Mexico prepared today for the advent
of the tropical storm which swept
northwestward after rounding the
Florida peninsula from the Bahamas
Islands.
Predictions from the government
weather bureau that the storm would
strike with hurricane intensity some
where between Apalachicola, Fla., and
the Mississippi coast, caused the popu
lace to take precautions against pos
sible danger.
Rising winds ancf falling barome
ters were noted along the shore line
from Apalachicola to Pensacola and
communications were disrupted into
the Apalachicola area. Unofficial esti
mates said a 40-mile wind was blow
ing, with occasional rain squalls.
Meanwhile, distressed shipping, left
in the wake of the Bahaman hurri
cane, held a prominent place in the
spotlight, with rescue craft speeding
through the stormy Atlartic. Their
destinations were the Italian steamer
Salina aground off Manzanillo Reef,
the Danish steamer Scandia, a wreck
off the Bahamas, and the British
freighter Domira, which ran aground
off Great Abaco last Tuesday.
Wireless messages related the res
cue of 28 men from the steamship
Wisconsin Bridge near Great Abaco
and said that 112i ,r e men had been taken
from the Scanoia before rough water
compelled a halt until daylight.
NASSAU, Bahamas, Sept. 30. (/p) —
(By Radio) —Broken in two by the
hurricane, the British tanker Poto
mac, with a full fuel cargo, foundered
off northeast Andros Island Thursday
but her crew was saved. The mate
of the Potomac arrived here by boat
this morning. The crew is safely
ashore at Andros, he said.
MIAMI, Fla., Sept. 30. (/P) —Prop-
erty damage and loss of life at Nas
sau, Bahama Islands, from the tropi
cal hurricane that struck there last
week, was not as severe as was first
estimated, although it was heavy in
isolated cases, according to a wire
less despatch received here today
from the Bahamian capital to the
Miami Daily News.
The message said only six deaths
occurred in Nassau and that no loss
of life in the other islands of the
group had been reported. Previous
dispatches from Nassau placed the
estimated dead at 20.
Most of the loss of life was in the
negro settlement, the despatch said.
Thoroughfares have been cleared
of debn's and electric and water ser
vices re-established.
All radio stations in the Bahamian
group, with the exception of Andros,
have been heard from and none re
ported severe damage.
