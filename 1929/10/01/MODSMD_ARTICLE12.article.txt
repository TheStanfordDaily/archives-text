# FIRST TRANSLATION OF EYE DISEASE BOOK TO BE PUBLISHED HERE
## 
### 
The first English translation of "De
Oculis," the first printed book on the
eye and its diseases, will be published
this autumn by the Stanford Press.
Beneventus of Jerusalem, eye sur
geon of the tenth century, was the
author of "De Oculis," which for five
hundred years was the most popular
ophthalmic manual of the Middle
Ages. The translation, by Casey A.
Wood, M.D., LL.D., is from the Fer
rara incunable, printed in 1474.
The author, described as a "very
famous and expert surgeon," speaks
of Ophthalmology as a new science
and gives explicit directions for the
treatment of various ocular afflictions
and injuries. He recommends the use
of gold instruments, since the gold
"especially clarifies objects with
which it comes in contact because of
its inherent power over cold and
dampness"—a belief based on astro
logy. The book is illustrated by repro
ductions of pages from the original
Ferrara incwiablo.
