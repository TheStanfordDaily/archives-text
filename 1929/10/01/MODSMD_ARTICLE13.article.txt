the greater part of the 600-mile flight,
the Russian plane "Land of the Soviets"

from Seward. A cheering throng greet

soviet aviators flying the monoplane
"Land of the Soviets" from Moscow to
New York.
The aviators rested after the flight yes

They planned to take off tomorrow or
Wednesday for Seattle, but late today
