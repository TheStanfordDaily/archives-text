WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 30 (JP).
â€”The contention that the two objectives
of those Filipinos seeking independence
and the right to send sugar and other
products to the United States free of
duty were not compatible was made in
the Senate today by Senator Broussard,
Democrat, of Louisiana.
"We must either turn the Filipinos
loose or confront a most dangerous com
petition from their imports to the detri
ment of American producers," he said.
The Louisiana senator has pending two
amendments to the tariff bill, one provid
ing for the application of American tar
iffs to all Philippine imports and the re
turn of the revenue derived therefrom to
the Philippine government as long as in
dependence is denied the islands.
The other amendment would authorize
the President to invite Great Britain,
France, Italy, and Japan to a conference
charged with the duty of guaranteeing
the independence of the islands.
