WASHINGTON, D.C., Sept. 30 tfP).
—State Department worries about who is
going to take whom in to the state din
tier at the White House in honor of
Prime Minister Mac Donald—and who is
going to sit where—were dispelled today
by Vice-President Curits waiving his so
cial precedence right to be next to Mrs.
Hoover 011 that occasion.
As a result, the distinguished guest
from England will escort the President's
wife into the dining room and converse
with her from the chair at the right
while the various courses are being
served.
