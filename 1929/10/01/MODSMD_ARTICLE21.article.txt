### 
HII.O, Hawaii, Sept. 30 (/P).—Having:
experienced more than 200 earthquakes
in a week, the populace of the western
part of the island of Hawaii today
awaited with some apprehension the com
ing of more temblors and the eruption of
its volcanoes as predicted by Dr. Thomas
A. Jaggar, volcanologist.
A series of quakes ending at eight
o'clock yesterday morning was followed
by Dr. Jaggar's latest prediction. The
volcanologist asserted that western Ha
waii probably would be visited by shocks
more severe than those of the last week
but that they doubtless would come at
longer intervals than those already felt.
Twenty-five shocks were felt in the se
ries ending this morning.
