# CARDS TO OPEN P.C.C. SCHEDULE AGAINST OREGON
## Wins Over Army, Winged '0' Teams Prepare Stanford For Northern Invaders Warner Working Charges on Passing Attack; Power of Backfield Pleases Coach 
### 
With two practice games already
tucked safely away in its bag of vic
tories, a 45 to 0 win from the West
Coast Army and a close 6 to 0 upset
over the Olympic Club, Stanford's big
football varsity settled down to seri
ous practice yesterday afternoon Id.
preparation for the opening of the
conference season against the Uni
versity of Oregon on Saturday.
Although the Cards displayed plenty
of power against both the Army and
Club teams, Coach "Pop" Warner has
his hands full this week in ironing
out several shaky spots before the
Oregon invasion.
Protection for the passers and kick
ers and some sloppy open field tack
ling in the Club contest were especial
ly displeasing to the Old Fox. One
punt was actually blocked, several
passes were smeared behind the line,
and tricky Morton Kaer shook off
tacklers right and left in returning
punts for a total of 110 yards.
Long Injury List
Stanford has also received its share
of early-season injuries to date.
Johnny Preston, veteran left end, in
jured a knee last Saturday and will
be unable to see action in the Oregon
game, according to the team physi
cians. Kay Albertson, one of the best
end prospects on the squad, who was
hurt in the Army game, is not yet in
shape to play. Fleishhacker and Sim
kins are on the hospital list, but
either or both of them may get into
the struggle Saturday.
The passing attack was not too
good against the Olympic team, this
being largely due to the fact that
Simkins was out of the line-up. Big
Chuck Smalling and smashing Harry
Hillman did most of the passing last
week, but neither showed up to any
great advantage—even though the
lone touchdown of the day resulted
from a pass, Smalling to Rothert.
"Pop" will probably work his full
backs overtime tossing the pigskin
around within the next few days.
Showing Encouraging
Yet aside from these flaws, the var
sity looks better than it did at this
time last year. For one thing, it seems
to have shaken off its old habit of
fumbling the ball on about every
other play. The Stanford backs hand
died the ball to perfection on reverse,
plays, and were out-fumbled by both
the Army and Club outfits.
One thing that greatly please.i
Coach Warner was the great sinas
ing power and tight oefense shov
by his giant backfield, composed
Fleishhacker, Smalling,, Rothert, and
Frentrup. This quaret, which started
both games, packed plenty of punch.
And it is no wonder, as it averages
around 200 pounds, and is one of the
heaviest backfields in the country.
