# CARDS TO OPEN P.C.C. SCHEDULE AGAINST OREGON
## Wins Over Army, Winged '0' Teams Prepare Stanford For Northern Invaders Warner Working Charges on Passing Attack; Power of Backfield Pleases Coach 
### 
With two practice games already
tucked safely away in its bag of vic
tories, a 45 to 0 win from the West
Coast Army and a close 6 to 0 upset
over the Olympic Club, Stanford's big
football varsity settled down to seri
ous practice yesterday afternoon Id.
preparation for the opening of the
conference season against the Uni
versity of Oregon on Saturday.
Although the Cards displayed plenty
of power against both the Army and
Club teams, Coach "Pop" Warner has
his hands full this week in ironing
out several shaky spots before the
Oregon invasion.
Protection for the passers and kick
ers and some sloppy open field tack
ling in the Club contest were especial
ly displeasing to the Old Fox. One
punt was actually blocked, several
passes were smeared behind the line,
and tricky Morton Kaer shook off
tacklers right and left in returning
punts for a total of 110 yards.
Long Injury List
Stanford has also received its share
of early-season injuries to date.
Johnny Preston, veteran left end, in
jured a knee last Saturday and will
be unable to see action in the Oregon
game, according to the team physi
cians. Kay Albertson, one of the best
end prospects on the squad, who was
hurt in the Army game, is not yet in
shape to play. Fleishhacker and Sim
kins are on the hospital list, but
either or both of them may get into
the struggle Saturday.
The passing attack was not too
good against the Olympic team, this
being largely due to the fact that
Simkins was out of the line-up. Big
Chuck Smalling and smashing Harry
Hillman did most of the passing last
week, but neither showed up to any
great advantage—even though the
lone touchdown of the day resulted
from a pass, Smalling to Rothert.
"Pop" will probably work his full
backs overtime tossing the pigskin
around within the next few days.
Showing Encouraging
Yet aside from these flaws, the var
sity looks better than it did at this
time last year. For one thing, it seems
to have shaken off its old habit of
fumbling the ball on about every
other play. The Stanford backs hand
died the ball to perfection on reverse,
plays, and were out-fumbled by both
the Army and Club outfits.
One thing that greatly please.i
Coach Warner was the great sinas
ing power and tight oefense shov
by his giant backfield, composed
Fleishhacker, Smalling,, Rothert, and
Frentrup. This quaret, which started
both games, packed plenty of punch.
And it is no wonder, as it averages
around 200 pounds, and is one of the
heaviest backfields in the country.
Neill, Hillman Good
The work of Ilarry Hillman and
Phil Neill, a couple of juniors with
two more years of varsity competition
apiece, has attracted considerable at
tention. Hillman, one of the hardest
charging backs on the squad, aver
aged more than five yards in plug
ging holes through the strong Olym
pic line.
Neill showed to such good advan
tage against the Club that yesterday
"Pop" announced that the blond lad
would be in the starting line-up
against Oregon. If Neill plays a bang
up game again this Saturday, Preston
may And it hard going to regain his
place on the first string. At any rate
Stanford is not going to be weak at
the wings this year, with Captain
Muller, whose playing stood out in
the Club encounter, Dick Worden, Kay
Albertson, Bullet Bush, Preston, and
Neill fighting it out for positions on
the team.
Line Shows Strength
The rest of the line demonstrated
that it is going to be plenty tough to
crack. Walt Heinecke looks as good
or better than last year, and Perry
Taylor, his understudy at center,
played good ball during the Olympic
Club game. Pete Heiser, Bull Dricoll,
Ham Wilson, and Ray Dawson proved
their worth at guard, while Ray
Tandy, Tiny Artman, Red Thompson,
and Dick Bogue look hard to beat at
tackle.
Harlow Rothert played the best
game of his career against the Club,
and is rapidly developing into one of
the outstanding backs on the squad.
Hit punting was good Saturday, he
knocked down a lot of passes on de
fense, and he reeled off some nice
gains through the line. Another player
who will see a lot of action before
the year is over is Phil Moffatt. With
a little more experience, he should
turn into one of the sweetest safety
men this Pacific Coast has ever seen.
Oregon Dangerous
This Oregon game, by the way, is
going to be a hectic battle from be
ginning to end. Last year Stanford
was hard-pressed to down the north
ern team by a fourteen-point margin
And last year their team was made
up of sophomores. But on Saturday a
veteran bunch of players will face
the Cards at the opening kickoff.
While the varsity was playing the
Olympic Club, Chuck Winterburn,
who assists Pop in coaching the back
field, was up North scouting the Ore
gon-Pacific game. What he saw of the
Oregon team was plenty. It trounced
the Pacific team by a score of 58 to 0,
and Pacific was no "push over." Win

terburn reports that Oregon has a
heavy, fast charging squad and pos
sesses a strong offense, quite similar
to Warner's "B" formation.
It is hard at this time to speculate
on Saturday's starting lineup, al
though the line will probably be the
same as that which opened against
the Club, with the exception of Phil
Neill at left end. According to "Pop,"
the squad Is likely to be cut down
either today or tomorrow to about five
full teams or fifty-five men.

tage against the Club that yesterday
"Pop" announced that the blond lad
would be in the starting line-up
against Oregon. If Neill plays a bang
up game again this Saturday, Preston
may And it hard going to regain his
place on the first string. At any rate
Stanford is not going to be weak at
the wings this year, with Captain
Muller, whose playing stood out in
the Club encounter, Dick Worden, Kay
Albertson, Bullet Bush, Preston, and
Neill fighting it out for positions on
the team.
Line Shows Strength
The rest of the line demonstrated
that it is going to be plenty tough to
crack. Walt Heinecke looks as good
or better than last year, and Perry
Taylor, his understudy at center,
played good ball during the Olympic
Club game. Pete Heiser, Bull Dricoll,
Ham Wilson, and Ray Dawson proved
their worth at guard, while Ray
Tandy, Tiny Artman, Red Thompson,
and Dick Bogue look hard to beat at
tackle.
Harlow Rothert played the best
game of his career against the Club,
and is rapidly developing into one of
the outstanding backs on the squad.
Hit punting was good Saturday, he
knocked down a lot of passes on de
fense, and he reeled off some nice
gains through the line. Another player
who will see a lot of action before
the year is over is Phil Moffatt. With
a little more experience, he should
turn into one of the sweetest safety
men this Pacific Coast has ever seen.
Oregon Dangerous
This Oregon game, by the way, is
going to be a hectic battle from be
ginning to end. Last year Stanford
was hard-pressed to down the north
ern team by a fourteen-point margin
And last year their team was made
up of sophomores. But on Saturday a
veteran bunch of players will face
the Cards at the opening kickoff.
While the varsity was playing the
Olympic Club, Chuck Winterburn,
who assists Pop in coaching the back
field, was up North scouting the Ore
gon-Pacific game. What he saw of the
Oregon team was plenty. It trounced
the Pacific team by a score of 58 to 0,
and Pacific was no "push over." Win

terburn reports that Oregon has a
heavy, fast charging squad and pos
sesses a strong offense, quite similar
to Warner's "B" formation.
It is hard at this time to speculate
on Saturday's starting lineup, al
though the line will probably be the
same as that which opened against
the Club, with the exception of Phil
Neill at left end. According to "Pop,"
the squad Is likely to be cut down
either today or tomorrow to about five
full teams or fifty-five men.
With two practice games already
tucked safely away in its bag of vic
tories, a 45 to 0 win from the West
Coast Army and a close 6 to 0 upset
over the Olympic Club, Stanford's big
football varsity settled down to seri
ous practice yesterday afternoon Id.
preparation for the opening of the
conference season against the Uni
versity of Oregon on Saturday.
Although the Cards displayed plenty
of power against both the Army and
Club teams, Coach "Pop" Warner has
his hands full this week in ironing
out several shaky spots before the
Oregon invasion.
Protection for the passers and kick
ers and some sloppy open field tack
ling in the Club contest were especial
ly displeasing to the Old Fox. One
punt was actually blocked, several
passes were smeared behind the line,
and tricky Morton Kaer shook off
tacklers right and left in returning
punts for a total of 110 yards.
Long Injury List
Stanford has also received its share
of early-season injuries to date.
Johnny Preston, veteran left end, in
jured a knee last Saturday and will
be unable to see action in the Oregon
game, according to the team physi
cians. Kay Albertson, one of the best
end prospects on the squad, who was
hurt in the Army game, is not yet in
shape to play. Fleishhacker and Sim
kins are on the hospital list, but
either or both of them may get into
the struggle Saturday.
The passing attack was not too
good against the Olympic team, this
being largely due to the fact that
Simkins was out of the line-up. Big
Chuck Smalling and smashing Harry
Hillman did most of the passing last
week, but neither showed up to any
great advantage—even though the
lone touchdown of the day resulted
from a pass, Smalling to Rothert.
"Pop" will probably work his full
backs overtime tossing the pigskin
around within the next few days.
Showing Encouraging
Yet aside from these flaws, the var
sity looks better than it did at this
time last year. For one thing, it seems
to have shaken off its old habit of
fumbling the ball on about every
other play. The Stanford backs hand
died the ball to perfection on reverse,
plays, and were out-fumbled by both
the Army and Club outfits.
One thing that greatly please.i
Coach Warner was the great sinas
ing power and tight oefense shov
by his giant backfield, composed
Fleishhacker, Smalling,, Rothert, and
Frentrup. This quaret, which started
both games, packed plenty of punch.

around 200 pounds, and is one of the
heaviest backfields in the country.

The work of Ilarry Hillman and
Phil Neill, a couple of juniors with

Oregon invasion.
Protection for the passers and kick
ers and some sloppy open field tack
ling in the Club contest were especial
ly displeasing to the Old Fox. One
punt was actually blocked, several
passes were smeared behind the line,
and tricky Morton Kaer shook off
tacklers right and left in returning
punts for a total of 110 yards.
Long Injury List
Stanford has also received its share
of early-season injuries to date.
Johnny Preston, veteran left end, in
jured a knee last Saturday and will
be unable to see action in the Oregon
game, according to the team physi
cians. Kay Albertson, one of the best
end prospects on the squad, who was
hurt in the Army game, is not yet in
shape to play. Fleishhacker and Sim
kins are on the hospital list, but
either or both of them may get into
the struggle Saturday.
The passing attack was not too
good against the Olympic team, this
being largely due to the fact that
Simkins was out of the line-up. Big
Chuck Smalling and smashing Harry
Hillman did most of the passing last
week, but neither showed up to any
great advantage—even though the
lone touchdown of the day resulted
from a pass, Smalling to Rothert.
"Pop" will probably work his full
backs overtime tossing the pigskin
around within the next few days.
Showing Encouraging
Yet aside from these flaws, the var
sity looks better than it did at this
time last year. For one thing, it seems
to have shaken off its old habit of
fumbling the ball on about every
other play. The Stanford backs hand
died the ball to perfection on reverse,
plays, and were out-fumbled by both
the Army and Club outfits.
One thing that greatly please.i
Coach Warner was the great sinas
ing power and tight oefense shov
by his giant backfield, composed
Fleishhacker, Smalling,, Rothert, and
Frentrup. This quaret, which started
both games, packed plenty of punch.
And it is no wonder, as it averages
around 200 pounds, and is one of the
heaviest backfields in the country.
Neill, Hillman Good
The work of Ilarry Hillman and
Phil Neill, a couple of juniors with
two more years of varsity competition
apiece, has attracted considerable at
tention. Hillman, one of the hardest
charging backs on the squad, aver
aged more than five yards in plug
ging holes through the strong Olym
pic line.
Neill showed to such good advan
tage against the Club that yesterday
"Pop" announced that the blond lad
would be in the starting line-up
against Oregon. If Neill plays a bang
up game again this Saturday, Preston
may And it hard going to regain his
place on the first string. At any rate
Stanford is not going to be weak at
the wings this year, with Captain
Muller, whose playing stood out in
the Club encounter, Dick Worden, Kay
Albertson, Bullet Bush, Preston, and
Neill fighting it out for positions on
the team.
Line Shows Strength
The rest of the line demonstrated
that it is going to be plenty tough to
crack. Walt Heinecke looks as good
or better than last year, and Perry
Taylor, his understudy at center,
played good ball during the Olympic
Club game. Pete Heiser, Bull Dricoll,
Ham Wilson, and Ray Dawson proved
their worth at guard, while Ray
Tandy, Tiny Artman, Red Thompson,
and Dick Bogue look hard to beat at
tackle.
Harlow Rothert played the best
game of his career against the Club,
and is rapidly developing into one of
the outstanding backs on the squad.
Hit punting was good Saturday, he
knocked down a lot of passes on de
fense, and he reeled off some nice
gains through the line. Another player
who will see a lot of action before
the year is over is Phil Moffatt. With
a little more experience, he should
turn into one of the sweetest safety
men this Pacific Coast has ever seen.
Oregon Dangerous
This Oregon game, by the way, is
going to be a hectic battle from be
ginning to end. Last year Stanford
was hard-pressed to down the north
ern team by a fourteen-point margin
And last year their team was made
up of sophomores. But on Saturday a
veteran bunch of players will face
the Cards at the opening kickoff.
While the varsity was playing the
Olympic Club, Chuck Winterburn,
who assists Pop in coaching the back
field, was up North scouting the Ore
gon-Pacific game. What he saw of the
Oregon team was plenty. It trounced
the Pacific team by a score of 58 to 0,
and Pacific was no "push over." Win

terburn reports that Oregon has a
heavy, fast charging squad and pos
sesses a strong offense, quite similar
to Warner's "B" formation.
It is hard at this time to speculate
on Saturday's starting lineup, al
though the line will probably be the
same as that which opened against
the Club, with the exception of Phil
Neill at left end. According to "Pop,"
the squad Is likely to be cut down
either today or tomorrow to about five
full teams or fifty-five men.
With two practice games already
tucked safely away in its bag of vic
tories, a 45 to 0 win from the West
Coast Army and a close 6 to 0 upset
over the Olympic Club, Stanford's big
football varsity settled down to seri

Taylor, his understudy at center,
played good ball during the Olympic
Club game. Pete Heiser, Bull Dricoll,
Ham Wilson, and Ray Dawson proved
their worth at guard, while Ray
Tandy, Tiny Artman, Red Thompson,
and Dick Bogue look hard to beat at
tackle.
Harlow Rothert played the best
game of his career against the Club,
and is rapidly developing into one of
the outstanding backs on the squad.
Hit punting was good Saturday, he
knocked down a lot of passes on de
fense, and he reeled off some nice
gains through the line. Another player
who will see a lot of action before
the year is over is Phil Moffatt. With
a little more experience, he should
turn into one of the sweetest safety
men this Pacific Coast has ever seen.
Oregon Dangerous
This Oregon game, by the way, is
going to be a hectic battle from be
ginning to end. Last year Stanford
was hard-pressed to down the north
ern team by a fourteen-point margin
And last year their team was made
up of sophomores. But on Saturday a
veteran bunch of players will face
the Cards at the opening kickoff.
While the varsity was playing the
Olympic Club, Chuck Winterburn,
who assists Pop in coaching the back
field, was up North scouting the Ore
gon-Pacific game. What he saw of the
Oregon team was plenty. It trounced
the Pacific team by a score of 58 to 0,
and Pacific was no "push over." Win

terburn reports that Oregon has a
heavy, fast charging squad and pos
sesses a strong offense, quite similar
to Warner's "B" formation.
It is hard at this time to speculate
on Saturday's starting lineup, al
though the line will probably be the
same as that which opened against
the Club, with the exception of Phil
Neill at left end. According to "Pop,"
the squad Is likely to be cut down
either today or tomorrow to about five
full teams or fifty-five men.
