# WOMEN'S GYM TO BE UNDER CONSTRUCTION BY END OF QUARTER
## Buildings Will Follow Lines Of Spanish Style and Will Face Roble 
### 
Construction on the new $225,000 wom
en's gymnasium, voted by the Board of
Athletic Control June 13, is expected to
be begun before the end of the quarter.
Architects arc working at present on
detail drawings for the inside construc
tion of the building as well as sketches
of the exterior.
The building will follow the lines of
Spanish architecture, being built around
a patio, and having, like other University
buildings, a red-tile roof. It will occupy
a site facing Roble, along the road run
ning parallel to the hall. The hockey
fields and other outdoor grounds will ex
tend back from the gymnasium toward
Eucalyptus Avenue.
The gymnasium and the dance studio
will be on the main floor, around the
patio. Unlike the present structure, the
dance studio is to be regarded as a sep
arate unit, with specially designed deco
ration suitable for such a room. An in
door archery shooting gallery will be on
the second floor, above the studio. There
are to be two swimming pools, one for
class work and the other for recreation.
Additional shower and dressing rooms
will also be supplied to avoid the present
necessity of having more than one in a
room.
