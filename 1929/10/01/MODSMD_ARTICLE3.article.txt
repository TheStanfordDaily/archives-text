# HEAR YE! OYEZ! OPENING DANCE TONIGHTâ€”$1.00
## 
### 
Make it an even hundred!
After paying 99 dollars to gain
admittance to the main show of
the University, one should not
miss the biggest sideshow for
the dollar admission charge.
The registration dance will
cost just that, and will be given
tonight from 9 to 12 o'clock at
Branner Hall.
Sigma Delta Chi, sponsor of
the function, especially invites
freshmen and new students to
attend. And faculty members may
dance free!
