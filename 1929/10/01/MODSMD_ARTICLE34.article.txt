# ACTING PRESIDENT AND WIFE WILL ENTERTAIN NEW STUDENTS FRIDAY
## 
### 
Acting President and Mrs. Robert
E. Swain will be at home informally
at the President's house on Lagunita
Knoll next Friday evening at 8 o'clock
to all students registered for the first
time this quarter. There will be music
for those who care to dance.
This function is held annually at
the opening of fall quarter to offer a
short-cut to the difficult process of
getting acquainted in the University
by giving all newcomers a chance to
meet their fellow students.
