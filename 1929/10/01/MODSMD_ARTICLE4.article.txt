# ADDITION TO PRESS BUILDING, NEW SHOP UNDER CONSTRUCTION
## Journalism Division, Student Publications to Have Offices in Unit 
### 
Construction of a new shop build
ing for the Stanford University Press
and remodeling of the present Pres3
Building for offices were authorized
by the Board of Trustees at a recent
meeting.
The new unit, which will occupy
part of the corporation yard immedi
ately south of the present structure,
will house the proofroom, composing
room, and bindery. It will be erected
at a cost of $50,000 and new press
machinery worth $20,000 will be added
to the present equipment. The Press
administrative offices on the ground
floor will be extended to cover about
three times their present area, and
the offices of the Journalism Division
and student publications will occupy
additional space on the second floor.
Larger accommodations for stock,
storage, and shipping will also be con
structed. The work, which was com
menced about the middle of Septem
ber, is scheduled for completion by
December 15.
In addition to its bookkeeping ac
tivities, the Press does all the print
ing and binding for the University,
including the Stanford Libraries and
Lane Medical School. The volume of
manufacturing work done by the
Press has nearly tripled since 1920,
and has increased about 50 per cent
since 1925, when it began a general
book-publishing program under its im
print. Here also are printed most of
the student and departmental publica
tions. The University Press is one of
the few publishing houses in the coun
try to maintain a complete manufac
turing plant, all of its books being
composed, printed, and bound in its
own shops. There are now more than
150 titles listed in the general cata
logue with seven new books to be
added this fall.
The additions to the Press Build
ings, according to Will A. Friend,
manager, will provide space to double
the present output.
