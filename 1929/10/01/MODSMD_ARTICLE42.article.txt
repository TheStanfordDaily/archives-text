Som on getting back to
work aite - :aking in the national aua
teur golf tournament. . . . The old bird
in Pacific Grove who stopped me on the
street and began with, "Be you at the
golf?" and ended up by saying, "They
play it on horseback, don't they?" . . .
I wish I'd bet, on Monday, September 2,
that Jimmy Johnston and Doc Willing
would be the ultimate finalists in a tour
nament that included Jones, Tolley,
Voigt, VonElm, Sweetser, Moe, etc. . . .
What a barrel of dough a guy could have
made. . . . The view over the East River,
New York, is all right in its way, but
it can't compare with the scenery around
Pebble Beach . . . those rocks and that
water, those pine and cypress trees, those
beautiful rolling greens among the sand
traps . . . and those movie actresses in
the gallery!
Cyril Tolley's lavender handkerchief
tucked up his left coat-sleeve . . . and
how the ladies in the crowd went crazy
over him, reaching out to touch his coat
as he passed and saying, "Magnificent!"
"Marvelous!" "Wonderful!" Phooey!
The story about Tolley at the baseball
game ... he is quoted as saying, "This
man Baby Ruth takes his stance and
slices a ball into the pavilion. . . . And
the extraordinary part of it was that the
multitude arose and cheered, and even
cast their hats into the arena."
The wise-crack when Don Moe, hope
of the Pacific Coast, was eliminated,
which ran, "It ain't gonna rain no Moe"
... and the typographer who thought he
knew how it should go, and spelled
"Moe" "More." . . . The sign carried by
the red-coated marshal that said, "first

two rows sit or kneel" . . . and Peter
Hay, big Scotch pro at the Pebble Beach
Club, bawling out in a loud voice, "Stand,
everybody!" .. .
Jimmy Johnston's shot in his match
with Voigt that his a tree, bounced and
hit a man on the head, and then rolled
to the green . . . the gallery applauding
when Dr. Willing missed a putt . . . Lord
Hope's birdie at the eighteenth, played
from out of the rocks and seaweed . . .
and speaking of birdies, there was Billie
Dove in the gallery on Saturday . . .
knocking the boys cuckoo.
