# THAT "HELLO" TRADITION
## 
### 
Within the week freshmen will be subjected to numerous talks from
sponsors and well-intentioned advisers endeavoring to "put them on the
boat."
The new student may mildly be impressed. But a few days about the
campus will reveal that most so-called traditions have evidently been
relegated to the obscure resting place of old safety-razor blades. Should
the freshmen become rueful or alarmed concerning that fate, they should
bear in mind the fact that junking hoary traditions is a sign of progress.
A few customs, however, are worth observing, and their perpetuation
rests with the new men. Towering above all is the "hello" tradition.
Since the days of peg-top trousers and turtle-neck sweaters, the friendly,
informal atmosphere at Stanford has been a notable characteristic. It has
indicated the presence of a real college spirit as contrasted with the "rah
fah for alma mammy" variety. Nothing is so conducive to the crystalli
zation of Stanford Spirit as the spontaneous greeting between fellow
students.
So, freshmen, if you happen to be in a buoyant mood and meet some
one about the campus, don't be afraid to ring out a snappy "hello." Cheer
fulness is contagious, and both persons will probably feel better for the
greeting.
