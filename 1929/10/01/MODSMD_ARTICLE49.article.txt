Remember the countless ten-cent breakfasts consisting of coffee and
a small snail? Or maybe coffee and a couple of doughnuts? Remember
the cup of java between classes, or the 10 o'clock snack at night? Well,
they're gone. Gone the way of nickel beer.
With the passing of the old Roost, and the glorification of the En
cina Basement counter, the management of the Union system of food
dispensaries has seen fit to double the price of the questionable black
liquid which we imbibed for its warmth. Pie will henceforth be purveyed
for fifteen cents. All of this to add a few gee-gaws around the fountain
and to rebuild the store and cellar. Please, can't we have our old Roost
and store back again? And coffee for a nickel.
