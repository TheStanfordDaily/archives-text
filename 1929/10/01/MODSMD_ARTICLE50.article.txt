# SUCCESS UNDER A SEVERE HANDICAP
## 
### 
Gordon Davis, versatile director of Stanford dramatics, has left the
campus on a year's leave of absence, during which time he plans to take
a real vacation hobnobbing with the satellites of Hollywood and traveling
in Europe to study the Continental schools of drama.
Coming here ten years ago, Davis has raised Stanford theatrical pro
ductions to an eminent position. Few realize what he has had to contend
with in an obsolete stage, that would even have been out of date in the
mutton-sleeved days of three decades ago. In spite of this handicap, he
has brought Stanford dramatics to the fore.
Harold Ilelvenston has been appointed acting director for the ensu
ing year. Helvenston himself is nationally famous for his ability in creat
ing stage sets and because of his experience is particularly well qualified
to take over his new duties.
In the meantime Stanford dramatics will continue on as high a plane
as ever, and campus play-goers will continue to suffer cramps and
strained necks in an inadequate and antiquated hall. From the actors to
the audience, Stanford dramatics as presented in the Assembly Hall are
truly based on "art for art's sake."
