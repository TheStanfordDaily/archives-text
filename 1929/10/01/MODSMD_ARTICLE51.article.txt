# "STOP-GO" SIGNALS NEEDED
## 
### 
Far be it from us to contradict the perennial utterance of Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur to the effect that liquor and gasoline do not mix. Un
doubtedly Dr. Wilbur has placed a disconcerting finger at the very center
of a festering sore in our social structure.
But since Dr. Wilbur has temporarily deserted the task of advising
collegiate motorists, we feci called upon to warn the Stanford auto
mobilist of another menace, only slightly less menacing than a combina
tion of alcohol and petroleum by-products.
We refer to the intersection of Palm Drive and El Camino Real.
This death trap, at the very gates of the University, has for years been
a real danger to those who traversed the asphalt of Stanford's leading
traffic artery. While we can recall no fatalities at that point in recent
years, there have been innumerable dented fenders and dented feelings
which attest to the congestion and obscured vision which mark this
corner.
The installation of arterial stop signs has helped the situation con
siderably ; but the job is still half done, and the powers that be are guilty
of gross negligence until there are erected regulation "stop-and-go" signs
such as control the traffic in most metropolitan areas (including Ather
ton).
As things stand now one must have the courage of a lion and a
perfect faith in God to attempt a crossing of the highway on a Sunday
afternoon. Eliza, as she hopped from one ice cake to another, had noth
ing on the motorist or the pedestrian who noses through that stream of
traffic.
The difficulty in this case seems to be that there are too many fingers
in the pie. Inasmuch as El Camino Real is not in Palo Alto or on Uni
versity property, neither city officials nor University officials are em
powered to take definite action without first gaining consent of the state.
But the reams of red tape which stand in the way of this necessary
improvement should not be allowed to kill the project. The intersection
of El Camino Real and Palm Drive needs proper traffic regulation, and,
until this is achieved, motorists must be subjected to a constant menace
and an inconvenience.
