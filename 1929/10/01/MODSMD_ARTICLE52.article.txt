# ON WITH DANCE
## 
### 
Tonight all roads lead to Branner.
Freshmen and other new students will have an opportunity to "get
on the boat" socially, and to see Stanford at play for the first time at
the registration dance. After the exigencies of registering, it will be
pleasant to spend the evening in the traditional and logical way.
