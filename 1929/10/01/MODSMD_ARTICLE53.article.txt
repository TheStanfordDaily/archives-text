### PHILIP SPACE 
I'll bet you thought you weren't
going to hear from us again. That's
where you got fooled. Here we are,
and if you don't like it —you have our
full permission to join the great silent
minority. Maybe It's a majority at
that. But it's silent anyhow.
This first column will probably be
pretty bad, for we have been here all
summer, and are about fed up on
these guys who ask us how we en
joyed the vacation. Our temper is
terrible.
Of course, we ought to welcome the
Frosh. But somehow, we are more
sorry for them than anything. They
will (and have been) fleeced royally
for textbooks (which they will learn
not to buy at all next quarter); for
sundry subscriptions (it's lucky the
tuition takes care of the Daily); for
laundry and cleaning and supplies
and a baker's dozen of these things
that students are heir to. And to
crown their humiliation, some ruth
less man of commerce has sold them
"dinks." He doubtless informed them
that the silly little lids were a Stan
ford tradition, but the Class of *29
threw them away four years ago.
But they're at Stanford —where the
motto is "the winds of freedom are
blowing but don't blame us if you
catch a cold from the draught"—
they're at Stanford, we repeat, and —
well —they're at Stanford. The rest is
up to them.
We hope they like it here. We did.
We do yet.
But too many tourists have asked
us where Hoover's home is, that's all.
We'll be all right as soon as the
Union is open and we can get some
of that good 10 cent coffee. At least,
we hear it's going to be a dime. That
will suit us fine, as you may well
guess, for 'tis more blessed to give
than receive.
While you were away this summer,
Purity Prevailed. The lads who were
working on the golf course with
naught on above the waist (the shame
of it!) were forced to garb them
selves more seemingly.
Aside from that, there was nothing
of interest.
As perhaps you have heard, foot
ball season will be held this fall. But
don't neglect your studies, fellows.
You are at college for a serious pur
pose.
We came here a gay, flippant, rah
rah boy, but several impressive con
ferences have made us see things the
Right Way. Have your fun, fellows,
but be true Stanford Men.
And as for the women —they won't
have to bother their charming heads
at all, for everything is done for
them. But one word of advice: do not
stay out too late at night, girls, lor
the Bogey Man is lurking around, and
anyhow you wouldn't want the Ad
ministration to sit up waiting for you.
Be thoughtful, girls, and you will
"Win." Be popular, too, for rushing
ceaton is next quarter, and all things
come to her who "rates."
Well, ah reckon" that's all for to
day. Uncle Philip will be on t.he air
for the Kiddie's Hour tomorrow, too,
if he doesn't trip over some red tape
and "bang" his "funny-bone," as he
did last year.
