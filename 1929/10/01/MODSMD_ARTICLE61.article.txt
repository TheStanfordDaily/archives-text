# UNIVERSITY PRESS TO PUBLISH SPANIARD'S BOOK ON OLD MUSIC
## 
### 
That much of our modern music is
derived through Spain from ancient Ar
abic melodies is the discovery of Dr.
Julian Ribera, of the University of Ma
drid, whose "Music in Ancient Arabia
and Spain" will be published by the Uni
versity Press in an English translation
done by Eleanor Hague and Marion Lef
fingwell.
The study leading to this discovery,
which fills a blank chapter in the history
of music, was based on the "Cantigas"
of Alfonso the Wise. These medieval
manuscripts, supposed to be church mu
sic, had never been deciphered until Dr.
Ribera identified them as secular melo
dies, Moorish in origin. These, he says,
are the originals of practically all the
types now considered indigenous to the
different regions of Spain. From Spain,
this music, which Dr. Rbera found to
be surprsingly rich and highly developed,
spread all over medieval Europe without
its origin being known.
"Europe still therefore owes a debt of
gratitude to the Andalusian Moors," says
Dr. Ribera, "who maintained and passed
on a rich fund of music, a perennial
spring to which all European composers
have come to renew their inspiration, but
without seeking its unknown sources."
