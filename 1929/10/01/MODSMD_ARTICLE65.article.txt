## LINE IS HARD TO DENT 
### 
When the last gun was fired at the
close of the 1928 gridiron season, fol
lowers of Cardinal football chances be
moaned the fact that the middle of Stan
ford's line would be weak this fall. How
could it possibly hold up with the loss
of Dynamite Post and Don Robesky,
first string guards, both of whom were
chosen on all-American teams? Added
to this, Tiny Sellman, one of the out
standing tackles on the Coast, was lost
through graduation.
The guards, contrary to the conception
of the common spectators, are two of the
most important players on any football
team. Not only are they essential for a
strong defense, but they form the key
to the offense. This is especially true of
the Warner System, as the guards pull
out of the line and run interference on
nearly every play. Reverses and spin
plays are complete flops without fast,
hard smashing guards to bowl over the
opponents' ends and secondary defense.
But after the Army game, two
weeks ago, these same moaners emit
ted sighs of relief, and after the
Olympic encounter these sighs be
came cheers. The center of the line
not only stood up well under the
tough going, but showed that it is
made of championship caliber. Both
Bull Driscoll and Pete Heiser played
a bang-up game at guard, as did Wil
son and Dawson, who replaced them.
Walt Heinecke, chunky and put to
gether like a gorilla, stood out at
center as usual. In the two scraps he
was all over the field, and made more
tackles than the average pivot man
makes during a whole season. If
Heinecke doesn't make all-Coast and
all-American this year, provided his
heart doesn't go back on him and he
isn't forced out by injuries, the
sports critics are just plain blind.
And Pop has an excellent young man,
by the name of Perry Taylor, to replace
Heinecke whenever necessary. Taylor is
a rangy lad with a pair of hands built
like bear traps—and just as potent. He
showed that he can cover plenty of terri
tory on defense during the Club game,
when he knocked down a pass just as it
was about to settle into the outstretched
hands of one Mr. Ford for a sure touch
down.
• Flanking the guards, Stanford has two
first class tackles in Artman and Ray
Tandy, a couple of big strong fellows
with previous varsity experience, and
such men as Klabau, Bogue, and Thomp
son in reserve.
So it seems that teams are going to
have a plenty hard time putting any sort
of a dent in the middle of the Cardinal
line during the year 1929.

lowers of Cardinal football chances be
moaned the fact that the middle of Stan
ford's line would be weak this fall. How
could it possibly hold up with the loss
of Dynamite Post and Don Robesky,
first string guards, both of whom were
chosen on all-American teams? Added
to this, Tiny Sellman, one of the out
standing tackles on the Coast, was lost
through graduation.
The guards, contrary to the conception
of the common spectators, are two of the
most important players on any football
team. Not only are they essential for a
strong defense, but they form the key
to the offense. This is especially true of
the Warner System, as the guards pull
out of the line and run interference on
nearly every play. Reverses and spin
plays are complete flops without fast,
hard smashing guards to bowl over the
opponents' ends and secondary defense.
But after the Army game, two
weeks ago, these same moaners emit
ted sighs of relief, and after the
Olympic encounter these sighs be
came cheers. The center of the line
not only stood up well under the
tough going, but showed that it is
made of championship caliber. Both
Bull Driscoll and Pete Heiser played
a bang-up game at guard, as did Wil
son and Dawson, who replaced them.
Walt Heinecke, chunky and put to
gether like a gorilla, stood out at
center as usual. In the two scraps he
was all over the field, and made more
tackles than the average pivot man
makes during a whole season. If
Heinecke doesn't make all-Coast and
all-American this year, provided his
heart doesn't go back on him and he
isn't forced out by injuries, the
sports critics are just plain blind.
And Pop has an excellent young man,
by the name of Perry Taylor, to replace
Heinecke whenever necessary. Taylor is
a rangy lad with a pair of hands built
like bear traps—and just as potent. He
showed that he can cover plenty of terri
tory on defense during the Club game,
when he knocked down a pass just as it
was about to settle into the outstretched
hands of one Mr. Ford for a sure touch
down.
• Flanking the guards, Stanford has two
first class tackles in Artman and Ray
Tandy, a couple of big strong fellows
with previous varsity experience, and
such men as Klabau, Bogue, and Thomp
son in reserve.
So it seems that teams are going to
have a plenty hard time putting any sort
of a dent in the middle of the Cardinal
line during the year 1929.
