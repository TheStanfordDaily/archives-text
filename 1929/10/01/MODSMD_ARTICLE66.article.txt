# POP PULLS AN OLD ONE
## 
### 
Although as old and worn-out as the
"statue of liberty" play, the on-side
kick-off worked to perfection last Sat
urday. It was pulled just after Stanford
had put over the first and last touchdown
of the game.
Herb Fleishhacker, pretending that he
was going to kick off, made believe that
the position of the ball didn't quite suit
his taste. So he proceeded to fuss around
the pigskin for some little time. As he
started to walk back to his position, Har
low Rothert suddenly upped and'booted
the ball, which merely dribbled down the
field about ten yards from placement and
over near the sidelines. Lud Frentrup
promptly recovered and to the surprise
of all, except a certain coach and his
white jerseyed players, Stanford had pos
session of the ball on the Club's 45-yard
line.
The acting was great and the play
caught the Olympic players completely
off guard.
Pop will undoubtedly pack this
"fooler" away in moth balls for an
other two or three years before he
attempts to spring it again. It will
be remembered that he pulled it off
on California a few years gone by.
The Old Fox has a keen sense for
timeliness in picking his tricks.
