# NEW MEN'S SWIMMING UNIT WILL BE READY TOMORROW
## Work on Golf Course Has Been Completed; New Links Are Scheduled To Be Opened For Play About Jan. 1 
### 
Stanford University's new $100,000
swimming unit will be ready for use
tomorrow morning, according to James
Tucker, Board of Athletic Control en
gineer.
The new plant includes three large
pools and a modern water purification
system. Ernie Brandsten, director of
water sports, declares that this new
est addition to the Cardinal athletic
group is undoubtedly the finest of its
kind in the country.
At the same time A1 Masters, gen
eral manager of the 8.A.C., announces
that the last seed was planted yester
day on the fairways and greens of the
University-owned golf course and that
the links will be ready for play by
January 1.
The Cardinal course is an elghteen
hole championship affair and parallels
the County Road extending from the
Lagunita to the old Stanford stock
farm. The eighteen holes will total
more than G4OO yards in length.
Masters announces that students
may use the course on any one of
three plans. A three-month privilege
will sell for $15, one month for $6,
or daily greens fees will cost one dol
lar on week-days and two dollars on
Sundays and holidays. In addition 150
playing privileges have been sold to
outsiders at $125 each.
William F. Bell, designer of the
local links, states that there will be
no course on the Coast superior to
the Stanford one.
To remove the congested condition
that formerly existed at the swim
ming tank, Brandsten planned sepa
rate pools for varsity swimmers and
divers, and a third for class and re
creational swimming. The varsity
tank will measure 75 by 40 feet with
a uniform depth of six feet and will
be equipped with rope lane markers.
The diving tank is 60 by 40 feet with
a varying depth of from nine to
twelve feet. The class tank is another
60 by 40 footer with a uniform depth
of four feet six inches.
Brandsten expects the Cardinal
pools to be exceptionally fast because
of their great width and depth which
will eliminate backwash. The 75- and
60-foot lengths are the official long
and short courses recognized by A.A.U.
and Intercollegiate rules committees.
The tanks also measure correctly for
water polo fields, and will be unusual
in that there will be deep water at
each end.
The diving equipment will include
a steel tower with platforms at the

regulation twenty-seven- and sixteen
foot heights. In addition there will
be a ten-foot, board and a trio of three
footers for official competition and a
six-foot board for practice work. No
colleges and few clubs can equal the
Stanford diving apparatus.
Bleachers for 220 spectators have
been built around three sides of the
pool. The tanks are built of smooth
plaster walls and bottoms with tile
rimming. Dr. Thomas A. Storey de
signed the purification and circulating
system whereby the water is filtered,
heated, and chlorinated, and a com
plete change of fresh water is pumped
into each tank every eight hours.
The B.A.C. has placed twenty-five
more showers in the east wing of En
cina gym and have extended the
locker space. All seats in the Stadium
were repainted during the summer
months.
Work is progressing slowly on the
new varsity baseball field. The dia
mond is not expected to be ready be
fore the 1931 season.
