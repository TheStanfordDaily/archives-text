# LATERAL IS HARD TO STOP
## 
### 
Speaking of tricks, the varsity has a
couple of foxy new plays in the form of
lateral passes. One of these, that in the
future is bound to give the cash custom
ers a thrill and add ample yardage to
the home team's total, worked well
enough against the Olympic Club to
bring some 20,000 fans to their feet and
at the same time was a big factor in
putting over the Card's lone touchdown.
It works something like this:
The fullback gets the ball and
fakes a smash through center. But
as he reaches the line of scrimmage,
he slips the oval to one of the guards
on a reverse around end. The guard
in turn hangs on to the ball just long
enough for the opposing end and
half to be well "sucked in," and then
quite unexpectedly chucks a short
pass toward the sidelines. At this
stage of the game one of the half
backs comes charging in from no
where, snags the pass, and is off to
the races.
The play is a hard one for the de
fensive players to solve, and even if they
do figure it out it is a tough one to stop.
