# BUS SERVICE TO REPLACE TOONERVILLE
## Comptroller Roth, Railway Officials Plan Route For Motor Line 
### 
Motor bus service between the campus
and Palo Alto will replace the well
known and now antiquated "Toonerville
Trolley" in the near future when the
street car tracks will be torn up to make
room for a wider highway through the
city.
Almon E. Roth, Comptroller of the
University, and officials of the Peninsu
lar Railway Company are now working
on plans for establishing and routing the
new bus line. The company and the city
council decided by joint action in August
to discontinue the line.
University support of the new propo
sition for campus transportation was im
mediately given. In Roth's opinion, the
convenience and efficiency of a bus serv
ice on the campus will De welcomed by
campus dwellers.
The decision to terminate campus street
car service comes as a result of the im
provement activities of the California
State Highway Commission. This body
has started on a program of widening the
state highway. In order to do this, it
needed the narrow strip of land now oc
cupied by the Peninsular Railway Com
pany's tracks running alongside the high
way from Palo Alto to just north of
May fie Id.
To relay the track would require an
expenditure larger than the assessed val
uation of the whole line, including the
line to the campus. So the Peninsular
Railway asked the Palo Alto city council
to be relieved of the provisions of its
franchise requiring the company to fur
nish scrvice for several years yet.
With the abolition of street car serv
ice, the University faces the problem of
adequate freight delivery. It is now be
lieved that truck service will be as effi
cient as the former service was. A pipe
line has been proposed to be installed
between the Palo Alto Southern Pacific
station and the campus power plant for
the delivery ox fuel oil.
The railway company will continue its
service on the line to San Jose, making
hus connections with the street car in
Mayfield.
