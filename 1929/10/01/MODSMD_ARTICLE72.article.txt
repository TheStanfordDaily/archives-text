# NO REPLACEMENT ON A.S.S.U. CARDS, SAYS 'JAKE' IRWIN
## Big Game, U.S.C., And Army Applications To Be Issued Today 
### 
Students who lose their student body
cards this year will have to pay full
public admission prices at all athletic
contests. This bit of information was is
sued yesterday from the Board of Ath
letic Control officc by Jake Irwin, along
with the announcement that application
forms for the California, Southern Cal,
and Army games will be given out today
in front of the Administration Building.
Two reasons were given by Irwin for
this policy change of not issuing dupli
cate student body cards for the year 1929.
In the first place, students, by the mere
showing of their A.S.S.U. cards, will
be admitted free to all games with the
exception of the California, U.S.C., and
West Point encounters.
The second and main reason is that in
the past certain students, by pretending
to have lost their cards, have obtained
extra ones for their friends. This simply
means that these certain students' friends
got twelve-dollar season tickets for the
sum of one dollar, thereby cheating the
B.A.C. out of eleven dollars change.
These eleven-dollar losses amounted to a
considerable total, according to Irwin.
Following are application rules and
ticket information given out by the
8.A.C.:
1. Application forms for California,
Southern California, and Army games
may be secured at tables outside of Ad
ministration Building.
2. Do not lose your student body card.
You cannot secure a duplicate and will
have to pay admission to all games if

you lose it.
3. All student tickets will be distrib
uted by registered mail. Your student
body card will admit you to the Stadium
for all games except the California,
Southern California, and Army games.
You must fill out applications for these
games before October IS, 1929.
4. Give your Stanford mailing address
on all applications.
5. Rooter's tickets are not transferable.
If you are working at any of these games
do not apply for a rooter's ticket. Band
members must not apply for rooter's
tickets. Varsity, Gray, and freshman
squad members should not apply as stu
dents.
6. Be sure and make separate checks
for each application.
