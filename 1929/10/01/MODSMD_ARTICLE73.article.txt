# FROSH OPEN GRID SEASON WITH WIN OVER J.C. TEAM
## 
### 
Stanford's 1929 freshman football
toters displayed their wares as a grid
team for the first time on Saturday
when they turned back a fast and
determined bunch from Sacramento
Junior College by a score of 7 to 6.
The game was a preliminary to the
varsity contest with the Olympic
Club.
Although the game was a bit rag
ged in spots, Coach "Husky" Hunt's
men played heads-up football for the
most part. Intercepted passes and
fumbles gave the crowd many thrills.
Stanford made its touchdown, the
first of the game, in the middle of the
first quarter. Kenny Afflerbaugh, left
half, received a punt on his own
thirty-eight yard line and, slipping
through the arms of one tackier,
skipped around the rest of the Sacra
mento team for 62 yards and a touch
down. It was a fine exhibition of open
field running. Wesley Stevens con
verted to give the Card Babes their
one-point margin of victory.
Sacramento scored in the same
quarter when Donadio, as fast and

shifty a back as the '33 men are likely
to come up against, got away for a
fine 32-yard run. He was finally
downed on Stanford's 8-yard line by
Afflerbaugh, who made a flying tackle
just in time. The Junior College team
needed just two downs for those eight
yards, Domadio making the score. The
try-for-point was blocked.
During the remainder of the game
the ball never got dangerously near
either goal. The freshmen used a re
versed and a delayed buck to good ad
vantage several times, also resorting
to the air occasionally. Sacramento
passed frequently, but depended
chiefly on their speedy backfield men,
Donadio, Brown, and Brett.
No one man was outstanding for
the frosh. Afflerbaugh at left half,
Stevens at full, and Choato at center
showed possibilities as future stars.
Bill Artman at quarter gave indica
tions that he is preparing to fill his
brother's shoes on the varsity in a
few years.

field running. Wesley Stevens con
verted to give the Card Babes their
one-point margin of victory.
Sacramento scored in the same
quarter when Donadio, as fast and

shifty a back as the '33 men are likely
to come up against, got away for a
fine 32-yard run. He was finally
downed on Stanford's 8-yard line by
Afflerbaugh, who made a flying tackle
just in time. The Junior College team
needed just two downs for those eight
yards, Domadio making the score. The
try-for-point was blocked.
During the remainder of the game
the ball never got dangerously near
either goal. The freshmen used a re
versed and a delayed buck to good ad
vantage several times, also resorting
to the air occasionally. Sacramento
passed frequently, but depended
chiefly on their speedy backfield men,
Donadio, Brown, and Brett.
No one man was outstanding for
the frosh. Afflerbaugh at left half,
Stevens at full, and Choato at center
showed possibilities as future stars.
Bill Artman at quarter gave indica
tions that he is preparing to fill his
brother's shoes on the varsity in a
few years.
Stanford's 1929 freshman football
toters displayed their wares as a grid
team for the first time on Saturday
when they turned back a fast and
determined bunch from Sacramento
Junior College by a score of 7 to 6.
The game was a preliminary to the
varsity contest with the Olympic
Club.
Although the game was a bit rag
ged in spots, Coach "Husky" Hunt's
men played heads-up football for the
most part. Intercepted passes and
fumbles gave the crowd many thrills.
Stanford made its touchdown, the
first of the game, in the middle of the
first quarter. Kenny Afflerbaugh, left
half, received a punt on his own
thirty-eight yard line and, slipping
through the arms of one tackier,
skipped around the rest of the Sacra
mento team for 62 yards and a touch
down. It was a fine exhibition of open
field running. Wesley Stevens con
verted to give the Card Babes their
one-point margin of victory.
