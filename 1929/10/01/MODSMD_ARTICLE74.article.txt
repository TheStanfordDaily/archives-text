# STANFORD DEBATERS WILL MEET OXFORD TEAM IN NOVEMBER
## Preliminary Tryouts To Be Open to All, Announces Professor Emerson 
### 
A debate between Oxford University
and Stanford, preliminary plans for
which were announced last spring, has
been tentatively arranged for November
12 in the Stanford auditorium, according
to J. G. Emerson, debate coach. Tryouts
for the right to represent Stanford in
this debate are to be held in the Little
Theater on October 8 at 1:30 p.m.
The Oxford team is touring the Uni
ted States under the managership of the
National Student Federation of America,
meeting the leading colleges and univer
sities of the country. While in the vi
cinity of San Francisco they will debate
with the University of California, Col
lege of the Pacific, and Stanford.
Of the five topics submitted by the
English team, the following has been
chosen for the tryouts: "Resolved, That
this is the best of all possible worlds."
At the first trials, on October 8, the field
will be narrowed to the eight or ten best
candidates, and the final selection of the
three-man team will be made at further
trials on October 11.
The tryouts will be open to both gradu
ates and undergraduates, but graduates
who are interested are requested to con
sult Professor Emerson with regard to
certain limitations to their trying out.
All those intending to try out must sign
up on the sheet posted outside his door,
Professor Emerson has announced.
The first trials will consist of five
minute speeches with no rebuttals.
Speakers may choose either side of the
question, except that approximately the
same number is desired on both sides.
Late comers may be switched in order to
even the sides up, Professor Emerson ex
plained. If the same topic is used for the
debate itself Stanford will probably
speak on the affirmative.
