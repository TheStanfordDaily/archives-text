# INSTALL DIAL 'PHONE SYSTEM; CHANGE P.A. AND CAMPUS NUMBERS
## 
### 
Installation of dial telephones in Palo
Alto and on the campus during the sum
mer lias necessitated a complete change
of numbers, the most common one being
the University's new number, 6161. The
new exchange for all men's halls is 3121;
Roble's number is 5171; Board of Ath
letic Control, 4181; Stanford Union,
3-121; Stanford Daily: editorial office,
21624; business office, 4717. All frater
nity and sorority numbers have also been
changed during the summer.
The dial system has been partially in
stalled in San Francisco and Los Ange
les for some time, the change there tak
ing place gradually rather than through
out the city at one time.
