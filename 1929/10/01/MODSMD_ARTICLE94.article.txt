Stanford students returning to the
University, were injured when the car

of Omaha, Nebraska. Hughes Brew

fractured in two places. Coit was less
seriously hurt, and has continued on
to the campus. Hume and Brewster

The accident occurred at night
when a car coming in the opposite di

a third car which was parked with
out lights.
