CRISTOBAL, Canal Zone, Sept. 30
(/P). â€”Two thousand persons stood in a
driving rain at France Field yesterday
afternoon to witness the completion of
Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh's flight
from Barranquilla, Colombia. The flight
covered about 400 miles.
The aviator, who was accompanied by
his bride, the former Anne Morrow, and
Mrs. J. Trippe, wife of the president of
Pan American Airways, Inc., skirted the
northern South American coast, landing
perfectly and taxiing quickly to a hangar.
He had good weather from Barranquilla
until near the Canal Zone.
He was greeted at the hangar by Colo
nel Mars, commander of France Field,
Captain Kerrick of the submarine base,
and Commander Bernhard of the Coco
Solo air station, and the usual quarantine
and customs officials.
Colonel Lindbergh said he expected to
remain in Panama and the Canal Zone
for several days. He did not know when
he would fly northward on the last laps
of his Caribbean Sea airmail venture.
