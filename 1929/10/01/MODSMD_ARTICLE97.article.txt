LOUISVILLE, Ky., Sept. 30 (£>).—
Until an agreement for real naval parity
is reached, America's cruiser building
program should be continued, said Paul
V. McNull, national commander of the
American Legion, in his annual report
made public at the opening session of the
organization's national convention here
today.
Asserting that the Legion stands for
movements to make permanent peace
more certain, Commander McNutt added
that until such methods are found and ac
cepted by all nations "This nation must
provide a complete defense in any con
tingency."
