# FALL CONCERT TO BE ALFRED HERTZ' LAST AT STANFORD
## Orchestra Leader Resigns; Would Revive Interest In Symphony Group 
### 
When Alfred Hertz appears in the
initial A.S.S.U. concert of the year
December 4, it may be the last oppor
tunity that a Stanford audience will
have of hearing the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra under the direc
tion of the veteran conductor. Hertz
yesterday sent his resignation to J. B.
Levison, president of the San Fran
cisco Musical Association, believing
that a change in the leadership of the
orchestra might revive the waning
public interest in symphony concerts.
Hertz has built the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra into a nationally
known organization in the fourteen
years that he has conducted it. His
appearances on the Stanford Campus
in Founders' Day concerts have been
among the most popular musical
events of the college term for many
years.
In his letter of resignation, Hertz
said, in part:
"While my love and devotion to my
work with this splendid body of art
ists is as ardent today as ever, I feel
nevertheless that the time has come
when a change in the leadership of
the orchestra might seriously be taken
into consideration."
It is reported that the Association
has been considering Bruno Walter,
Director of the annual Mozart festival
at Salzburg, Austria, for conductor to
succeed Hertz.
There is a chance that Hertz will
appear again on the campus after his
December concert. As his resignation
is not to become effective until early
spring, he may still be available for
the Founders' Day concert.
