# Walker Charges Wire Tapping In Mayorality Race
## Seventeen Phones in City Hall Office Discovered Secretly Wired 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 1. (#>) —Discovery
that all the telephone wires into the
city hall office of Mayor James J.
Walker, Tammany candidate for re
election, had been tapped, was today's
pre-election sensation.
The discovery followed anti-Tam
many charges that more was known
in high placeß of the murder of Arnold
Rothstein than had ever been made
public, and that the Tammany Tiger
controlled a "tax racket" by which
the poor were made to bear the bur
dens of the favored rich.
Seventeen telephone instruments
are in the mayor's office and all of
the wires run through a padlocked
cable box in the basement. This box
had been wrenched open. An old
abandoned wire from the basement
to the third floor also ran through this
box and a short wire had been spliced
to this so that it could be hooked
onto any of the cables to the execu
tive office.
Telephone company experts, called
in to investigate strange noises and
"fading" on the mayor's wires, dis
covered marks of hook-in clips indi
cating that a portable listening set
had been connected with the aban
doned wire in the committee room of
the Aldermanic chamber, in the gal
lery outside that room, and in the
anteroom on the third floor.
Asked to comment on the political
significance of the wire tapping, if
any, Charles Kerrigan, assistant to
the mayor, replied that the public
could best judge of that, and asked
in turn who would have an interest in
such tactics "at this time."
