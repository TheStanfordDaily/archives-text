# NEW BRIDGE ACROSS SAN FRANCISQUITO TO BE COMPLETED SOON
## Concrete Structure Will Be Open in Five Weeks; Curves Reduced 
### 
The new bridge across San Francis
quito creek should be completed in
approximately five weeks, according
to the contractors. This bridge, a rein
forced concrete structure with dirt
fill approaches, replaces the old bridge
which gave way last spring. San
Mateo and Santa Clara counties are
jointly building the new bridge at a
cost of $27,325.
The bridge now under construction
eliminates the hazards of the old
wooden structure. The sharp curve on
the Stanford side is greatly reduced,
while the grade on the west side has
been cut down to 4 per cent. The new
bridge will be forty-one feet wide with
one and a half foot railings, four-foot
sidewalks, and a thirty-foot roadway.
Provisions for lighting are being made
with conduit to be installed in every
third pillar.
Seven tons of reinforcing steel will
be used in constructing the bridge.
So far 480 cubic feet of concrete has
been poured. The remaining 420 feet
will be poured in two weeks. The
bridge must rest twenty days before
being used, during which period the
approaches will be cut and filled.
