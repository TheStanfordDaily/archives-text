# Dawes Welcomed At Town That Expelled Ancestors

### 
SUDBURY, Eng., Oct. 1. (JP) â€”This
ancient Suffolk town which 300 years
ago made things so hot for a Puritan
named Dawes that he fled to wildest
America, turned out today with flags,
smiles, and hearty hospitality to a de
scendant of that self-same Dawes.
The visitor was General Charles G.
Dawes, American ambassador to Great
Britain. He and Mrs. Dawes arrived
by motor car this afternoon and was
met by borough officials who escorted
the ambassador to the town hall where
Mayor Fitzgerald presented him with
the honorary freedom of the borough.
