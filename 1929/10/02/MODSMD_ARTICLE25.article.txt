Forty-nine players escaped the axe
yesterday afternoon, and now com
prise the roster for Pop Warner's
1929 football machine. The squad cut,
which is the first and undoubtedly the
final trimming down of the team for
this season, was announced just be
fore practice.
The squad summary, including nine
ends, eight tackles, ten guards, five
centers, nine halfbacks, four quarter
backs, and four fullbacks, Is as fol
lows:
Left ends —Preston, Worden, Wit
tenau, Craig, K. Albertson.
Left tackles—Artman, Klabau, Er
horn, Burke.
Left guards—Driscoll, Wilson, Hu
len, Reynolds, McLeod.
Centers—Heinecke, Taylor, M. Al
bertson, Mann, Moomaw.
Right guards—Heiser, Dawson, Bar
din, Forster, Ingram.
Right tackles—Tandy, Bogue, Stein
beck, Thompson.
Right ends—Captain Muller, Neill,
Bush, Pike.
Left halfbacks—Frentrup, Moffatt,
Rintala, E. Marks.
Right halfbacks—Rothert, Winnek,
Clark, Caglieri, Laird.
Quarterbacks —Fleishhacker, Crary,
Murphy, W. Marks.
Fullbacks —Smalling, Simkins, Hill
man, Allen.
While those who failed to make the
grade wpnt over to the Goof field and
worked out under Murray Cuddebaek
and Don Robesky, Pop's two assist
ants, the regular charges were put
through a heavy drill in preparation
for the Oregon game on Saturday.
Following a short blackboard ses
sion and signal practice, the second
and third teams were put through an
hour's scrimmage. Special attention
was given to punting and passing, as
protection for kickers and passers
proved to be a glaring weakness
against the hard-charging Olympic
Club line last week. Rudy Rintala,
playing on the third squad, looked
impressive in packing the ball, while
Hillman and Moffatt carried the brunt
of the second team's attack.
Bad luck continued to shadow the
varsity, when Bill Simkins and Johnny
Preston reported to the practice field
on crutches. Each of them have trick
knees, which may keep them out of
the line-up for the next two or three
weeks. Simkins' injury has grown
worse, instead of improving, during
the past few days, so Pop will be
forced to face the Webfooters without
the services of his best passer.
Added to this, Kay and Mar Albert
son are lost to the team for an in
definite period due to a death in the
family.
Thus it won't be on a bed of rosea
when Stanford tangles with Oregon.
The Northerners are coming down to
the Farm this year with a fast, heavy
team, and intend to return home with
a clean-cut victory to their credit.
Last year Oregon lost to the Cards
