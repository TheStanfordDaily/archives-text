# MERIT IN A NEW NAME
## 
### 
We have been, in our day, among the loudest shouters for the main
tenance of those time-worn Stanford traditions which are slowly being
lopped off from year to year by student negligence and faculty contempt.
There is one unofficial tradition here on The Farm, however, which
would be better forgotten. That is the practice of calling the Stanford
Greys the Stanford "Goofs."
It is a small matter, we grant, but any group of men that has enough
enthusiasm and stamina to stand the mental and physical beating under
gone by that squad deserves something better than the name thought
lessly bestowed upon it.
The so-called "goof" works just as hard, labors just as faithfully,
and suffers just as much as any varsity star who hears the cheers of the
crowd and basks in the sunlight of popularity.
And there is another way of looking at the situation. Here at Stan
ford we've become accustomed to being nonchalant about championship
athletic teams these past few years. A place on the Stanford football
varsity is harder to gain than an audience with the Pope. Hidden down
by the military stables there labors on the "goof" practice field every
night many a halfback and a tackle who could be on a varsity team â€”if
they had gone to some other university.
