# RIGHT THIS WAY, "LADEEZ AND GENTULMEN"

While the newcomer to Stanford may believe he is in a Persian mar
ket, judging from the number of venders asking him to subscribe to this
or that, there is one thing 011 which he cannot go wrong, lhat is buying
a season ticket for the annual A.S.S.U. concert series.
The concert series, though often classed under the misnomer of "high
brow" entertainment, was founded on the demand of the students and is
run for them. The management caters to the wishes of the students in
arranging its program, basing its choice 011 the type of entertainment
that proved the most popular during the previous season.
For a nominal sum, those on the campus can hear programs which
would cost triple the amount of a season ticket if given in metropolitan
centers. Such artists as Efrem Zimbalist, violinist, Lawrence Tibbett, the
diminutive baritone who scored such a hit here last year, and the ever
popular San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of
Alfred Hertz, are slated to appear in the Pavilion this season.
So step right this way, ladeez and gentulmen. The season tickets are
going fast but there are a few good seats left.
