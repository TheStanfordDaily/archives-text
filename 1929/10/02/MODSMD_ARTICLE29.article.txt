# THE
						REGISTRATION DAY BOOR
## 
### 
If people could follow their instincts without fear of dire conse
quences, the Stanford Administration building would be turned into a
shambles every registration day.
Because murder does seem justified in the instances of the rough-cut
boors who spring up there every quarter, breaking into lines, butting a
ruthless path through the crowds, and monopolizing the faculty members
time while others are waiting endlessly for his signature.
Some master mind would perform a great service to that section of
humanity which calls itself the Stanford Student Body if it would devise
a code of ethics, morals, and etiquette to govern conduct during the time
of wild-eyed ferment called registration day.
It is the so-called Stanford rough who stands out in this case as a
personification of crudity and discourtesy, but certain of his feminine
compatriots in the 500 are not guiltless.
We stand firmly 011 both feet for the emancipation and uplift of
womanhood —especially Stanford womanhood but we are positive that
there is nothing more maddening than the co-ed who, with a cold and
fishlike stare, breaks in at the window to have her say while dozens of
male sufferers look helplessly on.
