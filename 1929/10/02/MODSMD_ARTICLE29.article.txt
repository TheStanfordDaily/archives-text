# THE 						REGISTRATION DAY BOOR
## 
### 
If people could follow their instincts without fear of dire conse
quences, the Stanford Administration building would be turned into a
shambles every registration day.
Because murder does seem justified in the instances of the rough-cut
boors who spring up there every quarter, breaking into lines, butting a
ruthless path through the crowds, and monopolizing the faculty members
time while others are waiting endlessly for his signature.
Some master mind would perform a great service to that section of
humanity which calls itself the Stanford Student Body if it would devise
a code of ethics, morals, and etiquette to govern conduct during the time
of wild-eyed ferment called registration day.
It is the so-called Stanford rough who stands out in this case as a
personification of crudity and discourtesy, but certain of his feminine
compatriots in the 500 are not guiltless.
We stand firmly 011 both feet for the emancipation and uplift of
womanhood â€”especially Stanford womanhood but we are positive that
there is nothing more maddening than the co-ed who, with a cold and
fishlike stare, breaks in at the window to have her say while dozens of
male sufferers look helplessly on.
