# THAT BUSINESS STAFF
## 
### 
Tryouts for the business staff of this erst-while sheet have been called
by the Business Manager, Hal Terwilliger. While it has been a tradition
for the editorial side to remain coldly aloof from those who keep the
moneys, we will relax a few moments and give the business side a chance
to break into print.
The women tryoutees work for one year, attending to the general of
fice work, typing, and handling subscriptions and classified ads. There
are two salaried junior positions, classified ad manager and merchandising
manager. One of these is chosen as office manager, a senior salaried
position in charge of the entire office work, bookkeeping and corre
spondence.
For those freshmen who desire to become big butter and egg men later
on, special work has been designed this year. They sell and collect ad
vertisements and spend a certain amount of time haranguing the editorial
staff. This latter is absolutely necessary if they would gain favor with
the big boss. Eight sophomores are chosen as managers. For those who
are looking for the financial gains to be reaped from the Daily coffers
there are two salaried positions open to the juniors, Palo Alto and San
Francisco advertising managers. One of these, if he can make three
nickels come out of a dime, eventually becomes business manager. Nuff
said!
