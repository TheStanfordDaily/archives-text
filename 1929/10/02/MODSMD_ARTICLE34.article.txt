A fond illusion spoiled the revival
of "After Dark," closing its run this
week at the Geary Theatre. The pro
ducers (sly fellows!) knew that the
old melodrama would be the most
ridiculous sort of comedy today. Ergo,
they hired a company of tyros and
tried to kid the old play to death.
They failed, in spite of the superla
tives! that have been wasted by your
co-ed friend, who thought it was
"simply killing."
"After Dark," as revived at the
Geary, was a flop as far as we were
concerned. Worse, it was a sickening
disappointment. To one whose laughs
at old plays are based on a secret love
tor their amusing claptrap, the Geary
company's interpretation was —frank-
ly—lousy.
They knew the lines, situations, and
characters were a riot today. But they
failed to digest the fact that "After
Dark" would have been much funnier
if played straight 1868.
You say it WAS. Hooey. The Geary
production was a weak burlesque —a
jeer at the old play not justified by
its own performance.
To one who had seen the Berkeley
Playhouse's revival of "The Drunk
ard; or the Fallen Saved," "After
Dark" was, though a professional
show compared to an amateur, an
amateurish as compared to a profes
sional treatment. Even the Berkeley
players stepped over the bonds of
legitimate travesty.
But the Geary company went TOO
far. It may be all right to have your
tongue in your cheek, but it shouldn't
look like a lollypop.
The producers failed to realize that
tad acting is never very funny, and
so two or three performances in the
play are quite inexcusable.

The veteran, Del Lawrence, who
plays Chandos Bellingham, alias the
arch fiend Richard Knatchbull, is ob
viously a good performer. But he bur
lesques his role and nearly ruins it.
He ought to have known better.
But Ed Beach, who played naturally
as Old Tom, was good. His laughs
were legitimate. Almost as much may
be said for "the good man," Gordon
Cliumley, played by Frank Wilcox.
Lou Hollinger's Yiddish sketch of
Dicey Morris was in the old comedy
style, and Margaret O'Brien's bit as
Rose Edgerton was pleasant.
The juveniles were downright bad.
Robert Elton as the young George
Medhurst was inexcusably weak, and
Priscilla Page in the leading role of
Eliza, "Neither Maid, Wife, nor
Widow," adopted a whining voice and
a namby-pamby manner that was not
even the "clinging vine" cartoon that
it doubtless intended to be.
The "sensational fight to a finish,"
of the stage effects, was best with
two welters giving each other a most
realistic pummeling. One could see
how the great Railroad Tunnel scene,
with the hero tied to the track in front
of the onrushing Monster, could have
been vastly effective in its day. The
Dive from the Wharf to save Eliza
was done in the Mack Sennett man
ner.
But —a paradox—we enjoyed "After
Dark." The old songs, though dragged
in by the heels, were heart-warming,
and the chance to see an old melo
drama, however produced, is too rare
to miss.
But the Geary production passed up
its real comedy chance, that's all.
The son of the author of "After
Dark," Dion Boucicault, died recently.
Might not this revival have been a
contributing cause?
