# LASHLEY LECTURES PSYCHOLOGY GROUP ON BRAIN RESEARCH
## Stanford Professors Take an Active Part in Big Meeting at Yale 
### 
The revolutionizing of present con
cepts of psychology and neurology
was indicated in the lectures given
by Dr. K. S. Lashley, President of the
American Psychological Association,
before the Ninth International Con
gress of Psychology, held at Yale Uni
versity in September.
Dr. Lashley spoke on his researches
on monkeys, extrapating certain areas
of their brains in order to observe the
effect on their behavior. His results
seem to indicate that the brain acts
as a mass rather than in sections.
When a section of the brain was re
moved, the behavior of the monkeys
was temporarily affected, but the
other parts of the brain soon assumed
its duties.
Many Stanford professors were
present at the convention. Dr. Walter
Miles gave several lectures; Dr. J. E.
Coover, Dr. C. P. Stone, and Dr. T. L.
Kelley each lectured once. Dr. P. R.
Farnsworth was present, as were Dr.
Robert Seashore and Dr. Michotte of
the Stanford summer staff. Two
graduate students in the Psychology
Department, Quinn McNemar and S.
K. Chou, attended the Congress. Dr.
Terman, although scheduled to speak,
was unable to attend.
There were four former Stanford
students on the program, and at least
eight were present.
