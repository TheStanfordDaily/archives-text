# HORNSBY AND FOXX TO STAR IN COMING "BIG SERIES" GAME
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 1 (/P)—Discus
sion of the infields to match strength
in the World Series throws the spot
light on two opposing players stand
ing out in bold relief —Hornsby of the
Cubs and Foxx of the Athletics
One is at the height of a great
career and the other standing on the
threshold. Hornsby is the Cubs' lead
ing hitter and an inspirational player
with few equals. Foxx led the Ameri
can League hitting for most of the
season's play at one position.
Foxx is regarded as a better bats
man than Grimm, who will play first
base for the Cubs in the series after
a six weeks' absence from the game
on account of injuries, but the Cub
veteran is the better fielder. Foxx has
many things to learn about the fine
art of first base play. Grimm will
have the distinction of being the only
left-handed batsman in the Cub line
up.
Hornsby should outhit Bishop, the
Athletics' second sacker, more than
100 points on the basis of their sea
son's work, but here the fielding ad
vantage will rest with the American
League. Hornsby is an adequate de
fensive baseman, but Bishop at times
is an extraordinary performer.
