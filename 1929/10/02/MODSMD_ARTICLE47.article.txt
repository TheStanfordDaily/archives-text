# LEGIONNAIRES FROLIC WHILE LOUISVILLE HAS FIRE EPIDEMIC
## 
### 
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 1. (>P) â€”Ten
fire alarms last night in Louisville's
downtown business district, in the
area restricted for use of frolicking
Legionnaires here for the national
convention, caused fire department
and police officials to express the
opinion today that pyromaniacs were
at work.
Five firemen were injured in the
worst of the flames, which caused
damage estimated at more than
$15,000 to a women's apparel store.
The origin was undetermined here,
but several of the other fires started
in piles of waste paper, and police,
who started an investigation, were
convinced these were of incendiary
origin.
Hundreds of visiting Legionnaires
and the crowds that joined in their
fun and noise-making rolled back in
solid waves as the apparatus made
run after run.
