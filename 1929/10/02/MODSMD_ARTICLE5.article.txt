Five big headline events are prom
ised members of the Stanford com
munity this winter by the manage
ment of the A.S.S.U. concert series.
Ignaz Friedman, famous Polish pian
ist, who appeared in a concert here
two years ago, will be the featured
soloist with the San Francicsco Sym
phony Orchestra in the opening con
cert of the series December 4.
Efrem Zimbalist, Russian violinist,
who needs no introduction to music
lovers, will be the artist for the sec
ond concert of the series. He is said
to have one of the most valuable col
lections of violins in the world, in
cluding one acquired two years ago
at a cost of $33,000.
Lawrence Tibbett, baritone of the
Metropolitan Opera Company, has
been secured for a return engagement
this year. The fact that Tibbett's con
cert time on the Pacific Coast has
been solidly booked attests to his
popularity. His will be the third con
cert of the series.
Mme. Sigrid Onegin, contralto, who
has appeared in title roles in Carmen
and other operas, will give the fourth
concert of the year, and the Kedroff
quartette, Russian vocalists well
known here, will give the concluding
concert of the series. The last four
concerts will be given during the win

Season tickets for the series went
on sale yesterday, and for the remain
der of the week will be at the A.S.S.U.
office at the Old Union.
Student rates for the five concerts
