# U.S. Park Service Opposes Bridging Of Grand Canyon
## 
### 
The problem of an automobile road
across the Grand Canyon is discussed
by "one who knows" in "Grand Can
yon Country," by Mr. Tillotson, Super
intendent of the Grand Canyon Na
tional Park.
"The National Park Service is
strongly opposed to the much-dis
cussed Rim-to-Rim Highway," de
clares Superintendent Tillotson. "It
feels that a highway across the park
would destroy the majesty of tho
Grand Canyon. To break the age-old
silonce of the Canyon with the honk
ing of horns, to carve roadways into
its formidable walls, to impair the
normal impregnability of Nature, to
make it easy for anyone to conquer
the Grand Canyon, that would bo
sacrilegious indeed."
