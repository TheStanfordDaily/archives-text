## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 1.
tion was officially begun today of the
old Waldorf Astoria at 34th Street
and Fifth Avenue, long one of the
most famous hotels in the world.
Former Governor Alfred E. Smith,
who is president of a company that
will erect the world's tallest building
on the site, stood on the roof and
pulled a rope that toppled off a sec
tion of the cornice.
This was the official commencement
of demolition, but in fact much of the
work of destruction insido tho build
j ing has already been done.
