WASHINGTON, Oct. 1. (/P)â€”'The ex
tremely complicated questions of pre
cedence involved in the ceremonial
functions which will attend the visit
here of Prime Minister Mac Donald
seemed today to have been answered
; to the satisfaction of everybody di
rectly concerned.
As a result, Washington society
was assured today that any embarras
sing revival, during the distinguished
visitor's stay, of the controversy over
the rank of Mrs. Edward Everett
Gann, sister and official hostess of the
Vice-President, had been made ex
tremely unlikely, the hip question,
who would sit next to whom at the
White House dinner, having been
settled.
