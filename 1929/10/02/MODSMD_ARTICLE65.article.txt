SITKA, Alaska, Oct. 1. (/P)â€”The
four Russian aviators flying the mono
plane "Land of the Soviets" were to
spend another day in Sitka after de
ciding late yesterday to cancel a
scheduled Imp early today for Seattle,
700 miles south. They will probably
take off for the Washington city to
morrow if weather conditions are fa
vorable. They arrived here Sunday
from Seward.
