# PERCE, FURGASON, ALLEN, IN FIRST OF SERIES OF RECITALS
## 
### 
Moussorgsky's '-Pictures from an
Exhibition," arranged for the organ,
seemed the most expressive nnmber
in the first of the Tuesday evening
series presented last night in Me
morial Church by Elizabeth Pierce,
violinist, Waldo Purgason, baritone,
and Warren D. Allen, organist. This
series of selections interprets a num
ber of pictures—a heavy-wheeled
wagon drawn by oxen, children in the
garden of the Tuileries, the cata
combs, a wealthy Jew and a poor and
shivering Jew, and the great gate of
Kieff —with unusual color.
"Adagio" by Franz Ries, a violin
solo, in its slow measure showed to
particular advantage the exceptionally
smooth and rich tones of the instru
ment in the hands of Elizabeth Pierce.
In the lower ranges the violinist drew
from her violin the warmth of tone
usually associated with the cello. Miss
Pierce also played "Intrada," a plain
tive minor melody by Desplanes-
Nachez, and "Minuet," by Haydn-
Friedberg.
"The Builder," and the negro spirit
ual "Deep River," well-known favo
rites by Cadman, were sung by Waldo
Furgason. The baritone also sang "I
Himmelen, i himmelen," a melodious
Norwegian folk-song, and Handel's
arie, "Where'er You Walk" from the
oratorio "Semele." This last number
was an excellent vehicle for Furga
son's full, easy voice.
