Welcome I
WE'RE GLAI) to see everyone back
for the Fall. The renewal of old
friendships and the opportunity to
form new acquaintances has made us
look forward to seeing the boys return to
the "farm."
Don't forget to come in to see us when
you're looking up some of the old gang.
Chances are you'll find them here, bulling
about the football situation and looking
over the new importations of fall styles.
If you are here at Stanford for the first
time we invite you to drop in and browse
around in our unique shop. You'll enjoy
the cordial atmosphere that has made
Phelps-Terkel the Stanford men's most
popular rendezvous.
