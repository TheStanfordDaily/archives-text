# M'NAB TO HELP HOOVER REMEDY BOOZE PROBLEMS
## San Francisco Lawyer Will Have No Connection With Enforcement Commission "Patriotic Duty" to Aid Chief Executive in Reaching an Answer to Rum Troubles 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 2 (/P).—
As a patriotic duty of a private citizen,
John L. McNab, San Francisco lawyer,
lias undertaken, at the request of Presi
dent Hoover, the difficult task of formu
lating legislation to hring about better
prohibition enforcement and relief of
court congestion.
Mr. McNab has no official connection
with the government, but was urged by
Secretary Mellon, Attorney General 1
Mitchell, and Chairman Wickersham of
the law enforcement commission, as well
as the President, to draft legislation for
submission to Congress in December that
would centralize prohibition enforcement
under the Justice Department.
Although describing it as a "burden,"
lie said lie felt it was his patriotic duty
because no one "who has caught the
spirit of the President on his ardent
desire to make this country a law-abid
ing nation could, for a moment, hesitate
to take up this task."
The abuses which have accompanied
enforcement of the dry law have brought
the act into "unmerited disrepute," he
believes, and have broken down the legal
machinery through the clogging of the
courts.
Long a friend of the chief executive,
and a guest since Monday at the White
House, he regards the reforms suggested
by the President as sadly needed and has
undertaken his task with the reservation
that he will receive no compensation or
reward. He will have at his disposal
the findings of the enforcement com
mission.
"It must be understood," he said, "that
these reforms do not concern alone the
enforcement of the laws in support of
the Eighteenth Amendment. The pro
posal looks to the relief of the courts
from their present congestion.
"The abuses which have undeniably ac
companied the enforcement of the dry
law have brought that act into unmerited
disrepute.
"The legal machinery of the country
has broken under the strain. Courts have
been clogged, abuses have arisen, and
practices have developed which call for
definite reform.
"That reform, the President proposes,
shall be prompt and effective.
"Congress will convene December 10.
By that time it is hoped that a definite
plan with drafts of necessary laws will
be ready for submission.
"Such is the wish of the President,
and to the fulfillment of that wish I
shall devote my fullest energy."

and to the fulfillment of that wish I
shall devote my fullest energy."
WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 2 (/P).—
As a patriotic duty of a private citizen,
John L. McNab, San Francisco lawyer,
lias undertaken, at the request of Presi
dent Hoover, the difficult task of formu
lating legislation to hring about better
prohibition enforcement and relief of
court congestion.
Mr. McNab has no official connection
with the government, but was urged by
Secretary Mellon, Attorney General 1
Mitchell, and Chairman Wickersham of
the law enforcement commission, as well
as the President, to draft legislation for
submission to Congress in December that
would centralize prohibition enforcement
under the Justice Department.
Although describing it as a "burden,"
lie said lie felt it was his patriotic duty
because no one "who has caught the
spirit of the President on his ardent
desire to make this country a law-abid
ing nation could, for a moment, hesitate
to take up this task."
The abuses which have accompanied
enforcement of the dry law have brought
the act into "unmerited disrepute," he
believes, and have broken down the legal
machinery through the clogging of the
courts.
Long a friend of the chief executive,
and a guest since Monday at the White
House, he regards the reforms suggested
by the President as sadly needed and has
undertaken his task with the reservation
that he will receive no compensation or
reward. He will have at his disposal
the findings of the enforcement com
mission.
"It must be understood," he said, "that
these reforms do not concern alone the
enforcement of the laws in support of
the Eighteenth Amendment. The pro
posal looks to the relief of the courts
from their present congestion.
"The abuses which have undeniably ac
companied the enforcement of the dry
law have brought that act into unmerited
disrepute.
"The legal machinery of the country
has broken under the strain. Courts have
been clogged, abuses have arisen, and
practices have developed which call for
definite reform.
"That reform, the President proposes,
shall be prompt and effective.
"Congress will convene December 10.
By that time it is hoped that a definite
plan with drafts of necessary laws will
be ready for submission.
"Such is the wish of the President,
and to the fulfillment of that wish I
shall devote my fullest energy."
