# Y.M.C.A. ESTABLISHED IN NEW QUARTERS AT OLD STANFORD UNION
## 
### 
Through the courtesy of the Board
of Directors of the Stanford Union,
the Y.M.C.A. has secured new quar
ters in the lobby of the Men's Union.
Office space has been provided in one
corner set off by a half-height glass
enclosed partition.
Contributions of the Association's
funds have made it possible to refur
nish the room in an attractive and
comfortable manner. The new ar
rangement provides a place where
students may write, and read the cur
rent periodicals and books provided;
lectures and other forms of entertain
ment will be conducted throughout
the year. The advantages offered by
the organization are open to all men
and should be of special interest to
students living off the campus. Mem
bership in the "Y" is on an interest
basis rather than a paid fee.
Student organizations may sched
ule the room for meetings provided
arrangements are made in advance
at the Y.M.C.A. office. The room will
be under the supervision of a joint
committee of the directors of the
Union and the Young Men's Christian
Association.
Professor-Emeritus R. L. Green has
been re-elected to the Y.M.C.A. Board
of Directors.
