# SPORTS OF 1929
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
Long Island, New York, was the
scene of two widely different sporting
events on Saturday afternoon, Sep
tember 14, each of which crowned a
champion for the year 1929. One was
a battle of youth, the other a fight be
tween two veterans. Both winners
came through in true championship
style, coming from behind to win, and
leaving no doubt in the minds of the
spectators that they were the best in
the field.
William Tilden, the 2nd, of Phila
delphia, in winning the United States
lawn tennis singles title, which he
had held previously for six consecu
tive seasons (1920-25) not only made
a successful comeback at an age when
athletes are considered somewhat old
and feeble, but also easily proved
himself more popular in his return to
the top than Helen Wills did in her
recent all-conquering campaign.
Whichone, Harry Payne Whitney's
gallant two-year-old thoroughbred
colt, in winning the fortieth running
of the historic Futurity at Belmont
Park at six and three-quarter fur
longs, proved his right to be ranked
as the best juvenile race-horse of
1929, and one of the best two-year

olds of all time.
The statistics of the two events
were:
Tilden beat his old pal and play
mate, Frank Hunter, 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2,
6-4, while Wliiehone, carrying 125
pounds, beat his old pal and stable
mate, Boojum (who finished fourth)
by five lengths, in 1:19 3-5, just three
fifths of a second behind the record
established by High Strung in 1928.
If the high-strung Mr. Tilden had had
to carry 125 pounds, he would not
have lasted the first set, much less
have equaled the record of seven vic
tories held by Dick Sears and Bill
Larned. As it was, Frank Hunter was
as much of an also-ran as Boojum,
and he had only two legs to "also
run" on, too!
