# ENCINA SCENE OF AQUATIC SPORTS AS '32, '33 MIX
## Biggest Fight in Years Turns Hall into Lake as Onlookers Grin Action Under Way to Bring Guilty Rioters Before Trialâ€”Henderson 
### Philip Space 
What Sherman called war broke
loose at Encina Hall last night.
How the general would have loved
to have been there! The entire Class
of '33 had stood around for two hours;
it didn't look as though anything
would happen. But before the peace
ful campus chimes had struck eleven,
the hall was in an uproar.
No one could find any sophomores,
but the frosh managed to fight among
themselves until the sophs showed up.
By the time the diligent Class of
'33 had found a large body of sopho
mores roaming around on the third
floor, things were beginning to hum.
Soon the affair was at its height.
A lake of water as large as Lagu
nita at high tide formed in the lobby.
Finally the strain became too much
for the upperclassmen and a crowd
of sponsors, other athletes, and be
corded individuals shoved the Frosh
out the door to the lawn where the
mess continued.
Various of the fighters were ren
dered hors-d'-combat by the removal
of their clothing, but several of them
voted to continue the fight. They did
so. It made a colorful picture. The
happy group mingled with curses,
both sides confident that they had
won the fight. The upperclassmen are
of the opinion, however, that the Ad
ministration had won, since they
tacked a $10 breakage fee on resi
dents of Encina Hall for the first time
this quarter.
The freshmen repaired to the hall
and endeavored to clean up the mess
after the fracas was over.
Tired but happy, the whole kaboodle
retired to trundle beds, cheerful in
the thought that they had lived in
1908 for a night.
