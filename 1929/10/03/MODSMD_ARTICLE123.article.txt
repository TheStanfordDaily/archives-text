S.S. BERENGARIA, Oct. 2. (IP)â€”
Prime Minister Ramsay Mac Donald
and his daughter, Miss Ishbel, enroute
from Great Britain for a conference
with President Hoover, have proved
to be good sailors.
Various members of the British
suite have hardly emerged from their
cabins, victims of seasickness, but
the Premier and his daughter have
not shown the faintest traces of the
malady, both, indeed, with their walk
ing and Miss Ishbel's dancing, being
among the most active persons
aboard.
Mr. Mac Donald yesterday afternoon
paid a brief visit to the sun deck
where he played shuffleboard with
Robert G. Vansittart and W. L. Craigie
of his staff. "I had a great game," he
remarked as he descended.
