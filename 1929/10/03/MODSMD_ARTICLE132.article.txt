## 
### 
SPOKANE, Wash., Oct. 2. (/P)â€”The
offered a set of resolutions endorsing
President Hoover's proposal to ap
point a commission to study the pub
lic lauds question, but viewing "with
apprehension" the President's idea of
having the Federal Government re
tain the mineral rigths.
Many of the nearly 600 delegates
had expressed the thought that the
subsurface rights on public lands
should not be separated from the sur
face rights, which include grazing,
timber, and similar rights. President
Hoover's letter to the Governor's
meeting at Salt Lake City had sug
gested possible transfer of surface
rights only to the states in which
public lands were located.
Dr. F. A. Thomson, Butte, Nev.,
Mont., president of the Montana
School Mines, said that if the min
eral and surface rights were handled
by different governments, a new prin
ciple of mineral law would have to be
established, with great confusion and
damage to the mining industry.
