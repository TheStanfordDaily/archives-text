# DAILY REPORTS WIDEOPEN FALL TRYOUTS FOR NEW REPORTERS
## Openings for Freshmen and Upperclassmen, New And Old Students 
### 
Daily editorial tryouts, which will
be open to both freshmen and trans
fers, will begin Monday. The first part
of the tryout period will be devoted
to exercises in Bimple newswriting, to
general office work, and to observa
tion of editorial methods. After a cer
tain period, regular "beats" will be
assigned. The final selection of new
members of the editorial staff will be
made according to the amount of time
spent in office work, the quality of
work done, the reliability and the at
titude of the tryoutee.
When he is first taken on, he is a
reporter, with routine duties. Promo
tion, however, is often swift, and the
reporter rises to copy editor, in which
role he reads copy, writes "heads,"
and generally assists the night editor.
From copy editor, he graduates to
night editor, and as audi, is entirely
responsible for the publication of one
paper a week. From the five night
editors are chosen two associate edi
tors and a women's editor. And from
the two associate editors (who assist
the editor and oversee the prepara
tion of the "dummy") is chosen the
editor, who determines the policy of
the paper and "runs things" in gen
eral.
While no experience is necessary
to enter the tryouts, junior college
transfers should not feel that their
third-year standing will act as a han
dicap. Experience on junior college
papers will be taken into considera
tion. Students, also, who are inter
ested in other branches of writing
than straight news, will find good
opportunities on the editorial staff of
the Daily. Openings are to be found
for reviewers, columnists, and feature
writers of all kinds; and, as in the
reportorial branch, no previous ex
perience is necessary to enter the
tryouts with these phases of journal
ism in view.
