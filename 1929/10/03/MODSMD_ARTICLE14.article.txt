# Senate, By 47 To 42 Vote, Defeats Flexible Tariff
## Republican Plan Set Aside as Congress Is Restored Emergency Power 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 2 (#>).—
The Senate today ran counter to the
wishes of President Hoover and adopted,
by a vote of 47 to 42, a Democratic plan
restoring to Congress the power to enact
emergency tariff rates now enjoyed by
the executive.
The proposal, a substitute for that of
fered by the Finance Committee Repub
licans, would change the fiexihle tariff
policy adopted by the Republicans seven
years ago and make Congress instead of
the President the final arbiter of the
findings of the Tariff Commission. As a
safeguard against general revision, it
would limit congressional action to the
rate or rates dealt with in the commis
sion's reports.
Upsetting the Republican administra
tion majority in the first major test on
the tariff bill in the Senate, a combina
tion of Democrats and Republican inde
pendents, which is fighting the measure,
showed it had the votes to write its own
bill if the coalition remains intact.
Headed by Senators Borah, Idaho, and
Norris, Nebraska, thirteen Republicans
joined thirty-four Democrats in over
riding the President.
It was the third time this session that
an almost identical lineup in the Senate
had voted down an expressed wish of the
new executive. The other two occasions
were in votes on putting the export de
benture plan in the farm bill.
Senator Johnson, Republican, Califor
nia, opened the debate on the flexible
proposition.
