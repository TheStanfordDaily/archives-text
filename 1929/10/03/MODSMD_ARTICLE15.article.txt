# NEW TECHNICIAN OF STANFORD DRAMATICS PRAISES UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
"Stanford certainly is different from
the eastern schools that I am accustomed
to, but I am very much pleased with it.
In fact, I don't see how anyone could
dislike it."
Thus commented Frederick Stover,
newly appointed technical director for
Stanford dramatics, after a brief tour
of the campus yesterday afternoon. Sto
ver came directly from the East after
learning of his appointment less than a
week ago. This is the first time he has
ever been on the west coast.
"There is an air of informality and
newness about Stanford that distin
guishes it definitely from Yale and other
eastern colleges," Stover continued.
After hastily inspecting the Assembly
Hall and stage with its equipment, he
said that it was not nearly as bad as it
had been represented to him and he was
very favorably impressed by the large
size of the stage itself.
Stover was a classmate of Helven
ston's in 1927-28 in George Pierce Ba
ker's dramatic school at Yale, where he
studied design and costuming under Don
ald Mitchell and Owen Slagger.
He worked on such shows there as
"Parade" by Elain Ryan and "Finished"
by Catherine Klugston, which was later
produced on Broadway under the name
of "Three Days."
During the summer for the last two
years he has taught costuming and de
sign along with technical matter at the
Breadlof School of English and Play
Production at Middlebury, Vermont.
Stover has already started planning the
sets for "The Ivory Door" and is also
registering students, in Theatre Work
shop, a course which he will teach this
quarter.
