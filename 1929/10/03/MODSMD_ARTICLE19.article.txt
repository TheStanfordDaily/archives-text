# Lung Poisoning Price Stanford 'Medic' Pass For Bacteria Studies

Harold I). Chope, *26, Stanford med
ical student, la now suffering from an
infection of the lungs which will prob
ably prove fatal—an infection con
tracted in his laboratory work at
Lane Hospital in San Francisco.
Chope has been doing research
work at the medical school under Dr.
William Ophuls, noted pathologist,
and Dr. Ernest C. Dickson, specialist
in food poisonings and the growth of
molds. About three months ago, he
was assigned the study of the cocci
diocica granuloma, a vegetable para
site rather similar to bread mold,
which was discovered and isolated by
Dr. Ophuls in 1901. While pursuing
his research Chope, in spite of his
mask, inhaled some of the spores of
this bacillus which is capable of in
finite multiplication. Within about
three weeks he was conscious of his
illness and made his own diagnosis.
He had X-rays made and took them
to his chiefs, Dr. Ophuls and Dr.
Dickson. Their answer, when they saw
the vegetable film which had spread
within his lungs was: "This patient
is suffering from the disease caused
by the coccidiodica granuloma."
This lung infection, the symptoms
of which are very similar to those of
tuberculosis, is found in almost all
parts of the world; but since Dr.
Ophuls' discovery and isolation of it
in 1901, little research had been con
ducted on this subject until Chope's
tragic contraction of the parasite.
