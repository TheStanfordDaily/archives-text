# CARDINAL TEAM HIT BY INJURIES AS GAME HEARS
## Simkins and Smalling Both Out of Play Indefinitely With Injuries; Wilson Out Webfeet Have Strong Line, Two Triple Threat Men in Backfield Says Winterburn 
### Stephen Dietrich 
With Hill Simkins and Johnny Pres
ton definitely out of the lineup, Stan
ford's big football varsity will find
itself hard-pressed to stop the Oregon
invasion here Saturday.
According to Dr. E. F. Roth yester
day afternoon, neither of the players,
both of whom have knee injuries, will
be able to play for several weeks. It
is quite probable that Simkins will
remain on the sidelines until the
U.S.C. game.
Another player has been added to
the injured list in the person of El
wood Wilson, second-string guard.
Wilson sustained a clout over his left
eye during Tuesday's scrimmage, and
will be laid up for at least the remain
der of this week.
Coach Warner began tapering off
his workouts yesterday, putting his
charges through a light dummy scrim
mage, following signal practice. Light
signal workouts will be in order to
day and tomorrow.
As for the Oregon invasion, the
Webfooters are coming down from the
Northwest this week fully expecting
to upset the Cards. Coach McEwau
has a team composed of heavy, hard
charging veterans, and they have
much better than an outside chance
to trip up the Stanford squad in its
march to the top of the Coast Con
ference.
The lemon-yellow team, already
acknowledged as the best in the
Pacific Northwest, has been pointing
for the Stanford game since practice
opened. Last year the Cards man
aged to down Oregon 26 to 12, but
at that time it was a green squad,
sadly lacking in reserve strength, that
faced the Redshirts. The situation is
just the reverse this season, and Ore
gon holds high hopes of reversing the
score.
The outstanding back on McEwan's
team is Kitzmiller, better known as
the "Flying Dutchman." He is a capa
ble triple-threat man, a great inter
ferer, and a powerful defensive player.
Besides running the team at quarter
back, Kitzmiller does most of the
team's kicking—and he does it well,
getting good distances on most of his
boots as well as placing the ball
where he wants.
Among the other Oregon ball pack
ers is Robinson, colored triple-threat
ace with two years' varsity experi
ence. Moeller, at fullback, does most
of the line plunging. Against Pacific
last week he reeled off all kinds of
yardage. He may find the going a lit
tle tougher Saturday, with
Fleishhacker, Rothert, Smalling, and
Hillman backing up the line.
Coach Winterburn, who scouted the
Oregon-Pacific game, reports that the
Webfooters possess a strong line with
lots of capable reserves. The team
boasts of six tackles weighing over
200 pounds each, who are expected by
McEwan to mess up a majority of
Stanford's reserves and spin plays.
Added to this is Stadlcman, one of
the best centers in the country. He is
a big, beefy fellow with plenty of
speed, and will keep Heinecke's hands
full in bowling him out of the way.
The starting lineups will be an
nounced in tomorrow's issue.

day and tomorrow.
As for the Oregon invasion, the
Webfooters are coming down from the
Northwest this week fully expecting
to upset the Cards. Coach McEwau
has a team composed of heavy, hard
charging veterans, and they have
much better than an outside chance
to trip up the Stanford squad in its
march to the top of the Coast Con
ference.
The lemon-yellow team, already
acknowledged as the best in the
Pacific Northwest, has been pointing
for the Stanford game since practice
opened. Last year the Cards man
aged to down Oregon 26 to 12, but
at that time it was a green squad,
sadly lacking in reserve strength, that
faced the Redshirts. The situation is
just the reverse this season, and Ore
gon holds high hopes of reversing the
score.
The outstanding back on McEwan's
team is Kitzmiller, better known as
the "Flying Dutchman." He is a capa
ble triple-threat man, a great inter
ferer, and a powerful defensive player.
Besides running the team at quarter
back, Kitzmiller does most of the
team's kicking—and he does it well,
getting good distances on most of his
boots as well as placing the ball
where he wants.
Among the other Oregon ball pack
ers is Robinson, colored triple-threat
ace with two years' varsity experi
ence. Moeller, at fullback, does most
of the line plunging. Against Pacific
last week he reeled off all kinds of
yardage. He may find the going a lit
tle tougher Saturday, with
Fleishhacker, Rothert, Smalling, and
Hillman backing up the line.
Coach Winterburn, who scouted the
Oregon-Pacific game, reports that the
Webfooters possess a strong line with
lots of capable reserves. The team
boasts of six tackles weighing over
200 pounds each, who are expected by
McEwan to mess up a majority of
Stanford's reserves and spin plays.
Added to this is Stadlcman, one of
the best centers in the country. He is
a big, beefy fellow with plenty of
speed, and will keep Heinecke's hands
full in bowling him out of the way.
The starting lineups will be an
nounced in tomorrow's issue.
With Hill Simkins and Johnny Pres
ton definitely out of the lineup, Stan
ford's big football varsity will find
itself hard-pressed to stop the Oregon
invasion here Saturday.
According to Dr. E. F. Roth yester
day afternoon, neither of the players,
both of whom have knee injuries, will
be able to play for several weeks. It
is quite probable that Simkins will
remain on the sidelines until the
U.S.C. game.
Another player has been added to
the injured list in the person of El
wood Wilson, second-string guard.
Wilson sustained a clout over his left
eye during Tuesday's scrimmage, and
will be laid up for at least the remain
der of this week.
Coach Warner began tapering off
his workouts yesterday, putting his
charges through a light dummy scrim
mage, following signal practice. Light
signal workouts will be in order to
day and tomorrow.
