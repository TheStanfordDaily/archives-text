# THAT SO-CALLED "FIELD OF GLORY"
## 
### 
With England's Ramsay Mac Donald on the high seas, bound for
Washington and a conference that may lead to certain steps toward ulti
mate world peace, more than the usual interest is manifest by Americans
in the ultimate outlawry of war.
That is good. It is also good that the Kellogg-Briand pact has thus
far withstood the strain and stress of criticism and of the Chino-Slav
rift. These things may point to a new era of pacific international rela
tions. Those of an optimistic turn have hopes.
This world's history, however, shows that men have made pacts, and
have held conferences since the beginning of time, while killing and strife
have continued with hardly a pause. Will the League of Nations, the
Kellogg Pact, and Mac Donald's voyage go down likewise as fruitless
moves? The answer to that question lies in the mass of humanity of
which cannon fodder is made. The human element must be considered..
If mankind is disinterested it will be led into conflict.
This human element has been touched by an ex-German soldier who
wrote a book called "All Quiet on the Western Front." This book has
been read by hundreds of thousands in Europe and America. Without
reference to its literary merit, one may call this volume truly great. It
has touched humanity as no league or pact could ever touch it.
While it is quite likely that a majority of those in this intellectual
community have read this sensational piece of writing, it seems worth
while to urge the others to do so at once. It will be the university man
of today or tomorrow who dies on the next field of glory. If he sees
just what that means, there will never be another "field of glory."
