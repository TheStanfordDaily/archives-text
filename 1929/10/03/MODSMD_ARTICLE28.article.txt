# FLOODS, RAINFALL DO WIDESPREAD DAMAGE IN NORTH CAROLINA
## 
### 
CHARLOTTE, N.C., Oct. 2 (/P).â€”
The two Carolinas were faced today with
prospects of one of the most widespread
floods since 1916. Rivers throughout the
two states were rising rapidly in the
wake of uninterrupted heavy rainfall
since Monday.
Following the general rainfall of from
five to nine inches, reports of highway
washouts, train schedules halted, and
damage to telephone and telegraph facili
ties were being received today.
The crest of the rise in the rivers was
not in sight, notwithstanding the fact
that the rain had stopped today and the
sun made its first appearance in most
places since Monday.
High winds accompanied the rain, and
lashed the sea over the sea walls at Beau
fort. S.C., to such an extent that wharfs
were washed away. Further west in
South Carolina, damage to communica
tion lines by the winds was reported.
