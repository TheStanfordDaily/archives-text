VENTURA, Oct. 2. (/P)—This tells
of roast venison cooked, ready to eat,

W. B. Rathwell, oil geologist, and
party were charting the country
around Sulphur Mountain, near here,
just after it had been burned over by
a forest firo. Late in the day all hands
■were hungry, having had no noon
meal.
They came upon the charred body
of a deer in a clean shale crevice.
The deer had been killed and roasted
almost to order by the forest fire.
The men "fell to" with their knives
and Rathwell declared it was the best
venison he had tasted.
