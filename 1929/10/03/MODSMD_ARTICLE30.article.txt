# Faculty Reception Tonight At President's Announced
## 
### 
Acting President and Mrs. Swain wish
to announce a reception to the faculty
from 8:30 to 11:00 p.m. at the Presi
dent's house on Lagunita Knoll. As no
individual invitations have been sent out
through the mails, all members of the
faculty—including emeritus faculty—and
their wives are asked to consider this
notice as an invitation to attend.
