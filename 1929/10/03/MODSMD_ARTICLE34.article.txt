"THE INNOCENTS" AT HOME
Those who wished "climb up on my
knee, Sonny Boy" were a woodshed
fact instead of a song phrase during
the Recent Rage no doubt got a great
thrill out of hearing Maurice Cheva
lier croon "ev'ry little breeze seems
to whisper Louise" by the time "The
Innocents of Paris" got around to
Palo Alto.
But aside from Chevalier, we fail
to see how they could have raved
about the picture. "The Innocents of
Paris" ran some months in San Fran
cisco, but so did "Easy for Zee Zee."
Not that the two resemble each
other. Chevalier's picture is something
you could take your grandmother to
see. It pleased an uncritical public
that has taken to the "talkies" as a
child takes to a red fire engine. The
Juggernaut snorts and roars most
amazingly.
Our memory of "The Innocents" is
very hazy. We saw it quite awhile
ago. It is not the sort of picture one
remembers long. We do remember
Chevalier's songs in French. They
were high art. Since we are not one
of the maiden ladies who gets a big
thrill out of a French accent, "Louise"
didn't please us so well. It is a thin
song, anyhow.
Chevalier appeals mainly to neglec
ted females, but he is good. "The In
nocents," if not as swell as you
thought it was, is surprisingly un-bad.
But we await Chevalier's next with

confidence that it will be a repetition
of the Jannings and Jolson fiasco
follow-ups.
BIG NEWS! LOCAL MOVIE GOODI
Those discriminating Stanford men
who toss a cheerful free-will offering
in the local movie coffers and sit
through some thoroughly bad pictures
while prettily-garbed ushers chastise
them if they dare to boo above a whis
per, may get their money's worth for
a change.
"Big News" is another one of these
newspaper pictures, but it has its good
moments. It is not as well-knit as
"Gentlemen of the Press," but it Btays
a little closer to the City Room.
The acting 1b excellent. Robert Arm
strong, who made his big hit as the
nitwit fighter in Jimmy Gleason's
knockout comedy, "Is Zat So?" plays
the Reporter darn well. We do not
concur in the popular regard for Carol
Lombard but she was satisfactory
enough.
"Big News" weakens itself with the
stock movie villain and his bootleg
activities, stretches the possibilities a
bit in the murder of the peppery
Managing Editor (delightfully played
by a gent whose name we have for
gotten), utilizes a quite ridiculously
husband and wife news rivalry, but
in spite of evident Brodies, remains
an entertaining picture.
It is in the "pretty good" category.

other. Chevalier's picture is something
you could take your grandmother to
see. It pleased an uncritical public
that has taken to the "talkies" as a
child takes to a red fire engine. The
Juggernaut snorts and roars most
amazingly.
Our memory of "The Innocents" is
very hazy. We saw it quite awhile
ago. It is not the sort of picture one
remembers long. We do remember
Chevalier's songs in French. They
were high art. Since we are not one
of the maiden ladies who gets a big
thrill out of a French accent, "Louise"
didn't please us so well. It is a thin
song, anyhow.
Chevalier appeals mainly to neglec
ted females, but he is good. "The In
nocents," if not as swell as you
thought it was, is surprisingly un-bad.
But we await Chevalier's next with

confidence that it will be a repetition
of the Jannings and Jolson fiasco
follow-ups.
BIG NEWS! LOCAL MOVIE GOODI
Those discriminating Stanford men
who toss a cheerful free-will offering
in the local movie coffers and sit
through some thoroughly bad pictures
while prettily-garbed ushers chastise
them if they dare to boo above a whis
per, may get their money's worth for
a change.
"Big News" is another one of these
newspaper pictures, but it has its good
moments. It is not as well-knit as
"Gentlemen of the Press," but it Btays
a little closer to the City Room.
The acting 1b excellent. Robert Arm
strong, who made his big hit as the
nitwit fighter in Jimmy Gleason's
knockout comedy, "Is Zat So?" plays
the Reporter darn well. We do not
concur in the popular regard for Carol
Lombard but she was satisfactory
enough.
"Big News" weakens itself with the
stock movie villain and his bootleg
activities, stretches the possibilities a
bit in the murder of the peppery
Managing Editor (delightfully played
by a gent whose name we have for
gotten), utilizes a quite ridiculously
husband and wife news rivalry, but
in spite of evident Brodies, remains
an entertaining picture.
It is in the "pretty good" category.

"THE INNOCENTS" AT HOME
Those who wished "climb up on my
knee, Sonny Boy" were a woodshed
fact instead of a song phrase during
the Recent Rage no doubt got a great
thrill out of hearing Maurice Cheva
lier croon "ev'ry little breeze seems
to whisper Louise" by the time "The
Innocents of Paris" got around to
Palo Alto.
But aside from Chevalier, we fail
to see how they could have raved
about the picture. "The Innocents of
Paris" ran some months in San Fran
cisco, but so did "Easy for Zee Zee."
Not that the two resemble each
other. Chevalier's picture is something
you could take your grandmother to
see. It pleased an uncritical public
