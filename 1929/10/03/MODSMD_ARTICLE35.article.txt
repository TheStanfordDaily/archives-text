The Editor, Sir:
I would like to call your attention to
the manner in which Branner Hall's
stairways have been lighted for the past
two nights. (I have only been here since
Monday.) Tonight (at 12:30) there is
only one light burning on the second
floor—and that one at the far end of the
hallway; this leaves the two main stair
ways as well as the south stairway pitch
dark.
This is my first quarter of residence
in Branner, so perhaps I am not as well
acquainted with each step in the stairway
as I should be, or perhaps I don't see as
well as I should in the dark, or perhaps
there are dozens of things wrong with

"LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT"!

me (I'm not saying there aren't) ; never
theless, I fail to see the humorous side
of a fire alarm during the night with the
stairways dark. If such an alarm might
be given (and that is certainly not
stretching the imagination), there would
be nothing but certain death awaiting
those men who live on the second and
third floors.
Does the University advocate the dark
ening of halls and stairways because it
believes in "economy"? Or does it ad
vocate such action because it believes in
"Safety Last"? Could the University
possibly turn out those lights and still
repeat to itself, "Safety First"?
Sincerely yours,
S. C. SINGER, JR.
