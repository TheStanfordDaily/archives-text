# DEMPSEY RETURNS TO BOXING ARENA TONIGHT AS CHICAGO PROMOTER

### 
CHICAGO, 111., Oct. 2 yP). — Jack
Dempsey will return to active participa
tion in the boxing business tonight— not
a scowling, panther-like Dempsey throw
ing padded gloves, but a smiling, slightly
heavier Dempsey offering his first box
ing program as a promoter in his own
right.
The old Manassa mauler will make his
premier in the new role in the Chicago
Coliseum, less than a mile from Soldier
Field, where he fought his last battle
with Gene Tunney two years and 10 days
ago.
Dempsey, scarcely less of a drawing
card than he was as a fighter, was as
sured of a capacity crowd in the remod
eled Coliseum. New seating arrange
ments have increased the capacity to 11,-
000 which would bring a gate of about
$50,000.
