tard and tear gas, alert microphones
and tons of steel, combined in the
form of a modern, hypersensitive,
two-story vault, now guard millions
of dollars of securities held by the
California state treasurer's office as
collateral.
There are times when fearlessness
is but the height of folly and foolish
would be the person who thought
that even with aid of the most mod
ern equipment or disregarding per
sonal safety he could enter the state's
new $30,000 vault without permission
of State Treasurer Charles G. John
son or one of his employees.
For several months workmen have
been tearing out parts of the capitol
and reconstructing three floors to fit
into the old building the very latest
contribution of science —a fireproof,
thief-proof vault, thermostatically, mi
crophonically, and gas protected.
