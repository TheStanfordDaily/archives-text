MOSCOW, Oct. 2 (£>).—War between
Russia and the "capitalistic" powers on a
gigantic scale in which mass is pitted
against mass, is still envisaged as a
possibility by communist leaders in Rus
sia.
In a speech today at the Congress of
Soviet Trade Unions, Clement Voroshi
loff, commissar for war and chairman of
the Revolutionary Council, declared the
Soviet Union is surrounded on all sides
by powerful class enemies, who are
ready to attack Russia at any moment.
"War in the future will be a very
serious and complicated trouble, involv
ing not only enormous bodies of infantry
and cavalry but also modern airplanes
ready to act under any weather condi
tions, and destructive long-range artillery
and chemical equipment, able to destroy
whole populations en masse.
