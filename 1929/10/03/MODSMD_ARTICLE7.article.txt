# McDonald's Visit Delays Airing Of Secret Document
## As Great Britain Minister Nears Coast Disclosures About Shearer Postponed 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 2 (/P).—
On the verge of an expected call for a
new naval limitations conference, the
Senate Shearer investigators today had
clamped the brakes on their inquiry into
what took place two years ago at the
unsuccessful Geneva conference.
Meanwhile, the Senate itself, spurred
by disclosures made in the Shearer in
quiry and statements that efforts have
been made to influence tariff legislation,
has directed its judiciary committee,
headed by Senator Norris of Nebraska,
to conduct a general investigation of
lobbying under the sweeping terms of
the Caraway resolution. When it will
begin remains to be decided.
With Prime Minister Mac Donald Hear
ing the American coast, the Shearer com
mittee decided to postpone further work
until he has concluded his visit to Presi
dent Hoover—generally regarded as for
the purpose of cementing more firmly the
friendly conversations which have al
ready taken place between London and
Washington on the limitation of naval
armaments.
This decision of the committee will
postpone during Mac Donald's sojourn
an airing of a so-called British document
received by the committee yesterday with
out being made public, which purported
to show the existence in this country of
an extensive espionage system reporting
to London.
Committee members arc considering
this document, which was handed to it
by William B. Shearer, the $25,000 "ob
server" at Geneva for the shipbuilders,
and with it a report from the navy in
telligence which Senator Allen, Republi
can, Kansas, says disputes its authen
ticity. Other ramifications of the picture
that has been drawn up for them by the
various witnesses also are being sized up
and it is the opinion of the committeemen
that most of the leading actors must
aagin take the witness chair.
The temporary lull in the proceedings
will give time, Chairman Shortridgc be
lieves, to "gather up the loose threads"
before the examination begins again.
Shearer's story of getting the so-called
secret British document and of turning
it over to the Navy Department and to
Senator Reed of Missouri during the
Senate debate last February on the fif
teen-cruiser bill, ended his two days of
examination by the committee. He didn't
know what Senator Reed, who has since
retired, did with the paper, which was
produced when Senator Allen asked about
it.

WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 2 (/P).—
On the verge of an expected call for a
new naval limitations conference, the
Senate Shearer investigators today had
clamped the brakes on their inquiry into
what took place two years ago at the
unsuccessful Geneva conference.
Meanwhile, the Senate itself, spurred
by disclosures made in the Shearer in
quiry and statements that efforts have
been made to influence tariff legislation,
has directed its judiciary committee,
headed by Senator Norris of Nebraska,
to conduct a general investigation of
lobbying under the sweeping terms of
the Caraway resolution. When it will
begin remains to be decided.
With Prime Minister Mac Donald Hear
ing the American coast, the Shearer com
mittee decided to postpone further work
until he has concluded his visit to Presi
dent Hoover—generally regarded as for
the purpose of cementing more firmly the
friendly conversations which have al
ready taken place between London and
Washington on the limitation of naval
armaments.
This decision of the committee will
postpone during Mac Donald's sojourn
an airing of a so-called British document
received by the committee yesterday with
out being made public, which purported
to show the existence in this country of
an extensive espionage system reporting
to London.
Committee members arc considering
this document, which was handed to it
by William B. Shearer, the $25,000 "ob
server" at Geneva for the shipbuilders,
and with it a report from the navy in
telligence which Senator Allen, Republi
can, Kansas, says disputes its authen
ticity. Other ramifications of the picture
that has been drawn up for them by the
various witnesses also are being sized up
and it is the opinion of the committeemen
that most of the leading actors must
aagin take the witness chair.
The temporary lull in the proceedings
will give time, Chairman Shortridgc be
lieves, to "gather up the loose threads"
before the examination begins again.
Shearer's story of getting the so-called
secret British document and of turning
it over to the Navy Department and to
Senator Reed of Missouri during the
Senate debate last February on the fif
teen-cruiser bill, ended his two days of
examination by the committee. He didn't
know what Senator Reed, who has since
retired, did with the paper, which was
produced when Senator Allen asked about
it.
