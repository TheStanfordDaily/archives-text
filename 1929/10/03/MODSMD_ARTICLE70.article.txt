# STATE OPENS MOVE TO DISMISS ONE OF PANTAGES' CHARGES
## District Attorney Buron Fitts Hopes for Selection Of Jury Today 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 2
trict Attorney Buron Eitts, head of the
prosecution, predicted the selection of a
jury to try Alexander T. Pantages, 54-
year-old multimillionaire vaudeville mag
nate, on an assault charge filed by Eunice
Pringle, a young dancer, would be com
pleted today.
The prosecutor said last night that four
men and eight women, tentatively se
lected shortly before the close of the
first day of trial, were acceptable to the
state. The defense, however, removed one
of the men with a peremptory challenge,
and at adjournment his successor had
not been called. The eleven remaining
were placed under guard in hotel rooms.
The state opened the trial with a sur
prise move in the form of a motion to
dismiss one of the two charges filed
against Pantages. Fitts contended that,
should he he tried on both the assault
charge and a charge of assault by force
upon a minor, complications might arise
as the result of a recent appellate court
ruling, and asked that the latter count
be dismissed. The defense objected, say
ing its plans would be upset.
