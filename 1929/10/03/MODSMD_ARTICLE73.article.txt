# TINY ANTS GRADUALLY DESTROYING SUPPORTS OF SAN MIGUEL MISSION
## 
### 
SAN MIGUEL, Oct. 2. (/P)â€”Mission
San Miguel Archangel, which has
stood for more than a century and a
quarter on a site near the Salinas
river, is in danger of collapse as a
result of activity of myriads of tiny
ants. Father Modesto, priest in charge
of the Mission, recently discovered
that beams supporting the ancient
rafters have been nearly eaten away
by the insects.
The Mission was founded July 25,
1797, by Fathers Firmin Francisco
Lausen and Buenaventura Sitzar and
played a prominent part in the early
history of California. Engineers de
clare the structure can be saved.
