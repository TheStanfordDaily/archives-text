# Food Shortage Feared As Teamsters' Strike Pends
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 2. (/P) â€”More than
a million dollars worth of perishable
fruit and vegetables was lying unauc
tioned at railroad piers today in face
of a threatened strike of 2000 team
sters and chauffeurs.
Though the walkout has not actu
ally been called, buyers refused to bid
on the produce unless assured it would
be moved to markets.
Three conferences were called in
attempt to untangle the situation and
replenish a fast diminishing supply
of oranges, apples, grapes, celery, let
tuce, melons, and potatoes for New-
York's millions.
Whether there will be a strike
hinges on the decision reached by the
Merchant Truckmen's Association as
to whether the teamsters' union de
mands for shorter working hours will
be met.
