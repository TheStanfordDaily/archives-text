## THE 						CRADLE OF EXPERIENCE 
### 
Now that the squad cut has been
made and the composition of the var
sity roster has become a topic of
general gossip around the campus,
and sorority house luncheon tables;
the average student, along with the
common townspeople and sports
critics, is apt to forget all about the
Stanford Grays (often referred to as
the Goofs).
And even if one does give the Grays
a thought, it is probably one of those
"oh, well, they tried hard enough"
kind. The attitude is too frequently
one of pity mixed with a sneer or
two.
The average student Just does
n't comprehend the fact that the
Gray Team is the cradle of fu
ture varsity material. The whole
trouble is that one doesn't seem
to realize that most of the Grays
are really good players, potential
stars in the rough.
The truth of the matter is that a
goodly number of the Grays would
have survived a cut at most other
colleges, and many of them would
now be in the gridiron limelight if
they had not been fortunate enough
to get into Stanford.
But give these young fellows a lit
tle more experience—they get plenty
of that during their sojourn with the
Grays—and they will make the grade
all right. Pop keeps his eyes on the
promising lads, and advances them as
fast as they develop.
The surprising thing is that they
develop with great rapidity. It
wasn't so long ago that Captain
"Mush" Muller was running
around snagging passes for the
Gray Team. Look at Mr. Muller
now—one of the outstanding ends
on the Pacific Coast.
A whole raft of other players in
cluding Moffatt, Neill, Wilson, Daw
son, Driscoll, Pike, Reynolds, M. Al
bertson, and Laird have felt the keen
axe edge at one time or other before
this season. Today they are all mem
bers of that select group of Forty-nine,
having the privilege of throwing food
at the training table besides playing
football now and then.
It seems that football material
on the old Farm is unlimited.
That is why all the members of
last year's Frosh outfit, with the
exception of Allen and Rintala,
will not be seen doing tricks for
the Old Fox this fall. They won't
get a block "G," but they will get
a whole lot of valuable experience.

wasn't so long ago that Captain
"Mush" Muller was running
around snagging passes for the
Gray Team. Look at Mr. Muller
now—one of the outstanding ends
on the Pacific Coast.
A whole raft of other players in
cluding Moffatt, Neill, Wilson, Daw
son, Driscoll, Pike, Reynolds, M. Al
bertson, and Laird have felt the keen
axe edge at one time or other before
this season. Today they are all mem
bers of that select group of Forty-nine,
having the privilege of throwing food
at the training table besides playing
football now and then.
It seems that football material
on the old Farm is unlimited.
That is why all the members of
last year's Frosh outfit, with the
exception of Allen and Rintala,
will not be seen doing tricks for
the Old Fox this fall. They won't
get a block "G," but they will get
a whole lot of valuable experience.
Now that the squad cut has been
made and the composition of the var
sity roster has become a topic of
general gossip around the campus,
and sorority house luncheon tables;
the average student, along with the
common townspeople and sports
critics, is apt to forget all about the
Stanford Grays (often referred to as
the Goofs).
And even if one does give the Grays
a thought, it is probably one of those
"oh, well, they tried hard enough"
kind. The attitude is too frequently
one of pity mixed with a sneer or
two.
The average student Just does
n't comprehend the fact that the
Gray Team is the cradle of fu
ture varsity material. The whole
trouble is that one doesn't seem
to realize that most of the Grays
are really good players, potential
stars in the rough.
The truth of the matter is that a
goodly number of the Grays would
have survived a cut at most other
colleges, and many of them would
now be in the gridiron limelight if
they had not been fortunate enough
to get into Stanford.
But give these young fellows a lit
tle more experience—they get plenty
of that during their sojourn with the
Grays—and they will make the grade
all right. Pop keeps his eyes on the
promising lads, and advances them as
fast as they develop.
The surprising thing is that they
develop with great rapidity. It
