# EARLY SEASON SCOUTING
## 
### 
At the same time Stanford was
eking out a close victory over the
Olympics last week-end, her chief op
ponents for the remaining grid season
kept in step by pounding out clean
cut wins. Besides Oregon, which
hardly got a sweat up in its workout
with Pacific, California, U.S.C., West
Point, Oregon State, and Washington
ran up one-sided scores.
Where are the wise ones who
said that the Cards had an easy
schedule this year?
Three scouts were sent out by Pop
last Saturday, and all three of them
came back to the Farm reporting that
they saw plenty. While Chuck Win
terburn, backfield coach, was watch
ing the Webfooters teach Pacific a
few fundamentals of the game, Don
Kobesky and Weid Lane were get
ting the low-down on Cal and South
ern Cal, respectively.
Robesky, all-American guard last
fall and newly appointed Gray coach,
went up to Berkeley and got an eye
full of a certain Benny Lom and other
members of Nibs Price outfit. The
Golden Bear, far from being mangy
this season, is a potent veteran with
ample scrap.
Scouting is 0.k., an honest oc
cupation, yet during the early
part of the season about all they
do is throw a scare into the home
team and get a dose of stigma
tism from watching the scouted
team dash up and down the field.
