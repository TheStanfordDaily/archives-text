# INTRAMURAL TOUCH FOOTBALL TO BEGIN AFTER NEXT WEEK
## "Bill" Ellington Replaces Davis as Director of Mural Athletics 
### 
Following a meeting of the Intramural
Sports Hoard, to be held early next week,
a definite date will be set for the com
mencement of touch football, initial fall
intramural sport, according to Bill El
lington, newly appointed director of in
tramural athletics. EJlington replaces
Charlie Davis, director for the past few
years, who this summer accepted a po
sition as playground director for the city
of Oakland.
Five sports, touch football, golf, cross
country, handball, and track, comprise the
intramural sports program for the fall
quarter. Touch football, which was tried
experimentally last year and proved most
popular, is now on the regular list of
sports counting points toward the intra
mural cup, and replaces interclass foot
ball which is being abandoned this year.
A new system of directing intramural
sports is being tried this year. Ellington,
director, Myron Schall, secretary, and a
student board composed of Tex Cran
dall, Bob Brown, and Bob Pierce, will
determine the details and oversee the pro
gram in general. The actual managing
of each sport will be handled by the
physical education instructor of that
sport, with the exception of golf for
which a manager has yet to be appointed.
Club and fraternity sports managers
will do well to line up their men for the
forthcoming season, as present indica
tions point to a hard struggle for the
championship cup. El Toro will attempt
to regain their laurels won for the past
two years, but are expected to meet
strong opposition from Delta Chi, Se
quoia, and other runners-up in last year's
series. Delta Tau Delta, which came up
fast in the final events last spring, but
had too large a lead to overcome to place
among the first ten, intends to make a
strong bid for honors throughout this,
season.
