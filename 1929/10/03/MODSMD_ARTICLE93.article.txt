# JOHN DOEG GAINS NATIONAL FAME IN TENNIS CAMPAIGN
## 
### Allan Hart 
John Doeg, Stanford junior and mem
ber of the Card tennis varsity, played his
way to lasting fame this summer when
he won five major tennis championships,
including the national doubles crown
with George Lott, throughout the eastern
part of the United States.
Doeg competed in a different tourna
ment every week of the summer, begin
ning on June 22 and ending on Septem
ber 29. He won the title in the Rhode
Island State Championships, the Nassau
Invitational tournament, the Longwood
Bowl tournament, the Scabright invita
tional, and the national doubles cham
pionships.
During the summer Doeg, who was
eighth ranking singles player last year,
defeated the four stars ranked directly
ahead of him. He consistently defeated
WTlmer Allison, No. 4; John Van Ryn,
No. 5; Arnold Jones, No. 6; and Fritz
Mercur, No. 7. Since none of these
players defeated him, Doeg is sure to
rank either third or fourth this year. He
did not meet George Lott in singles com
petition.
The Stanford star's name will live
forever in tennis annals for the glorious
battle he put up against "Big" Bill Til
den in the finals of the National Singles
championships. Doeg gave the galleries
a thrill by winning the first set in short
order, the score being 6-3. Tilden came
back to win the second, 6-4, but Johnny
answered by allowing Big Bill only two
games as he took the set at 6-2. Tilden
won the fourth, 6-4. With the sets at
two all, the fifth and deciding round
proved to be a thriller. Several times
Doeg was within a point of taking his
fifth game, which would have given him
a big edge on the set, but each time Til
den rallied and saved the point. Experi
ence and greater steadiness finally won
for the older man, who took the last set
6-4.
One half of the nationai doubles crown
found its way to Stanford when Doeg,
paired with Lott, defeated Berkeley Bell
and Lewis White, the youthful team from
Texas. Bell and White haTT defeated the
Davis cup doubles champions, Van Ryn
and Allison, in their semi-final match
while Doeg and Lott were occupied in
turning back the ageing team of Tilden
and Hunter.

In the early part of the summer Doeg
had trouble getting into form and lost
in the early rounds of the intercollegiate
titles. The next week he won the Rhode
Island title for the third consecutive time.
As a result of this win Johnny now has
permanent possession of a huge silver
trophy worth $1500.
Winning the Longwood Bowl tourna
ment at Boston, Doeg now shares with
Tilden the distinction of holding two legs
on the trophy. Three are necessary for
permanent possession. The Card net man
defeated R. Norris Williams in the finals
of the Seabright Invitational tournament,
and turned back Van Ryn in the East-
West meet. Other tourneys that Doeg
competed in included the Canadian Na
tional championships, the Southampton
invitational, the Delaware State cham
pionships, and the Eastern championships
at Rye, New York. In the latter he was
defeated by Tilden in four sets.
As a result of his fine playing during
the summer, Doeg is assured of a place
on the 1930 United States Davis Cup
team. If, as is likely, neither Tilden nor
Hunter plays again for this biggest of all
tennis prizes, the other members of the
Davis cup team are almost sure to be
George Lott, John Van Ryn, Wilmer
Allison, John Doeg, and Wilbur Coen.
