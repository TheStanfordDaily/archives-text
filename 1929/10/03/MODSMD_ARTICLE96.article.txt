# Coach Brandsten Predicts Champ Swimming Team
## 
### John Isaacs 
"You can depend upon Stanford to
have another championship team this
year." Thus does Coach Ernie Brand
sten confidently express himself on
the subject of the Cardinal swimming
team. And Brandsten may well be
confident as the Stanford mentor lost
but one man from last season's cham
pionship varsity. In addition he has
four or five former freshman stars
who have now graduated to varsity
ranking, and Pete Desjardins, world's
diving champion, is back in school
after a year's absence.
The water polo team also suffered
little from graduation, and too will be
re-enforced from the strong freshman
aggregation of last season.
Divers in Pairs
In Captain Ed Throndson, Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate champion, and
Pete Desjardins, who won the world's
springboard and platform diving titles
at Amsterdam last year, Stanford has
the finest pair of divers in the coun
try. Throndson further added to his
laurels last season when he defeated
Wally Colbath of Northwestern, the
National Intercollegiate champion.
Herb Marsh, Pacific Coast Junior
titleholder, did not register this fall
but will be back in the lineup next
season.
Austin Clapp and Frank Booth,
mainstays of the 1932 freshman squad,
are expected to star in varsity compe
tition. Clapp was a member of the
American Olympic relay team in 1928,
and Booth recently copped third place
in the Senior National mile swim.
Both men hail from the Hollywood
Athletic Ciub and have been in active
competition all summer.
Jack Pahl, Ferd Fletcher, John
Trotter, and Ward Woods are a quar
tet of former freshman stars who have
also shown varsity promise.
Sprints Are Strong
Coach Brandsten will have Reggie
Harrison, Dick Lucy, and Pahl and
Trotter in the sprints. The middle
distances, which were formerly weak
spots on the Cardinal line-up, will now
be admirably filled by Clapp and
Booth. Barret Brown, a versatile man,
swims sprints, backstroke, and some
times competes in the longer races.
Milton "Whitey" Burns, Pacific In
tercollegiate breaststroke champion
and record-holder, has two more years
of competition. He will be flanked

by Bill Cundall and Fletcher. Former
Captain Ogden Driggs and Frank
Booth will take care of the backstroke
event.
Hold Polo Title
Stanford water poloists have been
undefeated since they won the Na
tional Intercollegiate championship
two years ago. Captain Reggie Har
rison, Ogden Driggs, and Nort Thorn
ton are veterans of that team who
will be eligible this year. Harrison
and Driggs later played with the
American Olympic team. "Whitey"
Burns and Truman Parker are an
other pair of veterans. Clapp, Booth,
Pahl, or Fletcher will undoubtedly fill
the few vacancies.
Stanford has long been known as
a leading developer of national and

stars as Carl Stevenson, A1 White,
and Clarence Pinkston learned their
first strokes in the old Encina pool.
Much credit must go to Coach Ernie
Brandsten who has been swimming
and diving mentor at Stanford for
nearly fifteen years. Brandsten is now
assisted by Ted Smith and Myron
Sprague.
In addition the Cardinals now have
one of the finest aquatic plants in the
country. With three large pools and
complete diving equipment, Brandsten
predicts that Stanford will make a
greater name than ever in the swim
ming world.
Assistant Coach Smith announces
that tryouts for the varsity and fresh
man teams will be held each after
noon from 2 until 6 o'clock.

sten confidently express himself on
the subject of the Cardinal swimming
team. And Brandsten may well be
confident as the Stanford mentor lost
but one man from last season's cham
pionship varsity. In addition he has
four or five former freshman stars
who have now graduated to varsity
ranking, and Pete Desjardins, world's
diving champion, is back in school
after a year's absence.
The water polo team also suffered
little from graduation, and too will be
re-enforced from the strong freshman
aggregation of last season.
Divers in Pairs
In Captain Ed Throndson, Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate champion, and
Pete Desjardins, who won the world's
springboard and platform diving titles
at Amsterdam last year, Stanford has
the finest pair of divers in the coun
try. Throndson further added to his
laurels last season when he defeated
Wally Colbath of Northwestern, the
National Intercollegiate champion.
Herb Marsh, Pacific Coast Junior
titleholder, did not register this fall
but will be back in the lineup next
season.
Austin Clapp and Frank Booth,
mainstays of the 1932 freshman squad,
are expected to star in varsity compe
tition. Clapp was a member of the
American Olympic relay team in 1928,
and Booth recently copped third place
in the Senior National mile swim.
Both men hail from the Hollywood
Athletic Ciub and have been in active
competition all summer.
Jack Pahl, Ferd Fletcher, John
Trotter, and Ward Woods are a quar
tet of former freshman stars who have
also shown varsity promise.
Sprints Are Strong
Coach Brandsten will have Reggie
Harrison, Dick Lucy, and Pahl and
Trotter in the sprints. The middle
distances, which were formerly weak
spots on the Cardinal line-up, will now
be admirably filled by Clapp and
Booth. Barret Brown, a versatile man,
swims sprints, backstroke, and some
times competes in the longer races.
Milton "Whitey" Burns, Pacific In
tercollegiate breaststroke champion
and record-holder, has two more years
of competition. He will be flanked

by Bill Cundall and Fletcher. Former
Captain Ogden Driggs and Frank
Booth will take care of the backstroke
event.
Hold Polo Title
Stanford water poloists have been
undefeated since they won the Na
tional Intercollegiate championship
two years ago. Captain Reggie Har
rison, Ogden Driggs, and Nort Thorn
ton are veterans of that team who
will be eligible this year. Harrison
and Driggs later played with the
American Olympic team. "Whitey"
Burns and Truman Parker are an
other pair of veterans. Clapp, Booth,
Pahl, or Fletcher will undoubtedly fill
the few vacancies.
Stanford has long been known as
a leading developer of national and

stars as Carl Stevenson, A1 White,
and Clarence Pinkston learned their
first strokes in the old Encina pool.
Much credit must go to Coach Ernie
Brandsten who has been swimming
and diving mentor at Stanford for
nearly fifteen years. Brandsten is now
assisted by Ted Smith and Myron
Sprague.
In addition the Cardinals now have
one of the finest aquatic plants in the
country. With three large pools and
complete diving equipment, Brandsten
predicts that Stanford will make a
greater name than ever in the swim
ming world.
Assistant Coach Smith announces
that tryouts for the varsity and fresh
man teams will be held each after
noon from 2 until 6 o'clock.
"You can depend upon Stanford to
have another championship team this
year." Thus does Coach Ernie Brand
