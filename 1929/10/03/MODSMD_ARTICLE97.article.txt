# FROSH GRID TEAM HIT BY INJURIES ON EVE OF GAME WITH MENLO J.C.
## Husky Hunt's Squad Weakened by the Loss of Three First String Tackles; Artman May Be Shifted From Quarterback Position 
### Don Oswill 
Over the first hurdle successfully, with
a 7 to 6 win from Sacramento Junior
College, Coach "Husky" Hunt and a
Stanford freshman football team greatly
weakened by injuries face the hardest
schedule ever attempted by a Cardinal
yearling eleven. The fifty remaining, of
the seventy original aspirants for the
team, are going through daily workouts
in preparation for their contest against
Menlo Junior College here Saturday af
ternoon.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has a likely
looking squad, probably stronger all
around than last year's, but at present
considerably weakened by injuries. Three
tackles, Ted McKey, Harry Laßorde,
and Nelson Gray, will probably be hung
up all week with injuries sustained in
the Sacramento contest. This leaves a
gaping hole in the Card forward wall,
a weakness which may prove fatal in
Saturday's contest.
Young Artman at Quarter
Bill Artman, quarter, may be shifted
to a tackle position in an effort to bol
ster up the line, as he is an experienced
lineman. Paul Targhetta, weighing 180
pounds, is a good quarter, and could re
place Artman in the backfield. Jim Irs
feld and Homer Boushey are other good
quarterback prospects, but are rather
light.
Three strong guards relieve Hunt
from any worry about that position. Ted
Kite, Frank Scribner, and John Ross
all play equally well at guard, and
"Husky" will have a hard time deciding

on any two from this trio.
At center, Virgil Choate, a 220-pounder
from Ada, Oklahoma, seems to have the
call, temporarily at least, but Bill Bates
will give him a good fight for the job.
Redhead, 165 pounds, of Portland, Ore
gon, also looks good at the pivot posi
tion.
Plenty of Ends
Although devoid of any really brilliant
ends, Coach Hunt has a wealth of ma
terial for the flank positions. "Ham"
Hedge and Irwin Tway looked good
against Sacramento, and may start
against Menlo. Pete Donlin, Jillson
Peattie, and Barclay Brown, the latter
tipping the scales at 185, are good pos
sibilities.
Ken AfTlerbaugh is the most likely
looking ball-toter on the frosh squad.
He is a good safety, a clever open field
runner, and handles the ball well at all
times. Against Sacramento, he broke
away for a sixty-two yard run for a
touchdown.
The left half position seems to be be
tween Peck Peirrose and Thorny Rog
ers, the former weighing 180 pounds, and
the latter 168. Wes Stevens and Axe
Nycland are the only candidates to show
much at fullback to date.
Minus the services of three injured
tackles, the baby R'edshirts will have a
tough proposition in the Menlo eleven.
The Junior College team, in defeating
San Jose State by a score of 12 to 0 last
Saturday, demonstrated a powerful of
fensive, and will make a strong bid for
a win this week.

tion.
Plenty of Ends
Although devoid of any really brilliant
ends, Coach Hunt has a wealth of ma
terial for the flank positions. "Ham"
Hedge and Irwin Tway looked good
against Sacramento, and may start
against Menlo. Pete Donlin, Jillson
Peattie, and Barclay Brown, the latter
tipping the scales at 185, are good pos
sibilities.
Ken AfTlerbaugh is the most likely
looking ball-toter on the frosh squad.
He is a good safety, a clever open field
runner, and handles the ball well at all
times. Against Sacramento, he broke
away for a sixty-two yard run for a
touchdown.
The left half position seems to be be
tween Peck Peirrose and Thorny Rog
ers, the former weighing 180 pounds, and
the latter 168. Wes Stevens and Axe
Nycland are the only candidates to show
much at fullback to date.
Minus the services of three injured
tackles, the baby R'edshirts will have a
tough proposition in the Menlo eleven.
The Junior College team, in defeating
San Jose State by a score of 12 to 0 last
Saturday, demonstrated a powerful of
fensive, and will make a strong bid for
a win this week.
Over the first hurdle successfully, with
a 7 to 6 win from Sacramento Junior
College, Coach "Husky" Hunt and a
Stanford freshman football team greatly
weakened by injuries face the hardest
schedule ever attempted by a Cardinal
yearling eleven. The fifty remaining, of
the seventy original aspirants for the
team, are going through daily workouts
in preparation for their contest against
Menlo Junior College here Saturday af
ternoon.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has a likely
looking squad, probably stronger all
around than last year's, but at present
considerably weakened by injuries. Three
tackles, Ted McKey, Harry Laßorde,
and Nelson Gray, will probably be hung
up all week with injuries sustained in
the Sacramento contest. This leaves a
gaping hole in the Card forward wall,
a weakness which may prove fatal in
Saturday's contest.
Young Artman at Quarter
Bill Artman, quarter, may be shifted
to a tackle position in an effort to bol
ster up the line, as he is an experienced
lineman. Paul Targhetta, weighing 180
pounds, is a good quarter, and could re
place Artman in the backfield. Jim Irs
feld and Homer Boushey are other good
quarterback prospects, but are rather
light.
Three strong guards relieve Hunt
from any worry about that position. Ted
Kite, Frank Scribner, and John Ross
all play equally well at guard, and
"Husky" will have a hard time deciding

on any two from this trio.
At center, Virgil Choate, a 220-pounder
from Ada, Oklahoma, seems to have the
call, temporarily at least, but Bill Bates
will give him a good fight for the job.
Redhead, 165 pounds, of Portland, Ore
gon, also looks good at the pivot posi
tion.
