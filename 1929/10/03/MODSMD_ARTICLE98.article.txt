# WINNING POLO TEAM EXPECTED THIS YEAR BY CAPTAIN GORDAN
## Gorham and Spalding Are Lost to Squad for Coming Season 
### 
Excellent prospects, far better than
those of last season, are seen for this
year's polo team by Captain Gordan,
coach. Despite the failure to return
this year of Gorham and Spalding,
stellar performers of last season, the
squad is expected to go through its
tricks In much better fashion than
last year.
But two of last season's lettermen,
Dill and Itevell, will be back this year.
These two, with Goodspeed, Scripps,
and Carter, are the only veterans re
turning from the A squad. However,
there is considerable material coming
up from the past-season squad B.
Seven now horses add much in the
line of desirable equipment. Condi
tioning of them will commence to
morrow and they should be well
mounted by the end of the winter
quarter, according to Captain Gordan.
Boeseke Joins Squad
Captain Gordan welcomes the regis
tration of one Cedric Boeseke, a Jun

ble this year. Boeseke is the cousin
of Elmer Boeseke, star on the Santa
Barbara Polo Club team, and a seven
goal handicapped man.
Both the Encina and Highway play
ing fields are in the best shape they
have ever been. Due to these fields,
Stanford is the only school able to
play polo all year round.
Btiff Schedule Planned

the Stanford polo squad will face a
fuller schedule of games than it did
last year. Local games will be played

Stanford is the only school able to
play polo all year round.
