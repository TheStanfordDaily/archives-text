dent Hoover has fortified his one-man
commission, John McNab of San Fran
cisco, with broad and extensive au
thority for his coming study of legis
lative ways and means of achieving a
centralized responsibility in federal
enforcement of prohibition laws.
McNab is to have a free hand. He
will pursue his inquiries as he thinks
best, calling upon the Treasury and
Justice departments and the Law En
forcement Commission for such as
sistance as he feels necessary. Co
operating with those agencies and co
ordinating the information that they
furnish to him, hie work will extend
into the formulation of prospective
legislaiion.
He is to determine how the Treas
ury's Prohibition Bureau, devoted to
the detection and apprehension of
Dry Law violators, can best be lifted
from that department and placed in
the Department of Justice beside the
unit there which prosecutes the of
fender in the court. He Is to work
out the form which the new organiza
tion in the Justice Department will
take. In addition, he is to delve into
Federal Court procedure and see what
Congress can do to expedite judicial
action.
The result is to be a working draft
of the legislation which Mr. Hoover
"will recommend to Congress. The
Chief Executive expects McNab to
complete his study in time to submit
the recommendations at the opening
of the regular session of Congress in
December.
