GIANT VS. MIDGET
When a good little man meets a good
big man, something is bound to happen.
And that something is likely to be the
unexpected.
Such a situation will exist to
morrow afternoon, when Walt
Heinecke and George Stadelman
hook horns at center. The turf
is due to take a brutal beating, as
Stadelman is peer of the centers
in this part of the country.
One would think that when giant meets
midget, the giant would come out on top.
But this is not necessarily the case. Hu
man beings are not mere machines. A
small amount of gray matter, if properly
applied, may overbalance a huge amount
of bulk. Napoleon brushed aside plenty
of big spuds in his day.
This Stadelman is one large fellow,
towering up six feet four inches from
the ground, not counting cleats and hel
met. Yet he is reputed to be ample fast
on his feet for a man of Goliathian di
mensions. He handles himself well on
both offense and defense.
But for all Stadelman's good
qualities, Heinecke will hold up
his end of the tussle all right.
Although measuring only five
feet six inches from head to foot,
the Stanford center packs lots of
punch and covers more territory
than ten average players.
Heinecke is not merely all-star
timber; he is the finished prod
uct itself.
Last year the sports writers were so
busy booming up the feats of one Benny
Loin and certain players from sunny
Southern California that they overlooked
a real football star. Since it takes reams
of publicity to put a player over, the all
wise critics, if they are at all prudent,
will work their pencils and copy paper
overtime this fall telling the truth to
the public about this man Heinecke.
At any rate, tomorrow's battle
may decide who will be Ameri
ca's outstanding center for 1929.
WHEN A MEETS B
Coach "Pop" Warner has more than
one interest at stake in tomorrow's clash.
Aside from hoping that the
Cards come out in front and that
his new additions to the squad
—Neill, Moffatt, Hillman, and
the rest—come through with the
desired results, the Old Fox will
have a chance to see how forma
tion A stacks up against forma
tion B.
Not that he doesn't know exactly how
each of them works under fire, for they
are both his creations—two distinct
phases of the famous Warner System.
Last year Stanford ran formation B to
perfection. So far this fall he has stuck
to A—besides, of course, punt forma
tion.
But tomorrow the Webfooters will be
using formation B, when they get their
hands on the ball. It will be modified,
quite naturally, to suit the tastes and
needs of Coach McEwan. Yet the fun
damental principles will be there, and no
doubt they will be carried out to per
fection. The big lads from Oregon will
see to that.
One thing is certain, though,
for no matter which team loses,
the Warner System will win.
