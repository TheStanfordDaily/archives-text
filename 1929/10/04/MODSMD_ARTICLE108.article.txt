## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney announced an
innovation in the boxing schedule
yesterday, when he stated that the
Annual Novice Boxing Tournament is
planned for Autumn Quarter. Hereto
held during Winter Quarter, prior to
intercollegiate competition.
A change has likewise been planned
for the all-University Tournament,
and the varsity squad will vote on
the date today. These changes, it was
pointed out, will not lengthen the box
ing season, but it is hoped that they
will permit the coaches to secure the
best estimation of talent prior to the
collegiate bouts.
All students registered in the Uni
versity, with the exception of previous
Novice and All-University tournament
winners and varsity letter men, are
eligible for this tournament. Coach
Myron Schall states that the boxing
enrollment will approximate 75 men
by Monday, an encouraging turn-out
for the Autumn Quarter. Captain
Ralph Malcolm is assisting with the
instruction of the beginners, and the
good-sized class augurs well for the
success of the Stanford team this sea
