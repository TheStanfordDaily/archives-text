Barbarians of San Francisco, as well
as the collegiate aggregations, is
being arranged by Manager Smith

the best of the entire year.
The lettermen who will don uni
forms this afternoon are Captain Herb
Mayer, Bob Burns, Ken Christensen,
Swanton Dalton, George Eberhart,
Bill Nichols, Ed O'Donnell, Robert
Reynolds, Rooney Jackson, and Otis
Wight. Two other likely candidates

a very few have signed up to date.

day.
The freshman team will play a num
