# Frosh Swim Star Places At Major Races Of Summer
## 
### 
Austin Clapp, member of Stanford's
freshman swimming team last year and
a member of the United States Olympic
Games team in 1928, participated in three
important water events during the sum
mer as a member of the Hollywood Ath
letic Club's team. These were the Silver
Gate swim at San Diego on June 23; the
Southern California championships in
July; and the National A.A.U. meet at
San Francisco from August 22 to 25.
Clapp placed second in the mile and
in the half mile swims at the National
championships, losing to Buster Crabb
in both events. The Stanford swimmer
took third in the 440 and in the 300-yard
medley; Crabb also won these two races.
He also swam a lap on the Hollywood
club's relay team, which won the cham
pionship.
The Stanford star led a field of over
200 starters across the finish line at the
Silver Gate swim to win. This event,
which consists of swimming about 600
yards across the San Diego channel, is
one of the two big Pacific Coast swim
events of the season.
Clapp won two Southern California
championships, holding the 1929 crown
in the 100-yard and 220-yard events.
