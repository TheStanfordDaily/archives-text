# "I'M NO INVALID," SAYS TUNNEY, JUST THROUGH OPERATION
## 
### 
BERLIN, Oct. 3 (/P). â€”Although Gene
Tunney, former heavyweight boxing
champion, yesterday underwent a minor
operation, he is far from considering
himself an invalid.
"Do I look like a hospital invalid?"
he asked a correspondent of the Associ
ated Press. "I never felt better in my
life."
He was indeed tanned and moved with
quick and agile motion. He mentioned
that he weighed exactly the same as
when he met Tom Heeney in the last
battle of his ring career.
After the operation at a local sani
tarium he returned to his hotel where
Mrs. Tunney, the former Polly
joined him. Professor Arthur Meyer,
who performed an operation for appen
dicitis on Mrs. Tunney at Brioni, said
yesterday that he found her in excellent
condition and added that she had gained
eighteen pounds.
