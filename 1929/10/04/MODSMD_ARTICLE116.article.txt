# HUNT SAYS INTENSIVE DRILL IS BEEN BENEFICIAL TO FRESHMAN GRID TEAM
## Frosh Squad Faces Menlo Junior College Tomorrow in Second Game of Season; LaBorde in Lineup 
### Don Oswill 
Although injuries will keep two strong tackles from the starting lineup, Coach
"Husky" Hunt avers that the Stanford freshman football team which faces Menlo
Junior College on the local gridiron tomorrow is in decidedly better shape than at
the opening contest last week. Seven days of intensive drill have polished some of
the rougher edges so evident in the first contest, and it will be a smooth-running
combination which faces Menlo tomorrow.
The presence of Harry at right tackle will strengthen the tine a great

>deal. La√üorde has been laid uj. for the
past five days with an injured leg, and
although not quite ready, will start
against the junior College 'eleven. Bill
Artman, brother of Chang Artman, of
varsity fame, lias been shifted from quar
terback to fill the vacancy at the other
tackle position. The younger Artman has
had some experience as a lineman, and
should show well in tomorrow's contest.
The Card yearlings will find a tough
opponent in Menlo Junior College.
Against San Jose State last Saturday, the
Menlo team loosed an impressive attack
to down the Teachers by a score of 12
to 0. There has been a tendency to under
rate junior college teams, but tfualtty of
playing turned out by the undergraduate
schools has been improving rapidly, and
the football public is beginning to learn
that all junior college teams arc not to be
sneered at. Nearly all the men on the
Menlo squad have had a year's experi
ence, which should serve tWeni well
against Stanford tomorrow.
Paul Targhetta will play quarter in
place of Artman tomorrow. During the
past week's scrimmage, Targhetta has
shown his ability to call signals, as well
as handle the ball, thereby earning the
right to start as backfield executive.
Peck Peirrose and Ken Aflflerbaugh are
the starting halves, with Wcs Stevens at
fullback
At least four guards should see service
in the Menlo conflict. While the two
Johns, Corbus and Ross, arc scheduled
to start in the line, Ted Kite and Harry
Scribbner will very probably be used be
fore the fray is over. All four play
equally good football, and arc putting
up a splendid fight for the guard jobs.
Just now Corbus seems to have a slight
edge on the other three, but not enough
to warrant their staying out of the game.
The starting line-up will be as follows:
Ends, Hedge and Tway; tackles, La-
Borde and Artman; guards, Corbus and
Ross; center, Choate; halves, Affler
baugh and Peirrose; quarter, Targhetta;
full, Stevens.
