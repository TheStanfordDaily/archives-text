# Utility Interests Under Investigation By Board
## 
### 
The Federal Trade Commission, pursuing
its investigation of public power utilities,
today dipped briefly into the attitude of
utility interests toward the Federal Pow
er Commission in an unsuccessful at
tempt to establish the authorship of an
unsigned memorandum which had been
circulated as purporting to represent op
position by the utility interests to the
commission's accounting methods.
Paul A. Schoelkopf, president of the
Niagara Falls Power Company, under
questioning by commission counsel, dis
claimed any knowledge of the memoran
dum, said he had not inspired it and that
it did not represent his views.
