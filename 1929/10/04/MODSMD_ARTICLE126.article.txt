# Fire, Started By Hunters, Spreading In Washington
## 
### 
HOQUIAM, Wash., Oct. 3. (/P) â€”Fire
started in six places over a three-mile
stretch on the ridge dividing the up
per Wynooche and Satsop River
watersheds today raged uncontrolled
over thousands of acres tonight.
The fires, believed to have been
started by hunters to drive game out
of the brush down to the open river
bottom, were spaced about three-quar
ters of a mile apart. Driven by a brisk
quartering wind, the flames spread
rapidly.
Several patches of green timber left
by the Schafer Brothers Logging Com
pany were burned, but for the most
part the area covered was cut-over
land.
