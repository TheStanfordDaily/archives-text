"The death of Dr. Gustav Stresemann
is an almost irreparable loss to Ger
many," said Professor Ralph H. Lutz
of the University history department in a
statement to the Daily Thursday evening.
"lie was the greatest statesman of
republican Germany," Professor Lutz

a young man from the people to rise to
prominence even in imperialistic Ger
many.
"After making a business success,
Stresemann entered the Reichstag. In
1917 he became leader of the liberal
party. He soon became minister of for
eign affairs.
"At first Stresemann was a monarchist
but the internal strife of Germany con
vinced him of the necessity of such a re
public as the liberals have since sup
ported.
"As to his great life work, Stresemann
will be remembered for bringing the
Ruhr conflict with Francc to a close, sta
bilizing German currency, paving the way
for foreign loans, and leading Germany

into the League of Nations.
"Stresemann was noted as a statesman,
industrial leader, minister of foreign af
fairs, but his greatest work was as a
sponsor of the world peace movement."
Professor Lutz was present at Geneva
when Germany was admitted into the
League. He heard Dr. Stresemann make
his famous speech before the Assembly.
Paying a tribute to the minister's ca
reer, Professor Lutz said:
"Dr. Stresemann was awarded a Nobel
prize for his peace work. This, we trust,
will stand as an everlasting monument
of his greatness."
