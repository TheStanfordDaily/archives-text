"The death of Dr. Gustav Stresemann
is an almost irreparable loss to Ger
many," said Professor Ralph H. Lutz
of the University history department in a
statement to the Daily Thursday evening.

republican Germany," Professor Lutz
said. "His career showed the ability of
a young man from the people to rise to

prize for his peace work. This, we trust,
will stand as an everlasting monument
of his greatness."
