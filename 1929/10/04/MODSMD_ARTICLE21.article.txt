# OREGON TEAM DUE HERE TODAY FOR CLASH WITH CARD ELEVEN
## Webfooters a Heavy, Seasoned Squad; Expect to Best Cards And Cinch Pacific Coast Championship 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Sweeping down from the north prepared to avenge last year's defeat, a formi
dable squad of Oregon Webfooters, thirty-three strong, is scheduled to arrive here
this afternoon to rest up for tomorrow's opening Coast Conference game against
the Cardinals.
Coach McEwan, with a heavy team composed of seasoned veterans, fully

>expects to upset Stanford and in so doing
take the first hurdle toward the Pacific
Coast championship. If Oregon does take
Pop's squad into camp, it will have a
strangle hold on the title, as the lemon
yellow outfit escapes meeting both Cali
fornia and U.S.C. this fall.
Mason to Play
With the announcement that Captain
Dave Mason, who has been out of the
lineup for the past few weeks because
of a sprained ankle, would probably face
the Cards at the opening kickoff, Ore
gon's chances for victory have been con
siderably brightened. Mason plays right
half back, and is one of the trickiest ball
toters in the whole Northwest.
Combined with Kitzmiller and Wil
liams, two triple threat artists, the Ore
gon backfield should cause Warner's men
plenty of trouble. Added to this, Coach
McEwan has a powerful line made up
almost entirely of six-footers, who are
doped to break up a large percentage of
Stanford's reverses and spin plays.
Injuries Hit Cards
To meet this attack Pop will be forced
to put a team on the field tomorrow
weakened by injuries. Bill Simkins, Kay
Albertson, Ham Wilson, and Johnny
Preston are still on the hospital list, and
none of them will see action against the
Webfooters.
Outside of these casualties, the Stan
ford team is in pretty fair shape for the
battle. Herb Flcishhacker and Chuck
Smalling, two giant members of the Old
Fox's power backfield, have entirely re
covered from bruises received in the
Olympic game and should administer the
Oregon lads ample punishment.
Harlow Rothert, perhaps the most im
proved back on the Coast this year, is
expected to outpunt Kitzmiller, while
Lud Frcntrup will be out on the field to
give the fans a few thrills in returning
kicks and reversing the ends.
Neill at End
The same line that opened up against
the Club team last week, with the ex
ception of Phil Neill at left end instead
of Preston, will start again tomorrow.
Neill showed great possibilities in the
Olympic contest, and Coach Warner is
looking for him to come through with a
bang-up game this Saturday. With Cap
tain "Mush" Muller holding down the
other wing position, the Redshirts will
present a front line defense that is hard
to beat.
Yesterday's practice consisted in giv
ing the tackling dummy a good work-out,
followed by a snappy session of signal
practice. Pop is taking no chances, and
has drilled his charges hard all week in
preparation for the northern invasion.
Following is the probable lineup for
tomorrow's contest, although it is sub
ject to last-minute changes:
Oregon Stanford
Erdley LER Muller (C)
Colbert LTR Tandy
Shields LGR Heiser
Stadelman C Heinecke
Lillie RGL Driscoll
Christensen RTL Artman
Archer REL Neill
Kitzmiller Q Fleishhacker
Williams LHR Rothert
Mason (C) RIIL Frentrup
Moeller F Smalling
