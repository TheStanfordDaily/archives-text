# THIRTY-FIVE TURN OUT FOR CHAPPIE TRYOUTS; STILL MORE OPENINGS
## 
### 
Thirty-five aspirants appeared last
night at the Chaparral office for the first
meeting of tryoutees for the business,
circulation, and editorial stalls. Several
upperclassmen reported, and of the total
number, ten were women.
The editor, the business manager, and
the women's manager made short talks
explaining the duties of the tryoutees
and emphasizing the quality of work,
rather than quantity. Attention was
called to the approaching issue of the
Chaparral which will celebrate the thir
tieth anniversary of the magazine. Ham
mer and Coffin, Chappie's honorary so
ciety, was explained, eligibility to this
organization being possible if contribu
tions are printed in nine issues during one
year.
Tryouts are still open, especially to
freshmen, and all students interested are
requested to report to the office and get
acquainted.
