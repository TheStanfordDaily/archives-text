# EXPLORERS' BODIES LOCATED BY POLICE IN FROZEN WASTES
## Mounted Officers Bury Men Who Starved to Death Near Hudson Bay 
### 
OTTAWA, Ont., Oct. 3 party
of Royal Canadian Mounted Police was
back today after holding an inquest and
funeral services in the bleak Arctic
wastes where John Hornby, British ex
plorer, and two companions died of
starvation.
Inspector Charles Trundle, command
ing the Great Slave Lake division at
Fort Smith, and three companions found
the bodies of Hornby, H. E. C. Adlard,
and Edgar V. Christian in their cabin
on the banks of the Thelon River, north
west of Hudson Bay. Their deaths had
been reported last August by a prospec
tor.
After an inquest the officers buried the
bodies with funeral rites, marked the
graves with crosses, and brought back
notes and papers left by the three.
The papers included the first two chap
ters of a book by Hornby entitled "In the
Land of Feast or Famine," and a diary
by Christian, who apparently was the last
to succumb. The officers found the docu
ments when they followed directions
scrawled on the wall to "look in the
stove."
Failure of the explorers to locate herds
of caribou upon which they had counted
for food resulted in their starvation.
