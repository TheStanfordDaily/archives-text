# REORGANIZED CO-OP NOW SERVES LOCAL GROUPS WITH FOODS
## 
### 
Reorganization of the Students' Co
operative Association, completed for the
opening of this quarter, now enables the
Co-op to supply fraternity and sorority
houses directly with meat, bread, gro
ceiies of all kinds, coal, milk, and eggs.
Elliot Ayres, purchasing agent of the
organization, explained what has been
done at a meeting of the house managers
late Wednesday evening. Five thousand
dollars has been invested in the purchase
of an ice plant and ammonia refrigerator
which will be among the most modern on
the Peninsula. A butcher has been em
ployed full time to handle meat for mem
bers of the group.
A one and a half ton Ford truck has
been purchased by the Co-op, and it will
make two regular deliveries every day,
as well as special deliveries when neces
sary.
Almon E. Roth, Comptroller of the
University, urged the managers to stick
with the Co-op, especially while it is
getting under way. He assured them that
the University is backing the organiza
tion to the full.
