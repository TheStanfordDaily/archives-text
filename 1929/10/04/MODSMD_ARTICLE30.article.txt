### 
There was a lot of fire hose lying
around the halls of Encina yesterday,
following the sophomore rush on the
freshman stronghold the night before.
Hall sponsors, however, report less dam
age this year than customarily attends
the interclass fracas. Water on the floor
did little harm and was removed before
afternoon. Two transoms were broken,
but the major damage was to the clothing
of the Encina defenders.
Interclass spirit, aroused during the
Wednesday evening conflict, will blaze
forth again in the tie-up, the official
freshman - sophomore battle, which is
tentatively scheduled for next Tuesday.
