# Tradition Of Window-Exits Dies; Doors Are Installed
## 
### 
Yielding to the march of progress,
another Stanford tradition has been
abandoned with the passing of the
old hall window in the northwest cor
ner of Encina. For the last quarter
of a century, every Frosh class lias
crawled through the old window; but
no more classes will use the handy
short cut. Two new doors afford the
class of '33 an easy exit.
