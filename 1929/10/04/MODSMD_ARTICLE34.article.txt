Meft and women students interested in
newspaper work will be given a chance
to try out for the editorial staff of the
Stanford Daily when the annual fall try
out period opens next Monday. Both men
and women are desired, and though these
trials are primarily for freshmen, the
editor has announced that transfers will
be welcome and may be assured that work
on junior college or other papers will be
given recognition.
Office work and short trials at news

outees for the first. This period will pro
vide an opportunity for the new men and
women to learn the methods and styles
of the Daily. The amount of time spent
in the office, the quality of the work, and
general attitude toward the work will
be the qualkies on which tryoutees will
be judged.
Promotion is through the following
steps: copy editor, night editor, associate
(or women's) editor, and editor-in-chief.
