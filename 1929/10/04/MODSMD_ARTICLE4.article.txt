# Old Boy 30 Years Of Age Tomorrow Birthday Toasted
## Stanford Chaparral Pioneer Of Western Comics, Fifth in U.S. 
### Burnell Gould 
morning 30 years ago
students bicycling to class in a
quad that was almost vulgarly new,
were accosted by pretty Stanford
maidens, most fetching local expon
ents of the Perfect 36.
"Buy a Chappie?" they called, in
charming, well-modulated voices.
"What's a 'Chappie'?" asked the
Stanford dough, moving his bicycle
clips.
"Buy one and you'll see," replied
the pretty maidens.
So the Stanford rough fished into
the pocket of his 3mart peg-top trou
sers and purchased the first issue of
the Stanford Chaparral, the color of
which matched his bright turtle-neck
sweater with its huge white "S" on
the front.
Legend reports that he turned the
new pages with puzzlement, then de
light, and finally loud laughter.
And Bristow Adam's "Old Boy" had
spoken his words of wit and wisdom
for the first time to a chuckling new
public. Associated with Adams were
Chris Bradley, the first editor, and
Larrey Bowman, clever poet, whose
efforts made Volume I a real corner
stone for the years that followed.
The turn of the century found
Chaparral the fifth college comic in
the United States, and pioneer in the
West. Its contemporaries were quick
to recognize Chappie's merit, and the
venerable Harvard Lampoon, estab
lished in 1872, the Yale Record, the
Princeton Tiger, and the Cornell
Widow formed a merry quintet with
the Old Boy of Stanford.
Six more years and the Chaparral
bunch was gathered convivially around
the beer-stained board in Menlo. They
met and joked, conferred and parted.
That was in the middle of April. In
two more hours came the greatest
earthquake in California history.
But it was too late—Hammer and
Coffin Society had already been es
tablished.
Like the original Chaparral group,
which stepped in as the fifth link in a
chain that now stretches clear across
the nation, Hammer and Coffin So
ciety soon grew substantially.
The infant Pelican, whose large
beak seized the sacred fish that clut
tered the California campus, became
the second member.
Down the years, Chaparral's Silver
Sledge has been wielded by local
celebrities whose campus laurels es
tablished their wider claim to Fame.
Wallace Irwin was an early contri
butor. Bruce Bliven was on the staff.
Feg Murray did last year's Big Game
cover. Jimmy Swinnerton drew the
cartoon for the Big Game cover in '24.
All the long line of Chaparral men
has been notable. The last two editors
were Winston Norman and Jack
Shoup.
The 30th anniversary number, in
which the Old Boy keeps up to th(-
times by celebrating Aviation, will be
the initial bow of Nelson Carter as
pilot of the venerable comic.
Thirty years have brought no bet
ter cover than the oiif drawn by Ted
Krough, '29, art editor for the Shoup
year, declare Hammer and Coffin
members.
" 'Tis better to have lived and
laughed than never to have lived at
all" is still the Old Boy's motto as
he introduces new features in his first
number for the fall quarter, out next
week.

Shoup.
The 30th anniversary number, in
which the Old Boy keeps up to th(-
times by celebrating Aviation, will be
the initial bow of Nelson Carter as
pilot of the venerable comic.
Thirty years have brought no bet
ter cover than the oiif drawn by Ted
Krough, '29, art editor for the Shoup
year, declare Hammer and Coffin
members.
" 'Tis better to have lived and
laughed than never to have lived at
all" is still the Old Boy's motto as
he introduces new features in his first
number for the fall quarter, out next
week.
morning 30 years ago
students bicycling to class in a
quad that was almost vulgarly new,
were accosted by pretty Stanford
maidens, most fetching local expon
ents of the Perfect 36.
"Buy a Chappie?" they called, in
charming, well-modulated voices.
"What's a 'Chappie'?" asked the
Stanford dough, moving his bicycle
clips.
"Buy one and you'll see," replied
the pretty maidens.
So the Stanford rough fished into
the pocket of his 3mart peg-top trou
sers and purchased the first issue of
the Stanford Chaparral, the color of
which matched his bright turtle-neck
sweater with its huge white "S" on
the front.
Legend reports that he turned the
new pages with puzzlement, then de
light, and finally loud laughter.
And Bristow Adam's "Old Boy" had
spoken his words of wit and wisdom
for the first time to a chuckling new
public. Associated with Adams were
Chris Bradley, the first editor, and
Larrey Bowman, clever poet, whose
efforts made Volume I a real corner
stone for the years that followed.
The turn of the century found
Chaparral the fifth college comic in
the United States, and pioneer in the
West. Its contemporaries were quick
to recognize Chappie's merit, and the
venerable Harvard Lampoon, estab
lished in 1872, the Yale Record, the
Princeton Tiger, and the Cornell
Widow formed a merry quintet with
the Old Boy of Stanford.
Six more years and the Chaparral
bunch was gathered convivially around
the beer-stained board in Menlo. They
met and joked, conferred and parted.
That was in the middle of April. In
two more hours came the greatest
earthquake in California history.
But it was too late—Hammer and
Coffin Society had already been es
tablished.
Like the original Chaparral group,
which stepped in as the fifth link in a
chain that now stretches clear across
the nation, Hammer and Coffin So
ciety soon grew substantially.
The infant Pelican, whose large
beak seized the sacred fish that clut
tered the California campus, became
the second member.
Down the years, Chaparral's Silver
Sledge has been wielded by local
celebrities whose campus laurels es
tablished their wider claim to Fame.
Wallace Irwin was an early contri
butor. Bruce Bliven was on the staff.
Feg Murray did last year's Big Game
cover. Jimmy Swinnerton drew the
cartoon for the Big Game cover in '24.
All the long line of Chaparral men
has been notable. The last two editors
were Winston Norman and Jack
Shoup.
