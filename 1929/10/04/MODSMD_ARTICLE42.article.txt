nia's Bears set about the task today
•of polishing off an offense featuring
a running attack that is expected to
leave its mark in the St. Mary's line
when the two elevens clash in the
Memorial Stadium here.
Coach Nibs Price took advantage
■of a good opportunity yesterday to
give each of his players a critical eye
■during the scrimmage session be
tween the Bears and the Brigham
Young eleven of Provo, Utah. He ex
perimented considerably with his
Ijackfield, using Lom and Rice in one
set, and Eldred Lane and Stanley
Barr in another. Lom and Rice, as
well as the other backfield men, made
a good showing against the Utah
aquad, going through the line at will.
