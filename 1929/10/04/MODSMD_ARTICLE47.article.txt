# SPORTS OF 1929

### BY FEG MURRAY 
"Shoot if you must this old gray
bean,
But help keep America's Pastime
clean,"
so might that venerable Apostle of
Baseball Purity, Judge Landis, have
said, at one time or another since
1920, when he was appointed Commis
sioner of National Professional Base
ball Leagues. Many storms have
raged about his white-thatched head.
Appointed at a time when the "Na
tional Pastime" (then baseball, but
now golf) had lost the confidence of
the public because of the "Black Sox"
scandal, Ivenesaw Mountain Landis
has helped the game resume its place
in the affection of the people and
restored the turnstile clicking indus
try to a position undreamed of even
by the greediest of magnates. (Cries
of "How about Babe Ruth?" "I thought
the lively ball did that," etc., etc. â€”
Never mind, children, you've gotta
admit the Judge has been the best
commissioner baseball has ever had!)
"The Judge" will be much in the

public eye these days, with the world
series just around the corner, and the
grim-visaged but good-humored gent
with the old battered felt hat and the
shock of white hair will be seen
bustling hither and yon, waving his
cane in friendly greeting or in a
wrathy gesture at friend or foe, and
enjoying the spotlight as much as a
John Gilbert or a Barrymore. The
world series cannot go on until the
Judge is in his seat and has later
stood up before a battery of cameras
to throw out the first baseball. And,
officially, it never rains until Judge
Landis has given out his opinion that
it is wet enough to call the game.
A great guy, this 63-year-old Oliioan,
who served for seventeen years as a
United States district judge. He was
big enough then to fine the Standard
Oil Company $29,000,000 and, as base
ball's boss, to punish the game's
most popular figure, Babe Ruth. M<?re
power to you, Judge! Here's hoping
your golf game improves as baseball
has done under your commissioner
ship!
