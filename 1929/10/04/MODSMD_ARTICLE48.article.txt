the lion in his den when, taking their
lives in their hands, they stormed En
cina last night and captured the Frosh
flag which floated eo bravely from the
flag pole in front of the hall bearing
the legend "To Hell with '32." True,
the freshmen were all at dinner, but

less hazardous and to these four men

of victory which they claimed over
the '32 men in the rail the night
before.
