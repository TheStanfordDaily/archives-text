# MEDIC STUDENT WHO INHALED PARASITE IN LABORATORY BETTER
## 
### 
i Harold D. Chope, '27, the Stanford
| medical student whose lungs became
| infected by the little known vegetable
j mold coccieial granuloma, during ;
; his research work on that subject, is
reported to be slightly improved.
The attacks of this parasite, which !
! gradually spreads in a sort of film j
[over the inside of the lungs, have:
been the subject of study only in re
cent years and no definite cure has
been discovered. Victims of the coc
cieial mold, which resembles the or- j
dinary bread mold and manifests
itself through symtoms similar to
those of tuberculosis, usually linger
for several months before succumb- !
ing but occasional recoveries have
been known. Dr. William Ophuls and
Dr. Ernest C. Dickson, under whose
guidance Chope was conducting his
research, have expressed their belief
that he may recover from this rather
rare disease and that his condition
last night was noticeably better.
