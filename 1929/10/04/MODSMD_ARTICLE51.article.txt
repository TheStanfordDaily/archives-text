# RAIDING MILITIAMEN STAGE BIG CLEANUP IN WILD TEXAS CITY
## 
### 
BORGER, Texas, Oct. 3. (#>) —Four
squads of raiding militiameu, led by
Texas Rangers, early today had put
the general cleanup of Borger, ordered
by Brigadier General Jacob F. Wol
ters, commander of the town since
martial law was proclaimed, well
under way with nearly two-score ar
rests, most of them involving women.
Meanwhile, the General's military
court of inquiry, which worked until
late last night, was prepared to con
tinue questioning witnesses in efforts
to determine who assassinated Dis
trict Attorney John A. Holmes on the
night of September 13 and to trace
the ramifications of an alleged con
spiracy of deposed city and county
peace officers with criminals.
The raids, which General Wolters
intimated were designed not particu
larly to aid the main inquiry but to
rid the oil town of those thugs who
had not already left, went forward
smoothly under the tutelage of the
veteran Rangers, past masters of the
business. Pistols, shotguns, rifles,
whiskey, and Jamaica ginger were
confiscated. Two of three "bad actors"
the General wanted to see were
brought to him in the first batch. He
examined them personally—as he did
all the rest —told them to appear to
day before the court, and let them go.
