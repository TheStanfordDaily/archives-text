# AUGUSTA'S LEVEES CHECK INROADS OF TURBULENT FLOODS
## 
### 
AUGUSTA, Ga., Oct. 3 (iP).â€”Striv
ing to hold back the wall of water that
has pounded at the city levee since Mon
day, citizens of Augusta today believed
their fight against the floods of the Sa
vannah River had been won.
Although the river had reached a stage
of 44.8 feet, Weather Bureau officials
said they expected a recession. Except

for the three crevasses below the city,
the levee stood intact. Some 1500 men
strengthened it with sandbags.
A span of a railroad bridge across the
Savannah was washed away, along with
several freight cars which had been
placed on the bridge as ballast. Several
power dams in Horse Valley, across the
Savannah River, were washed out and
one was dynamited to protect the little
town of Graniteville, S.C.
Restoration of jiower in the city today
brought with it relief from the critical
water scarcity.
