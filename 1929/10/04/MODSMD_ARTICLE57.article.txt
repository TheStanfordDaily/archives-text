# DITCH DIGGER FINDS $10,000 POT OF GOLD AT END OF RAINBOW
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 3 (/P).—'The end of
the rainbow was located yesterday at
East Eighty-fourth Street and Prairie
Avenue by Joe Dowery, who digs ditches.
The pot of gold was there all right, just
like the book says, only it was all in $1
bills, 10,000 of them.
Mr. Dowery, whose very name, minus
an "e," suggests getting something for
nothing, immediately resigned as a ditch
digger. He informed his foreman, Matt
Smith, that ditch-digging was a meniality
with which he would have no further
truck.
The 10,000 one-dollar bills were in a
tin box that Joe's shovel uncovered. He
took them down to the Federal Building,
for the bills were old and he wanted
new ones of larger denominations.
A little later he was back at the end
of the rainbow asking Matt Smith for
his job.
"The money," he said sadly, plunging
the blade of his shovel viciously into the
innocent soil, "was counterfeit."
