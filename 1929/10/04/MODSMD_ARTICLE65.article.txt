SITKA, Alaska, Oct. 3 (JP). â€” The
Russian monoplane "Land of the So
viets" took off at 6:42 a.m., Pacific
Standard Time, for Seattle. The soviet
airmen expected to fly the outside pas
sage to Seattle and hoped to reach there
within nine hours.
The flight will cover approximately
900 miles, somewhat longer than the di
rect airline route, as the course outlined
lies west of the many islands along the
Alaskan and British Columbian coast.
They expected to reach Seattle after ten
hours of flying.
