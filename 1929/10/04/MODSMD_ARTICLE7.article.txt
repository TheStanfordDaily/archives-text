# Roth Promises Bus Plans; Tentative Route Proposed
## 
### 
Plans for the new bus line between
Palo Alto and Stanford, to replace the
electric cars, should be completed within
ten days, according to Comptroller Roth.
A tentative route for the system runs
up Palm Drive, along one side of Quad,
past the post-office, up Lasuen to the
Campus School, back to Quad and down
the other side, returning to Palo Alto
on Embarcadcro Road past the stadium.
This plan is not definite yet, declared
Roth, who is now studying campus traf
fic conditions with the bus line in mind;
but the route to be followed will prob
ably be decided for certain within a
short time.
