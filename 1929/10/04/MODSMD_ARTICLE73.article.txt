# SAN MARCIAL LOSES TIME-WORN BATTLE WITH FLOOD WATERS
## Old Spanish Cavalier Town Reduced to Flag Stop By Rio Grande 
### 
SAN MARCIAL, N.M., Oct. 13. (/P)—
San Marcial, ancient village of the
Spanish Conquistadores, has lost its
centuries-old battle with flood waters
of the Rio Grande. The town is rap
idly being reduced to a mere flag stop
on the Santa Fe railroad. Once San
Marcial was the headquarters for
Spanish cavaliers who rode their fleet
Castilian horses dashingly about the
country hereabouts, then cantered to
town on moonlit nights to strum a
guitar or croon a love song beneath
the windows of senoritas, snugly
quartered in the homes of their
fathers, the old Spanish dons. Later
San Marcial was for generations a
'dobe village, a meeting place of pas
toral Pueblo Indians who lived their
quiet lives on the tiny irrigated farms
that stretched in each direction up
and down the tawny winding stream
that is the Rio Grande.
Today the little town where vil
lagers for generations fought the Rio
Grande, is without permanent inhab
itants. A few adobe dwellings that
have withstood the August and Sep
tember floods are buried in silt, so
that the few relief workers there walk
without difficulty into the second
stories of the houses. In general, the
layer of silt has raised the town level
eight or ten feet. The streets today
are dry and choken with sun-baked
sand.
Van Coverdan, for years manager
of the Harvey House, returned today
to salvage whatever equipment pos
sible. The old picturesque building
from which the last fifty-four persons
were rescued in boats at the peak of
last month's flood, will be abandoned,
Coverdan said. Although no official
announcement has been received from
Santa Fe officials, it is generally un
derstood the railroad plans to recon
struct one main line of trackage
through the town, build one spur, and
use the second floor of the Harvey
House for a waiting room. There will
likely be only a station agent and a
telegraph operator on duty there.

Castilian horses dashingly about the
country hereabouts, then cantered to
town on moonlit nights to strum a
guitar or croon a love song beneath
the windows of senoritas, snugly
quartered in the homes of their
fathers, the old Spanish dons. Later
San Marcial was for generations a
'dobe village, a meeting place of pas
toral Pueblo Indians who lived their
quiet lives on the tiny irrigated farms
that stretched in each direction up
and down the tawny winding stream
that is the Rio Grande.
Today the little town where vil
lagers for generations fought the Rio
Grande, is without permanent inhab
itants. A few adobe dwellings that
have withstood the August and Sep
tember floods are buried in silt, so
that the few relief workers there walk
without difficulty into the second
stories of the houses. In general, the
layer of silt has raised the town level
eight or ten feet. The streets today
are dry and choken with sun-baked
sand.
Van Coverdan, for years manager
of the Harvey House, returned today
to salvage whatever equipment pos
sible. The old picturesque building
from which the last fifty-four persons
were rescued in boats at the peak of
last month's flood, will be abandoned,
Coverdan said. Although no official
announcement has been received from
Santa Fe officials, it is generally un
derstood the railroad plans to recon
struct one main line of trackage
through the town, build one spur, and
use the second floor of the Harvey
House for a waiting room. There will
likely be only a station agent and a
telegraph operator on duty there.
