WASHINGTON, Oct. 3. (£>)—' There
Is no limit to human speed insofar as
man's physical make-up is concerned,
is the opinion of Dr. J. R. Poppen,
flight surgeon of the United States
Navy.
Barring sudden changes of rate or
direction, the limitations of which are
now being computed by tests, he says
the human body can go as fast as
mechanical means can be made to
take it.
Dr. Poppen expects the speed rec
ord set by Commander Orlebar of
the British Schneider Cup team to
be raised several times within a year,
and many times thereafter, with no
ill effects to pilots.
"Speed itself will never stop If
properly accelerated and decelerated,"
he asserted. "It is merely a question
of achieving body adjustment to ter
rific physical factors never before
known to man."
