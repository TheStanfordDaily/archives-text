LOS ANGELES, Oct. 3. (£>)— A con
ference of seismologists, meeting at
the California Institute of Technology
seismographic laboratory near Annan
dale, a suburb, today had before it
an outline of the latest discovery by
Robert A. Mlilikan, noted physicist,
in connection with his investigation
of the cosmic ray.
Dr. Millikan, president of the Insti
tute, disclosed in a brief address that
he had differentiated between the cos
mic ray, which he discovered, and
rays given off by the earth, and de
clared that the differentiation may
hold the key to new and valuable
studies of the earth's crust, and to
prediction or location of future earth
quakes.
