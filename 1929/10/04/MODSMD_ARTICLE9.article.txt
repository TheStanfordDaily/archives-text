### 
AUSTIN, Texas, Oct. 3. (,/P) â€”Gov-
ernor Dan Moody was threatened
with death unless he "keeps his nose
out of business at Borger," in an
anonymous letter postmarked New
York which was received by the Aus
tin police department today.
"We've done it before and we'll do
it again if he doesn't stay clear of
there," the letter stated in directing
threats against the Governor. Gover
nor Moody was away from the capital
today but his confidential secretary,
Pat Daugherty, did not take the threat
seriously, saying the Chief Executive
often received such letters from
cranks.
