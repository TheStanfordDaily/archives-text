# THIRTY YEARS OF LAUGHS
## 
### 
Tomorrow marks the anniversary of our foolish contemporary, Chap
arral. Founded in 1899 by Bristow Adams, now a professor at Columbia,
it is the fifth oldest college comic in the United States. A colorful and
enviable past makes the history of Chaparral as interesting as the romance
of the University which harbors it.
A corner in an Encina room was the first Chaparral office. There
Bristow Adams, with the assistance of Chris Bradley, the first "Old
Boy," and Larry Bowman conceived and published the first "Chappie."
In this edition appeared the "Now that" beginnings for editorials used
by all succeeditig editors. The cover picture was of a jester which was
later transferred to the editorial page. Came a period of expansion and
improvement on the original editions. Men now prominent in letters and
art caught the spirit of the "Old Boy" and added their names to the
masthead. Wallace and Will Irwin and Bruce Bliven first limbered their
gifted pens writing Chaparral copy. Jimmy Swinnerton, "Monk" Antrim,
artd "Feg" Murray have been frequent art contributors. And the "Old
Boy" moved along.
Since 1906 the magazine has been published by the Hammer and
Coffin Society, a national organization founded here on the eve of the
earthquake.
Nelson Carter, the present editor, has caught the spirit of "Chappie's"
glamorous past and reproduced it in a notable anniversary edition. The
cover, designed by Ted Krough, effectively bridges the first Chaparral
with the present.
Long may the "Old Boys" continue to amuse college students in keep
ing with their thirty-year heritage.
