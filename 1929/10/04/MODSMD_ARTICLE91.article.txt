# YES, WE ARE COLLEGIATE

Boys will be boys. This was evidenced by the warm but somewhat
damp reception the freshmen gave their sophomore brothers Wednesday
night.
Stanford has progressed far from the days when the freshmen were
subjected to severe and harsh hazing. Contrary to the cynics, we believe
the modern underclassmen are certainly as red-blooded and much more
polite than their predecessors of a generation ago. In those "good old
days," the sophomores did not conduct themselves according to Hoyle.
They entered Encina in the wee small hours of the morning and rudely
awakened its astonished and helpless inmates. Then followed wanton
destruction of the hall and physical torture of its occupants. This was
all done in the name of "higher education."
Wednesday night, however, the freshmen were warned that the hoary
sophomores were coming over to pay them a visit. They hastily prepared
a hospitable reception. A small fraction of the get-together was held in
the spacious but barren foyer of the hall. Later activities were trans
ferred to the front lawn. After getting intimately acquainted, the par
ticipants went home, satisfied that they had enjoyed a sociable evening.
A decided contrast with the raids of twenty years ago.
This type of demonstration is not to be wholly condemned. The prop
erty damage was slight. As long as freshmen and sophomores must have
their parties, it is well to let them get it out of their systems as soon as
possible. Witthe approaching doom of the Lower Division, Stanford's
days for such affairs are limited. Then they will soon become memories,
but WIIAT memories!
