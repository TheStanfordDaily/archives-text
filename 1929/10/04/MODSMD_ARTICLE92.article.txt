# PRAISE WHERE IT IS DUE
## 
### 
In some universities, campus newspapers publish pitiful editorials
every fall exhorting students to turn out and cheer for the struggling,
tail-end eleven that happens to be representing dear old Siwash that
season. It's a long, hard task, very nearly impossible, to manufacture
enthusiasm for an unsuccessful team.
Stanford has had splendid gridiron machines for several years now,
and the 1929 model Warnermen look as though they would maintain the
tradition; so the Stanford Daily need not waste ink urging the student
body to do right by its football warriors.
But the Daily docs wish to congratulate Glenn S. Warner and his
players on the fine showing they have made so far this season; and it
wishes them every success tomorrow in the first conference tilt against
Oregon as well as in the games to come.
