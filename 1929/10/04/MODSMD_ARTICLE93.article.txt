At the beginning of every fall quarter a great deal is said and written
concerning the necessity of new students accomplishing that acrobatic
feat of "getting on the boat." The newcomers usually proceed to do
about as they please: some board the vessel and some remain on the dry
land of their individuality.
So wc merely suggest (not urge) the freshmen to make the traditional
pilgrimage tonight to the President's reception at his house on Lagunita
Knoll. ItTs quite worth while, even from a strictly materialistic point of
view. There will be dancing and punch (possibly sandwiches). And
from another point of view, it is quite worth while to become acquainted
with members of the class—especially those from down Roble way. We
understand, by the by, that the Bastille's new inmates are goodly and
passing fair.
And if the President, a busy man, is willing to extend his hospitality
to a class, it is only courtesy for its members to respond.
We suggest, further, that the freshmen tear themselves out of bed
early enough Sunday morning to attend the matriculation services in the
Memorial Church. It will be nice for them to see the mosaics at least
once before they graduate.
