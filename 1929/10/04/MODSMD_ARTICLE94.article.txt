### PHILIP SPACE 
HOW FAMOUS AUTHORS GOT
THEIR PEN NAMES
OERHAPS you have been wondering
how famous authors got their pen
names. (Ah ha, 'fess up now, kiddies!)
Well, Professor Philip Space and I
have been making just the bestest
investigation of this subject you ever
saw, or below, or somewhere around
here, anyway. (What did that name
of-a-name janitor do with the waste
basket?)
It seems that (here werettwito â€”it
seems that back in the merry old
nineteenth century (or WAS it the
nineteenth century?), anway a oui- oui
French lad decided he wanted to be a
writer. His name was Alexandre
Smoot (or, as the French say,
Smooth). One day he happened to be
idly concealing a large blob of rasp
berry jam behind his back. His
mother, a Mrs. Whortleberri, stum
bled in.
"Alexandre, give that Dumas!" she
commanded.
"Gripes, that's a good pen name,"
said the lad, and so it proved to be.
The jam was forgotten in the elation
of the moment as mother and son
joined hands and danced about. It
later turned up on the seat of Alex
andre's trousers.
An American named Thorne was tell
ing a 'joke.
"Haw, Thorne, that Is a good one,"
chuckled a friend.
"And THAT is a good non-de
ploom!" exclaimed Nate Thorne, or
Haw-Thorne.
The same problem confronted an
other contemporary "Yankee."
"Whittier going to call yourself,
John?" asked an enemy.
"Just that!" exclaimed the good
gray "poet" triumphantly as a light
broke, throwing glass all over. His
middle name was Greenteeth, which
he later changed to Greenleaf.
"I want a pseudonym," suddenly an
nounced a quietly annoying English
"lassie" one day.
"Now, Georgette, nice girls don't
do such things," admonished her
shocked "mater."
"Hell," said the tot, "I am going to
call myself George Eliot, after an
uncle, who is named Geogre Elliot,
and I am going to write tomes."
And that is exactly what happened,
as Professor Space and I have dis
covered. We also discovered some
other things which we are looking
over very carefully. Come around to
the side door, guyn.
A young Gaelic, or Gallic, youth
called Victor was born in a large fam
ily, by large parents, whose name
was Withelde. By the time he "grew
up" he had a lot of family companions,
whom he laughingly called brothers
and sisters.
They all took turns doing chores,
going to the grocery store, cleaning
out the chimney, and so forth. One
day Oscarina refused point-blank to
do the errands, pleading indisposition,
or bad disposition, one of the two.
"All right for you, you brat," mur
mured the more infere. "Victor, Hugo."
"That will be a fine pen name,"
said the youth, "and will you have
rhubarb or eggplant along with the

'fish'?"
"Shut up," said the "madre," and
so he did.
So endeth the lesson.
Professor Space may be seen any
morning in Room 243'/ z B the Men
tal Sciences Building for further in
formation, which he is always reluc
tant to give.
