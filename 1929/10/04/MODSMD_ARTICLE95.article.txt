WE HAD TO SEE ROGERS
Will Rogers makes Owen Davis'
adaption of Homer Croy's "They Had
to See Paris" a thoroughly enjoyable
picture. In spite of a trite plot, this
newest product of the Phonograph
Photoplay manages to be amusing and
human throughout. It has a deft sim
plicity of treatment, and the cast is
really "superlative" for a change.
While you were away for the sum
mer William Fox got out with a pick
and shovel and dwarfed the San Fran
cisco Civic Auditorium with the larg
est exhibition of Rococoism to be seen
anywhere in the world.
It is on the Fox screen, barely dis
cernible from vast heights encom
passed by architectural pomposities
which offer final proof that there was
insanity in the French royal line, that
Will Rogers drawls his humble com
edy.
"They Had to See Paris" is your
first chance to see the Fox legitimate
ly. That is, it is the first picture
worthy of the cathedral. Only a Cecil
B. DeMille "super," with Mary Magda
lene driving her chariot drawn by
spotted leopards, could really do the
joint justice.
We won't delineate the plot. You
had better go and laugh for yourself.
Of course, Rogers is the common clod,
local garage owner and humorist in
Claremore, Oklahoma, whose wife's
social ambitions are spurred when a
gusher comes in $4000 worth every
day.
So Opal, the charming daughter, is
matched off with an insidious young
French count when they persuade
Pike to go to Paris, and the son gets
into a bad Bohemian set. Pike is the
big drag on the family ambitions, but
he eventually brings his wife and
kids to terms, and all is jake.
Aside from Rogers, who gives a
droll performance, the chief item of
interest is one Fifi Dorsay, a viva

cious French lass less obvious than
Clara Bow but with the same general
effect on the nervous system. She is
intriguing.
Old stuff there is in abundance in
"They Had to See Paris" but it is
well-handled, and the picture presents
an authenticity rare in movie com
edies.
We must except that lovely Gallic
pastoral scene where the Pike family
drives up a winding road in their
French car with their newly purchased
Chateau lovely in the shimmering dis
tance of a Hollywood backdrop.

B. DeMille "super," with Mary Magda
lene driving her chariot drawn by
spotted leopards, could really do the
joint justice.
We won't delineate the plot. You
had better go and laugh for yourself.
Of course, Rogers is the common clod,
local garage owner and humorist in
Claremore, Oklahoma, whose wife's
social ambitions are spurred when a
gusher comes in $4000 worth every
day.
So Opal, the charming daughter, is
matched off with an insidious young
French count when they persuade
Pike to go to Paris, and the son gets
into a bad Bohemian set. Pike is the
big drag on the family ambitions, but
he eventually brings his wife and
kids to terms, and all is jake.
Aside from Rogers, who gives a
droll performance, the chief item of
interest is one Fifi Dorsay, a viva

cious French lass less obvious than
Clara Bow but with the same general
effect on the nervous system. She is
intriguing.
Old stuff there is in abundance in
"They Had to See Paris" but it is
well-handled, and the picture presents
an authenticity rare in movie com
edies.
We must except that lovely Gallic
pastoral scene where the Pike family
drives up a winding road in their
French car with their newly purchased
Chateau lovely in the shimmering dis
tance of a Hollywood backdrop.
WE HAD TO SEE ROGERS
Will Rogers makes Owen Davis'
adaption of Homer Croy's "They Had
to See Paris" a thoroughly enjoyable
picture. In spite of a trite plot, this
newest product of the Phonograph
Photoplay manages to be amusing and
human throughout. It has a deft sim
plicity of treatment, and the cast is
really "superlative" for a change.
While you were away for the sum
mer William Fox got out with a pick
and shovel and dwarfed the San Fran
cisco Civic Auditorium with the larg
est exhibition of Rococoism to be seen
anywhere in the world.
It is on the Fox screen, barely dis
cernible from vast heights encom
passed by architectural pomposities
which offer final proof that there was
insanity in the French royal line, that
Will Rogers drawls his humble com
edy.
"They Had to See Paris" is your
first chance to see the Fox legitimate
ly. That is, it is the first picture
worthy of the cathedral. Only a Cecil
B. DeMille "super," with Mary Magda
lene driving her chariot drawn by
spotted leopards, could really do the
joint justice.
