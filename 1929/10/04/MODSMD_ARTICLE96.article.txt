# IMAGINE AUNT SOPHIE'S EMBARRASSMENT!
## 
### 
"Cradle Snatchers" on the screen
is still as bawdy as movies are likely
to be. Aunt Sophie had better see
"The Innocents of Paris." As "Ima
gine My Embarrassment," Russell
Medcraft's pioneer venture in the
doubtful comedy possibilities of the
gigolo industry made its bow at the
Fox a bit ago. We saw it on the other
side of the bay, at the Oakland, a
new movie palace almost as blatant,
but in far worse taste, than the al
leged 5 million simoleon Fox barn.
Walter Catlett is funnier on the
stage. Sue Carol, when she starts to
talk and sing, is no longer your Dream
Girl. Not that she is coarse. She is
just ordinary—not the rare jewel that
Douglas McLean exhibited for the
first time on "Soft Cushions."
"Imagine My Embarrassment" has
its amusing moments. It will doubt
less tickle many an average rib. But
it isn't notable, and it isn't quite the
kind of humor you are proudest to
have laughed about.
Incidentally that "old soldiers never
die —they only fade away" song bit is
a pleasant idea, but the rest of the
words aren't much.
See "Imagine My Embarrassment"
when it comes around if it will keep
you from playing bridge.
