# Swain Commends Jordan Foresight In First Assembly
## A.W.S.-A.S.S.U. Presidents Emphasize Co-operation In Student Body 
### 
"Almost forty years ago Doctor Jor
dan and a small group of scholars
journeyed across this continent to
found a school on this western fron
tier of America. The strength and the
power and the spirit that are Stan
ford's today come to us because
those men were strong and able. They
left us a heritage and it is your
privilege and my privilege to guard
it," Acting-President Swain said in his
address to the new students at the
annual welcoming assembly Friday
morning.
Dr. Swain traced the course of edu
cation up through the ages and con
cluded his speech with a few words
about the honor code and the question
of liquor on the campus.
Benetta Merner, president of A.W.S.,
gave a short talk stressing the value
of vocational guidance and its im
portance in the University. She also
spoke of the part that women should
play in student government. Stanford's
student body president, Stanford
Steinbeck, welcomed the new stu
dents and told them the best way to
fit in to the scheme of Stanford af
fairs. "This University is something
more than a place for learning how
to make a living in this world. There
is a cultural side of the school that
will enable us in laters years to bet
ter enjoy life, and this is one of the
most important things we can get
from university training," he con
cluded.
At the end of the assembly, Paul
Speegle, head yell leader, made an ap
peal for a real cheering section at
football games. The assembly was
closed with the singing of the Stan
ford Hymn.
