# YEARLING GRIDDERS, MENLO TEAM FIGHT TO 13-13 TIE
## 
### Don Oswill 
A crippled Stanford freshman foot
ball team battled the strong Menlo
Junior College eleven to a 13 to 13
tie here Saturday afternoon as a pre
liminary to the Stanford Varsity-Ore
gon game. It was a ragged contest,
with neither side displaying a smooth
brand of football and both teams mak
ing numerous fumbles.
Menlo opened the scoring after ten
minutes of play in the first quarter.
Two long forward passes, with Pars
low tossing and Pozzo receiving, car
ried the junior collegians from mid
field to the frosh three-yard line where
Bozzo, on a run around right end,
scored the first touchdown. Campbell
added the extra point with a place
kick.
Ken AfTlerbaugh, flashy Cardinal
half from Pomona, grabbed the ball
on the kick-off, and behind some fine
interference, ran it back to a touch
down. This run was more remarkable
for the fact that Afflerbaugh fumbled
the ball, then recovered on his own
fifteen-yard lino and dashed eighty
five yards through a broken field for

a score. Stevens failed to convert, and
the opening of the second quarter
found the Card yearlings trailing, 7
to 6.
On a series of power plays, the baby
Redshirts carried the ball to the
Jaysee eleven-yard line only to lose it
on a fumble. Menlo punted to midfield
from where the frosh pulled a forward
lateral pass play which netted thirty
five yards. Two off-tackle reverses
failed to penetrate the Menlo line, but
on a third try Afflerbaugh made ten
yards around end to the Jaysee eight
yard mark. Stevens smashed through
to a touchdown and then converted
to make the score 13 to 7.
On the first play after the kick-off,
Romadka, a fleet Menlo half, skirted
the Cardinal left Aving for sixty yards.
After three tries Parslow smashed
through guard for the necessary four
yards and brought the score to a tie.
The frosh linemen broke through to
block Campbell's attempted place
kick, and the count ended in a dead
lock.
