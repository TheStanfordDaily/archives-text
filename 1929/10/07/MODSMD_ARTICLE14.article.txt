# YEARLING GRIDDERS, MENLO TEAM FIGHT TO 13-13 TIE
## 
### Don Oswill 
A crippled Stanford freshman foot
ball team battled the strong Menlo
Junior College eleven to a 13 to 13
tie here Saturday afternoon as a pre
liminary to the Stanford Varsity-Ore
gon game. It was a ragged contest,
with neither side displaying a smooth
brand of football and both teams mak
ing numerous fumbles.
Menlo opened the scoring after ten
minutes of play in the first quarter.
Two long forward passes, with Pars
low tossing and Pozzo receiving, car
ried the junior collegians from mid
field to the frosh three-yard line where
Bozzo, on a run around right end,
scored the first touchdown. Campbell
added the extra point with a place
kick.
Ken AfTlerbaugh, flashy Cardinal
half from Pomona, grabbed the ball
on the kick-off, and behind some fine
interference, ran it back to a touch
down. This run was more remarkable
for the fact that Afflerbaugh fumbled
the ball, then recovered on his own
fifteen-yard lino and dashed eighty
five yards through a broken field for

a score. Stevens failed to convert, and
the opening of the second quarter
found the Card yearlings trailing, 7
to 6.
On a series of power plays, the baby
Redshirts carried the ball to the
Jaysee eleven-yard line only to lose it
on a fumble. Menlo punted to midfield
from where the frosh pulled a forward
lateral pass play which netted thirty
five yards. Two off-tackle reverses
failed to penetrate the Menlo line, but
on a third try Afflerbaugh made ten
yards around end to the Jaysee eight
yard mark. Stevens smashed through
to a touchdown and then converted
to make the score 13 to 7.
On the first play after the kick-off,
Romadka, a fleet Menlo half, skirted
the Cardinal left Aving for sixty yards.
After three tries Parslow smashed
through guard for the necessary four
yards and brought the score to a tie.
The frosh linemen broke through to
block Campbell's attempted place
kick, and the count ended in a dead
lock.
While "Husky" Hunt's Stanford
the coast.
The new Iron Man (Rothert played
all but one minute Saturday and
stayed in the whole game against the
Olympic Club) punted well, one of
his boots getting off for some fifty
yards; tossed some neat passes, about
like Bill Simkins throws; and ripped
off ample yards while packing the
pigskin. Number "32" will be heard
from a lot during the rest of the sea
son.
Moffatt Shows Well
Pop put in a lot of subs before the
final gun, and could not be but pleased
with the showing ihey made. In fact,
some of the regulars will have to
watch their step from now on, or may
find themselves sitting on the side
lines. Phil Moffatt, at half, returned
punts and reversed the ends a la
Hyland in his prime. Harry Hillman,
Ray Dawson, "Red" Thompson, Rudy
Rintala, and the other reserves all
looked like polished players.
The passing was rather spotty at
times Saturday, as was the receiving
of passes. Several cinch passes were
muffed, and too many of them were
thrown directly into the outstretched
arms of Oregon players. A number
of the Webfooters' tosses were also
completed, though they should have
been knocked down for no gain. The
team will work overtime during the
next few weeks in trying to iron out
these weaknesses.
Saturday's game showed one thing
—that Pop is not going to hold his
offense in check this year, no matter
what the score reads. He used enough
reverses, laterals, passes, and tricks
against Oregon to befuddle a dozen
teams.

The new Iron Man (Rothert played
all but one minute Saturday and
stayed in the whole game against the
Olympic Club) punted well, one of
his boots getting off for some fifty
yards; tossed some neat passes, about
like Bill Simkins throws; and ripped
off ample yards while packing the
pigskin. Number "32" will be heard
from a lot during the rest of the sea
son.
Moffatt Shows Well
Pop put in a lot of subs before the
final gun, and could not be but pleased
with the showing ihey made. In fact,
some of the regulars will have to
watch their step from now on, or may
find themselves sitting on the side
lines. Phil Moffatt, at half, returned
punts and reversed the ends a la
Hyland in his prime. Harry Hillman,
Ray Dawson, "Red" Thompson, Rudy
Rintala, and the other reserves all
looked like polished players.
The passing was rather spotty at
times Saturday, as was the receiving
of passes. Several cinch passes were
muffed, and too many of them were
thrown directly into the outstretched
arms of Oregon players. A number
of the Webfooters' tosses were also
completed, though they should have
been knocked down for no gain. The
team will work overtime during the
next few weeks in trying to iron out
these weaknesses.
Saturday's game showed one thing
—that Pop is not going to hold his
offense in check this year, no matter
what the score reads. He used enough
reverses, laterals, passes, and tricks
against Oregon to befuddle a dozen
teams.
A crippled Stanford freshman foot
ball team battled the strong Menlo
Junior College eleven to a 13 to 13
tie here Saturday afternoon as a pre
liminary to the Stanford Varsity-Ore
gon game. It was a ragged contest,
with neither side displaying a smooth
brand of football and both teams mak
ing numerous fumbles.
Menlo opened the scoring after ten
minutes of play in the first quarter.
Two long forward passes, with Pars
low tossing and Pozzo receiving, car
ried the junior collegians from mid
field to the frosh three-yard line where
Bozzo, on a run around right end,
scored the first touchdown. Campbell
added the extra point with a place
kick.
Ken AfTlerbaugh, flashy Cardinal
half from Pomona, grabbed the ball
on the kick-off, and behind some fine
interference, ran it back to a touch
down. This run was more remarkable
for the fact that Afflerbaugh fumbled
the ball, then recovered on his own
fifteen-yard lino and dashed eighty
five yards through a broken field for

a score. Stevens failed to convert, and
the opening of the second quarter
found the Card yearlings trailing, 7
to 6.
On a series of power plays, the baby
Redshirts carried the ball to the
Jaysee eleven-yard line only to lose it
on a fumble. Menlo punted to midfield
from where the frosh pulled a forward
lateral pass play which netted thirty
five yards. Two off-tackle reverses
failed to penetrate the Menlo line, but
on a third try Afflerbaugh made ten
yards around end to the Jaysee eight
yard mark. Stevens smashed through
to a touchdown and then converted
to make the score 13 to 7.
On the first play after the kick-off,
Romadka, a fleet Menlo half, skirted
the Cardinal left Aving for sixty yards.
After three tries Parslow smashed
through guard for the necessary four
yards and brought the score to a tie.
