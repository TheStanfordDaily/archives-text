# PRISON MUTINY CEASES, PROBE BEGUN AT ONGE
## Gallows For All Convicted in Penitentiary Riot, Officials Predict 
### 
CANON CITY, Colo., Oct. 6. (.fP)—
The Colorado state penitentiary, scene
of the most deadly prison riot in the
history of the country, today was en
deavoring to resume its normal rou
tine.
A. H. Davis and Leo W. McGentry
are held in solitary confinement as
instigators of the bloody riot which
resulted in the death of the twelve
men, seven of them prison guards
and five convicts.
Prison, local, and state officials
have promised that any man found
guilty of conspiracy to aid in the riot
which has nearly demolished the Colo
rado state penitentiary, will hang.
Three men are suspected. Davis
and McGentry are two of the men
who have come under official scrutiny
as possible ringleaders in the con
spiracy. The officials also are investi
gating the possibility that certain of
the prison guards may have been in
volved in the plot.
Warden F. E. Crawford, whose ef
forts led to the conclusion of the riot
without a single prisoner escaping, to
day refused to accuse any guard of
having been implicated in the con
spiracy.
The warden, however, did not deny
that the fatal revolvers might have
been smuggled in by guards who were
friendly to the prisoners.
"No one is under official suspicion
at this time," he said, "but we are in
vestigating every possible angle of the
riot and its terrible conclusion.
"As far as we can determine from
prisoners and guards, the chief ring
leaders in the riot are dead —the re
sults of their efforts to secure free
dom."
