# Annual Lower Class Tussle Scheduled for Tomorrow Afternoon
## 
### 
In the second annual tie-up since
the abolition of the traditional mud
fight, Sophomores and Freshmen will
be given a chance tomorrow after
noon to finish their tussle of last
Wednesday night. The two hordes are
scheduled to clash in the stadium at
3 o'clock. The fray will last 15 min
utes.
Organization of the conflicting
mobs is already under way. The
Sophomores are meeting tonight un
der Carl Cartwright in Room 214 of
the English building for the election
of leaders; while Encina sponsors will
set things humming for the frosh very
soon.
Block "S" men and members of
Skull and Snakes will be on hand to
morrow to see that the rules are ob
served, and to set all broken bones
resulting. They are requested to be
present at the scene of battle by
2:45 p.m.
A 1 Masters requests that spectators
keep off the turf playing field. The
Stanford turf is the finest on the
Pacific Coast, and it is desirable that
it should remain so. Contestants are
required to wear soft-soled shoes.
Only soft rope may be used.
Theoretically the winning side is
determined by the number of the op
posing faction securely bound by the
end of the contest. The Sophomores
are certain to get the decision, al
though there is much speculation as
to who will actually win. Carl Cart
wright, Sophomore leader, is reported
as having uttered this terrifying prog
nostication! "We won't stop until
every grovelling frosh is tied up and
put away."
