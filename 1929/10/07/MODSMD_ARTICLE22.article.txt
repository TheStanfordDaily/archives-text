# Tariff Settlement Hoped For This Week In Senate
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6. (/p)—'With
two months left in which to do it
much work to be done and less than
before the special session ends, the
Senate will start its fifth week on the
tariff bill tomorrow with Republican
leaders hopeful that the highly con
tested rate schedules will be reached
for consideration within a few days.
Democrats see no reason why the
first rate section —embracing chemi
cals, oils, and paints—should not be
ready for debate by the middle of the
week, but they have injected a last
minute issue into the dispute over the
administrative provisions that might
delay consideration of rates until the
latter part of the week.
