# WARNER'S .CARDS SHOW STRENGTH IN OREGON ROUT
## Stanford Men Defeat Highly Touted Team of Northern School by 33 to 7 Score ”Power Trust" Plays, Passing Attack Wreck Conference Title Hopes of Invaders 
### Stephen Dietrich 
What started like a successful in
vasion from the Northwest turned out
to be an overwhelming rout, when a
powerful Cardinal football team
turned back Oregon by a score of
33 to 7 Saturday at the Stanford Sta
dium in the first Coast Conference
game of the season.
Oregon, touted as the outstanding
team in its section of the country,
was practically put out of the Coast
title race by the defeat, while at the
same time Stanford was established
as THE team to beat. Although the
Webfooters put up a hard fight, it was
a hopeless one, and they can not be
considered in the same class as Coach
Warner's men.
Yet things looked bad for the home
team in the initial stages of the game.
Far from being a push-over, Oregon
displayed a stubborn defense and took
advantage of a break to shove over
the first score of the day early in the
second quarter. While the lemon-yel
low squad made only one first down
during the opening half, that one
down was converted into seven
points on a long pass and kick for
goal.
Oregon's Defense Cracks
Once the Cards got going, however,
Oregon's defense cracked wide open.
Hard smashnig by Stanford's line and
power backfield, combined with warm
weather, began to tell 011 Coach Mc-
Ewan's men soon after the initial
score, and enabled the big red outfit
to pound out two touchdowns before
the half ended. The remainder of the
game was a walk-away for Stanford,
and gave Warner a chance to inject
a large number of substitutes into
the lineup.
Although playing ragged ball at
times, the Cards showed all that was
expected of them —and then some.
The whole line stood up well, both
offensively and defensively. It Is in
teresting to note that Oregon failed
to make a single first down through
the line or around Hie ends. Califor
nia, U.S.C., and the other teams on
Stanford's schedule are going to find
line bucking a tough problem.
Muller, Heinecke Good
Captain Muller played a great game
at end, especially in snagging passes.
Perhaps the outstanding man on the
field was Walt Heinecke. He made
more tackles than anyone else, was
first man down under most of the
punts, and generally outplayed the
much-heralded Stadelman, who didn't
do so bad himself, at center.
Herb Fleislihacker was all there at
defense as usual, though playing with
a sore arm, and crashed through with
a couple of long gains. Chuck Small
ing and Lud Frentrup made plenty
of yardage, while Harlow Rothert dis
played enough to mark him as one of
the outstaning triple threat men on
freshman team showed a decided im
provement over last week's exhibi-1
tion, there are still some rough spots
to be smoothed over. The frosh line
was undoubtedly weakened by the ab-:
sence of two injured tackles, as was i
shown by the yardage made through
the weak spots.
