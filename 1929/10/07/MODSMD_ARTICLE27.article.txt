# IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU

Stanford will be provided with another hearty laugh tomorrow when
male members of the freshman and sophomore classes repair to the
Stadium turf for their "traditional" wrestling match which someone
humorously called a "tieup."
Last year certain master minds concluded that the annual interclass
mud fight was too rough for the specimens of virile young manhood which
Stanford is now admitting to its select circle of the mental elite. In fact,
they concluded that the mud fight was altogether uncouth, ungentlemanly,
and naughty.
So the tie-up was trotted out as a panacea for all the ills of interclass
conflict. Doubtfully, though hopefully, the student body turned out to
witness a fiasco of such magnitude that it made last spring's fraternity
rushing look like a well-ordered plan.
The big manly men of each class jogged out on the field, played tag
for a while, and slapped one another on the wrist. Then a few of the
more brawny exhibited the latest strangle holds and wrapped their op
ponents' wrists in cotton batting. The Block "S" men, selected to guard
the participants against unfair play and injury, were the hit of the after
noon. They gave a perfect imitation of a flock of hens, clucking over a
group of erring chicks.
Yes, it was a memorable day!
Perhaps the master minds who thought of this substitute will have
tomorrow's party more satisfactorily planned. The Daily takes this
opportunity to suggest that if such is not the case, we either abandon
frosh-soph rumpuses or return to the mud fight.
