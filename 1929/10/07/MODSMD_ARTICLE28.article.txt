After Acting-President Swain's reference to the Honor Code at the
assembly Friday, followed by Dean Culver's pertinent remarks at the
Matriculation Services Sunday, the new students at Stanford should

By some queer quirk, freshmen feel that they must throw off all their
"old ideals" and substitute them with new and sophisticated ones. Cheat

over on the proctor, who gave each inmate a paralyzing look if he dared
move. No such condition exists here, mainly because the professors leave
the rooms during an examination. It is not modern, it is not sophisticated,
it is not "collegiate" to cheat at Stanford. The vast majority of normal
minded students are still old-fashioned enough to believe in and uphold
the Honor Code.
It is up to the members of the Class of 1933 to step in line and do
the same.
