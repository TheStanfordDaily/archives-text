# RIGHT NUMBERS NOW

These dial telephones may be a nuisance to indolent college students,
but they have at least one compensating feature. No longer will it be
necessary sarcactically to ask, "What wrong number must I call to get
Palo Alto 5555 ?"
If Bell Telephone Company figures are to be believed you should get
about half as many wrong numbers, and it is your own fault if you do.
Despite all jokes about inefficiency of "hello girls," the company claims
that only twenty-three wrong numbers are given per thousand calls. Of
that number, the company will assume responsibility for only thirteen.
The remaining ten are due to faulty ennunciation, tricks of memory
whereby the numbers are given in transposed order, or an error in finding
the correct number to call.
It can be seen that, if official reports are based on correct observation
only the last two errors are possible with the new system. At that, the
operator's voice will be missed!
