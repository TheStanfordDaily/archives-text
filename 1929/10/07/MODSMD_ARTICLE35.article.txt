## MAKES APOLOGY 
### 
To the Students of Stanford Univer
sity and to the general public:
I hereby publicly apologize for the
injury and humiliation done to the
person of Ralph Malcolm, Captain of
Stanford Athletic Events Police Squad,
at the Olympic Club-Stanford football
game played in the Stanford Stadium,

Acknowledgement is made that the
act was one committed in a moment
of rashness on my part and at the
disadvantage of the injured.
â€”Frank Marisch, Manager
