# SPORTS OF 1929

### BY FEG MURRAY 
If Miller Huggins had died about
six years ago, many people would have
mourned, but few would have ac
claimed him a great manager. And
that, mind you, just after the "Yan
kees had won three pennants for Hug
gins." Now they say, "Huggins won
six pennants with the Yankees," and
realize that the Mite Manager had just
as much to do with the victories as
more colorful pilots like McGraw or
Stallings.
Two things I admired most about
Huggins were that when he won he
never gloated or boasted, and when
he lost he went down fighting and was
sane enough to see that it was "the
law of averages" and so began build
ing for the future. Huggins lacked
color, but he showed the stuff of
which he was made by overcoming

I the hostility of the high-priced bunch
j of prima donnus whom he was brought
j from St. Louis 10 manage, and he not
only won their respect by his ability
as a baseball manager but also their
friendship.
In the last nine years, Miller Hug
gins won six pennants, three world's
championships, and finished second
twice! And his team won eight suc
cessive world series game in 1927 and
'28. This is the finest record ever
made by any manager. But he left
much more than that, his record, be
hind him. He was shrewd and practi
cal and reserved, but he was wise and
patient and kindly, and in spite of
many handicaps to overcome he came
out on top, and died almost "with his
spikes on" as a real fighter would
want to do.


He Went Down Fighting
