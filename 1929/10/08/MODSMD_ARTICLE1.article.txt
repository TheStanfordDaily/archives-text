# EXPECT RETURN OF INJURED MEN TO LINEUP SOON
## Rothert Newest Addition to Injury List with Bruised Knee; Hard Workout Warner Will Probably Take Entire Squad to L.A. Next Thursday for Bruin Game 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Barring unforeseen complications,
all of the men now on Stanford's
lengthy hospital list should be in
shape to see action by the time of the
Oregon State football game a week
from Saturday, according to Dr. E. F.
Roth, team physician.
Accompanying this bit of good news
to practice yesterday afternoon, how
ever, was a new addition to the group
of injured players. Harlow Rothert,
who showed up so well at half against
the Webfooters, reported on the field
limping around with a bruised knee.
Rotliert's injury is slight, though,
and may not keep him out of the
lineup in the U.C.L.A. game at Los
Angeles this week. His absence would
prove a big handicap to the Cards;
for with Bill Simkins still on the side
lines, the team would be without the
services of its two best passers and
its outstanding punter.
Besides Rothert and Simkins the
hospital list, all members of which
are out because of knee injuries, still
includes Johnny Preston, end, and
Erhorn, tackle. Elwood Wilson, Kay
Albertson, and Mar Albertson were
all back in suits again yesterday, and
are ready to play Saturday.
Although the practice was light,
as most Monday sessions are, Pop
put the members of the varsity squad
who failed to get into the Oregon
game through an hour's scrimmage,
following a short chalk talk. Guido
Caglieri looked good at one of the
halfback positions, and reeled off a
couple of nice runs.
Today's workout will probably be a
tough one, as Coach Warner is not
underrating the U.C.L.A. squad, even
though it was trampled on two weeks
ago by the Thundering Herd. The
Cards are scheduled to leave for the
South on Thursday, and it is quite
probable that the entire squad will be
taken along.
