# RENEWED BREAK FEARED AS GUNS FOUND IN PRISON
## Investigators Quiz Convicts To Reconstruct Story Of Bloody Mutiny 
### 
CANON CITY, Colo., Oct. 7. (&)—
Tenseness, brought about by a belief
that more guns were secreted about
the Colorado state penitentiary here,
today gripped watchful guards and
officials.
During the investigation today, the
possibility developed that perhaps 20
or 30 convicts might have been in
volved in the riot, although no official
statement to this effect was made.
The investigators, however, said they
were convinced that at least seven
guns used by the mutineers were still
hidden in the prison. In some quarters
the fear of a further outbreak was
expressed.
Coincident with putting a second
convict in solitary confinement, search
of the institution yesterday revealed
I two revolvers hidden in a coal pile.
The noose dangled close to three
heads as a result of the investigation
and findings thus far, it was generally
understood, with the official inquiry
just getting under way in full force.
One official said he was certain five
convicts in the prison were armed —
that is, they had arms hidden which
a careful search had failed to disclose.
Charles Davis was ordered placed
in solitary confinement and soon after
this action, two revolvers were found
and Leo W. McGenty, 25, Denver gun
man, was ordered confined. Both of
these men, Warden P. E. Crawford
said, were in possession of weapons
when the mutiny in the prison broke
out. Before this mutiny was over Fri- i
day morning, after 18 hours of war,
twelve men had lost their lives. Seven
were guards and five were convicts.
Four of the convicts were killed by
Danny Daniels, leader of the revolt,
who then ended his own life and with
it ended the revolt.
