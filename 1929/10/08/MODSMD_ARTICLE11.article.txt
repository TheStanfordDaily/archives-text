# ITALIAN PROFESSOR WILL SPEAK ABOUT NATIVE LITERATURE
## 
### 
"Modern Tendencies in Italian
Literature" is the subject upon which
Professor Guido Ferrando, professor
of English Literature at the Univer
sity of Florence, will address students
and the public tonight in the Assem
bly Hall at 7:30 o'clock. This will be
the second lecture of the 1929-30 Tues
day evening series.
Professor Ferrando, who is a Ph.D.
of the University of Pisa, has lectured
extensively all over Europe, and this
year has given two courses of Italian
and Comparative English and Italian
Literature at Columbia University.
It was entirely due to his efforts that
the famous Italo Britannic Institute in
Florence was founded and received a
charter from the King of England.
The Institute, of which Professor Fer
rando is now Vice-Director, is the
most important center of English cul
ture in Italy today.
