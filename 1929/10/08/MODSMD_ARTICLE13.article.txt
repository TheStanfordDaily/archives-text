# CHAPPIE TO OBSERVE THIRTIETH BIRTHDAY WITH AVIATION ISSUE
## 
### 
Just to show his friends around the
campus that he is not so aged as some
of his contemporaries would have
him, the Old Boy is going to spring
something Thursday that he believes
will have the local boys and girls in
a fever of excitement for some time
to come. On his thirtieth birthday
Thursday, he will inagurate a number
of changes that he hopes may rank
Stanford's venerable comic magazine
as being slightly more than abreast
of the times.
The Old Boy has elected to make
his first issue a tribute to the progress
he has seen in the field of aviation.
He expects to soar to great heights
in presenting a noteworthy variety of
talent.
The art work Is notable for a num
ber of clever drawings which feature
the humorous work of Berk Anthony,
the finished artistry of Harold Helven
ston, the original cartooning of Bur
nell Gould, and last but not least, the
striking black and white sketches of
Gregor Duncan, featured in the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin.
The Old Boy has been aided by a
great collection of foolish wit, as ex
pressed by some local wags who de
vised their jokes during the summer
while the rest of the school was busy
acquiring a sun-tan. Bill Robinson, the
grand old man of American Verse,
with the aid of Berk Anthony's illus
trations, has created an epic concern
ing the downfall of "Ten Little Avi
ators Sitting on a Fence." Joe Thomp
son has reviewed the night life of
the city of the fog in a clever column
entitled "Town Talk."
