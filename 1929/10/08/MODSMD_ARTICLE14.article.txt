# NEW-COMERS AS WELL AS OLD-TIME FAVORITES TO BE IN "IVORY DOOR"
## 
### Elizabeth Larsh 
What A. A. Milne believes to be |
the best play he has ever written,
"The Ivory Door," will be presented
here next month by a cast in which
are included many old favorites and
many newcomers.
Unfortunately Milne's reputation as
the author of those delightful books
for children and grown-ups: "Now We
Are We Six," "Winnie the Pooh,"
"The House at Pooh Corner," and |
others, seems to overshadow his repu
tation as a playwright whose dramas I
are far from whimsical. For this rea
son, his plays are at a disadvantage,
being tagged almost immediately as
"whimsical." But "The Ivory Door" —
as is his "The Truth About Blayds"—
is a beautiful, almost profound, fan
tasy with some very lovely symbolism |
in it. It is not a new idea —this repre- i
sentation of death by a doorway—but
Milne has handled it with extreme
grace and humor, and one almost j
might say with a gentle, satirical
smile.
The play centers about the young j

King Perivale who, determined to
solve the mystery of the ivory door
from which no one has ever returned,
crosses the threshold on the eve of
his marriage—in the last hours of his
independence. Princess Lilia, his be
trothed, follows him into the un
known; and when they both return
to the castle, this time by the front
door, neither is recognized by Peri
vale's court.
Paul Speegle and Katherine Kehoe,
both of whom are well-known to cam
pus audiences, will play King Peri
vale and Princess Lilia; and Stanley
Mullin, also possessed of a reputa
tion in dramatics here, will take the
part of Brand, King Perivale's man
servant. Other parts are being played
by Tom Henry, Irving Rosenblatt,
Elizabeth Ann Lynch, Lucile Morgan,
and Mary Edith Jones.
The following are asked to report
to Mr. Helvenston at 7 o'clock tonight:
Phoebe Plate, Harriet Sutton, Ruth
Ashen, Bob Perry, David Winkler,
Jean Haskell, William Poynter, Leo
Matesky, and Ed North.

What A. A. Milne believes to be |
the best play he has ever written,
"The Ivory Door," will be presented
here next month by a cast in which
are included many old favorites and
many newcomers.
Unfortunately Milne's reputation as
the author of those delightful books
for children and grown-ups: "Now We
Are We Six," "Winnie the Pooh,"
"The House at Pooh Corner," and |
others, seems to overshadow his repu
tation as a playwright whose dramas I
are far from whimsical. For this rea
son, his plays are at a disadvantage,
being tagged almost immediately as
"whimsical." But "The Ivory Door" —
as is his "The Truth About Blayds"—
is a beautiful, almost profound, fan
tasy with some very lovely symbolism |
in it. It is not a new idea —this repre- i
sentation of death by a doorway—but
Milne has handled it with extreme
grace and humor, and one almost j
might say with a gentle, satirical
smile.
The play centers about the young j

King Perivale who, determined to
solve the mystery of the ivory door
from which no one has ever returned,
crosses the threshold on the eve of
his marriage—in the last hours of his
independence. Princess Lilia, his be
trothed, follows him into the un
known; and when they both return
to the castle, this time by the front
door, neither is recognized by Peri
vale's court.
Paul Speegle and Katherine Kehoe,
both of whom are well-known to cam
pus audiences, will play King Peri
vale and Princess Lilia; and Stanley
Mullin, also possessed of a reputa
tion in dramatics here, will take the
part of Brand, King Perivale's man
servant. Other parts are being played
by Tom Henry, Irving Rosenblatt,
Elizabeth Ann Lynch, Lucile Morgan,
and Mary Edith Jones.
The following are asked to report
to Mr. Helvenston at 7 o'clock tonight:
Phoebe Plate, Harriet Sutton, Ruth
Ashen, Bob Perry, David Winkler,
Jean Haskell, William Poynter, Leo
Matesky, and Ed North.
