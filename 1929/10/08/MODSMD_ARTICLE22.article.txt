# FIFTY-FIVE ANSWER CALL FOR TRYOUTEES FOR EDITORIAL STAFF
## 
### 
Fifty-five men and women, of whom
nineteen were transfers from junior
colleges, entered the Daily editorial
staff tryouts, which started yesterday.
Any students who did not attend the
initial meeting yesterday, but who
wish to try out, may report at the
Daily office at 7 o'clock tonight, when
the tryoutees will meet to start work.
During the tryout period, work will
consist of practice in newswriting and
proof-reading,"and of office work. Beats
will be assigned after a few days, and
tryoutees will have a chance to see
what the work of a reporter is, and
to show what they can do in this line.
A considerable number of tryoutees
will be taken on the staff as reporters
at the end of the tryouts, and they
will be made responsible for covering
certain beats. The position of copy
editor is the next step on the editorial
staff, and the work in this post is
made up of writing headlines, copy
reading, and some news-writing. The
night editors are promoted from the
rank of copy-editor, and have the re
sponsibility of editing one paper each
week. The two associate editors and
the women's editor are chosen from
the five night editors. The associates,
after a half-year's work, run for the
position of editor, the staff members
acting as electors.
