# SOPHS CHOOSE 3 AS LEADERS FOR TODAY'S BATTLE
## Contestants Will Use Paint Instead of Axle-Grease to Save Stadium Turf Encina Frosh Will Be Ready When Contest Commences At 3 O'Clock Today 
### 
The rumbling is growing in Fresh
man and Sophomore camps as the op
posing classes are preparing for the
'32-'33 tie-up this afternoon in the
Stadium at 3 o'clock. Last night the
Sophs held a war meeting, at which
they chose Dick Broderick, Phil Wil
son, and Ernie Hatch to lead them in
the fray. The P'reslimen will be or
ganized under the direction of the En
cina sponsors immediately after lunch
today, and are already busy in prepar
ation for the scrap.
Contrary to conditions last year, the
two teams will not necessarily be of
equal number when they enter the
fight. All those who appear will be
allowed to join in the contest.
The Sophomores are found to be
strongly confident of the outcome, as
the final hour approaches. Since they
have never been known to lose a de
cision, the betting odds are greatly
in their favor; although the Frosh
are determined to tie up the greater
number of 1932 men, despite the hope
lessness of their being picked as win
ners.
There will be little trouble this
year in seeing which side is which
during the fight. The Frosh will be
painted with bright green numerals,
and the Sophs with bloody red.
No grease of any sort will be al
lowed, as a precaution against damag
ing the field. Last year the sophs used
fifteen dollars' worth of axle grease
to smear on their bodies.
The two hordes will start gathering
soon after lunch today, the freshmen
in front of Encina, and the sopho
mores between the gym and track
field. Both teams are expected to be
inside the Stadium by 2:30 o'clock
ready to open hostilities promptly at
3 o'clock.
Block "S" men and members of
Skull and Snakes will umpire the tie
up, and are requested to be on hand
at 2:45 o'clock. Spectators are asked
to keep off the playing turf.
