# THE 						TIE-UP GOES ON THE WITNESS STAND
## 
### 
The tie-up ? The mud-fight ? Or neither ? These are questions which
should be settled by the outcome of today's sophomore-freshman scrap.
The mud-fight was abolished because it was considered dangerous,
brutal, and unclean for the participants. There were rules. They were
never enforced because those in charge were afraid of getting thir cords
muddy if they should attempt to make the contest go according to the
regulations.
Then came the tie-up. In the language of the editor of Volume 74
last year's fracas was a ''perfect flop." There was complete lack of
organization on the part of those who undertook to manage the farce.
No excuse could be offered. The spectators and the general student body
were thoroughly disgusted. Onlookers swarmed down 011 the field. The
general policing facilities were too weak to cope with the situation. There
was general confusion. The hoax came to a climax when the so-called
"judges" gave the decision to the sophomores.
There should be no such re-occurrence this year. The Block "S"
men and the members of Skull and Snakes are physically and
mentally strong enough to force the rules, if they so desire. The crowd
should co-operate by keeping off of the field. Everything should be done
to give the tie-up a thorough and fair trial. The contest itself should be
conducted according to the rules. If it is predetermined that the sopho
more are going to win, why should the freshmen put up a good fight?
If the freshmen can win, in a fair contest â€”more power to them!
Tomorrow the interclass fight goes on the witness stand. If the tie-up
is a failure because of its own nature and not because the rules are dis
regarded, there are only two alternatives left: either revert to the mud
fight or abolish class scraps altogether. In any event conditions of previous
fights where the rules were not enforced should not be tolerated tomorrow.
