# A 						NEW DIPLOMACY
## 
### 
It is with more than passing interest that we read about Hoover's
conference with Premier Mac Donald of Great Britain in the fastness of
his Blue Ridge Mountain retreat. These two leaders and spokesmen of
the two great English-speaking peoples met to discuss frankly and on a
personal basis problems concerning the relative sea power of their
respective countries.
Out of the mutual understanding between the men, and consequently
of the nations, it is hoped that the existing friendly relations between
Great Britain and the United States will be strengthened.- As a result
of the talks, a second conference was arranged to which afl the world
powers will be invited to discuss world peace.
What the outgrowth of all these meetings will be, one can only venture
to guess. But one thing is evident. Any agreement reached will be one
based on understanding and sympathy between nations.
Hoover's diplomatic strategem lies in his choice of locale for his talks
with Mac Donald. Away from the formal atmosphere of the Capital and
in the midst of the wonders of nature, these men were able to bare their
ambitions, hopes, and ideals to each other in a manner completely foreign
to the old diplomacy.
