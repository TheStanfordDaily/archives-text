Sociologists and psychologists tell us that the opinion of the public
is a flighty, intangible thing which is not to be trusted; and in that state

The same probably goes for pubic opinion as it is reflected on this
campus. But the fact remains that the tid-bits published in the columns

past made interesting reading, even if they were not masterpieces of
literary finesse and intellectual depth.
Although the office has not been deluged with communications to the
editor, so far this quarter, we believe that the University still harbors
intellectual outlaws and conscientious objectors who could make good
use of the Daily.
The Daily is a student publication, striving to serve the best interests
of the University, and therefore welcomes communications from those it
attempts to serve.
