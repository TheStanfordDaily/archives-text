# TUESDAY EVENINGS
## 
### 
Tonight at 7 :30 in the Assembly Hall there begins another quarter's
Tuesday evening lecture series, prepared by the Committee on Public
Exercises. Week in and week out —since some date in the dim past—men
and women have come to the Assembly Hall platform with messages to
the students of this University.
Week in and week out the audience has been composed of faculty
members, residents of Palo Alto, and a sprinkling of students forced to
attend by some unfeeling professor. And that combination must be some
thing of a disappointment to the lecturer who has come prepared to speak
to college people.
The sad part about the whole thing is not that the speakers are
disappointed, but that the Stanford students are missing things that
should not be missed. Some of the lectures are undeniably terrific bores,
but those are in the minority, and several have been given that possessed
enough educational and inspirational value to be worth at least five hours
in an academic circle.
The average Stanford man is not crammed so full of knowledge that
he can afford to pass up the intellectual fare offered here every week in
the form of these lectures.
