"War," by Ludwig Renn. New York.
Dodd, Mead and Company. 1929.
People are still asking, "Have you
read 'All's Quiet on the Western
Front'?" —which was perhaps the most
talked-about book of the year. "War,"
by Ludwig Renn, is very much the
same sort of book, only taken from a
different angle, so that whoever read
the one should not accept it without
question until he has read the other.
"War" is in many ways an answer to
the first. "All's Quiet" was an indict
ment against German officers and
German discipline, and it was inevi
table that its stories of German brutal
ity and indifference should find sym
pathetic readers in the United States.
The straightforward style of the book
had a very convincing quality.
But now there is a book out, writ
ten by a German corporal, to remind
readers that there is also the officer's
point of view. It is significant that
the two books never contradict each
other, yet quite a different tone runs
through each. Ludwig Renn has writ
ten a plain, unvarnished account of a
soldier's life during the war, using a
simple style, and paying tremendous
attention to details. His book seems
more concrete than Remarque's—
more a very careful record of the
tiniest happening or movement that
he observed in the war. When he puts
down each day's events, he simply re
lates them, and does not color them
in the slightest; while Eric Remarque
on the other hand lets a great deal

of his emotion creep into the hook—
his own intense feeling about every
thing, hia hatred for German authori
ties, and his bitterness about the war.
Much of the power in "All's Quiet"
is owing to the fact that the spirit of
the young German soldier who wrote
it stood out so plainly on each page.
But the soldier who wrote "War" had
a quarrel only with the fate that de
creed he and his comrades should
fight. His attitude toward his authori
ties is entirely that of respect, and
although he undergoes shell-shock,
two severe wounds, and is in the
midst of the most frightful trench
warfare, he has no word of criticism
concerning German treatment of Ger
mans.
"War" is divided into seven sec
tions, according to different time
periods of the war, and includes a
chapter on the Trench War in 1917
and 1918, the march Offensive in 1918,
with its concluding chapter devoted
to German Collapse, and the breaking
up of the German morale.
It is not as gripping a book as its
much-acclaimed predecessor, it is
much longer, and it has pages of tedi
ous reading. Yet picture after picture
is given of the horror and the tragedy
of the war, with no detail omitted or
slurred over. It appears incredible that
a country whose citizens have these
stark pictures implanted in their
minds could let itself engage in an
other war. Such books are eminently
worthwhile for that reason.

he observed in the war. When he puts
down each day's events, he simply re
lates them, and does not color them
in the slightest; while Eric Remarque
on the other hand lets a great deal

of his emotion creep into the hook—
his own intense feeling about every
thing, hia hatred for German authori
ties, and his bitterness about the war.
Much of the power in "All's Quiet"
is owing to the fact that the spirit of
the young German soldier who wrote
it stood out so plainly on each page.
But the soldier who wrote "War" had
a quarrel only with the fate that de
creed he and his comrades should
fight. His attitude toward his authori
ties is entirely that of respect, and
although he undergoes shell-shock,
two severe wounds, and is in the
midst of the most frightful trench
warfare, he has no word of criticism
concerning German treatment of Ger
mans.
"War" is divided into seven sec
tions, according to different time
periods of the war, and includes a
chapter on the Trench War in 1917
and 1918, the march Offensive in 1918,
with its concluding chapter devoted
to German Collapse, and the breaking
up of the German morale.
It is not as gripping a book as its
much-acclaimed predecessor, it is
much longer, and it has pages of tedi
ous reading. Yet picture after picture
is given of the horror and the tragedy
of the war, with no detail omitted or
slurred over. It appears incredible that
a country whose citizens have these
stark pictures implanted in their
minds could let itself engage in an
other war. Such books are eminently
worthwhile for that reason.

"War," by Ludwig Renn. New York.
Dodd, Mead and Company. 1929.
People are still asking, "Have you
read 'All's Quiet on the Western
Front'?" —which was perhaps the most
talked-about book of the year. "War,"
by Ludwig Renn, is very much the
same sort of book, only taken from a
different angle, so that whoever read
the one should not accept it without
question until he has read the other.
"War" is in many ways an answer to
the first. "All's Quiet" was an indict
ment against German officers and
German discipline, and it was inevi
table that its stories of German brutal
ity and indifference should find sym
pathetic readers in the United States.
The straightforward style of the book
had a very convincing quality.
But now there is a book out, writ
ten by a German corporal, to remind
readers that there is also the officer's
point of view. It is significant that
the two books never contradict each
other, yet quite a different tone runs
through each. Ludwig Renn has writ
ten a plain, unvarnished account of a
soldier's life during the war, using a
simple style, and paying tremendous
attention to details. His book seems
more concrete than Remarque's—
more a very careful record of the
tiniest happening or movement that
he observed in the war. When he puts
down each day's events, he simply re
lates them, and does not color them
in the slightest; while Eric Remarque
on the other hand lets a great deal
