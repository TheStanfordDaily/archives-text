## SO MANY YARDS YET SO FEW SCORES 
### 
At last Saturday's football matinee,
the big white jerseyed boys from Stan
ford had a great time marching up
and down the gridiron. But although
they marched and marched, they
didn't seem to get anywhere—at least
until a good part of the afternoon had
been wasted away in useless drill.
The Cardinal varsity made so much
more yardage and so many more first
downs than Oregon that it almost ap
peared as though the Northern lads
had their hands tied. Statistics show
that Stanford made a total of 553
yards to Oregon's 123, and that Pop's
team rolled up 29 first downs to the
Webfooters' 3. Yet the final score was
only 33 to 7, and at half time Stanford
was leading by a bare six-point mar
gin.
Now just what was the matter?
Far from being a new situa
tion, this trick of wasting energy
carrying the ball all over the turf
at will, except over the goal line,
is one of the Cards' long-estab
lished and favorite habits.
Take last year's game with U.S.C.
for instance. Sweet memories show
that Stanford outplayed, outfought,
outgained, and outheld the Southern
squad during the greater part of the
contest, and then turned around
and handed the game over to the Tro
jans without a murmur.
At that time it was purely mishan
dling of the pigskin that caused the
scoreboard to read 10 to 0 in favor
of U.S.C., when the sun sank behind
the Coliseum (or was it raining in
Southern California that day?).
But Saturday presented an entirely
different set-up. A close analysis
points out that SO MANY YARDS
YET SO FEW SCORES resulted from
a combination of causes. Following is
a list of a few outstanding reasons:
(1) PENALTIES. Stanford was
penalized exactly 100 yards, or ap
proximately the length of the field
too much. Five set-backs (or sev
enty-five yards) resutled from
eagle-eyed officials' ideas about
holding. There is no excuse for
even one penalty for holding, let
alone five. (Certain other well
known Campus places exist for all
good Stanford men to demonstrate
their ability in that gentle art.)
One can just imagine to what such
jiujitsu tactics in the U.S.C.-Cal.
or Army games would lead.
(2) PLAYS. Although the signal
calling was quite good last Satur
day, one or two plays were of
doubtful value. One of these was
an attempted place kick in the
first quarter. Stanford seems to
have a hard time converting after
touchdowns, let alone trying to
place the ball between the posts
from the thirty-yard line.
(3) FUMBLES. All of the backs
handled the ball pretty well
throughout the game. There were
a couple of fumbles, however, and
it was one of these fumbles that
directly paved the way for Ore
gon's score.
(4) INTERCEPTED PASSES.
For a time the struggle almost
turned into a game of ping-pong,
both Stanford and Oregon catch
ing each other's passes with great
rapidity. At one stage of the sec

ond half, three passes were in
tercepted on three consecutive
plays. There was a lot of good
passing Saturday, but there was
also plenty of poor pigskin tos
sing.
And so on.
It is all well and good for Pop's
football team to carry out its policy
of keeping possession of the ball as
much as possible. The policy is funda
mentally sound. A team can't score
unless it has hold of the ball. It is
o.k. to let the other teams kick and
wait for the breaks.
But it is a different story and a
waste of time and energy for the
Cardinal varsity to wear itself out
packing the ball from its own
20-yard line to its opponents' 20-
yard line, time after time, and
then deliberately hand over the
pigskin to the other boys through
some more or less assinine mis
cue.

a couple of fumbles, however, and
it was one of these fumbles that
directly paved the way for Ore

(4) INTERCEPTED PASSES.
For a time the struggle almost
turned into a game of ping-pong,
both Stanford and Oregon catch
ing each other's passes with great
rapidity. At one stage of the sec

ond half, three passes were in
tercepted on three consecutive
plays. There was a lot of good
passing Saturday, but there was
also plenty of poor pigskin tos
sing.
And so on.
It is all well and good for Pop's
football team to carry out its policy
of keeping possession of the ball as
much as possible. The policy is funda
mentally sound. A team can't score
unless it has hold of the ball. It is
o.k. to let the other teams kick and
wait for the breaks.
But it is a different story and a
waste of time and energy for the
Cardinal varsity to wear itself out
packing the ball from its own
20-yard line to its opponents' 20-
yard line, time after time, and
then deliberately hand over the
pigskin to the other boys through
some more or less assinine mis
cue.

At last Saturday's football matinee,
the big white jerseyed boys from Stan
ford had a great time marching up
and down the gridiron. But although
they marched and marched, they
didn't seem to get anywhere—at least
until a good part of the afternoon had
been wasted away in useless drill.
The Cardinal varsity made so much
more yardage and so many more first
downs than Oregon that it almost ap
peared as though the Northern lads
had their hands tied. Statistics show
that Stanford made a total of 553
yards to Oregon's 123, and that Pop's
team rolled up 29 first downs to the
Webfooters' 3. Yet the final score was
only 33 to 7, and at half time Stanford
was leading by a bare six-point mar
gin.
Now just what was the matter?
Far from being a new situa
tion, this trick of wasting energy
carrying the ball all over the turf
at will, except over the goal line,
is one of the Cards' long-estab
lished and favorite habits.
Take last year's game with U.S.C.
for instance. Sweet memories show
that Stanford outplayed, outfought,
outgained, and outheld the Southern
squad during the greater part of the
contest, and then turned around
and handed the game over to the Tro
jans without a murmur.
At that time it was purely mishan
dling of the pigskin that caused the
scoreboard to read 10 to 0 in favor
of U.S.C., when the sun sank behind
the Coliseum (or was it raining in
Southern California that day?).
But Saturday presented an entirely
different set-up. A close analysis
points out that SO MANY YARDS
YET SO FEW SCORES resulted from
a combination of causes. Following is
a list of a few outstanding reasons:
(1) PENALTIES. Stanford was
penalized exactly 100 yards, or ap
proximately the length of the field
too much. Five set-backs (or sev
enty-five yards) resutled from
eagle-eyed officials' ideas about
holding. There is no excuse for
even one penalty for holding, let
alone five. (Certain other well
known Campus places exist for all
good Stanford men to demonstrate
their ability in that gentle art.)
One can just imagine to what such
jiujitsu tactics in the U.S.C.-Cal.
or Army games would lead.
(2) PLAYS. Although the signal
calling was quite good last Satur
day, one or two plays were of
doubtful value. One of these was
an attempted place kick in the
first quarter. Stanford seems to
have a hard time converting after
touchdowns, let alone trying to
place the ball between the posts
from the thirty-yard line.
(3) FUMBLES. All of the backs
handled the ball pretty well
throughout the game. There were
a couple of fumbles, however, and
it was one of these fumbles that
directly paved the way for Ore

the Coliseum (or was it raining in
Southern California that day?).
But Saturday presented an entirely
different set-up. A close analysis
points out that SO MANY YARDS
YET SO FEW SCORES resulted from
a combination of causes. Following is
a list of a few outstanding reasons:
(1) PENALTIES. Stanford was
penalized exactly 100 yards, or ap
proximately the length of the field
too much. Five set-backs (or sev
enty-five yards) resutled from
eagle-eyed officials' ideas about
holding. There is no excuse for
even one penalty for holding, let
alone five. (Certain other well
known Campus places exist for all
good Stanford men to demonstrate
their ability in that gentle art.)
One can just imagine to what such
jiujitsu tactics in the U.S.C.-Cal.
or Army games would lead.
(2) PLAYS. Although the signal
calling was quite good last Satur
day, one or two plays were of
doubtful value. One of these was
an attempted place kick in the
first quarter. Stanford seems to
have a hard time converting after
touchdowns, let alone trying to
place the ball between the posts
from the thirty-yard line.
(3) FUMBLES. All of the backs
handled the ball pretty well
throughout the game. There were
a couple of fumbles, however, and
it was one of these fumbles that
directly paved the way for Ore
gon's score.
(4) INTERCEPTED PASSES.
For a time the struggle almost
turned into a game of ping-pong,
both Stanford and Oregon catch
ing each other's passes with great
rapidity. At one stage of the sec

ond half, three passes were in
tercepted on three consecutive
plays. There was a lot of good
passing Saturday, but there was
also plenty of poor pigskin tos
sing.
And so on.
It is all well and good for Pop's
football team to carry out its policy
of keeping possession of the ball as
much as possible. The policy is funda
mentally sound. A team can't score
unless it has hold of the ball. It is
o.k. to let the other teams kick and
wait for the breaks.
But it is a different story and a
waste of time and energy for the
Cardinal varsity to wear itself out
packing the ball from its own
20-yard line to its opponents' 20-
yard line, time after time, and
then deliberately hand over the
pigskin to the other boys through
some more or less assinine mis
cue.

At last Saturday's football matinee,
the big white jerseyed boys from Stan
ford had a great time marching up
and down the gridiron. But although
they marched and marched, they
didn't seem to get anywhere—at least
until a good part of the afternoon had
been wasted away in useless drill.
The Cardinal varsity made so much
more yardage and so many more first
downs than Oregon that it almost ap
peared as though the Northern lads
had their hands tied. Statistics show
that Stanford made a total of 553
yards to Oregon's 123, and that Pop's
team rolled up 29 first downs to the
Webfooters' 3. Yet the final score was
only 33 to 7, and at half time Stanford
was leading by a bare six-point mar
gin.
Now just what was the matter?
Far from being a new situa
tion, this trick of wasting energy
carrying the ball all over the turf
at will, except over the goal line,
is one of the Cards' long-estab
lished and favorite habits.
Take last year's game with U.S.C.
for instance. Sweet memories show
that Stanford outplayed, outfought,
outgained, and outheld the Southern
squad during the greater part of the
contest, and then turned around
and handed the game over to the Tro
jans without a murmur.
At that time it was purely mishan
dling of the pigskin that caused the
scoreboard to read 10 to 0 in favor
of U.S.C., when the sun sank behind
the Coliseum (or was it raining in
Southern California that day?).
But Saturday presented an entirely
