PITTSBURGH, Pa., Oct. 3. (JP) —
Elmer Layden, Duquesne coach and
former member of the "Four Horse
men," has introduced football "sliorts"
to replace the ordinary pants when
speed is desired.
Here is a real use for the huddle.
We fear there will be many penal
ties for too long time out for those
who have trouble removing their trou
sers rapidly.
They might try zippers.
But that would offer a distinctly
diabolical idea to the opposition.
Imagine the embarrassment of the
player whose teammates came out of
the huddle too rapidly!
What a colorful thing football will
be if Mr. Layden uses some of the
modern motifs we have seen in the
store windows!
It will take a mighty quick shift to
make any costume change a surprise.
How Modern a Moment it will be
when the quarterback says, "Put on
your trousers, Mr. Flannigan, we are
going to try you on a line buck in
stead."
The More Modest colleges who do
not use the huddle will doubtless have
to use portable dressing rooms.
The possibilities are amazing.
GEM IN GRID SCHEDULE:
"California Goofs at Napa."
Oregon students who did not came
to Stanford for the game Saturday
danced between halves while watch
ing a Grid-O-Graph at Eugene.
Needless to say, it was not a jig.
