Now, Tommy Loughran should have
known better than to get up at "five."
That's much too early for a wealthy
ex-champion to be getting up. He
should have slept till 9, anyway. Fun
niest ending I ever saw to a fight.
I thought Tommy had decided to
quit at first. If Sharkey had rushed
upon him when he first got up, as he
was entitled to do, he'd have mur
dered him. It was a smart move on
Lou Magnolia's part to grasp, first
the situation, then Sharkey, as he did,
just in time. Tommy must have read
the sign "Walk, do not run, to the
nearest exit." If Dempsey had gone
to a neutral corner at Soldier Field
half as soon as Tommy did at the
Yankee Stadium, there'd have been no
"Long Count" controversy.
Now it looks like Sharkey vs.
Schmeling or Phil Scott at Miami in
February. You've gotta hand it to

Jack. He really looked the part of a
champion Thux-sday night. He was
the Sharkey who K.O.'d Maloney, and
who nearly put Dempsey away in one
round, and who flattened Delaney. If
he doesn't look out he'll get as good
as the old-time sailor, Tom Sharkey.
Picked up at the Yankee Stadium
during the fight . . . A 1 Singer trying
to crash the press box . . . Jimmy
Wilde in a brown suit . . , the blonde
in row 1 in the blue dress . . . the
Navy emblem on the back of Shar
key's bathrobe . . . the Mayor of San
Francisco and the Mayor of New York
watching a Bostonian knock out a
Philadelphian . . . the silent prayer
in memory of Miller Huggins . . .
winning a buck from Ray Slianahan
on the Hoffman-Heeney fight, which
Hoffman seemed to win by a mile, and
then having to give it back to him
with another one when they an
nounced that Heeney had won!
