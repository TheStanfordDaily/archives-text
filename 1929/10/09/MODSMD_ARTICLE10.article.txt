# 'BIRTHDAY NUMBER' OF CHAPARRAL WILL GO ON SALE TODAY
## 
### 
When campus charmers hold out for
sale their Chaparrals today, they will
display a cover that is considered by
the Old Boy himself to be one of the
best and most colorful ever presented.
The latest work of Ted Krough, last
year's art editor, depicts the Old Boy
in all his rubicund jollity, being pre
sented with his thirtieth birthday
cake. Behind him is an aeroplane,
waiting to take him back to the land
of jest.
Nelson Carter, editor, announces
several new feature articles appearing
in the Aviation number today. "The
Great American Feed Bag," a parody
on Carl Sandburg's "Great American
Song Bag," has been prepared by
James Webb and ye editor. It con
sists of "songs, lace-doilies, and
whiffle-trees." Ray Carlson has traced
the eventful trip of a young woman
who has dropped via p "'chute from
an aeroplane. Burnell Gou. i has writ
ten a full-page article giving his im
pressions of a fraternity telephone
pad. And to climax it all, the Old Boy
is introducing a brand new column
called "Sketches," which will deal
with Stanford professors from month
to month. Since the subject of the
first column is kept secret, the Old
Boy says a copy of Chaparral will
have to be bought to find out which
prof is picked on this time.
