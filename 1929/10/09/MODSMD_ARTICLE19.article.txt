# HOOVER, PREMIER FRANKLY DISCUSS AMITY PROBLEM
## Honor MacDonald at Embassy Reception; Executives Chat in Country 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8.
dent Hoover and Prime Minister Mac-
Donald today came to the end of their
frank discussions of questions which
might form the focal point of friction
between the American and British
peoples.
Perhaps few conversations in his
tory have aroused a more universal
interest and curiosity than those
which have taken place in the last
three days in the wilderness of the
nearby Virginia mountains and in the
quiet simplicity of the President's
White House study.
History has yet to record the re
sults of their experiment in interna
tional intercourse —that of personal
contacts between the heads of govern
ments —but each radiates a confidence
that a long forward step has been
taken in Anglo-American accord.
Prime Minister Mac Donald's official
program for Tuesday included the fol
lowing events:
The return of Mr. Mac Donald and
Miss Macdonald from the White
House to the British Embassy during
the morning. They were guests of the
Canadian minister and Mrs. Massey
at luncheon. The ambassador of Great
Britain entertained Mr. Mac Donald
and his party at dinner in the eve
ning. A reception followed.
President Hoover said today the
conversations with Prime Minister
Ramsay Mac Donald were being car
ried on in an atmosphere of absolute
frankness and that "neither of us has
anything in reserve."
