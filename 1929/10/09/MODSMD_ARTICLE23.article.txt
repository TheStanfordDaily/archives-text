# PICKLED WHALE TO START ON TOUR OF NATION ON FLATCAR
## 
### 
SAN PEDRO, Oct. 8. (/P)Many
of the persons who have doubted
that a whale could have gulped
down Jonah will probably scratch
their heads and make a few men
tal amendments when they see
the pickled 54-foot specimen
soon to start on a flatcar tour of
all important cities in the coun
try.
This whale is to have one out
standing advantage over the crea
ture supposed to have swallowed
Jonah —it is to have its own
transportation—on a glass-en
closed car all its own.
The traveling whale weighs 37
tons. It was caught by fishermen
off Catalina Island after a four
hour battle, pickled by the Pa
cific Whaling Company in 1758
gallons of embalming fluid for
two days, mounted on the spe
cially constructed fiatcar, and
polished for the trip.
