## Warner Leaves for Seattle to Scout Washington Game; Assistants to Guide Cards Knee Still Bothers Rothert; Team Given Intensive Drill As Pop Takes No Chances 
### Stephen Dietrich 
A lineup composed entirely of play
ers registered from Southern Califor
nia will face the U.C.L.A. Bruins at
the Los Angeles Coliseum on Satur
day, when Stanford's football machine
starts its second lap in the Coast Con
ference race.
This announcement was made yes
terday afternoon before practice by
Coach Pop Warner, who will not ac
company the team on its southern in
vasion. Warner plans to leave the
campus today for Seattle, where he
will scout the Washington-U.S.C. con
test, leaving "Tiny" Thornhill and
"Chuck" Winterburn to guide the des
tinies of the Cardinal squad..
Although no definite statement has
been issued, it is probable that the
whole squad of forty-nine, including
Johnny Preston, Bill Simkins, and
Chuck Erhorn, who are still hobbling
around on crutches, will entrain to
morrow night for the South.
Pop is taking no chances for an
upset this week-end, remembering the
Santa Clara disaster two years ago,
and is drilling the team hard in pre
paration for the Uclan game. Yester
day the players were put through
more than an hour's signal practice,
and another stiff workout is in order
for this afternoon.
A couple of changes were noted on
the first string during yesterday's
practice session. Kay Albertson was
running at end instead of Phil Neil,
while Mike Reynolds and Norm Mc-
Leod alternated at Driscoll's guard
position. Phil Winnek was at Harlow
Rotliert's half, as the latter is still
bothered with a bruised knee. Bull
Driscoll and Perry Taylor were not
out in suits but will be ready for prac
tice again this afternoon.
Following is a tentative starting
lineup for the Bruin game: Kay Al
bertson and Phil Neill, ends; Corwin
Artman and Ray Tandy, tackles; Pete
Heiser and Ray Hulen, guards; Walt
Heinecke, center; Harry Hillman,
quarter; Phil Moffatt and Phil Win
nek, halves; and Harlow Rothert, full
back.
