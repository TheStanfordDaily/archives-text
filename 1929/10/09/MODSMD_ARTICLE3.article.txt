Coaches Cuddeback and Robesky
are working their Stanford Gray squad
hard in preparation for the first game
©112 the season with the Santa Barbara
State Teachers College eleven Satur
day at 12:30 p.m. With some of the
best prospects on the squad out of
practice with injuries, the coaches are
having their troubles.
Santa Barbara held the Occidental
College Tigers to two touchdowns last
week, which shows that the Teachers
are a strong aggregation. Stanford's
line looks strong, but the backfield,
mainly because of injuries, is the
main cause of concern. The game will
be played in the Stadium as a pre
liminary to the Santa Clara-Stanford
freshman game.
