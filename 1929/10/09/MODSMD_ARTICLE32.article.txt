# WILL HIDE AND SEEK BE THE BIG GAME THIS YEAR?

At a meeting of the Interfraternity Council yesterday, Scott Webster,
chairman, made a sincere plea for strict observance of the rushing rules.
The pathetic condition is that the chairman may make all the passionate
pleas he cares to and yet illegal rushing may continue.
The Interfraternity Board of Control, not to be confused with the
Interfraernity Council, can initiate no measure to bring offenders to task..
It must be done by some fraternity man. A signed statement, naming the
violators, both fraternity men and rushees, and the time and place is
handed to Professor Owens, faculty member of the Board. He tears off
the signature and sends the indictment to the Board which tries the case.
So much for theory.
But now comes the joker. Violators are not turned in. This is due
in many cases to a pseudo-conception of honor. Too few are afraid of
being classified as "tattle-tales." They refuse to perform a duty which
they pledged to do. The fraternities have given their word not to engage
in illegal rushing. As was pointed out at the meeting, business firms in
the same fields of competition often enter into agreements. Unlike campus
fraternities, these business houses respect their word enough to live up
to their contracts. If commercial firms can abide by their agreements, is
it demanding too much to ask fraternities to do the same?
Stanford fraternities were made the laughing-stock of the Pacific
Coast by last spring's fiasco. This year presents a crucial challenge to
them. If fraternities are to maintain self-respect, they will do well to abide
by the rushing rules. There is more at stake than the reputation of twenty
four campus living groups. It is the fair name of the University itself.
Any agency or agencies degrading the name of Stanford are evils
which sooner or later must go.
