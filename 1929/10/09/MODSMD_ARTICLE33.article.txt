# THE
						FIRST TRADITION

### 
This discussion of traditions is getting old, but one more requires
immediate mention because a few violations have been observed. The
A.S.S.U. Handbook states, "The first Stanford tradition is thought to
be one which says that there shall be no smoking on the Quad."
Freshmen are told about this rule, but transfers are often without
proper guidance concerning Stanford. The prohibition is based on an
aesthetic rather than a moral purpose. It was Mrs. Stanford's wish that
cigarette butts not be thrown about the Quad. Out of that grew up the
tradition of no smoking on the inner or outer Quadrangle. Students who
take pride in their famous institution do not consider it a hardship to
walk outside the building group before they light a fag.
