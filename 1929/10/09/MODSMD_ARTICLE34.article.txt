Freshmen may read the following and be thankful that they are
attending Stanford rather than some other institution of "higher yearn
ing." Not all colleges treat their first-year men with the dignity and
respect accorded Stanford frosh.
The daily publication of the University of North Dakota carries
numerous stories and bits of editorial comment on freshman hazing,
revived for the first time in three years. During the four-week hazing
period, freshmen must wear green caps, and at the cry of "button" place
both Hands on the top of the head-piece. At the request of any upperclass
men, they must sing a traditional hazing song "to the tune of 'Jmgl e
Bells'."
Neckties arc declared taboo, but the shirt collar must remain buttoned..
Coats are to be worn inside out, and the left trouser leg rolled half way
to the knee. The greatest sin is for a freshman to be seen walking with
a co-ed. Ever-vigilant sophomores armed with paddles will enforce the
regulations with corporeal punishment. This in a modern university!
The fact that the practice has been throttled for three years and then
resumed seems to be a stire sign of retrogression. No one can read of the
backward practices of some colleges without offering a silent prayer of
thanks that he attends an institution that does not mimic comic magazines
or "movie" comedies.
