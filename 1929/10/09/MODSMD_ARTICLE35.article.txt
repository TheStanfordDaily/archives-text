Now seems to be the time for all good men on the Stanford campus
to turn out for extra-curricular activities. Teams are being formed and
managers are uttering plaintive calls for tryoutees.
Outside activities have been the subject of many heated debates.
Proponents of non-academic interests argue that more value is gleaned
from such work than from the "book learning" absorbed in university
classrooms. Opponents point out that after all the purpose of the uni
versity is to produce scholars and not football managers.
It is perfectly obvious that a great deal of truth exists in the conten
tions of each faction. But as usual the extremists are at most only half
right. No college career can be complete with scholarship alone, but the
man who entirely neglects the classroom for an activity will live to
regret his one-sidedness.
Now, as every fall, the same old question arises. Shall the new man
embark on an activity career or shall he confine his interest and energy to
his books?
The answer to that question has already been presented. The man
who can successfully straddle the fence—strike a sensible medium—will
be the happiest. The contacts made, the friendships formed, and the
experience gained from activities should not be missed; and by the same
token scholarship is too necessary to be neglected.
