"Pleasure Crazed," at the Varsity
Theatre.
Go to this talkie some time when
you don't need much to make you
laugh. "Pleasure Crazed" is one of
those shows where the audience
snickers at the most tender and dra
matic moments and sits uncomfort
ably silent at the humorous remarks.
But they are amused.
Don't be deceived by the name of
the picture—it has very little connec
tion with the story. The plot centers
around three conspirators, one of
whom is Margarite Churchill as the

attractive young housekeeper, seeking
to steal a box-full of gem 3. Interwoven
In this plot is the struggle of the
wife, played by Dorothy Burgess, en
deavoring to make love to a poor but
handsome polo player and at the same
time keep her husband placated. It
all works out happily in the end, as
was to be expected.
Miss Churchill does a creditable bit
of acting, but there are times when
it is difficult to decide just what emo
tion Dorothy Burgess is trying to por
tray. Kenneth McKenna, taking the
part of the husband, grits his teeth
almost audibly and so makes a hit.
