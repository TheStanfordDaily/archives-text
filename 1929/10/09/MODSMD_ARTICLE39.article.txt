# WELL-KNOWN BOSTON PHOTOGRAPHER TO DO 1930 QUAD PICTURES
## 
### 
T. Henry Merritt has come from
Boston to do the photography for this
year's Quad, says Stanley Milne, edi
tor of the 1930 Quad, who considers
Stanford very fortunate to have pro
cured Mr. Merritt's services. Mr.
Merritt has photographed the past
Presidents Taft and Coolidge, Pope
Pius XI, Cardinal O'Connell of Boston,
Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia,
and Von Utelli of Rome, who is the
oldest living Cardinal. In 1925, he was
appointed by Boston newspapers to
represent them at the Vatican.
Seniors are asked to make appoint
ments for their Quad pictures at the
Women's Clubhouse immediately. The
photographer will begin his work on
Thursday. Before he can have his
picture taken, each senior must have
bought his Quad or made a three
dollar deposit.
