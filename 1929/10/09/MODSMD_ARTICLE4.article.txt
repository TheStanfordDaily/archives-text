# SAN FRANCISCO KID TRADES PRAISE FOR HEINIE'S AUTOGRAPH
## 
### 
Walt Heinecke, let it be said,
is a non-committal youth, but lie
couldn't help being pleased about
the letter which he received yes
terday from Frank Forster, a
San Francisco kid, who plays
sandlot football on Valencia
street and wants to come to
Stanford and be a center like
Heinie.
Young Forster's letter was ad
dressed to "Mr." Heinecke, seek
ing an autograph. Then, in order,
perhaps, to make sure of getting
it, he went on to tell Walt that
"my father says centers like you
read the sports news carefully,
are none too plentiful, and as I
I knew that 'Pop' Warner sure
got a prize when he got you."
At a late hour last night, it
looked as if Forster would get
Mr. Heinecke's autograph.
