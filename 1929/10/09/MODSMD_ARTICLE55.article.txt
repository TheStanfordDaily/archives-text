# SPORTS OF 1929
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
French of the A's vs. English of
the Cubs! Who will win? Who will
shine the brightest in the World
Series of 1929? Ehvood English is the
regular shortstop of the Chicago Na
tional League entry, while Walter
French is a pinch-hitter and substitute
outfielder on the Philadelphia Ameri
can League club. English has been
playing regularly all season and bat
ting around .280, while French has
seldom appeared in the A's lineup.
But Fate sometimes decrees that some
unknown substitute, like Rohe of the
White Sox in 1906, shall become the
outstanding star of the "post-season
classic," so stranger things have hap
pened than that Walter French should
become the big noise of the 1929
series.
French is not entirely unknown,
however. Not by a long shot. He was
a famous football star at West Point,
and before that at Rutgers. Anyone
who was lucky enough to see that
classic football game at West Point
about nine years ago, in which Notre
Dame beat the Army, will never for
get the great playing of George Gipp
of the Hoosiers on the one side and
Walter French on the other. French
has an average of .304 for five years'
play with the A's (not counting this
season).
Ehvood English is just twenty-two
years old and only weighs 155 pounds,

but he is one of the best fielding
shortstops in the majors, and has
come along splendidly in the art of
making double plays under the tute
lage of Rogers Hornsby, his side-kick
i and roommate.
The English beat the French in the
battles of Crecy and Agincourt in
1 1415, and beat them because of the
; superiority of their Archers. The Cubs
once had a great catcher named
! Jimmy Archer who ranked with the
best at pegging down to second. But
English has no Archer now to aid him.
| Can he beat the Athletic French-man?
