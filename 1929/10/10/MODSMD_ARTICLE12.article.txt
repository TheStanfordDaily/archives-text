# LEAGUE OF NATIONS ACCOMPLISHING VALUABLE WORK, STANFORD MEN FIND
## 
### Reid Briggs 
On a boat sailing from New York
last June 28 were two Stanford men,
on their way to join a group of other
young men from universities and col
leges throughout the world in an ex
periment which had never been tried
before.
Those two men were Robert M. and
John C. McClintock; they were going
to Geneva to observe the League of
Nations in operation, under the auspi
ces of the Foundation for the Ad
vancement of the Social Sciences of
the University of Denver. Nine other
American universities sent pairs of
junior students to Geneva, as did
twelve European institutions and sev
eral in other parts of the globe.
The McClintocks come back to
Stanford this quarter with a story of
a great experience. After three weeks
of touring Southern Spain, they went
to Geneva, where the League of Na
tions opened session the first week of
September. The spirit of comradely
fellowship in the pension where they
stayed with ten other students was
intensified by the head of the pen
sion, who was an exiled Polish prin
cess.
Mornings were spent in attending
lectures on every conceivable topic
under international relations, at the
Zimmorn school, maintained by the

League. In the afternoons the visiting
college men went to seminars under
the guidance of Salvador de Madiorga,
a noted Spanish scholar and interna
tionalist who is known to many
j Americans through his writings in the
I Forum. Senor de Madiorga is an Ox
| ford professor and head of the dis
armament section of the League.
On the days when meetings of the
League were scheduled, the students
listened in on the discussions of a
group of men of international import
ance among whom seats were occu
pied by twenty-three foreign secre
taries and eight prime ministers. The
thrilling first few days which the
Stanford representatives spent in the
; Swiss capital included hearing Eng
' land's Prime Minister, Ramsay Mac-
Donald, give his now-famous speech
on naval accord and Briand's flery
speech proposing united states of Eu
rope.
"The ideas of many people that the
League is merely an expensive debat-
Stanford observers. "The men who are
j in Geneva representing most of the
are in Geneva represting most of the
: nations of the world go there with a
sincere and whole-hearted aim of co
operation; they openly and sanely
discuss matters of international rela
tions which not many years ago could
only be mentioned in the processes of
secret diplomacy." At Geneva, all
meetings are open to the public; the
student visitors were given access
even to the Council of the League,
the innermost core of the League's
official organization.
"The delegates at the League's ses
sions come with sincere frankness for
discussion of mutual problems, yet
they are candidly patriots of their
countries," said Bob McClintock.
His brother John added: "Even the
students from the various nations
manifested intense patriotism. All
seek national betterment, with the
sensible realization that a way to that
betterment through intelligent and
friendly co-operation of the states of
the world."
This spirit has made possible the
many activities of the League of Na
tions in maintaining peace, control
ling the trafficking in opium, in wo
men and children, and in bettering
the world's health through interna
tional supervision.
Fascinating as were these contacts

with the eminent men of several
score countries, the university men
were accorded every opportunity to
have a good time socially while they
were in Switzerland. They were in
vited to many social functions in
Geneva, and on short trips to various
1 parts of the country.
Last summer was the first of a
series of these annual expeditions.
| Each year, it is planned, various uni-
I versities, of whom Stanford is one,

young men from universities and col
leges throughout the world in an ex
periment which had never been tried
before.
Those two men were Robert M. and
John C. McClintock; they were going
to Geneva to observe the League of
Nations in operation, under the auspi
ces of the Foundation for the Ad
vancement of the Social Sciences of
the University of Denver. Nine other
American universities sent pairs of
junior students to Geneva, as did
twelve European institutions and sev
eral in other parts of the globe.
The McClintocks come back to
Stanford this quarter with a story of
a great experience. After three weeks
of touring Southern Spain, they went
to Geneva, where the League of Na
tions opened session the first week of
September. The spirit of comradely
fellowship in the pension where they
stayed with ten other students was
intensified by the head of the pen
sion, who was an exiled Polish prin
cess.
Mornings were spent in attending
lectures on every conceivable topic
under international relations, at the
Zimmorn school, maintained by the

League. In the afternoons the visiting
college men went to seminars under
the guidance of Salvador de Madiorga,
a noted Spanish scholar and interna
tionalist who is known to many
j Americans through his writings in the
I Forum. Senor de Madiorga is an Ox
| ford professor and head of the dis
armament section of the League.
On the days when meetings of the
League were scheduled, the students
listened in on the discussions of a
group of men of international import
ance among whom seats were occu
pied by twenty-three foreign secre
taries and eight prime ministers. The
thrilling first few days which the
Stanford representatives spent in the
; Swiss capital included hearing Eng
' land's Prime Minister, Ramsay Mac-
Donald, give his now-famous speech
on naval accord and Briand's flery
speech proposing united states of Eu
rope.
"The ideas of many people that the
League is merely an expensive debat-

: nations of the world go there with a
sincere and whole-hearted aim of co
operation; they openly and sanely
discuss matters of international rela
tions which not many years ago could
only be mentioned in the processes of
secret diplomacy." At Geneva, all
meetings are open to the public; the
student visitors were given access
even to the Council of the League,
the innermost core of the League's
official organization.
"The delegates at the League's ses
sions come with sincere frankness for
discussion of mutual problems, yet
they are candidly patriots of their
countries," said Bob McClintock.
His brother John added: "Even the
students from the various nations
manifested intense patriotism. All
seek national betterment, with the
sensible realization that a way to that
betterment through intelligent and
friendly co-operation of the states of
the world."
This spirit has made possible the
many activities of the League of Na
tions in maintaining peace, control
ling the trafficking in opium, in wo
men and children, and in bettering
the world's health through interna
tional supervision.
Fascinating as were these contacts

with the eminent men of several
score countries, the university men
were accorded every opportunity to
have a good time socially while they
were in Switzerland. They were in
vited to many social functions in
Geneva, and on short trips to various
1 parts of the country.
Last summer was the first of a
series of these annual expeditions.

Those two men were Robert M. and
John C. McClintock; they were going
to Geneva to observe the League of
Nations in operation, under the auspi
ces of the Foundation for the Ad
vancement of the Social Sciences of
the University of Denver. Nine other
American universities sent pairs of
junior students to Geneva, as did
twelve European institutions and sev
eral in other parts of the globe.
The McClintocks come back to
Stanford this quarter with a story of
a great experience. After three weeks
of touring Southern Spain, they went
to Geneva, where the League of Na
tions opened session the first week of
September. The spirit of comradely
fellowship in the pension where they
stayed with ten other students was
intensified by the head of the pen
sion, who was an exiled Polish prin
cess.
Mornings were spent in attending
lectures on every conceivable topic
under international relations, at the
Zimmorn school, maintained by the

League. In the afternoons the visiting
college men went to seminars under
the guidance of Salvador de Madiorga,
a noted Spanish scholar and interna
tionalist who is known to many
j Americans through his writings in the
I Forum. Senor de Madiorga is an Ox
| ford professor and head of the dis
armament section of the League.
On the days when meetings of the
League were scheduled, the students
listened in on the discussions of a
group of men of international import
ance among whom seats were occu
pied by twenty-three foreign secre
taries and eight prime ministers. The
thrilling first few days which the
Stanford representatives spent in the
; Swiss capital included hearing Eng
' land's Prime Minister, Ramsay Mac-
Donald, give his now-famous speech
on naval accord and Briand's flery
speech proposing united states of Eu
rope.
"The ideas of many people that the
League is merely an expensive debat-
Stanford observers. "The men who are
j in Geneva representing most of the
are in Geneva represting most of the
: nations of the world go there with a
sincere and whole-hearted aim of co
operation; they openly and sanely
discuss matters of international rela
tions which not many years ago could
only be mentioned in the processes of
secret diplomacy." At Geneva, all
meetings are open to the public; the
student visitors were given access
even to the Council of the League,
the innermost core of the League's
official organization.
"The delegates at the League's ses
sions come with sincere frankness for
discussion of mutual problems, yet
they are candidly patriots of their
countries," said Bob McClintock.
His brother John added: "Even the
students from the various nations
manifested intense patriotism. All
seek national betterment, with the
sensible realization that a way to that
betterment through intelligent and
friendly co-operation of the states of
the world."
This spirit has made possible the
many activities of the League of Na
tions in maintaining peace, control
ling the trafficking in opium, in wo
men and children, and in bettering
the world's health through interna
tional supervision.
Fascinating as were these contacts

with the eminent men of several
score countries, the university men
were accorded every opportunity to
have a good time socially while they
were in Switzerland. They were in
vited to many social functions in
Geneva, and on short trips to various
1 parts of the country.
Last summer was the first of a
series of these annual expeditions.
| Each year, it is planned, various uni-
I versities, of whom Stanford is one,
' will send two juniors to Geneva. They
1 will return to tell of their experiences
. during their senior years. The great
! success of the experimental first trip
| assures the continuance of the pro
| ject.
