# A.E. ROTH TO ADDRESS NEW MEN TONIGHT
## Stanford Ideals, Traditions To Be Comptroller's Topic at Y.M.C.A. Gathering 
### 
"Stanford Ideals and Traditions"
will be the subject of Comptroller A.
E. Roth's talk at the Y.M.C.A. recep
tion to be held in the Old Union lobby
tonight at 7:30, The reception will be
held in honor of the new men stu
dents of the University.
"The purpose of the meeting," said
Ben Culver, secretary of the local
"Y," "is to aid the new students in
orienting themselves. We are espe
cially interested in the problems of
the junior college transfers who, al
though they usually know why they
are in college, are at considerable dis
advantage in some respects. Most of
them must live off the campus and
miss much of college life. Because of
eligibility rules of various kinds, trans
fer students find many campus activi
ties practically closed to them. These
conditions result in losses, both to the
students and to the University. The
Y.M.C.A. is attempting to aid the stu
dents to adjust themselves to the new
conditions."
According to Roth, many of the
Stanford traditions are passing, some
are foolish, while some are worthwhile.
He will tell the men his opinions of
them, and explain their origins.
Stanford Steinbeck, president of
the A.S.S.U., and Scott Webster,
president of the Interfraternity Coun
cil, will give short talks representing
the viewpoints of their organizations.
Following the speeches, musical
numbers will be furnished by Del
Culling and Howard Gabbert, and re
freshments will be served.
