## Both Parties Contend Move Aimed to Avoid Tariff Legislation Mix-Up 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 9. (/P)— By a
vote of l'orty-five to thirty-six, the Sen
ate today rejected an amendment to
the tariff bill which -would have
granted independence to the Philip
pines after a constitutional conven
tion in the Islands had set up self
government.
Members of both parties contended
the vote was not a test on the inde
pendence question, but was aimed to
prevent it becoming tangled in tariff
consideration at a time when all were
agreed that the latter should be dis
posed of promptly.
Issue Appears Suddenly
The independence issue was inject
ed into the tariff debate with unex
pected suddenness. It appeared for a
time that the pending revision bill
would be sidetracked indefinitely be
cause of the apparent earnestness of
senators to discuss freedom of the
Islands which the United States pur
chased after the Spanish-American
war.
It was only after many hours of
debate over another amendment
touching on the Philippine question,
which resulted in a refusal by the
Senate to table it, that it was agreed
to take a vote on the independence
amendment.
