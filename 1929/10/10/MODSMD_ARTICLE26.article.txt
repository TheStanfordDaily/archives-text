# TEMPLETON IS RANKED AS WORLD'S PREMIER TRACK COACH BY PADDOCK
## 
### 
"Templeton is without a doubt the
world's best track coach." Charles
Paddock, erstwhile "fastest human"
and holder of many sprint records,
was expressing some opinions in an
interview Tuesday night. "Dink has
been so successful as a coach for two
major reasons," Paddock said. "One
is that he is young and can see the
views of the men he coaches. The
other big reason is that he has made
a scientific study of all the events in
track and field and is able to impart
to his pupils, as no other coach can,
his knowledge of those events."
"I intended," said Paddock, "to
watch the football practice, but when
I saw the fellows running around on
the track, I had to get on a suit and
go out too. I ran a relay and a couple
of dashes and had a lot of fun. Of
course I got beaten, i was especially
interested in Dyer. I believe that he
has as good chances as anyone I know
to become a record-breaker, and I be
lieve that the fight for the 1.C.4-A.
sprint championship next year will he
between Dyer of Stanford and
Wyckoff of U.S.C. Contrary to Dink's
opinion, I believe that Dyer is at his
best in the 100-yard dash, and that
Wyckoff is best in the 220. Dyer and
Wyckoff are the best bets of the
United States in the next Olympic
Games. It will be their big chance,

for the United States has not won the
100-meter championship since 1920."
According to Paddock, the U.S.C.
football team looked none too good in
its victory over the Oregon Staters
last Saturday, and he believes the
Stanford team, from all the reports
i he has heard, is much farther along
j than are the Trojans. "But it's a long
l time until October 26," he added with
S a smile.
"I expect to see a radical change in
the methods of control of amateur
athletics in the next few years," said
Paddock. The control is built on the
wrong principles. In my opinion, there
is no such thing as a strictly amateur
athletic champion. All of us who have
held the titles of champions know
that. Either we exploit the title by
writing for the papers, or our schools
or other organizations use our names
to attract others. Most of (he so-called
amateur champions are able to make
their livings at nothing other than
I their sports. I expect to see the day
i when there will be less competition
between schools, and more athletic
competition within schools."
Paddock was visiting Templeton, of
J whom he has been a close friend for
! more than ten years. Their friendship
i began in their days of college compe
j tition. He will go to San Francisco on
| business for a few days.

was expressing some opinions in an
interview Tuesday night. "Dink has
been so successful as a coach for two
major reasons," Paddock said. "One
is that he is young and can see the
views of the men he coaches. The
other big reason is that he has made
a scientific study of all the events in
track and field and is able to impart
to his pupils, as no other coach can,
his knowledge of those events."
"I intended," said Paddock, "to
watch the football practice, but when
I saw the fellows running around on
the track, I had to get on a suit and
go out too. I ran a relay and a couple
of dashes and had a lot of fun. Of
course I got beaten, i was especially
interested in Dyer. I believe that he
has as good chances as anyone I know
to become a record-breaker, and I be
lieve that the fight for the 1.C.4-A.
sprint championship next year will he
between Dyer of Stanford and
Wyckoff of U.S.C. Contrary to Dink's
opinion, I believe that Dyer is at his
best in the 100-yard dash, and that
Wyckoff is best in the 220. Dyer and
Wyckoff are the best bets of the
United States in the next Olympic
Games. It will be their big chance,

for the United States has not won the
100-meter championship since 1920."
According to Paddock, the U.S.C.
football team looked none too good in
its victory over the Oregon Staters
last Saturday, and he believes the
Stanford team, from all the reports
i he has heard, is much farther along
j than are the Trojans. "But it's a long
l time until October 26," he added with
S a smile.
"I expect to see a radical change in
the methods of control of amateur
athletics in the next few years," said
Paddock. The control is built on the
wrong principles. In my opinion, there
is no such thing as a strictly amateur
athletic champion. All of us who have
held the titles of champions know
that. Either we exploit the title by
writing for the papers, or our schools
or other organizations use our names
to attract others. Most of (he so-called
amateur champions are able to make
their livings at nothing other than
I their sports. I expect to see the day
i when there will be less competition
between schools, and more athletic
competition within schools."
Paddock was visiting Templeton, of
J whom he has been a close friend for
! more than ten years. Their friendship
i began in their days of college compe
j tition. He will go to San Francisco on
| business for a few days.
