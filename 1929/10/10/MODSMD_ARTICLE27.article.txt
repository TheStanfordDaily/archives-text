varsity squad will entrain this eve
ning on the southbound limited head
ed for Los Angeles, favorite haunt o£
the U.C.L.A. Bruins.
Accompanying the team will be

kins, the other member of the crutch
toters gang, departed for Los Angeles
last night.
Coach Pop Warner, who was sched
uled to leave for Seattle yesterday to
scout the U.S.C.-Washington game
this week-end, decided to wait over
until after this afternoon's workout,
and in consequence put his charges
through a stiff practice yesterday af
ternoon.
More good news invaded the prac
tice field, when Harlow Rothert and
Perry Taylor showed up in suits.
Rothert's bruised knee is still bother
ing him, though, and he confined his
activities to tossing around a few
passes. Taylor is still wearing a pi
rate's patch over his injured eye, but
will be ready for action in the Bruin
game.
After giving the tackling dummy a
lot of punishment, the first and second
teams adjourned to the bleachers and
watched Pop put the rest of the squad
through an hour's scrimmage. Rudy
Rintala and Bill Clark both got away
for a couple of long open field runs,
while Guido Caglieri gave a neat line
bucking exhibition. In the line "Red"
Thompson and Dick Worden showed
up well on defense.
For the interest of those who intend
to witness the U.C.L.A. game, offi
cials of the southern school made it
known yesterday that no admission
will be charged to Stanford students
presenting student body cards at the
Coliseum gates.

day; Trainer Wallace Denny, Manager
Steve Clark, and two junior managers.
The entire squad is scheduled to go
South, including the Cripple Club com
posed of Johnny Preston, Chuck Er
horn, and Carl Wittenau. Bill Sim
kins, the other member of the crutch
toters gang, departed for Los Angeles
last night.
Coach Pop Warner, who was sched
uled to leave for Seattle yesterday to
scout the U.S.C.-Washington game
this week-end, decided to wait over
until after this afternoon's workout,
and in consequence put his charges
through a stiff practice yesterday af
ternoon.
More good news invaded the prac
tice field, when Harlow Rothert and
Perry Taylor showed up in suits.
Rothert's bruised knee is still bother
ing him, though, and he confined his
activities to tossing around a few
passes. Taylor is still wearing a pi
rate's patch over his injured eye, but
will be ready for action in the Bruin
game.
After giving the tackling dummy a
lot of punishment, the first and second
teams adjourned to the bleachers and
watched Pop put the rest of the squad
through an hour's scrimmage. Rudy
Rintala and Bill Clark both got away
for a couple of long open field runs,
while Guido Caglieri gave a neat line
bucking exhibition. In the line "Red"
Thompson and Dick Worden showed
up well on defense.
For the interest of those who intend
to witness the U.C.L.A. game, offi
cials of the southern school made it
known yesterday that no admission
will be charged to Stanford students
presenting student body cards at the
Coliseum gates.
