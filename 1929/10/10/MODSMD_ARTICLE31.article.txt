# THE
						MAN WITHOUT A COUNTRY

### 
With the partial abolition of Stanford's Lower Division, there has
arisen a new and somewhat awkward problem to be solved by the students
and the administration of this University.
The large group of upper classmen, admitted from other institutions
as juniors and seniors, come here as utterly strange and unoriented as
freshmen. While the latter have four years in which to become Stanford
men, the hapless transfer is here only long enough to secure his degree.
The transfer may rightfully call himself a Stanford man, but too often
he is that in name only. A Stanford man must have more than a degree.
He must have absorbed the spirit and traditions of this institution.
The clubs and the fraternities and the various other societies on this
campus have been too passive in recognizing these newcomers as potential
members. To the average student, who started here as a freshman, the
transfer is something that exists but is of no particular importance.
Tonight Comptroller Almon E. Roth will address the new men stu
dents at a Y.M.C.A. reception on ''Stanford Ideals and Traditions." Such
gatherings as this one serve a purpose and should receive the support of
old students as well as the newcomers.
The fact is that every year brings transfers to this University as
upper classmen who fill the requirements of a Stanford man. The day is
coming when Stanford's various organizations must realize that fact to
survive; the sooner that realization is reached the better it will be.
