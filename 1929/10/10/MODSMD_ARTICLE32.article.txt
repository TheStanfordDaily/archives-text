# THE 						NEWEST WEAPON OF PEACE

Seated side by side before a log fire which lighted up a cabin belong
ing to America's leader, but situated in a remote hinterland whose inhabi
tants had recently to be told of Lindbergh's flight to Paris, Premier J.
Ramsay Mac Donald of Great Britain and President Hoover "smoked
their favorite pipes" and talked heart to heart of the affairs both large
and small which perplex the relations of their respective countries. While
the fire crackled and the bowls of their pipes became warm to the hand,
their minds sharpened, their tongues loosened, and thoughts, which lack
only the uttering to be made into treaties and international rules, were
taken and given. Premier Mac Donald and President Hoover were, in
short, holding a bullsession..
Diplomacy may have marveled at the new procedure —it certainly was
unheard of. Mac Donald said of it: "In these democratic days, when heart
.speaks to heart as deep speaks to deep, and silence talks to silence, person
ality, personal contact, exchange of views by the lip, sitting at two sides
of a fireplace, as it was my great privilege to do this weekend with your
President —these things are to be as important as anything else in laying
the foundation of an enduring peace all over the world."
It has, then, fallen to President Hoover to be the inventor of a new
weapon of peace, a sure, accurate, and democratic weapon, which will
work precisely as the President's own finely ordered mind. And whence
came the idea of personal exchange of thought by a fireside? Why, ob
viously from the President's own fund of college experiences. So we like
to think, at least. The bullsession, from the days of '91 on down, has been
a flourishing institution here, and while quite often it is perverted as a
waster of time, Hoover's youthful imagination doubtless was impressed
while he was a Stanford student with the value of a serious bullsession.
Whether or not we are right in our thesis, we do know that personally
we have often settled the world's problems in bullsessions.
