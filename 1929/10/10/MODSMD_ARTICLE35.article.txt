Review on "Art of Thinking" by Er
nest Dimnet.
Is there an art of thinking? Ernest
Dimnet says there is, and furthermore
he proves his point and proceeds to
tell the average person how he may
improve his mind's "images" and
thereby get his train of thought on a
higher plane.
"If you write letters that differ from
the cook's only as regards a little bet
ter grammar, and if your talk is little
more than the passing exterior of in
terior cinema, then you cannot escape
the pronounced verdict of ORDI
NARY." And it is to the people who
aspire to a bit more of living and a
bit less of existing that Dimnet ad
dresses his book.
Ernest Dimnet is a French abbe, a
Catholic with just about the most
open-minded and liberal outlook on
life that is possible. It is a positive
relief to read a book by such a man
who is intolerant of nothing except
intolerance. Dimnet is widely traveled
and, like Socrates, is of the Universe
and not of any one locality. America
has been the scene of his lecture
tours many times before, he has writ
ten several successful books, and in
a few weeks Stanford will hear him
lecture. This book, the "Art of Think
ing," was first printed in November
1928; we read it when it was in the
26th to 36th thousand, and the last
we heard, over 100,000 copies had been
printed. The success of the book is
thus rather assured.
"Thinking is only a matter of im
ages," says Dimnet. "If you have the
right images, your thought is bound
to be better. If your thought is better,
your life will be just that much
richer, and the world round about you
will present a more beautiful appear
ance. Consequently, if only for a
selfish reason, everybody should want i
to improve his thought. But obses
sions, phantasms, and inferiority com
plexes enter in and we somehow
never thing we have the necessary in
telligence for improvement.
"The main obstacles to thought,"
says the author, "are imitation and
gregariousness, the humdrum experi
ences of life, poor reading, and often
times education itself. America's great
est trouble is gregariousness. We are
afraid to be different from the crowd
and consequently our lives develop
into a blind following of the mob that
is fatal to any kind of real thought.
Education in America is too material
istic. The thought thatc ulture is a
worthless thing is drilled into us from
childhood and we grow up looking
only for the best way to make a liv
ing. What we should be doing is look
ing for the best way to live."
In Europe the case is just the oppo
site. Both systems of teaching pro
duce phantasms that take years to
disappear. The ideal, according to
Dimnet, lies in between, and it is for
this that we should strive.
Helps to thought occur in all of our
everyday life. Newspapers, books, con
versation, reflection during spare mo
ments, and writing can all help us to
higher realms of thinking if only they
are used in the right manner. "Do
not read good books. Life is too short
for that. Read only the best." Do not
read every part of every newspaper.
Read only those parts that will im
prove your knowledge of the world
as a whole. Let your conversation be
worthwhile and not merely a repeti
tion of all that is going on around
you. Use your spare time for honest
pondering and reflection. You will
perhaps live a little apart from your
non-thinking fellowmen but you will
also be not a little above them, and
what you lose in the companionship
of the common herd you Avill gain
through contact with the great minds
of centuries past.
But read the book sometime and if
it inspires you as it inspired us then
life will appear perhaps a bit differ
ent and some things that seemed rath
er important before will not be so
worthwhile now. We have read the
book four times now and every time
we find something missed the times
before. It is short, extremely well
written, interesting, and, above all, it
strikes each of us at our weakest
point, even if Stanford students are
among the upper "ten per cent."

Alcazar Theatre—"Girl Trouble"
With such lines as "You'll never be
the man you would have been if I'd
taken you to college" and"The man
that I can't get just hasn't any
rhythm" coming across the footlights,
one is hard pressed at times to realize
that he is in a Duffy theatre. "Girl
Trouble" is much spicier than the
usual Duffy product, and is cast and
produced with the customary excel
lence found in the theatres of this
chain.
The revolt of a mamma's boy is the
theme song, as it were, with Eugene
O'Brien in the stellar role. All his life
our hero has been kept away from
women by his widowed mother be
cause "Your father had a habit of
associating with strange women —very
strange, if I may say it." And so when
father's ideas break out in sonny boy
after years of maternal repression,
the tumult and uproar that mamma
raises is wortfi going thirty miles to
see.
Having written a book denouncing
women, when once exposed to "It"
our hero gets involved with a married
woman of doubtful reputation, takes
to drink, and in general proves all of
those scientific theories about the
harm caused by sex-repression.
Eugene O'Brien, aside from nervous
ness due to his reappearance on the
stage after years in the movies, gives
a very capable performance. Those
who can remember him in the days
when he and Norma Talmadge were
the Gilbert and Garbo of the screen
will enjoy seeing him in person. His
acting seems to show that the movies
may be a good training-school for the
stage.
Isabel Withers in a too-small part
is excellent —the audience wished her
part had been larger. Grace Stafford
as the girl who finally wins O'Brien
has a most pleasing voice, and Kath
ryn Givney as the stream-line vamp
gives one of the best performances.
"Girl Trouble" is no great play, but
it is funny, well cast (we forgot to say
that mamma is splendidly portrayed
by Mildred Hastings) and, if the
Duffy'3 Purity Standard has hereto
fore annoyed you, rather risque.

"Her Private Life," at New Stanford
Although devoid of a single laugh
or lighter moment to break its tense
drama, "Her Private Life," at the New
Stanford theatre, can be recommend
ed to those who take pleasure in fine
acting and exquisite directorial tech
nique. It is not, however, for the
weary student expecting an evening
of raucous fun or thrilling melodrama.
Billie Dove, thought by many (in
cluding the writer) to be the most
beautiful woman on the screen, again
proves herself an emotional actress
of the first rank, although much of
her success in this role is probably
due to the direction of Alexander
Kordova, a Hungarian director who
has brought to this country the fine
technique of the European screen.
The work of her supporting cast, in
cluding Thelma Todd, Walter Pidgeon,
Montagu Love, and Holmes Herbert,
is on the same plane.
Zoe Akins' story deals with the
marital difficulties of a high-born
Englishwoman whose extravagant
tastes and empty purse have led her
to wed a wealthy butcher. An attrac
tive young American, who puts him
self in a bad light to protect a dis
honest sister, provides plenty of dif
ficulty. —J. S.
