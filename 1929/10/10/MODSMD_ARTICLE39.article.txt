FAR FROM ROBOTS
According to our good friend, Philip
Space, the Oregon Webfoot turned
out to be a DECOY. The final score
substantiates the fact that it was a
wooden-like DUCK that waddled over
the green sward last week-end.
Yet a goodly part of the North
ern BIRD was not muscle-bound,
to say the least. Although the
Webfoot as a whole was decrepit,
its several limbs were plumb full
of activity. In other words, there
were a number of good players on
the visiting team. The Oregon
lads were far from Robots!
A certain Mr. Kitzmiller, for exam
pi j, waß not bad at all. He would in
deed prove a valuable asset on any
high-class gridiron outfit. This "Flving
Dutchman" has a habit of kicking,
passing, and toting the pigskin to per
fection.
Then there was Christensen at
tackle, Shields at guard, Archer at
end, and Stadelman at center. All of
these men were outstanding.
Just why did Oregon show so little,
therefore, though it was cracked up
to be the best lemon-yellow team in
the last twenty years? The Webfoot
ers were up against a much stronger
outfit, of course, but they should have
shown a little more resistance.
Poor judgment is the answer!
The old gag of kicking and wait
ing for the breaks is all right—
but only as long as your team is
out in front. Last Saturday Ore
gon insisted on giving Stanford
the ball, even after the Cardinal
machine was leading by twenty
six laps.
Coach McEwan was either poorly
versed in this principle, or else he
overlooked telling his signal-barker
what to do. And another thing. This
same Mr. McEwan modified the War
ner B formation so thoroughly, that it
was entirely Warnerless and Pop
couldn't have recognized its resem
blance with the use of a high-powered
magnifying glass.

WEST GETS A BREAK
In the past Eastern football critics
have always underrated the playing
ability of Pacific Coast gridiron teams.
Eastern players have always domi
nated all-American selections. The
West has been left out in the cold.
But according to a recent issue of
The Pointer, West Point's bi-weekly
publication:
"Although Stanford has lost
heavily by graduation — two
guards, center, a tackle, a full
back, and a halfback —she will
have one of the strongest teams
on the West Coast. And the West
Coast probably has more strong
teams, playing great football, than
any other section of the country.

were a number of good players on
the visiting team. The Oregon
lads were far from Robots!
A certain Mr. Kitzmiller, for exam
pi j, waß not bad at all. He would in
deed prove a valuable asset on any
high-class gridiron outfit. This "Flving
Dutchman" has a habit of kicking,
passing, and toting the pigskin to per
fection.
Then there was Christensen at
tackle, Shields at guard, Archer at
end, and Stadelman at center. All of
these men were outstanding.
Just why did Oregon show so little,
therefore, though it was cracked up
to be the best lemon-yellow team in
the last twenty years? The Webfoot
ers were up against a much stronger
outfit, of course, but they should have
shown a little more resistance.
Poor judgment is the answer!
The old gag of kicking and wait
ing for the breaks is all right—
but only as long as your team is
out in front. Last Saturday Ore
gon insisted on giving Stanford
the ball, even after the Cardinal
machine was leading by twenty
six laps.
Coach McEwan was either poorly
versed in this principle, or else he
overlooked telling his signal-barker
what to do. And another thing. This
same Mr. McEwan modified the War
ner B formation so thoroughly, that it
was entirely Warnerless and Pop
couldn't have recognized its resem
blance with the use of a high-powered
magnifying glass.

WEST GETS A BREAK
In the past Eastern football critics
have always underrated the playing
ability of Pacific Coast gridiron teams.
Eastern players have always domi
nated all-American selections. The
West has been left out in the cold.
But according to a recent issue of
The Pointer, West Point's bi-weekly
publication:
"Although Stanford has lost
heavily by graduation — two
guards, center, a tackle, a full
back, and a halfback —she will
have one of the strongest teams
on the West Coast. And the West
Coast probably has more strong
teams, playing great football, than
any other section of the country.
FAR FROM ROBOTS
According to our good friend, Philip
Space, the Oregon Webfoot turned
out to be a DECOY. The final score
substantiates the fact that it was a
wooden-like DUCK that waddled over
the green sward last week-end.
Yet a goodly part of the North
ern BIRD was not muscle-bound,
to say the least. Although the
Webfoot as a whole was decrepit,
its several limbs were plumb full
of activity. In other words, there
were a number of good players on
the visiting team. The Oregon
lads were far from Robots!
