# "DAILY" PUTS OVER SPEEDY ONE ON OLD BOY; SALE TODAY
## 
### 
Thirty years old today!
The Daily was so anxious to
congratulate the Old Boy yester
day on what it thought was his
birthday that it just couldn't
wait. His birthday is really to
day, and the gay old duffer ab
solutely refused to do any cele
brating ahead of time.
The Old Boy says there is noth
ing he would enjoy more for a
birthday present than a shiny
new quarter; and for every one
he gets he is going to give away
a copy of his "Aviation" number.
The Old Fellow forgot his usual
modesty long enough to say that
he thinks today's issue will be
one of the best he has ever had
to offer. He expects to be so busy
receiving congratulations that he
has asked a number of his beauti
ful young friends to help him to
day in supplying everyone with
his Chappie.
