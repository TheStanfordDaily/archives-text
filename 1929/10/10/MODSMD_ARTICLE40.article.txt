# NEED MORE WOMEN SINGERS FOR CHOIR, SAYS WARREN ALLEN
## First Meeting of Group to Be Held Tonight; New Material Is Good 
### 
"More sopranos and altos, as well
as other voices, are needed in the
Stanford choir," Warren D. Allen
stated in an announcement about
chorus rehearsals, which begin to
night under his direction in the organ
gallery of the Chapel. He asks that
all students who are interested report
tonight. If they have not yet sung for
him, they may do so after the re
hearsal, he announced.
The new singers already enrolled
are excellent material, Mr. Allen said.
He added that too few women had
turned out. Choir work, according to
Mr. Allen, will be of particular inter
est this fall because of the carol ser
vices to be given in December, and
the study of a great choral work by
Bach in winter quarter.
"Anyone with an accurate sense of
pitch is eligible for the choir," stated
Mr. Allen, "even though there has
been no previous study, and provided
there is no glaring vocal defect.
Whether one wishes to take the work
for credit or not, students should wel
come this opportunity to study fine
music in one of the world's most beau
tiful churches."
