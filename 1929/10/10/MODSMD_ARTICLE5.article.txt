# HUNT IS PESSIMISTIC AS CARD YEARLINGS FACE BRONCO FROSH
## Santa Clara Eleven Holds Win Over Bear Cubs; Cards Crippled 
### 
Stanford's freshman football team
has a large assignment Saturday af
ternoon when they meet the Bronco
yearlings on the local gridiron. The
Santa Clara eleven, with a G to 0 vic
tory over the California freshmen to
its credit, will be the best team that
the baby Redshirts have opposed this
season.
Coach "Husky" Hunt is very pessi
mistic regarding the chances of his
team against the Mission College
eleven. With two regular tackles and
a halfback laid up with injuries, and
some of the other first-string men un
able to start, the Cards will have a
tough time holding the Broncs on
even terms.
In scrimmage last night, Hunt had
his third team using Santa Clara plays
against the regulars. The frosh looked
good on the offense, but failed to put
up an impressive defense against the
scrub players. The outstanding weak
ness of the yearlings has been their
defensive playing, and unless this is
bolstered before Saturday, the Cards'
chances are small.
