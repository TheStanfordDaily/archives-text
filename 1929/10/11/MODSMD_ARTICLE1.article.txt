# LINDY LANDS AT MIAMI; REPORTS MAYAN FINDINGS
## Complete 20-Day Expedition Of Scientific Research In Tropical Lands 
### 
MIAMI, Fla., Oct. 10. (/P)—Colonel
■Charles A. Lindbergh arrived here at
6:12 p.m. today from Cozumel Island,
Mexico, completing a twenty-day in
spection flight around the Caribbean
Sea during which time he made sev
eral aerial explorations of ancient
Mayan cities in Central America. It
■was dark when the plane landed.
Four ancient Maya cities, hitherto
uncharted, were discovered yesterday
by Col. Charles A. Lindbergh, his wife,
and their companions in several hours'
fiying in inland Quintana Roo.
The first was sighted within an hour
after the party left Belize, British
Honduras, and shortly after it crossed
the Rio Rondo into the territory. Sev
eral definite mounds set about a tri
tion was mapped carefully, although
angular plots were found, and the loca
it was too cloudy for photographing
it.
When the third city was discovered
later in the afternoon Santa Cruz In
dians beneath ran from the plane as
it flew above them. The ruins were
lrid out in almost a perfect square on
sloping hills, from the highest of
which the Maya masonry was perfect
ly visible to those in the plane. Num
bers of small dwellings, temples, and
mounts appeared in the north.
Col. Lindbergh sighted the fourth
ruin, probably the most interesting
find of the day, a great mound rising
€0 or 70 feet above the ground, with
its crumpling walls visible from as
far as 22 miles away.
