# "ROBIN HOOD OF HIGH FINANCE" GETS 15 YEARS
## Protests Innocence Under "Moral Obligation" to His Depositors 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 10 (/P).â€”An elder
ly small town banker who came out of
the West with a scheme that caused six
of New York's biggest hanks to turn
over $500,000 to his credit pleaded guilty
today to mail fraud, but insisted that he
was a Robin Hood of high finance, rather
than an ordinary criminal.
The man is Charles DeLos Waggoner,
president of the bankrupt Bank of Tel
luride, Colorado. He was sentenced to
fifteen years in Atlanta penitentiary. Be
fore sentence was imposed he told the
judge before whom he entered his unex
pected plea just how he thought his fraud
should be regarded.
"I was under a moral obligation to
commit crime/' he said. "It was a matter
of duty. The people of Telluride were
largely dependent on that bank. It was a
matter of protecting depositors, persons
of Telluride whom I knew and whom I
did not want to suffer."
United States Attorney Charles H.
Tuttle drew a far different picture of the
crime and the criminal. He said his in
vestigation had shown that Waggoner
long had been looting his own bank and
when he realized at last that the day of
reckoning was upon him, he concocted
the half-million-dollar coup in the hope
that he could cover up his earlier mis
deeds.
"The only reason why the Bank of Tel
luride went under," Tuttle said, "was the
same that causcd the private bank of the
Clarke Brothers in this city to go to the
wall a few months ago. It had been scut
tled from the inside."
