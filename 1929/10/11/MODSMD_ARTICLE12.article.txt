BRIARCLIFF MANOR, N.Y., Oct.
10 (/P). â€”Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler,
president of Columbia University and
head of the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, today delivered the
address of welcome at the opening of the
Institute of International Law sessions
here. Elihu Root, a former Secretary of
State, presided.
Dr. Butler told the members of the
Insttiute that "You have come here at the
psychological moment in the history of
the modern world at the precise instance
when the stage has been set for the larg
est understanding of your past."
"Here I will mention," he continued,
"four great men who have done much in
this work in which you are interested:
Gustav Stresemann, whose passing at this
moment is a grievous loss to the world;
Aristide Briand; and the two men on
whose conversation the world is at pres
ent waiting, Premier Mac Donald of Eng
land and President Hoover of the United
States.
"In their conversations the curtain has
merely risen on a new era of national
conduct because it has risen on a new
era of national thinking."
