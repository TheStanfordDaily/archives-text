# America Accepts England's Invite To Arms Parley
## United States Makes First Reply to Proposals of British Government 
### 
WASHINGTON, 0.C., Oct. 10 (#»).—
The American acceptance of Great Brit
ain's invitation to the Naval Limitations
Conference in London next January was
sent to the British capital this morning
almost at the moment of the departure
of Prime Minister Mac Donald from
Washington.
It was the first acceptance in response
to the invitation of October 7 asking the
powers to participate in the proposed con
ference. With the formality disposed of,
American officials were awaiting word
from Tokyo, Paris, and Rome regarding
the attitude of those governments toward
the British invitation.
Press dispatches from Japan, France,
and Italy concerning the attention which
is being given by the officials of those
countries to the invitation were being
keenly watched. President Hoover in his
informal talks with Mr. Mac Donald dur
ing the past week had assured the pre
mier that full co-operation could be ex
pected from the United States in the limi
tation movement.
