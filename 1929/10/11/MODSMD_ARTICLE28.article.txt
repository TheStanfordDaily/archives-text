### 
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 10 (/P).â€”More
adults than high school students attend
public school classes in California, Vier
ling Kersey, superintendent of public in
struction, declared todav.
These adult students, Kersey said, may
be classified under five headings:
1. Those who want to complete high
school courses and gain required credits
for college entry.
2. Those who dropped out of high
school before finishing their courses.
3. Those who finished high school at
too early an age and have forgotten cer
tain essentials.
4. "Americanization" students studying
to gain naturalization papers.
5. Those wishing to make profitable
their leisure time.
Declaring he had enumerated these ac
cording to the numbers in each classifi
cation, Kersey pointed out that although
the Americanization groups or "foreign
ers" rated first in a nation-wide survey
of adult education, they were fourth in
California.
