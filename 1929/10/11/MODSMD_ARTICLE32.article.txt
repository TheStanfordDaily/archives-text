# CARDS REST FOR BRUIN GAME; POP SPEEDING NORTH
## Warner Scouts Trojan-Husky Tilt; Thornhill, Winterburn In Charge of Varsity Squad All-Southern Team to Start Against Uclans; Spaulding To Show Stronger Eleven 
### Stephen Dietrich 
While Coach Pop Warner speeds
through the tall timbers toward Seattle
to scout the Washington-U.S.C. game, the
forty-nine members of the Cardinal foot
ball squad are spending today in Los An
geles, at the threshold of the U.C.L.A.
Bruin's lair, resting up for tomorrow's
Coast Conference clash.
Although the Cards went through but
a light workout before entraining for the
South last night and will not even don
their football togs today, the big white
jerseyed team is. not taking tomorrow's
game as a joke. The players remember
all too well what happened two years
ago in the Santa Clara upset, when Pop
went away on one of his scouting expe
ditions.
Six Reserves in Lineup
Far from being worried over the Bruin
battle, however, Tiny Thornhill and
Chuck Winterburn, who are in charge of
the Stanford stalwarts during their south
ern invasion, intend to use as many
players as possible. In fact, at least six
reserves are scheduled to appear in the
starting lineup, as Warner has decided to
let the members of the varsity squad
registered from the South show their
wares to their home-towners.
An all-Southern Stantord eleven can
hardly be considered as weak, for no less
than twenty-seven of the forty-nine men
on the squad call the southern part of the
state their home. Moreover, live or six
first-string men hail from down yonder
below the Tehachapi.
As a whole, the squad is in pretty fair
shape again. Harlow Rothert is back in
uniform, and may see action in the game
tomorrow. Bill Simkins has deserted the
Crutch Brigade, having tossed his walk
ing sticks away before departing for Los
Angeles. But Simkins, along with John
ny Preston, Chuck Ehrhorn, and Carl
Wittenau, will witness the Bruin contest
from the sidelines, although they are ex
pected to be out for practice before next
week-end.
Bruins Work Hard
As for the U.C.L.A. outfit, it might be
said that Coach Spaulding does not expect
his men to come out on the long end of
the score tomorrow, but he does think
that the Bruins will hold Stanford to a
small score. Last week's 56 to 6 win over
Fresno State has injected a bit of con
fidence into his charges, and for the past
few days they have been working hard
on defense against the Cards' favorite
passes and reverse plays.
The outstanding players on the Bruin
team are Captain Carl Brown, tackle;
Cliff Simpson, quarter; Norm Duncan,
full; and Buddy Forster, half. Forster is
a speedy and tricky ball packer, as War- I
ner's men will well remember. Last year
he ran a kick-off back ninety-seven yards
to a touchdown through the entire Stan- '
ford team. Duncan is only a sophomore,
yet he is one of the best line plungers in
the southern part of the state. Besides i
running the team at quarter, Simpson
does most of the team's passing and
punting.
Following is the probable starting line
up for tomorrow's encounter, though sub
ject to last-minute changes:
Stanford U.C.L.A.
Albertson LFR Bishop
Artman LTR Nelson
Hulen LGR Noble
Heinecke C French
Heiser RGL Lloyd
Tandy RTL Brown (C)
Neill REL Rasmus
Hillman Q Simpson
Moffatt LHR Thoe
Winnek RHL Forster

Bruin's lair, resting up for tomorrow's
Coast Conference clash.
Although the Cards went through but
a light workout before entraining for the
South last night and will not even don
their football togs today, the big white
jerseyed team is. not taking tomorrow's
game as a joke. The players remember
all too well what happened two years
ago in the Santa Clara upset, when Pop
went away on one of his scouting expe
ditions.
Six Reserves in Lineup
Far from being worried over the Bruin
battle, however, Tiny Thornhill and
Chuck Winterburn, who are in charge of
the Stanford stalwarts during their south
ern invasion, intend to use as many
players as possible. In fact, at least six
reserves are scheduled to appear in the
starting lineup, as Warner has decided to
let the members of the varsity squad
registered from the South show their
wares to their home-towners.
An all-Southern Stantord eleven can
hardly be considered as weak, for no less
than twenty-seven of the forty-nine men
on the squad call the southern part of the
state their home. Moreover, live or six
first-string men hail from down yonder
below the Tehachapi.
As a whole, the squad is in pretty fair
shape again. Harlow Rothert is back in
uniform, and may see action in the game
tomorrow. Bill Simkins has deserted the
Crutch Brigade, having tossed his walk
ing sticks away before departing for Los
Angeles. But Simkins, along with John
ny Preston, Chuck Ehrhorn, and Carl
Wittenau, will witness the Bruin contest
from the sidelines, although they are ex
pected to be out for practice before next
week-end.
Bruins Work Hard
As for the U.C.L.A. outfit, it might be
said that Coach Spaulding does not expect
his men to come out on the long end of
the score tomorrow, but he does think
that the Bruins will hold Stanford to a
small score. Last week's 56 to 6 win over
Fresno State has injected a bit of con
fidence into his charges, and for the past
few days they have been working hard
on defense against the Cards' favorite
passes and reverse plays.
The outstanding players on the Bruin
team are Captain Carl Brown, tackle;
Cliff Simpson, quarter; Norm Duncan,
full; and Buddy Forster, half. Forster is
a speedy and tricky ball packer, as War- I
ner's men will well remember. Last year
he ran a kick-off back ninety-seven yards
to a touchdown through the entire Stan- '
ford team. Duncan is only a sophomore,
yet he is one of the best line plungers in
the southern part of the state. Besides i
running the team at quarter, Simpson
does most of the team's passing and
punting.
Following is the probable starting line
up for tomorrow's encounter, though sub
ject to last-minute changes:
Stanford U.C.L.A.
Albertson LFR Bishop
Artman LTR Nelson
Hulen LGR Noble
Heinecke C French
Heiser RGL Lloyd
Tandy RTL Brown (C)
Neill REL Rasmus
Hillman Q Simpson
Moffatt LHR Thoe
Winnek RHL Forster
