# Physicians Declare Fall Too Ill To Face Trial
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 10 (JP).â€”
On the report of three physicians who
examined Albert B. Fall today under or
ders of the District of Columbia Supreme
Court depends the decision whether the
bribery trial of the former Secretary of
the Interior will continue or be declared
a mistrial.
The latter course seemed more likely
tonight, as one physician other than Fall's
personal doctor told Justice Hitz today
that the aged defendant was not able to
stand trial. Fall has not left his hotel
room since Tuesday, when he was as
sisted from the court room on the verge
of collapse.
