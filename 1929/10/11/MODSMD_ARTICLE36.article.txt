# CREAKING FOR PUBLICITY
## 
### 
It is only a year ago that Stanford received unmerciful publicity in
the rasping press of this fair land regarding the "creaking of the honor
system" at this institution. Opponents and critics made merry that the
honor system should show signs of failure at one of the foremost uni
versities of the United States.
The cause for all this comment was the sensational charge made by
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur in the opening assembly of 1928 that the honor
system was "creaking" and that something should be done about it.
However, by the following April we find Dr. Wilbur expressing a
very different opinion of honor systems in general. Speaking before the
National Association of Deans and Advisers of Men, Dr. Wilbur said:
The diploma that a man gets from an institution is supposedly earned
by him. If it is a clean diploma, one that he has earned by square and
satisfactory work, he can be satisfied with it, but if it is contaminated by
a whole group of other diplomas that are a little smoky or perhaps dirty,
there is no way by which he or the public can distinguish after gradua
tion between grades of diplomas that have been given, so that the honor
system should be maintained by a self-protecting organism, not by a
student-teacher complex. None of us hesitates either to stop playing
cards with the man that cheats in cards or to throw him out, so why
should the students hesitate to throw out the student who cheats them?
He does not cheat the teacher.
I think that in the shifting of standards there has been more and
more of a tendency for the honor system to become sound. This is due
to the acceptance of responsibility by the students as individuals and as
groups, and in that I see the best opportunity that we have in our uni
versities for the development of new standards of conduct and of new
opportunities for the development of responsible citizens.
Now that time has mellowed Dr. Wilbur's charges we can pause for
retrospection. Stanford's honor system might have been creaking, but not
nearly as loud as it was made out to be. It is our belief that Dr. Wilbur
understands the value of publicity very well, though not a publicity seeker
himself. Realizing the one way to stir up student opinion was to charge
that the honor system was becoming decadent, he did so, very success
fully.
Dr. Wilbur's charges have borne fruit in that they moved the students
to think about and uphold the honor system. Yet it is to be regretted that
the public received a false impression of the working of the Stanford
Honor Code. Regardless of how much it improves, Stanford will not get
enough publicity to call attention to the fact that the Honor Code does
work and that the vast majority of Stanford students are honest..
