# BIG TIME JOURNALISM

Those down 011 the Farm who read that great family journal, the
San Francisco Chronicle, were somewhat startled yesterday morning to
discover a headline that contained these cryptic statements. "Stanford
Lid Ordered Down"—"Dean of Men Frowns on 'Frat' Rushing"—
" 'Hell Week' College's Shame."
If one were sure that the unknown head writer meant his masterpiece
to be as funny as it sounds—and if one were sure the average reader
understood its humor—then the thing could be passed off as the joke it
really is.
Unfortunately, however, chances are that the headwriter was not
being funny. He was being sensational. Furthermore, all the clerks along
Montgomery Street and the farmers down the San Joaquin will swallow
it as gospel fact and remember the University's "shame" the next time
a collegian runs his car through a concrete retaining wall.
It wouldn't be so bad if the clerks and the farmers were to read the
story appearing beneath the headline. Giving the facts as they really are,
it shows how exaggerated the caption is. But the clerks and the farmers
probably won't read it. They will simply remember how the dean frowns
on the "frats" and how the lid has been clamped down on Hell Week.
The Chronicle modestly calls itself the "Leading Newspaper of the
Pacific Coast." That, of course, is a matter which could be debated.
There are thousands, however, who staunchly maintain that the paper is
the acme of conservatism, and read it for that reason. If the Chronicle
values its reputation in this respect it will do well to suppress those em
ployees who have Hearst tendencies.
