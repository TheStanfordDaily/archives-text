# WHICH GROUP OVER-EMPHASIZES?

### 
The perennial athletics censureship season is well under way. At
about this time of the year, critics of our educational system remonstrate
against the interest in sports. Some of their contentions, it must be ad
mitted, may be correct. But a great deal of their presentation is one-sided.
Sports are for the participation and enjoyment of youth, it is perti
nent to note that the criticisms usually emanate from the ranks of people
past middle age. Recent newspaper reports have it that William Howard
Taft, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, has joined with
the dissenters.
When a man occupying his position says something, it is usually
worthy of attention. Chief Justice Taft is quoted as decrying the "over
shadowing of scholarship by athletics." "The more I think about it,"he
is reported as saying, "the more I am convinced that there is something
radically and fundamenally wrong with our whole college system."
Over-emphasis on athletics, he believes, is the fundamental root of all
educational evils.
With due respect to the wisdom of the Chief Justice, that statement
is a little hard to accept without question. In the first place, scholarship
is not in such a deplorable state, at least at Stanford. Even in colleges
which do not have the scholastic average which is maintained here, can
all the blame be laid to interest in competitive sports?
Omitting all reference to the alleged benefits of athletics, one wonders
if an abolishment of football, for instance, would immediately result in
a greater interest in scholastic endeavor. College men will answer in the
negative. The natural trend of youth is toward action and excitement.
If it is not to be found on the athletic field, who knows where youth
would turn for it?
If such statements were made by the dean of America's highest
tribunal, they were not meant exactly in the vein presented. It would
seem a safe guess to say that an interviewer with an eye for the sensa
tional has used only such comments as he believed would make interesting
reading.
