# Campus Opinion
## A 						CHEERY "HELLO" ALWAYS HELPS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
That Stanford is a university among
universities, we learned even before we
sought to come here. Stanford traditions
and Stanford ideals reached us and found
a place in our hearts, even as we planned, ]
in our last year of junior college life, our
future education. And those traditions, |
those ideals, we seek to uphold to the best
of our ability that we, too, may become
true Stanford students.
We heard in our pre-Stanford days of
that hello spirit that prevailed on the
campus—a spirit, unknown to many uni
versities, that makes every passing man
truly a fellow student, and establishes a
basis for future friendships.

We came with that tradition and ideal
fixed solidly in our hearts and minds, and
met —disappointment.
Where, yon older students that guide
campus action, has the hello spirit gone?
Has it disappeared into that realm of for
gotten ideals? Or is it still among us,
but not to be shared by us pseudo
juniors ?
We transfers come with an open mind,
with a will to learn. Although junior in
standing, we are in need of that orienta
tion into Stanford ideals as much as the
freshmen. And we ask with all humble
ness of spirit, but with an inquisitive
mind, "Where is that Stanford 'hello'?"
