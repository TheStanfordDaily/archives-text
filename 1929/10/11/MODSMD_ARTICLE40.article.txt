# THE 						BIG TOP AND THE SIDE-SHOWS

The Editor, Sir:
One of the most interesting features of
the early season football games here at
Stanford this year has been the triangular I
competition for attention between the
band, cheer leaders, and the public ad
dress system, with the audience coming
out the loser. The Oregon game saw a
good deal of confusion on this account,
but that struggle will be as nothing com
pared to the U.S.C. and Big Games, when
we will have the added competition of
another band and rooting section to deal
with.
Certain it is that all three factors of
band, rooting, and announcements are en
titled to some share of the tim\ When
the speakers are shouting the Eastern
grid scores, the band is playing "When
the Monkey Wrapped His Tail around
the Flagpole," and Speegle and his merry
men are endeavoring to coax a Skyrocket
from the assembled students, the result is
as unintelligible as a baby's first gurgles.
In the good old days, many a yell lead
er was worn to a frazzle trying to get in
a yell before the other college could, but

with the added starter of the speaker
system, Specgle will be forced to give
an interpretation of the Breakaway to get
in any cheers whatsoever. Therefore, for
the sake of harmony, some arrangement
must be made. At the smaller games,
when no other outside competition is pres
ent, have the band sit in front of the root
ing section and thus permit the yell lead
ers and bandmaster to co-operate. Allot
the loud speaker system certain definite
times prior to the game, during the in
termission at the half, and the like for
sundry announcements, and give the bal
ance of the time to the students. This
will give the band and the rooters time
out periods and odd moments to break
forth in New Spells and Skyrockets.
The larger games would necessitate
still other allotments of time, for the
rooting sections would need opportunities
for stunts. However, some pretense of
order must be established, or nothing can
be accomplished. We suggest that the
Rally Committee take the matter into
consideration.
Thank you,
