"WHEEL OF LIFE"
The Varsity Theatre today starts
the "Wheel of Life," Richard Dix's
second talker. It's one of Dick's last
pictures for Paramount, and not one
of his best.
"The Wheel of Life' indulges in a
little Oriental mysticism, plus some
Southern California scenery that is
supposed to look like India or Man
churia or some place. There are fan
talistic priests, scary situations, and
a sure-fire love situation. It is simple
amusement when it doesn't drag.
Dix gallantly but not very convinc
ingly stops a strange lady (Esther
Ralston) from jumping into the
Thames. He is more or less taken by
the lady but loses track of her. Then
he is sent to India. Then the darnedest
thing happens. The commander of the
Indai Indian post announces the ar
rival of his' wife, and when she is
introduced to Richard, would you be
lieve it? It's the same dame! Leave it
to Hollywood!
"The Wheel of Chance" is the me
dium kind of entertainment that you
like if you are not in too critical a
mood. Esther Ralston is easy to look
at, and her voice doesn't spoil the
illusion. Dix was better in "Nothing
But the Truth," but so was his part.
The action drags, and the situations
are a bit false, but the Varsity is
handy. -—Joe Thompson.
"THE SHELF"—President.
The very smart showman, Henry
Duffy, realizing the importance of the
Frances Starr name and the reputa
tion of the Starr ability, left no stones
unturned in a very evident effort to
create a one-man, or one-woman, if
you like, production in "The Shelf."
Thanks to the author, Dorrance Davis,
Miss Starr was flooded with sparkling
lines shot with flashing wit and cos
mopolitan remarks that accentuated
the gulf between her mind and those
of the other characters, who were
either unintentionally funny or sadly
stupid.
Author Dorrance Davis has followed
the well-worn path of poking fun at
the great American small town —a na
tional sport devised by Sinclair Lewis
in "Main Street." Davis shows a flash
of originality by naming the small
town "Kiwanisport" instead of the
usual "Rotaryville." He proceeds to
again expose the hypocrisy of the
American hamlet by placing a cosmo
politan woman, charming and clever
but experienced, among the gossipy
figures of "Kiwanisport." She continu
ally outwits them, laughs at them, ex
poses them, and finally succeeds in
bringing them meekly to her feet after
they had demanded that this "scarlet
woman" elave the sacred precincts of
their city.
None of the usual stage conceptions
of the Babbitt type are forgotten.
There is the gossipy old maid, the"I
want to be bad" minister, the hypo
critical church woman, the scheming
financier and the sharp up-state poli
tician; all small minds, that the fair
visitor flips at will. It is far from
being an original situation, true
enough, and yet Author Davis de
serves congratulations for natured fun
and not with cynical sneers. They are
not despicable; merely awkward and
slow-thinking.
Miss Starr, we must admit, made
the most of her many opportunities;
of the same temper of Jane Cowl in
comedies, is graceful, brilliant, re
served and confident, turned her head
slightly and smoothed her hair in
that well-known drawing-room gesture
when speaking her more-polished
lines. It was all slightly worn but this
was evidently unnoticed by the vastly
amused audience last night.

Delectable in her enthusiasm and
petite in her loveliness Miss Doris
Phillips made the most of the small
part of Caroline Wendham. Miss
Phillips is very attractive and adds
to her charming appearance a tal
ented sense of good dramatic taste.
Almost overshadowed by the trail
ing figure of Miss Starr, William
Lloyd as Senator Risdale contributed
a keen character. He displays a knowl
edge of stage technique that is very
pleasing.
The appearance of Miss Leah Wil
son as the browbeating Mrs. Chest
wold was perfect. She created a snap
ping-tongued, flashing-eyed leader of
a small-town gossip group.
Unfortunately the play was marred
by the remainder of the cast who dis
played poor dramatic judgment of
just what is universally considered
ham. Despite their negative efforts
"The Shelf" is pleasingly amusing.

Mary Queen of Scots, by Margarete
Kurlbaum-Siebert. Trans, by Mary
A. Hamilton. Published by Har
court, Brace & Co.
To add to the ever-growing list of
historical biographies, there comes a
new book, the life of that tragic
queen, Mary of Scots.
Written by a German, Margarete
Siebert, the book seems to lose noth
ing by its translation into English.
The style is simple and vivid, and the
use of the modern methods and free
dom in biography creates a real, vital
person of this almost legendary queen.
Any story built around Mary would
be interesting, for she has always ap
pealed to the imagination through her
beauty and unhappy fate.
We see Mary at eighteen, intelli
gent, witty, and spoilt, already a
widow, and once queen of France. For
the first time since her birth, she sets
foot in Scotland, to take up the task
of ruling that turbulent land.
Scotland of this period is in the
clutches of religious dissensions. John
Knox is heard thundering from the
pulpit against the "harlot of Rome,"
the Catholic Church. The Catholic
queen is the center of plots, counter
plots, both religious and political. In
England rules the great Queen Eliza
beth, Mary's cousin, who shapes the
inevitable tragedy.
Both legendary and historical facts
are used to trace the story of Mary
and the three men that loved her,
Darnley, Rizzio, and Bothwell. How
true these facts are it is difficult to
judge, but at any rate their record
makes a diverting tale.
With the Queen's long imprison
ment and subsequent execution the
book does not deal. We are only given
an extremely colorful portrait of Mary
at the height of her beauty and power.
For those who enjoy the more inter
esting side of history, this is a book
well worth reading. —N. J.
"Kept Women," by Vina Delmar.
(Harcourt Brace and Co.) New
York.
What a false alarm Miss Delmar
turned out to be this time.
Imagine the disappointment that
hopeful readers of Liberty must have
experienced who followed "Kept Wo
men" in serial form as week after
week went by and the story remained
deadeningly respectable.
In the published form, "Kept Wo
men" is not quite such a shameful
deceit, for it takes only a short time
to discover that this novel has not the
slightest right in the world to such a
title. Not only the book is not risque
or indecent —it is even moral in spots
—blatantly, laboriously so.
It is really a pity that the title can

be explained and disposed of so eas
ily, for it, at least, is rather interest
ing and challenging. The book itself
must stand inspection next, and the
process is dispiriting.
"Kept Women" wobbles badly. To
say that Vina Delmar climbs a notch
or two when she writes the successor
to "Bad Girl" is only a dubious recom
mendation. However. "Kept Women"
is a dubious piece of work from prac
tically every angle.
To begin with, does Miss Delmar
use that childish, disconnected, illogi
cal style of writing, because sho is
under the impression that she is being
brilliantly original and distinctive, or
simply because she is incapable of
ordinary good diction?
Inferiority of style can sometimes
be overlooked, if the plot of charac
terization is good enough to make up
for it —as is so often the case in this
age of careless but excessively clever
writing. However, "Kept Women's"
plot needs redeeming even more than
its garbled style. Miss Delmar at
tempts to turn a very passable short
story plot into a full-size novel, with,
the result that there are sporadic
flashes of interesting and convincing
situations, while the rest of the book
is filled with limp conversations and
inane soliloquies until it finally trick
les to the end that it might just have
well have come to sixty or seventy
thousand words sooner.
The characterization goes much bet
ter. Hubert Scott, whose inclination to
be daring and immoral is more or
less thwarted by his constitutional
thickness of mind, is quite ably han
dled. Lillian Corey is the hapless shop
girl whom Hubert Scott tries to go
wrong with. In contrast to Scott's
enormous denseness, Lillian has a cer
tain amount of common sense as well
as a great deal of loyalty, and is eas
ily the best character in the book.
She is both human and possible.
The thin merit that the book pos
sesses centers around this "Lily of
the Field," first in the naive joy she
feels in being a lady, and later in the
genuine pathos of her inevitable dis
illusionment. —M. L. R.
