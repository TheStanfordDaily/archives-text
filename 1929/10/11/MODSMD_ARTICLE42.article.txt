# Soviet Flight Delayed By New Motor Installation
## 
### 
CRAIG, Alaska, Oct. 10 (./P). â€”Due to
the lack of mechanical equipment and the
infinite care being exercised by the Rus
sian aviators, the work of installing the
new motor in their plane, "Land of the
Soviets," en route from Moscow to New
York, has progressed more slowly than
was anticipated, it was learned here. As
a result, it was not expected that the
installation would be completed until late
Friday, which would delay the flight from
Waterfall, Dall Island, to Seattle until
at least Saturday.
