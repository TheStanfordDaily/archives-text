Speaking of problems—well, Coach
"Husky" Hunt has surely run up against
some "darbs" while attempting to organ
ize a successful frosh football team. Sonie
are funny, some tragic; but the total pre
sents a hard problem to any coach.
Frosh are supposed to be green. But
there is a superlative to green, and it
presents such a light shade that it may
be compared to, if we might say, dense
nnss. Anyway, a certain husky lad with
a tendency toward football signed up at
the beginning of the fall practice period.
He hadn't had much experience, in fact
he couldn't find the football field, hor
two whole days he searched in vain over
the dry fields in back of the power house,
looking for the yearling gridiron.
Then there was the other '33. He only
wished to turn in his suit every night. At
his third reappearance for a new suit, the
gymnasium clothes vendor Questioned the
mysterious action. The poor frosh had
no place to put his football apparel. He
didn't know that freshmen could have
lockers.
Then Comes Tragedy
But the worst part is the football part.
Hunt is having an unusually hard time
getting the frosh to soak up football
fundamentals. The Warner system is
difficult for the relatively inexperienced
yearling, but in the past years the fresh
men have been quicker to master the re
verse and other complicated plays.
In the contest against Menlo Junior
College, the whole Stanford team showed
some exceptionally fine blocking and in
terference on one play, enabling a man to
make an eighty-five-yard run to a touch
down after taking the ball on a kick-off.
No less than nine Jaysee players were
removed from the play by brilliant block
ing. But in the same game, the freshmen
showed some very poor defensive work.
Straight defensive playing is relatively
easy alongside of blocking for an open
field run. Figure that one out.
And injuries. To start the season right,
three of the leading candidates for tackle
positions were hurt in the first game, and
"Husky" has had a hard time filling their
shoes. One of the classiest halfbacks on
the squad hasn't been able to start either
of the first two games because of injuries.
If last year's team had been so crippled
with injuries it would have been necessary
to cancel half the games.
Here's the Schedule
Then there is the schedule, and what a
lineup. Sacramento Junior College, Men
lo Junior College, Santa Clara freshmen,
U S.C. freshmen, U.C.L.A. freshmen, St.
Mary's freshmen, and the Cal freshmen,
on successive Saturdays! Eight tough
games in a row, and not a resting place
or set-up in the lot! How could any
coach be optimistic in face of that sched
ule ?
Both the Santa Clara and Saint frosh
have victories over the Bear yearlings to
their credit. The former outfit is big and
heavy, with a fast offensive and strong
defense. There is a rumor that there are
twenty-five former high school captains
on the Saint squad, and it is enough just
to mention U.S.C. and California.
Just imagine the Varsity pitted against
the Olympic Club eight Saturdays in a
row, and you'll have a fair comparison to
the freshman schedule.
