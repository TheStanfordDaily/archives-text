# GRAY ELEVEN FACES S.B.C. IN FIRST TILT
## Santa Barbara Coached by Hal Davis; Boasts a Veteran Team 
### Theodore DeMotte 
As an added attraction, rather than as
a preliminary to the Santa Clara-Stan
ford freshman game, the Stanford Grays
will meet Santa Barbara State Teachers
College eleven in the Stadium tomorrow
at 12:30. Coaches Cuddeback and Ro
besky have been giving their charges
plenty of heavy work all week in prepa
ration for what they expect to be a tough
game.
The Santa Barbara State team is
coached by Hal Davis, former Stanford
Gray coach, who had plenty of oppor
tunity to study the Warner system while
he was here. That he has a strong team
is indicated by the fact that Santa Bar
bara held the Occidental College Tigers
to a couple of touchdowns last week.
A tentative line-up given out by the
coaches includes Spud Hardy, scrappy
little varsity baseball catcher, at quarter,
Phil Wilson and Slip Gilbert, halves, and
Chuck Eddie at full.
Phil Baker, husky fullback, may see
service if his knee, injured in practice
last week, is well enough. The line will
consist of Milligan or Quirk, center,
Doub and Grey, tackles, Miller and either
Eby or Lyons, guards, and Colvin and
Clark, ends. The entire line is composed
of fast, heavy, aggressive men who have
all had lots of experience.
Practically the entire line is composed
of veterans of last year's freshman team,
kept in the Grays according to the usual
Warner policy of conservation. In its
workouts this week, the backfield has
shown plenty of promise of a smooth
running attack, with Eddie, Wilson, and
Gilbert carrying the ball. Every man in
the line has had at least one year of ex
perience in football at Stanford, and
every man seems to know his stuff.
Capable reserves for most of the posi
tions fill out the squad. And one thing
is certain—that if the backfield is able to
punch over the touchdowns, the Grays
will make the extra points, for Grey,
husky tackle of last year's frosh, is about
the most expert man in the business of
place-kicking on the Farm, with Wilson
to hold the ball.

is indicated by the fact that Santa Bar
bara held the Occidental College Tigers
to a couple of touchdowns last week.
A tentative line-up given out by the
coaches includes Spud Hardy, scrappy
little varsity baseball catcher, at quarter,
Phil Wilson and Slip Gilbert, halves, and
Chuck Eddie at full.
Phil Baker, husky fullback, may see
service if his knee, injured in practice
last week, is well enough. The line will
consist of Milligan or Quirk, center,
Doub and Grey, tackles, Miller and either
Eby or Lyons, guards, and Colvin and
Clark, ends. The entire line is composed
of fast, heavy, aggressive men who have
all had lots of experience.
Practically the entire line is composed
of veterans of last year's freshman team,
kept in the Grays according to the usual
Warner policy of conservation. In its
workouts this week, the backfield has
shown plenty of promise of a smooth
running attack, with Eddie, Wilson, and
Gilbert carrying the ball. Every man in
the line has had at least one year of ex
perience in football at Stanford, and
every man seems to know his stuff.
Capable reserves for most of the posi
tions fill out the squad. And one thing
is certain—that if the backfield is able to
punch over the touchdowns, the Grays
will make the extra points, for Grey,
husky tackle of last year's frosh, is about
the most expert man in the business of
place-kicking on the Farm, with Wilson
to hold the ball.
As an added attraction, rather than as
a preliminary to the Santa Clara-Stan
ford freshman game, the Stanford Grays
will meet Santa Barbara State Teachers
College eleven in the Stadium tomorrow
at 12:30. Coaches Cuddeback and Ro
besky have been giving their charges
plenty of heavy work all week in prepa
ration for what they expect to be a tough
game.
The Santa Barbara State team is
coached by Hal Davis, former Stanford
Gray coach, who had plenty of oppor
tunity to study the Warner system while
he was here. That he has a strong team
is indicated by the fact that Santa Bar
bara held the Occidental College Tigers
to a couple of touchdowns last week.
