## Minority Party Spokesman Sees New Committee if Quibbling Continues 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 10 (/P).â€”
A warning to the Republican leaders in
the Senate that the "fault will lie with
the administration," if a tariff bill is not
enacted during the present session, was
given today by Senator Robinson of Ar
kansas, the Democratic leader.
In a statement issued by the Democratic
National Committee and giving his views
on the situation, Robinson said that if ad
thc passage of the tariff bill because of
ministration senators choose to prevent
the repeal of the existing flexible pro
visions which President Hoover wants
retained, "they must take full responsi
bility."
By a decisive majority, Robinson said,
the Senate restored to Congress the pow
er to change tariff rates now vested in the
executive. Recognizing that the coalition
that repealed the existing flexible section
is in danger of losing its fight in confer
ence, the minority leader said that if the
Senate conferees prove indifferent or re
creant they may be discharged and others
chosen by the Senate itself. Such a pro
posal already has been advanced by Sena
tor McKellar, Democrat, Tennessee.
