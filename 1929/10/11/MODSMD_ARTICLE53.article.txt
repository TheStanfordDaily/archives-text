# COACH HUSKY HUNT STARTS BUILDING BASKETBALL TEAM FOR '30 SEASON
## 
### 
With most of last year's varsity and freshman basketball squads busy cavorting
around the gridiron, Coach Husky Hunt faces the task of building this year's team
from a group chiefly of inexperienced players.
At present some thirty-five ambitious hoop-men are working out in the pavilion,
headed by Fawcett, Berg, Mears, Hawkins, Loomis, and Sexson of last year's
varsity, and Ray of the 1932 squad. Rothert, Moffat, and Reynolds, all of whom

Pwere frequently found in the varsity line
up last winter, and Doub, Baker, Grey,
and Rintala, comprising the majority of
the triumphant freshman quintet, have
found football of more interest than
basketball.
As games are already scheduled with
the Y.M.I, on December 21 and Oregon
State on December 26, Hunt faces the
prospect of playing a number of contests
without the services of Captain Rothert.
Arrangements are expected to be made
for two or three other games during
Christmas vacation, with a strong possi
bility that the squad will again pay a
visit to Reno to take on Nevada.
Conference basketball will commence
early in winter quarter with two games
to be played against U.S.C. in Los Ange
les on January 10 and 11, and one game
against U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles on the
following week-end. U.S.C. is expected
to make a strong bid for honors, as they
have back all but one of the men with
whom they won the conference title two
years ago.
California will miss the services of
Corbin, all-conference center for two
years, Stevens, flashy forward of last
year's team, and Gregory, all-conference
guard, but has plenty of capable men to
take their places.
