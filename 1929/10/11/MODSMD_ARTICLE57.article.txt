# NECESSARY APPARATUS PRESENTED TO SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING HERE

### 
Stanford's Mechanical Engineering
Department was the recipient of three
rather useful gifts the latter part of
the summer and the first part of Octo
ber. The first of these gifts was a
Marmon Eight engine, Model 70, the
first of the former "baby" Marmons.
This engine is to be used in the Mech
anical Engineering Laboratory for
dynamometer tests.
Later the Byron Jackson Pump Com
pany of Berkeley sent down a 2x6
Byron Jackson two stage pump for
use in the Hydraulics Lab. This pump
has been connected to a twenty-horse
power three-phase electric induction
motor mounted on the same base as
the pump.
The Linde Air Company has loaned
the department indefinitely four sets
of oxy-acetylene welding apparatus.
These sets will be used for class in
struction in the forge shop. Hereto
fore the forge classes have been lack
ing ill welding equipment but with
the new apparatus, instruction will be
given the use of oxy-acetylene.
