### 
OKLAHOMA CITY, Oct. 10 (/P).—
The ingenuity of man triumphed today
over a fire which had roared its defiance
since early Tuesday, when an enormous
new gas well of the Sinclair Oil & Gas
Company in the South Oklahoma City
field ignited, throwing a torch of flame
150 feet into the air.
With a charge of thirty quarts of
glycerine-dynamite as their weapon, a
crew of four oil field fire fighters ad
vanced on the fire monster, placed the
charge in a vital spot, and retreated to a
spot of safety, from which they exploded
it by electricity.
The tremendous concussion separated
the flame from the feeding column of
gas, and the fighters rushed in to play
streams of water on the white hot wreck
age of the steel derrick, which melted
down soon after {he well was ignited.
