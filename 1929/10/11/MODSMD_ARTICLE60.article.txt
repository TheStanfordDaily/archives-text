# Athletics Confident Of Sweeping World Series From Chicago
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., Oct. 11
— Tingling with pride, Philadelphia
stirred today in the brisk sunshine of per
fect football weather, shook out over
coats and mittens, made final desperate
demands for tickets — and settled • back
complacently to wait the second stage of
the World Series of 1929.
As the triumphant Athletics of Connie
Mack rushed home from Chicago with
two straight victories over the Cubs to
present home-town fandom, the jubilation
of the warriors themselves leaped on
ahead to the staid old Quaker city. Ev
erywhere — in the crowds on spacious
Broad Street, the lobbies of hotels al
ready jammed, business houses and knots
of plain rooters on the street corners—ran
the same happy confidence in the Ameri
can League champions.
With their backs literally lined up to
the walls of Shibe Park, the grim but
determined Chicago Cubs came into town
at 12:22 p.m. yesterday, with a small,
amiable crowd to greet them at the sta
tion. There was little gayety among
Manager Joe McCarthy's warriors and
the tenseness of the situation showed in
their taciturnity and bearing.
The third game of the series opened at
Shibe Park today, with the fourth game
tomorrow and the fifth, if necessary, on
Monday. The Cubs said there would be
a fifth, sixth, and even a seventh game,
despite the smashing triumphs of the
A's in the first two clashes in the Mid-
West.
