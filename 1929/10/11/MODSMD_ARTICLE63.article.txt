# CARD FROSH MEET BRONCS TOMORROW
## SANTA CLARA FIRST YEAR GRIDDERS FAVORED TO WIN Best Yearling Squad Turned Out in History of Mission College; Stanford Ragged in First Two Contests of Season; Bill Bates Replaces Virg Choate at Center 
### 
Local football fans will have a chance to witness one of the strongest freshman
teams on the coast in action here tomorrow when the Santa Clara yearlings meet
the Stanford frosh at 2: 30 on the varsity gridiron. The Broncos, with the heaviest
and smoothest running first-year team ever turned out at the Mission College, are
installed as heavy favorites to best the Cards in tomorrow's contest.
The baby Redshirts have looked unimpressive in the last two practice sessions.

seeming to lack the fire characteristic of
Stanford teams. In their first contests,
the frosh put up a listless defense, and
unless they show more pep tomorrow, will
probably fall easy prey to the strong
Santa Clarans.
Coach "Husky" Hunt and Assistant
Coach "Rabbit" Bradshaw declare that
the frosh are not woefully weak in any
one department of the game, but that

some trouble. In an effort to strengthen
the team, Hunt has shifted some of his
former second-string men to the regular
line-up.
Bill Bates will start at center tomorrow
in place of Virg Choate, who started the
last two games. Bates is the more ag
gressive player of the pair, and has been
passing more consistently during the last
week. Choate will probably see action
before the game is over, however.
Five former Lowell stars will have a
chance for a little private battle during
the Stanford-Santa Clara game. Hedge
and Laborde, end and tackle respectively,
two of the outstanding linemen on the
Card frosh team, will play directly op
posite two of their former team-mates,
Molinari, end, and Slavich, tackle, ot
the Bronco yearlings. Dowd, the filth
former Lowell man, plays halfback for
the Mission College team.
The biggest gun on the Bronco eleven
is Hardeman, fullback. Tipping the scales
at 190 pounds, Hardeman is the heaviest
and hardest hitting back on the Santa
Clara team. Besides his ability to hit the
line, he is a good passer and kicker, and
fair at broken field running.
In their two games played to date, the
Broncs have shown plenty of power,
downing San Mateo Junior College 24 to
6, and besting the Cal frosh 6 to 0. But
