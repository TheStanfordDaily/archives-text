# EXPERIENCED CAMPUS ACTORS INCLUDED IN "IVORY DOOR" CAST
## Tom Henry, Katherine Keho, Paul Speegle to Take Principal Parts 
### 
Three of the principal parts in A. A.
Milne's symbolical play, "1 he Ivory
Door," will be taken by students whose
acting in campus productions in the past
recommends the coming performance of
this fantasy, to be given on November 1.
Tom Henry, who will play the part of
King Hilary, proved to be the mainstay
of campus dramatics this summer when
he was summoned twice from the South
to act under Gordon Davis. In the first
production of the summer, klmer kice s
satire, "The Adding Machine," Henry
took a very difficult role after three days
of preparation. Then as the last play
of the season, Karel Chapek's " I he Ma
kropoulos Secret," drew near, Davis
again called for Henry, who came up to
take the part of Baron Prus. And now
Henry returns to the Stanford stage as
King Hilary, the father of the adventur
ous young Prince Perivale.
Paul Speegle and Katherine Keho, play
ing the delightful parts of the piince,
who ventures through the mysterious
ivory door, and the princess, who follows
her betrothed into the unknown territory
l>eyond its threshold, have also appeared
in numerous Stanford productions. Kath
erine Keho's work last year in barries
comedy "What Every Woman Knows
was probably the most outstanding of the
season.
raid Speegle is a well-known campus
figure, having taken part in numerous
footbal shows and junior operas. His
"A Radio Fiasco," done with Burnell
Gould mi the 1928 Big Game Gaieties, was
such a complete success that it was re
peated several times later that year. In
1927, Speegle played one of the principal
parts in Franz Molnar's comedy "The
Swan," and his comic part in last year's
circus opera, "Moving On," is unforget
table.
