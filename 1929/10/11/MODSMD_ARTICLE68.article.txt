# INSTALL SOUND-PROOF PARTITION TO REMOVE DIFFICULTY IN OFFICE
## 
### 
To facilitate the handling of student
employment at Stanford the appointment
office has recently been separated into
two parts by a sound-proof partition.
The partition fulfills a long-felt need as
it separates the office proper and the wait
ing room which formerly have both been
in one large room. The new arrangement
will not only make the office quieter but
will greatly help in systematizing the
work of taking care of the great number
of students who come to the appointment
office for interviews and registration.
The Stanford employment bureau un
der the direction of Mrs. Snell not only
affords valuable service to the students
who arc seeking work but also maintains
a rcferencc library for the use of those
students whose work interferes with their
use of the regular library.
