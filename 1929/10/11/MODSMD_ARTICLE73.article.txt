# Curator Of Stanford Museum Visits South Seas With Expedition
## 
### 
"There are still regions where life
isn't as tame as in the suburbs, where
people can see crocodiles and sharks and
be eaten by them, and where the inhabi
tants go about clad in their complexions,
enjoying life as well as modern people,"
declares Albert W. Herre, curator of the
Stanford Zoological Museum. Herre has
just returned from a year's travel in the
South Sea Islands, as a member of the
Crane Pacific Expedition.
Herre was sent as a delegate from
Stanford to study the fish of the South
Sea Islands and brought back between
9,000 and 10,000 specimens. He found the
fish of the Sepik River in New Guinea
the most interesting, most of them never
having been collected. The collections of
the Crane Expedition are to be divided
between the Field Museum of Natural
History and the Stanford Museum.
Sees Mound Turkey
Herre tells of many unusual birds
which were encountered in his travels,
those of New Guinea being of special
interest. The mound turkey was perhaps
the most singular, he declares. It differs
widely from our birds in nesting habits,
laying its eggs in mounds several feet in
diameter and leaving them to hatch. In
proportion to the size of the bird, the
eggs are extremely large.
The islands of greatest interest were
New Hebrides, Solomon Islands, and
New Guinea. In the latter, especially, the
people are still living in a very primitive
condition, there being some on the Sepik
River who are still in the Stone Age. The
Crane Expedition is the second party to
visit them. Although Herre has lived
among primitive people a great deal, he
says he has never encountered any so
primitive as those in the remote regions
of New Guinea.
Natives Carry Guns
"In certain of the New Hebrides men
go about with loaded rifles, never laying
them down during their waking hours.
However, these implements are thirty or
forty years old, traffic in firearms and
ammunition being forbidden now," ac
cording to Herre.
The Crane Pacific Expedition had its
own ship, and travel in the interior was
done chiefly by water.
"There are still regions where life

the Crane Expedition are to be divided
between the Field Museum of Natural
History and the Stanford Museum.
Sees Mound Turkey
Herre tells of many unusual birds
which were encountered in his travels,
those of New Guinea being of special
interest. The mound turkey was perhaps
the most singular, he declares. It differs
widely from our birds in nesting habits,
laying its eggs in mounds several feet in
diameter and leaving them to hatch. In
proportion to the size of the bird, the
eggs are extremely large.
The islands of greatest interest were
New Hebrides, Solomon Islands, and
New Guinea. In the latter, especially, the
people are still living in a very primitive
condition, there being some on the Sepik
River who are still in the Stone Age. The
Crane Expedition is the second party to
visit them. Although Herre has lived
among primitive people a great deal, he
says he has never encountered any so
primitive as those in the remote regions
of New Guinea.
Natives Carry Guns
"In certain of the New Hebrides men
go about with loaded rifles, never laying
them down during their waking hours.
However, these implements are thirty or
forty years old, traffic in firearms and
ammunition being forbidden now," ac
cording to Herre.
The Crane Pacific Expedition had its
own ship, and travel in the interior was
done chiefly by water.
"There are still regions where life
isn't as tame as in the suburbs, where
people can see crocodiles and sharks and
be eaten by them, and where the inhabi
tants go about clad in their complexions,
enjoying life as well as modern people,"
declares Albert W. Herre, curator of the
Stanford Zoological Museum. Herre has
just returned from a year's travel in the
South Sea Islands, as a member of the
Crane Pacific Expedition.
Herre was sent as a delegate from
Stanford to study the fish of the South
Sea Islands and brought back between
9,000 and 10,000 specimens. He found the
fish of the Sepik River in New Guinea
the most interesting, most of them never
having been collected. The collections of
the Crane Expedition are to be divided
between the Field Museum of Natural
History and the Stanford Museum.
