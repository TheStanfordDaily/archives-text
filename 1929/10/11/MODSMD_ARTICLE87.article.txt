# EXPERIMENTAL FARM DEVELOPS NEW FRUIT FROM HYBRID PEACH
## Wight Breeds Variety After Twenty Years' Work In U.S. Orchard 
### Ted DeMotte 
In his experimental orchard on the
old Stanford estate, W. F. Wight, in
charge of thn United States experi
mental farm, has developed a new va
riety of peach that is expected to sup
plant all other peaches in a few years'
time.
The new fruit, which is apricot color
from the skin to the pit, is the result
of more than 20 years of patient ef
fort in hybridization. It is very late,
having just ripened, and has a tiny
pit as compared to other varieties of
peaches. It is expected to be particu
larly valuable as a late peach for can
ning purposes.
Sarted Work Years Ago
Years ago, Wight started his work
of crossing and re-crossing peaches
that had the most desirable character
istics. In addition, he started work on
a number of other fruits, including
apricots, pears, prunes, plums, and
nectarines. He has found that a num
ber of trees thought adapted to dif
ferent climates will thrive here.
After Wight had been working a
number of years on the experimental
project, Stanford University set aside
a portion of land for the continuation
of the work. Wight transferred his
experiments to the new gardens in
1922.
In the season just past, according
to Wight, 1500 hybrids out of the
2000 that he now has in the orchard
bore fruit. He is keeping a close
check on the characteristics exhibited
by each tree and has many other ex
cellent "creations" in prospect.
Commercial Value Certain
The principal purpose of the United
States Department of Agriculture in
the experiments has been to develop

fruits that will not have the undesir
able qualities that cause the canners
and packers considerable trouble at
present. The main difficulties experi
enced in the canning of peaches have
been a tendency of the pits to split,
lack of firmness in the fruit, and large
pits. These troubles seem to have
been overcome by Wight in the new
peach.
Although the department is certain
of the commercial value of several
varieties of fruit developed here, no
propagating wood will be distributed
for some time to come, except to ex
perimental stations.
