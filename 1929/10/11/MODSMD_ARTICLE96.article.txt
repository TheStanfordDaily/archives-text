# DIAMOND PROSPECTS IN 1930 EXCELLENT SAYS COACH WOLTER
## Summer Japan Trip Looms For Squad; Five Veterans Gone 
### 
Although facing the loss of five
lettermen, Coach Harry Wolter is un
usually cheerful over baseball pros
pects for the coming season. The Card
mentor must replace Frank Wilton,
captain and center fielder of last
year's nine; Cook, first baseman; Sta
ley, second sacker, and a pair of hurl
ers in Lewis and Kern, but he has a
raft of veterans back, plus several
promising men from the 1929 frosh.
In addition, there is a prospect of a
tour of Japan next summer as an
added incentive to the candidates.
To supplement his hurling corps
of Taylor, Simkins, Smalling, and
Story, Wolter has McLean, mainstay
of the frosh nine. Spud Hardy and
Don Oswill, both of whom saw lots of
action last year, will handle the back
stopping assignment, with assistance
from Dixon and Evans of the year
lings. Teague, Wright, Haddenfeldt,
and Marks will battle it out for the
first base job, Churchill and McGrath
are on deck at the keystone sack,
Johnson at short, and Captain Willie
Laird at the hot corner.
In the outer garden, Hunken, Rin
tala, Fox, and Wittenau are available
for duty, with Red Berg putting in a
bid for a regular post after the basket
ball season closes. Berg can also take
his turn behind the bat.
There is a possibility that the new
baseball field on which work was
started last spring will be ready for
use this year. It is located on the site
of the sunken diamond which the
frosh used for so many years. At all
events, this is the last year of use for
the present varsity field.
