# Milwaukee Fire Causes $50,000 Damage To Hall
## 
### 
MILWAUKEE, Wis., Oct. 10 (/P).â€”
Like a great torch standing out against a
dark sky, the cupola of Milwaukee's city
hall, 400 feet above the street, burned to
its steel framework last night while fire
men watched helplessly.
More than damage was done
by the fire, which was too high to be
reached by hose lines. While the top
portion of the huge tower burned, show
ering embers to Water and Wells Street,
the clock, in a frame of fire, kept run
ning, giving the exact time.
