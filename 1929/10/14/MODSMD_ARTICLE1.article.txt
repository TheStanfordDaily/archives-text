# SECOND STEP IN ANGLO-AMERICAN AMITY EXPECTED
## Believe MacDonald Statement Will Deal With a Subject Of Interest to Canadians British Premier Plans Visit In Ottawa Before Ending American Good Will Trip 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 13. (/P)—Before
sailing for home next week, Ramsay
Mac Donald, Great Britain's Prime
Minister, is expected to make an an
nouncement of another important step
in the negotiations with President
Hoover looking to a better Anglo-
American understanding.
Naturally the nature of the pro
nouncement is carefully guarded, but
since it is to be made in Canada after a
conference there with Prime Minister
MacKenzie King, and other Dominion
officials, speculation is that it will
deal with a matter in negotiations
which is of interest to Canada.
Unofficial information here tonight
was that Mac Donald would make the
•statement at Ottawa next Thursday,
but whether it would take the form
of a written document or be embodied
in the address he is to make that
night at a dinner to be given by the
Government in the Parliament build
ing was left to conjecture.
The British statesman will arrive
at Ottawa early Thursday and will
spend the afternoon alone with King
on a visit to the Prime Minister's
country property at Kingsmere.
In his final statement before leav
ing Washington, Prime Minister Mac-
Donald said some of the matters
which he and President Hoover had
discussed would be studied by sec
tions of the British Foreign Office
and that others would be taken up
with the Dominions.
