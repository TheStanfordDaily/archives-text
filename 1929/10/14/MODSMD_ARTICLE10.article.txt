# WIN FOR LABOR PARTY SEEN IN ANTIPODES VOTE
## Australian Laborites Score First Victory; Strong Support Lacking 
### 
MELBOURNE, Australia, Oct. 13.
(/P) —Continued tabulations of returns
from the general elections of yester
day confirmed the Labor victory but
the final figures still were unavailable
late tonight.
It appeared that Labor had won 44
of the 75 seats in the New House, Na
tionalists 16, the Country Party 10,
Independent Nationalists 3, with two
other seats held by other Independ
ents. Some ministers of the late Na
tional Government were defeated and
it was not even certain whether for
mer Premier S. M. Bruce would be
elected.
Although it appeared that James
Henry Scullin, the Labor leader who
will be the next Prime Minister, would
have a workable majority in the
House, there still is a strong Nation
alist majority in the Senate. Should
this body be in disagreement with the
House for two consecutive sessions
it may be dissolved and new elections
called.
The chief issue of the election was
the attempt of the Nationalist Govern
ment to modify the present arbitra
tion system for labor disputes in a
way which the Labor party contended
revealed an aim to reduce wages.
The success of the Labor party in
Great Britain also was a decisive
factor.
