# ALFRED HERTZ STARTS SYMPHONY REHEARSAL FOR FIFTEENTH YEAR
## 
### 
Rehearsals of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra will begin to
night under the direction of Alfred
Hertz in preparation for the opening
of the 1929-30 season. This year will
be Hertz's fifteenth consecutive one
as director of the Symphony, and the
coming season will be his last with
this organization.
Alfred Hertz will probably make his
final appearance on the Stanford cam
pus on December 4, when the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra will
give the opening program on the
A.S.S.U. Concert Series. Hertz has
just returned from New York and
promises many novelties for the com

As a special feature of the opening
program, Ignaz Friedman, the famous
Polish pianist, has been secured as
solo artist.
Season tickets for the five events
of the series are $2.50 and $4.00, to
Stanford students, faculty, and em
ployees. They may be obtained at the
A.S.S.U. Office in the Old Union Build
ing between the hours of 8:30 and 12
and from 1 to 5.
