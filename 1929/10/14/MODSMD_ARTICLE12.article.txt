# STANFORD FELLOWSHIP BOARD PLANS TO GIVE SERIES OF DAILY TEAS
## 
### 
Daily teas for the students and
faculty, to be held each afternoon
from 4:30 to 5:30 o'clock in the base
ment of the Women's Clubhouse, are
being initiated today by the Stanford
Fellowship Board. The purpose of
these teas is to foster a mingling of
all University members.
The fellowship board is an out
growth of the movement for the abo
lition of the Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A.
as separate organizations. It has be
come a group in which men and
women may work together on campus
projects. All finances are derived from
voluntary contributions.
The board has sponsored week-end
trips to Yosemite and Big Basin, and
various visits to the homes of profes
sors. These visits are to be continued
again this year, but special empha
sis is being laid upon the new after
noon tea.
