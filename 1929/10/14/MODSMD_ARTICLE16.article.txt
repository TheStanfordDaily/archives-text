# Ultra-Modern Sanitation Guards Stanford Mermen
## 
### 
Ultra-modern sanitary precautions
have been taken by the Board of Ath
letic Control in the construction of
the three new pools recently finished
at the men's gymnasium. The two
larger pools are now in use. Spring
boards are being erected over the
diving pool and in the sand pits. The
water now in the pools has been fil
tered despite the fact that the new
filter plant will not be finished for a
week.
Wire will enclose the tanks so that
men in street clothes cannot track
dirt close enough to contaminate
them. The gymnasium and the pools
are so constructed that men from
locker rooms will have to pass
through shower rooms where a thor
ough soap bath must be taken. Swim
mers also must pass through a foot
bath which may be treated with anti
septic as an additional precaution.
