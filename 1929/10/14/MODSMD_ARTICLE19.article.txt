# CANADA SOLVES RUM SITUATION BY REGULATION
## Neighbors Rid Themselves Of Bootleggers Without Aid of Prohi Laws 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13. (JP) —The
Association Against the Prohibition
Amendment has concluded after a
study of the Canadian liquor control
system that 93 per cent of the Cana
dian people have rid themselves of
bootleggers by doing away with pro
hibition and adopting various meth
ods of government regulation.
Other conclusions drawn from the
investigation, made public today by
the Association, were that government
control "demonstrates that the liquor
traffic can be so regulated as to pre
vent abuses which affect public wel
fare and morality." Intemperance has
decreased, and savings have in
creased.
The study was based on the opera
tion of the various Canadian govern
ment control systems in all but two
provinces—Nova Scotia and Prince
Edward Island —and the conclusions
were offered, the Association said, to
"persons who may wish to know the
facts about the Canadian systems, and
particularly those who accept the
evils of the Volstead Act only because
they prefer that law to the saloon."
