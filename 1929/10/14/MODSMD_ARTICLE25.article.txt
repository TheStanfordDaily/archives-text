# Emerson Names Two Speakers To Debate Oxford Team Nov. 12
## 
### 
Two of the three speakers who will
represent Stanford in the debate with
Oxford University on November 12
were announced Saturday by Profes
sor J. G. Emerson, debate coach. They
are Robert McClintock and Henry
Harris. Inability of the judges to de
cide on a third speaker will necessi
tate further tryouts on next Friday;
at this time Laurence Kimpton, Irving
Rosenblatt, Smith Stevens, and Her
bert Wenig will compete for the posi
tion of first speaker for the Stanford
team.
Judges at the tryouts last Friday
were Coach Emerson, Professors Ed
ward M. Hulme, Wiiliam H. Davis,
and Lee Emerson Bassett, and Lee
Chapin, assistant to Emerson in de
bate work.
The question to be used in the de
bate itself has been the subject of the
tryout speeches. It is "Resolved, That
this is the best of all possible
worlds." Stanford will speak on the
affirmative against Oxford.
McClintock and Harris are both sen
iors with several years of varsity de
bating to their credit. The former
placed second to Robert Hume of
Stanford in last year's Joffre Medal
debate. Harris was the outstanding
speaker in the debate with U.S.C. last
year, and was also a member of the
team that toured the Northwest dur
ing the spring.
