# STANFORD GRAYS WIN OVER SANTA BARBARA STATE TEACHERS 24-0
## 
### 
Staging a typical Stanford come
back, the Stanford Grays scored all
their points in the second half to de
feat the Santa Barbara State Teachers
College eleven in the Stadium Satur
day 24 to 0, after being held on even
terms during the first two quarters.
Miliar, playing guard for the Grays,
was the outstanding performer during
the first half, making the majority of
the tackles and throwing the Teachers
for losses consistently. The lines of
both teams played good ball and gave
the opposing backs little opportunity
to show their wares. And when the
backs did carry the ball, there was
so much fumbling, that it was impos
sible to make yards.
At the start of the second half, the
Grays recovered a fumble on the
Teachers' twenty-yard line. Two line
plays failed and the Grays lined up
for a try at a field goal from the
twenty-two yard line. With Wilson
holding the ball, Grey sent it high
over the crossbar for three points.
Soon after, Miller fell on the ball on
the Teachers' twenty-yard line after a
punt was blocked. Keenan passed to
Wilson for fifteen yards, who then
took the ball for the remaining five
yards and a touchdown. Grey con
verted.
A long pass, Wilson to Colvin netted
forty-eight yards and a touchdown as
the fourth quarter started. Grey again
converted. After the kickoff, Gilbert
started an off-tackle buck near mid
field. He managed to dodge, twist, and
straight-arm his way through the
Teachers' line and backfield after
being tackled several times and finally
got into the clear for a long run to a
touchdown. Grey converted again to
make the total score 24 to 0.
Grey, Doub, Colvin, and McNamara,
in the line, and Wilson, Gilbert, and
Keenan in the backfield, played well
in the second half.
