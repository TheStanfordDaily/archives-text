# STANFORD TAKES POINT-A-MINUTE GAME AT U.C.L.A.
## Cardinal All-Southern Team Outclasses Bruins in 57-0 Victory by Straight Plays Oregon State Squad Expected To Furnish Stiff Opposition For Varsity Next Saturday 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Back on The Farm after handing
the humble U.C.L.A. Bruin a brutal 57
to 0 beating at Los Angeles Saturday,
the big Cardinal varsity will settle
down to serious practice this after
noon in preparation for the second in
vasion from the Northwest.
Stanford is scheduled to meet Ore
gon State here this coming week-end,
and the game without doubt will pre
sent an entirely different situation
than the U.C.L.A. affair. This latter
game, heralded beforehand as a set
up, proved to be a mere workout for
some thirty Redshirts.
At best it was a listless encounter—
more or less of a dummy scrimmage.
The Stanford backs simply took turns
in trotting down the field for long
gains during the greater part of the
afternoon's entertainment.
All-Southern Team
Coach Pop Warner's plan of start
ing an all-Southern team worked to
perfection, as it not only allowed the
boys a chance to show off before their
Los Angeles and vicinity henchmen,
but gave them an opportunity to see
action and roll up playing minutes
toward a block letter.
The final score doesn't really indi
cate the difference between the two
outfits, as the Stanford Grays would
probably give the Bruins a good run
for their money. For one thing, the
Cards didn't open up much. All nine
of the scores resulted from drives,
consisting almost entirely of running
plays, for about half the length of the
gr'"
Straight Football
The twenty thousand Los Angele3
cash customers, who sat through the
sixty listless minutes of play, didn't
get even as much as a peek at Pop's
collection of laterals and passes. Tiny
Thornhill and Chuck Winterburn, who
had charge of the white-clad huskies
during the southern trip, crossed up
the scouts and common persons by
sticking to straight football tactics.
However, the team didn't look too
good at times. After shoving over two
scores in quick succession to start
the game off right, the Cards began
to loaf a bit. Before they woke up to
the fact, the lJruins had marched
right down to the Cards' four-yard
line. Hut Stanford held and U.C.L.A.
lost the ball on downs.
Defense Ragged
The defensive work was rather
spotty all afternoon. The players
seomod to be going about their jobs
half-heartedly, and failed to smack
their opponents with the usual amount
of pep. Whenever the Bruins threat
ened the goal line, though, the line
demonstrated that it can still hold all
right.
Although the regulars were con
tented to take things easy most of (he
time, a couple of the reserves came
through with some real playing.
Guido Calglieri, who has been show
ing uj> so well in practice of late, was
especially effective in reeling off
lengthy gains.
Oregon State Good
With the U.C.L.A. farce in the dis
card now, the varsity will have to perk
up a whole lot during the next five
days before it takes the field against
Oregon State. The Trojans, who
smothered Washington last Saturday,
had one tough time winning from the
Aggies by a fourteen-point margin.
From all appearances, the O.S. team
will give Stanford a much harder bat
tle than did the highly reputed Ore
gon U. outfit two weeks ago.

sixty listless minutes of play, didn't

Thornhill and Chuck Winterburn, who
had charge of the white-clad huskies
during the southern trip, crossed up
the scouts and common persons by
sticking to straight football tactics.
However, the team didn't look too
good at times. After shoving over two
scores in quick succession to start
the game off right, the Cards began
to loaf a bit. Before they woke up to
the fact, the lJruins had marched
right down to the Cards' four-yard
line. Hut Stanford held and U.C.L.A.
lost the ball on downs.
Defense Ragged
The defensive work was rather
spotty all afternoon. The players
seomod to be going about their jobs
half-heartedly, and failed to smack
their opponents with the usual amount
of pep. Whenever the Bruins threat
ened the goal line, though, the line
demonstrated that it can still hold all
right.
Although the regulars were con
tented to take things easy most of (he
time, a couple of the reserves came
through with some real playing.
Guido Calglieri, who has been show
ing uj> so well in practice of late, was
especially effective in reeling off
lengthy gains.
Oregon State Good
With the U.C.L.A. farce in the dis
card now, the varsity will have to perk
up a whole lot during the next five
days before it takes the field against
Oregon State. The Trojans, who
smothered Washington last Saturday,
had one tough time winning from the
Aggies by a fourteen-point margin.
From all appearances, the O.S. team
will give Stanford a much harder bat
tle than did the highly reputed Ore
gon U. outfit two weeks ago.
Back on The Farm after handing
the humble U.C.L.A. Bruin a brutal 57
to 0 beating at Los Angeles Saturday,
the big Cardinal varsity will settle
down to serious practice this after
noon in preparation for the second in
vasion from the Northwest.
Stanford is scheduled to meet Ore
gon State here this coming week-end,
and the game without doubt will pre
sent an entirely different situation
than the U.C.L.A. affair. This latter
game, heralded beforehand as a set
up, proved to be a mere workout for
some thirty Redshirts.
At best it was a listless encounter—
more or less of a dummy scrimmage.
The Stanford backs simply took turns
in trotting down the field for long
gains during the greater part of the
afternoon's entertainment.
All-Southern Team
Coach Pop Warner's plan of start
ing an all-Southern team worked to
perfection, as it not only allowed the
boys a chance to show off before their
Los Angeles and vicinity henchmen,
but gave them an opportunity to see
action and roll up playing minutes
toward a block letter.
The final score doesn't really indi
cate the difference between the two
outfits, as the Stanford Grays would

for their money. For one thing, the
