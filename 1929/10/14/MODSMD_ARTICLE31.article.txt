# "HELL-WEEK UNDER THE MICROSCOPE"
## 
### 
At this season of the year it is the vogue for Stanford fraternities to
engage in their perennial pre-initiatory activities, more commonly and
appropriately known as "hell-week" in university parlance.
It is a sure sign of progressiveness that there is a minimum of this
sophomoric practice on this campus. No longer do fraternities require
their pledges to carry little tin buckets on the Quad or make them climb
trees or touch wood whenever one of the "brothers" whistles. Public
demonstrations are regarded as being in poor taste and as decidedly anti-
Stanford.
Much time and space have been given to the arguments for and
against "hell-week." Because in the past the proponents of such practices
have won out, fraternities have degenerated in the eyes of the mature
public. Dean T. A. Clark of the University of Illinois, one of the fore
most authorities in the United States on fraternities and their problems,
lists five arguments generally proposed by those favoring "hell-week."
Dean Clark, a seasoned fraternity man, answers these arguments con
cisively and completely. His remarks are:
1. It gives the freshman an appreciation of his proper place;
that is, it humiliates him, humbles him, creates in him a satisfac
tory inferiority complex, as it were, so that he can adequately
appreciate the honor that is being conferred upon him in permitting
him to become a member of the organization concerned. One
fraternity officer told me that no one was able properly to receive
the lessons taught in the formal ritual of his fraternity until he was
in a state of mental and physical exhaustion. It must be a won
derful ritual which demands a semi-comatose mind to understand
it.
2. It unifies the members of the freshman class and brings
them into closer sympathy with each other. I believe it does, but
I am not at all sure that this is a wholly good thing to do.
3. The freshmen expect it and would be woefully disappointed
if the trials of the rough-house initiation were omitted. Scores of
witnesses are brought forward to testify to the fact that the rocky
road over which they traveled previous to the formal initiation
into their fraternity made the deepest impression upon them of
anything connected with the event, and gave them the greatest
pleasure â€”after it was over! You ask such a man what the ritual
was all about and ten to one he can not tell you anything about it.
He was so obsessed with the rought stuff that he was not impressed
with the serious principles of the ritual.
4. Well, we've always done it. Of course that settles the mat
ter. Whatever it is, is right and should be continued to the end of
time. It would be fatal to have an original idea on a subject of
that sort, and so everyone goes on as before.
5. Other fraternities still do it, and besides we got it hard last
year, the sophomores assert, and it looks as if we ought to get a
crack at the other fellows. Here it is a case of getting even with
someone. It was a case of "an eye for an eye" and no matter
whose eye it was.
Stanford fraternities have come a long way from the "hell-week" as
practiced in the average university. It is only a matter of time, according
to fraternity leaders, that "hell-week" will die out through its own
obnoxious nature. It is up to the Stanford fraternities to uphold their
leputation of being abreast of the times and of standing on their own
feet without regard to tradition. Immediate action should be forthcoming
in abolishing "hell-week" on this campus.
This is a worthwhile project that the Intcrfraternity Council would
do well to consider. In addition to correcting an evil, the Council could
point with pride to some constructive piece of work it has accomplished,
which has been lacking for some time.
