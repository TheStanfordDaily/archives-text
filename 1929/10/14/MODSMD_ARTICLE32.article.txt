# "KEEP OFF THE GRASS"

Students who habitually or occasionally use the landing field of the
Palo Alto School of Aviation for a highway or a footpath will do well
to utilize other routes to and from the campus..
After two or three near-accidents, Lieutenant Norman A. Goddard,
head of the school, has announced that every effort will he made to
cnforce the law which provides a $500 fine for trespassers on landing
fields.
An aviator, putting his plane down on the field, cannot see a consider
able area ahead and below his ship. A pedestrian or an automobilist who
wanders into that "blind spot" finds himself in an extremely hazardous
position. The flyer cannot be expected to avoid something which he is
unable to sec. People forget, also, that an airplane, after it has reached
the ground, cannot he manouvered to miss an object with the ease of a
motor car.
Lieutenant Goddard's stand is well taken. The Palo Alto School of
Aviation has made every effort to provide safe and sane flying instruction
for the students of Stanford University and the citizens of Palo Alto.
An accident would be costly to the persons involved and it would undo
much of the work which Goddard has done to increase this community's
air-mindedness.
Making an example of someone—even at the cost of $500 to that
individual—would be cheaper than a tragedy.
