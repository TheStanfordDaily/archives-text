"The Leland Stanford Game Hunt
ing Expedition" is the name under
which a fu'l-length motion picture has
recently been put on the market and
which may be shown in Palo Alto in
the near future. Did you know that
the University had had a party in the
wilds of Africa? Neither did we. And
it hasn't.
But two years ago—in the winter of
1928, to be specific—Fletcher and
Kenneth Walker, '26 and '27 respec
tively, returned to the Farm from six
months spent chasing wild boars and
elephants alnd rhinoceroses through
the jungles of the Dark Continent.
Motor trucks were used for the total
distance of 3500 miles, and every day
of the trip brought new adventures.
If the camera recorded half the in
cidents which were related by the
Walkers on their return you can b.e
sure that the movie will be worth see
ing. Cameras, by the way, were used
much more than guns for the "shoot
ing." Lions and rhinoceroses provid
ed the major thrills, but elephants,
snakes of all descriptions, and even
a native tribe called the "Mbgubwe"
did their bits to keep the party inter
ested.
Unfortunately for all concerned,
these two Stanford sportsmen met
with an airplane mishap six weeks
ago which turned into tragedy when
Fletcher Walker was found to be
fatally injured. Kenneth Walker,
though seriously hurt, is recovering.

Henry Duffy and his wife, known to
coast theater-goers as Dale Winter,
have made something of a name (and,
we suspect, a respectable income) for
themselves as producers of the first
rank; but Henry would do well to
stay back stage, or even up in the
box office. His place is not before
the footlights.
Duffy and his wife appeared in "The
First Year" in several cities of the
Northwest last month; and, sad to
relate, was not all that had been ex
pected. Both of the leads were dis
tinctly outshone by the minor char
acters. This may have been due in
part to the play itself, which was
weak; but Mr. Duffy is not a skilful
actor. More power to him, however,
as a producer!
Disappointment will be the reaction
of the playgoer who expects to find
in "The Queen Was in the Parlour"
at the Curran Theatre a production
worthy of the reputation of its star,
Pauline Frederick. Indifferent acting,
decidedly amateurish direction, and a
time-worn plot with nothing original
in its treatment to lift it above the
commonplace are the most striking
features of this show.
It is the old, old story of the crown
to an imaginary European kingdom
falling on the head of a woman who
does not want it, but whose tradition
does not permit her to refuse it, al
though its acceptance on the eve of
her marriage to a beloved commoner
means the renunciation of her most
cherished desire. Things do not run
well for the new queen; revolution
threatens, fostered mainly by her repu
tation for having been a trifle uncon
ventional during her previous resi
dence in Paris; and in order to place
the helm of government in strong,
masculine hands, a marriage is ar
ranged between the queen and a
neighboring prince.
The day before the wedding an as
sassin fires at the queen, but his aim
is spoiled by her former fiance. Un
able to resist his charms, the queen
arranges for him to return that night.
In the small hours of the morning
a mob gathers to attack the palace.
The prince rushes to protest his
queen, who makes a very dramatic
personal appearance on a balcony
and sways the mob to her side. Very
strong circumstantial evidence would
point to the fact that the queen was
not the sole occupant of her private
chamber. But, being a very under
standing sort of fellow, the prince
overlooks everything, even when a
report from the bedroom is explained
away as a man shot while trying to
enter the window. With this shot,
which marks the sucide of the
queen's former fiance, the curtain
falls, leaving one convinced of noth
ing but that he has ruined the press
in his pants squirming around in his
seat waiting for the anticipated end
ing.
Miss Frederick does not do herself
justice as the queen. If one were to
classify her solely on her work in
"The Queen Was in the Parlour," one
would be forced to say that she is
decidedly secon(\-rate, obviously an
untruth when one looks over her en
tire successful career.
Gilmor Brown, head mentor of the
Pasadena Community Players, is
credited with the direction. And the
production bears the typical Brown
stamp of amateurishness. Perhaps
here lies the explanation of why Miss
Frederick and the others of her cast
failed to be more convincing.
