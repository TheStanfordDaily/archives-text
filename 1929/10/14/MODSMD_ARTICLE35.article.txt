# "KIBITZER"—GEARY
## 
### 
"Kibitzer," by Jo Swerling and Ed
ward Robinson—if their names mean
anything to you—is supposedly a
"comedy sensation —funny, appealing,"
and fill that, which centers about a
Jewish cigar store keeper and his
financial vicissitudes. It is neither
comical, funny, hor appealing. It is
full of situations and wisecracks that
rival "After Dark" for age. The girl
behind the counter, who happens, of
'course, to be the devoted daughter of
her widower-cigar-store-keeper-father,
is, of course, in love with the soda
clerk at the drug store. The soda
clerk, of course, wants to secure an
option on the drug store; and the girl,
of course,, puts up the money—.and so
on, ad infinitum. And throughout all
three acts protrude, like sore thumbs,
ancient vaudeville jokes, with the
names changed from Taft and Wilson

to Hoover and Smith. And on top of
all this, the action, predictable as it
is, is oil so slow! Practically the whole
lirst act is pinochle-playing.
As for Gregory Ilatoff, who stars as
old I. Lazarus himself, he is not bad
in his way. He reminds one a little of
an Orpheum monologist, but one
could forgive that if it were his only
sin. But imagine our complete aston
ishment when we realized that Laz
arus, the kibitzer, the nosey Jew who
had his hand in everyone's business
but his own, has mastered a rather
good imitation of the Latin accent!
He had the most Italian of Hebrew
accents we have ever heard. Or maybe
it was Mexican. Anyway, it was a long
way from Jewish. Even his shoulder
shruggings called up the image of a
fruit cart rather than a pawn shop.
The cast supporting Ratoff are be
tween mediocre and rotten. Marion
Clayton, as the girl; Charles Postal,
as the boy; Paul Power, as the villain;
and Emmett King, as the wealthy
benefactor, have the other principal
roles and are equally poor, reminding
one of the days of high school plays.
But then, what could a decent actor
do with lines that sound as if they
were written by high school collabo
rates?
Two redeeming features, however,
has "Kibitzer." One is the character
of Yankel, the half-witted brother of
Lazarus, played by Paul Irving.
Through two entire acts Yankel is a
perfect fixture on the stage, sitting in
his black skull cap, knitting inces
santly. Five times in the play he
says "Yes, sure, coitenly!" in a per
fest Hebrew voice, with a perfect
Hebrew accent. The rest of his ac
tion consists of slow and fast knit
ting (which he does well) and of start
ing for the telephone. And the other
redeeming feature of "Kibitzer" is a
period of about ten seconds during the
first act when Lazarus chants one of
those beautiful Hebrew melodies. It
is almost worth the boredom of the
other two hours.
