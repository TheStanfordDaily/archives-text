# TOTEM OF HAWENUS, OLD INDIAN CHIEF, IS GIFT OF DR. WEBSTER
## Leader of the "Fat Stomach" Rescued from Abuse of Generous Enemy 
### 
Dr. David L. Webster, head of the
Physics department, has brought to
his home on the campus the totem
pole of an Indian chief obtained at
Fort Rupert, Canada, first Hudson
Bay trading post, where Dr. Webster
spent the summer. The totem is the
tombstone of Hawenus, chief of a
British Columbia Indian tribe.
According to the legendary tales of
the region, Chief Hawenus once went
to war against a tribe which had
killed his sister and a great festival
was held in the village as the war
party prepared to embark on a two
hundred mile voyage. Kelp from the
beach was beaten, blown up, and
made into necklaces.
As each warrior took his place in
the canoes, he placed his necklace on
his wife. If the kelp necklace burst
during his absence, it would signify
that he had been killed or injured in
hattle. When the men returned with
the heads of seven victims, one man
had been injured; his wife's necklace
had burst, says the story.
Dr. Webster's curio has been re
duced to a bust by the disappearance
of Chief Hawenus' feet, but neverthe
less it stands four feet, six inches
high.
The most impressive feature of the
dead chief in the estimation of his ex
tinct followers was what they termed
the "fat stomach." Figuratively this
refers to his ability to shower his
enemies with presents, but the tomb
stone represents this idea in its most
literal sense.
The figure of Hawenus was given to
Dr. Webster by the chief of a rival
tribe, who was intending to let his
enemy rot where he lay and little ex
pected him to become a Son of the
Stanford Red.
