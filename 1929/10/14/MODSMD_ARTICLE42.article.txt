Painting a picture of a true Chris
tian by citing the example of the man
who, hrving discovered a buried treas
ure, reDuried it, and sold all his pos
sessions to secure enough money to
buy the property where the treasure
lay, that he would rightfully own it,
Dr. Lynn White, professor of sociology
at San Anselmo Theological Semi
nary, delivered the sermon in the
Memorial Church yesterday morning.
"To secure happiness of mind or
to achieve an ambition, one often has
to make great sacrifices, but the ulti
mate joy obtained will recompense
one for the effort expended," said Dr.
White.
Verda Hogan, soprano, sang "Be of
Good Comfort" by Cowen, and the
University Choir sang an anthem,
"Jesus, Joy of Man's Desiring," by
Bach.
Dr. White is well-known here, hav
