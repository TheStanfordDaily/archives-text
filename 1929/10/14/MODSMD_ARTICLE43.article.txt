## 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 13. (/P) â€”The condition
of former Premier Raymond Poincare
today was reported improved to such
extent that physicians expect to per
form the second prostatectomy opera
tion before the end of the month.
The first operation was performed
July 13. The second was postponed
because of a touch of lung congestion.
That congestion has now disappeared.
M. and Mme. Poincare intend to spend
the winter on the Riviera.
