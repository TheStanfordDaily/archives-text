ANGORA, Turkey, Oct. 13. (.#>) —
Mustapha Kemal, who has carried his
people to dizzy heights of religious, po
litical social, and cultural revolutions,
with one of his famous sleights-of-hand
is bringing them down to earth, and is
bidding them work the earth for a solid
fifteen years to come.
Everybody in Turkey, including Ameri
cans and other foreigners who have re
sided in the country for six months, must
do their bit on the building of a great
network of roads, the project for which
has just emerged futl-bloom from the
waves of Kemalist reform.
The new road law provides for 5000
miles of highways in Asiatic Turkey, and
for the renovation of the existing 8000
miles of state roads, most of which are
little more than miserable dirt trails.
Within the whole land there are at pres
ent scarcely a dozen miles of asphalt or
concrete.
But the best of roads are to spread
over Anatolia to the tune of $60,000,000
within the next fifteen years.
