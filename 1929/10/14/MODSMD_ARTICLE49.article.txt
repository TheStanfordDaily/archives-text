# COP SCOFFS AT LOCKOUT Takes Time Writing Ticket CHARGES RECKLESSNESS
## 
### 
At 1:29 Sunday morning two cou
ples in a roadster were speeding up
Palm Drive toward Roble. A siren
moaned behind them. The officer from
a small town a few miles back on
the road started his customary bawl
ing out. The driver asked him for per
mission to take the girls to their hall
before lock-out time. The officer re
fused to believe such a rule existed
in a "wide-open college like Stanford."
He took his own time writing out a
ticket, making it reckless driving just
to show them that the college didn't
run the county. The girls were late.
