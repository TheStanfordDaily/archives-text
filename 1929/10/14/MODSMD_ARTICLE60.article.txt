# High Voltage Line Losses Are Problem For Dr. Ryan
## 
### 
A miniature power line will be
erected close to the Ryan laboratories
in the near future, for the purpose of
testing transmission losses at ex
tremely high voltages. The work is
being done at the request of the Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company. Volt
ages upward of a million volts will
be employed.
Power lines when subjected to high
"pressure" emit a visible corona —a
kind of luminous ring around the
wire. It is the losses due to this phe
nomenon which are to be ascertained.
An interesting feature of the Ryan
laboratory which may be viewed by
anyone is the new apparatus for test
ing high power insulator under all
sorts of artificially simulated weather
conditions. The device stands outside
the building on the north side, and
consists of a power-driven blower, a
hopper, and a wind tunnel. Sand,
mud, and water are fed down the hop
per and projected against the insu
lators at high velocities. The weather
effects of twenty years are obtained
in a few hours. •
