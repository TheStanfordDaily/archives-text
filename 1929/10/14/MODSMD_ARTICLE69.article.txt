### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13. ()P)â€”A re
organization of the Bureau of Educa
tion under which the division hence
forward will conline its activities
largely to research rather than ad
ministration work has been approved
by Secretary Wilbur.
The reorganization, completed by
William J. Cooper, Education Commis
sioner, after a six months' study, will
become effective immediately.
"Under the new organization," an
official statement said today, "its new
policy will be to abandon as far as
possible whatever it has been doing
in an administrative way and to con
centrate upon fact-finding, surveys,
and research in many fields of edu
cation."
