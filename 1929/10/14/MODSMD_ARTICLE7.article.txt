fall track squad was held Friday in
the Old Oval, all men competing in at
least one track and one field event.
Only four events were run off, the
three-lap run.the 352-yard dash, the
high jump, and the broad jump. The
best time of the day was turned in by
Les Hables who ran the 352-yard dash
in 39 seconds flat. Although no indi
vidual made exceptional marks, the
showing of the squad as a whole was
good for so early in the season.

42:2 s.
