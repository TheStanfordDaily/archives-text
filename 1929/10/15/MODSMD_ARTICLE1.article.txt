quest of the Atlantic may be a sequel to
the epoch-making Moscow to America
flight of the plane "Land of the Soviets,"
S. A. Shestakov, commander and chief
pilot of the expedition, revealed today as
preparations were being made to convert
the ship from a sea to a land plane.
Worn out by the thousand-mile flight
from Waterfall, Alaska, to Seattle, dur
ing which their plane buffeted a 35-mile
an-hour head wind, the Russian fliers
were emphatic in their desire to finish
their round the world journey by air in
stead of the more prosaic steamer and
railway route.
Down the Pacific coast the fliers may
be guided by an American mail and pas
senger plane. Operators of the Pacific
Air Transport today suggested that the
soviet airmen follow a regular schedule
plane. The offer had not been acted upon,
and the fliers said they would not definite
ly announce their route for a day or
two. They had planned to reach Califor
nia in one continuous hop, and if they
follow the Pacific Transport plane they
would stay overnight in Portland.
It also was uncertain whether Oakland
or San Francisco would be the Califor
nia objective.
