# GEORGE YOUNG, MEMBER OF ENGLISH DIPLOMATIC CORPS SPEAKER TONIGHT ON LABOR
## Lecture Will Be Delivered In Assembly Hall; Is First of Three 
### 
George Young will bring to a Stan
ford audience tonight a British view
point on a matter of keen interest to
America. He will speak on "Labor
Party Personalities and Policies," a
subject of great importance here
where as yet a powerful labor politi
cal group has yet to be formed.
This lecture, scheduled at 7:150
o'clock in the Assembly Hall, will be
the first of three to be delivered by
the distinguished Englishman. On
Wednesday he will speak on "Post-
War Constitutional Changes in Eu
rope"; and on Thursday, October 17,
on "Command and Freedom of tixe
Seas."
Young served as a diplomatist with
various distinctions for 20 yearsâ€”at
Washington, Athens, Constantinople,
Madrid, Belgrade, and Lisbon. As a
political scholar, Young is noted for
his books: "Portugal, Old and Young,"
"The New Germany," "Egypt," "Con
stantinople," and "Freedom of the
Seas."
His last important work was to act
as head of the Chancery of Lord
Bryce, in Washington, when all out
standing questions between Great
Britain and the United States were
cleared up and a series of treaties
were arranged so that Anglo-American
relations stood the strain of the early
days of the war.
