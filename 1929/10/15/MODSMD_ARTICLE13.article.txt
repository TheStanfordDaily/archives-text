# CAMPUS ENJOYS TEA FELLOWSHIP SERVES ON FIRST AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Many students and professors attended
the Stanford Fellowship tea yesterday
afternoon, the first of the daily teas being
sponsored by the Fellowship Board to
enable professors and students to become
acquainted. It has been suggested by a
Board member that it was time Stanford
started the social gesture of tea; that it
"might soften the edges of the Stanford
rough."
Sylva Weaver, who is in charge of the
plans, will be hostess every day this week.
She was assisted yesterday by Frances
Shoup.
These teas will continue to be held ev
ery afternoon from 4: 30 to 5: 30 on the
third floor of the Women's Clubhouse,
except on Friday, when tea will be served
in the basement. All University members
are invited.
