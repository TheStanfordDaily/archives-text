# SALVAGERS FAIL IN ATTEMPT TO REFLOAT VESSEL
## "Empress of Canada" Hits Reefs; Described as Quietest Shipwreck 
### 
VICTORIA, 8.C., Oct. 14.
tempts to refloat the giant liner Em
press of Canada, impaled on Pinnacle
ltocks at Mclllwaines Point, just south
of Albert Head in the Strait of Juan
de Fuca, near here, failed today when
a fleet of salvage vessels and tugs
were able to jerk the ship only a few
inches at extreme high tide.
The straining tugs were unable to
move the Empress again as she set
tled more firmly than before in the
grasping rocks. The big Canadian
Pacific liner was found to be resting
on the reefs from the bow almost
amidships.
Sharp rocks jutted up through hull
plates. Salvage experts indicated it
would be necessary to blast these out,
patch up the holes in the vessel's bot
tom, and pump out the water in the
forward holds before the ship can be
moved.
Damage to the vessel was estimated
at $250,000 if she can be brought off
in her present condition.
Her grounding in the fog late yes
terday was described by the passen
gers as the "quietest shipwreck that
could have taken place." The ship
came to grief only a few minutes be
fore the end of the voyage from
Southampton, England, where she had
been thoroughly reconditioned.
Luncheon was served aboard for
the passengers before they were
taken off. They were brought to Van
couver today after spending the night
in Victoria.
