# MULLIN, SPEEGLE ARE ELECTED OFFICERS OF RAM'S HEAD SOCIETY
## 
### 
Stanley Mullin was elected presi
dent and Paul Speegle secretary
treasurer at a meeting of Ram's Head
Society yesterday. Both Mullin and
Speegle have been active in Stanford
dramatics during past years.
Ram's Head Society is a men's hon
orary dramatic society whose chief
function is the sponsoring of the Big
Game Gaieties every year. Members
of the society are at present arrang
ing acts for the 1929 vaudeville show
to be given November 22, the night
before the California game.
Several potential entertainers who
have come here from other schools
have been discovered by Ram's Head
committee but other campus talent is
in demand.
Anyone interested in trying out for
the show or in writing any of the acts
is asked to get in touch with Mullin
or Speegle. Satires and burlesques are
especially desirable for this show and
the sooner the plans for skits and dia
logues are submitted the more chance
they have of being accepted.
