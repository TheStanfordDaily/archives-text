# BOOKSTORE WILL OFFER ENLARGED GENERAL LITERATURE DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
A new source of general books, far j
more complete anri on a higher plane j
than anything of its kind that has |
ever existed on the campus, is prom- !
ised in the reorganization of the gen- j
eral hook department of the Stanford !
Bookstore, according to Mrs. Eliza
beth P. Anderson, new head of the
department. "Before the end of the
month, students and faculty will have
access to a reading room and book
shop where they may find a stock of
a variety, quality, and completeness
comparable to that of many of the
finer stores."
Mrs. Anderson comes from New
York, where for seven years she was
in charge of (he I)oubleday-Doran de- j
partment of Lord and Taylor's Book
I Store. Already she has in stock many
of the best quality books obtainable
on the Pacific Coast. A large New
York order is in the process of being 1
filled.
Extensive remodeling of the Book
store will be completed this month.
The office has been moved to the old !

Y.M.C.A. building, and in the vacated
space will be extensive bookcases,
reading tables, lamps, and chairs.
This section of the Bookstore will be
partially cut off from the rest.
"We do not intend to dictate the
reading tastes of students or faculty,"
says Mrs. Anderson. "But we feel that
college students, and professors, too,
would read a better type of book if
they could obtain it more easily. We
intend to have on our shelves books
of lasting value, whether old classics
or new. Anyone can at any time order
any book he wants, and we will sup
ply it. We hope that students and
faculty will drop in often to watch us
grow."
Professor Frederick Anderson of
the Romance Languages department
made this comment in connection with
the new project: "When students are
recommended to get books to supple
ment their courses, they will not need
to search fruitlessly in campus and
Palo Alto bookstores. They will be
able to get what they want close at
home."

"We do not intend to dictate the
reading tastes of students or faculty,"
says Mrs. Anderson. "But we feel that
college students, and professors, too,
would read a better type of book if
they could obtain it more easily. We
intend to have on our shelves books
of lasting value, whether old classics
or new. Anyone can at any time order
any book he wants, and we will sup
ply it. We hope that students and
faculty will drop in often to watch us
grow."
Professor Frederick Anderson of
the Romance Languages department
made this comment in connection with
the new project: "When students are
recommended to get books to supple
ment their courses, they will not need
to search fruitlessly in campus and
Palo Alto bookstores. They will be
able to get what they want close at
home."
A new source of general books, far j
more complete anri on a higher plane j
than anything of its kind that has |
ever existed on the campus, is prom- !
ised in the reorganization of the gen- j
eral hook department of the Stanford !
Bookstore, according to Mrs. Eliza
beth P. Anderson, new head of the
department. "Before the end of the
month, students and faculty will have
access to a reading room and book
shop where they may find a stock of
a variety, quality, and completeness
comparable to that of many of the
finer stores."
Mrs. Anderson comes from New
York, where for seven years she was
in charge of (he I)oubleday-Doran de- j
partment of Lord and Taylor's Book
I Store. Already she has in stock many
of the best quality books obtainable
on the Pacific Coast. A large New
York order is in the process of being 1
filled.
Extensive remodeling of the Book
store will be completed this month.
The office has been moved to the old !

Y.M.C.A. building, and in the vacated
space will be extensive bookcases,
reading tables, lamps, and chairs.
This section of the Bookstore will be
partially cut off from the rest.
