# U.S.C. STRONGER THAN LAST YEAR "POP" REPORTS
## Goofs Practice U.S.C. Plays To Test Defensive Work Of Cardinal Players Simkins, Rothert, Ehrhorn, Preston Give Crutches to Cripples Heiser, Hillman 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Although definitely pointing for U.S.C.
a week from Saturday, Coach Pop War
ner is not overlooking the Oregon State
game here this week-end. A reverse at
the hands of the northern team would
put Stanford completely out of the Con
ference running.
The possibility of a setback is not at
all a mere far-fetched articulation, for
two weeks ago the Trojans got a healthy
sweat up in downing the Staters by a
score of 21 to 7. Incidentally, Pop thinks
that U.S.C. packs an over-amount of po
tency this season.
In fact, to show how much he respects
the team from Troy, Coach Warner spent
a portion of yesterday's practice in con
verting his fourth squad into a miniature
Thundering Herd. This squad will prac
tice U.S.C. plays for the next few days,
and then give the regulars some real
scrimmage sessions before the 26th rolls
around.
Cripples Better
The team is in the best shape it lias
been for a long time now, with four mem
bers of the Cripple Club back in suits
again. Simkins, Rothert, Ehrhorn, and
Preston have all tosed aside their crutch
es, and are now going through their
paces with the rest of the squad. All of
these men, with the possible exception of
Simkins, are expected to see action Sat
urday.
But knee injuries continue to prey upon
Stanford players, and last Saturday two
new pledges were initiated into the crip
ples' association. Pete Heiser, at guard,
received a knee bruise in the Bruin en
counter that may put him on the shelf for
two or three weeks. Ilarry Hillman also
sustained a twisted knee, but is sched
uled to be out for practice again today or
tomorrow.
With the hectic U.C.L.A. touch tackle
contest now a thing of the past, the var
sity got down to some real work yester
day. For about thirty minutes a team
composed of an assortment of first, sec
ond, and third string players scrimmaged
with the Grays. The varsity combination
couldn't seem to get going, and the Grays
smeared up its attempted plays with as
tounding regularity.

scrimmage sessions before the 26th rolls
around.
Cripples Better
The team is in the best shape it lias
been for a long time now, with four mem
bers of the Cripple Club back in suits
again. Simkins, Rothert, Ehrhorn, and
Preston have all tosed aside their crutch
es, and are now going through their
paces with the rest of the squad. All of
these men, with the possible exception of
Simkins, are expected to see action Sat
urday.
But knee injuries continue to prey upon
Stanford players, and last Saturday two
new pledges were initiated into the crip
ples' association. Pete Heiser, at guard,
received a knee bruise in the Bruin en
counter that may put him on the shelf for
two or three weeks. Ilarry Hillman also
sustained a twisted knee, but is sched
uled to be out for practice again today or
tomorrow.
With the hectic U.C.L.A. touch tackle
contest now a thing of the past, the var
sity got down to some real work yester
day. For about thirty minutes a team
composed of an assortment of first, sec
ond, and third string players scrimmaged
with the Grays. The varsity combination
couldn't seem to get going, and the Grays
smeared up its attempted plays with as
tounding regularity.
Although definitely pointing for U.S.C.
a week from Saturday, Coach Pop War
ner is not overlooking the Oregon State
game here this week-end. A reverse at
the hands of the northern team would
put Stanford completely out of the Con
ference running.
The possibility of a setback is not at
all a mere far-fetched articulation, for
two weeks ago the Trojans got a healthy
sweat up in downing the Staters by a
score of 21 to 7. Incidentally, Pop thinks
that U.S.C. packs an over-amount of po
tency this season.
In fact, to show how much he respects
the team from Troy, Coach Warner spent
a portion of yesterday's practice in con
verting his fourth squad into a miniature
Thundering Herd. This squad will prac
tice U.S.C. plays for the next few days,
and then give the regulars some real
scrimmage sessions before the 26th rolls
around.
