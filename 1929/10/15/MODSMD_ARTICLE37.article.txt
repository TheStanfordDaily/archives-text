# SPEEDING TO AVOID LOCK-OUTS IS FLIRTING WITH DEATH
## 
### 
The Daily, yesterday morning, carried an allegedly humorons story
which dealt with the adventures of a quartet of students—male and
female —who came to grief early Sunday morning as they sped up Palm
Drive bent on reaching Roble I Jail before the witching hour of 1:30,
when all good little Stanford girls must be safely locked within the sacred
confines of their dormitories and sorority houses.
The gallant driver, it seems, begged the motorcycle policeman, who
arrested him for speeding, to permit sufficient time to allow the girls to
save themselves a lock-out. The facts that the officer denied the plea and
that he is alleged to have made some typically small-town observations
concerning colleges in general and Stanford in particular, are interesting
but slightly beside the point.
The main point is that there has occurred another example of fast
driving (reckless driving, according to the ticket) brought about by the
mid-Victorian rule that Stanford women must not tread the primrose
path after 1:30. Even at the University of California, reputedly far
behind this citadel of liberality, co-eds are permitted to remain out until
2 o'clock.
It is easy to say that if the college speeder would leave for the campus
early enough, he would not have to break any laws getting there; but the
person who argues in that vein is being logical at the expense of being
human..
As long as hotels in San Francisco maintain their dinner dances until
1 o'clock, Stanford women will be raced up Palm Drive to save them
the horrors of a lockout. No one who sincerely desires to be sympathetic
with youth will deny that it is human for youth to miss not one minute
more of pleasure than is absolutely necessary. Stanford women and their
escorts do some mighty close calculating to satisfy the desire to stay and
to avoid a lockout at the same time. When these calculations go amiss the
only alternative is speed—and speed too often leads to disaster. On at
least three occasions during the past three -years, machines carrying
anxious co-eds have run afoul of palm trees instead of motorcycle cops.
No sensible person will deny that lockout rules are desirable; but by
the same token no sensible person will maintain that it is any more
wicked for a woman student of this University to stay out until 2 o'clock
than until 1:30.
The whole thing is, after all, up to the women concerned. If Stanford
co-eds prefer to race with motorcycle policemen, then let them. Rut if
Stanford co-eds would rather live in the 20th Century than in the Mauve
Decade, and if A.W.S. self-government is something more than a theory,
then let them act.
