# IF STANFORD CANNOT GO TO NEW YORK TO BOX, MEET THE CADETS HERE
## 
### 
Negotiations between Stanford and the United States Military Aca
demy at West Point are being conducted to arrange a boxing tournament
between the two schools. The proposed calls for the Cadet squad of
seven boxers to accompany their football players on their pilgrimage to
the Coast and to have the matches the night before the Stanford-Army
game.
Such a plan merits hearty approval. The success of this kind of a
venture is practically assured by the general interest manifested in college
boxing tournaments. With the Army boxers as a drawing card, there
should be no difficulty in filling the Pavilion.. As long as the Army is
treking out to the Coast with a large squad of football players, the
additional expense of bringing the boxing squad would not be as great
as transporting the entire Corps, which was done when the West Pointers
played in Chicago two years ago.
The Stanford boxing team was cheated out of participating in the
Intercollegiate Tournament in New York last spring through the falla
cious arguments advanced by the Physical Education Department, which
failed to realize that boxing ranks as high in athletic circles as any other
sport. The Cards have a well-balanced team this year and their chances
for meeting a well-known opponent such as West Point should not be
muffed. It is hoped that the Cadets will see their way clear to accept
Stanford's challenge.
