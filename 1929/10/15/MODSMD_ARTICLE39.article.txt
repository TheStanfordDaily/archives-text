# "EAT, SING, AND BE MERRY"
## 
### 
Before long Stanford rooting sections will be called upon to sing
various songs at football games. Next to organized cheering, group sing
ing is one of the most impressive demonstrations of the rooting section.
In order to be fully etlective the words should be distinguishable to the
stadium crowds.
Stanford does not hold song rallies as some colleges do, but a better
way of brushing up on the words and music would be for each eating
group to spend a few minutes each evening singing the dear old alma
mater songs and the snappy football ditties. Freshman class meetings
could be terminated with a song fest.
With a few such practice sessions by small groups, the standard of
singing will be equal to Stanford's skill in cheering and on the field.
