# Los Angeles Extends City Limits; Puts Up New Sign
## 
### 
NORTH LOS ANGELES, Oct. 15.
(/I 5 ) â€”Yes, the jokes made about the
Los Angeles city limits have truth in
them.
Until the other day this little com
munity struggled along with the sign
"Zelzah, 33 Mi. to Los Angeles," on
its railroad station. Then Mayor John
O. Porter and other Los Angeles of
ficials came out, took down the sign,
and put up a new one reading "North
Los Angeles." Roy Scouts and Legion
naires had a part in the ceremonies.
