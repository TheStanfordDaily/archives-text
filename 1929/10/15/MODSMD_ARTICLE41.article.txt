If Jeanne Eagels hadn't died, we
might never have seen "Jealousy."
But she did, and so we went to San
Jose. Only this solemn pilgrimage
could have persuaded us to take such
a step. But "Jealousy" is playing there
this week. It is your last chance to
see this radiant little actress.
If you missed her magnificently re
strained performance as Sadie Thomp
son in that great play, "Rain," a talk
ing picture appearance will be your
only memory of a frail genius of the
modern theatre. Jeanne Eagels had
a nervous intensity which makes her
acting unforgettable.
You see it in "Jealousy." As the
Wife with a Past, Miss Eagels is the
Eternal Feminine on trial. Caught in
the merciless web of circumstance,
she is forced to evade her suspicious
young husband's piercing inquiries
while maintaining her relations with
an elderly financier whose gold is the
price of his conquests.
In all this Miss Eagels is superb.
How sad that "alcoholic pyschosis"
should have cut short the years that
the temperamental Jeanne Eagels was
giving to the American stage!
And since you don't like moralizing,
we turn to Frederic March. This dark
ly handsome young actor (who paro
died John Barrymore so well in "The
Royal Family" which was here a year
ago) gave a finished performance as
the deeply jealous husband of Yvonne.
That a two-character stage novelty
becomes extended somewhat is forgiv
able, if typical, of Hollywood. Only a
somewhat obvious Boob Luller scene
backstage in the lingerie department
of a swell ladies' shop remains to
show exactly where the production
came from.
Otherwise, "Jealousy" is about as
good on the screen as it was on the
stage—which usually can be said of

only the versions of the most utterly
worthless footlight trash.
Jeanne Eagels is better than "Jeal
ousy"—but not much. And Frederic
March is able support. You will not
forget the ending.
—George Spelvin.
"The Greene Murder Case" — New
Stanford.
It's just a case of the survival of the
fittest in the quaint old Greene home. Ev
ery time the audience decides on the
murderer another member of the family
bites the dust, and then one has to start
supposing all over again.
Philo Vance, the suave detective im
personated by William Powell, thrives on
dirty deeds, however, so one feels assured
that someone will be ground under the
wheels of justice. The story has been
produced in excellent taste. Here is a real
mystery without the customary clutching
hands, comical maids, and innocent hero
ine.
Not until the last few minutes does one
find out who has been making so free
with the death-dealing "32." It seems
that Mother Greene and her sons and
daughters are a headstrong, unsociable lot
compelled to live under one roof for five
more years if they wish to share equally
in the fortune papa piled up by devious
means.
Association breeding more than con
tempt, one of the inhabitants of the house
decides to put the rival heirs out of the
running and thereby hangs the murders.
If you like a good mystery you'll enjoy
"The Greene Murder Case," but if you've
already read the book you'll know just
what's going to happen.
Jean Arthur and Florence Eldridge are
attractive newcomers to the talking
screen. They are pretty, use their voices
well, and will be welcome any time they
care to act for us.

strained performance as Sadie Thomp
son in that great play, "Rain," a talk
ing picture appearance will be your
only memory of a frail genius of the
modern theatre. Jeanne Eagels had
a nervous intensity which makes her
acting unforgettable.
You see it in "Jealousy." As the
Wife with a Past, Miss Eagels is the
Eternal Feminine on trial. Caught in
the merciless web of circumstance,
she is forced to evade her suspicious
young husband's piercing inquiries
while maintaining her relations with
an elderly financier whose gold is the
price of his conquests.
In all this Miss Eagels is superb.
How sad that "alcoholic pyschosis"
should have cut short the years that
the temperamental Jeanne Eagels was
giving to the American stage!
And since you don't like moralizing,
we turn to Frederic March. This dark
ly handsome young actor (who paro
died John Barrymore so well in "The
Royal Family" which was here a year
ago) gave a finished performance as
the deeply jealous husband of Yvonne.
That a two-character stage novelty
becomes extended somewhat is forgiv
able, if typical, of Hollywood. Only a
somewhat obvious Boob Luller scene
backstage in the lingerie department
of a swell ladies' shop remains to
show exactly where the production
came from.
Otherwise, "Jealousy" is about as
good on the screen as it was on the
stage—which usually can be said of

only the versions of the most utterly
worthless footlight trash.
Jeanne Eagels is better than "Jeal
ousy"—but not much. And Frederic
March is able support. You will not
forget the ending.

"The Greene Murder Case" — New
Stanford.
It's just a case of the survival of the
fittest in the quaint old Greene home. Ev
ery time the audience decides on the
murderer another member of the family
bites the dust, and then one has to start
supposing all over again.
Philo Vance, the suave detective im
personated by William Powell, thrives on
dirty deeds, however, so one feels assured
that someone will be ground under the
wheels of justice. The story has been
produced in excellent taste. Here is a real
mystery without the customary clutching
hands, comical maids, and innocent hero
ine.
Not until the last few minutes does one
find out who has been making so free
with the death-dealing "32." It seems
that Mother Greene and her sons and
daughters are a headstrong, unsociable lot
compelled to live under one roof for five
more years if they wish to share equally
in the fortune papa piled up by devious
means.
Association breeding more than con
tempt, one of the inhabitants of the house
decides to put the rival heirs out of the
running and thereby hangs the murders.
If you like a good mystery you'll enjoy
"The Greene Murder Case," but if you've
already read the book you'll know just
what's going to happen.
Jean Arthur and Florence Eldridge are
attractive newcomers to the talking
screen. They are pretty, use their voices
well, and will be welcome any time they
care to act for us.

If Jeanne Eagels hadn't died, we

this week. It is your last chance to
