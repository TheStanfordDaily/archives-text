# HUSKY HUNT STRIVING TO BOLSTER DEFENSE OF BABE GRID SQUAD
## Frosh Football Coach Aims For Improvement of Aerial Offensive 
### 
Still somewhat bewildered by the
13-0 defeat administered them by the
Santa Clara frosh last Saturday, the
Stanford yearlings went through a
rather listless practice session last
night. Beyond a doubt., last week's
game demonstrated that the frosh
have bolstered their defensive play
ing, and Coach "Husky" Hunt is now
working to improve the babes' of
fense in preparation for the contest
with the U.S.C. freshmen next Satur
day at Los Angeles.
The baby Redshlrts looked particu
larly weak on aerial play against the
Broncos. Over half the passes attempt
ed by the Card backs were inter
cepted and converted into substantial
gains by the Santa Clara players.
Last night Hunt spent the greater
part of the practice period drilling
the frosh on forward and lateral pass
plays.
Despite the poor playing of the
team as a whole last week, a few men
put on some nice demonstrations.
Bill Artman, former quarterback who
has been converted into a tackle,
played a fine game in the line, con
sistently making good tackles and
showing a good drive on the offensive.
Thorny Rogers, half, and Wes Ste
vens, fullback, bore the brunt of the
Cardinal attack, and the former dis
tinguished himself as one of the hard
est tacklers on the field.
