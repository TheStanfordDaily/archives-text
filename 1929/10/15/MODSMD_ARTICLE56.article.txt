VENI VIDI ViCI?
When Pop packed his toothbrush
away and left for the Northwoods last
Thursday, a lot of wise birds began
squawking and croaking as though
his departure were some evil omen.
They took it for granted that Satur
day's game would be a repetition of
the awful Santa Clara mishap not so
long ago. The Cards would be helpless
without the touch of their master's
hand.
But just as soon as the U.C.L.A.
score was made public, the squawks
died out completely. The wise birds,
it seems, became tongue-tied.
For Pop's sight-seeing expedi
tion turned out to be a huge suc
cess. First, the team proved that
it can play fair ball, even when
the Old Fox isn't dropping cigar
ette ashes in the water bucket.
And second, Pop found out about
twice as much as he went North
to discover.
What an eyeful he got!
He saw Washington outplay the
Thundering Herd for live minutes, dis
playing a great potential strength. He
saw a penalty and an official's deci
sion prevent the Huskies from cross
ing the goal line for an almost sure
touchdown. And then he witnessed
one of the greatest stampedes that
has ever taken place in the North
west. The Huskies proved to be tooth
less mongrels during the remaining
fifty-five minutes of play.
"U.S.C. is stronger than ever!"
Pop said so himself yesterday
morning in telling of his Seattle
scouting jaunt. And if anyone is
qualified to make such a state
ment it is Mr. Glenn Scobey War
ner. He has seen enough of Coach

Jones' boys in action during his
career at Stanford to know.
Moreover, Pop wasn't kidding a bit
when he added that Stanford will
have to play her best brand of ball
on the 26th, or go down to defeat.
For, according to the Old Fox, the
Trojans have more power in their
running plays and a much more diver
sified attack than last season. Last
year they weren't so soft, as followers
of the Cardinal will well remember, so
one can just imagine how good Troy
is now.
Continuing his brief discourse,
Coach Warner let it be known that
U.S.C. has about the best reserve
strength he has ever seen. The Tro
jans have an unlimited number of
good substitutes —the kind that don't
weaken the lineup in the least. In
fact, many of Jones' so-called second
string men look as strong or even
better than his regulars.
So much for Pop's impressions.
The large score piled up by the
Southern team alone proves that
they are exceptional. Any outfit
that can put over seven touch
downs on any Husky team is out
standing, for Washington is al
ways a sticker on her own rock
bound field.
The Trojans are apparently all that
they were cracked up to be before the
season began. The Los Angeles Cham
ber of Commerce blurb artists let a
secret out at that time to the effect
that Coach Howard Jones had THE
team to beat. And for once the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce was
right.
Stanford is going to have one
tough struggle on the 26th!
At any rate, Pop went and Pop
saw. Now all that remains is for
Pop to conquer.

Moreover, Pop wasn't kidding a bit
when he added that Stanford will
have to play her best brand of ball
on the 26th, or go down to defeat.
For, according to the Old Fox, the
Trojans have more power in their
running plays and a much more diver
sified attack than last season. Last
year they weren't so soft, as followers
of the Cardinal will well remember, so
one can just imagine how good Troy
is now.
Continuing his brief discourse,
Coach Warner let it be known that
U.S.C. has about the best reserve
strength he has ever seen. The Tro
jans have an unlimited number of
good substitutes —the kind that don't
weaken the lineup in the least. In
fact, many of Jones' so-called second
string men look as strong or even
better than his regulars.
So much for Pop's impressions.
The large score piled up by the
Southern team alone proves that
they are exceptional. Any outfit
that can put over seven touch
downs on any Husky team is out
standing, for Washington is al
ways a sticker on her own rock
bound field.
The Trojans are apparently all that
they were cracked up to be before the
season began. The Los Angeles Cham
ber of Commerce blurb artists let a
secret out at that time to the effect
that Coach Howard Jones had THE
team to beat. And for once the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce was
right.
Stanford is going to have one
tough struggle on the 26th!
At any rate, Pop went and Pop
saw. Now all that remains is for
Pop to conquer.

VENI VIDI ViCI?
When Pop packed his toothbrush
away and left for the Northwoods last
Thursday, a lot of wise birds began
squawking and croaking as though
his departure were some evil omen.
They took it for granted that Satur
day's game would be a repetition of
the awful Santa Clara mishap not so
long ago. The Cards would be helpless
without the touch of their master's
hand.
But just as soon as the U.C.L.A.
score was made public, the squawks
died out completely. The wise birds,
it seems, became tongue-tied.
For Pop's sight-seeing expedi
tion turned out to be a huge suc
cess. First, the team proved that
it can play fair ball, even when
the Old Fox isn't dropping cigar
ette ashes in the water bucket.
And second, Pop found out about
twice as much as he went North
to discover.
What an eyeful he got!
He saw Washington outplay the
Thundering Herd for live minutes, dis
playing a great potential strength. He
saw a penalty and an official's deci
sion prevent the Huskies from cross
ing the goal line for an almost sure
touchdown. And then he witnessed
one of the greatest stampedes that
has ever taken place in the North
west. The Huskies proved to be tooth
less mongrels during the remaining
fifty-five minutes of play.
"U.S.C. is stronger than ever!"
Pop said so himself yesterday
morning in telling of his Seattle
scouting jaunt. And if anyone is
qualified to make such a state
ment it is Mr. Glenn Scobey War
ner. He has seen enough of Coach

Jones' boys in action during his
career at Stanford to know.
