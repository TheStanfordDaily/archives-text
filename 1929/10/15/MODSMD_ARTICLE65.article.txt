SHANGHAI, Oct. 14. (JP) —Famine
conditions in China are rapidly grow
ing worse, according to recent reports
received in Shanghai from the north
ern provinces where for many months
hundreds have been dying daily of
starvation. No relief from natural
causes is expected before next spring.
The Province of Shensi is probably
the worst sufferer. All 92 districts are
said to be in the grip of slow death
while in towns and villages bodies
lie in the streets. Whole villages
have been depopulated by death or
desertion of homes while the sur
rounding country is as bare of vege
tation as a desert. Drought, one of
the longest in China's lengthy history,
has kept arid for four or five years
fields which formerly were known as
among the most fertile in the country.
In the city of Sianfu, Shensi Prov
ince, 12 concentration camps have
been opened and 19 relief stations are
operating day and night. The bread
lines are so long it sometimes takes
two days or more for all the persons
to pass in front of the station and re
ceive one scanty ration apiece.
