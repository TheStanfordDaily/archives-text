# RALLY GROUP ORDERS BAN ON POMPOMS AND BALLOONS FOR WOMEN

No more pompoms or balloons for

probability of injury caused by wav
ing pompoms was too great to war
rant having them at games.

of a reception committee to greet
visiting teams. Members of the com
mittee will be appointed next week.
Jean Utt was selected to have charge
of ordering white sweaters for all wo
men members of the rally committee.
The rooting section at the Oregon
game will be outlined in red bunting.
Roos Brothers has offered to donate
megaphones for use in the U.S.C.
game.
Stunt suggestions were discussed
for the Trojan and California games.
The contest for U.S.C. stunts closes
at 5 o'clock this afternoon while the
deadline for Big Game stunts will be
Sunday, October 20. Prizes of ten dol
lars have been offered for the best
stunt submitted for each game. The
best yell turned in before 5 o'clock
on November 9 will win a prize of
five dollars.
