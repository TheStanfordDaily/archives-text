Answer: The makers of Tlios. Heath have adhered,
through the years, to a certain well-defined policy—
the policy of making extraordinarily fine clothes for
a moderale consideration. Almost, one would say they
are a little old-fashioned in their attitude. They are
concerned, of course, with how much they can get for
Some particularly |j lc j r c l o tJ ies . But they are even more concerned with
sightly cloths at
how much hand work, personal supervision, and
o<3 endless fussing with details they can put into them.
