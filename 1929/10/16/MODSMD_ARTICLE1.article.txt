# BRITAINREACTING TO INDIVIDUALISM DECLARES YOUNG
## Party Success Will Depend On Character of Leader; Cites Ramsay Mac Donald Discourse Tonight to Cover Constitutional Changes in Europe Since Great War 
### 
George Young, British diplo
matist and journalist, will deliver
the second lecture of his present
series, "Post War Constitutional
Changes in Europe," in the Little
Theatre tonight at 7:30 o'clock.
"The British Labor Party realizes
that, in the last century, the pendu
lum has gone too far in the direction
of individualism, and must necessar
ily swing back to socialism. It is
profiting by this pendulum swing,"
George Young, noted British diplomat,
declared in his lecture last night on
"Labor Party Personalities and Poli
cies."
Britons Favor Cause
"Not only does the British elector
ate accept the party cause, knowing
that socialism is not revolutionary—
all states were socialistic until 250
years ago—but the people feel that
the organization is a party with a
code, and a code in which they be
lieve.
"By helping and forwarding the
economic evolution of the past cen
tury, which is due to continue for
another century," stated Young, "the
Labor Party can bring prosperity to
England three or four times as quick
ly as some other party with a less
forwarding policy."
A Personal Government
On the character and composition
of a party depends its prospects of
success in solving present problems.
The leader of the British Labor Party,
Premier Ramsay Mac Donald, and his
position grow in importance continu
ally, the speaker declared. "The ten
dency towards personal government
develops more and more; general
elections in Britain today are becom
ing premier-elections, much like the
American presidential elections.
"Mac Donald is the Scottish chief
tain, with the British peoples, as fol
lowers, his clansmen. He is artistic,
a parliamentarian, pure and simple—
though much purer than simple. His
courage and constancy in politics
have placed his position the highest
since Gladstone."
