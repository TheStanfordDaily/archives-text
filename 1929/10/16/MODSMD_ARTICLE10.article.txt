# VARSITY SOCCER MEN WILL BATTLE ROVER TEAM HERE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer squad was
materially strengthened yesterday
when George Eberhardt, star wing of
the 1928 team, and Bill Toepke, for
mer high-school player, showed up for
the first time at afternoon practice.
Eberhardt needs no introduction to
Stanford soccer fans. Toepke, who
was a backfield ace on the freshman
football team last fall, will make one
of the regulars hustle for a steady
berth. He is a hard and accurate
kicker as well as being shifty and
fast.
The Rover game this Saturday will
give Coach Harry Maloney plenty of
opportunity to see how his men per
form when playing against a real
team. The Rovers, by virtue of win
ning the B division of San Francisco
soccer circles last season, have been
automatically advanced to the Senior
league. In their first two games in
the major circuit, the Rovers have
held the Olympic Club and the Bar
barians to tie scores, both contests
ending in a 1-1 count.
