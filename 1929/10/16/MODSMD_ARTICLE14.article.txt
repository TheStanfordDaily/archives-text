# ALL CLASSES ADVISED TO SELECT MANAGERS FOR TOUCH FOOTBALL
## 
### 
Coach Murray Cuddeback, director
of interclass touch football this fall,
urges all classes, including the medi
cal students, to select managers for
their respective teams.
It is important that managers be
appointed immediately, as the first
two games will be played Monday
afternoon. This allows at the most
only five days for selection of teams
and practicing.
The rules for touch football, which
is replacing American football in in
terclass competition this year, will be
similar to those of the regular game,
with the following exceptions: (1)
The defense must remain one yard
or more behind the line of scrimmage.
(2) Any man on the offense is eligible
for a pass. (2) Clipping is prohibited.
(4) The man carrying the ball must
be touched by both hands of a de
fensive player to be stopped. (5) The
eleven men on each team may be
placed anywhere in their own terri
tory. It will not be necessary to main
tain a seven-man line.
