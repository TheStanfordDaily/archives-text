# Disapproval Of Fraternities In U.S. Universities Voiced By George Young
## 
### 
"The thing about which I feel the
most doubt in the American universi
ties is the fraternity system." George
Young, British scholar, diplomat, and
journalist, was expressing some of his
impressions of the universities in the
United States, in an interview yester
day."It seems to introduce that which
is least wanted, a clan system in so
cial relations."
He continued by saying that in Eng
j land, the same thing results because
j of the system of cheap colleges and
j exclusive ones, which erect barriers
| between the students of the different
I schools much the same as do the fra
ternities In American institutions of
learning. However, the distinguished
Englishman said that those barriers
are being removed rapidly in the Eng
lish colleges. The colleges that were
formerly the most exclusive are de
liberately taking in poor men as stu
dents and no distinctions are drawn

between them and the sons of dukes
and earls.
When questioned on his opinion of
the League of Nations, Young said
that he believed the League would die
if the United States did not join it.
He said that the League was an in
stitution representing governments,
and not the people of the various
lands, as Wilson had planned. Young
also believes that the United States
did a good thing in not joining the
| League when it was founded. He be
i lieves that we are now in a position
j to make demands that will greatly im
prove the working of the League as
conditions to our joining, if we join
at all.
Young would express no views on
the recent Hoover-MacDonald confer
ence. He will lecture on "Command
! and Freedom of the Seas" in the last
j of his series of talks here, however,
! and may give some of his opinions on
I the conference at that time.
