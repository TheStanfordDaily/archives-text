###

time the last of the trolleys will leave

at 6:25 Monday morning bus service

Highway Needs Space
The street car tracks are being re
moved on account of the improve
ment of the state highway between
Mayfield and Palo Alto. The street
car tracks constituted a definite block
ade to the improvement and it was
decided to remove them entirely. To
have moved them to adjacent proper
ty would have cost more than the
total valuation of the Railroad Com
pany.
Whether to charge six cents, the
former street car fare to the campus,
or ten cents, which is the fare now
being charged on Palo Alto busses,
will be decided by the commission
within the next few days. Six cents
will probably be charged since it is
planned to follow as closely as pos
sible the street car service which is
being discontinued.
The old street car tracks will be
left in place until the University au
thorities decide about improvement
plans on the highway between the
campus and Palo Alto.
