# Freshman Soccer Eleven Will Meet San Mateo J.C.
## 
### 
With but a very small number of
experienced men, the freshman soccer
squad will clash with the San Mateo
Junior College eleven this afternoon
on the Stanford soccer field in their
first game of the conference. The San
Mateo team has all the advantages as
they are experienced men and have
always put up a good showing, so the
frosh have their job cut out for them
in holding down the score.
The following Tuesday the babes
will meet the Pescadero high school
team on the home field. Although only
a high-school team, they thoroughly
trounced the freshmen last year and
the frosh will have to be on their
guard to prevent a repetition.
