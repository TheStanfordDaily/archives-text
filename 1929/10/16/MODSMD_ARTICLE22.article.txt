# 'POP' HARRIS STAYS THOUGH STREET CAR SERVICE WILL STOP
## 
### 
"Stay here!"
Pop Harris, veteran bootblack
at the Stanford terminal of the
Toonerville trolley, made that
emphatic answer when queried
as to his plans after the street
car service from Palo Alto is
stopped.
Pop, who has polished the
boots of Stanfordites for eleven
years, has seen many students
come and go. Business has
dropped to one-fourth of what it
used to be, he says. Automobiles
are to blame.
"And students are a lot quieter
now," asserts Pop. "They used
to be a lot wilder and noisier.
And on Hallowe'en, you darsn't
stick out your head!"
