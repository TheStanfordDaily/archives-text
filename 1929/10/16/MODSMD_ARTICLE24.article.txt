# DR. BERTHA DYMENT TO ADDRESS WOMEN ON MEDICAL SERVICE
## 
### 
"Stanford Health Service for Wo
men" will be the topic of Dr. Bertha
Dyment's talk at the women's assem
bly to be held in the Women's Club
house at 7:15 this evening.
Plans for a possible all-day voca
tional conference, at which women
prominent in various occupations and j
professions would speak of their work
and answer questions, will be brought
before the women. The date for such
a conference would probably be set
sometime early next quarter, and the
vocations to be represented would be
those preferred by the women here.
The question of reorganization of the
Stanford Women's Glee Club will be
discussed. Many of last year's mem
bers have graduated and new mem
bers are needed, according to Dorothy
Bogen, who is president of the Glee
Club.
An A.W.S. treasurer's report, which
will explain the amount of funds, their
derivation, and their expenditure, will
be made by Bertha Wise. The chair
men of the standing committees of
Women's Student Conference are to
tell shortly the duties and plans of
their respective executive groups.
