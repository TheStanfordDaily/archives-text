# CARDINALS DRILL ON DEFENSE FOR TROJAN CONTEST
## Fourth String Eleven, Using U.S.C. Plays, Stopped Cold By Fast-Charging Linemen Ray Dawson Slated to Start At Guard Against Oregon State in Place of Heiser 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Perfection of a Cardinal defense
capable of messing np U.S.C.'s power
ful running attack seems to be the
chief concern of Coach Pop Warner
these days, although at the same time
he is preparing his team for the Ore
gon State game here on Saturday.
In fact, yesterday afternoon the Old
Fox held a short experimental scrim
mage to see just how his charges
would act against a small edition of
the famous Trojan shift. For about
twenty minutes the fourth squad,
representing Coach Jones' outfit,
packed the ball a la Thundering Herd
style.
Defense Looks Good
If yesterday's practice is any indi
cation, the Trojans will have to play
super-ball to get very far, for the first
and second-string players had a great
time smearing "Saunders" Marks,
"Musick" Allen, and other Herd mem
bers for fair-sized losses. Put then, it
is to be remembered that U.S.C. works
this same shift potently and effec
tively.
Instead of reporting in suit as ex
pected, Harry Hillman spent yester
day's workout in hobbling around the
field on crutches. It is more than like
ly that Hillman will view the Oregon
State game from the bench. Pete
Heiser, who twisted his knee in the
U.C.L.A. contest, has not showed up
from Los Angeles as yet.
Dawson at Guard
As Heiser is definitely out of Satur
day's lineup, Ray Dawson is scheduled
to start at his guard position. The
loss of Heiser will not affect Stan
ford's chances to any extent, as his
understudy has been playing a hard
smashing game of late.
Warner's line has its work cut out
on Saturday, though, and will have to
show a big improvement over its play
ing against the Bruins. The so-called
green forward wall of Oregon State
played a whale of a game down at the
Coliseum two weeks ago. As a conse
quence, the Thundering Herd was
forced to resort to an aerial attack
to score fourteen of its twenty-one
points.
