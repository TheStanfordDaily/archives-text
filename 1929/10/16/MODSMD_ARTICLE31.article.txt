# ELIMINATE PARKING MAZES
## 
### 
In the Psychology Department rats are made to run through mazes
in order to test their speed in learning the correct route. Human subjects
for a similar experiment are available every day at the Library parking
area opposite the Engineering corner. Anyone trying to drive a car in
or out of the lot experiences the same difficulties that the rats do in
their maze. The rats soon learn the way, but the parking place presents
a new problem for students daily.
Automobiles are jammed into the parking place without regard for
entrance or exit routes. The resulting maze is often impossible to master
because some vehicle blocks the way, and the only thing to do is wait for
it to be removed.
That Stanford minds are able to handle difficult traffic situations is
proved by the effective parking and routing methods used to cope with
football game crowds. That being the case, this comparatively simple
problem should be solved immediately.
If the proper authorities mark a few white lines to indicate the posi
tions of autos, students will be glad to remain within bounds. Then they
will at least be on a par with the rats.
