# ORIENTING THE WOMEN
## 
### 
Tonight the five hundred will meet in an assembly to hear the heads
of the A.W.S. committees describe the work which they are planning for
the year, and to learn from Dr. Dyment, the new medical adviser of
women, something of the health service for women at Stanford.
Because of the small number of women, an excellent opportunity is
offered for participation of the entire group in the activities of the Asso
ciated Women Students. Both in carrying out its government and in the
varied program it undertakes, Stanford's A.W.S. is far ahead of most
universities.
However, there are some students who feel little connection with their
self-government because they do not know what is going on. The aim
of the assembly tonight is to give to the new women, as well as to those
who have not been intimately connected with A.W.S. administration, an
idea of the nature of the work done by the committees and how this co
ordinates with the executive, legislative, and judicial sides of A.W.S.
