Hans Frost, by Hugh Walpole. (Dou
bleday Doran and Company, Pub
lishers. New York. 1929.)
"Most gentlemen," said Hans Frost,
"are liars."
When Hans Frost makes this state
ment, he is seventy years old, and
esteemed the greatest living writer
of England. But for the first time in
his life he is looking squarely at him
self, and at the people around him,
and he is forced to admit that he too
belongs under this generality.
"I've been living all the wrong kind
of life," he confessed —"submitting to
other people out of laziness, just pass
ing into corruption in an armchair.
I'm going to lead my own life from
now on. I shan't care a damn for any
body, and I'll die in a ditch with a
bottle of whisky in my hand and net
tles in my hair, and the worms will
eat me, .... l)o you know what would
have happened otherwise? I'd have
died in my bed, and there'd have been
three doctors, oxygen in a bag, and
rows of medicine bottles. My wife
would have closed my eyes, my
mother-in-law would have danced the
saraband.
"I sacrificed my life for a ceremony
that has always bored me to death,
for people who are less than shadows
to me, for a convention that is a
gilded sham. I've been playing blind
man's buff for seventy years."
The above passage holds the essence
of Hugh Walpole's latest novel, Hans
Frost, which is the story of a literary
figure (entirely mythical) who wakes
up in time to make a last bid for lib
erty and happiness, after he has been
choked for years by the cotton-wool
of fame, security, and luxury.
Even so short a passage leaves no
doubt that Hugh Walpole has lost
none of his characteristic exuberance
of style. As in the previous novels
that made him so popular both in
England and America, Hans Frost is
alive with striking, almost crudely
vital passages, intensely sincere,
warm, and human. But besides re
taining all of his old qualities, the
author reveals certain surprising new
ones, among them a brilliant and un
guessed capacity for sophistication.
Walpole readers will probably re
vise their habit of not thinking of him
as sophisticated, for here he has un
dertaken a difficult and subtle experi
ment, which only a sophisticated mind
and insight could carry through suc
cessfully. He has made love the basis
and excuse for his book, but it is none
of the ordinary kinds of love, nor even
Platonic love. Under his pen is de
veloped a relationship between an old
man of seventy, and his lovely, sensi
tive, young niece that is a delicate
and rather perfect thing.
The swift movement of the story
will likewise prove an agreeable sur
prise to Walpole readers. For sheer
readability, Hans Frost surpasses all

of the well-known author's work.
However, the characterizations are
the chief delight of the book. The
"Grand Old Man of English Letters"
is, of course, supebrb, while the por
trait of Ruth, his wife, is at times
even more brilliant. She both fasci
nates and repels the reader, and is
never fully understood. Her selfish
nesß and her hardness make her al
most a jarring note in a beautiful,
significant story such as this is. But
if she seems at first too brittle, too
limited, to belong to the rest of the
novel, it is apparent later than these
very qualities only emphasize the
power and truth exemplified in Hans
Frost's nature. —M. L. R.
Partners in Crime, by Agatha Christie.
(Dodd, Meade and Co., Publish
ers. New York. 1929.)
The trouble with most detective
stories is that the author takes him
self too seriously. Agatha Christie's
latest book proves an exception to
this, as do most of her other stories.
In "Partners in Crime," while none of
the thrills are lost, Miss Christie
seems to be delicately laughing up
her sleeve. They are all there —mur-
ders, robberies, abductions; ar.d the
plots are all carefully worked out. But
through them all runs a slight vein
of humor.
A novel form of presentation has
been used. A young couple find them
selves at the head of an international
detective agency. They are the man
agers, the detectives, and the secre
taries of "Blunt's Brilliant Detectives."
How they solve various cases, with
the help of Scotland Yard, is told.
The funny part is the way in which
Tomp and Tuppence, the couple, at
tack various cases. When the case
presented seems to be one of the
Conan Doyle variety, they immediate
ly become Sherlock and his faithful
Watson; another time, and they are
Herek Ponet and Hastings with the
"little grey cells."
A reason for Miss Christie's slightly
satirical air, may be that she is an
American, who having lived a long
time in England, writes entirely of
English life. But her plots are reason
able, her style simple and expressive,
and her stories quite exciting.
One thing authors would do well to
get over is their habit of making the
characters say in surprise, "This is
just like a book." Of course it is, it
is a book. Consequently it becomes
a trifle tiresome to hear the refrain
all through "Partners in Crime" that
"it sounds just like a regular detec
tive story!"
Miss Christie's book, for a detec
tive story, is really excellent. Too
many such stories are badly written
and poorly put together. If you want a
few hours of easy reading and also
enjoyment, by all means read "Part
ners in Crime."

Partners in Crime, by Agatha Christie.
(Dodd, Meade and Co., Publish
ers. New York. 1929.)
The trouble with most detective
stories is that the author takes him
self too seriously. Agatha Christie's
latest book proves an exception to
this, as do most of her other stories.
In "Partners in Crime," while none of
the thrills are lost, Miss Christie
seems to be delicately laughing up
her sleeve. They are all there —mur-
ders, robberies, abductions; ar.d the
plots are all carefully worked out. But
through them all runs a slight vein
of humor.
A novel form of presentation has
been used. A young couple find them
selves at the head of an international
detective agency. They are the man
agers, the detectives, and the secre
taries of "Blunt's Brilliant Detectives."
How they solve various cases, with
the help of Scotland Yard, is told.
The funny part is the way in which
Tomp and Tuppence, the couple, at
tack various cases. When the case
presented seems to be one of the
Conan Doyle variety, they immediate
ly become Sherlock and his faithful
Watson; another time, and they are
Herek Ponet and Hastings with the
"little grey cells."
A reason for Miss Christie's slightly
satirical air, may be that she is an
American, who having lived a long
time in England, writes entirely of
English life. But her plots are reason
able, her style simple and expressive,
and her stories quite exciting.
One thing authors would do well to
get over is their habit of making the
characters say in surprise, "This is
just like a book." Of course it is, it
is a book. Consequently it becomes
a trifle tiresome to hear the refrain
all through "Partners in Crime" that
"it sounds just like a regular detec
tive story!"
Miss Christie's book, for a detec
tive story, is really excellent. Too
many such stories are badly written
and poorly put together. If you want a
few hours of easy reading and also
enjoyment, by all means read "Part
ners in Crime."
Hans Frost, by Hugh Walpole. (Dou
bleday Doran and Company, Pub
lishers. New York. 1929.)
"Most gentlemen," said Hans Frost,
"are liars."
When Hans Frost makes this state
ment, he is seventy years old, and
esteemed the greatest living writer
of England. But for the first time in
his life he is looking squarely at him
self, and at the people around him,
and he is forced to admit that he too
belongs under this generality.
"I've been living all the wrong kind
of life," he confessed —"submitting to
other people out of laziness, just pass
ing into corruption in an armchair.
I'm going to lead my own life from
now on. I shan't care a damn for any
body, and I'll die in a ditch with a
bottle of whisky in my hand and net
tles in my hair, and the worms will
eat me, .... l)o you know what would
have happened otherwise? I'd have
died in my bed, and there'd have been
three doctors, oxygen in a bag, and
rows of medicine bottles. My wife
would have closed my eyes, my
mother-in-law would have danced the
saraband.
"I sacrificed my life for a ceremony
that has always bored me to death,
for people who are less than shadows
to me, for a convention that is a
gilded sham. I've been playing blind
man's buff for seventy years."
The above passage holds the essence
of Hugh Walpole's latest novel, Hans
Frost, which is the story of a literary
figure (entirely mythical) who wakes
up in time to make a last bid for lib
erty and happiness, after he has been
choked for years by the cotton-wool
of fame, security, and luxury.
Even so short a passage leaves no
doubt that Hugh Walpole has lost
none of his characteristic exuberance
of style. As in the previous novels
that made him so popular both in
England and America, Hans Frost is
alive with striking, almost crudely
vital passages, intensely sincere,
warm, and human. But besides re
taining all of his old qualities, the
author reveals certain surprising new
ones, among them a brilliant and un
guessed capacity for sophistication.
Walpole readers will probably re
vise their habit of not thinking of him
as sophisticated, for here he has un
dertaken a difficult and subtle experi
ment, which only a sophisticated mind
and insight could carry through suc
cessfully. He has made love the basis
and excuse for his book, but it is none
of the ordinary kinds of love, nor even
Platonic love. Under his pen is de
veloped a relationship between an old
man of seventy, and his lovely, sensi
tive, young niece that is a delicate
and rather perfect thing.
The swift movement of the story
will likewise prove an agreeable sur
prise to Walpole readers. For sheer
readability, Hans Frost surpasses all

of the well-known author's work.
However, the characterizations are
the chief delight of the book. The
"Grand Old Man of English Letters"
is, of course, supebrb, while the por
trait of Ruth, his wife, is at times
even more brilliant. She both fasci
nates and repels the reader, and is
never fully understood. Her selfish
nesß and her hardness make her al
most a jarring note in a beautiful,
significant story such as this is. But
if she seems at first too brittle, too

now on. I shan't care a damn for any
body, and I'll die in a ditch with a
bottle of whisky in my hand and net
tles in my hair, and the worms will
eat me, .... l)o you know what would
have happened otherwise? I'd have
died in my bed, and there'd have been
three doctors, oxygen in a bag, and
rows of medicine bottles. My wife
would have closed my eyes, my
mother-in-law would have danced the
saraband.
"I sacrificed my life for a ceremony
that has always bored me to death,
for people who are less than shadows
to me, for a convention that is a
gilded sham. I've been playing blind
man's buff for seventy years."
The above passage holds the essence
of Hugh Walpole's latest novel, Hans
Frost, which is the story of a literary
figure (entirely mythical) who wakes
up in time to make a last bid for lib
erty and happiness, after he has been
choked for years by the cotton-wool
of fame, security, and luxury.
Even so short a passage leaves no
doubt that Hugh Walpole has lost
none of his characteristic exuberance
of style. As in the previous novels
that made him so popular both in
England and America, Hans Frost is
alive with striking, almost crudely
vital passages, intensely sincere,
warm, and human. But besides re
taining all of his old qualities, the
author reveals certain surprising new
ones, among them a brilliant and un
guessed capacity for sophistication.
Walpole readers will probably re
vise their habit of not thinking of him
as sophisticated, for here he has un
dertaken a difficult and subtle experi
ment, which only a sophisticated mind
and insight could carry through suc
cessfully. He has made love the basis
and excuse for his book, but it is none
of the ordinary kinds of love, nor even
Platonic love. Under his pen is de
veloped a relationship between an old
man of seventy, and his lovely, sensi
tive, young niece that is a delicate
and rather perfect thing.
The swift movement of the story
will likewise prove an agreeable sur
prise to Walpole readers. For sheer
readability, Hans Frost surpasses all

of the well-known author's work.
However, the characterizations are
the chief delight of the book. The
"Grand Old Man of English Letters"
is, of course, supebrb, while the por
trait of Ruth, his wife, is at times
even more brilliant. She both fasci
nates and repels the reader, and is
never fully understood. Her selfish
nesß and her hardness make her al
most a jarring note in a beautiful,
significant story such as this is. But
if she seems at first too brittle, too
limited, to belong to the rest of the
novel, it is apparent later than these
very qualities only emphasize the
power and truth exemplified in Hans
Frost's nature. —M. L. R.
Partners in Crime, by Agatha Christie.
(Dodd, Meade and Co., Publish
ers. New York. 1929.)
The trouble with most detective
stories is that the author takes him
self too seriously. Agatha Christie's
latest book proves an exception to
this, as do most of her other stories.
In "Partners in Crime," while none of
the thrills are lost, Miss Christie
seems to be delicately laughing up
her sleeve. They are all there —mur-
ders, robberies, abductions; ar.d the
plots are all carefully worked out. But
through them all runs a slight vein
of humor.
A novel form of presentation has
been used. A young couple find them
selves at the head of an international
detective agency. They are the man
agers, the detectives, and the secre
taries of "Blunt's Brilliant Detectives."
How they solve various cases, with
the help of Scotland Yard, is told.
The funny part is the way in which
Tomp and Tuppence, the couple, at
tack various cases. When the case
presented seems to be one of the
Conan Doyle variety, they immediate
ly become Sherlock and his faithful
Watson; another time, and they are
Herek Ponet and Hastings with the
"little grey cells."
A reason for Miss Christie's slightly
satirical air, may be that she is an
American, who having lived a long
time in England, writes entirely of
English life. But her plots are reason
able, her style simple and expressive,
and her stories quite exciting.
One thing authors would do well to
get over is their habit of making the
characters say in surprise, "This is
just like a book." Of course it is, it
is a book. Consequently it becomes
a trifle tiresome to hear the refrain
all through "Partners in Crime" that
"it sounds just like a regular detec
tive story!"
Miss Christie's book, for a detec
tive story, is really excellent. Too
many such stories are badly written
and poorly put together. If you want a
few hours of easy reading and also
enjoyment, by all means read "Part
ners in Crime."
Hans Frost, by Hugh Walpole. (Dou

"Most gentlemen," said Hans Frost,
"are liars."
When Hans Frost makes this state
ment, he is seventy years old, and
esteemed the greatest living writer
of England. But for the first time in
his life he is looking squarely at him
self, and at the people around him,
and he is forced to admit that he too
belongs under this generality.
"I've been living all the wrong kind
of life," he confessed —"submitting to
other people out of laziness, just pass
ing into corruption in an armchair.
I'm going to lead my own life from
now on. I shan't care a damn for any

In "Partners in Crime," while none of
the thrills are lost, Miss Christie
seems to be delicately laughing up
her sleeve. They are all there —mur-
ders, robberies, abductions; ar.d the
plots are all carefully worked out. But
through them all runs a slight vein
of humor.
A novel form of presentation has
been used. A young couple find them
selves at the head of an international
detective agency. They are the man
agers, the detectives, and the secre
taries of "Blunt's Brilliant Detectives."
How they solve various cases, with
the help of Scotland Yard, is told.
The funny part is the way in which
Tomp and Tuppence, the couple, at
tack various cases. When the case
presented seems to be one of the
Conan Doyle variety, they immediate
ly become Sherlock and his faithful
Watson; another time, and they are
Herek Ponet and Hastings with the
"little grey cells."
A reason for Miss Christie's slightly
satirical air, may be that she is an
American, who having lived a long
time in England, writes entirely of
English life. But her plots are reason
able, her style simple and expressive,
and her stories quite exciting.
One thing authors would do well to
get over is their habit of making the
characters say in surprise, "This is
just like a book." Of course it is, it
is a book. Consequently it becomes
a trifle tiresome to hear the refrain
all through "Partners in Crime" that
"it sounds just like a regular detec
tive story!"
Miss Christie's book, for a detec
tive story, is really excellent. Too
many such stories are badly written
and poorly put together. If you want a
few hours of easy reading and also
enjoyment, by all means read "Part
ners in Crime."
