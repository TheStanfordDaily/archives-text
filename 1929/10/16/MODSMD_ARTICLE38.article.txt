## BELIEVES CHEERING IS LUDICROUS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I was dozing peacefully when some
one pounced on and read your edi
torial about whooping up the cheers
and songs at the football games.
Really, old fellow, do you think Stan
ford cheering sections are necessary
to attract crowds in the stadium? Of
course not. Do you believe that the
rooters' hearts are stirred by their
own bellows? Hardly . . . they only
hear the echo. Since it was saw fit
to commercialize football the 22 play
ers and the softness of the stadium
seats is all that matters.
Between halves, once dedicated to
the vocal exercises of the college
group, the customers affectionate
their schnapps. The students cuss and
match quarters. A cheer leader imi
tates Strangler Lewis and the result
sounds like the Leviathan saluting the
Majestic off the Newfoundland Banks.
The customers smile and all kids un
der thirteen ask their mammas where
the elephants are. Bets are evened
and arbitriged. The college man won
ders whether there will be a good
looking woman at the table next to his
at the night's celebration; the co-ed
wonders whether she should say that
she was going to stay with her aunt.
I do not intend to say that there is

no honest cheering for the team.
Plenty of it. But it leaves Boccaccio
miles behind and Barnacle Bill at the
post.
For instance, one person will grow
violent when a tackle is made and a
player scrapes three layers of night
j cream off his nose. Some fair thing
| will howl with anticipation when the
halfback chucks his arms around a
player's neck and hugs him for six
yards.
Cheering, except for one's oppon
ents, is vulgar. Mere pats on the
j back. It has nothing to do with trying
| to show the players that their student
body appreciates them. Anyone who
will go through the Attilian regime
! that is football practice and feel in
' whole or part rewarded by some
: vague howlings akin to a 1922 loud
| and speaker attached to a 1929 power
! radio set is either an extraordinarily
j appreciative individual or a nut.
So, my dear sir, let me beg of you
ito discard the salvationary practice
1 of night club hostesses and masters of
j ceremony at chamber of commerce
banquets. To sing songs and cheer
while men are getting their legs
wrenched and their bridge-work dis
located is just a bit ludicrous.
Best wishes, Martin Frankel.

So, my dear sir, let me beg of you
ito discard the salvationary practice

banquets. To sing songs and cheer
while men are getting their legs

The Editor, Sir:
I was dozing peacefully when some
one pounced on and read your edi
torial about whooping up the cheers
and songs at the football games.
Really, old fellow, do you think Stan
ford cheering sections are necessary
to attract crowds in the stadium? Of
course not. Do you believe that the
rooters' hearts are stirred by their
own bellows? Hardly . . . they only
hear the echo. Since it was saw fit
to commercialize football the 22 play
ers and the softness of the stadium
seats is all that matters.
Between halves, once dedicated to
the vocal exercises of the college
group, the customers affectionate
their schnapps. The students cuss and
match quarters. A cheer leader imi
tates Strangler Lewis and the result
sounds like the Leviathan saluting the
Majestic off the Newfoundland Banks.
The customers smile and all kids un
der thirteen ask their mammas where
the elephants are. Bets are evened
and arbitriged. The college man won
ders whether there will be a good
looking woman at the table next to his
at the night's celebration; the co-ed
wonders whether she should say that
she was going to stay with her aunt.
I do not intend to say that there is

no honest cheering for the team.
Plenty of it. But it leaves Boccaccio
miles behind and Barnacle Bill at the
post.
For instance, one person will grow
violent when a tackle is made and a
player scrapes three layers of night
j cream off his nose. Some fair thing
| will howl with anticipation when the
halfback chucks his arms around a
player's neck and hugs him for six
yards.
Cheering, except for one's oppon
ents, is vulgar. Mere pats on the
j back. It has nothing to do with trying
| to show the players that their student
body appreciates them. Anyone who
will go through the Attilian regime
! that is football practice and feel in
' whole or part rewarded by some
