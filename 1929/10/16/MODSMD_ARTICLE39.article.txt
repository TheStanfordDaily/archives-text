# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....
## 
### 
The first copy of the new graduate
publication, "Alumnus," edited by
Archie Rice, '95, appeared on the
campus October 16, 1904. In it ap
peared the story, "Why Mayfield Is
to Close Its Saloons." The "Mayfield
habit," it seems, cost Stanford in thir
teen years the expulsion of 400 men.
After editing the "Alumnus," Rice
joined the staff of the Chronicle. Dar
ing the war, he served on several
committees, and now makes a hobby
of interviewing world celebrities. As
a freshman he broke a campus record
by walking from the Quad to Powell
Street, San Francisco, 35 miles, in
8 hours 35Vfe minutes.
"Get your hair cut by Wood, the
artist, for 25 cents and your razor
honed free," read an advertisement
in the Daily.
Plugs ordered from the East by the
Junior Class arrived and went on sale

at the haberdashery at one dollar
each. They were not due until Octo
ber 21, but prompt action of the com
mittee in charge prevented delay.
Program chairmen for dances please
note.
Another advertisement: "El Capi
tan Stable —Finest Tally-ho in Palo
Alto. Give us a call for your four-in
hand drives."
Also on October 16 the Stanford
Frosh defeated the Bear Cubs 6-5 in
spite of being outweighed at nearly
every position. The Cubs scored first,
recovering a blocked punt behind the
Stanford goal line, but they failed to
convert. Shortly after Fenton, 17-year
old captain, caught a California punt
and immediately returned an onside
kick. The ball rolled to the U.C. one
yard line where Fenton fell on it.
From there the Frosh took the ball
over for a touchdown and converted.
