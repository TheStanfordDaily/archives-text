## SOUP'S ON 
### 
Immediately after the Washington
State game was over last Saturday
evening, some twenty-nine sturdy
California gridiron heroes and a mul
titude of loyal U.C. supporters climbed
on board a special train headed for
Philadelphia, where the Bears will
play tbo University of Pennsylvania
this week-end.
California is doped to win by a ma
jority of the football critics, for ac
cording to them Cal has a more im
pressive season's record to date. And
too, the Pears have a regular habit
of downing the Quaker lads.
Stanford stands up with the rest of
the West in offering huzzahs and
hopes that California will win. Not
that we sons of the Stanford Red
havo any special love for the Golden
Bear, but then next to ourselves, we
like Cal victories best as well as
B.V.IVs.
But U.C. Is likely to have to
show more offensive power than
she has so far this season to come
out on top. Even Brick Morse has
joined the other bleacher sages
to make it unanimous that the
Bear offense has not been click
ing up to par. For as to Cal's
much pre-season heralded ball
toting—oh, well, it looks as
though Nibs Price's bag of of
fensive tricks is as empty as was
Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard.
The Cougars found it bare enough
last week, but were too befuddled to
realize the fact, and as a consequence
went slinking back to their northern
lair without an anticipated choice
morsel of Bear meat.
Not that the author of this column
wishes to belittle the Cal team, for the
Bear of 1929 is no moth-eaten taxi
dermist's specimen. Price's outfit still
possesses a strong defense, as was
shown last Saturday when Cal twice
held off Washington State thrusts
from the thirteen-yard line, and also
the week previous when St. Mary's
failed to punch over a score from the
one-yard line.
Yet, statistics show that aside from
passing, the Cougars outgained the
Bears. In the second half, Washington
State made seven first downs to Cali
fornia's two.
As for running plays, the Cal
boys ran enough to be true, but
they generally ran in the wrong
direction or into a solid brick
wall. Far too frequently were the
great Benny Lom and his gallop
ing cohorts tossed behind the
line of scrimmage for losses.
This person Lom, by the way, ap
pears to be losing most of his popu
larity for ail-American candidacy. Mr.
Lom can't seem to get anywhere on
foot, and only averaged one-third of a
yard against St. Mary's and last Sat
urday rolled up a mean average of
one and two-tenths yards. There are
dozens of backs on the Coast who
could do better than that.
All-Americans should be made
of more aggressive stuff!
Benny is a good punter, all right,
and a fair passer. But his pigskin

packing is too great a liability to have
on an all-American team.
It appears logical that sports
writers spreading their blurb over
this neck of the woods would do
a lot better in booming up some
of the more substantial candi
dates, as Mr. Walter Heinecke at
center. Pop Warner says that
Walt is the best pivot man he has
ever laid eyes upon, and Pop has
seen plenty of good centers in his
day.
But the writer is getting away from
his original subject, so had better cry
"Soup's on," and let it go at that.

Walt is the best pivot man he has

Immediately after the Washington
State game was over last Saturday
evening, some twenty-nine sturdy
California gridiron heroes and a mul
titude of loyal U.C. supporters climbed
on board a special train headed for
Philadelphia, where the Bears will
play tbo University of Pennsylvania
this week-end.
California is doped to win by a ma
jority of the football critics, for ac
cording to them Cal has a more im
pressive season's record to date. And
too, the Pears have a regular habit
of downing the Quaker lads.
Stanford stands up with the rest of
the West in offering huzzahs and
hopes that California will win. Not
that we sons of the Stanford Red
havo any special love for the Golden
Bear, but then next to ourselves, we
like Cal victories best as well as
B.V.IVs.
But U.C. Is likely to have to
show more offensive power than
she has so far this season to come
out on top. Even Brick Morse has
joined the other bleacher sages
to make it unanimous that the
Bear offense has not been click
ing up to par. For as to Cal's
much pre-season heralded ball
toting—oh, well, it looks as
though Nibs Price's bag of of
fensive tricks is as empty as was
Old Mother Hubbard's cupboard.
The Cougars found it bare enough
last week, but were too befuddled to
realize the fact, and as a consequence
went slinking back to their northern
lair without an anticipated choice
morsel of Bear meat.
Not that the author of this column
wishes to belittle the Cal team, for the
Bear of 1929 is no moth-eaten taxi
dermist's specimen. Price's outfit still
possesses a strong defense, as was
shown last Saturday when Cal twice
held off Washington State thrusts
from the thirteen-yard line, and also
the week previous when St. Mary's
failed to punch over a score from the
one-yard line.
Yet, statistics show that aside from
passing, the Cougars outgained the
Bears. In the second half, Washington
State made seven first downs to Cali
fornia's two.
As for running plays, the Cal
boys ran enough to be true, but
they generally ran in the wrong
direction or into a solid brick
wall. Far too frequently were the
great Benny Lom and his gallop
ing cohorts tossed behind the
line of scrimmage for losses.
This person Lom, by the way, ap
pears to be losing most of his popu
larity for ail-American candidacy. Mr.
Lom can't seem to get anywhere on
foot, and only averaged one-third of a
yard against St. Mary's and last Sat
urday rolled up a mean average of
one and two-tenths yards. There are
dozens of backs on the Coast who
could do better than that.
All-Americans should be made
of more aggressive stuff!
Benny is a good punter, all right,
and a fair passer. But his pigskin

packing is too great a liability to have
on an all-American team.
It appears logical that sports
writers spreading their blurb over
this neck of the woods would do
a lot better in booming up some
of the more substantial candi
dates, as Mr. Walter Heinecke at
center. Pop Warner says that
Walt is the best pivot man he has
