# Householders Of Campus Discuss Local Problems
## 
### 
A meeting of the householders of
the Stanford campus presided over by
Comptroller Roth was held in the Wo
men's Clubhouse recently. Develop
ment of the campus water supply,
roads, proposed bus line, and campus
school were discussed.
The gathering was called by Comp
troller Roth, and concerned the house
holders of the campus rather than the
academic portions of the LTniversity.
After the main business of the meet
ing was disposed of, an open meeting
was held and suggestions for campus
improvements were discussed.
