# FRESHMEN TO BEGIN ANNUAL U.C. BONFIRE WORK NOVEMBER 18
## Construction Time Will Be Limited to Three Days; Caldwell to Aid 
### 
Work on the Big Game bonfire will
begin Monday, November 18, and con
tinue for three days, according to
A.S.S.U. President Stanford Steinbeck
in a report to the Executive Commit
tee last night. Supporting poles will
be erected and ties delivered on the
preceding Saturday. The work will be
done by the freshman class under the
supervision of a central committee
composed of Steinbeck, Charles Fox,
chairman of the Rally Committee, and
Phillip Caldwell of the engineering
school.
Size Limited
By cutting the construction time to
three days the danger of premature
burning is materially lessened and the
size of the pyre will be automatically
limited, Steinbeck explained.
Robert M. Clarke was appointed
chairman of the Election Board in
place of Charles Fox who resigned
last week.
Hector Dyer and John Lauritzen
were selected to investigate a peti

stricken from the records by a change

The Student Manager was authorized
to pay last year's outstanding debt
