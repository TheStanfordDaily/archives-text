MANHATTAN, Kan., Oct. 16. (£>)—
Campus "warfare" between the Uni
versity of Kansas and the Kansas
State Agricultural College, stirred up
as a prelude to the annual football
game between the two institutions
next Saturday, reached a high pitch
today with hapless "prisoners of war"
undergoing hazing in both camps.
In raids last night 18 University of
Kansas students from Lawrence were
captured and placed in the cage here
of Touchdown 11, wildcat mascot of
the Aggie football team. The wildcat
was removed from the cage recently
following an attempt by student raid
ers from Lawrence to capture it.
The "prisoners" this morning were
paraded before various fraternity
bouses and then given "prison hair
cuts."
Reports from the enemy camp were
that only two Aggie students were
being held in Lawrence. They were
captured yesterday after seven auto
mobile loads of Aggie men invaded
the University campus and carried
away four "prisoners" after dousing
paint on a campus statue.
Leland Chapin, an Aggie student,
was taken prisoner here Monday by
students from the university. After
shaving his head, the K.U. men sent
him back to Manhattan on a passen
ger train, attired in a gingham dress
and with K.U. painted on his back.
