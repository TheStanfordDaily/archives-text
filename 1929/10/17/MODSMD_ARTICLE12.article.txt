# ADOPT SIX CENT BUS FARE FOR CAMPUS LINE
## Roth Completes Routing of New Line; Order More Busses; Service to Start Monday 
### 
Inaugurating an improved transpor
tation service for the campus, the new
Stanford bus line that goes into
operation Monday morning will oper
ate over a more extensive route than
the trolley line which it displaces.
A tentative course for the new line
that extends from the Southern Pacific
depot to the Stanford Grammar
School at the corner of Santa Ynez
and Lasuen was arranged at a con
ference between Comptroller Almon
E. Roth and Peninsula Railway offi
cials yesterday. It was also decided
to maintain the former street car fare
of six cents.
For the present, busses similar to
those operating on Waverley street
in Palo Alto will be used. New busses
have been ordered and when they ar
rive the service will be increased and
a new route laid out that will be even
more inclusive of campus needs. A
study is now being made of the cam
pus transportation problem with re
gard to the wants of both University
and Palo Alto High School students.
The complete route of the new bus
system is as follows: From the South
ern Pacific Depot out Palm Drive to
the Oval. Around west side of the
Oval, past the Administration Build
ing and Art Gallery to Encina Hall.
South on Galvez street to Portola and
west on Portola to the Engineering
corner of the Quad. Thence past the
Bookstore, the postoffice, and out the
Row on Lasuen street to the school
house at the intersection of Lasuen
and Santa Ynez. The same course will
be used by busses returning to Palo
Alto.
