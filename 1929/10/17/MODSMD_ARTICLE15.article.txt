# FRENCH GIVE CONSENT FOR ARMS PARLEY
## France Wishes Discussion of Complete Disarmament In January Meet 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 16. The French
Government's acceptance of Great
Britain's invitation to participate in
the Five Power Naval Conference in
London next January was forwarded
to Ambassador de Fleurlau today for
transmission to the British Foreign
Office.
The note of acceptance was pur
posely reticent, but is interpreted as
reaffirming the French view that any
naval disarmament discussions must
take into consideration the question
of disarmament as a whole.
"The French Government, while it
is ready to accept any common move
ment for reduction of naval arma
ments, will insist that anything done
by the London Conference shall be
regarded as merely preparatory to the
work of the League of Nations dis
armament commission.
The French reply expresses parti
cular satisfaction over the fact that
Great Britain and the United States
found in the Kellogg-Briand pact "a
precious element for the realization
between them of an understanding in
principle concerning naval armaments,
which seemed to them to respond to
their requirements for security."
It notes that the British Govern
ment after coming to an understand
ing at Washington, proposes to ex
tend the scope of the conversations
to include powers that appear special
ly interested in the solution of the
naval problem, with a view to the
general conference in the future for
the limitation and reduction of arma
ments.
