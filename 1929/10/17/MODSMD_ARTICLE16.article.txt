# FROSH SOCCER TEAM BOWS TO SAN MATEO IN HARD-FOUGHT TILT
## 
### 
Overwhelmed by superior teamwork
and footwork the Stanford freshman
soccer squad went down before the
San Mateo Junior College, 2-0, yester
day afternoon on the home field. Even
though defeated, the babes, especially
the defense, worked wonders in keep
ing the score that low and for the
first game that they have played the
whole team functioned remarkably
well, judging from the performances
of past freshman teams.
Washburn at center half and Brek
elbaum, goalie, were mainly responsi
ble for keeping down the score. The
forward wall appeared to be the weak
est point as the ball fas rarely past
the center line; consequently, the
yearlings were forced to play a de
fensive game.
Yesterday's game was the first in
the California Intercollegiate Fresh
man Soccer Championship. The fresh
man eleven, having now been initi
ated by their first game, should make
a good showing against the Pescadero
High School team which they meet
on the home field next Tuesday.
The Stanford lineup is Brekelbaura,
goal; Brash, right fullback; Folda,
left fullback; Eisner, right half; Wash
burn, center half; Roos, left half;
Nakayama, outside right; Laughlin,
inside right; Fraser, center forward;
Ripley, inside left; Hines, outside left.
Substitutions: Smith for Eisner, Pol
lard for Laughlin, and Pope for Folda.
