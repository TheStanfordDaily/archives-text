# O.S.C. HOPING TO STAGE UPSET IN STANFORD GAME
## Cards Make Poor Showing in U.C.L.A. Game on Defensive Work; Must Improve Play Oregon's Main Threats Lie in Speedy Backfield Quartet; Play Open Style of Game 
### Stephen Dietrich 
With the Cardinals' next conference
stand but two days ahead, reports
floating down from out of the North
indicate that Oregon State holds high
hopes of knocking Stanford out of
the Coast championship running.
Not that the Staters intend to catch
Coacli Warner's men napping or rest
ing up for the U.S.C. game, but they
are coming to the Farm bent on aveng
ing past defeats at the hands of the
Cardinals. Added to this, their stiff
resistance against the powerful Tro
jan attack three weeks ago has made
the northern players confident of up
setting the Cards.
The Oregon State team, along with
Idaho, appears to be the big threat of
the Northwest. Last week Coach Paul
Schissler's squad rolled up seventy
one points against Columbia, which
proves tliat the Staters are aggres
sive enough. For a team has to have
a pretty fair offense to score eleven
touchdowns in one afternoon's enter
tainment, no matter how soft-picking
its opponents are.
It is true that O.S.C. fell before the
Thundering Herd, but then her de
feat was largely due to her weakness
against long passes. Since then Schis
sler has spent a considerable time in
perfecting a strong passing defense,
so Itothert and the other Stanford
passers will have to be careful where
they toss the ball on Saturday.
The Staters play an open style of
game, the same that surprised the
N.Y.U. Violets so greatly last year.
Coach Schissler has taught his
charges how to use a modified Notre
Dame shift to perfection.
This modification, known as the
military shift, is a combination of the
line and backfield shift, and is plenty
tricky to stop. Stanford will have to
improve its defensive play over that
displayed at Los Angeles last week
to check the Staters. According to re
ports, the Bruins made monkeys out
of the Cards now and then on a cou
ple of half-baked deceptive plays.
Although the Oregon line is made
up of green material, it stood up well
against the Trojans' off-tackle smash
es. However, its lack of weight, only
averaging 178 pounds per man, may
prove a huge handicap this week with
Herb Fleishhacker, Chuck Smalling,
and Harry Hillman crashing the line.
Schissler misses the playing of How
ard Maple, sensational half, who was
one of the trickiest ball-packers on
the Coast last year, but he still pos
sesses a speedy backfield quartet in
Sherwood, Nosier, Metten, and Kerr.
The Cards will have to keep an espe
cially sharp eye on this man Nosier,
as down in the Coliseum three weeks
ago he ran a punt back seventy yards
through the entire U.S.C. # team for
the Staters' only score of the day.

touchdowns in one afternoon's enter
tainment, no matter how soft-picking
its opponents are.
It is true that O.S.C. fell before the
Thundering Herd, but then her de
feat was largely due to her weakness
against long passes. Since then Schis
sler has spent a considerable time in
perfecting a strong passing defense,
so Itothert and the other Stanford
passers will have to be careful where
they toss the ball on Saturday.
The Staters play an open style of
game, the same that surprised the
N.Y.U. Violets so greatly last year.
Coach Schissler has taught his
charges how to use a modified Notre
Dame shift to perfection.
This modification, known as the
military shift, is a combination of the
line and backfield shift, and is plenty
tricky to stop. Stanford will have to
improve its defensive play over that
displayed at Los Angeles last week
to check the Staters. According to re
ports, the Bruins made monkeys out
of the Cards now and then on a cou
ple of half-baked deceptive plays.
Although the Oregon line is made
up of green material, it stood up well
against the Trojans' off-tackle smash
es. However, its lack of weight, only
averaging 178 pounds per man, may
prove a huge handicap this week with
Herb Fleishhacker, Chuck Smalling,
and Harry Hillman crashing the line.
Schissler misses the playing of How
ard Maple, sensational half, who was
one of the trickiest ball-packers on
the Coast last year, but he still pos
sesses a speedy backfield quartet in
Sherwood, Nosier, Metten, and Kerr.
The Cards will have to keep an espe
cially sharp eye on this man Nosier,
as down in the Coliseum three weeks
ago he ran a punt back seventy yards
through the entire U.S.C. # team for
the Staters' only score of the day.
With the Cardinals' next conference
stand but two days ahead, reports
floating down from out of the North
indicate that Oregon State holds high
hopes of knocking Stanford out of
the Coast championship running.
Not that the Staters intend to catch
Coacli Warner's men napping or rest
ing up for the U.S.C. game, but they
are coming to the Farm bent on aveng
ing past defeats at the hands of the
Cardinals. Added to this, their stiff
resistance against the powerful Tro
jan attack three weeks ago has made
the northern players confident of up
setting the Cards.
The Oregon State team, along with
Idaho, appears to be the big threat of
the Northwest. Last week Coach Paul
Schissler's squad rolled up seventy
one points against Columbia, which
proves tliat the Staters are aggres
sive enough. For a team has to have
a pretty fair offense to score eleven
touchdowns in one afternoon's enter
tainment, no matter how soft-picking
its opponents are.
