# TRUCE IN MILK STRIKE

KANSAS CITY, Oct. 15. (/p)â€”An
impassioned plea by several members
of the Milk Producers' Association of
Kansas City for cessation of the vio
lence which last week marked the
Kansas City milk strike, apparently
had brought at least a temporary
peace today to nearby highways
which only two days ago were the
scene of vandalism and gunplay.
