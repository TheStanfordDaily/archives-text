# WHEN GOOD FELLOWS GET TOGETHER
## 
### 
One of the unique conditions at Stanford is the friendly, informal
relationship that exists between students and that venerable, austere body,
the Stanford faculty. At few universities do students have the common
social intercourse with faculty members that they do at Stanford. Like
wise at most schools of higher education the faculty does not care whether
it knows the students or not. There is little contact between the two
parties other than the formal atmosphere of the classroom. But at Stan
ford this is different.
In order to promote and maintain this typically Stanford custom the
Fellowship Teas were organized. These sociable gatherings are held
every afternoon from 4:30 until 5:30 o'clock. They are open to all
students and faculty members. Invitations are not necessary. Although
it is the common impression that Stanford roughs shy from "teas" and
everything that goes with them, these Fellowship meetings have been
attended by an equal number of men and women. "Dressing-up" for the
occasion is regarded with disdain. Here students, attired in the usual
Quad costume, can get acquainted with faculty members.
The biggest asset that can be gained from attending a university is
the friendships made during college term. This becomes more valuable
if contacts can be made with members of the faculty. In those hectic
days when Stanford was struggling for existence, the faculty members
and the students alike put their shoulders to the wheel to push Stanford
to the top. This started the informal friendship that exists today.
There can be little doubt that students will receive something distinctly
worth while by attending the Fellowship Teas. And on the other hand
it may be presumed that the faculty members will be refreshed from their
ponderous duties by chatting about this year's Big Game and the prob
lems and perplexities of campus life.
