# WILL PICKUPS PASS WITH THE TOONERVILLE?
## 
### 
The few students who do not drive automobiles will welcome the
announcement that the old, inadequate trolley system on the campus will
soon be replaced by a bus line. For years they had to walk long dis
tances to use the unsatisfactory trolley when they wanted to get to Palo
Alto, or wait a long time at the town terminal to get a ride to the campus.
Because of the long waits necessary there grew up the courteous
custom of auto drivers to pick up waiting students at both terminals of
the trolley line. The bus service, with faster schedule and more extended
route, will materially ease the transportation problem of the pedestrians.
The new line will also make it possible to give special service on occasions
when large crowds come to the campus for athletic or other events.
No one will rue the passing of the trolley, but some will wonder if
the "pickup" custom will go out with it. The Daily sincerely hopes that
it will not.
