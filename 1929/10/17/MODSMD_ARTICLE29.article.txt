# IN MY DAY
## 
### 
To live in the present seems to be one of the most difficult problems
with which the undergraduate is confronted. Through generations of
"When I was your age" we have come to look upon the past as the only
time worth living. This state is not entirely the fault of the victim.
Every time a group gathers to play again a game just ended some
worthy confronts them with "You should have seen the run Whozis made
against Scareachos. Now that was a game—" and they take up the re
mainder of the day recounting the "glory that was Greece."
Should someone suggest a talkie he immediately hears of the delights
of the Old Opry. When he offers the defense that he has heard Sousa
he is countered with "You should have heard him before his whiskers
grayed and were trimmed."
The present offers itself only as a field from which to gather anecdotes
to save for future generations. We may as well begin now storing away
stories—this may be some satisfaction. Better still would be the throw
ing off the wool and realizing that this is youth, and it is now and us.—
