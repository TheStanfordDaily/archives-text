# November First Last Day For Quad Senior Pictures
## 
### 
November first is the absolute dead
line for getting senior pictures in the
Quad. Stanley Milne, editor of this
year's book, announces that that is
the last date upon which any senior
pictures will be taken. Before having
their pictures taken, however, all sen
iors must have purchased their Quads
or made deposits of three dollars each.
The three dollars will assure the pic
ture's being in and the book may be

procured by paying the balance later.
Senior Quads cost seven dollars.
To make an appointment, telephone
the editorial office of the Quad, Palo
Alto 6161, local 140, or stop at the
Women's Clubhouse between the
hours of nine and twelve or one and
four. Beginning today, pictures will
be taken from nine to twelve and one
to five.
Quads are on sale at the Quad Man
ager's office, which has the location
that the Student Body office had last
year.
