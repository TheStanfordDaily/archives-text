"The Well of Loneliness," by Radclyffe
Hall. (Covici, Friede, Inc., Pub
lishers. New York. 1929.)
That such a book as Radclyffe Hall's
"The Well of Loneliness" should have
been suppressed in England, and there
called all sorts of terrible names,
does not speak very highly for Eng
lish censors. Of course, by virtue of
the very content, the book has given
an extra push to the current wave of
morbid over-emphasis of that cruel
mistake of nature, inversion. But "The
Well of Loneliness," being a faithful,
sincere study of the psychology of the
super-sensitive homo-sexual, is a work
which has done, and will do, a world
of good for these unfortunates by
bringing to the eyes of the intolerant,
misunderstanding public a clear, con
vincing picture of the mental life of
an invert. This book, above all others
of its kind, presents a "despairing
cry," a sincere appeal for mercy from
the other ninety-seven per cent of
humanity—the "normal" ninety-seven
per cent. It is the faithful, unsensa
tional presentation of the arch-type

homo-sexual, intended (and largely
accepted) as an aid to a class of peo
ple mercilessly ostracized from so
ciety.
Aside from the content of this bio
graphy, it is a great book. Miss Hall's
style is one of irresistible simplicity.
Carefully, accurately, she analyzes
the minds of her characters, but with
out that all-too-common attention to
detail which completely loses the
point. The first section of "The Well
of Loneliness" alone shows a knowl
edge of child psychology that should
mark this book as a worthy one. And,
incidentally, a knowledge of "parent
psychology" that might be studied
with benefit by the myriads of the
"misunderstood" younger generation.
There are paragraphs, particularly in
the chapters concerning Morton, the
old English estate of the girl's child
hood, in which is contained more
poetry than much that is published
under that name today. And above
all, stands the beauty of Miss Hall's
absolute sincerity and genuine faith
in her purpose. —E. L.
