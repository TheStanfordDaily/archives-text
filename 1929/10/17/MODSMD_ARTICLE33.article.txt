# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....

The fourth number of the 1904-05
Chaparral "has the usual number of
good jokes and bad ones," the Daily
for October 17, 1904, announced. "The
editorial comments are of very doubt
ful value —and the timeliness of the
third editorial is very doubtful."
One of the Old Boy's editorials was
a scathing denunciation of a Stanford
man who wrote an article for the
"Examiner" insinuating that the aver
age undergraduate was a hoodlum and
that his conduct was unbecoming to a
Stanford gentleman. The third edi
torial accused the Executive Commit
tee of refusing to elect a fraternity
man into its membership.
Arrangements for a large block of
reserved seats for the Big Game in
the center of the field were made by
the Alumni Association. The price
was $2.50 a ticket.

An advertisement read: "Did you
ever try a Safety Razor? Can't cut
yourself if you try. The Gem Safety
Razor adjusts every blade absolutely
perfect to suit any face. Palo Alto
Hardware Company."
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Is it permissible for anyone who has
not won his "S" to wear a block letter
varsity emblem on his plug?
—A Junior.
The editor replied:
To the above inquiry we can say
that the general sentiment is against
the wearing of the varsity emblem in
any shape, manner, or form by any
one who has not earned it in an in
tercollegiate contest. The fact that it
has been worn on plugs in the past by
men who have not been entitled to
the privilege affords no excuse for
further abuse of the Block "S."
