# CHARACTER ROLES FEATURE MILNE'S SATIRE, "THE IVORY DOOR"; M'DOWELL CAST AS KING
## 
### Elizabeth Larsh 
A. A. Milne's "The Ivory Door," a
satire without the sharp sting of most
satires, which will be given here on
November 1, is packed full of finely
drawn character parts.
Brand, the devoted man-servant and
receiver of the king's confidences, will
be played by Stanley Mullin, who did
Gregers Werle in Ibsen's "Wild Duck."
Imbued with the superstitions held by
the entire court of this symbolical
kingdom, Brand fears the ivory door
and the spirits that lurk behind it.
Faithful to his idol, the king, in all
things but this, the servant tries to
prevent Perivale from going through
the Door; and fears the devils too
much to follow his master. Mullin's
interpretation of this long, lanky, de
voted and candid body-servant should
Ivory Door."
Irving Rosenblatt, remembered for
his excellent acting in the role of
Prince William in all three perform
ances of "The Queen's Husband last
year, is well cast as the Chancellor in
Milne's comedy. Originator and ex
pounder of "a philosophy" to deal with
the pointed-eared devils behind the
ivory door, he urges the king to ig
nore the spirits—not even to think of
them —in a very medieval way.
Jack McDowell, who played John
Sluind in last season's great success,
"What Every Woman Knows," and
who played with Gordon Davis this
summer in "The Second Man," has
just been cast as the king in Milne's

short ironical epilogue to this play.
Also well-known on the campus for
his work in "What Every Woman
Knows," Arthur Hurt will play Old
Beppo, a splendid character part.
Beppo, it seems, is the only man alive
in the kingdom who saw the good
King Stephen pass through the ivory
door, to be seen no more; and Peri
vale's court is not allowed to forget
that Beppo, the eye-witness, the only
first-hand authority, knows more of
the Door and horrors behind it.
Some good broad comedy—good sol
dier comedy—is supplied in tho char
acters of Bruno, the captain of the
guard, and Titus and Carlo, the guards.
Barnard Lapacliet and J. J. Redhead,
the two guards, have a roaring scene
together, Lapachet, as Carlo, making
a good snarling, "smart" soldier; and
Redhead as stupid Titus being oh, so
dumb. George Shibley, who played
Father Pettros, the chief monk in
"The Devil in the Cheese," will do
Bruno, the captain, who spends much
time swearing "by the ivory door and
all the devils behind it."
Caroline Fisher, who has the part
of Anna, King Perivale's old nurse,
promises to do well with this "loose
bodied" individual who is tender,
motherly, and yet at the same time
a little come-hither-ish. The age-old,
never-ceasing feud between this old
nurse and Brand, the body-servant, is
good comedy. Lucile Morgan, also a
new arrival on the Stanford stage, will
play tho timid, pretty part of Thora,
Princes Lilia's maid.

satire without the sharp sting of most
satires, which will be given here on
November 1, is packed full of finely
drawn character parts.
Brand, the devoted man-servant and
receiver of the king's confidences, will
be played by Stanley Mullin, who did
Gregers Werle in Ibsen's "Wild Duck."
Imbued with the superstitions held by
the entire court of this symbolical
kingdom, Brand fears the ivory door
and the spirits that lurk behind it.
Faithful to his idol, the king, in all
things but this, the servant tries to
prevent Perivale from going through
the Door; and fears the devils too
much to follow his master. Mullin's
interpretation of this long, lanky, de
voted and candid body-servant should
Ivory Door."
Irving Rosenblatt, remembered for
his excellent acting in the role of
Prince William in all three perform
ances of "The Queen's Husband last
year, is well cast as the Chancellor in
Milne's comedy. Originator and ex
pounder of "a philosophy" to deal with
the pointed-eared devils behind the
ivory door, he urges the king to ig
nore the spirits—not even to think of
them —in a very medieval way.
Jack McDowell, who played John
Sluind in last season's great success,
"What Every Woman Knows," and
who played with Gordon Davis this
summer in "The Second Man," has
just been cast as the king in Milne's

short ironical epilogue to this play.
Also well-known on the campus for
his work in "What Every Woman
Knows," Arthur Hurt will play Old
Beppo, a splendid character part.
Beppo, it seems, is the only man alive
in the kingdom who saw the good
King Stephen pass through the ivory
door, to be seen no more; and Peri
vale's court is not allowed to forget
that Beppo, the eye-witness, the only
first-hand authority, knows more of
the Door and horrors behind it.
Some good broad comedy—good sol
dier comedy—is supplied in tho char
acters of Bruno, the captain of the
guard, and Titus and Carlo, the guards.
Barnard Lapacliet and J. J. Redhead,
the two guards, have a roaring scene
together, Lapachet, as Carlo, making
a good snarling, "smart" soldier; and
Redhead as stupid Titus being oh, so
dumb. George Shibley, who played
Father Pettros, the chief monk in
"The Devil in the Cheese," will do
Bruno, the captain, who spends much
time swearing "by the ivory door and
all the devils behind it."
Caroline Fisher, who has the part
of Anna, King Perivale's old nurse,
promises to do well with this "loose
bodied" individual who is tender,
motherly, and yet at the same time
a little come-hither-ish. The age-old,
never-ceasing feud between this old
nurse and Brand, the body-servant, is
good comedy. Lucile Morgan, also a
new arrival on the Stanford stage, will
play tho timid, pretty part of Thora,
Princes Lilia's maid.
