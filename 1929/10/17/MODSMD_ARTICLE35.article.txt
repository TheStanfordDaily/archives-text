# LACK OF WATER, TRAIN SMOKE ARE SLOWLY KILLING HISTORIC PALO ALTO REDWOOD TREE
## 
### Elizabeth Nourse 
The Palo Alto tree —that famous old
landmark which stands by the railroad
bridge at the entrance to Palo Alto —
is slowly dying after having led a
historical life from the time of its dis
covery by the early fathers who gave
it its name which is translated into
"tall stick."
In the early days there were twin
trees standing here by San Francis
quito creek, but the continual wash
ing away of the land by the winter
water in the creek caused one tree
to fall and it was only the building
of a cement bank by the Southern
Pacific Company when the present
railroad bridge was being constructed
that saved the Palo Alto tree from a
similar fate. But while this wall is
saving the grand old tree from death
by falling, it is aiding in the process
of its slow death by drying, for it is
shutting off its water supply.
Train Smoke Poisons
Added to this process of slow dry
ing is the process of poisoning going
on every day—every time a train
passes. For the smoke given off by
the engine is a poisonous gas, mainly
sulphur dioxide, and the continual
breathing of this poison by the foliage
is a big factor in the killing of the
tree.
Many attempts have been made to
save the "tall stick." The native sons
and daughters of the Golden West

have spent much money on tree sur
gery for it and Dr. Emmet Rixford of
the surgery department at the Stan
ford Medical School has done much
to help preserve the famous tree. The
city of Palo Alto has built a park
surrounding it which runs along the
creek from the railroad tracks to the
Middlefield Road bridge. Beside this
park's being a tribute to the old tree,
the frequent watering of the shrub
bery here gives the tree its only
water supply.
Death Inevitable
But in spite of all this artificial aid,
the death of the Palo Alto tree is
inevitable. It is 200 or 300 years old
and it is now so decrepit from the
lack of water and the poisoning that
it is necessary to hold it up by huge
wire cables.
Foreseeing the death of Palo Alto's
landmark, Dr. George J. Peirce of the
Stanford botany department and Mr.
Vanderlyn Stow had seven redwood
trees planted among the shrubbery
across from the Physics building. One
of these trees was killed by accident,
but the remaining six are still grow
ing heartily and are now ten or twelve
years old. The plan is that by the time
the old Palo Alto tree dies, one of
these six new trees will have out
grown the others and will be consid
ered a second "Palo Alto." In this
way It is hoped that the grand old
tree which gave Palo Alto Its name
will be remembered by posterity.
