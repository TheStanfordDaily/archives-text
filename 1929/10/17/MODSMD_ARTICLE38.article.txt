THE RACE NARROWS
Unless something quite impossible
takes place within the next month or
so, one of four superior football teams
■will walk off with the 1929 Pacific
Coast title. By the end of November
either U.S.C., Cal., Idaho, or Stanford
will be strutting around in the grid
iron limelight wearing its hogliide
crown of supremacy.
And it is more than likely that this
same set up will exist after Sautrday's
fracases. Only two of the Big Four
even go as far as to risk their chances.
The risk doesn't look too great in
the face of the fact that Stanford
meets Oregon State on the Redshirts'
own hunting grounds, while Idaho
tours over the hills into Portland to
face the Oregon Webfooters. It's prob
ably going to be a dreary day for the
Rose City fans, for unless the Web
feet have sprouted talons recently,
the big Vandal invader should return
home to Moscow with a strangled
Duck swinging under its belt.
This Vandal team, by the way,
looks to be the dark horse of the
Northwest. Before the season
opened, Idaho was looked upon as
a weak sister of the Conference —
or a sort of doormat for the rest
of the gridders to wipe the mud
off their cleats. Yet last week-end
the Vandals pulled one of the sur
prises of the year by shutting out
a supposedly strong Montana
team, which previously had gained
the distinction of tying Washing
ton.
However, it looks like a poor year
for the North all around, for on the
23rd of November Idaho is forced to
meet the Thundering Herd in the
sunbaked Coliseum. Without a doubt,
the Vandals will entrain for Moscow
rather empty-handed that night.
Idaho is not going to have a chance
to repeat her cunning bit of strategy
of a few years ago, when she claimed
the Coast title by beating a couple of
the weak Northern outfits. The Van
dals successfully dodged the big three
Southern teams on that occasion.
So the real struggle lies be
tween the Bears, the Trojans, and
the Cardinals. Strange as it may
seem, the state fo California has
a monopoly on the outstanding
Western teams again this year.
This thing is developing into a
sort of habit.
A week from now the race will have
narrowed down to two real contend
ers. On that day Stanford and U.S.C.
will engage in their annual friendly
tussle. Although one of the two must
fall by the wayside, it will be a fes
tivity just chuck full of good clean fun
—for the spectators.
Out on the turf it will be quite a
different matter.
The Redshirts will be there to
avenge last year's setback down in
the land of Troy. In fact, the whole
season's success depends upon the
showing that the Cards make on the
26th.
The game will be good and clean
all right,. But as for fun —the twenty
two or more gridiron stalwarts who
face each other will be working hard
er, faster, more furious than they
ever have before.
No matter what happens, the
winner will have a commanding
lead in the championship race.
