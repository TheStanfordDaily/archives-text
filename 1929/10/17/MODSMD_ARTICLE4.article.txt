# Dr. Dyment Explains Functions Of Women's Organized Athletics
## 
### 
"Centuries of muscular activity
have given us body structures that are
too large for our inactive lives," Dr.
Bertha Dyment said in her talk at
the women's assembly last night,
"therefore it is necessary that we
have physical exertion in the form of
games and sports. Group games are
the best," Dr. Dyment continued, "be
cause they teach us two thingsâ€”to
lose ourselves for the sake of the
team, and to 'deliver the goods' or
lose our places on the team."
Chairmen of the Women's Confer
ence committes on the constitution,
social affairs, vocational guidance,
election, Women's Clubhouse, wo
men's gymnasium, and flower service
explained the nature of activity of
their groups. Rosamond Clarke, chair
man of the gymnasium committee,
said that work on the new gym,
which is to be located on the hockey
field below Roble, will probably begin
winter quarter.
The women indicated their approval
of plans for a vocational conference.
Frances Shoup announced that ques
tionnaires in regard to the vocations
the women would prefer to have rep
resented will be sent soon to each
living group. Sufficient volunteers re
sponded to Dorothy Bogen's plea for
the Stanford Women's Glee Club to
insure its organization for this year.
At the end of the meeting Dean Yost
said a few words, which tied up very
closely with the matter of the Glee
Club. "We are not a singing college,"
Dean Yost remarked. "More songs,
and songs not about football, would
bring us closer into contact with one
another. Stanford women need to do
more things together."
