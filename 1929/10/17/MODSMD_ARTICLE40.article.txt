# AERIAL ATTACK TO FEATURE YEARLING PLAY ON SATURDAY
## Hunt's Team Bolstered For U.S.C. Game; Injured Members Return 
### 
An improved aerial attack will un
doubtedly feature the Cardinal fresh
man play when the yearlings meet
the U.S.C. frosh Saturday at Bovard
Field in Los Angeles. Coach "Husky"
Hunt has been putting the baby Red
shirts through some intensive forward
and lateral passing practice during
the last three nights, and as a result
the frosh have developed some
smooth, fast-running pass plays.
All the injured members of the lo
cal yearling organization are back in
uniform, and will probably be ready
for action in the U.S.C. contest. With
Bill Artman, Harry La√üorde, and Ted
Kite on deck, Hunt will have no cause
for worry over the previously weak
tackle positions.
The defensive playing of the fresh
men, which gave Hunt much reason
for his pessimistic attitude after the
first two contests, took a smart jump
on the football market during the
game with the Santa Clara frosh last
week. The baby Redshirts twice held
the strong Bronco outfit for downs
when a few yards would have meant
a score, thereby demonstrating that
they are capable of stopping a strong
offense.
Reports from the South indicate
that the Trojan freshmen have a pow
erful eleven. Against the touted Chaf
fey Junior College team, the Trobabes
showed a fast running attack which
netted them many yards. A cut-back
play, with the line shifting as the
ball is snapped, is one of the most
successful in the Southern California
repertoire.
One of the steadiest performers in
the Trobabes forward wall is George
Norene, who is playing center for
Coach Aubry Devine. The redhead
from Pasadena enjoys considerable
reputation as one of the best pivot
men ever seen on a freshman team,
besides being one of the most depend
able men on the squad. Kates, full
back, and Tipton, half, are the classi
est players in the Trojan backfield.
The former is an able defensive
player, and a capable line plunger.
