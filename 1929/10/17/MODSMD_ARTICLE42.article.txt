# ONLY 6000 TICKETS TO S.C. GAME LEFT; SELLOUT EXPECTED
## 
### 
Some 6,000 reserved seats for
the Stanford-Southern California
football game are still available,
and from all indications, it looks
as if there will be a complete
sell-out within a week. All these
seats are directly behind the
goalposts.
The tickets are now on sale at
the regular B.A.C. sales agencies
in Palo Alto, Redwood City, San
Mateo, San Francisco, and San
Mateo.
The growing popularity of the
U.S.C. game can be readily seen
by comparing ticket sales during
the last few years. Two years
ago 56,000 tickets were sold. Last
year approximately 70,000 were
jammed into the Coliseum. This
year it seems that all 87,194
seats will be filled.
