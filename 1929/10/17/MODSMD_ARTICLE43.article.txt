## 
### 
Stanford teams of hockey, archery,
tennis, and swimming will compete
in the annual Triangle Sports Day
which will be held at the University
of California on November 2.
When American Conference Asso
ciated College Women went on rec
ord as opposed to interscholastic com
petition for women, the women's ath
letic boards of Mills, California, and
Stanford arranged a plan of interclass
competition. This plan, which has been
in operation for six years, provides that
class teams whose members have
been chosen from the three schools
compete on a strictly class basis.
Last year a system of choosing
teams selectively was inaugurated.
This plan was found to work better
than that of having women sign up
voluntarily.
Helen Masters Bunting, head of the
women's gym department, aided by
the coaching staff and the student
captains and managers, will choose
the teams.
W.A.A. Board at the next meeting
will elect a general Sports Day man
ager who will be in charge of all ar
rangements including plans for trans
portation to California. Details of the
Field Day will be taken care of by a
committee composed of Elizabeth
Woodyatt, hockey manager; Mary
Edith Jones, swimming manager;
Elizabeth Erlin, archery manager;
and a tennis manager who has not yet
been elected.
