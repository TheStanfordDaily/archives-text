# CARD GRAYS PREPARE FOR CONTEST AGAINST GRAY FOG RESERVES
## 
### 
With the scalp of the Santa Barbara
State Teachers eleven tucked away
in their belts, the Stanford Grays are
working hard this week in prepara
tion for their game with the St. Igna
tius College Reserves Saturday.
Coaches Cuddeback and Robesky
have had such a large turnout this
week that they are having a hard
time keeping check on the material.
In scrimmage with the varsity, the
Grays have shown up well on defense,
smearing plays with great regularity.
Phil Baker, big fullback, is back in
the lineup, and was heaving a bunch
of passes during signal practice last
night. His passes are low and fast,
and fairly accurate. Grey, the place
kicking tackle, was knocked out dur
ing the scrimmage with the varsity
night before last and was not in uni
form last night. His injuries are light,
however, and will not bother him in
the game Saturday.
Hoxie, who played a good defensive
game at full Saturday, was with one
of the backfield combinations. Hardy,
Baker, Wilson, and Gilbert made up
the first-string backfield last night. It
is almost a cinch that Keenan will see
action in the St. Ignatius game be
cause of his good showing in the
Santa Barbara contest.
