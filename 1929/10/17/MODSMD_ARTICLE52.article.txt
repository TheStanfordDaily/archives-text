# SOME PLAYS POP NEVER HEARD OF

### Feg Murray 
When Glenn Scobey Warner, other
wise known as "Pop," pulled that
famous fast one on Fair Harvard back
in 1903 and showed his Carlisle In
dians how Dillon could stick a foot
ball inside the back of his Jersey and
run 105 yards unmolested through the
whole crimson team, it was thought
that the last word in trick plays had
been said. Rules and regulations
eventually prevented such snappy
ideas as painting the football red or

sewing dummy footballs on the ball
carriers' chests, but with the coming
of the forward pass came such new
trickery as the Statue of Liberty play,
the shoe-string pass, and so forth.
The old-timers had marvelous trick
plays, revolving drums of humanity,
flying wedges, leaping fullbacks, and
so forth. "Ask Dad, he knows!" Too
bad they can't put on an exhibition
game some place, using all the freak
stuff the old-timers actually got away

with. I guess at that it wouldn't look i
any funnier to us than the modern j
game would to a player of the i
'Eighties who hadn't seen any football
in the meantime.
But just a few words on this trick
play used so successfully by Captain
O. D. Cologne of the Barbers' College.
It is called the Scissors formation and
in it the right half usually carries the
ball, although Tony, the bootblack,
shines at it also. The center first j

sprinkles the pigskin with hair tonic,
thus materially strengthening the
whole line. When the quarter (here's
a good tip!) receives the ball from
center, he applies a hot towel before
passing it on. Left half gives the oval
a massage, then passes it to the full
back, who shampoos it. Right half
gets it on a lteral toss from full, and
gives it a manicure as he runs out the
door. If he scores on this play it will
be a close shave.

But just a few words on this trick
play used so successfully by Captain
O. D. Cologne of the Barbers' College.
It is called the Scissors formation and
in it the right half usually carries the
ball, although Tony, the bootblack,
shines at it also. The center first j

sprinkles the pigskin with hair tonic,
thus materially strengthening the
whole line. When the quarter (here's
a good tip!) receives the ball from
center, he applies a hot towel before
passing it on. Left half gives the oval
a massage, then passes it to the full
back, who shampoos it. Right half
gets it on a lteral toss from full, and
gives it a manicure as he runs out the
door. If he scores on this play it will
be a close shave.
