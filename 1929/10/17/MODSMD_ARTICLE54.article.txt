# DAMOCLES REACTED HERE Pens Dangle From Ceiling PSYCHOLOGISTS WONDER
## 
### 
In the ceiling of the west end of
the Stanford postoffice eight pens
bear silent witness to the power and
accuracy of the stalwart Stanford
arms. There are those, we regret to
say, who consider them to bear wit
ness to the softness of the Stanford
brains. Be that as it may, the eight
pens are suspended there, giving a
cozy little Sword of Damocles effect
to our postoffice.
The point which is puzzling our
Stanford experts, is not how the pens
got there or who put them there, but
why the west end was chosen. The
east end is conspicuously innocent of
misplaced government property. Psy-

cliologists are wondering if the pen
throwing mind has a twist in it urg
ing westward throws. The weather
men think a strong east wind was
blowing. Electrical men are consider
ing a possible magnet concealed in the
ceiling. We ask that any further theo
ries be turned in to someone.
After all, however, as no one ever
saw a postoffice pen which would
write, the disappearance, or rather
the transference of the pens has not
had any dire effects.
