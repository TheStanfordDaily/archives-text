LOS ANGELES, Oct. 10. (P.I.P.)—
November 1 will inaugurate a new
and enlarged daily for the University
of Southern California. The Trojan
will then appear as an eight-column
standard-sized daily, instead of the
seven column layout used at present.
On that date, as a part of the
twelve-page football edition planned,
the Trojan will also publish its first
rotogravure section comprising four
pages of pictures. Though not strictly
a new departure for a college paper,
rotogravure has been previously con
fined to such publications as the Har
vard Crimson, Yale News, and Stan
ford Daily, and has never been a regu
lar feature even of these. The Trojan,
according to Ralph Flynn, editor, ex
pects to publish five such sections
during the semi-centennial year.
Should the innovation prove popular
and financially feasible, it may be in
corporated as a regular part of the
paper in ensuing years as well.
