George Young, well-known au
thor and journalist, will conclude
his series of three lectures to
night in the Assembly Hall at
7:30 o'clock. His topic will be:
"Command and Freedom of the
Seas."
"The greatest post-war constitu
tional change in Europe has been a
change from Royalist to Republican
principles," stated George Young, out
standing British statesman, in his ad
dress last night in the Stanford As
sembly Hall, as he traced the reaction
ary developments of European noun
tries since the Great War.
Taking Soviet Russia and the
United Kingdom as examples of coun
tries with different constitutional
forms, acted upon by different forces,
Young declared "external forces are
now producing not only the same
forms of internal government, but the
same forms of imperialism."
"The United Kingdom is working
slowly, by economic evolution and
Russia, quickly, by political revolu
tion. Both are attempting new types
of government to reinforce the old
forms. Both are working toward the
same future, and along the same
lines."
Young, using an elaborate system
of diagrams, showed how Italy, Rus
sia, and the United Kingdom had been
following different paths, taking them
through similar states of Parliamen
tarianism, Dictatorship, Bolshevism,
and Fascism. They are now "curving
back to the same central point of
normal development," he further ex
plained.
"The future of Asia lies in the ri
valry between the two systems of gov
ernment," Young said, "the British,
with its western appeal of Industriali
zation and capital, and the Russian,
with its moral appeal of Socialism."
The United Kingdom is carrying on
instinctively, by national feeling; the
Soviet, consciously, by thinking."
