# CARDS PREPARE FOR INVASION OF O.S.C. TOMORROW
## Staters Point for Stanford; Warner Team to Take Game In Stride Before Troy Tilt Caglieri May Start at Right Half as Pop Fears to Risk Injury to Harlow Rothert 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Departing from their Northern mud
splashed field in a driving rain storm
Wednesday night after practice, thirty
three Oregon State Beavers arrived at
Pleasanton yesterday to dry out for to
morrow's Conference clash with the Car
dinal varsity.
Tomorrow's game will not only deter
mine Stanford's chances in the Coast title
race, but will give Coach Pop Warner an
opportunity to see how his charges stack
up against U.S.C. Three weeks ago Ore
gon State held the powerful Trojan run
ning attack to a 21 to 7 score. This week
end the Beavers fully expect to put over
the first major upset of the year in the
West by trouncing the Cards.
Although supposedly taking the invad
ers in stride, the Redshirts are not going
to be caught off their guard if Pop can
help it. Coach Warner intends to start
the strongest lineup possible tomorrow in
an effort to turn back the Beavers.
Varsity in Shape
The varsity is in pretty fair shape for
the game, the best it has been in since
the Oregon contest two weeks ago. How
ever, Simkins, Hillman, and Heiser are
definitely out of the lineup, while Ro
thert and Preston may not see action. All
of these men will be ready for the U.S.C.
encounter next Saturday, according to
Dr. E. F. Roth, team physician.
Though Simkins and Hillman are both
back in suits again, Pop isn't going to
take any chances of having them bunged
up before the Trojan game. Simkins is
by far the best passer on the squad, and
may prove a necessary cog in Warner's
attack on the Thundering Herd.
Heiser's knee is still bothering him,
and his place at guard will be taken care
of by Ray Dawson. The latter has been
showing up well during practice lately,
so that Heiser may find it tough going
to get back into the first string before
the Trojan invasion. If Pop decides to
bench Rothert tomorrow, his place at
right half will probably be taken care of
by Guido Caglieri. Caglieri is a smash
ing type of player, besides packing plenty
of punch on defense.
Frontrup Ready
Lud Frentrup is scheduled to start at
left half, and with Rothert on the side
lines will do most of the passing and
punting for the Cards. Frentrup found
his old-time form again down in Los An
geles last week, and may be expected to
reel off some lengthy gains tomorrow.
Two other powerhouses, Smalling and
Fleishhacker, will start at fullback and
quarter respectively. The Oregon State
line is going to have a hard time stopping
the line plunges of these two giants, and
the smashing of these battering rams may
provide the margin of victory against the
Beavers.
Following is the probable starting line
up for tomorow's gain, with a possible
change at right half :
Stanford Oregon
Muller (C) REL McKalip
Tandy RTL Stout
Dawson REL Scott
Heinecke C Geddes
Driscoll LGR Cox
Artman LTR Byington
Neill LER Striff
Fleishhacker Q Buerke
Rothert RHL Hughes
Frentrup LHR Kerr
Smalling F Gilmorc (C)

Departing from their Northern mud
splashed field in a driving rain storm
Wednesday night after practice, thirty
three Oregon State Beavers arrived at
Pleasanton yesterday to dry out for to
morrow's Conference clash with the Car
dinal varsity.
Tomorrow's game will not only deter
mine Stanford's chances in the Coast title
race, but will give Coach Pop Warner an
opportunity to see how his charges stack
up against U.S.C. Three weeks ago Ore
gon State held the powerful Trojan run
ning attack to a 21 to 7 score. This week
end the Beavers fully expect to put over
the first major upset of the year in the
West by trouncing the Cards.
Although supposedly taking the invad
ers in stride, the Redshirts are not going
to be caught off their guard if Pop can
help it. Coach Warner intends to start
the strongest lineup possible tomorrow in
an effort to turn back the Beavers.
Varsity in Shape
The varsity is in pretty fair shape for
the game, the best it has been in since
the Oregon contest two weeks ago. How
ever, Simkins, Hillman, and Heiser are
definitely out of the lineup, while Ro
thert and Preston may not see action. All
of these men will be ready for the U.S.C.
encounter next Saturday, according to
Dr. E. F. Roth, team physician.
Though Simkins and Hillman are both
back in suits again, Pop isn't going to
take any chances of having them bunged
up before the Trojan game. Simkins is
by far the best passer on the squad, and
may prove a necessary cog in Warner's
attack on the Thundering Herd.
Heiser's knee is still bothering him,
and his place at guard will be taken care
of by Ray Dawson. The latter has been
showing up well during practice lately,
so that Heiser may find it tough going
to get back into the first string before
the Trojan invasion. If Pop decides to
bench Rothert tomorrow, his place at
right half will probably be taken care of
by Guido Caglieri. Caglieri is a smash
ing type of player, besides packing plenty
of punch on defense.
Frontrup Ready
Lud Frentrup is scheduled to start at
left half, and with Rothert on the side
lines will do most of the passing and
punting for the Cards. Frentrup found
his old-time form again down in Los An
geles last week, and may be expected to
reel off some lengthy gains tomorrow.
Two other powerhouses, Smalling and
Fleishhacker, will start at fullback and
quarter respectively. The Oregon State
line is going to have a hard time stopping
the line plunges of these two giants, and
the smashing of these battering rams may
provide the margin of victory against the
Beavers.
Following is the probable starting line
up for tomorow's gain, with a possible
change at right half :
Stanford Oregon
Muller (C) REL McKalip
Tandy RTL Stout
Dawson REL Scott
Heinecke C Geddes
Driscoll LGR Cox
Artman LTR Byington
