# FEDERAL AGENTS SMASH GIGANTIC SMUGGLING RING
## Million Dollar International Syndicate Discovered In New Jersey 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 17 (#>).—Foreign
agencies, in England and in Canada, were
linked today by federal attorneys with the
$1,000,000 rum smuggling syndicate,
whose fortified arsenal, radio station, and
warehouses extending all the way from
Highlands, N.J., to Atlantic City were
simultaneously raided by federal agents
and New Jersey state troopers last night.
Both United States Attorney Charles
H. Tuttle and Assistant United States At
torney Robert Watts referred to the syn
dicate as "an international ring, with
agencies in England, Canada, and else
where."
A mile from the armed base of opera
tions at Highlands, N.J., the raiders cap
tured a hidden radio station from which
orders in code were sent to the fleet of
liquor ships and speed boats operated by
the syndicate.
Agents Conduct Raid
A force of 130 special Treasury agents,
deputy United States marshals, and New
Jersey state police, going into action si
multaneously, made 32 raids, arrested 32
men, and seized quantities of imported
liquor.
Among those arrested were Emanuel
Kessler and Morris Sweetwood, both of
whom have served terms in the federal
prison at Atlanta for large scale boot
legging operations.
The raids were based on secret indict
ments returned by a federal grand jury
at Trenton, N.J. Preparations for the
raids began six months ago, when an in
tercepted message was decoded. From
that and other messages information was
gleaned which led to the raids.
Machine Guns Found
The arsenal was located in a mansion
formerly owned by Oscar Hammerstein,
Jr. Its 20 rooms were fitted like a club.
In the basement the raiders found tun
nels leading to underground vaults in
which liquor was stored and where a
number of machine guns and a quantity
of small arms were hidden.
The cupola on top of the mansion was
equipped with telescopes and was appar
ently used as a lookout tower from which
the smugglers could watch for their craft.

torney Robert Watts referred to the syn
dicate as "an international ring, with
agencies in England, Canada, and else
where."
A mile from the armed base of opera
tions at Highlands, N.J., the raiders cap
tured a hidden radio station from which
orders in code were sent to the fleet of
liquor ships and speed boats operated by
the syndicate.
Agents Conduct Raid
A force of 130 special Treasury agents,
deputy United States marshals, and New
Jersey state police, going into action si
multaneously, made 32 raids, arrested 32
men, and seized quantities of imported
liquor.
Among those arrested were Emanuel
Kessler and Morris Sweetwood, both of
whom have served terms in the federal
prison at Atlanta for large scale boot
legging operations.
The raids were based on secret indict
ments returned by a federal grand jury
at Trenton, N.J. Preparations for the
raids began six months ago, when an in
tercepted message was decoded. From
that and other messages information was
gleaned which led to the raids.
Machine Guns Found
The arsenal was located in a mansion
formerly owned by Oscar Hammerstein,
Jr. Its 20 rooms were fitted like a club.
In the basement the raiders found tun
nels leading to underground vaults in
which liquor was stored and where a
number of machine guns and a quantity
of small arms were hidden.
The cupola on top of the mansion was
equipped with telescopes and was appar
ently used as a lookout tower from which
the smugglers could watch for their craft.
