## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, will lecture on"The Elements of
Music: Melody," Tuesday night at
7:30 o'clock in the Assembly Hall.
This is the first of a series of musical
lectures to be given every fourth
Tuesday during the year.
Although musical lectures are gen
erally given on the history of music
or on the various schools of music,
Allen believes that it is important to
understand the elements of music and
how they are developed. Autumn
quarter is to be devoted to Melocly.
