"First the street car put the horse
and buggy out of business and now
automobiles are putting us out," said
Conductor Charles D. Whittaker, dole
fully shaking his head. "I suppose it's
just as well," he continued. "In the
old days the car was always full, the
boys even rode on the roof. But now
everyone has a machine."
Whittaker's twenty-three-year job
running the familiar Stanford "Dinky"
will end at 11:47 Sunday night, when
the car will make its last trip on the
campus. Monday the new bus service
will Btart.
Horses Hinder Arrangements
In 1906 the first street car was in
stalled in Palo Alto. Much opposition
had to be overcome before the service
could be extended to the University.
It was not until 1909 that it could
finally be installed. Mr. Lathrop, Mrs.
Stanford's brother and a trustee, ob
jected strenuously on the grounds that
the cars would frighten the horses.
Mr. Lathrop, however, owned his own
automobile. Since automobiles at that
time were prohibited on Palm Drive,
he had built the road that runs paral
lel to the Drive for his special use.
Before the arrival of the "Dinky,"
the surrey and the bicycle were the

popular means of transportation for
the students. Every morning, more
than fifty surreys would gather at the
end of University avenue to collect
their daily passengers. The fare was
10 cents a ride, 25 cents after six
o'clock, and 50 cents after nine
o'clock. While the surrey was intend
ed to he a four-passenger vehicle, it
was rare that one was seen on the
campus occupied by less than eight
students. There was one surrey driver,
however, who every morning would
pick up the same fare and drive him
out to the campus through the cactus
gardens. The price was 50 cents but
the trip included a drink of whiskey.
Conductors May Remain
With the advent of the street car,
surreys became scarce. Now in its
(urn the street car gives way to the
automobile and one of Stanford's few
remaining traditions is discarded.
Most of the University's famous men
have been passengers on the "Dinky."
Though it was after Hoover's time,
both Dr. Jordan and President Wilbur
rode on it.
Monday, the "Dinkies" will bo taken
to San Jose, where they will be put
to further use. The conductors will
probably be given jobs on the new
bus service.

end of University avenue to collect
their daily passengers. The fare was
10 cents a ride, 25 cents after six
o'clock, and 50 cents after nine
o'clock. While the surrey was intend
ed to he a four-passenger vehicle, it
was rare that one was seen on the
campus occupied by less than eight
students. There was one surrey driver,
however, who every morning would
pick up the same fare and drive him
out to the campus through the cactus
gardens. The price was 50 cents but
the trip included a drink of whiskey.
Conductors May Remain
With the advent of the street car,
surreys became scarce. Now in its
(urn the street car gives way to the
automobile and one of Stanford's few
remaining traditions is discarded.
Most of the University's famous men
have been passengers on the "Dinky."
Though it was after Hoover's time,
both Dr. Jordan and President Wilbur
rode on it.
Monday, the "Dinkies" will bo taken
to San Jose, where they will be put
to further use. The conductors will
probably be given jobs on the new
bus service.
"First the street car put the horse
and buggy out of business and now
automobiles are putting us out," said
Conductor Charles D. Whittaker, dole
fully shaking his head. "I suppose it's
just as well," he continued. "In the
old days the car was always full, the
boys even rode on the roof. But now
everyone has a machine."
Whittaker's twenty-three-year job
running the familiar Stanford "Dinky"
will end at 11:47 Sunday night, when
the car will make its last trip on the
campus. Monday the new bus service
will Btart.
Horses Hinder Arrangements
In 1906 the first street car was in
stalled in Palo Alto. Much opposition
had to be overcome before the service
could be extended to the University.
It was not until 1909 that it could
finally be installed. Mr. Lathrop, Mrs.
Stanford's brother and a trustee, ob
jected strenuously on the grounds that
the cars would frighten the horses.
Mr. Lathrop, however, owned his own
automobile. Since automobiles at that
time were prohibited on Palm Drive,
he had built the road that runs paral
lel to the Drive for his special use.
Before the arrival of the "Dinky,"
the surrey and the bicycle were the

popular means of transportation for
the students. Every morning, more
than fifty surreys would gather at the
end of University avenue to collect
their daily passengers. The fare was
10 cents a ride, 25 cents after six
o'clock, and 50 cents after nine
o'clock. While the surrey was intend
