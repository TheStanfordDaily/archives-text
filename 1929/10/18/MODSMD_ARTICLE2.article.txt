# UNKNOWN "MOTHER" LEAVES PUPPIES ON SORORITY DOORSTEP
## 
### 
It literally rained cats and
dogs last nightâ€”minus the cats.
Two of the "darlingest, sweetest,
most adorable" puppies in the
world descended upon a certain
sorority house. The donors stole
up the front steps, rang the door
bell, and left their orphan charg
es to the mercy of the sisters.
The yearlings which now reign
supreme are suspected of being
victims of "hell week," and the
sisters are uncertain just when
the cats will pour in.
