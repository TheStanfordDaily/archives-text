THAT DRASTIC FUMBLE RULE
Not bo long ago, just before the
various football teams from Coast to
Coast began to swing into action for
the 192SJ gridiron season, it was wide
ly rumored in pigskin circles that this
year would witness a drastic change
in tho dear old autumn pastime.
There would be, according to a
majority of the press bull-slingers,
grandstand coaches, and common
rabble gossipers, some sort of a
football revolution. And the rea
son for this 60-called Revolt in the
Stadiums was laid to a slight
variation in the wording of the
well-known fumble rule.
No longer can a defensive player
snatch up a fumbled ball and scamper
off down the greensward for a touch
down —or even toward his own goal
in Now Year's games. In fact, he can't
take a single step with the coveted
hide-bound oval. The ball is dead as
soon as a defending man wraps his
paws around it.
But it wasn't from pity over the
poor dead ball that the learned
gossips wagged their tongues with
great rapdity. Quite to the con
trary, all this wailing and moan
ing was over the fact that a fum
bled ball wasn't dead enough.
In other words, while the defensive
players can either stand around suck
ing their thumbs when a hobbled ball
goes bouncing over the turf, or at the
best merely fall on it, the offensive
men are privileged to scoop up the
bloated pigskin and skip off down the
field —unless stopped by one of those
defensive lads who all the while have
been biting their finger nails in rage.
Thus, the new fumble rule makes
honest boys out of the defending
players, and sneaking culprits "who
work within the law" out of the ball
packers.
But this moral argument, as
most any erudite football fan or
two-year-old infant could figure
out, was not that used by a ma
jority of the new rule bemoaners.
They simply held that: (1) the
offensive teams had too big an
advantage, which (2) would lead
to a wide-open game with too
many scores, and (3) that some
of the extra-foxy coaches would
devise play's built around fumbles,
thus causing their teams to mis
play on purpose.
Naturally, Pop Warner was accused
of having a lot to do with this awful
metamorphosis. It seems that the Old
Fox has quite a reputation for pulling
off tricks that necessitate rule
changes.
This time Pop was thought to have
put one over on the experts and other
coaches, because of Stanford's open
style of play. Intricate handling of the
ball on tricky plays means a lot of
fumbles. Warner, of coui.se, wished to
protect his interests —so kidded the
Rules Committee into making the new
change.
Everyone knows now that these
gripes are all wet. Pop didn't have
a thing to do in causing this foot
ball revolt. And what is more, this
much - squawked - over revolution
has failed to take place as yet!
So far this year the style of play
has not been altered hardly at all.
Some teams opened up to some ex
tent, to be true, but none of them
have made hectic or radical changes.
Most outfits are as conservative as
ever.
Then too, the scores have not. as a
rule, been a bit larger than in years
gone past. And not once has there
been a roport of an intentional fumble
play.
So there is no wonder that the
fuming and fussing has died
down to a whisper, and that the
dear old autumn pastime goes on

as ever, attracting larger crowds
and gaining greater public inter
est as the weeks roll by.
ARMY MEETS HARVARD
Lest sons of the Stanford Red forget
that West Point still has a football
team, it is of interest to note that the
Army plays one of the most important
games in the East tomorrow. Coach
Biff Jones' men are scheduled to
tangle with the boys from good old
Harvard.
Unless an unusual upset occurs and
the wearers of the "H" show a little
more inclination to forget their
studies and mix it up a bit, the Army
Mule should win without even having
to stretch his legs. So far the Cadets
have come through with nothing less
than easy wins, and Captain Cagle
should lead his men to victory again
tomorrow.
West Point intends to keep its sea
son's record clean until December 28.
And on the 28th the Army men intend
to avenge last year's ill-treatment at
the hands of the Cards.

THAT DRASTIC FUMBLE RULE
Not bo long ago, just before the
various football teams from Coast to
Coast began to swing into action for
the 192SJ gridiron season, it was wide
ly rumored in pigskin circles that this
year would witness a drastic change
in tho dear old autumn pastime.
There would be, according to a
majority of the press bull-slingers,
grandstand coaches, and common
rabble gossipers, some sort of a
football revolution. And the rea
son for this 60-called Revolt in the
Stadiums was laid to a slight
variation in the wording of the
well-known fumble rule.
No longer can a defensive player
snatch up a fumbled ball and scamper
off down the greensward for a touch
down —or even toward his own goal
in Now Year's games. In fact, he can't
take a single step with the coveted
hide-bound oval. The ball is dead as
soon as a defending man wraps his
paws around it.
But it wasn't from pity over the
poor dead ball that the learned
gossips wagged their tongues with
great rapdity. Quite to the con
trary, all this wailing and moan
ing was over the fact that a fum
bled ball wasn't dead enough.
In other words, while the defensive
players can either stand around suck
ing their thumbs when a hobbled ball
goes bouncing over the turf, or at the
best merely fall on it, the offensive
men are privileged to scoop up the
bloated pigskin and skip off down the
field —unless stopped by one of those
defensive lads who all the while have
been biting their finger nails in rage.
Thus, the new fumble rule makes
honest boys out of the defending
players, and sneaking culprits "who
work within the law" out of the ball
packers.
But this moral argument, as
most any erudite football fan or
two-year-old infant could figure
out, was not that used by a ma
jority of the new rule bemoaners.
They simply held that: (1) the
offensive teams had too big an
advantage, which (2) would lead
to a wide-open game with too
many scores, and (3) that some
of the extra-foxy coaches would
devise play's built around fumbles,
thus causing their teams to mis
play on purpose.
Naturally, Pop Warner was accused
of having a lot to do with this awful
metamorphosis. It seems that the Old
Fox has quite a reputation for pulling
off tricks that necessitate rule
changes.
This time Pop was thought to have
put one over on the experts and other
coaches, because of Stanford's open
style of play. Intricate handling of the
ball on tricky plays means a lot of
fumbles. Warner, of coui.se, wished to
protect his interests —so kidded the
Rules Committee into making the new
change.
Everyone knows now that these
gripes are all wet. Pop didn't have
a thing to do in causing this foot
ball revolt. And what is more, this
much - squawked - over revolution
has failed to take place as yet!
So far this year the style of play
has not been altered hardly at all.
Some teams opened up to some ex
tent, to be true, but none of them
have made hectic or radical changes.
Most outfits are as conservative as
ever.
Then too, the scores have not. as a
rule, been a bit larger than in years
gone past. And not once has there
been a roport of an intentional fumble
play.
So there is no wonder that the
fuming and fussing has died
down to a whisper, and that the
dear old autumn pastime goes on

as ever, attracting larger crowds
and gaining greater public inter
est as the weeks roll by.

Most outfits are as conservative as

Then too, the scores have not. as a
rule, been a bit larger than in years
gone past. And not once has there
been a roport of an intentional fumble
play.

fuming and fussing has died
down to a whisper, and that the
dear old autumn pastime goes on

ARMY MEETS HARVARD
Lest sons of the Stanford Red forget
that West Point still has a football
team, it is of interest to note that the
Army plays one of the most important
games in the East tomorrow. Coach
Biff Jones' men are scheduled to
tangle with the boys from good old
Harvard.
Unless an unusual upset occurs and
the wearers of the "H" show a little
more inclination to forget their
studies and mix it up a bit, the Army
Mule should win without even having
to stretch his legs. So far the Cadets
have come through with nothing less
than easy wins, and Captain Cagle
should lead his men to victory again
tomorrow.
West Point intends to keep its sea
son's record clean until December 28.
And on the 28th the Army men intend
to avenge last year's ill-treatment at
the hands of the Cards.

THAT DRASTIC FUMBLE RULE
Not bo long ago, just before the
various football teams from Coast to
Coast began to swing into action for
the 192SJ gridiron season, it was wide
ly rumored in pigskin circles that this
year would witness a drastic change
in tho dear old autumn pastime.
There would be, according to a
majority of the press bull-slingers,
grandstand coaches, and common
rabble gossipers, some sort of a
football revolution. And the rea
son for this 60-called Revolt in the
Stadiums was laid to a slight
variation in the wording of the
well-known fumble rule.
No longer can a defensive player
snatch up a fumbled ball and scamper
off down the greensward for a touch
down —or even toward his own goal
in Now Year's games. In fact, he can't
take a single step with the coveted
hide-bound oval. The ball is dead as
soon as a defending man wraps his
paws around it.
But it wasn't from pity over the
poor dead ball that the learned
gossips wagged their tongues with
great rapdity. Quite to the con
trary, all this wailing and moan
ing was over the fact that a fum
bled ball wasn't dead enough.
In other words, while the defensive
players can either stand around suck
ing their thumbs when a hobbled ball
goes bouncing over the turf, or at the
best merely fall on it, the offensive
men are privileged to scoop up the
bloated pigskin and skip off down the
field —unless stopped by one of those
defensive lads who all the while have
been biting their finger nails in rage.
Thus, the new fumble rule makes
honest boys out of the defending
players, and sneaking culprits "who
work within the law" out of the ball
packers.
But this moral argument, as
most any erudite football fan or
two-year-old infant could figure
out, was not that used by a ma
jority of the new rule bemoaners.
They simply held that: (1) the
offensive teams had too big an
advantage, which (2) would lead
to a wide-open game with too
many scores, and (3) that some
of the extra-foxy coaches would
devise play's built around fumbles,
thus causing their teams to mis
play on purpose.
Naturally, Pop Warner was accused
of having a lot to do with this awful
metamorphosis. It seems that the Old
Fox has quite a reputation for pulling
off tricks that necessitate rule
changes.
This time Pop was thought to have
put one over on the experts and other
coaches, because of Stanford's open
style of play. Intricate handling of the
ball on tricky plays means a lot of
fumbles. Warner, of coui.se, wished to
protect his interests —so kidded the
Rules Committee into making the new
change.
Everyone knows now that these
gripes are all wet. Pop didn't have
a thing to do in causing this foot
ball revolt. And what is more, this
much - squawked - over revolution
has failed to take place as yet!
So far this year the style of play
has not been altered hardly at all.
Some teams opened up to some ex
tent, to be true, but none of them
have made hectic or radical changes.
Most outfits are as conservative as
ever.
