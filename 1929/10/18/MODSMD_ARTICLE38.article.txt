# GREYS MEET ST. IGNATIUS IN HARD GAME
## Pop Says Line Is Strong; Grey May Be Shifted To Backfield 
### 
"Best line we've met this year."
That is what Pop told some of the
boys about the Grays' forward wall
after their scrimmage with the var
sity the other night. Anyway, the var
sity had a tough time with the Grays,
who will meet the St. Ignatius Re
serves in the Stadium at 12:30 Satur
day in a preliminary to the 0.A.C.-
Stanford game.
Coach Cuddeback had the first- and
second-string Grays working out in a
snappy signal practice last night, and
the two strings seemed to be about
on a par. Hoxie, who played a good
game at fullback last Saturday, was
throwing some passes, as was Baker.
The first string was composed of
Northrup at quarter, Wilson and Gil
bert at halves, and Baker at full in
the backfield, and had Colvin and
Clark at end, Wilkin and Eby at
guard, Doub and Grey at tackle, and
Milligan at center. Keenan and Iloxie
were running with the second string.
Hand, big red-head at end, looked
good on the receiving end of a bunch
of passes.
Cuddeback gave Grey, the big
tackle, a chance to carry the ball and
throw a few passes. He tossed some
of the longest passes thrown during
the practice, and he sent them right
into the hands of the receivers. He
looked good on some running plays,
getting a quick start and handling
himself nicely.
The only first-string man injured is
Miller, who was not in uniform on
account of a sprained ligament. He is
expected to be ready for the game
Saturday, as the injury is slight.
As St. Ignatius has a strong varsity,
the reserves are expected to furnish
stiffer opposition to the Grays than
did tho Santa Barbara State Teachers
last week.
