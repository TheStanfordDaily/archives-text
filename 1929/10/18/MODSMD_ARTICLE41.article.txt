# TEMPLETON STARTS WORKOUTS TO PREPARE FOR COMING TRACK YEAR
## 
### 
Already pointing toward U.S.C., the
greatest obstacle in their march to
ward the Pacific Coast Championship
the Stanford track squad has begun
intensive fall training in the hopes
of being able to repeat the perform
ance of last year in bringing home not
only the Coast championship, but
1.C.4-A. honors also. Fourteen of last
year's lettermen will be eligible for
competition next spring which makes
a good nucleus for Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton to construct another winning
team.
Hec Dyer, last year's varsity sprint
star, should be a consistent winner in
the 100- and 220-yard dashes. His run
ning mates will be Les Hables, Giber
son, and Wayne Elwood, all three
in their first year of varsity compe
tition.. Giberson and Elwood were
frosh sprint stars last year.
Johnny Morrison, another 1.C.4-A.
winner, will bear the brunt of the
440 dash work with Ike Hables, who
ran up some good marks on the frosh
team last year, running with him. The
squad is noticeably weak in distance
runners, the only runners returning
being Neikirk, half-miler; Parker,
miler; Ray Griset and Brown, two
milers. Walt Cooper, of the class of
'32 will probably aid in the half-mile,
as will Storms, a transfer from U.S.C.
It will be up to Podge Smith to re
place that great pair of stick men,
Ward Edmonds and Ross Nichols, in
the high and low hurdles. Ernie Men
denhall, another last year's freshman
star, will probably be the best bet as
Smith's partner.
Captain Eric Krenz, Harlow Roth
ert, and McLeod, Stanford's famuos
weight trio, will all be back again.
'Nuff sed.
Perelli-Minetti is the lone survivor
of the varsity javelin throwers. He
threw his arm out early last year, but
should be in good shape by next
spring. Rudy Rintala of last year's
frosh should also do well in that
event.
Madison, a point-winner at Chicago
in the high jump, is returning, and
with him are Austin and Woodyat,
who were on the squad last year. In
the broad jump will be West and

Dowell, varsity lettermen. The loss of
Edmonds in the pole vault will be
keenly felt but Wes Berry and Ned
Johns will make a good attempt to
take his place. McDermott and Shove,
both members of last year's relay
team, are back and should turn out
excellent work next spring.
