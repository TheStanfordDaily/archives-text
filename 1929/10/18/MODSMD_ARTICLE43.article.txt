# NICK CARTER STORIES DEFENDED BY SWAIN IN CONVENTION TALK
## Did More to Stimulate Real Thinking Among Youth Than School Work 
### 
Nick Carter's red-blooded stories of
mystery and adventure did more to
aid thinking among the boys who
read them than any courses they
might have been taking in school at
the time, declared Dr. Swain, acting
president, speaking to a convention
of northern California teachers at
Sacramento. Dr. Swain returned to
the campus yesterday.
Dr. Swain expressed the belief that
with all the amazing increase in the
fund of human knowledge students
were in grave danger of too diversified
a diet.
Machine-like milling of information
to the millions now a part of the vast
mass education program of the nation
has undermined the power of think
ing and understanding, Dr. Swain
told his audience.
"Youth is viewing with more de
liberation than ever the problems of
future life. Students enter colleges
with a more definite hope to succeed
in life than a generation ago, but
fewer come with a definite mind as
to the achievement of success."
"The so-called white collar invasion
into industry is the symbol of a Jew
era, with the school bearing t' r , bur
den of transition."
Dr. Swain defended the junior col
leges as a terminal point in the pres
ent system for assimilation of the
high-school graduate, a testing station
serving as the clearing-house for uni
versities.
