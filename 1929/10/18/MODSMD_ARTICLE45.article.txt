Coach "Husky" Hunt and twenty
seven freshman football players left
last night for Los Angeles, where they
will meet the Southern California
yearlings tomorrow afternoon on the
greensward of the Coliseum. Although
Hunt's outfit has not made a perfect
record this season, they have been
pointing for the peagreeners from
Southern California all fall, and are
conceded an even chance to topple the
Sons of Troy.
The freshman game will hold the
spotlight in the Coliseum tomorrow
despite the fact that the Trojan var
sity meets Occidental on the same
card. It is the initial big game on the
Trobabes schedule, and is attracting
more attention than the varsity clash.
U.S.C. Uses Shift
The baby Redshirts will have their
work cut out for them, as they will
go up against a different offense than
any they have encountered this sea
son. The U.S.C. attack, with shifting
line and backfield, may be difficult
for the Cards to solve, but the locals
have just as much potential strength
as the downstate squad, and an equal
chance to come out on top.
Coach Aubry Devine's charges
fought their way to a 13 to 0 victory
over the strong Chaffey Junior Col
lege eleven last Saturday to keep their
slate free from setbacks, and in so

put up a good battle for varsity
berths next season. Orville Mohler,
Trojan halfback, is expected to give
the Cards plenty of trouble. He is a
I classy ball-toter, and presents the
I biggest threat on the U.S.C. squad.
Running in combination with Moh
ler in the Troy backiield, are Kirk
wood and Kates, two shifty backs,
j Tipton, the fourth man in the Trojan
backfield, while not quite ranking on
! par with Mohler, is a capable open
-1 field runner, and always a dangerous
( man on the offense.
Coach "Husky" Hunt last night an
l nounced that he would start Boushey
at quarter instead of Targhetta, who
has been calling signals for the frosh.
j Although somewhat lighter than
Targhetta, Boushey has shown re-
I markable field generalship in last
week's practice, and is expected to
j get along well at the digit-calling posi

Cards Must Improve Offense
i The large number of hard games to
date, have of necessity not given
Hunt a chance to perfect an offense,
j but this week he has been concentrat
j ing on an aerial attack which should
work successfully against the Tro
jans. Santa Clara used a seven-man
| line on the defensive; U.S.C. will use
i six men in the forward wall. It takes
