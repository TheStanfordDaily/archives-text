# BE ON TIME OR STAY AT HOME

Some days ago the Daily commented upon the fact that the Stanford
L T niversity community has been neglecting an intellectual gold mine in the
lecture series presented here every quarter.
And the Daily is gratified to observe the increased attendance at the
talks being given by the distinguished British diplomat and laborite,
George Young.
This newspaper hopes it is responsible for the larger turnouts, but if
anything said in these columns was responsible for the attendance of a
certain portion of the audience, then the Daily hangs its editorial head.
The portion of the audience in question is that which arrives between
7: 30 and 8 o'clock. The lecture is scheduled to begin—and does begin—
at 7: 30. Those who arrive on time, however, have a difficult time hearing
what is said because of the latecomers who shuffle down the aisles to
choice seats in front. The Assembly Hall has long been noted for its poor
acoustic qualities which make talks difficult enough to hear under the best
circumstances. When the usual stream of late comers arrives the continu
ity of the speech is constantly interrupted.
An interesting feature of the situation is that the tardy delegation
varies but little in membership from week to week ; from month to month ;
from year to year. Students, faculty members, and Palo Altans each form
their quota.
If these people cannot observe the rules of punctuality and common
courtesy (and apparently they cannot), the Committee on Public Exer
cises should see that the doors are securely locked after 7: 30 and are kept
locked until the speaker is finished.
