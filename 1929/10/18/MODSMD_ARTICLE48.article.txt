Stanford is host today to college newspaper men from twelve insti
tutions of the Pacific Coast, who have gathered here for the annual con
vention of the Pacific Intercollegiate Press.
The editors and business managers who are here as delegates from
their publications will attempt to improve relations between the various
Pacific Coast college papers.
These relations involve practical matters such as advertising and the
dissemination of college news; but behind them lies something more im
portant —the maintenance and improvement of relations between the
schools themselves.
These college newspaper men are admittedly in a position to discourage
enmity and to increase good sportsmanship and fellowship between the
institutions they represent. If they can agree to work together on some
fixed plan, they have taken a forward step for all the colleges and univer
sities involved.
