# HIGH, LOW, OR INTERMEDIATE
## 
### 
Our idea of the height of something or other is to laboriously mark a
ticket application "center" and "middle"; to break all speed laws getting
the application in on the first day; to sit back and smile at some negligent
individual who was slower; and then get a choice pair of seats in Row 2,
Section Z. Judging from the lusty complaints heard everywhere these
days, there is no limit to the number of seats available directly behind the
goal posts.
