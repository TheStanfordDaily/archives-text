# YOUNG DECLARES U.S., BRITAIN AT MORAL EQUALITY
## Changes in Naval Warfare Will Make Battleship Mere Technicality 
### 
"We have established moral parity
between two peoples," said George
Young, British diplomat, referring to
the United States and Great Britain
in his lecture, "Command and Free
dom of the Seas," last night in the
Assembly Hall. "Now it is up to the
individual to work for moral disarma
ment.
"Moral disarmament can be achiev
ed by looking at the coming five-power
naval limitations conference from the
point of view of two nations attempt
ing to do away with one of the great
est irritations of war."
The British labor leader declared
that conditions should be dealt with
fundamentally.
Terms Lose Reality
"The London Conference in Janu
ary should leave the technicalities of
disarmament alone, for fear of get
ting hopelessly tied up in them, as
past naval conferences have done.
The terms of naval strength have lost
reality, due to the revolution in naval
warfare and strategy.
"Future battles on the sea will not
be fought between surface ships, but
will be characterized by undersea and
oversea fighting. Cruisers and battle
ships will mean nothing in future en
counters. It is a waste of time to arbi
trate on the limitation of them."
Young advanced the argument of
restriction of water areas as another
step toward abolishing the friction
points of war. He cited the restric
tion of the English Channel as a cure
for trouble between France and Eng
land.
International Law Changed
"There also has been a revolution
in our law between nations. No longer
does war have any legal status, if
international covenants mean any
thing.
"The Lions, Eagles, and Bears of
nationality should be allowed to die
in the deluge of war," he concluded,
"and the nations of the world should
replace them with the symbol of the
Dove of Peace."
