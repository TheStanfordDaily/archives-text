# A 						TANGLE OF CIRCUMSTANCES
## 
### 
Law, logic, and ethics seem to be in a futile tangle by virtue of recent
contradictory rulings concerning the arrest of purchasers of intoxicating
liquors. While a Circuit Court of Appeals sitting in Philadelphia has ruled
that the buyer is immune from arrest under the Volstead Act, a federal
judge in Kentucky holds that buyers do violate the law and has instructed
the Grand Jury to indict rum purchasers.
Meanwhile Congress is showing interest in the Sheppard Bill which
proposes to amend the Volstead Act to specifically allow prosecution of
buyers as well as sellers of liquor.
Pending all the necessary interpretations by the Supreme Court on a
proposed test case, the wets and drys have taken a stand that appears to
be incongruous with their convictions. The wets, of course, do not want
to be liable for arrest when they purchase beverages. But they see a
boomerang effect of the proposed Sheppard Bill and the Kentucky ruling
in that a definite classification of purchasers as law violators will increase
the resentment against the Volstead law and the Eighteenth Amendment.
Dry leaders, while they believe that the buyer is as guilty as the seller,
see the same possible kick-back.
As it is now, some drys want buyers prosecuted and some do not, with
the wets in approximately the same position.
It appears possible that the Supreme Court decision on the question
of purchase will provide the turning point in the prohibition controversy.
In case purchase is made legal, bootlegging could increase to uncontrol
lable projwrtions.
Meanwhile, the existing tangle of circumstances and opinions appears
ludicrous to the neutral layman since both wets and drys arc uncertain of
their ground and their opinions arc futile without legal confirmation or
negation.
