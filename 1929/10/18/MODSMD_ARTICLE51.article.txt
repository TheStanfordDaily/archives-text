A SCHOOL OF WIVES, Andre
Gide. Dodd, Mead & Co., New
York, 1929. At the Alcove Book
Shop.
A real book lover will feel the same
reaction toward this book of Andre
Gide's that an art connoisseur feels for
a rare and perfect etching. But em
phatically "A School for Wives" is not
for tlx* general taste. Most readers
would admit at once that they did not
care for it, some would confess that even
while they perceived and appreciated its
fineness they preferred other books, and
only a very few would sincerely and un
reservedly enjoy the book.
The reason for this is obvious enough.
"A School for Wives" is a very slight
work, little more than a sketch represent
ing the diary of a French girl, well born
and cultured, in which are recounted her
thoughts and feelings about her husband.
The diary has two true divisions: the
first includes the period of the young
girl's engagement and the first months
of her marriage. Part two concerns
what she experiences twenty years later.
The author's conception is to show the
gradual disillusionment of the girl con
cerning the man she has married. In
doing so he traces both the character of
the girl and that of the husband, only a
stroke at a time, but each stroke so care
ful and so significant that as each page
is turned the portraits of both take an
even clearer form in the reader's mind.
Andre Gide's reputation as a profound
writer of distinguished prose in no way
suffer's from this last effort. The sketch
is beautifully done in a style that is the
perfection of simplicity and reticence. It
is in fact almost too simple, so that the
casual reader could easily overlook in the
girl's naive and artless confessions the
import that lies beneath them.
This would be a great pity, for the
reader would of course miss the entire
point of the character delineation: the
subtle, ironic revelation of an incredibly
bombastic, conceited, and selfish man.
What is worse, he might even fall under
the impression that here was a poor imi
tation of Anita Loos' style—an exces
sively poor one, with all the life, and
sparkle, and clever, slangy wit taken out,
and only the tiresome naivete left.
Later in the sketch the style changes,
to fit the maturity and experienced eyes
of the writer of the diary. Then the lines
become harder and more cynical, and the
tragedy of th<T woman's inevitable and
bitter disillusionment ends the book with
extreme effectiveness.

The DANCE OF LIFE, Varsity.
The stage show "Burlesque" lost noth
ing in its transition to the talking screen.
Paramount changed the name to "The
Dance of Life," gave Nancy Carroll the
part of Bonny, thickened it with some
good singing and dancing, and in all
handled every phase to good advantage.
Even though it is set in the time-worn
backstage atmosphere, with tank-town
players sighing for their "big chance' 'at
the Palace, it would be hard not to enjoy
this opera.
Hal Skelly, Broadway creator of the
role of Skid, the no-good hoofer, suc
cessfully brings his talent to us in the
Hollywood version. In fact, Skid is so
no-good that you begin to wonder why
a little honey like Bonny would show
him such unfailing loyalty. However, her
alternative in the picture is a big sap
from North Platte or thereabouts whose
idea of a big time is to sit on the veranda
of his rancho and think, and sometimes
just to sit.
May Boley is in the cast as the wise
and wise-cracking old trouper who brings
a generous share of laughs. Best of all
is the luntlicrous "beef trust" chorus, a
ponderous array of ladies of the en
semble to support la Boley in some of the
song and dance numbers.

"A School for Wives" is a very slight
work, little more than a sketch represent
ing the diary of a French girl, well born
and cultured, in which are recounted her
thoughts and feelings about her husband.
The diary has two true divisions: the
first includes the period of the young
girl's engagement and the first months
of her marriage. Part two concerns
what she experiences twenty years later.
The author's conception is to show the
gradual disillusionment of the girl con
cerning the man she has married. In
doing so he traces both the character of
the girl and that of the husband, only a
stroke at a time, but each stroke so care
ful and so significant that as each page
is turned the portraits of both take an
even clearer form in the reader's mind.
Andre Gide's reputation as a profound
writer of distinguished prose in no way
suffer's from this last effort. The sketch
is beautifully done in a style that is the
perfection of simplicity and reticence. It
is in fact almost too simple, so that the
casual reader could easily overlook in the
girl's naive and artless confessions the
import that lies beneath them.
This would be a great pity, for the
reader would of course miss the entire
point of the character delineation: the
subtle, ironic revelation of an incredibly
bombastic, conceited, and selfish man.
What is worse, he might even fall under
the impression that here was a poor imi
tation of Anita Loos' style—an exces
sively poor one, with all the life, and
sparkle, and clever, slangy wit taken out,
and only the tiresome naivete left.
Later in the sketch the style changes,
to fit the maturity and experienced eyes
of the writer of the diary. Then the lines
become harder and more cynical, and the
tragedy of th<T woman's inevitable and
bitter disillusionment ends the book with
extreme effectiveness.

The DANCE OF LIFE, Varsity.
The stage show "Burlesque" lost noth
ing in its transition to the talking screen.
Paramount changed the name to "The
Dance of Life," gave Nancy Carroll the
part of Bonny, thickened it with some
good singing and dancing, and in all
handled every phase to good advantage.
Even though it is set in the time-worn
backstage atmosphere, with tank-town
players sighing for their "big chance' 'at
the Palace, it would be hard not to enjoy
this opera.
Hal Skelly, Broadway creator of the
role of Skid, the no-good hoofer, suc
cessfully brings his talent to us in the
Hollywood version. In fact, Skid is so
no-good that you begin to wonder why
a little honey like Bonny would show
him such unfailing loyalty. However, her
alternative in the picture is a big sap
from North Platte or thereabouts whose
idea of a big time is to sit on the veranda
of his rancho and think, and sometimes
just to sit.
May Boley is in the cast as the wise
and wise-cracking old trouper who brings
a generous share of laughs. Best of all
is the luntlicrous "beef trust" chorus, a
ponderous array of ladies of the en
semble to support la Boley in some of the
song and dance numbers.

even clearer form in the reader's mind.
Andre Gide's reputation as a profound
writer of distinguished prose in no way
suffer's from this last effort. The sketch
is beautifully done in a style that is the
perfection of simplicity and reticence. It
is in fact almost too simple, so that the
casual reader could easily overlook in the
girl's naive and artless confessions the
import that lies beneath them.
This would be a great pity, for the
reader would of course miss the entire
point of the character delineation: the
subtle, ironic revelation of an incredibly
bombastic, conceited, and selfish man.
What is worse, he might even fall under
the impression that here was a poor imi
tation of Anita Loos' style—an exces
sively poor one, with all the life, and
sparkle, and clever, slangy wit taken out,
and only the tiresome naivete left.
Later in the sketch the style changes,
to fit the maturity and experienced eyes
of the writer of the diary. Then the lines
become harder and more cynical, and the
tragedy of th<T woman's inevitable and
bitter disillusionment ends the book with
extreme effectiveness.

The DANCE OF LIFE, Varsity.
The stage show "Burlesque" lost noth
ing in its transition to the talking screen.
Paramount changed the name to "The
Dance of Life," gave Nancy Carroll the
part of Bonny, thickened it with some
good singing and dancing, and in all
handled every phase to good advantage.
Even though it is set in the time-worn
backstage atmosphere, with tank-town
players sighing for their "big chance' 'at
the Palace, it would be hard not to enjoy
this opera.
Hal Skelly, Broadway creator of the
role of Skid, the no-good hoofer, suc
cessfully brings his talent to us in the
Hollywood version. In fact, Skid is so
no-good that you begin to wonder why
a little honey like Bonny would show
him such unfailing loyalty. However, her
alternative in the picture is a big sap
from North Platte or thereabouts whose
idea of a big time is to sit on the veranda
of his rancho and think, and sometimes
just to sit.
May Boley is in the cast as the wise
and wise-cracking old trouper who brings
a generous share of laughs. Best of all
is the luntlicrous "beef trust" chorus, a
ponderous array of ladies of the en
semble to support la Boley in some of the
song and dance numbers.
