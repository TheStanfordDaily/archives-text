BROADWAY BABIES, New Stan
ford.
Just the same old thing, and in the
same old way! Pure chorus girl, crooked
stage-door Johns; homely, ambitious
stage manager in love with pure chorus
girl. Big-hearted millionaire gets glimpse
of heaven through love for pure chorus
girl, gets bullet from crooks, gives pure
chorus girl up to ambitious, homely stage
manager. Girl becomes Broadway star.
"Broadway Babies" is trite if anything
ever was.
But it serves as pretty good entertain
ment if you like the old song-and-dance.
Alice White, as the pure chorus girl, is
satisfactory, being a good dancer and a
fair singer as that kind sing. There is
good chorus work in several of the
Broadway and cabaret scenes, but noth
ing extraordinary. Charles Delaney, play
ing opposite Alice White, makes a very
homely, and quite ambitious, stage man
ager. Altogether, this is nothing new and
nothing different, but it's all right if you
are not particular.
