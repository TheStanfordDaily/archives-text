Uniformity of freshman athletic
sweater awards was advocated by an
editorial appearing in the Daily of
October 18.
The editorial read: "Until last year
the emblem was a regulation cardinal
sweater bearing large class numerals
in white. Last year the freshmen
changed to red sweater-vests with
small numerals. The result of such
changes, if continued, will be a con
glomeration of numerals so varied
that no one will be able to distinguish
between the different emblems and
know for just what branches of ath

letics they stand. The white sweater
with large red numerals seems to be
an appropriate design for the fresh
man crew.
