# CAMPUS OPINION
## FOR MUSIC LOVERS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Conversation with a number of people
has convinced me that there is a need on
this campus for an opportunity to learn
and sing folk-music. An invitation is
therefore issued to any or all, young, old,
male, female, songsters and otherwise,
who revel in Elizabethan lyrics, French
chansons, etc., to meet together Sunday
evenings at 7:30 o'clock on the third
floor of the Women's Clubhouse.
We shall start this Sunday on negro
spirituals, but the group will of course
decide upon what it wishes to proceed.
There will be no organization, no
auspices, no appearances; and whether
there be many or few is a matter of in
difference, as long as they are interested.
â€”Ruby Turner
