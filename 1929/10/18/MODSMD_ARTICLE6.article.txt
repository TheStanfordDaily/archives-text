# VARSITY SOCCER MEN OPEN SCHEDULE WITH S.F. ROVERS SATURDAY
## 
### 
In direct competition with the Stan
ford-Oregon State conference football
game, Coach Harry Maloney's varsity
soccer team will clash with the cham
pionship Rover aggregation from San
Francisco Saturday, 3 p.m., in the ini
tial contest on the Cardinal schedule.
Stiff scrimmages between the first
and second string teams have marked
the varsity practice sessions of the
past two weeks and Maloney feels
that his men are in far better than
average condition for the first appear
ance. Good reserve material is espe
cially plentiful this year, in the line
particularly, and two complete sets
of forwards will probably be used.
Although no definite backfield lineup
has been announced, Burne and Dal
ton will probably start at the fullback
positions. Christensen, Captain Mayer,
and Reynolds at the halves, and either
Wight or Williamson at goal.
