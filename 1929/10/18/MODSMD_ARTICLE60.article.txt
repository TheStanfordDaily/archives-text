# THE 						SIX GREATEST DRAWING CARDS
## 
### Feg Murray 
Who were the six best drawing
cards of all time in American sport
history, choosing only one man for
each sport? Who were the "Six Best
Sellers," those whose names sold
more tickets at the box offices than
any other —the half-dozen greatest
gate attractions since Pop Anson was
rattling the sides of his crib and de
manding a bat, ball, and glove?
Jack Dempsey? By all means!
Where John L. Sullivan drew thou
sands, the Manassa Mauler drew mil
lions. Babe Ruth? Righto! "The house
that Ruth built," otherwise known as
the Yankee stadium, is must evidence
of the power over the public that the

Sultan of Swat held —and still holds.
Bobby Jones? Yea bo! He outdraws
Hagen and any other golfer, and if
he chose to turn pro he could make
twice as much money, which would
run him up into six figures. When he
was eliminated at Pebble Beach, the
tournament fell flat.
Big Bill Tliden is our choice in the
realm of tennis. They didn't have sta
diums for tennis until he came along,
and in 1928, the one year in the last
dozen or so in which he was missing
from the national championship tour
nament, the crowds dwindled aston
ishingly. Man O' War? Yes, indeed!
Not a human being, but a very color
ful animal nevertheless, and a great

horse, one of the greatest of all time.
A consistent winner and a consistent
gate attraction, the biggest drawing
card of any American horse in history.
Let's see, that includes boxing, base
ball, racing (and wash't Sande, the
jockey, with the biggest box office ap
peal?), golf and tennis, and brings us
down (or up) to football. But first let
me suggest that if you want to leave
out Man O' War and stick to person
alities, list track and put down Nurmi.
Paavo was a packer-in when it came
to public appearances, and, boy, didn't
he know it!
So now we turn to football, the
greatest sport of all! Jim Thorpe had
color, romance, all-around ability be

yond any other athlete, yet he wasn't
football's greatest drawing card. Men
like George Wilson of Washington,
Ernie Nevers of Stanford, Ken Strong
of New York University, and Cagle
of the Army have probably drawn
more people to see them perform than
the great Carlisle Indian ever did, but
that was before the days when sports
were "overemphasized." No, it re
mained for a well-publicized individ
ual, the story of whose gridiron deeds
re-echoed from Maine to California,
to cause the turnstiles to click both as
an amateur and as a pro beyond all
other grid stars. Red Grange of Illi
nois! He was the greatest drawing
card football has ever known.
