# CAMPUS GOLF COURSE WILL CONTAIN UNIQUE FEATURES; READY IN JANUARY
## 
### Joe Gordon 
Creating enthusiastic comment up and
down the Pacific Coast by famous golf
ers who have seen it, Stanford's new
golf course promises to be one of the
finest in the country. It is now practi
cally finished and only the softness of the
greens and fairways prevent it from be
ing opened to the public.
No expense has been spared in design
ing, constructing, and beautifying the
course, which, coupled with the fact that
the natural topography of the location
makes it an ideal site for such a course,
should make Stanford a headquarters for
coast golfers.
Is Ideal for Tournaments
The course presents many unique fea
tures, perhaps the most unusual of which
is the larger number of holes and tecs
that are in close proximity to the club
house. The course is designed in a fan
shape around the clubhouse and the first,
seventh, tenth, twelfth, and fifteenth holes
arc all within 20 yards of it.
1 his alone is enough to make it a good i
course for match play from the specta- j
tor's standpoint, but the fact that the 1
ninth, eleventh, and fourteenth greens as I
well as the tenth, twelfth, and fifteenth j
tees arc all grouped together around a
wooded knoll which will accommodate
several hundred watchers, makes it prac

tically ideal for match and tournament
play.
Every effort has been made to make the
course look natural and to keep the many
stately oak trees which cover it. The re
sult has been several very attractive holes.
The third, eighth, and fourteenth holes
cross the creek that runs through the
course. The ninth hole is of the "bottle
neck" type. The twelfth hole will prob
ably be the feature hole of the course as
it has a double fairway with a long line
of large oak trees separating the two ap
proaches to the green. The fifteenth hole
is in a "punch bowl" on top of a hill. The
eighteenth hole is a beautiful down-hill
finishing hole.
Large Number of Tees
Another unusual feature of the course
is the large number of tees. There are
32 separate tecs, which fact makes it pos
sible to use the course for championship,
standard, or ladies' play. When the cham
pionship tees are used the course is 6615
yards long. The standard tees make it
6435 yards long and the ladies' tees make
it somewhat shorter.
Practically every fairway is of the
"dog-leg" variety and nearly every hole
j has several optional approaches. The
■ coursc is so designed as to make it fairly
I easy going for the average player but to
the skilled golfer. It is beautifully
trapped and the traps are, for the most
present many dangerous temptations to
part, placed on the sides of the greens.
Since all the greens are elevated this
means that the traps can be easily drained
and will always be dry. Fifty-two car
loads of white sand from Marysville were
used in constructing the traps.
The grass on the greens and fairways
has grown rapidly but it is still being
watered and rolled and it is very doubtful
whether the course will be opened for
play before January 1, 1930.

is the large number of tees. There are
32 separate tecs, which fact makes it pos
sible to use the course for championship,
standard, or ladies' play. When the cham
pionship tees are used the course is 6615
yards long. The standard tees make it
6435 yards long and the ladies' tees make
it somewhat shorter.
Practically every fairway is of the
"dog-leg" variety and nearly every hole
j has several optional approaches. The
■ coursc is so designed as to make it fairly
I easy going for the average player but to
the skilled golfer. It is beautifully
trapped and the traps are, for the most
present many dangerous temptations to
part, placed on the sides of the greens.
Since all the greens are elevated this
means that the traps can be easily drained
and will always be dry. Fifty-two car
loads of white sand from Marysville were
used in constructing the traps.
The grass on the greens and fairways
has grown rapidly but it is still being
watered and rolled and it is very doubtful
whether the course will be opened for
play before January 1, 1930.

Creating enthusiastic comment up and
down the Pacific Coast by famous golf
ers who have seen it, Stanford's new
golf course promises to be one of the
finest in the country. It is now practi
cally finished and only the softness of the
greens and fairways prevent it from be
ing opened to the public.
No expense has been spared in design
ing, constructing, and beautifying the
course, which, coupled with the fact that
the natural topography of the location
makes it an ideal site for such a course,
should make Stanford a headquarters for
coast golfers.
Is Ideal for Tournaments
The course presents many unique fea
tures, perhaps the most unusual of which
is the larger number of holes and tecs
that are in close proximity to the club
house. The course is designed in a fan
shape around the clubhouse and the first,
seventh, tenth, twelfth, and fifteenth holes
arc all within 20 yards of it.
1 his alone is enough to make it a good i
course for match play from the specta- j
tor's standpoint, but the fact that the 1
ninth, eleventh, and fourteenth greens as I
well as the tenth, twelfth, and fifteenth j
tees arc all grouped together around a
wooded knoll which will accommodate
several hundred watchers, makes it prac

tically ideal for match and tournament
play.
Every effort has been made to make the
course look natural and to keep the many
stately oak trees which cover it. The re
sult has been several very attractive holes.
The third, eighth, and fourteenth holes
cross the creek that runs through the
course. The ninth hole is of the "bottle
neck" type. The twelfth hole will prob
ably be the feature hole of the course as
it has a double fairway with a long line
of large oak trees separating the two ap
proaches to the green. The fifteenth hole
is in a "punch bowl" on top of a hill. The
eighteenth hole is a beautiful down-hill
finishing hole.

32 separate tecs, which fact makes it pos

Creating enthusiastic comment up and
down the Pacific Coast by famous golf
ers who have seen it, Stanford's new
golf course promises to be one of the
finest in the country. It is now practi
cally finished and only the softness of the
greens and fairways prevent it from be
ing opened to the public.
No expense has been spared in design
ing, constructing, and beautifying the
course, which, coupled with the fact that
the natural topography of the location
makes it an ideal site for such a course,
should make Stanford a headquarters for
coast golfers.
Is Ideal for Tournaments
The course presents many unique fea
tures, perhaps the most unusual of which
is the larger number of holes and tecs
that are in close proximity to the club
house. The course is designed in a fan
shape around the clubhouse and the first,
seventh, tenth, twelfth, and fifteenth holes
arc all within 20 yards of it.
1 his alone is enough to make it a good i
course for match play from the specta- j
tor's standpoint, but the fact that the 1
ninth, eleventh, and fourteenth greens as I
well as the tenth, twelfth, and fifteenth j
tees arc all grouped together around a
wooded knoll which will accommodate
several hundred watchers, makes it prac

tically ideal for match and tournament
play.
Every effort has been made to make the
course look natural and to keep the many
stately oak trees which cover it. The re
sult has been several very attractive holes.
The third, eighth, and fourteenth holes
cross the creek that runs through the
course. The ninth hole is of the "bottle
neck" type. The twelfth hole will prob
ably be the feature hole of the course as
it has a double fairway with a long line
of large oak trees separating the two ap
proaches to the green. The fifteenth hole
is in a "punch bowl" on top of a hill. The
eighteenth hole is a beautiful down-hill
finishing hole.
Large Number of Tees
Another unusual feature of the course
is the large number of tees. There are
32 separate tecs, which fact makes it pos
sible to use the course for championship,
standard, or ladies' play. When the cham
pionship tees are used the course is 6615
yards long. The standard tees make it
6435 yards long and the ladies' tees make
it somewhat shorter.
Practically every fairway is of the
"dog-leg" variety and nearly every hole
j has several optional approaches. The
■ coursc is so designed as to make it fairly
I easy going for the average player but to
the skilled golfer. It is beautifully
trapped and the traps are, for the most
present many dangerous temptations to
part, placed on the sides of the greens.
Since all the greens are elevated this
means that the traps can be easily drained
and will always be dry. Fifty-two car
loads of white sand from Marysville were
used in constructing the traps.
The grass on the greens and fairways
has grown rapidly but it is still being
watered and rolled and it is very doubtful
whether the course will be opened for
play before January 1, 1930.
