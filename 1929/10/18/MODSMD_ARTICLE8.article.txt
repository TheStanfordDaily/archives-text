# DOMINIONS TO HAVE VOICE IN DISARMAMENT
## Stimson Chosen by Hoover To Head U.S. Delegates To London Meet 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17.
Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of
State, has been determined upon
by President Hoover as head of
the American delegation to the
London naval limitations confer
ence in January.
OTTAWA, Oct. 17. (&)—'The world
mind on disarmament must become
settled before world peace is at
tained, in the opinion of Ramsay Mac-
Donald.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain
expressed this view today soon after
his arrival at the Government House
where he had come from Toronto for
a three-day visit with Premier Mac-
Kenzie King, with whom he will dis
cuss Canada's part in the peace move
ment he instituted with President
Hoover.
He said his purpose in visiting
America was to create an atmosphere
favorable to a further conference on
the naval question, and the issue em
braced much more than the attitude
of the two pioneering countries in the
peace maneuver —England and the
United States. No arrangements would
be effected at the London conference
in January, he said, without the knowl
edge and consent of each of the Brit
ish dominions, and final agreements
will rest with the United States,
Great Britain, Japan, France, and
Italy.
