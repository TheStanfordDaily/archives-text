Burgess Speaks
"The newspaper man is right on
the firing line. Life is hot. The man
who gets into the rhythm of the game
never gets old," declared R. L. Bur
gess, editorial writer of the San Fran
cisco Examiner, at the Friday evening
banquet of the Press Association in
the Old Union.
"In a profession where we like to
feel that our haircuts do not come as
often as usual," he continued, "and
where our trousers are apt to be
frayed, it is hard to lay down a set
of fast rules. The young journalist
should enter the profession with the
idea of Marcus Aurelius fixed perma
nently in his mind: 'Nothing is per
manent but change.' "
Burgess' speech was the high point
in the two days of discussion among
the score of Pacific Coast college
journalists meeting here Friday and
Saturday with the Stanford Daily as
host.
