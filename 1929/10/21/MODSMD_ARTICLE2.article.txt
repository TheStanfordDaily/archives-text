# HUMANISM INADEQUATE AS RELIGION, TOPIC OF RABBI NEWMAN'S TALK
## 
### 
Inadequacy of humanism as a satis
factory religion for mankind was the
theme of Rabbi Newman's sermon in
the Memorial Chapel yesterday. "Hu
manism exists solely for the better
ment of man," Rabbi Newman said,
"and does not take cognizance of the
tendency to worship that is in the
human breast. Religion cannot be
founded finally on fact; we must feel
it."
Rabbi Newman traced the develop
ment of humanism and differentiated
the modern humanism from the classi
cal, which was a movement of intel
lectual and cultural enlightenment.
He said that it was characteristic of
the democratic doctrine of religious
freedom that there should constantly
be new attempts to formulate ideas of
religion. Humanism is such an at
tempt; liberalism was such an at
tempt, but now is largely negative.
The music of the Emanuel temple
service liturgy was directed by Can
tor Ruben Rinder, who trained the
Stanford Choir for the service Sunday.
