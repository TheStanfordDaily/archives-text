# THE 						'DINKY' IS DEAD HAIL TO THE BUSSES NO MOURNING RITES
## 
### 
Contrary to the expectations
of many enthusiastic freshmen,
no last rites were staged when
the last "Dinky" wabbled un
steadily down the tracks for the
final trip last night.
Becoming suspicious because
of rumors about the campus that
a celebration was being planned,
officials discontinued the service
earlier than the time previously
announced and pranksters were
left wondering at the campus
terminus when the last scheduled
car failed to appear.
No funeral wake with its
mourning procession followed the
last car to its final resting place.
No one was present to weep at
the passing of the creaking old
"Dinky" which has served gener
ations of Stanford men.
Unmourned, the old car wa
vered down the track, out of the
life of Stanford. The "Dinky" is
dead, fellows. Brave old buggy!
