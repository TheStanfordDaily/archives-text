# STANFORD GRAYS IN 20-0 WIN OVER ST. IGNATIUS RESERVES
## Gray Fog No Threat, Prove Easy Victims for Fast Stanford Squad 
### 
With the backfield functioning well
behind a fast charging line, the Stan
ford Grays easily defeated the St.
Ignatius Reserves at the Stadium
Saturday by a score of 20 to 0. The
score does not indicate the superiority
of the Grays, who scored at will in
the first quarter and only slowed
down when the coaches gave the sub
stitutes a chance at the start of the
second period.
With Baker doing most of the heavy
work, including the passing and carry
ing, the Grays scored two touchdowns
in the first period. The line opened
up good holes for the backs. Then
with St. Ignatius backed up against
its own goal line, a swarm of Gray
linesmen rushed in to block an at
tempted punt, and Doub, tackle, who
was captain of last year's frosh, fell
on the ball over the goal line for a
touchdown. Grey was called out of the
line to convert and made two of the
trys good. The other was blocked.
Keenan, a transfei from Menlo Jun
ior College, showed well at half dial
ing the rest of the game, though there
was no more scoring. Nortlirup at
quarter also showed well, but the St.
Ignatius Reserves managed to stave
off a number of threats at their goal
line. The Saints did little threatening
on their own account, however, show
ing more defensive than offensive abil
ity.
The starting lineup included Colvin
and Hand, ends; Miller and Hunt,
guards; Doub and Grey, tackles;
Quirk, center; Hardy, quarter; Gilbert
and Wilson, halves; and Baker, full.
