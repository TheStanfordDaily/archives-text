# TEAMMATE SUBMITS 'BIFF' HOFFMAN FEAT TO RIPLEY COLUMN
## 
### 
Now the attention of Ripley has
been called to Clifford "Biff" Hoffman,
Stanford's former grid captain and
track star.
"Believe it or not, but Biff Hoffman
lighted a match, stuck in the ground
with the head up, at 49 feet 6 inches
with the 16-pound shot and did not
knock over or break â€ž the match."
Hodge Davidson, '29, 707 Twenty-third
avenue, San Francisco, submitted this
in the "Believe it or not" contest con
ducted by the San Francisco Exam
iner and won a first prize. Davidson
was an end on the '28 varsity which
Biff captained.
Hodge further explained the feat.
"Biff was practicing with the 16-
pound shot during the 1927 track sea
son and made a mighty heave of 49
feet 6 inches. Bill Ellington, assistant
track coach, marked the spot where
the shot landed by sticking a match
in the ground with the head up. Biff's
next put grazed the head of the match,
lighting it without breaking or moving
it, and left it blazing merrily."
