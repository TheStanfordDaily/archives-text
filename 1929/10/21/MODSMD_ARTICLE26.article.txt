# STANFORD FACES S.C. AFTER EASY O.S.C WIN, 40-7
## Last Threat of Northwest Trampled; Beaver Eleven Offers Little Resistance Expect Whole Squad To Be Ready for S.C.; Heiser Is Only Possible Exception 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Successfully checking the last threat
of the Pacific Northwest with an easy
40 to 7 win over Oregon State on Sat
urday, Coach Pop Warner's big Cardi
nal varsity will get down to real work
this afternoon in preparation for
U.S.C.
The Beaver game was a mere work
out for the Cards, the latter taking
Oregon State in stride as was ex
pected. Coach Warner took no chances
in having his team bunged up for the
Thundering Herd invasion, and let
his second- and third-string charges
play more than half of the game.
Ex-Cripples Return
As a result, no additional cripples
were added to Stanford's large and
ever-swelling hospital list. Lud Frent
rup sustained a slightly bruised foot
but will lie out for practice today. All
of the ex-crutch-carriers who viewed
Saturday's struggle from the bench,
including Harlow Rothert, Bill Sim
kins, Johnny Preston, and Pete Hei
ser, are scheduled to work out with
the rest of the team. The only pos
sible exception is Heiser, whose knee
may prevent him from starting in the
Southern Cal game.
Although Stanford displayed the
smoothest brand of ball to date in
downing the Beavers, several glaring
weaknesses, which must be eliminated
within the next five practice sessions,
stood out at times. In the first place,
the Cards still have that old habit of
spotting their opponents to six or
seven points during the first few min
utes of play.
Saturday the Redshirts allowed O.S.
to score on the very first play Schis
sler's men had the ball in their pos
session. This was largely due to a
case of napping on the job, as well as
a none too strong pass defense.
Another shaky spot in Stanford's
playing was protection for the safety
man in returning punts. Several times
Frentrup and Moffatt would havo
been away to the races had the half
backs offered a little more assistance.
Fumble Weakness
Besides a couple of unnecessary
penalties for holding and roughing the
kicker, the only remaining weakness
was in handling the pigskin. Thero
was some excellent work in this de
partment of the game, but there were
also too many fumbles. Last year
Stanford lost to TJ.S.C. largely due to
fumbling the ball at critical moments,
and a few misplays this week-end
might well lead to a repetition.
On the other hand, the game brought
to light a number of good points and
sent Coach Howard Jones, who scout
ed Pop's team from the press box,
back to Los Angeles not a little wor
ried about how the Trojans can stop
the Cardinal attack. Jones also went
away wondering if his powerful run
ning offense can penetrate the strong
Redshirt defense. Outside of their
lone touchdown and a forty-five yard
march on five consecutive first downs,
the highly touted Beaver offense
which baffled N.Y.U. last fall failed
to gain at all against Stanford.
Smalling Plays Well
All of the Card touchdowns resulted
from power drives for at least half
the length of the field, from well
diversified combinations of reverses,
fake reverses, line bucks, laterals, and
passes.
Perhaps the two oustanding men of
Stanford's offensive play were Chuck
Smalling and Captain Muller. Small
ing was a regular work-horse Satur
day in backing up the line, tossing
passes, and smashing through the
Beaver forward wall during three
quarters of the game.
Muller played a whale of a game at
end. He looked particularly good in
snagging passes, and tossing laterals,
that were good for touchdowns, after
seemingly being downed with the ball.
The whole team looked good, in
fact, with Walt Heinecke starring at
center as usual, Chang Artman play
ing his first real bang-up game of the
year, Ray Tandy stopping everything
that came his way, and Bull Driscoll
and Ray Dawson showing up well at !
the guard positions.
Pop used ten different men in the I
backfield and every one of them de- j
livered with a pretty fair game. Out-,
side of Smalling at full, Frentrup and
Moffatt at half, and Fleishhacker at
quarter, the playing of Guido Caglieri
was one of the real features of the
game. Caglieri started at right half in
stead of Rothert, and he came through
with a hard smashing exhibition.

may prevent him from starting in the
Southern Cal game.
Although Stanford displayed the
smoothest brand of ball to date in
downing the Beavers, several glaring
weaknesses, which must be eliminated
within the next five practice sessions,
stood out at times. In the first place,
the Cards still have that old habit of
spotting their opponents to six or
seven points during the first few min
utes of play.
Saturday the Redshirts allowed O.S.
to score on the very first play Schis
sler's men had the ball in their pos
session. This was largely due to a
case of napping on the job, as well as
a none too strong pass defense.
Another shaky spot in Stanford's
playing was protection for the safety
man in returning punts. Several times
Frentrup and Moffatt would havo
been away to the races had the half
backs offered a little more assistance.
Fumble Weakness
Besides a couple of unnecessary
penalties for holding and roughing the
kicker, the only remaining weakness
was in handling the pigskin. Thero
was some excellent work in this de
partment of the game, but there were
also too many fumbles. Last year
Stanford lost to TJ.S.C. largely due to
fumbling the ball at critical moments,
and a few misplays this week-end
might well lead to a repetition.
On the other hand, the game brought
to light a number of good points and
sent Coach Howard Jones, who scout
ed Pop's team from the press box,
back to Los Angeles not a little wor
ried about how the Trojans can stop
the Cardinal attack. Jones also went
away wondering if his powerful run
ning offense can penetrate the strong
Redshirt defense. Outside of their
lone touchdown and a forty-five yard
march on five consecutive first downs,
the highly touted Beaver offense
which baffled N.Y.U. last fall failed
to gain at all against Stanford.
Smalling Plays Well
All of the Card touchdowns resulted
from power drives for at least half
the length of the field, from well
diversified combinations of reverses,
fake reverses, line bucks, laterals, and
passes.
Perhaps the two oustanding men of
Stanford's offensive play were Chuck
Smalling and Captain Muller. Small
ing was a regular work-horse Satur
day in backing up the line, tossing
passes, and smashing through the
Beaver forward wall during three
quarters of the game.
Muller played a whale of a game at
end. He looked particularly good in
snagging passes, and tossing laterals,
that were good for touchdowns, after
seemingly being downed with the ball.
The whole team looked good, in
fact, with Walt Heinecke starring at
center as usual, Chang Artman play
ing his first real bang-up game of the
year, Ray Tandy stopping everything
that came his way, and Bull Driscoll
and Ray Dawson showing up well at !
the guard positions.
Pop used ten different men in the I
backfield and every one of them de- j
livered with a pretty fair game. Out-,
side of Smalling at full, Frentrup and
Moffatt at half, and Fleishhacker at
quarter, the playing of Guido Caglieri
was one of the real features of the
game. Caglieri started at right half in
stead of Rothert, and he came through
with a hard smashing exhibition.
Successfully checking the last threat
of the Pacific Northwest with an easy
40 to 7 win over Oregon State on Sat
urday, Coach Pop Warner's big Cardi
nal varsity will get down to real work
this afternoon in preparation for
U.S.C.
The Beaver game was a mere work
out for the Cards, the latter taking
Oregon State in stride as was ex
pected. Coach Warner took no chances
in having his team bunged up for the
Thundering Herd invasion, and let
his second- and third-string charges
play more than half of the game.
Ex-Cripples Return
As a result, no additional cripples
were added to Stanford's large and
ever-swelling hospital list. Lud Frent
rup sustained a slightly bruised foot
but will lie out for practice today. All
of the ex-crutch-carriers who viewed
Saturday's struggle from the bench,
including Harlow Rothert, Bill Sim
kins, Johnny Preston, and Pete Hei
ser, are scheduled to work out with
the rest of the team. The only pos
sible exception is Heiser, whose knee
may prevent him from starting in the

fumbling the ball at critical moments,
and a few misplays this week-end
might well lead to a repetition.
On the other hand, the game brought
to light a number of good points and
sent Coach Howard Jones, who scout
ed Pop's team from the press box,
back to Los Angeles not a little wor
ried about how the Trojans can stop
the Cardinal attack. Jones also went
away wondering if his powerful run
ning offense can penetrate the strong
Redshirt defense. Outside of their
lone touchdown and a forty-five yard
march on five consecutive first downs,
the highly touted Beaver offense
which baffled N.Y.U. last fall failed
to gain at all against Stanford.
Smalling Plays Well
All of the Card touchdowns resulted
from power drives for at least half
the length of the field, from well
diversified combinations of reverses,
fake reverses, line bucks, laterals, and
passes.
Perhaps the two oustanding men of
Stanford's offensive play were Chuck
Smalling and Captain Muller. Small
ing was a regular work-horse Satur
day in backing up the line, tossing
passes, and smashing through the
Beaver forward wall during three
quarters of the game.
Muller played a whale of a game at
end. He looked particularly good in
snagging passes, and tossing laterals,
that were good for touchdowns, after
seemingly being downed with the ball.
The whole team looked good, in
fact, with Walt Heinecke starring at
center as usual, Chang Artman play
ing his first real bang-up game of the
year, Ray Tandy stopping everything
that came his way, and Bull Driscoll
and Ray Dawson showing up well at !
the guard positions.
Pop used ten different men in the I
backfield and every one of them de- j
livered with a pretty fair game. Out-,
side of Smalling at full, Frentrup and
Moffatt at half, and Fleishhacker at
quarter, the playing of Guido Caglieri
was one of the real features of the
game. Caglieri started at right half in
stead of Rothert, and he came through
with a hard smashing exhibition.
Successfully checking the last threat
of the Pacific Northwest with an easy
40 to 7 win over Oregon State on Sat
urday, Coach Pop Warner's big Cardi
nal varsity will get down to real work
this afternoon in preparation for
U.S.C.
The Beaver game was a mere work
out for the Cards, the latter taking
Oregon State in stride as was ex
pected. Coach Warner took no chances
in having his team bunged up for the
Thundering Herd invasion, and let
his second- and third-string charges
play more than half of the game.
Ex-Cripples Return
As a result, no additional cripples
were added to Stanford's large and
ever-swelling hospital list. Lud Frent
rup sustained a slightly bruised foot
but will lie out for practice today. All
of the ex-crutch-carriers who viewed
Saturday's struggle from the bench,
including Harlow Rothert, Bill Sim
kins, Johnny Preston, and Pete Hei
ser, are scheduled to work out with
the rest of the team. The only pos
sible exception is Heiser, whose knee
may prevent him from starting in the
Southern Cal game.
Although Stanford displayed the
smoothest brand of ball to date in
downing the Beavers, several glaring
weaknesses, which must be eliminated
within the next five practice sessions,
stood out at times. In the first place,
the Cards still have that old habit of
spotting their opponents to six or
seven points during the first few min
utes of play.
Saturday the Redshirts allowed O.S.
to score on the very first play Schis
sler's men had the ball in their pos
session. This was largely due to a
case of napping on the job, as well as
a none too strong pass defense.
Another shaky spot in Stanford's
playing was protection for the safety
man in returning punts. Several times
Frentrup and Moffatt would havo
been away to the races had the half
backs offered a little more assistance.
Fumble Weakness
Besides a couple of unnecessary
penalties for holding and roughing the
kicker, the only remaining weakness
was in handling the pigskin. Thero
was some excellent work in this de
partment of the game, but there were
also too many fumbles. Last year
Stanford lost to TJ.S.C. largely due to
fumbling the ball at critical moments,
and a few misplays this week-end
might well lead to a repetition.
