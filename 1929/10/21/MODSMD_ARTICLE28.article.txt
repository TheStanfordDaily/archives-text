# IN RECOGNITION OF GENIUS
## 
### 
Today the world joins America in tribute to the genius of Thomas
Alva Edison, who fifty years ago invented the incandescent lamp. Many
municipalities will observe the day with special exercises, but the busy
life of a university does not allow time for an official recogniton of
the anniversary at Stanford.
Nevertheless, Edison's work for humanity should not be passed
without appreciation. The incandescent lamp, though not the least of
his inventions, is but one of many. When we attend a "talkie," for in
stance, we owe the practical development of the visual presentation to
Edison's early experiments and the sound to his first phonograph. The
original conception and refinements on many devices which compose our
modern mechanical civilization have been the product of Edson's fertile
mind or to his work in his laboratories.
College students, though they do not like to be told so, may find an
inspiration in Edison's life and accomplishments. He has a brilliant
mind and an indomitable will and energy which enables him to see a
project through to its conclusion. At the age of 82, he is still searching
for new fields to conquer and is pausing the while to improve existing
devices.
The anniversary recalls a Saturday in the summer of 1915 when
Mr. and Mrs. Edison made a brief visit to Stanford. The Wizard stood
for a few moments before a group of students, faculty, and members of
the community in the Assembly Hall to receive their applause and a
Stanford "skyrocket.Although he never did enjoy being on parade, he
told President Branner that the reception delighted him, and that he
enjoyed the cheer despite his deafness. A similar honor is not inappropos
today.
The Daily doffs its editorial hat to Thomas Alva Edison on the
fiftieth anniversary of the incandescent lamp and recommends a similar
action to the student body.
