# MORE STANDS, MORE REFRESHMENTS, MORE MONEY

### 
The Board of Athletic Control's policy of prohibiting vendors of
confections from selling their wares inside the Stadium is to be com
mended, but a serious abuse has arisen this season. The great football
public attending games at Stanford is not getting the service it merits.
At present there are four confectionary stands, two on each side of
the Stadium. There are as many salesmen as the stands can accommo
date. Yet it is worth the life of the erstwhile fan to attempt to buy "eats"
or "drinks" between halves of the contests. Lines three and four deep are
formed around the booths. People jam, shove, and shout trying to attract
attention of the hard-working employees. The crowds at Tia Juana
r.round a roulette wheel have nothing on the hungry or thirsty football
fans around a stand at the Stadium.
As long as the stands are operated under the direct supervision of the
Board of Athletic Control better service is expected. It is surprising
that the Board has not realized before the chance it is passing up to make
more money. The more customers accommodated, the more money for
the Board, and the better service to the public.
There are two solutions to the problem: enlarge or provide more
stands. Either of these two could be done without violating the ecomonic
law of diminishing returns. Confectionary service for those who attend
Stanford football games should be as complete and accommodating as
possible. With the large crowd that is expected for the U.S.C. game next
week, the betterment of the confectionary service should be undertaken
immediately. It would be greatly appreciated by football fans. Then,
too, there is the possibility of more revenue for their coffers, which of
course would not displease the B.A.C.
