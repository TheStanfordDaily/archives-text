# A 						SUCCESSFUL CONVENTION
## 
### 
Twenty editors and business managers of the leading collegiate news
papers of the Pacific Coast are wending their way home after a suc
cessful convention at Stanford. While the "embryo journalists," as the
Palo Alto Times naively dubbed the delegates, are going back to their
respective campi with new inspiration and new ideas for making their
papers better, they are also taking with them a definite conception of
Stanford and of Stanford hospitality.
Something definite was accomplished to make the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Press associate a better organization. The establish
ment of a central office to handle picture and news service at a minimum
cost to association members was the most outstanding work of the
Stanford convention. As a result of this, the convention might be called
successful.
However, there was something additional gained that cannot be
measured in concrete terms. Each delegate, a leader on his campus,
received perhaps his first impression of Stanford.
As host of the convention the Daily is proud to believe that the
delegates saw Stanford in a favorable light and takes this opportunity of
thanking those agencies which helped to make the delegates' visit here a
pleasant one: the Executive Committee for use of the A.S.S.U. offices as
a convention hall; the Y.AI.C.A. for use of its lobby; the Board of Athleti-
Control for the complimentary tickets for the 0.5.C.-Stanford game;
Sigma Delta Chi, professional journalistic fraternity, for aiding in
registration of the delegates; the Theta Xi fraternity for the luncheon
Saturday noon; and the various campus fraternities for housing the
convention members.
