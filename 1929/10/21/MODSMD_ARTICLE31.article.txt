PIGSKIN. By Charles W. Ferguson.
Doubleday Doran. (New York.
1929.)
The more one reads of college life
the more one becomes convinced that
to know It one must live it. Charles
W. Ferguson, in "Pigskin," presents
a satire on the twentieth century col
lege and its campus; but unfortunate
ly Mr. Ferguson seems to have the
viewpoint of one who knows college
more from "College Humor" and the
daily newspapers than from actual ex
perience. The result is a picture
drawn from a wrong perspective and
considerably out of proportion.
The novel is, of course, intended to
be a caricature. It emphasizes foot
ball above everything else; shows the
faculty (with a few exceptions) as
smug and intolerant teachers of
dogma; and depicts as students the
conventional booze-drinking and sex
mad type. There is a thin thread of
romance running through the story,
and an even thinner thread of inter
est in the progress of the football
team. Except for these two items of
continuity, the first fifty pages are
more than enough to accomplish the
purpose of the book; consequently
the last three hundred and twenty-five
pages drag not a little.
In a novel with such a theme as this
one must not look for character por
trayal; all are caricatures. One effort
seems to have been made, though, in
the person of the chancellor of the
university. He is smugly and ostenta
tiously religious; supremely conceit
ed, taking particular pride in his
booming voice and impressively digni
fied appearance; and able to "think"
only when his own welfare is con
cerned. It is the height of the satire,
of course, that such u man should
head an institution of higher learning
and get away with it.
Ferguson's style is crisp; he doesn't
mince words, but calls a spade a
spade. He has a clever, but not extra
ordinary (these days) knack of turn
ing phrases and words to particularly
good advantage.
All in all, the book is quite readable.
The satire is as flat-footed as that of
Sinclair Lewis but lacking in the
skillful handling of the latter writer.
College students will be so disgusted
with the offensively lop-sided picture

of themselves and their lives that
they will throw the book down in dis
gust; but it should be fairly popular
with the vast throngs who would re
form the members of the younger
generation and their colleges.

DEEP SONG, Irving Brown. Harper &
Bros., New York and London, 1929.
At Palo Alto Book Shop.
Irving Brown is an Assistant Pro
fessor of Romance Language at
Columbia University; but this book
on the lives and songs of Andalusian
Gypsies is sufficiently free from pe
danticism to make delightful reading.
The first part of "Deep Song" is a
description of the adventures of the
author while mingling informally with
the Gypsy singers, and in it he pre
sents a well-written picture of the at
mosphere from which their songs
have grown.
The second part consists of more
than a hundred coplas, of short songs,
collected by the author during his
travels through Andalusia. Each of
the coplas is given in the original
Spanish and with a translation by the
author. Though the translations are
often excellent, the reader of Spanish
will find it even more delightful to
read the originals.
A few examples express well the
beauty and the epigramatic wit of the
brief poems:
"At night when darkness falls
I gaze upon the stars
And think of all the happy hours I
spent
Beside your window bars."
"The Gibalfara Castle
Is laughing till it fairly hurts
To see the girls of Malaga
With high shell combs,
But minus shirts."
"Mother of Sorrows
Night and Day
Deep in my bosom
You shall stay."
In Andalusia, "where art and life
are one," folk-songs are still being
made, and it is hard to see how any
one could fail to enjoy these gay
songs as presented in "Deep Song."

PIGSKIN. By Charles W. Ferguson.
Doubleday Doran. (New York.
1929.)
The more one reads of college life
the more one becomes convinced that
to know It one must live it. Charles
W. Ferguson, in "Pigskin," presents
a satire on the twentieth century col
lege and its campus; but unfortunate
ly Mr. Ferguson seems to have the
viewpoint of one who knows college
more from "College Humor" and the
daily newspapers than from actual ex
perience. The result is a picture
drawn from a wrong perspective and
considerably out of proportion.
The novel is, of course, intended to
be a caricature. It emphasizes foot
ball above everything else; shows the
faculty (with a few exceptions) as
smug and intolerant teachers of
dogma; and depicts as students the
conventional booze-drinking and sex
mad type. There is a thin thread of
romance running through the story,
and an even thinner thread of inter
est in the progress of the football
team. Except for these two items of
continuity, the first fifty pages are
more than enough to accomplish the
purpose of the book; consequently
the last three hundred and twenty-five
pages drag not a little.
In a novel with such a theme as this
one must not look for character por
trayal; all are caricatures. One effort
seems to have been made, though, in
the person of the chancellor of the
university. He is smugly and ostenta
tiously religious; supremely conceit
ed, taking particular pride in his
booming voice and impressively digni
fied appearance; and able to "think"
only when his own welfare is con
cerned. It is the height of the satire,
of course, that such u man should
head an institution of higher learning
and get away with it.
Ferguson's style is crisp; he doesn't
mince words, but calls a spade a
spade. He has a clever, but not extra
ordinary (these days) knack of turn
ing phrases and words to particularly
good advantage.
All in all, the book is quite readable.
The satire is as flat-footed as that of
Sinclair Lewis but lacking in the
skillful handling of the latter writer.
College students will be so disgusted
with the offensively lop-sided picture

of themselves and their lives that
they will throw the book down in dis
gust; but it should be fairly popular
with the vast throngs who would re
form the members of the younger
generation and their colleges.

DEEP SONG, Irving Brown. Harper &
Bros., New York and London, 1929.
At Palo Alto Book Shop.
Irving Brown is an Assistant Pro
fessor of Romance Language at
Columbia University; but this book
on the lives and songs of Andalusian
Gypsies is sufficiently free from pe
danticism to make delightful reading.
The first part of "Deep Song" is a
description of the adventures of the
author while mingling informally with
the Gypsy singers, and in it he pre
sents a well-written picture of the at
mosphere from which their songs
have grown.
The second part consists of more
than a hundred coplas, of short songs,
collected by the author during his
travels through Andalusia. Each of
the coplas is given in the original
Spanish and with a translation by the
author. Though the translations are
often excellent, the reader of Spanish
will find it even more delightful to
read the originals.
A few examples express well the
beauty and the epigramatic wit of the

The first part of "Deep Song" is a
description of the adventures of the
author while mingling informally with
the Gypsy singers, and in it he pre
sents a well-written picture of the at
mosphere from which their songs
have grown.
The second part consists of more
than a hundred coplas, of short songs,
collected by the author during his
travels through Andalusia. Each of
the coplas is given in the original
Spanish and with a translation by the
author. Though the translations are
often excellent, the reader of Spanish
will find it even more delightful to
read the originals.
A few examples express well the
beauty and the epigramatic wit of the
brief poems:
"At night when darkness falls
I gaze upon the stars
And think of all the happy hours I
spent
Beside your window bars."
"The Gibalfara Castle
Is laughing till it fairly hurts
To see the girls of Malaga
With high shell combs,
But minus shirts."
"Mother of Sorrows
Night and Day
Deep in my bosom
You shall stay."
In Andalusia, "where art and life
are one," folk-songs are still being
made, and it is hard to see how any
one could fail to enjoy these gay
songs as presented in "Deep Song."

PIGSKIN. By Charles W. Ferguson.
Doubleday Doran. (New York.
1929.)
The more one reads of college life
the more one becomes convinced that
to know It one must live it. Charles
W. Ferguson, in "Pigskin," presents
a satire on the twentieth century col
lege and its campus; but unfortunate
ly Mr. Ferguson seems to have the
viewpoint of one who knows college
more from "College Humor" and the
daily newspapers than from actual ex
perience. The result is a picture
drawn from a wrong perspective and
considerably out of proportion.
The novel is, of course, intended to
be a caricature. It emphasizes foot
ball above everything else; shows the
faculty (with a few exceptions) as
smug and intolerant teachers of
dogma; and depicts as students the
conventional booze-drinking and sex
mad type. There is a thin thread of
romance running through the story,
and an even thinner thread of inter
est in the progress of the football
team. Except for these two items of
continuity, the first fifty pages are
more than enough to accomplish the
purpose of the book; consequently
the last three hundred and twenty-five
pages drag not a little.
In a novel with such a theme as this
one must not look for character por
trayal; all are caricatures. One effort
seems to have been made, though, in
the person of the chancellor of the
university. He is smugly and ostenta
tiously religious; supremely conceit
ed, taking particular pride in his
booming voice and impressively digni
fied appearance; and able to "think"
only when his own welfare is con
cerned. It is the height of the satire,
of course, that such u man should
head an institution of higher learning
and get away with it.
Ferguson's style is crisp; he doesn't
mince words, but calls a spade a
spade. He has a clever, but not extra
ordinary (these days) knack of turn
ing phrases and words to particularly
good advantage.
All in all, the book is quite readable.
The satire is as flat-footed as that of
Sinclair Lewis but lacking in the
skillful handling of the latter writer.
College students will be so disgusted
with the offensively lop-sided picture

of themselves and their lives that
they will throw the book down in dis
gust; but it should be fairly popular
with the vast throngs who would re
form the members of the younger
generation and their colleges.

DEEP SONG, Irving Brown. Harper &
Bros., New York and London, 1929.
At Palo Alto Book Shop.
Irving Brown is an Assistant Pro
fessor of Romance Language at
Columbia University; but this book
on the lives and songs of Andalusian
Gypsies is sufficiently free from pe
danticism to make delightful reading.

the Gypsy singers, and in it he pre
sents a well-written picture of the at
