# "WHO IS TO UMPIRE THE UMPIRE?"
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There are apparently three groups
that combine to form the modern
football contest —the players them
selves —the field officials, umpire, etc. ■
—and the crowd, the customers; and j
the greatest of these must be the last
inasmuch as they make the others
possible.
What then are the spectators to do
when officials indulge in one of their
fairly numerous orgies of penalty in
flictions? A beautiful end run is made
and the crowd cheers wildly—but no,
some man is said to have been pick
ing his teeth, so it is a five-yard loss
instead of the gain in reality justly
earned. A forward pass is faultlessly
driven way out yonder for a clean
gain of 35 yards—hardly, the right
guard was "holding" so instead a 15-
yard loss is the result. Finally after
battling their way eighty yards to the
10-yard line (despite a constant rain
of penalties) a center smash goes
clean through and the crowd is wild —
wait a bit, "somebody blundered" and
so a penalty results in a lost game.
On some days there are practically
no penalties—indeed, we forget the

officials in our warm interest in the
contest. Another day, and with the
same comparable set of players, there
is simply a steady rain of offenses (?)
and the attention of the crowd cen
ters and revolves around these pen
alties, the dizzy public is uncertain
who won the game or who was the
better team.
The writer of this missive was so
disgusted at the penalties of George
Varnell in the Wash.-U.S.C. game last
Saturday that he shut off the radio
at the completion of the first half and
went out for a breath of fresh air, not
to again listen in for Varnell's cata
ract of officiousness. What can be
done about it?
The sportsmanlike attitude is to be
silent, although the official announcer
of that game went so far as to say,
"this game seems to be an orgy of
penalties." The players can't object
or they will be thrown out of the
game. The crowd feels like murdering
the officious umpire but good taste
forbids.
Who is to umpire the umpire?
Very truly yours,
John C. Silliman.

football contest —the players them
selves —the field officials, umpire, etc. ■
—and the crowd, the customers; and j
the greatest of these must be the last
inasmuch as they make the others
possible.
What then are the spectators to do
when officials indulge in one of their
fairly numerous orgies of penalty in
flictions? A beautiful end run is made
and the crowd cheers wildly—but no,
some man is said to have been pick
ing his teeth, so it is a five-yard loss
instead of the gain in reality justly
earned. A forward pass is faultlessly
driven way out yonder for a clean
gain of 35 yards—hardly, the right
guard was "holding" so instead a 15-
yard loss is the result. Finally after
battling their way eighty yards to the
10-yard line (despite a constant rain
of penalties) a center smash goes
clean through and the crowd is wild —
wait a bit, "somebody blundered" and
so a penalty results in a lost game.
On some days there are practically
no penalties—indeed, we forget the

officials in our warm interest in the
contest. Another day, and with the
same comparable set of players, there
is simply a steady rain of offenses (?)
and the attention of the crowd cen
ters and revolves around these pen
alties, the dizzy public is uncertain
who won the game or who was the
better team.
The writer of this missive was so
disgusted at the penalties of George
Varnell in the Wash.-U.S.C. game last
Saturday that he shut off the radio
at the completion of the first half and
went out for a breath of fresh air, not
to again listen in for Varnell's cata
ract of officiousness. What can be
done about it?
The sportsmanlike attitude is to be
silent, although the official announcer
of that game went so far as to say,
"this game seems to be an orgy of
penalties." The players can't object
or they will be thrown out of the
game. The crowd feels like murdering
the officious umpire but good taste
forbids.
Who is to umpire the umpire?
Very truly yours,
John C. Silliman.
The Editor, Sir:
There are apparently three groups
