"The Students' Co-operative Pur
chasing Association is doing a busi
ness of approximately $15,000 per
month," according to a report given
out Friday by E. H. Ayres, manager
of the Stanford "Co-op." "Our busi
ness is even larger than we expected
it to be," said Ayres.
All but three of the sorority and
fraternity houses on the campus be
long to this association, which buys
at wholesale prices and sells to the
houses at greatly reduced retail
prices.
The butcher estimates that approx
imately $fiooo worth of meat is sold
per month. For keeping the meat the
Co-op has installed one of the finest
refrigerators on the Peninsula.
