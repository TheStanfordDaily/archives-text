### Philip Space 
Well, here we are again. Those of I
you who have had nothing to laugh
about in the journals except the de
lightful-stories by a local grid cele
brity and baritone, will once more i
gag on your morning coffee. "Cab- j
bages" will be served as a Daily Dish. |
The editor of this department j
thought he was going to get a good
big rest, but the moguls of this paper
found out where we were on the night
of January 17, 1896, so here we are j
again on this page! Well, well. And
if you think it's any fun writing for \
you palookas, you're all wrong. But j
the show must go on, whether you j
like it or not, and maybe there'll be
something to write about after all.
That ever-reliable source, the Stan
ford (Calif.) Daily provides us with

Opening Assembly? Well, at last the
moral of that fine Bruce Barton story j
about the elevator has been revealed, j
It is simply: What Goes Up Must i
Come Down. And there you have it.

to wonder just how we are going to
have two bonfires this year.
