# CARD SOCCER TEAM PLAYS TIE CONTEST WITH ROVER ELEVEN
## Accurate Kicking and Fine Teamwork Mark First Game of Season 
### 
Exhibiting the best brand of soccer
seen on the local field in many a day,
Stanford's varsity shin-bruisers bat
tled their way to a 2-2 tie with the
championship Rover team from San
Francisco Saturday afternoon in the
first game of the Card season. The
contest was featured by long and ac
curate kicking, machine-like team
work of the forwards, and the indi
vidual playing of the two goalies.
The Cardinals took the offensive
during the greater part of the first
half, but were unable to get the ball
into the net. Springer, who played a
beautiful game at half, and Miller
figured in several fine offensive drives
that threatened the Rover goal, but
each time the city backs booted the
ball out of danger.
The first and only scoring in the
first period came but a few minutes
before the half ended. Fleming, inside
left for the Rovers, took the ball on
a long pass, dribbled down center, and
kicked" a hard liner into the net.
Coach Harry Maloney's men entered
the second half stronger than ever,
but were immediately put on the de
fensive when the opposing forward
line opened up with short passing
plays that kept the ball in Stanford
territory consistently. A foul gave the
Cards a free kick for goal, which
Nichols made good. Shortly after this,
Miller and Mujica took the ball down
the left wing and worked it to center
where Miller slipped it past the Rover
goalie.
Drummond, left half for the city ag
gregation, tied the score when he re
ceived the ball from Graham, and
kicked it into the net from a difficult
angle. The game ended with the ball
in the center of the field in Stanford's
possession. Captain Mayer and Bob
Burns showed a great defensive power
and the latter was especially success
ful in place-kicking.
The Stanford line-up: goal, Wil
liams; fullbacks, Burns and Dalton;
halfbacks, Springer, Mayer, and Rey
nolds; forwards, Nichols, Miller, and
Wilde; wings, Mujica and Eberhard.
Substitutions, Toepke for Reynolds;
Jackson for Toepke. Referee, Camp
bell of San Francisco.
