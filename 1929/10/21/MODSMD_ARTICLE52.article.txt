# DEAN YOST DECLARES CUSTOM BARS WOMEN FROM HIGHER OFFICE
## Activities Desirable Training For Women as Students, Citizens Is Belief 
### Isabel Warren 
"The women here have less share
in (he general student activities than
their merits warrant," declared Dean
Yost yesterday in an interview re
garding women's activities on the
campus. She believes that there is
no reason why a woman shouldn't be
editor of the Daily or Quad, for in
stance, except that custom automati
cally closes these higher offices to
women.
"The women of Stanford have the
broadest, freest self-government I
have found anywhere in a residence
college or university in this country,"
continued Miss Yost. "They have
more power, more responsibility, than
the women of any similar group I
have seen."
Activities Desirable
In order to train the women as stu
dents and citizens, a wide participa
tion in extra-curricular activities is
highly desirable, in the opinion of the
Dean. "Every college generation
should go over thoroughly its list of
activities and eliminate those which
no longer fill its needs. No activity
should be allowed to continue through
sheer inertia," the Dean stated. It is
her opinion that A.W.S. is the great
est women's organization on the cam
pus because it includes all of the
women, and its field of activity is
wide, including everything relevant
to the social conduct of Stanford
women. This phrase has been inter
preted to mean all activities of the
"500."
Provincial at Stanford
"Here at Stanford there is a ten
dency to be provincial, but we don't
want to be," Miss Yost affirms. It is
through contacts promoted by A.W.S.
that this provincialism can best be
eradicated. She expressed the belief
that the A.W.S. reception for George
Young was one of the most worth
while events sponsored by the Asso
ciation directed toward this end.
