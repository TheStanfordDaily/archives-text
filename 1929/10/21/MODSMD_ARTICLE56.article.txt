# NEW WATER PROJECT AT FELT LAKE WILL BE COMPLETED DEC. 1
## 
### 
Stanford's new $190,000 water sup
ply project at Felt Lake is about 70
per cent complete and will probably
be entirely finished by December 1
of this year, according to Controller
Almon E. Roth.
The project when finished will in
crease the University's water supply
by 278,000,000 gallons and should take
care of campus water needs for some
time. The new supply will be mostly
used for the new golf course and to
supply additional water to the resi
dential district on the campus.
It has been difficult to furnish wa
ter with sulficient pressure to resi
dences located on the higher parts of
the campus using the old Searsville
system, but the new system will elim
inate this difficulty as Felt Lake will
be 37 feet higher than Searsville. The
new water supply will also be used
to irrigate the Palo Alto Stock Farm.
The inlet works at Felt Lake, which
consist chiefly of a concrete-lined
ditch half a mile long, are now prac
tically completed. An interesting fea
ture in the construction of this ditch
is the fact that, due to the contour
of the land, the ditch gives the ap
pearance of running up hill.
The concrete outlet tower is fin
ished and the fill itself is all made.
The pipe line will be finished this
week and then all that remains will
be to finish the dam.
