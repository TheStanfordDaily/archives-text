# U.S.C. FROSH DEFEAT STANFORD YEARLINGS BY SCORE OF 13 TO 0
## Irving Mohler Scores Both Touchdowns for Troy; Card Offense Weak 
### 
Aubrey Devine's first year edition
of the Thundering Herd from South
ern California won a 13 to 0 victory
over the Stanford freshman football
team at the Coliseum last Saturday.
The victory of the Trojan frosh was
mainly the result of the high-class
playing of Orv Mohler, former Alham
bra high football star, who scored
both touchdowns for the Trobabes.
Early in the first quarter, the Tro
jans took the ball on their own fifteen
yard line and proceeded to take it
down the field, making a first down
on the Stanford fifteen-yard mark with
a pass, Mohler to Cook. Mohler then
punched the line to a first down on
the three-yard line, from where he
dove over for the first touchdown. The
attempt at conversion failed.
The baby Redsliirts then battled
the Trojans on even terms until the
second half, when a young Southern
Californian named Cates entered the
fray. Cates, alternating with Mohler,
carried the ball the length of the field
on power plays, and the latter bucked
it over from the five-yard mark. Kirk
wood place-kicked for the extra point.
Twice in the second half, Stanford
came within scoring distance, only to
lose the ball on incompleted passes.
The first time the Cards carried the
ball to the Trojan eleven-yard line,
and the second time the Stanford
rally was stopped within the twenty
five-yard mark. After the second Tro
jan score, the Stanford offense was
too weak to get within scoring dis
tance.
The work of Mohler, Trojan star
halfback, was easily the bright spot
of the game. Mohler lived up to his
reputation of being a clever football
player, by making yard after yard
through the Stanford line, as well as
kicking and passing effectively.
For the Cards, Afflerbaugh and
Stevens in the backfield, and Artman
in the line, stood out. Afflerbaugh fur
nished what threat the Card backfield
carried, making a few nice gains
through the U.S.C. line. Stevens
showed an improved defensive ability,
and got off some nice punts. Bill Art
man has the makings of a good tackle.
He is big and fast, and the best de
fensive player on the Stanford squad.
Targhetta, at quarterback, also looked
like a real football player.
