# Diplomat Meets Stanford Women; Talks Informally
## 
### 
Stanford women were afforded the
pleasure of meeting George Young
very informally Thursday night in the
Women's Clubhouse. Young spoke
entertainingly of the women pioneers
in British politics.
He mentioned the daring deeds of
more than one woman who had sacri
ficed her life for her country, and had
thus helped in paving the way for
women's participation in the affairs
of the nation.
Women members of the faculty
served refreshments, assisted by Ro
ble sponsors.
