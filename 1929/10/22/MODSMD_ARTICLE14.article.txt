# BUS REPLACES 'DINKY' FOR CAMPUS TRAVEL; SAME COLOR SCHEME
## 
### 
Stanfordites were greeted yester
day morning with the sight of big red
busses rumbling up and down Palm
Drive and Lasuen while the custom
ary creakinga and groanings of the
"Toonerville" were noticeably absent.
The temporary route of the new bus
line is as follows: Southern Pacific
depot up Palm Drive to Circle, around
west side of Circle, past Administra-
Building and Art Gallery to Encina
Hall, south on Galvez street to Por
tola, west on Portola to the Engineer
ing corner of the Quad, and then up
Lasuen to Santa Ynez. The busses re
turn to Palo Alto by the same route.
This route is only temporary pend
ing the arrival of new busses which
have been ordered. On their arrival
the entire transportation system will
be enlarged to take care of campus
needs more comprehensively.
