# High Voltage Line To Be Constructed At Ryan Lab
## 
### 
Construction will begin at the Ryan
Laboratory within a few weeks on a
1400-foot high voltage transmission
line, which is being built to determine
the practicability of developing lines
that can carry higher voltage than is
conducted by present transmission
lines, according to officials of the
laboratory.
A contribution of $10,000 has been
made by the Pacific Gas and Electric
Company and the Great Western
Power Company to aid in the experi
ment. A line crew from the P. G. and
E. has been hired to do the work.
