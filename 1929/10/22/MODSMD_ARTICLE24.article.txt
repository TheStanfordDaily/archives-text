# 'Melody' Is Theme Of Allen Musical Talk To Be Given Tonight
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, will lecture on "Melody" tonight
in the Assembly Flail at 7:30 o'clock.
This is the first of a series of month
ly musical lectures which are to deal
with the Elements of Music and will
be given during Autumn Quarter.
Allen will discuss the origin and
purpose of melody and its composi
tion, and will trace the development,
of melody from primitive beginnings
to later civilizations, showing how na
tional character is revealed in it.
Although musical lecturers general
ly discuss the history of music or the
various musical schools, Allen be
lieves that it is most important to
understand the elements of music and
to know how they are developed. He
will accompany his lectures with
brief piano selections which will be
chosen to illustrate his points.
The subject of the second lecture
to be given November 13 will be
"Melodies and Instruments." These
first two lectures are to lead up to
and to give a general understanding
of the Carol Service which is planned
for December 15. Lectures given in
the Winter Quarter will discuss melo
dies against each other as shown in
the music of such masters as Bach,
Beethoven, and Wagner. In the spring
they will deal with harmony.
