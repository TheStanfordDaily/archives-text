# CATHOLIC STUDENTS TO BE WELCOMED TONIGHT BY NEWMAN MEMBERS
## 
### 
An informal reception for all new
Catholic students will be given by the
Stanford Newman club in the Wo
men's Clubhouse at 7:30 tonight. The
Stanford Newman club was formerly
called the Junipero Serra club, but
changed its name last year to conform
with the other Catholic college or
ganizations of the United States. It
is not, however, a member of the na
tional student Newman club, whose
central branch is in Washington, D.C.
Uliicers of the Stanford Newman
club are Joseph De Lucchi, president;
Mary Jane Pollock, vice-president;
Virginia Daugherty, secretary; and
J. Manuel Espinosa, treasurer. A pro
gram is being planned for the recep
tion tonight and refreshments will be
served.
