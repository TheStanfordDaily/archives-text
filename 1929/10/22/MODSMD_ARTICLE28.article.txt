# SECRECY MARKS CURD PRACTICES FOR U.S.C. GAME
## Even Dink Templeton Must Remain Outside Gates by Order of Warner Pete Heiser Definitely Out Of Saturday Game; Knee Twist Still Troubles 
### Stephen Dietrich 
With the practice field gates pad
locked for the first time this season,
the Stanford varsity went through its
paces yesterday afternoon in prepara
tion for Saturday's decisive Confer
ence game with U.S.C. According to
Coach Pop Warner, secret practice
sessions will be in order for the rest
of the week.
Whether or not Pop is brewing up a
lot of new tricky plays to spring on
the Thundering Herd remains to be
seen. It would seem to the common
football follower that the Cardinals
alreay have a large enough assort
ment to keep the Trojans guessing
for at least one sixty-minute tussle.
It is true that Coach Howard Jones
has personally scouted the Redshirts
in action twice this year. But what if
he has? It is quite doubtful whether
lie can perfect a defense to stop even
half of the Old Fox's variety, for no
team has been able to check any of
them to date.
At any rate, no one except Pop and
the varsity players themselves will
know just what to expect when the
game gets under way Saturday after
noon. For not even Dink Templeton,
who has helped out in showing the
team punters how to boot the ball, is
allowed to see what goes on behind
the tall board fence. All scribes must
go, ordered Pop, and as Dink is wield
ing a pen this fall, he fares no better
than the rest.
Although most of the cripples will
be in shape for the encounter, one of
the team's best linesmen will be
missing from the lineup. It was made
known yesterday before practice that
Pete Heiser will be definitely out of
Saturday's game and may not be able
to turn out in a suit until after the
Big Game.
Heiser sustained a twisted knee in
the U.C.L.A. contest two weeks ago,
but was expected by the team physi
cians to be ready for the U.S.C. game.
During the past few days, however,
complications have set in and Heiser
is still hobbling around on crutches.
Ray Dawson will probably start
again at left guard. He played a nice
game against the Beavers, and his
presence in the lineup will not weaken
the Stanford forward wall in the least.
The rest of the line will be the same
as started the Oregon State battle,
with the possible exception of Johnny
Preston at left end. Preston has been
on the bench so long now that Phil
Neill may continue to get the call on
Saturday.

the Stanford varsity went through its
paces yesterday afternoon in prepara
tion for Saturday's decisive Confer
ence game with U.S.C. According to
Coach Pop Warner, secret practice
sessions will be in order for the rest
of the week.
Whether or not Pop is brewing up a
lot of new tricky plays to spring on
the Thundering Herd remains to be
seen. It would seem to the common
football follower that the Cardinals
alreay have a large enough assort
ment to keep the Trojans guessing
for at least one sixty-minute tussle.
It is true that Coach Howard Jones
has personally scouted the Redshirts
in action twice this year. But what if
he has? It is quite doubtful whether
lie can perfect a defense to stop even
half of the Old Fox's variety, for no
team has been able to check any of
them to date.
At any rate, no one except Pop and
the varsity players themselves will
know just what to expect when the
game gets under way Saturday after
noon. For not even Dink Templeton,
who has helped out in showing the
team punters how to boot the ball, is
allowed to see what goes on behind
the tall board fence. All scribes must
go, ordered Pop, and as Dink is wield
ing a pen this fall, he fares no better
than the rest.
Although most of the cripples will
be in shape for the encounter, one of
the team's best linesmen will be
missing from the lineup. It was made
known yesterday before practice that
Pete Heiser will be definitely out of
Saturday's game and may not be able
to turn out in a suit until after the
Big Game.
Heiser sustained a twisted knee in
the U.C.L.A. contest two weeks ago,
but was expected by the team physi
cians to be ready for the U.S.C. game.
During the past few days, however,
complications have set in and Heiser
is still hobbling around on crutches.
Ray Dawson will probably start
again at left guard. He played a nice
game against the Beavers, and his
presence in the lineup will not weaken
the Stanford forward wall in the least.
The rest of the line will be the same
as started the Oregon State battle,
with the possible exception of Johnny
Preston at left end. Preston has been
on the bench so long now that Phil
Neill may continue to get the call on
Saturday.
