# WHAT AILS THE RALLY COMMITTEE?

### 
There appeared recently in the Daily Bruin, official student newspaper
of U.C.L.A., some editorial comments which are decidedly apropos as
far as Stanford is concerned. The editor of our southern contemporary
saw fit to publish the following complimentary remarks:
With odds overwhelmingly against us we meet in combat to
morrow> afternoon zvith the Stanford football team â€”ivith even
more, the unquenchable Stanford spirit. Although noiv adult in
sice, we of the University have yet to develop a mature sense of
loyalty tozvard the alma muter such as is evident in the ranks of
the northern institution.
Then the Daily Bruin editor deplores "the spirit of loyalty in the
student body, which has been conspicuous by its absence." He goes on
to remark that "if the rooters at tomorrow's game support the team to
the same extent that they supported the yell leaders at Wednesday's as
sembly, the eleven men could not be blamed for lying down on the job
entirely," which leads us to believe that Stanford and U.C.L.A. have
something in common in regard to the weak-kneed support given their
football teams.
The Stanford Daily is sincerely sorry that it cannot glow with pride
at the compliments handed the Cardinals for their "unquenchable spirit,"
but there has been no such spirit in evidence this year. If the present
attitude on the campus is "mature sense of loyalty" then we hope the
Daily Bruin will take our word for it and hasten to develop school spirit
that is immature, and is sincere and wholesome.
The Daily Bruin does not blame its football players from laying down
cn the job completely if the rooters give it the same support as they gave
their yell leaders in an assembly. The Stanford Daily does not blame the
Stanford football players for not coming even on the field if the Cardinal
rooters give them the same support as they have in the past games.
With the Trojan contest looming as Stanford's crucial game next Sat
urday, the lack of interest that is being shown on the campus is so
appalling that it almost makes us agree with the "old grads" that the
old days of real school spirit are gone forever and that the modern, self
styled sophisticated college boys do not know how to support their team,
which is one of the best in the country.
Real college spirit is a wholesome and invigorating supplement to
campus life. we do not wish for the return of certain phases of
the old days, about which the grads moan, we do yearn for a rooters'
section full of enthusiastic red-blooded Stanford men; for yell leaders
who actually lead yells and who do not merely implore the boys to "pep
it up" or to "urge the team to fight fiercely." Stanford has yells. Good
yells, according to our way of thinking. Why not use them? Stanford
has songs. But who knows them?
A real piece of work that the Rally Committee might do, instead of
abolishing pom-poms because they are dangerous, would be to see that
all the eating groups learn the Stanford songs and yells. A few rip
snorting impromptu rallies would create the desired enthusiasm.
If the Rally Committee would get on the boat, then Stanford might
have an "unquenchable spirit" of which it could be justly proud.
