# DEFERRED VS. CUT-THROAT RUSHING
## 
### 
In an editorial which flatly opposes "open house" days for Berkeley
fraternities, the Daily Californian expresses this rather surprising senti
ment concerning the general problem of Greek letter societies and the
men they rush:
The Inter fraternity Council made a wise decision earlier in the
semester when it declared itself against the regulation of rushing.
While the Daily is keenly aware of the shortcomings of Stanford's
system of deferred pledging, it has been laboring under the impression
that there could be no doubt as to the system's superiority over the "catch
as-catch-can" method employed at California and on many other cam
puses throughout the country.
For the Daily Calif ornian, or anyone else, to infer that it is wrong
to regulate rushing seems rather sillyâ€”almost as silly as for someone to
solemnly state that football would be a better game if all rules and offi
cials were abolished from the gridiron.
The Daily believes that even if rushing on the Stanford campus were
annually conducted with the laxness which marked last year's fiasco, it
would be more satisfactory than the system that exists at Berkeley.
It seems a waste of time to go into the various ramifications of the
question. The points involved arc too obvious. Suffice it to say that the
purj)ose of the Stanford rushing system is to give a square deal to the
houses and their prospective members. Granting that the Stanford sys
tem has its weaknesses, it has, over a period of years, admirably achieved
its purpose.
And the Daily hopes that Scott Webster and the Interfraternity Coun
cil fully realize the vital importance of strictly enforcing the very regu
lations which are opposed by the Calif ornian.
