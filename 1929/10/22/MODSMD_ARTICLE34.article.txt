"THE COCOANUTS," at the New
Stanford.
"Oh, so you want your wages? Do
you want to he wage slaves? What
makes wage slaves? Wages. Remem
ber, friends, there's nothing like Lib
erty except Colliers and the Saturday
Evening Post. Let's remember, friends,
me for you and you for me and three
for a nickel and six for a quarter."
And in just such a manner, black
mustached Groucho Marx, ringleader
of the mad Marx brothers, in "The
Coeoanuts," poured out wise-cracks
that had the audience at the New
Stanford in a perpetual state of hys
teria. It is safe to predict that the
countless gags that run rampant
through this picture will be repeated
on the campus for many days to come.
Whether it is the kangaroo-shaped
Groucho, the silent pop-eyed Ilarpo,
or the chubby Chico, dubbed "Winnie
the Pooh" by Groucho, the same rapid
humor fires from their words and ac
tions. It is contagious, irresistable.
We must confess that we have seen
the frolicing Marx brothers run ram
pant through "The Coeoanuts" twice
on the stage and three times in the
talkies, and we are still trying to
collect all the wise-cracks that they
tumble out. If you are rather tired of
the usual run of pictures of the
three-a-day hoofer working up to big
lights only to lose the girl he loves,
or the court room scene with the
actors wading through a sea of Eng
lish accents, don't miss "The Cocoa
nuts." We intend to see it again just
to catch that one crack where Groucho
remarks of Chico, "I should have
smelled a rat. I did, but I didn't know
who it was!" —N. C.
THE METHODIST FAUN, by Anne
Parish. (Harper and Brothers,
Publishers, New York and Lon
don. 1929.)
In "The Methodist Faun" Anne Par
rish has written an interesting psycho
logical study of the introspective,
super-sensitive, "artistic" young man
who knows himself to be "different."
She knows this type, and Clifford
Hunter, the Methodist faun (so named
by jeering townspeople because he
once danced in a leopard skin at a

church party!) is a living, pathetic
character with whom the reader suf
fers mental agonies. What the poor
fellow goes through at home with a
henpecked father and a domineering,
gossipping mother is probably typical
of a great many families; and Clif
ford's solution is a communion with
nature which might have been beauti
ful had not Anne Parrish made it
ridiculous.
Nagged out of his home, and scorned
by other young people, Clifford pours
himself out in nature and art, the re
sult being some very poor paintings
and long rambles in the woods which
Miss Parrish understands but laughs
at up her sleeve. Of course, all his
mental ups and downs finally lead
to the inevitable love interest, and a
beautiful .sophisticated, travelled wo
man appears on the scene.
Painful Business of Love
From here on, the author goes into
the rather painful, but very convinc
ing, business of describing the "love
life" of the stricken one. The emo
tions aroused in his heaving breast
by the beautiful and unattainable one,
by the loose little flapper who adores
him and his orange neckties, and later
by the devoted church organist to
whom he proposes while intoxicated
—all are portrayed vividly, convinc
ingly.
Psychological Content Good
The psychological content of this
book makes it worth while. For not
only has Miss Parrish grasped the
central figure in his miserable mental
entirety, but she has a marvelous abil
ity to jump from Clifford's brain to
that of his mother, his wife, his un
attainable love, and his flapper. She
shows complete mastery of small-town
psychology.
But, aside from the content, the
author's style in this novel is exceed
ingly messy. There is no apparent
aim, nothing clean-cut about her writ
ing. In fact, parts of the "Methodist
Faun" remind one of Gertrude Stein
in her saner moments! It would seem
as if the book had been written in a
hurry and had received precious little
revision. Anyway, it is worth reading
if you are not reading for literary
value alone. —E. L.

THE METHODIST FAUN, by Anne
Parish. (Harper and Brothers,
Publishers, New York and Lon
don. 1929.)
In "The Methodist Faun" Anne Par
rish has written an interesting psycho
logical study of the introspective,
super-sensitive, "artistic" young man
who knows himself to be "different."
She knows this type, and Clifford
Hunter, the Methodist faun (so named
by jeering townspeople because he
once danced in a leopard skin at a

church party!) is a living, pathetic
character with whom the reader suf
fers mental agonies. What the poor
fellow goes through at home with a
henpecked father and a domineering,
gossipping mother is probably typical
of a great many families; and Clif
ford's solution is a communion with
nature which might have been beauti
ful had not Anne Parrish made it
ridiculous.
Nagged out of his home, and scorned
by other young people, Clifford pours
himself out in nature and art, the re
sult being some very poor paintings
and long rambles in the woods which
Miss Parrish understands but laughs
at up her sleeve. Of course, all his
mental ups and downs finally lead
to the inevitable love interest, and a
beautiful .sophisticated, travelled wo
man appears on the scene.
Painful Business of Love
From here on, the author goes into
the rather painful, but very convinc
ing, business of describing the "love
life" of the stricken one. The emo
tions aroused in his heaving breast
by the beautiful and unattainable one,
by the loose little flapper who adores
him and his orange neckties, and later
by the devoted church organist to
whom he proposes while intoxicated
—all are portrayed vividly, convinc
ingly.
Psychological Content Good
The psychological content of this
book makes it worth while. For not
only has Miss Parrish grasped the
central figure in his miserable mental
entirety, but she has a marvelous abil
ity to jump from Clifford's brain to
that of his mother, his wife, his un
attainable love, and his flapper. She
shows complete mastery of small-town
psychology.
But, aside from the content, the
author's style in this novel is exceed
ingly messy. There is no apparent
aim, nothing clean-cut about her writ
ing. In fact, parts of the "Methodist
Faun" remind one of Gertrude Stein
in her saner moments! It would seem
as if the book had been written in a
hurry and had received precious little
revision. Anyway, it is worth reading
if you are not reading for literary
value alone. —E. L.

In "The Methodist Faun" Anne Par
rish has written an interesting psycho
logical study of the introspective,
super-sensitive, "artistic" young man
who knows himself to be "different."
She knows this type, and Clifford
Hunter, the Methodist faun (so named
by jeering townspeople because he
once danced in a leopard skin at a

church party!) is a living, pathetic
character with whom the reader suf
fers mental agonies. What the poor
fellow goes through at home with a
henpecked father and a domineering,
gossipping mother is probably typical
of a great many families; and Clif
ford's solution is a communion with
nature which might have been beauti
ful had not Anne Parrish made it
ridiculous.
Nagged out of his home, and scorned
by other young people, Clifford pours
himself out in nature and art, the re
sult being some very poor paintings
and long rambles in the woods which
Miss Parrish understands but laughs
at up her sleeve. Of course, all his
mental ups and downs finally lead
to the inevitable love interest, and a
beautiful .sophisticated, travelled wo
man appears on the scene.
Painful Business of Love
From here on, the author goes into
the rather painful, but very convinc
ing, business of describing the "love
life" of the stricken one. The emo
tions aroused in his heaving breast
by the beautiful and unattainable one,
by the loose little flapper who adores
him and his orange neckties, and later
by the devoted church organist to
whom he proposes while intoxicated
—all are portrayed vividly, convinc
ingly.
Psychological Content Good
The psychological content of this
book makes it worth while. For not
only has Miss Parrish grasped the
central figure in his miserable mental
entirety, but she has a marvelous abil
ity to jump from Clifford's brain to
that of his mother, his wife, his un
attainable love, and his flapper. She
shows complete mastery of small-town
psychology.
But, aside from the content, the
author's style in this novel is exceed
ingly messy. There is no apparent
aim, nothing clean-cut about her writ
ing. In fact, parts of the "Methodist
Faun" remind one of Gertrude Stein
in her saner moments! It would seem
as if the book had been written in a
hurry and had received precious little
revision. Anyway, it is worth reading
if you are not reading for literary
value alone. —E. L.

"Oh, so you want your wages? Do
you want to he wage slaves? What
makes wage slaves? Wages. Remem
ber, friends, there's nothing like Lib
erty except Colliers and the Saturday
Evening Post. Let's remember, friends,
me for you and you for me and three
for a nickel and six for a quarter."
And in just such a manner, black
mustached Groucho Marx, ringleader
of the mad Marx brothers, in "The
Coeoanuts," poured out wise-cracks
that had the audience at the New
Stanford in a perpetual state of hys
teria. It is safe to predict that the
countless gags that run rampant
through this picture will be repeated
on the campus for many days to come.
Whether it is the kangaroo-shaped
Groucho, the silent pop-eyed Ilarpo,
or the chubby Chico, dubbed "Winnie
the Pooh" by Groucho, the same rapid
humor fires from their words and ac
tions. It is contagious, irresistable.
We must confess that we have seen
the frolicing Marx brothers run ram
pant through "The Coeoanuts" twice
on the stage and three times in the
talkies, and we are still trying to
collect all the wise-cracks that they
tumble out. If you are rather tired of
the usual run of pictures of the
three-a-day hoofer working up to big
lights only to lose the girl he loves,
or the court room scene with the
actors wading through a sea of Eng
lish accents, don't miss "The Cocoa
nuts." We intend to see it again just
to catch that one crack where Groucho
remarks of Chico, "I should have
smelled a rat. I did, but I didn't know
who it was!" —N. C.
