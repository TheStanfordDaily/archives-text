## THE 						PROFESSOR MEETS HIS STUDENT AGAIN 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
James V. Upsensky, a member of
the Academy of Sciences of Petro
grad, Russia, has been invited to
serve as acting Professor of Mathe
matics at Stanford University for the
year 1929-30. He arrived on the Cam
pus a short time ago.
Academician Uspensky has been a
professor of Mathematics in the Im
perial University of Petrograd and
the Institute of Transportation since
1907. His election to the Academy
took place in 1921. He has published
more than twenty works in the field
of pure mathematics, many of which
have been translated and published
in American journals. His best-known
works are: Sur les relations entre les
nombres des classes des formes
quadratiques bin aires et positive,"
"On Beister's Class Number Rela
tions," "The Convergence of Quadra
ture Formulas," "The Development

of Arbitrary Functions in Series of
Hermite's and Laquerre's Poloynomi
nals."
Professor Usensky has visited the
United States three different times to
fulfill engagements at various uni
versities. During his last visit two
years ago he met and married Miss
Lucile Zander who accompanied him
upon his return to Soviet Russia.
A very interesting chance meeting
took place the other day on the Cam
pus when Professor Uspensky met N.
Jakunin-Malushin, a graduate student
in engineering who had been a stu
dent under Uspensky in the Institute
of Transportation fifteen years ago.
Since then the War and the civil war
in Russia had separated the two and
interrupted the education of Malushin.
Now the two have met on the other
side of the world, the same relation
ships holding, one the professor, the
other his student.
