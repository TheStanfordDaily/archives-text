# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD...

### 
On October 22, Stanford defeated
Nevada 17-0 in the fastest game of
the 1904 season. Nevada almost scored
twice on Stanford fumbles, but never
threatened on offensive plays. On the
same day California beat Oregon, 12-0.
This was the sixth annual game be
tween the Redshirts and the Sage
hens. Four of the six were won by
Stanford, one by Nevada, and one
ended in a scoreless tie.
Members of the campus Democratic
Club made arrangements with the cen
tral committee of Santa Clara County
to make speeches in the various lo
calities during the next two weeks
before Election Day, November 8.
Judging from this article, such

things as Hoover-for-President and
Smith-for-President clubs are institu
tions about the campus, even though
they do occur only every two or four
years. At this time, however, the in
terest was more in the Congressional
candidates, than in Roosevelt and
Parker, the presidential nominees.
An editorial appearing in the Octo
ber 22 Daily, bitterly denounced the
action of the Stanford rooters in past
football games. "That there are men
in the Stanford student body who will
hoot players on a visiting team, and
who are so lacking in ordinary cour
tesy that they do not show any hesi
tancy in jeering the supporters of a
visiting team, are matters of painful
regret," read the editorial.
