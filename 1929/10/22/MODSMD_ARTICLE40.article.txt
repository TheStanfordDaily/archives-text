## 
### 
One of the few rare specimens of a
tree-climbing fish ever brought to the
United States has been donated to the
University by Alfred Fuhrman, re
tired San Francisco attorney. Fuhr
man has spent the last two years in
scientific research, and says the queer
animal was captured in the high
branches of a tree in Singapore.
