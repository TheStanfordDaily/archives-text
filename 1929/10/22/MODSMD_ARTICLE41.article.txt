### PHILIP SPACE 
NOW THAT the annual argument be
tween the warriors from the Los
Angeles Chamber of Commerce and j
the local non-competitive scholars is
at hand it would be only too inappro
priate to print a pretty fine bit of
sentiment which was smack in the
middle of a page In the U.S.C. Wam
pus. The Wampus is a humor maga
zine.
The TROJAN OATH
I pledge I will never bring disgrace
to Southern California, my University,
by any unsportsmanlike act, or dis
honorable conduct in the classroom
or on the fields of competition.
I will fight for the ideals and sacred
things of Troy, both alone and with
many; I will revere and obey the tra
ditions, and do my best to incite a
like respect and reverence in others
who may be prone to annul or to set
them to naught.
I will strive increasingly to quicken
the general sense of University unity
and Trojan duty.
I pledge ever to remember that I
am a Trojan and a keeper of the
Trojan Spirit. Thus, in all these ways,
I will strive to transmit my Univer
sity, greater, better, and more beau
tiful than it was translated to me.
The congregation will now arise
and sing Hymn 253.
All right. All right—if you don't be
lieve us look it up for yourselves.
Any Trojan oath will be, we sup
pose, Trojan Oaf.
Ah, you may laugh, but we Rotar
ians know what is True Blue. And
we've composed a Stanford Creed
which will be chanted at all football
games. That is, if we can get the yell
leader to see it that way.
The STANFORD CREED
I pledge I will never bring disgrace
upon the name of this fair college by
saying words in the "heat of battle"
which I would not speak before my
Mother.
I will not cheer raucously or in an
unseemly manner whether the "tide"
is for or against the men who wear
the Cardinal.
I will not creak in the classroom.
I will strive to beat the hell out of
anybody I ketch scalping tickets and
get in ahead of him, if possible.
I will not be a Sport—but a Sports
man.
I will not serpentine on the field,
for I know it is hard on the grass.
I will buy Union coffee, but I do
not promise to drink it.
I will say "hello" to everybody on
the Quad who calls me by my first
name and stops and shakes my hand
and claps me on the back in a friend- |
ly, Stanford manner.
Thus, in all ways, I will remember
that I am a Stanford student even if
I shouldn't receive a single syllabus
bill.
