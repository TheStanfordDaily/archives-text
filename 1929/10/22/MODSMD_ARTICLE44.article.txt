## A 						TOSS-UP—PRACTICALLY SPEAKING 
### 
Betting odds 011 the Stanford-U.S.C.
exchange took a decided slump last
Saturday night about five o'clock, and
continued to fall up to the closing
hour last night. It is expected that
the decline will keep 011 until Satur- j
day noon, when both stocks are al- j
most certain to reach par.
And it is no wonder. A close survey j
of the market during the past four
weeks easily explains the sudden
drop.
Up to the Cardinal-Beaver affair of
last week-end, the Trojan's stock had |
soared away up above par value.
Those on the inside gobbled up all j
suckers' investment capital in sight. |
It looked for a while that Thunder
ing Herd preferred was a sure cinch
to cut a melon on about the 26th.
Each week had seen a big rise in
points.
First it jumped up to 76, when the
U.C.L.A. Bruins sold out in the Coli
seum. Then it leaped 21 marks higher
by the Beaver consolidation. Two 1
weeks ago the Huskies were taken j
over by Jones' company, and the j
ticker registered a net gain of 48. And 1
finally, Occidental's collapse was ac
companied by a 64-point rise.
Yet with all this margin the market
has suddenly turned out to be bull.
No longer will many of the brokers
from the land of Troy consider selling
short.
The reason for this sudden fluctua
tion is that in the meanwhile a com
peting Farm stock began to skyrocket.
Warner and Team, Inc., made five suc
cessive rises in as many weeks. Army,
Olympic Club, Oregon, U.C.L.A., and
Oregon State combined to give the
Stanford outfit a boost of 182 points,
ranging from gains of 6 to 57.
Although the Cardinal stock kept
closing in all the time, the real bet
ting equilibrium was not reached until j
the Beaver crash on Saturday.
It seems that a couple of weeks ago,
U.S.C. only cleaned up the Staters for
a 14-point margin, while last week
Stanford came out 33 to the good.
This difference of 19 points was im
mediately balanced up against the
Trojans' 19 mark gain in the U.C.L.A.
tilt, and thus the final result turned
out to be a tie at nothing all.
So much for the betting odds.
Getting down to the real facts con
cerning Saturday's battle, it is also
easy to see that neither team holds
any appreciable advantage over the
other. The Trojan game is bound to
be a close affair, with psychology
playing a large part in deciding the
victor.
Each team will enter the fray un
defeated. Both have run up large
scores almost at will. No opposing
squad has been able to penetrate their
defenses to any extent. Both have
powerful running attacks. And what
is more, there are no two better
coaches in the entire country than
those who will guide the combatants'
destinies on the 26th.
Coach Paul Schissler, who has led
Oregon State against Southern Cal
for four straight years, said last Sat
urday that the Trojans are better
than ever. Their running attack is
stronger and their reserve material
unlimited.
As for Coach Howard Jones him
self, he frankly admits that Stanford
is strong. He saw the Beaver game
last week, so he ought to know. He
thinks that if Stanford gets away with
a couple of her now-famous lateral
plays, it will be just too bad for his
own boys.
But Jones also admits that his own
team is good. Ho says that the Tro
jans are farther along this season
than they ever have been before. Ac
cording to a statement made last
week, Mr. Jones believes that U.S.C.
will show more against Stanford than
sho did last year. And that is going
some!
After watching the Washington
slaughter at Seattle not so long ago,
Pop Warner gave his opinion that-the
Thundering Herd of 1929 is the best
ever. However, he doesn't cast a
sneer at his own charges. The Cards
of '29 are not so bad themselves.
There is the situation. Two good
teams with excellent records. The
Oregon State game doesn't clear up
the matter at all —it gave no indica
tion as to how Stanford stacks up
with Troy. Except, it did give the
spectators who left the Stadium last
Saturday evening a hunch that there
is going to be some battle on the 26th.
It is expected to bo the "big" game

of the year.
With this in mind, the wise man
will keep his money in his pockets
this week. Anything can happen with
the layout as it is. There is 110 use
laying a wager just to prove that one
is not Scotch!
