# FRANK RAGAN TO BE ACTING TENNIS COACH DURING 1929-30 YEAR
## Tussing, Last Year's Coach, Will Arrange Matches For Card Players 
### 
Frank Ragan, instructor at the Cali
fornia Tennis Club in San Francisco,
has been appointed acting instructor
in tennis. Ragan's position is one
phase of a new project in tennis ad
ministration instituted by the physical
education department, designed to de
velop a better tennis atmosphere at
Stanford.
Ford Tussing, last year's coach, will
act as an unofficial contact man in ar
ranging frequent week-end matches
between varsity and outside players.
His affiliations with the California
Tennis Association will enable him iu
bring many good men to work out
with the Cards. It is probable that
Cranston Holman and other former
Stanford stars will compete in these
matches, according to Bugge.
The ineligibility of Keith Gledhill,
national junior champion, was con
firmed today. Gledhill comes from
Santa Barbara Teachers College, a
four-year school, and that excludes
him from competition this year. Harry
Plymire, fifth national ranking junior
from Menlo Junior College, will be
a valuable addition to the team.
Ragan will be at Stanford on Mon
days and Thursdays, while Tussing
will be on hand week-ends and holi
days.
