# LENINGRAD PROFESSOR CLAIMS RUSSIA IS IN STATE OF TRANSITION

### 
"Russia is in a state of transition.
It is this transitional stage in Rus
sia's progress that keeps Sovietism
still an experiment."
James V. Uspensky, professor of
mathematics at the University of
Leningrad, who is a visiting teacher
in the Mathematics Department at
Stanford, feels that it is impossible
to talk of his native country in a few
words.
"The nation is large, containing
many different peoples and customs.
Moreover, conditions are changing
rapidly. One cannot speak fairly of
the nation's politics, its society, or its
educational features without delving
into voluminous material. Due to sud
den changes which are taking place
constantly, Russia's various institu
tions can be considered only experi
ments. If they succeed, everything
will be judged all right; if not, that is
another matter."
Professor Uspensky has been at
Stanford before, having given a series
of lectures here in the summer of
1926. His particular field has been the
science of mathematics, in which he
has done research work on the theory
of numbers.
The Russian educator is a member
of the Academy of Sciences of the
Union of Socialist Soviet Republics,
and is one of four who represent
mathematical science in that organi
zation.
