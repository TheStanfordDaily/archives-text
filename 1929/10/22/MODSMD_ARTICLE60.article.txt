# EAST INDIAN FISH SPECIMENS ARE SHOWN HERE
## Dr. Herre, Curator of Stanford Museum, Tells Story of Recent Trip Through South Sea Isles 
### Theodore Demotte 
"Of course it's as safe to travel in
the wilds of New Guinea as in the
wilds of San Jose."
Dr. Albert W. Herre, curator of the
Stanford Natural History museum, in
an interview for the Daily, reiterated
the statement ascribed to him in a
San Francisco newspaper recently,
"All you have to do is read the news
papers to find how dangerous it is to
travel on the highways and streets in
our country. I have lived for long
periods of time among people who
think no more of human life than
they do of any other kind of life, and
I have been just as safe as I am here."
Collects 10,000 Specimens
Dr. Herre recently returned from a
scientific expedition to the East In
dies, where he collected some 10,000
specimens of marine and fresh water
creatures. He has fishes ranging from
the size of the little finger
to two feet in length. Much larger
specimens were captured on the ex
pedition, but they were too large to
preserve for exhibition purposes. He
has archer fishes that shoot water at
flies to bring them down to the sur
face of their lairs, and which attach
themselves to sharks, and even to
boats, with a great sucking disk that
is on the top of the head. The pilot
fish, which is captured with its shark
companion, usually drops loose and
escapes when the shark is pulled out
of the water. It is necessary to secure
them while the shark is still under
water. Dr. Herre also caught one with
hook and line.
Another interesting specimen of fish
in the collection is a little fellow re
sembling a small bullhead. Both its
seeming to start from their sockets,
eyes are on the very top of the head,
Uses Dynamite, Poison
Dr. Herre employed nets, hook and
line, dynamite, poison, and native
divers in securing his collection of
specimens for the museum. He spent
many hours in swamps in the interior
of New Guinea on his collecting trips,
and often stayed for hours on coral
reefs under the tropical sun without
shelter to secure fishes.
Great sea turtles were captured by
sailors, who would sneak up on the
big creatures and seize them by the
flippers. Other men of the expedition
would run up to help put the turtles on
their backs. Often a turtle would make
for the water, dragging the sailor
with it, and force the man to let go
or risk drowning.

The Crance expedition started from
the Atlantic Coast, and touched at
Haiti before going through the Pan
ama Canal. The route included the
Galapagos Islands, which lie 700 miles
off the coast of Ecuador, the New
Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and
New Guinea. The last three places are
of special interest to anthropologists,
according to Dr. Herre, on account of
the culture of the people that live
there.
Though the people of the interior
of New Guinea are in the Stone Age
in their civilization, Dr. Herre found
they are most artistic people and are
able to conceive fresh and original
designs in their art work.
Dr. Herre witnessed a number of
native dances in the places he visited,
and said that the most barbaric
dances are to be seen in New Guinea
and the New Hebrides, while the most
artistic and intricate dances are per
formed by the men of Tahiti.
Received A.B. in 1903
Attracted to Stanford by the reputa
tion of Dr. Jordan, Dr. Herre took his
A.B. in botany in 1903. "I am a disci
ple of Dr. Jordan and proud of it,"he
said, and added that at the time of
his entrance into Stanford, Dr. Jor
dan was the world's foremost author
ity on fishes.
During the interview, Dr. Herre was
busy untieing little cloth-wrapped
bundles of fishes that had been pre
served in formalin. He said that he
would be busy at this work for many
days to come, and ho indicated the
profusion of tanks and cans stacked
about the little cubbyhole in the Na
tural History museum. All of them
were filled with specimens awaiting
preparation for exhibit. For the un
initiated person, the fumes of the
strong preserving solution are almost
overpowering, but Dr. Herre and his
assistant, Pablo, did not show the
least signs of discomfort.
"Of course it's as safe to travel in
the wilds of New Guinea as in the
wilds of San Jose."

line, dynamite, poison, and native
divers in securing his collection of
specimens for the museum. He spent
many hours in swamps in the interior
of New Guinea on his collecting trips,
and often stayed for hours on coral
reefs under the tropical sun without
shelter to secure fishes.
Great sea turtles were captured by
sailors, who would sneak up on the
big creatures and seize them by the
flippers. Other men of the expedition
would run up to help put the turtles on
their backs. Often a turtle would make
for the water, dragging the sailor
with it, and force the man to let go
or risk drowning.

The Crance expedition started from
the Atlantic Coast, and touched at
Haiti before going through the Pan
ama Canal. The route included the
Galapagos Islands, which lie 700 miles
off the coast of Ecuador, the New
Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and
New Guinea. The last three places are
of special interest to anthropologists,
according to Dr. Herre, on account of
the culture of the people that live
there.
Though the people of the interior
of New Guinea are in the Stone Age
in their civilization, Dr. Herre found
they are most artistic people and are
able to conceive fresh and original
designs in their art work.
Dr. Herre witnessed a number of
native dances in the places he visited,
and said that the most barbaric
dances are to be seen in New Guinea
and the New Hebrides, while the most
artistic and intricate dances are per
formed by the men of Tahiti.
Received A.B. in 1903
Attracted to Stanford by the reputa
tion of Dr. Jordan, Dr. Herre took his
A.B. in botany in 1903. "I am a disci
ple of Dr. Jordan and proud of it,"he
said, and added that at the time of
his entrance into Stanford, Dr. Jor
dan was the world's foremost author
ity on fishes.
During the interview, Dr. Herre was
busy untieing little cloth-wrapped
bundles of fishes that had been pre
served in formalin. He said that he
would be busy at this work for many
days to come, and ho indicated the
profusion of tanks and cans stacked
about the little cubbyhole in the Na
tural History museum. All of them
were filled with specimens awaiting
preparation for exhibit. For the un
initiated person, the fumes of the
strong preserving solution are almost
overpowering, but Dr. Herre and his
assistant, Pablo, did not show the
least signs of discomfort.
"Of course it's as safe to travel in
the wilds of New Guinea as in the
wilds of San Jose."
Dr. Albert W. Herre, curator of the
Stanford Natural History museum, in
an interview for the Daily, reiterated
the statement ascribed to him in a
San Francisco newspaper recently,
"All you have to do is read the news
papers to find how dangerous it is to
travel on the highways and streets in
our country. I have lived for long
periods of time among people who
think no more of human life than
they do of any other kind of life, and
I have been just as safe as I am here."
Collects 10,000 Specimens
Dr. Herre recently returned from a
scientific expedition to the East In
dies, where he collected some 10,000
specimens of marine and fresh water
creatures. He has fishes ranging from
the size of the little finger
to two feet in length. Much larger
specimens were captured on the ex
pedition, but they were too large to
preserve for exhibition purposes. He
has archer fishes that shoot water at
flies to bring them down to the sur
face of their lairs, and which attach
themselves to sharks, and even to
boats, with a great sucking disk that
is on the top of the head. The pilot
fish, which is captured with its shark
companion, usually drops loose and
escapes when the shark is pulled out
of the water. It is necessary to secure
them while the shark is still under
water. Dr. Herre also caught one with
hook and line.
Another interesting specimen of fish
in the collection is a little fellow re
sembling a small bullhead. Both its
seeming to start from their sockets,
eyes are on the very top of the head,

ity on fishes.
During the interview, Dr. Herre was
busy untieing little cloth-wrapped
bundles of fishes that had been pre
served in formalin. He said that he
would be busy at this work for many
days to come, and ho indicated the
profusion of tanks and cans stacked
about the little cubbyhole in the Na
tural History museum. All of them
were filled with specimens awaiting
preparation for exhibit. For the un
initiated person, the fumes of the
strong preserving solution are almost
overpowering, but Dr. Herre and his
assistant, Pablo, did not show the
least signs of discomfort.
"Of course it's as safe to travel in
the wilds of New Guinea as in the
wilds of San Jose."
Dr. Albert W. Herre, curator of the
Stanford Natural History museum, in
an interview for the Daily, reiterated
the statement ascribed to him in a
San Francisco newspaper recently,
"All you have to do is read the news
papers to find how dangerous it is to
travel on the highways and streets in
our country. I have lived for long
periods of time among people who
think no more of human life than
they do of any other kind of life, and
I have been just as safe as I am here."
Collects 10,000 Specimens
Dr. Herre recently returned from a
scientific expedition to the East In
dies, where he collected some 10,000
specimens of marine and fresh water
creatures. He has fishes ranging from
the size of the little finger
to two feet in length. Much larger
specimens were captured on the ex
pedition, but they were too large to
preserve for exhibition purposes. He
has archer fishes that shoot water at
flies to bring them down to the sur
face of their lairs, and which attach
themselves to sharks, and even to
boats, with a great sucking disk that
is on the top of the head. The pilot
fish, which is captured with its shark
companion, usually drops loose and
escapes when the shark is pulled out
of the water. It is necessary to secure
them while the shark is still under
water. Dr. Herre also caught one with
hook and line.
Another interesting specimen of fish
in the collection is a little fellow re
sembling a small bullhead. Both its
seeming to start from their sockets,
eyes are on the very top of the head,
Uses Dynamite, Poison
Dr. Herre employed nets, hook and
line, dynamite, poison, and native
divers in securing his collection of
specimens for the museum. He spent
many hours in swamps in the interior
of New Guinea on his collecting trips,
and often stayed for hours on coral
reefs under the tropical sun without
shelter to secure fishes.
Great sea turtles were captured by
sailors, who would sneak up on the
big creatures and seize them by the
flippers. Other men of the expedition
would run up to help put the turtles on
their backs. Often a turtle would make
for the water, dragging the sailor
with it, and force the man to let go
or risk drowning.

The Crance expedition started from
the Atlantic Coast, and touched at
Haiti before going through the Pan
ama Canal. The route included the
Galapagos Islands, which lie 700 miles
off the coast of Ecuador, the New
Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and
New Guinea. The last three places are
of special interest to anthropologists,
according to Dr. Herre, on account of
the culture of the people that live
there.
Though the people of the interior
of New Guinea are in the Stone Age
in their civilization, Dr. Herre found
they are most artistic people and are
able to conceive fresh and original
designs in their art work.
Dr. Herre witnessed a number of
native dances in the places he visited,
and said that the most barbaric
dances are to be seen in New Guinea
and the New Hebrides, while the most
artistic and intricate dances are per
formed by the men of Tahiti.
Received A.B. in 1903
Attracted to Stanford by the reputa
tion of Dr. Jordan, Dr. Herre took his
A.B. in botany in 1903. "I am a disci
ple of Dr. Jordan and proud of it,"he
said, and added that at the time of
his entrance into Stanford, Dr. Jor
dan was the world's foremost author
ity on fishes.
