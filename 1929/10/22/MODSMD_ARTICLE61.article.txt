Tryouts for the Football Gaieties
will be held tonight at 7:15 o'clock in
the Little Theatre. Frances Boone,
who has done this work before, will
have charge of the tryouts. Women
only are asked to report tonight. Miss
Boone, who graduated from here last
year and who directed chorus work in
several junior operas and football
shows, has recently opened a dancing
studio in Palo Alto.
