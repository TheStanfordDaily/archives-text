## Enoch Bagshaw Declares He Will "Carry On" Until End of Season 
### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 21. (#>)—Enoch
Bagshaw, head football coach at the
University of Washington, declared
today that he will not resign his posi
tion during the present season. It had
been reported that the Washington
mentor would resign this week after
failing to win a game in three Pacific
Coast Conference starts this year.
"Talk at this time about my hand
ing in my resignation is absurd," said
Bagshaw. "There is nothing to it.
"It is the business of everyone con
nected with the football team at the
university to carry on to the end and
that is what we are planning to do —
carry on until the season is over, until
all our scheduled games have been
played.
Will Finish Season
"What may come after the close of
the season is something that circum
stances only can determine. But until
the Husky team has played the final
game of its schedule, the Chicago bat
tle in Chicago, I am not even thinking
about a resignation."
The student board of control at
Washington attempted to dismiss
Bagshaw last winter but the faculty
athlete committee ruled that this
could not be done. Bagsliaw's contract
has two more years to run after this
season at $S5OO per year.
