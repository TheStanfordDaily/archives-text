PRESIDENT'S TRAIN, EN ROUTE
TO CINCINNATI, Oct. 22. (£>)— Ha
ving led a nation in paying tribute to
the genius of Thomas A. Edison on
the Golden Jubilee of the invention
of the incandescent lamp, President
Hoover moved on today to Cincinnati
to participate in the dedication of a
monument commemorating the reopen
ing to navigation of an improved Ohio
river.
This waterway, constructed at a
cost half that of the Panama Canal,
forms one link in the chain of a vast
inland transportation system which
Mr. Hoover hopes to see completed
soon. He had arranged for a boat ride
down the river from Cincinnati to
Louisville so as to obtain a close-up
picture of what the army engineers
have done.
Five-Hour Visit
Only five hours had been set aside
for the visit to Cincinnati at the Gib
son Hotel; a motor ride to Eden
Park for the dedicating exercises, and
a lunch with 500 persons present be
fore the motor ride to the river land
ing to board a special steamer for the
long ride to Louisville.
To all appearances, tne President
and Mrs. Hoover were none the wcrse
for the drenching they received yes
terday as they motored from Dear
born to Detroit and return in an open
automobile through a driving rain to
be acclaimed by hundreds of thou
sands and to receive the formal wel
come of the State of Michigan from
Governor Fred Green.
