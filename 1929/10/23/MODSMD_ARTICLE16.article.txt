# FROSH SOCCER TEAM BEATEN
## 
### 
Pescadero High beat the Stanford
soccer babes 3-0 in a rough and hard
fought scrap yesterday afternoon.
Greater experience of the team from
Pescadero, where soccer replaces
football as the sport of chief interest,
was apparent throughout the game.
Most of the time the ball was in
Stanford territory.
