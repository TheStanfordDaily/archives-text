"Melody is sometimes the most
I subtle characteristic of music, but it
is the one most often in demand by
the listener," said Warren D. Allen,
I University organist, in his lecture on
i "Melody" last night in the Assembly
! Hall.
Analagous to line in art is melody,
j as harmony corresponds to color. The
listener is often unable to follow mel
ody—or line —because of many melo
■ dies against each other, or because
] of a great amount of harmony. Music
, to which the listener is not accus
-1 tompd is generally disliked.
Melody originated in primitive
speech according to Allen, and early
song is defined as speech on pitch.
Musical discoveries resulted in all
countries and were of great similar
ity. The first, historical musical evi
dence of the Greeks is found in the
lyre which has the pentatonic scale
or c, d, e, g, c, as its foundation.
The strings of the lyre are repre
sented roughly today by the white
keys on the piano. Allen illustrated
this with "Auld Lang Syne," which is
composed entirely on the pentatonic
scale. Other folk-songs show the dif
ferent modes and scales used in
primitive civilization. Grieg's "Sol
j vejg's Song" was played as an exam
ple of all types of melody.
