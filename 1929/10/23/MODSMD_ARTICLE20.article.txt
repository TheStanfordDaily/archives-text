# BASSETT DESCRIBES "IVORY DOOR" AS VIVID PORTRAYAL OF CHARACTER
## 
### Prof. Lee Emerson Bassett 
It has been more than two years
J since I saw Milne's "The Ivory Door"
presented by the Theater Guild Play
ers of New York, yet the memory of
it remains almost as vivid as was the
first impression. You can not easily
j forget its humor, its easy, spontane
j ous dialogue, its genial satire and its
delightful portrayal of character; but,
as you listen, you cannnot get away
from the feeling that you are being
drawn by intimations into the legend
of the Ivory Door and are becoming
yourself a part of that legend, as was
King Perivale.
The story begins far away, "some
where in France perhaps—or Ger-
I many" and long ago, "once upon a
time"; but as far as human nature
and veracity are concerned, it might
be here and now. According to the
legend, King Stephen passed through
| the Ivory Door of the throne room and
j was never seen again. There's an
j awful mystery about that door. What
; dark ways and bottomless pits are
there, what sorceries, enchantments
are performed, what diabolical spirits
lurk behind the door are matters of
! awesome conjecture.
I The young king, Perivale, whose
curiosity has grown since he first
i heard the legend from his father, de
! termines to have the satisfaction of
knowing what is beyond the door. He
opens it and goes through; Even if
he didn't come back, he would know
j all about it just before he didn't come
I back! But within three hours here

turns. Instead, however, of being wel
comed with enthusiasm, he is repudi
ated by all the court. None will admit
tiiat he is King Perivale. No one who
has ever passed through that door
has been seen again, therefore that
anyone ever can or will return is in
credible. It is against all tradition.
Brand, Perivale's body servant, recog
nizes him but refuses to acknowledge
it before the court, for, he protests
later, "What help would it have been
! if I had acknowledged you? Would
they have believed me? How should
I they believe me when they did not
| want to believe? We have been proud
Jof our legend. It is our own; some
j thing which joins us together. We
j could not lose it." They prefer the
; legend to the king. They would rather
| believe the legend than know the
. truth.
So long as the door is closed and
I no one can report what is beyond it,
! the imagination is free to invest the
| region of the unknown with sinister
! influences, diabolical powers, horror,
1 torment, and the mystery of death.
! The people, as King Perivale says,
' want no one to come back saying
i ihnt they are fools to believe and
j cowards to fear.
Let each one interpret the play and
| the symbol of "The Ivory Door" as
:he may, through all the charming
! whimsicalities and fantasies, there
J runs a sense of tantalizing reality
which comes close to the quick of
our own lives. No more delightful or
stimulating play has been written in
our time.

of the Ivory Door and are becoming
yourself a part of that legend, as was
King Perivale.
The story begins far away, "some
where in France perhaps—or Ger-
I many" and long ago, "once upon a
time"; but as far as human nature
and veracity are concerned, it might
be here and now. According to the
legend, King Stephen passed through
| the Ivory Door of the throne room and
j was never seen again. There's an
j awful mystery about that door. What
; dark ways and bottomless pits are
there, what sorceries, enchantments
are performed, what diabolical spirits
lurk behind the door are matters of
! awesome conjecture.
I The young king, Perivale, whose
curiosity has grown since he first
i heard the legend from his father, de
! termines to have the satisfaction of
knowing what is beyond the door. He
opens it and goes through; Even if
he didn't come back, he would know
j all about it just before he didn't come
I back! But within three hours here

turns. Instead, however, of being wel
comed with enthusiasm, he is repudi
ated by all the court. None will admit
tiiat he is King Perivale. No one who
has ever passed through that door
has been seen again, therefore that
anyone ever can or will return is in
credible. It is against all tradition.
Brand, Perivale's body servant, recog
nizes him but refuses to acknowledge
it before the court, for, he protests
later, "What help would it have been
! if I had acknowledged you? Would
they have believed me? How should
I they believe me when they did not
| want to believe? We have been proud
Jof our legend. It is our own; some
j thing which joins us together. We
j could not lose it." They prefer the
; legend to the king. They would rather
| believe the legend than know the
. truth.
So long as the door is closed and
I no one can report what is beyond it,
! the imagination is free to invest the
| region of the unknown with sinister
! influences, diabolical powers, horror,
1 torment, and the mystery of death.
! The people, as King Perivale says,
' want no one to come back saying
i ihnt they are fools to believe and
j cowards to fear.
Let each one interpret the play and
| the symbol of "The Ivory Door" as
:he may, through all the charming
! whimsicalities and fantasies, there
J runs a sense of tantalizing reality
which comes close to the quick of
our own lives. No more delightful or
stimulating play has been written in
our time.
It has been more than two years
J since I saw Milne's "The Ivory Door"
presented by the Theater Guild Play
ers of New York, yet the memory of
it remains almost as vivid as was the
first impression. You can not easily
j forget its humor, its easy, spontane
j ous dialogue, its genial satire and its
delightful portrayal of character; but,
as you listen, you cannnot get away
from the feeling that you are being
drawn by intimations into the legend
of the Ivory Door and are becoming
yourself a part of that legend, as was
King Perivale.
