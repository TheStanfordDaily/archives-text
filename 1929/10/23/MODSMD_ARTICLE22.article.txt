# Ex Committee Denies Allowance Increase Proposed for Daily
## 6 to 4 Vote Rejects Bill To Give Paper 10 Cent Quarterly Raise 
### 
Culminating three weeks of discus
sion, the student Executive Commit
tee last night defeated a proposed
change in the by-laws to give the
Stanford Daily ten cents per quarter
per student increase over its present
allowance to run for the next four
years. The Daily now receives fifty
cents per quarter per student. Execu
tive Committeemen favoring the in
crease were: Cushing, Bodle, Hume,
and Pike. Committeemen who voted
against the raise were: Lauritzen,
Dyer, and Edmonds. Six votes are re
quired to change any A.S.S.U. by-law.
Manager Hal Terwilliger, who pre
sented the case for the Daily, declared
that the extra money was to be used
to increase the general standards of
the paper. Improvements enumerated
were to enlarge the paper to metro
politan eight-column size and to in
crease the percentage of news-print
over advertisements.
Lauritzen Talks
John Lauritzen, who opposed the
raise, stated that the A.S.S.U., whose
financial future is uncertain, should
not bind itself to this increased ex
penditure. The matter was finally
shelved until spring quarter when the
Executive Committee will again con
sider the matter after a six months'
survey of the newspaper.
The Committee approved seven ap
pointments to the election board.
These include: Elizabeth Clarke,
Aurelius Bartlett, William Best, Rob
ert Brown, A 1 Miller, Ernest Hatch,
and George Hart.
Encina Club will give its annual
informal dance Saturday, December 7.
