# PROBLEMS FACE 'POP' AS TROJAN INVASION HEARS
## Strong Trojan Passing And Running Attack Worries Cardinal Coaching Staff Must Develop Aerial Attack Having Difficulty Making Choice of Proper Combine 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Three big problems are facing
Coach Pop Warner during these final
days of preparation for the Thunder
ing Herd invasion here Saturday. He
not only has to perfect an adequate
defense to stop the powerful Trojan
running and passing attack and at
the same time develop his own aerial
offense, but he is having a hard time
deciding just what combination of
players with which to start the game.
With both Bill Simkins and Harlow
Rothert ready to see action this week
end the Old Fox may well consider
using the aerial route to gain a large
proportion of Stanford's much-needed
yardage. Simkins is about the best
passer on the Pacific Coast when in
shape, while Rothert is fast develop
ing into a first-class ball-tosser.
Pass Defense Weak
At the same time, the Cardinal var
sity must improve its defensive tac
tics in knocking down passes within
the next few days. Pop's men havo
been weak in this department all year,
as was shown in both the Oregon and
Oregon State games. Incidentally, the
Trojans possess a variety of smooth
functioning pass plays and no doubt
intend to spring them on the Cards
before the final gun sounds on Satur
day.
As for a starting lineup, Coach
Warner is still pondering over who
to use at several positions. It is al
most certain that Rothert will be back
in his old place at right half, but the
fullback position is causing the Old
Fox much concern. It is quite possible
that Simkins will replace Fleishhacker
during the first part of the contest.
Lud Frentrup and Chuck Smalling
will round out the backfield as usual.
Neill or Preston
At left end, Pop has the choice of
starting Phil Neill or Johnny Preston.
Neill has been showing up well of
late, but Preston may get the call be
cause of his experience. There is also
a good chance of Red Thompson re
placing Chang Artman at left tackle.
The latter lias great potentialities as
a linesman, but so far has not dis
played enough fire to suit Warner.
Although secret practice is in order
for the rest of the week, it is a cer
tainty that the big Red team will not
go through any hard scrimmages be
fore the 26th. Pop is not overly
anxious to have his cripple list en
larged at this stage of the game.
There will be no workout at all on
Friday, as the team is scheduled to
go into seclusion to rest up for the
decisive test on the following after
noon.

There will be no workout at all on
Friday, as the team is scheduled to
go into seclusion to rest up for the
decisive test on the following after
noon.
Three big problems are facing
Coach Pop Warner during these final
days of preparation for the Thunder
ing Herd invasion here Saturday. He
not only has to perfect an adequate
defense to stop the powerful Trojan
running and passing attack and at
the same time develop his own aerial
offense, but he is having a hard time
deciding just what combination of
players with which to start the game.
With both Bill Simkins and Harlow
Rothert ready to see action this week
end the Old Fox may well consider
using the aerial route to gain a large
proportion of Stanford's much-needed
yardage. Simkins is about the best
passer on the Pacific Coast when in
shape, while Rothert is fast develop
ing into a first-class ball-tosser.
Pass Defense Weak
At the same time, the Cardinal var
sity must improve its defensive tac
tics in knocking down passes within
the next few days. Pop's men havo
been weak in this department all year,
as was shown in both the Oregon and
Oregon State games. Incidentally, the
Trojans possess a variety of smooth
functioning pass plays and no doubt
intend to spring them on the Cards
before the final gun sounds on Satur
day.
As for a starting lineup, Coach
Warner is still pondering over who
to use at several positions. It is al
most certain that Rothert will be back
in his old place at right half, but the
fullback position is causing the Old
Fox much concern. It is quite possible
that Simkins will replace Fleishhacker
during the first part of the contest.
Lud Frentrup and Chuck Smalling
will round out the backfield as usual.
Neill or Preston
At left end, Pop has the choice of
starting Phil Neill or Johnny Preston.
Neill has been showing up well of
late, but Preston may get the call be
cause of his experience. There is also
a good chance of Red Thompson re
placing Chang Artman at left tackle.
The latter lias great potentialities as
a linesman, but so far has not dis
played enough fire to suit Warner.
Although secret practice is in order
for the rest of the week, it is a cer
tainty that the big Red team will not
go through any hard scrimmages be
fore the 26th. Pop is not overly
anxious to have his cripple list en
larged at this stage of the game.
