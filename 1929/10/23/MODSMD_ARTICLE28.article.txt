Second tryouts for the women's
choruses of the Football Gaieties will
be held tonight at 7:15 o'clock in the
Little Theatre. Those who tried out
last night should watch the bulletin
board outside the Green Room for the
list of those who are to report. This
list will be posted by noon tomorrow.
There were sixty-one women at the
first tryouts which were held last
night, and Frances Boone, who is di
recting the choruses, will make the
final choices tomorrow night.
