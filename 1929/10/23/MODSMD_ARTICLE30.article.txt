# THAT BOARD OF ATHLETIC CONTROL AGAIN
## 
### 
Alfred R. Masters, general manager of the Board of Athletic Control,
admitted to the Daily yesterday that a bloc of 350 seats, two sections
removed from the organized Stanford rooters, has been issued to stu
dents of the University of Southern California.
Mr. Masters declared that the pasteboards were given to S.C. rooters
because the ticket department of the southern institution underestimated
the student demand for seats. Coincident with this underestimation, Mr.
Masters and his colleagues overestimated the number of seats which
would be required by members of the Stanford faculty—overestimated
it to the extent of 350 of the best seats in the stadium.
It was only logical, Mr. Masters argues, for him to supply the U.S.C.
need with the local surplus. The result of this logic is that on next Satur
day, when the two most powerful teams of the Conference meet in what
promises to be the 1929 football classic of the West, Stanford's rooting
section will run in competition with 350 lusty voiced sons of Troy who
are to be stationed just two sections away, on the Stanford side of the
stadium.
When asked if he didn't believe the presence of these "friendly ene
mies" would wreak sad havoc with Stanford's yells and songs, Mr. Mas
ters branded such an idea as "utter nonsense."
While the Daily keenly realizes that Mr. Masters and the Board of
Athletic Control have long assumed the attitude of always being right and
always enforcing their judgment over that of the rest of the campus, the
Daily feels that in this case Mr. Master's dogmatic diagnosis is ridiculous.
School-boy logic easily establishes the fact that 350 enthusiastic ex
ponents of Trojan football will be capable of making enough noise to
seriously impair the effectiveness of Stanford's organized cheering and
singing.
Aside from that point, the Daily finds itself at a loss to understand the
logic which led the Stanford ticket department to give 350 of the best
seats on the Stanford side of the stadium to rooters from a rival insti
tution, just because athletic officials of that institution erred in judgment.
Stanford students have been considering themselves fortunate to se
cure seats for the game down behind the goal posts —and many of these
were students who had their applications in early. Now comes Mr. Mas
ters with the astounding theory that U.S.C. has more right to the good
seats than have the Stanford rooters and their friends who will be watch
ing the game in their own stadium.
The Daily does not deny that the 350 extra Trojan rooters should be
accommodated somewhere. Mistakes happen—even in ticket departments.
The Daily cannot see any reason, however, why Stanford supporters
should pay for the error of the U.S.C. manager.
It is too late for a change now. The damage has been done and cannot
be rectified. But the Stanford ticket department will do well in the future
to keep rival rooters on their own side of the stadium and to give the
choice Stanford seats to Cardinal supporters.
