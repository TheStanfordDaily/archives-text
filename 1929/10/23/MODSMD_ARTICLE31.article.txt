# A 						STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
## 
### 
Stanford fraternities got off to a good start in abolishing the obnox
ious phases of Hell Week Tuesday night when the Interfraternity Council
accepted the resolution handed it from the interfraternity Board of Con
trol.
While the resolution did not hit specific phases of Hell Week, such
as paddling, electric torturing devices, and tubbing, the fraternity repre
sentatives went on record as being decidedly against Hell Week sentiment.
The matter of what differentiates a good Hell Week from a bad one
was left up to the discretion of the individual house presidents. These
men are the chosen leaders of their various groups and are working for
the best interests of their houses, the fraternity system, and the Univer
sity. Now the time has come for them to take a step. The fraternities
have too much to lose to risk making that step in the wrong direction.
