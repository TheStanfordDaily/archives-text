ALL ABOUT "IT"
They're not using "It" to make a
hit this season, girls! Elinor Glyn,
Clara Bow, Joan Crawford, Anita
Page, Mary Brian, and all those mod
ern maidens of the screen whom the
men-folk crave say that "It" Is as
pass 6 as a girl's knees.
They're lengthening their skirts,
playing tennis instead of strip-poker,
and becoming "No!" instead of yes
girls. Over in foggy old London the
other day Madame Glyn told an
anxious world that the man-mauling,
cocktail snorting, flamin' "It" type
was definitely out. The girlish figure,
enhanced by mysterious skirts and
sun-tan backs, is what the boys are
said to want now.
Clara Bow was in San Francisco
this past week, bemoaning the fact
that work will prevent her seeing the
U.S.C. and the Big Game. Asked what
she was going to do about "It," she
replied, "I'm letting my hair grow
because long hair will make me look
sweet.. Clara is even now working on
the last picture displaying good old
"It." This farewell to vo-deo-o-do is
to be called "Station S.E.X." and in
the role of a red-hot radio broadcaster
La Bow will bid "It" a firm bye-bye.
"I'm going to Europe this winter,
get married to Harry Richman, and
then do real characterizations like
'Zaza' for the talkies," Clara swears.
So we can't look to Clara for whoopee
any more!
Joan Crawford, Too
How about the other exponents of
that indescribable allure? Joan Craw
ford, the "hey-hey!" girl of the so
ciety sinners, says, "I'd like to shoot
the author of this dancing daughter
stuff. If I have to play in another
ultra-ultra-silly flapper story I'll —
well, let everyone pray little Joan
won't.
"I want to play real people," says
the striking Mrs. Fairbanks, Junior.
Like Clara, she feels that enough of
a good thing is enough, and more
parts in which she can show her dra
matic talent instead of her "It" are
honestly wanted. And since marrying
into The Royal Family of Hollywood,
Joan has abandoned all the jazz line
and is now a very serious young lady.
So from now on we'll see Joan ac
tually act, instead of watching her
perpetually making yippee!
The Misses Anita Page and Mary
Brian are the leaders in the mode
trend. Both of them have solemnly
assured me upon my pocket Bible
that the thought of taking a drink or
smoking a foul cigarette simply
makes them ill. Both of them have
remained really "nice" girls during
the past year when the temptation to
go "It" assailed them. Both are the
kind that Mother likes as well as
sonny boy. And, girls, when you can
appeal to both the male and his
mamma you have something far more
potent than "It"!
Anita Page's Ideal Man
Anita Page's ideal of the perfect
boy-friend would be a combination of
Ramon Novarro and William Haines.
"I believe in one marriage that will
last as long as both people live, so I
think it has to be founded on some
thing besides good looks and being
elusive," she tells me. "I don't want
a caveman. I can't see the attraction,
for marriage isn't supposed to be a
battle or a jail.
"I hope the man I fall in love with
will be an outdoor sort, well and

strong. I'd like him to be good in
sports, but I'd prefer him to be in
terested in music, worthwhile things,
ambitious. I want a normal marriage
and I don't want to have to fret about
keeping my husband. It would be ter
rible to have to try to be elusive all
the time to keep my charm. And since
every real girl wants children, I'd like
two or three, anyway."
So says Anita Page, the coming
star of 1930. And Mary Brian backs
her up. Mary doesn't care for shieks,
either She likes the Buddy Rogers
type, and her present crush seems to
be Rudy Vallee, the crooning boy
from Yale.
It's the gal with the girlish figure,
voluminously draped, who's going to
rate this year!

DYNAMO, by Eugene O'Neill. Horace-
Liveright, publishers. New York,
1929.
"Dynamo," Eugene O'Neill's new
play, is a flat challenge to intellectual
honesty.
Because Eugene O'Neill is Eugene
O'Neill, America's greatest playwright,
this play is being almost frantically
read and discussed. But the same play
by an unknown author would not
have this flattering reception.
On the other hand, it would not go
unnoticed, regardless of its author.
"Dynamo" has a quality of sensation
alism that is bound to arouse a strong
reaction. Still, it is the glamour of
the name of its writer that will make
people feel more in this sensational
ism than is really there. The public
will exclaim "powerful," "tremen
dous," "profound," simply because it
has gotten used to saying that about
Eugene O'Neill.
But turn the spotlight of caution
and skepticism on the play, and it
will be seen that these adjectives do
not fit. It is neither weak nor medi
ocre, and certain scenes have an al
most terrific intensity. Even here, how
ever, "disagreeable" is the word that
best describes the play. Abnormal
characters are very popular in mod
ern literature, but in "Dynamo," the
abnormality idea is so unpleasantly
strong that the reader is repelled. The
same is true of the sex element.
Straight, heavy melodrama is the
keynote, leaving no room for honor,
sympathy, or naturalness, and the
characters are either pitiful or despic
able, or both. Reuben, the hero, has
an inferiority complex, and loathes
himself for his cowardice and weak
ness of mind. He runs away from
home, and works with electricity. The
symbolism here is effective, in spite
of the obviousness of the stage trick.
Electric dynamos represent what Reu
ben lacks in himself, and he places
them above everything else —above
his sweetheart, his mother, and his
father's God.
It is the Dynamo that he makes his
refuge, and later his deity. The slow
tracing of how this boy tortures him
self physically and mentally to insan
ity, and in the end, realizing that his
worship of the Dynamo is an halluci
nation, despairingly kills himself, is
really a strong, profound piece of writ
ing.
But what right has any author to
offer simply ugliness and morbidness
to the public? Even the unique ability
of O'Neill as a realist and a psycho
analyst should not give him this
privilege, if readers will be honest.

and I don't want to have to fret about
keeping my husband. It would be ter

the time to keep my charm. And since
every real girl wants children, I'd like
two or three, anyway."
So says Anita Page, the coming
star of 1930. And Mary Brian backs
her up. Mary doesn't care for shieks,
either She likes the Buddy Rogers
type, and her present crush seems to
be Rudy Vallee, the crooning boy
from Yale.
It's the gal with the girlish figure,

DYNAMO, by Eugene O'Neill. Horace-
Liveright, publishers. New York,
1929.
"Dynamo," Eugene O'Neill's new
play, is a flat challenge to intellectual
honesty.
Because Eugene O'Neill is Eugene
O'Neill, America's greatest playwright,
this play is being almost frantically
read and discussed. But the same play
by an unknown author would not
have this flattering reception.
On the other hand, it would not go
unnoticed, regardless of its author.
"Dynamo" has a quality of sensation
alism that is bound to arouse a strong
reaction. Still, it is the glamour of
the name of its writer that will make
people feel more in this sensational
ism than is really there. The public
will exclaim "powerful," "tremen
dous," "profound," simply because it
has gotten used to saying that about
Eugene O'Neill.
But turn the spotlight of caution
and skepticism on the play, and it
will be seen that these adjectives do
not fit. It is neither weak nor medi
ocre, and certain scenes have an al
most terrific intensity. Even here, how
ever, "disagreeable" is the word that
best describes the play. Abnormal
characters are very popular in mod
ern literature, but in "Dynamo," the
abnormality idea is so unpleasantly
strong that the reader is repelled. The
same is true of the sex element.
Straight, heavy melodrama is the
keynote, leaving no room for honor,
sympathy, or naturalness, and the
characters are either pitiful or despic
able, or both. Reuben, the hero, has
an inferiority complex, and loathes
himself for his cowardice and weak
ness of mind. He runs away from
home, and works with electricity. The
symbolism here is effective, in spite
of the obviousness of the stage trick.
Electric dynamos represent what Reu
ben lacks in himself, and he places
them above everything else —above
his sweetheart, his mother, and his
father's God.
It is the Dynamo that he makes his
refuge, and later his deity. The slow
tracing of how this boy tortures him
self physically and mentally to insan
ity, and in the end, realizing that his
worship of the Dynamo is an halluci
nation, despairingly kills himself, is
really a strong, profound piece of writ
ing.
But what right has any author to
offer simply ugliness and morbidness
to the public? Even the unique ability
of O'Neill as a realist and a psycho
analyst should not give him this
privilege, if readers will be honest.

ALL ABOUT "IT"
They're not using "It" to make a
hit this season, girls! Elinor Glyn,
Clara Bow, Joan Crawford, Anita
Page, Mary Brian, and all those mod
ern maidens of the screen whom the
men-folk crave say that "It" Is as
pass 6 as a girl's knees.
They're lengthening their skirts,
playing tennis instead of strip-poker,
and becoming "No!" instead of yes
girls. Over in foggy old London the
other day Madame Glyn told an
anxious world that the man-mauling,
cocktail snorting, flamin' "It" type
was definitely out. The girlish figure,
enhanced by mysterious skirts and
sun-tan backs, is what the boys are
said to want now.
Clara Bow was in San Francisco
this past week, bemoaning the fact
that work will prevent her seeing the
U.S.C. and the Big Game. Asked what
she was going to do about "It," she
replied, "I'm letting my hair grow
because long hair will make me look
sweet.. Clara is even now working on
the last picture displaying good old
"It." This farewell to vo-deo-o-do is
to be called "Station S.E.X." and in
the role of a red-hot radio broadcaster
La Bow will bid "It" a firm bye-bye.
"I'm going to Europe this winter,
get married to Harry Richman, and
then do real characterizations like
'Zaza' for the talkies," Clara swears.
So we can't look to Clara for whoopee
any more!
Joan Crawford, Too
How about the other exponents of
that indescribable allure? Joan Craw
ford, the "hey-hey!" girl of the so
ciety sinners, says, "I'd like to shoot
the author of this dancing daughter
stuff. If I have to play in another
ultra-ultra-silly flapper story I'll —
well, let everyone pray little Joan
won't.
"I want to play real people," says
the striking Mrs. Fairbanks, Junior.
Like Clara, she feels that enough of
a good thing is enough, and more
parts in which she can show her dra
matic talent instead of her "It" are
honestly wanted. And since marrying
into The Royal Family of Hollywood,
Joan has abandoned all the jazz line
and is now a very serious young lady.
So from now on we'll see Joan ac
tually act, instead of watching her
perpetually making yippee!
The Misses Anita Page and Mary
Brian are the leaders in the mode
trend. Both of them have solemnly
assured me upon my pocket Bible
that the thought of taking a drink or
smoking a foul cigarette simply
makes them ill. Both of them have
remained really "nice" girls during
the past year when the temptation to
go "It" assailed them. Both are the
kind that Mother likes as well as
sonny boy. And, girls, when you can
appeal to both the male and his
mamma you have something far more
potent than "It"!
Anita Page's Ideal Man
Anita Page's ideal of the perfect
boy-friend would be a combination of
Ramon Novarro and William Haines.
"I believe in one marriage that will
last as long as both people live, so I
think it has to be founded on some
thing besides good looks and being
elusive," she tells me. "I don't want
a caveman. I can't see the attraction,
for marriage isn't supposed to be a
battle or a jail.
"I hope the man I fall in love with
will be an outdoor sort, well and

strong. I'd like him to be good in
sports, but I'd prefer him to be in
terested in music, worthwhile things,
ambitious. I want a normal marriage
and I don't want to have to fret about
keeping my husband. It would be ter

playing tennis instead of strip-poker,
and becoming "No!" instead of yes
girls. Over in foggy old London the
other day Madame Glyn told an
anxious world that the man-mauling,
cocktail snorting, flamin' "It" type
was definitely out. The girlish figure,
enhanced by mysterious skirts and
sun-tan backs, is what the boys are
said to want now.
Clara Bow was in San Francisco
this past week, bemoaning the fact
that work will prevent her seeing the
U.S.C. and the Big Game. Asked what
she was going to do about "It," she
replied, "I'm letting my hair grow
because long hair will make me look
sweet.. Clara is even now working on
the last picture displaying good old
"It." This farewell to vo-deo-o-do is
to be called "Station S.E.X." and in
the role of a red-hot radio broadcaster
La Bow will bid "It" a firm bye-bye.
"I'm going to Europe this winter,
get married to Harry Richman, and
then do real characterizations like
'Zaza' for the talkies," Clara swears.
So we can't look to Clara for whoopee
any more!
Joan Crawford, Too
How about the other exponents of
that indescribable allure? Joan Craw
ford, the "hey-hey!" girl of the so
ciety sinners, says, "I'd like to shoot
the author of this dancing daughter
stuff. If I have to play in another
ultra-ultra-silly flapper story I'll —
well, let everyone pray little Joan
won't.
"I want to play real people," says
the striking Mrs. Fairbanks, Junior.
Like Clara, she feels that enough of
a good thing is enough, and more
parts in which she can show her dra
matic talent instead of her "It" are
honestly wanted. And since marrying
into The Royal Family of Hollywood,
Joan has abandoned all the jazz line
and is now a very serious young lady.
So from now on we'll see Joan ac
tually act, instead of watching her
perpetually making yippee!
The Misses Anita Page and Mary
Brian are the leaders in the mode
trend. Both of them have solemnly
assured me upon my pocket Bible
that the thought of taking a drink or
smoking a foul cigarette simply
makes them ill. Both of them have
remained really "nice" girls during
the past year when the temptation to
go "It" assailed them. Both are the
kind that Mother likes as well as
sonny boy. And, girls, when you can
appeal to both the male and his
mamma you have something far more
potent than "It"!
Anita Page's Ideal Man
Anita Page's ideal of the perfect
boy-friend would be a combination of
Ramon Novarro and William Haines.
"I believe in one marriage that will
last as long as both people live, so I
think it has to be founded on some
thing besides good looks and being
elusive," she tells me. "I don't want
a caveman. I can't see the attraction,
for marriage isn't supposed to be a
battle or a jail.
"I hope the man I fall in love with
will be an outdoor sort, well and

strong. I'd like him to be good in
sports, but I'd prefer him to be in
terested in music, worthwhile things,
ambitious. I want a normal marriage
and I don't want to have to fret about
keeping my husband. It would be ter
rible to have to try to be elusive all
the time to keep my charm. And since
every real girl wants children, I'd like
two or three, anyway."
So says Anita Page, the coming
star of 1930. And Mary Brian backs
her up. Mary doesn't care for shieks,
either She likes the Buddy Rogers
type, and her present crush seems to
be Rudy Vallee, the crooning boy
from Yale.
It's the gal with the girlish figure,
voluminously draped, who's going to
rate this year!

DYNAMO, by Eugene O'Neill. Horace-
Liveright, publishers. New York,
1929.
"Dynamo," Eugene O'Neill's new
play, is a flat challenge to intellectual
honesty.
Because Eugene O'Neill is Eugene
O'Neill, America's greatest playwright,
this play is being almost frantically
read and discussed. But the same play
by an unknown author would not
have this flattering reception.
On the other hand, it would not go
unnoticed, regardless of its author.
"Dynamo" has a quality of sensation
alism that is bound to arouse a strong
reaction. Still, it is the glamour of
the name of its writer that will make
people feel more in this sensational
ism than is really there. The public
will exclaim "powerful," "tremen
dous," "profound," simply because it
has gotten used to saying that about
Eugene O'Neill.
But turn the spotlight of caution
and skepticism on the play, and it
will be seen that these adjectives do
not fit. It is neither weak nor medi
ocre, and certain scenes have an al
most terrific intensity. Even here, how
ever, "disagreeable" is the word that
best describes the play. Abnormal
characters are very popular in mod
ern literature, but in "Dynamo," the
abnormality idea is so unpleasantly
strong that the reader is repelled. The
same is true of the sex element.
Straight, heavy melodrama is the
keynote, leaving no room for honor,
sympathy, or naturalness, and the
characters are either pitiful or despic
able, or both. Reuben, the hero, has
an inferiority complex, and loathes
himself for his cowardice and weak
ness of mind. He runs away from
home, and works with electricity. The
symbolism here is effective, in spite
of the obviousness of the stage trick.
Electric dynamos represent what Reu
ben lacks in himself, and he places
them above everything else —above
his sweetheart, his mother, and his
father's God.
It is the Dynamo that he makes his
refuge, and later his deity. The slow
tracing of how this boy tortures him
self physically and mentally to insan
ity, and in the end, realizing that his
worship of the Dynamo is an halluci
nation, despairingly kills himself, is
really a strong, profound piece of writ
ing.
But what right has any author to
offer simply ugliness and morbidness
to the public? Even the unique ability
of O'Neill as a realist and a psycho
analyst should not give him this
privilege, if readers will be honest.

star of 1930. And Mary Brian backs
her up. Mary doesn't care for shieks,
either She likes the Buddy Rogers
type, and her present crush seems to
be Rudy Vallee, the crooning boy
from Yale.
It's the gal with the girlish figure,
voluminously draped, who's going to

DYNAMO, by Eugene O'Neill. Horace-
Liveright, publishers. New York,
1929.
"Dynamo," Eugene O'Neill's new
play, is a flat challenge to intellectual
honesty.
Because Eugene O'Neill is Eugene
O'Neill, America's greatest playwright,
this play is being almost frantically
read and discussed. But the same play
by an unknown author would not
have this flattering reception.
On the other hand, it would not go
unnoticed, regardless of its author.
"Dynamo" has a quality of sensation
alism that is bound to arouse a strong
reaction. Still, it is the glamour of
the name of its writer that will make
people feel more in this sensational
ism than is really there. The public
will exclaim "powerful," "tremen
dous," "profound," simply because it
has gotten used to saying that about
Eugene O'Neill.
But turn the spotlight of caution
and skepticism on the play, and it
will be seen that these adjectives do
not fit. It is neither weak nor medi
ocre, and certain scenes have an al
most terrific intensity. Even here, how
ever, "disagreeable" is the word that
best describes the play. Abnormal
characters are very popular in mod
ern literature, but in "Dynamo," the
abnormality idea is so unpleasantly
strong that the reader is repelled. The
same is true of the sex element.
Straight, heavy melodrama is the
keynote, leaving no room for honor,
sympathy, or naturalness, and the
characters are either pitiful or despic
able, or both. Reuben, the hero, has
an inferiority complex, and loathes
himself for his cowardice and weak
ness of mind. He runs away from
home, and works with electricity. The
symbolism here is effective, in spite
of the obviousness of the stage trick.
Electric dynamos represent what Reu
ben lacks in himself, and he places
them above everything else —above
his sweetheart, his mother, and his
father's God.
It is the Dynamo that he makes his
refuge, and later his deity. The slow
tracing of how this boy tortures him
self physically and mentally to insan
ity, and in the end, realizing that his
worship of the Dynamo is an halluci
nation, despairingly kills himself, is
really a strong, profound piece of writ
ing.
But what right has any author to
offer simply ugliness and morbidness
to the public? Even the unique ability
of O'Neill as a realist and a psycho
analyst should not give him this
privilege, if readers will be honest.

ALL ABOUT "IT"
They're not using "It" to make a
hit this season, girls! Elinor Glyn,
Clara Bow, Joan Crawford, Anita
Page, Mary Brian, and all those mod
ern maidens of the screen whom the
men-folk crave say that "It" Is as
pass 6 as a girl's knees.
They're lengthening their skirts,
playing tennis instead of strip-poker,
and becoming "No!" instead of yes
girls. Over in foggy old London the
other day Madame Glyn told an
anxious world that the man-mauling,
cocktail snorting, flamin' "It" type
was definitely out. The girlish figure,
enhanced by mysterious skirts and
sun-tan backs, is what the boys are
said to want now.
Clara Bow was in San Francisco
this past week, bemoaning the fact
that work will prevent her seeing the
U.S.C. and the Big Game. Asked what
she was going to do about "It," she
replied, "I'm letting my hair grow
because long hair will make me look
sweet.. Clara is even now working on
the last picture displaying good old
"It." This farewell to vo-deo-o-do is
to be called "Station S.E.X." and in
the role of a red-hot radio broadcaster
La Bow will bid "It" a firm bye-bye.
"I'm going to Europe this winter,
get married to Harry Richman, and
then do real characterizations like
'Zaza' for the talkies," Clara swears.
So we can't look to Clara for whoopee
any more!
Joan Crawford, Too
How about the other exponents of
that indescribable allure? Joan Craw
ford, the "hey-hey!" girl of the so
ciety sinners, says, "I'd like to shoot
the author of this dancing daughter
stuff. If I have to play in another
ultra-ultra-silly flapper story I'll —
well, let everyone pray little Joan
won't.
"I want to play real people," says
the striking Mrs. Fairbanks, Junior.
Like Clara, she feels that enough of
a good thing is enough, and more
parts in which she can show her dra
matic talent instead of her "It" are
honestly wanted. And since marrying
into The Royal Family of Hollywood,
Joan has abandoned all the jazz line
and is now a very serious young lady.
So from now on we'll see Joan ac
tually act, instead of watching her
perpetually making yippee!
The Misses Anita Page and Mary
Brian are the leaders in the mode
trend. Both of them have solemnly
assured me upon my pocket Bible
that the thought of taking a drink or
smoking a foul cigarette simply
makes them ill. Both of them have
remained really "nice" girls during
the past year when the temptation to
go "It" assailed them. Both are the
kind that Mother likes as well as
sonny boy. And, girls, when you can
appeal to both the male and his
mamma you have something far more
potent than "It"!
Anita Page's Ideal Man
Anita Page's ideal of the perfect
boy-friend would be a combination of
Ramon Novarro and William Haines.
"I believe in one marriage that will
last as long as both people live, so I
think it has to be founded on some
thing besides good looks and being
elusive," she tells me. "I don't want
a caveman. I can't see the attraction,
for marriage isn't supposed to be a
battle or a jail.
"I hope the man I fall in love with
will be an outdoor sort, well and

strong. I'd like him to be good in
sports, but I'd prefer him to be in
terested in music, worthwhile things,
ambitious. I want a normal marriage
and I don't want to have to fret about
keeping my husband. It would be ter
rible to have to try to be elusive all
the time to keep my charm. And since
every real girl wants children, I'd like
two or three, anyway."
So says Anita Page, the coming
star of 1930. And Mary Brian backs
her up. Mary doesn't care for shieks,
either She likes the Buddy Rogers
type, and her present crush seems to
