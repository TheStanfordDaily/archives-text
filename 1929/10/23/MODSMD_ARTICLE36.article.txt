On October 23, 1904, arrangements
were made with the Columbia Thea
tre in San Francisco for the reserva
tion of the entire first floor of the

student bodies to buy out different
theatres for the night after the Big

tivities by viewing a play and giving
yells and singing songs throughout
the production. There was very little
of the present post-game procedure.
The Frantic and other "whoopee par
lors" had very little trade on Big
Game nights.
Announcement of the completion of
the new Roble tennis courts was

interest of the sport among the wo
men.
In 1904, there were only four wo
men's sports: tennis, handball, bas
ketball, and gymnastics, the most
popular of which was tennis. Matches

The Chess Club, founded in Febru
ary, 1894, was composed of eighteen
