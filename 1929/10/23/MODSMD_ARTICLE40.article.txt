The Editor, Sir:
An editorial in today's Daily criti
cizes the work of the Rally Committee
of this year. A little specific criticism
might not hurt:
1. Paul Speegle announces the yells
in the rooting section very poorly. He
can be heard only in the center sec
tion. The groups of rooters to his
right and left were often unaware (in
last Saturday's game) that a yell was
being given until it was started.
2. Speegle starts the yells too soon
after a bit of excitement in the game.
For instance, while the stands are
still cheering in an unorganized way
for some player, Speegle announces a
yell. Few hear him, of course, and the
result is a weak yell from a few in
the center seats.
3. Speegle doesn't make it clear
enough each time just how he wants
the player's name given—whether the
rooters are to give the player's first
and last names or merely the last
name.
4. How does the Rally Committee
expect the rooting section to know
all the school songs if we never try
to sing anything but "Come Join the
Band" and"The Hymn"?
