WHEN WIZARDS MEET
When the opening kickoff soares
high and wide next Saturday and
gome 90,000 rabid fans leap to their
feet tingling with excitement, the
fifth meeting of teams coached hy the
two wizards of Western football will
be under way.
Messrs. Glenn Scobey Warner and
Howard Jones are unanimously recog
nized by scribes, critics, and the com
mon population alike as the best in
the West, while at the same time
they are without peers in the entire
country.
The Old Fox is the unrivaled
veteran of them all when it comes
to pulling off surprises, concocting
new plays to liven up the land
of freedom's favorite fall pastime,
bringing to light tricky offensive
systems, and developing ail-Ameri
can players. His record speaks
for itself. And Mr. Jones, though
of later vintage, has done his
share in startling followers of the
pigskin classics.
Pop has turned out such finished
specimens as Jim Thorpe, Ernie Nev
ers, the Shipkey brothers, Ed Walker,
Tricky Dick, and those two nonpareil
guards by the names of Robesky and
Post for the football hall of fame. To
balance up against this list, Sir How
ard has developed a number of super
ior stalwarts himself, including Mor
ton Kaer, Morley Drury, Jesse llibbs,
and Dynamite Don Williams.
Doth Warner and Jones have car
ried off Coast Championships at one
time or another. Each of them have
put out unbeaten teams. And both
have won national titles, mythical or
otherwise.
But getting back to the subject
of these two masterminds clash
ing wits on the actual field of bat
tle, it is to be noted that exactly
four times before the present sea
son they have pitted their minds
and mind-products against each
other.
Warner has come out on top
twice, Jones once, and on a cer
tain occasion the result was a
deadlock!
Delving back into the history of the
meetings of Pop-coached Stanford
tribes and Sir Howard-coached Tro
jan troops, it is found that in 1925
they came to blows for the first time,
Stanford winning by 13 points to 9.
Turning over pages of the Middle
Ages it is discovered that in 1926 the
Cardinal banner waved victoriously
over the battlefield of Troy with hard
ly a hope of victory, but that night
her warriors returned to the north to
celebrate a 13 to 12 win.
In the Renaissance period of 1927
the two teams clashed on even terms,
and when the smoke of battle had
cleared away it was found that the
dopesters had predicted right for once.
A bit of last-minute strategy by the
Old Fox had changed a certain loss
into a tie game at 13 to 13.
Opening the modern era her
alded as an unbeatable outfit, Mr.
Warner's charges journeyed down
to the Coliseum last year to storm
the Trojan stronghold. Eut after
outgaining, outpunting, and out
passing Jones' boys for a greater
portion of the game, the Redshirts
turned around and beat them
selves. Fumbles, and more fum
bles, combined to rout out the
Cards by a score of 10 to 0.
So much for the past. The future is
"what is bothering Coaches Warner
and Jones at the present time. And
by future, Saturday's fifth meeting is
what is meant!
Pop has a slight edge at the pres
ent time. Whether he keeps on as
head man in the coaching show
largely depends on how the affair of
the 2Gth turns out. His team is on a
par with Mr. Jones.' Both Pop and
Sir Howard will enter the fray on
even terms.
At all events, the 90,000-odd
spectators who cram the Stadium
to overflowing on Saturday after-

noon can wisely look forward for
the unexpected to happen. For
when wizards meet, an awesome
spectacle is brewed.

WHEN WIZARDS MEET
When the opening kickoff soares
high and wide next Saturday and
gome 90,000 rabid fans leap to their
feet tingling with excitement, the
fifth meeting of teams coached hy the
two wizards of Western football will
be under way.
Messrs. Glenn Scobey Warner and
Howard Jones are unanimously recog
nized by scribes, critics, and the com
mon population alike as the best in
the West, while at the same time
they are without peers in the entire
country.
The Old Fox is the unrivaled
veteran of them all when it comes
to pulling off surprises, concocting
new plays to liven up the land
of freedom's favorite fall pastime,
bringing to light tricky offensive
systems, and developing ail-Ameri
can players. His record speaks
for itself. And Mr. Jones, though
of later vintage, has done his
share in startling followers of the
pigskin classics.
Pop has turned out such finished
specimens as Jim Thorpe, Ernie Nev
ers, the Shipkey brothers, Ed Walker,
Tricky Dick, and those two nonpareil
guards by the names of Robesky and
Post for the football hall of fame. To
balance up against this list, Sir How
ard has developed a number of super
ior stalwarts himself, including Mor
ton Kaer, Morley Drury, Jesse llibbs,
and Dynamite Don Williams.
Doth Warner and Jones have car
ried off Coast Championships at one
time or another. Each of them have
put out unbeaten teams. And both
have won national titles, mythical or
otherwise.
But getting back to the subject
of these two masterminds clash
ing wits on the actual field of bat
tle, it is to be noted that exactly
four times before the present sea
son they have pitted their minds
and mind-products against each
other.
Warner has come out on top
twice, Jones once, and on a cer
tain occasion the result was a
deadlock!
Delving back into the history of the
meetings of Pop-coached Stanford
tribes and Sir Howard-coached Tro
jan troops, it is found that in 1925
they came to blows for the first time,
Stanford winning by 13 points to 9.
Turning over pages of the Middle
Ages it is discovered that in 1926 the
Cardinal banner waved victoriously
over the battlefield of Troy with hard
ly a hope of victory, but that night
her warriors returned to the north to
celebrate a 13 to 12 win.
In the Renaissance period of 1927
the two teams clashed on even terms,
and when the smoke of battle had
cleared away it was found that the
dopesters had predicted right for once.
A bit of last-minute strategy by the
Old Fox had changed a certain loss
into a tie game at 13 to 13.
Opening the modern era her
alded as an unbeatable outfit, Mr.
Warner's charges journeyed down
to the Coliseum last year to storm
the Trojan stronghold. Eut after
outgaining, outpunting, and out
passing Jones' boys for a greater
portion of the game, the Redshirts
turned around and beat them
selves. Fumbles, and more fum
bles, combined to rout out the
Cards by a score of 10 to 0.
So much for the past. The future is
"what is bothering Coaches Warner
and Jones at the present time. And
by future, Saturday's fifth meeting is
what is meant!
Pop has a slight edge at the pres
ent time. Whether he keeps on as
head man in the coaching show
largely depends on how the affair of
the 2Gth turns out. His team is on a
par with Mr. Jones.' Both Pop and
Sir Howard will enter the fray on
even terms.

WHEN WIZARDS MEET
When the opening kickoff soares
high and wide next Saturday and
gome 90,000 rabid fans leap to their
feet tingling with excitement, the
fifth meeting of teams coached hy the
two wizards of Western football will
be under way.
Messrs. Glenn Scobey Warner and
Howard Jones are unanimously recog
nized by scribes, critics, and the com
mon population alike as the best in
the West, while at the same time
they are without peers in the entire
country.
The Old Fox is the unrivaled
veteran of them all when it comes
to pulling off surprises, concocting
new plays to liven up the land
of freedom's favorite fall pastime,
bringing to light tricky offensive
systems, and developing ail-Ameri
can players. His record speaks
for itself. And Mr. Jones, though
of later vintage, has done his
share in startling followers of the
pigskin classics.
Pop has turned out such finished
specimens as Jim Thorpe, Ernie Nev
ers, the Shipkey brothers, Ed Walker,
Tricky Dick, and those two nonpareil
guards by the names of Robesky and
Post for the football hall of fame. To
balance up against this list, Sir How
ard has developed a number of super
ior stalwarts himself, including Mor
ton Kaer, Morley Drury, Jesse llibbs,
and Dynamite Don Williams.
Doth Warner and Jones have car
ried off Coast Championships at one
time or another. Each of them have
put out unbeaten teams. And both
have won national titles, mythical or
otherwise.
But getting back to the subject
of these two masterminds clash
ing wits on the actual field of bat
tle, it is to be noted that exactly
four times before the present sea
son they have pitted their minds
and mind-products against each
other.
Warner has come out on top
twice, Jones once, and on a cer
tain occasion the result was a
deadlock!
Delving back into the history of the
meetings of Pop-coached Stanford
tribes and Sir Howard-coached Tro
jan troops, it is found that in 1925
they came to blows for the first time,
Stanford winning by 13 points to 9.
Turning over pages of the Middle
Ages it is discovered that in 1926 the
Cardinal banner waved victoriously
over the battlefield of Troy with hard
ly a hope of victory, but that night
her warriors returned to the north to
celebrate a 13 to 12 win.
In the Renaissance period of 1927
the two teams clashed on even terms,
and when the smoke of battle had
cleared away it was found that the
dopesters had predicted right for once.
A bit of last-minute strategy by the
Old Fox had changed a certain loss
into a tie game at 13 to 13.
Opening the modern era her
alded as an unbeatable outfit, Mr.
Warner's charges journeyed down
to the Coliseum last year to storm
the Trojan stronghold. Eut after
outgaining, outpunting, and out
passing Jones' boys for a greater
portion of the game, the Redshirts
turned around and beat them
selves. Fumbles, and more fum
bles, combined to rout out the
Cards by a score of 10 to 0.
So much for the past. The future is
"what is bothering Coaches Warner
and Jones at the present time. And
by future, Saturday's fifth meeting is
what is meant!
Pop has a slight edge at the pres
ent time. Whether he keeps on as
head man in the coaching show
largely depends on how the affair of
the 2Gth turns out. His team is on a
par with Mr. Jones.' Both Pop and
Sir Howard will enter the fray on
even terms.
At all events, the 90,000-odd
spectators who cram the Stadium
to overflowing on Saturday after-

noon can wisely look forward for
the unexpected to happen. For
when wizards meet, an awesome
spectacle is brewed.
