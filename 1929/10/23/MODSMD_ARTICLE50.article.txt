## 
### 
Members of the Y.W.C.A. advisory
board of Palo Alto were hostesses at
a tea given yesterday afternoon at the
Women's Clubhouse. The purpose of
the tea was to introduce Miss Mary
Custis Foster, the new secretary of
Stanford's Y.W.C.A. Miss Foster
comes from Mt. Tlolyoke to succeed
Miss Mary Cogswell, last year's secre
tary, who has returned to China. A
secondary purpose of the tea was to
give those who have helped out an
idea of the manner in which their
contributions are being used.
