# HELL WEEK'S ROUGH STUFF MUST GO, SAY FRATERNITIES
## Canvass of Houses Indicates General Trend Toward Abolishment of Physical Abuse; Favor Mental Exercise 
### 
fIUIE objectionable features of Hell Week as practiced by Stanford fraterni
ties shall go.
This was the consensus of opinion as voiced by presidents of the twenty
four Stanford fraternities in a survey made yesterday by the Daily. The
houses on the whole are making a determined effort to cut down the physical
torture of the initiates and to substitute in its place mental exercises, the
survey showed.
The comments of the various presidents of the national fraternities on
the campus follow:

ALPHA DELTA PHf
Dick Stewart: "There is nothing in
our national charter to prevent the
observance of Hell Week. The frater
nity is in favor of it, it is a good in
stitution, and good for the Frosh. The
way we put it on is not harmful."
ALPHA KAPPA LAMBDA
Dick Lean: "Hell Week should be
limited to merely a razzing of the
initiates and all rough stuff should be
abolished. If a happy medium cannot
be reached it would be better to
abolish it altogether."
ALPHA SIGMA PHI
Philip Coats: "The national conven
tion formed a resolution that Hell
Week should be optional with the
chapter. The general feeling seems
to be that it is a mild form and should
be kept up. It harms no one, and is
good for the Frosh in the long run."
ALPHA TAU OMEGA
Max Winter: "The national conven
tion has taken no action on the sub
ject of Hell Week. The fraternity is
in favor of it in a mild form and be
lieves that it should not be abolished."
BETA THETA PI
Harlow Rothert: "No definite na
tional ruling against Hell Week exists
but there is a strong sentiment against
it, and the Stanford chapter has been
cutting down on the rough stuff in the
past few years."
CHI PSI
Paul Murphy: "The National Con
vention, this summer, came out
against Hell Week and this chapter
is trying to abide by that ruling."
DELTA CHI
Larry Hall: "The national conven
tion, this summer was all against Hell
Week. The house is very much op
posed to it, and practically did away
with the observance of such this year."
DELTA KAPPA EPSILON
John McCandless: "Delta Kappa
Epsilon has no national rule on the
subject of Hell Week; it is left up to
the discretion of each chapter. Hell
Week practices are tending to die
away at the Stanford chapter; there
was very little of it this year."
DELTA TAU DELTA
Duke Brown: "Our national body is
opposed to Hell Week and we try to
conform to their wishes but we find
that Hell Week on the Stanford cam
pus is indispensible and thus we make
it a period of learning for the pledges
and of fitting them for the life in the
house."
DELTA UPSILON
Charles Greenfield: "The fraternity
national board takes no stand on the
question of Hell Week. The house, at
a meeting last week, decided to practl
cally do away with it for next year,
although the mental torture is almost
necessary for the Frosli."
KAPPA ALPHA
Ben Card: "The fraternity has na
tional orders against a too strenuous
initiation, but we are in favor of Hell
Week as it stands, a mild form which
works no physical harm is good for
the pledge."
KAPPA SIGMA
Truman Parker: "The fraternity fa
vors Hell Week in a modified form,
though stands for no public exhibi
tions or brutality."
PHI DELTA THETA
Carol Wynn: "Phi Delta Theta has
no national rule about Hell Week, but
last year the national convention
passed a resolution opposing it. The
local chapter is mitigating the prac
tice."
PHI GAMMA DELTA
Bob Kirkwood: "The house has
practically abandoned Hell Week. It
is now very short and does not con
sist of much abuse."
PHI KAPPA PSI
Bob Speers: "Although there is no
hard and last national ruling against
Hell Week in its milder forms, there
is a strong sentiment against it in the
traternity. 'Hie local cliapter observes
the custom only mildly."
Pl-il KAPPA SIGMA
Lincoln Clark: "There is no na
tional rule regarding Hell Week. We
observe an informal initiation, but not
the old-time Hell Week."

PHI SIGMA KAPPA
Jim Bardin: "The fraternity haa a
national ruling against any such ob
servance as that of the ao-called Hell
Week."
SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON
Tom Chichizola: "A mild form of
Hell Week is all right but the more
violent practices should be eliminated.
Ah long as fraternities exist, Hell
Week cannot entirely be abolished
because the tradition is too firmly
embedded."
SIGMA CHI
Lee Flood: "We haven't practiced
any of the rougher forms of Hell
Week for several years and at the
national convention at Portland this
summer the National Organization has
gone on record as opposed to Heil
Week as it used to be."
SIGMA NU
Newton Chapman: "Hell Week ia a
good thing if it is not carried too
far or over done. No regulation by the
Interfraternity Council should be at
tempted, but the matter should be
left entirely up to each individual
house."
THETA CHI
Muirson Wright: "National conven
tion ia against Hell Week. It ia my
opinion that it will be completely
abolished within a year or so. The
sentiment in the houso is against
physical abuse and haa cut it down
greatly."
THETA DELTA CHf
Clay Miller: "Tormenting the
pledges to a limited extent is all right,
but it should be more in the form of
mental worry than physical force."
THETA XI
Jack Nutt: "The fraternity has :io
national rule regarding Hell Week.
But it's not what it used to beâ€”it is
merely a formality. The old Hell
Week haa gone by the board."
ZETA PSI
Charles Fox: "Hell Week is some
thing which should be controlled by
the individual houses, but, personally,
I think that it should be abolished."
