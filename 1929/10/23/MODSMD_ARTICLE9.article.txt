# HELL WEEK'S ROUGH STUFF MUST GO, SAY FRATERNITIES
## Canvass of Houses Indicates General Trend Toward Abolishment of Physical Abuse; Favor Mental Exercise 
### 
fIUIE objectionable features of Hell Week as practiced by Stanford fraterni
ties shall go.
This was the consensus of opinion as voiced by presidents of the twenty
four Stanford fraternities in a survey made yesterday by the Daily. The
houses on the whole are making a determined effort to cut down the physical
torture of the initiates and to substitute in its place mental exercises, the
survey showed.
The comments of the various presidents of the national fraternities on
the campus follow:

ALPHA DELTA PHf
Dick Stewart: "There is nothing in
our national charter to prevent the
observance of Hell Week. The frater

Dick Lean: "Hell Week should be

CHI PSI
Paul Murphy: "The National Con

is trying to abide by that ruling."
DELTA CHI
Larry Hall: "The national conven
tion, this summer was all against Hell
Week. The house is very much op

with the observance of such this year."
DELTA KAPPA EPSILON
John McCandless: "Delta Kappa
Epsilon has no national rule on the
subject of Hell Week; it is left up to
