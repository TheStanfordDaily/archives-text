Crisp as football weather!
Herf/s a great new cereal with all the snap and tang
of sparkling autumn Saturdays.
A cereal so crisp it actually pops and crackles
when you pour on milk or cream. Each golden bubble
packed with wonder flavor.
Try Kellogg's Rice Krispies tomorrow. Ask your
fraternity house steward or favorite campus restaurant
to serve them. They are particularly delicious with
fruit or honey added.
