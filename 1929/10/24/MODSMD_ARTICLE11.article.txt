# Baseball Club Net Money Through Cancelled Game
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Oct. 23 (/P).â€”Failure of
baseball fans to return their tickets for
the sixth World Series game probably
will net the Cubs and Athletics $20,000
more than they had anticipated.
The total value of the pasteboards for
the game that never was played was
$202,000. Approximately $140,000 has
been turned back but the refund will soon
close and those in charge estimate the
clubs will be $20,000 to the good because
of tickets not turned in.
