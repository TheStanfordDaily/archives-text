# San Jose Downs Freshman Soccer Team In Fast Tilt
## 
### 
Putting up a valiant fight, especially
! in the second half, the frosh soccer
team went down 5-0 before the San
Jose State team lead by Doug Taylor,
star center half. As in the previous
games the babes were continually on
the defense and the work of Wash
burn at center half, backed by the
defense, was all that kept the score
as low as it was. The San Jose squad
was adept at handling the ball, and
in teamwork, also, was much superior.
