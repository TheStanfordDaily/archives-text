# Library Gets Sixty-Five Letters Of Poet, Carman
## 
### 
Some sixty-five unpublished early
Bliss Carman letters, revealing the
character of the poet and his method
of work, as well as bibliographical
details concerning his books and
magazine contributions, have been ac
quired by the new Charlotte Ashley
Felton Memorial Library. Much of
this data, which has hitherto been
difficult to secure, is obviously of par
ticular authority when derived from
Carman's own correspondence.
The collection comprises original
letters mostly addressed to Richard
S. Hovey and to Mrs. Hovey, together
with copies (not originals) of their
replies. Carman collaborated with
Hovey actively during this period
(1889-1897), and they were jointly re
sponsible for a number of publica
tions.
