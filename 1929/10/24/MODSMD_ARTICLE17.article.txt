# CARD GRID TEAM RESTS; TROJANS ENTRAIN TONIGHT
## Fleishhacker Slightly Hurt In Practice Last Night; To Play Saturday 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Confident of upsetting the Stanford
Cardinal by even a larger margin
than last year's score, the Thundering
Herd will start its stampede for the
Farm tonight after practice, when
some fifty Trojan football warriors
entrain on the northbound limited.
At the same time Coach Pop War
ner will lead his tribe of white
jerseyed giants into seclusion, some
where in the peaceful foothills near
Los Gatos, to rest up for Saturday's
clash which is heralded from coast to
coast as the "big" game of the week.
Today's more or less light practice
sessions will be the last time that the
players on either team finger a pig
skin until they warm up for the open
ing kickoff on the afternoon of the
2Gth.
Secret Practice
What sort of an attack the Trojans
will use against the Cards is not
known and will not be until the hectic
battle gets under way. Coach Howard
Jones, as well as the Old Fox, has
been working his charges behind
barred gates all week.
It is definitely known, however, that
in the secret sanctitudes of Bovard
Field, the Trojans have been sweat
ing plenty during the past few days
in perfecting a defense to stop Stan
ford's so far uncheckable running at
tack. Yesterday Jones put his regu
lars through a long, tough scrimmage
with Morley Drury's Spartans, a vest
pocket edition of the big Red team.
A short drill on their own attack
will close the Trojans' training period
this afternoon. Jones is expected to
spend considerable time in smoothing
out his aerial offense, as defense
against passes is supposed to be the
Cards' one big weak point. Those who
have followed the Herd closely this
year are of the opinion that the U.S.C.
mentor has a lot of unused plays to
spring on Warner's men, including a
lot of passes.
Jones Undecided
Jones is having about as hard a
time as Pop in deciding just what
epmbination with which to start the
game. There is a possibility of Gar
Arbelbide starting at end instead of
the veteran Steponovitch, as the for
mer is especially adept in snagging
passes. George Templeton may also
replace Anthony at right tackle.
The Cards are in good shape for the
battle, with the exception of Herb
Fleishhacker, who sustained a slight
ly bruised knee in Wednesday's work
out. The smashing behemoth spent
all day yesterday resting up in the
Palo Alto Hospital, but, according to
the Card coaches, should be fit and
ready to see all the action he likes
on Saturday.
