NEW YORK, Oct. 23. (JP)â€”These
are highlights in the Carnegie Founda- j
tion report on American college ath-1
letics:
"The fundamental causes of the de-'
fects of American college athletics are I
through commercialism, and a negli-1
gent attitude toward the educational
opportunities for which the colleges '
exist.
"Commercialism has added to the
amusement of the alumni, but it has
corrupted the moral fibers of uot a
few of them through its temptations j
to recruit and subsidize.
"We talk much of sportsmanship, 1
fair play, the moral value inherent in j
games, but we act as if we believed |
that an ornamental gateway to these !
ends must be provided before the ends |
themselves can be served.
"The notion is that the first essen- '
tial to the execution of any athletic !
policy is money, and plenty of it.
"Aside from the hurried imitative
adoption of a new watchword like
'Athletics for all' or 'Every student
a player,' and a very high regard for
material equipment, the shaping of a
comprehensive administration policy
for athletics has very generally been
neglected.
"The Massachusetts Institute of j
Technology, Oberlin, Reed College, i
the United States Military Academy,
the United States Naval Academy, |
and the University of Toronto may i
be taken as examples in which the
administration of athletics has been
bent to serve first the interests of
the undergraduate and the educational
program as a whole.
"Rowing appears to be the only
major branch of intercollegiate ath
letics from which commercialism is
absent.
Prodigal With Passes
"Some institutions are prodigal
with free passes to games (California,
Southern California, Wisconsin); oue
(Alabama) paid the expenses of news
papermen who accompanied its foot
ball team across the continent.
"At one institute that did not co
operate in the enquiry (Ogletnorpe),
matters of (player) eligibility are nan
died by a baseball coach wno works
also as a registrar. At New York Uni
versity the faculty member charged
with the checking of eligibility
guided by the advice of the liead foot
ball coach and tlie graduate manager.
In a very few instances eligibility is
determined by a body upon which
alumni have majority representation
(Allegheny, Dartmouth). It is never
entirely in the Hands of undergradu
ates.
Coach Must Produce
"At eigiity-three different institu- !
tions the question was asked: 'Is the
tenure of the coach depenuent here !
upon his producing winning teams?' j
Of the replies, those at 33 institutions
were allirmative and 4G were nega
tive, while conflicting opinions were j
expressed at four.
"A common misconception touching
the personal recruiting of athletes for j
intercollegiate competition is tiial ;
most of tne work is done by alumni. |
The facts of our enquiry prove con- j
clusively that this is not the case.
Of 112 colleges and universities visit-'
ed, at only a little over 30 per cent j
was recruiting conducted by alumni.
"Subsidizing in some form or de-1
gree was found to exist at 81 of the j
112 institutions studied. The recruit- j
ing of American college athletes, be ]
it active or passive, professional or J
nonprofessional, has reached the pro-1
portions of nationwide commerce."
