# SUBSIDIZATION OF STANFORD ATHLETES IS INFERRED IN CARNEGIE INSTITUTE STUDY
## Report of Foundation Shows 84 of 112 Colleges Employ Unfair Athletic Methods Officials at Stanford, U.S.C., University of California in Reply to Institute's Report 
### 
Hurling charges at Stanford as well
as many other well-known colleges in
the United States and Canada, the
Carnegie Foundation claims that ath
letes at 84 of the 112 universities
studied are being subsidized in some
manner or other, according to an As
sociated Press dispatch being released
this morning.
At only 28 out of the 112 North
American colleges and universities
studied by the Carnegie Foundation,
was there no evidence found that ath
letes were subsidized by any group
or individual, says the Foundation's
report made public today. Seven of
the 28 are Canadian institutions.
Stanford was one of the schools
studied that did subsidize its athletes.
Among the 28 schools which did not
give help to its athletes are the fol
lowing: University of Chicago, Cor
nell, Illinois, McGill University,
Queens College, Reed College, and
Yale University.
Leading schools that showed evi
dence of subsidizing athletes are:
Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Notre
Dame, University of Colorado, Uni
versity of Idaho, California, Univer
sity of Southern California, University
of Washington, and Stanford. The
112 institutions were selected from
the country's total of 800 colleges and
universities on a basis of geographi
cal distribution.
The Carnegie Foundation report
further goes on to give specific exam
ples of what it means by subsidiza
tion together with the places where
the various means of subsidization are
practiced as follows:
"Local fraternity chapters may pro
vide certain athlete members with
rooms or board or with both at so low
a figure that the arrangement can
be regarded only as an athletic sub
sidy (Franklin and Marshall, New
York University, Ohio Wesleyan, Ore
gon Agricultural, Pennsylvania State.)
"Assistance to needy athletes at
Catholic institutions takes several
forms.
"It may be distributed as scholar
ships from athletic funds, covering
wholly or partly tuition, board and
room, in addition to assistance from
individual alumni (Fordham); or jobs
that provide tuition, board and room
in return for very nominal services
(Notre Dame); or an outright alloca
tion of funds without return except in
Athletic participation (Georgetown).
"Occasionally, the attempt is made
to balance awards to athletes with
those to non-athletes (Holy Cross), so
that no young man will feel that his
muscles alone are sufficient to get him
through, or priests may effect arrange
ments among their own parishioners,
members of the faculty, or friends of
their college by which athletes may
be maintained (Boston College).
"From such practices as these, in
the light of intercollegiate competi
tion, an offer to assist young men to
secure part-time work at the usual
student rate of compensation (Mar
quette) is poles asunder.
"Any favor, however small, that
tends to assist an athlete financially,
if it is done because he is an athlete,
marks the beginning of professional
ism."

Statements obtained from officials
of the three California schools in the
Pacific Coast Conference late last
night showed surprise at the charges
and in most cases absolute denial.
Alfred Masters, graduate manager
at Stanford, refused to make a state
ment but referred all questions to
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, director of
Physical Education. Storey's state v
ment was: "Until such time as I have
the opportunity to digest the report
of the Carnegie Foundation, I do not
believe it would be wise to enter into
a discussion on the subject. I am
sure, however, that the report offers
interesting reading, and when the op
portunity is ripe, official statements
will be forthcoming."

Hurling charges at Stanford as well
as many other well-known colleges in
the United States and Canada, the
Carnegie Foundation claims that ath
letes at 84 of the 112 universities
studied are being subsidized in some
manner or other, according to an As
sociated Press dispatch being released
this morning.
At only 28 out of the 112 North
American colleges and universities
studied by the Carnegie Foundation,
was there no evidence found that ath
letes were subsidized by any group
or individual, says the Foundation's
report made public today. Seven of
the 28 are Canadian institutions.
Stanford was one of the schools
studied that did subsidize its athletes.
Among the 28 schools which did not
give help to its athletes are the fol
lowing: University of Chicago, Cor
nell, Illinois, McGill University,
Queens College, Reed College, and
Yale University.
Leading schools that showed evi
dence of subsidizing athletes are:
Harvard, Columbia, Princeton, Notre
Dame, University of Colorado, Uni
versity of Idaho, California, Univer
sity of Southern California, University
of Washington, and Stanford. The
112 institutions were selected from
the country's total of 800 colleges and
universities on a basis of geographi
cal distribution.
The Carnegie Foundation report
further goes on to give specific exam
ples of what it means by subsidiza
tion together with the places where
the various means of subsidization are
practiced as follows:
"Local fraternity chapters may pro
vide certain athlete members with
rooms or board or with both at so low
a figure that the arrangement can
be regarded only as an athletic sub
sidy (Franklin and Marshall, New
York University, Ohio Wesleyan, Ore
gon Agricultural, Pennsylvania State.)
"Assistance to needy athletes at
Catholic institutions takes several
forms.
"It may be distributed as scholar
ships from athletic funds, covering
wholly or partly tuition, board and
room, in addition to assistance from
individual alumni (Fordham); or jobs
that provide tuition, board and room
in return for very nominal services
(Notre Dame); or an outright alloca
tion of funds without return except in
Athletic participation (Georgetown).
"Occasionally, the attempt is made
to balance awards to athletes with
those to non-athletes (Holy Cross), so
that no young man will feel that his
muscles alone are sufficient to get him
through, or priests may effect arrange
ments among their own parishioners,
members of the faculty, or friends of
