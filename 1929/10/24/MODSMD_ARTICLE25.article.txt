# RESPONSIBILITY RESTS ON FRATERNITIES
## 
### 
From the enlightening statements printed in yesterday's Daily, giving
each fraternity's attitude on the matter of Hell Week, two definite con
clusions can be drawn: that Hell Week is good for the initiates and there
fore must stay; that the physical torture should be eliminated.
Consider the first view-point. Admitted that Hell Week gives the
initiates an appreciation of their proper place by humiliating them. What
of it? It must be a worthy organization that has to create an inferiority
complex and humble its initiates so that they can fully appreciate the
honor of being admitted into the bonds of brotherly love.
It is granted that Hell Week has become a tradition. Of course that
settles it. Whatever is, is right and should be continued to the end of time.
It would be sacrilegious, almost fatal, for Stanford fraternities to abolish
such a venerable, dignified, dear old custom, even though seven of the
fraternities on the campus have national rulings against Hell Week.
It is to be admitted that a certain amount of foolishness is not harmful.
But where this foolishness becomes smut and the "brothers" have to resort
to the paddle to carry it along, this horse-play ceases to be amusing and
becomes an objection for which no self-respecting fraternity should stand.'
The house presidents have agreed that physical torture should be elim
inated, that the rough stuff must go. Just what constitutes physical pun
ishment is left to the discretion of the house presidents. They are placed
in a crucial position. What one fraternity considers mild, another may
not. A definite understanding is needed. It is not within the scope of any
agency, except the University administration, to dictate the policies of the
fraternities.
Acting through their own Interfraternity Council, Stanford fraterni
ties would be taking a definite step to eliminate the objectionable features
of Hell Week by voting to abolish paddling and tubbing, two of the out
standing evils of fraternity life.
