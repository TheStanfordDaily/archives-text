# THE 						RALLY COMMITTEE WORKS
## 
### 
Complaints have been numerous on the campus these past few weeks
against various and sundry evidences of Stanford's lackadaisical spirit at
football games.
Whether the complaints are justified or not, the Rally Committee has
taken them seriously enough to make an effort to inject some vigor into
the rooting and singing of the followers of Pop Warner's machine.
In other columns of the Daily this morning are printed the most
popular of Stanford's songs; booklets containing these songs and the Car
dinal yells will be distributed today at the various living groups.
That is about all the Rally Committee or anyone else can do about the
matter. If students want to sing and yell they have been provided with
one necessary ingredientâ€”words. The other is a voice. The Rally Com
mittee and the Daily cannot provide that.
