# CAMPUS MOTORISTS ARE WARNED
## 
### 
Two traffic accidents have occurred within a year's time on the corner
of Arguello and Portola streets near the Toyon Hall parking area despite
the fact that the intersection is noticeably free from obstructions to vision.
Apparently they were due to negligence or outright recklessness.
Perhaps students have forgotten that automobiles are on probation at
Stanford. Many universities have prohibited their use by students, and
a similar action here would be decidedly inconvenient. It is well to re
member that every accident on the campus will further the possibility of
an abolishment action.
Fortunately, there have been very few misliaps considering the volume
of automobile traffic on the campus. But conditions do not merit a de
crease in caution.
Although the blame for the two accidents mentioned has not been laid
to one person or another, it may be significant to note that in both cases
one of the cars was driven by a visitor to the campus and that it was the
student car that was draped all over the landscape.
