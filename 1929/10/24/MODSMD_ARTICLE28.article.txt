# SOLO FLIGHTS FUTILE
## 
### 
Man is forever challenged by the apparently unconquerable. That is
why we have polar expeditions, big game hunts, and feats of aviation.
Many such undertakings are of scientific value, but many prove only the
spirit of daring in man.
An intrepid flyer, who is comparatively a beginner in aviation, has
undertaken a solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean from the west. What
his reasons are, no one knows. But if he is successful, he will be lauded
by public and press as a hero. If he is not, his widow and a few friends
will mourn for him. No matter what the result of the flight will be, man
kind will not have benefited to any appreciable degree.
Possibility of the voyage has ably been proved by the immortal Lind
bergh. lie played a risky game and won. Another lost. We all wish the
latest adventurer the best of luck in his endeavor, and sincerely hope that
he successfully reaches his goal. But whatever his motive for attempting
the lone flight, the value of it will not be worth the risk of life. Such use
less feats of daring should be discouraged.
