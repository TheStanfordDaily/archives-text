UP TO NOW, By Alf-ed E. Smith.
The Viking Press, 1929. At the
Stanford Bookstore,
After the recent deluge of Cellenio
biographies commemorating the
amours of pot-bellied kings and sanc
timonious sinners, "Up To Now" is a
relief. The volume is of interest de
spite the fact that it is second-hand,
so to speak, having appeared first in
that sterling publication, The Satur
day Evening Post. There is no better
mirror of modern politics than Alfred
Smith's autobiography.
Alfred Smith is an almost unrivaled
master of making politics plain to the
layman. His long training in politics
and simple diction jointly explain this
ability. The stylo is slightly journal
istic, often clever, and very plainly a
product of the author's habit of ex
temporaneous speaking. In brief the
book is Alfred E. Smith plus a proof
reader and minus the bowery accent.
Humorists and republicans will
miss the Post's portraits of Mrs.
Smith's millinery atrocities but will,
no doubt, find consolation and amuse
ment in the 30-odd (some of them
very odd) portraits of the Smith fam
ily in the new volume. The repub
licans may not take as much pleasure
in the boomerangs which they them
selves flung in the late whispering
campaign and which the Happy War
rior here deftly returns.
No one can read "Up To Now" and
believe that A1 Smith is through. The
very title is a promise. You can't keep
a good man down. —B. P.

"Fast Company"—New Stanford
If you like baseball in the theatre
(and if you don't you're no friend of
ours) you ought to enjoy yourselves
at this picture. It's taken from Ring
Lardner's amusing comedy, "Elmer
the Great," and manages to retain
much of the Lardner iiavor.
Jack Oakie gives a swell perform
ance in this pleasant little picture
as the Bush Leaguer sent into the
Big Company. He is no William
Haines, lobbying over a curveless toss
that even a Stanford infielder would
kill, and he swings a bat like he knew
how. Maybe he does.
Evelyn Brent is Evelyn Brent in
this picture. If you like her, all right.
Miss Brent is capable, if sharp-cor
nered. The rest of the cast fits in
without a bitch.
The story of the fat-headed bush
league pitcher who makes good with
the Yankees is even good enough to
follow "The Cocoanuts" —an awful
screened musical comedy which we
saw twice because of the Marx Broth
ers. Two good entertainments in a
row! My, my, what's the world coin
ing to?
"Fast Company," as a title, prob
ably tries to lure a lot of dull wits
into the nicklelodeons on the assump
tion that it's a cocktail "comedy
drama" of the upper crust. "Elmer the
Great" was much better. But "Fast
Company" is pretty fair, brothers,
pretty fair.
We really must see it sometime.
