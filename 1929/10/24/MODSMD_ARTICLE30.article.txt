## I'D DIE FOR DEAR OLD SIWASH! 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The only students who are collegiate
nowadays go to high schools and busi
ness colleges. Scandal-monging newspa
pers continue to commercialize collegiat
ism which is dying rapidly. A conference
of deans has pointed out that the rah-rah
boy is obsolete. The old conceptions of
student spirit are changing.
The modern Stanford man is a very
serious young man. The Son of a Gam
bolier attitude, together with its words,
is almost unknown to him. He acts, and
rightly, as though he were in life and not
as though he were preparing for it.
Undeniably the old Stanford spirit and
traditions are passing out. The height of
wildness at present is to forego a little
studying and go to Paly for a milkshake.
We transfers with our natural indif
ference are a strong force in the destruc
tion of the old order. We come here in
the middle of our course; we have been
upperclassmen for a year in a junior col
lege. We come here to study and behave
sanely. We are beyond the freshman
monkey-business stage and we don't feel
the urge to be picturesque.
The students as a whole appear to tire
of the old arbitrary traditions. No one
follows them, not even those steeped in
the atmosphere of Encina Barracks. Class
divisions and contests, senior ceremonies,
alleged literary magazines, Sequoia wakes,
Dippy-sponsored contests are going out.'
The auto has destroyed the traditions of
the Cactus Gardens.
Except for the task of assigning dates
for club dances, and shrieking good-will
at the team we want to wallop the next
Saturday, Student Body Government has
been replaced by B.A.C. Government.
The honor system has developed into an

efficient schcme for getting outsiders into
football games on unused Student Body
Cards.
Man must have his ritual. He once got
it in church. Now he gets it at games
with a grand display of bands, yells, card
stunts, hymns, fight songs, and loud
speaker announcements of final scores.
But ritual palls with repetition. We want
to watch the game. We can't give the
team enthusiasm; newspaper headlines
and Ail-American prospects do that. The
yell leader has to wheedle and plead for
noise. Then why noise? If an "unquench
able spirit" of which we could be justly
proud is not spontaneous, it is not wor
thy. To think that such coaxed enthusi
asm is fine is an idea as rank as the one
that we are at college only to make ac
quaintances (contacts) with whom we'll
play golf matches in future years while
swinging big business deals.
Traditions with a basis stand a chance
of lasting. Reverence; no smoking on
the Quad; courtesy; rising for the Pres
ident at an assembly; love of a good clean
time; taking a Robleite to a campus
dance.
There remains a spirit on the campus,
a calm pride in the name of the Univer
sity coupled with an easy informality. It
is a spirit that counts.
Innovations arc antiquating the old col
lege institutions: Big Game rallies are
old-fashioned because the newspapers
work up enthusiasm for the contest, root
ing sections and yell leaders because the
coach wins the game, glee clubs because
radios furnish poor music much more
conveniently, and college presidents be
cause someone else runs the school any
way.

The honor system has developed into an

efficient schcme for getting outsiders into
football games on unused Student Body
Cards.
Man must have his ritual. He once got
it in church. Now he gets it at games
with a grand display of bands, yells, card
stunts, hymns, fight songs, and loud
speaker announcements of final scores.
But ritual palls with repetition. We want
to watch the game. We can't give the
team enthusiasm; newspaper headlines
and Ail-American prospects do that. The
yell leader has to wheedle and plead for
noise. Then why noise? If an "unquench
able spirit" of which we could be justly
proud is not spontaneous, it is not wor
thy. To think that such coaxed enthusi
asm is fine is an idea as rank as the one
that we are at college only to make ac
quaintances (contacts) with whom we'll
play golf matches in future years while
swinging big business deals.
Traditions with a basis stand a chance
of lasting. Reverence; no smoking on
the Quad; courtesy; rising for the Pres
ident at an assembly; love of a good clean
time; taking a Robleite to a campus
dance.
There remains a spirit on the campus,
a calm pride in the name of the Univer
sity coupled with an easy informality. It
is a spirit that counts.
Innovations arc antiquating the old col
lege institutions: Big Game rallies are
old-fashioned because the newspapers
work up enthusiasm for the contest, root
ing sections and yell leaders because the
coach wins the game, glee clubs because
radios furnish poor music much more
conveniently, and college presidents be
cause someone else runs the school any
way.

The Editor, Sir:
The only students who are collegiate
nowadays go to high schools and busi
ness colleges. Scandal-monging newspa
pers continue to commercialize collegiat
ism which is dying rapidly. A conference
of deans has pointed out that the rah-rah
boy is obsolete. The old conceptions of
student spirit are changing.
The modern Stanford man is a very
serious young man. The Son of a Gam
bolier attitude, together with its words,
is almost unknown to him. He acts, and
rightly, as though he were in life and not
as though he were preparing for it.
Undeniably the old Stanford spirit and
traditions are passing out. The height of
wildness at present is to forego a little
studying and go to Paly for a milkshake.
We transfers with our natural indif
ference are a strong force in the destruc
tion of the old order. We come here in
the middle of our course; we have been
upperclassmen for a year in a junior col
lege. We come here to study and behave
sanely. We are beyond the freshman
monkey-business stage and we don't feel
the urge to be picturesque.
The students as a whole appear to tire
of the old arbitrary traditions. No one
follows them, not even those steeped in
the atmosphere of Encina Barracks. Class
divisions and contests, senior ceremonies,
alleged literary magazines, Sequoia wakes,
Dippy-sponsored contests are going out.'
The auto has destroyed the traditions of
the Cactus Gardens.
Except for the task of assigning dates
for club dances, and shrieking good-will
at the team we want to wallop the next
Saturday, Student Body Government has
