# ATTACKS THE Y.W.C.A.
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the past few years the Y.W.C.A.
has been seemingly disintegrating; many
women prominent in campus activities
have been leaving its folds. Why is this?
What functions does the "Y" actually
perform on this campus and what does it
plan to do? Not once in its late career
have its activities been felt.
To an outside observer little is appar
ent. Open teas arc held, but unfortunately
they don't seem to go over well. True, the
"Y" has the good purpose of bringing

into it, the only possible organization on
the campus for that, some feeling akin to
religion. But that idea has long been ob
solete. Religion is far too dangerous a
subject to discuss.
Many Stanford women arc laboring
under the impression that the "Y" is only
it is. But this is extremely derogatory to
a political caucus. Who knows? Perhaps
the "Y" and if the illusion is to be dis
pelled, it is up to those girls now work
ing in the "Y" to do it without delay.
