# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....

Tryouts for stuntists to accompany the
combined musical clubs on holiday trips
were announced in the Daily of October
24, 1904. New men especially were urged
to be there to present original ideas.
It was a custom, in bygone days, for
the glee clubs to take along two men
"stuntists" on their trips to amuse the
audiences between numbers. Since then,
the women's glee club has greatly dwin
dled in interest and importance, and never
appears with the men's club. The present
men's glee club makes many trips, espe
cially over the Christmas holidays, hut
the practice of taking along comedians
has fallen into disuse.
George A. Hodge, '06, defeated A. R.
Mac Swain, '08, in the finals of the inter
class singles tournament by the scores of
6-3, 7-5, 6-1.
Hodge was one of the best tennis play
ers of the University. In his last year,

he was the ranking man on the Varsity
team, although he was unable to play in
three of the annual series with California.
In his freshman year he contracted ty
phoid fever three days before the series;
two years later he strained a ligament a
week before the matches, and in his last
year the earthquake, occurring two weeks
before the date of play, stopped athletic
competition. At present Hodge is a divi
sion manager of the South American
Power Corporation at Sao Paulo, Prazil.
The finances of the Little Big Game
of October 15, 1904, were announced in
the Daily. The final account showed that
the attendance was 4,020 and Stanford's
share of the receipts $2 ( 010.
Only 4,021 viewed the Bear Cub-Card
Frosh tilt in 1928, a gain of one person
in 25 years. And in the interval Stan
ford's share of the receipts have shrunk
to a paltry $1,919.50 realized on last
year's game,.
