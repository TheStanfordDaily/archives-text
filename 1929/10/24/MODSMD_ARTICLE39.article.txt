Reserve Strength
Many, many years ago a certain sage
or court jester uttered an adage that
startled the ancient philosophical rabble
and rope makers. He said: "A chain is
as strong as its weakest link."
Although long since moth-eaten and
covered with cobwebs, this same maxim
may dccide the final outcome of Satur
day's blue ribbon football classic between
the Cardinals and the men from Troy.
For a gridiron team is as
strong as its weakest member.
Omitting the water boy, it fol
lows that the playing ability of
the lowliest substitute on a foot
ball squad may largely deter
mine whether or not that pigskin
toting outfit is of championship
caliber.
As for the situation in question, neither
Stanford nor U.S.C. appear to have a
single weak link in their starting lineups.
From end to end, their lines are composed
of hard smashing stalwarts. And each
team possesses a quartet of backfield aces
that rank with the nation's best.
But it is a well known and long es
tablished fact that the eleven men who
start charging down the field on the
opening kickoff very seldom last a whole
game. Football is far too rough and
tough a set-up for that. And though
Saturday's scrap is scheduled to be sixty
minutes of good, clean fun, anyone who
knows just how much Pop's boys love the
Jones' gang is willing to bet his last thin
dime tliat somebody gets dragged off the
turf before many seconds pass.
Thus, substitutes are more
than likely to play leading roles
in the drama of the 26th 1
After witnessing the Washington-Tro- ]
jan farce not so long ago, Coach Warner
grunted loud and lusty praises about Mr. !
Jones' gang. He was especially sonorous j
over the fact that the Trojans had more
first class reserves than he had laid eyes
upon in many a moon. In fact, most of
the second and third string players, who
were injected into the fray from time to
time, displayed more stuff than the so
callcd regulars.
And in checking over the long
list of second rate Trojans, it is
easily understood why Pop is so
enthusiastically worried about
Saturday's final outcome. These
second rate men would rate a
great deal higher in other sec
tions of this fair nation. Not a
few of them verge on all-Ameri
can timber, to say the least.
Although the forward wall subs are
ample good, as is exemplified by the
presence of one Mr. Arbellide at end, it
is in the backfield that the reserve
strength is outstanding. This Mr. Arbel
lide, by the way, is the person who
snagged a couple of neat passes to score,
fourteen points of the Thundering Herd's
total against Oregon State.
Among the more notable of Jones'
youthful ball-packing array are Hill, a
tough boy at full; Duffield, a quarter with
deceptive hips; Shaver, speedy quarter;
Kemp, just a fourth string quarter—but
better than most regular signal barkers
on the Coast; Apsit and Mortensen, two
hard smashing halves; and Moses, touted
as a coming Drury. And this is only a
few of the gang.
However, Pop has a few good lads to
toss into the game when needed himself.
He has Hillraan, and, oh, how this boy
can smash 1 He has Fleishhacker, if Sim
kms starts, and little Herbie is rated as
the best line backer this side of the
Rockies. He has Moffatt, a future Tricky
Dick. He has Clark, small but elusive.
He has Winnek, Caglieri, Neill, Thomp
son, Bogue, Wilson ( Taylor. And he has
a horde of others just about as par cx
ceHent.
Weak links, it seems, are far
and few between. Yet, when two
good football machines come to
gether, one must give. And the
one that gives this coming week
€nd will be the one with the
-weakest reserve strength.
Pick your choice, if you can I
