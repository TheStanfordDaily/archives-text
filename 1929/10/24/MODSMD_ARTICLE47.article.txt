# Sophomore Commuters Join To Elect Cabinet Member
## 
### 
To elect a representative of the
commuters to the Sophomore Wo
men's Cabinet, all sophomore women
who do not live on th'e Row or at
Roble will bring their lunches to the
basement of the Women's Clubhouse
at noon today. Organization of all the
commuters is considered especially
important in order that the smaller
number may take an active part in
the affairs of the rest of the class.
