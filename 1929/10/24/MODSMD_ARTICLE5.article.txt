# SETS IMPORTANT IN PRODUCING MILNE'S "THE IVORY DOOR"
## Very Little Detail and Much Atmosphere Is Stressed In Performance 
### 
Sets for Milne's symbolical play,
"The Ivory Door," which will be given
here on the evening of November 1,
will be an important part of this pro
duction, in which little detail and
much atmosphere are necessary.
Two of the three acts of "The Ivory
Door" take place in the throne room
of King Perivale's palace, and the set
for these acts has been designed and
executed by Frederick Stover, acting
technical director, so as to portray
the essence of a European palace
without being confined to any one
period or any one locale. The entire
room, which is done in rich, warm
colors and large, sweeping lines, fo
cuses, of course, on the Ivory Door,
the legendary door from which no one
has ever returned. Throughout the
whole first act, the door is covered
by a tapestry and the moment in the
third act, in which it is revealed, is a
thrilling one.
There are two scenes in the second
act, during which King Perivale re
turns to his palace from the unknown
terrors behind the door. In the first,
Stover has used massive stones, a
curved staircase, walls, battlements,
and other elements that suggest
"castle" without being commital, for
as Milne writes, the"The Ivory Door"
takes place somewhere far away—
France, perhaps, or Germany—and
long ago—once upon a time. The sec
ond scene of the second act takes
place in the courtyard where, also,
the atmosphere of a European palace
is carried out with heavy stonework,
massive lines, and great proportions.
The lighting in this play is to be
one of the most important elements
because of "the nondescript character
of the sets," as Stover describes it.
The fact that there is little detail and
ornament in the sets which might fix
the play as to period and locale, has
given great freedom to the electri
cians, directed by Joe Gordon.
Stover came here from Yale a few
weeks ago to take Harold Helven
ston's place for a year as technical
director, while the latter fills Gordon
Davis' place as director. Helvenston
and Stover worked together in the
Yale Dramatic School.
