# FRESHMEN PERFECT OFFENSIVE FOR USE AGAINST BRUIN TEAM
## Defensive Remains As Babes' Long Suit; To Improve Blocking, Tackling 
### 
With two days to go before the
Stanford freshman grid team faces
the U.C.L.A. babes in the preliminary
to the Cardinal-Trojan encounter,
Coach "Husky" Hunt is attempting to
work up an attack capable of pene
trating the Bruin defense.
The yearling Redshirts have not
had an easy game on their schedule
this year, and while their defensive
playing has improved because of the
heavy opposition, they have had no
opportunity to perfect an offense. This
has held true in scrimmages as well
as in games, for the frosh usually go
up against the strong Gray team dur
ing the afternoon practice sessions,
and the latter has been known to give
the varsity plenty of trouble.
While the last contest with the
U.S.C. frosh showed a lot of weak
nesses which will have to be ironed
out, there is also plenty of improve
ment evident over the form displayed
earlier this year. The frosh have im
proved their tackling and blocking a
great deal, and with a win under
their belt would probably gain the
confidence necessary to push a suc
cessful offensive drive.
Paul Targhetta and Homer Boushey
are having a great old time fighting
for the quarterback position. Targhet
ta<, weighing about 180 pounds, is
twenty pounds to the good on
Boushey, but the latter has shown
more ability in handling the team.
Nelson Gray, 197-pound tackle, was
an improved player in the U.S.C.
game, and should be heard from in the
contest with U.C.L.A.
