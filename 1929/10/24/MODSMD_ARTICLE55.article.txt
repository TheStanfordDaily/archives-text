morning at 10 o'clock and at the
U.S.C. game rally tonight at 7 o'clock
in the Pavilion. The Rally Committee
requests that everyone bring a copy
of these songs to the assembly and
rally:
HAIL, STANFORD, HAIL
(Key of Fâ€”Starting note C)
Where the rolling foothills rise
Up toward mountains higher,
Where at eve the Coast Range lies
In the sunset fire,
Flushing deep and paling,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Refrain:
From the foothills to the bay
It shall ring
As we sing,
It shall ring and float away.
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Hail, Stanford, Hail!
Tender vistas ever new
Through the arches meet the eyes,
Where red roofs rim the blue
Of the sun-steeped skies
Flecked with cloudlets sailing,
Here we raise our voices, hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
Refrain:
When the moonlight bathed arcade
Stands in evening calms,
When the night wind, half afraid,
Whispers in the palms
Far-off swelling, failing,

Student voices glad are hailing
Thee, our Alma Mater.
