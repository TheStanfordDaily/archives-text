# COME JOIN THE BAND
## 
### 
(Key of Câ€”Starting note G)
Come, join the band,
And give a cheer for Stanford red;
Throughout the land
Our banner waving overhead;
Stanford, for you,
Each loyal comrade brave and true,
With might and main sings this refrain,
"Forever and forever Stanford red."
After the game,
When Stanford red has won the day,
Praising her name
Down on the field we'll force our way
And on the green
Each man who joins the serpentine
With might and main sings this refrain,
"Forever and forever Stanford red."
