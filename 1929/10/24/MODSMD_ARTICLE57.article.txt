# TROJAN HORSE
## 
### 
In the days of long ago the mighty
Trojan host
Held that they were the warriors
supreme, |
But a simple wooden horse upset their
mighty boast,
And their glory became but a dream.
Now the Trojans have a namesake
down at Southern Cal.,
And they're boastful as boastful can
be.
But they're going to meet their match,
because the Cardinal
Will play horse with U.S.C.
