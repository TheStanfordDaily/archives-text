# SECRETARY WILBUR LIKED BY NATIONAL PARK SERVICE MEN
## New Plans For National Parks Are Approved by Superintendent 
### 
"We of the National Park Service
are particularly pleased and honored
to work under Secretary of the In
terior Ray Lyman Wilbur because he
is a westerner, an outdoor man, and
one genuinely interested in extension
and development of our national
parks," said Superintendent M. R.
Tillotson, of the Grand Canyon Na
tional Park, who visited the campus
yesterday. Mrs. Tillotson is accom
panying him on a tour of the parks
before he returns to Grand Canyon.
Tillotson is returning from a confer
ence of National Park Superintend
ents held in Yellowstone last month,
at which Dr. Wilbur was director.
He expressed himself as being
heartily in accord with Dr. Wilbur's
plan of stressing the educational op
portunities of the national parks.
Under the plan, visitors would be
shown the geological, animal, and
other natural features, as well as the
scenery. President Hoover has also
taken a keen interest in the develop
ing service, according to Tillotson.
Park Service as a vocation is at
tracting an increasing number of col
lege-trained men, many of whom,
starting as temporary rangers during
the summer months, have continued
as permanent rangers, making it their
life work, said the superintendent.
At the opening of the superintend
ents' conference, a great buffalo
roundup was held in Yellowstone in
honor of Secretary and Mrs. Wilbur,
who were accompanied on the trip
by their eon, Ray Lyman, Jr., and by
Mr. and Mrs. Northcutt Ely, executive
assistant to the Secretary.
In answer to the question often
asked him, "Will Boulder Dam fill the
Grand Canyon with water?" Tillotson,
who is a member of the American So
ciety of Civil Engineers, reassured
that it would not.
