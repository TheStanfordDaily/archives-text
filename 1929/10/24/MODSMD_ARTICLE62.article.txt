"The truth quick," newspaper slo
gan, should be the aim of the modern
research worker, according to Profes
sor William Hav/ley Davis, editor of
the Stanford University Press, who
spoke on "Publication" in an address
before the Science Association last
night.
"One remediable defect in the pres
ent situation can, I think, be demon
strated. It is the tendency to regard
publication as distinct from research
and inferior to it instead of as an
inseparable part of it. Time was, no
doubt, when the investigator was and
could remain an investigator merely,
intent only upon the results of his
investigation and heedless of their dis
position, their publication. The learned
world, his duty to fellow-workers and
to his own further work no longer
permits this attitude," declared Pro
fessor Davis.
