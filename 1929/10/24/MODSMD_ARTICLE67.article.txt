# Senior Pictures Must Be Taken At Once For Quad
## 
### 
Seniors who have not yet made ap
pointments for having their Quad pic
tures taken should do so immediately,
as senior pictures will not be taken
very much longer. Call the editorial
office of the Quad, Palo Alto 61G1, to
make appointments.
To have his picture in the Quad, a
senior must have either bought a
Quad or made a deposit of three dol
lars, the balance payable later. For
seniors, the price of the book is seven
dollars.
