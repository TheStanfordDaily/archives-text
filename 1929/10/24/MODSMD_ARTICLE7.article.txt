# Women's Glee Club Plans Change In Type Of Songs
## 
### 
At its first meeting of the year
last night, the Stanford Women's Glee
Club decided to change the character
of its programs in a way designed to
make them more popular on the cam
pus. Lighter, more collegiate, often
comic songs will be substituted for
the classics formerly used. The club
hopes to make itself a nucleus for
campus singing.
The new officers are: Catherine
Musante, president; Olive Mott, vice
president and librarian; and Muriel
Stearns, secretary-treasurer. Weekly '
meetings will be held on Wednesday
nights from 7 to 8. Anyone wishing
to join the Glee Club will be wel
comed at the next meeting.
