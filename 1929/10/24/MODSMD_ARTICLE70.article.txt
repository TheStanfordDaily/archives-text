# SPORTS OF 1929

### BY FEG MURRAY 
The year 1862 may be noted for cer
tain battles of the Civil War, but it is
also famous as the year that gave Amos
Alonzo Stagg to the world. First this
man Stagg was famous as the greatest
college athlete in America before he be
came known as one of the country's great
est football coaches. But I have a hunch
that Mr. Stagg would prefer to be known
as a splendid force in character building
and a maker of real men.
A. Alonzo Stagg has been coach of the
University of Chicago football teams
since 1892. Hence this is his thirty-eighth
season. When he went to Chicago as as
sociate professor and director of the De
partment of Physical Culture and Ath
letics, he also played on the football team,
being its captain as well as its coach ! The
story is told of how Stagg once scored
a touchdown for Chicago by running
around a mounted policeman whose horse
had wandered out on the field during the
game!
Young Alonzo's athletic career began
at Orange High School, New Jersey, and,
strangely, it was in baseball, and not foot
ball, that he first won fame. After a
time at Phillips-Exeter Academy, Stagg
went to Yale, where he worked his way
through college, living on as little as
twenty-five cents a day sometimes. He
was an unbeatable pitcher, and in 1888
struck out twenty Princeton batters in
one game He played on the Yale foot
ball team for five years, and was chosen
as end on Walter Camp's first All-Afner
ican team in 1889. (Graduates played on
the team then, and I bet the "Old Man"
wishes he could use some graduates now
at Chicago!)

This fine old gentleman is really one
of the wonders of athletics. Still active
enough to play tennis almost daily, Stagg
is now moulding a much more powerful
football machine than he had last sea
son.
