# THRILLS OF FLIGHT TO MOON IN GERMAN FILM JUST RELEASED
## Scenes Approximated With Shooting of Rocket Between Lands 
### Catherine Spaulding 
All the thrills of a flight to the
moon which in this age of experi
ments is no longer such a very fan
tastic dream are depicted in Fritz
Lang's latest silent Ufa film, "The
Girl in the Moon," shown for the first
time in Berlin, according to the Chris
tian Science Monitor.
True German thoroughness in scien
tific considerations of a flight to the
moon as shown in this film were
based on careful calculations carried
out by Professor Hermann Obertb, a
leading expert on the subject of pene
tration into space. The most thrilling
scene of the film is that of the start,
when the rocket shoots up into space
and disappears in a starlit sky flying
11,200 kilometers per second.
As fantastic as this story may ap
pear there is only a step between this
film and its realization in part, for
Professor Oberth is now building a
trial rocket of huge dimensions, which
is nearing completion so that its
shooting is expected at the end of
this month.
His rockets are not to leave the
earth, but they are to travel from one
continent to another through "strato
sphere" where they can move with
great speed because there is no air
form of head resistance.
The first trial rocket now under
construction near Potsdam has a
length of 10 meters and will travel
one kilometer per second. It carries
sufficient fuel for 44 seconds. Since
it will be shot up vertically into the
air it will reach a minimum height
of 44,000 meters which will carry it
out of the earth's atmosphere into the
so-called "stratosphere" where there
is no air. But it will still be within
the range of the earth's gravity.
The rocket will be shot off from a
small island in the Baltic Sea and
will therefore come to earth on the
sea. Since it carries oxygen, this is
expected to freeze in water, prevent
ing the rocket from sinking.
Protessor Oberth's rocket is not
shot off into space by one single ex
plosion, but is self-propelling. It is
not driven forward by explosions but
by the burning of jets of gas pro
duced by gasoline burning in liquid
oxygen. Oberth's aim is to construct
a rocket which he can shoot from
Europe to the United States. In this
way it is hoped to send mail from
Europe to the United States and vice
versa through the "stratosphere" in
half an hour.

True German thoroughness in scien
tific considerations of a flight to the
moon as shown in this film were
based on careful calculations carried
out by Professor Hermann Obertb, a
leading expert on the subject of pene
tration into space. The most thrilling
scene of the film is that of the start,
when the rocket shoots up into space
and disappears in a starlit sky flying
11,200 kilometers per second.
As fantastic as this story may ap
pear there is only a step between this
film and its realization in part, for
Professor Oberth is now building a
trial rocket of huge dimensions, which
is nearing completion so that its
shooting is expected at the end of
this month.
His rockets are not to leave the
earth, but they are to travel from one
continent to another through "strato
sphere" where they can move with
great speed because there is no air
form of head resistance.
The first trial rocket now under
construction near Potsdam has a
length of 10 meters and will travel
one kilometer per second. It carries
sufficient fuel for 44 seconds. Since
it will be shot up vertically into the
air it will reach a minimum height
of 44,000 meters which will carry it
out of the earth's atmosphere into the
so-called "stratosphere" where there
is no air. But it will still be within
the range of the earth's gravity.
The rocket will be shot off from a
small island in the Baltic Sea and
will therefore come to earth on the
sea. Since it carries oxygen, this is
expected to freeze in water, prevent
ing the rocket from sinking.
Protessor Oberth's rocket is not
shot off into space by one single ex
plosion, but is self-propelling. It is
not driven forward by explosions but
by the burning of jets of gas pro
duced by gasoline burning in liquid
oxygen. Oberth's aim is to construct
a rocket which he can shoot from
Europe to the United States. In this
way it is hoped to send mail from
Europe to the United States and vice
versa through the "stratosphere" in
half an hour.
All the thrills of a flight to the
moon which in this age of experi
ments is no longer such a very fan
tastic dream are depicted in Fritz
Lang's latest silent Ufa film, "The
Girl in the Moon," shown for the first
time in Berlin, according to the Chris
tian Science Monitor.
