### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Oct. 23. (/P)â€”
The student board of control at the
University of Washington accepted
the resignation of Enoch Bagshaw as
head football coach at the institution
late today.
Bagshaw's resignation submitted
early today, culminated a long con
troversy between members of the stu
dent body and the alumn on one side
and supporters of the veteran coach
on the other. Demands for the resigna
tion became more pronounced after
the defeat last Saturday at Pullman
of the university Huskies by the
Washington State College Cougars.
Bagshaw will remain at the head
of football affairs for the present sea
son and will receive full compensa
tion for the two years additional
which his contract has to run.
