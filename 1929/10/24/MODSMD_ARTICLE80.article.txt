## Renowned French Abbe Will Deliver Three Speeches While at Stanford

The Abb 6 Ernest Dimnet, author of
the widely discussed "Art of Think
ing," will speak on the subject of
this recently published book next
Sunday evening at 7:30 o'clock in the
Memorial Church. On the following
Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, he
will talk on Modern French Poetry
in the Assembly Hall. The Abb 6 bases
his discussion on the poetry of Ma
dame de Noailles and Paul Valery.
The success of Dimnet's book in
duced the president of Harvard Uni
versity to invite him to give a series
of lectures on Lowell in October, 1919.
The resultant success of the series
was renewed at the 1923 session of
the Williamstown Institute of Politics.
Since then, Abb 6 Dimnet has come
from his home in Paris to America
each autumn to lecture to American
audiences. The Abb 6 speaks English
fluently, and has long been knowu as
a writer both in French, his own
language, and in English. For thirty
years he has been an interpreter of
French culture to Anglo Saxons.
