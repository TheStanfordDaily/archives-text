### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 23. (/P)—"So far
as the University or its officials are
concerned, we have frowned upon any
practice that would have for its end
the subsidizing of athletes. Every ef
fort has been made to stop such prac
tices.
"However, there are times when
overentliusiastic alumni will assist
some promising athlete in the way of
paying his expenses. We try to dis
courage that, for we know it is not

good for the athlete or for the game,
but we are not always able to do so.
"Long ago we abandoned the habit
of promising an athlete a definite job.
The most that is ever done, as might
be done with any student, is to say
that we will attempt to aid him in
the matter of securing work.
"I am sure that California has a
clean reputation, and as I have said,
every time anything of the sort crops
up, we do what we can to stamp it
out."
