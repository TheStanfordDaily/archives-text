# SEQUOIA'S RISING BELL IS PERSISTENT ALARM FOR PAST FIVE YEARS
## 
### 
For the past five years, denizens of
Sequoia have been awakened each
morning by the sound of an old brass
bell beaten by the head hasher. On
bright and sunny mornings, the bell
sounds for several minutes, while
stormy weather is greeted by half
hearted tones; but, rain or shine, the
barbaric music is always welcome be
cause it means breakfast-time.
The bell has had a varied existence,
and was first seen on the campus as
the property of Herbert Hoover, Jr.
Hoover mounted the bell in locomo
tive fashion on his cut-down Ford,
and rang it to warn the populace
against collision. The previous history
of the bell remains a mystery.
At present it is Don Kropp who
beats the merry tattoo on the bell's
bronze sides. He holds a record for
ringing the bell for four consecutive
minutes, much to the disgust of
sleepy-heads. Wong, Sequoia's cook,
once furnished a Chinese gong for
the purpose, but it was found to be
impractical because it lacked the vol
ume of the bell.
