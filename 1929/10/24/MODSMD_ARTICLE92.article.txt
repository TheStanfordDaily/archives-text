SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 22. (£>)—
The Russian plane "Land of the So
viets" on a flight from Moscow to
New York City, landed here this after
noon, an overnight stop, to proceed
tomorrow morning to Cheyenne, Wyo.
Possibility that the flight may be
continued eastward from New York
in an attempted transatlantic flight
was indicated by S. A. Shestakov,
chief pilot, who said that while his
plans after reaching New York were
indefinite, an attempt might be made
to cross the Atlantic.
