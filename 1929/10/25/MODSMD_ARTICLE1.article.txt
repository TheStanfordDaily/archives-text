# CARNEGIE PROBE BRINGS REPLIES FROM' SPORTDOM
## Too Much Emphasis on Sport Cramps Scholastic Growth, Says Sensational Report Old-Time Grid Stars Enter Protest Against Charges Of Carnegie Foundation 
### 
From all parts of the collegiate
sport world came denials and com
ments from football participants,
school officials, and old-time stars re
garding the salient charges made
Thursday against subsidization of col
lege athletics.
The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching in its in
dictment of the present-day athletic
system, reported, in part, the follow
ing:
One-seventh of all athletes are sub
sidized. Recruiting has advanced to
such a point that school stars hawk
their services. Exaggerated athletic
emphasis has diverted many institu
tions from intellectual development.
Alumni inveigle stars into college.
Coaches are too busy to teach sports
manship. Press exploitation has
brought "demoralizing publicity." Only
28 of 112 colleges were not engaged
in recruiting. College heads have
evaded responsibility for commercial
ization.
Stanford Considered
In considering current practices, the
report indicated that Stanford gives
approximately 50 scholarships not
designated as athletic scholarships.
Southern California gives $40,000 in
similar scholarships.
Alumni assistance to athletes was
reported at both Stanford and South
ern California. An intensively organ
ized recruiting system was found "at
Southern California.
Charges that some coaches had ad
ministered drugs to football players
were included in the sensational study
made by the Carnegie Foundation.
The report of the institute caused
nothing more than a ripple of interest
and many denials in Big Ten circles.
Old-Timers in Denial
Football stars of another generation
lined up with those of the present in
a booming chorus of denial to the re
port of the Foundation's accusation of
"widespread practice of recruiting and
subsidizing athletics."
George Clark, Stanford football cap
tain in 1904, said: "The report, it
seems to me, is exaggerated. I know
that in my time there were no paid
athletes."
W. H. Harrelsdn, quarterback on
the Stanford team manage, by Presi
dent Herbert Hoover in lin student
days at the University, gave his opin
ion: "In my day the scholastic stand
ing of the athlete was of the highest.
I think the foundation's report is a
bit far-fetched.
Muller's View
Harold "Brick" Muller, former all-
American end at U.C., said: "As far
as I know the University of California
never paid any athletes. Sometimes a
job may be found for a student who
is financially unable to stay in college.
That's perfectly fair."
Clifford "Biff" Hoffman, last year's
Stanford captain and fullback, made
this statement: "The survey, in my
opinion, is untrue and most unfair."

sport world came denials and com
ments from football participants,
school officials, and old-time stars re
garding the salient charges made
Thursday against subsidization of col
lege athletics.
The Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching in its in
dictment of the present-day athletic
system, reported, in part, the follow
ing:
One-seventh of all athletes are sub
sidized. Recruiting has advanced to
such a point that school stars hawk
their services. Exaggerated athletic
emphasis has diverted many institu
tions from intellectual development.
Alumni inveigle stars into college.
Coaches are too busy to teach sports
manship. Press exploitation has
brought "demoralizing publicity." Only
28 of 112 colleges were not engaged
in recruiting. College heads have
evaded responsibility for commercial
ization.
Stanford Considered
In considering current practices, the
report indicated that Stanford gives
approximately 50 scholarships not
designated as athletic scholarships.
Southern California gives $40,000 in
similar scholarships.
Alumni assistance to athletes was
reported at both Stanford and South
ern California. An intensively organ
ized recruiting system was found "at
Southern California.
Charges that some coaches had ad
ministered drugs to football players
were included in the sensational study
made by the Carnegie Foundation.
The report of the institute caused
nothing more than a ripple of interest
and many denials in Big Ten circles.
Old-Timers in Denial
Football stars of another generation
lined up with those of the present in
a booming chorus of denial to the re
port of the Foundation's accusation of
"widespread practice of recruiting and
subsidizing athletics."
George Clark, Stanford football cap
tain in 1904, said: "The report, it
seems to me, is exaggerated. I know
that in my time there were no paid
athletes."
W. H. Harrelsdn, quarterback on
the Stanford team manage, by Presi
dent Herbert Hoover in lin student
days at the University, gave his opin
ion: "In my day the scholastic stand
ing of the athlete was of the highest.
I think the foundation's report is a
bit far-fetched.
Muller's View
Harold "Brick" Muller, former all-
American end at U.C., said: "As far
as I know the University of California
never paid any athletes. Sometimes a
job may be found for a student who
is financially unable to stay in college.
That's perfectly fair."
Clifford "Biff" Hoffman, last year's
Stanford captain and fullback, made
this statement: "The survey, in my
opinion, is untrue and most unfair."
