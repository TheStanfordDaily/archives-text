# FACULTY MEMBER SAYS HELL WEEK ACTION BASED ON URGE OF MASTERY
## 
### 
"The procedure of hell week is
based upon the old urge of mastery,
and the resultant physical and mental
effects are comparable to the effects
of a week of influenza." This was the
opinion expressed by one of the mem
bers of the faculty in the phychology
department last night in an interview.
He asked that his name be withheld.
"The physical and mental effects
of 'hell week' are about comparable
to the effects of a week of the In
fluenza. While the indignities and mild
tortures inflicted on the neophyte dur
ing hell week may be so inflicted in
the spirit of fun, few would think it
fun to cause a friend to have the flu
for a week.
"The question that faces the fra
ternities is fliat of putting the neo
phyte through an experience that he
will remember and that will put him
in the proper spirit for the solemn
rites of the formal initiation," he con
tinued, "without making him suffer
indignities that he will remember
after he has forgotten the solemn part
of the affair, and without causing
damage to his ideals and even to his
mental and physical make-up. This is
a difficult problem, but it is one that
should be settled.
"Theoretically, the antics which the

neophyte is forced to perform are to
make him humble —to'realize his own
unimportance. The commands that he
must obey are supposed to be given in
friendly spirit and for the good of
the neophyte. However it is probable
that the basic thing beneath the hell
week procedure is the old urge to mas
tery—the love of making someone
obey orders.
"It should be realized that not all
men are responsive in the same way
to the same stimuli. Things that are
not in the least harmful to one man
might be highly injurious to another.
Most people know the case of the
man who died during initiation last
year in Texas. He was forced to crawl
unclad between two bedsprings which
were attached to an electric circuit
and he died just as he finished the
feat. It was his sensitiveness to the
stimulus of electricity, and not. the
force of the current, that killed him.
This is only one example of injury
from an apparently harmless prank.
''Sonio of the quests on which the
neophyte is sent cause a good deal
of disturbance in the community in
which he lives, and his attempts to
carry out his orders to bring a cer
tain thing home or accomplish a cer-
tain task sometimes cause him to in
cur serious risks. Often he must steal
some article, or disturb someone, and
such action may upset his ideals of
honesty or morals. He may have to do
such things but once or twice; never
theless, It may be a start in the break
ing down of the moral fiber.
"If it happens that some neophyte
feels that some upperclass member of
the house is antagonistic to him, the
indignities that are'heaped upon him
are apt to cause him to cherish a
lasting feeling of animosity toward
that upperclassman, no matter how
much of a sport he tries to be.
"Breaking habits of sleep, expend
ing energy in excess, and the constant
nervous strain are very upsetting to
the individual, and cause mental slug
gishness that is detrimental to the
scholastic work.
"It is probably true that hell week
activities have the desired effect, at
least in part, but it is doubtful
whether the results obtained are
worth the risks and dangers involved.
It really comes to the question of
whether the fraternities should con
tinue with initiatory rites that would
furnish amusement to the Bushmen
of Australia, or whether some more
dignified and less-dangerous method
should be employed to put the initiate
in the proper receptive frame of
mind."
