# STANFORD FACES TROY
## SELLOUT CROWD TO GREET CARDS, U.S.C., WITH WESTERN FOOTBALL TITLE AT STAKE Warnermen Fighting to Avenge Defeat of Last Season; Southerners Rule Slight Favorites as Critics Look for Open Game From Both Teams 
### STEPHEN DIETRICH 
RIGHTING to avenge last year's unexpected defeat down in the land of Troy
and at the same time battling to get a strangle-hold on the Coast Con
ference championship, Coach Pop Warner's giant Cardinal varsity will swing
into action tomorrow afternoon to turn back the powerful invasion of the
1 hundering Herd. Stanford will be the underdog, when the opening kick-off"
goes soaring down the field. The main reasons for the Trojan odds lie in
the fact that U.S.C. has piled up larger scores and has displayed a better

in games played to date. The
[ edge is slight, however, and even the
j most biased sport critics have pre
| dieted tomorrow's clash a toss-up.
Wide-Open Affair
The game is expected to be a wide
open aftair, with each team shoving
! across a couple of scores or more.
I Coach Howard Jones, in an early-week
| statement, admitted that his charges
would put over at least two touch
downs. Stanford's past record speaks
for itself, for no team this season has
been able to check the Cards' diversi
' collection of line smashes, re
| verses, spin plays, laterals, and passes.
Yet again, the score may be small
I and close as it has been during the
past four years. In the last four games
that the two teams have clashed, both
j outfits have featured with strong de
fensive play, and the only scoring has
been due to the direct results of fum
bles and breaks. With each team
; keyed up to a high pitch, a similar
fate may decide the issue this week
! end.
Thrills Looked For
Not one of the 90,000-odd spectators
who fill the stands tomorrow will
j know just what to expect in the way
of offensive thrills and surprises. Both
teams have been working out behind
j barred gates all week, perfecting their
defense and undoubtedly imbibing a
| few new tricks to spring before many
: of the sixty minutes of play fly past.
Psychology and scouting may prove
1 to be the deciding issues tomorrow.
Last year the Redshirts were so over
confident that they marched out on
the field a beaten team. Tomorrow the
Cards will be favorites to lose. As for
scouting, both Coaches Warner and
Jones have had an eyeful or more of
j the opposing team in action. Whether
j either of them have seen enough to
j pull the game out of the fire remains
I to be seen. (
Squads in Good Shape
Each squad is in good shape for the
battle. Aspit and Mortenson, halfbacks
for U.S.C., are ready to go into the
fray at any time Saturday, leaving
the Southern team without a single
injury. Stanford has not fared quite
so well. Pete Heiser, at guard, is defi
nitely out of the picture, while Herb
Fleishhacker's knee is still bothering
him to some extent. Mar Albertson
and Ham Wilson, substitute center
and guard respectively, were both out
of yesterday's practice session with
foot injuries, but both of them are ex
pected to be ready to play tomorrow.
These losses to the Cardinal outfit
are largely made up by the return of
Bill Simkins, Johnny Preston, and
Harlow Rotliert onto the first-string
lineup. All three of these men are ex
members of the Crutch Carriers Club,
yet are scheduled to play important
roles toward getting a Stanford vic
tory.
Schedule Stiff Workout
Contrary to previous reports, Coach
Warner will put his players through a
stiff signal practice this afternoon.
The entire team will return to the
campus in time for eight o'clocks this
morning, and will not go into seclu
sion again until after the flood lights
on the practice fluid grow dim.
Following are the starting lineups
for the "big" event, although tliov are
both subject to last-minute changes:
US.C. — Stanford —

RIGHTING to avenge last year's unexpected defeat down in the land of Troy
and at the same time battling to get a strangle-hold on the Coast Con
ference championship, Coach Pop Warner's giant Cardinal varsity will swing
into action tomorrow afternoon to turn back the powerful invasion of the
1 hundering Herd. Stanford will be the underdog, when the opening kick-off"
goes soaring down the field. The main reasons for the Trojan odds lie in
the fact that U.S.C. has piled up larger scores and has displayed a better

in games played to date. The
[ edge is slight, however, and even the
j most biased sport critics have pre
| dieted tomorrow's clash a toss-up.
Wide-Open Affair
The game is expected to be a wide
open aftair, with each team shoving
! across a couple of scores or more.
I Coach Howard Jones, in an early-week
| statement, admitted that his charges
would put over at least two touch
downs. Stanford's past record speaks
for itself, for no team this season has
been able to check the Cards' diversi
' collection of line smashes, re
| verses, spin plays, laterals, and passes.
Yet again, the score may be small
I and close as it has been during the
past four years. In the last four games
that the two teams have clashed, both
j outfits have featured with strong de
fensive play, and the only scoring has
been due to the direct results of fum
bles and breaks. With each team
; keyed up to a high pitch, a similar
fate may decide the issue this week
! end.
Thrills Looked For
Not one of the 90,000-odd spectators
who fill the stands tomorrow will
j know just what to expect in the way
of offensive thrills and surprises. Both
teams have been working out behind
j barred gates all week, perfecting their
defense and undoubtedly imbibing a
| few new tricks to spring before many
: of the sixty minutes of play fly past.
Psychology and scouting may prove
1 to be the deciding issues tomorrow.
Last year the Redshirts were so over
confident that they marched out on
the field a beaten team. Tomorrow the
Cards will be favorites to lose. As for
scouting, both Coaches Warner and
Jones have had an eyeful or more of
j the opposing team in action. Whether
j either of them have seen enough to
j pull the game out of the fire remains
I to be seen. (

who fill the stands tomorrow will
j know just what to expect in the way
of offensive thrills and surprises. Both
teams have been working out behind
j barred gates all week, perfecting their
defense and undoubtedly imbibing a
| few new tricks to spring before many
: of the sixty minutes of play fly past.
Psychology and scouting may prove
1 to be the deciding issues tomorrow.
Last year the Redshirts were so over
confident that they marched out on
the field a beaten team. Tomorrow the
Cards will be favorites to lose. As for
scouting, both Coaches Warner and
Jones have had an eyeful or more of
j the opposing team in action. Whether
j either of them have seen enough to
j pull the game out of the fire remains
I to be seen. (
Squads in Good Shape
Each squad is in good shape for the
battle. Aspit and Mortenson, halfbacks
for U.S.C., are ready to go into the
fray at any time Saturday, leaving
the Southern team without a single
injury. Stanford has not fared quite
so well. Pete Heiser, at guard, is defi
nitely out of the picture, while Herb
Fleishhacker's knee is still bothering
him to some extent. Mar Albertson
and Ham Wilson, substitute center
and guard respectively, were both out
of yesterday's practice session with
foot injuries, but both of them are ex
pected to be ready to play tomorrow.
These losses to the Cardinal outfit
are largely made up by the return of
Bill Simkins, Johnny Preston, and
Harlow Rotliert onto the first-string
lineup. All three of these men are ex
members of the Crutch Carriers Club,
yet are scheduled to play important
roles toward getting a Stanford vic
tory.
Schedule Stiff Workout
Contrary to previous reports, Coach
Warner will put his players through a
stiff signal practice this afternoon.
The entire team will return to the
campus in time for eight o'clocks this
morning, and will not go into seclu
sion again until after the flood lights
on the practice fluid grow dim.
Following are the starting lineups
for the "big" event, although tliov are
both subject to last-minute changes:
US.C. — Stanford —
Tappaan LER Muller (c)
Hoff LTR Tandy
Barrager (c) LGR Dawson
Dye C Heinecke
Galloway RGL Driscoll
Anthony RTL Artman
Steponovich REL Preston
Saunders Q Smalling
Edelson LHR Rothert

RIGHTING to avenge last year's unexpected defeat down in the land of Troy
and at the same time battling to get a strangle-hold on the Coast Con
ference championship, Coach Pop Warner's giant Cardinal varsity will swing
into action tomorrow afternoon to turn back the powerful invasion of the
1 hundering Herd. Stanford will be the underdog, when the opening kick-off"
goes soaring down the field. The main reasons for the Trojan odds lie in
the fact that U.S.C. has piled up larger scores and has displayed a better

in games played to date. The
[ edge is slight, however, and even the
j most biased sport critics have pre
| dieted tomorrow's clash a toss-up.
Wide-Open Affair
The game is expected to be a wide
open aftair, with each team shoving
! across a couple of scores or more.
I Coach Howard Jones, in an early-week
| statement, admitted that his charges
would put over at least two touch
downs. Stanford's past record speaks
for itself, for no team this season has
been able to check the Cards' diversi
' collection of line smashes, re
| verses, spin plays, laterals, and passes.
Yet again, the score may be small
I and close as it has been during the
past four years. In the last four games
that the two teams have clashed, both
j outfits have featured with strong de
fensive play, and the only scoring has
been due to the direct results of fum
bles and breaks. With each team
; keyed up to a high pitch, a similar
fate may decide the issue this week
! end.
