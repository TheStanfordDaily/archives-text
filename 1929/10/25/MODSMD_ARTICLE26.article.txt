Erudite investigators from the Carnegie Foundation have uncovered
the startling fact that certain colleges and universities in this country and
in Canada (including Stanford) are subsidizing their stalwart athletes.
Tsk! Tsk! Imagine that!
Along with the latest information concerning Theatre Magnate Pan
tages and Spiritual Tycoon McPherson, this collegiate scandal was
pounced upon by metropolitan journalism and played up as red-hot news
â€”which, of course, it was.
While the Daily appreciates the news value of the Carnegie commit
tee's report, it cannot wax serious concerning the report's real importance.
The whole business is too obvious and too well known to be startling.
Stanford is accused of nothing more serious than allowing alumni to
render financial aid to economically hampered athletes. The Daily admits
the truth of that charge as freely as it admits that two and two make four.
Isut the Daily fails to see where that fact brings disrepute upon the uni
versity. Obviously the officials of this institution have no control over the
purse strings of opulent graduates.
Further, the Daily believes that the charges are fully answered in the
statement published yesterday morning from Acting President Swain.
When Dr. Swain declared that Stanford athletes are accorded no special
privileges in securing admission and in staying registered he spoke the
truth. There have been too many potential high school stars turned away
from the gates of this University and too many athletes dropped from the
rolls because of scholastic deficiencies, to doubt Dr. Swain's statement.
And so the Daily believes that those industrious investigators of the
Carnegie Foundation have stirred up a tempest in a tea pot as far as
Stanford is concerned.
