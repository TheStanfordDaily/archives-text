Announcement that the Cellar, completely rebuilt and redecorated, will
be opened today is a welcome one to the student body. Expense has not
been spared to make it a modern, attractive lunch room, the need for
which has long existed on the campus.
There remains but one more qualification to make it an ideal college
eating place. It should be inexpensive. Students do not care to sacrifice
quality for price, but they are interested in getting the highest quality
for the price they pay. Several Palo Alto establishments maintain a satis
factory quality at fair prices, and they do not operate at a loss.
The Cellar is located in the Union as a service to students. If that
service is to be rendered at an extra premium, as the management has
announced, then students will not want it.
A fundamental economic law is that under conditions of free compe
tition an increase in prices will result in a decreased consumption. There
is a median at which the greatest number of persons will buy at the great
est profit for the entrepreneur. Although the Cellar enjoys a virtual
monopoly on the campus, it will have to consider the competition of Palo
Alto merchants who have found the favorable price.
