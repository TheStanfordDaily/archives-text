# THE 						PRESIDENT AS A PHILOSOPHER AND WIT
## 
### 
President Hoover never has shown himself adept at uttering the
platitudes of politics so sincerely as to cause them to ring true. Through
out the 1928 campaign, and, indeed, even since, one has failed to feel that
he was getting closer to Mr. Hoover's intimate thoughts when he heard
or read his speeches. These have generally been dry and ponderous,
lacking the geniality and underlying humor which certainly are part of
the President's makeup.
But proof has come at last that the nation has at its head not only a
great organizer and humanitarian, but also a philosopher and something
of a wit. Mr. Hoover's philosophy is the broadly humane, "large-scale"
(if we may term it such) sort of philosophy which industrial wizards of
our times seem to favor, and his wit is dry and subdued. Nevertheless,
both were refreshingly exposed in his capital speech delivered at Dearborn
Monday night in honor of Thomas A. Edison.
Here, for example, is a specimen of Industrial Philosophy:
Research both in pure science and in its application to the arts
is one of the most potent impulses to progress. For it is organized
research that gives daily improvement in machines and processes,
in methods of agriculture, in the protection of health, and in under
standing. From these we gain constantly in better standards of
living, more stability of employment, lessened toil, lengthened
human life, and decreased suffering. In the end our leisure ex
pands, our interest in life enlarges, our vision stretches. There is
more joy in life.
. . Since his [Robert Malthus'] day, we have seen the paradox of
the growth of population far beyond anything of which he ever dreamed,
coupled at the same time with constantly increasing standards o£ living
and ever-increasing surplus of food. Malthus was right, except for z
new contestant in the race with his principle: that was more scientific
research, more discovery. And that race is still on. If we would have
our country improve its standards of living and at the same time accom
modate itself to increasing population, we must maintain on an even more
liberal scale than ever before our great laboratories of both pure and
applied science."
Our happiest discovery in the President's remarks was, however, of
a keen and subtle wit. He praised the electric light for making reading in
bed infinitely more comfortable and for enabling us to read the type in
the telephone book! We should have thought to find such a sally as this
in the columns of Life. What is now left for the paragraphers?
Pray read the President's humorous summary of the march of the
Mazda:
% It enables us to postpone our spectacles for a few years longer;
it has made reading in bed infinitely more comfortable; by merely
pushing a button wc have introduced the element of surprise in
dealing with burglars; the goblins that lived in dark corners and
under the bed have now been driven to the outdoors; evil deeds
which inhabit the dark have been driven back into the farthest re
treats of the night; it enables the doctor to peer into the recesses
of our insides; it substitutes for the hot-water bottle in aches and
pains; it enables our cities and towns to clothe themselves in gaiety
by night, 110 matter how sad their appearance may be by day,.and
by all its multiple uses it has lengthened the hours of our active
lives, decreased our fears, replaced the dark with good cheer, in
creased our safety, decreased our toil, and enabled us to read the
type in the telephone book. It has become the friend of man and
child.
We thought we detected a twinkle in Mr. Hoover's eye when 011 that
hot August, 1928, day in the Stadium he spoke of "an experiment noble
in motive."

our times seem to favor, and his wit is dry and subdued. Nevertheless,
both were refreshingly exposed in his capital speech delivered at Dearborn
Monday night in honor of Thomas A. Edison.
Here, for example, is a specimen of Industrial Philosophy:
Research both in pure science and in its application to the arts
is one of the most potent impulses to progress. For it is organized
research that gives daily improvement in machines and processes,
in methods of agriculture, in the protection of health, and in under
standing. From these we gain constantly in better standards of
living, more stability of employment, lessened toil, lengthened
human life, and decreased suffering. In the end our leisure ex
pands, our interest in life enlarges, our vision stretches. There is
more joy in life.
. . Since his [Robert Malthus'] day, we have seen the paradox of
the growth of population far beyond anything of which he ever dreamed,
coupled at the same time with constantly increasing standards o£ living
and ever-increasing surplus of food. Malthus was right, except for z
new contestant in the race with his principle: that was more scientific
research, more discovery. And that race is still on. If we would have
our country improve its standards of living and at the same time accom
modate itself to increasing population, we must maintain on an even more
liberal scale than ever before our great laboratories of both pure and
applied science."
Our happiest discovery in the President's remarks was, however, of
a keen and subtle wit. He praised the electric light for making reading in
bed infinitely more comfortable and for enabling us to read the type in
the telephone book! We should have thought to find such a sally as this
in the columns of Life. What is now left for the paragraphers?
Pray read the President's humorous summary of the march of the
Mazda:
% It enables us to postpone our spectacles for a few years longer;
it has made reading in bed infinitely more comfortable; by merely
pushing a button wc have introduced the element of surprise in
dealing with burglars; the goblins that lived in dark corners and
under the bed have now been driven to the outdoors; evil deeds
which inhabit the dark have been driven back into the farthest re
treats of the night; it enables the doctor to peer into the recesses
of our insides; it substitutes for the hot-water bottle in aches and
pains; it enables our cities and towns to clothe themselves in gaiety
by night, 110 matter how sad their appearance may be by day,.and
by all its multiple uses it has lengthened the hours of our active
lives, decreased our fears, replaced the dark with good cheer, in
creased our safety, decreased our toil, and enabled us to read the
type in the telephone book. It has become the friend of man and
child.
We thought we detected a twinkle in Mr. Hoover's eye when 011 that
hot August, 1928, day in the Stadium he spoke of "an experiment noble
in motive."
President Hoover never has shown himself adept at uttering the
platitudes of politics so sincerely as to cause them to ring true. Through
out the 1928 campaign, and, indeed, even since, one has failed to feel that
he was getting closer to Mr. Hoover's intimate thoughts when he heard
or read his speeches. These have generally been dry and ponderous,
lacking the geniality and underlying humor which certainly are part of
the President's makeup.
But proof has come at last that the nation has at its head not only a
great organizer and humanitarian, but also a philosopher and something
of a wit. Mr. Hoover's philosophy is the broadly humane, "large-scale"
(if we may term it such) sort of philosophy which industrial wizards of
our times seem to favor, and his wit is dry and subdued. Nevertheless,
