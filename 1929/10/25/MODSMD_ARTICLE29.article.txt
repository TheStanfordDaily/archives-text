BIRD IN HAND, written and di
rected by John Drinkwater. At the
Geary Theater.
There seemed to be a difference of
opinion at the Geary Theater Wednesday
night as to whether John Drinkwater
was back stage supervising the production
of his play "Bird in Hand" or whether he
was 6000 miles away in London. Out of
kindness to Mr. Drinkwater, we will
say that he is in London.
We went up to the Geary with great
hopes, inspired by the name of Drink
water. After the first act we were po
litely unbelieving; after the second, we
were incredulous that this could be a
Drinkwater production. And when the
final curtain reached the floor we were
completely disillusioned. "Bird in Hand"
is not a strong play, and the present in
terpretation of it is stupid and clumsy.
The theme of the play is the revolt of
this generation in England against the
righteous and opinionated mid-Victorians.
All very well. But Drinkwater's develop
ment is in the person of a thoroughly dis
agreeable father who refuses to believe
anything but the worst of his perfectly
normal and virtuous daughter when the
latter and her lover are caught and de
layed in a bad storm. And Father Green
leaf has no hesitation in telling the couple
what he thinks.
Every one of the male characters is
grossly overdone; the exaggeration is
uniform, not spotty. Denis Mantell plays
the part of a youthful and effeminate rich
man's son; his youth and effeminacy are
emphasized till it hurts. Eliot Makeham,
given a part potentially comic as a cock
ney peddler, overdoes the characteriza
tion. Douglas Jefferies as the pacifier of
the family disagreement is at one time
glaring in his exaggeration and at an
other fairly good. The overemphasis in
these characterizations is made because
the actors put on a particular bit of
horseplay at which the audience roars,
and then repeat over and over again that
same bit—at which the audience duti
fully laughs again (we don't know why).
Repetition of this sort inevitably weak
ens a play.

Percy Rhodes as the father who causes
all the stir is not so much exaggerated
as he is just plain unconvincing. You
don't believe him when he tells you his
grandmother was disgraced; and his ar
guments, which might at times be logical,
sound weak coming from him.
Freda Bruce Lockhart and Olga Slade
as the mother and daughter of the Green
leaf family complete the cast. They arc
good themselves, but are far from strong
enough to carry the play.
And finally, "Bird in Hand" has an
awful time ending; it doesn't know when
to quit. After the main action is com
pleted one thing after another occurs to
postpone the lowering of the curtain. Ev
ery character has to make a separate
exit and then come back for some more
comedy. And then the usual clinch.
John Drinkwater probably organized
this company in England, then left it to
its own devices. Our guess is that who
ever is now in charge revised it for the
benefit of American audiences. Too bad.

this generation in England against the
righteous and opinionated mid-Victorians.
All very well. But Drinkwater's develop
ment is in the person of a thoroughly dis
agreeable father who refuses to believe
anything but the worst of his perfectly
normal and virtuous daughter when the
latter and her lover are caught and de
layed in a bad storm. And Father Green
leaf has no hesitation in telling the couple
what he thinks.
Every one of the male characters is
grossly overdone; the exaggeration is
uniform, not spotty. Denis Mantell plays
the part of a youthful and effeminate rich
man's son; his youth and effeminacy are
emphasized till it hurts. Eliot Makeham,
given a part potentially comic as a cock
ney peddler, overdoes the characteriza
tion. Douglas Jefferies as the pacifier of
the family disagreement is at one time
glaring in his exaggeration and at an
other fairly good. The overemphasis in
these characterizations is made because
the actors put on a particular bit of
horseplay at which the audience roars,
and then repeat over and over again that
same bit—at which the audience duti
fully laughs again (we don't know why).
Repetition of this sort inevitably weak
ens a play.

Percy Rhodes as the father who causes
all the stir is not so much exaggerated
as he is just plain unconvincing. You
don't believe him when he tells you his
grandmother was disgraced; and his ar
guments, which might at times be logical,
sound weak coming from him.
Freda Bruce Lockhart and Olga Slade
as the mother and daughter of the Green
leaf family complete the cast. They arc
good themselves, but are far from strong
enough to carry the play.
And finally, "Bird in Hand" has an
awful time ending; it doesn't know when
to quit. After the main action is com
pleted one thing after another occurs to
postpone the lowering of the curtain. Ev
ery character has to make a separate
exit and then come back for some more
comedy. And then the usual clinch.
John Drinkwater probably organized
this company in England, then left it to
its own devices. Our guess is that who
ever is now in charge revised it for the
benefit of American audiences. Too bad.

BIRD IN HAND, written and di
rected by John Drinkwater. At the
Geary Theater.
There seemed to be a difference of
opinion at the Geary Theater Wednesday
night as to whether John Drinkwater
was back stage supervising the production
of his play "Bird in Hand" or whether he
was 6000 miles away in London. Out of
kindness to Mr. Drinkwater, we will
say that he is in London.
We went up to the Geary with great
hopes, inspired by the name of Drink
water. After the first act we were po
litely unbelieving; after the second, we
were incredulous that this could be a
Drinkwater production. And when the
final curtain reached the floor we were
completely disillusioned. "Bird in Hand"
is not a strong play, and the present in
terpretation of it is stupid and clumsy.
The theme of the play is the revolt of
this generation in England against the
righteous and opinionated mid-Victorians.
