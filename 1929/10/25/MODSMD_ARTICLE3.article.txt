# POP PREDICTS TROJAN GAME WILL BE 20-7
## U.S.C. Team Most Powerful In Years, Says Warner At Card Rally 
### 
"I believe the score of Saturday's
game will be about 20-7, but who will
have the twenty I am not prepared
to say."
In that terse sentence, Pop Warner
summed up his views on the coming
battle of the giants.
Twenty-eight hundred howling stu
dents jammed the Pavilion last night
to hear the Old Fox and Captain Mush
Muller tell of the Cardinal' 3 chances.
"Man for man, I do not believe that
this year's Stanford varsity is so
strong as the 1928 eleven," said War
ner, "while the Trojans have the most
powerful team in years. But the spirit
of this Stanford squad is much better
than that displayed by last year's
team. In 1928, I witnessed each game
with the feeling that the next Satur
day would see the boys clicking as
they should, but they didn't show
their real ability until the Army game.
But this season the team has per
formed consistently better than I ex
pected, and I can only hope this per
formance will not crack."
Captain Muller pleaded hard for a
support from the students, that he
felt had been missing in past years.
"The players really need your sup
port," said the Card captain. "The
rooters themselves have no concep
tion how much that cheering means
to us."
Scott Webster, in charge of the
rally, announced that A1 Cass and
Berk Anthony had each submitted the
winning idea for the best U.S.C. stunt.
