tion to the screen before her glamor
ous career ended in death.

scenes, and players, but will prove a
disappointment to those who saw the
legitimate presentation.
Miss Eagels dominates every scene.
Her performance is one of compelling
charm and breathless vitality.
The insanely suspicious husband is
well portrayed by Frederic March, but
the make-up man in this opus put a
little too much Cupid's Bow on his
lips. March will be remembered as
Tony Cavendish in the stage play,
"The Royal Family."
