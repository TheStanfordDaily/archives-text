## DAMS MUST BE STRONG ALSO 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The following may be of interest to
your readers:
"Professor C. F. Toltnan smashed the
highest and biggest dam in the world."
In May, 1924, the Los Angeles County
Flood Control District voted bonds for
the construction of San Gabriel Dam—
the biggest and highest dam so far to be
constructed in the world. This dam
would have a height of 432.5 feet above
strcambed and about 500 feet above as
sumed foundation. The main object of
this dam, the estimated cost of which is
$25,000,000, is the control of the floods
in the San Gabriel River and the con
servation of as much as possible of the
runoff of the San Gabriel watershed.
In March, 1929, the excavation for the
foundation was started. In September,
1929, about 650,000 cubic yards had been
removed from the abutments alone as
compared with 675,000 cubic yards which
was the estimated contract quantity for
the entire excavation.
The conditions at the time were so

radically different from those indicated
by the geological report made for the
Flood Control District prior to the au
thorization of the work by a very com
petent and well-known geologist, that the
Flood Control District invited Professor
Tolman to investigate and to report upon
the disclosed conditions. These are some
extracts of the summary and conclusions
of his report:
"The great depth and the weakness of
the rock upon which the dam must be
founded."
"The failure of this dam would prob
ably be sudden and the consequent loss of
life and property enormous."
"A safe dam of the proposed height
cannot be built at this site."
During his explanation about the San
Gabriel dam, Professor Tolman said:
"The main trouble is here, as usual, that
engineers try to achieve the highest,
longest, and biggest dams in the world,
which interferes with the consideration
of another element of a design."
