# THE GOOD OLD TIMES ARE GONE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Thursday's "good-will" assembly
proved pretty well that the old rah
rah spirit is dying out. According to
a letter in this column yesterday there
are others who think likewise. May I
ask of just what use was the assem
bly?
We were entertained by an orches
tra which most of us would rather
have heard on a dance floor. We gave
a few weak yells properly belonging
to the rally last night. The yell-leader
did his best, goodness knows, but
what is one effort to 3500, more or
less! A skit followed which was the
one commendable feature of the en
tire hour. Why not leave that for the
rally too?
The most unfortunate part of all
was the fact that two student body
presidents had to waste their time
and money for the sake of promoting
something already present. Both men
were selectel by their fellow-students
to maintain a dignified and responsi
ble position in the government of
their respective schools. The good

will or 111-will of the two colleges can
not be moved one way or the other by
the mere appearance of these repre
sentatives. If U.S.C. men feel like
burning down the Stanford campus,
they will anyway; if Stanford's root
ing section is inclined to boo the um
pire, or opposing team, it will too. But
they won't feel like it, and that will
not be because their respective am
bassadors got up and, in the spirit of
the affair, attempted to be as humor
ous as the yell-leader, a role for which
they were obviously never intended.
The sporting spirit will be foremost
because a generation of fun-loving,
reasoning, sensible men and women
are out for the thrill of the contest
and not to see who can pull the fast
est schoolboy pranks.
The "good-will" assembly was a
farce —a high-school farce, and every
one there realized it. Let's hope the
Cal-Stanford fray won't evoke a simi
lar display of false sentiment. Let's
have more rallies like last night's and
put all we have into them.
