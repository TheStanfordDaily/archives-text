The "Plug Ugly" poster appeared on
the morning of October 25, 1904. Its
principal feature was a large red plug
in the center around which were the
"usual joshes." The posters announced
a raise of admission price from 15
cents to 25 cents for the show. The
raise, it was explained, was due to the
large expense incurred in connection
with the production.
The increaae in price seemed to
cause a deluge of criticism. An edi
torial in the Daily was especially bit
ter: "We cannot accept the excuse
given by the Plug Ugly committee as
a sufficient reason for the increase in
the price of admission to the entertain
ment at which the Juniors will dedi
cate their plugs. The Plug Ugly was
not originated as a money-making
institution. It has long been given as
a rough-house show on the football
oval and we want it continued as
such."
Announcement was made that the

Junior women's hats were ready for
distribution at $2.50 each, including
the leather band.
It was a custom, in those days, for
Junior women to wear distinctive hats
just as it was for the Junior men to
wear plugs. The Junior women ap
peared en masse with the new hats on
the evening of the Plug Ugly.
The first provisional list of candi

Polilical Science and Biology, two un
knowns in 1904, had 18 each. Candi
dates in Physics liavo only increased
