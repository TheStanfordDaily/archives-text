# BRANNER GRID DANCE "PRE-GAME KICKOFF" DECLARES PRESIDENT
## 
### 
As a fitting prelude to the baltle of the
giants in the Stanford Stadium tomor
row, Branner tonight will be the scene of
the fall Gridiron Informal, with all the
attendant football atmosphere.
Whistles to start each dance, the time
keeper's gun to announce the end of the
half, punch served from water buckets—
all beneath decorations of Cardinal and
Scarlet and Gold —will serve to empha
size the gridiron spirit.
Programs of football-like appearance
are being distributed to bid-holders to
day in Room 305 Branner. A few bids
remain unsold and may be obtained in
Room 305 or from Art Angel, dance
chairman.
Dance programs for tonight will be
distributed to ticket-holders today from
8:00 to 4:30 in room 305 Branner. No
more bids are available.
