# WRESTLING CLASS HAS GOOD BEGINNING UNDER NICHOLSON'S DIRECTION
## 
### 
I With eighteen men enrolled in the
! wrestling class meeting five days a week
under the direction of R. L. Nicholson,
grappling seems to have come to stay
!as a Stanford sport. At present all divi
j sions but the lightest and heaviest are
; represented, for there are no bantam
| weight or heavyweight students taking
the course.
Dr. R. R. Long states that a novice
wrestling tournament will probably be
i held this quarter, presumably about the
| same time as the novice boxing tourna
i ment, and that all students registered in
j the University will be eligible to com
pete.
