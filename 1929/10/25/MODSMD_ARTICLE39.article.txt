## MAN FOR MAN 
### 
When a couple of ebonies get down
on their knees and roll one of those
things, they call it a natural. All of
which reminds a goodly proportion
of the world's population of tomor
row's game between the Cards and
their boy friends from the Southland.
In pigskin circles they just plain
call it a toss-up!
From every possible angle have the
sporta critics, alumni Hubsidizers, and
amateur scalpers of the coveted paste
boards studied the situation in ques
tion. They have delved deeply into
stacks of statistics, they have put the
opposing coaches through thorough
examinations, and they have closely
compared the respective rosters.
Yet, the result in each case has
been identical. After endless hec
tic hours of tiresome toiling, rag
ing and roaring, and pulling hand
fuls of hair out by the roots, they
merely apply a match to a fag
and with nonchalance bleary
eyed articulate "A toss-up!"
One of the most ancient and re
spected ways of judging how two
teams stack up against each other is
by comparing them man for man. This
method is, without doubt, easy and
.somewhat accurate, when used to
figure how a prize fight will termi
nate. The critics can usually pick
who is going to thump who on the
proboscis, and which pug will play
the part of an astronomer watching a
fallen star.
Comparing two teams, however,
is worse than judging twenty-two
steers at a stock show. It is too
easy for the all-wise critic to get
caught on the wrong side of the
fence, and thus lose his reputa
tion as well as his pants.
Attempting to judge the Thunder
ing Herd with the Farm behemoths
is no exception to this gentle rule.
Mr. Critic is more than likely to find
himself in the position of a toreador
waving a Cardinal banner in the
faces of eleven odd charging bulls.
In the first place, it is quite
difficult to compare the Stanford
players with the Trojan lads be
cause of the fact that the Warner
men's system of play differs so
greatly from that of U.S.C. Take
the quarterback position, for ex
ample. Now just how is one to
compare Chuck Smalling with
Saunders or Duffield?
Mr. Smalling has certain well-de
fined duties to perform. So have
Messrs. Saunders and Duffield. But,
my, how those duties vary! One might
as well try and judge an elephant and
a couple of jackrabbits. Each is an
outstanding player in his own line,
but who is so omnipotent as to be
able to say which of these lines is
the best?
Then, too, psychological factors
play too big a part. Certain men will
probably play away over their heads
tomorrow afternoon. At the same
time, others will fall into a slump of
some kind. Such things always hap
pen in "big" games. Mere potentiali
ties won't win or lose the game. It's
the actual playing of the men that
counts.
Take the rest of the starting back
fiolds. Simkins, Frentrup, and Rothert
are scheduled to trot down under the
opening kickoff for the Cardinals. Op
posing them will be Edelson, Pinck
ert, and Musick.
Now all Mr. Edelson does is run
interference, which he does to
perfection. But how does he stack
up with the three Redshirts, all
of whom are plenty potent in
packing the elusive pigskin? Roth
ert can outpunt the Trojans, and
Simkins can outpass them. On the
other hand, the boys Pinckert and
Musick haven't been bothered
with bum knees all year.
The same can be said of the oppos
ing lines. Captain Muller is fast de
veloping itno the best pass-snagger
on the Coast, yet tlie Trojan wing
trio of Tappan, Steponovich, and
Arbellide are not so bad in this re
spect themselves. Preston is good, but
his has been hampered with a twisted
knee all season. Neill still lacks ex
perience.
The tackles are on a par. Stanford
has a weight advantage, with Artman
tipping the scales at around two hun
dred and thirty pounds. To offset this,
the southern men have displayed
more aggressiveness to date. The
guards, too, seem about equal, though
Captain Bararger of Troy has a slight
edge in experience and weight.
If the Cards can be said to have
any advantage at all, it is at center.
Walt Heinecke has shown more than
any other pivot man on the Pacific
slope so far this year. He takes espe
cial delight in bowling over big fel
lows. Thus, Mr. Heinecke should have
all kinds of fun tomorrow, as Dye, the
Trojan center, weighs all of two hun
dred and thirty-five pounds.
So one \in readily see that a
man for man comparison of the
two squads is but a rattle-brained
gesture. At least, the wise critic
can but conclude with the utter
ance: "A toss-up, man for man!"

ing Herd with the Farm behemoths
is no exception to this gentle rule.
Mr. Critic is more than likely to find
himself in the position of a toreador
waving a Cardinal banner in the
faces of eleven odd charging bulls.
In the first place, it is quite
difficult to compare the Stanford
players with the Trojan lads be
cause of the fact that the Warner
men's system of play differs so
greatly from that of U.S.C. Take
the quarterback position, for ex
ample. Now just how is one to
compare Chuck Smalling with
Saunders or Duffield?
Mr. Smalling has certain well-de
fined duties to perform. So have
Messrs. Saunders and Duffield. But,
my, how those duties vary! One might
as well try and judge an elephant and
a couple of jackrabbits. Each is an
outstanding player in his own line,
but who is so omnipotent as to be
able to say which of these lines is
the best?
Then, too, psychological factors
play too big a part. Certain men will
probably play away over their heads
tomorrow afternoon. At the same
time, others will fall into a slump of
some kind. Such things always hap
pen in "big" games. Mere potentiali
ties won't win or lose the game. It's
the actual playing of the men that
counts.
Take the rest of the starting back
fiolds. Simkins, Frentrup, and Rothert
are scheduled to trot down under the
opening kickoff for the Cardinals. Op
posing them will be Edelson, Pinck
ert, and Musick.
Now all Mr. Edelson does is run
interference, which he does to
perfection. But how does he stack
up with the three Redshirts, all
of whom are plenty potent in
packing the elusive pigskin? Roth
ert can outpunt the Trojans, and
Simkins can outpass them. On the
other hand, the boys Pinckert and
Musick haven't been bothered
with bum knees all year.
The same can be said of the oppos
ing lines. Captain Muller is fast de
veloping itno the best pass-snagger
on the Coast, yet tlie Trojan wing
trio of Tappan, Steponovich, and
Arbellide are not so bad in this re
spect themselves. Preston is good, but
his has been hampered with a twisted
knee all season. Neill still lacks ex
perience.
The tackles are on a par. Stanford
has a weight advantage, with Artman
tipping the scales at around two hun
dred and thirty pounds. To offset this,
the southern men have displayed
more aggressiveness to date. The
guards, too, seem about equal, though
Captain Bararger of Troy has a slight
edge in experience and weight.
If the Cards can be said to have
any advantage at all, it is at center.
Walt Heinecke has shown more than
any other pivot man on the Pacific
slope so far this year. He takes espe
cial delight in bowling over big fel
lows. Thus, Mr. Heinecke should have
all kinds of fun tomorrow, as Dye, the
Trojan center, weighs all of two hun
dred and thirty-five pounds.
So one \in readily see that a
man for man comparison of the
two squads is but a rattle-brained
gesture. At least, the wise critic
can but conclude with the utter
ance: "A toss-up, man for man!"
By S. Dietrich.
When a couple of ebonies get down
on their knees and roll one of those
things, they call it a natural. All of
which reminds a goodly proportion
of the world's population of tomor
row's game between the Cards and
their boy friends from the Southland.
In pigskin circles they just plain
call it a toss-up!
From every possible angle have the
sporta critics, alumni Hubsidizers, and
amateur scalpers of the coveted paste
boards studied the situation in ques
tion. They have delved deeply into
stacks of statistics, they have put the
opposing coaches through thorough
examinations, and they have closely
compared the respective rosters.
Yet, the result in each case has
been identical. After endless hec
tic hours of tiresome toiling, rag
ing and roaring, and pulling hand
fuls of hair out by the roots, they
merely apply a match to a fag
and with nonchalance bleary
eyed articulate "A toss-up!"
One of the most ancient and re
spected ways of judging how two
teams stack up against each other is
by comparing them man for man. This
method is, without doubt, easy and
.somewhat accurate, when used to
figure how a prize fight will termi
nate. The critics can usually pick
who is going to thump who on the
proboscis, and which pug will play
the part of an astronomer watching a
fallen star.
Comparing two teams, however,
is worse than judging twenty-two
steers at a stock show. It is too
easy for the all-wise critic to get
caught on the wrong side of the
fence, and thus lose his reputa
tion as well as his pants.

up with the three Redshirts, all
of whom are plenty potent in
packing the elusive pigskin? Roth
ert can outpunt the Trojans, and
Simkins can outpass them. On the
other hand, the boys Pinckert and
Musick haven't been bothered
with bum knees all year.
The same can be said of the oppos
ing lines. Captain Muller is fast de
veloping itno the best pass-snagger
on the Coast, yet tlie Trojan wing
trio of Tappan, Steponovich, and
Arbellide are not so bad in this re
spect themselves. Preston is good, but
his has been hampered with a twisted
knee all season. Neill still lacks ex
perience.
The tackles are on a par. Stanford
has a weight advantage, with Artman
tipping the scales at around two hun
dred and thirty pounds. To offset this,
the southern men have displayed
more aggressiveness to date. The
guards, too, seem about equal, though
Captain Bararger of Troy has a slight
edge in experience and weight.
If the Cards can be said to have
any advantage at all, it is at center.
Walt Heinecke has shown more than
any other pivot man on the Pacific
slope so far this year. He takes espe
cial delight in bowling over big fel
lows. Thus, Mr. Heinecke should have
all kinds of fun tomorrow, as Dye, the
Trojan center, weighs all of two hun
dred and thirty-five pounds.
So one \in readily see that a
man for man comparison of the
two squads is but a rattle-brained
gesture. At least, the wise critic
can but conclude with the utter
ance: "A toss-up, man for man!"
By S. Dietrich.
When a couple of ebonies get down
on their knees and roll one of those
things, they call it a natural. All of
which reminds a goodly proportion
of the world's population of tomor
row's game between the Cards and
their boy friends from the Southland.
In pigskin circles they just plain
call it a toss-up!
From every possible angle have the
sporta critics, alumni Hubsidizers, and
amateur scalpers of the coveted paste
boards studied the situation in ques
tion. They have delved deeply into
stacks of statistics, they have put the
opposing coaches through thorough
examinations, and they have closely
compared the respective rosters.
Yet, the result in each case has
been identical. After endless hec
tic hours of tiresome toiling, rag
ing and roaring, and pulling hand
fuls of hair out by the roots, they
merely apply a match to a fag
and with nonchalance bleary
eyed articulate "A toss-up!"
One of the most ancient and re
spected ways of judging how two
teams stack up against each other is
by comparing them man for man. This
method is, without doubt, easy and
.somewhat accurate, when used to
figure how a prize fight will termi
nate. The critics can usually pick
who is going to thump who on the
proboscis, and which pug will play
the part of an astronomer watching a
fallen star.
Comparing two teams, however,
is worse than judging twenty-two
steers at a stock show. It is too
easy for the all-wise critic to get
caught on the wrong side of the
fence, and thus lose his reputa
tion as well as his pants.
Attempting to judge the Thunder
ing Herd with the Farm behemoths
is no exception to this gentle rule.
Mr. Critic is more than likely to find
himself in the position of a toreador
waving a Cardinal banner in the
faces of eleven odd charging bulls.
In the first place, it is quite
difficult to compare the Stanford
players with the Trojan lads be
cause of the fact that the Warner
men's system of play differs so
greatly from that of U.S.C. Take
the quarterback position, for ex
ample. Now just how is one to
compare Chuck Smalling with
Saunders or Duffield?
Mr. Smalling has certain well-de
fined duties to perform. So have
Messrs. Saunders and Duffield. But,
my, how those duties vary! One might
as well try and judge an elephant and
a couple of jackrabbits. Each is an
outstanding player in his own line,
but who is so omnipotent as to be
able to say which of these lines is
the best?
Then, too, psychological factors
play too big a part. Certain men will
probably play away over their heads
tomorrow afternoon. At the same
time, others will fall into a slump of
some kind. Such things always hap
pen in "big" games. Mere potentiali
ties won't win or lose the game. It's
the actual playing of the men that
counts.
Take the rest of the starting back
fiolds. Simkins, Frentrup, and Rothert
are scheduled to trot down under the
opening kickoff for the Cardinals. Op
posing them will be Edelson, Pinck
ert, and Musick.
Now all Mr. Edelson does is run
interference, which he does to
perfection. But how does he stack
up with the three Redshirts, all
of whom are plenty potent in
packing the elusive pigskin? Roth
ert can outpunt the Trojans, and
Simkins can outpass them. On the
