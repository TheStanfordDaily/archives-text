# STOREY REFUSES TO MAKE STATEMENT ON SUBSIDY INDICTMENT
## 
### 
Refusing to be seriously alarmed at
the newspaper reports of the Carnegie
Foundation's charges that athletes at
Stanford as well as other colleges
were being subsidized, administration
officers were loathe to comment on
the charges until they had read the
full report.
"The complete report, I am sure,
will show the charges to be very mod
erate; any real-thinking people will
see that even the newspaper reports
are not so sensational as they first
appear," was the comment made by
Acting-President Robert E. Swain.
Other administrative officials were
of the opinion that when the full re
port came out Stanford would be
placed in a much more favorable light
than most of the other schools. The
report was generally considered to be
a good thing insofar as it would bring
all questionable athletic practices out
into the light for a good airing.
All questions and requests for state
ments by the press were referred to
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, director of
athletics at Stanford, who said:
"Since I have not seen a copy of
the report of the Carnegie Founda
tion, it would be extremely unwise for
me to make any statement on the
case. It is impossible for us to answer
charges until we know what those
charges are. The stand taken by Dr.
Swain in his statement published yes
terday represents the view of Masters,
myself, and others concerned here at
Stanford."
