# BRUIN FROSH INVADE FARM TOMORROW
## STANFORD FROSH READY FOR GAME WITH U.C.L.A. ELEVEN Uclans Have Powerful Squad Although Handicapped With Injuries; Cards' Offense Improved; Odds Even 
### Don Oswill 
After working all week to perfect a powerful offense, Coach "Husky" Hunt
avers that his Stanford freshman football team will be stronger tomorrow than at
any previous time this season. The Card babes meet the U.C.L.A. Bruins in the
stadium at 12: 30 o'clock in the preliminary game to that great classic, the Varsity-
Trojan encounter.
The trickincss that Pop Warner made famous in his spin plays and passing

'tactics is very evident in the game played
by Hunt's proteges, and the frosh are
capable of loosing a power attack that
will surprise some of the wise buys. The
frosh have been drilling all week on fast,
deceptive forward and lateral pass plays,
j and together with the reverses will have
; a widely varied attack.
If the improved offense of the Stan
ford freshmen can function successfully
j against a seven-man line, the Cards
; should win tomorrow. Against the Santa
! Clara seven-man defense the Cards failed
. to show much power, but one thing is
j certain, that with the Bruins using seven
j of their team in the forward wall, there
is a much better chance for Stanford
| passes to connect for gains.
Bruins Are Powerful
Coach Fred Oster has a powerful
j squad, despite the fact that it is somewhat
battered by injuries at present. The play
| ers are unusually big and tough, and on
the whole considered the best material
that ever entered U.C.L.A. The back
| field players are nearly as heavy as the
linemen, and will present more of a pow-
I er attack than a fast, running offensive.
( Bob Flaville, a 190-pound Bruin full
; back, sounds like a made to order line
I plunger, while Red Lowe, a slightly light
er halfback, is also supposed to be good
at smacking the forward wall. Hassler,
! Campbell, Sloan, and Jones are the most
i promising of the remainder of the back
field material. Norfleet, Willoughby, and
Sorenson are the pick of the Bruin line,
all heavy, and all experienced football
players.
Two of the best halfbacks on the
U.C.L.A. team are laid up with injuries.
A wrenched knee will prevent Beaver
from seeing service in the Card encoun
ter, and Decker is out of the game with
a bad shoulder. The loss of the former
at one of the halfback berths is a big
blow to the Uclans, as he was the best
punter on the squad.
Odds About Even
Both teams have lost games this sea
son, the Bruins having been defeated by
Long Beach Junior College, Bakersfield
High School, and the U.S.S. Idaho navy
eleven, while the Cards have dropped con
tests to the Santa Clara and U.S.C. fresh
men. Computing from games played the
odds should be about even, but Hunt's
men have gone up against the better
teams.
The same line-up that started against
U.S.C. last week will go up against the
Bruins tomorrow. Ends will be Hedge
and Tway, tackles La√üorde and Art
man, guards Ross and Kite, center Bates,
halves Afflerbaugh and Rogers, quarter
Boushey, and full Stevens.
Hunt's men have not functioned quite
as smoothly as they should during the
last two contests, but if they get going
tomorrow things might not go so well
for the Uclans. The Cards have plenty
of potential strength and reserve power,
and with a good offense will go far.
Ken Afflerbaugh and Wes Stevens are
expected to bear the brunt of the Stan
ford ball carrying tomorrow. Stevens is
best at smacking the line, while Affler
baugh is always a dangerous open field
runner. Axe Nyland will very probably
get a chance to play tomorrow. Nyland
is one of the best tacklers on the squad,
but has been laid up with an injured
shoulder for some time.
