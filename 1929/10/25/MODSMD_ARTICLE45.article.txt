# Freshmen To Play Third Grid Game Against Medics
## 
### 
| With a clean slate behind them in the
l interclass touch football schedule, the
j freshmen will meet the medics in their
| third game this afternoon at 3 :30 on the
i field back of the men's tennis courts.
Of the games scheduled to date there
have been two defaults, juniors to sen
iors, and sophs to frosh. These have
J been due chiefly to the inability of the
respective managers of the defaulting
j classes to appear on the field with a com
i plete team of seven members.
