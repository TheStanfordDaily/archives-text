Coach Warner: "It appears that
this year U.S.C. has the strongest
team they've ever had, and it will
take the best team Stanford has had
to beat them. It seems hard to be
lieve that the scores Stanford has
run up this year are a true indica
tion. Certainly the personnel of the
squad is not as strong as that of
last year, but the team has shown
an excellent spirit which will be
hard to beat. I expect a tough bat
tle which the breaks of the game
will decide."
Captain Muller: "I expect an up
hill battle all the way, but we intend
to fight our hardest to win. We
want as much support as possible
from the rooters â€” support which
has been missing in the past."
