# CONDITION OF HAROLD CHOPE, LANE STUDENT, IS GREATLY IMPROVED
## 
### 
The condition of Harold Chope, Stan
ford nicdical student who contracted a
lung infection several months ago that
was expected to prove fatal, is much im
proved, and indications are that in several
months he will have recovered entnely.
Chope has been confined in the Lane
Hospital several weeks, suffering from a
peculiar lung infection caused by the
spread of bacilli of the fungus coccidio.-
cica granuloma, which closely resembles
bread-mold. The seriousness of his con
dition was at first exaggerated. A re
cent examination showed that the lumps
formed in his lungs are clearing up.
Chope became infectcd while studying
the coccidiocica granuloma at the medi
cal school under Drs. William Ophuls
and Ernest Dickson.
