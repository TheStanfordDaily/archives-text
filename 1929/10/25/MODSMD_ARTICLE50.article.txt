# TOMORROW'S COAST GRIDIRON SCHEDULE
## 
### 
Although the Stanford - U.S.C.
game has monopolized nearly all
football interest on the West Coast,
two other Conference contests will
be played tomorrow afternoon. The
most important of these will be the
Oregon-Washington clash at Seat
tle. Another feature of the week
end will be the annual Cal-Olympic
game, oldest pigskin set-up in the
West.
Following are the outstanding
games to be played tomorrow on
the various Coast gridirons:
Conference
Stanford vs. U.S.C. at Palo Alto
Oregon vs. Washington at Seattle
Oregon State vs. Idaho at Portland
Non-Conference
Cal vs. Olympic Club at Berkeley
Washington State vs. Whitman at
