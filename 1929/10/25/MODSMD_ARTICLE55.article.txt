# HELVENSTON TO USE RICH LINE, COLOR IN MILNE'S 'IVORY DOOR'
## King's Courtiers Will Wear Fine Hand-Embroidered Velvets, Brocades 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
The costumes which will be used
in Milne's comedy, "The Ivory Door,"
a week from tonight, are without
doubt the finest group of costumes
that have been used in campus pro
ductions for years.
As "The Ivory Door" takes place in
a time symbolical of all time, and in a
place symbolical of everywhere, the
costumes have been chosen, by Har
old Helvenston, Acting Director of
Dramatics, to portray the typical Euro
pean court. They are extremely rich
in color, line, and material. Dagged,
scalloped sleeves, and doublet and
hose will be worn by some of the peo
ple in King Perivale's fantastic king
dom, while the nobles will wear long
straight tunics, capes, and over-tunics
of heavy velvets and brocades. The
ladies of the court will wear slight
trains and elaborate head-dresses;
and the variety of color among their
dresses and among the costumes of
the courtiers will make each act a
rich changing picture.
King Nobly Attired
Although these costumes are au
thentically correct for 13th century
England, they will be brilliantly har
monious with the sets and lines. They
were designed by Helvenston and exe
cuted under his direction by Goldstein
for a San Francisco production re
cently.
Outstanding among the group are
the costumes to be worn by King Hil
ary and by the chancellor. Hilary,
who has a short but rather magnifi
cent part in the prologue, is to be
played by Tom Henry, who will wear
a rich velvet robe of purple, lined with
a beautiful cerise. While it is the
essence of royalty and splendor, there
is nothing commonplace, nothing
vaudeville-ish about it. And were the
fine hand embroidery on the under
tunic visible from the audience, Hil
ary's costume would be even better
appreciated.
Chancellor's Tunic Beautiful
However, the costume to be worn
by Irving Rosenblatt, in the part of
the chancellor of Perivale's court, is
probably the most beautiful of all. It,
also, is of purple, but is a more deli
cate, subtle shade, and the handwork

on the tunic in thread-of-gold merits
a trip backstage after the play. A
narrow banding of fur completes the
costume.
Colorful and picturesque also, are
the costumes of the court guards and
attendants.

cuted under his direction by Goldstein
for a San Francisco production re
cently.
Outstanding among the group are
the costumes to be worn by King Hil
ary and by the chancellor. Hilary,
who has a short but rather magnifi
cent part in the prologue, is to be
played by Tom Henry, who will wear
a rich velvet robe of purple, lined with
a beautiful cerise. While it is the
essence of royalty and splendor, there
is nothing commonplace, nothing
vaudeville-ish about it. And were the
fine hand embroidery on the under
tunic visible from the audience, Hil
ary's costume would be even better
appreciated.
Chancellor's Tunic Beautiful
However, the costume to be worn
by Irving Rosenblatt, in the part of
the chancellor of Perivale's court, is
probably the most beautiful of all. It,
also, is of purple, but is a more deli
cate, subtle shade, and the handwork

on the tunic in thread-of-gold merits
a trip backstage after the play. A
narrow banding of fur completes the
costume.
Colorful and picturesque also, are
the costumes of the court guards and
attendants.
The costumes which will be used
in Milne's comedy, "The Ivory Door,"
a week from tonight, are without
doubt the finest group of costumes
that have been used in campus pro
ductions for years.
As "The Ivory Door" takes place in
a time symbolical of all time, and in a
place symbolical of everywhere, the
costumes have been chosen, by Har
old Helvenston, Acting Director of
Dramatics, to portray the typical Euro
pean court. They are extremely rich
in color, line, and material. Dagged,
scalloped sleeves, and doublet and
hose will be worn by some of the peo
ple in King Perivale's fantastic king
dom, while the nobles will wear long
straight tunics, capes, and over-tunics
of heavy velvets and brocades. The
ladies of the court will wear slight
trains and elaborate head-dresses;
and the variety of color among their
dresses and among the costumes of
the courtiers will make each act a
rich changing picture.
King Nobly Attired
Although these costumes are au
thentically correct for 13th century
England, they will be brilliantly har
monious with the sets and lines. They
were designed by Helvenston and exe
cuted under his direction by Goldstein
for a San Francisco production re
