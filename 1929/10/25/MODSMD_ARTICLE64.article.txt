# MEDICS HEAR MILES STATE SIGNIFICANCE OF COLOR BLINDNESS
## Psychology Professor Tells Results of Tests Made In Past Two Years 
### 
Discussing the relationship between
color blindness and clothing salesman
ship, Professor W. R. Miles of the
Psychology Department spoke before
the Experimental Biology and Medi
cine Association Saturday night.
Professor Miles reviewed the long
acknowledged relation between lights
used as railroad signals and color
blindness in railroad employees. Red
and green color-blindness are most,
frequent. To detect these the railroad
companies tested applicants for posi
tions by having them separate Holm
grin worsteds or yarns into piles of
different colors. On the bases of these
tests 4 or 5 men out of 100 were
found to have color defects.
New Color Test
Dr. Ishiliara, a Japanese professor,
has devised a new test for color
blindness which is so delicate that
color defects are discovered in about
twice as many cases as by the old
tests. It is made up of charts which
have backgrounds of colored dots
upon which are digits made of con
trasting colored dots. The color-blind
individual either sees no digit or else
a different one, depending on the type
of defect.
During 1927-28 Professor Miles test
ed 1256 Stanford men, finding 106 or
8.2 per cent with color defects. While
making these tests it was brought to
Professor Miles' attention that a color
blind individual might be especially
valuable in clothing concerns in which
it was necessary to match tones of
surfaces.
Test Salesmen
Working on this theory Professor
Miles and Homer Craig Jr. of Stan
ford tested 3SO salesmen in clothing
departments of several San Francisco
stores. Thirty-nine men, or 10.2 per
cent, had color defects. Contrary to
Professor Miles' expectations these
salesmen had no advantage over the
normal man. Although they could per
haps detect differences in depths of
surfaces more accurately, the failure
to recognize colors more than offset
this.
