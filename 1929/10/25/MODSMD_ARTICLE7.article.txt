### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 24. (;p)—Enoch W.
Bagsluiw began coaching the Univer
sity of Washington football team out
of kindness today. Yesterday the dy
namic little gridiron mentor resigned
as head coach of the Washington
eleven but offered his services for the
remainder of the present season.
The student board of control last
night accepted Bagsliaw's resignation
and also his offer to remain in the
position of head coach until the con
clusion of the Washington-Chicago
game November 23.
Bagshaw's contract had two more
years to run and he will be paid off
in full. He will receive approximately
$IG,OOO for the unserved term of the
contract.
Although no names have been sug
gested, it was generally understood
that Washington has considered sev
eral of the outstanding coaches of the
country. They include:
Gilmour Dobie, Cornell University;
Robert C. Zuppke, University of Illi
nois; C. W. Spears, University of Min
nesota; Knute K. Rockne, Notre
Dame; Harry Stuhldrelier, Villanova;
E. P. Madigan, St. Mary's College,
Oakland, Calif.; Dr. John W. Wilce,
Ohio State University; T. A. D. Jones,
Yale University; and J. B. Hawley,
Dartmouth.
SEATTLE, Oct. 24. (IP)—One of
their last opportunities to do a good
turn for their coach, the University
of Washington football players have
pledged themselves to "battle our
heads off" in the gridiron game against
the University of Oregon here Satur
day.
During practice yesterday Coach
Enoch W. Bagshaw informed his men
that he had resigned but that he had
offered his services for the remainder
of the season. And when work was
over for the day the players swooped
down on their coach, hoisted him on
their shoulders, and yelled "We're for
you, Baggy, for you to a man."
