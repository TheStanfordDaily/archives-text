Seniors who have not had their
Quad pictures taken should make ap
pointments this morning at the law

Thin women should wear light, he
suggests, and stout persons, dark. The
colors photographing dark are reds

worn. Short beads or chokers go with
narrower faces, and all jewelry flat
ters, he adds, if used properly. A con
trast in dark and light between the
collar and the dress usually lends a
"snappy atmosphere."
