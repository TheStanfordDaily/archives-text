# EXPEDITION INTO ARCTIC PLANNED BY GERMAN ZEP
## Famed Round-the-World Ship May Leave in April; Plans Made for Scientific Study Will Cruise from Norway to Alaska; Then Over Bering Sea, Siberia, and Germany 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 27. (/p)—Dr. Wal
ter Bleisteln, secretary and treasurer
of the Aeroarctic Society who arrived
from Europe today, said he was going
to Washington to discuss final ar
rangements for an Arctic exploration
expedition in the drigible Graf Zep
pelin. He will consult with John Flem
ing, vice-president of the American
branch of the society.
The voyage will be undertaken next
April by a group of 12 scientists,
headed by Fritjof Hansen.
Mast Being Built
The plan, as outlined by Dr. Bleis
tein, Is for the Graf Zeppelin to go
from Friedrichshafen, Germany, to
Tromsoe, in Norway, where a moor
ing mast has been erected. From
Tromsoe the air iinor is to cruise to
Fairbanks, Alaska, where a mast now
is being erected, and from there over
the Bering Sea and Siberia and back
to Friedrichshafen.
The principal objects of the pro
jected expedition will be to mark the
boundaries between the deep and shal
low parts of the Arctic waters, to
study meterological conditions, and to
prepare for the establishment of
scientific stations in the ice fields.
New Commander
In addition to the party of scien
tists, the Graf will carry a crew of 32
men and 23 polar dogs. Captain Ernst
Lehmann, who commanded the last
flight of the Graf from Lakehurst, N.J.,
to its home hangar at Frierichshafen,
will be in command of the dirigible on
its Arctic voyage, Dr. Bleistein said.
