# TRANSFER STUDENTS TO CONFORM MORE TO 'NATIVE' RULINGS
## 
### 
Scholastic requirements, as regards
probation and disqualification for
transfer students entering with Upper
Division standing, have been brought
closer to those governing "native"
Stanford students by a recent ruling
of the Committee on Scholarship.
While the requirements for the first
quarter are practically identical for
both groups, the transfer must con
form to a more rapid rate of improve
ment, so that in his sixth quarter at
Stanford, presumably his quarter of
graduation, he is held to the same re
quirements as a "native" student in
his twelfth quarter.
The new regulations do not affect
transfers who matriculated prior to
the current quarter or transfers with
Lower Division standing; and stu
dents entering with more than 90
units of advanced credit are in the
same position as to scholarship re
quirements as those with 90 units.
Transfers desiring further infor
mation about the new regulations
may consult Mrs. Huston, Secretary
of the Committee on Scholarship, in
the Registrar's office.
