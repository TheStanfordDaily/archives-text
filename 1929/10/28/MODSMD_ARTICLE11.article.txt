# "Old Boy" Wants All Copy For Big Game Issue Today
## 
### 
"Today is the deadline for all art
and literary copy for my Big Game
Number," cackled the Old Boy as he
carefully poured ice water over his
venerable head, "and anyone who has
been through what I have during the
week-end ought to have all kinds of
inspirations for football humor."
From the way the Ancient Wheezer
chortled up his sleeve, it seems that
he is concealing something until the
next Chaparral comes off the press.
But he has a cover in which he takes
great pride and promises the public a
blurb about it in the near future.
