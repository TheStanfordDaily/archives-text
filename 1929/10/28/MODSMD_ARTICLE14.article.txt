# PLANS FOR WOMEN'S GYM INCLUDE SPECIAL RECREATIONAL ROOMS
## 
### 
A lounging room which will be open
at all times as a place to read, study,
or rest is one of the special features
planned for the Stanford women's
gymnasium, the cornerstone of which
will be laid at the end of this quar
ter. A kitchenette adjoining the loung
ing room, and two swimming pools,
one for recreation and one for class
work, are also included in the archi
tects' plans.
In addition to the recreational fea
tures of the new gym, there will be
rooms for clinical and for department
al office work and a meeting room for
the W.A.A. board. Dressing rooms and
showers wlil be well-equipped, and
there will be a large gymnasium floor.
The University architects, Bakewell
and Brown, of San Francisco, are now
at work with members of the A.W.S.
gym committee, Dr. Dyment, and Miss
Bunting, revising and suiting the plans
to the needs of Stanford women. The
plans will probably not be completed
until the latter part of the quarter,
when building can be started, declares
Miss Bunting.
