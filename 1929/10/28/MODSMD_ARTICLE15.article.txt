"Scientific governmental politics
' have come to be recognized as one of
the most vital factors in the adminis
tration of a state," said Professor Ed
win A. Cottrell today.
"This applied science of politics is
best exemplified by the use President
Hoover made of maps and charts of
the voting strengths of the various
counties and states during the cam
paign of 1928. From these charts the
Republican campaign managers were
i able to figure just where extra forces
| were needed to swing the Republican
vote.
Work for Perfect State
"The ideal toward which this sci
entific study is reaching is of course
| the perfect state," Cottrell declared,
j "And in the end Ibis will be attained.
| Right now this research is being used
j mainly for investigation into the best
I means of saving the citizen's money,
j The new paper money is one of the
; results of such an investigation.
"For the past ten years one of the
| government's efficiency bureaus has
I been searching for a certain size of
[ paper money with a composition that
[ would have better wearing qualities
! than the former paper money. As a
result the government will save sev
! eral millions a year on the paper
alone. This is one of the vast number
j of things that is being done in the
field of political research. In 1912 all
the different research bureaus united
| in one body and today the results of
| studies taken up by one organization
are available to all the members of

the national body."
In 1920 Ogden Mills, prominent Re
publican, conceived the idea of an in
vestigation into political conditions
in New York City, the location of
voting places, the use of voting ma
chines, where the party strength lay,
etc. As a result the Republican ma
chine in New York City knew exactly
where to concentrate its forces in the
1920 election. That was the first in
vestigation by a political party.
"During President Hoover's cam
paign, Hugo Wahl, a graduate of the
Stanford Political Science Depart
ment, compiled this series of maps
and monographs previously men
tioned. These maps were used by the
Republican party, from which maps
they were able to figure the trends
from Democratic to Republican votes
and vice versa. They could thus plan
on where to concentrate forces in the
contest for votes."
Forecast Failed
"But these forecasts of 'trends' are
not always as accurate as expected.
Professor Robinson, of the Citizenship
Department, by a study of the maps
of former elections he has in his of
fice, figured that A 1 Smith was due
to win by about the same majority
that Hoover obtained. The trouble in
this case was the unusual issues that
came up in the election.
"The ultimate good that will come
of this scientific study will not mani
fest itself in success of political par
ties but rather in the more success
ful administration of governing bod
ies," ended Professor Cottrell.
