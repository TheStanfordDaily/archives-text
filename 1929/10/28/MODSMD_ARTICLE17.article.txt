# CARD BABES DEFEAT U.C.L.A. FROSH 19-0; AFLLERBAUGH STARS
## 
### 
Displaying more power on the of
fense than they have shown at any
time this season, Coach "Husky"
Hunt's Stanford freshman football
team easily defeated the U.C.L.A.
yearlings here Saturday by a score
of 19 to 0. The game was a prelimi
nary to the Varsity-Trojan contest.
Ken Afflerbaugh, flashy Cardinal
halfback, made the first score a few
moments after the opening whistle,
on a fifteen-yard dash around left end.
The second Stanford tally also re
sulted principally from the work of
Afflerbaugh. He carried the pigskin
from midfield to the Uclans' five-yards
line on a series of end runs. Stevens
plunged through the line for the re
maining distance.
In the third quarter the Stanford
freshmen twice worked down the field
to within scoring distance, but lacked
the final punch to put over a touch
down. The kicking of Afflerbaugh,
however, gave the edge to the baby
Redshirts, and the beginning of the
final period found them again within
scoring distance.
Palmer made some very effective
end runs and Hancock alternated with
some husky line plnnges to carry the
ball to the Bruin two-yard mark. At
this point, Howe, a sub halfback, was
sent into the game, and he hit the
line for the final score. Corbus failed
to convert.
Afflerbaugh, Palmer, and Stevens
were the outstanding performers in
the Stanford backfield, while Artman
did fine work in the line. The only
man on the U.C.L.A. squad to show
anything was Hassler, quarterback.
He made a few substantial gains, but
for the most part was held as help
less as the rest by the Card defense.
