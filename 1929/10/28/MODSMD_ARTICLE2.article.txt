# HOPKINS MARINE HEAD RETURNS TO STATION AFTER STUDY IN EAST
## 
### 
Dr. Walter K. Fisher, director of
the Hopkins Marine Station and Pro
fessor of Zoology, returned to the sta
tion last week from the East. Dr.
Fisher accompanied Gifford Pinchot,
recently returned from the South Seas
and long identified with forestry con
servation among the South Sea Islands
for the National Museum at Washing
ton, on Pinchot's yacht.
Fisher accompanied Pinchot in order
to make a collection of various forms
of marine life. Unfortunately, the
yacht was delayed in Panama because
of engine trouble, and the tropic con
ditions affected Fisher's health, forc
ing him to leave the expedition and
return to Washington. He spent some
weeks there recuperating and study
ing at the Smithsonian Institute. Then
lie went on to New York and finally
returned to the Coast. He spent a few
days on the campus last week on the
way to the marine station.
