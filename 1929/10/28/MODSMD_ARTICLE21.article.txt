# S.F. SYMPHONY OPENS ITS 1929-30 SEASON; GETS MUCH APPLAUSE
## 
### 
Receiving a more than usually ap
preciative reception, the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra opened its
1929-30 season with a concert Friday
afternoon at the Woodland Theatre
and repeated the same program Sun
day afternoon. At the conclusion of
the concert yesterday, the audience
gave Alfred Hertz, conductor, and bis
musicians fully five minutes of en
thusiastic applause.
The most popular number, and one
which forced Mr. Hertz to take many
bows, was Glaxounow's Fourth Sym
phony. The orchestra's treatment of
the Oriental theme was effective, and
the whole rendition was quite dra
matic, with the deep tones of the
violas and bassoons particularly no
ticeable.
First on the program was Joliann
Christian Bach's "Sinfonie," whose
lovely pianissimo and pizzicato pas
sages for the strings made an excel
lent opening number. The orchestra
fairly surpassed itself in the third and
last part of the program, the tone
poem, Zarathustra, by Richard Strauss.
Throughout the concert, the orches
tra showed the exact precision and
perfect tone which Alfred Hertz's
training has given them.
