# Few Make Use Of Daily's Special Delivery Service
## 
### 
Special delivery complaint service
of the Stanford Daily has not been
completely utilized, according to Hal
Terwilliger, business manager, and
unless more complaints are turned in
between 7:30 and 8 o'clock in the
morning, the service will be discon
tinued at the end of the week.
"All Dailies are delivered by 7:30 in
the morning," says Terwilliger, "and
there should be plenty of time to
phone the complaint to 4717 by 8
o'clock rather than to turn it in later
in the day." The special delivery serv
ice is given only to people who turn
in complaints before that time.
