# TROJANS ELIMINATE STANFORD IN MARCH TOWARD MYTHICAL FOOTBALL TITLE OF COUNTRY
## Cards Fail Twice on Splendid Chances to Score in First Quarter—Duffield-Tappaan Pass Brings Lone Trojan Score—Fine Interference Marks S.C. Play 
### DON OSWILL 
A REAL Thundering Herd, a galloping, unstoppable football team from
U.S.C., broke through a stubborn Stanford eleven here Saturday for a
single touchdown, and with that seven points very probably goes the cham
pionship of the Pacific Coast as well as the mythical crown of the United
States. The Cards were almost, but not quite, on par with the powerful
Trojan team.
A beautiful forward pass, Duffield to Tappaan, and a fast ten-yard run by
the latter, provided the single score of the day, although both teams tlireat
ened at various points of the game. Stanford had a perfect chance to score

in the opening period, but was unable
to break through the Trojan line on
four tries, for the necessary four
yards.
Card Drive Stopped
The Cards passed up a chance to
score in the first quarter. Duffield's
first punt was short, and Stanford took
the ball at about midfield. Frentrup
broke through off tackle for a beauti
ful run of twenty-five yards to bring
the ball to the Trojan fifteen-yard
line. But here the Trojans stopped the
Stanford running attack, and on the
last down, an attempted forward pass
over the goal line was caught by
Arbelbide, Trojan end.
Arbelbide pulled a "brodie" by
catching the pigskin and trying to
run it back. He was nailed on the
four-yard line and Duffield was forced
to kick from far behind his own goal
line on the next play.
Stanford Again Fails
The ball went out of bounds on the
Trojan twenty-five yard mark, and
once more the Cards were in a posi
tion to score. The Stanford backs
smashed the line for a first down on
four plays, and a lateral pass play,
Simkins to Driscoll to Rothert, netted
eleven yards. Here again, on their
three-yard line, the Southern Califor
nia line held, and forced Stanford to
resort to a pass which was incomplete
behind the Trojan goal line.
With that second wild pass went
Stanford's chance to score. During the
remainder of the contest the Cards
never got dangerously near the Tro
jan goal, although the Redshirts did
make numerous first downs around
midfield.
The Trojans, however, grabbed their
chance the first time they were within
scoring distance. Behind beautiful in
terference, Duffield made twenty
yards on two wide end runs, and on
the third try, broke away for thirty
five more as the quarter ended.
Trojans Score
Southern California made another
first down at the beginning of the
third period, and then followed that
short pass, Duffield to Tappaan, which
spelled defeat for the Cards. Musick
place-kicked for the extra point.
Despite the U.S.C. victory, Stanford
undoubtedly played a great game. To
tals of yardage gained from scrim
mage and first downs were approxi
mately equal, and it is the figures on
the pass plays which seem to indicate
where the Cards' weakness lay. Stan
ford attempted twenty-one passes, and
completed only three. Some were in
accurate, but for the most part the
U.S.C. backs had the Card receivers
too well covered.
It was simply a case of two great'
teams, with one just slightly better
than the other. Duffield, Saunders,
Hill, Musick, and all the other Trojan
ball-carriers, were just a little too
well-balanced for the Cards. Walte
Heinecke, Captain Muller, Phil Neil,
and the rest of the Stanford players
were not quite able to cope w'th that
well-timed Trojan interference, and
wo doubt very much if there is a team
in these United States which could
have toppled the Trojans yesterday.
