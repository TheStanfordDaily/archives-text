# STANFORD LOOKS AHEAD

Present sports page metaphor has it all wrong. It wasn't the Trojan
horse at all, it was the Greek horse, and it was the Trojans who got
horsed. But the U.S.C. lads reversed history Saturday, and Stanford
came out second best in the tryouts for the first fiddle in the Conference
orchestra.
At the risk of saying that the best team won, we will say that
Saturday's best team won, and hasten to congratulate the great Southern
California team on their victory, with particular praise to Howard Jones.
But for the rest of a colorful schedule, Stanford fans will not bother
about the Trojans. Fraise for them is deserved, and freely given. But
Stanford is the chief item of interest to Stanford, and the student body
will be solidly behind the team in its fight for supremacy in the rest of
its games.
There's disappointment on the Farm today. But Stanford knows its
own team's fighting spirit, and looks forward with confidence to games
well-fought and a team spirit worth supporting.
