# TELEPHONE SERVICE DEPLORABLE

### 
Telephone service through the Toyon exchange, which handles calls
from the Union, Toyon, Encina, and Branner has reached the peak of
poor service. Often it is impossible for students to get any response
from the operator; and when he does answer, it is usually to say that all
the lines are busy. Inter-dormitory service is not given in the evenings,
and calls from the outside frequently do not receive any answer from
the exchange.
Obviously the fault does not lie with the operator who courteously
handles a bad situation as well as he can. But it is impossible for a
small switchboard to control the traffic of four dormitories housing more
than a thousand students. An uncertain telephone service is as bad as
no service.
Responsibility rests with the University to enlarge the switchboard
and increase the number of operators during the evening rush, and with
the telephone company to install dials in the dormitory booths to relieve
the exchange operator from dialing all calls.
