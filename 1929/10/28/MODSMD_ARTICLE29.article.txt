# INTELLECTUAL MASS ELEVATION

### 
University student leadership in public affairs is apparently more
prevalent in European countries than among American educational cen
ters, according to statements made by Ellery Walter, globe-trotting
Washingtonian. While Spanish youth fights against the Rivers dictator
ship, other national groups are active in the world peace movement.
The American public is accustomed to seeing the student in the garb
of the athlete. The most pressing problems in the University life of our
country seem to be on the football field.
The reason for this difference in attitude made be found in diverse
methods of recruiting students. The European youth entering a uni
versity is apt to come from a family with a professional history. The
American seeking higher education comes mainly from the great mass of
the people trained in the physical conquest of a virgin continent.
Wehn American civilization becomes riper and the development of
labor-saving machinery has achieved its full fruition, the proportion of
American students having strong intellectual interests most probably will
make a better showing.â€”University of Washington Daily.
