# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....
## 
### 
Not everything at Stanford has ad
vanced in price during the last quar
ter of a century. Rooters' tickets to
the Big Game —except that they
weren't called "rooters' tickets" then
—were announced for sale on October
27, 1904, at $1.50 each. Even then pre
cautions were taken to exclude the
general public from the rooting sec
tion. Every purchaser had to give a
written order for his ticket. Both the
Stanford and California sections
seated 685.
The total capacity of the new
bleachers was 15,548. The remaining
seats sold for $2.50, $2.00, and $1.50.
For their $1.50, rooters did not fare
as well as they do at present. The
seats on the fifty-yard line were all
sold to the public and alumni, while
the rooters' sections of the two uni
versities wore directly opposite, and
two sections removed from tho cen

ter of the field.
At a meeting of the English Club
at the Delta Upsilon house it was an
nounced that the "History of Stan
ford" which the club had spent the
previous year in compiling would be
published in December. The club de
cided to present another play during
the year, and placed its choice in the
hands of a committee with Lee Emer
son Bassett as chairman.
Professor Bassett graduated in the
class of '01 and is now the head of
the Department of Public Speaking at
Stanford.
The University of Oregon football
team arrived on the campus for a
game with Stanford. In a short prac
tice scrimmage between the Stanford
varsity and second teams, the second
team outplayed the varsity.
