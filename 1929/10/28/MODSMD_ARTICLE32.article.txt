'"HOMEPLACE," by Maristan Chap
man. The Viking Press. 1929. At
the Alcove Bookshop, Palo Alto.
To those who read and enjoyed
"The Happy Mountain" by Maristan
Chapman, there is little need to say of
this new book by the same author that
it is well worth reading. "Homeplace"
is another tale from the Tennessee
hills. Glen Hazard is the village in
which the men and women of "Home
place," as well as those of "The Hap
py Mountain," live.
Fayre Jones must find for himself
a "homeplace" before she whom he
loves will consent to become his
"wife-woman." That is the problem
of the novel, the problem Fayre must
solve for himself—the finding and
buying of a place for him and his Bess
to live in.
Fayre has difficulties. It is not easy
for him to secure his "homeplace."
There is first the difficulty of finding
a place, then there is the greater diffi
culty of finding "cash money" to pay
for that place. Fayre, in his attempt
to secure money, finds that there is
within him a conflict. There is money.
That must be got somehow. But the
one way he had of getting it involved
him in what he felt would be moral
wrong-doing.
Finally Fayre's troubles come to a
He does in the end
have for his Bess a "homeplace"—
and he has in that homeplace his
Bess.
There is in this story no plot of
consequence. We are made to feel
that Fayre might quite possibly have
won his Bess had he not had the good
fortune to inherit the wherewithal to
procure a particular '"homeplace."
What gives to the book its charm
is not the solution of a problem—pre
suming that the solution of a problem
has on occasion some anomalous
charm —not that, but the felicitous
choice of words which are in them
selves pleasing to read. There is per
haps a bit too much dialect to be eas
ily understood, but the sound of the
words to an inner ear as they reach
that ear in the reading is wholly de
lightful. There are few writers of
prose who currently write prose so
nearly like free verse as is this of
Miss Chapman's.
Miss Chapman's prose suggests that
of Thomas Hardy. In the story
"Homeplace" there is, too, a likeness
observed between this one and one
of Hardy's, "The Woodlanders."
"Homeplace" is a story of greater
simplicity than "The Woodlanders,"
but there is in them both a poetic
quality that is in each instance pe

culiar and inimitable.
Far more convincing than can be
the words of a reviewer are the words
of the writer in helping a reader to
decide whether some certain book de
serves a reading. Fayre sits with his
friend, Waits, and his wife, Bess —
sits in his new homeplace. Says
Fayre:
"What do folk get out of loving and
wedding at long last?" Fayre asked,
folding Bess's hand in his.
"Young-uns," Waits said readily,
"and the world starting again as a
consequence."
"A homeplace," Bess said, "and
each other to care for, and —Just a
heap o' things that fail of rightly go
ing in words."

"The Four Feathers"—New Stanford.
This is not an animal picture. The
feathers refer to the tokens of cow
ardice which Richard Arlen's sweet
heart, father, and two best friends
give him when he refuses to go to war
and fight on for a D.S.C.
The motif of "The Four Feathers"
is the so-I'm-yellowl-am-I? idea of
tried and true vintage. Once we get
past the first few reels, which are
tedious, we get our chance to see the
most heroic hero that ever looked a
camera in the face. Our Rickie's trans
formation into a superman necessi
tates some of the most hair-breadth
escapes imaginable. That rhinoceros
chase is about as good as anything of
the sort ever filmed.
This worm is not the same on both
sides, and when he turns, well, it's no
fake reverse. He goes into darkest
Africa and not only saves his snooty
comrades but, also, an entire British
regiment beleaguered by the black
peril.
Cameramen spent two years in
Africa kodaking the Fuzzy-Wuzzies j
(the most ferocious natives outside of ;
Borneo) and other things peculiar to |
that continent. These shots have been !
so skillfully blended into the studio
made scenes that you'll be hard
pressed to tell where realism leaves
off and art begins.
"The Four Feathers" is not all-talk
ing; the act is mediocre. But the
rhinocerous stampede is the most
thrilling thing in ages. Fay Wray, as
the heroine, has less "It" than anyone
we've ever seen. William Powell and
Clive Brook are present in colorless
roles, and Richard Arlen's handsome
countenance is marred by a silly
moustache.
If you'd like to see a real honest-to-
Mix hair-raiser, then you'd better see
this picture. You'll simmer with sus
pense when those rhinoceros-us start
en masse after Mr. Arlen.
