What a game! What a spectacle!
What a sock on the jaw!
Southern California won, of course,
but Stanford had the prettiest jerseys.
What with the speed of modern
printing, one may expect the result
on Los Angeles advertising circulars
within the week.
Something of the same local pride
that Palo Alto exhibits in Stanford
University.
And immortalizes on its own Cham
ber of Commerce output.
Booing is strictly forbidden at the
local talking screen, since it inter
feres with audiences catching all the
dialogue.
Paraphrasing an old joke, we might

It's never safe to let go of the thing
entirely, however.
By the way, in honor of our recent

Union's 10-cent coffee provides its
own boycott.
