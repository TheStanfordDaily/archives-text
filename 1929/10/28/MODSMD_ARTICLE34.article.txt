NEW YORK, Oct. 27. (/P) â€” The
American Bankers Association dis
closed today that 1850 banks in 39
states with resources of $13,275,000,-
000 had been swept into various chain
groups by the force of the surrent
"seismic revolution" against individu
alism.
The association issued its first coun
try-wide survey of chains and group
banking. Two hundred and seventy
three bank chains have sprung into
existence. Details of their organiza
tion and the swift progress of the
movement from coast to coast suggest
the rise of something akin to a mod
ern feudalistic regime in finance.
