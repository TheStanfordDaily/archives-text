# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Another "Stanford tradition" seems
to be departing, and I, for one, am
sorry. I am referring to the Thursday
afternoon organ recitals which from
now on are to be butchered by the
intermixing of organ numbers, pray
ers, scripture reading, and talks.
I have nothing against either the
acting chaplain or Dr. Gardner. It is
merely that I like to hear forty-live
minutes of organ music without being
read to, preached at, or prayed tor.
My hope is that this innovation will
not spread to the other recital hours,
for I am certain that there are Stan
ford people who like their music pure
and unadulterated. I have not heard
any great cry for more frequent
church services.
