What is it? Are we becoming sated
with good football, or was the game
really not especially thrilling? To us,
it seemed too much a dreary repeti
tion of the unhappy affair in the Coli
seum last year. U.S.C. playing great
football, but machine-like, inhumanly
perfect football. And Stanford fighting
hard and showing well, but —failing
to win. Where are the thrills of yes
teryear —the drives to victory of 1925
and -26, and that heart-disturbing rush
to tie the score of 1927? Apparently,
such highlights as these just weren't
intended to distinguish the 1929 meet
ing of Cardinal and Trojan.

HIGH HONORS TO U.S.C. DEFENSE
The game did not present a con
stant shifting of advantage. Once
Dutfield demonstrated how he
could step into the open for gains
which he could repeat almost at
will, it dawned on one that only
something lucky and unexpected
would turn the tide of victory to
Stanford. When U.S.C. held the
Cardinal offensive on the five-yard
line and when it showed that it
had every pass receiver so dog
gedly covered that only a fluke
would permit the completion of a
pass, right then the Southern Cali
fornia defensive system matricu
lated with high honors and it be
came only a question of in what
manner its offense would score.

To be sure, the Trojans scored on
a lucky play—and therein Pop War
ner's prediction that a lucky play
would win the game came true —but if
they hadn't got out in front by that
pass from Duffield to Tappaan, they
would have scored somehow.

MORE ANALYSIS
Stanford played virtually as strong
an offensive game as the Trojans—
through the greater part of the con
test at least. Carrying the ball 61
times the Cardinal backs advanced a
total of 211 yards, while the U.S.C.
backfield made 228 yards in 56 ad
vances. It was the breakup of War
ner's passing attack which gave
Southern California its margin of su
periority in the first-half clash of
strength, and as the game went into
its final stages, this margin extended
to other departments of offense.

When all's said and done (and at
the rate we are going, it doesn't seem
as if it ever will be), Phil Moffatt
was about right when he said after
the game that it was U.S.C.'s inter
ference and blocking which ruined us.

OUR BIFF IN THE PRESS BOX
"What a game! What a spec
tacle!" exclaimed Biff Hoffman in
his story of the event. However,
Biff was as stolid in his place in
the press box as Mencken would
be at a Rotary Club luncheon.
Stanford heroes: in the line —Cap-
tain Muller, Tandy, Heinecke, and
Phil Neill; in the backfield —Bill Clark,
Frentrup, Moffatt, and Rothert.
