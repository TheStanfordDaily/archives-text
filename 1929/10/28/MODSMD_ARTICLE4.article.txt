# GOOD READING AND CAREFUL SPEAKING ENRICH, LIFE SAYS DIMNET IN CAMPUS SPEECH
## 
### 
The Abbâ‚¬ Ernest Dimnet, emi
nent French writer, will speak on
"French Poetry" at 7:30 in the
Assembly Hall tomorrow and
Wednesday evenings.

Be yourself in conversation and in
writing. Don't try to imitate others.
Too many people waste time talking
about petty details, little unmportant
things. Only speak when you have
something to say. Good reading and
careful speaking will enrich your
life." This was the message Abb 6
Ernest Dimnet gave in his address
on "The Art of Thinking" before an
audience which filled the Memorial
Chapel last night. This was the first
of a series of lectures he will deliver
at Stanford.
Thinking about nothing and think
ing about all sorts of thing is just

the same thing, the Abb 6 said.
Thought is a resisting, stopping, fix
ing process. It gives superiority to
the thinker, which the average person
explains away by saying that the
skilled conversationalist or thinker
has had move advantages than he. We
are often horrified by a sincere idea.
It is possible to think more quickly
and plentifully when resting at night.
Concentration is the fixing of thought,
an act of the will. Anyone who wants
to can do it.
History portrays brilliant, enticing
humanity. The newspaper is a page
of history which should be read criti
cally and intelligently. People read a
great deal of trash because they think
that doing so is a sign of indepen
dence. Sunday comics poison the
good literature makes life rich, said
minds of children and adults; while
the Abb 6 in closing.
