# SPIRIT-COLOR-RIVALRY U.S.C. Tilt Equals Big Game BAND MANEUVERS GOOD
## 
### 
Eighty-eight thousand fans who wit
nessed the Stanford team bowled over
by a smooth-working, sturdy, football
machine bearing the Los Angeles
trade mark will admit that the Big
Game now has a counterpart for color,
spirit, and rivalry. All three of those
things were rampant in the stands and
on the field Saturday. Although the
rivalry between the bay colleges ante
dates that between Stanford and the
University of Southern California, it
is clear that it does not surpass it.
* * *
Sportsmanship to nth degree
was manifested by both rooting
sections. In fact, there was so
much that it approached the Al
fonso and Gaston type of courtesy.

Dr. Martin's Stanford band was the
best seen and heard on this campus
within the memory of the present col
lege generation. Snappy music, skill
fully rendered, and almost incredible
maneuvers made it the hit of the day.
"Hello USC" was spelled before the
visiting rooters; then a few direct
steps and the band was heading for
the Stanford side in standard forma
tion. Presto! And "Stanford" was
formed to the tune of "Come Join the
Band."
* * *
The U.S.C. serenaders, in white
this time, put on their usual show with
the addition of artillery. Very snappy
also. Bands exchanged courtesies be
fore rooting sections and the Trojans
used a uniformed glee club to good
advantage.
