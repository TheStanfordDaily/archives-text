# SPORTS OF 1929
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
The scene is the Stanford stadium,
in October, 1927. Stanford is playing
Southern California. The score is 13
to 7 in favor of the University of
Southern California Trojans, and
there are two minutes to play. Pop
Warner puts in Herb Fleishhacker, a
sophomore, known for his powerful
line crushing. Smack! Herb hits the
line with a rush and a roar like the
Broadway Limited! Crash! He cracks
it again like an infuriated buffalo.
Bang! Again the big thunderbolt
bowls over tacklers right and left like
the shell of a Big Bertha!
The Trojans are backing up. Tre
mendous excitement reigns! The Uni
versity of Southern California rooters
are terribly worried. Howard Jones is
rushing in reserves. The Stanford
cheering section is going wild. An-

other smack! The human pile-driver
again carries the ball forward four
or five yards. He is unstoppable, a
Coy, Thorpe, Heston, and Maulbetsch
all rolled into one! Another crash!
This is the most vicious line plunging
ever seen on the coast. Ernie Nevers
himself never ploughed through op
position as this huge sophomore is
doing. Bang! And Fleishhaeker fum
bles —but recovers! The excitement
is terrific.
Then, with less than a minute to
play and about seven yards to go, the
215-pound fullback tosses a neat little
left-handed forward pass that takes
the Trojans completely by surprise,
snatches victory out of the very jaws
of defeat, and ties the score 13 to 13!
What a game, and what a man, this
Herb Fleishhaeker!
The son of a millionaire San Fran
ciscan, Herb is also noted for his
ability as a shot putter and golfer.
Playing in the quarterback position
last season, he had much to do with
Stanford's slaughter of the West
Point cadets in the Yankee stadium.
Watch the Thundering Herb go this
season!

The Trojans are backing up. Tre
mendous excitement reigns! The Uni
versity of Southern California rooters
are terribly worried. Howard Jones is
rushing in reserves. The Stanford
cheering section is going wild. An-

other smack! The human pile-driver
again carries the ball forward four
or five yards. He is unstoppable, a
Coy, Thorpe, Heston, and Maulbetsch
all rolled into one! Another crash!
This is the most vicious line plunging
ever seen on the coast. Ernie Nevers
himself never ploughed through op
position as this huge sophomore is
doing. Bang! And Fleishhaeker fum
bles —but recovers! The excitement
is terrific.
Then, with less than a minute to
play and about seven yards to go, the
215-pound fullback tosses a neat little
left-handed forward pass that takes
the Trojans completely by surprise,
snatches victory out of the very jaws
of defeat, and ties the score 13 to 13!
What a game, and what a man, this
Herb Fleishhaeker!
The son of a millionaire San Fran
ciscan, Herb is also noted for his
ability as a shot putter and golfer.
Playing in the quarterback position
last season, he had much to do with
Stanford's slaughter of the West
Point cadets in the Yankee stadium.
Watch the Thundering Herb go this
season!
