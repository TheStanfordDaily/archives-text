# HISTORICAL CHINESE ANTIQUES EXHIBITED IN KEHR COLLECTION
## Rare Pieces Cover Period of More Than 2,000 Years, Says Collector 
### Catherine Spaulding 
Rare Oriental antiques, which form
one of the most interesting exhibits
ever shown at the Stanford Art Gal
lery, were opened to the public yes
terday and will continue on display
through the holiday season. The ma
terial was collected and loaned by
Mr. Frederick Kehr of Palo Alto.
Mr. Kehr has made a hobby of col
lecting rare specimens which are ar
tistic as well as historical and an
tique. There are ceramics, bronzes,
wood carvings, and paintings in the
collection. Most of the articles are
Chinese and they cover a period of
over two thousand years.
Mystery Color
The most valuable piece of the col
lection is a large porcelain vase, in
tricately designed in the Chinese sa
cred emblem of two dragons guarding
the holy pearl. Worked into the de
sign are a group of sea birds eating
the seed of the lotus flower. The piece
is extremely rare because of its ou
bergine (eggplant) color. This color
cannot be reproduced today and was
lost after the Ming Dynasty. Pearly
gray and blue intermingle with the
oubergine, and the method of running
these colors together is also a mys
tery.
Chinese temple bells are always
found in pairs, the male and the fe
male, and the two can be told apart
by the difference in key—the higher
being the female and the lower, the
male. There is a pair of rare bells,
carved in bronze, from the Ming Dy
nasty.
Bandit Torture
Among the interesting wood carv
ings is the head of a Manchurian ban
dit. It is a Japanese wood carving
and represents the bandit being tor
tured to death by first having a hole
drilled in his brain and an irritating
piece of metal then inserted. The
head is life size and real hair and
glass eyes add greatly to the realistic
effect.
One of the rarest examples of mini
ature painting is found on an old Chi
nese fan, formerly belonging to a
court lady. The fan is made of a
single piece of bamboo slit into rigs,
and although the surface is rough the
beauty of the painting is much en
hanced by the use of a magnifying
glass. This brings out the fine brush
strokes which in this day can hardly
be accomplished with the pen.

Chinese and they cover a period of
over two thousand years.
Mystery Color
The most valuable piece of the col
lection is a large porcelain vase, in
tricately designed in the Chinese sa
cred emblem of two dragons guarding
the holy pearl. Worked into the de
sign are a group of sea birds eating
the seed of the lotus flower. The piece
is extremely rare because of its ou
bergine (eggplant) color. This color
cannot be reproduced today and was
lost after the Ming Dynasty. Pearly
gray and blue intermingle with the
oubergine, and the method of running
these colors together is also a mys
tery.
Chinese temple bells are always
found in pairs, the male and the fe
male, and the two can be told apart
by the difference in key—the higher
being the female and the lower, the
male. There is a pair of rare bells,
carved in bronze, from the Ming Dy
nasty.
Bandit Torture
Among the interesting wood carv
ings is the head of a Manchurian ban
dit. It is a Japanese wood carving
and represents the bandit being tor
tured to death by first having a hole
drilled in his brain and an irritating
piece of metal then inserted. The
head is life size and real hair and
glass eyes add greatly to the realistic
effect.
One of the rarest examples of mini
ature painting is found on an old Chi
nese fan, formerly belonging to a
court lady. The fan is made of a
single piece of bamboo slit into rigs,
and although the surface is rough the
beauty of the painting is much en
hanced by the use of a magnifying
glass. This brings out the fine brush
strokes which in this day can hardly
be accomplished with the pen.
Rare Oriental antiques, which form
one of the most interesting exhibits
ever shown at the Stanford Art Gal
lery, were opened to the public yes
terday and will continue on display
through the holiday season. The ma
terial was collected and loaned by
Mr. Frederick Kehr of Palo Alto.
Mr. Kehr has made a hobby of col
lecting rare specimens which are ar
tistic as well as historical and an
tique. There are ceramics, bronzes,
wood carvings, and paintings in the
collection. Most of the articles are
Chinese and they cover a period of
over two thousand years.
