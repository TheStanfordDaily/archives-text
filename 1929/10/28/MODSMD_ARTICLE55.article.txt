# ALASKA 'FARTHEST NORTH' COLLEGE OBSERVES STRICT LOCK-OUT RULES
## 
### Ruth Miner 
Where women learn to tan reindeer
skins and boys learn to work stamp
mills and mines as part of a college
education, is Alaska College, farthest
north of all universities, and just 120
miles south of the Arctic Circle.
The proportion of men to women
runs about the same as it does at
Stanford, on account of the large num
ber of college men who go to Alaska
as a place to get an "education in
adventure."
Strict Lockout Rules
Smoking is prohibited to both men
and women in the college. The girls'
dormitory is locked at 11:00, when
lights must be out. Typewriters may
be used only from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m.
Freshmen are allowed to date out on
Friday and Saturday nights only, but
other classmen may also go out on
Wednesday. Permission must be se
cured for car-riding, and for going into
town more than twice a week, even
during the day. Girls must also sign
out to go to the library. Men whose
work averages under 80 per cent may
not go into town except on Friday
and Saturday nights.
Winter Bars Football
Because winter sets in too soon,
there is no football team; but the col
lege sponsors a basketball team which
takes an annual one-month trip of
3000 miles, averaging one game every
other day. A toboggan slide on the
campus furnishes recreation.

Students are self-governing, en
forcing their own honor system and
organizing their clubs. They have
formed a college orchestra and last
year published Volume VII of the year
book, the "Farthest North Collegian."
There is also an annual freshman bon
fire.
Labor Dignified
The dignity of manual labor is em
phasized in the curriculum, as well
as in the work which most students
do for self-support. Four-year courses
are offered in agriculture, including
reindeer management, business ad
ministration, and mining, in addition
to the ordinary academic -courses.
Entrance requirements correspond to
those of United States universities.
During the summer, however, 12-week
extension courses, designed for those
without credits, are given in home
economics, agriculture (including
reindeer management), and mining.
Although the percentage of students
who graduate from high schools is
proportionately smaller, the number
of those graduates who go on to col
lege is relatively greater than in the
United States. The total enrollment
for last year was 157.
Five Alaskan students are regis
tered at Stanford this fall. Among
them are Jean Bunnell, daughter of
Dr. Charles E. Bunnell, who is presi
dent of the college; and Lester D.
Henderson, Commissioner of Educa
tion of Alaska.

those of United States universities.
During the summer, however, 12-week
extension courses, designed for those
without credits, are given in home
economics, agriculture (including
reindeer management), and mining.
Although the percentage of students
who graduate from high schools is
proportionately smaller, the number
of those graduates who go on to col
lege is relatively greater than in the
United States. The total enrollment
for last year was 157.
Five Alaskan students are regis
tered at Stanford this fall. Among
them are Jean Bunnell, daughter of
Dr. Charles E. Bunnell, who is presi
dent of the college; and Lester D.
Henderson, Commissioner of Educa
tion of Alaska.
Where women learn to tan reindeer
skins and boys learn to work stamp
mills and mines as part of a college
education, is Alaska College, farthest
north of all universities, and just 120
miles south of the Arctic Circle.
The proportion of men to women
runs about the same as it does at
Stanford, on account of the large num
ber of college men who go to Alaska
as a place to get an "education in
adventure."
Strict Lockout Rules
Smoking is prohibited to both men
and women in the college. The girls'
dormitory is locked at 11:00, when
lights must be out. Typewriters may
be used only from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m.
Freshmen are allowed to date out on
Friday and Saturday nights only, but
other classmen may also go out on
Wednesday. Permission must be se
cured for car-riding, and for going into
town more than twice a week, even
during the day. Girls must also sign
out to go to the library. Men whose
work averages under 80 per cent may
not go into town except on Friday
and Saturday nights.
Winter Bars Football
Because winter sets in too soon,
there is no football team; but the col
lege sponsors a basketball team which
takes an annual one-month trip of
3000 miles, averaging one game every
other day. A toboggan slide on the
campus furnishes recreation.

Students are self-governing, en
forcing their own honor system and
organizing their clubs. They have
formed a college orchestra and last
year published Volume VII of the year
book, the "Farthest North Collegian."
There is also an annual freshman bon
fire.
Labor Dignified
The dignity of manual labor is em
phasized in the curriculum, as well
as in the work which most students
do for self-support. Four-year courses
are offered in agriculture, including
reindeer management, business ad
ministration, and mining, in addition
to the ordinary academic -courses.
Entrance requirements correspond to
those of United States universities.
