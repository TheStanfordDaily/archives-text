# FOUR HUNDRED COME TO STANFORD BY AIR FOR GAME SATURDAY
## 
### 
Four hundred persons, approximate
ly one per cent of the fans who came
from more than thirty miles away,
traveled to Saturday's game by air.
Planes varying from single-seaters to
the giant tri-motored air transports
carried the crowd to and from the cam
pus, and so crowded was the field that
ten more planes would have made
parking a problem.
Traffic conditions were as trying for
the aviators as they were for motor
ists on the highway, for planes took
off as soon as they were loaded. Army
and commercial planes struggled with
pleasure craft for an opportunity to
leave, and some departures were de
layed until the use of flood lights
were made imperative, so large was
the crowd.
