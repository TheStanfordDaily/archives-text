HOME, Oct. 27. (yP) â€”Premier Benito j
Mussolini today on the seventh anni
versary of the Fascist march on Rome j
told thousands of "Black Shirts" j
massed in front of Venezia Palace that
"after seven years we are younger,
stronger, and more implacable than
before." The Premier's brief speech i
was interrupted at times by shouts of :
"death to political exiles," prompted j
by the attack on Crown Prince Hum- |
bert in Brussels last week by an j
Italian who has been living in Paris.
