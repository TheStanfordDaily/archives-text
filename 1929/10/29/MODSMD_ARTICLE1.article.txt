### 
EUGENE, Ore., Oct. 28. (yP)—Three
persons, one a young woman, were
killed late today when a single-mo
tored monoplane crashed into a tree
while attempting a landing in a small
field near Walker, Oregon, eight miles

papers carried as those of Lieutenant

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 28. (£>)— A
Western Air Express passenger liner,
eastbound to Kansas City, was lost,
apparently somewhere in eastern Ari
zona or western New Mexico tonight.
The passengers were Dr. A. W.
Ward, nationally known dental au
thority of San Francisco, and W, E.
Merz, of Mount Vernon, N.Y.
C. C. Cole, superintendent of opera
tions, expressed hope that pilots had
set the plane down in eastern Arizona
or western New Mexico when he dis
covered bad weather ahead of them,
and that delay in hearing from the
plane was due to the character of the
country and inability of the three
crew members immediately to reach a
telephone or telegraph office.
Western Air Express ships were
being held here and at Albuquerque,
prepared to start an immediate search
when more definite indication of the
plane's possible whereabouts is re
ceived. Should word be received from
the crew, a plane will be dispatched
at once to care for the passengers and
crew members.

C. C. Cole, superintendent of opera
tions, expressed hope that pilots had
set the plane down in eastern Arizona
or western New Mexico when he dis
covered bad weather ahead of them,
and that delay in hearing from the
plane was due to the character of the
country and inability of the three
crew members immediately to reach a
telephone or telegraph office.
Western Air Express ships were
being held here and at Albuquerque,
prepared to start an immediate search
when more definite indication of the
plane's possible whereabouts is re
ceived. Should word be received from
the crew, a plane will be dispatched
at once to care for the passengers and
crew members.
