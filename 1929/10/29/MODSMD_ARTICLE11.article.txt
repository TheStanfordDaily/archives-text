# PANTAGES FACES MAXIMUM TERM OF FIFTY YEARS
## Plans Laid by Lawyers for Continuation of Fight For Freedom 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 28. (/P)â€” Hag
gard from a sleepless night, Alexander
Pantages, theatre multimillionaire,
convicted last night of a statutory of
fense against Eunice Pringle, 17-year
old dancer, today followed county jail
routine and laid plans to carry on his
fight for freedom.
After deliberating slightly over 53
hours after being given the case at
4:17 p.m., Friday, the jury of seven
women and five men at 9:29 o'clock
Sunday evening returned a verdict of
guilty, demanding a sentence to state's
prison. Next Friday morning was set
by Superior Judge Charles W. Fricke
for the imposing of sentence, which
is prescribed by law as one to fifty
years. The minimum and maximum
length of the sentence, which must
be set by the prison board following
one year's service, may be determined
somewhat by the jury's recommenda
tion that clemency be extended.
In Sheriff's Custody
The 54-year-old multimillionaire
theatre man, tried and convicted of
an atack upon Miss Pringle in a tiny
conference room adjoining his suite of
offices in the Pantages Theatre build
ing last August 9, immediately was re
manded to the custody of the sheriff.
He will remain in jail pending action
on motions for a new trial and ap
peals, which will be made at the time
of sentencing Friday. His trio of at
torneys quoted Pantages as declaring
he would "fight it out" to the finish.
The wealthy man's wife, Mrs. Lois
Pantages, was not at the Hall of Jus
tice but confined to her home, suffer
ing from shock and illness as the re
sult of her recent manslaughter con
viction. She was tried in the same
courtroom as her convicted husband,
for the death of Joe Rokumoto, Japa
nese gardener, following an automo
bile collision, at which time she was
accused of being intoxicated.
