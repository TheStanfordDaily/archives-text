# U.S. MARKET HIT ANEW BY SELLING ORGY
## Wall Street in Turmoil as Issues Are Forced Down From $5 to $35 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 28. (£>)—' Wall
Street was thrown into turmoil again
today by another disastrous break in
stock prices, which carried scores of
issues down $5 to $35 a share, many
of them below the low levels reached
in last Thursday's record-breaking
session. Prices slid off steadily from
the opening with the ticker falling
steadily behind until it was nearly an
hour late around the end of the third
hour. Indications were that the day's
total would run over 8,000,000 shares.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 28. (/P)—
Stocks hit the toboggan in San Fran
cisco today, echoing the crashes of
eastern exchanges. Ten issues fell to
new lows for the year under a turn
over that set a new record in money
value for 1929 at well over $22,000,000.
Opening down, prices slipped steadily
lower throughout the day as increased
selling pressure was put on, partly
from professional bears and some
what from frightened investors and
from traders whose margins needed
further protection.
Transamerica was again the selling
center, but again stood its ground,
never selling below the opening price
of 62 1 / £. Never was the San Francisco
market seen such a turnover in any
issue as was witnessed in Trans
america. The day's total reached
267,018 shares, representing nearly
$17,000,000. As the day wore on selling
of the Giannini Holding Corporation
gained acceleration, blocks of 5,000
shares appearing on the tape, the
close halting a frenzied trading rush.
