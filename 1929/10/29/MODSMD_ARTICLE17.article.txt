# EXPERIENCED CAMPUS ACTORS HAVE NEW TYPE ROLES IN "IVORY DOOR"
## 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
Several members of the cast of
"The Ivory Door" to be given here
this Friday night who have had parts
in previous campus productions will
carry roles of a very different type
in this play.
Trow Stevens, who was the very
suave, smooth Herbert in "Not Her
bert," will take the part of a very
grandiose travelling mummer in this
play of A. A. Milne's. He has a rather
clever scene with Prince Perivale in
which he instructs the monarch in
the kingly manner. This scene is per
haps the one most representative of
Milne's whimsicality; for here Ste
vens, the magnificent mummer who
has played a hundred kings, shows
Perivale, a real king, how to walk,
how to talk, and how to gesture.
Paul Speegle, in the part of King
Perivale. will also be doing a role
which is quite different from any he
has done. His previous parts having
been farcical and comic, this time he
will carry the heaviest role in the play.
Whimsical, ironic, and humorous, he
plays a part which seems largely to
be an expression of Milne's philo
sophy. He is a delightful, happy-go
lucky, humorous king, who through
out the play maintains a philosophical
detached attitude as if he were look

ing with smiling eyes through the
wrong end of a pair of field glasses.
Princess Lilia will be played by
Katlierine Keho, whose previous
work on the stage has been quite dif
ferent from this part, also. Remem
bered chiefly for her brilliant inter
pretation of Maggie in Barrie's com
edy "What Every Woman Knows,"
she will be seen in "The Ivory Door"
as a magnificent young queen, who
has more courage than the people of
Perivale's court have seen in a wo
j man for generations. When she dis
covers that her betrothed, King Peri
vale, has gone through the ivory door,
she follows him into the region of un
known terrors beyond the door.
Arthur Hurt, who played one of the
brothers in "What Every Woman
| Knows," has one of the chief charac
-1 ter parts in this play. As Old Beppo,
he will portray the generation pre
ceding rerivale's, being the only one
left who saw King Stephen pass
through the door years before.
Douglas Gregg, a member of the
; casts of the junior opera and"The
Wild Duck," and Lucille Morgan, who
lis new to Stanford dramatics, will
â–  have small parts, playing the roles of
| Simeon, a member of the court, and
Thora, Princess Lilia's maid, respec
tively.
