# Women Of Stanford Find New Use For Overworked $5 Bill
## 
### 
Another use for a five-dollar bill is
proposed by the Women's Council in
a circular letter to all women's living
groups. The Council, appreciating the
difficulty with which Stanford women
combat the vicissitudes of present-day
life, offers the following suggestions:
"1. On account of the possible in
creased danger of driving on the high
way after the U.S.C. and U.C. game
celebrations in San Francisco, it is
urged that all of the girls who are
going up to the city after the game
plan if possible to stay over night
with friends or at the Stewart Hotel
(a women's hotel); the Women's City
Club; or the Y.W.C.A. Arrangements
should be made as early as possible
on account of crowded conditions in
the City.
"2. In case a girl plans to return
home that night, and finds that she
does not wish to return with her es
cort, she may call Miss Yost, Palo
Alto G624, at any hour.
"3. Each girl, whether or not she
plans to stay in the City over night,
should take with her for emergency
need five dollars.
"Sincerely yours,
"WOMEN'S COUNCIL"
Whether this pronunciamiento will
materially decrease sales of travelers'
checks remains to be seen.
