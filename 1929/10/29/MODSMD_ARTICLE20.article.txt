# DEAN YOST TALKS ON WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES IN ROBLE DISCUSSION
## 
### 
"Whatever you do, do so well that
the common criticism made hy the
men that a girl cannot do a job, will
not apply," advised Dean Mary Yost
who spoke informally to the new wo
men concerning "Extra Curricular
Activities," last night in the Roble
library. This is the second of a series
of discussion groups held every other
Monday night by Miss Yost. The next
one will deal with the unorganized
social life on the campus.
A political science seminar of stu
dent officers to discuss student gov
ernment problems in the light of
scientific political science theories
was suggested by Miss Yost as an
activity needed on the campus. In
this way student- government could
be improved and problems solved
practically and scientifically.
