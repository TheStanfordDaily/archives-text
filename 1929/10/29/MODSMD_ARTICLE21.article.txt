# Toyon Club To Give Dutch Dance November Fifteenth
## 
### 
Guests of Toyon Club at their fall
informal, to be held Friday night, No
vember 15th, will be transported for
the evening to old Holland. Wind
mills, wooden shoes, Dutch bonnets,
dikes, will lend a Dutch atmosphere
to the hall on this evening.
A San Francisco orchestra which
has played at several campus dances
in the past will furnish music and
entertainment. Bids will go on sale
at $2.75 to Toyon members early next
week. As it is desired not to over
crowd the floor, a limited number of
tickets will be available.
