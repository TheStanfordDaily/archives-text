# CARD GRID TEAM HAS SHORT REST AFTER S.C. TILT
## "Pop" Warner Will Resume Practice This Afternoon; Men Will Not Be in Suit Preston, Dawson Each Have Broken Rib; Rothert Re-Injures Leg Against Troy 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Practice sessions of the Stan
ford gridiron team will be re
sumed this afternoon, with all
members of the varsity squad
reporting to the practice field
without their football suits for a
chalk talk at 4 o'clock.
—Coach Glenn Scobey Warner

With more or less of a set-up sched
uled for the coming week-end, the
Cards will continue to get some much
needed rest today and are not ex
pected to get down to real tough,
workouts until tomorrow or the fol
lowing day. Cal Tech should not offer
an overamount of resistance on Satur
day, and Coach Warner is not taking
any chances before the Washington
game two weeks from now.
It is quite probable that the second
and third-string squads will be used
a greater part of the Cal Tech en
counter, as most of the regulars were
rather badly bruised up in the Trojan
clash. Although no one was severely
injured, three members were added to
the hospital list and may not see
action at all this week.
Johnny Preston, at end, and Ray
Dawson, guard, each sustained a
broken rib last Saturday, while Har
low Rothert re-injured his knee. The
latter is still hobbling around on
crutches, but according to Dr. E. F.
Roth, team physician, should be out
in suit again by the time the Wash
ington game rolls around.
