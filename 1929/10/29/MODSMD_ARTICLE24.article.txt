### 
At the Football Gaieties tryouts
this afternoon in the Assembly Hall
between 3 and 6 o'clock, Ram's Head
Society hopes to find new material
for the coming show. All students who
can sing are requested to report dur
ing those hours to this "discovery
afternoon." No prepared acts, songs,
or stunts will be necessary; the com
mittee merely wants a chance to find
new talent on the campus. Dancers,
harmony singers, and instrumentalists
are also desired at the tryouts this
afternoon, as well as any novelty per
formers.
The last skits were turned in to
