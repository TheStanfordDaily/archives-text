# Dr. Lee Talks On Hydrogen Before Chemistry Seminar
## 
### 
The recent discovery of two Kinds
of hydrogen was the topic of a talk
by Dr. W. B. Lee at a chemistry
seminar held yesterday afternoon in
Room 20 of the Chemistry Building.
The theory that verifies the existence
of these two hydrogens was also dis
cussed.
Dr. Lee presented a detailed ac
count of Bonhoeffer's experiments in
Ortho- and Para-Hydrogen and told
how ordinary hydrogen, when suffi
ciently lowered in temperature, would
show traces of the two kinds of gas.
