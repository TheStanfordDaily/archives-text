# WAS CHAPPIE SERIOUS ABOUT THE NEW THEATER?
## 
### 
Those thousand people who went to hear the Abbe Ernest Dimnet
speak on "The Art of Thinking" in the Memorial Church Sunday evening
were disappointed, disappointed because they could not get the message
this learned man of letters had prepared for them. And it was not Dim
net's fault any more than it was their own.
It is pitiful that Stanford has no building with proper acoustic quali
ties. It becomes a disgrace when Stanford invites men of note to speak
011 the campus, encroaches 011 their time, and then robs the audience of
an inspiring message because there is 110 building in which a speaker with
the average voice can be heard.
The administration admits that there is need of such a building, but
states its hands are bound financially. So last year the students, at the
instigation of the Hammer and Coffin Society and Chaparral, started a
movement to raise money for a new Stanford theater, for which no self
respecting university would have to apologize. Such a proposal met with
instant approval of the student body and more than $4000 was collected,
quite a tidy sum to be laid by in a year.
This worthy project should not be allowed to die. Present Sons of
the Stanford Red may never be fortunate enough to utilize a new theater.
They can at least pave the way for one in the future and relieve the
campus of the present curse of having an antiquated building where "si
lence reigns supreme" because of the poor acoustic qualities.
The Daily hopes that its foolish contemporary, the Old Boy, was not
pulling a joke when he started the New Theater Movement and that it
will soon be revived.
