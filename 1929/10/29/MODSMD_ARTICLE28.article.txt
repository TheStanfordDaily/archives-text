# FILL UP THE BUMPER...
## 
### 
Twenty-two hard-working, serious-minded individuals join the Daily
staff today at the culmination of three weeks of hectic tryouts. These
people, who are normal even though they are attracted by the roar of the
presses, a messy place to work, irregular hours, and the desire of butting
into other people's business, are to be congratulated for surviving when
fifty-three of their brother tryoutees fell by the wayside.
Today belongs to these new members. Tomorrow they sink into
oblivion, scurrying around for news. So fill up the bumper and bump
one off to Stewart Crawford, Virginia Daugherty, Helen Sue Eyster, Karl
Falk, William French, Margaret Friedman, Francis Goodwin, Richard
Groves, Elizabeth Hewit, Rawson Holmes, Philip Humphreys, Martha
Inge, John Jernegan, Nancy Jones, Gordon Kelley, Leonard Kullman,
Ray Lindman, Bissell Magee, Mary Katherine Morris, Drew Pallctte,
Bernard Pollard, and Ruth Ross, and to Edward Peck, who was pro
moted to copy-editorship.
