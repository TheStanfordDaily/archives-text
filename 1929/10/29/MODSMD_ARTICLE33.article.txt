Street Scene, a Play in Three Acts,
by Elmer L. Rice. (Samuel
French, Publisher. New York.
1929.)
Street Scene, winner of the Pulitzer
Prize for 1929, is a very good, but not
a great play.
Its name comes from the unusual
device of using a New York street
scene as setting for the entire play.
This provides an excellent opportunity
for the inclusion of atmosphere—per
haps too much atmosphere. At any
rate, the major portion of the first
act, with its tiresome repetition of
"good evenin' " seems to be designed
in order that those members of the
audience who arrive late will miss
nothing of interest.
The almost wholly tragic plot is a
great improvement upon those of
most of the problem plays now in
fashion; but its katharsis is not quite
so strong as that of "Strange Inter
lude." It is, at any rate, an encourag
ing sign that Street Scene is enjoy
ing considerable popularity in the city
which gave vacuous "Abie's Irish
Rose" a five-year run.
The thing about Street Scene which
most greatly annoyed me is the use
of dialect and incorrect speech, though
no other course was possible in the
scene which Mr. Rice chose for his
play. I know of no great tragedy which
has successfully used such speech,
but it is possible that some genius of
the future may be able to infuse such
a medium with that dignity which is
essential in tragedy. Elmer Rice did
not.
"Well, you certainly never know,
when you get up in the mornin,' what
the day is gonna bring" can never
hope to compare in beauty or drama
with Sophocles' expression of the
same eternal truth.
The author has shown admirable re
straint in the intensely dramatic
scenes. He has also done well in his
avoidance of the use of one of the
characters for a mouthpiece of his
own ideas. Though he obviously agrees
with Kaplan's satire of:
"Organized cherity, measured and
iced,
In der name of a kushus, stetisti
cal Christ"

lie has made the same character re
cur with amusing frequency lo his
theories of oppression by the "Kepital
ists."
Street Scene remains, for me, one
of the best works of the time, a work
of unusual promise which has been
robbed of development to its highest
degree by slightly too much realism.

"THE LADY LIES," Varsity.
"The Lady Lies" is not a title that
excites much interest. Neither is a
box-office smash like Ramon Navarro
or Charles "Buddy" Rogers in the cast.
And yet the present offering at the
Varsity Theatre is as good an hour's
entertainment as anyone could find
for $8.80 in Broadway's best theatre.
Those that shake their heads and
painfully tell you they hate the talkies
will have to do a little re-hashing of
their arguments after seeing this one.
And those that start ringing up Red
wood or .San Jose in search of some
thing that SEEMS to be a little more
alluring will be passing up one of the
best products to come out of Cellu
loidia for a long time.
Intelligent and clever dialogue plus
a plot of riveting interest are some
of the merits of "The Lady Lies." The
cast is flawless. First, there is Walter
Huston. After thoroughly establishing
himself in "Gentlemen of the Press,"
he again contributes a masterful
characterization to the screen. Re
straint and intelligence mark his
every move.
Second, and still better, is Claudette
Colbert. Heretofore only known to
Broadwayites, she comes to the
screen as a triple-threat to the gum
chewing Hollywood queens with their
tin tonsils. Miss Colbert's voice alone
is worth your attention, without see
ing her charming person. But you
have both in "The Lady Lies," and
they are something not to be missed.
Charles Ruggles is very amusing.
Two youngsters, despite the super
precocity of their parts, are excellent.
They are" Patricia Deering and Tom
Brown. The whole list is goodj In a

picture. —J. T.

Street Scene, a Play in Three Acts,
by Elmer L. Rice. (Samuel
French, Publisher. New York.
1929.)
Street Scene, winner of the Pulitzer
Prize for 1929, is a very good, but not
a great play.
Its name comes from the unusual
device of using a New York street
scene as setting for the entire play.
This provides an excellent opportunity
for the inclusion of atmosphere—per
haps too much atmosphere. At any
rate, the major portion of the first
act, with its tiresome repetition of
"good evenin' " seems to be designed
in order that those members of the
audience who arrive late will miss
nothing of interest.
The almost wholly tragic plot is a
great improvement upon those of
most of the problem plays now in
fashion; but its katharsis is not quite
so strong as that of "Strange Inter
lude." It is, at any rate, an encourag
ing sign that Street Scene is enjoy
ing considerable popularity in the city
which gave vacuous "Abie's Irish
Rose" a five-year run.
The thing about Street Scene which
most greatly annoyed me is the use
of dialect and incorrect speech, though
no other course was possible in the
scene which Mr. Rice chose for his
play. I know of no great tragedy which
has successfully used such speech,
but it is possible that some genius of
the future may be able to infuse such
a medium with that dignity which is
essential in tragedy. Elmer Rice did
not.
"Well, you certainly never know,
when you get up in the mornin,' what
the day is gonna bring" can never
hope to compare in beauty or drama
with Sophocles' expression of the
same eternal truth.
The author has shown admirable re
straint in the intensely dramatic
scenes. He has also done well in his
avoidance of the use of one of the
characters for a mouthpiece of his
own ideas. Though he obviously agrees
with Kaplan's satire of:
"Organized cherity, measured and
iced,
In der name of a kushus, stetisti
cal Christ"

lie has made the same character re
cur with amusing frequency lo his
theories of oppression by the "Kepital
ists."
Street Scene remains, for me, one
of the best works of the time, a work
of unusual promise which has been
robbed of development to its highest
degree by slightly too much realism.

a medium with that dignity which is
essential in tragedy. Elmer Rice did
not.
"Well, you certainly never know,
when you get up in the mornin,' what
the day is gonna bring" can never
hope to compare in beauty or drama
with Sophocles' expression of the
same eternal truth.
The author has shown admirable re
straint in the intensely dramatic
scenes. He has also done well in his
avoidance of the use of one of the
characters for a mouthpiece of his
own ideas. Though he obviously agrees
with Kaplan's satire of:
"Organized cherity, measured and
iced,
In der name of a kushus, stetisti
cal Christ"

lie has made the same character re
cur with amusing frequency lo his
theories of oppression by the "Kepital
ists."
Street Scene remains, for me, one
of the best works of the time, a work
of unusual promise which has been
robbed of development to its highest
degree by slightly too much realism.

"THE LADY LIES," Varsity.
"The Lady Lies" is not a title that
excites much interest. Neither is a
box-office smash like Ramon Navarro
or Charles "Buddy" Rogers in the cast.
And yet the present offering at the
Varsity Theatre is as good an hour's
entertainment as anyone could find
for $8.80 in Broadway's best theatre.
Those that shake their heads and
painfully tell you they hate the talkies
will have to do a little re-hashing of
their arguments after seeing this one.
And those that start ringing up Red
wood or .San Jose in search of some
thing that SEEMS to be a little more
alluring will be passing up one of the
best products to come out of Cellu
loidia for a long time.
Intelligent and clever dialogue plus
a plot of riveting interest are some
of the merits of "The Lady Lies." The
cast is flawless. First, there is Walter
Huston. After thoroughly establishing
himself in "Gentlemen of the Press,"
he again contributes a masterful
characterization to the screen. Re
straint and intelligence mark his
every move.
Second, and still better, is Claudette
Colbert. Heretofore only known to
Broadwayites, she comes to the
screen as a triple-threat to the gum
chewing Hollywood queens with their
tin tonsils. Miss Colbert's voice alone
is worth your attention, without see
ing her charming person. But you
have both in "The Lady Lies," and
they are something not to be missed.
Charles Ruggles is very amusing.
Two youngsters, despite the super
precocity of their parts, are excellent.
They are" Patricia Deering and Tom
Brown. The whole list is goodj In a
word, we think this is a pretty good
picture. —J. T.
Street Scene, a Play in Three Acts,
by Elmer L. Rice. (Samuel
French, Publisher. New York.
1929.)
Street Scene, winner of the Pulitzer
Prize for 1929, is a very good, but not
a great play.
Its name comes from the unusual
device of using a New York street
scene as setting for the entire play.
This provides an excellent opportunity
for the inclusion of atmosphere—per
haps too much atmosphere. At any
rate, the major portion of the first
act, with its tiresome repetition of
"good evenin' " seems to be designed
in order that those members of the
audience who arrive late will miss
nothing of interest.
The almost wholly tragic plot is a
great improvement upon those of
most of the problem plays now in
fashion; but its katharsis is not quite
so strong as that of "Strange Inter
lude." It is, at any rate, an encourag
ing sign that Street Scene is enjoy
ing considerable popularity in the city
which gave vacuous "Abie's Irish
Rose" a five-year run.
The thing about Street Scene which
most greatly annoyed me is the use
of dialect and incorrect speech, though
no other course was possible in the
scene which Mr. Rice chose for his
play. I know of no great tragedy which
has successfully used such speech,
but it is possible that some genius of
the future may be able to infuse such
a medium with that dignity which is
essential in tragedy. Elmer Rice did
not.
"Well, you certainly never know,
when you get up in the mornin,' what
the day is gonna bring" can never
hope to compare in beauty or drama
with Sophocles' expression of the
same eternal truth.
