# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF OCTOBER 29, 1904 
### 
An editorial: "In reference to the
editorial which appeared in the Daily
Californian of October 25th, charging
Stanford with buying athletes, and re
ferring particularly to the case of E.
C. Cope, '08, we wish to say that we
do not believe that any number of
California's students are in sympathy
with the sentiments expressed. We
believe that the student body of Cali
fornia holds the Stanford student body
and its officers in higher esteem than
the editorial would indicate. It is very
unfortunate that statements of this
nature should be made when there is
no reasonable ground whatever upon
which to base them."
All the rooters' tickets to the Cali
fornia game were gone a few hours
after they were placed on sale.
The clock in the tower on the Me
morial Church, which had not been
keeping time for several days, was
repaired.
In an address to the Y.M.C.A., Dr.

Jordan emphasized the "religion of
doing, as distinct from the religion of
feeling, of ceremonials." He admon
ished the organization against any
tendency to boorishness by tiresome
personal solicitation.
The Mandolin Club announced that
as a result of its tryouts, eighteen
members would be added.
An announcement read: "Kappa
Alpha Theta. —At home Saturday, No
vember stli, instead of October 29th,
from 8 to 11, 15 Lasuen street."
Commander C. T. B. Moore, U.S.N.,
addressed a University Assembly on
"The Navy—lts Organization and
Achievements."
"The sailor is a peculiar sort of
chap, a mixture of the barbarian and
the poet," said Commander Moore.
"When a sailor gets shore leave he
usually is unacquainted and is lone
some, so he picks up the only com
panions who are obtainable and has a
good time."
