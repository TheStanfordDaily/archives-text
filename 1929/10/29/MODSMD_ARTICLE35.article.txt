Professor Walter W. Wegner of the
civil engineering department, and F.
D. Banham of Palo Alto, together with
the latter's nine-year-old son, were
rocked to sleep Sunday night in the
Redwood Slough aboard Wegner's 32-
foot sloop. Meanwhile frenzied friends
and relatives were organizing search
parties to find traces of those who
they supposed had gone down to the
sea in their ship.
The amateur sailors were returning
from Hunter's Point, where they had
gone for the week-end, and were due
at Palo Alto harbor Sunday afternoon.
Beating against a strong wind and an
outgoing tide, they decided that there
wasn't enough clearing to get into
Palo Alto. Early in the afternoon they
had been sighted by J. F. Bixbee, be
fore they had turned into Redwood
Slough. They expected Bixbee to take
home word of their whereabouts, but
the latter had not seen them turn into
the slough.
Early yesterday morning the lost
mainers sailed nonchalantly into port,
entirely oblivious of the Btir caused
by their delayed arrival.
