# FRESHMAN FOOTBALL TEAM PREPARES FOR CONTEST WITH SAINTS
## 
### 
With a 19 to 0 victory over tlie
U.C.L.A. frosli to their credit, the
Stanford freshman gridders are now
working hard for their game with the
St. Mary's yearlings to be played here
next Saturday. The Saints have an
exceptionally strong team this year
and number among their 1929 victims
the California first-year men.
Against the Bruins from Los An
geles, the Stanford offense, which had
been notably weak all season, showed
a decided improvement. Afflerbaugh
had good interference on his end runs,
enabling him to make some substan
tial gains, and Stevens showed to ad
vantage at hitting the line.
The Cards failed to show much in
the way of an aerial attack, but never
had any real need of one. Coach
"Husky" Hunt will undoubtedly drill
his team on the overhead game this
week as the baby Redshirts will prob
ably need it against the Saints.
Two substitute backs, Palmer and
Hancock, looked good in the Bruin
contest. The former made some nice
gains around the flanks, while Han
cock is no mean line-plunger. Bill Art
man, the large lad who plays right
tackle, has developed into the best
defensive lineman on the Card squad.
Coach Hunt made no mistake by
changing this boy from quarterback
to tackle.
