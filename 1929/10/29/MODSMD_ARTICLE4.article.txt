The Abb 6 was a pupil of the famous
French poet and critic, Angellier. He
early became interested in English
literature and began writing for Lon

as soon as he completed his last aca
demic degrees. He has been writing
for American reviews, including the
"Outlook," the "Atlantic Montrly,"
and "Harper's Magazine."
