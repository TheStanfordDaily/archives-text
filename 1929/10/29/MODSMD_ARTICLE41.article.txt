# University Press Building To Be Ready By Christmas
## 
### 
So steadily has work progressed on
the new University Press building
being built in the Corporation Yard
that the structure is about half com
pleted, Foreman J. R. Leaver declared
yesterday.
All the steel framework for the
building has been erected, Leaver
said, and at least half of the concrete
has been poured. Work at present is
concentrated on the roof sheathing,
more than fifty per cent of which is
now in place. The roof will be covered
with broken red tiling as are the
roofs of other campus buildings.
Christmas is the approximate date
set for completion of the work.
