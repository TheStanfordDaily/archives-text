Although the resounding plaudits
have died down to a mere nothing, the
amateur speculators iiavo paid off a
few of their outstanding 1.0.U.'5, and
the students of fair Stanford have
dried away copious tear-drops, the
89,000-odd cash customers who jam
med (lie big howl to overflowing last
Saturday are still wondering what
kind of an athletic contest was pulled
off on them.
For it did seem as though some
new sort of a game was played
on the fatal 26th. Not that the
spectacle didn't bear a slight re
semblance to football. Not that
twenty-two men weren't swapping
lusty blows for a full sixty min
utes on a regulation-sized grid
iron. Yet, the like of it was never
before witnessed in Pacific Coast
pigskin circles.
The two teams, cracked up to be
the best in the West, looked as though
they were out on the field fighting
their darnedest to win the game—for
the other side. It is true that the
players were giving their best at all
times. The only trouble was that they
gave too freely.
U.S.C. was big-hearted enough, and
gave the Cards plenty plus twenty
times over. However, the big white
jersey boys were a little too good at
ignoring tho breaks of the game, and
thereby realized their sole aim by re
fusing to win.
This old stuff of tossing away
championships without a murmur
is of late getting to be quite a
habit of Pop's lads. Last year
Stanford established this reputa
tion down in the sun-sizzled Coli
seum, and last Saturday she lived
up to it by doing the Trojans an
annual good turn. It won't be long
now before the sports critics
change the name of Cardinals to
that of Boy Scouts.
Nearly everyone will admit that the
Trojans were by far the best team
and deserved to come out on top.
They passed better, they punted bet
ter, they ran better, they clipped bet
ter, and they stopped their men better.
In fact, there was not a single depart
ment in which Coach Jones' men did
not outplay the Redshirts.
Yet, the circumstances as they
were, Stanford should have tallied
at least seven points, and the
Cards should have gone home to
supper that night with no worse
than a tie score. Stanford got
enough breaks and chances to
win three or four ordinary games.
However, Saturday's clash was
extraordinary, and the Cardinals
failed to cash in on any of their
numerous opportunities.
Individually, tho Cards were not so
bad, but as a team they put up a
sloppy exhibition. The interference
was as good as nothing most of the
time, the tackling was ragged, the
players seemed to lack their usual
pep, the forward passing was terrible,
and the signal-calling bordered on
hallucinations. Why Stanford ever
spent last week working out behind
barred fences is a great mystery! The
team showed absolutely nothing new
in the way of plays, and at the same
time failed to use some of their best
old ones.
Stanford was just plain out-foxed!
The Redshirts' only remaining title
chances are very slim indeed. If Cal
can only upset the Trojans! While
this is not at all impossible, it is safe
to bet one's last thin dime that U.S.C.
will not be passing out many free
breaks again this coming week-end.
W T hat Cal gets, she will earn, and this
will probably not be any great amount.
So the Cards had better not
waste any time sitting around on
any false hopes, but instead get
down to real work and rebuild
their fortunes by neatly trimming
U.C. and the Army!
