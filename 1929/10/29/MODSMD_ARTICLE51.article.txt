# ASININE INTERFERER RUINS HOCKEY TILT
## 
### 
A four-legged goalkeeper proved too
: much for the Senior Women's attack,
; and saved the day for the Junior
Hockey team in yesterday's practice.
Playing short in the backfield, the
; Juniors were hard pressed to defend
their goal at the end of the period,
| when a sturdy donkey marched in
! front of the goal posts and faced the
onrushing Seniors.
Confronted with such formidable
opposition the Seniors wavered, and
the game was called with the score
; still a tie.
The timely addition to the team
; was led off the field to the cheers of
' the grateful Juniors.
