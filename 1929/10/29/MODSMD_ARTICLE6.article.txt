# TRAFFIC CONGESTION REMEDIES DISCUSSED BY PALO ALTO GROUP
## 
### 
Discussion of last Saturday's traffic
congestion and methods of preventing
a recurrence was the object of a joint
meeting of the Palo Alto Board of
Public Safety and the Board of Public
Works last night in Palo Alto. Comp
troller Almon E. Roth was present.
The narrow bridge across San
Francisquito Creek and lack of high
way control around Redwood City and
San Mateo were the chief causes of
blocking of traffic. The Stanford
B.A.C. will co-operate with the high
way commission in respect to this.
An effort to open up and widen
traffic routes in and around Palo Alto
and Mayfield will be made in time for
the Big Game. A resolution was
passed at the meeting instructing
C. H. Steer, chairman of the highway
commission, to solicit the completion
of the Bayshore Highway to Palo Alto
as soon as possible.
