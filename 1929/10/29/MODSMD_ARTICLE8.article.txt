# CONCENTRATION IS FOCUSING OF ATTENTION, SAYS ABBE DIMNET; THINKING FOLLOWS
## Author of "Art of Thinking" To Deliver His Second Lecture Tonight 
### Allan Hart 
"Concentration is the halting of the
stream of consciousness, the focusing
of attention," Abb 6 Ernest Dimnet
was explaining. "And when concen
tration comes, thinking follows inevi
tably. Of course you can't force your
self too much to concentrate; you
can't do it in too brutal a manner —
you'll spoil it all."
That Abb 6 Dimnet, author of that
remarkable little book, "The Art of
Thinking," is one of those thinkers
whose every word is worth listening
to becomes apparent in even a few
minutes of conversation. Thinking
with him is as much a habit as
"wool-gathering" is with most of the
rest of humanity; it is a delight to
watch how easily it is clone.
Took Many Notes
"When I was a young man, lik§ you
college students now, I was writing—
writing, all the time. And as I wrote,
I watched and took notes on how my
mind was working. That is what my
book is—those notes."
Abb 6 Dimnet pointed out that there
was no bibliography attached to "The
Art of Thinking."
"It was just my own experiences
that I could tell about," he explained.
"To quote another —that would spoil
it."
Anyone who travels about the coun
try giving several lectures a week,
and at the same time writing maga
zine articles, is a busy man. This is
what the Abb 6 does. Asked if so many
lectures did not make it difficult to
avoid stereotyped thinking, he ex
plained that he has with him several
skeleton forms for every lecture, and
more than sixty sets of notes to fill
them in. Even then, of course, he fol
lows notes only roughly—to stimulate
relevant thought rather than to out
line what he is going to say.
Each Lecture Is Adventure
"Every lecture is an adventure to
me," the Abb 6 explained with enthu
siasm.
Difficult as it may seem, this
French psychologist-writer thinks out
his subject matter anew for each lec
ture.
"If I didn't," he says,"the audience
might be satisfied, but I would go
away discontent."
Don't use over and over again an
idea or conclusion that you have
thought out; don't rest on your laurels
once you have thought a thing
through to its conclusion, but think
it out still farther —this is the advice
of Dimnet.
Abb 6 Dimnet had used the term
"will-power" in his lecture. He ex
plained that his use was only in the
popular sense, not the philosophical.
"Like evil," he said, "there is no
solution to the problem of freedom.
It is too much for man's mind."
As the French man stepped out of
the door for a short walk, he re
marked:
"Your American architects do these
things so well. Every building is
adapted to its surroundings. I often
wish our French architects could
come over and see."
