"It's
always fair
weather . .
If YOUR wardrobe includes
a real Fish Brand Slicker it's
fair weather for you, rain or
shine. However hard it storms
you can go about as usual,
snug and dry. Trips to the
drug store, to the movies, and
—oh, yes—to classes, can be
made in comfort.
Genuine Fish Brand Slick
ers, either in the long, roomy
"Varsity" model, or the smart
new "Topper"—can be bought
at good stores everywhere.
You don't have to pay a bit
more for a Fish Brand Slicker,
"The Rainy Day Pal." A. J.
Tower Company, Boston, Mass.
