# AIR LINER LOST IN STORM LANDS AT ALBUQUERQUE
## Pilot of Missing Plane Made Forced Landing; Long Walk Prevented Communication Astonishment Is Expressed by Passengers When Told of Plans for Large Search 
### 
ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Oct. 29. (yP)
—Five men, ruddy-cheeked from a 34-
liour exposure to the first real snow
storm New Mexico has felt this sea
son, landed at the Western Air Ex
press airport this afternoon in the
plane that had been declared missing
by officials. Extensive searching par
ties were ordered discontinued.
All were surprised that such a wide
search had been instituted in their
behalf.
"We did the only thing there was
to do," said Pilot James Doles. "We
ran into a raging snowstorm, so we
landed, coming down about five miles
from Trechado, N.M. As soon as the
storm abated, we flew on into Albu
querque."
Too Long a Walk
Asked if he had not thought of tele
phoning the whereabouts of his plane,
Pilot Doles admitted he had not con
sidered walking 45 miles to the near
est phone, even to relieve officials
of worry.
Taking to the air again this after
noon, Pilot Doles flew his plane into
Albuquerque in about an hour.
"There was a deserted cabin near
the place where we landed," said the
pilot, "so we took seat covers from
the plane to use as covers and went
over there at sundown to spend the
night."
Food Consumed
Allan C. Barrie, co-pilot of the
plane, started out early this morning
In search of a telephone and food.
The small amount of food on the
plane had been consumed by the five
hungry men Monday night.
W. E. Merz, passenger on the plane,
did not seem to think the forced land
ing was out of the ordinary. "I have
flown in France, Germany, India, and
other countries and I see nothing to
get alarmed about when a plane is
overdue or has to make a forced land
ing. This is the first forced landing
I ever was in, but I have flown
enough to know that it is nothing out
of the ordinary.

ALBUQUERQUE, N.M., Oct. 29. (yP)
—Five men, ruddy-cheeked from a 34-
liour exposure to the first real snow
storm New Mexico has felt this sea
son, landed at the Western Air Ex
press airport this afternoon in the
plane that had been declared missing
by officials. Extensive searching par
ties were ordered discontinued.
All were surprised that such a wide
search had been instituted in their
behalf.
"We did the only thing there was
to do," said Pilot James Doles. "We
ran into a raging snowstorm, so we
landed, coming down about five miles
from Trechado, N.M. As soon as the
storm abated, we flew on into Albu
querque."
Too Long a Walk
Asked if he had not thought of tele
phoning the whereabouts of his plane,
Pilot Doles admitted he had not con
sidered walking 45 miles to the near
est phone, even to relieve officials
of worry.
Taking to the air again this after
noon, Pilot Doles flew his plane into
Albuquerque in about an hour.
"There was a deserted cabin near
the place where we landed," said the
pilot, "so we took seat covers from
the plane to use as covers and went
over there at sundown to spend the
night."
Food Consumed
Allan C. Barrie, co-pilot of the
plane, started out early this morning
In search of a telephone and food.
The small amount of food on the
plane had been consumed by the five
hungry men Monday night.
W. E. Merz, passenger on the plane,
did not seem to think the forced land
ing was out of the ordinary. "I have
flown in France, Germany, India, and
other countries and I see nothing to
get alarmed about when a plane is
overdue or has to make a forced land
ing. This is the first forced landing
I ever was in, but I have flown
enough to know that it is nothing out
of the ordinary.
