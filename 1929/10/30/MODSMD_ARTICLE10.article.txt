### Elisabeth Larsh 
With "The Ivory Door" advanced
| as far as the dress rehearsal stage,
| the property staff has had to meet
! several peculiar difficulties which
! have arisen as finishing touches to
j the play.
Most troublesome to the "prop
i crew" was the problem of a gong with
j exactly the proper tone. During the
j first scene of the second act, Princess
j Lilia, the betrothed of King Perivale,
makes a magnificent entry into the
! court of her new subjects, and i3 wel
comed by the ringing of gongs.
Failing to find a satisfactory gong,
various makeshifts were devised by
the members of the class in theatrical
workshop. Pieces of pipe, scraps of
iron, brass, and other metals were

| tested. Each was struck with different
kinds of metal in different positions,
straight and bent. Still the property
crew was not satisfied.
Late one evening Walt Newcomb,
property manager, returned triumph
ant from a tour of junk yards on the
Peninsula. Several automobile brake
drums were hung by ropes from a
bamboo pole and struck by a piece of
one-inch pipe with a ball on the end
j of it. The tones were perfect.
Other problems were the securing
of information concerning thirteenth
! century sausages, in which case the
Stanford Museum saved the day with
authentic information. Italian bread
lories like Rood o'd thirteenth
century bread has already been se
cured for Friday's performance.
