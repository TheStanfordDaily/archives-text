# FRENCH UNABLE TO FILL BRIAND POST
## Dissension in Radical Group Prevents Formation of Coalition Cabinet 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 29. (/P) â€”France today
entered its second week minus the
services of a ministry, and apparently
as far removed from one as on last
Tuesday when M. Aristide Briand and
his colleagues presented their resigna
tions to President Doumergue.
Sunday's hopeful indications of a
revival of the "Cartel des Gauches"
(coalition of the left) faded Monday
and today were reduced to practically
nil, when the French socialists,
through their national council, today
refused to join the radical-socialists,
in forming a new government.
Edouard Daladier, who has been at
tempting to form a cabinet for three
days, announced after a midnight con
ference with friends of the radical
socialist party that he would inform
President Domergue at 9 a.m. that he
declined to continue his efforts.
