Madame de Noailles creates art from
simple everyday impressions written
with a charming and delicate touch.
We feel poetry all the time but are
afraid to express ourselves because a
poetic state of mind makes use of
other adjectives than those most gen
erally used in the average vocabulary,
believes the Abb 6. Music doe 3 not
require this type of expression and is
therefore not affected by this preju
dice. It is not playing the game to
analyze poetry or to demand that it be
expressed wtih mathematical preci
sion.

Madame de Noailles is eminently a
Parisian woman. She traveled a short
while in the Orient, but the effect
on her poetry appears mainly in her
titles and has no great importance.
Her work is influenced by the har
mony of the eighteenth and nineteenth
century and also by the modern fluid
ity of poetic language.
