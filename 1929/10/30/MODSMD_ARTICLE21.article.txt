# MILES SHOWS THAT EYES ARE NOT AT REST DURING HOURS OF SLEEP
## 
### 
"I slept ten hours last night. Why
should my eyes be tired?" Because,
fair co-ed, your eyes work when you
are asleep.
In discussing his research on the
state of the eye in sleep Professor
\V. R. Miles of the Psychology Depart
ment stated yesterday, "Sleep has al
ways been thought of as a cessation
of muscular activity in the eye, but it
seems that we must change our ideas
and consider it as involving positive
activity."
When the eyelid closes there is a
definite puckering of the muscle sur
rounding the eye, not relaxation. Simi
larly, the rolling up of the eye into
the head involves muscular activity.
That this is true is proved by the
state of the eye soon after death when

tit, is completely relaxed; the eye is!
: half open with the iris in norma! posi-1
j tion.
Last of these findings is the fact;
i that the pupil closes up in sleep. In
I the waking state the pupil contracts j
in the light and dilates in the dark.!
j Contrary to this is the contraction of |
j the pupil when it is turned back in
the head and receiving no light.
Having determined that these are j
positive actions which do not occur
! in the waking state, psychologists are j
{ now wondering if there is an analo
| gous set of positive muscular move
ments in the other sensory organs. Is
the eye the only organ having positive
! activities in sleep or are these activi
ties indicative of processes in the
'other senses?
