# WARNER TO SEE CALIFORNIA PLAY U.S.C. SATURDAY
## Thornhill Will Have Charge Of Caltech Game; Varsity Expected to Rest Saturday Husky Tilt Appears as Next Important Contest; To Be Played in Seattle Stadium 
### 
Back to the old grind for the firßt
time this week, the Stanford varßity
will begin preparing this afternoon for
the Cal-tech game this Saturday. Yes
terday's practice session, which was
still of the secret variety, was limited
to a lengthy chalk talk by Coach Pop
Warner.
The Cardinals' real concentration
from now on will be on the Wash
ington clash a week from Saturday,
as the Huskies are always a tough
team to beat on their own Seattle
mud-splashed gridiron. At the same
time it is expected that the Redstarts
will have an easy time taking the
southern team in stride.
Caltech Not Outstanding
So far this season the Caltech bovs
have not shown much either offens
ively or defensively. In fact, they
have only won one game to date and
even failed to shove over a single
touchdown in any other of their con
tests.
In all probabilities Tiny Thornhill,
line coach, will have charge of the
Stanford squad during this week-end's
fray, as Pop and Chuck Winterburn,
assistant backfield coach, are plan
ning to go South to witness the Cal-
U.S.C. battle. It will be Coach War
ner's only chance to scout the Bears
this year, two hard games coming in
succession before the annual Big
Game.
Although all of the regulars, includ
ing the men injured in the Trojan en
counter, should be ready to see action
Saturday, a team composed of substi
tutes is more than likely to start
against Caltech and the first-string
players may not even get into the
game.
