# GOOD, SOUND ADVICE
## 
### 
Most Daily readers enjoyed a hearty laugh yesterday in perusing the
good, sound advice given Stanford co-eds by the Women's Council in
its letter to the various living groups.
Undoubtedly the Women's Council was acting for the best interests
of the 500 in broadcasting such helpful hints as that of calling Miss Yost
in case of difficulty and that of taking along a five dollar bill in case of
emergency. But the idea of giving such advice to theoretically mature
women of the 20th Century is at the outset extremely funny.
There is something more than humor in the situation, however. There
are, according to well authenticated reports, enough 16-year-olds in this
University to create a real problem and to cause a need for retailing such
bits of common sense paternalism.
From a purely academic point of view, there can be no doubt of the
soundness of this University's policy of admitting students on the
strength of their membership in that select organization, The Thousand
Geniuses. The difficulty is that so many of these intellectual giants are
utterly youthful and are perhaps unable to care for themselves.
Just because these 16-year-olds have been admitted doesn't mean that
all Stanford women, regardless of age and experience, should be governed
by regulations designed to be a helping hand to juveniles.
