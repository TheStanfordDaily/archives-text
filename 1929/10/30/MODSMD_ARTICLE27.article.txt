# UNITED EFFORTS ARE STRONG

Widening of the state highway will make it necessary to remove the
remnants of the original Stanford Gate to Palm Drive, and Comptroller
Almon E. Roth has announced that the University will replace it with a
wider, more attractive entrance. Following the lead of Palo Alto, which
has its beautification project half completed, the University will probably
make a plaza entrance similar to the one on the opposite side of the
highway.
This broadening of the principal artery and the intersecting drive will
be accomplished through the combined agencies of the state, Palo Alto,
and the University. It will make this dangerous intersection considerably
more safe when the entire program is completed next summer. There is
one more thing that the same three can co-operate on: that of installing
an electric traffic regulator at the new intersection. The resulting combi
nation of beauty and safety will be a credit to the community.
