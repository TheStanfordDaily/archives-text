Sound advice on how to select dates for West Point Cadets as found
in the Daily Illini. Reception Committee for Army Game on December 28
please note.
Forty-five girls are to be selected to attend the dinner dance
given in honor of the Army football squad. We don't know who
these girls will be or who makes the selection. But our fervent
prayer is that they will be hand-picked-
Just what the standard of selection will be is mystery to the
public. It may be a reward for earnest endeavor. That would be
terrible. It may be based on the personal liking of the committee.
That would be worse. It may be based on no good reason at all.
This last seems the most probable. If any of these is the case, right
now we can visualize the general effect of the ensemble, and it's
extra bad.
The only basis for selection should be —get this now—good
looks and plenty of them. What does a bunch of tired football
players care about the worthy record of an Illinois co-ed ? Besides,
if she were too intellectual, she might want to talk about her work
or something and everyone knows what a disastrous effect that will
have on any date. Just so the girl is restful to the eyes and can coo
"I just think the Army's wonderful" every five minutes—these are
the essentials. We say —pick 'em beautiful and dumb. —The Daily
Illini.
