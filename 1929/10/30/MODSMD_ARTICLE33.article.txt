"CUP OF GOLD," by John Steinbeck.
Robert M. Mcßride and Company,
1929.
There were once two Steinbecks,
eousins. One of them came to Stan
ford and became President of the stu
dent body. The other came to Stan
ford and became a novelist.
"Cup of Gold," by John Steinbeck,
is a fanciful, rather weird, and some
times historical novel concerning the
life of one Henry Morgan, buccaneer,
pirate, and member of the "Brother
hood" that caused so much trouble to
Spain's power on the seas during the
sixteenth century. And Henry is the
whole show. We see him first as a boy
of fifteen, dreaming of life beyond the
seas and eternally yearning for the
wild adventurous life of men who did
things. We leave him just as death is
coming, and all the terrible deeds of
his past life are passing by in bewil
dering confusion.'
"Cup of Gold" is the picture of a
dreamer —of a dreamer who eternally
searched for some ephemeral happi
ness. Cities and countries richer than
man ever dreamed of, fell before his
armies. He had women, gold, ships,
and power. But peace was not there
and Henry Morgan was a lost soul
looking for something he could never
find. And thus he died.

All novelists have some Bort of a
philosophy and John Steinbeck is no
j exception. Says he, "All the world's
j great have been little boys who
, wanted the moon; running and clirub
! ing, Ihey sometimes caught a firefly,
j But if one grow to a man's mind, that
| mind must see that it cannot have
the moon and would not want it if it
j could —and so it catches no firetlies."
It is not the plot in "Cup of Gold"
i that makes the book interesting, for
there have been many such plots. And
I it is not the characters, for there have
: been many such in the minds of all
writers. It is the vivid, complete, and
i truly introspective picture of Henry
] Morgan's life and character that make
i the book a thing to be remembered,
iAs one reads the book he feel 3 as
j though he had experienced the same
I things in his own life. If you ever left
the place in which you grew up, then
you know how Henry felt that wintry
morning he bid goodbye to the valleys
of Cambria.
John Steinbeck is a Stanford man,
; a member of the class of *24. Since
[ leaving school he has spent his time

! writing things when time allowed.
"Cup of Gold" is his first attempt in
the field of novel-writing.

"CUP OF GOLD," by John Steinbeck.
Robert M. Mcßride and Company,
1929.
There were once two Steinbecks,
eousins. One of them came to Stan
ford and became President of the stu
dent body. The other came to Stan
ford and became a novelist.
"Cup of Gold," by John Steinbeck,
is a fanciful, rather weird, and some
times historical novel concerning the
life of one Henry Morgan, buccaneer,
pirate, and member of the "Brother
hood" that caused so much trouble to
Spain's power on the seas during the
sixteenth century. And Henry is the
whole show. We see him first as a boy
of fifteen, dreaming of life beyond the
seas and eternally yearning for the
wild adventurous life of men who did
things. We leave him just as death is
coming, and all the terrible deeds of
his past life are passing by in bewil
dering confusion.'
"Cup of Gold" is the picture of a
dreamer —of a dreamer who eternally
searched for some ephemeral happi
ness. Cities and countries richer than
man ever dreamed of, fell before his
armies. He had women, gold, ships,
and power. But peace was not there
and Henry Morgan was a lost soul
looking for something he could never
find. And thus he died.

All novelists have some Bort of a
philosophy and John Steinbeck is no
j exception. Says he, "All the world's
j great have been little boys who
, wanted the moon; running and clirub
! ing, Ihey sometimes caught a firefly,
j But if one grow to a man's mind, that
| mind must see that it cannot have
the moon and would not want it if it
j could —and so it catches no firetlies."
