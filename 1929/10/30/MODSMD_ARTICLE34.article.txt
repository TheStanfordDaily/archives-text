The Editor, Sir:
Let us consider facts as to Public j
Exercises at Stanford. To quote a re-!
cent bulletin "Concerning Stanford," !
"since the foundation of the Univer- !
sity there has existed at Stanford a j
life apart from curriculum But
it must have an environment and must
be maintained."
This University life is comprehen
sive, and apparently it interests a con
siderable body of persons. For exam
ple, in the past seven years there
have been nearly 300 Tuesday evening
meetings. There have been sixty-five
assemblies, and innumerable recitals
and concerts. Three outstanding
events of each University year, the
Matriculation Service, Founders' Day
observance, and Commencement, have
been held in the Memorial Church. I
Occasionally for the Tuesday evening !
meetings there have been audiences
of less than 100. Usually they range
from 300 to 800, but again and again
there have been 1000 or more.
We have heard under University'
auspices such outstanding public fig
ures as James Harvey Robinson, Ad
miral Sims, Alexander Meiklejohn,

Mary E. Wolley, Edwin E. Slosson,
Bernard Fay, David F. Houston, Al
bert Mansbridge, Elizabeth Drew, Ed
ward Devine, Lillian Gilbreth, Julius <
Barnes, Louis Untermeyer, David P.
Barrows, Sir Bernard Pares, Chang |
Po-Ling, and William Allen White.
Except for the events in the Church,
we have heard these men and women
in the Little Theatre (seating capacity
260) or in the Assembly Hall (seating J
capacity 1600), and several times we ;
have been forced to go to the Basket- i
ball Pavilion.
Obviously it is real life here repre- '
sented, an important part of the |
activity of a university devoted to j
intellectual and artistic interests. The
University has led the way; it has
provided, year by year, more and ;
more support for these programs, but i
the setting has not been adequate. It
has been inadequate. We need very
much a hall seating 500 and another
that will comfortably seat 1000, and
of course we do need a new theatre.
Sincerely yours,
Edgar E. Robinson,
Chairman Comittee on Public
Exercises.

Except for the events in the Church,
we have heard these men and women
in the Little Theatre (seating capacity
260) or in the Assembly Hall (seating J
capacity 1600), and several times we ;
have been forced to go to the Basket- i
ball Pavilion.
Obviously it is real life here repre- '
sented, an important part of the |
activity of a university devoted to j
intellectual and artistic interests. The
University has led the way; it has
provided, year by year, more and ;
more support for these programs, but i
the setting has not been adequate. It
has been inadequate. We need very
much a hall seating 500 and another
that will comfortably seat 1000, and
of course we do need a new theatre.
Sincerely yours,
Edgar E. Robinson,
Chairman Comittee on Public
Exercises.

The Editor, Sir:
Let us consider facts as to Public j
Exercises at Stanford. To quote a re-!
cent bulletin "Concerning Stanford," !
"since the foundation of the Univer- !
sity there has existed at Stanford a j
life apart from curriculum But
it must have an environment and must
be maintained."
This University life is comprehen
sive, and apparently it interests a con
siderable body of persons. For exam
ple, in the past seven years there
have been nearly 300 Tuesday evening
meetings. There have been sixty-five
assemblies, and innumerable recitals
and concerts. Three outstanding
events of each University year, the
Matriculation Service, Founders' Day
observance, and Commencement, have
been held in the Memorial Church. I
Occasionally for the Tuesday evening !
meetings there have been audiences
of less than 100. Usually they range
from 300 to 800, but again and again
there have been 1000 or more.
We have heard under University'
auspices such outstanding public fig
ures as James Harvey Robinson, Ad
miral Sims, Alexander Meiklejohn,

Mary E. Wolley, Edwin E. Slosson,
Bernard Fay, David F. Houston, Al
bert Mansbridge, Elizabeth Drew, Ed
ward Devine, Lillian Gilbreth, Julius <
