# CONDUCT BECOMING STANFORD GENTLEMEN?
## 
### 
I have heard some language used
at the Stanford-U.S.C. game Saturday
for which the ones using it could be
criminally prosecuted.
This is all the more inexcusable be
cause many of the men indulging in
profanity and obscene language were
students. I was not aware that stu
dents in a University such as Stan
ford could be so utterly plebian in
their conduct. There are students who
are as rude in their behaviour.
I believe that this protest applies
principally to the undergraduate
classes. I hope that students in the
graduate schools are not so moronic
in their character as to have this
charge grounded against them.
A football stadium is a public place,
and a place where patrons go to have
a good time and not be insulted with
indecent remarks.

I hear that there is a strong sense
of rivalry between the University of
Southern California and Stanford.
Even though this is true, that does
not constitute a reason why a student
should indulge in vile language where
a large body of men and women are
assembled together. There is all the
more reason to be civil, when a foot
ball game involves no more than a
display of clean sportsmanship. And
I don't believe Southern California
violated that spirit. The evidence was
all the other way.
The environment around Stanford is
of such a nature that it ought to breed
good conduct at least among the stu
dent body. Attention should be brought
to the fact that university institutions
are extending their privileges to peo
ple of high moral calibre, and Dot to
roughnecks. —'31 Law.
