# SIDELINE LANTS...
## LEST WE FORGET 
### 
Now that those awrul memories of
the 26th have been forgotten to some
small extent and Stanford's misplays
have been hashed, re-hashed, and
worn out so that even Mose wouldn't
accept the remnants for the mere ask
ing, some of the unadulterated bleach
er coaches and non-subsidized college
students who hang around these parts
are beginning to wake up to the fact
that a few of the individual Redshirta
showed up well during the afternoon's
matinee.
There was some mighty fine act
ing in that one-scene farce!
Of course, tho southern troupers
were in the limelight most of the
time, and a couple of them actually
turned out to be the head men of the
show. And it was a short and snappy
skit presented by Messers. Duffield
and Tappaan that brought down the
house.
Even the most Cardinal-minded
fans squatting away up in the press
men's nigger-heaven were forced to
clap their hands a bit. The Stanford
tumblers (meaning those white-clad
boys that bumped into each other from
time to time and fell down on the
turf without as much as one solitary
Trojan laying a finger on them) didn't
recoive half as much applause.
Yet, the players from Troy
failed to give an encore! Not that
they could have done so, even if
they had so desired. And the rea
son why the Trojans were held to
seven tallies was the playing of
some half-dozen Stanford men.
Although most of the Cards used
themselves to good advantage now
and then, there were only about six
aces in the pack. Captain Muller was
hounded too closely on offense to
really show much and thus be classed
as one of the latter. He played a fair
game at end, aH right, but Tappaan
and Arbelbide were a pair of trumps
when compared to Mr. Muller.
It remained for three other stal
warts to stand out in the forward wall.
Walt Heinecke at center, Ray Tandy
at tackle, and Phil Neill at end. No
Trojan linesmen outplayed this trio
on either offense or defense!
Take Heinecke at the pivot position
for instance. Playing just opposite
him was a huge bulk with plenty of
fire and pep. But the small-sized Stan
ford man refused to take anything
from the beefy Southerner. Quite to
the contrary, he took great jyy in
giving Mr. Troy a rather severe
osteopathic treatment.
Heinecke's defensive work once
again stamped him as the logical
choice for all-Coast, if not all-
American center. Several times
he made tackles on what looked
like certain* touchdown runs. It
appeared from time to time that
he must have been the safety man.
Then there was Tandy. The Trojans,
it is said, riddled holes in the Stan
ford line every once in a while. Yet,
not once was Mr. Tandy bowled over.
If the rest of the forward wall had
stood its ground as well, there would
have been no riddling at all.
And Phil Neill at end. Playing
the first "big" game of his career,
the latter proved that he is de
veloping into one of the best ends
on the Coast. Although lacking in
avoirdupois, Neill was about the
only one on the Cardinal squad
to stand up under the Trojans'
hard-smashing interference. All
the tall tow-headed lad needs is a
little more experience.
The other three outstanding players
wore backfield men, and strange as
It may seem displayed their wares
from half-back positions. They were
namely, Bill Clark, Lud Frentrup, and
Phil Moffatt. Everyone who saw the
game knows how well they packed tho
pigskin, besides dumping their men
with regularity on defense.
The best part about it all is that
five of these aces will be with the
Cards next fall. And with the
other men on the squad develop
ing plus a number of good gradu
ates from the frosh and gray
teams, it seems that Stanford
need not be downhearted about
her chances in the near future.
