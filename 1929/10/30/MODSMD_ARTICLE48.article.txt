# ELLINGTON ANNOUNCES MURAL FOOTBALL TO START NEXT MONDAY
## 
### 
Bill Ellington announced last night,
that due to the large number of in
quiries regarding intramural touch
football, a list will be posted In the
gym today, and all organizations de
siring to enter teams for this sport
should sign up. The entry list will re
main open until Friday night, and if
sufficient teams have entered at that
time, drawings will be made over the
week-end and play will begin next
Monday, November 4.
Due to the shortness of time left
in the quarter, play in intramural
touch football must begin next week
if at all, for the sport calendar is a
crowded one. Some suitable trophy,
possibly a silver cup, will be selected
for the winner of this sport, but the
award will not be a plaque.
