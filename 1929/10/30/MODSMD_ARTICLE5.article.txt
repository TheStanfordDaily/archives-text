## 
### 
Bill Worthington's Del Monte Band
will play at the Sophomore Cotillion
on November 9, according to an an
nouncement by Art Katsev, general
cotillion chairman.
Decorations, which are being
planned by Carl Cartwright, class
president, for the dance will carry out
a "railroad idea." The interior of the
Pavilion will be arranged like a rail
road station with baggage carts and
express trucks prominently displayed.
To avoid overcrowding the Pavilion
only a limited number of couples will
be allowed at the dance. Bids at $5.00
apiece are on sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice in the Old Union.
