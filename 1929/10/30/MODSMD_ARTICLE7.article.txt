# STOCKS SLIDE IN DEMORALIZATION OF N.Y. MARKET
## Widespread Panics Result as Issues Hit Low Levels In Other Cities 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 29. (/P)—Powerful
financial interests struggled with a
panic-stricken public today to save
the stock market from complete de
moralization, and were finally able to
check another headlong collapse of
prices, as all trading records were
once more broken. A total of 16,410,-
030 shares changed hands on the
stock exchange, as compared to the
previous record of 12,894,600 reached
last Thursday.
Yesterday's wild dive of prices, the
most extensive ever witnessed in a
single day, brought a further whole
sale jettisoning of impaired margin
accounts together with frantic selling
by terrified investors. Hundreds of
stocks reached new low levels for the
year, many selling at M to Vz of their
record high levels, established during
the past few months, but a substan
tial rally in the last hour trading re
duced final net losses to little more
than two-thirds of yesterday's.
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 29. (/P)—
Caught in a whirl of frenzied selling
brought on by the world-wide debacle
in security markets stock prices tum
bled headlong in early selling on the
San Francisco exchanges, they rallied
sharply around noon as hysteria gave
place to bargain hunting. No basis
for the widespread alarm shown by
traders was manifest along Montgom
ery street outside of the action of the
market itself.
MONTREAL, Oct. 29. (Jp) — The
greatest fall of stock market values
to be experienced on the Montreal
stock exchange since the early days
of the war occurred this morning. Last
Thursday's crash did not compare
with the abandon with which issues
sought new levels today.
