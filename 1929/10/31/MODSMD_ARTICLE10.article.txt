# CARD DRUM MAJORS
## 
### 
Thirteen feet of drum-major leads
the Stanford band onto the field when
it parades before a game. Red Okker,
chief drum-major, reaches skyward
approximately six and one-half feet,
while his assistant, Morris, pierces
the blue for an equal distance. When
those two tall boys get their two-foot
shakos on their heads they mount up
to considerable altitude.
