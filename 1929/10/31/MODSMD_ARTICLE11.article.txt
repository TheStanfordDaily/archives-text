# FRENCH POET PURIST SAYS ABBE DIMNET
## Valeray Devoid of Emotion; Beauty Comes by Pure Power of Words 
### 
"Paul Valeray, to me, gives the im
pression of a hunter who shoots with
bow and arrow at shadows on the
wall —shadows which are beautiful,
perhaps, but which remain shadows,"
declared Abb 6 Ernest Dimnet, who
spoke on Modern French Poetry last
night in the Assembly Hall.
"There is no emotion in Valdray,"
he continued, "for according to the
Purists, emotion would spoil the pure
power of words. There is no heart,
just the beauty of color splashed onto
a canvas, so richly that it cannot be
chiseled. I am ready to admire this
within limits, but let us call it pure
poetry on a small scale."
Purist School
Dimnet gave a summary of the ideas
of the Purist school of poetry.
"Poetry," he said, "does not mirror
the poet's state of mind, but produces
in readers the poetic state. There is
a power of words aside from their
meaning—something poetically lat
ent." Valeray has used these words,
but with no connection of images in
the poetry. And the more meaning
there is, the more capacity for poetry.
Valeray, himself, has said that his
work is like music. He intends to
make no connection, but simply to
carry his listeners on by the stream
of words, as by a stream of music.
He does not intend to convey any
connected image, thought, or, indeed,
emotion.
Lauds Valfiray
Dimnet lauded Val6ray as a Purist
in poetry, but added that the greatest
and richest poetry holds room also for
connection, meaning, wisdom, and
emotion, which Valeray has left out.
In conclusion the Abb 6 said, "Think
of the greatest poets of all times —
everything unified and everything
simple."
