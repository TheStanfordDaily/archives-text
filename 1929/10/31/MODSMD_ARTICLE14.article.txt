# ARMY ANO NAVY STILL DIFFER ON SPORT SITUATION
## Three Compromise Proposals Submitted by Navy Are Rejected by Army Officials 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 30. (^P) â€”Army
and Navy sought to reconcile their
differences over athletic relations to
day but in the end found themselves
as far apart as ever.
The Naval Academy made three pro
posals looking to a compromise of
the dispute. All were rejected by the
Military Academy. Relations were
severed in 1928 because of a demand
of the Naval Academy that the other
service institution abide by the three
year eligibility rule.
The Military Academy offered no
compromise. It stood on its historic
principle that all cadets should have
equal opportunity and that any stu
dent who is proficient in his studies
is entitled to represent his school in
any branch of sport regardless of pre
vious experience in intercollegiate
athletics.
Statements Issued
Major General W. R. Smith issued
a statement reasserting the Military
Academy's stand and declaring "I do
not believe in compromising a prin
ciple."
Admiral Robison returned to Anna
polis without commenting, but Secre
tary Adams issued a statement dur
ing the afternoon summing up the
effort from the Navy's standpoint.
