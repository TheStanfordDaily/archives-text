"Crystallization of youthful thought
in relation to national problems, and
the discussion of mutual collegiate
problems are the primary objectives
of the National Scholastic Federation
of America," declared Stan Weigle,
former A.S.S.U. president and present
western regional representative of
this organization, at a meeting last
night of committees in charge of the
annual conference of the N.S.F.A. to
be held here January 1-4.
According to Weigle, the N.S.F.A.
came into being as a result of a
meeting of college leaders in 1925 to
urge the participation of the United
States in the World Court. Since that
time the movement has grown until
nearly 200 representatives from all
parts of the country will convene
here this winter.
The importance of the success of
this first Pacific Coast meeting was
pointed out by Stanford Steinbeck,
student body president, who stated
that the N.S.F.A. is still in its in
fancy and needs every possible effort
for its continuance.
Chairman Wenig concluded the
meeting by urging committees to be
gin immediate preparations for hous
ing and entertainment of the dele
gates.
