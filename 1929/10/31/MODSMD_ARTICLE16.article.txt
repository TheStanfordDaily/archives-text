# BUSINESS SLUMP WILL NOT FOLLOW WALL STREET CRASH SAYS WILDMAN
## 
### Mary Lee Richmond 
"For the first time in the economic
history of the United States, a col
lapse on Wall Street will not be fol
lowed by a serious business depres
sion."
Such is the prediction of Dr. Murray
S. Wildman, head of the Department
of Economics, as given to the Daily
yesterday.
"The public is not generally inter
ested in the stock market," Dr. Wild
man declared. "For it, the vital ques
tion is: 'How will the stock catastro
phe affect the producer and the con
sumer?'
General Anxiety
"For a while business may bo de
pressed as the result of the mere gen
eral anxiety throughout the country,"
Dr. Wildman admitted. "This may
lower the consumer's demand to a
certain extent. For instance, if a man
had intended to build a new house,
he might tell the contractor to wait
a while; not so much because he was
afraid of a real panic, but because he
believed that building materials might
be somewhat cheaper in another
month. But this depression will not be
permanent nor severe.
"Business is brought to a standstill
through the failure of the loaning
power of the banks, rather than di
rectly through a stock collapse. There
is no necessary connection between
them."
Condition of Banks
In justifying this statement, the

Stanford professor described the posi
tion of the banks at the present time
as in no way comparable to their con
dition in 1907, or during earlier
panics. At that time the sudden re
sulting run on the banks meant dis
aster, but now with the resources of
the Federal Reserve bank at their
disposal, no bank should be seriously
affected, not even the New York
banks, provided that they have en
gaged in legitimate banking.
"There is no evidence of money
stringency in the country," Dr. Wild
man continued. "The only cause for
fear for legitimate business lies in
the possible reduction of the con
sumers' purchasing power. The people
who will be hurt are the speculators
that borrowed money to buy their
stocks."
Fewer Christmas Automobiles
But according to Dr. Wildman, these
"margin speculators" are not numer
ous enough to move business very
far up or down. Taking the automo
bile industry as an example, he point
ed out that probably not so many new
Christmas automobiles would be
bought. "The Lincoln and the Pierce-
Arrow companies may suffer. But the
Ford company will not," he insisted,
smiling.
Dr. Wildman feels that the mass of
people have engaged in sound invest
ment rather than speculation. "The
constantly increasing savings account
of the United States is a definite in
dication of this," he concluded.

Ford company will not," he insisted,
smiling.
Dr. Wildman feels that the mass of
people have engaged in sound invest
ment rather than speculation. "The
constantly increasing savings account
of the United States is a definite in
dication of this," he concluded.
"For the first time in the economic
history of the United States, a col
lapse on Wall Street will not be fol
lowed by a serious business depres
sion."
Such is the prediction of Dr. Murray
S. Wildman, head of the Department
of Economics, as given to the Daily
yesterday.
"The public is not generally inter
ested in the stock market," Dr. Wild
man declared. "For it, the vital ques
tion is: 'How will the stock catastro
phe affect the producer and the con
sumer?'
General Anxiety
"For a while business may bo de
pressed as the result of the mere gen
eral anxiety throughout the country,"
Dr. Wildman admitted. "This may
lower the consumer's demand to a
certain extent. For instance, if a man
had intended to build a new house,
he might tell the contractor to wait
a while; not so much because he was
afraid of a real panic, but because he
believed that building materials might
be somewhat cheaper in another
month. But this depression will not be
permanent nor severe.
"Business is brought to a standstill
through the failure of the loaning
power of the banks, rather than di
rectly through a stock collapse. There
is no necessary connection between
them."
Condition of Banks
In justifying this statement, the

Stanford professor described the posi
tion of the banks at the present time
as in no way comparable to their con
dition in 1907, or during earlier
panics. At that time the sudden re
sulting run on the banks meant dis
aster, but now with the resources of
the Federal Reserve bank at their
disposal, no bank should be seriously
affected, not even the New York
banks, provided that they have en
gaged in legitimate banking.
"There is no evidence of money
stringency in the country," Dr. Wild
man continued. "The only cause for
fear for legitimate business lies in
the possible reduction of the con
sumers' purchasing power. The people
who will be hurt are the speculators
that borrowed money to buy their
stocks."
Fewer Christmas Automobiles
But according to Dr. Wildman, these
"margin speculators" are not numer
ous enough to move business very
far up or down. Taking the automo
bile industry as an example, he point
ed out that probably not so many new
Christmas automobiles would be
bought. "The Lincoln and the Pierce-
Arrow companies may suffer. But the
Ford company will not," he insisted,
smiling.
