# 'IVORY DOOR' HELVENSTON'S INITIAL PLAY
## Keho, Speegle Portray New Roles in Milne's Play; Rosenblatt Pleases 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
Tomorrow night's performance of
A. A. Milne's "The Ivory Door" will
reveal to the campus the first work
of Harold Helvenston as director of
dramatics, and will more than likely
fix his reputation as a dramatic coach
as well as a technical director.
In just a little over three weeks
Helvenston has worked on this diffi
cult play with a large cast so that last
night's dress rehearsal was itself a
very creditable performance. Particu
lar ability he has shown in taking
Paul Speegle and Katherine Kelio out
of their previous roles completely.
This feat, so often difficult, he has ac
complished and there is in Speegle's
whimsical King Perivale, nothing of
the campus comedian; and in Miss
Keho's piquant Princess Lilia, noth
ing of the defiant Maggie Wylie in
"What Every Woman Knows."
Fine Coaching
Helvenston has also done a fine
piece of coaching with the character
parts, and with the crowd of courtiers
who are in and out during the entire
play. So often are crowds neglectfully
coached that the actual personality
and positiveness of this group will be
an outstanding feature. Irving Rosen
blatt's chancellor and Stanley Mul
lin's interpretation of Brand, the
king's body servant, are characteriza
tions that show the hand of a new
director; and the work of the two
little boys, Lloyd Wilson and Donald
Reynolds, is proof of Helvenston's
ability to handle children.
Studied At Yale
Having studied several years at the
Yale school of drama, in both the
technical and directing departments,
Helvenston came to Stanford a year
ago as technical director of dra
matics; and at the end of the summer
season took Gordon Davis' place as
director during the latter's leave of
absence. Frederick Stover, who
studied with Helvenston at Yale, is
now acting technical director.
