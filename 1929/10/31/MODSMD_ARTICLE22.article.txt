## 
### 
That a survey of the telephone situ
ation in the men's dormitories will be
made at once was assured yesterday
by Almon E. Roth, University comp
troller.
"I was entirely unaware that there
had been any complaints about the
telephone service in the halls until
the Daily brought the matter to my
attention," Roth said. "I will get in
touch with telephone company offi
cials and have them make a survey of
the situation in an effort to find out
where the trouble lies.
"Since the service has apparently
been all right until this quarter the
installation of the dial system is evi
dently what has caused all the trou
ble. However, since a record and
count of the calls made has been
kept, it will not be hard for a check
up to be made," Roth concluded.
At present, it is necessary for the
switchboard operator to dial almost
all outgoing calls from all the halls
as most of the phones in the booths
are of the old type and do not con
tain dials. This may be the cause of
the poor service. An inadequate
switchboard or an insufficient number
of trunk lines are also possible rea
sons for the trouble.
