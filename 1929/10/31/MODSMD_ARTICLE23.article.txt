SALT LAKE CITY, Oct. 30. (#»)—
Half of a $500,000 bequest to Leland
Stanford University under the will
of Henry Newell, Park City, Utah,
mining man, was awarded to William
H. Newell, Jr., under the terms of a
verdict returned in district court here
today.
William H. Newell, Jr., claiming to
be the grandson of Henry Newell,
brought suit to break the will, which
had bequeathed half a million dollars
to Leland Stanford University to es
tablish scholarships for Utah students,
and divided an equal amount among
friends and relatives. The plaintiff
was not mentioned in the will.
The jury in special verdicts found
that William H. Newell, Sr., was the
illegitimate son of Henry Newell, and
had been recognized by Henry Newell
and his wife as their son. William H.
Newell, Jr., was the legitimate son of
William H. Newell, Sr., the jury
found, and the name of the former
had been omitted by accident or mis
take from Henry Newell's will.
The defense contended William H.
Newell, Sr., was the adopted son of
Henry Newell, and that the plaintiff's
name had been omitted from Henry
Newell's will through intention.
The part of the estate left to Stan
ford was for men's and women's
scholarships. Preference was to be
given students from the state of Utah,
but if there were not enough, students
from other states were to be eligible.
No one scholarship was to exceed
$900 a year, and no one student was
to hold a scholarship more than four
years.
