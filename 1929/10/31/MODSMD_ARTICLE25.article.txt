# EASY WIN OVER TECH EXPECTED BY CARD COACH
## "Tiny" Thornhill Will Start Reserves Against Humble Engineers Here Saturday Coast Grid Interest Centers On Bear-Trojan Battle in South; Title Is at Stake 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Although interest in Pacific Coast
pigskin circles shifts clown to the land
of Troy this week-end, where the
Conference title lies in balance, the
Stanford Redshirts will hold a little
football party all of their own on Sat
urday afternoon with a feeble gang of
Cal Tech Engineers the guests oÂ£
honor.
The Cal Tech players, who are
scheduled to pack up their school
books and hop on the northbound
limited sometime tonight, have, prac
tically speaking, a hopeless task
ahead of them when they attempt to
stop the Cardinal machine. Fully re
covered from the setback at the hands
of the Trojans last Saturday, Coach
Pop Warner's men plan to take the
southern team in stride.
Poor Record
Scoring only one win to date, the
Engineers have an exceptionally poor
record this season. In every other
start they failed to shove over a single
touchdown. While the Cards were
being nosed out on the 26t.h, Cal Tech
was also having a tough time. In fact,
the going was so rough that the Whit
tier Poets pushed the Engineers over
by a score of 19 to 0, and the Poets
were supposed to be a weak outfit.
Not so long ago the U.C.L.A. Bruin
came to life of an afternoon and
mauled their southern rivals by a
clean-cut 31 to 0 victory. Stanford, it
is to be remembered, found the Bruin
to be a stuffed specimen, and toyed
around with it for a 57 to 0 win.
So it is no wonder that Pop is
going to take the afternoon off this
Saturday and scout the Cal-U.S.C.
battle. While Coach Warner is gone,
the Cardinal team will be handled by
Tiny Thornhill. Thornhill had charge
of the boys in the U.C.L.A. fracas, and
they played a pretty fair game that
day.
Though no definite lineup has been
announced as yet, it is almost certain
that a team composed entirely of re
serves will start the contest. Yester
day the squad had its first real work
out of the week, and will hold another
stiff practice session behind barred
gates this afternoon.
