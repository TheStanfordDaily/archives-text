# FIE ON THE BIG BRUTES

### 
One who signs himself " '31—Law" has drawn the Daily's attention
to the shocking language used by those crude fellows who sat in Stan
ford's rooting section for the gridiron encounter between Coach Glenn
Warner's football team and the eleven representing the University of
Southern California.
If we are to believe " '31—Law," the naughty words were positively
nauseating—we mean actually. " '31—Law" was insulted, surprised, hurt,
upset, shocked, and peeved.
We agree with " '31—Law" that such practices are plebeian and thor
oughly naughty. In fact, we have often placed our hands over our ears
to shield our sensibilities at the football games. Once we missed seeing
"Spud" Harder get his jaw fractured because some bestial chap sitting
next to us shouted "golly" right in our face.
The Daily strongly urges the Board of Athletic Control to think of
the comfort and the finer sensibilities of its public and provide individual
phone booths for each spectator to sit in. This simple plan would keep
the meanies in their places and would be very convenient in case of a
snow storm.
