Authorities of Yale University are perturbed over the fact that too
many of the students are spending the week-ends in New York and Bos
ton. As a result they return to classes "jaded and unfit for college work
on Monday."
The president of the institution has become alarmed over the situation
and predicts that plans will have to be formulated to check the week-end
exodus from the campus. In one of his addresses recently, he expressed
the belief that the young men of the present generation gre notoriously
restless and are never at case unless they are going some place at a high
rate of speed.
If the sage had restricted the criticism of the men of Yale, the state
ment could have been accepted with less opposition on the assumption that
he knew the youths of Yale from observation.
As a matter of fact, the youth of today is no more restless than his
father; he has a period in which to study and a period in which to play,
lie requires less time to learn; he studies more intensively. Life is not a
serious game to him. The future of education is safe in his hands.
Officials of any institution will find the task of forcing the students
to stay on the campus over the week-end a very distasteful and perplexing
one.—The Minnesota Daily.
