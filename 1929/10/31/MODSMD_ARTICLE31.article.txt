# BLACK MAGIC

"Double, double, toil and trouble,
Fire burn and cauldron bubble."
Weird incantations, little brown elves hiding in the nooks of trees,
and witches whining in the black forest's mists—this is the spirit of All
Hallows Eve which will descend over the red and brown roofs of the
University tonight as the last rays of the orange sun disappear in the west.
Strange things have always happened on this night when the eerie
inhabitants of the black shadows come forth into the mortal world, and
frighten children, and fill the grown-ups with wonder and awe.
Nothing could be farther from the rationalism and materialism of the
modern civilization of which Stanford is a typical example than this lin
gering on of the medieval belief in the powers of darkness. But even if
we know that it's only the wind whispering among the leaves, and it's only
because Edison has failed to penetrate a ccrtain part of a forest that the
grove seems much darker, and blacker, and more mysterious—let's forget
it all tonight and revel in the magic and fancy which has never been
explained empirically—and remember that the "gobelins '11 get you
Ef
you
don't
watch
out 1"
