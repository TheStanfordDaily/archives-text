A PREFACE TO MORALS, Walter
Lippmann. The Macmillan Co.,
1929. At the Stanford Bookstore.
"Men do not seek to find the will of
God in the universe hut only to know if
his will is fundamentally like their own,"
is a typical statement from Lippmann's
latest brain child, "A Preface to Morals."
There is nothing startlingly original in
the book. Its value lies in its author's
remarkable capacity to make a too often
pedantic and abstract subject popular and
practical.
"A Preface to Morals" is what the
name implies, an exposition of a prob
lem. The most sane conclusion reached
by Lippmann is at best a recollection. "It
is well to remember that in all great phi
losophies from Aristotle to Bernard
Shaw, it is taught that one of the con
ditions of happiness is to renounce some
of the satisfactions which men normally
crave."
The morality of Lippmann is the mor
ality of humanism. It is the product of a
man who has believed, thought, rejected,
agonized, and thought again. The religion
of yesterday lias been too lately left be
hind to laugh at. The wound caused by
its removal is still too sore to scorn.
The knowledge that wounds have
healed in the past and that men now
proudly exhibit the scars as testimony
of former endurance and triumph, is so
ciety's greatest reassurance for the fu
ture. "Once we confess, as Job finally
did, that the plan of the universe is not
what we naively wish it would be, there
is no longer a problem of evil. Job's story
is of how a man learned to accept life
maturely."
Lippmann's style is fluent and natural,

almost like the flow of elegant conver
sation. His word choice is refined and
unpedantic, his figures of speech few, his
personality unpresuming, his tolerance
and understanding great.
"WHY BRING THAT UP," New Stan
ford.
A couple of years ago a scourge hit
the country full blast. It was the
Moran and Mack record of "The Two
Black Crows." It was riotously funny
for about the first twenty times, but
by the time every shoe clerk in the
land became "I'd-rather-not-hear-any
more-about-it" conscious, it began to,
pall.
Now the originators of that disc
are talkie stars, and their first effort,
"Why Bring That Up?" is current at
the New Stanford Theatre. Two time
worn themes are once again pulled
out of Hollywood's bag of tricks to
furnish a background for the two
black-face comedians to present their
dialogue.
The "striving troupers making good
on Broadway" is the first motif. Sec
ond is the "old pal, old buddy, you
wouldn't go back on your old pal"
theme. Even good sound and photo
graphy do not offset the dreariness of
these poor, old plot-makers.
Mack is the sleepy-voiced and like
able side of the team, and proves
much the better actor. The abilities
of Moran are overtaxed with his part.
Evelyn Brent plays a nasty character
and you won't like her at all. Eve's
a little too cold and calculating for
us. The comedy of Harry Green will
make up for it, though. â€”J. T.
