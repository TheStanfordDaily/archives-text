## TWO CRITICS—TWO OPINIONS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I am writing in order that others
may not be misled by Mr. Allan Hart's
review of "Bird in Hand" by John
Drinkwater, published in last Friday's
Daily. Last Sunday night I went to
see "Bird in Hand" at the Geary thea
tre, in spite of certain misgivings en
gendered by Mr. Hart's article. These
misgivings were heightened on enter
ing the theatre by the fact that there
were few people there and those most
ly older people, not of college age.
I feared the Daily's review had kept
most of the theatre-going public at
home. Soon, however, more people ar
rived and the play began.
During the first act I really could
not help smiling at Father Greenleaf
and his objections against his daugh
ter's going out with the young lord.
He reminded me of another very
worthy father I knew who objected to
his daughter playing cards in her
bedroom on Sunday with certain
young men. I had to laugh outright
at Mr. Blanquet—"Blankay, q-u-e-t, of
French descent" —the Cockney drum
mer or "commercial man" as he called
himself. As a student of paleontology
myself, Blanquet's description of him
self as an amateur naturalist struck
me as particularly quaint. He said he
collected mosses. When pressed as
to what he did with mosses, he said

he just labelled them and put them in
a drawer.
The second act is an uproarious
bedroom farce, not of the usual man
girl type, but with Mr. Godolphin,
K.X., the bachelor-lawyer, and young
whipper-snapper Arnwood, the princi
pal actors. Controversy rages over
Greenleaf's treatment of his daughter.
Mr. Blanquet only wishes they would
keep quiet. Finally, not only does the
whole family, including daughter,
enter the gentlemen's bedroom, but
even the boy friend comes in through
the window. The final scene is a happy
ending of the Prince-and-Cinderella
type in which His Lordship very
neatly overcomes yoeman Greenleat s
objections to a marriage of his daugh
ter with young Lord Arnwood.
The enjoyment of the play lies not
in the plot, of which there is hardly
any, or in the action (there are 110
fights) but in the acting, the charac
ter portrayal, and the ideas conveyed
through them. I did not mention the
humor. Have you a funny-bone? If
you go to the play with an open mind
and do not let the English (and Cock
ney) accent bother you, I feel sure
you will come away in a pleasant
frame of mind and with a better
opinion of Mr. Drinkwater and Eng
lish actors than Mr. Hart has formed.

young men. I had to laugh outright
at Mr. Blanquet—"Blankay, q-u-e-t, of
French descent" —the Cockney drum
mer or "commercial man" as he called
himself. As a student of paleontology
myself, Blanquet's description of him
self as an amateur naturalist struck
me as particularly quaint. He said he
collected mosses. When pressed as
to what he did with mosses, he said

he just labelled them and put them in
a drawer.
The second act is an uproarious
bedroom farce, not of the usual man
girl type, but with Mr. Godolphin,
K.X., the bachelor-lawyer, and young
whipper-snapper Arnwood, the princi
pal actors. Controversy rages over
Greenleaf's treatment of his daughter.
Mr. Blanquet only wishes they would
keep quiet. Finally, not only does the
whole family, including daughter,
enter the gentlemen's bedroom, but
even the boy friend comes in through
the window. The final scene is a happy
ending of the Prince-and-Cinderella
type in which His Lordship very
neatly overcomes yoeman Greenleat s
objections to a marriage of his daugh
ter with young Lord Arnwood.
The enjoyment of the play lies not
in the plot, of which there is hardly
any, or in the action (there are 110
fights) but in the acting, the charac
ter portrayal, and the ideas conveyed
through them. I did not mention the
humor. Have you a funny-bone? If
you go to the play with an open mind
and do not let the English (and Cock
ney) accent bother you, I feel sure
you will come away in a pleasant
frame of mind and with a better
opinion of Mr. Drinkwater and Eng
lish actors than Mr. Hart has formed.

The Editor, Sir:
I am writing in order that others
may not be misled by Mr. Allan Hart's
review of "Bird in Hand" by John
Drinkwater, published in last Friday's
Daily. Last Sunday night I went to
see "Bird in Hand" at the Geary thea
tre, in spite of certain misgivings en
gendered by Mr. Hart's article. These
misgivings were heightened on enter
ing the theatre by the fact that there
were few people there and those most
ly older people, not of college age.
I feared the Daily's review had kept
most of the theatre-going public at
home. Soon, however, more people ar
rived and the play began.
During the first act I really could
not help smiling at Father Greenleaf
and his objections against his daugh
ter's going out with the young lord.
He reminded me of another very
worthy father I knew who objected to
his daughter playing cards in her
bedroom on Sunday with certain
young men. I had to laugh outright
at Mr. Blanquet—"Blankay, q-u-e-t, of
French descent" —the Cockney drum
mer or "commercial man" as he called
himself. As a student of paleontology
