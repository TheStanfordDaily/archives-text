# STANFORD GRAYS WORK HARD FOR SPARTAN CLASH
## San Jose State Reputed As Strong Defensive Team; Weak on Offense 
### 
Plenty of hard work is the program
mapped out for the Stanford Gray
football squad as the men prepare for
their contest Saturday morning with
the San Jose State Teachers College
eleven hero. The Spartans have a
good defensive team, but so far have
not set the world afire as a point
scoring aggregation.
Because of the defensive qualities
of the Spartans, the chief difficulty
of the Grays will be to make some
touchdowns, for their offense has not
as yet functioned any too well. How
ever, they showed promise of some
real offensive strength in their game
with the St. Ignatius Reserves when
thoy ran over three touchdowns in
the first quarter, and with Baker to
do tho plunging and passing, and Col
vin, Hand, and Wilson on the receiv
ing end of a few tosses, they expect
■to make plenty of big gains.
The Grays have little to fear about
the strength of their defense, for the
big, fast charging forward wall has
smothered any attack that the two
teams they have met have been able
to show. The few passes that have
been tried against the Grays have
gained little because of an alert pass
defense.
Gilbert Stars
Coach Cuddeback has had a number
of practices on open-field work for
the backs, while Robesky has put the
linemen through a lot of tackling
work. Gilbert has made some regular
"Cagle" runs in practice, shaking off
tacklers In all directions and using a
good straight-arm to advantage, de
spite the fact that the Grays have a
number of good tacklers who try to
bring him down. Hand and Colvin
look good receiving passes. The line
ups for the game have not yet been
announced.
Because the freshmen are to play
a preliminary game at the varsity-
Caltech game in the Stadium, the
Grays game will be played on the
freshman practice field at 10 o'clock
Saturday morning.
