# BASKETBALL SQUAD FOR COMING SEASON SELECTED BY HUNT
## 
### 
Eighteen men have been selected
by Coach Husky Hunt for the 1930
basketball varsity, with eleven others
named as still having a chance to earn
a plaoe on the squad. Five-day-a-week
practice will commence November 11.
Hunt is now busy drilling his men
on offensive floor plays, particularly
those used against a man-to-man de
fense. Stanford will probably use a
shifting rone defense most of the
time, changing to a man-to-man de
fense when necessary, as was done
last year.
Capable Guards
Developing capable guards to take
the place of Captain Rothert, Rey
nolds, Thompson, Rintala, and Baker,
during practice games which are
schedulod before the end of the foot
ball Boason is the main problem fac
ing the coaching squad.
Games are at present scheduled
with the Y.M.I, at Kezar on December
21st, with Nevada at Reno on the
23d and 24th, and with Oregon State
at Kexar on December 26th. Attempts
are being made to also arrange a

series oÂ£ games with San Jose State
earlier in the season. Griffin and Row
ley, both transfers, have been show
ing up well in the guard positions, and
may see considerable action in these
preliminary games.
Plenty of Forwards
Stanford will be well-equipped with
forwards, with Fawcett, Tyler, Berg,
Loomis, and Ray now out for practice.
Choice of a center will probably be
made from Hawkins, McCandless, and
Mears. The guard situation is some
what up in the air until the close of
football activity.
The Card team makes two trips to
Los Angeles early in January to take
on U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. in the first
conference games.
Those named by Hunt as definitely
on the varsity are: Tyler, Fawcett,
Berg, Moffatt, Ray, Sexson, Hawkins,
McCandless, Mears, Bonner, Doub,
Rothert, Reynolds, Loomis, Rowley,
Thompson, Rintala, Phil Baker.
The eleven possibilities named are:
Weaver, Brunson, Griffin, Bailey,
Butts, Nielson, Clough, Lawry, McEl
wain, Eastman, Broderick.
