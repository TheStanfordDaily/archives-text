# CARD FRESHMEN DOPED TO LOSE ST. MARY'S TILT
## Twenty-Three Prep Captains On Moraga Squad; Hunt Perfects Defense 
### Don Oswill 
Coach "Husky" Hunt put his freshman
football players through a hard scrim
mage last night to give the men a chance
to work up a good defense for the St.
Mary's contest to be played here Sat
urday. All early indications point to a
tough game for the frosh, as the Saints
have hung up an impressive early season
record.
23 Captains
"The twenty-three captains of St.
Mary's" form an exceptionally strong
freshman combination at the Moraga
school, representing the cream of the
East Bay high schools. In one of their
first games, they crushed the University
of California College of Pharmacy eleven
by a 60 to 0 score, and since then they
have defeated the St. Ignatius Reserve:),
the California freshmen, and numerous
other organizations.
Twenty-three former high school cap
tains on one freshman team. That is
worth pondering over. It is perhaps the
first time in the history of football that
so many promising athletes have selected
one institution at the same time. With
such tough internal competition, one
might expect a really powerful outfit to
take the field for the Red and Blue Sat
urday.
Face Big Odds
But Coach Hunt's warriors have tasted
of victory, and despite the big odds
against them will be out to take a husky
swat at the Saints. The baby Redshirts
have regained some of that confidence
which they evidently dropped after the
Santa Clara game.
The trosh have demonstrated that they
are capable of launching an offense that
terminates at their opponents' goal line.
The work of Afflerbaugh, Stevens, Palm
er, and Rogers has been improving with
every contest, and these boys hit their
stride against U.C.L.A. last week. Af
fierbaugn should be the Cards' best bet,
as the Saints have an exceptionally strong
line and if the Stanford frosh do break
away it will probably be around the
fianks.
Choate at Tackle
Virg Choate, the husky lad from Okla
homa, has been shifted from center to
tackle. Bill Bates beat out Choate at the
pivot position, but Hunt can't afford to
leave 220 pounds of lively beef on the
sidelines. With a little experience, Choate
may develop into a steady tackle, and
will probably make the going tough for
La√üorde.
