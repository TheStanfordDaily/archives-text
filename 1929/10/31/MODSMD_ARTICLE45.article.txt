# Bears Prepare To Face Trojans In Decisive Battle
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 30 (/P).—The Bears
of California, facing their big test this
football season against the Southern
California Trojans, were busy today
sharpening their claws for the fray Sat
urday.
With every other major question of the
Pacific Coast Conference campaign set
tled, the sole remaining problem was the
matter of the strength of the Bear eleven,
and certain it was that all the strength
Coach Nibs Price's men could muster
would be needed to repel the powerful
drives of their Los Angeles rivals.
With the Northwest definitely out of
the Championship running, and Stanford
sidetracked by the defeat of last Saturday
at the hands of the Trojans, the South
ern California eleven was the favorite,
but had a strong rival to reckon with in
the Bears.
The Bears were scheduled to leave to
morrow for the southern battle ground.
Their eleven remains unbeaten so far
this season ,and according to observers is
stronger than at any time this year, hav
ing prepared thoroughly an ironclad de
fense, and relying on that noted war
horse, Bennie Lom.
Jones To Start Duffield
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 30. (/P)—The
probability that Marshall Duffield will
start at quarter for the University of
Southern California Trojans when
they clash with the Golden Bears of
California here Saturday, presages a
punting duel during the early stages
of the conflict.
Duffield, whose broken field running
is destined to go down in Trojan his
tory along with that of Morley Drury,
Don Williams, and the others, is the
only kicker on whom Coach Howard
Jones can depend to match the un
erring toe of Benny Lom, Bear back
field ace.
There was a long scrimmage ses
sion in line for the men of Troy to
day, which included both a defense
against Coach Clarence "Nibs" Price's
tricks and a perfecting of the U.S.C.
attack.
