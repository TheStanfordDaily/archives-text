# ORIENTAL ANTIQUES LOANED BY KEHR ON EXHIBIT AT GALLERY
## 
### 
A collection of rare oriental an
tiques is now being exhibited in the
Stanford Art Gallery and will bo
shown until after the Christmas holi
days. The exhibit was loaned and col
lected by Mr. Fredrick Kehr of Palo
Alto who has made a hobby of col
lecting rare antiques.
The articles consist mainly of Chi
nese bronzes, gold work, ceramics, and
paintings, and cover a period of more
than two thousand years. The most
valuable piece of the collection is a
large porcelain bowl which is intri
cately designed in the sacred Chinese
emblem of two dragons guarding the
holy pearl. A group of sea birds eat
ing from the seeds of a lotus blossom
completes the design. The article is
priceless because of the rare ouber
gine (egg plant) color which can not
be reproduced today and was lost
after the Ming dynasty.
One antique is a bit of unsurpasesd
miniature painting which is done on a
court fan made from a single piece
of bamboo. Although the surface is
rough and uneven, the painting is
greatly improved by using a magnify
ing glass. The brush strokes are very
fine on these old paintings—they can
hardly be accomplished with a pen
today—and they show a decided dif
ference between old and modern Chi
nese work.
