# PROFESSOR DAVIDSON, STUDENTS PAY VISIT TO 'COUNTRY SCHOOL'
## 
### 
Professor P. E. Davidson of the Edu
cation department, Lawrence Thomas
and O. A. Anderson, students, visited
the newly established "Country
School" in Hillsborough last Thursday
at the invitation of Grant Taylor.
The "Country School," a private in
stitution, is arousing a great deal of
public interest because it represents
the first radical departure in the West
from the standardized methods of edu
cation which have prevailed in the
larger majority of the schools of the
nation. Its operation is based on the
"Winnetka" of progressive system. A
unique feature of the new school is
the assignment plan which supplants
the arbitrary grading system. Instead
of "grades" there are "goals of
achievement" and the pupil may pro
gress as rapidly or as slowly as his
capabilities permit. No examinations
are given; but achievement tests are
administered from time to time, to
indicate the progress of the individual
from informal classroom instruction.
