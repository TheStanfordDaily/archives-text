### 
PARIS, Oct. 30. (i-P) —After more
than a week of political bargaining
in the ministerial crisis brought on by
the overthrow of the Briand govern
ment, France was looking forward to
night to moderately radical but
staunch republican government under
a new premier.
Etienne Clementel, formerly minis
ter of finances in the Herriot govern
ment and chairman of the finance
committee of the senate, definitely in
formed President Doumergue late to
day that he was organizing a govern
ment. M. Clementel is new to the pre
miership, though he has been several
times a cabinet minister. M. Clemen
tel, who took up the business of form
ing a cabinet after M. Edouard Dela
dier, radical socialist leader, had
failed, is just radical enough to enjoy
the confidence of the orthodox French
movement and sufficiently conserva
tive to be acceptable to the bourgeoise.
Clementel is expected to present a
list of cabinet ministers to the presi
dent tomorrow night.
