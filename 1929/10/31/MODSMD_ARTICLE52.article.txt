# BACTERIAL DISEASE TREATMENT IS DEVELOPED IN LOCAL LABORATORY
## 
### 
By Theodore DeMotte
Practical work, along with mere in
struction experiments, has its place at
the Stanford Bacteriology Department
laboratories, according to information
recently given out in the department.
Many students are taking the regular
laboratory courses, while those more
advanced and experienced in the work
are carrying on experiments and re
search that have great practical
value in the study of the means of
control of germ diseases.
"As is usually the case with the
scientific laboratory, even the most
startling and important discoveries
are made as the result of long years
of research, and are not stumbled
upon accidentally or suddenly." Dr.
E. W. Schultz, professor of bacteri
ology and experimental pathology un
der whom the researches are being
made, was explaining some of the
workings of the lab. "Scientists are
usually careful about making any
statements to the press about their
discoveries and their progress be
cause their statements are so often
twisted and misrepresented. For this
reason, we are unwilling to reveal the
results of our research."
One of the most interesting of the
recent researches carried on in the
laboratory is that on the development

of a substance known as bacterio-1
phage which is used in the treatment
of certain bacterial diseases. This sub- i
stance exercises no direct effect either j
on the damaged or the normal tissues j
of the diseased creature, but dissolves
i and destroys the bacteria that cause
the diseased condition. The work in
the laboratory has been along the line
of developing varieties of bacterio
phage that will be useful in different
kinds of disease, as there must be a
different kind of 'phage for each kind
of disease treated.
Since the infantile paralysis scare
I on the campus last year, the labora
-1 tory has been working on an experi
| ment for the development of means
;of treatment of the disease. Though
j much progress has been made so far,
j much remains to be done to perfect a
perfect defense against infantile
i paralysis.
The laboratory consists of several
large experimental rooms and a num
| ber of smaller research labs where
j assistants and advanced students are
| working out projects of the type men
l tioned. Upon entering the laboratory,
, the nostrils are assailed by the odors
| of numerous disinfectants and cultures
j that are being used. The workers in
the building, however, do not seem to
mind the odors in the least. All per
; sons working in the laboratories are
dressed in white, giving the place
the appearance of a hospital. All in
i struments and materials are kept
scrupulously clean, for the presence
of an unwanted organism in a culture
j may spoil a delicate experiment.
