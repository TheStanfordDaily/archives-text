# RYAN LAB SUCCESSES LAID TO CO-OPERATION WITH POWER PEOPLE
## Technical Problems Solved For Utility Companies Develop Good-Will 
### 
"Behind the continued success of the
Ryan High Voltage Laboratory lies the
idea of perfect cp-operation and co-ordi
nation between the University and the
power interests of the country." Dr. H.
D. Ryan was explaining the work and the
placc in Stanford that the laboratory,
which bears his name, occupies.
"The public utilities bring us problems
to solve. We carry on the experiments
in our instruction courses and the com
panies pay for the research. We gain in
an educational way, the company is better
off economically, and the electrical engi
neering world is just that much farther
ahead in the field of research. This spirit
of mutual good-will has developed in the
past until today there is not the slightest
hi. of antagonism between Stanford and
the power interests of the state."
On Cornell Faculty
Doctor Ryan came to Stanford in 1905
after seventeen years on the faculty of
Cornell, and became executive head of
the electrical engineering department. He
is still the head of this department, al
though his research duties have far sur
passed his work in the department.
It was in 1926 that the General Electric
Company came forward with the propo
sition that it would give the University a
two and one-tenth million volt set if the
University would provide housing for
the set and certain necessary equipment
for its operation. This Stanford agreed
to do, and the Ryan Laboratory situated
a mile southeast of the campus is the
result of the agreement.
New Generator
At this time Ryan and his associates
are installing a million and a half volt
"lightning generator" that has recently
been received from the East. Formerly
all high voltage equipment was construct
ed on the spot, but with the increasing de
velopment in this field electric companies
are turning out manufactured articles of
standardized forms and sizes. From now
on, according to Doctor Ryan, research in
this field will increase as problems for
new industrial power projects arise.
