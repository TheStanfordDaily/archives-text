# FOOTBALL THAT'S- DIFFERENT

### Feg Murray 
Almost as many freak and unusual
things can happen in a football game as (
in a golf match. Roy Riegel's famous j
run in the wrong direction in the Cali- j
fornia-Georgia Tech game last New-
Year's day is the most famous of the j
"Queeriosities of Football," but not the !
dizziest. It happened in a big, post-sea- i
son game and got plenty of advertising, j
but many a player had become confused 1
and ru nthe wrong direction before Roy |
Riegels did it.
Coach Bill Alexander was asked, after j
the New Year's game, to tell the freak- j
iest play he ever saw, and came through I

, with the incident illustrated above, where
1 the ball collapsed over the cross-bar of the
1 goal posts. The referee couldn't decide
whether it was a successful place kick or
a touchback, and so ruled that both teams
I had been offside and ordered the play
j over.
The story of the other place kick, that
was booted in the wrong direction, is to
, be taken with a grain of salt. It was told
| to Alexander by a "wild westerner." The
; player of the defensive team, who broke
j through and made the place kick first
| and then ran on down the field and re-
I covere dthe ball, refused to accept three

points for his "feet" and held out for a
touchdown!
In a Christmas Day game on the Pa
cific Coast a few years ago, John Levi of
the Haskell Indian team surprised the
spectators an dhis opponents, the Olympic
Club of San Francisco, by carrying the
ball in one hand while running with it,
and straight-arming would-be tacklers
! now and then by shoving them in the
face or chucking them under the chin
with the inflated pigskin!
Back in 1908 two senior classes, A and
B, of Los Angeles High School, were
playing a "grudge" football game. It was

0 to 0 and the ball was in midfield near
! the side lines, by a bench where sat sub
i stitutes, water boys, and a few spectators.
All of a sudden the ball squirted out of
! a mass of players and the cry of "Fum
! ble !" rang out. Those on the bench leaped
i to their feet so as not to miss anything
i and a spare ball rolled out onto the field,
j The extra oval was immediately scooped
up by a player who dashed down the field
I to score with it, while at the same mo
i ment one of his opponents was scoring
1 at the other end of the field with the real
| ball.
I P.S.—The game ended in a riot.

Almost as many freak and unusual
things can happen in a football game as (
in a golf match. Roy Riegel's famous j
run in the wrong direction in the Cali- j
fornia-Georgia Tech game last New-
Year's day is the most famous of the j
"Queeriosities of Football," but not the !
dizziest. It happened in a big, post-sea- i
son game and got plenty of advertising, j
but many a player had become confused 1
and ru nthe wrong direction before Roy |
Riegels did it.
Coach Bill Alexander was asked, after j
the New Year's game, to tell the freak- j
iest play he ever saw, and came through I

, with the incident illustrated above, where
1 the ball collapsed over the cross-bar of the
1 goal posts. The referee couldn't decide
whether it was a successful place kick or
a touchback, and so ruled that both teams
I had been offside and ordered the play
j over.
The story of the other place kick, that
was booted in the wrong direction, is to
, be taken with a grain of salt. It was told
| to Alexander by a "wild westerner." The
; player of the defensive team, who broke
j through and made the place kick first
| and then ran on down the field and re-
I covere dthe ball, refused to accept three

points for his "feet" and held out for a
touchdown!
In a Christmas Day game on the Pa
cific Coast a few years ago, John Levi of
the Haskell Indian team surprised the
spectators an dhis opponents, the Olympic
Club of San Francisco, by carrying the
ball in one hand while running with it,
and straight-arming would-be tacklers
! now and then by shoving them in the
face or chucking them under the chin
with the inflated pigskin!
Back in 1908 two senior classes, A and
B, of Los Angeles High School, were
playing a "grudge" football game. It was

0 to 0 and the ball was in midfield near
! the side lines, by a bench where sat sub
i stitutes, water boys, and a few spectators.
All of a sudden the ball squirted out of
! a mass of players and the cry of "Fum
! ble !" rang out. Those on the bench leaped
i to their feet so as not to miss anything
i and a spare ball rolled out onto the field,
