# UNIVERSITY TO START REMOVING OLD TRACKS ABOUT DECEMBER 1ST
## 
### 
Tearing up of the old trolley tracks
will begin about December 1, accord
ing to Almon E. Roth. Work has been
delayed by the fact that an under
pass is being built at Mayfield which
prevents wrecking material being
brought into the campus over the
tracks.
As soon as the underpass is com
pleted a wrecking derrick will be
brought in and the tracks from the
Uookatore to the powerhouse will be
taken up. The tracks from the high
way to the poworhouse will be left in
till next spring as they will be used
in bringing oil cars and other sup
plies to the University until that lime.
The oil cars will be brought from
Mayfield as the tracks going into Palo
Alto have already been torn up. The
Palo Alto to Mayfield tracks will be
torn up when the highway is widened
which will be early next spring. At
that time the remaining tracks on the
campus will be torn up and the Uni
versity will either put in a pipe line
for oil or else change over to the use
of gas for fuel.
