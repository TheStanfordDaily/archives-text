As a special service to Stanford
students H. P. Fisher, photographer
at No. IGS Post St., San Francisco,
will submit six or more proofs for
selection at the SPECIAL STANFORD
rates of last year and as a further in
ducement he will allow credit to the
amount of one ROUND TRIP railroad
fare from Palo Alto to San Francisco
on the original purchase.
Fisher is favorably known for the
beautiful portraits which he made for
the 1027-1928 and 1929 Quads and is
today even better prepared than
heretofore to make portraits of un
usual type. Fisher's studio is at 165
Post St., San Francisco. â€”Adv.
