LEE Morse has a tricky way of stepping right off the face of a record
and being perfectly charmingtoyou—it's 6omethingmore than singing.
You'll find all the familiar Morse magnetism charging both the
song hits on her newest Columbia record. One is a lively number in
dance tempo — the other a crooning intimate ballad crammed with
lots of "come-along."
Before your dealer wraps this one up for you, have him play
these steppers, too . . .
