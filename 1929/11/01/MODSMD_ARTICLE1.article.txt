# PREMIER HOPES TO VISIT OTHER COLONIAL LANDS
## MacDonald Expresses Wishes To Make Inspection of New Zealand and South Africa "Closer Contact Between All Dominions Needed in These Times," Says Labor Leader 
### 
S.S. DUCHESS OF YORK, Oct. 31.
(/P) â€”Ramsay Mac Donald, having
plumbed American thought on naval
disarmament and established close
contact with the Dominion of Canada,
now wishes to visit South Africa,
Au3tralia, and New Zealand.
"In these times of change and evo
lution," he said today, "I feel the need
of closer contact with all the domin
ions irt the British Empire. I wish to
go next to South Africa, New Zealand,
and Australia in order to complete
the round."
No Definite Plans
Mac Donald added that he had no
definite plans and could not say at
present just when he would be able
to make the trip.
For the first time since embarking
at Quebec, Mac Donald changed from
"Us comfortable old brown tweeds to
night into dinner clothes and joined
the merrymaking at the captain's ban
quet.
Ship Hits Gale
Before dawn the Duchess of York
will anchor off Liverpool and the voy
age, which the Premier hoped would
afford him a much-needed rest, will
have ended. He had, however, little
opportunity for recuperating from the
exertions of his activities in the
United States and Canada as the pas
sage across the North Atlantic was
rough. There was a howling southeast
gale and little or no sunshine after
the vessel emerged from the protec
tive waters of the St. Lawrence.
