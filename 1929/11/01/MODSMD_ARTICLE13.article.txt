A. A. Milne's whimsical comedy of
a symbolical kingdom, "The Ivory
Door," will be presented tonight in
the Assembly Hall at 8:20 o'clock, for
the first time on the Pacific Coast,
under the direction of Harold Helven
ston, acting director of dramatics.
Paul Speegle, whose previous work
in dramatics has consisted chiefly of
farcical and burlesque parts, will play
King Perivale, the very humorous,
whimsical monarch whose lines are
full of Milne's philosophy. Playing op
posite Speegle will be Katherine Kelio,
who did Maggie Wylie in "What
Every Woman Knows," as the charm
ing Princess Lilia. Stanley Mullin,
Arthur Hurt, Trow Stephens, and Irv
ing Rosenblatt will have four of
Milne's delightful character parts,
Rosenblatt making an unimpeachably
suave chancellor.
Lucille Morgan will make her first
appearance in campus dramatics to
night in the part of timid, anxious-to
please little Thora, Princess Lilia's
maid; and Caroline Fisher, who is
also new to the Stanford stage, will
do the part of Anna, the old nurse
who cared for Perivale in his child
hood.
Two local children, Lloyd Wilson
and Donald Reynolds, will play the
parts of the boy princes in the pro
logue and epilogue, Wilson doing his
scene with Tom Henry as the king,
and Reynolds playing with Jack Mc-
Dowell as his father.
The sets for "The Ivory Door" were
constructed by the class in theatrical
workshop, under the direction of
Frederick Stover, acting technical
director; and the lighting has been
done under his supervision by Joe
Gordon.
