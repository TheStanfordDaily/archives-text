# VARSITY SOCCER TEAM TO MEET UNDEFEATED OLYMPICS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Two undefeated soccer teams will
clash when the Stanford varsity meets
the powerful Olympic Club aggrega
tion of San Francisco tomorrow after
noon at 3:30 on the Cardinal field.
The fact that each eleven has played
a tie game with its only mutual op
ponent to date, the Rovers, shows
they are of comparatively equal
strength.
The Olympic Club plays an aggres
sive type of game and relies largely
on passes and kicks, while in con
trast Coach Harry Maloney has
taught his men to play a short pass
brand of offense which utilizes speed
and shifty footwork on the part of the
forwards.
Maloney has been putting his men
through long and hard scrimmages
during the past week in an effort to
bring together a combination of for
wards that functions smoothly. Mu
jica and Eberhard, veteran wing-men,
and Nichols, flashy inside left, have
continued to stand out at their re
spective positions, and the regular
backfield, composed of Captain Mayer,
Burns, Dalton, Springer, and Rey
nolds, form a strong defensive unit
that has improved with every prac
tice.
