# THIRD ATTEMPT TO FRAME NEW CABINET BEGINS
## Present Ministerial Crisis Is Most Serious Faced by French Republic 
### 
PARIS, Oct. 31. (£>)—'The task of at
tempting to form a cabinet in succes
sion to the Briand government which
resigned October 22 will be under
taken by Andre Tardieu, who was
French High Commissioner in the
United States in the closing years of
the World War. Tardieu tonight ac
cepted President Doumergue's invita
tion to try to accomplish what two
representatives of the Radical-Social
ists failed to do.
The successive failures of the two
Radical-Socialists to get a cabinet
that could command a sufficient ma
jority of the Chamber of Deputies,
has left the French political situation
in a state of chaos that has seldom
been equalled in the history of the
third French republic.
Minister of Interior
Tardieu has been Minister of the
Interior for the past 18 months in the
cabinets of Briand and Poincare. R is
the department which controls
France's police and nominates pre
fects for the 89 departments into
which the country is divided for ad
ministrative purposes. Hence it is an
invaluable ministry from a political
viewpoint because of the patronage
which it distributes and the effect
that this has on elections.
The first move that M. Tardieu
made after being invited to try to do
in the right center what the left cen
ter could not accomplish, was to call
upon M. Briand. It was noted that
both Daladier and Clementel visited
the former premier immediately after
being requested to form a cabinet and
observers are convinced that no mat
ter how the present confusion is re
solved, Briand will be back in his old
post at the foreign ministry.
