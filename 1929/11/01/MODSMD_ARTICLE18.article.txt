# BEARS ENTRAIN FOR SOUTH WITH HOPES OF STOPPING U.S.C.
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 31. (/P)â€” Ready
to tackle their most difficult task this
season, the Bears of California will
entrain tonight for their battle Satur
day against the Trojan clan of the
University of Southern California in
Los Angeles.
Without doubt, the Bear aggrega
tion this season is a much better or
ganization than that which held South
ern California to a scoreless tie a
year ago. Knowing the strength of the
Trojan eleven of last year, observers
declare that the present California
squad would be a favorite over the last
season's team. However, upsets will
occur, despite the efforts of rivals in
football, and the California Bears may
show strength as yet unrevealed.
Today the Trojans began their
tapering-off process after their long
scrimmage yesterday, which included
about everything Coach Jones could
think of. The scoreless tie of last sea
son, the only off-colored mark on a
season of victories, still rankles in
the minds of the coaching staff and
players alike, and Coach Jones has
been stressing the point in his train
ing talks this week.
