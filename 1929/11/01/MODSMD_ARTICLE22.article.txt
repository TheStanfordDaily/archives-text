# Card Frosh Gridmen Expect Tough Battle With St.Mary's Squad
## 
### Don Oswill 
"I'd rather we were meeting the
Cal-Tech varsity tomorrow than the
St. Mary's freshman football team,"
said Coach "Husky" Hunt, grid men
tor of the Cardinal yearlings. And the
baby Redshirts do have a whopping
big assignment in the undefeated
yearling eleven from Moraga.
After playing second fiddle to their
big brothers on the varsity all season,
the Cardinal freshmen are scheduled
to hold the limelight among the vari
ous contests to be played on the Farm
tomorrow despite the fact that they
are starting at the regular prelimi
nary time, 12:30 o'clock. The varsity's
set-up, and the unusual strength of
the Saint first-year team, all help to
focus the spot on the freshman con
test.
Last week the Moragans trounced
the St. Ignatius Reserves 19 to 0. The
Stanford Grays defeated the Gray Fog
eleven by a 20 to 0 count. "Pop" War
ner says that outside the Olympic
Club and U.S.C. his team has not gone
up against a stronger line than the
Gray's all season. So, draw your own
conclusions as to the strength of the
Saint team.
Bill Beasley, flashy Gael half, has
been the sensation of the team this
season. Beasley is a great open-field
runner, a dangerous passer, and a
consistent kicker. It was he who was
responsible for the Saint victory over
the California freshmen, by breaking
away for some long runs which paved
the way to a touchdown.
Wes Stevens, Card fullback, and
Ham Hedge, wing-man, are both on
the injured list at present, but are ex
pected to start tomorrow. Stevens has
been under the weather since the
game with the U.S.C. frosh, while
Hedge twisted his knee in the contest
with the U.C.L.A. peagreeners last
week.
Virg Choate will start his first game
at tackle position tomorrow. Choate
was playing at center, but Coach
Hunt thinks the large boy has the
makings of a great tackle. Bill Art
man has not shown up on the practice
field during the last week, and it is

said Coach "Husky" Hunt, grid men

away for some long runs which paved
the way to a touchdown.
Wes Stevens, Card fullback, and
Ham Hedge, wing-man, are both on
the injured list at present, but are ex
pected to start tomorrow. Stevens has
been under the weather since the
game with the U.S.C. frosh, while
Hedge twisted his knee in the contest
with the U.C.L.A. peagreeners last
week.
Virg Choate will start his first game
at tackle position tomorrow. Choate
was playing at center, but Coach
Hunt thinks the large boy has the
makings of a great tackle. Bill Art
man has not shown up on the practice
field during the last week, and it is
"I'd rather we were meeting the
Cal-Tech varsity tomorrow than the
St. Mary's freshman football team,"
said Coach "Husky" Hunt, grid men
tor of the Cardinal yearlings. And the
baby Redshirts do have a whopping
big assignment in the undefeated
yearling eleven from Moraga.
After playing second fiddle to their
big brothers on the varsity all season,
the Cardinal freshmen are scheduled
to hold the limelight among the vari
ous contests to be played on the Farm
tomorrow despite the fact that they
are starting at the regular prelimi
nary time, 12:30 o'clock. The varsity's
set-up, and the unusual strength of
the Saint first-year team, all help to
focus the spot on the freshman con
test.
Last week the Moragans trounced
the St. Ignatius Reserves 19 to 0. The
Stanford Grays defeated the Gray Fog
eleven by a 20 to 0 count. "Pop" War
ner says that outside the Olympic
Club and U.S.C. his team has not gone
up against a stronger line than the
Gray's all season. So, draw your own
conclusions as to the strength of the
Saint team.
Bill Beasley, flashy Gael half, has
been the sensation of the team this
season. Beasley is a great open-field
runner, a dangerous passer, and a
consistent kicker. It was he who was
responsible for the Saint victory over
the California freshmen, by breaking
away for some long runs which paved
the way to a touchdown.
