# POP SCOUTS U.C. WHILE RESERVES MEET GAL TECH
## Card Walk-Away Expected as Southern Engineers Have Failed to Show Strength Simkins' Passing Expected to Put Stanford on Grid Map For Remainder of Season 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Definitely deciding to keep most of
his regulars on the sidelines tomor
row, Coach Pop Warner made It
known before departing for Los An
geles last night that a team almost
entirely made up of second- and tliird
string players will start against the
Cal Tech Engineers. Pop, along with
Chuck Winterburn, assistant backfield
coach, left for the South after prac
tice to get an eye-ful of the Golden
Bear battling the Thundering Herd.
As the game is expected to be a
walk-away for the Cardinals, it will be
a good chance for the substitutes to
show just how well they can play
football. At the same time, Bill Sim
kins and Johnny Preston, who were
classed as regulars before the season
began, will be used to regain some of
their old-time form.
Simkins, Preston Injured
Both Simkins and Preston were in
jured in early practice contests and
need plentv of seasoning before the
Washington clash up at Seattle next
Saturday. Simkins, playing at full
back, is expected to put Stanford
back on the gridiron map during the
remainder of the year with his pig
skin-tossing.
Although the latter was way off
form last week against the Trojans
and most of his tosses were of the
lengthy wild type, he is really a fancy
passer when in the best of shape. It
must be remembered that Simkins had
only about one week of practice and
two minutes of actual play under his
belt before he was shoved into the
lineup on the 26th. Preston may find
it tough going to get back onto the
first team again, as Phil Neill has
been playing a bang-up game at his
wing position.
Stiff Signal Session
Yesterday afternoon Coach Warner
put his men through a stiff signal
session, and also drilled them hard
and long in running interference. Tiny
Thornhill, who will run the squad
from the bench tomorrow, is planning
to put the Cards through a light 3ignal
practice again this afternoon. Harlow
Rothert and Ray Dawson, both of
whom were slightly banged up in the
U.S.C. fracas, were out in suits yes
terday and will be ready for action
whenever needed.
Tomorrow's lineup as announced
last evening is as follows:
Cal Tech — Stanford —
Crawford LER Bush
Shuler LTR Bogue
Alderman LGR Bardin
Kuhn C Taylor
Brooks RGL Reynolds
Morris RTL Klabaix
Hayes REL Preston
Levine Q Hillman
Boyle (C) LHR Winnek

lengthy wild type, he is really a fancy
passer when in the best of shape. It
must be remembered that Simkins had
only about one week of practice and
two minutes of actual play under his
belt before he was shoved into the
lineup on the 26th. Preston may find
it tough going to get back onto the
first team again, as Phil Neill has
been playing a bang-up game at his
wing position.
Stiff Signal Session
Yesterday afternoon Coach Warner
put his men through a stiff signal
session, and also drilled them hard
and long in running interference. Tiny
Thornhill, who will run the squad
from the bench tomorrow, is planning
to put the Cards through a light 3ignal
practice again this afternoon. Harlow
Rothert and Ray Dawson, both of
whom were slightly banged up in the
U.S.C. fracas, were out in suits yes
terday and will be ready for action
whenever needed.
Tomorrow's lineup as announced
last evening is as follows:
Cal Tech — Stanford —
Crawford LER Bush
Shuler LTR Bogue
Alderman LGR Bardin
Kuhn C Taylor
Brooks RGL Reynolds
Morris RTL Klabaix
Hayes REL Preston
Levine Q Hillman
Boyle (C) LHR Winnek
Sturgess RHL Rintala
Dickey F Simkins
Definitely deciding to keep most of
his regulars on the sidelines tomor
row, Coach Pop Warner made It
known before departing for Los An
geles last night that a team almost
entirely made up of second- and tliird
string players will start against the
Cal Tech Engineers. Pop, along with
Chuck Winterburn, assistant backfield
coach, left for the South after prac
tice to get an eye-ful of the Golden
Bear battling the Thundering Herd.
As the game is expected to be a
walk-away for the Cardinals, it will be
a good chance for the substitutes to
show just how well they can play
football. At the same time, Bill Sim
kins and Johnny Preston, who were
classed as regulars before the season
began, will be used to regain some of
their old-time form.
Simkins, Preston Injured
Both Simkins and Preston were in
jured in early practice contests and
need plentv of seasoning before the
Washington clash up at Seattle next
Saturday. Simkins, playing at full
back, is expected to put Stanford
back on the gridiron map during the
remainder of the year with his pig
skin-tossing.
Although the latter was way off
form last week against the Trojans
and most of his tosses were of the
lengthy wild type, he is really a fancy
passer when in the best of shape. It
must be remembered that Simkins had
only about one week of practice and
two minutes of actual play under his
belt before he was shoved into the
lineup on the 26th. Preston may find
