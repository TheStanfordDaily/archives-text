THE KELLOGG PACT OF THE SOUTHERN CONFERENCE
The nations of the world have their Kellogg Peace Pact. The
Rotarians have their Code of Ethics. Stanford and the University of
California have their Good Will assemblies. But the latest fashion for
amity has been created in the southern part of the state, commonly known
as Los Angeles. A band of serious collegians, representing the institu
tions of the Southern Conference, met and wrote for posterity an Inter
collegiate Comity Pact.
With two "whereas-es" and six "resolves" they established "the
spirit of Inter-collegiate friendship and good will." The signers of this
solemn compact are "going to do everything in their power to further
promote this spirit of inter-collegiate friendship and co-operation." They
have decreed "that it shall be the policy of the several student bodies to
discountenance any form of rivalry leading to the destruction or deface
ment of any form of college property, or to anything that might lead to
ill-feeling or a breach of friendly relations between the colleges." In case
of any misunderstanding the offending schools have signed a pledge to
get together behind the woodshed and shake hands like two sheepish
schoolboys. Then to further impress the war-weary collegiate world of
their intent they "recommend and urge that this pact of inter-collegiate
comity may be read at least once during each semester to an assembly
of all students of each institution, hereto agreed, where such an assembly
is possible, and that it be published once each semester in the student
newspaper."
While the sincerity of the southern conference schools can not be
doubted, the question is at once raised of just what practical value are
these formal pacts in really abolishing friction between universities.
Rivalry between colleges is going to exist as long as the walls of the
universities stand. There may be some destruction of property because
over-zealous students let their patriotic enthusiasm get the better of them.
In the medieval "good old days" a sacred pact might have outlawed
unfriendly fights between schools. But now common sense dictates inter
collegiate relations, not a brief-case full of formal words.
