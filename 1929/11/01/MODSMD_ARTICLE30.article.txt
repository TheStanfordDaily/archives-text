# THE 						PLAY'S THE THING
## 
### 
Playgoers will tonight see the season's first offering of Stanford
dramatics, which in its own sphere ranks as high as Stanford football.
As a fitting vehicle for the talent of both actors and directors, A. A.
Milne's "The Ivory Door" will be presented here for the first time on
the Pacific Coast.
Besides opening the dramatic season, "The Ivory Door" will be the
initial play under the direction of Harold Helvenston, who in one year
won the respect and admiration of Stanford for his capable technical
stage direction. Thoroughly schooled in the drama at Yale, Helvenston's
achievements in his later undertaking should fully measure up to the
reputation he has already earned.
Frederick Stover, Helvenston's classmate at Yale, will also present his
first work as acting technical director at Stanford. His sets and lighting
will ofifer harmonious support to the drama.
Familiar campus actors and personalities new to the Stanford stage
will give a fresh performance through the interpretation of a new coach.
Harold Helvenston and Frederick Stover have our sincere good
wishes on their first presentation, and we confidently look forward to
another brilliant season of campus dramatics.
