Blatant political electioneering has hit the Stanford campus!
Freshman zealots, with no knowledge of the Stanford policy of quiet
elections, last night made nuisances of themselves by going about the
campus with shrieking auto horns and cheers to champion the cause of
a supposed candidate for a class office. The most offensive incident
occurred when they swarmed noisily into the lobby of Roble carrying
the candidate on their shoulders.
The man for whom they cheered has not been nominated for office,
and if the demonstrations were sincere, they were evidently meant to
elect the candidate by means of a write-in vote.
In order to prevent new students from getting a false notion of how
elections are carried on at Stanford, the Daily hastens to inform them
that public electioneering of a noisy variety is strictly frowned upon.
It is like wearing high-school pins.
