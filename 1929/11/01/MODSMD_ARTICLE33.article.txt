THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE
LOVE AFFAIR. By Andre Mau
rois. Appleton & Co., New York.
1929.
A great deal was expected from this
new book by Andre Maurois, the author
of "Disraeli," but unfortunately it falls
short of its requirements. This is Mau
rois' first and only attempt to write a
novel, and it looks as though he should
have continued to write biography.
"The Atmosphere of the Love AfTair"
is above all rather boring. Its presenta
tion is original enough. The first part of
the book is a long letter written by a man
to his fiancee. The last part is the diary
of the fiancee. The man, Phillippe, writes
of his first wife. His very lengthy letter
is nothing but an account of his intense
jealousy. He suspects every move of his
wife, Odile. Finally she does run away
with the other man and a divorce follows.
Phillippe still loves his wife, and her sub
sequent death by suicide nearly kills him.
He recovers sufficiently however to marry
again. The second wife is Isobel, to
whom the letter was written.
Now it is Isobel's turn to write. Her
diary, or rather reminiscences, are written
after Phillippe's death. Again it is noth
ing but an account of jealousy.
Jealousy! Why is this the favorite
topic of most of the modern French au

thors? It becomes rather dull after a
while to listen to account after account,
detail after detail of the jealousy of hus
bands for wives or vice-versa. This emo
tion is not one peculiar to the French na
tion; however, it is well on its way to
becoming a national characteristic because
of its great appeal to French authors.
There is no denying that Maurois
writes excellently. His style is easy and
fluent, he understands people; but here is
another book spoiled by its subject. The
eternal triangle only holds one's interest
when it presents some startling new angle.
In "The Atmosphere of the Love Affair"
there is no such angle; in fact there is
nothing new. There are hundreds of such
books gathering dust in the bookstores.
Many people who have read "Disraeli"
will wish to read the new book by the
same author. But it is the name that
Maurois has already made for himself
which will sell the book and not its own
value as good literature.
It seems a shame that a man who could
write such an excellent book as "Disraeli"
should turn out a book of the mediocrity
of "The Atmosphere of the Love Af
fair." It is to be hoped, however, that
Maurois will soon return to biography
or, if he must write a novel, produce one
that has a great deal more originality
than his last one.

eternal triangle only holds one's interest
when it presents some startling new angle.
In "The Atmosphere of the Love Affair"
there is no such angle; in fact there is
nothing new. There are hundreds of such
books gathering dust in the bookstores.
Many people who have read "Disraeli"
will wish to read the new book by the
same author. But it is the name that
Maurois has already made for himself
which will sell the book and not its own
value as good literature.
It seems a shame that a man who could
write such an excellent book as "Disraeli"
should turn out a book of the mediocrity
of "The Atmosphere of the Love Af
fair." It is to be hoped, however, that
Maurois will soon return to biography
or, if he must write a novel, produce one
that has a great deal more originality
than his last one.

THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE
LOVE AFFAIR. By Andre Mau
rois. Appleton & Co., New York.
1929.
A great deal was expected from this
new book by Andre Maurois, the author
of "Disraeli," but unfortunately it falls
short of its requirements. This is Mau
rois' first and only attempt to write a
novel, and it looks as though he should
have continued to write biography.
"The Atmosphere of the Love AfTair"
is above all rather boring. Its presenta
tion is original enough. The first part of
the book is a long letter written by a man
to his fiancee. The last part is the diary
of the fiancee. The man, Phillippe, writes
of his first wife. His very lengthy letter
is nothing but an account of his intense
jealousy. He suspects every move of his
wife, Odile. Finally she does run away
with the other man and a divorce follows.
Phillippe still loves his wife, and her sub
sequent death by suicide nearly kills him.
He recovers sufficiently however to marry
again. The second wife is Isobel, to
whom the letter was written.
Now it is Isobel's turn to write. Her
diary, or rather reminiscences, are written
after Phillippe's death. Again it is noth
ing but an account of jealousy.
Jealousy! Why is this the favorite
topic of most of the modern French au

thors? It becomes rather dull after a
while to listen to account after account,
detail after detail of the jealousy of hus
bands for wives or vice-versa. This emo
tion is not one peculiar to the French na
tion; however, it is well on its way to
becoming a national characteristic because
of its great appeal to French authors.
There is no denying that Maurois
writes excellently. His style is easy and
fluent, he understands people; but here is
another book spoiled by its subject. The
eternal triangle only holds one's interest
when it presents some startling new angle.
In "The Atmosphere of the Love Affair"
there is no such angle; in fact there is
nothing new. There are hundreds of such
books gathering dust in the bookstores.
