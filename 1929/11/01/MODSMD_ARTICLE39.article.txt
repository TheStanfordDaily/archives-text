CROWDS AND CREAM-PUFFS
Last Saturday the B.A.C.'s pride and
joy and money-maker, the big Stanford
Stadium, was crowded to overflowing.
Some 89,000 hilarious, howling, and
growling fans were packed into the bowl
like sardines in a can. Quite a number
of shiny coins jingled into the Board's
coffers on that occasion.
This week-end a similar kale-collecting
spectacle will take place down in the Tro
jan's cash register, when 80,000 odd grid
iron followers are stuffed between the
walls of the Coliseum.
At the same time the B.A.C.'s ticket
snatchers will be standing around twid
dling their thumbs to while away the
time. For tomorrow the Farm game spec
tators will be about as crowded as sar
dines in a vast ocean. Most of the stu
dents will not even heed their Master's
voice on this occasion.
In other words, the Cal Tech
football farce will be about as
much an attraction as a Tuesday
night lecture in the Assembly
Hall. Not quite, however, as
sometimes the unexpected hap
pens on Tuesday nights.
For the past two weeks the big Cardi
nal varsity has been practicing behind
barred fcnces. Tomorrow afternoon they
might as well padlock the Stadium gates.
Barnum was right when he said that
one was born every minute. People like
to be fooled. That's why they go to foot
ball games. Yet, it's well night impos
sible to get people to pay hard-earned
shekels for nothing at all!
Someone asked the other day why the
Cards didn't tangle with one of the in
tramural touch-tackle teams instead of
going to all the expense of shipping a lot
of studious Engineers up for the week
end. If the Engineers can't build dams
better than their forward wall, they are
a hopeless crew. So far this year they
have failed to check teams, no matter
how weak their offenses were. Even the
Whittier Poets severely chastised the Cal
Tech lads last week-end.
It is only too true that the Car
dinals need a much deserved rest
this Saturday after the hard bat
tle they went through on the
26th. But why play at all, as long
as the opponents are such a high
schoolish outfit? If the varsity
really needs a workout, it should
take on the Grays. The latter
boys would undoubtedly hand the
southern squad a severe thump
ing themselves.
All fooling aside, there are a large
number of students around this campus
that are anxious to sec the Stanford team
in action once more. But at the same
time, they desire a little amount of re
sistance at least.
And also the B.A.C.'s till could rake in
no small amount of money, for there is
no game of any importance in Northern
California tomorrow. If the B.A.C. had

only been wise enough to schedule some ;
j team like St. Ignatius!
There is one redeeming feature
on tomorrow's program, how
ever, and that is the Frosh's clash
with the junior Saints. This
game will be worth paying the
price of admission alone. But ev
eryone can rest assured that
85,000 or more of the 89,000 seats
will not be squatted on tomor
row !
