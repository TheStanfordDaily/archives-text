thought that he lias a broken rib. No
body seems to know for sure, and
with Choate in the game, Hunt has
not much cause for worry.
It is worth notice that at no time
during the season have identical
teams started for the frosh. Each i
week injuries, or notable playing by
some substitute, has caused Hunt to
change the starting line up. Tomorrow
will find a now man at right half for j
the Cards. Palmer showed up so well
as a ball-carrier against the Uclans
last week that Hunt will have a hard
time keeping him off the team in the
future. Johnny Corbus at guard, and I
1 Pete Donliu at end, are also expected
' to break into the contest tomorrow,
i Paul Targhetta has fought bis way
back into the quarterback position on
the freshman team. This husky red- i
head did some nice work during the
scrimmages this week, looking parti
cularly good on lateral pass plays.
Hunt has improved the offense of
the Card frosh, but tomorrow will see
them against another powerful team,
with the probability of spending most
of the time on the defense. The
psychological effect of facing one
strong team after another with never
an easy contest between is alone
enough to put a team on the defense
before the game starts.
The probable line-up tomorrow will
be:
Stanford — St. Mary's—
Hedge LBR Vivaldi
McKey LTR Pasch
Kite LGR Zolg
Bates C Rubel
Scribner RGL Collins j
Choate RTL Mace j
I Tway REL Baker:
i Targhetta Q Miller
