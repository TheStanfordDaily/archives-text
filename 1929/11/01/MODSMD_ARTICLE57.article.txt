# R.O.T.C. Building Equipped With New Casting Machine
## 
### 
Installation of much new machinery
in the R.O.T.C. building this quarter
is announced by Captain I. A. Luke of
the Military Department. Among the
new equipment is a grinding machine,
a power hacksaw, a heavy duty verti
cal drill press, and a bench type sensi
tive drill press, all this machinery
being electrically driven. Any one of
the instruments can be operated inde
pendently of all the other machines
in the shop, according to Captain
Luke.
A centrifugal casting machine for
casting steel shells has been designed
and constructed by the Stanford
metal shops and will be installed in
the near future. Excavation of a pit
for it has recently been completed
near the shop furnace so that molten
metal can easily be run into it.
