## 
### 
Again the San Jose State Teachers'
College soccer squad triumphed over the
Stanford Babes in a hard-fought game on
the home field yesterday afternoon. But
this time the yearlings held the invaders
to a 2-0 score, which is a big improvement
over the 5-0 defeat that the San Jose
eleven administered them in the last game.
Bud Taylor of the Teachers' College
was the outstanding player on the field,
exhibiting marvelous footwork and con
trol. As before, Washburn, center half,
and Breklebaum, goalie, were the main
stays of the Stanford defense. The babes'
forward wall is still weak and will have
to improve if they are to come out ahead
in their game with the California frosh
two weeks from Saturday.
