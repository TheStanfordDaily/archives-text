# Groups Must Sign Up Now For Intramural Football
## 
### 
All groups desiring to play intra
mural touch football must post their
entries in Encina gym by six o'clock
tonight. Teams will be segregated into
leagues and a schedule of games
drawn up over the week-end. This
sport will be handled in the same man
ner as intramural basketball, i.e., each
team will play every other team in
its division, and the winners will
meet in an elimination tournament to
determine the college champions.
Yesterday twenty-one groups had
indicated their desire to engage in
this sport.
