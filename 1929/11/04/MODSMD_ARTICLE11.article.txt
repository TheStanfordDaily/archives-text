# CARD SOCCER ELEVEN LOSES FAST GAME TO OLYMPIC CLUB TEAM
## 
### 
By scoring a goal in the last few
seconds of play with a beautiful 25-
yard kick, the powerful Olympic Club
soccer team broke a 2-2 tie to eke out
a victory over an equally strong Stan
ford varsity eleven by a one-point
margin on the Cardinal field Saturday
afternoon.
The game was a bang-up affair all
the way through, being featured by
superb offensive play of the club team
forwards, the inside right in particu
lar, and the defensive work of the
Stanford backs, Captain Herb Mayer
and Wittausch. Eberhard displayed
his usual flashy passing and kicking
and was the main cog in the Card
offense.
The city aggregation started the
scoring early in the first half by work
ing the ball down the field by a series
of short passes where the center for
ward side-kicked into the net. From
then on until almost the end of the
period, the ball was kept in the mid
dle of the field with neither team get
ting close enough to score. With the
half nearly over, the Olympics again
worked the ball down the field where
the inside right scored.
Stanford opened the second half
with a fast offense, taking the ball
into Olympic territory and keeping it
there. Eberhard made the first Card
goal by receiving a perfect corner
kick from O'Donnell and driving it
into the net. The second varsity score
was made shortly after when Vallenga
followed up a shot made by Toepke
which the club goalie failed to clear
completely.
The winning point was scored by
a long kick directly in front of the
goal, with but a few seconds to play.
