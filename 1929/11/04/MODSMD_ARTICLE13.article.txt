# 'Ivory Door' Cast Shows Unity and Artistry In Play
## Milne Symbolisms Handled Well by Helvenston; Fantasy Difficult 
### A. H 
Harold Helvenston scored an un
doubted success in his first produc
tion of the year, "The Ivory Door" by
A. A. Milne, presented in the Assem
bly Hall Friday evening. Helven
ston's directing, aided by a strong
cast, fine settings and costumes, and
a clever play, combined to provido an
evening of real ontertainment.
"The Ivory Door" is the type of
play about which there can be much
difference of opinion. "Too frothy,"
some will say; others will consider it
artistic, finished. In Helvenston's
production, the subtle implications of
symbolism were well handled; the
play seemed unified, artistic.
Type Characters
The characters drawn by Milne are
not intended, it may be assumed, to
be real humans; rather they repre
sent types of people. It is perhaps
for this reason that, while the acting
was unusually good, the characters
were not altogether convincing. They
seemed to be acting, not living and
feeling, their parts. In this respect
the play lacked some of the polish
given to productions by Gordon Da
vis; but again, perhaps this was an
inevitable result of the fantasy of
the play.
Paul Speegle surprised those who
had seen him only before the rooting
section or in comedy parts by his
ability to portray the philosophical
king, and to maintain, with only a few
let-downs, the characterization.
Rosenblatt High Point
Irving Rosenblatt made the char
acter and the symbolism of the chan
cellor clear and to the point; his act
ing was one of the high points of the
play. Lucille Morgan showed skill in
a difficult part, as did also Arthur
Hurt as "Old Beppo." Stanley Mul
lin as "Brand" was entirely satisfy
ing.
The two children —especially young
Lloyd Wilson —showed assurance and
poise on the stage; their acting was
a relief after that of several juveniles
seen recently in talkies at Palo Alto.
And lastly, the "castlefolk," so neces
sary to the symbolism of the play,
came through in truly professional
style.
The costumes and settings—espe
cially the latter —were well up to the
standard of previous Stanford produc
tions. The lighting effects of the
scene outside the palace walls were
skilfully worked out.

A. A. Milne, presented in the Assem
bly Hall Friday evening. Helven
ston's directing, aided by a strong
cast, fine settings and costumes, and
a clever play, combined to provido an
evening of real ontertainment.
"The Ivory Door" is the type of
play about which there can be much
difference of opinion. "Too frothy,"
some will say; others will consider it
artistic, finished. In Helvenston's
production, the subtle implications of
symbolism were well handled; the
play seemed unified, artistic.
Type Characters
The characters drawn by Milne are
not intended, it may be assumed, to
be real humans; rather they repre
sent types of people. It is perhaps
for this reason that, while the acting
was unusually good, the characters
were not altogether convincing. They
seemed to be acting, not living and
feeling, their parts. In this respect
the play lacked some of the polish
given to productions by Gordon Da
vis; but again, perhaps this was an
inevitable result of the fantasy of
the play.
Paul Speegle surprised those who
had seen him only before the rooting
section or in comedy parts by his
ability to portray the philosophical
king, and to maintain, with only a few
let-downs, the characterization.
Rosenblatt High Point
Irving Rosenblatt made the char
acter and the symbolism of the chan
cellor clear and to the point; his act
ing was one of the high points of the
play. Lucille Morgan showed skill in
a difficult part, as did also Arthur
Hurt as "Old Beppo." Stanley Mul
lin as "Brand" was entirely satisfy
ing.
The two children —especially young
Lloyd Wilson —showed assurance and
poise on the stage; their acting was
a relief after that of several juveniles
seen recently in talkies at Palo Alto.
And lastly, the "castlefolk," so neces
sary to the symbolism of the play,
came through in truly professional
style.
The costumes and settings—espe
cially the latter —were well up to the
standard of previous Stanford produc
tions. The lighting effects of the
scene outside the palace walls were
skilfully worked out.
Harold Helvenston scored an un
doubted success in his first produc
tion of the year, "The Ivory Door" by
A. A. Milne, presented in the Assem
