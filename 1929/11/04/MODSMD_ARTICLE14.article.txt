# DAVID STARR JORDAN RECEIVES PRAISE FOR WORLD PEACE EFFORT
## 
### 
"One who throughout his life has
battled for a warless world" is the
woy in which Dr. David Starr Jordan,
chancellor emeritus of Stanford was
described when the officers and dele
gates attending the annual meeting
of the National Council for the Pre
vention of War sent a telegram to
him last Thursday night.
"We extend to you our affectionate
greeting," the message read. "We
trust you will long be spared to enjoy
the day of universal peace, the dawn
of which you have been the modern
prophet and herald."
The knowledge that his work for
peace is not only recognized, but is
being carried on throughout the world,
cheers and comforts Dr. Jordan in the
illness which prevents him from
carrying on the activities that have
filled his life, says Mrs. Jordan.
