# CARD BABES OUTPLAY ST. MARY'S FRESHMEN BUT ARE BEATEN 7-6
## 
### 
Failure to stop a St. Mary's aerial
attack, started late in the third quar
ter, spelled defeat for the Stanford
lreshman football team by a score of
7 to 6 here Saturday. The Card year
lings clearly outplayed the highly
touted Gaels during every period but
the third, scoring their touchdown in
the second quarter on a power drive.
A twenty-yard run by Ken Affler
baugh coupled with two penalties on
the Saints gave Stanford the ball on
her own thirty-yard line. Here the
Cards attempted a forty-yard pass
which was knocked by a Gael back into
the arms of Targhetta, Card quarter
back, giving Stanford the ball, deep
in St. Mary's territory. A lateral pass,
Targhetta to Afflerbaugh, carried the
pigskin to the Saint three-yard mark.
Stevens punched the line for two
yards, and Afflerbaugh took the ball
over on a reverse play. Stevens failed
to convert, the ball going wide of the
standards.
After being stopped cold on at
tempted scrimmage plays, the Saint
'captains' opened up the third period
with a dazzling passing attack. Two
long tosses, Beasly throwing and Bro
velli receiving both, netted a touch
down for the Gaels. Beasly place
kicked for the extra and deciding
point.
Without a doubt, St. Mary's was
the greatest off-side team to be seen
here yet. The Saints were nicked for
75 yards in penalties for being offside,
and with an additional 30 for holding,
presented the Cards with a grand
total of 105 yards.
For some unknown reason the game
was late in starting, and the last
quarter was cut to four minutes so
that the varsity contest could start in
time. This time cut broke up a per
fectly good Stanford offensive that
might have culminated in another
touchdown, as the Cards had just
made a first down in Gael territory
when the final gun was shot.
Afflerbaugh, Stevens, Palmer, and
Targhetta showed up well in the Card
backfield, while Choate and Artman
starred in the line. Beasley and Bro
velli were the mainstays for the
Saints.

the greatest off-side team to be seen
here yet. The Saints were nicked for
75 yards in penalties for being offside,
and with an additional 30 for holding,
presented the Cards with a grand
total of 105 yards.
For some unknown reason the game
was late in starting, and the last
quarter was cut to four minutes so
that the varsity contest could start in
time. This time cut broke up a per
fectly good Stanford offensive that
might have culminated in another
touchdown, as the Cards had just
made a first down in Gael territory
when the final gun was shot.
Afflerbaugh, Stevens, Palmer, and
Targhetta showed up well in the Card
backfield, while Choate and Artman
starred in the line. Beasley and Bro
velli were the mainstays for the
Saints.
Failure to stop a St. Mary's aerial
attack, started late in the third quar
ter, spelled defeat for the Stanford
lreshman football team by a score of
7 to 6 here Saturday. The Card year
lings clearly outplayed the highly
touted Gaels during every period but
the third, scoring their touchdown in
the second quarter on a power drive.
A twenty-yard run by Ken Affler
baugh coupled with two penalties on
the Saints gave Stanford the ball on
her own thirty-yard line. Here the
Cards attempted a forty-yard pass
which was knocked by a Gael back into
the arms of Targhetta, Card quarter
back, giving Stanford the ball, deep
in St. Mary's territory. A lateral pass,
Targhetta to Afflerbaugh, carried the
pigskin to the Saint three-yard mark.
Stevens punched the line for two
yards, and Afflerbaugh took the ball
over on a reverse play. Stevens failed
to convert, the ball going wide of the
standards.
After being stopped cold on at
tempted scrimmage plays, the Saint
'captains' opened up the third period
with a dazzling passing attack. Two
long tosses, Beasly throwing and Bro
velli receiving both, netted a touch
down for the Gaels. Beasly place
kicked for the extra and deciding
point.

75 yards in penalties for being offside,
