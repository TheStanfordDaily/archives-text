# CARDS BEAT CAL TECH IN RAGGED, LISTLESS SET-UP
## Trojan Defeat in Southland Gives Varsity New Lease On Life; Nothing to Lose Washington Will Be Threat In Spite of Past Scores With Other Coast Teams 
### Stephen Dietrich 
After pushing over the Cal Tech
Engineers on Saturday in the most
listless, uninteresting game seen
around these parts in years, the Stan
ford football varsity will settle down
this afternoon to a week of intensi
fied practice for the Washington clash
at Seattle this coming week-end.
With the news of the Trojan upset
at the hands of the California Bears,
the Cards are beginning to snap out
of it again and show a new lease on
life. For from now on Stanford has
everything to gain and nothing to
lose, and by winning the two remain
ing Conference games still has a good
chance of tying for Coast title honors.
Huskies Not So Easy
The first of these two remaining
hurdles is likely to prove plenty tough,
as the Huskies are always hard to
down in their northern lair. Playing
on the rockbound, mudsplashed Seat
tle field will probably handicap the
Cards in working their spin plays, re
verses, and laterals. It always has in
years gone by, and those who saw
or read about the Stanford-Washing
ton battle two years ago will remem
ber what a hard time the Redshirts
had in eking out a close victory.
As for the game with Cal Tech,
about all one can do is to utter with
feeble hilarity: "What a game!
What a spectacle!" Some 1000-odd
fans fought their way into the big
bowl to witness the St. Mary's-Frosh
battle, and then, being too lazy to
move, leaned back in their seats to
view a hectic touch tackle contest.
Regulars Rest
The regular Redshirts, with the ex
ception of Johnny Preston and Herb
Fleishhacker, had orders from Coach
Pop Warner, who went South to scout
the Cal-U.S.C. game, to rest up over
the week-end and several of them
were not even out in suits. Evidently
the subs that played against the En
gineers thought that the orders were
for them to rest also, for they went
through the entire game without
showing the least bit of pep, fire, or
ambition.
In fact, the Cards only displayed
some slow motion punch in the first
two minutes of play, when they car
ried the ball on seven plays to a
touchdown. After that episode, the
only exciting event of the day was
when a nozzle on one of the water
carts broke.
Interference Poor
Two outstanding weaknesses, be
sides the lack of pep, were ever pres
ent. Running interference was espe
cially poor, and the ball-carriers got
by the line of scrimmage on their own
efforts alone. It seemed as though the
guards were not merely resting, but
really fast asleep on the job. Another
bad feature was the wx*estling tactics
of certain players. Four times the
Cards were penalized fifteen yards
for holding.
The playing of several men was
pretty fair at times, however. Rudy
Rintala showed up as well as anyone
on the field, and several times broke
away for nice gains. Crary and Murphy
also displayed flashes at toting the
pigskin, while Moffatt looked good
while he was in the game.
