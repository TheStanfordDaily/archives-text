# ONE JOKE IS ENOUGH

California having accomplished the impossible by defeating the much
vaunted Trojan Horde, the Big Game looms as one of the greatest
battles in many moons. For the first time since 1924, California will
enter the game as a favorite. But Stanford supporters see in the contest
an opportunity to regain prestige lost in the U.S.C. game.
Naturally enough spirit will mount high at both institutions, and
inter-university rivalry will be at its peak. At this point will be intro
duced a ridiculous and futile gesture â€”the "good-will" assembly with
exchange speakers at both colleges. The utter foolishness of the assem
blies can easily be demonstrated.
On the day following the proposed assembly both universities will
hold rallies, the theme of which will be directly opposite that of the
"good-will" meetings. Stanford will say, "Get the bearskins!" California
will give "oskies" and threaten to devour the Cardinal team. All good,
clean fun, as it should be.
Intensity of rivalry is the factor that makes the Big Game the breath
taking thriller that it is. And the rivalry has always been of the friendly,
gentlemanly sort. Why, then, hold "good-will" assemblies? The very
name gives a false notion to outsiders that such a feeling does not exist
and that the meetings are necessary to enforce the spirit.
Stanford would like to defeat California just as much as California
would like to defeat Stanford. No one would have that deep-rooted
feeling otherwise. So why waste time and patience to repeat the farcial
gesture held before the U.S.C. game?
