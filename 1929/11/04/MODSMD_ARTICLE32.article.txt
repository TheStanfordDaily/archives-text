# PERSONALITY PLUS

Modern colleges are apparently convinced that anything can be
taught, and that most things should be. "Freshmen Seek the Secret of a
Winning Way," announces The McGill Daily, and there follows a lengthy
description of a course in which "the theme that will underlie everything
we say is capitalizing your personality." The learned doctor in charge of
the course informed his students in his introductory lecture that the
trouble with most people is that "they don't let the light of their souls
shine through," and that "the soul is the personality."
Facts such as these should not be withheld from the aspiring fresh
men. As long as colleges remain a training-ground for bond salesmen,
pep, personality, and punch will be vital qualities in undergraduates. If a
sufficient number of personality courses were taken by a sufficient number
of colleges, the world would overflow with ostentatious charm, forced
good-will, and strained smiles. This would comprise the desired person
ality-by-acquisition. McGill is indeed to be congratulated as a leader in
the 20th century education for industry.
