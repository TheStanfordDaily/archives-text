# GIVE DRAMATICS A BOOST
## 
### 
Campus playgoers were given a delightful treat Friday night when
they saw "The Ivory Dbor," presented for the first time on the I'acilic
Coast. For those who failed to take in the initial production of the
season, they will have to believe us in saying it was one of the most
professional plays to be given in the uncomfortable and barn-like As
sembly Hall.
One of the reasons for the success of "The Ivory Door" was the
colossal amount of work and energy expended on it from the director
down to the publicity agent. It seems an extravagant waste of time for
more than fifty people to work three weeks for an objective that goes up
in smoke in three hours. Even the Dig Game fire lasts eight hours.
Stanford dramatics have an enviable reputation. They have pulled
themselves by their own merit above the class of mushy "amateur thea
tricals." While the practicability does not warrant a second performance
in the Assembly Hall, there is no argument against giving Stanford pro
ductions a second time in ofl-campus playhouses.
With the ever-popular Big Game "Gaieties" looming as the next
effort, Ralph Campiglia, dramatic manager, and his cohorts, would be
giving Stanford dramatics a tremendous boost by chartering a theatre in
San Francisco or Oakland for a second performance. There arc enough
alumni in the Bay Region, who would like to compare the "Gaieties" of
a generation ago with that put on by the "moderns," to provide a well
filled house. It should be at least worth trying.
