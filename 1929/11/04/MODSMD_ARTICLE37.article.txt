MONKS ARE MONKS, by George
Jean Nathan. Alfred A. Knopf, 1929.
Alcove Book Shop.
This book should have been
called "What George Jean Nathan
thinks about contemporary world af
fairs." But if this had been done very
few people would have taken the time
to even look at the book. So George
Jean called his book "Monks Are
Monks," and put his personal opin
ions into the mouths of various male
characters.
"Monks Are Monks" is a diagnostic
scherzo, and a scherzo, according to
the oft-mentioned Webster, is a play
ful movement in music. When you
read the book you will see why scher
zo is the word. Nathan skips merrily
from subject to subject, calling an
axe and axe, and sparing no person
alities in his rather scathing com
ments on most of the main points of
life in America today. England and
France come in for their share of the
beating also, but only so far as they
affect America.
There is of course a sex angle in
the book. In fact it goes further
than the Methodist Church might per
mit. Lorinda Hope is a young woman
tired of being a virgin. Lorinda pro
vides the narrative part of the book,
and the men that she meets provide
the diagnostic criticism, for which
purpose the book was written.
This criticism, which always shows
George Jean Nathan at his best, is
really good; and it covers everything
from the rather ill-famed house in
the gas-house district to the society
with which Mrs. Vanderbilt is asso
ciated. Sometimes one wonders if
Nathan means all he says, but, on the
whole, one realizes that there is a
great deal of real constructive criti
cism put forth.
But to return to Lorinda. Six men
are dragged into her life. One by one
they bore her to death with their per-

I sonal opinion about this and that; one
! by one they drink up her liquor, and,
I in the end, Lorinda is still the rather
j sad possessor of the flower of her
maidenhood. And so she enters a
! convent.
The hook ends here, and why
1 shouldn't it? Lorinda is gone, George
Jean is out of opinions, and the read
;er is perhaps just a little tired of
hearing too many sarcastic comments
about this thing we proudly call the
United States.

"OUR MODERN MAIDENS" — New
Stanford.
The difference between a modern
moral and an immoral modern —if you
are not sure on this point, Joan Craw
ford's version as it appears in "Our
j Modern Maidens" will help you out.
j This show has thrills, pep, and
j beauty; or to put it another way, it
, has Joan Crawford and Anita Page.
Joan as a star in her own right is
| about as dazzling as it is possible for
| anybody to be, and Anita Page is
' very, very lovely.
j Douglas Fairbanks is a let-down in
j the tenser moments because he over
: acts, but he redeems himself in a
little individual vaudeville in which
he takes off his famous father and
other screen notables with really
superb art.
As a millionaire's daughter who has
known nothing but adulation and suc
cess all her'life, Miss Crawford makes
| a magnificently gallant gesture for
the sake of her fiance, that instead
of bringing them happiness leads them
both into a hopeless tangle. Audiences
i that are accustomed to seeing such
; tangles work out in the end so that
| they live happily ever after," are
! guaranteed to be surprised. It finally
' does work out, of course, but it is a
hundred to one odds that you won't
foresee the end. —M. L. R.
