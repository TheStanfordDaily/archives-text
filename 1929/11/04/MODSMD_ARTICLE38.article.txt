## "IT'S ALL RIGHT, FELLOWS" 
### 
The Editor, Sir: i
It's all right, fellows, I've been to j
as many football games as you have,
Maybe more. And no one is a better
sport than I am. But I see no reason
why a gentleman should not always j
maintain gentlemanly conduct. "
I did not say that everyone should
make the sign of the cross at every
play. Wholesome fun should be in- ;
dulged in at intervals. I did not say j
of the Sunday School sort. I did not j

say of the tavern sort. And there are
times when a fellow may throw c.ff all
unreasonable restraint. I did not say
otherwise.
Don't get it into your heads that I
am trying to change anyone. It can't
be done. You may put clothes on a
jackass, but he'll be a jackass still,
It may be that obscenity is one of
the Stanford traditions. If it is, I was
mistaken and I beg your pardon,
â€”'31 Law.
