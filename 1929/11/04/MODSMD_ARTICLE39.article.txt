# THANKS FOR THE CORRECTION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
I beg to call your attention to the
picture printed on page three of the
Daily October 31, 1920, purporting to
be Larry Westervveller, the man who
pulled a "Riegels" last Saturday in
the Oregon-Washington game. The
young fellow is NOT Westerweller,

i but Paul Jessup, captain and tackle
ion the Washington varsity, who
stands six feet seven, and is not
guilty of the act described under the
picture. Hope you will see fit to cor
rect this error, I remain,
Yours truly,
Washington Alum, '29.
