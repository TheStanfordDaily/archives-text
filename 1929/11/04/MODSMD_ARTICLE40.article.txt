The Editor, Sir:
May I make so bold as to suggest
that the Daily is too noisy a sheet? It
is distinctly audible, even from the
extreme rear of the classroom. Al
though I invariably take up a posi
tion in the last chair of the last row,
and make every effort to turn the
pages silently, the feat is possible
only on rainy mornings. I can think
of only two remedies to this distres

, sing situation: as the editorial sec
i tion is the most interesting of all, it
might be well to print the first page
i inside the paper, on page two, now
occupied by editorials, and print the
I second page on page one, if you know
what I mean. A second alternative
would be to use damp paper exclu
sively, or to adapt some other shape
more suited to classroom conditions.
Sincerely,
