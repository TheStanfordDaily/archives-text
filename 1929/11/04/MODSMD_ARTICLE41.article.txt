# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD...

FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF
NOVEMBER 4, 1904
The Stanford chapter of Phi Beta
Kappa was organized on November 4
by the authority of the Eighth Tri
ennial Council of the United Chapters
as the Beta Chapter of California.
Among the charter members were Dr.
Elliott and Professors Fairclough and
Seward. Phi Beta Kappa is the oldest
Greek letter fraternity in America
and was founded in 177G at William
and Mary College in Virginia.
Two new chemical engines of the
"Stemple" type arrived on the cam
pus. One is to be placed at the fire
house and the other somewhere near
the Quad. The engines were mounted
on two wheel trucks and pulled by
hand, as was the rest of the campus
fire equipment.
The varsity held its last practice
preparatory to the Stanford-Utah Ag
gie game. Only four out of seventeen
players on the Utah team were en
tirely uninjured, while no man on the
Card squad was on the sick list.

Negotiations for a post-season foot
| ball game between Stanford and Wis
j consin failed. Stanford had a game
already scheduled with Colorado, and
! the authorities did not favor another
game because they feared it would
interfere with the scholastic work of
the players.
Arrangements were made to run
| special trains from Stanford to the
! Republican rally to be held in San
Jose November 4. Transportation for
i over 400 students was secured by R.
;C. McComish, '03, president of the
j Stanford Republican Club.
