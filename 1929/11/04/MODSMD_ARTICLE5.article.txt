### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3.
tary Stimson, who will head the Amer
ican delegation to the five-power Na
val Conference meeting in London in
January, has begun active prepara
tions for the conferences he will have
with the members of the Japanese
delegation when they arrive in Wash
ington next month on their way to
the British Capital.
Two of the most important ques
tions to be taken up at the confer
ence —the ratio between the Japanese
Navy and the American and British
navies and the policy of naval reduc
tion —are expected to be discussed at
the meetings between members of the
two missions in Washington.
Meeting fmportant
Secretary Stimson regards the
meetings in Washington with the
Japanese as an opportunity to talk
over various unsettled questions re
lating to the two navies before the
conference meets.
It is generally expected by Ameri
can naval circles that the Japanese
will enter the London conference an
ticipating a 10-10-7 ratio between the
American, British, and Japanese
navies rather than the 5-5-3 ratio es
tablished for capital ships at the
Washington conference.
