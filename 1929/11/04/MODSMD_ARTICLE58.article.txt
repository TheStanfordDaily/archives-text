# MURAL GOLF TOURNEY ENTERS SEMI-FINALS TODAY AT BERESFORD
## 
### 
With the championship round in
the offing, high-class play is expected
in the two semi-final battles of the
intramural golf tournament to be held
at Beresford this afternoon beginning
at 1:15. In what will perhaps bo the
feature match of the entire tourney,
Rea and Thompson, Encina lE, meet
Carlsmith and Esberg, Breakers. On
the basis of play bo far, Rea and
Thompson may be conceded a slight
edge; but the Breakers, finalists in
last year's tournament, have yet to
shoot the best golf of which they are
capable, and have an excellent chance
of upsetting the Encina pair.
In the other semi-final match Mc-
Naugliton and Eberhardt, Doolittle
Independents, will play Butts and Al
len of Delta Kappa Epsilon. Should
McNaughton, who numbers among
his past conquests "Doc" Willing, na
tional amateur finalist, continue the
consistent play which has marked
him so far as the individual star of
the tournament, the Dekes will have
a hard fight to enter the final round.
The date of the championship
match has not as yet been definitely
set, but will be sometime this week.
A trophy is offered the winning team,
and the defeated finalists will be con
soled with an award of a dozen golf
balls.
