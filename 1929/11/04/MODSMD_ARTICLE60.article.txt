# STANFORD GRAYS WIN SLOW CONTEST FROM SAN JOSE GRID TEAM
## 
### 
In a game that gave most of the
substitutes a chance to show their
wares, the Stanford Grays defeated
the San Jose State Teachers Spartan'
football team at the Stadium Satur
day by a score of 25 to 6.
The Spartans were outplayed from
start to finish, and scored their only
touchdown in the final minutes of the
fourth quarter after a long pass and
a series of penalties against the Stan
ford team had put them within the
five-yard line. It was the first touch
down that has been registered against
the strong Gray defense this season.
The first score came in the first
quarter when Portal, playing aafety
for the Spartans, unwisely caught a
punt on the three-yard line with a
flock of Stanford players on top of
him. Colvin threw him in his tracks,
and when the Spartans attempted to
punt out of danger, the ball went
straight up and was caught on the
Spartan seven-yard line by Ketron of
the Grays. Baker then bucked two
yards, and Lambert went over on a
reverse from Baker.
Long passes from Gilbert to Colvin
and Hand, ends, and a number of good
reverses by Lambert put the bail over
three more times for the Grays.
George Grey, the big tackle, had an
off day and was able to convert but
one of the four attempted kicks after
touchdowns. An attempted field goal
by Grey from the forty-yard marker
went true but fell directly in front
of the posts.
