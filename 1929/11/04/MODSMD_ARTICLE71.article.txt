NORFOLK, Va., Nov. 3. (/P) â€”Lost
in the clouds with his fuel supply
running low, Ensign George P. Hat
field, pilot of the naval seaplane re
ported missing Saturday night on a
flight from Philadelphia to Norfolk,
landed his plane alongside the Com
modore Rollins, Norwegian fruit
steamer, 15 miles off the Virginia
Capes, Saturday night shortly after
7 o'clock.
Since the rescue steamer had no
wireless, news of the safety of the
missing plane and its occupants was
first received at the Hampton Roads
naval air station early this morning
when five searching planes, which
shoved off from the local air station
at dawn, sighted the steamer with the
missing plane in tow.
