# FRESHMEN PREPARE FOR CONTEST WITH CALIFORNIA ELEVEN
## 
### 
After making a very creditable
showing against the strong St. Mary's
yearlings, the Stanford freshman foot
ball team is now working for its final
contest of the year, the Little Big
Game with California. The fine brand
of football shown by the frosh Satur
day puts them on even terms with
the Bear first-year men.
The Gaels defeated the California
frosh by a score of 6 to 0, and the
Stanford babes by a 7 to 6 count. They
made their touchdown against Cal
by straight power plays, but against
the Cards were forced to resort to an
aerial attack, culminating in a forty
yard pass over the goal line.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's baby Red
shirts have developed an effective de
fense against line plays. The two
husky tackles, Choate and Artman,
have improved with every game, and
the Saint backs gained very few yards
over them. This week Hunt will con
centrate on a passing defense so as
not to allow a repetition of last week's
contest.
Offensively, the Cards have two
flashy backs, AfTlerbaugh and Palmer,
who look particularly good on reverse
plays. Stevens is a reliable line-backer,
and his ability to run interference has
improved materially during the last
few games.
