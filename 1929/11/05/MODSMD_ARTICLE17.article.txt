# A.W.S. VOCATIONAL SURVEY REVEALS MAJORITY PREFERS WRITING FIELD
## 
### 
Approximately one-sixth of the
Stanford women plan to enter the
field of writing, according to the re
sults of the survey just completed by
the Associated Women Students' Vo
cational Guidance Committee. Aiming
to discover in what occupations the
most interest was felt by the women
students, the committee distributed
blanks last week on which were listed
seventeen general types of work with
specific subdivisions. Each woman
asked to indicate her first, second,
and third choices.
Education Choice of 79
A summary of this investigation
shows that 86 of the women are most
interested in writing, which includes
fiction, non-fiction, newspaper work,
periodical writing, publishing and
editing, and translation. School work
follows closely, 79 choosing it as a
vocation, and art, subdivided into
architecture, commercial art, dancing,
dress design, gardening, Interior deco

rating. Stage art is preferred by 78
women. Ranking next is business,
then drama, professions, diplomatic
work, social service, personnel work,
scientific, music, library, politics, tour
guidance, home economics, and mu
seum work. Public lecturing and read
ing is the only group listed in which
none of the women are interested.
Museum work is chosen by only 2 and
home economics, which 50 years ago
would have been the choice of half
of the women, is preferred by 5 of
"the 600."
Plan Vocational Meet
Upon the basis of this survey speak
ers are being chosen for the Women's
Vocational Conference to be held on
the campus during winter quarter.
The Vocational Committee has al
ready decided on the speakers who
will discuss the five leading interests,
writing, school work, art, bualuess,
and drama, and it is probable that
there will be talks on other occupa
tions as well.
