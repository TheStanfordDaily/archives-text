# ARRESTED FRESHMAN BLAMES BETTING FOR HIS DELINQUENT ACTS
## 
### 
Arrested last Saturday on a charge
of check forging, a Stanford freshman
yesterday blamed campus betting and
I)ooling as the reason for his acts, ac
cording to Chief of Police Zink, who
has charge of the student at the Palo
Alto police station.
The student was taken into custody
following a charge made by a local
bank. He had forged over $100 on
two banks, using good checks as sam
ples, Zink said. According to his con
fession, the freshman had placed that
amount in a pool on the U.S.C. game,
covering the bet with worthless
checks.
Zink said that, according to his es
timation, the boy was of good char
acter. "As far as we have been able
to find out, his past has been blame
less. He has a fine high-school record
and held many offices in high-school
activities," the chief said.
