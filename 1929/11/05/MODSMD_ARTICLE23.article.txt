# WAR PLAY WILL BE READ TONIGHT
## 
### 
"Journey's End," R. C. Sherriff's
war play, characterized as a "photo
graph snapped when no one was pos
ing," will be read by Mrs. Guy Ste
vens Farrington in the Assembly Hall
this evening at 7:30 o'clock. This play
is a picture of actual life during the
war, realistic, but uncolored by propa
ganda.
Sherriff wrote "Journey's End" for
an amateur organization of which he
was a member. Someone casually sug
gested that he take It to a profes
sional producer. It had an instant suc
cess in London, followed by an equal
success in New York. It is still being
presented and the rights for it are
being bought all over the world, the
producer at present receiving about
$10,000 a week royalties.
Mrs. Farrington is a graduate of the
University of California and a mem
ber of the California Extension Divi
sion, her particular field being the in
terpretation of drama.
