# Jordan Enjoys Visit With Friends; Health Unchanged
## 
### 
Although Dr. David Starr Jordan
shows no marked improvement in
health, he is consistently holding his
own, according to a report regarding
his condition given by an attendant
last night. Yesterday he was up for
an hour and a half, spending part of
this time out of doors in his garden.
He is well enough to have visitors
for a short time each day, and often
enjoys a few minutes' conversation
with friends and acquaintances.
