# JUNIOR HOCKEY TEAM DOWNS FROSH SQUAD IN INTERCLASS GAME
## 
### 
Playing a fast offensive game, the
juniors yesterday won the first prac
tice game of the hockey season from
a comparatively weak freshman team,
5 to 1.
Play throughout the game was con
centrated in the wings, where Mar
garet Bullard and Marcella Brown of
the juniors faced the freshman play
ers, Clare Nichols and Helen Ullman.
Edith Badger, who made three of the
junior goals, and Carol Shriver, who
accounted for another junior tally, are
both new members of their team. Cap
tain Eleanor Boyd, '33, playing a
heady game at center forward, drove
the lone goal for her class.
Tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 o'clock
the seniors will meet the sophomore
squad.
