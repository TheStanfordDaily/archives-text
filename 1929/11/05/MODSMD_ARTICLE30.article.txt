# WARNER STRIVES TO BETTER CARD OFFENSIVE GAME
## Stanford Squad Scheduled To Leave for the North Tomorrow Afternoon Return of Injured Players Marks First Full Squad Since Olympic Club Tilt 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Polishing up an offense —which has
been none too smooth for the past
couple of games—seems to be the
chief concern of Coach Pop Warner
and his forty-nine gridiron stalwarts
these few remaining days before their
invasion of Seattle.
The Cardinal varsity Is scheduled
to entrain for the North tomorrow
afternoon after practice, where they
will meet the Washington Huskies In
their last Conference clash before the
Big Game on the 23rd. Although the
Cards are pointing for this latter bat
tle, on which the final standings of
the Coast title hinges, Coach Warner
is not overlooking Saturday's game.
An upset at the hands of the Huskies
would put Stanford completely out of
the running.
Injured Men Return
As far as injuries go, the Carda
are in the best shape they have been
since the Olympic Club contest. No
new members were added to the hos
pital list last Saturday, this being the
first game of the season in which two
or three players were not forced to
leave the field with some sort of a
twisted, bruised, or smashed knee. All
of the cripples have tossed aside their
crutches, while Captain Muller,
Johnny Preston, Ray Dawson, and
Pete Heiser are all back in suit again
ready for action.
The only possible exception is
Heiser, whose knee is still bothering
him. He is without doubt the best in
terference runner on the squad, and
his absence was sorely missed in the
Trojan game. Pop has been having a
hard time in developing a capable
guard to take his place in the regular
lineup, and unless Heiser gets back
in shape soon, the Stanford offense
may continue to be more or less rag*
ged.
Muller Will Start
Captain Muller, who was first
thought to have torn a ligament in
his back two weeks ago, was out for
practice last night and will be ready
to start the Husky battle. Members
of the big powerhouse backfield —Her-
bert Fleishhacker, Chuck Smalling,
Lud Frentrup, and Harlow Rothert —-
were running at their old places on
the first string yesterday, and it is
expected that this backfield quartet
will open against Washington,
