While it is always considered brash for "embryo journalists" to criti
cize the opinions set forth in the big time newspapers, the Daily is
throwing caution to the four winds and going after an editorial ravage
as expressed in a paper none other than the Los Angeles Times, whose
slogan is "All the News All the Time."
Writing in a column called "Rabbit Punches," Paul Lowry, sports
editor of the Times, takes a few jack-rabbit kicks at an opinion expressed
in the Daily's Side-Line Slants, written by Stephen Mann Dietrich
(Stockton, Pol.S. 139+129). Mr. Lowry's particular article is cap
tioned "A College Misfit" and is written about Mr. Dietrich's particular
vitriolic Slants on the outcome of the Stanford-U.S.C. game.
Mr. Lowry commences his rabid dissertation thusly:
Pop Warner on the pan.
Sounds terrible, doesn't it, until the author is revealed as a
college rattlebrain whose limited knowledge of football makes him
perfectly qualified to pass judgment on a man who is hailed as one
of the nation's leading coaches—a man who has been teaching the
young idea our great game for thirty-four years.
Imagine this young college punk, an intellectual giant of twenty
summers, perhaps, who magnificently castigates Warner and the
Stanford team because the Trojans won last Saturday.
Just think of the furore this mental Napoleon is going to
create in the country as the result of his reproof to the man whose
formations are copied in some form or other by practically every
coach in the land.
Mr. Lowry goes on to say that Mr. Dietrich refuses to credit one
team and condemns the other because of the result.
Now let's get a few things straight, Mr. Lowry.
Stanford rooters believe that U.S.C. won the game because it
had the better team. Southern California has one of the best teams
in the land and it is no disgrace to lose to such an aggregation.
The Stanford student body to the last man is behind Pop War
ner and the Cardinal team. Warner was never put on the pan and
never will be as far as we (editorial) are concerned. We acclaim
him as one of the greatest coaches in the United States.
The Times sports editor based his personal criticisms of the Daily
sports editor on two selected paragraphs, quoted in his "Rabbit Punches"
as follows:
" 'This old stuff of tossing away championships without a murmur
is of late getting to be quite a habit with Pop's lads. Individually the
Cards were not so bad but as a team they put on a sloppy exhibition'."
He did not read all the Slants. He acted on misinformation.
Mr. Lowry sarcastically condemns Dietrich as a mental Napoleon
who will create a furore. Yet Mr. Lowry lets himself get unduly aroused
over the article written by a "college punk." He derides Dietrich as a
"college rattlebrain" who does not know what he is writing about. Yet
Mr. Lowry acts on misinformation, himself.
Mr. Lowry, a mature journalist of forty summers, perhaps, judges
Dietrich as a "misfit" in one article. We should hate to judge Mr. Lowry
on the basis of this one misdirected, unfair "Rabbit Punch."

team and condemns the other because of the result.
Now let's get a few things straight, Mr. Lowry.
Stanford rooters believe that U.S.C. won the game because it
had the better team. Southern California has one of the best teams
in the land and it is no disgrace to lose to such an aggregation.
The Stanford student body to the last man is behind Pop War
ner and the Cardinal team. Warner was never put on the pan and
never will be as far as we (editorial) are concerned. We acclaim
him as one of the greatest coaches in the United States.
The Times sports editor based his personal criticisms of the Daily
sports editor on two selected paragraphs, quoted in his "Rabbit Punches"
as follows:
" 'This old stuff of tossing away championships without a murmur
is of late getting to be quite a habit with Pop's lads. Individually the
Cards were not so bad but as a team they put on a sloppy exhibition'."
He did not read all the Slants. He acted on misinformation.
Mr. Lowry sarcastically condemns Dietrich as a mental Napoleon
who will create a furore. Yet Mr. Lowry lets himself get unduly aroused
over the article written by a "college punk." He derides Dietrich as a
"college rattlebrain" who does not know what he is writing about. Yet
Mr. Lowry acts on misinformation, himself.
Mr. Lowry, a mature journalist of forty summers, perhaps, judges
Dietrich as a "misfit" in one article. We should hate to judge Mr. Lowry
on the basis of this one misdirected, unfair "Rabbit Punch."
While it is always considered brash for "embryo journalists" to criti
cize the opinions set forth in the big time newspapers, the Daily is
throwing caution to the four winds and going after an editorial ravage
as expressed in a paper none other than the Los Angeles Times, whose
slogan is "All the News All the Time."
Writing in a column called "Rabbit Punches," Paul Lowry, sports
editor of the Times, takes a few jack-rabbit kicks at an opinion expressed
in the Daily's Side-Line Slants, written by Stephen Mann Dietrich
(Stockton, Pol.S. 139+129). Mr. Lowry's particular article is cap
tioned "A College Misfit" and is written about Mr. Dietrich's particular
vitriolic Slants on the outcome of the Stanford-U.S.C. game.
Mr. Lowry commences his rabid dissertation thusly:
Pop Warner on the pan.
Sounds terrible, doesn't it, until the author is revealed as a
college rattlebrain whose limited knowledge of football makes him
perfectly qualified to pass judgment on a man who is hailed as one
of the nation's leading coaches—a man who has been teaching the
young idea our great game for thirty-four years.
Imagine this young college punk, an intellectual giant of twenty
summers, perhaps, who magnificently castigates Warner and the
Stanford team because the Trojans won last Saturday.
Just think of the furore this mental Napoleon is going to
create in the country as the result of his reproof to the man whose
formations are copied in some form or other by practically every
coach in the land.
Mr. Lowry goes on to say that Mr. Dietrich refuses to credit one
team and condemns the other because of the result.
