Elsewhere in this issue of the Daily is a story of a "certain student"
who was arrested for forging checks and who blames campus betting and
pooling as the reason for his acts.
While we dislike to moralize, we believe this student got exactly what
was coming to him. Whether betting is good or bad we will leave to the
Philosophy Department to decide in a logical and ethical manner. But
when a person bets with another person's money, that of his folks, he is
committing a crime, especially when this person does not have enough
money to cover his wagers. There is honesty even among gamblers.
Then to make the crime all the worse, he forges checks. Yes, he was a
freshman.
The world has listened to many a dreary story spun about college boys
who go wrong. We did not believe they existed in this age of scientific
achievement and intelligence.
For those freshmen who do not take their Citizenship seriously, but
read the Daily instead, it is apropos to state that you should not bet
when you have no money. If you must bet, do so to win, and if you lose
don't crab about the team being lousy or the coach going to the dogs.
