"SWEETlE"—Granada Theatre, San
Francisco.
After seeing "Sweetie," the all-talk
ing "collegiate" movie featuring Helen
Kane, Nancy Carroll, and Jack Oakie,
at the Granada, one is reminded of
the art gallery story in which the
skeptic said, "Huh, Italian sunsets
were never like that!" and someone
crooned gently, "Ah, my friend, and
don't you wish they WERE like that."
Speaking of "Sweetie," we'd say,
". . . and don't you wish colleges were
like that —for just a week!"
We add "for just a week" because
no student could stand the wear and
tear of the red-hot college life for
long. Jazz bands. Helen Kane boop
oop-a-"duping" her football hee-ro.
Nancy Carroll, as the lovely chorine
who falls heir to the academy and
falls in love with the captain of the
team. And right next door there's a
girl's school picked a la Mr. Zeigfield
rather than from the Social Register.
Football? When that team came on
the field to do or die for dear old
Pelham, and when the hero ran some
105 yards to a touchdown, the stands
went wild. Pelham, repel 'em! You
may not like the "joe college" atmos
phere, but you will certainly enjoy
the youth and zest of the picture—
its songs and rapid-flre repartee.
BELINDA, By Hilaire Belloc. (Harper
& Brothers, Publishers. New
York. 1929.)
"Belinda" is a satire of the most
saccharine of the Victorian novels.
The story is that of two English
lovers who are caused to become
estranged by a wily villain who inter
cepts their letters. Virtue, of course,
soon triumphs over evil; the villains
are repentant; and the lovers meet
to live happily ever afterwards.
Belloc has cleverly imitated the
style and sentiment of the Victorians
from the first idyllic meeting of the
lovers by a woodland stream to the
final chapter when: "He fell upon one
knee, with bowed head, and his lovely
partner —Reader! Impute it not im
modesty in a tender Virgin—gently
laid her hand on his hair and mur
mured: 'Horatio . . . '"
The "blurb" on the jacket of Be
linda describes it as both a "witty
satire" and a "beautiful story." Nei
ther characterization seems justified.
It seems to me that satire should
be directed against some existing

thing. Now, whatever the idiocies of
modern fiction, the Victorian type de
picted in Belinda is as completely ex
tinct as are the feminine faintings,
blushings, and hoop skirts of the same
period. To satirize such things is as
absurd as to satirize medieval belief
in witchcraft.
Moreover, those beauties which oc
casionally sprang from the naive faith
and innocence of the original novels
of this type are, of necessity, lacking
in this obvious satire.
Belinda is no more amusing, to a
modern, than those things at which it
pokes fun; it is a shot at the dead.
The-satire is as foolish as the satir
ized. —E. E. W.
"THE LOVE DOCTOR"—Varsity.
All you doubters who have suffered
through countless talkie farces may
prepare for a treat. This new Richard
Dix picture is the best comedy Palo
Alto has seen this year. It proved the
oft-made contention that all the
movies need is good stories. This one
is a howl.
It's about a wealthy young doctor,
long on theory and short on practice.
When the usual sort of patients fail
to show up, he does a little prescrib
ing for the love-sick. And the results
are most uproarious for the woman
hating medic.
The audience last night laughed so
often and so hard that many of the
lines had to be guessed at. When the
picture ended there was hearty ap
plause—such a rare tribute means
only one thing—excellence.
Richard Dix, whom we've had a
feeling was falling during the past
few years because of poor stories,
stages a real comeback. His voice is
deep and pleasing. His acting is top
notch. He is a real talkie star.
June Collyer, as the heroine, is very
pleasing to both the eye and ear.
Miriam Seegar as the peppy little
blonde is a newcomer who does nobly.
Gale Henry as a slightly dumb office
girl furnishes her share of the laughs,
and Morgan Farley is a regular Willie
Baxter boy. In other words, the entire
cast is first-rate.
The dialogue writer deserves the
biggest boquet. The lines are exceed
ingly clever, and the plot tears right
along without ever a slump. Record
ing unusually clear. Don't miss "The
Love Doctor."
