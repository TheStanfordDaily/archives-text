## THE 						FIVE HUNDRED SPEAK 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I object. We object. We feel it our
duty as well as our privilege to ob
ject. Let mo explain.
"A spirit of fellowship and play be
tween schools is much more to be de
sired than one of competition." Ima
gine saying that to our men's football
teams! Would they not at once plan
a play-day with California and U.S.C.,
organize teams partly of Stanford
men, partly of Cal men, and partly of
U.S.C. men, playing off juniors against
seniors, sophomores against freshmen,
and so on? And would they not ex
claim delightedly at the end of the
day, "Yes, indeed! A spirit of friendly
fellowship such as we have exhibited
is much more valuable than this un
friendly competition we have so long
suffered to exist"? You are right.
They would not.
Neither do we, the women of this
honorable institution. We claim it our
duty to uphold our sex and our privi
lege to enjoy our athletics. We may
be few but we are not negligible, and
while we see no good reason for op
posing intercollegiate women's ath
letics, we see several excellent rea
sons for advocating such. Here are

the main arguments of the opposi
tion:
1. Intercollegiate athletics would be
too great a strain on the girls. An
swer: They strain themselves fully
as much, if not more, in the present
interclass-intercollegiate, for the rea
son that they are playing as part of
an unfamiliar team which cannot be
expected to co-operate as a unit.
2. There would develop a feeling of
antagonism between the contending
schools. Answer: Why so, more than
is developed by men's athletics? On
the contrary, we feel that a bond of
friendship would be formed, much
stronger than that ephemeral rela
tionship fostered by the existing in :
terclass-intercollegiate games.
Moreover, we advocate intercolle
giate women's athletics because:
1. It would provide a greater incen
tive for practice and for attention to
teamwork.
2. There would be something which
the women of this institution could
support AS A WHOLE, something we
seem to lack at the present time.
Three cheers for intercollegiate
women's athletics! Think it over.
