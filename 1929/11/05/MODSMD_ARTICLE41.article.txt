# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF NOVEMBER 5, 1904 
### 
The Stanford varsity easily defeated
Utah Agricultural College in a rather
dull game by the score of 57-0. In spite
of the huge score run up on the Aggies
the Redshirts displayed a lack of team
work. Brennan, Card halfback who car
ried the ball five times for an average
of 25 yards each time, furnished the
fans with most of the thrills.
Roble Club presented the Roble
Faculty Farce, "A Model Lover," in
the women's gymnasium before the
members of the faculty and their
wives. Following the presentation of
the farce, a reception was held at
which music was furnished by the
Roble orchestra.

An editorial: "The football number
of Chaparral will be by far the best
number of the magazine that has ap
peared this year. One of the features
is the new cover by R. W. Borough,
'04. This is the first time the cover
design has been changed since the
founding of the magazine in 1899. The

issue is twice as large as any other
this year." Borough also designed the
Chaparral letterheads, which design
is still used.
Announcement was made of the
plans of the Stanford Club of New
York to give its annual football dinner
on November 12 at the Park Avenue
Hotel in the metropolis. Invitations
were sent to about sixty Stanford
alumni who live in New York and
vicinity and reports of the Big Game
will be received at the dinner.
