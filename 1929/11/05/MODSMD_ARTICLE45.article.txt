# LIVELY DEBATE WITH WASHINGTON FEARED IN W.A.C.C. MEETING
## Issue With College Humor May Cause Dissension In W.A.A.C. Ranks 
### 
A warm discussion over relations of
the Western Association of College
Comics with College Humor during
the meeting of the W.A.C.C. here
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday is an
ticipated by Nelson Carter, editor of
Chaparral. Charles Guernsey, business
manager of Washington "Columns,"
and Kenneth Striker, editor, threaten
to break with the association if the
rest of the member-schools renew con
tracts with College Humor.
Statements by the Washington
representatives that the California
"Pelican" refused to sign with College
Humor last year were branded "false"
by Nelson Carter today. The Arizona
"Kitty-Kat" was the only college
comic magazine besides "Columns" to
break with College Humor last year.
H. N. Swanson, business manager of
College Humor, will attend the Stan
ford convention this week in an ef
fort to further smooth over disagree
ments between that magazine and the
W.A.C.C., according to Carter. "It is
altogether improbable that the college
comics organization will come to any
break with College Humor," said Car
ter; "but Columns will probably re-
Bign from the W.A.C.C."
Two years ago the W.A.C.C. severed
relations with College Humor, but all
the schools except Arizona and Wash
ington renewed contracts last year.
