# FRENCH FILM, "PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC," WILL BE PRESENTED BY DRAMATIC COUNCIL
## 
### 
What was judged by the National
Board of Review to be one of the
four greatest films of all time, "The
Passion of Joan of Arc," a French
film dealing with the trial and execu
tion of the saint, will be presented in
the Assembly Hall on the evening of
November 14, by the Dramatic Coun
cil.
French Technique
Technique that is entirely different
from that seen in American films —
and also unlike that in German films
—will be the outstanding feature of
this production. Starting with Joan's
trial in the ecclesiastical court, and
being confined to this and the burn
ing, this picture is one of unalloyed
seriousness. Carl Dreyer, director for
the Societe Generale des Films, has
put no relief in it, from the indictment
to the last harrowing scene. There
are no clever captions; there are no
half-comic characters. It Is a detailed
account of the last six hours of Joan's
life, portrayed almost entirely by the
close-up technique. Interesting also,

will be the frequent use of fantastic
angles in both close-ups and distant
scenes. Ninety per cent of the film
is taken from queer positions which
emphasize the psychological effect of
things on the Maid. A bishop which
appears to be all chin, a judge who
is all ear, a soldier who is all nose —
all of these weird impressions are
brought about by the peculiar French
technique.
Falconetti Plays Joan
Mile. Falconetti, a member of the
Com£die plays the part of
Joan in this picture which was sup
pressed in England and a few months
later selected as one of the four
greatest pictures ever made; and
Mons. Sylvain, also a member of the
Com6die, will be seen in the part of
the Bishop of Beauvais.
Tickets for "The Passion of Joan
of Arc" will go on sale next Monday
