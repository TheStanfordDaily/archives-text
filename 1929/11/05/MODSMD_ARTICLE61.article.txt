G-r-r-r!
It seems as though the market
has changed from Bull to Bear all
over the country.
For a while stocks on the New York
Exchange have rallied by leaps and
bounds during the past week, U.C.'s
stock has risen from nothing to 100%
plus. Last Saturday morning one
couldn't find Nibs' backers at any
price. But by nightfall, Trojan goal
post preferred had fallen flat, while
Nibs' shares had soared away above
par value in the most sensational
rally of the 1929 season.
With this jump came drastic
changes in Western betting cir
cles, for the Golden Bears are now
heavy favorites to cop the Pacific
Coast Conference title!
So much for odds and speculations.
Getting down to the bare facts of
the case, California rose to quite un
expected heights on the second quar
ter and chewed off all the legs of the
Thundering Herd. At least, the Trojan
War Horse was crawling around on
its knees most of that hectic after
noon. Perhaps it was because Benny
Lom and his cohorts showed so much
speed.
At any rate, It was THE big
upset of the week-end. And a
most welcome one to followers of
the Cardinal football machine.
Among the most jovial spectators
who fought their way into the Coli
seum on Saturday to sit awed on sun
sizzled seats for sixty minutes and
more, was Coach Pop Warner who
went South to get his first peek at
the Bears in action this year. It will
probably be his last, also, as the Cards
have two tough games facing them
before the Big Game.
Yet, the one sixty-minute peek
gave the Old Fox a large-sized
eyeful!
Pop had a lot of nice things to say
about Nibs Price's boys when he re
turned to the quiet sanctitudes of the
Farm yesterday morning. And when
Pop says that a team is good, that
team IS good! The Old Fox was loud
in his praise of the Trojans, after his
scouting expedition to the North
Woods some few weeks ago, and the
Trojans proved to be a tough nut to
crack.
However, California not only
cracked the nut, but ate all of the
meat to boot!
And now Pop comes out frankly ad
mitting that the Golden Bear is better
than the team from Troy. In telling
about the game yesterday, Coach War
ner said that U.S.C. played just about
the same brand of ball against the
Bears as it did on the 26tli.
The whole trouble was, Pop con
tinued, "that California has been un
derrated by the critics, coaches, and
fans." It seems that the Penn affair
failed to convince the wise birds. Now
they are all sitting up to take notice.
With the situation as it now
stands, Stanford has something
to fight for. In fact, the whole suc
cess of the 1929 season depends
on how the Cards act in the Big
Game. However, Pop thinks that
the Redshirts "will have to play
their best game of the season to

break even with the California
team."
It is interesting to note that Nibs
has never beaten Stanford on the
gridiron. But up to last Saturday, nei
ther had the Trojans succumbed to
the little mentor from U.C.
Each year since Mr. Price took over
the reins at Berkeley, the Bears have
shown vast improvement. The first
season found his charges weak and
decrepit, and California was swamped
many times. The next year found
them much more formidable. And in
1928, the Bears fought their way to
ties with both Southern California and
Stanford.
Now they have cleaned up the
Trojans in a decisive manner.
Just what will they do to the Cardi
nals? Believe it or not, the latter will
have a whole lot to say about the
matter.
