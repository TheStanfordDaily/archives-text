"Don't
be
like that"
WHAT'S the use of getting the
good suit pressed for a date if
the rain is going to make it
look like a wet sack before
you arrive? None whatever.
But if you put on your Fish
Brand Slicker your clothes
look precisely as well when
you get there as when you start.
A real Fish Brand Slicker is
good-looking too. It has set
the campus style for years.
And it will stand any amount
of wear and rough usage. Look
for the Fish Brand label.
