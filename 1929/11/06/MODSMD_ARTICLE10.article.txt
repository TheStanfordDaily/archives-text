# SEPARATE PHONE SYSTEM IS PLAN FOR UNIVERSITY
## Survey of Campus Shows An Acute Need for Local Central Exchange 
### 
A completely revamped telephone
system for the entire campus with the
possibility of a separate Stanford ex
change will probably be the result of
the survey just completed by the tele
phone company, according to Almon
E. Roth, University comptroller.
The telephone company has made a
complete investigation of campus
phone needs and has submitted sever
al propositions which University of
ficials are considering. It will prob
ably be necessary to run the wires
not only from the halls but also the
various other campus buildings to a
central exchange in order to solve
the phone problem.
This will necessitate considerable
expense, but a study is already being
made of the best place to locate an
exchange and the best ways to run
cables from the buildings to the ex
change.
Pending the completion of arrange
ments and the installation of the new
system two new trunk lines have been
added to the dormitory exchange in
order to alleviate some of the present
difficulties in service.
