# Entomologists Will Meet Tonight For Open Forum
## 
### 
Campus entomologists will meet for
open forum discussion at Shepherd
Place near Roble Hall this evening at
8 o'clock.
Those members of the Stanford
Zoology Club who are especially in
terested in entomology as a major sub
ject have formed a small sub-commit
tee of their own, which does not, how
ever, sever its affiliations with the
main society. David Shepherd is lead
er of the group, whose members at
the informal meetings discuss any
problem about the insect world that
the members bring up.
