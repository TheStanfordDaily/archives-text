# Revised Campus Bus Line Agreed Upon By Officials
## 
### 
A revised route for the campus bus
line has been agreed upon by Univer
sity and Peninsula Railway officials
that will give greatly improved serv
ice. The new route will go into effect
as soon as it lias been approved by
San Francisco officials of the com
pany.
Under the new system the busses
will come up Palm Drive to Pine Ave
nue and then cut over to the men's
gymnasium. From the gym they will
go to the Encina Hall corner and then
west past the Art Gallery and Ad
ministration Building to the Physics
corner. Then south as far as the Press
Building where they will turn east and
go to the Union corner. From there
they will go up Lasuen and tho row
as usual and return by the same route.
The new route will be considerably
handier for people frequenting the
gym or going to the Press Building or
Roble Hall while practically none of
the advantages of the old route are
lost.
