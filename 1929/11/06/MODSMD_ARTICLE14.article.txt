# LOCAL D.A.R. GIVES JORDAN SIGNAL HONOR
## Action Is Direct Reversal Of "Blacklist" Sent Out Year Ago 
### 
An honor with a double edge has
been accorded Dr. David Starr Jor
dan, Chancellor Emeritus, by the
Daughters of the American Revolu
tion, the same organization which less
than a year ago placed him on the
"blacklist" because of his untiring ef
forts to promote the cause of peace.
Expressing deep gratification for
Dr. Jordan's activity as a prophet and
a pioneer in the disarmament move
ment, a resolution will be tendered
the aged scholar on Armistice Day by
the Palo Alto Chapter of the D.A.R.
This action is a direct reversal of
the episode of last spring, when the
name of Dr. Jordan was included with
those of other distinguished sup
porters of the peace cause on the list
of speakers barred by the national
order of the D.A.R. The local chapter
of which Mrs. Jordan is a member,
had taken no part in the "blacklist,"
refusing to endorse the stand of its
national.
The resolutions to be submitted to
Dr. Jordan next Monday, follow:
"Whereas, David Starr Jordan has
stood as a prophet and pioneer in this
movement even at the cost of person
al sacrifice and misunderstanding and
has, in season and out of season,
preached the futility and waste of war
and the power of international friend
liness and understanding,
"Be it resolved that we, the Palo
Alto chapter of the Daughters of the
American Revolution, express to Dr.
Jordan our gratification that the faith
which he has held through all these
years is being justified and that his
efforts for world peace are now com
ing to fruition."
