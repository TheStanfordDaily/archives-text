# "SPORTS DAY" CHANGE APPROVED BY W.A.A.; ELECT NEW MEMBERS
## 
### 
Stanford women do not approve of
the present organization of Triangular
Sports Day which has interclass com
petition as its basis.
This was the sentiment expressed
by W.A.A. Board at a meeting held
last night when the organization went
on record as disfavoring the present
system of Sports Day and recom
mending that notice of the disapproval
be sent to California and Mills, the
two colleges with whom Stanford
holds annual Sports Days.
A meeting of Sports Day managers
and W.A.A. presidents of the three
colleges has been planned to discuss
returning to interclass intercollegiate
competition. The present Sports Day
plan of having members of the same
class from different colleges play on
the same team was adopted in 1925
when the American Conference of As
sociated College Women resolved to
oppose intercollegiate athletics in any
form.
"The outbreak of Stanford songs at
the luncheon was the clearest indica
tion during Sports Day that women
here were more interested in the in
tercollegiate aspect of competition
than in competition on class basis
alone," was the statement made by
Elisabeth Larsh, Sports Day manager.
That co-operation would be offered
by the faculty was indicated by the
comment of Helen Masters Bunting,
faculty advisor of W.A.A. Board, "I
would like to see the women of Stan
ford have the type of Sports Day
satisfying to them."
At the same meeting Betty Lewton
and Catherine Cartlidge were elected
members of the board to fill the posi
tions of freshman representative and
hiking manager respectively. Dorothy
Sweet's resignation from the mana
gerial position necessitated the elec
tion of a new board member.
