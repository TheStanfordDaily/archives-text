alded expose of "Wall Street booze
parties" before a keenly attentive
senate today in an atmosphere alive
with suspense generated by the re
curring furore over drinking among
the nation's lawmakers.
The Senator chose for his text:
"You must begin with the big fel
lows" on law enforcement. He con
gratulated President Hoover, Vice-
President Sir Esme How
ard, the British ambassador, on their
personal attitude toward law enforce
ment.
"To the President's crime commis
sion, I say if you want to enforce the
law get after the big fellows. To sen
ators I say get out of these booze
parties. You don't need hip-flasks as
mementoes."
During his attack on Mellon, Brook

could, there were not enough of them.
Wall Street Dinner
After throwing his invitation to the
dinner, received from Walter J. Fahy,
Wall Street broker, into the waste

shire, who was presiding.
In the reception room at the dinner,
Brookhart said, there was a rack and
when someone lifted a curtain there
was revealed a row of silver hip flasks.
"I was told to 'help yourself.' A con
siderable number there did help them
selves. But I want it distinctly under
stood that Senator Smoot, who was
there, did not help himself and was
as much disgusted as I was and as
much against it.
"Senator Gooding did not take a
flask and I didn't. As to the other
boys they can say for themselves
whether they helped themselves. Then
we went into the dinner."

During his attack on Mellon, Brook
hart said there was "not a prohibition
agent along the entire New York bor
der" and although immigration agents
were doing the work as well as they
could, there were not enough of them.
Wall Street Dinner
After throwing his invitation to the
dinner, received from Walter J. Fahy,
Wall Street broker, into the waste
basket, Brookhart said, he was urged
to go lo the dinner by "our distin
guished president pro tem." He re
ferred to Senator Moses, New Hamp
shire, who was presiding.
In the reception room at the dinner,
Brookhart said, there was a rack and
when someone lifted a curtain there
was revealed a row of silver hip flasks.
"I was told to 'help yourself.' A con
siderable number there did help them
selves. But I want it distinctly under
stood that Senator Smoot, who was
there, did not help himself and was
as much disgusted as I was and as
much against it.
"Senator Gooding did not take a
flask and I didn't. As to the other
boys they can say for themselves
whether they helped themselves. Then
we went into the dinner."
