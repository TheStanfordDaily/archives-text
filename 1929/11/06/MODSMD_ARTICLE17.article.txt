# SHERRIFF'S WAR PLAY 'JOURNEY'S END' READ BY MRS. FARRINGTON
## 
### 
"In a sense this is not a play but a
piece of life, torn red and bleeding out
of a four-year hell," is the report of
English critics on "Journey's End,"
the war play by R. C. Sheriff, which
was read by Mrs. Guy Stevens Far
rington of U.C. in the Assembly Hall
last night. "It is life with a capital L,
a photograph snapped when no one
was posing."
"Journey's End" is the story of a
captain who is idealized by a boy.
The boy's hero-worship continues to
exist under all the strains of war. The
scene throughout the play is a dugout
about a hundred yards from the Ger
man lines.
Sherriff wrote the play for an ama
teur organization of which he was a
member. It was casually suggested
that he take it to a professional pro
ducer. Maurice Brown bought and pro
duced it in London where it had an
instant success, followed by an equally
enthusiastic reception in New York.
Rights for it are being bought all over
the world, and the producer is receiv
ing about $10,000 royalties a week.
