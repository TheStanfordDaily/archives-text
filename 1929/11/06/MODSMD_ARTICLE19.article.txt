# "JAZZ MUSIC IS LOSING ITS APPEAL TO COLLEGE STUDENT" SAYS DUPRE

"Students are beginning to be dis
gusted with jazz and are turning to
ward more serious music," believes
Marcel Dupr6, internationally known
organist who played here yesterday
morning. The music in both French
and American colleges is growing rap
idly and there is a greater apprecia
tion of the classics.
Dupr6 declared that the phonograph
can formulate musical taste, as good
records are always obtainable, where
as the radio has the opposite effect
since jazz is the only thing usually
on the air.
Although it 1r often disputed, he
believes that there is a different organ
touch. The notes must be attacked
with absolute cleanness. Piano play
ing is the basis of organ work as it
is impossible to be a good organist
without being an equally good pianist.

Music requires hours of work, and in
colleges the result is often that many
people who have talent fail to acquire
the technique necessary to the genius,
because of lack of time.
"It is impossible to explain the
mechanism of inspiration," said
Dupr6, when asked to tell of his re
markable improvising talent. "A com
plete knowledge of music is necessary
to improvise, and one must be accus
tomed to music. It is necessary to un
derstand first the character of the
theme to be improvised, after which
the general form of the piece must
be decided."
"Stanford has a magnificent organâ€”
or rather will have when it is com
pleted," he added. "There are places
prepared on the console for a larger
organ and these should be utilized as
the sound is a bit short for a big con
gregation."
