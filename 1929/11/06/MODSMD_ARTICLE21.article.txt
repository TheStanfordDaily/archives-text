### 
A move to improve social relations
between students of the several races
represented on the campus was under
taken last night by the Executive
Committee when it authorized the
creation of a Stanford Committee on
Student Relations. This committee
was organized with the special pur

more completely into the life of the
University.
The idea was first sponsored by Ben
Culver, secretary of the local Y.M.C.A.,
who sponsored informal discussions
between members of ex committee
and representatives of the Stanford

the purpose of ex committee to create
a permanent organization with defi
nite functions. While no committee
personnel has yet been announced,
President Steinbeck last night de
clared that it would contain repre
sentatives of the Row, Halls, Chinese
Club, Japanese Club, and ex commit
tee.
Norton F. Faus was named polo

the appointment of Isabel Warren as
women's debate manager was con
firmed.

of Pacific Relations conference which
