# VARSITY ELEVEN ENTRAINS TODAY FOR WASHINGTON
## Injuries Will Keep Simkins, Heiser Out of Game With Seattle Outfit Saturday Card Squad Does Not Expect Set-Up; Bagshaw's Eleven Always Offers Hard Scrap 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Thirty-three Cardinal football play
ers, bent on downing the Washington
Huskies this Saturday to remain in
the Coast title race, will entrain this
afternoon after practice, when the
Cascade Limited chugs out of the Oak
land mole to speed through Northern
woods and snow-capped peaks for
Seattle. Accompanying the team will
be Coach Pop Warner, Assistant
Coaches Tiny Thornhill and Chuck
Winterburn, and Steve Clarke, man
ager.
The Stanford aggregation of behe
moths, speedsters, and mentors is due
to arrive in the Northwestern metro
polis sometime Thursday night, and
the players are planning to work the
kinks out of their legs with a light
practice session the following morn
ing. As a consequence, today's work
out will be the last real chance the
Cards have to smooth out their of
fense and defense to be used against
the Huskies.
Huskies No Set-Up
Although supposedly taking the
Washington game in stride, the Farm
lads are not kidding themselves into
believing that Coach Bagshaw's men
will be a push-over. No matter how
weak they are touted, the Huskies al
ways give Stanford a good battle on
their home grounds. Two years ago
the Cards went North to win what
the dopesters predicted as a set-up,
yet they were lucky to return home
with a 13 to 7 victory.
Yesterday Pop put his charges
through a stiff practice drill, continu
ing to stress interference running and
perfection of an aerial attack. All of
the players were out in suits and are
in shape to play, with the exception
of Pete Heiser and Bill Simkins. Each
of them is still bothered with twisted
knees and will not make the trip to
Seattle.
Starting Line-up
Pop has not definitely decided on
the starting line-up, but it is expected
that the same line used against U.S.C.
will open against the Huskies. With
Simkins out, it is quite probable that
Chuck Smalling will be at his old posi
tion at full, with Herb Fleishhacker
at quarter and backing up the line on
defense.
Following is the roster of players
to make the Northern trip:
Ends —Preston, K. Albertson, Neill,
Muller, Bush, Worden.
Tackles —Artman, Klabau, Thomp
son. Tandy, Bogue, Ehrhorn.
Guards —Driscoll, Reynolds, Hulen,
Wilson, Dawson, Bardin.
Centers —Heinecke, Taylor, M. Al
bertson.
Halfbacks —Frentrup, Moffatt, Rin
tala, Rothert, Winnek, Caglieri, Clark.
Quarterbacks and fullbacks —Small-
ing, Fleishhacker, Hillman, Crary,
Murphy.

Thirty-three Cardinal football play
ers, bent on downing the Washington
Huskies this Saturday to remain in
the Coast title race, will entrain this
afternoon after practice, when the
Cascade Limited chugs out of the Oak
land mole to speed through Northern
woods and snow-capped peaks for
Seattle. Accompanying the team will
be Coach Pop Warner, Assistant
Coaches Tiny Thornhill and Chuck
Winterburn, and Steve Clarke, man
ager.
The Stanford aggregation of behe
moths, speedsters, and mentors is due
to arrive in the Northwestern metro
polis sometime Thursday night, and
the players are planning to work the
kinks out of their legs with a light
practice session the following morn
ing. As a consequence, today's work
out will be the last real chance the
Cards have to smooth out their of
fense and defense to be used against
the Huskies.
Huskies No Set-Up
Although supposedly taking the
Washington game in stride, the Farm
lads are not kidding themselves into
believing that Coach Bagshaw's men
will be a push-over. No matter how
weak they are touted, the Huskies al
ways give Stanford a good battle on
their home grounds. Two years ago
the Cards went North to win what
the dopesters predicted as a set-up,
yet they were lucky to return home
with a 13 to 7 victory.
Yesterday Pop put his charges
through a stiff practice drill, continu
ing to stress interference running and
perfection of an aerial attack. All of
the players were out in suits and are
in shape to play, with the exception
of Pete Heiser and Bill Simkins. Each
of them is still bothered with twisted
knees and will not make the trip to
Seattle.
Starting Line-up
Pop has not definitely decided on
the starting line-up, but it is expected
that the same line used against U.S.C.
will open against the Huskies. With
Simkins out, it is quite probable that
Chuck Smalling will be at his old posi
tion at full, with Herb Fleishhacker
at quarter and backing up the line on
defense.
Following is the roster of players
to make the Northern trip:
Ends —Preston, K. Albertson, Neill,
Muller, Bush, Worden.
Tackles —Artman, Klabau, Thomp
son. Tandy, Bogue, Ehrhorn.
Guards —Driscoll, Reynolds, Hulen,
Wilson, Dawson, Bardin.
