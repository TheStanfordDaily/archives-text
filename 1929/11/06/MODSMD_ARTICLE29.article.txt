Take Washington in stride !
That will be the theme of the send-off rally which will be held at the
Southern Pacific depot this afternoon when the Cardinal varsity entrains
for Seattle.
Songs and cheers will indicate to the team that the student body is
supporting it, and looks at the Husky game as a fine meet to condition
the varsity for the biggest Big Game.
Stanford has a wonderful bunch of football players who have a lot
of team spirit. And the students have the same spirit. The best way to
let the team know it will be to attend the rally and yell I
Take Washington in stride !
