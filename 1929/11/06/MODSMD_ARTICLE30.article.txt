# THE 						OLDEST TRADITION
## 
### 
Attention has been called to the Daily of occasional violation of the
first Stanford tradition. Although this paper does not believe in the en
forced observance of most ancient customs, the one in question is surely
worthy of perpetuation. Smoking on the Quadrangles or in University
buildings has always been taboo. A previous editorial called attention to
the aesthetic basis for Mrs. Stanford's request that the University not be
cluttered with cigarette stubs.
Dr. Jordan's sentiment concerning the tradition is admirably ex
pressed in a notice which he distributed twenty years ago:
It has been an unwritten law since the founding of the Uni
versity that there shall be no smoking in the University Quad
rangles or in the rooms used for University purposes. I ask your
co-operation in the continuance of this rule which seems to me
courteous and wholesome.
