# CALIFORNIA CYNIC CRYPTIC

Our friendly rivals across the bay have admirably expressed their
idea of goodwill assemblies in an editorial entitled "Honored and Tra
ditional Hates Are, After All, Above Goodwill Speeches." So ably does
the writer satirize the situation that we print the editorial in full.
California has chosen her enemies carefully. From the length -
and breadth of the Pacific Coast—from which, despite the All-
Americans of Eastern critics, come the country's greatest football
teams —California has picked her most distinguished foes, Stan
ford and U.S.C.
Our enmity for them is a thing of dignity based on the most
honored traditions of selecting adversaries. Briefly, our conten
tions are these: our Football Teams are better than their football
teams; our Women are more beautiful than their women; our
University is better than their universities. The most glamorous
wars of history have been fought for just such principles.
To these we add: the buildings at Stanford are a funny color.
Stanford men wear queer knickers. The Stanford color is red.
U.S.C. has a band that shoots off cap pistols. Their knickers
are queerer than the queer knickers of Stanford.
Upon these noble premises of animosity impose the facile bom
bast of the goodwill speaker. It is a little like bringing Aunt Lticy
to a hara-kiri party.
And it is more than that. Goodwill speakers stain with sacri
lege the bright banner of our hate. It is deep and cordial and
tinged with the sort of respect that one feels for a worthy foe.
It is a feeling above goodwill speeches, just as it passes beyond
such trifling tricks as the painting of rival campuses and the light
ing of rival bonfires.
