REMOTE CONTROL, Alcazar Theatre
Henry Duffy, the man who never
presents a "naughty" play, is knock
ing over two birds with his present
Alcazar attraction, "Remote Control."
He clicks off the radio play novelty,
and doubles it with the mystery, de
tective theme. All of which brings the
expectant patron little. Both the cast
and the vehicle are decidedly medi
ocre.
The play gets off to its best stride
at the opening, when a loudspeaker
booms in the dark, and the announcer
recites a burlesque time signal an
nouncement. But as the plot unfolds,
you find yourself hoping for a few
moments of terror, and being disap
pointed. With such chilly predeces
sors as "The Ghost Train" and"The
Mystery Ship" to live up to, "Remote
Control" occupies a weak place on the
roster of Duffy mystery presentations.
A murder, a hold-up, and the in
trigue of the Ghost Gang's operations
are all worked into the quiet precincts
of a Chicago radio studio. There is
an ambitious and confident announcer,
a pansy press agent, and a spiritualist
medium.
Highest honors go to Cameron
Prud'homme, who was the most con
vincing actor in the play. As the in
vestigating Sergeant Devine, he made
the best showing in a tepid cast.
Next, the work of Miss Peggy
Keenan was pleasing. Her earnest and
intense mien was much to her advan
tage. She was the heroine, who had
to stand by and cry "Don't sacrifice
yourself for me!" when her lover was
taken out by the Sergeant for a few
questions. The boy friend was due for
a few belts over the head with a piece
of rubber hose.
The booby prize goes to Byron Haw
kins, who had a fat comedy part, but
delivered every line drearily, direct
to the audience. The lady behind us
thought he was "a kick," however.
"Remote Control" is playing on
Broadway as well as O'Farrell Street
at present, but you can generally find
more entertainment on University
Avenue at the usual talking picture.
The theme song to "Remote Control"
was "Tune In On My Heart," and
they don't come half as bad in the
talkies. —Joe Thompson.
"THE UNHOLY NIGHT," at the New
Stanford.
Many blood-curdling films become
rather boring after a while, to say the
least. However, "The Unholy Night,"
though it must be classed as such a
thriller, succeeds in being different
and holds one's interest straight
through to its unusual end.
The plot, as is almost inevitable
these days, is laid in London. The
story runs that all the officers of a
certain regiment in the British Army
are about to be wiped out by some

unknown agency. Who plans the
wholesale murders Is not known, but
even the officers in the regiment are
suspected of nefarious intentions. A
beautiful girl comes to the house of
one of the officers to warn him of his
fate. From then on things happen.
There are enough murders even to
satisfy the most exacting blood
thirsters. There is a spirilualititic
seance in which the dead men mate
rialize, and then comes the surprising
ending.
The cast is excellent. Ernest Tor
rence as a doctor is stepping out of
his usual roles, but he does a very
commendable piece of acting. Dorothy
Sebastian as the beautiful Eurasian
girl is extremely lovely and convinc
ing. —N. J.
THE UNWILLING GOD. Percy Marks,
Harper and Brothers, Publishers,
New York, 1929.
College life, college attitudes —will
they ever be fairly and accurately
represented, either in fiction or cm the
screen?
Even the distinguished author of
the "Plastic Age" is no exception to
the prevalent fallacy of portraying
the stereotype college hero, the col
lege sissy, the college bully, the pro
fessor who is a "jolly good fellow,"
the athlete and the grind, and all the
rest of the various gallery that is
served up to the public in movies and
novels as "typical" of the modern col
lege—entertaining enough, but defi
nitely wrong in perspective.
However, "The Unwilling God" does
not follow these types so slavishly as
to be utterly insipid. The booK is
saved by the element of conflict that
the author handles with considerable
astuteness and force, between the
knotty problem of conformity and in
dividuality that faces its hero.
Bill Royce refuses to "die for dear
old Raleigh," and he is socially ostra
cized. "He had allowed himself four
precious years in which to acquire an
education and he would not sacrifice
a moment of it to childish horseplay.
. . . He was going to get what he
had come for. If he had to purchase
popularity by going through the silly
fraternity mummery and back-slap
ping and card-playing, and waste his
time sitting up half the night blahing
with a bunch of fool kids about sex
and religion and believing in a lot of
hooey—well, if he had to go rah-rah
to be popular, he was damned well-off
unpopular."
Outside of such passages as this,
which holds an indictment and a chal
lenge to college demands and ideals,
the book is relatively weak. Charac
terized briefly, it is little more than
an unconvincing cross between the
approved College Humor romance, and
the "Winning His R"_ sort of things
that furnished the thrills in junior
High School days. —M. L. R.

Bill Royce refuses to "die for dear
old Raleigh," and he is socially ostra
cized. "He had allowed himself four
precious years in which to acquire an
education and he would not sacrifice
a moment of it to childish horseplay.

had come for. If he had to purchase
popularity by going through the silly
fraternity mummery and back-slap
ping and card-playing, and waste his
time sitting up half the night blahing
with a bunch of fool kids about sex
and religion and believing in a lot of
hooey—well, if he had to go rah-rah
to be popular, he was damned well-off
unpopular."
Outside of such passages as this,
which holds an indictment and a chal

the book is relatively weak. Charac

REMOTE CONTROL, Alcazar Theatre
Henry Duffy, the man who never
presents a "naughty" play, is knock
ing over two birds with his present
Alcazar attraction, "Remote Control."
He clicks off the radio play novelty,
and doubles it with the mystery, de
tective theme. All of which brings the
expectant patron little. Both the cast
and the vehicle are decidedly medi
ocre.
The play gets off to its best stride
at the opening, when a loudspeaker
booms in the dark, and the announcer
recites a burlesque time signal an
nouncement. But as the plot unfolds,
you find yourself hoping for a few
moments of terror, and being disap
pointed. With such chilly predeces
sors as "The Ghost Train" and"The
Mystery Ship" to live up to, "Remote
Control" occupies a weak place on the
roster of Duffy mystery presentations.
A murder, a hold-up, and the in
trigue of the Ghost Gang's operations
are all worked into the quiet precincts
of a Chicago radio studio. There is
an ambitious and confident announcer,
a pansy press agent, and a spiritualist
medium.
Highest honors go to Cameron
Prud'homme, who was the most con
vincing actor in the play. As the in
vestigating Sergeant Devine, he made
the best showing in a tepid cast.
Next, the work of Miss Peggy
Keenan was pleasing. Her earnest and
intense mien was much to her advan
tage. She was the heroine, who had
to stand by and cry "Don't sacrifice
yourself for me!" when her lover was
taken out by the Sergeant for a few
questions. The boy friend was due for
a few belts over the head with a piece
of rubber hose.
The booby prize goes to Byron Haw
kins, who had a fat comedy part, but
delivered every line drearily, direct
to the audience. The lady behind us
thought he was "a kick," however.
"Remote Control" is playing on
Broadway as well as O'Farrell Street
at present, but you can generally find
more entertainment on University
Avenue at the usual talking picture.
The theme song to "Remote Control"
was "Tune In On My Heart," and
they don't come half as bad in the
talkies. —Joe Thompson.
"THE UNHOLY NIGHT," at the New
Stanford.
Many blood-curdling films become
rather boring after a while, to say the
least. However, "The Unholy Night,"
though it must be classed as such a
thriller, succeeds in being different
and holds one's interest straight
through to its unusual end.
The plot, as is almost inevitable
these days, is laid in London. The
story runs that all the officers of a
certain regiment in the British Army
are about to be wiped out by some

unknown agency. Who plans the
wholesale murders Is not known, but
even the officers in the regiment are
suspected of nefarious intentions. A
beautiful girl comes to the house of
one of the officers to warn him of his
fate. From then on things happen.
There are enough murders even to
satisfy the most exacting blood
thirsters. There is a spirilualititic
seance in which the dead men mate
rialize, and then comes the surprising
ending.
The cast is excellent. Ernest Tor
rence as a doctor is stepping out of
his usual roles, but he does a very
commendable piece of acting. Dorothy
Sebastian as the beautiful Eurasian
girl is extremely lovely and convinc
ing. —N. J.
THE UNWILLING GOD. Percy Marks,

College life, college attitudes —will
they ever be fairly and accurately
represented, either in fiction or cm the
screen?
Even the distinguished author of
the "Plastic Age" is no exception to
the prevalent fallacy of portraying
the stereotype college hero, the col
lege sissy, the college bully, the pro
fessor who is a "jolly good fellow,"
the athlete and the grind, and all the
rest of the various gallery that is
served up to the public in movies and
novels as "typical" of the modern col
lege—entertaining enough, but defi
nitely wrong in perspective.
However, "The Unwilling God" does
not follow these types so slavishly as
to be utterly insipid. The booK is
saved by the element of conflict that
the author handles with considerable
astuteness and force, between the
knotty problem of conformity and in
dividuality that faces its hero.

THE UNWILLING GOD. Percy Marks,
Harper and Brothers, Publishers,
New York, 1929.
College life, college attitudes —will
they ever be fairly and accurately
represented, either in fiction or cm the
screen?
Even the distinguished author of
the "Plastic Age" is no exception to
the prevalent fallacy of portraying
the stereotype college hero, the col
lege sissy, the college bully, the pro
fessor who is a "jolly good fellow,"
the athlete and the grind, and all the
rest of the various gallery that is
served up to the public in movies and
novels as "typical" of the modern col
lege—entertaining enough, but defi
nitely wrong in perspective.
However, "The Unwilling God" does
not follow these types so slavishly as
to be utterly insipid. The booK is
saved by the element of conflict that
the author handles with considerable
astuteness and force, between the
knotty problem of conformity and in
dividuality that faces its hero.
Bill Royce refuses to "die for dear
old Raleigh," and he is socially ostra
cized. "He had allowed himself four
precious years in which to acquire an
education and he would not sacrifice
a moment of it to childish horseplay.
. . . He was going to get what he
had come for. If he had to purchase
popularity by going through the silly
fraternity mummery and back-slap
ping and card-playing, and waste his
time sitting up half the night blahing
with a bunch of fool kids about sex
and religion and believing in a lot of
hooey—well, if he had to go rah-rah
to be popular, he was damned well-off
unpopular."
Outside of such passages as this,
which holds an indictment and a chal
lenge to college demands and ideals,
the book is relatively weak. Charac
terized briefly, it is little more than
an unconvincing cross between the
approved College Humor romance, and
the "Winning His R"_ sort of things
that furnished the thrills in junior
High School days. —M. L. R.
REMOTE CONTROL, Alcazar Theatre
Henry Duffy, the man who never
presents a "naughty" play, is knock
ing over two birds with his present
Alcazar attraction, "Remote Control."
He clicks off the radio play novelty,
and doubles it with the mystery, de
tective theme. All of which brings the
expectant patron little. Both the cast
and the vehicle are decidedly medi
ocre.
The play gets off to its best stride
at the opening, when a loudspeaker
booms in the dark, and the announcer
recites a burlesque time signal an
nouncement. But as the plot unfolds,
you find yourself hoping for a few
moments of terror, and being disap
pointed. With such chilly predeces
sors as "The Ghost Train" and"The
Mystery Ship" to live up to, "Remote
Control" occupies a weak place on the
roster of Duffy mystery presentations.
A murder, a hold-up, and the in
trigue of the Ghost Gang's operations
are all worked into the quiet precincts
of a Chicago radio studio. There is
an ambitious and confident announcer,
a pansy press agent, and a spiritualist
medium.
Highest honors go to Cameron
Prud'homme, who was the most con
vincing actor in the play. As the in
vestigating Sergeant Devine, he made
the best showing in a tepid cast.
Next, the work of Miss Peggy
Keenan was pleasing. Her earnest and
intense mien was much to her advan
tage. She was the heroine, who had
to stand by and cry "Don't sacrifice
yourself for me!" when her lover was
taken out by the Sergeant for a few
questions. The boy friend was due for
a few belts over the head with a piece
of rubber hose.
The booby prize goes to Byron Haw
kins, who had a fat comedy part, but
delivered every line drearily, direct
to the audience. The lady behind us
thought he was "a kick," however.
"Remote Control" is playing on
Broadway as well as O'Farrell Street
at present, but you can generally find
more entertainment on University
Avenue at the usual talking picture.
The theme song to "Remote Control"
was "Tune In On My Heart," and
they don't come half as bad in the
talkies. —Joe Thompson.
"THE UNHOLY NIGHT," at the New
Stanford.
Many blood-curdling films become
rather boring after a while, to say the
least. However, "The Unholy Night,"
though it must be classed as such a
thriller, succeeds in being different
and holds one's interest straight
through to its unusual end.
The plot, as is almost inevitable
these days, is laid in London. The
story runs that all the officers of a
certain regiment in the British Army
are about to be wiped out by some

unknown agency. Who plans the
wholesale murders Is not known, but
even the officers in the regiment are
suspected of nefarious intentions. A
beautiful girl comes to the house of
one of the officers to warn him of his
fate. From then on things happen.
There are enough murders even to
satisfy the most exacting blood
thirsters. There is a spirilualititic
seance in which the dead men mate
rialize, and then comes the surprising
ending.
The cast is excellent. Ernest Tor
rence as a doctor is stepping out of
his usual roles, but he does a very
commendable piece of acting. Dorothy
Sebastian as the beautiful Eurasian
girl is extremely lovely and convinc
ing. —N. J.
