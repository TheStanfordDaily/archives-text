# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF NOVEMBER 6, 1904 
### 
A request for a post-season football
game to be played at Palo Alto or San
Francisco during the Christmas holidays
was received by Treasurer Barrett of
the Stanford team from Western Mary
land College. The Maryland team was
considered one of the best in the country
and ranked with such teams as Carlisle,
Georgetown, and the Navy, but owing to
the fact that Stanford had already /ched
uled a post-season game, it was impos
sible for Barrett to arrange for another.
Maryland was the third team asking
Stanford for a game after the regular
1904 schedule. Colorado had been ac
cepted and Wisconsin turned down two
weeks previously for the same reason as
Maryland.
Stanford alumni in and near Chicago
were invited to a reunion banquet to be
held in that city on the evening of No
vember 12. Reports on the Big Game
were to be received during the evening.
In the announcement column: "Educa
tion 2—There will be an examination held
on Friday, November 18.— W. W. Kemp."

Jerseys for the members of the fresh
man football team arrived. They were
the regulation cardinal sweaters with
large white numerals.
The new fire apparatus was used for
the first time when the firemen were
"successful" in subduing a blaze which
threatened several homes on Alvarado
Row. Early in the evening a small blaze
started in the wood-house back of the
residence of Professor A. C. Whitaker.
The blaze was extinguished, but later it
revived and the building was destroyed.
Work on placing in position the new
mosaics in the vestibule of the Memorial
Church was begun under the direction of
the artist, Signor Zampotto. Mosaics for
the front of the church and for the gal
leries were to arrive shortly from the
shops of Silvio Salviati, Venice.
Arrangements were made with the rail
road officials to run two special trains
for the students to San Francisco on the
day of the Big Game. Special round-trip
tickets were to go on sale at $1.15.
