# Ballooning Spider Cobweb Investigated By McCracken
## 
### 
Dr. Isabel McCracken of the Depart
ment of Zoology has been investigating
a specimen of the cobwebs of the bal
looning spider sent to Stanford Univer
sity by the Weather Bureau, after an
epidemic of the species appeared in the
San Francisco Bay district recently. Mo
torists who drove through the Diablo
valley and the delta section of Contra
Costa County report the presence of
masses of cobwebs in the air. The same
phenomena were also observed in Marin
County.
It is believed the condition is caused by
the desire of the spiders to migrate be
cause of lack of food, water, or some
other necessity in their environment. An
over increase of young, eating large quan
tities of food, may cause a migration in
great numbers.
The ballooning, or aeronautical, spiders
first get in the highest part of some form
of vegetation or natural elevation, then
spin an amount of web which the wind
catches.
