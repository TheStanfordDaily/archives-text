## A 						REAL CURSE 
### 
"Send down another half-dozen pairs
of crutches. You know, those big pairs
for large-sized guys!"
It seems as though the Stan
ford football managers spend
more time ordering walking
sticks and other lame-man's par
aphernalia than doing anything
else this season.
And as for Trainer Denny. He has
one hectic time seeing that his supply of
splints, bandages, and tape doesn't run
short. During the games, Mr. Denny
gets about as big a sweat up as the play
ers. He is all over the field with his
little bag of magic, and is right on the
spot whenever a leg creaks, cracks, or
snaps out of joint.
If all-American gridiron train
ers were chosen, the Daily would
nominate and back with vim and
vigor as its candidate—Wallace
Denny!
Denny has served Stanford athletic
teams in this capacity for a long time
now. Yet, he has been busier this year
than the last two or three seasons put
together.
If one doesn't think so, he need merely
to glance over the Cardinal hospital list
from time to time. The Cripple Club is
almost as large as the varsity squad itself,
while the ciw-crutch toters comprise a first
class eleven in any man's league.
Believe it or not, Mr. Ripley
should have taken note of this
situation long ago in one of his
famous cartoons!
In glancing over the varsity roster, one
almost jumps clear out of his skin when
he reads off the names of those who have
had, or still have, some major injury.
Nearly the whole pack of Cards has been
torn or battered. In fact, only one regu
lar has not been out of practice or forced
to limp off the field with some sort of
an injury.
Tiny Artman, who makes the scales
tremble at some 230 pounds, is the for
tunate follower of the pigskin to avoid se
vere bone-crushing to date. However, this
little fellow had better tap on wood, as
four tough, smashing games remain to be
played this fall.
Following are a few of the other first
string men's troubles: Muller, bruised
•back; Preston, smashed rib and twisted
knee; Tandy, trick knee; Driscoll, leg
injury; Heiser, badly twisted knee; Hei
necke, leg injury; Smalling, bruised
shoulder; Flcishhacker, leg injury; Fren
trup, bruised foot; and Rothert, twisted
knee.
Sounds like a scene from that
vivid drama entitled "And Then
Another Redskin Bit the Dust!"
The substitutes arc just as bad off, if
not worse. Simkins, K. and M. Albert
son, Dawson, Wilson, Klabau, Ehrhorn,
Hillinan, Wittenau, and a host of others
have all been badly banged up at one time
or another.
It doesn't matter how stalwart or
strong a player is. The big lads, in fact,
have been the ones most affected. It
seems that the huskier they are, the easier
they twist!
Without a doubt, Stanford has
had more than her just share of
injuries. Last year U.S.C. had a
similar epidemic, but this fall the
Cardinals have been the ones
branded by the curse.
Coach Pop Warner has been handi
capped all season in developing a smooth
offense. Interference running has been
slowed down to a ragged pace and the
aerial attack has failed to sprout wings
as yet on account of these twists and
bruises.
As one publicity man put it:"The ether
Conference teams on the Coast would be
crying their eyes out if they had even
half of the Cards' troubles."
This is not an alibi, but a com
mon horsesense fact. The suc
cess that Pop's squad attains dur
ing the remainder of the year
1929 depends largely on how it
can shake off this curse of in
juries and how rapidly the pres
ent cripples get back in shape
once more!
