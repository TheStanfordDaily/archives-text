# FRESHMEN LOSE BATES AS GAME WITH U.C. NEARS
## Hunt Grooming John Card to Fill Pivot Position for Last Grid Game 
### Don Oswill 
Faced with the loss of his first
string center, as the Little Big Game
with the California freshmen nears,
Coach "Husky" Hunt is now trying
to find a man who can fit into his
forward wall without weakening it.
Bill Bates, regular pivot man, had his
knee dislocated in the St. Mary's
game, and will not be able to play
any more this season.
John Card, husky lad from Santa
Monica, seems to be Hunt's best bet
to fill the vacancy at the center posi
tion. Card is heavier than Bates, hut
relatively inexperienced as a lines
man. In practice last night his pass
ing was consistent and his blocking
good.
Outside of Bates at center, Hunt's
team will be in pretty good shape for
the Bear contest, having come
through the hard St. Mary's tilt with
out other injuries. Stevens, Card full
back, did have a bad leg, but was out
in uniform last night and looked as
good as ever.
Teams on Par
The fact that the baby Redshirts
have been playing strong teams every
week and have improved with each
game, puts them on an even basis
with the Cubs. The Stanford frosh
made a more impressive record
against the Saints than California, but
the Bears hold the edge in the per
formance against U.S.C.
California crossed the hitherto un
! crossed goal line of Southern Califor
nia's frosh three times last Saturday,
only to lose the game by a final count
of 21 to 19. Failure to convert after
touchdowns was responsible for the
defeat. The Cards found the Gael line
relatively easy, but failure to add the
extra point again spelled defeat.
Offensively, Stanford and Cal may i
be rated about even, but the Cards
seem to hold the edge on defensive
playing. The strong St. Mary's backs,
who pierced the California line almost
at will, made very few yards through
the Card forward wall. California's
backfield had little trouble scoring
against U.S.C. but was unable to main
tain a big lead.
Man for Man
Lee Valianos and Ulrich Fritchie
have been the mainstays of the Cali
fornia attack this season, Valianos
being a good open-field runner and
Fitchie the foremost line-plunger on
the Bear squad. For Stanford, Affler
baugh and Stevens are the best
threats. Afflerbaugh has made long
runs against every team that the
Cards have gone up against, and
Stevens can generally be depended
upon when a few yards are needed
through the line.
The strength of the California
guards, Swinney and Pascoe, is offset
by the two heavy Stanford tackles,
Choate and Artman, and the rest of
the line measures up about equally.
Taken man for man, there is no over
whelming superiority on either team,
and odds should be about even Satur
day.

any more this season.
John Card, husky lad from Santa
Monica, seems to be Hunt's best bet
to fill the vacancy at the center posi
tion. Card is heavier than Bates, hut
relatively inexperienced as a lines
man. In practice last night his pass
ing was consistent and his blocking
good.
Outside of Bates at center, Hunt's
team will be in pretty good shape for
the Bear contest, having come
through the hard St. Mary's tilt with
out other injuries. Stevens, Card full
back, did have a bad leg, but was out
in uniform last night and looked as
good as ever.
Teams on Par
The fact that the baby Redshirts
have been playing strong teams every
week and have improved with each
game, puts them on an even basis
with the Cubs. The Stanford frosh
made a more impressive record
against the Saints than California, but
the Bears hold the edge in the per
formance against U.S.C.
California crossed the hitherto un
! crossed goal line of Southern Califor
nia's frosh three times last Saturday,
only to lose the game by a final count
of 21 to 19. Failure to convert after
touchdowns was responsible for the
defeat. The Cards found the Gael line
relatively easy, but failure to add the
extra point again spelled defeat.
Offensively, Stanford and Cal may i
be rated about even, but the Cards
seem to hold the edge on defensive
playing. The strong St. Mary's backs,
who pierced the California line almost
at will, made very few yards through
the Card forward wall. California's
backfield had little trouble scoring
against U.S.C. but was unable to main
tain a big lead.
Man for Man
Lee Valianos and Ulrich Fritchie
have been the mainstays of the Cali
fornia attack this season, Valianos
being a good open-field runner and
Fitchie the foremost line-plunger on
the Bear squad. For Stanford, Affler
baugh and Stevens are the best
threats. Afflerbaugh has made long
runs against every team that the
Cards have gone up against, and
Stevens can generally be depended
upon when a few yards are needed
through the line.
The strength of the California
guards, Swinney and Pascoe, is offset
by the two heavy Stanford tackles,
Choate and Artman, and the rest of
the line measures up about equally.
Taken man for man, there is no over
whelming superiority on either team,
and odds should be about even Satur
day.
Faced with the loss of his first
string center, as the Little Big Game
with the California freshmen nears,
Coach "Husky" Hunt is now trying
to find a man who can fit into his
forward wall without weakening it.
Bill Bates, regular pivot man, had his
knee dislocated in the St. Mary's
game, and will not be able to play
any more this season.
