# VARSITY SOCCER TEAM PREPARES FOR GAME WITH GOLDEN BEARS
## 
### 
Intensive scrimmages between the
first and second varsity soccer teams
are scheduled for this afternoon and
tomorrow in preparation for the first
contest of the three-game series with
the University of California eleven to
be played at Stanford Saturday, No
vember 9.
No varsity practice was held last
night as Coach Harry Maloney wanted
to give his men a much-needed lay-off
after the fast game with the Olympic
Club last Saturday. Assistant Coach
Ward Smith made use of the field in
putting the Frosh shin-bruisers
through their paces.
Maloney is well-pleased with the
showing his team made against the
Olympics last Saturday. The Redshirts
outplayed the club men throughout the
entire second half, and it was only a
long, lucky kick in the last few sec
onds of play that enabled the city
aggregation to eke out a one-point
victory.
The Card forward line displayed
the best teamwork that they have
shown this year and constantly
worked the ball down into the oppos
ing territory. Mujica, and Eberhard,
flashy wingmen, were accurate in
passing and promise to give the Bears
plenty of trouble Saturday.
