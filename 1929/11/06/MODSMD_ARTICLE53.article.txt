# COACH RAGAN PREDICTS CARD TENNIS TEAM TO HAVE BANNER YEAR IN '30
## 
### Edward Peck 
"This year Stanford will have the best
tennis team it has had for a long while,"
are the words of Frank Ragan, new in
structor of tennis. "Johnny Doeg is of
course outstanding, and there are seven
other men any one of whom may be
second man or seventh. We should send
a very superior team East this year and
will make a strong bid for national hon
ors."
Doeg Lauded
Ragan followed Doeg's summer tri
umphs closely, and he predicts that John
ny will rank among the first five of the
nation, probably third or fourth. "Doeg's
forehand is his weakest stroke. We are
going to work hard to perfect it this year.
If we are successful he is likely to be the
national champion. Doeg and George
Lott of Chicago are undoubtedly the best
of the young tennis players in the world.
One of them will be the champion of this
country in two or three years."
Frank Ragan is a tennis player of some
note and a first-rate instructor. In this
capacity he works with Howard Kinsey
at the California Tennis Club in San
Francisco. For a number of years he
played with the San Francisco Olympic
Club. In 1924 he won the national mu
nicipal doubles title with Cranston Hol
man, former Stanford tennis captain.
"Holman at present is at the peak of his

game," remarked Ragan, "and if he were
not busy studying law a good deal would
be heard of him."
"I expect the new project of schedul
ing week-end matches with prominent
players to be very satisfactory. Many of
the boys need only some good stiff com
petition to bring out their best. And ten
nis fans will be able to watch some color
ful exhibitions. I have known Ford Tus
sig a long time and he is just the man
to handle this feature of our tennis pro
gram."
Gledhill Ineligible
In the opinion of Ragan, Keith Gled
hill, national junior champion who is
working out with the team but who is
! ineligible this year, is about on a par with
! Doeg. Gledhill will play next year, and
j with nearly all of the seven contenders
j for second place mentioned by Ragan also
[ returning, 1931 should be another suc
cessful season. Ragan intimated today
that Bobby Sellers, U.C. sensation, will
not play this year.
Frank Ragan is optimistic about the
attitude of the National Lawn Tennis As
sociation toward professionalism. "In the
past they have made some bad mistakes,
especially in regard to Bill Tilden and
Vincent Richards. At present they are
beginning to actually co-operate with the
professional interests, and in a few years
I think we will have open tournaments,
as in golf."

! ineligible this year, is about on a par with
! Doeg. Gledhill will play next year, and
j with nearly all of the seven contenders
j for second place mentioned by Ragan also
[ returning, 1931 should be another suc
cessful season. Ragan intimated today
that Bobby Sellers, U.C. sensation, will
not play this year.
Frank Ragan is optimistic about the
attitude of the National Lawn Tennis As
sociation toward professionalism. "In the
past they have made some bad mistakes,
especially in regard to Bill Tilden and
Vincent Richards. At present they are
beginning to actually co-operate with the
professional interests, and in a few years
I think we will have open tournaments,
as in golf."
"This year Stanford will have the best
tennis team it has had for a long while,"
are the words of Frank Ragan, new in
structor of tennis. "Johnny Doeg is of
course outstanding, and there are seven
other men any one of whom may be
second man or seventh. We should send
a very superior team East this year and
will make a strong bid for national hon
ors."
Doeg Lauded
Ragan followed Doeg's summer tri
umphs closely, and he predicts that John
ny will rank among the first five of the
nation, probably third or fourth. "Doeg's
forehand is his weakest stroke. We are
going to work hard to perfect it this year.
If we are successful he is likely to be the
national champion. Doeg and George
Lott of Chicago are undoubtedly the best
of the young tennis players in the world.
One of them will be the champion of this
country in two or three years."
Frank Ragan is a tennis player of some
note and a first-rate instructor. In this
capacity he works with Howard Kinsey
at the California Tennis Club in San
Francisco. For a number of years he
played with the San Francisco Olympic
Club. In 1924 he won the national mu
nicipal doubles title with Cranston Hol
man, former Stanford tennis captain.
"Holman at present is at the peak of his

game," remarked Ragan, "and if he were
not busy studying law a good deal would
be heard of him."
"I expect the new project of schedul
ing week-end matches with prominent
players to be very satisfactory. Many of
the boys need only some good stiff com
petition to bring out their best. And ten
nis fans will be able to watch some color
ful exhibitions. I have known Ford Tus
sig a long time and he is just the man
to handle this feature of our tennis pro
gram."
Gledhill Ineligible

working out with the team but who is
