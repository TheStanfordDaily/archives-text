Sophomore Cotillion Lines are mak
ing rapid progress toward completion
of plans for the autumn formal to be
given in the Pavilion on November 8,
according to Chairman Art Katzev.
Porters dressed in the traditional
railroad outfits â€”red caps, white coats,
and blue trousers, will be the officials
of the dance. Bill Worthington's Del
Monte Hotel band, which will play
from a platform built to represent an
observation platform, will wear the
same type of uniforms.
Cotillion bids, which are on sale for
$5.00 at the A.S.S.U. office, may also
be obtained from a representative in
every living group on the campus.
