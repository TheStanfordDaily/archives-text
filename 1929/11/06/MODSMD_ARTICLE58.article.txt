# GRAYS TO MEET BEARS IN FINAL GAME OF SEASON
## Cardinal Team Has Not Been Pressed to Win in Any Games This Year 
### Ted DeMotte 
With three easy victories to their
credit, the Stanford Grays will meet
the California Grays Saturday in a
football game preliminary to the Cali
fornia-Stanford freshman battle. The
game will be played in the Stadium at
12:30 o'clock.
So far, the Grays have not been ex
tended to win any of their games.
Coaches Cuddeback and Robesky
have been able to shift their men
about as they pleased, and have been
able to get a good line on their ma
terial. The squad seems to have no
weakness, either in the line or in the
backfield.
While Wilson and Gilbert, who
started the season at halves, have
shown plenty of class, Lambert and
Ketron are now giving the former
plenty of competition for their jobs.
Lambert was especially hard to bring
down in the game with the San Jose
Spartans last Saturday, and was the
principal ground-gainer of the win
' ners. Ketron played a good game at
I safety.
I Gilbert, who went in for Baker at
| full, threw a bunch of long, accurate
passes that went for touchdowns with
Colvin and Hand on the receiving end.
With his ability at passing, Gilbert
will be a real threat in the Cal game,
as he is a slippery open-field runner
and may catch the Bears' defense
napping for a pass.
Hunt, Eby, and Lyons are the main
stays at guard, with a good chance
that Miller will be back in the lineup
for the game. Miller has been out of
the game for a few days on account
of illness, but hopes to get into the
fray. He is pretty handy as a running !
guard on the reverse plays.
Quirk is giving Milligan a hard fight
for the call at center, but Grey and
Doug have their places cinched at
tackle. Grey had an off-day last Sat
urday, making but one out of five at
tempts at goals, but he will no doubt
be back in form for the Cal contest.
Hand and Colvin will probably get
the call at ends, with MacNamara and
Clark ready to go in. Both these men
are big, and bears on defense. Colvin
Is a bit faster and a little more adept
at snagging passes tiian is Hand, but
both are real wing men.
The Grays have shown their true
ability in flashes on several occasions
by pushing over touchdowns with
ease. They will probably have to go at
top speed Saturday, and their top
speed is plenty fast when they get
aroused.

Doug have their places cinched at
tackle. Grey had an off-day last Sat
urday, making but one out of five at
tempts at goals, but he will no doubt
be back in form for the Cal contest.
Hand and Colvin will probably get
the call at ends, with MacNamara and
Clark ready to go in. Both these men
are big, and bears on defense. Colvin
Is a bit faster and a little more adept
at snagging passes tiian is Hand, but
both are real wing men.
The Grays have shown their true
ability in flashes on several occasions
by pushing over touchdowns with
ease. They will probably have to go at
top speed Saturday, and their top
speed is plenty fast when they get
aroused.
With three easy victories to their
credit, the Stanford Grays will meet
the California Grays Saturday in a
football game preliminary to the Cali
fornia-Stanford freshman battle. The
game will be played in the Stadium at
12:30 o'clock.
So far, the Grays have not been ex
tended to win any of their games.
Coaches Cuddeback and Robesky
have been able to shift their men
about as they pleased, and have been
able to get a good line on their ma
terial. The squad seems to have no
weakness, either in the line or in the
backfield.
While Wilson and Gilbert, who
started the season at halves, have
shown plenty of class, Lambert and
Ketron are now giving the former
plenty of competition for their jobs.
Lambert was especially hard to bring
down in the game with the San Jose
Spartans last Saturday, and was the
principal ground-gainer of the win
' ners. Ketron played a good game at
I safety.
I Gilbert, who went in for Baker at
| full, threw a bunch of long, accurate
passes that went for touchdowns with
Colvin and Hand on the receiving end.
With his ability at passing, Gilbert
will be a real threat in the Cal game,
as he is a slippery open-field runner
and may catch the Bears' defense
napping for a pass.
Hunt, Eby, and Lyons are the main
stays at guard, with a good chance
that Miller will be back in the lineup
for the game. Miller has been out of
the game for a few days on account
of illness, but hopes to get into the
fray. He is pretty handy as a running !
guard on the reverse plays.
Quirk is giving Milligan a hard fight
for the call at center, but Grey and
Doug have their places cinched at
tackle. Grey had an off-day last Sat
urday, making but one out of five at
tempts at goals, but he will no doubt
be back in form for the Cal contest.
