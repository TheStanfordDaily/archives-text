# Skits For Football Show Selected By Ram's Head
## 
### 
With a definite purpose to make this
year's football show one in which there
will be more continuity of idea and musi
cal pattern than in previous ones, Ram's
Head Society has decided on several skits
for the gaieties. An act by Paul Speegle
and Burnell Gould, authors of last year's
"A Radio Fiasco"; a skit by Speegle and
Stanley Mullin ; and a burlesque on the
press box on the day of the Big Game,
by Templeton Peck, who was editor of
the Daily last year, are three of the acts
which have been definitely decided on by
Ram's Head. A specialty act with origi
nal music by Grif Williams is being di
rected by Harold Helvenston.
