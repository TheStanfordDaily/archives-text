# NEW TRAFFIC SYSTEM WORKED OUT FOR DAY OF CALIFORNIA GAME
## 
### 
Tn order to prevent the congestion
of traffic noticeable after the U.S.C.-
Stanford game a new system of rout
ing traffic has been worked out by
University officials and will be put
into effect Big Game day.
The difficulty at the U.S.C. game
was caused chiefly when the south
ami north-bound traffic met at the
highway bridge over San Francisquito
creek. To eliminate the highway
from the Stadium to Menlo Park will
be closed to southbound traffic and
used exclusively for cars going toward
San Francisco.
All southbound cars will be forced
to turn south at Santa Cruz Avenue
in Menlo Park. They will then be
routed east across San Francisquito
creek by means of a ford, up Gover
nor's Avenue to Santa Teresa, east
of Santa Teresa past Roble Hall to the
postoffice, from where they will go to
Mayfield and back to the main high
way.
Northbound cars wishing to use the
county bridge which will be ready in
time for the Rig Game and to go to
San Francisco by way of the Skyline
Boulevard will be routed from the
Stadium past the front of the Quad
to Governor's Avenue, up Governor's
Avenue as far as Lake Lagunita, and
then across a short piece of road that
is now being built to the main road
leading across the new bridge.
All the Convalescent Home roads
will be closed to traffic after the game
and as much traffic will be kept off
the Row as possible.
