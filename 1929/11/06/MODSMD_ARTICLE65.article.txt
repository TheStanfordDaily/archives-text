# NANCY CARROLL RENOUNCES INGENUE PARTS; WANTS A NEW LEADING MAN
##

Nancy Carroll would renounce all
claims to "sweet seventeen" ingenue
parts, she revealed in discussing "Illu
sion," the latest production in which
she is leading lady for Buddy Rogers.
Furthermore, Mr. Rogers is not the
type which she prefers to play oppo
site: a man about thirty years old
would suit lier much better, she says.
"It's not that I don't enjoy a lot of
those scenes with Buddy—what girl
wouldn't? He is all that a young girl
could ask for. But I was on the stage
before I went into pictures. 1 can
really act if given half a chance, and
most assuredly these eternal sweet
young ingenues give me no oppor
tunities to characterize.
"I believe that Buddy has been ter
ribly miscast in 'Illusion.' The mascu
line lead calls for a much older man.
If I could pick my own heroes I'd
have men like Clive Brook or Hal
Skelly."
Nancy was one of fourteen children
born on Tenth Avenue, New York.
Her parents bear the good old Irish
name of La Hiff. All of her brothers
and sisters sang and danced around
home, but only Nancy capitalized on
the family talent.
Stage Plans Opposed
Mrs. La Hiff thoroughly disapproved
of the stage, and so when Nancy and
her sister Teresa worked up a little
sister act they went clear across town
to the East Side to try out at a
vaudeville theatre. A friend, Buddy
Carroll, told them to say they were
his sisters —and hence Nancy's pres
ent surname. The two girls' fame as
professional amateurs reached J. J.
Shubert who offered them a job as a
specialty duo in the "Passing Show
of 1923."
All this time the ambitious La Hiffs
had been holding down day positions
as secretaries. They rehearsed for the
Shubert show at night, and, when
finally they had to break the terrible
news of their stage debut to their
God-fearing parents, they did so in
fear and trembling.
After several weeks they persuaded
their mother to come to the theatre,
and eventually the family was won
over. Then Nancy again upset the
La Hiffs by falling in love with and
marrying a young reporter on the
New York News, Jack Kirkland. She
says this is the wisest move she ever
made, for today she is still very much
Mrs. Kirkland.
In "Passing Show"
Nancy danced in the "Passing Show
of 1924" until four months before her
baby Patsy was born. Then during her
enforced idleness she took up inter
viewing for the New York News. She

wrote up many of the leading lights
of the theatre, including Hal Skelly.
Five years later the famous Mr. Skelly
was hired to be Nancy's leading man
in the picture "The Dance of Life."
But interviewing was thrown aside
when Nancy and her husband sud
denly decided to go to Paris. There
she would have the baby and Jack
would turn out the great novel lie had
been planning. They were starting
with just a thousand dollars when
Jack Kirkland was asked to go to
Paris as Tom Mix's press agent at a
salary of $350 a week plus all his and
his wife's expenses.
They had a great time in Paris, but
at the last minute Nancy decided she
wanted her baby born in America.
They came home and Jack went back
onto the New York News and Nancy
onto the stage. Then they came to
California where Jack tried his hand
at scenarios.
Nancy made a hit in musical com
edy on this coast, and after two years
Nancy was discovered by Anne Nich
ols as the perfect type for the pic
turization of "Abie's Irish Rose." Since
then it's been one more movie hit
after another.
