# Roble Bridge Condemned As Unsafe, Is Demolished
## 
### 
Roble footbridge is falling down.
Workmen began yesterday to demolish
that ancient landmark, recently con
demned as unsafe by Comptroller A. E.
Roth. The bridge has been in use for
35 years and will not be replaced imme
diately.
Tentative plans are to construct a dam
at the site of the old bridge and to run
a wagon road across the top of the struc
ture. The San Francisquito Creek waters
backed up by the dam would provide a
water hazard for the new golf course.
