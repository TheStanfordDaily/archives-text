# "NO PARKING" SIGNS INSTALLED TO BETTER TRAFFIC DIFFICULTIES
## 
### 
In an effort to better traffic condi
tions on the campus the University
is installing "No Parking" signs on
the corners around the Quad and on I
the Row. These signs are being put j
at all important intersections and spe
cify that no cars shall be parked '
within 20 feet of the corner.
This measure is being taken by Uni- !
versity officials in an effort to clear I
up congestion and to remove obstruc- j
tions from the view of drivers ap- ;
proaching the corners, it is thought
that this step will greatly minimize
the number of accidents.
The "No Parking" regulations in ef- '
feet on the east side of the street
leading from the Physics corner of
the Quad to Palm Drive will be en- j
forced from now on, according to ;
Comptroller Almon E. Roth. Two new {
parking areas are being constructed ;
for the use of those people who have !
been in the habit of leaving their cars
in this restricted zone.
The field south of the Chemistry j
building is being graded and will be j
opened for parking purposes immedi
ately. The space between the Physics !
building and Sequoia Hall is likewise j
being made into a parking area and
the opening of the two new areas
should provide sufficient space for the j
parking of all cars in that section. I
