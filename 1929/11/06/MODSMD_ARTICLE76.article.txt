# STANFORD PROFESSOR AIDS IN EDITING BOOK ABOUT FRENCH POETRY
## 
### 
A volume of French poetry showing
the change of taste since the World
War is now being compiled by Pro
fessor William Leonard Schwartz of
the Stanford Romantic Languages de
partment, and Ren6 Lalou, a profes
sor and author in France. The work
was started this summer while Pro
fessor Schwartz was in France.
The volume is to contain repre
sentative works of 5G modern French
poets of all types, starting with Le
conte de Lisle and featuring mainly
the three later poets, Baudelaire, Ver
laine, and Rimbaud. There are to be
prose poems and free verse of all
kinds in the collection with repre
sentative selections from both the ris
ing Jewish and Catholic writers. Some
of the most famous war poems will
appear side by side for the first time
in this volume. In order to complete
the poetic movement, the modern
cubist poetry has been included, al
though, according to Professor
Schwartz, this style of writing is very
vague and has little meaning.
"The themes of the new tendencies
of French verse," said Professor
Schwartz, "are mainly of travel, with
some interest in the United States
and an attempt to compete in some
way with the moving picture camera.
The modern poetry is considered
strictly for the elite and educated as
some writers demand of the reader as
much intellectual effort as they them
selves have used in composing the
work."
Professor Schwartz also remarked
that "the technique of free verse, par
ticularly of unrhymed free verse, is
losing ground in France, although this
fact is not realized in the United
States."
Professor Lalou, who is Professor
Schwartz's partner in the compilation
of the volume, is an instructor of Eng
lish at the French school in Paris,
"Lycee Henri IV." Besides his teach
ing, he is famous as an essayist and
author, his most famous book being
the "History of Contemporary French
Literature."
