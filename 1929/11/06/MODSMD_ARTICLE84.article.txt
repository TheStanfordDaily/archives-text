# Freshmen Show Lack Of Enthusiasm For Gym Team
## 
### 
Unless more interest is shown in
the freshman gym team, Stanford's
chances in this sport winter quarter
will be very slim, Coach Royce R.
Long stated last night. There are but
six frosh enrolled for gym this quar
ter, and all those interested should
begin work at once in preparation for
the coming season. Last year the
Card babes defeated Cal, and an en
thusiastic group could repeat the vic
tory this year. Five high-point men in
the annual dual meet with U.C. are
awarded circle numerals, and the
small amount of men taking the work
offers ambitious frosh a good oppor
tunity to obtain awards.
