# Improvements Being Made On Stanford Golf Course
## 
### 
Improvements at the Stanford golf
course are going forward rapidly this
week, according to Graduate Manager
A1 Masters. A road is being built to
tiie site of the proposed clubhouse,
and a "pro" shop and a caddy house
are in process of construction. Since
the building of a clubhouse has not
yet been authorized, it is unlikely
that it will be built this year, Masters
said.
In place of the old Roble bridge,
which was pronounced unsafe and was
torn down yesterday, Masters and A.
E. Roth, comptroller of the Univer
sity, are planning on erecting a small
dam at the bridge site. Tho dam will
back up water for a water hazard for
the course, and will furnish a patii for
people who live in the vicinity. It will
also be a path between the third green
and the fourth tee.
