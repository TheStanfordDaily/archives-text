# Eleven Students Working Under Independent Study
## 
### 
According to Professor E. E. Robin
son, head of the Independent Study
Plan at Stanford, there are eleven stu
dents working under this plan here
thus far this year, as compared with
twelve who took the examination a
year ago.
Remarking on the value of the idea,
Professor Robinson says:
"There is a remarkable appeal for
the development of independent study
in the current Atlantic Monthly, 'Put
ting It Up to the Colleges.' Based on
modern methods of production, it asks
why the university does not present
special work for special students.
"Stanford is one of the few univer
sities in which this is done," he adds.
"Inquiries come here from other in
stitutions, and two men have come to
Stanford for the particular purpose of
pursuing work under this plan."
