SILK SEALING
... a process
to make fine hosiery wear
112 Hosiery threads are maile of
tiny silk fibres wrapped to
gether. Upon these fibres
depends the life of a stock
ing. Once they part, the
thread breaks and a ruinous
run follows.
Silk-Sealing is a method of
making these tiny wisps of
pure silk more enduring. By
a special process each fibre is
sealed in an invisible film
that insulates and strength- ,
ens it. These stronger fibres
make doubly strong threads,
and a hosiery fabric of these
stronger threads will far out
last other hosiery made in
the ordinary way. Pulled
threads and runs become in
frequent; perspiration acids
are no longer a menace, and
with these a new radiant
clarity of fabric has resulted.
Now even the sheerest of
chiffons will wear.
