L Tobacco's
at its best... in
a pipe
MEN'S preference for a man's
smoke — the pipe— is plenty
positive. But do you know why?
We'll tell you.
First, pipe tobacco's different—
for instance, Edgeworth. Second,
tobacco smolders as it should in a
pipe. And third, these mean you get
more satisfaction—greater relish of
the good old savory burley, soothing
fullness of rich smoke.
There's even a fourth reason: you
like good company. The pipe-smok
ing brotherhood is that.
Tobacco's at its best in a pipe. It
gets a chance to be itself there—to
loosen up as it comes to life, to ex
pand and take in air and glow. Only
the choicest leaves get that chance,
moreover, for pipes tell the truth
about tobacco. Choice leaves, choice
blends, and mighty careful han
dling. Edgeworth comes up through
eleven distinct processes before we're
willing to pass it on to you.
If you keep on missing all this,
that's your fault—for we're waiting
to send you your first pipefuls of
Edgeworth. See the coupon? Fill it
out, get a good pipe and the postman
will bring you a neat little glad-to
meet-you packet of good old Edge
worth.
Edgeworth is a careful blend of good
tobaccos—selected especially for pipe
smoking. Its quality and flavor never
change. Buy it anywhere—"Ready
Rubbed" and "Plug Slice"— pocket
package to pound humidor tin.

L Tobacco's
at its best... in
a pipe
MEN'S preference for a man's
smoke — the pipe— is plenty
positive. But do you know why?
We'll tell you.
First, pipe tobacco's different—
for instance, Edgeworth. Second,
tobacco smolders as it should in a
pipe. And third, these mean you get
more satisfaction—greater relish of
the good old savory burley, soothing
fullness of rich smoke.
There's even a fourth reason: you
like good company. The pipe-smok
ing brotherhood is that.
Tobacco's at its best in a pipe. It
gets a chance to be itself there—to
loosen up as it comes to life, to ex
pand and take in air and glow. Only
the choicest leaves get that chance,
moreover, for pipes tell the truth
about tobacco. Choice leaves, choice
blends, and mighty careful han
dling. Edgeworth comes up through
eleven distinct processes before we're
willing to pass it on to you.
If you keep on missing all this,
that's your fault—for we're waiting
to send you your first pipefuls of
Edgeworth. See the coupon? Fill it
out, get a good pipe and the postman
will bring you a neat little glad-to
meet-you packet of good old Edge
worth.
Edgeworth is a careful blend of good
tobaccos—selected especially for pipe
smoking. Its quality and flavor never
change. Buy it anywhere—"Ready
Rubbed" and "Plug Slice"— pocket
package to pound humidor tin.
