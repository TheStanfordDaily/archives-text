MARDEN PARK, SURREY, Eng.,
Nov. 6. â€”Six out of eight persons
aboard a big German airliner bound
from Croydon to Berlin, were killed
today after the pilot had lost his way
in a fog. The machine crashed into a
clump of trees on a hillside and burst
into flames,'trapping three passengers
and three of the crew.
One of the two survivors was Prince
Eugene Scliaumberg-Lippe, second
cousin of a former reigning prince of
one of the oldest German royal
houses. He was acting as second pilot.
The Prince was injured but is ex
pected to recover. The other injured
man, Lieutenant-Commander Glen
Kidston, widely known racing motor
ist, suffered from cuts.
On Way to Berlin
The plane was en route to Berlin
by way of Amsterdam and Hanover.
When she took off from Croydon
everything about her seemed in pro
per order, according to an Imperial
Airways official.
When the machine passed over
Godstone at about 10:30 a.m. it was
flying so low as to be just above
housetops, but this was believed to
be because of poor visibility. An em
ployee of the Godstone Motor Works
said the engine seemed to be func
tioning perfectly, with the pilot mak
ing for Brigton Road apparently to get
his bearings.
