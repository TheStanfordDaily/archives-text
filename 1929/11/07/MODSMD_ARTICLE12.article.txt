# Men's Glee Club To Lead Singing In Rooting Section
## 
### 
Plans for the inclusion of the Stan
ford Men's Glee Club as a unit in the
rooting section at the Big Game this
year were made at a meeting of the
club last night. The object of this
move, according to Director C. Albert
Kulmann, is to improve the singing
of the hymn by the students. He eays
that the phrasing generally used is
very poor, and hopes that the club
may set a good example for the
rooters to follow.
Paul Speegle, head yell leader, was
present at the meeting, and suggested
that the Glee Club appear at the Big
Gam rally as well as at the game.
Three quartets composed of Glee
Club members were formed to go
around to the different living groups
to lead singing of Stanford songs. It
is hoped that by this method every
one will become familiar with the
songs used at games. A yell leader
will accompany each quartet.
