# NEW FRENCH CABINET MAY FALL TODAY
## Socialists Plan Defeat of Tardieu's Government; Policies Outlined 
### 
PARIS, Nov. G. (yP)â€”The new Tar
dieu government, which replaces the
cabinet of Aristide Briand overthrown
October 22, will make its bow to par
liament tomorrow afternoon. Accord
ing to present indications, it will get
a warm reception from friends and
foes alike, and perhaps particularly
from the foes, who are eager to bring
it down as fast as possible.
The radical socialists, who refuse
to collaborate with the ministry, did
not wait for M. Tardieu's declaration
of policy to prepare their attack. They
decided unanimously today to vote
against the government and made the
adverse vote a matter of party disci
pline.
