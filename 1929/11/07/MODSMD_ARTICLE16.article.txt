### 
With Phil Wilson, star halfback,
and Miller, regular guard, back in the
lineup, the Gray football squad will
present its full strength in the game
Saturday at the Stadium with the
California Grays. Miller has been ill
for a few days, while Wilson has been
out of the game with an injured knee.
Last night the team scrimmaged,
using California formations, and all
the first-string men looked good. The
spirit of the squad is especially good
for its final game of the season, which
is expected to extend the players for
the first time this year. All the other
games have been very easy and the
men have gone about them in a rather
matter-of-fact manner, showing real
form only in flashes. The great
strength of the team is in its line,
which has smothered all attacks of
opponents so far.
