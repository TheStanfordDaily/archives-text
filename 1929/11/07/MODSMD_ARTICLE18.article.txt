# Meteoric Force Eclipses Dynamite, Says Webster

### 
"A meteoric fragment traveling at
the rate of 20 miles per second would
have energy equal to 100 times its own
volume in dynamite," said Professor
D. L. Webster in his speech to the
Physics Journal Club yesterday af
ternoon.
Dr. Webster addressed the club on
the subject of the huge meteor which
fell in the northern part of Arizona
about two thousand years ago. The
weight of this meteor has been esti
mated at five to ten million tons and
left a crater three quarters of a mile
across and 170 feet deep. Remarkable
similarity between this crater and
some of those of the moon was shown
by means of photographic slides.
