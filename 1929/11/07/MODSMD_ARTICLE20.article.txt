# CARDS FAVORED TO TRIM HUSKY TEAM SATURDAY
## Warner Takes Thirty-Three Men North; Wet Field Aids Washington 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Swinging onto a northbound train
at 4:30 o'clock yesterday afternoon as
scheduled, thirty-three members of
the Cardinal varsity, accompanied by
Coach Pop Warner, his two assist
ants, senior football manager, and
Trainer Denny, departed for Seattle
amid the thundering plaudits of some
hundred loyal Stanford rooters.
Before leaving, Pop put his charges
through an hour's stiff signal drill,
climaxing a week of concentration on
interference running and aerial work.
Yesterday's practice session will be
the last real workout the Cards have
until the opening gun sounds in the
Seattle Stadium on Saturday after
noon, although Coach Warner is plan
ning to have the players run through
their signals for a short time Friday
morning.
Huskies Work in Rain
Practicing in a driving rain for the
past couple of days, tho big Wash
ington team is working hard to give
the Cardinals a rough reception this
week-end. With oozing weather pre
dicted for Saturday, the Huskies are
taking no chances in excessive fum
bling, and as a consequence have been
running their signals in the slippery
mud of the rockbound Seattle stadium.
This same weather condition is quite
likely to prove a big handicap for the
Cards, as they have not been forced
to play on a muddy field to date this
season.
Incidentally, Saturday's clash will
be the last meeting of Coach Bagshaw
and ten of his Husky players against
the Cardinals. This is Bagshaw's final
year as coach at Washington Univer
sity and he wilP be doing his darned
est this week-end to vindicate him
self in the eyes of Northwestern foot
ball followers. At the same time, Cap
tain Paul Jessup and nine other senior
gridiron men will be out to avenge
their last two defeats at the hands
of Coach Warner's lads.
Jessup Polished Center
Captain Jessup, by the way, is a
towering young fellow of six feet and
seven inches, and is one of the most
polished centers on the Pacific Coast.
Bagshaw is banking on him to smear
up a goodly portion of Stanford's in
tricate reverse and lateral plays.
The rest of the Washington line is
by no means green, and is composed
of brawny, robust giants, who get into
condition each year by working in
various lumber camps of the north
woods. They delight in felling big
trees, but will have their hands full
Saturday stopping the line thrusts of
Chuck Smalling, Herb Fleishhacker,
and Harry Ilillman.
Stombaugh Leads Attack
Although Chuck Carroll, last year's
all-Coast fullback, has been lost
through graduation, the Husky team
is not lacking in first-class backfield
material. Johnny Stombaugh, at half,
is one of the most aggressive ball
packers on the Coast and is expected
to bear the brunt of Washington's at
tack against the Cardinals. Merle
Hufford, at full, boots the pigskin with
the best of them. His long spirals may
put Stanford in a hole from time to
time on Saturday.
