"My approval of interclass, inter
collegiate competition in the Triangu
lar Sports Day held annually between
Mills, California, and Stanford is only
qualified by the provision that each
college places in each sport complete
class teams with adequate substi
tutes," declared Dr. Dyment, medical
advisor for Stanford women.
In varsity competition by women
too much emphasis is frequently
placed on the training of star ath
letes and too little on mass participa
tion of the group. Competition should
follow more closely the plan of foot
ball squads where second- and third
string players are given the same at

tention as the first team is Dr. Dy
ment's opinion.
She expressed the belief that over
doing by individual players was the
only harm of intercollegiate competi
tion, and that this evil could bo safe
guarded against by having substitutes
for all positions on the teams.
"It is possible to participate in inter
collegiate competition and have good
sportsmanship exhibited by every
player," said Dr. Dyment when naked
to discuss the possible rise of a feel
ing of animosity between players of
the three colleges.
"I like the proposed interclass in
tercollegiate plan of competition more
than varsity as the latter is too spe
cialized."
