# Husky Hunt Grooming 1933 Team For Little Big Game On Saturday
## 
### Don Oswill 
With the annual banquet and the
election of Hamilton Hedge to the
captaincy a thing of the past, the
Stanford freshman football team is
now working in earnest for its final
game of the year. Saturday the Cards
meet the University of Caifornia
frosh at 2:30 o'clock in the Stanford
Stadium.
The election of Hedge to lead the
Card babes against the Bears in the
Little Big Game came as no surprise
to those who have kept in close touch
with the football team. While Ham
has not turned in any really brilliant
performances this year, he has been
one of the most consistent line-men
on the squad. Hedge was handicapped
during the early part of the season
with a bad leg, but will be in good
shape for the game with California,
where his steady playing will undoubt
edly bolster the Card forward wall.
Hunt Misses Bates
Coach "Husky" Hunt will miss Bill
Bates at center as a leg injury is cer
tain to keep him from seeing action
in Saturday's contest. John Card, the
boy whom Hunt has been grooming
for Bates' shoes at the pivot position,
is improving with every practice, but
will be hard put to fill the hole left
vacant by the injury to Bates.
In practice last night, Hunt had his
charges working to perfect a defense
against passes. The frosh regulars
looked very impressive at stopping
the aerial attack of the second and
third teams, beside uncorking a neat
overhead attack of their own.

Somewhere in the fog-covered foot
hills of Berkeley, Coach "Brick" Mit
chell is putting the finishing touches
on his freshman grid machine. The
California frosh took a new lease on
life after their creditable showing
against the Trojan yearlings, cham
pions of the "big three." In this ocn
test the Bears piled up a 19 to 0 lead
on the hitherto unscored Trobabe
team, and although U.C. lost later by
a 21 to 19 count, they came much
closer to upsetting the dope than any
one thought they would. -
Up to their meeting with the Tro
jans, the Cal frosh had played indif
ferent football despite the fact that a
wealth of good material was available.
The Bears really came out of their
slump two weeks ago, when they
whipped the 250 th Coast Artillery

team 50 to 0.
The Cardinal babes have been im
proving with every contest. They got
off to a rather poor start, but in face
of an unusually stiff schedule, have
built up a powerful defense and an
effective attack. Ken Afflerbaugh and
Wes Stevens, playing halfback and
fullback respectively, have borne the
brunt of the offense for Stanford all
through the season, and they will
probably play a major port in Satur
day's game.
Coach "Husky" Hunt, and his as
sistant, Jimmy Bradshaw, are con
cocting several new formations and
combinations to thrust at the Bear
yearlings in the final game of the sea
son.

on the hitherto unscored Trobabe
team, and although U.C. lost later by
a 21 to 19 count, they came much
closer to upsetting the dope than any
one thought they would. -
Up to their meeting with the Tro
jans, the Cal frosh had played indif
ferent football despite the fact that a
wealth of good material was available.
The Bears really came out of their
slump two weeks ago, when they
whipped the 250 th Coast Artillery

team 50 to 0.
The Cardinal babes have been im
proving with every contest. They got
off to a rather poor start, but in face
of an unusually stiff schedule, have
built up a powerful defense and an
effective attack. Ken Afflerbaugh and
Wes Stevens, playing halfback and
fullback respectively, have borne the
brunt of the offense for Stanford all
through the season, and they will
probably play a major port in Satur
day's game.
Coach "Husky" Hunt, and his as
sistant, Jimmy Bradshaw, are con
cocting several new formations and
combinations to thrust at the Bear
yearlings in the final game of the sea
son.
With the annual banquet and the
election of Hamilton Hedge to the
captaincy a thing of the past, the
Stanford freshman football team is
now working in earnest for its final
game of the year. Saturday the Cards
meet the University of Caifornia
frosh at 2:30 o'clock in the Stanford
Stadium.
The election of Hedge to lead the
Card babes against the Bears in the
Little Big Game came as no surprise
to those who have kept in close touch
with the football team. While Ham
has not turned in any really brilliant
performances this year, he has been
one of the most consistent line-men
on the squad. Hedge was handicapped
during the early part of the season
with a bad leg, but will be in good
shape for the game with California,
where his steady playing will undoubt
edly bolster the Card forward wall.
Hunt Misses Bates
Coach "Husky" Hunt will miss Bill
Bates at center as a leg injury is cer
tain to keep him from seeing action
in Saturday's contest. John Card, the
boy whom Hunt has been grooming
for Bates' shoes at the pivot position,
is improving with every practice, but
will be hard put to fill the hole left
vacant by the injury to Bates.
In practice last night, Hunt had his
charges working to perfect a defense
against passes. The frosh regulars
looked very impressive at stopping
the aerial attack of the second and
third teams, beside uncorking a neat
overhead attack of their own.

Somewhere in the fog-covered foot

California frosh took a new lease on
