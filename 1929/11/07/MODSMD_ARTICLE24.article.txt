# Husky Hunt Grooming 1933 Team For Little Big Game On Saturday

### Don Oswill 
With the annual banquet and the
election of Hamilton Hedge to the
captaincy a thing of the past, the
Stanford freshman football team is
now working in earnest for its final
game of the year. Saturday the Cards
meet the University of Caifornia
frosh at 2:30 o'clock in the Stanford
Stadium.
The election of Hedge to lead the
Card babes against the Bears in the
Little Big Game came as no surprise
to those who have kept in close touch
with the football team. While Ham
has not turned in any really brilliant
performances this year, he has been
one of the most consistent line-men
on the squad. Hedge was handicapped
during the early part of the season
with a bad leg, but will be in good
shape for the game with California,
where his steady playing will undoubt
edly bolster the Card forward wall.
