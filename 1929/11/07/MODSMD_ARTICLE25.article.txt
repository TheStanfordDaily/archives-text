# Washburn, Center Half, To Lead Frosh Soccer Team
## 
### 
Charles Washburn, star center half,
will captain the freshman soccer team
for 1929. The new captain has been
a bulwark of defense throughout the
preliminary games, and is easily the
outstanding player of the frosh eleven.
After an unsuccessful practice sea
son, the 1933 squad will attempt to re
deem itself in the three-game series
with the California Cubs. The open
ing game will be played here Satur
day. Lack of experienced material has
handicapped Coach Maloney, and the
Cardinals will enter the series as un
derdogs.
