# UNIVERSITY BARS AIR TRAFFIC TO BIG GRID GAMES
## Safety Consideration Causes Officials to Close Campus Field to Football Traffic Proximity of Crowded Parking Areas to Airport Given As Reason for Decision 
### 
Coming aa a distinct surprise to all
those who have been interested 1n the
Palo Alto School of Aviation and its
connection with campus events, an
announcement that the aviation field
would be closed to all traffic on the
day of the Stanford-California and
Stanford-Army games was made by
Almon E. Roth, University comptrol
ler, late yesterday.
This action has been taken for the
sake of safety after a study of the
congestion at the Stanford-U.S.C.
game when the number of planes
bringing passengers to the game
greatly exceeded the expectations of
University officials.
Roth's Statement
Comptroller Roth's complete state
ment is as follows: "Owing to the
congestion of automobiles in the park
ing areas immediately adjacent to the
Stanford flying field on the days of
big football games the University,
with the concurrence of Lieut. Nor
man Goddard, lessee of the field, has
decided that it will be inadvisable to
permit any planes to either land or
take off from this field on the days of
the Stanford-U.C. and Stanford-Army
games.
"The flying field will be closed on
these days and notices to this effect
will be sent to all registered owners
of aircraft in the state.
People Airminded
"The fact that 89 planes were
parked on the Stanford field at one
time on the day of the Stanford-U.S.C.
game is indicative of the airminded
ness of the people of this state. The
University authorities had no idea
that any such number of planes would
use the Stanford field.
"It regrets that this unique feature
of accommodating aircraft at such
close proximity to a great stadium
cannot be continued but feels that in
the interests of safety to both auto
mobiles and planes the field should
be closed."
