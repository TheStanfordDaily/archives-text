# A 						STEP TOWARD COSMOPOLITANISM

As a result of its usual lucubration, the Executive Committee took
definite steps to crystallize an age-old Stanford attitude when it created
the Committee on Student Relations Tuesday night with the special pur
pose of bringing Oriental students into the life of the University.
Stanford has long been proud of its cosmopolitan atmosphere. There
are Orientals on the debating squad. Members of the Japanese and Chi
nese Clubs compete with the Caucasian groups in intramural athletics.
They are as important in the student body as other Stanford men and
women, and are treated so.
With the Orient looming as the Mecca for Western trade and com
merce, it is particularly fitting that Stanford men and women should
become acquainted with other Stanford students from the East. It is the
object of the Student Relations Committee to further promote this friend
ship.
The success of any movement of this kind depends on the tolerance
and sincerity of the majority in desiring to start and carry on the social
intercourse.
Unknowingly, perhaps, the Executive Committee has taken action that
will be more far-reaching than can be prophesied at the present time. The
students of today are the men and women in world affairs of tomorrow
and they will be influenced by the background they obtained while in
college.
