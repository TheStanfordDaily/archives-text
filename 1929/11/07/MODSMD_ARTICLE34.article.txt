# THE 						WOMEN COME TO LIFE

### 
A portion of Stanford's embattled 500 displayed unwonted spirit
Tuesday evening when the W.A.A. Board declared itself out of sympathy
with the existing manner of conducting the annual triangular sports day
among women athletes of Stanford, the University of California, and
Mills College.
The Daily is heartily in sympathy with this sentiment. The old sys
tem whereby mixed class teams competed against other mixed class teams
instead of school competing against school, is as out of date as the tandem
bicycle.
Physical education for women is as important as athletics for men.
The fact that the women are less spectacular than the men in their mus
cular prowess does not mean that their physical well-being should be em
phasized less.
Feminine intercollegiate athletic competition will undoubtedly stimu
late more interest among the women students of the three schools in one
year than could be aroused in ten years of the glorified play days that have
been the custom.
