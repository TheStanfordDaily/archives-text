### 
Stanford's more or less staid arcades will be permeated with jocose
ness this week-end; waggishncss will exude from every pore; merriment
will run rampant.
Yes, boys and girls, prepare for a hearty laugh. The Old Boy is enter
taining his playmates for the week-end when members of the Western
Association of College Comics gather here for a three-day orgy of persi
flage.
The Daily welcomes this humorist squadron and holds its editorial
sides in anticipation of a real side-splitting. If any of the comic kings
land here short of material let them look into the Cellar coffee, Encina
Commons, Roble Hall, and the Stanford Assembly Hall. There's inspira
tion for them.
