RIVER HOUSE, Stark Young. Charles
Scribner's Sons, 1929. At Stanford
Bookstore.
"River House" is like the little girl
with the curl In the middle of her
forehead.
"When she was good, she was very,
very good,
And when she was bad she was
horrid."
This novel is top-heavy with inci
dental material, inconsequential con
versations, irrelevant descriptions,
and characters that fail to justify any
legitimate purpose they might serve
in this story. The action waddles to
an inevitable but unconclusive point
which gives Mr. Young an excuse for
laying down his pen. He takes too
many words to launch his plot and
too few to bring it to port. The psy
chological analysis which the story
needs and which the author is plainly
capable of providing is lacking.
"River House" is the conflict of
ideals, ideas, generations, the Old
South and the New, an old man with
his son, and of a boy and a girl who
turn sex into a combat. The timbers
of the plot creak a great deal under
the strain of the struggling elements,
but none of them give. The old Major
is firm to the last and his puerile son,
John, simply perambulates out of the
house one fine moonlit evening, boards
a train for Memphis, and ends the
story.
The two most powerful scenes in
the entire book concern desire. They
are intense, graphic, almost terrible.
The love of Evelyn and John began
with physical attraction. There is a
question of how it will end.
The author of "River House" has
an excellent insight into the problems
of life. His work is predominantly
realism but is sensibly tempered with
that vague thing known as romanti
cism. Reminiscing on anything so de
lightful as old Southern life is danger
ous. Novel readers are fortunate that
Stark Young does not take the dubi
ous position so well maintained by
the honorable James Branch Cabell
but so ill-suited to writers with pho
tographic pens, that the highest mis
sion of art is to write beautifully of
beautiful happenings.
The charm of this novel lies in its
profusion of amusing and romantic
Southern anecdotes, in its excellent
presentation of dialect and provincial
ism, and in the author's power of de
scription. —B. P.

"THE CLIMAX"—At the President
Theatre.
Schiller said there were thirty-six
dramatic situations; Goethe tried to
find more and failed to find as many;
playwrights since have been unable
to add to this list. So don't let the
fact that "The Climax" at the Presi
dent theatre revolves about the age
old plot of a woman's struggle be
tween love and a career discourage
you from seeing it.
Even if Edward Locke had not given
this classical situation a delightful
treatment, the superb acting of Guy
Bates Post would lift the production
into the class of fine drama.
The story is that of an orphan who
aspires to follow her mother's career
in opera. Under the tutelage of her
uncle, once a famous baritone, she
has reached the point where only a
slight organic weakness in the voice
holds her from her great desire. A
young doctor, a childhood beau from
the home town in the middlewest, al
though he disapproves of her stage
aspirations because they keep her
from him, agrees to have her throat
strengthened by an operation. Follow
ing the operation, she finds herself
no longer able to sing, however, and
consents to marry the doctor.
The day of the wedding her voice
returns, and her fiance admits that
he has kept her from singing by the
power of suggestion, that he might
turn her from her career to a life of
domesticity. She sends the young man
away, but her uncle, whose life has
been wrapped up in her career, con
vinces her that love is the greatest
thing, and as the curtain falls she
sees what she has sacrificed and for
gives.
Post, as the uncle, gives just such
a performance as one would expect
from an actor of his finesse; his work
is too familiar to need further praise.
The others of the cast (which has but
four members) are not quite up to
him. Myra Hubert, as the girl, has
talent, poise, and a magnetic person
ality, but lacks restraint. Gale Gor
don, as the doctor, does well but not
brilliantly. We are indebted to Man
uel Galea, who portrays the old musi
cian's son, for some fine music from
the piano. But although he overplays
his part, he deserves credit for han
dling it as well as he has, for it is a
very difficult one.
—Joseph Sill.
