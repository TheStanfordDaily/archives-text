# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD...
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF NOVEMBER 7, 1904 
### 
"We want to remember that when
we are on the Californians' campus,
we are in a sense their guests and I
do not want any Stanford student to
take away any property from the
Berkeley campus," said Dr. Jordan in
a University assembly on Novem
ber 7.
"If you win the game next Satur
day, I believe the field is yours, but
that is all that is yours, and you can't
take even that away with you," he
concluded.
"Sweet Clover" was booked at the
California Theatre as the feature on
the night of the Big Game. Several
comedians from the Orpheum were
engaged for specialty skits between
the acts of the feature, and the Uni
versity Glee and Mandolin Clubs were
also to entertain at the football show.
At a combined meeting, the Musical
Clubs decided not to make an ex
tended tour of the South that year
due to the lack of specialty men and
in order to make up the deficit in

curred in 1903. The Executive Com
mittee granted permission to the
Clubs to make the trip, but the men
unanimously decided against it.

In a Campus Opinion to the editor
of the Daily Palo Alto, a woman stu
dent suggested that each woman of
the student body carry a small cardi
nal "S" pennant. "This would show
their loyalty to Stanford and make
the Stanford section appear more ad
vantageously," she stated.
An editorial read, "A yell leader,
like any other man chosen to a posi
tion of leadership, is to be regarded
as the one to give directions. Even
though the suggestion of the yell
| leader may sometimes be not so good
as that of some other individual in the
stands, his directions must be fol
lowed. It certainly must not be given
anyway by a small part of the root
ers."
