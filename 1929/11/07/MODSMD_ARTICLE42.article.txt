The Editor, Sir:
An editorial in Tuesday's "Daily"
called attention to Stanford's "first
tradition." I am heartily in favor of
the continuance of that tradition.
Smoking should be done elsewhere
than on the Quad.
But has anyone noticed the litter of
cigarette stubs which clutters the
walk and steps to the library? Aes
thetic reasons apply there as well as
on the Quad, it seems to me. To elimi
nate smoking in front of the library
would not be necessary, however, if
some provision could be made for the
disposal of the unsightly stubs. It
would not be much trouble to deposit
extinct stubs in a container which
would keep them out of sight and I
am sure that the larger majority of
the students would prefer unlittered
steps. —Inveterate Smoker.
