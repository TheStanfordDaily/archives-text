"Preliminary drafts for the final re
port of the Klamath River Study Com
mission will be started within the next
three weeks," said Dean Theodore
Hoover, on his return from San Fran
cisco yesterday, where he presided
as chairman of the committee.
"After eighteen months of study
and investigation into the needs of
the Klamath River Basin, the commit
tee now feels that the time has come
when the compromise between the
sportsmeu of the state and the power
companies, now in control, should be
affected," said Hoover.
