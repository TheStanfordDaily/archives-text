# Geology Students Plan Trip To Coast Saturday
## 
### 
Students in Engineering Geology
under Siemon Muller will leave the
Geology corner at 8 o'clock Saturday
morning for a field trip into the Coast
Range west of Palo Alto and Redwood
City.
The San Andreas fault is the main
point of interest, for it was movement
along this fault which caused the San
Francisco earthquake in 1906. From
there the geologists will go to Half
moon Bay and vicinity to study the
action of the waves on the coastline.
