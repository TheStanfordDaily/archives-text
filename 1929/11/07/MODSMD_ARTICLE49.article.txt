# HARD GAMES FEATURE MURAL FOOTBALL WITH LONG RUNS NUMEROUS
## 
### 
A last-minute rush by El Tigro fell
short when McCandless knocked down
a pass over the goal line to insure
victory for the Dekes 7-2 in yester
day afternoon's intramural football
game. Marx ran forty-five yards after
catching a pass to make the Dekes'
lone touchdown. The clubmen's two
points were gained on a safety after
the Dekes marched toward their own
goal on a prolonged series of back
ward passes.
Woerner scored all the points as
Delta Tau Delta downed Theta Chi
13-0. The Delt back ran fifty yards to
one score after intercepting a pass,
and made the other touchdown on a
short toss from scrimmage.
Breakers defeated the Fijis 19-0.
Flashy runs by Hables gave the ne
cessary edge to the club gridders.
A forty-yard run by Magee pro
duced the lone touchdown of the
Theta Xi-El Campo tilt won by the
fraternity men 6-0. Worsley and Picliel
were also outstanding for Theta Xi.
Thomas and Gist featured for the
losers.
