LET IT RAIN
Once more the Husky is a toothless
mongrel! So far this season he has
been kicked around the field at will
by each and every team to face liiin
in the Conference race. His snarl has
degenerated into a mere yap!
So say reports floating down to the
Farm from the Northwest. The Wash
ington team is heralded as a sot-up
for the Cards on Saturday.
Yet, Pop and his thirty-three
sturdy men have refused to give a
fig for these rumors. And they
well have their reasons for doing
so.
For one thing, the Old Fox has al
ready looked over the Washington
squad this season. Not so long ago, he
made a hurried trip to Seattle to
scout the Husky-Trojan stampede.
And although Jones' players piled up
48 points against their Northern foe,
Pop convinced himself right then and
there that Stanford would find the
going plenty tough when she tangled
with Washington a few weeks hence.
For no sooner had he settled back
comfortably to watch the onslaught,
than the Huskies unleashed a potent
attack that swept the Thundering
Herd before them. For ten minutes
Washington held the upper hand.
Then a penalty, followed closely by a
doubtful official's decision, and Coach
Enoch Bagshaw's men went complete
ly to pieces. The vicious Husky sud
denly turned into a slinking cur.
Why, then, should Pop be at all
worried over Saturday's battle?
To tell the truth, there are a num
ber of excellent reasons. Washington
is always a slow starter, and is usu
ally knocked around a bit before get
ting under way. But no matter how
weak the Seattle outfit appears in
early-season games, it always plays a
good game against the Cardinals.
Without exception, the Husky bares
his fangs as soon as he gets a whiff
of tSanford meat!
Last year was a typical exam
ple. On that occasion the Cards
were touted as cinches. The
Husky was more decrepit than a
lap-hound. But what a pooch he
turned ouj: to be! He actually out
played the Redshirts for most of
the contest, only to lose out by a
score of 12 to 0 when Stanford
took to the air.
The situation is always worse when
Pop takes his lads up to the land of
big timbers. The Huskies take great
pride in cocking over the Redshirts
before their home town natives. Glanc
ing back through pigskin records to
1925, one sees that Washington won
the Conference title that year by
bowling over the Cards in her North
ern lair. Coached by this same Mr.
Bagshaw, the Huskies succeeded in
stopping tlie great Ernie Nevers cold.
Touted as a grudge fight by al
most every grid critic on the
Coast, Stanford went North again
in 1927 and was quite lucky to
come out on top. The Redshirts
played without a single fumble
that day despite a wet and muddy
field. The slippery gridiron proved
to be the Huskies' own undoing,
as the Cardinals blocked a punt
to score their winning points.
This year, however, Bagshaw is
seeing to it that his charges don't let
victory slip away from them because
of oozing muck. For the Washington
boys have been practicing in the rain

during the past few days.
The Husky has become water
dog, as well as under-dog!
It seems as though the Cards are
in for a splashing good time on Satur
day, as the clouds have been crying
their eyes out all week in the Seattle
stadium. At any rate, the game will
not be a dry affair, and although Pop
hasn't provided his boys with water
wings he has taught them some useful
strokes that may come in handy.
