Quad pictures taken should do so im
mediately if they want them in the
book," says Stanley Milne, editor. As

almost been completed, there is very
little time left in which to have pic
tures taken. Seniors in Palo Alto have
been especially slow in making ap
pointments. Proofs should be called
for and returned as soon as possible.

calling Palo Alto 6161, or by stopping
at the Women's Clubhouse from 9 to
12 or 1 to 5 o'clock. Before having a

The price of a senior Quad is seven
dollars.
