Wear Ranleigh Coats !
to the Game!
And Other Outdoor Events, 1500
You Ve seen them of course —the swag'
ger belted alpacas (so soft they resemble
nutria) and the coats of warm fine camel's
hair trimmed with raccoon. They're real
football coats and they feel mighty com'
fortable afterwards, riding home. As
usual the college crowd look to our
Ranleigh Shop for the suitable thing, the
smart thing, and the reasonably priced
thing and we believe no other shop
launches quite so i iany successes!
