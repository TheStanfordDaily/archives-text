### 
Three residents of Palo Alto were
injured last night when a mob of
approximately 150 Stanford freshmen
swarmed into the New Stanford Thea
tre, manhandled employees, and riot
ously took possession of the show
house.
Mrs. Kenneth E. Bell, Baywood, re
ceived two dislodged vertebrae when
a frosh invader kicked her in the
back of the neck while climbing over
chairs. Mrs. Bell was removed to her
home and placed under the immediate
care of Dr. Tom Ashlock.
Ernest P. O'Hair, 729 Waverley
street, an usher, in a futile attempt
to quiet the surge of onrushing frosh,
was struck in the face. He received a
split lip and numerous bruises.
Louis Gardner, 257 Kingsley street,
ticket-taker, was severely bruised
when he attempted to quiet the mill
ing crowd of frosh, determined to
gain free admittance to tlie show.
Five policemen were rushed to the
scene of the riot. After creating an
uproarious disturbance within the
theatre, one of the frosh ringleaders
shouted, "On to the Varsity!" The
idea swept contagiously through Class
of '33 disturbers. There was a rush for
the exits.
Once outside, the mob was placed
under control by the Palo Alto patrol
men. Sight of officers quieted the de
creasing band of frosh raiders. The
disturbing group was soon disbanded.
Coming as an aftermath of the Lit
tle Big Game Pajamarino held at
Itoble Hall earlier in the evening, the
enthusiastic crowd of frosh decided
to "crash" the Palo Alto theatres.
Similar disturbances occurred last
year, but no injuries were reported.
Theatre property was undamaged
when the 1928 "crash" was staged.
An investigation of the tumult will
be conducted, the police department
indicated.
