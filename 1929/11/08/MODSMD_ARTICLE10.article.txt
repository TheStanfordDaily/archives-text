# RELATIVE VOCATIONAL APTITUDES OF RACES TO BE STUDIED HERE
## 
### 
A study of the vocational aptitude
of the Japanese as compared to the
Caucasians is to be begun by the
Psychology Department, Edward K.
Strong, Jr., Professor of Psychology,
announced yesterday. Strong, who is
to conduct this investigation, devised
the vocational interest test in use
here in the University and has done
considerable other work along this
line.
"The general summary of present
data seems to indicate that the Japa
nese and the white people are equal
as far as intelligence is concerned,"
Strong said. "The object of my study
is to determine whether they are
equal in other respects.
"School teachers tell us that the
Japanese pupils as a rule have more
artistic ability than the Caucasion
pupils," he continued. "I hope that
their vocational aptitude in other
lines can be compared through this
investigation."
The comparison is to be restricted
to boys of high school and college age.
Professor Strong stated that a study
of Jjoth sexes would be valuable but
too expensive. He expects to spend
at least two years on this research.
