"Induce all high-school football stars
to attend the University of Califor
nia."
That was the supplication made to
the San Francisco Commercial Club
and addressed to alumni of the state
by radio broadcast yesterday after
noon by "Brick" Muller, former all-
American end and line coach at
Berkeley.
He stressed the necessity of influ
encing high-school athletes in their
choice of universities.
"You don't have to offer the boys
money or pay their expenses, but
there is nothing wrong in helping
them to get a job. We have a wonder
ful coach, and California is on the
up-grade in football. Now is the time
to stock ourselves with good material
to help us stay on top," Muller de
clared.
Referring to the Carnegie report,
he pooh-poohed the findings and said
that the University of California had
a clean slate. "We offer to help stu
dents get jobs, but that goes for non
athletes as well."
