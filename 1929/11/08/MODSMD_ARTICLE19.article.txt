# HUSKY LINE TO START FOR GRAY ELEVEN IN CALIFORNIA CONTEST
## 
### 
Starting a team that is as heavy as
most varsities, the Stanford Grays
will enter the game with the Cali
fornia Grays tomorrow decided favo
rites. From end to end, the line aver
ages 190 pounds to the man, and no
man weighs less than 185 pounds.
The starting backfield will average
around 170 pounds, with one small
man bringing down the average.
Coaches Cuddeback and Robesky plan
to start Baker or Gilbert at full,
Hardy at quarter, and Lambert and
Ketron at halves. Gilbert and Lam
bert have shown plenty the last few
days at running, and Gilbert surprised
last Saturday by heaving a bunch of
long passes that went for touchdowns.
Baker had done the passing before
that. Lambert made many yards on
reverse plays after his interference
had all been taken out, and showed a
lot of fight.
In the line, Colvin and Hand will
start at ends, Doub and Grey at
tackles, Eby or Miller and Hunt at
guards, and Milligan at center. Miller
is the best bet to start, as he excels
Eby at running interference.
The Grays have plenty of reserves
for all the positions on the team with
the exception of tackles. The San
Jose Spartans went through the Gray
line for a touchdown after Doub and
Grey had been taken out, so these
huskies will probably stay the full
time Saturday. Grey's ability to boot
goals from the field is expected to
add a few points to the team's total
tomorrow.
