# BEAR, CARDINAL BABE SQUADS TO TANGLE IN ANNUAL CLASSIC
## Coach Husky Hunt's Redshirts Will Have New Formations For Tomorrow's Little Big Game; Afflerbaugh, Stevens Key Men of Yearling Offense 
### DON OSWILL 
CLIMAXING the freshman football season of 1929, yearling teams of Stanford
and the University of California meet in the Stadium here tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 in the "Little Big Game," the prelude to the annual hostili
ties of the two varsity teams, scheduled this year for November 23.
Both teams come into the game with their records blemished by defeats
by the Southern California freshmen, so that the contest has resolved itself
into a fight to keep out of the "little conference" cellar. The Stanford frosh
were defeated 13 to 0 in mid-season by the Trojans, while the California

»team last Saturday bowed to the
Southerners by a 21 to 19 count.
Babes Drill
Coach "Husky" Hunt last night put
his Stanford charges through their
I last practice of the season. This ses
i sion consisted mainly of a short .signal
drill and a chalk talk, topped off by
j the usual exercises. The entire squad
; was in uniform with the exception of
Bill Bates, regular center, who sus
tained a leg injury last week which
is slated to keep him on the bench.
Last year the Cards provided the
biggest upset in freshman football
circles, by defeating the Bears 7 to 6
| after the dopesters had conceded them
only a bare chance. This season both
; teams are rated about on a par. In
. games to date, the performances of
| one have not overshadowed the other,
I U.C. making the better scores against
, Santa Clara and U.S.C. and Stanford
trouncing U.C.L.A. and putting up a
j strong game against St. Mary's.
Coach Hunt will have several new
: formations to thrust against the Bears
tomorrow. He has worked all week to
i improve the offense of the Redshirts.
The Cards demonstrated that they
have a capable defense, by holding
the vaunted St. Mary's team to a
single touchdown last week.
Bear Stars
For California, Valianos and Fritchie
: are expected to bear the brunt of the
j ball-carrying. The former specializes
jat packing the pigskin around the
ends, while Fritchie is the de
i pendable line-plunger on the Califor
! nia squad.
Ken Afflerbaugh and Wes Stevens
will probably see a lot of action
against the Cubs tomorrow. Affler
baugh is Hunt's best backfield man;
: he passes well, is a good punter, and
j is a very dangerous open-field runner.
Stevens specializes at hitting the line,
and can generally be counted on for
! the necessary yards.
Tomorrow's game, from the stand-
I point of intercollegiate rivalry, is the
outstanding contest in this section of
I the Pacific Coast, as the Stanford var
| sity is playing Washington at Seattle,
and the Bears at Berkeley are con
ceded an easy time with Montana.
The probable startling line-ups are:
Stanford— California —

CLIMAXING the freshman football season of 1929, yearling teams of Stanford
and the University of California meet in the Stadium here tomorrow
afternoon at 2:30 in the "Little Big Game," the prelude to the annual hostili
ties of the two varsity teams, scheduled this year for November 23.
Both teams come into the game with their records blemished by defeats
by the Southern California freshmen, so that the contest has resolved itself
into a fight to keep out of the "little conference" cellar. The Stanford frosh
were defeated 13 to 0 in mid-season by the Trojans, while the California

»team last Saturday bowed to the
Southerners by a 21 to 19 count.
Babes Drill
Coach "Husky" Hunt last night put
his Stanford charges through their
I last practice of the season. This ses
i sion consisted mainly of a short .signal
drill and a chalk talk, topped off by
j the usual exercises. The entire squad
; was in uniform with the exception of
Bill Bates, regular center, who sus
tained a leg injury last week which
is slated to keep him on the bench.
Last year the Cards provided the
biggest upset in freshman football
circles, by defeating the Bears 7 to 6
| after the dopesters had conceded them
only a bare chance. This season both
; teams are rated about on a par. In
. games to date, the performances of
| one have not overshadowed the other,
I U.C. making the better scores against
, Santa Clara and U.S.C. and Stanford
trouncing U.C.L.A. and putting up a
j strong game against St. Mary's.
Coach Hunt will have several new
: formations to thrust against the Bears
tomorrow. He has worked all week to
i improve the offense of the Redshirts.
The Cards demonstrated that they
have a capable defense, by holding
the vaunted St. Mary's team to a
single touchdown last week.
Bear Stars
For California, Valianos and Fritchie
: are expected to bear the brunt of the
j ball-carrying. The former specializes
jat packing the pigskin around the
ends, while Fritchie is the de
i pendable line-plunger on the Califor
! nia squad.
Ken Afflerbaugh and Wes Stevens
will probably see a lot of action
against the Cubs tomorrow. Affler
baugh is Hunt's best backfield man;
: he passes well, is a good punter, and
j is a very dangerous open-field runner.
Stevens specializes at hitting the line,
and can generally be counted on for
! the necessary yards.
Tomorrow's game, from the stand-
I point of intercollegiate rivalry, is the
outstanding contest in this section of
I the Pacific Coast, as the Stanford var
| sity is playing Washington at Seattle,
and the Bears at Berkeley are con
ceded an easy time with Montana.
The probable startling line-ups are:
Stanford— California —
