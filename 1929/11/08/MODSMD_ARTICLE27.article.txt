# Col. McCabe To Address Military Smoker Tonight
## 
### 
"A slap on the back is worth two
kicks in the pants," said Colonel E. R.
W. McCabe, in relating the highlights
of his military career at a smoker
given by Scabbard and Blade in the
El Cuadro clubroom in Encina Com
mons last night.
Colonel McCabe told of humorous
incidents throughout his army life,
which began in Virginia in 1900, and
included the Spanish American and
World War. In the late war he divided
his time between commanding regi
ments and serving as a staff officer,
during which time he was active in
many of the European capitals.
Two new officers of the Military De
partment were introduced before
Colonel McCabe's talk, after which
Herb Wenig gave a humorous account
of R.O.T.C. camp life. Fred Cook and
Bill Chatham entertained with comic
monologues in the form of parodies
on officers of camp.
About two hundred advanced course
military students were present, and
the meeting ended with impromptu
singing of a field artillery march.
