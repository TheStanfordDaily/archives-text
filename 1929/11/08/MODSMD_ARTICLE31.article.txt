# THE 						STANFORD SPIRIT AND THE STANFORD FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Stanford freshmen — 150 of them — unaccustomed to Stanford
traditions of sobriety stormed the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto
last night and injured a member of the audience when they let their
enthusiasm for the Little Big Game overcome their common sense.
The Class of 1933 evidently has been misled about the Stanford
spirit from high schoolish conceptions of the conduct of college
men and women. Such acts are contrary to the policy of the student
body and are regarded with disdain here. Not only were innocent
parties injured but the name of the University was defiled.
Members of the freshman class should remember that Stanford
students back their teams with a display of genuine spirit and not
by childish show of mob action.
The Stanford spirit since the founding of the University has
been a source of pride to all Stanford students. It is the duty of
this year's freshmen to grasp this revered tradition. The name and
reputation of the University rests in their hands. Their acts in
the future should be tempered with the primary law of the student
body—conduct becoming Stanford gentlemen.
