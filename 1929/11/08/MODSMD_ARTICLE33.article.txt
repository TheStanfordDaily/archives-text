# DR. JORDAN AND THE D.A.R.'S
## 
### 
Months ago Daughters of the American Revolution placed the name
of David Starr Jordan, Chancellor Emeritus of Stanford, on a blacklist—
a blacklist which carried the names of notable exponents of peace.
Now comes the Palo Alto D.A.R. chapter with an Armistice Day reso
lution commending Dr. Jordan for the same stand that once brought down
upon his head censure from the national order.
An interesting paradox.
The Palo Alto chapter, it is pointed out, had no hand in that ridiculous
move of months ago. For that the local descendants of those patriots of
'76 are to be congratulated. In the resolution Dr. Jordan is referred to
as "a prophet and pioneer in this movement (peace) even at the cost of
personal sacrifice and misunderstanding." For the remarkable insight
reflected by that statement the local D.A.R. ladies are to be congratulated
also.
The Daily wonders, however, why these admirable convictions were
not expressed at a more opportune time—say just after Dr. Jordan's name
was placed upon the blacklist.
