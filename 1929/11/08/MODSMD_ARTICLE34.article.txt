# A 						COMEDY OF MANNERS

### 
The characters of this delightful little scenc are a forlorn and deserted
Stanford co-ed and a brand new five-dollar bill. The time is Big Game
night and the setting is almost any dark country road. And that's really
all there is to it. She just stands there, she and her five-dollar bill; and
the Women's Council of Stanford University beatifically believes that it
has helped the feminine population out of a distressing difficulty.
The reason why she is standing in the road might be any one of a
legion, but the presence of the money can be traced to the Stanford council,
which suggested that every woman going out that night should take along
that much "mad money."
But the girl is still standing there. She might just as well not have
any money: trains do not run through Wildcat Canyon; and she might
just as well try to telephone from the summit of Mt. Tallac„
When the members of our Women's Executive Committee—confident
that their decrees would be observed—issued the now famous Outline of
Decorum, we were seized with an acute feeling of inferiority. We feared
that other universities were chuckling. But relief came with the announce
ment of the Stanford council—we realized that embarrassment is never
solitary.
And, after all, even if the plans won't work, both Stanford's group
and ours knew what the situations would be.—Daily Californian.
