THE FIDDLER, by Sarah Gertrude
Millin, Horace Liveright & Co.
New York, 1929.
It is said that Sarah Gertrude Millin
is an author who appeals only to the
few. It is to a few indeed that her
latest book, "The Fiddler," will ap
peal. First of all it is uninteresting;
and secondly it offers nothing new in
either content or style.
The plot is laid in Portuguese West
Africa, and this is the only redeeming
feature of the book. Miss Millin knows
Africa well and succeeds in giving a
realistic picture of the country to
those unfamiliar with it. However, the
descriptive parts are too scarce and
too much space has been devoted to
the main characters' lengthy thought
processes.
The plot in itself is extremely trite.
It has to do with an apparently con
tented wife falling in love with an
other man. Although she still loves
her husband, she runs away with this
man. An account of the pair's misfor
tunes follows. In the end the long
suffering husband takes back his wife,
and it is to be hoped that they live
happily ever after.
The characters are all unconvinc
ing and rather unreal. The wife, Jen
nie, is a strange creature who never
is sure whether she loves or whom
she loves. Her husband is rather in
significant. The lover is another queer
being; he has a wife and three chil
dren in England, no money, and does
not know whether he loves Jennie or

not. Nevertheless, he runs away with
her!
Miss Millin's style Is easy and
fluent, but in itself it is not remark
able enough to justify the writing of
such a book. Too many such sordid
and unpleasant books are being writ
ten today, and they become especially
tiresome when they lack originality.

SPEEDWAY, at the New Stanford.
It is amazing that the producers of
"Speedway" should have had the in
genuity to pack into one picture prac
tically all the time-honored hokum
and type cinema characterizations
which have been produced by the mas
ter minds of Hollywood in the last
twenty years.
Nothing is omitted. There is both a
parachute jump and an automobile
race. The hero is cheered on by a
mother with tears in her eyes. The
villain is a Frenchman with a slight
moustache. An ecstatic kiss is in pro
gress as the final scene fades out.
The race is, perhaps, the worst of
the production. After about forty
laps, interspersed with flashes of the
heroine and other excited spectators,
one is left with boredom and dizzi
ness.
If one can refuse to be enraged by
its inanities, however, the picture is
not bad entertainment. Few motion
picture actresses are more delightful
to gaze upon than is Anita Page;
while frequent witty repartee upon
the part of Haines is very amusing.
