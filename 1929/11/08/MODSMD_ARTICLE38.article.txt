# CARDINAL, U.C. SOCCER SERIES TO COMMENCE TOMORROW AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Slight favorites to win, Stanford's
varsity soccer eleven will clash with
the University of California team in
the first contest of the annual three
game series tomorrow afternoon at
1:30 on the Cardinal field.
The Redshirts have ten letter men
from last year's team which copped
two out of the three games from the
Bears in the 1928 series as well as
many new men who have added con
siderable reserve strength to the ag
gregation. In every department of the
game Stanford's shin-bruisers have
shown up better than the 1928 team,
the work of the forwards especially
showing decided improvement.
Coach Harry Maloney has been try
ing out a new combination in the line
during the past week and it has
worked well in the scrimmages with
the second team. He has shifted Eber
hard from the left wing position to
the right inside. This gives the flashy
forward a chance to work with Mujica,
speedy left wing. The pair work very
smoothly together and will prove a
real menace for the Cal backs.
The complete starting line-up will
be as follows: forwards, Mujica, Eber
hard, Vallenga, Nichols, and Miller;
halfbacks, Captain Mayer, Christen
sen, and Reynolds; fullbacks, Wit
tausch and Burns or Dalton; goal,
Williams.
