"Tell the students at Stanford that
I am getting along very well," said
Dr. Jordan yesterday, firm-voiced and
cheerful, in a short interview ac
corded a reporter of the Daily.
At present Dr. Jordan is much in
terested in Claude C. Bower's latest
book, "The Tragic Era," which he
and Mrs. Jordan are reading together.
"It is a good, unbiased book," declared
Dr. Jordan. The Chancellor Emeritus
spends several pleasant hours each
day over this book, lying back in a
big armchair in the quiet living-room
of his home.
Every morning that the weather
permits, Dr. Jordan enjoys a visit to
his garden. His attendant verified his
statement concerning his health, and
added that his general condition was
gradually but consistently improving.
