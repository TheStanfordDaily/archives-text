# "UP TO UNIVERSITY TO ENFORCE PLANE RULE," AVERS AIRPORT HEAD
## 
### 
"The enforcement of the proclama
tion that the Palo Alto Flying Field
will be closed on the days of the
Stanford-California and Stanford-
Army football games, is entirely up to
the University" stated Mrs. Norman
A. Goddard, of the Palo Alto School
of Aviation, when questioned on the
matter.
The nearest Airport to the Stadium
besides the local one being Mills Field
in San Francisco, it is highly unlikely,
in Mrs. Goddard's opinion, that air
planes will be used by football fans
as a means of transportation because
of the long drive down from the city.
However, nothing definite can be
stated in regard to this until the
various air-transportation companies
have received the letters notifying
them of the field's closing.
