# SODDEN GRID LOOMS AS CARDINALS FACE HUSKIES IN SEATTLE
## Muller's Back May Prevent His Playing; Neill May Fill in Right End 
### 
In a game that will either make or
break the Cardinals for the remainder
of the 1929 football season, Coach Pop
Warner will lead his big varsity
against an equally big Washington
team tomorrow afternoon in the rain
swept Seattle stadium. With pouring
weather predicted to greet the two
squads when they trot out on the field,
the Cards will have to be at their best
to down the battered yet fighting
Huskies.
A win tomorrow will give the Red
shirts a chance to tie for the Pacific
Coast championship, and at the same
time will put them back in the stride
to tangle with the Golden Bears No
vember 23. A setback at the hands
of the Huskies will completely elimi
nate Pop's lads from the title race.
Lineup Not Definite
Coach Warner is having as hard a
time deciding to start against Wash
ington as he did in the Trojan game
two weeks ago. In fact, the opening
lineup will not be announced until a
few minutes before the Cards line up
for the kick-off.
It is quite probable that Captain
Mush Muller will not start the con
test, and there is a chance that he
will not see action at all, as his
bruised back is still bothering him. If
Muller remains on the sidelines, it is
more than likely that Phil Neill will
fill in at right end. Neill has been
showing up well all year, and his in
jection into the lineup will not ma
terially weaken the Stanford team.
Johnny Preston is a cinch to be in his
old place at left wing, though he is
not in the best of condition.
Fleishhacker Benched
However, Muller's absence will be
a blow to Pop's passing attack, espe
cially since Bill Simkins, the best
ball-tosser on the squad, did not even
make the Northern trip. With Sim
kins lost to the team, it is expected
that Harlow Rothert will bear the
brunt of the Card attack, as he is the
best punter and next best passer on
the varsity, besides being a consistent
ground-gainer.
Herb Fleishhacker may also be
benched tomorrow because of an in
fected knee, his place at quarter being
taken by Harry Hillman, who has
proved himself to be a ootent line
smasher. The loss of Fleishhacker
would greatly weaken the Cardinal's
defense, on the other hand, as with
out doubt he is the outstanding line
backer on the Coast this season. The
rest of the starting team will undoubt
edly be the same as opened up against
U.S.C.
