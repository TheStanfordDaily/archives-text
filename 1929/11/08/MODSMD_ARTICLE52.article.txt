# Stanford Band Recordings Pay For Addition To House
## 
### 
Work on the new addition to the
Stanford band house has just been
completed, and is now ready for use
by the band. By adding ten feet to
the eastern side of the house the floor
has been increased 500 square feet.
Costs of this enlargement were en
tirely paid by the band itself from
earnings made last year through the
sale of phonograph records, and from
off-campus engagements.
