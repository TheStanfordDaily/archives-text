# Williams Seeking Lyrics, Music For Gaieties Skits
## 
### 
There are openings for campus
song-writers in the Football Gaieties,
announces "Griff" Williams, musical
director. Several skits and acts will
be complete only when more lyrics
and music for tap-dancing have been
turned in. Students wishing to submit
songs or dance music should get in
touch with Williams immediately as
rehearsals are now under way.
