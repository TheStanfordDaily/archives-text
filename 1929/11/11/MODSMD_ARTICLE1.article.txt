# MALONEY SEEKS A.A.U. APPROVAL OF KRENZ'S TOSS
## Card Weight Man's Gigantic Heave of Last March May Be Officially Sanctioned Will Make Attempt to Bring National Championships to San Francisco in 1930 
### 
Prospects of Stanford possessing
another world's track and field honor
loom brighter today following the an
nouncement that Coach Harry Malo
ney will leave tomorrow for the St.
Louis convention of the Amateur Ath
letic Union, where he will support
Eric Krenz' record-breaking discus
throw of 163 feet 8% inches, made at
the Olympic Club meet last March.
Maloney, who is third vice-president
of the A.A.U., is confident that the
record will receive the official sanc
tion of the Union. He is also a mem
ber of the Executive Committee and
the American Foreign Relations Com
mittee.
The matter of the record will be
brought up first before the Executive
Committee on Records. If this body
approves, Krenz' toss becomes a na
tional record. The American Foreign
Relations Committee then automati
cally refers the matter to the Inter
iational Committee on Records which
must pass on its validity before it can
be recognized as a world's record.
The International Committee meets
at Berlin in January, 1930.
Maloney said yesterday that if the
American Committee on Records ac
cepts the throw as official there is
little possibility of the foreign com
mittee disapproving of it as a world's
record.
Maloney, together with other North
ern California delegates, may also
make bid to have the 1930 national
track and field championships meet
held in San Francisqo. Los Angeles,
where the meet was originally to be
held, has been forced to give up the
meet due to alterations being made
at the Coliseum for the 1932 Olympic
Games.
