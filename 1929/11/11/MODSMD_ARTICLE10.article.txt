"Tell the lads down at Stanford
; that the way to be happy is to forget
trouble. Plow life's furrow wi' a song
j an' if ye can't sing out, sing in," de
clared Sir Harry Lauder in an inter
view after his final performance at
the Curran Theatre in San Francisco
Saturday night.
" 'Tis a hard life if ye won't make
it happy. Sing. I hae been doing it
for fifty years.
"An* as for retirin'? Lad, that's nae
way to be happy. Keep richt on singin'
tae the end o' the road. This is my
sixth farewell tour. I'll be back. Lord
bless us, I will nae be a hundred for
forty-one years!
Do Well in Dark
"Love in the gloamin'. It's the start
of the beginnin',â€”the maist glorious
thing in the warl'. 'Roamin' in the
gloamin' wi' my sweetie by my side!'
i Ye kinna ken wha* the gloamin' is.
I Ye do nae hae it in this country.
; However, ye American lads and
i lassies do very weil in the dark."
The bonny Scotsman has been on
; the stage forty-seven years and has
' made twenty triumphal tours of

I America. During that time he has
I risen from a lowly coal miner to
I knight of the British Empire and one
lof the most-loved persons in the
j world.
Works in Mine
During his boyhood he pushed a
i cart in the coal mines of his native
j Scotland and dreamed of being a
great singer. He entered village
j church contests, sang in home talent
j shows, and entertained the miners
| Avho, although they liked his singing,
; advised him against going on the
I stage.
So he stayed in the mine but con
tinued to dream his great dream. He
j ran away with road shows once or
I twice only to come back to the mines
| penniless. He married a girl who
| turned Out to be the best manager
he ever had. Lady Lauder died a
year and a half ago. His son was
killed in the world war.
Starts Stage Career
Supported by his wife he finally
i broke away from the mines and cast
his lot definitely with the stage. At
last he was permitted to appear in
' London. Since that day there has been
I a Scotch burr in the world's heart.
"You're looking well," he says to
j his audience. "Feeling well? You must
be doing well or you wouldn't be
j here."
The balconies appreciate the com
i pliment. They are a distinct part of
j a Lauder appearance. One can not
' help but imagine that Charles and
: Mary Lamb are somewhere up there,
| laughing, crying a little, perhaps,
i There are others so unsophisticated.
"When I come upon the stage, I
I imagine that every individual in the
audience is my personal friend, a dear
old crony of mine."
David Warfield called Sir Harry
"the greatest character delineator on
i the stage." He is more than that,
j Audiences do not sing for mere char-
I acter delineators. They do for him!
