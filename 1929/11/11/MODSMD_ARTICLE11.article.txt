# CARDINALS HELD TO 6-0 SCORE IN NORTHERN GAME
## Smalling Crashes Over for Only Touchdown When Cards Get "Break" 
### Associated Press 
Seventeen thousand Northwest foot
ball fans carried umbrellas to the
Washington stadium last Saturday to
see Stanford whip the Huskies, and
seventeen thousand Northwest foot
ball fans went home after the mud
fight thinking Bagshaw and his Pur
ple and Gold machine weren't so bad
after all. For fifty-six long minutes,
Washington out-fought and outplayed
the Redshirts and if it had not been
for the one Stanford offensive drive
during the first four minutes of play
which ended when Smalling dove over
the line to make the score 6-0, the
game would have ended in a score
less tie.
Breaks Against Huskies
Breaks were against the Huskies or
there would have been a couple of
Washington scores in the last half.
Once a Husky linesman picked up a
loose ball and ran over the line, but
the ball was brought back. Twice the
Purple and Gold fumbled after work
ing the ball to within scoring dis
tance, twice they lost the ball on
downs when in the shadow of the
Stanford goal-posts, and twice threw
incomplete passes over the Cardinals'
goal line. Fleishhacker's defensive
work was probably the only reason
why Bagshaw's men didn't score on
their last drive in the fourth quarter.
Stanford's score came on a break
shortly after the game started. A
Washington punt from their 11-yard
line went short and was grounded on
the 14-yard line. Rothert made nine
yards on a reverse, and Fleishhacker
added one more. Smalling then took
the ball on two successive plays and
on the last try went over for the
Cards' lone touchdown. Jessup blocked
Rotliert's try for the extra point.
Anybody's Game
After that early Stanford drive, It
looked like the Huskies were In for
another bad beating, but it turned out
to be anybody's game and the Red
Machine was fortunate in eking out a
victory.
A muddy field greatly slowed up the
game and the referee frequently had
to call time out to wipe the mud off
the pigskin. The water-soaked ball
also prevented the teams from trying
an aerial game, and the punts from
traveling any great distance.
Hufford Plays Well
Hufford of Washington was the best
backfield man on the field, while
Fleishhacker's defensive play late in
the game was the best work turned in
by any of the Cardinals.
Coach Enoch Bagshaw has risen in
the esteem of many football followers
as a result of the game. The Husky
coach has resigned his post and Sat
urday's game was his last on home
grounds. It was the fourth Conference
game that Washington has lost this
year, but by far the best that the
Northwest team has played. Coach
"Pop" Warner ably summed up the
game in his statement, "We were
lucy to win."

incomplete passes over the Cardinals'
goal line. Fleishhacker's defensive
work was probably the only reason
why Bagshaw's men didn't score on
their last drive in the fourth quarter.
Stanford's score came on a break
shortly after the game started. A
Washington punt from their 11-yard
line went short and was grounded on
the 14-yard line. Rothert made nine
yards on a reverse, and Fleishhacker
added one more. Smalling then took
the ball on two successive plays and
on the last try went over for the
Cards' lone touchdown. Jessup blocked
Rotliert's try for the extra point.
Anybody's Game
After that early Stanford drive, It
looked like the Huskies were In for
another bad beating, but it turned out
to be anybody's game and the Red
Machine was fortunate in eking out a
victory.
A muddy field greatly slowed up the
game and the referee frequently had
to call time out to wipe the mud off
the pigskin. The water-soaked ball
also prevented the teams from trying
an aerial game, and the punts from
traveling any great distance.
Hufford Plays Well
Hufford of Washington was the best
backfield man on the field, while
Fleishhacker's defensive play late in
the game was the best work turned in
by any of the Cardinals.
Coach Enoch Bagshaw has risen in
the esteem of many football followers
as a result of the game. The Husky
coach has resigned his post and Sat
urday's game was his last on home
grounds. It was the fourth Conference
game that Washington has lost this
year, but by far the best that the
Northwest team has played. Coach
"Pop" Warner ably summed up the
game in his statement, "We were
lucy to win."
Seventeen thousand Northwest foot
ball fans carried umbrellas to the
Washington stadium last Saturday to
see Stanford whip the Huskies, and
seventeen thousand Northwest foot
ball fans went home after the mud
fight thinking Bagshaw and his Pur
ple and Gold machine weren't so bad
after all. For fifty-six long minutes,
Washington out-fought and outplayed
the Redshirts and if it had not been
for the one Stanford offensive drive
during the first four minutes of play
which ended when Smalling dove over
the line to make the score 6-0, the
game would have ended in a score
less tie.
Breaks Against Huskies
Breaks were against the Huskies or
there would have been a couple of
Washington scores in the last half.
Once a Husky linesman picked up a
loose ball and ran over the line, but
the ball was brought back. Twice the
Purple and Gold fumbled after work
ing the ball to within scoring dis
tance, twice they lost the ball on
downs when in the shadow of the
Stanford goal-posts, and twice threw
incomplete passes over the Cardinals'
goal line. Fleishhacker's defensive
work was probably the only reason
why Bagshaw's men didn't score on
