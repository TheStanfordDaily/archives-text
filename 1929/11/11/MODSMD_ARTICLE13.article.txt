### The Associated Press 
The West Coast Limited, Southern
Pacific passenger train running be
tween Portland and Los Angeles, was
wrecked two miles west of Saugus
late last night by robbers who entered
four coaches and held up the passen
gers.
The wreck was caused by a rail
loosened or removed. Engineer Ball
was the only person hurt, and he was
believed to be fatally scalded.
The long passenger train jarred to
an abrupt stop, according to those on
board, and several men ran out of the
dark and entered the coaches. They
held up every one in the cars, lining
them up at the points of guns.
H. Pierson, district passenger agent
of the railway company, was one of
the victims. The amount of loot ob
tained could not be ascertained be
cause of the confusion among the
passengers.
Posses were organized immediately
for the search by county and railroad
officials. Passengers were confused as
to the number in the band, but were
agreed that the robbery was well
planned by desperate men.
