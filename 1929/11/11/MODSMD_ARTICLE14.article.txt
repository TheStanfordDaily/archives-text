# Four Day Red Cross Drive On Campus To Start This Morning
## 
### 
The annual National Red Cross
Drive will start on the campus today
and will continue for a period of four
days. An effort will be made to en
roll the entire campus in the organi
sation for a membership fee of one
dollar each. An intensive drive will
be carried on in the fraternities and
halls under committees headed by
George Bodle and Sarah Grant. Money
received by committeemen may be
turned into Bodle in the A.S.S.U. of
fice from 1 to 2 o'clock Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday afternoons.
"Am sending you check for the six
memberships for family and servants
and wish you all success in your
drive" â€”a telegram sent by Lou Henry
Hoover to Dr. Harry Reynolds, head of
the Palo Alto chapter. Herbert Hoover
is the official President of the Nation
al Red Cross Association, which is an
organization chartered by Congress
and supported by the people.
"The greater participation of the
students in the drive this year is sure
to greatly increase last year's $500
total," stated Professor Emeritus Jef
ferson Elmore who is general over
seer of the drive on the campus this
year.
During the past forty-eight years
the Red Cross has been continuously
engaged in providing relief for victims
of disaster not only in this country,
but in all nations. These services rest
upon a nation-wide membership which
provides moral and financial support.
Half of the membership fee is for
local work, and half for national and
international work.
