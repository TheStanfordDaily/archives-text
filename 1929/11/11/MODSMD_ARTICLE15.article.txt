# Lunch Hour Song Sessions Planned For Living Groups
## 
### 
Four quartets of Glee Club singers
will start at noon today making the
round of living groups on the campus,
according to Del Culling, club presi
dent.
The Stanford Rally Committee,
headed by Chuck Fox, has arranged
to have the singers, accompanied by
one of the yell leaders, visit each
group sometime before the Big Game.
These quartets will lead a half hour's
program of Stanford songs at each
living group immediately after lunch.
"Learning of the hymn is most im
portant, but we want everyone also to
learn the words of 'The Cardinal Is
Waving,' 'Hail Alma Mater,' 'Sons of
the Stanford Red,' and "Stanford For
ever,' " state# Chuck Fox.
"Son of a Gambolier" which has not
been used as a rooting section song
since 1925, when Ernie Nevers was
captain, will be revived for this year's
Big Game. The two verses which will
be used will be printed in tomorrow's
Daily.
Head Yell Leader Paul Speegle says
that the purpose of this singing prac
tice is to familiarize everyone with
the Stanford songs and the proper
way to sing them, so that singing in
(he bleachers at the Big Game will
be more effective than at previous
games.
