# TICKETS FOR FRENCH PICTURE GO ON SALE TODAY AT 1 O'CLOCK
## 
### 
Suppressed in England, the French
film, "The Passion of Joan of Arc,"
will be shown in the Assembly Hall
Thursday evening. Tickets for the
performance will go on sale this af
ternoon at one o'clock in front of the
Women's Clubhouse.
The picture has been brought from
New York for presentations in North
ern California by the Cinema Society
of California, through which it has
been shown at special performances
in Berkeley and San Francisco. "The
Passion of Joan of Arc," which was
judged by the National Board of Re
view to be one of the four best films
ever made, will not be shown in any
commercial theater in the West and
will not be seen here again.
Directed by Carl Dreyer of the So
ci6t6 G6n6rale des Films and played
by Mile. Maria Falconetti, a member
of the Com£die Francaise, this film is
one of the few French pictures to
have made its way to this country.
A movie technique which is complete
ly different from any used in the Hol
lywood studios will be seen in "The
Passion of Joan of Arc." Dealing with
the last six hours of the maid's life,
this film is made up almost entirely
of close-up shots of Mile. Falconetti's
facial expressions. M. Sylvain, also
a member of the Com&lie, has the
only other important part in the pic
ture —that of the Bishop of Beauvais,
head of the ecclesiastical court which
tries and condemns Joan.
Tickets for Thursday's presentation
will cost seventy-five cents, all seats
being reserved, and may be secured
at Sherman, Clay and Company in
Palo Alto as well as in front of the
Union at one o'clock.
