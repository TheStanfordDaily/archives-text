# CALIFORNIA YEARLINGS SCORE TOUCHDOWN ON BREAK TO WIN FROSH GRIDIRON CLASSIC 6-0
## Bad Pass From Center and Rushed Punt Gives Break to Cubs For Lone Touchdown; Fumbling and Slow Playing Mars Game; Targhetta Stars for Cards 
### DON OSWILL 
A FAST-CHARGING California freshman football team, aided by the big
break of the game, a bad pass by a substitute Stanford center, defeated
the Card yearlings here Saturday by a score of 6 to 0. Outside the one
powerful offensive drive shown by the Bears early in the second quarter, the
game was very listless, both teams playing ragged football and making
numerous fumbles.
To start the second period, Stanford took the ball on its own twenty-one
yard line. The first play, Afflerbaugli made sixteen yards around right end.
On the next try, a would-be delayed buck with the back receiving the ball
standing far behind the line of scrimmage, John Card, Stanford center,
<$> <$>passed the ball far over Afflerbaugh'a

head to the Cardinal five-yard mark
where it was downed by Rogers.
Fritchie Goes Over
The California line rushed Stavens,
Card full, as he punted and the pig
skin went out of bounds on the Stan
ford fourteen-yard mark. From that
point, Castro and Fritchie, alternating
for the Bears, carried the ball to
Stanford's one-yard line. Fritchie car
ried it over on the next play for the
single touchdown of the day. Valianos
failed to convert.
Let it be said for John Card, that
outside his one bad pass from center,
he played very good football. His de
fensive work was notably strong, and
the U.C. backfield men made very few
yards over center position. It was just
one of those breaks of the game, and
California made the most of it.
The Stanford football team, as a
whole, failed to function as well
against the Bear Cubs as they have
against other teams played this sea
son. Afflerbaugh made some nice runs,
but fumbled altogether too mucn. On
reverse plays attempted, the Card
backfield functioned slowly, and many
times the Bear linemen broke through
to spill them for a loss.
The biggest offensive threat shown
by the Redshirts all day was stopped
in midfield by the Bears. In the third
quarter Stanford took the ball on its
own twenty-yard line, from where
Afflerbaugh and Stevens carried it
to California's forty-yard mark. The
Bear line held there, and during the
rest of the contest, the ball was kept
around the center of the gridiron.
The brilliant defensive playing of
Paul Targhetta, redheaded Card quar
terback, was the bright light of the
game. Targhetta was in nearly every
play that the Bears tried through the
Stanford line, as well as intercepting
two forward passes.
Castro and Fritichie, full and half
back respectively, were the best in
the Bear backfield. The former did
most of the ball-carrying, and was the
only Californian to make many yards
through the Redshirt line. The tourth
Gill, of the football-playing family,
turned in a nice game at end for the
Bears.
