# PEACE
## 
### 
Eleven years ago today a white page was turned at last in the dirty,
blood-soaked volume which records the history of mankind. A tired,
desperate world awoke to new hope. Peace had come, ending the most
horrid tragedy ever visited upon the nations.
Peace came too late, however, to save those thousands upon thousands
of youths who cheerfully and blindly died for a cause —dietl in a conflict
which was styled as a war to end war.
Eleven years have passed since that day when giant guns ceased
belching death over Flanders fields; when men ceased hunting other men
like beasts; when mechanical birds of prey quit dropping death on
women and children.
The period of eleven years is short as time goes, but it is long
enough for memory's pictures to become indistinct. The sharp-cut lines
of that somber etching—war —have been dimmed by years of peace.
Soon they will be obliterated entirely, and when they are —when men
have forgotten the stark horror of strife —then will the stage be set
for militaristic and diplomatic maneuvers that will once again throw
humans at the throats of other humans.
Look for a moment into the eyes of a gold star mother. Look at the
misshapen hulks that would have been men. \ hink of the thousands
buried in European meadows. Those things brook no argument.
But with the passing of every year such object lessons become less
real. Soon they will be gone entirely. The university men and women
of today will live to see a time when there will be no gold star mothers
and no more tottering wrecks of men to revive that horrible memory.
In the universities today is cannon fodder. Tomorrow on every
campus will be tomorrow's cannon fodder. Only by keeping that memory
alive will the youth of today and tomorrow save itself from the fate of
the youth of 1914 and 1917.
