# YOUR SERVICE TO HUMANITY

Give till it hurts!
That was the slogan of the Red Cross during the World War when
it was doing meritorious work to alleviate the suffering of all nations.
Today the American National Red Cross is again asking that we
give. But the amount is a small one in proportion to the service which
it renders in time of emergency. The Red Cross is a permanent organiza
tion chartered by Congress and supported by voluntary contributions of
the people. The charter makes it obligatory for the Red Cross to perform
certain duties, which it has never failed to do.
The record of the organization in mitigating the painful condition
of stricken areas in great national and international calamites such as
floods, earthquakes, and tornados is a monument to the genuine service
which it renders.
The Red Cross is a practical form of national accident insurance on
a large scale.
For the first time this year the official support of the Associated
Students has been recruited to conduct the drive for membership to this
charity, which is the only one besides the Convalescent Home to which
Stanford subscribes.
