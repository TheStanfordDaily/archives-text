# ANOTHER WORLD'S RECORD FOR STANFORD
## 
### 
Ilarry Maloney leaves tomorrow for St. Louis to attend the annual
meeting of the Amateur Athletic Union, the king-pin of all American
athletic affairs.
It is significant that Coach Maloney is leaving his pressing duties to
attend the conclave, not only as the Union's third vice-president but as
Stanford's ambassador when the subject of Eric Krenz's discus throw
comes up for official sanction as a world's record. There is much red
tape before a mark can be declared the best in the world and the presence
ing veteran sportsman of the Pacific Coast, will aid materially in further
of a Stanford representative, known for his integrity and as the outstand
ing Stanford's and Krenz's claim to greatness.
It is practically assured that the record will receive the official sanc
tion of the A.A.U. and it is then mere formality to have it established as
a world's mark.
The Daily's best wishes go with Coach Maloney and it hopes to be
the first to congratulate Eric Krenz as the official holder of a world's
record.
