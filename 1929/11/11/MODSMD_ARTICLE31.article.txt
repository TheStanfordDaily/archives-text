THE BIOGRAPHY OF H. R. H. THE
PRINCE OF WALES, by W. and
L. Townsend. The Macmillan
Company, New York, 1929.
Conventional, stereotyped, biased,
and pedantic, this biography of the
Prince of Wales is extremely disap
pointing from the standpoint of both
style and content.
Beginning with the usual scene just
preceding the birth of the Prince —
pacing father, and all of that rot —
this book abounds in ordinary phrases,
anecdotes, and moralizations. The
Prince, of course, gains "a broader
outlook on life" as he grows up; and
the authors patronizingly announce to
their dear reader: "Step by step in
the following chapters you will be
able to trace his career and watch
the gradual development of the char
acter of the young man who shoulders
greater responsibility today than any
other Royal Prince. The life story of
His Royal Highness Edward Prince
of Wales is, in fact, a perfect object
lesson in the making of a future
King."
Continually and irritatingly, it is
being pointed out that the Prince is
a human being, in spite of the fine
royal qualities he possesses. One is
not allowed to forget that "his popu
larity—even if it be world-wide—will
never spoil the nature of the Prince
of Wales. He is too conscientious for
that. Rather will it be a spur to send
him forward to do bigger and befter
things, if that is possible, gratified
in the knowledge that he has the
confidence of the people behind him."
And of course as he grows up, the
biography devotes itself to asinine
information concerning the Prince's
wardrobe, his tastes in fashions, his
excellence as a dancer, and his vari
ous rumored engagements. Naturally,
one could not expect a biography of
His Royal Highness the Prince of
Wales to omit such essential and en
lightening details; but when one is
told of his devotion to the fluffy white
poodle by some such name as "Nora,"
one is a little exasperated.
Irritating also, is the thoroughly
British way in which the self-satisfied
authors speak of the royal blood, tra
dition, the empire, and British educa
tion.
And, incidental to "British educa
tion" —glaring grammatical blunders
are not infrequent in this book. To
wit, we were shocked on the third
page by this: "the birth of he"!
Perhaps the utter conventionality

and ordinariness of this biography
and the complete inferiority of the
style and manner of presentation may
he duo to the fact that the Prince is
still alive. (We hope better biogra
phies of a man we once admired will
come out eventually.) At any rate, it
is thoroughly unworthy of the subject.

THE SATURDAY NIGHT KID, New
Stanford Theatre.
Clara Bow again, swaggering,
slangy, and sweet. The"it" girl seems
to have gained a few pounds, but she
still wears cute little block shop-girl
dresses better than anyone else on
the screen.
In "The Saturday Night Kid" Clara
Bow is playing a part to which she is
really suited —that of a pert, ordinary
little clerk in the Ginsberg Depart
ment store; and she is so human in
it most of the time that even the very
silly scenes have a certain appeal.
The picture show itself certainly
won't tax anybody's brain. Even ar
dent Clara Bow fans —who of course
aren't expecting any mental uplift—
will have to admit that there isn't
any plot worth speaking about. Clara
as "Mayme," has a selfish young sis
ter, played by Jean Arthur, who tries
to take Mayme's sweetheart away
from her. Bhe almost sucseeds, too, for
the young man (James Hall) is not
very smart and falls for the "you
poor, big boy" line. But Mayme gets
down and fights for her man, and
wins him just in time for the fade-out.
The "fight" scene is thebest —it
should have been longer.

LELAND STANFORD GAME EXPE
DITION at California Theatre,
Mayfield.
Announced and advertised as "The
Leland Stanford Game Expedition," a
silent movie entitled "The Wild Heart
of Africa" opens today at the Cali
fornia Theatre in Mayfield. This
movie is the chronicle of a 2000-mile
trip across the heart of Africa which
was made by "Cub" and Ken Walker,
both Stanford graduates, two years
ago. As has been said in this column
before, if the movie shows half the
thrilling episodes related by the
Walkers on their return, the show
cannot help but be exciting. Fletcher
Walker was killed about three months
ago in an airplane accident in North
ern California; his brother was seri
i ously injured, but is recovering.
