# RAM'S HEAD SOCIETY ANNOUNCES SEVERAL GAIETIES SKIT CASTS
## 
### 
Although the character of most of
the skits being rehearsed for the Big
Game Gaieties has been withheld, the
casts for several of them have been
released by Ram's Head.
Annie Lou Carmichael, who danced
in last year's football show, will ap
pear again this year in Harold Hel
venston'B specialty act; and Fred
Pearman, new to the Stanford stage,
will be seen in this surprise with
her. Cast in one of several satires of
local interest will be: Stanley Mullin,
Paul Speegle, Katherine Keho, and
Irving Rosenblatt, all of whom have
appeared in campus productions in
the past.
Those who remember the outstand
ing solo skit of last year's gaieties,
"The Mauve Moth," may look for
ward with interest in the 1929 show,
for a skit in many ways similar to
that one has been written for this
year. Among the campus satires to
be included in the gaieties is one on
dramatics, written by Paul Speegle
and Stan Mullin.
Further announcements of the casts
for other acts will be made in the
Daily this week.
