# GREYS TRAMPLE BEAR RESERVES IN ANNUAL GAME SATURDAY. 39-2
## Powerful Stanford Offense Scores at Will; Colvin And Lambert Star 
### 
Scoring a field goal before their op
ponents could get warmed up, the
Stanford Greys swamped the Califor
nia Reserves under a string of field
goals and touchdowns during the first
half to win by a 39 to 2 score in their
annual game Saturday at the Stadium.
The Greys scored all their points in
the first half.
The California Reserves were un
able to stop the Stanford attack,
which was so varied and well executed
that the few Stanford supporters in
the Stadium might well have ima
gined they were looking at the varsity
at its best. Behind a powerful, heavy
line, the Stanford backs were able to
work their reverses and toss their
passes without trouble. Baker and
Hardy did the passing, with Lambert,
Colvin, and Hand receiving. Two
thirty-yard passes, one from Baker to
Colvin and the other from Hardy to
Lambert, went for touchdowns. Ket
ron made the longest run of the day
on a lateral pass play, when he ran
fifty-five yards down the sidelines to
a score.
Running Good
Lambert starred in running plays,
shaking off tacklers and using a good
straight-arm. He was good for several
yards every try, and seldom failed to
get through the line of scrimmage.
Baker did his usual accurate passing,
and made many yards on plunges.
Hardy and Ketron were good at re
turning punts and kickoffs, and
Hardy's punts were high and long,
several of them going between forty
and fifty yards.
Colvin was outstanding in the line,
snagging passes and going down under
the punts. His hard tackling put the
Bears in a hole several times, making
them punt from near their own goal
line. The whole line put on the best
exhibition of tackling, blocking, and
interference running that has been
seen in the Stadium for some time.
Grey kicked a couple of field goals
and converted on three trys.
Cubs Score
California's two points came in the
third period as the result of the
Bears' only threat at a score, when
they made two successive first downs
after recovering a Stanford fumble
on the Stanford thirty-yard line. A
Stanford back intercepted a pass that
should have been batted down over
the goal line, and the ball went into
the Greys' possession on their own
one-yard line. Hardy's punt was
blocked and rolled back of the end
zone for a safety.
Zimmerman was outstanding for the
California Reserves, doing most of the
tackling, passing, and ball-carrying
for his team. Largely through his ef
forts, the game was pretty evenly
played through the second half, with
the Greys content to hold their lead
and use their substitutes.

and use their substitutes.
Scoring a field goal before their op
ponents could get warmed up, the
Stanford Greys swamped the Califor
nia Reserves under a string of field
goals and touchdowns during the first
half to win by a 39 to 2 score in their
annual game Saturday at the Stadium.
The Greys scored all their points in
the first half.
The California Reserves were un
able to stop the Stanford attack,
which was so varied and well executed
that the few Stanford supporters in
the Stadium might well have ima
gined they were looking at the varsity
at its best. Behind a powerful, heavy
line, the Stanford backs were able to
work their reverses and toss their
passes without trouble. Baker and
Hardy did the passing, with Lambert,
Colvin, and Hand receiving. Two
thirty-yard passes, one from Baker to
Colvin and the other from Hardy to
Lambert, went for touchdowns. Ket
ron made the longest run of the day
on a lateral pass play, when he ran
fifty-five yards down the sidelines to
a score.
Running Good
Lambert starred in running plays,
shaking off tacklers and using a good
straight-arm. He was good for several
yards every try, and seldom failed to
get through the line of scrimmage.
Baker did his usual accurate passing,
and made many yards on plunges.
Hardy and Ketron were good at re
turning punts and kickoffs, and
Hardy's punts were high and long,
several of them going between forty
and fifty yards.
Colvin was outstanding in the line,
snagging passes and going down under
the punts. His hard tackling put the
Bears in a hole several times, making
them punt from near their own goal
line. The whole line put on the best
exhibition of tackling, blocking, and
interference running that has been
seen in the Stadium for some time.
Grey kicked a couple of field goals
and converted on three trys.
Cubs Score
California's two points came in the
third period as the result of the
Bears' only threat at a score, when
they made two successive first downs
after recovering a Stanford fumble
on the Stanford thirty-yard line. A
Stanford back intercepted a pass that
should have been batted down over
the goal line, and the ball went into
the Greys' possession on their own
one-yard line. Hardy's punt was
blocked and rolled back of the end
zone for a safety.
Zimmerman was outstanding for the
California Reserves, doing most of the
tackling, passing, and ball-carrying
for his team. Largely through his ef
forts, the game was pretty evenly
played through the second half, with
the Greys content to hold their lead
and use their substitutes.
