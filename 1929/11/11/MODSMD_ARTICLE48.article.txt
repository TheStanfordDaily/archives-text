# CARD FENCERS BEAT U.C. SECOND TEAM IN RACE FOR HERON CUP
## 
### 
By defeating the California second
team 17 matches to 8 Friday night,
Stanford fencers eliminated one of
their three rivals for the coveted He
ron Cup. The fencing matches were
held at the Army and Navy Y.M.C.A.
in San Francisco, instead of at Har
mon Gym as was previously planned.
The Stanford team was composed
of Captain Jack Snyder, Joe Polve
rino, Fletcher Dutton, Tom Henry,
and Larry Higgins. Captain Snyder
won all five of his bouts, Dutton and
Polverino each won four out of five
matches, while Henry and Higgins
each contributed two to make the fi
nal score 17-8.
Next Friday the Stanford foilsmen
will meet the Olympic Club in what
will probably be the most important
match of the quarter.
The Club team won the Heron Cup
last year, and will be represented by
an experienced team this year. After
the Olympic Club matches, the fenc
ing squad will meet the California
first team in the final match of the
competition.
