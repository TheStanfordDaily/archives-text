# IS ALL WELL WITH WORLD? CARD DEBATERS OPTIMISTIC
## Six Speakers Make Final Preparations Today for Debate; Kimpton Is Newcomer to Stanford Platform 
### 
Six speakers will today make their
final preparations for tomorrow's de
bate between Oxford and Stanford
universities, on the question: "Re
solved, That this is the best of all
possible worlds." The debate will com
mence at 8 o'clock tomorrow evening,
in the Assembly Hall. Stanford will
defend the resolution.
The Cardinal team of Henry Harris,
Lawrence Kimpton, and Robert Mc-
Clintock will face Richard Acland,
William Diplock, and Bernard Mac-
Kenna of the visitors in this second
Stanford-Oxford debate.
The first contest with Oxford, in
1926, drew a capacity crowd in the
Assembly Hall, and presented more
wit and forensic excitement than any
other debate with a team from outside
the United States. Stanford debaters
have met teams from Cambridge,
Australia, and the Philippines.
Kimpton Is Newcomer
The fact that one of the Stanford
men, Lawrence Kimpton, is a junior
in the University, will add color to
tomorrow night's battle. This repre
sents unusual achievement on the
part of Kimpton, who is a relative

newcomer to the Stanford platform.
Last spring he debated against
U.C.L.A., California Tech, Occidental,
Loyola, and Pomona. Kimpton, whose
major subject is philosophy, hopes to
do work at Oxford University.
Henry Harris, second speaker on
the Stanford team, represented the
University in a Pacific Coast extem
poraneous contest and in the Joffre
debate against California last year.
He has been a member of teams meet
ing California, U.S.C., Oregon, Wash
ington, and Oregon State. Harris is a
senior majoring in economics.
McClintock Experienced
Robert McClintock, third Cardinal
speaker, placed second in the 1928
Joffre debate with California and has
been prominent in forensic activities
here. His opponents have included
California, California Tech, and U.S.C.
Last summer McClintock was one of
thirty American and European stu
dents chosen to study the operation
of the League of Nations in Geneva.
Admission to the debate will be 50
cents or by student body cards. Tick
ets are on sale at the A.S.S.U. office
and at Sherman, Clay & Co. in Palo
Alto.
