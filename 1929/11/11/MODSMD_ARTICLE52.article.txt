the Stanford Library. In appreciation
of the travel scholarships offered to
foreign students by American col
leges, the countries of the exchange
students have provided opportunities
for students of the United States or
its possessions to study abroad.

Italy, and Switzerland. Besides the
requirement of being a graduate of a
college or university at the time of
entering upon the fellowship, appli
cants will be judged on character, in
tellectual ability, personal qualities,
and health. Applications are to be in
