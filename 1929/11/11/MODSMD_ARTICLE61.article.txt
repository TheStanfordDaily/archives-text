# SKULLS AND BONES LITTER OFFICES OF FACULTY MEMBERS
## Amateur Archaeologists Dig Human Remains From Old Indian Mound 
### Ruth Ross 
Various members of the faculty
seem to litter up their offices with
human skulls and bones. Students re
ceive the impression that the relics
are those of aspirants to Ph.D.'s who
failed the oral examination, or, in the
case of the Physics department, those
who strayed too near the high voltage.
However, the human remains mean
only that several professors have an
inclination toward excavating.
When Santa Clara County was
made up of a few ranchos, there was
one, Senor Secondino Robles, a farm
er and warehouse keeper, who owned
eight hundred acres of land south of
Mayfleld, at what is now Castro. He
later sold the rancho, and most of it
now belongs to Mr. Arthur Pryor of
Palo Alto. Several years ago a group
of U.C. men made a survey, and found
that on the land was an ancient In
dian mound. Although their main ob
jective was to bring back to Berkeley
samples of the land to be analyzed
for fertilizer, they also took many
bones and implements.
The first Stanford man to do any
work at Castro is Professor Harold
Heath, of the Zoology department,
who has uncovered over a hundred
skeletons in the past few years. Sev
eral members of the Physics depart
ment have also spent long hours dig
ging through the dirt, which is 31 per
cent lime, in order to uncover a 'n
badly preserved natives of the St.
Clara Valley.
