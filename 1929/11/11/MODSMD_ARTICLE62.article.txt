# CARD SOCCER ELEVEN PLAYS SCORELESS TIE WITH GOLDEN BEARS
## 
### 
Displaying a heads-up brand of de
fensive soccer, the like of which has
not been seen here in many a day,
Stanford's varsity shin-bruisers and
the University of California eleven
scrapped their way through two forty
five minute halves of scoreless play
Saturday afternoon on the Cardinal
field in the first contest of the annual
three-game series.
The defensive work of the Redshirt
backs was practically perfect. Time
and time again, during the first half
especially, Captain Herb Mayer, Wit
tausch, and Burns completely smoth
ered a Bear offense that seemed sure
to score. The placement kicks by Wit
tauscli were the feature of the day,
the majority of them sailing consider
ably more than half the length of the
field.
The Card forwards failed to func
tion as they have in the previous
games this season and had difficulty
keeping possession of the ball when
it was in Blue and Gold territory.
Their best chance to score came early
in the second half when Mujica and
Eberhard worked the ball down the 1
field and passed to Nichols who
missed by inches a difficult try for
goal.
Smart, at inside left, turned in a
brilliant exhibition of shifty dribbling
for the Bears and the two Wholitz
brothers, Ed and Ernest, at right half
and left half, respectively, played fine j
defensive soccer.
