# HOOVER HONORS WAR HEROES AT SOLDIER'S TOMB
## President, Mrs. Hoover Take Part in Arlington Rites Honoring Nation's Dead Promises of International Peace Made by Speaker; Country Observes Day 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11. (/P)—The
nation's gratitude to its soldier and
sailor dead found expression again to
day at the plain marble slab that
marks the tomb of the Unknown Sol
dier at Arlington cemetery.
Led by the President and the First
Lady of the Land, several thousand
persons journeyed up the hill between
the rows of white markers to its grass
clad summit to join in homage at the
quiet resting place overlooking the
Potomac.
Peace Promised
The tribute their spokesmen offered,
leaving hundreds of flowers as an
earnest fulfilment, was a promise to
promote international peace — that
peace the soldier died to safeguard.
Hundreds of individuals, family
groups, veterans of other wars, and
children stood by while representa
tives of this and other governments,
survivors of the conflict, women who
served abroad or sent their sons to
war, and private citizens joined in
the ceremonies.
Gives Message
The climatic touch was provided to
night in exercises of the American
Legion, which President Hoover
chose for the enunciation to the world
of his Armistice Day message. The
audience of federal officials, diplo
mats, and World War veterans was
estimated to be 18,000 and arrange
ments made it possible for the Chief
Executive's address to be heard by
radio throughout the country.
Twelve thousand Legion posts had
been instructed to gather and listen
in, one of the speakers being 'heir
national commander, O. L. Boden
hamer.
They likewise heard a message from
their war-time chief, General John J.
Pershing, who cabled to Bodenhamer
from Paris a greeting to his comrades
of the World War.
