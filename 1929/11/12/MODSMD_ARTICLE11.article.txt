"There is nothing in this world
serious enough to break down over."
This is the conclusion that Ellery
Walter has reached after nine years

his experiences.

would not trade his education gained
through traveling for all the college
educations anywhere. Not that college
educations are not all right in their
place, but sometimes they do not go
far enough.

contacts that one makes in knocking
about the country.
"After all, life is more or less a
series of contacts with our fellowinen,
and traveling certainly has it all over
the college or university when it
comes to this. On the other side of
the question, the university gives one
a wider background of the classics, a
greater knowledge of art as related
