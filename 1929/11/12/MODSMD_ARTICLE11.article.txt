# TRAVEL BROADER EDUCATION THAN KNOWLEDGE GAINED IN COLLEGE, BELIEVES WALTER
## Lecturer Has Spent Nearly Whole Life in World Travel; Likes It

"There is nothing in this world
serious enough to break down over."
This is the conclusion that Ellery
Walter has reached after nine years
of traveling about the various places
of interest on this earth. He is only
twenty three, yet he has seen more
of the world than most of us will see
all our lives, and what is more import
ant, all of it has made an impression
on him.
"When you come right down to it,
there is plenty of the good with the
bad in this world and if one can learn
to laugh at both of them he is a long
ways ahead in this battle of life." And
Ellery Walter should certainly know
whereof he is talking for he has had
plenty of the best and the worst in
his experiences.
If he had to do it over again, he
would not trade his education gained
through traveling for all the college
educations anywhere. Not that college
educations are not all right in their
place, but sometimes they do not go
far enough.
Travel Better Than College
"It's this way. Traveling gives one
a wonderful familiarity with customs
and with people—in other words, un
derstanding of one's fellow men. Sec
ondly, there is the factual knowledge
of the world about us that comes to a
person with such astounding vivid
ness. And last and best of all are the
contacts that one makes in knocking
about the country.
"After all, life is more or less a
series of contacts with our fellowinen,
and traveling certainly has it all over
the college or university when it
comes to this. On the other side of
the question, the university gives one
a wider background of the classics, a
greater knowledge of art as related
to man, and a definite superiority in
pure science."
"Live Your Own Life"
According to Walter, it all depends
on what one is looking for in the fu
ture. If you want life in all its broad
aspects, then by all means travel; if
you want acquaintanceship with facts
and with the thing men call knowl
edge, then stay at home and study.
But above all live your own life and
do not follow the dictates of the multi
tude in its ideas of what you should
do.
Worked His Way
Walter worked his way at the Uni
versity of Washington for two years,
but like other people who have en
gaged in this business of getting an
education in the face of financial dis
tress, he does not think it worth
the fight. There have been too many
cases of ruined health and ruined
outlook on life to make one think it
worthwhile. "It sounds quite specta
cular and dramatic to say that some
person has worked his way through
school and on up through the ranks,
but wouldn't it have been just that
much better if that person had had a
little help as he went along," said
Walter.
When one meets Ellery Walter, he
seems almost too good to be true. He
is twenty-three now, and he has been
making his way since he was four
teen. And yet his outlook on life is
positively the most refreshing thing
imaginable. Walter lost part of one
leg as a result of septic poisoning,
and still he says he has had all the
breaks that life has had to offer.

When one thinks of this exceedingly
optimistic and enjoyable view of his
own life, one realizes that he really
meant what he said when he told us
that there was nothing in the world
worth breaking down over.

Travel Better Than College
"It's this way. Traveling gives one
a wonderful familiarity with customs
and with people—in other words, un
derstanding of one's fellow men. Sec
ondly, there is the factual knowledge
of the world about us that comes to a
person with such astounding vivid
ness. And last and best of all are the
contacts that one makes in knocking
about the country.
"After all, life is more or less a
series of contacts with our fellowinen,
and traveling certainly has it all over
the college or university when it
comes to this. On the other side of
the question, the university gives one
a wider background of the classics, a
greater knowledge of art as related
to man, and a definite superiority in
pure science."
"Live Your Own Life"
According to Walter, it all depends
on what one is looking for in the fu
ture. If you want life in all its broad
aspects, then by all means travel; if
you want acquaintanceship with facts
and with the thing men call knowl
edge, then stay at home and study.
But above all live your own life and
do not follow the dictates of the multi
tude in its ideas of what you should
do.
Worked His Way
Walter worked his way at the Uni
versity of Washington for two years,
but like other people who have en
gaged in this business of getting an
education in the face of financial dis
tress, he does not think it worth
the fight. There have been too many
cases of ruined health and ruined
outlook on life to make one think it
worthwhile. "It sounds quite specta
cular and dramatic to say that some
person has worked his way through
school and on up through the ranks,
but wouldn't it have been just that
much better if that person had had a
little help as he went along," said
Walter.
When one meets Ellery Walter, he
seems almost too good to be true. He
is twenty-three now, and he has been
making his way since he was four
teen. And yet his outlook on life is
positively the most refreshing thing
imaginable. Walter lost part of one
leg as a result of septic poisoning,
and still he says he has had all the
breaks that life has had to offer.

When one thinks of this exceedingly
optimistic and enjoyable view of his
own life, one realizes that he really
meant what he said when he told us
that there was nothing in the world
worth breaking down over.
"There is nothing in this world
serious enough to break down over."
This is the conclusion that Ellery
Walter has reached after nine years
of traveling about the various places
of interest on this earth. He is only
twenty three, yet he has seen more
of the world than most of us will see
all our lives, and what is more import
ant, all of it has made an impression
on him.
"When you come right down to it,
there is plenty of the good with the
bad in this world and if one can learn
to laugh at both of them he is a long
ways ahead in this battle of life." And
Ellery Walter should certainly know
whereof he is talking for he has had
plenty of the best and the worst in
his experiences.
If he had to do it over again, he
would not trade his education gained
through traveling for all the college
educations anywhere. Not that college
educations are not all right in their
place, but sometimes they do not go
far enough.
