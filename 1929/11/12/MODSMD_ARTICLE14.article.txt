# FOUR SUSPECTS IN TRAIN WRECK ROBBERY CAUGHT
## California Police Network Begins Efforts to Find Railroad Robbers 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 11.
Dawn today brought an intensified
but secret search for the wreckers
of the Southern Pacific's West Coast
Limited last night near Saugus, with
a penalty of death facing the despera
does if they are apprehended.
In the fine network of police look
outs established a few hours after two
robbers had plunged a part of the
train into a ditch by loosening rails
and then held up a score of passen
gers, two men and two women had
been caught as suspects.
Names Concealed
Their names were not given but
they were arrested in a bootlegging
establishment following a suspicious
conversation reported to police by a
motion picture film extra player. The
man said he heard one of the men
remark: "That wreck, say I know
about it." The informer's name was
concealed.
In the crash only one person was
hurt, the engineer, R. C. Ball, who
received burns from which he can
recover, physicians said. The sngine
and four cars were overturned as the
speeding train hit the weakened rails
on a curve six miles west of Saugus.
