"May the people so respond to the
call of the National Red Cross that it
may enlarge its service for human
ity," stated Ray Lyman Wilbur in a
recent message concerning the annual
appeal for membership of the or
ganization.
The results of the first day's cam
paign of the Red Cross Drive on the
campus is as follows: Pi Beta Phi
and Alpha Chi Omega leading with
100%, having raised $18 and $21 re
spectively, Roble $25, Branner $25,
Toyon $25, Japanese Club $10, Gamma
Phi Beta $7, Alpha Phi and Chi Omega
$5, Delta Gamma $4.
Dr. Harry Reynolds, head of the
Palo Alto chapter, in order to prevent
the Red Cross Drive detracting from
Stanford's other charity, the Conva
lescent Home, has offered $25 to the
hall which has the largest donation.
This money is to be used toward the
next Convalescent Home Drive.
