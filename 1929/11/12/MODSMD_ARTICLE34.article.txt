# HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR WORLD?

The Oxford Debate, which is pre-eminently the outstanding event of
the Stanford forensic season, will be held in the Assembly Hall tonight
with Stanford upholding the affirmative side of the question, "Resolved,
That this is the best of all possible worlds."
Since the memorable Oxford debate three years ago when the local
audience was amused by the easy, informal style of the Englishmen,
Stanford debaters have been influenced by the Oxford type of speech
and will meet the visitors on their own terms. Distinctly a departure from
the traditional American clash of logic, the debate will be entertaining in
that logic will be tempered with wit.
From the topic, we may expect to hear numerous allusions to Thomas
More's Utopia and Plato's Republic. Old world ideas will be contrasted
with those representing the newest portion of the new world. Since we
all have ideas of our own concerning this world and its society, it will
be interesting to hear the ideas propounded by six able speakers—espe
cially when they will probably make use of coercive satire to fortify their
points.
