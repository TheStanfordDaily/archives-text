# A 						TRIUMPH OF DEMOCRACY?
## 
### 
While certain enthusiasts are pointing with pride to the convictions
of Albert B. Fall and Alexander Pantages as shining examples of the
success of our democracy, obscure news dispatches inform the world that
an Oklahoma man was recently sent to jail for life because he robbed an
oil station of $1.13.
To be sure, Fall was found guilty of perpetrating one of the greatest
grafts in this nation's history. To be sure, the multimillionaire theater
magnate was convicted of one of society's most abhorrent crimes. But
why should these facts be called a proof of democracy's success?
Why should not Albert B. Fall and Alexander Pantages answer for
these crimes? Why should there be anything unusual in the fact that
two men, who happen to have a great deal of money, are sent the same
way any other two men would be sent for like offenses? Is that a triumph
for democracy?
If the time ever comes when rich men can be tried, convicted, and
sent to prison without creating any unusual stir of amazement, then will
democracy really mean something.
