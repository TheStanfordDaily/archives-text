# GOOD SPORT
## 
### 
"Good sport" has come to carry as high and as complimentary a con
notation as the phrase "gallant gentleman" ever did. Today the ethics and
principles of good sportsmanship are being drilled into children from the
time they learn to speak. A good sport is given the real admiration of his
friends and contemporaries.
So it is in life, and so it is on the football field. An athlete once said
that he sincerely believed much of the interest in football was derived
from the fact that when watching a football game the spectator saw life
pictured on the gridiron. That life was a scries of offensive and defensive
plays with gains and losses, each a part of the game.
The little boy goes beaming home to mother when a friend calls him
a good sport; but the little boy also fights the person who dares to insinu
ate he is not. In the game, whether it is life or on the gridiron, qualifying
as a good sport is as important as making the score, and proud is the
school who can point to their team and their rooters as good sports. —
