## WRITTEN BETWEEN FIFTHS? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Come yo music lovers and gather
around the band. When the Sons of
Troy would rudely awake us from our
calm, let the band tune up and render
softly some celestial hymn or even
better a lullaby.
Heaven forbid that we, tho Sons of
Stanford Red, should break loose in
spirited song and cheer. Trojans in
their vulgar way show us the evils
of a spirited song or cheer—for does
not the Carnegie Report show us this?
In our quiet and unassuming way
let us prepare ourselves for the Bears
—now that wo are sure that the team
Is terrible, the coach is lousy, and

nobody else has any school spirit. Of
course we ourselves know we've got
the spirit—haven't we between fifths
cussed like hell, told the team to
watch for a pass, and given the coach
to understand if he'd been around
maybe he would know somethin? Oh
yeah, I almost forgot the band and
tho yell leaders, but they're too lousy
to mention anyhow.
Stranger things have happened—
maybe on the 23rd the band will have
lost their hymnals and the boys'll have
a lot of fire that'll make the fighting
Cardinals know they've got one break
even though the Bares get ruff and
tuff.
Sincerely,
"One of the Boys."
