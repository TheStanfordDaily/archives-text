"THE WILD HEART OF AFRICA"—
California Theatre, Mayfleld.
This film record of the African
game expedition of Ken and Cub
Walker, two graduates of Stanford, is,
like other pictures of Its kind, ex
tremely fascinating to the lover of
wild animal films. While it Is not very
different from the eight or ten others
we have seen, close-up pictures of
hippopotami on the charge, of vul
tures devouring the abandoned car
casses of elephants, and of weirdly
deformed natives, never cease to hold
interest for those who appreciate
serious animal pictures.
"The Wild Heart of Africa" takes
the entire trip from the mouth of the
Nile into the "wild heart" where even
the Ford truck cannot penetrate. The
Walkers have secured some fine views
of the usual lions, leopards, ele
phants, water buffalo, gazelles, ante
lopes, zebras, and giraffes, as well as
some very remarkable pictures of the
more unusual inhabitants of Africa,
including the priceless egret, crested
cranes, flamingos, oryx, and horned
hogs. Numerous formidable beasts are
encountered at apparently close
range, and some very interesting
shots are shown of ostriches and
giraffes racing side-by-side with the
truck which carries the camera-man.
According to the Ford speedometer,
the former travel about thirty miles
an hour, and the latter about thirty
five miles an hour.
Perhaps the one mar on this excel
lent film is the ever-present, wise
cracking caption writer. Forced hu
mor —awfully forced humor — runs
throughout the picture. The usual
smart ones about African fashion
shows and such become more and
more obnoxious as one perceives that
they are neither clever nor original.
Had the picture been allowed to pro
ceed on its already fascinating theme
without this futile attempt to be amus
ing, it would have been a finer one.
But regardless of the captions, "The
Wild Heart of Africa" is an entertain
ing manifestation of the achievement

of two Stanford men who, as a result
of this expedition, are ranked with
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Johnson of
"Safari" fame.

Last September I paid one dollar
and fifty cents to see this picture
when it was shown at roadshow rates
in Los Angeles. Last month I took a
trip to San Francisco to see it. Last
night I postponed mid-term pre-mor
tems to see it again. It's that kind of
a picture.
Dale Van Every, a Stanford gradu
ate, wrote the story. Marion Davies is
a wise girl, for in making her talkie
debut she has picked the best all
round songs, cast, and plot that have
graced the screeu since "The Broad
way Melody."
There are song hits galore—"Mari
anne," "Hang On To Me," "Just You,
Just Me," "Blondy,"—and several
others. Lawrence Gray, who never
made much impression in the old
fashioned silents, surprises with an
excellent singing voice. As a very
human buck private in love with the
fair French girl he is the most like
able hero of many a month. (His
forthcoming appearance as leading
man for the Duncan Sisters in their
first talkie is anticipated.)
Marion Davies herself makes Old
Man Mike her humble servant. She
brings the splendid pantomime de
veloped in silent pictures, plus a good
speaking and singing voice. Her imi
tations are very clever —the sequence
in which she masquerades as the
"frog lieut" being especially well
done. She is one of the best of the
movies' comediennes.
There are two new comedians from
the stage in "Marianne" who are the
most amusing fellows to "talkie" we've
seen or heard yet. Ukelele Ike and
Benny Rubin. Ike Bings and Benny
dances, and if you haven't heard them
tell about the girl from New Chateau
—well, "you ain't heard nothin' yet!"
Stanford can be proud that one of
its alumnus wrote this story.

"THE WILD HEART OF AFRICA"—
California Theatre, Mayfleld.
This film record of the African
game expedition of Ken and Cub
Walker, two graduates of Stanford, is,
like other pictures of Its kind, ex
tremely fascinating to the lover of
wild animal films. While it Is not very
different from the eight or ten others
we have seen, close-up pictures of
hippopotami on the charge, of vul
tures devouring the abandoned car
casses of elephants, and of weirdly
deformed natives, never cease to hold
interest for those who appreciate
serious animal pictures.
"The Wild Heart of Africa" takes
the entire trip from the mouth of the
Nile into the "wild heart" where even
the Ford truck cannot penetrate. The
Walkers have secured some fine views
of the usual lions, leopards, ele
phants, water buffalo, gazelles, ante
lopes, zebras, and giraffes, as well as
some very remarkable pictures of the
more unusual inhabitants of Africa,
including the priceless egret, crested
cranes, flamingos, oryx, and horned
hogs. Numerous formidable beasts are
encountered at apparently close
range, and some very interesting
shots are shown of ostriches and
giraffes racing side-by-side with the
truck which carries the camera-man.
According to the Ford speedometer,
the former travel about thirty miles
an hour, and the latter about thirty
five miles an hour.
Perhaps the one mar on this excel
lent film is the ever-present, wise
cracking caption writer. Forced hu
mor —awfully forced humor — runs
throughout the picture. The usual
smart ones about African fashion
shows and such become more and
more obnoxious as one perceives that
they are neither clever nor original.
Had the picture been allowed to pro
ceed on its already fascinating theme
without this futile attempt to be amus
ing, it would have been a finer one.
But regardless of the captions, "The
Wild Heart of Africa" is an entertain
ing manifestation of the achievement

of two Stanford men who, as a result
of this expedition, are ranked with
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Johnson of
"Safari" fame.
"MARIANNE"—Varsity Theatre.
Last September I paid one dollar
and fifty cents to see this picture
when it was shown at roadshow rates
in Los Angeles. Last month I took a
trip to San Francisco to see it. Last
night I postponed mid-term pre-mor
tems to see it again. It's that kind of
a picture.
Dale Van Every, a Stanford gradu
ate, wrote the story. Marion Davies is
a wise girl, for in making her talkie
debut she has picked the best all
round songs, cast, and plot that have
graced the screeu since "The Broad
way Melody."
There are song hits galore—"Mari
anne," "Hang On To Me," "Just You,
Just Me," "Blondy,"—and several
others. Lawrence Gray, who never
made much impression in the old
fashioned silents, surprises with an
excellent singing voice. As a very
human buck private in love with the
fair French girl he is the most like
able hero of many a month. (His
forthcoming appearance as leading
man for the Duncan Sisters in their
first talkie is anticipated.)
Marion Davies herself makes Old
Man Mike her humble servant. She
brings the splendid pantomime de
veloped in silent pictures, plus a good
speaking and singing voice. Her imi
tations are very clever —the sequence
in which she masquerades as the
"frog lieut" being especially well
done. She is one of the best of the
movies' comediennes.
There are two new comedians from
the stage in "Marianne" who are the
most amusing fellows to "talkie" we've
seen or heard yet. Ukelele Ike and
Benny Rubin. Ike Bings and Benny
dances, and if you haven't heard them
tell about the girl from New Chateau
—well, "you ain't heard nothin' yet!"
Stanford can be proud that one of

"THE WILD HEART OF AFRICA"—
California Theatre, Mayfleld.
This film record of the African
game expedition of Ken and Cub
Walker, two graduates of Stanford, is,
like other pictures of Its kind, ex
tremely fascinating to the lover of
wild animal films. While it Is not very
different from the eight or ten others
we have seen, close-up pictures of
hippopotami on the charge, of vul
tures devouring the abandoned car
casses of elephants, and of weirdly
deformed natives, never cease to hold
interest for those who appreciate
serious animal pictures.
"The Wild Heart of Africa" takes
the entire trip from the mouth of the
Nile into the "wild heart" where even
the Ford truck cannot penetrate. The
Walkers have secured some fine views
of the usual lions, leopards, ele
phants, water buffalo, gazelles, ante
lopes, zebras, and giraffes, as well as
some very remarkable pictures of the
more unusual inhabitants of Africa,
including the priceless egret, crested
cranes, flamingos, oryx, and horned
hogs. Numerous formidable beasts are
encountered at apparently close
range, and some very interesting
shots are shown of ostriches and
giraffes racing side-by-side with the
truck which carries the camera-man.
According to the Ford speedometer,
the former travel about thirty miles
an hour, and the latter about thirty
five miles an hour.
Perhaps the one mar on this excel
lent film is the ever-present, wise
cracking caption writer. Forced hu
mor —awfully forced humor — runs
throughout the picture. The usual
smart ones about African fashion
shows and such become more and
more obnoxious as one perceives that
they are neither clever nor original.
Had the picture been allowed to pro
ceed on its already fascinating theme
without this futile attempt to be amus
ing, it would have been a finer one.
But regardless of the captions, "The
Wild Heart of Africa" is an entertain
ing manifestation of the achievement

of two Stanford men who, as a result
of this expedition, are ranked with
Mr. and Mrs. Martin Johnson of
"Safari" fame.
"MARIANNE"—Varsity Theatre.
Last September I paid one dollar
and fifty cents to see this picture
when it was shown at roadshow rates
in Los Angeles. Last month I took a
trip to San Francisco to see it. Last
night I postponed mid-term pre-mor
tems to see it again. It's that kind of
a picture.
Dale Van Every, a Stanford gradu
ate, wrote the story. Marion Davies is
a wise girl, for in making her talkie
debut she has picked the best all
round songs, cast, and plot that have
graced the screeu since "The Broad
way Melody."
There are song hits galore—"Mari
anne," "Hang On To Me," "Just You,
Just Me," "Blondy,"—and several
others. Lawrence Gray, who never
made much impression in the old
fashioned silents, surprises with an
excellent singing voice. As a very
human buck private in love with the
fair French girl he is the most like
able hero of many a month. (His
forthcoming appearance as leading
man for the Duncan Sisters in their
first talkie is anticipated.)
Marion Davies herself makes Old
Man Mike her humble servant. She
brings the splendid pantomime de
veloped in silent pictures, plus a good
speaking and singing voice. Her imi
tations are very clever —the sequence
in which she masquerades as the
"frog lieut" being especially well
done. She is one of the best of the
movies' comediennes.
There are two new comedians from
the stage in "Marianne" who are the
most amusing fellows to "talkie" we've
seen or heard yet. Ukelele Ike and
Benny Rubin. Ike Bings and Benny
dances, and if you haven't heard them
tell about the girl from New Chateau
—well, "you ain't heard nothin' yet!"
Stanford can be proud that one of
its alumnus wrote this story.
