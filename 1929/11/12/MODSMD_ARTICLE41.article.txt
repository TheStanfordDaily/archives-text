# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### Philip Space 
Lately we just couldn't be bothered
writing "Cabbages." But the cruel
March of Progress has thrown us out
of our lethargic state, and we hereby
present this editorial comment, with
apologies concerning the inclusion of
serious matter in this erstwhile gay,
gay column.
Don't worry, we won't show up on
the page for quite awhile again. Par
don the intrusion, Mr. Reviewer.
All Are Gone, the Old Familiar
Places . . .
Well, Mr. Roth, now that you've
torn down Roble Bridge, what
next? It was "unsafe." That it was
a revered campus landmark and
a place of picturesque tradition
didn't matter. The golf course will
be a swell money-maker and let's
get everything else out of the way
Of course, it might have been
used as a foot bridge for said
course, but . . .
How about Frenchman's Tower?
That's sufficiently harmless to be
torn down. What good does it do?
People only stroll by and tell
stories about it. What use are
old tales? The present generation
doesn't care anyhow.
Let's get rid of Senator Stan
ford's old stables. They're awfully
unsightly. If the old Stanford
Farm is going to be a scientific
experimental station let's go the
full distance.
Blash on the hallowed past!
There are a couple of treasured
oaks that ought to go. And those
trees that stood by the library
windows were awfully silly,
weren't they?
Why bother to try and save the
Palo Alto tree. Let's cut it down
for the bonfire.
Why not appoint a committee,
Mr. Roth, to make a list of all
the landmarks and do something
about them?
And let's, by all means, have an
electric sign at the new gate to

the University. Be progressive!
The cactus gardens are about
due.
Leave the tomb, though. Please.
We didn't have to write this one at
all. Somebody at the University of
Southern California did it for us.
Doubtless the same fellow who con
tributed "The Trojan Oath" in one
of "Cabbages'" last appearances.
It's the new S.C. song, and it's called
"On for Troy." Notice the clever and
complicated rhyming particularly.
Hats off, fellows.
Figlit on for Southern California,
Put the ball across the line;
Fight for Southern California,
There it goes across this time.
Fight for Southern California;
Let us fight with all our might.
So it's fight, fight, fight,
Trojan varsity, fight for Troy.
