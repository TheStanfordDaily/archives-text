# SONG PRACTICE TO BE LED BY GLEE CLUB IN MEN'S GROUPS TODAY
## 
### 
Members of the Glee Club immedi
ately after lunch today will visit men's
living groups on the campus to lead
a half hour's program of Stanford
songs, according to Del Culling, club
president.
A committee composed of members
of the Rally Committee has arranged
to have the groups of singers, accom
panied by members of the committee,
visit each living group during the next
week and a half. Committee members
are: Harry Berg, chairman, Alice
Ingraham, Fred Ilubler, George Mc-
Kee, and Paul Speegle.
"Son of a Gambolier," which has not
been sung in the bleachers since 1925
when Ernie Nevers was varsity foot
ball captain, will be used in this year's
Big Game. The two verses which have
been selected are printed on page
three of today's Daily. Other songs
that will be sung are the "Hymn,"
"The Cardinal Is Waving," "Hail
Alma Mater," "Sons of the Stanford
Red," and "Stanford Forever."
