Another freshman football team has
played Its last game together. Satur
day saw eleren young men represent
ing the Class of 1033 fall before the
powerful drive of another determined
group of frosh, those of the Univer
sity of California, in their final game
of the year.
Tho freshman football season is
Bhort, ending a bare seven weeks
after the opening day of the fall
quarter. In fact it is much too short
a time in which to master the intri
cate plays of the Warner system.
Many of the frosh know little even
of the fundamentals of football, block
ing, clipping, and tackling. Their first
week is spent with the tackling
dummy and the blackboard. In their
firßt game they go up against a strong
junior college team, composed mostly
of men who have played a year to
gether. Then somo more strong junior
college organizations, and other fresh
man teams are encountered.
After a short seven weeks they
have played their last game as a team.
Many will be seen on the varsity in
the near future; others will serve an
intermediate term on the Grays, and
Btill others will drop from gridiron
circles.
Stiff Schedule
Coach "Husky" Hunt worked hard
trying to make thi3 year's freshman
organization into a strong offensive
team. But the freshmen were handi
capped with an exceptionally stiff
schedule. For seven weeks in a row,
from the opening to the closing con
test, they went up against strong
teams. While it is true that they did
develop a strong defense, they had no
opportunity to work up a successful
offense.
Against California Saturday, the
Stanford offense failed to function as
it should have. The reverses and dou
ble reverses were too slow. The line
work was effective, but the playing
behind the line of scrimmage was at
fault. The backs were too slow in
getting started, and more than once
were spilled fcr losses.
There was plenty of good material
available for this year's frosh team,
and many of the players should serve
well on future Warner varsities. The
two 200-pound tackles, Artman and
Choate, have played good football this
year. Bates at center, Hedge at end,
Stevens at full, Targhetta at quarter,
and Afflerbaugh at half, will all bear
watching in the future.
Afflerbaugh Good
Afflerbaugh has been the outstand
ing performer of the Card backfield
this season. He is a slippery open field
runner, a good passer, and a fair
punter. Alone he has gained more
yardage from scrimmage than all the
other backs together. But, Mr. Affler
baugh has a fumbling tendency. He in
variably carries the ball under the
wrong arm, and fails to shift it before
being tackled. The net result is, that
many times the tackier grabs the arm
supporting the pigskin, and the ball
takes a free ride over the gridiron.
But this matter can easily be leme
died with a little practice, and Ken
Afflerbaugh will undoubtedly be a
great halfback in years to come.
The frosh hit their stride in the
game against St. Mary's, which the
Saints won by a 7 to 6 score. In this
contest they outplayed the Gaels for
two quarters, and were again starting
an offensive drive, when the final gun
went off, ten minutes too soon. The
contest was late in starting, and the
officials cut the time short to enable
the Varsity-Caltecli fray to start at
scheduled time. Quite a good idea —
for the Saints.
But the season is over now, and why
worry about the past. Perhaps the
Rally Committee will suggest that the
frosh keep training, so that they will
be in condition to build a big bonfire.
