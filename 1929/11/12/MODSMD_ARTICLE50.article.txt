# SPORTS OF 1929

### BY FEG MURRAY 
Here Is Marshall Duffield of the
University of Southern California,
who, in the words of Pop Warner in
his story on the U.S.C.-Stanford game,
made "about as pretty a piece of open
field running as I have ever seen."
Pop wrote that just after Howard
Jones' Trojans had administered a
7 to 0 spanking to Warner's team in
a battle that probably decided the
Pacific Coast Conference Champion
ship. And the main cog in the Trojan
machine was that same Marshall Duf
field, brilliant junior quarterback.
Duffield engineered the Southerners'
touchdown march, in which they
drove the length of the field from
their own 20-yard line, and did a lot
of effective ball-carrying himself, in
cluding a 35-yard dash. He followed
this up with a quick, bullet-like pass
which the end caught for the only
touchdown of the game. And, in the

game which saw such fine ball-carriers
as Jesse Hill, Russ Saunders, Phil
Moffatt, and Chuck Smalling, Duffield
was the ground-gaining star of the
day, amassing 94 yards in eighteen
plays for an average of better than
5 yards per crack. And remember,
this was against a team of Stanford's
strength, a team which stopped the
great Cagle cold last December.
Marshall Duffield is nineteen years
old, weighs 170 pounds, and stands
5 feet 9 inches in height. He comes
from Santa Monica, California, and
Stanford wishes he'd stayed there.
The lad was a riot against Washing
ton, too, and in both the Stanford and
Washington games his handling and
running back of punts was exception
ally good. Eastern and Midwestern
critics will get a chance to see Duffield
in action against Notre Dame next
Saturday.
