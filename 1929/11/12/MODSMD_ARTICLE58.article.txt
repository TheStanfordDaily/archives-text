# CARDINALS CAPTURE HUSKY PELT AFTER GRUELLING COMBAT
## Redshirts Prepare To Meet Santa Clara; Broncos Strong This Year 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Back on the Farm again, still shak
ing inud off their togs as well as cer
tain memories of the Washington
game from their minds, the Cardinal
varsity football players will start
working out behind barred gates this
afternoon in preparation for the Gold
en Bear invasion two weeks from
now. The Stanford team, thirty-three
strong, accompanied by Coach Pop
Warner and his assistants, returned
to Palo Alto last night, having left
Seattle on Sunday evening.
A tough battle was expected from
the Huskies, yet the resistance put up
by the northern lads was even
stronger than Pop had counted on,
and according to the multitude of
fans and sports critics who witnessed
the clash, Stanford was quite lucky
to win. It seems that the Redshirts
had a hard enough time wallowing
around in the sticky mud and slimy
puddles of the rain-sodden Washing
ton Stadium, let alone trying to work
their intricate reverses, laterals, and
spin plays. At the same time, the
Huskies lived up true to form by play
ing their best game of the season
against the Cards.
Although the Stanford players ab
sorbed a sound battering on Saturday,
none of them sustained injuries bad
enough to keep them out of action
during the next couple of weeks. Pop
was forced to use several of his more
or less crippled players against Coach
Bagshaw's men, including Captain
Muller, Herb Fleishhacker, and Ray
Dawson, and each of them came
through with a good game. It was
Fleishhacker's defensive work that
largely kept the Huskies from scor
ing in the last few minutes of play.
With a tough game behind them
and a tougher game coming up on the
23rd, the Cards will be forced to take
Santa Clara in stride this week end.
However, the Mission team will un
doubtedly throw a goodly number of
scares into Pop and his forty-nine
Redshirts, as Clipper Smith's band of
agile moleskin wearers came close to
tripping up the unbeaten and un
scored-on St. Mary's varsity last Sat
urday.
