# N.S.F.A. IS REQUESTED TO DISCUSS CARNEGIE REPORT AT CONGRESS
## 
### 
That the validity of the Carnegie
Subsidization Report be the main
topic considered by the National Stu
dents Federation of America at Its
congress, which is to be held on the
Stanford campus January 1-4, is the
request of the U.C.L.A. delegation.
The meeting of the congress here
will afford colleges the only oppor
tunity of taking official cognizance
nationally of the truth of the Car
negie accusations, since the N.S.F.A.
is the only national organization of
its kind in the United States.
Approximately 245 of the outstand
ing colleges in the country are mem
bers of the N.S.F.A. and a largo pro
portion of these institutions were men
tioned in the Carnegie report.
Stan Weigle, president of the
A.S.S.U. two years ago has suggested
that the question of prohibition be
considered by the convention.
