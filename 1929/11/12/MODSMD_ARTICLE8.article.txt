ist, will give the second lecture in his
series on Elements of Music, entitled
"Melodies and Instruments," tomor
row evening in the Little Theatre at
7:30 o'clock.
Allen will review briefly the subject
matter of the first lecture on "Melody"
and take up the subject of instru
ments, their evolution, peculiar char
acter, and their effect on musical art.
Since a knowledge of overtones is
essential to understand the reasons for
the individual color of an instrument,
these will be discusscd as an approach
to the study of the elements of music.
The different families of instruments
will be described, with emphasis on
the character and the types of melody
best suited to each. His points will be
illustrated by selections on the vari
ous musical instruments.
