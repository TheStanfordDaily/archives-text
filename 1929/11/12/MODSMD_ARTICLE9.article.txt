# Stanford Men Reorganize Old Cardinal Chess Club
## 
### 
The Cardinal Chess Club, which dis
solved two years ago because of lack
of interest, has been reorganized by
Angelo M. May, Jr., and Ellid H.
Blade.
According to May, the plans of the
club have not been definitely formu
lated as yet, but it is the intention of
the organizers to engage in match
play with junior college and freshman
teams. He does not expect that they
will be prepared to meet the Cali
fornia varsity for a year or two yet.
