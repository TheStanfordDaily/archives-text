"Drizzle,
drizzle..."
It's bound to rain sometimes,
even in the best regulated cli
mates. But don't let that make
any party of yours a fizzle.
A Fish Brand Slicker is a
comfortable, chummy sort of
garment that makes good
times possible regardless of
storms and showers.
You can buy a genuine Fish
Brand Slicker almost any
where for the price of a couple
of theatre tickets. A. J. Tower
Company, Boston, Mass.
