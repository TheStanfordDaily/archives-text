# DAILY, CHAPPIE ARE SKEPTICAL ABOUT A GREAT GRID CLASSIC
## 
### 
Mystery and expectation hover
over the publication corner to
day. "Will the Daily and Chapar
ral athletes mix in their annual
grid clash Saturday?" is the
question on every lip.
"We must keep our amateur
standing," chuckles the Old Boy,
as he looks deprecatingly out of
his window at the Daily building
below. "An ugly rumor informs
us of the scandalous subsidiza
tion of Daily athletes. We must
think twice before an official
challenge is issued."
"We are ready for anything,"
announced the journalists, who
declared their expectation of a
challenge to the contest which
would be held between halves at
the Stanford-Santa Clara game.
