# Oxford Man Remarks On Rigid Regulation In American Universities
## 
### Reid Briggs 
To William J. K. Diplock, the rigid
regulation of students' time with fre
quent check on the work accomplished
and the system of co-education are
the most striking differences between
the American universities he has
visited on his tour with the Oxford
debate team and the universities of
England.
"At Oxford, after taking prelimin
ary entrance examinations, we follow
our courses niore or less as we please.
Much of the work is done independent
of the Dons, or faculty. Instead of
having frequent examinations as you
do, our final examination for the de
gree covers all the work of the three
year period."
The visiting debater finds Ameri
can co-education very interesting. Tra
dition is all against higher education
of women in England, and co-educa
tion there is relatively new. There
are few co-educational universities,
and they are regarded as unique.
English Co-eds Few
"There are women at Oxford," Dip
lock said, "but they are limited by
statute to one-fifth of the student
body. They do not mingle with the
other students."
Only academic work is controlled
by the Oxford university authorities.
All extra-curricular activities are
sponsored by student clubs.
"Oxford students undertake debat
ing, like all other activities, purely for
amusement. Their subjects are fre
quently political, for nearly every stu
dent takes a keen interest in politics.
Many of them plan to 'stand' for Par
liament. Their attitude in debating is
to have as much fun as possible, and
a witty team is thought better than
one which presents only facts and
logic.
"American students who come to
Oxford as Rhodes scholars are well
liked by the English students. They
are fine men, and usually take active
part in many student activities."
