# 'POP' SEEKS TO IMPROVE CARD ATTACK
## Stanford's Ball Carrying in Husky Tilt Displeases Coach Warner 
### Stephen Dietrich 
A stiff signal drill plus an hour's
scrimmage were in store for the
Cardinal football varsity yesterday af
ternoon in the players' first workoul
since the Husky game at Seattle last
week-end. Coach Pop Warner was far
from pleased by the way his charges
tried to tote the pigskin for gains
against Washington, and, as a conse
quence, has started concentrating on
tuning up the Stanford offense for
the three hard battles yet remaining
in the 1929 gridiron season.
Although no injuries were sustained
last Saturday, none of the men who
saw action in the Husky clash got
into yesterday's scrimmage session.
Chuck Smalling was the only player
not out in suit, but he will be ready
for the Santa Clara game on Satur
day. Smalling, along with most of
the other regulars, was badly bruised
and skinned-up by a combination of
hard smashing Washington giants and
the coarse, sandy, puddle-covered
floor of the Seattle Stadium.
Heiser, Simkins Back
Pete Heiser and Bill Simkins, nei
ther of whom traveled north with the
team because of knee injuries, were
running signals again. Classed as
regulars before the season opened,
both of these men have been forced
to view most of the games from the
bench, and their absence from the
lineup has proven a blow to the Cards'
title chances. Simkins' passing has
been missed, while interference run
ning has slumped due to Heiser's so
journ on the sidelines. With their re
turn to the practice field again, it is
more than probable that they will see
their share of action in the Big Game.
The playing of Harry Hillman, at
fullback, featured yesterday's scrim
mage. He proceeded to tear the op
posing line into shreds by his smash
ing plunges, and several times broke
out in the open for lengthy gains. The
squad's two "Albie" Bills, Clark and
Laird, also looked good in packing
the ball, and several times ran the
length of the field on reverses and
laterals.
Taylor Looks Good
Perry Taylor played a good defens
ive game at center, and made a large
percentage of the tackles. Taylor is
a big rangy lad with plenty of punch,
and the way he has been going of late
he seems to be a sure bet to step into
Walt Heinecke's place on the first
string lineup next fall.
The only casualty of the dav re
sulted when Phil Winnek bruised his
shoulder.

A stiff signal drill plus an hour's
scrimmage were in store for the
Cardinal football varsity yesterday af
ternoon in the players' first workoul
since the Husky game at Seattle last
week-end. Coach Pop Warner was far
from pleased by the way his charges
tried to tote the pigskin for gains
against Washington, and, as a conse
quence, has started concentrating on
tuning up the Stanford offense for
the three hard battles yet remaining
in the 1929 gridiron season.
Although no injuries were sustained
last Saturday, none of the men who
saw action in the Husky clash got
into yesterday's scrimmage session.
Chuck Smalling was the only player
not out in suit, but he will be ready
for the Santa Clara game on Satur
day. Smalling, along with most of
the other regulars, was badly bruised
and skinned-up by a combination of
hard smashing Washington giants and
the coarse, sandy, puddle-covered
floor of the Seattle Stadium.
Heiser, Simkins Back
Pete Heiser and Bill Simkins, nei
ther of whom traveled north with the
team because of knee injuries, were
running signals again. Classed as
regulars before the season opened,
both of these men have been forced
to view most of the games from the
bench, and their absence from the
lineup has proven a blow to the Cards'
title chances. Simkins' passing has
been missed, while interference run
ning has slumped due to Heiser's so
journ on the sidelines. With their re
turn to the practice field again, it is
more than probable that they will see
their share of action in the Big Game.
The playing of Harry Hillman, at
fullback, featured yesterday's scrim
mage. He proceeded to tear the op
posing line into shreds by his smash
ing plunges, and several times broke
out in the open for lengthy gains. The
squad's two "Albie" Bills, Clark and
Laird, also looked good in packing
the ball, and several times ran the
length of the field on reverses and
laterals.
Taylor Looks Good
Perry Taylor played a good defens
ive game at center, and made a large
percentage of the tackles. Taylor is
a big rangy lad with plenty of punch,
and the way he has been going of late
he seems to be a sure bet to step into
Walt Heinecke's place on the first
string lineup next fall.
