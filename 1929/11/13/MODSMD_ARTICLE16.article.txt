# New Creek Bridge Will Be Open To Traffic This Week
## 
### 
The new San Francisquito creek
bridge will be open for traffic by the
end of the present week, according to
Collins and Martin, contractors.
Scores of cars are being turned back
daily from attempting to cross the
nearly completed structure. In replac
ing the old bridge which collapsed
last spring with a sight-seeing bus,
Santa Clara and San Mateo counties
have expended $27,325.
Construction on the bridge has heen
pushed as rapidly as possible since it
was started July 17, in order that Big
Game traffic may be routed to and
from the campus in that direction.
All the concrete has been poured, and
the asphaltic concrete surface of the
roadway across the bridge will be
completed by tonight.
