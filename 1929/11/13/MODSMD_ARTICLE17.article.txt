# BIG GAME BONFIRE HISTORY SHOWS RAPID INCREASE OF SCHOOL SPIRIT
## 
### 
I Stanford's Big Game bonfire is as
! old as the Big Game itself. In the
! early '90' a, the student body was
j forced to wedge its way into the Lit-
I tie Theatre, the only auditorium on
I the campus, to hold its rally. From
there the crowd serpentined through
the inner quad to the bonfire which
was erected on the present site of the
library.
In 1898, the year of California's first
football victory over Stanford, the As
sembly Hall was completed. There
after the rallies were held there. The
bonfires continued to be built on the
original site which was then a prac
tice football field.
The close of the third decade in the
history of the bonfire brought changes.
The building of the new library,
which was finished in 1919, made it
necessary to move the fire to a loca
j tion west of the power house. Several
years later the scene of the rally was
changed to the new Basketball Pa
vilion, and with the exception of one
; year, when the rally preceding the
j bonfire was held in the stadium, it has
| been staged in the Pavilion each year

The bonfire reached its most gigan
tic proportions in 1926 when one was
reared nearly 90 feet in the air.
Four times in its history the Big
Game pyre has been burned prema
turely. The first successful attempt
was in 1901; the second was in 1914.
In 1925 early on the morning of the
day before the rally while the frosh
guards were changing shifts, the bon
fire was touched off and burned to
the ground. The student body volun
teered support of the freshmen and
another was reared in time for the
rally.
The fourth premature burning oc
curred last fall. What was believed to
have been a timed bomb started the
blaze. The students cut their classes
and in less than thirty-six hours an
other bonfire, GO feet high, was raised
and the rally was held as scheduled.
Though the efforts of incendiaries
have succeeded but four times in the
history of the bonfire, the unsuccess
ful attempts have been numerous and
varied. In 1920 and 1922 bombs were
dropped from an airplane. In 1923 a
blaze got started but was easily ex
tinguished.
