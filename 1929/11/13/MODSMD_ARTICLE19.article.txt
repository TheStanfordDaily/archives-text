# Warren Allen Offers Second Lecture On Elements Of Music
## 
### 
"Melodies and Instruments" will be
the subject of the second lecture in
the series on Elements of Music to be
given by Warren D. Allen tonight in
the Little Theatre at 7:30 o'clock.
After a brief review of the subject
matter of the first lecture on "Mel
ody," Allen will discuss the instru
ments, their evolution, peculiar char
acter, and their effect on musical art.
The three different families of in
struments — percussion, wind, and
strings — will be described and the
character and types of melody best
suited to each family will be empha
sized. In order to understand the rea
sons for the individual color of an
instrument, a knowledge of overtones
is essential. These will be discussed
as an approach to the study of the
elements of music.
Melodies for and individual colors
of the various instruments will be
illustrated by Eleanor Page ou the
oboe and English horn; Robert Lipp
mann, the clarinet; Ottis Will, the
flute; Frank Copley, the cello; Eliza
beth Peirce, violin; and Prof. A. B.
Whitaker, the French horn.
