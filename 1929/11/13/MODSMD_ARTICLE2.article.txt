gym work, Dr. Royce R. Long an
nounced last night, but more men are
needed for the first-year tumbling
team. Competition with California is
scheduled for winter quarter, and all

Exhibitions for the varsity gym
team are now being arranged, and
several are planned for the first part

used to advantage on the squad, and
it is not too late to sign up now for
classwork in this sport.
