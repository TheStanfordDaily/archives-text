STATISTICS AND SUPERVISION, BUT LITTLE SERVICE
Last October students were greeted on registration day with a three
dollar increase in incidental fee which was supposed to entitle them to
an improved health service. Five of the ninety-nine dollars paid each
quarter is now given to the Medical Adviser's department to keep stu
dents healthy.
What do they receive in return?
Upon registration they are given a very thorough physical exami
nation and answer a questionnaire that delves deeply into family history.
Statistics on the physical condition and tendencies of every student are
then filed away.
The student is entitled to further examinations whenever he desires,
and when confined to a hospital upon the advice of the department, re
ceives four dollars a day toward defraying his expenses. But if he
should suddenly become ill or injured, the staff of examining doctors
merely diagnose his case and send him away to a Palo Alto practitioner.
That is not the type of service in which the average student is inter
ested. Lie is well most of the time, but liable to be injured at any time.
Under the existing conditions he must seek assistance elsewhere than
the Medical Adviser's department.
What should be done about it?
A real campus infirmary where all ills could be cared for free of
charge would be the ideal situation. Granting that this is impractical at
present, it seems logical to expect that this medical service should be
extended to care for injuries received in University sponsored and su
pervised activities.
As the first step toward making the health supervision more practical,
the Daily advocates the institution of a first-aid service during intra
mural sport hours. A fifteen-dollar-a-year health insurance merits and
common sense urges immediate assistance for the injured.
