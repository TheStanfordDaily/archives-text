# HOW GREAT MINDS WORK
## 
### 
Associated Press dispatches from Washington carried the momentous
announcement yesterday that Representative Edwards, Democrat, Geor
gia, proposes to place his oar into the troubled waters of Army-Navy
athletics by introducing a bill that would prohibit West Point and An
napolis from engaging in any athletic contests with other schools until
they restore friendly relations.
America's future generals and admirals will undoubtedly feel flat
tered that their quarrel has attracted the interest of one so important and
busy as a United States Congressman must be. The Hon. Edwards must
have ceased for at least a half hour in his task of sending seeds and Con
gressional Records to the folks back home, to bring a great legislative
mind to play on the important problem, and after profound deliberation
decided that the Army and Navy boys are not capable of settling their
own problems.
What a boon!
