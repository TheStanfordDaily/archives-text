# OVER ORGANIZED
## 
### 
The past decade of college and university student life has been one
of organization of students into groups, and the functioning of these
brotherhoods in carrying on their respective activities on the campuses.
The University is a striking example of that tendency toward the union
of those having something in common in their campus life. At the pres
ent time, there is an organization for almost every conceivable class of
students, and wherever we find a number of men or women working to
a common end, we find a fraternity of that order.
The fact that such a multitude of organizations exists shows one of
two things. That the student body is over ambitious and energetic in the
carrying on of student work, or that there are more organizations on the
campus than there need be. The number of groups alone is not a sure
indication that the campus is over organized, for if every one of that
number accomplished a worth-while and definite purpose they should
all exist. Therein, however, is where some of them fall short, for they
are little more than mutual admiration societies which give their members
an excuse for wearing another activity key on their chain.
There are two kinds of work that an organization can do which make
it worth while and deserving of a place on the campus—that which in
some way or other benefits its members, and that which is of benefit to
individuals or groups which arc not a part of the fraternity. And some
thing that is of benefit to the members must be more constructive in its
nature than the semi-weekly "sessions" which offer the only excuse for
the existence of other organizations.
No campus has room for any "dead beat" student organizations and
others that come under that category should either do something or see
their charter taken away.—Purdue Exponent.
