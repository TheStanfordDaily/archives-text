THE UNKNOWN WARRIOR, A Trag
edy in Three Acts, by Paul Ray
nal. (The Century Co., Publishers.
New York. 1929.)
When I had read the first act of
"The Unknown Warrior" I was very
favorably impressed. At the end of
Act 11, I was convinced that I had
stumbled upon one of the very best
of modern tragedies. But, as I finished
the play, I turned away from it with
a feeling of disappointment apd dis
gust at the manner in which M. Ray
nal had ruined an excellent plot,
aborted the development of the trag
edy, and had, in general, tossed away
all the promise of the early acts in
order that he might present certain
of his own favorite insanities.
The plot concerns a French soldier
who accepts a duty which means cer
tain death upon the condition that he
be allowed a short leave of absence
which will give him a few hours with
his fiance. In order that she may be
completely happy for the time, he con
ceals from her this condition; while
she, for the same reason, conceals
from him the fact that she no longer
loves him. But not content with the
lies which cause happiness, each tries
to find the secret of the other; and
their discoveries of the tragic truth
make unhappy their time together.
Here the play should have ended.
Instead, it drags on for a third act
which becomes mock-lieroic.
The first act is clever and promis
ing. When asked if the horrors of war
have not made him think of God, the
soldier replies, "Among so many hor
rors, I thought it more courteous not
to think of him." He speaks of war
as having lost its past glory to be
come mere drudgery.
Notable in the second act, as laying
the basis of the tragedy which this
play should have become, is his
speech: "... my heart. Outside this

stiflling slavery of war, there is al
ways that refuge, Inviolable, greater
than the earth. And in this universe
of my heart, I am God. At my will the
past lives. The outside world cannot
enter. The present is marble at my
feet. 1 stop Time. Destiny marches at
my orders."
It is because of such promise as this
that the third act debacle is sadden
ing and disgusting. Raynal is young;
if he learns restraint and dramatic
construction he may well become
great. —E. £. W.
