The Editor, Sir:
Sometimes people wonder just why
students are called men and women
when so often they do not come up to
all that is expected of the mature in
dividual. Students have been given
the privilege of smoking on the first
floor of the Women's Clubhouse but
they have taken undue advantage of
it. Last year nearly $5000 was spent
on new linoleum which has become
blackened and riddled with holes from
lighted matches and cigarette stubs.
If Stanford students wish to continue
to smoke there it would be advisable
to treat the clubhouse as they would
treat any outside clubhouse and re
frain from throwing such refuse on
the floor, at least out of consideration
of others who have to use the rooms.
