# EARTH APPROACHING METEOR GROUP, SAYS PROFESSOR TOWNLEY
## Shooting Star Shower Will Mark Planet's Passage Through Orbit 
### 
The Earth will pass through the
orbit of a group of meteors 011 the
thirteenth or fourteenth of November,
with a resulting meteoric shower, ac
cording to Professor S. D. Townley
of the astronomy department.
"Probably the most remarkable of
all meteoric showers," said Professor
Townley, "was that which appeared
on the early morning of November 12,
1833. The number that fell during the
five or six hours which the shower
, lasted was estimated at fully 250,000.
A competent observer declared that
'he never saw snowflakes in a storm
thicker than the meteors in the sky
at some moments.' "
Thirty-Three-Year Periods
"After the first shower in 1833, there
was no brilliant display until Novem
ber in 18G6, when the meteors again
appeared in large numbers." Profes
sor Townley added: "Astronomers all
over the world made preparations for
their reappearance in 1899, but the
phenomenon did not occur and scien
tists have been watching for it ever
since. Although the thirty-three-year
period at which the showers are sup
posed to recur ends in 1932, nobody
knows when it will happen again.
"There was considerable excite
ment on the campus last November
and numerous meteors were seen, but
there was no such display as was
recorded at the earlier date. It is in
the range of possibility that this year
will mark the return of the brilliant
showers, but there is no certainty of
it," pointed out Dr. Townley.
