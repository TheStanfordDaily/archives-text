# FINE ACTING, EXTRAORDINARY TECHNIQUE AND NOVEL PHOTOGRAPHY ARE IN FRENCH FILM
## 
### 
Probably the most unusual film
which has ever been shown on the
campus, "The Passion of Joan of
Arc," a French film in which extreme
ly unique technique is seen, will be
given in the Assembly Hall on Thurs
day evening at 8 o'clock. The fine
acting of Mile. Maria Falconetti, in
the part of Joan, and the directiug of
Carl Dreyer, of the Societe Generale
des Films, make this picture totally
different from American films.
Chiefly through the technique of
close-ups, "The Passion of Joan of
Arc" portrays the last six hours of
the life of the Saint, starting with her
trial in the ecclesiastical court, and
ending with her burning. There is no
action, there are no lively captions;
but the eloquent facial expressions of
Mile. Falconetti, her eyes, her tears,
her lips, her gestures—all of these
make each close-up of Joan a portrait
of human suffering or of human ex
altation.
That "The Passion of Joan of Arc"
is "slow" might be the concliisicn
reached from the knowledge that the
burning of the Maid of Orleans takes
GOO feet of film, did not the brilliant
performance of Falconetti make it
more moving and more beautiful than
dozens of talkies which claim to be

masterpieces. While it takes several
seconds for her to answer "yes" or
"no" to one of the bishop's questions,
the emotional struggle depicted on
her face completely overcomes the
element of time.
A curious technique, also, is dis
played in this passion film. Dreyer,
the director, has used the very effec
tive device of fantastic angles
throughout almost the whole picture.
Seldom does he show Joan or any of
the judges from the usual straight
forward, level angle of photography.
Instead, the psychological effect of
a judge, a soldier, or a cocconer, or
Joan is marvelously portrayed by
weird views showing all chin in one
case, all nose in another, and so on.
This is something quite new in movie
technique, and something worth at
tention.
"The Passion of Joan of Arc," which
was suppressed in England and later
judged to be one of the four greatest
films of all time by the American
National Board of Review, is being
shown here Thursday by the dramatic
council and will not be seen in any
commercial house in the future. Tick
ets are on sale for seventy-five cents
at the A.S.S.U. office and at Sherman,

weird views showing all chin in one
case, all nose in another, and so on.
This is something quite new in movie
technique, and something worth at
tention.
"The Passion of Joan of Arc," which
was suppressed in England and later
judged to be one of the four greatest
films of all time by the American
National Board of Review, is being
shown here Thursday by the dramatic
council and will not be seen in any
commercial house in the future. Tick
ets are on sale for seventy-five cents
at the A.S.S.U. office and at Sherman,
Clay & Company in Palo Alto.
Probably the most unusual film
which has ever been shown on the
campus, "The Passion of Joan of
Arc," a French film in which extreme
ly unique technique is seen, will be
given in the Assembly Hall on Thurs
day evening at 8 o'clock. The fine
acting of Mile. Maria Falconetti, in
the part of Joan, and the directiug of
Carl Dreyer, of the Societe Generale
des Films, make this picture totally
different from American films.
Chiefly through the technique of
close-ups, "The Passion of Joan of
Arc" portrays the last six hours of
the life of the Saint, starting with her
trial in the ecclesiastical court, and
ending with her burning. There is no
action, there are no lively captions;
but the eloquent facial expressions of
Mile. Falconetti, her eyes, her tears,
her lips, her gestures—all of these
make each close-up of Joan a portrait
of human suffering or of human ex
altation.
That "The Passion of Joan of Arc"
is "slow" might be the concliisicn
reached from the knowledge that the
burning of the Maid of Orleans takes
GOO feet of film, did not the brilliant
performance of Falconetti make it
more moving and more beautiful than
dozens of talkies which claim to be

masterpieces. While it takes several
seconds for her to answer "yes" or
"no" to one of the bishop's questions,
the emotional struggle depicted on
her face completely overcomes the
element of time.
A curious technique, also, is dis
played in this passion film. Dreyer,
the director, has used the very effec
tive device of fantastic angles
throughout almost the whole picture.
Seldom does he show Joan or any of
the judges from the usual straight
forward, level angle of photography.
Instead, the psychological effect of
a judge, a soldier, or a cocconer, or
Joan is marvelously portrayed by
weird views showing all chin in one
case, all nose in another, and so on.

technique, and something worth at
