# 'GREECE TODAY' NEW ECONOMICS BOOK BY MEARS IS PUBLISHED
## 
### 
When Greek meets Greek in busi
ness relations, there results an eco
nomic tug of war, according to Pro
fessor Eliot G. Mears, of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business, who
writes of trade and social conditions
in a new book, "Greece Today," to be
published today by Stanford Univer
sity Press.
"The country is experiencing a tre
mendous economic revolution on ac
count of the wholesale dumping of
nearly 1,500,000 immigrants, includ
ing 50,000 Armenians, alongside of
the native population," Professor
Mears says. "Their competition Is
forcing the natives to work harder
than ever to make a living. But they,
too, are faced with a new form of
competition, for no longer can they
thrive on business dealings with
Turks and Bulgarians."
Professor Mears, who was formerly
Trade Commissioner in Athens, is
spending his sabbatical leave abroad,
accompanied by Mrs. Mears. He has
been chosen by the Carnegie Endow
ment for International Peace as Visit
ing Carnegie Professor of Interna
tional Relations during 1929-1930 to
selected universities in Syria, Austria,
Scotland, Turkey, and Greece. He
plans to visit the Far East before re
turning next year.
