# BRILLIANCE OF OXFORD DEBATE APPLAUDED BY CAPACITY HOUSE
## Satire of British Team Is Met by Stanford in Entertaining Duel 
### 
Before the largest audience the As
sembly Hall could hold, six debaters
from Oxford and Stanford universi
ties last night furnished two hours of
excellent amusement.
Touching the question, "Resolved,
That this is the best of all possible
worlds," only incidentally, the de
baters poked fun at each other, Eng
land, America, and the universe. Law-
Tence Kimpton, Robert McClintock,
and Henry Harris Jr., adopted with
facility the light satire and adroit
repartee of Oxford's Richard Aeland,
William Diplock, and Bernard Mac-
Kenna.
Stanford speakers held that this
world, while having obvious imper
fections, could not be improved upon,
and that, in fact, it had never been
developed to its fullest. In reply, the
men of Oxford maintained that the
greatest occupation of man is the im
provement of a world with many im
provable faults.

After the debate a portion of the
audience remained to vote for the win
ning team. The announced result was:
Stanford, 199; Oxford, 126.
Lawrence Kimpton, who opened the
debate, stated the Stanford conten
tion was that of the man who, treed
by a bear, admires the view.
"I would rather be in this 'ole than
crawl through others I know not ow,"
was Kimpton's reaction to the intima
tion that this is not the best of all
worlds.
Bernard MacKenna introduced the
Oxonian point of view in poking fun
at a nation which, believing that the
world cannot be improved, bans a
book, Voltaire's "Candlde," which
pricks the optimistic bubble of per
fection.
Henry Harris Jr., replied for Stan
ford with a plea to the audience's
"sales resistance." "When you listen
to the negative's high-powered sales
manship of another more perfect
world, remember your sales resist
ance!"
"Men Are Naughty"
William Diplock countered witn the
observation that "men are naughty;
there's plenty of room for improve
ment."
Robert McClintock jokingly referred
to the "reformist attitude" of the
Oxonians, and held that "this is posi
tively the best of all possible worlds
for reformers, and lots of fun for the
rest of us."
William Acland, in his speech clos
ing the debate, noticed that in a world
"with for every would-be Shearer a
thousand would-be shorn," perfection
was yet to be attained.
Rebuttal speeches of MacKenna and
McClintock admitted that the ques
tion of worldly perfection could not
be settled by debate, that it rested in
the mind of each individual of the
audience.

Robert McClintock jokingly referred
to the "reformist attitude" of the
Oxonians, and held that "this is posi
tively the best of all possible worlds
for reformers, and lots of fun for the
rest of us."
William Acland, in his speech clos
ing the debate, noticed that in a world
"with for every would-be Shearer a
thousand would-be shorn," perfection
was yet to be attained.
Rebuttal speeches of MacKenna and
McClintock admitted that the ques
tion of worldly perfection could not
be settled by debate, that it rested in
the mind of each individual of the
audience.
Before the largest audience the As
sembly Hall could hold, six debaters
from Oxford and Stanford universi
ties last night furnished two hours of
excellent amusement.
Touching the question, "Resolved,
That this is the best of all possible
worlds," only incidentally, the de
baters poked fun at each other, Eng
land, America, and the universe. Law-
Tence Kimpton, Robert McClintock,
and Henry Harris Jr., adopted with
facility the light satire and adroit
repartee of Oxford's Richard Aeland,
William Diplock, and Bernard Mac-
Kenna.
Stanford speakers held that this
world, while having obvious imper
fections, could not be improved upon,
and that, in fact, it had never been
developed to its fullest. In reply, the
men of Oxford maintained that the
greatest occupation of man is the im
provement of a world with many im
provable faults.

After the debate a portion of the
audience remained to vote for the win
ning team. The announced result was:
Stanford, 199; Oxford, 126.
Lawrence Kimpton, who opened the
debate, stated the Stanford conten
tion was that of the man who, treed
by a bear, admires the view.
"I would rather be in this 'ole than
crawl through others I know not ow,"
was Kimpton's reaction to the intima
tion that this is not the best of all
worlds.
Bernard MacKenna introduced the
Oxonian point of view in poking fun
at a nation which, believing that the
world cannot be improved, bans a
book, Voltaire's "Candlde," which
pricks the optimistic bubble of per
fection.
Henry Harris Jr., replied for Stan
ford with a plea to the audience's
"sales resistance." "When you listen
to the negative's high-powered sales
manship of another more perfect
world, remember your sales resist
ance!"
"Men Are Naughty"
William Diplock countered witn the
observation that "men are naughty;
there's plenty of room for improve
ment."

tively the best of all possible worlds
