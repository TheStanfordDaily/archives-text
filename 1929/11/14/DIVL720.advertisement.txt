The Money That Slips
Through Your Fingers
Where does the money go? It is easy enough to
account for the big sums —the automobile—the fur
coat —securities—or even the rent.
But what of the rest of it? Can you account for all
of it—or does some slip through your fingers, you
know not where? Is it possible that you have paid a
bill twice —have you been spending more than you
realize for luxuries?
Pay by check! Know where your money goes!
When it is in a checking account, you have an itemized
record of all your expenses, and the cancelled check
provides a sure receipt. A moderate amount will open
a checking account in this bank.
