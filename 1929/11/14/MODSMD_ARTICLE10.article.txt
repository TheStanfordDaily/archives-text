Dr. Harry Reynolds, head of the
Palo Alto chapter, has offered $25 to
the hall which gets the greatest num
ber of memberships in proportion to
its size. The $25 is to be used toward
the next Convalescent Home Drive,
as Reynolds does not want the Red
Cross Drive to interfere with Stan
ford's other charity.
Committeemen are still making
canvasses of the living groups, accord
ing to Bodle, chairman of the drive,
and all money which is received can
be turned into him at the A.S.S.U. of
fice Thursday and Friday from 1 to 2.
