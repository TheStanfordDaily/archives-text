# STOCKS TUMBLE FURTHER TO HIT NEW LOW LEVEL
## New York Exchange Officials Investigate Cause of Sudden Selling Pressure 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 13.
less and unremitting crushing down
of quoted values went forward with
augmented force on the stock market
today as officials of the Stock Ex
change took action to learn the source
of the destructive pressure, and un
official reassurances as to the nation's
financial stability and strength were
forthcoming from important sources
in Washington.
Again the decline was as orderly as
it was persistent, but more than 400
stocks explored low levels previously
untouched this year, and the volume
of trading for the three-hour session
swelled to 7,761,450 shares, a tolal un
surpassed in any session of like dura
tion, even exceeding the turnover of
7,184,000 shares of Oct. 7.
Government officials at Washington
see no emergency which warrants
their interference in the present stock
market situation, Dow Jones reported
in a special Washington dispatch
printed on its financial news tickers
today.
"For the time being, government of
ficials will stand by and keep in close
touch with developments. If the situa
tion develops where action is neces
sary, they very likely will step in."
