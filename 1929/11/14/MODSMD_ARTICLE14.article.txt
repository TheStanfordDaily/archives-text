# WORK ON WOMEN'S GYM TO COMMENCE WITHIN SHORT TIME
## 
### 
The new women's gymnasium, which
will be begun at the end of this quar
ter, will occupy the space of a city
block, on the ground which is now turf
hockey fields, according to the draw
ing of the building and architectural
plans now posted in the old Roble
Gym.
The University architects, Bakewell
and Brown, have designed the gym in
the same manner as the Union Build
ings, using red tile roofs and stucco
walls. The four main divisions, name
ly the dance sluilto, the gym, the
dressing rooms, and the offices, will
be built around a patio. The offices
will be in the fore part, facing Santa
Teresa street. The W.A.A. room and
faculty offices will be to the right of
the entrance, and the medical section
and Dr. Dyment's office will be to the
left.
The dance studio and gym on the
left and right sides of the patio re
spectively will be two stories in
height. An indoor archery field will
occupy the upper part of the dance
studio. A small game room, in which
it is the plan of Dr. Dyment to have
a squash court, opens off of the main
studio.
The dressing rooms are to run along
the back part of the new building. A
plan to have equipment in individual
baskets instead of lockers is now un
der consideration. The basket system
would be an innovation.
Two swimming pools, one for re
creational purposes and the other for
classwork, will be parallel to each
other and at right angles to the main
building. They are to be on the side
farthest from the Quad.
