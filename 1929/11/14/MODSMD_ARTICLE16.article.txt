# FRENCH FILM WILL BE SEEN HERE TONIGHT
## Will Show "Passion of Joan Of Arc" For Last Time In S.F. Bay Region 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
One of the four greatest films of all
time, according to the National Board
of Review, "The Passion of Joan of
Arc" will be shown here tonight in the
Assembly Ilall at 8 o'clock. The other
three of these finest pictures are "The
Birth of a Nation," "The Cabinet of
Dr. Caligari," and"The Armoured
Cruiser Poemkin," in the opinion of the
board.
Brought to America on the five hun
dredth anniversary of the event it de
picts, this French film portrays the last
six hours in the tragic life of the Maid
of Orleans. The cruel trial of Joan in
the church court of the Bishop of Beau
vais, the extortion of unwilling, false ad
missions from the peasant girl, and fi
nally the harrowing martyrdom of this
saint form the theme of "The Passion
of Joan of Arc."
Maria Falconetti
Maria Falconetti, probably the finest
French actress of today, plays the part
of Joan; and her interpretation of the
emotional, tortured girl is done chiefly
through the medium of facial expression
in close-ups. In New York, where the
picture had its premiere last March,
Mile. Falconetti's pantomime in this field
was acclaimed as a masterpiece of mo
tion picture achievement.
Besides Mile. Falconetti, the cast is
made up of other members of the Co
medie Frangaise in the parts of the ec
clesiastical judges, soldiers, and people
of the crowd. Each churchman in the
court is a typeâ€”from the greasy carnal
bishop whose animal actions so disgust
Joan, to the kindly young monk whose
gentle sympathy cheers the last moments
of her martyrdom. Each is a fine actor
and an artist of facial expression.
Tickets for tonight's showing of "The
Passion of Joan of Arc" may still be
obtained for seventy-five cents at the
A.S.S.U. office and at Sherman, Clay &
Company in Palo Alto. This film will
not be shown in any commercial house
in the country in the future, and in no
theater in this vicinity again.
