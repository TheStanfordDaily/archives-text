# MYSTERY ELEMENT GREAT SURPRISE IN '29 FOOTBALL SHOW
## 
### Marion Haste 
Oh, whoopee, whoopee!! It
has gone the "rounds" that "Flip"
Speegle and "Spike" Gould are
going to do another "act" for this
year's "Football Gaieties." But.
gentle "reader," the whole thing
is shrouded in secrecy. Aye,
there's the rub! as Aunt Fanny
used to say as she washed be
hind my ears.
(Them happy days! My, myâ€”
will they ever return?)
Well, to get back to the sub
ject as "ye editor" is awfully
"partic" about the way "we
girls" write feature stories, the
act is secret, yes. But we have
learned its title, and just a "wee
bit" of what it is about. There,
aren't you all wriggly?
It's going to be called "Old
Chinatown" or "How Love Came
to General Custer." Isn't that just
simply "intrig"? Those of you
who saw "A Radio Fiasco" four
or five times last year, whether
you liked it or not, aren't going
to get a big surprise.
Aren't they, you old secretive
Ram's Head meanies?
