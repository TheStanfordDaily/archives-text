The casts and authors of the two big
musical acts of the Football Gaieties have
been released by Ram's Head Society as
the first real revelation of what will be
presented in the Assembly Hall on the
eve of the Big Game.
One of these specialty acts is a "Revue
Act" in which song hits and dance num
bers written by members of the student
body are to be featured. "Rhythmic Gar
bage," by Neal Spaulding, is a number
which was written especially for the
Spaulding-Daniels orchestra, to be fea
tured in the show; and a new number by
Spaulding and Ted Duncan entitled
"Moonlight Lady" will also be included
in the act. Jean Jamison, who has not
been seen previously in campus produc
tions, will be heard singing "No News,
Bad News," by Jack Ross and T. Mor
gan.
Fred Ducato's "Brand New Gal" will
be used in a specialty dance by Leo Ma
tesky and Fred Pcarman; and Emeline
Nollen will sing "Won't You Explain?"
by Bob Thornton and George Starbird.
A women's chorus, which is rehearsing
under the direction of Frances Boone,
will be used in this "Revue Act."
The other big musical act in the Gaie
ties is something that appears not infre
quently in vaudeville performances but
which in this case will be made up of
a variety of campus talent which should
make it rather unique. Sets are being
constructed to give this act atmospheric
locale, and a women's chorus will be used
in this one also. Various campus per
formers are preparing novelties such as
whip stunts and lasso exhibitions. Jack
Miller will sing a special number entitled
"Cowboy Lament," by George Starbird.
