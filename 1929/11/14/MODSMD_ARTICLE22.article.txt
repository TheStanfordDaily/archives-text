"When the time comes to start
work on the Big Game bonfire the
class will be plenty pepped up and
ready to work."
This is the attitude of Stanford's
freshmen upon whom 1 tea the task
of building the pyre by which the
38th Big Game rally will be held next
Wednesday night.
Week Remains
Even though less than a week re
mains before the bonfire is scheduled
to be completed, representative mem
brs of the freshman class do not ex
press any concern over the apparent
lack of enthusiasm toward construct
ing this symbol of feeling between
the University of California and Stan
ford which will be ignitod on the eve

of the annual classic.
The babes are confident that they |
will be ready when the time comes, j
They feel that they are prevented j
from "getting steamed-up over the
bonfire because there have been too (
many other things to think about," j
such as studies.

"We aren't going to have a chance !
to lose the 'old pepper' if we're work- |
ing only three days," one freshman ,
told a Daily interviewer.
Construction of the bonfire will j
commence Monday under the supervi- j
sion of the Executive Committee. The
freshmen will have the pyre com
pleted by Wednesday night in time
for the rally, if present plans are car
ried out according to schedule.
