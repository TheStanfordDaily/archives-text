# STANFORD FACES CRUCIAL TEST IN GAME SATURDAY
## Santa Clara Is Expected to Furnish Tough Opposition For Stanford Grid Team California Plays Washington In Week-End's Important Coast Conference Game 
### Stephen Dietrich 
While California's Golden Bear
chaws on Husky meat in the most
important Conference game of the
week-end, Coach Pop Warner's big
white-jerseyed football Forty-niners
will be engaged in a crucial test on
Saturday, with Clipper Smith's Hard
hitting Santa Clarans as the testers.
Yet, although the outcome of these
two. games will largely determine the
betting odds on the Big Game, they
will be no real Indication as to the
comparative strength of the Cards
and Bears. Stanford was lucky to eke
out a close win in the rain-soaked
Seattle stadium, while Cal meets the
Washington lads on their own sun
hardened field. Then, too, Nibs Price's
outfit smeared Santa Clara easily in
an early-season game, while the Cards
will face the same team at its best.
At any rate, the latter game is
bound to be a tough battle. The home
boys will be attempting to take the
game in stride for the Cal clash next
week, and will thus be taking no un
necessary chances. There is also a
certainty of a let-down, following the
brutal reception at the hands of Bag
shaw's giants.
On the other hand, Santa Clara is
expected to play its best game of the
year. The Mission squad of late has
been considering the Cardinal tussle
as its Big Game, just as St. Mary's
holds California to be its mortal rival.
Added to this, Santa Clara's great
showing againet the Moraga team is
quite likely to give it no little amount
of confidence In Saturday's gridiron
matinee.
Santa Clara didn't display much in
the way of offense in the St. Mary's
affair, its running plays lacking punch
and its aerial attack failing to con
nect at all. However, the Broncs put
up sixty minutes of stiff defense, and
the Saints were lucky to score on a
lengthy pass.
Similar to Washington, the Broncs'
big threat is the playing of its stal
wart line. The Santa Clara forward
wall stopped St. Mary's running plays
to perfection, and Coach Smith is
banking on this same line to break
up the Cards' reverses and laterals.
Tassi, at center, and Ruffo, at guard,
are the team's two defensive stars.
The Mission backfield is not in the
best of shape for Saturday's game,
with Chris Machado out with a dislo
cated knee and A 1 Terremere on the
sidelines with a smashed shoulder.
Machado threw his limb out of joint
last Saturday, when he overdid shift
ing in the now famous Santa Clara
Alfonso Shift.
Smith still has two good men to
throw against the Cards, though, in
Herm Mettler and Guido Simoni. Met
tler is one of the outstanding punters
on the Coast. Besides sending spirals
for lengthy distances down the
greensward, he is able to place the
ball within the radius of a pin-bead.
Pop is not taking the game as a
snap, and has been working his
charges overtime in polishing up his
running attack. Yesterday afternoon
the Cards got a healthy sweat up
shoving around the charging machine
and punishing the tackling dummy,
followed by a peppy signal session.

week-end, Coach Pop Warner's big
white-jerseyed football Forty-niners
will be engaged in a crucial test on
Saturday, with Clipper Smith's Hard
hitting Santa Clarans as the testers.
Yet, although the outcome of these
two. games will largely determine the
betting odds on the Big Game, they
will be no real Indication as to the
comparative strength of the Cards
and Bears. Stanford was lucky to eke
out a close win in the rain-soaked
Seattle stadium, while Cal meets the
Washington lads on their own sun
hardened field. Then, too, Nibs Price's
outfit smeared Santa Clara easily in
an early-season game, while the Cards
will face the same team at its best.
At any rate, the latter game is
bound to be a tough battle. The home
boys will be attempting to take the
game in stride for the Cal clash next
week, and will thus be taking no un
necessary chances. There is also a
certainty of a let-down, following the
brutal reception at the hands of Bag
shaw's giants.
On the other hand, Santa Clara is
expected to play its best game of the
year. The Mission squad of late has
been considering the Cardinal tussle
as its Big Game, just as St. Mary's
holds California to be its mortal rival.
Added to this, Santa Clara's great
showing againet the Moraga team is
quite likely to give it no little amount
of confidence In Saturday's gridiron
matinee.
Santa Clara didn't display much in
the way of offense in the St. Mary's
affair, its running plays lacking punch
and its aerial attack failing to con
nect at all. However, the Broncs put
up sixty minutes of stiff defense, and
the Saints were lucky to score on a
lengthy pass.
Similar to Washington, the Broncs'
big threat is the playing of its stal
wart line. The Santa Clara forward
wall stopped St. Mary's running plays
to perfection, and Coach Smith is
banking on this same line to break
up the Cards' reverses and laterals.
Tassi, at center, and Ruffo, at guard,
are the team's two defensive stars.
The Mission backfield is not in the
best of shape for Saturday's game,
with Chris Machado out with a dislo
cated knee and A 1 Terremere on the
sidelines with a smashed shoulder.
Machado threw his limb out of joint
last Saturday, when he overdid shift
ing in the now famous Santa Clara
Alfonso Shift.
Smith still has two good men to
throw against the Cards, though, in
Herm Mettler and Guido Simoni. Met
tler is one of the outstanding punters
on the Coast. Besides sending spirals
for lengthy distances down the
greensward, he is able to place the
ball within the radius of a pin-bead.
Pop is not taking the game as a
snap, and has been working his
charges overtime in polishing up his
running attack. Yesterday afternoon
the Cards got a healthy sweat up
shoving around the charging machine
and punishing the tackling dummy,
followed by a peppy signal session.

chaws on Husky meat in the most
