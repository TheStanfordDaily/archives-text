# THE 						EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE RESOLVES
## 
### 
Affairs have come to a pretty pass 011 the Farm this year.
First the freshmen and sophomores got out and slapped wrists when
they formerly gargled mud under pressure. Some U.S.C. rooters were
placed one section away from the Cardinal rooting section and nothing
happened, as though the game were another good-will assembly. Then
the Roble Bridge and the romantic nights and knights were sacrificed for
the onslaught of the Mechanical Age.
The Daily minions chafed hot under the collar at the sophisticated
termites who were eating the very heart out of the school spirit and sat
down and banged a few typewriters around. The Daily tried to get
someone mad. It carried editorials on "What Ails the Rally Committee"
and even tried to sing a few songs to revive the Stanford Spirit.
Now comes the Executive Committee to the rescue with an eighty
word resolution designed to act as a pulmotor to inflate the gasping
Stanford Spirit. Today the rescue session will be held from 12 to 12:30
o'clock at the Engineering Corner because the Executive Committee willed
it so. Every Cardinal supporter will be there for the Executive Committee
went on record as resolving "that the Executive Committee ask each and
every member of the student body to be present."
Official Washington was shocked when Congress awoke and started
investigating the "whoopee parties" of several of its members. Prohibi
tion had been in effect since 1919. Affairs must be in a pathetic condition
here for even the Executive Committee to parallel the acts of the Nation's
noblemen and take such a definite stand.
The Daily has been deceived. The Executive Committee has hurled
its challenges in a heroic manner; the gauntlet has been thrown down.
There IS Cardinal blood flowing through the veins of the Executive
Committee!
