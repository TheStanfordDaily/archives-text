Congratulations are in order for the three Stanford men who met
Oxford University in debate Tuesday night and to the man who coached
the team. For contrary to the expectations of the capacity audience, Stan
ford's speakers were the wittiest on the rostrum, and carried more con
viction in their talks.
Not that the Oxonians' efforts are to be deprecated. They gave very
interesting speeches punctuated with wit, but the Stanford men had
prepared their ground better and met the Englishmen's verbal sallies
with remarks equally pithy. They played the same game and did it better
than the originators.
Lawrence Kimpton, Henry Harris, Robert McClintock, and Professor
James G. Emerson, their coach, are to be warmly commended.
