# THE 						PRESS AND ATHLETICS
## 
### 
The already famous Carnegie Foundation report on American college
athletics contains one chapter, devoted to the press and its influence,
which has received comparatively little notice amid the bright glare of the
spotlight turned 011 athletic subsidizing. Yet perhaps as much as any
other phase of the report this rather insignificant section may fairly be
used as a criterion for criticism of the athletic situation as a whole, in that
it reflects with considerable accuracy the trend of public opinion with
regard to sports.
The compilers of the report are in general quite complimentary to
the press. Figures are carefully enumerated to demonstrate that, despite
the very rapid increase in public interest in athletics during the last
decade, the best newspapers of the day have devoted, if anything, less
space to athletics in proportion to total news space than fifteen years ago.
It is undeniably true that many newspapers of a more sensational or
commercial bent have exploited the sport craze with results of question
able value to everything except their circulation. Yet there is ample
evidence to indicate that such exploitation is on the wane. Improvement
is evident in the sports policy of many of the leading dailies, and it is
interesting to note that such improvement has not proved detrimental to
circulation. Such results, we assume, must gradually convince other
publishers that the myth which they have believed is of an altogether
tenuous substance.
The power of the press as an anticipator and leader of public opinion
is self-evident. It is decidedly encouraging, consequently to learn from
the Carnegie report that the policy of overemphasizing athletics news by
many newspapers is not characteristic of the leading journals, and that in
general the situation is taking care of itself under the wise leadership of
our more prominent dailies. Much remains to be done, and it will 110
doubt be some little time before the newspapers of the country have
entirely eliminated from their pages all that is harmful to athletics. There
is no indication, however, that the situation is not well in hand, so long
as a sense of value remains in the mind of the publisher.
