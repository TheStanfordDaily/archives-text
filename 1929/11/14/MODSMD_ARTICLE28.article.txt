PORTRAITS AND REFLEC
TIONS, by Stuart Hodgson. E. P.
Dutton & Co., 1929.
Mr. Hodgson is an Englishman, and
he has his likes and his dislikes. In this
new book, so aptly named, it is hardly
difficult to determine either his nation
ality or his preferences among "great"
men.
Being an Englishman, he naturally
picks out some of his more noted coun
trymen for the greater part of his opus.
Among them are Sir Austen Chamber
lain, Lord Birkenhead, Lloyd George,
and King George V as subjects for dis
section. But when the author turns his
lance toward America, selecting Henry
Ford and Alfred Emanuel Smith for
observation, the American reader will do
one of two things: He will grin inter
nally at Mr. Hodgson's sweetly per
fumed causticity, or he will get mad and
throw the book out of the window.
The choice of subjects is certainly no
ordinary one. It is hard to remember
off-hand any other biographer who lists
in his table of contents premiers, prime
ministers, actors, bankers, an interna
tional chess champion, a defeated presi
dential candidate, an author, an automo
bile manufacturer, gentlemen of the
clergy, and an honest-to-God king.
One should get this book and park it
on the shelf if only to quote it in History
17 quizzes. For example:
King George—"Obviously it would be
grotesque to speak of him as a working
man's King. But I think it is true that
he comes nearer to that conception than
anyone who has ever sat on the British
throne."
Lloyd George—"His course may be
erratic, and his colour variable: the eyes
of all are still upon him; and if the
clouds of danger gathered again, as in
the war time, about this country there
is no doubt whose name would be on all
men's lips."
Henry Ford—"But Mr. Ford was not
a very great man. He was only an hon
est, rather simple-minded American citi
zen. He was blinded, surely not unnat
urally, by his unheard-of success, and led
to believe and to proclaim that he had
found the philosopher's stone in indus
try."
And A1 Smith—"A song made Mr.
Smith: an accent ruined him. ... To the
average American Mr. Hoover's accent

is the accent of a gentleman, and Mr.
Smith's the accent of the New York
gutter. It was a fatal contrast in a demo
cratic country."

erratic, and his colour variable: the eyes
of all are still upon him; and if the
clouds of danger gathered again, as in
the war time, about this country there
is no doubt whose name would be on all
men's lips."
Henry Ford—"But Mr. Ford was not
a very great man. He was only an hon
est, rather simple-minded American citi
zen. He was blinded, surely not unnat
urally, by his unheard-of success, and led
to believe and to proclaim that he had
found the philosopher's stone in indus
try."
And A1 Smith—"A song made Mr.
Smith: an accent ruined him. ... To the
average American Mr. Hoover's accent

is the accent of a gentleman, and Mr.
Smith's the accent of the New York
gutter. It was a fatal contrast in a demo
cratic country."

PORTRAITS AND REFLEC
TIONS, by Stuart Hodgson. E. P.
Dutton & Co., 1929.
Mr. Hodgson is an Englishman, and
he has his likes and his dislikes. In this
new book, so aptly named, it is hardly
difficult to determine either his nation
ality or his preferences among "great"
men.
Being an Englishman, he naturally
picks out some of his more noted coun
trymen for the greater part of his opus.
Among them are Sir Austen Chamber
lain, Lord Birkenhead, Lloyd George,
and King George V as subjects for dis
section. But when the author turns his
lance toward America, selecting Henry
Ford and Alfred Emanuel Smith for
observation, the American reader will do
one of two things: He will grin inter
nally at Mr. Hodgson's sweetly per
fumed causticity, or he will get mad and
throw the book out of the window.
The choice of subjects is certainly no
ordinary one. It is hard to remember
off-hand any other biographer who lists
in his table of contents premiers, prime
ministers, actors, bankers, an interna
tional chess champion, a defeated presi
dential candidate, an author, an automo
bile manufacturer, gentlemen of the
clergy, and an honest-to-God king.
One should get this book and park it
on the shelf if only to quote it in History
17 quizzes. For example:
King George—"Obviously it would be
grotesque to speak of him as a working
man's King. But I think it is true that
he comes nearer to that conception than
anyone who has ever sat on the British
throne."
Lloyd George—"His course may be
erratic, and his colour variable: the eyes
of all are still upon him; and if the
clouds of danger gathered again, as in
the war time, about this country there
is no doubt whose name would be on all
men's lips."
