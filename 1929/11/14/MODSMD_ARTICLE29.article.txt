THIEVES' NIGHTS, by Harry Ste
phen Keeler. E. P. Dutton & Co.,
1929.
This is the kind of book, we would
suggest, that you pick up the night be
fore a biology mid-quarter. You'll miss
your regular bedtime by several hours
and sleep through the ex. Then you'll
spend the rest of the morning in kick
ing yourself hither and yon about the
campus—which would happen anyhow,
especially if you did take the biology
thing.
This, believe it or not, is a mystery
story without a detective. But it has
mysterious disappearances, disguises, hid
den safes, erratic millionaires, crooks
aplenty—in fact, everything but homicidal
young ladies tripping about in galoshes.
Ward Sharlow, an impoverished young
Briton, is picked up by John Atwood,
the millionaire, to take the role of the
late Atwood Jr. for a mere two weeks.
Payment, ten thousand cash. Two days
after Sharlow steps into his new job,
Atwood Sr. departs from this earth, and
the young man finds himself in a position
that he can't vacate. Believe this, and
the rest of the story is easy.
Papa Atwood's niece—beautiful, of
course—enters the scene, and now Shar
low begins to like his job. But then
claimants for the vast Atwood estate ap
pear, and the temporary heir finds him
self reclining on dynamite.
By the time the reader has discovered
what the mystery actually is, the dis
closures are already made—and there
you are.
Scattered through the book are stories
within-stories-within-stories ad infinitum
—very confusing, but very good stories.
And then there's DeLancey, King of
Thieves. He doesn't do an awful lot, but
his reputation keeps the story alive and
fairly boosts it into the upper stratum
of good crook stories.
If there are any week points, they
would be the horrible puns in the last
chapter, the rather slender thread on
which the stories-within-stories are held
together, and the atrocious love-making
of Ward Sharlow. The last is positively
terrible.

of Ward Sharlow. The last is positively
terrible.
THIEVES' NIGHTS, by Harry Ste
phen Keeler. E. P. Dutton & Co.,
1929.
This is the kind of book, we would
suggest, that you pick up the night be
fore a biology mid-quarter. You'll miss
your regular bedtime by several hours
and sleep through the ex. Then you'll
spend the rest of the morning in kick
ing yourself hither and yon about the
campus—which would happen anyhow,
especially if you did take the biology
thing.
This, believe it or not, is a mystery
story without a detective. But it has
mysterious disappearances, disguises, hid
den safes, erratic millionaires, crooks
aplenty—in fact, everything but homicidal
young ladies tripping about in galoshes.
Ward Sharlow, an impoverished young
Briton, is picked up by John Atwood,
the millionaire, to take the role of the
late Atwood Jr. for a mere two weeks.
Payment, ten thousand cash. Two days
after Sharlow steps into his new job,
Atwood Sr. departs from this earth, and
the young man finds himself in a position
that he can't vacate. Believe this, and
the rest of the story is easy.
Papa Atwood's niece—beautiful, of
course—enters the scene, and now Shar
low begins to like his job. But then
claimants for the vast Atwood estate ap
pear, and the temporary heir finds him
self reclining on dynamite.
By the time the reader has discovered
what the mystery actually is, the dis
closures are already made—and there
you are.
Scattered through the book are stories
within-stories-within-stories ad infinitum
—very confusing, but very good stories.
And then there's DeLancey, King of
Thieves. He doesn't do an awful lot, but
his reputation keeps the story alive and
fairly boosts it into the upper stratum
of good crook stories.
If there are any week points, they
would be the horrible puns in the last
chapter, the rather slender thread on
which the stories-within-stories are held
together, and the atrocious love-making
of Ward Sharlow. The last is positively
terrible.
