## WANTS AN OUTLET 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The same old gag again! Where is
your school spirit? For the benefit of
those who do not know, I shall say this
much: that we all have just as much
school spirit as those who think we have
none.
Where is it then ? Why don't you show
us some? And we c,,i turn around and
ask you, How ?
Do you want us to get together out on
a street corncr and start yelling, a mob
of girls included? Most charming, yes.
What else are we going to do ? When I
came to the University at the beginning
of this quarter, I was full of this spirit,
and I am now too. But what am I going
to do about it anyway? I went to the
show last night and laughed some of it
off. What I am driving at is just this:

Give Us an Outlet! Give us a way to
express our spirit and you'll get it. At
the assembly next' Thursday noon you
people who wonder where it all is will
find that it is still in us and still good
too. And it will continue to be good.
We will express it wherever we get a
chance, but the trouble is that the chances
are too few. When there is a rally you
hear the spirit let loose.
Then give us a rally or two, and we
will show you our spirit; otherwise
please don't expect us to yell on the
street corner. Now if you give us this
rally, and I find that I am wrong, which
I am sure that I will not be, I at least,
and the ones who are with me on this
question, will be there to yell for our
team.
I thank you.
