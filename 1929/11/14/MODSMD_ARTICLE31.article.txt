# ARE THEY JOKING?

The Editor, Sir:
We're mighty glad to note in your
splendid paper that our Executive Com
mittee has decided to take some red
blooded action in the matter of "pep
ping up" student spirit.
Something constructive like this has
been lacking for a long time; now at
last our officers have "come to life" and
definitely "thrown the gage." Now it
is for everyone to realize that "the die
is cast." Stanford students have a chal
lenge to meet!
Just a suggestion: why can't the girls
of the 500 wear red dresses at the rally

this noon and the boys red ties and
rooters' hats?
None of this "college cynicism" for
us! We just guess not! Let's get out
there and back the old team to the limit.
We want to make a supreme effort "to
revive the former Stanford spirit which
has been decidedly lacking during the
past few weeks."
And just to show that we mean it,
we're going to sign our names. We don't
care. We just want fight! Fight!
FIGHT! FIGHT!
Signed: Temp Peck
