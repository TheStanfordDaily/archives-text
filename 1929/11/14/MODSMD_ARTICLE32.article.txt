# ANOTHER REASON FOR A NEW THEATRE

The Editor, Sir:
How come?
How is it that a few people can come
late to an Oxford-Stanford debate, stand
outside the windows at the west end of
the front rows, open said windows, and
grin gleefully at the cutting draft that
blew on more than two dozen person.'
for a solid two hours?
These persons paid no heed to the re
quests of the occupants of the front
rows to close the windows and either
come inside or beat it .They could have

come in and sat or stood along the wall,
as a few speakers inside did. I don't
know if the draft reached the speakers
or not, but it was extremely cold as it
swept over the first three rows. Occu
pants thereof were too considerate of
the speakers to cause a disturbance by
getting up and closing the windows on
the noses of the iookers-in.
Like the dog in the manger, only these
were out of the manger, they would
neither come in where it was warm nor
allow those in the front rows to keep
warm.
