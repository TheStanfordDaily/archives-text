# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD...
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF NOVEMBER 14, 1904

An editorial bitterly attacked the
previous custom of sending away to
post-season football games only the
players who wished to go and who
could afford the time. Such a practice,
claimed the editor, has caused in
ferior teams to represent Stanfoid in
the games. The editorial advocated
that either a full-strength team meet
the University of Colorado on Thanks
giving Day or else no team at all.
