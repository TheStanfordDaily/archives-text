MIND OVER MATTER
In this year of smashing gridiron
upsots that has witnessed the spec
tacle of the mouse frequently kicking
the lion all over the stadium, it might
not be amiss to consider anew that
hackneyed phrase which, sports crit
ics have come to realize, plays an im
portant part in victory and defeat;
namely, the proper mental attitude.
Because, perhaps, it is so in
tangible when disccussed with
man-for-man comparisons and the
like, this question of a team's
psychological state of mind be
fore a game has been pooh-poohed
by the general public. But events
of this year seem to have proved
conclusively that an eleven can
not be keyed to a pitch of terrific
tension one week and be expected
to reach similar mental heights
seven days later.
The outstanding axample at hand
is, of course, Southern California. No
one who saw the Trojans beat Stan
ford here last month doubted that
they were a great team that day. Stan
ford looked bad at times, because
Howard Jones' men made them look
bad by their superiority. Pointed as
they were for the Cardinals, the Tro
jans' let-down the following week
was inevitable.
With all due credit to Califor
nia's Golden Bears, can anyone
canceive the smooth-working Tro
jan team of October 26 being one
touchdown worse than any team
in the nation? Hardly; yet a
scant week later, they bowed to
California by a greater margin
than that. The reason was lack of
the proper mental attitude —a
combination of underestimating
the Bears' power and inability to
become "hopped up" over the con
test. Were the two teams to meet
again tomorrow, the smart money
would again be on U.S.C.
Stanford, too, has felt the effects of
pointing for the Trojans, and only
slowly are they rising from the slough
of despondency, as their clashes with
California Tech and Washington bear
evidence. And because Santa Clara
cannot possibly reach the state of
tension they attained for their annual
"big game" with St. Mary's on Sun
day, the Cards may have an easier
time with the Broncos this Saturday
than might otherwise have been ex
pected.
Those who place no faith in this
theory quote the case of Notre Dame
to refute the argument. Rockne's
Ramblers, they say, tackle a tough
assignment every week without a let
up durnig the season. However, a
closer inspection of the Notre Dame
record this year may alter that view.
They have a great team, true; and
already Indiana, Wisconsin, Navy,
Georgia Tech, Carnegie Tech, and
Drake have fallen before them. But
Indiana and Wisconsin both hold down
low rungs in the ladder of Big Ten
competition, Navy has been beaten by
Penn and West Virginia, Georgia
Tech has only a fair team this year
and Drake is perhaps equal to the
football strength of Occidental. Car
negie Tech alone is one of the strong
er teams, and the Ramblers were hard
pressed to beat them. Can anyone say
that the Wisconsins, Indianas, Drakes,
etc., have better teams than Oregon,
Oregon State, Santa Clara, or Wash
ington State, whom Stanford, Cali
fornia, and Southern California take
rogularly without drawing a deep
broath ?
But rest assured that both Cards
and Bears will have the proper
mental attitude when the Big
Game rolls around. The tradition
al worth of the contest would be
sufficient to guarantee this, but
in addition, Stanford simply must
win to salvage her season, and
'California must win to attain the
-national honors she sees dangling
-within her reach. As usual, it will
tie considerable ball gamel

time with the Broncos this Saturday
than might otherwise have been ex

Those who place no faith in this
theory quote the case of Notre Dame
to refute the argument. Rockne's
Ramblers, they say, tackle a tough
assignment every week without a let
up durnig the season. However, a
closer inspection of the Notre Dame
record this year may alter that view.
They have a great team, true; and
already Indiana, Wisconsin, Navy,
Georgia Tech, Carnegie Tech, and
Drake have fallen before them. But
Indiana and Wisconsin both hold down
low rungs in the ladder of Big Ten
competition, Navy has been beaten by
Penn and West Virginia, Georgia
Tech has only a fair team this year
and Drake is perhaps equal to the
football strength of Occidental. Car
negie Tech alone is one of the strong
er teams, and the Ramblers were hard
pressed to beat them. Can anyone say
that the Wisconsins, Indianas, Drakes,
etc., have better teams than Oregon,
Oregon State, Santa Clara, or Wash
ington State, whom Stanford, Cali
fornia, and Southern California take
rogularly without drawing a deep
broath ?
But rest assured that both Cards
and Bears will have the proper
mental attitude when the Big

MIND OVER MATTER
In this year of smashing gridiron
upsots that has witnessed the spec
tacle of the mouse frequently kicking
the lion all over the stadium, it might
not be amiss to consider anew that
hackneyed phrase which, sports crit
ics have come to realize, plays an im
portant part in victory and defeat;
namely, the proper mental attitude.
Because, perhaps, it is so in
tangible when disccussed with
man-for-man comparisons and the
like, this question of a team's
psychological state of mind be
fore a game has been pooh-poohed
by the general public. But events
of this year seem to have proved
conclusively that an eleven can
not be keyed to a pitch of terrific
tension one week and be expected
to reach similar mental heights
seven days later.
The outstanding axample at hand
is, of course, Southern California. No
one who saw the Trojans beat Stan
ford here last month doubted that
they were a great team that day. Stan
ford looked bad at times, because
Howard Jones' men made them look
bad by their superiority. Pointed as
they were for the Cardinals, the Tro
jans' let-down the following week
was inevitable.
With all due credit to Califor
nia's Golden Bears, can anyone
canceive the smooth-working Tro
jan team of October 26 being one
touchdown worse than any team
in the nation? Hardly; yet a
scant week later, they bowed to
California by a greater margin
than that. The reason was lack of
the proper mental attitude —a
combination of underestimating
the Bears' power and inability to
become "hopped up" over the con
test. Were the two teams to meet
again tomorrow, the smart money
would again be on U.S.C.
Stanford, too, has felt the effects of
pointing for the Trojans, and only
slowly are they rising from the slough
of despondency, as their clashes with
California Tech and Washington bear
evidence. And because Santa Clara
cannot possibly reach the state of
tension they attained for their annual
"big game" with St. Mary's on Sun
day, the Cards may have an easier
time with the Broncos this Saturday
than might otherwise have been ex
pected.
