# TROJANS TO CLASH WITH NOTRE DAME IN WEEK'S BIG TILT
## Bagshaw Leads Washington Against Bears in Last Conference Game 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13 (#>).—Bent
on squaring accounts with Notre Dame's
gridsters, the University of Southern
California football squad was en route
to Chicago today, where Saturday on
Soldier Field the Trojans will clash with
Coach Knute Rockne's Ramblers in the
outstanding intersectional conflict of the
week.
The U.S.C. hopes were dimmed some
what, however, for when Coach Howard
Jones left with thirty-eight of his pro
teges at 6 p.m. yesterday by spccial train,
Harry Edelson, hard-hitting inside half
back, was left in a hospital here, suffer
ing from influenza.
Should the Trojan first string backfield
star recover sufficiently by Friday, he
will leave by airplane with Dr. Harold
Van Metre to take his place in the start
ing lineup. Otherwise Marger Apsit, his
substitute, will hold down the assignment.
With Edelson out, Coach Jones took
Heinie Becker, a halfback, along as a
possible third substitute.
While the men of Troy will seek to
duplicate last year's triumph and thereby
even the percentage of games won and
lost at two-all, they are also anxious to
erase the 7 to 6 defeat handed them be
fore Chicago fans by the Irish two sea
sons ago.
The training schedule calls for only
one practice en route, but at every day
stop of any length Coach Jones has de
cided that the men shall limber up their
muscles to prevent train stiffness. The
team will take a good workout at Mc-
Pherson, Kansas, Thursday afternoon,
and will conclude its preparation at Chi
cago Friday morning with a short snappy
drill scheduled to be held at Stagg Field.
