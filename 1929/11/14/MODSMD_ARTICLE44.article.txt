### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 13 (JP). — Coach
Nibs Price and his first-string regulars
were hard at work today preparing for
a strenuous battle Saturday against the
University of Washington Huskies. All
doubts that the Bears would use their
varsity team against the invading north
erners were removed when Coach Price
made it known that he considered the
Washington squad a dangerous threat
and that all efforts would be put forth
to prevent the visitors from going home
the victors.
In practice sessions, Eisan, Lom, Grif
fiths, and Gill were playing in the back
field, with Norton, Beckett, Pitto, Eick
meyer, Schwarz, Timmerman and Thorn
ton in the forward wall. Captain Riegels,
Stanley Barr, and Fred Schlicting all
were out with injuries.
Reports from the north were that the
Huskies expected to be at full strength

and Gold warriors went through a snappy
workout yesterday, stimulated by their
showing against Stanford last Saturday
and their victory over the College of
Puget Sound the week before. Coach
Bagshaw expected to take thirty-three
men with him.
