# CHAMP CARD DIVERS START WORKING FOR '30 AQUATIC SEASON
##

Plunging into the depths of Stan
ford's new diving tank, splashing out,
plunging again . . .
Before a mere handful of chance
passersby, two of the foremost fancy
divers of the United States are daily
practicing at Encina pool. "Pete" Des
jardins, Olympic diving star, and Ed
Throndson, rated by the Swimming
Guide as one of the ten best Ameri
can intercollegiate divers, are the per
formers.
Desjardins and Throndson are
smoothing and polishing their tech
nique in preparation for the coming
water sports season, when they will
be the mainstays of Stanford's
strength in the diving field. Herb
Marsh, who ably assisted Throndson
last year, is not registered in the
University this quarter, but will prob
ably be back next year.
Last year Throndson was never de
feated in his diving for Stanford. He
won over stiff competition from North
western, Oregon, and California, as
well as placing first in the Minor
Sports Carnival last spring.
Those who saw Throndson's per
formance in the Northwestern meet
still remember his thrilling defeat of
Wally Colbath, captain of the Purple
team and 1928 national intercollegiate
diving champion. Throndson's present
practice is concentrated in the diffi
cult one-and-a-half gainer dive, in
which he is acquiring an almost ma
chine-like precision.
Desjardins was national springboard
and platform diving champion in 1926,
1927, and 1928; in each of the three
previous years he placed second in
the national competition. In 1924 he
was second in Olympic springboard
and tower diving, and in 1928 placed
above all other competitors in the
same events.
