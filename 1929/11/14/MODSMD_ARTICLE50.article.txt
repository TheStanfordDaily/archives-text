# CARD SOCCER TEAM WORKS ON OFFENSE FOR BEAR CONTEST
## Smith Concentrates on Play Of Forwards; Eberhart, Mujica May Star 
### Ted DeMotte 
With a defense that is almost per
fect, the Cardinal soccer team is
working this week to perfect a
smooth-running offense for the second
game of the annual series with the
California Bears, to be played at
Berkeley at 1 o'clock Saturday. The
first game ended in a scoreless tie,
with honors about even on all depart
ments of the game.
Assistant Coach Ward Smith, who
has charge of the soccer squad in the
absence of Coach Harry Maloney, has
been conecntrating on the work of the
forward line, and especially on the
passing combination of Mujica and
Eberhart. This pair of fast little for
wards have always been the main
springs of the Stanford offense, and
with a little polish on their work to
gether, they should do plenty to the
Boars.
Last Saturday's game was a mas
terful exhibition of defense on the
part of both teams. Several seemingly
sure scoring attacks were broken up
on both sides by some of the prettiest
defensive play seen here for some
time. Wittausch was outstanding at
kicking, while Captain Mayer and
Burns starred also on defense.
The offense was ragged in spots,
with the Stanford forwards experienc
ing difficulty at keeping possession of
the ball in California territory. Assist
ant Coach Smith hopes that all the
weaknesses in offense will be iruned
out in the stiff scrimmages through
which he is putting his men this
week.
