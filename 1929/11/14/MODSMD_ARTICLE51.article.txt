# MINOR SPORTS OFFER THREE ADVANTAGES IS OPINION OF MALONEY
## 
### 
"The purpose of minor sports is three
fold : to afford competition for many, to
give a man an opportunity to work up in
sports, and lastly to oiler a chance for a
variety of competition," stated Harry
Maloney, head of minor sports, in ex
plaining the position of minor sports at
Stanford.
"The primary purpose of minor sports
is to afford intercollegiate competition
for men not qualified for a major sport,
and to give such men an opportunity to
enjoy the thrill of team play and the joy
of athletic activity. Minor sports are
conducted and have been conducted for
the past twenty-one years under my su
pervision with but one idea in mind—to
afford athletics for all, in place of ath
letics for a few.
"A variety of competition is made pos
sible by the minor sport program. Men
competing in a major sport one quarter
may find much to interest them in a
minor sport taught another quarter, and
then, too, the number of sports available
at Stanford assures the student body of
competition in some branch of athletics
every season of the year.
"Lastly, minor sports afford an oppor
tunity for a man to build himself up
physically to the point where he may
compete in a major sport. Some of the
best men in major sports at Stanford
have started with minor sport competi
tion and have risen to the heights because
of the sound basis secured in the lesser
sport.
