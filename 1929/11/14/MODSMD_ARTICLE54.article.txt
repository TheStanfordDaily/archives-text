## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 13. (/P)â€”Plans
for the annual Rose Bowl football
game at Pasadena January 1, 1930, are
subject to revision, but indications
now are that the scream of a Panther
and growl of a Bear will echo through
the famous bowl.
The Pittsburgh Panther seems to
be enjoying perfect health and Jock
Sutherland's powerful machine is in
line for the nomination as the repre
sentative of the East in the annual
clash of the sections.
