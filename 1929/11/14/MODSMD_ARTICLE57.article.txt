drid, Ignaz Friedman, famous Polish
pianist who will appear with the San
Francisco Symphony on the first of the
A.S.S.U. concerts December 4, received
enthusiastic praise from the Spanish crit
ics.
Upon receiving the "invitation by com
mand," Friedman prepared a special pro
gram for the royal family and their
suite. The young prince Don Jaime was
in the audience. This was the first musi
cal program which the deaf prince had
been able to enjoy; for it was soon after
the earliest successful attempts partially
to restore his hearing. The fact that he
apparently was able to appreciate the
concert has given strength to the hopes
of the Spanish people for the ultimate
recovery of their prince.
Friedman will display the feats of
technique which have earned him an in
ternational reputation, at a concert in
San Francisco and again the following
week in his concert on this campus. The
pianist is making his Pacific Coast debut
this winter.
Born at Podgorre, Poland, in 1882,
Friedman achieved at a comparatively
youthful age a rank with his mighty
compatriots, Paderewski, de Pachmann,
and Hofmann. It was not, however, un
til after a long period spent in studying
and working with the famous Letchetizky
and in composing and editing various
musical compositions, that he came to
America in January, 1921. In the past
four years he has been touring the East,
South, and Middle West extensively, and
Stanford will be one of the places to
have the opportunity of hearing him on
his first trip to the far West.
