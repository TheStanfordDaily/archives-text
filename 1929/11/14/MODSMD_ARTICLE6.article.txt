# Undertanding Tone Is Not A Necessity For Enjoyment Says Allen
## 
### 
"Understanding tone should not pre
vent one from enjoying it," said Warren
D. Allen, University organist, last night
in his lecture on "Melodies and Instru
ments" in the Little Theater. This was
the second lecture in his series on the
Elements of Music.
Fundamental tones are contained in
overtones and the instrumental families
show a very great difference in this col
oring. In the wind instruments, the flute
is one of the most interesting. It is
unique in material and tone, and has the
fewest number of overtones. This qual
ity of pure melody is perhaps the reason
why snakes are so susceptible to flute
players.
The modern piano contains both har
mony and melody and has great scope
for versatility although it is limited by
the inability to sustain a prolonged tone,
believes Allen. The piano comes from
the dulcimer, which was played by ham
mers instead of by the use of a keyboard.
Today our music is mainly instrumen
tal but before Bach it was almost entirely
vocal. The violin most closely resembles
the voice and can be called a personal in
strument. The organ on the other hand
is most impersonal.
Melodies for and individual colors of
some of the various instruments were il
lustrated during the talk. Eleanor Page,
Robert Lippmann, and Otto Will played
a selection from Rimsky-Korsakov's
"Scheherazade" on the oboe, clarinet, and
flute. Professor A. B. Whitaker played
a selection on the French horn; Albert
Breuer on the trumpet; Frank Copley on
the 'cello; and Elizabeth Peirce on the
violin. Allen accompanied the selections.
