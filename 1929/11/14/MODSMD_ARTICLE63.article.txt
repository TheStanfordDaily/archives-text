# INCREASE OF CHINESE AT STANFORD SHOWS POPULARITY OF UNIVERSITY

"Everybody in China admires Stan
ford and considers it one of the very
best schools in the United States,"
stated F. G. Wang, graduate student
in education, when interviewed re
cently.
"This University's popularity with
Chinese students is apparent by their
increased numbers here. For many
years there were only 15 or 20 Chi
nese students at Stanford; last year
there were about 40, and this year
there are over GO. Some go east to
school but often they transfer to Stan
ford before graduation. The climate
and general atmosphere of the place
please us. The prestige of an educa
tion here is also no small matter.
From Tsing Hua
"About one-half of the Chinese stu
dents at Stanford come from Tsing
Hua college which was founded espe
cially to train Chinese students to
study in America. Entrance require
ments to Tsing Hua are very strict
and only a small number of those
that apply for admission are permit
ted to enter. At the end of every year
those who have failed to maintain a
high degree of excellence are disquali
fied for graduation and dismissed from
the institution. Consequently only a
small per cent manage to graduate.
The period of preparation for Ameri

can study is from six to eight years
and graduation carries the privilege
of coming to the States where gradu
ates may enroll as juniors.
Language Difficulty
"Subjects taught at Tsing Hua are
nearly the same as lower division
work in the United States. Students
coming to American universities from
provincial colleges, private institu
tions, or well-to-do families are usu
ally handicapped because of a lan
guage difficulty," Wang declared.
"They are slow to take lecture notes,
slow to write examinations, slow to
phrase answers to questions which
they know well."
About half of the Chinese students
at Stanford have come here by means
of the Boxer indemnity fund which
sends 40 students yearly to America
for study. Upon their return to China
they are often established in respon
sible positions in accordance with the
oriental ideal of democracy. Boxer in
demnity scholarships are awarded
automatically to graduates of Tsing
Hua and to others through competi
tive examinations. The United States
government haB remitted about $18,-
000,000 to the China Foundation for
the Promotion of Education and Cul
ture, a board composed of nine Chi
nese and five Americans, which super
vises this international scholarship
plan.
