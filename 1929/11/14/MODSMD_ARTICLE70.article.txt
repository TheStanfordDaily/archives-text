# FROSH HOCKEY SQUAD DOWNS SENIOR TEAM IN HARD-FOUGHT GAME
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that the senior
women's hockey team put up the
toughest fight since its initial contest,
the fourth-year women were downed
by the freshman eleven, 2 to 0, yes
terday afternoon. The frosh stole
their winning points, the smallest
score for the victors this year, during
the first half, and failed to make any
headway in the last half.
Good playing by the wings was no
ticeable, particularly on the part of
Clare Nichols on the '33 team. Rosa
mond Clarke, Elizabeth Woodyatt,
Matie McLaren, and Maxine Cushing
were the mainstays of the senior
squad. The latter's goal guard, Nane
lia Siegfried, '30, who is turning out
for hockey for her first season, looks
like a find for the seniors in the way
of goal guards. Captain Eleanor Boyd
made the first score for the yearlings,
and Marion Jones shot in the second
one not many minutes after.
Elizabeth Woodyatt, hockey man
ager, announces that the champion
ship games will probably be sched
uled to begin at 4:15 o'clock instead
of 4:30 in order to finish the contest
before dark.
