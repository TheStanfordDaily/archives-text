LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13.
covery by a night watchman of a
steel-encased bomb, equipped with an
electric detonator, under the floor of
an abandoned stage set at the Metro
politan Studios, led police today to in
vestigate a theory that bombers had
recently planned to blast the studio,
but evidently were thwarted in their
plans.
Further search of the studio build
ings, which are being torn down prior
to the construction of sound stages,
revealed fifteen electric detonators,
fifty pounds of black powder, and fifty
feet of fuse.
