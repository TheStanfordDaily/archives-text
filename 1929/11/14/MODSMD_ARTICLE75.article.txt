### Martha Inge 
More than 110,000 people visited the
Stanford campus during the past year, I
according to information given out yes
terday by Mrs. Irene Spenner, executive
assistant in the Appointment Office.
"Through the autumn quarter, which
is the most quiet period of the whole
year, there were about 50 visitors each
week day and perhaps 300 on Sunday,"
Mrs. Spenner said. "However, the aver
age for the winter and spring quarters is
150 people daily with a total of 1500 for
Sunday. Summer days show figures to
taling approximately one and one-half
times those of spring quarter.
Rival Yosemite Visitors
Even a moderate estimate would place
the total number of visitors at 110,000
each year. It is quite interesting to com
pare that figure with the number whi
visit Yosemite, 500,000.

"Student guides may be called 'con
tact-men' for the University," continued
Mrs. Spenner. "Consequently, they are
very carefully chosen, for it is from
these guides that visitors obtain their
impressions and opinions of Stanford.
Chapel Is Center of Interest
"The Stanford guide system was in
troduced by Mrs. Elizabeth 11. Snell, ap
pointment secretary, ten years ago, after
she had visited the Harvard campus.
Since that time improvements in tech
nique and in personnel have made the
Stanford system one of the best in the
country. Even students and sometimes
professors in the University find the
guides' lectures most interesting because
the information given is not easily ac
cessible to the general public.
"The Chapel is always the center of
interest," she concluded, "with Ihxiver's
home, the Art Gallery, the Library, and
the Museum following closely."
