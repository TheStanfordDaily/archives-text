# DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OXFORD AND STANFORD DEBATE TEAMS LITTLE
## Professor Harvey Criticizes Three Oxford Speakers; McClintock Best 
### Stewart Crawford 
To Professor E. L. Harvey, formerly
of Oxford, and now in the History
Department at Stanford, there was
little to choose between the Stanford
and Oxford debate teams in their
argument last Tuesday evening as to
whether this is "The Best of All Pos
sible Worlds."
"On the whole, it was hard to dis
tinguish any real difference or kind
in the quality of the two teams," ho
said, "and little enough in degree.
Perhaps the most obvious difference
was in the accent.
Voice Like Trombone
"The flr√üt Oxford speaker, who also
spoke last, had a voice like a trom
bone, and cannot be considered typi
cal of Oxford at all. He seemed to be
'Disraelified.' The second Oxford man
was 'Gibbonesque.' Oxford's third de
bater seemed to have studied "Per
suasion' without reading 'Pride and
Prejudice," and as such one would
like to think him the most repre
sentative of Oxford. His voice was
like the sound from a speaking tube,
which is as it should be.
"The debate was a reward for those
who looked for humor," continued
Professor Harvey, "as there was a
feast of various kinds. Having heard
many debates between Oxford and
American teams in Canada and also
four years of the original debates at
the Union in Oxford, I believe the
visiting team, though charming and
full of delightful humor, was not at
all as good as many which I have had
the pleasure of hearing on this side of
the Atlantic."
Second Speaker Condemned
Professor Harvey, though from Ox
ford himself, is not in sympathy with
the stand taken by Mr. Diplock, Ox
ford's second speaker.
"Mr. Diplock had a different kind
of humor from anyone else: it was
irony, not of the Socratic and con
structive kind which leads the audi
ence to reform, but reminded one of
the inscription of Dean Swift's tomb
stone, for he was possessed of 'saeva
indignatio' against everything Ameri
can. Evidently he has read that fa
mous chaptor in Gibbons' 'Decline and
Fall," he added.
Professor Harvey expressed his
high opinion of the Stanford debaters.
"The ablest Stanford speaker was Mr.
McClintock, who had nothing to yield
to the best of the other team," he
said.
