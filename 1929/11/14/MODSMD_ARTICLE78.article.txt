## 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 13 (/P). â€”
Panic among several hundred passengers
on a Bremerton bound ferry was nar
rowly averted early today when a tug
ripped a SO-foot hole in the ferry's side
and wrecked two automobiles in a pas
sageway. The boats collided about a mile
from the ferry dock here in a dense fog.
Captain Bush Leighton, in command of
the ferry, the Seattle, quieted fears of
passengers and continued the trip to
Bremerton when it was found the hole
was well above the water line. The tug
boat Winona, towing a General Petro
leum Corporation barge, was reported
damaged al>out the bow.
