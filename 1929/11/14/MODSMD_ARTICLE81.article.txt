Is medicine tending toward becoming
the most important study at Stanford?
According to a survey of the work and
interests of more than 1000 Stanford
students and alumni, medicine is making
an advance in importance as an intended
life work. The survey has just been
completed under the Vocational Guidance
Committee, and the data have been col
lected by the Alumni Secretary and by
Dr. Edward K. Strong of the Graduate
School of Business.
In Education
From the records of some 600 alumni
of the classes of '22, '23, and '27, it was
found that 111, or eighteen per cent, were
engaged in some branch of education.
Engineers and miscellaneous business
men tied for second place with approxi
mately ten per cent, and lawyers, physi
cians, chemists, salesmen, geologists,
bankers, and realtors followed in the
order named. These records were for
occupations engaged in this year. Among
the divisions of education, high school
teachers ranked first with 47 of the total,
and college teachers second with thirty
six. In engineering, elcctrical and civil
engineers ranked the most numerous.
On the Strong Interest Blanks, along
with other information, 437 seniors and
graduates of the class of '27 indicated
the careers that they intended to follow.
Medicine ranked first with twenty-six per
cent of the total number of students.
Among the alumni studied, medicine had
attracted but seven per cent. Education,
law, engineering, miscellaneous business,
geology, chemistry, biology, psychology,
and investment banking followed in pop
ularity in the above order.
School Administration
With the students of the class of 1927,
several of the twenty most desired ca
reers had no place in the first twenty in
popularity of the alumni group. These
were school administration, civil engi
neering, biology, psychology, journalism,
writing, politics, diplomatic service, and
foreign trade. Careers followed by the
alumni that ranked among the first twen
ty but did not fall in the first twenty of
the student group were private school
teaching, realty, insurance, salesmanship,
sales supervision, brokerage, mechanical
engineering, and two groups called mis
cellaneous engineering technical work.
Twenty-nine of the women of the
alumni group, more than one-half of the
women studied, have married without
following other careers. Three of them,
but none of the men, simply indicated
"leisure" as the career they were follow
ing.
