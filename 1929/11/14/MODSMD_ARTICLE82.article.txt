# S.C. Fraternities Consider Abolition Of "Hell Week"
## 
### 
A "Hell Week" committee of the
interfraternity council of the Univer
sity of Southern California has been
selected to investigate the probabili
ties of abolishing such practices. Seri
ous problems arising from this period
of fraternity initiations have been of
such a nature that at the national
conventions of the major fraternities
there has been a successful movement
completed to abolish them.
The purpose of the "Hell Week"
committee is to venture into the
problem and to suggest possible so
lutions for a betterment of the pres
ent methods, with especial reference
to the so-called "horseplay" which
has been prevalent in the past.
