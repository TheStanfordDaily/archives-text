## 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 13. (/P)—
"Get the Bears" was the slogan of the
University of Washington football
squad which left Seattle late today for
Berkeley to tangle with the undefeat
ed University of California grid eleven
next Saturday.
Thirty-three Huskies, headed by
their retiring coach, Enoch Bagshaw,
were given a rousing farewell recep
tion at the train depot as they de
! parted on a 5000-mile trip to close the
Washington session with two road
games. The Husky eleven plays its
last contest with the University of
j Chicago at Chicago November 23.
Full Strength Seen
The Purple and Gold team will be
at full strength for its final Pacific
Coast Conference game with the Cali
fornia Bears and is given an outside
chance for victory by virtue of the
Huskies' surprising showing against
Stanford last Saturday when they
held the powerful Cardinals to a 6 to
0 score.
| LOS ANGELES, Nov. 13. (JP) —
| Harry Edelson, hard-hitting star half
back of the University of Southern
California, was reported by physicians
to bo much better today, but they
considered his chances of being ready
to make a trip by plane to Chicago
in time for the game Saturday with
Notre Dame as small.
Trojan Offensive
The first-string half, whose inter
j ference running has made him a
! valuable part of the Trojan offense,
I was confined to a hospital cot yes-
I terday when thirty-eight of his tenra
! mates departed for the scene of tli. ir
j big intersectional tilt. His temperature
' today was normal in comparison with
the 102 degrees yesterday.
Should Edelson recover sufficiently,
he will leave here by plane for Kan
sas City Friday evening, and will go
to Chicago from there by train.
