# CAMPUS LEADERS DECLARE BELIEF IN STANFORD SPIRIT; ONLY DORMANT IS OPINION
## Warner Suggests Pep Rally at Practice Field; Muller and Fleishhacker Praise Ex Committee for Action 
### 
HAS Stanford's fighting spirit gone the way of Roble Bridge and the
Toonerville Trolley? Vigorous denial of this allegation was made yester
day by campus leaders, who, while deploring the present lethargic attitude
of the students, declare that the Cardinal spirit is existant, but in a dormant
state.
Beliefs that this enthusiasm will manifest itself were expressed by the
following representative members of the student body and faculty:

Pop Wants Rallies
"Pop" Warner: "The action of the Ex
Committee was not necessary, but it was
a good thing. Stanford spirit is not as
good as it was when we had a losing
team. There have been winning teams in
track and winning teams in football and
the student seems to be taking things for
granted. The "pep" meeting is bound to
raise some enthusiasm but one won't be
enough; I'd like to suggest a rally at the
practice field some afternoon. Say Mon
day at 4 :30. The team is always blue on
Monday after a game when everybody
shows up stiff and sore."
Herb Fleishhacker: "The action of the
Ex Committee was the best thing they
could do. Rooters make all the differ
ence in the world, and I believe there is
a sad lack of Stanford spirit."
Spirit Is Lacking
Don Muller: "Action by the Ex Com
mittee was absolutely necessary. There
is a complete lack of Stanford spirit.
Something's got to happen to stir 'em
up; the U.S.C. game didn't do it; the
Washington game didn't. What will?"
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. publicity
director: "The situation needs no com
ment. When the team got back from
the hard Washington game there was not
one single student to meet the train at
the depot. Not one!"
Stanford Steinbeck: "We want to
build up a winning spirit, and not a feel
ing of 'what's wrong with the team.' The
student body is behind the team but it
has been lethargic in showing its spirit.
The Executive Committee as the official
organization of the entire student body is
the logical organ to point out the exist
ing situation.
"Anything that can bring the students
together as a whole to show the team
and the University that we are backing
Pop Warner and the Stanford Varsity
in every way possible is a worthy proj
ect."
Rallies Useless
Scott Webster, president of Interfra
ternity Council: "Rallies will not bring
out the spirit. Up to the time of the Big
Game, there is no enthusiasm, so this
lack of spirit at the present time is not
at all unusual."
Chuck Fox, chairman of Rally Com
mittee : "I believe the apparent lack of
enthusiasm is due entirely to the habit
of winning which we have acquired in
