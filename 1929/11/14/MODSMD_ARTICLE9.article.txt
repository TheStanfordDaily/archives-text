# CAMPUS LEADERS DECLARE BELIEF IN STANFORD SPIRIT; ONLY DORMANT IS OPINION
## Warner Suggests Pep Rally at Practice Field; Muller and Fleishhacker Praise Ex Committee for Action 
### 
HAS Stanford's fighting spirit gone the way of Roble Bridge and the
Toonerville Trolley? Vigorous denial of this allegation was made yester
day by campus leaders, who, while deploring the present lethargic attitude
of the students, declare that the Cardinal spirit is existant, but in a dormant
state.
Beliefs that this enthusiasm will manifest itself were expressed by the
following representative members of the student body and faculty:

Pop Wants Rallies
"Pop" Warner: "The action of the Ex
Committee was not necessary, but it was
a good thing. Stanford spirit is not as
good as it was when we had a losing
team. There have been winning teams in
track and winning teams in football and
the student seems to be taking things for
granted. The "pep" meeting is bound to
raise some enthusiasm but one won't be
enough; I'd like to suggest a rally at the
practice field some afternoon. Say Mon
day at 4 :30. The team is always blue on
Monday after a game when everybody
shows up stiff and sore."
Herb Fleishhacker: "The action of the
Ex Committee was the best thing they
could do. Rooters make all the differ
ence in the world, and I believe there is
a sad lack of Stanford spirit."
Spirit Is Lacking
Don Muller: "Action by the Ex Com
mittee was absolutely necessary. There
is a complete lack of Stanford spirit.
Something's got to happen to stir 'em
up; the U.S.C. game didn't do it; the
Washington game didn't. What will?"
Don Liebendorfer, B.A.C. publicity
director: "The situation needs no com
ment. When the team got back from
the hard Washington game there was not
one single student to meet the train at
the depot. Not one!"
Stanford Steinbeck: "We want to
build up a winning spirit, and not a feel
ing of 'what's wrong with the team.' The
student body is behind the team but it
has been lethargic in showing its spirit.
The Executive Committee as the official
organization of the entire student body is
the logical organ to point out the exist
ing situation.
"Anything that can bring the students
together as a whole to show the team
and the University that we are backing
Pop Warner and the Stanford Varsity
in every way possible is a worthy proj
ect."
Rallies Useless
Scott Webster, president of Interfra
ternity Council: "Rallies will not bring
out the spirit. Up to the time of the Big
Game, there is no enthusiasm, so this
lack of spirit at the present time is not
at all unusual."
Chuck Fox, chairman of Rally Com
mittee : "I believe the apparent lack of
enthusiasm is due entirely to the habit
of winning which we have acquired in
the past few years. This generation of
Stanford students has never seen Cali
fornia defeat Stanford and with proper
student support there is 110 reason why
this year should prove the exception."
George Bodle, vice-prsident of A.S.
S.U.: "Walt Heinecke pointed out some
thing we all knew at the Ex Committee
meeting Tuesday when he said that there
wasn't any spirit in the student body and
that the team was feeling it. We think
that a spontaneous mass meeting such as
the one to be held will pep things up and
bring back some of the old fight."
Maxine Cushing, vice-president of
A.W.S.: "I think that there is a great
deal of underlying spirit in the student
body, but it lacks some of the 'rah rah'
form. It doesn't bring out enough show
of spirit. The mass meeting will bring
things to the attention of the students,
and from then on interest will be con
centrated on the Big Game."
Not Disloyal
Hector Dyer, member of Ex Commit
tee : "Sure there is a lack of spirit. The
students aren't really disloyal, but they
don't demonstrate their spirit. The stu
dent body is too easily satisfied with its
own efforts in supporting the team. I
believe that laziness, sophistication, and
the fact that indifference has become a
habit are the chief reasons for this lack.
The Ex Committee is holding the mass
meeting to show that it is doing some
thing positive. If the students could get
going in the right direction their whole
group psychology would be shifted."
Katherine Keho, member Ex Commit
tee: "There is a very sad lack of spirit,
especially with regard to the football
team. The singing and yelling is poor.
We can have spirit and support if we
are willing to work for it, and the mass
meeting will be successful if we can get
support. The whole trouble is just the
attitude of the student body."
Need Blood and Thunder
Thomas Pike, member of Ex Commit
tee : "There is a general lack of spirit all
around the campus. No real feeling or
pep is in evidence. There is enough yell
ing at the games, but aside from that
there is a total lack of enthusiasm. This
may be because the team lost to U.S.C.
A lot of people lost bets on that game.
Everyone hopes we will win the Big
Game, but no one gets excited about it.
I think the mass meeting should help
matters. We need a little more of the
blood and thunder type of pep. If we get
a few fellows like Templeton talking to
them it might pep them up. I am not
sure that the meeting will succeed, but it
is the only thing we can do."
Stan Milne, editor of Quad: "Spirit
can only be manifested volitionally. The
expression of it is spontaneous, its in
tensity dependent upon the nature of the
impulse. How can special rallies and yell
leaders expect to furnish an impulse by
trying to make people be emotional about
something or other. Who ever heard of
anyone feeling an impulse upon being
told to do so?
"Stanford spirit is all right, for it is

at least genuine, as all spirit always it.
Less wailing over the deplorable lack of
spirit would probably be more conducive
to tbe development of what is presumed
to be lacking."
Synthetic Enthusiasm?
Nelson Carter, editor of Chaparral:
"A lack of spirit is evident at present,
but I do not believe in mechanical means
to stir up synthetic enthusiasm. The
feeling shown, I think, is indicative of
the anti-'collegiate' movement throughout
j the country."
i John Lauritzen, member Ex Commit
tee: "There isn't so much lack of spirit
in the student body as there is lack of
interest. The old fire more than any
thing else seems to be lacking.
"I think that the mass meeting has a
good chance to succeed. We all want the
team to come out on top, but we'vfc got
to get started backing it. The main idea
is that we have the best team on the
Coast and it's high time the students got
out and helped it to prove that fact."
Alice Ingraham, Women's Editor of
Daily: "I think Stanford Spirit is
much the same as it always has been."
Dean Yost: "My work and my inter
ests have not brought me into contact
with the students in such a manner
i as to enable me to know whether the
enthusiasm for the Big Game is
greater or less this year than it was
before."
Students Lack Spirit
Dr. E. E. Robinson, Chairman of
Public Exercises Committee: "I be
lieve that the action of the Executive
Comittee was desirable, though I
doubt that pep rallies can bring out
enthusiasm for the team. I believe
that there is a lack of school spirit at
Stanford."
Herbert Wenig: campus debater:
"With the Big Game so near this is
no time to analyze and weigh the
spirit of the student body. Whatever
the decision of those who argue the
question we cannot say that there
does not exist in the heart of every
Stanford man and woman a lively
| spirit which anticipates the team's
' victory over California. When we
I think of the game we must admit a
j surging within that calls forth a wild
! desire to see California beaten. The
i rally tomorrow will give an oppor
tunity for us to show our support of
the team in an organized way."
Philip Space: ... An unmitigated
statement to the "press"?
Well, I don't know WHAT to say.
"I sometimes think that never blows
bo red
I The rose as where some buried
Caesar bled"
I ... as the poet says. But as for the
I present situation regarding "school
j spirit"—well, —yes, and no."
