# GEOLOGY STUDENTS FIND INDICATION OF OCEAN ACROSS EUROPE, AMERICA
## 
### Philip Humphreys 
An ocean once extended in a vast
unbroken expanse from central Eu
rope across half tlie world to what is
now western America. This was indi
cated by an important discovery re
cently made by Siemon Muller, in
structor in geology, and Francis
Johnston, graduate student in the
same department.
Certain fossilized marine animals
called ammonites were found for the
first time on this continent by Muller
and Johnston while they were on a
geology expedition into the state of
Nevada. These remains, which belong
to the Mollusca Cephalopoda, are re
markably similar to those that have
been found and studied for many
years in the region of the eastern
Alps.
Alpine Forms
In fact, a large number of the iorms
collected are specifically identical to
the Alpine forms. Hundreds of per
fect specimens of the species were col
lected on the expedition, and their
succession of strata have been well
established. By matching the Euro
pean geological sections, which are
type sections, the age of the remains
is accurately determined in the geo
logical time scale which in terms of
years amounts to hundreds of mil
lions.
The expedition took the geologists
into west central Nevada in the re
gion of the Pilot mountains and Lone
Peak. It was necessary to face con
siderable hardship due to the torren
tial cloudbursts which occurred from
time to time.
Roads Washed Out
In many cases roads washed out by
the floods had to be rebuilt by the
prospectors before they could pro

ceed. Owing to the general lack of
water and the sparse population of
the country which they traversed,
they had to carry all their provisions
with them in the department car.
Sometimes for weeks at a stretch,
they saw no human beings but them
selves.
Muller, who took his A.B. at Oregon
and his .AM. at Stanford, is prepar
ing a report of his "finds" for his
Ph.D. dissertation which will take up
only one phase of the problem of
"Stratigraphy," the study of the suc
cession of deposits and paleontology
of the regions. Johnston, A.B. Har
vard, occupied with a similar problem
in research, is also working for the
advanced degree.

gion of the Pilot mountains and Lone
Peak. It was necessary to face con
siderable hardship due to the torren
tial cloudbursts which occurred from
time to time.
Roads Washed Out
In many cases roads washed out by
the floods had to be rebuilt by the
prospectors before they could pro

ceed. Owing to the general lack of
water and the sparse population of
the country which they traversed,
they had to carry all their provisions
with them in the department car.
Sometimes for weeks at a stretch,
they saw no human beings but them
selves.
Muller, who took his A.B. at Oregon
and his .AM. at Stanford, is prepar
ing a report of his "finds" for his
Ph.D. dissertation which will take up
only one phase of the problem of
"Stratigraphy," the study of the suc
cession of deposits and paleontology
of the regions. Johnston, A.B. Har
vard, occupied with a similar problem
in research, is also working for the
advanced degree.
An ocean once extended in a vast
unbroken expanse from central Eu
rope across half tlie world to what is
now western America. This was indi
cated by an important discovery re
cently made by Siemon Muller, in
structor in geology, and Francis
Johnston, graduate student in the
same department.
Certain fossilized marine animals
called ammonites were found for the
first time on this continent by Muller
and Johnston while they were on a
geology expedition into the state of
Nevada. These remains, which belong
to the Mollusca Cephalopoda, are re
markably similar to those that have
been found and studied for many
years in the region of the eastern
Alps.
Alpine Forms
In fact, a large number of the iorms
collected are specifically identical to
the Alpine forms. Hundreds of per
fect specimens of the species were col
lected on the expedition, and their
succession of strata have been well
established. By matching the Euro
pean geological sections, which are
type sections, the age of the remains
is accurately determined in the geo
logical time scale which in terms of
years amounts to hundreds of mil
lions.
