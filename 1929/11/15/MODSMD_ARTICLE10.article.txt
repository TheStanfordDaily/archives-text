# PLANS DESIGNED FOR BUILDING OF BIG GAME PYRE
## Preliminary Work Started; Committees Appointed To Place Guards 
### 
This year's Big Game bonfire, plans of
which are now completed, will be a de
parture in style of structure from those
of past years. According to Phil Cald
well, engineer in charge of construction,
it will be built similar to the shape of a
skyscraper.
With dimensions for a pyre 64 feet
high and approximately 40 feet square,
the 1929 bonfire will differ from others
by having specially buift buttressed cor
ners, which will add strength and keep
the original shape longer while the pyre
is burning.
Twenty telephone poles, erected by the
Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Com
pany of Palo Alto, will be the supporting
framework for some three carloads of
railroad ties given by the Southern Pa
cific Company. Freshmen yesterday aft
ernoon began transporting the ties from
Palo Alto to the scene of the bonfire.
Three-Day Period
The rapid construction necessary this
year will demand every moment that each
frosh can spare, according to Caldwell.
He reported that only a few freshmen
turned out yesterday afternoon to help in
setting the telephone poles.
"By Saturday the entire framework
and scaffolding must be completed.
Building of the bonfire proper will be
gin Monday morning," said Caldwell.
Because of the three-day period for
construction enforced this year, fresh
men will be spared the long weeks of
guarding which they were forced to do
in the past. But, according to the bon
fire committee, there is still plenty left
to test the spirit and endurance of the
hard-working first-year men.
McElwain To Guard
With the specified purpose of pre
venting any childish attempts at a
pre-ignited bonfire, Stanford Stein
beck yesterday appointed Lester Mc-
Elwain to serve as chairman of a
committee of nine men, which com
mittee will have charge of seeing that
the bonfire is guarded during the pro
cess of construction.
With McElwain on the committee
are Herkimer Adams, Jimmy Web
ster, Walt Cooper, Sidney Lippitt,
George Smith, Ovid Ritter, A1 Miller,
and Tom Spencer.
