Teams are composed of five men
each, and round-robin competition with
a maximum of 25 matches will be held.
These encounters will be the second

Stanford has already defeated the
California second team.
The clubmen bring an experienced

champion and a former member of the
Holland Bavis Cup fencing team. The
matches will give the newer men on
the Stanford team valuable competi
