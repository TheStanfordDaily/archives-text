# SUBSTITUTE AIRPORT SITE TO BE STUDIED BY PALY COMMISSION
## 
### 
Municipal land on Palo Alto's bay
shore is to be studied as a substitute
site for the present airport near the
campus, by the Palo Alto City Plan
ning Commission. It was the general
opinion of the commission at a meet
ing Wednesday night that a new flving
field location will be necessary before
very long because of the increasing
danger of the present site to property
owners in the district and to campus
activities.
This need is emphasized by the re
cent edict closing the field on big
football days. Palo Alto is one of the
few cities in the country to have an
airport within walking distance of a
large college stadium. Progressive
city leaders consider deplorable the
fact that this facility should be use
less when it was in its greatest de
mand, namely on big football days
such as the day of the Stanford-
U.S.C. game, when two-thirds of the
airplanes in the state were here. The
bayshore site is proposed as a solu
tion to this problem.
