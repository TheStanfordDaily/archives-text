## 
### 
"The Treatment of Minorities in
the Balkans" is to be the subject of
the lecture given by Dr. Louis C. Cor
nish on next Tuesday evening, No
vember 19, at 7:30 o'clock in the As
sembly Hall. Dr. Cornish, a Stanford
graduate, is president of the Ameri
can Unitarian Association, and will
preach in the Memorial Church on
two Sunday mornings, November 17
and 24 respectively.
Dr. Cornish has been so much in
terested in the problem of the treat
ment of the minorities in the Balkans
because of the fact that the oldest
group of Uniarian churches in the
world is in Transylvania, which was
taken from Hungary and given to
Roumania by the Trianon Treaty.
He has spoken on this subject in
forty or more colleges and universi
ties in the East, including Cornell,
Harvard, and the University of Chi
cago. Dr. Cornish will speak at the
University of California after his stay
here on the campus. The lecture is
one of the regular Tuesday evening
series, sponsored by the Committee on
Public Exercises, and is open to the
public.
