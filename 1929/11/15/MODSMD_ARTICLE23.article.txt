# 'POP' WILL USE RESERVE SIRING IN BRONCO GAME
## Heiser, Simkins Will Play in Clash With Santa Clara as Preliminary to Big Game Subs Will Have Good Chance To Do Their Stuff; Rintala, Clark, Hillman May Star 
### Stephen Dietrich 
When the Cardinal varsity faces
Santa Clara tomorrow afternoon in
its last big test before the annual Big
Game with the Golden Bears next
week-end, it will be a lineup com
posed of reserves that trots out on
the turf to tame the galloping Broncs.
Coach Pop Warner, though not
overlooking the Mission team's poten
tial strength, has decided to give his
first-string men a rest. The Cards
received a tough battering at Seattle
last Saturday, and several of the
regulars are not in the best of shape
to see action against the Broncs.
Reserves Big Chance
At the same time, it will give Pop
a good chance to see how some of his
so-called substitutes stand up under
real fire. A few of the reserves have
already displayed their ability as po
tent pigskin packers, and are likely
to play their share of the Big Game.
The rest of them will have their big
chance tomorrow.
Although attempting to take the
Broncs in stride, Pop has not kidded
himself into thinking that Clipper
Smith's men will put up a feeble bat
tle against his own stalwarts. He
remembers all too well what happened
two years ago. As a consequence, the
regulars will be out on the bench
ready to go in if the feoing gets too
tough for the super-varsity to handle.
Heiser, Simkins Start
However, it is by no means a weak
outfit that will open up for Stanford.
Pete Heiser and Bill Simkins, classed
as regulars before the 1929 grid sea
son got under way and both of whom
have been kept on the sidelines most
of the season because of Injuries, will
both start for the Cards. Coach War
ner is anxious to have these two men
at the peak of their form for the Cal
contest, and the Bronc clash will
probably make or break them for the
remainder of the season.
Besides Simkins, who is scheduled
to do a lot of passing tomorrow, the
Cardinal backfleld will be composed
of Harry Hillman at quarter, Rudy
Rintala at left half, and Bill Clark at
right half. This quartet of ball-toters
is expected to come through with the
goods, as it combines a smashing
punch with speed.
Hillman Develops
The big blond giant, Hillman, is
fast developing into one of the best
line-plungers on the Coast, and it is
only lack of experience that keeps
him from being a regular today. He
has been showing up especially well
in practice all this week, and in
scrimmage the other night proceeded
to smash through the forward wall at
will for lengthy gains.
Clark is a light but flashy type of
runner, whose elusive hips shake off
would-be tacklers in Hyland fashion.
Although not classed as a first-string
player, Clark was one of the outstand
ing stars of the U.S.C. game not so
long ago. Rintala was a big threat on
Husky Hunt's frosh eleven last year,
but as yet has not been given much
of an opportunity to perform for the
varsity.
If Stanford is outplayed at all to
line, as one of Pop's biggest problems
morrow it will probably be in the
this fall has been in developing suf
ficient reserve strength for the for
ward wall. On the other hand, Santa
Clara boasts a hard smashing line of
veterans, and Coach Smith is bank
ing on them to stop the Cardinal run
ning attack cold. Perry Taylor, at
center, will have one hard time bowl
ing over Tassi, who is constructed
along the same architectural lines as
Walt Heinecke. Ruffo is the other
Bronc defensive gun, but his playing
is likely to be offset by the work of
Heiser, provided the latter's knee
holds up.
Probable Lineup
Yesterday's workout for the Cards
largely consisted of dummy scrim
mage, followed by a stiff signal prac
tice. Pop will put his charges through
a light session again today. Following
is the probable lineup for tomorrow's
game, though subject to last-minute
changes:
Stanford — Santa Clara —
Bush REL Kerclioff
Bogue RTL O'Daniels
Heiser RGL Ruffo
Taylor C Tassi
Hulen LGR Wilkenson
Klabau LTR Flohr
Wittenau LER Ehlert

Heiser, Simkins Start
However, it is by no means a weak
outfit that will open up for Stanford.
Pete Heiser and Bill Simkins, classed
as regulars before the 1929 grid sea
son got under way and both of whom
have been kept on the sidelines most
of the season because of Injuries, will
both start for the Cards. Coach War
ner is anxious to have these two men
at the peak of their form for the Cal
contest, and the Bronc clash will
probably make or break them for the
remainder of the season.
Besides Simkins, who is scheduled
to do a lot of passing tomorrow, the
Cardinal backfleld will be composed
of Harry Hillman at quarter, Rudy
Rintala at left half, and Bill Clark at
right half. This quartet of ball-toters
is expected to come through with the
goods, as it combines a smashing
punch with speed.
Hillman Develops
The big blond giant, Hillman, is
fast developing into one of the best
line-plungers on the Coast, and it is
only lack of experience that keeps
him from being a regular today. He
has been showing up especially well
in practice all this week, and in
scrimmage the other night proceeded
to smash through the forward wall at
will for lengthy gains.
Clark is a light but flashy type of
runner, whose elusive hips shake off
would-be tacklers in Hyland fashion.
Although not classed as a first-string
player, Clark was one of the outstand
ing stars of the U.S.C. game not so
long ago. Rintala was a big threat on
Husky Hunt's frosh eleven last year,
but as yet has not been given much
of an opportunity to perform for the
varsity.
If Stanford is outplayed at all to
line, as one of Pop's biggest problems
morrow it will probably be in the
this fall has been in developing suf
ficient reserve strength for the for
ward wall. On the other hand, Santa
Clara boasts a hard smashing line of
veterans, and Coach Smith is bank
ing on them to stop the Cardinal run
ning attack cold. Perry Taylor, at
center, will have one hard time bowl
ing over Tassi, who is constructed
along the same architectural lines as
Walt Heinecke. Ruffo is the other
Bronc defensive gun, but his playing
is likely to be offset by the work of
Heiser, provided the latter's knee
holds up.
Probable Lineup
Yesterday's workout for the Cards
largely consisted of dummy scrim
mage, followed by a stiff signal prac
tice. Pop will put his charges through
a light session again today. Following
is the probable lineup for tomorrow's
game, though subject to last-minute
changes:
Stanford — Santa Clara —
Bush REL Kerclioff
Bogue RTL O'Daniels
Heiser RGL Ruffo
Taylor C Tassi
Hulen LGR Wilkenson
Klabau LTR Flohr
Wittenau LER Ehlert
Hillman Q Axt
Clark RHL Mettler
Rintala LHR Casanova
Simkins F Simoni
When the Cardinal varsity faces
Santa Clara tomorrow afternoon in
its last big test before the annual Big
Game with the Golden Bears next
week-end, it will be a lineup com
posed of reserves that trots out on
the turf to tame the galloping Broncs.
Coach Pop Warner, though not
overlooking the Mission team's poten
tial strength, has decided to give his
first-string men a rest. The Cards
received a tough battering at Seattle
last Saturday, and several of the
regulars are not in the best of shape
to see action against the Broncs.
Reserves Big Chance
At the same time, it will give Pop
a good chance to see how some of his
so-called substitutes stand up under
real fire. A few of the reserves have
already displayed their ability as po
tent pigskin packers, and are likely
to play their share of the Big Game.
The rest of them will have their big
chance tomorrow.
Although attempting to take the
Broncs in stride, Pop has not kidded
himself into thinking that Clipper
Smith's men will put up a feeble bat
tle against his own stalwarts. He
remembers all too well what happened
two years ago. As a consequence, the
regulars will be out on the bench
ready to go in if the feoing gets too
tough for the super-varsity to handle.

player, Clark was one of the outstand
ing stars of the U.S.C. game not so
long ago. Rintala was a big threat on
Husky Hunt's frosh eleven last year,
but as yet has not been given much
of an opportunity to perform for the
varsity.
If Stanford is outplayed at all to
line, as one of Pop's biggest problems
morrow it will probably be in the
this fall has been in developing suf
ficient reserve strength for the for
ward wall. On the other hand, Santa
Clara boasts a hard smashing line of
veterans, and Coach Smith is bank
ing on them to stop the Cardinal run
ning attack cold. Perry Taylor, at
center, will have one hard time bowl
ing over Tassi, who is constructed
along the same architectural lines as
Walt Heinecke. Ruffo is the other
Bronc defensive gun, but his playing
is likely to be offset by the work of
Heiser, provided the latter's knee
holds up.
Probable Lineup
Yesterday's workout for the Cards
largely consisted of dummy scrim
mage, followed by a stiff signal prac
tice. Pop will put his charges through
a light session again today. Following
is the probable lineup for tomorrow's
game, though subject to last-minute
changes:
Stanford — Santa Clara —
Bush REL Kerclioff
Bogue RTL O'Daniels
Heiser RGL Ruffo
Taylor C Tassi
Hulen LGR Wilkenson
Klabau LTR Flohr
Wittenau LER Ehlert
Hillman Q Axt
Clark RHL Mettler
Rintala LHR Casanova
Simkins F Simoni
When the Cardinal varsity faces
Santa Clara tomorrow afternoon in
its last big test before the annual Big
Game with the Golden Bears next
week-end, it will be a lineup com
posed of reserves that trots out on
the turf to tame the galloping Broncs.
Coach Pop Warner, though not
overlooking the Mission team's poten
tial strength, has decided to give his
first-string men a rest. The Cards
received a tough battering at Seattle
last Saturday, and several of the
regulars are not in the best of shape
to see action against the Broncs.
Reserves Big Chance
At the same time, it will give Pop
a good chance to see how some of his
so-called substitutes stand up under
real fire. A few of the reserves have
already displayed their ability as po
tent pigskin packers, and are likely
to play their share of the Big Game.
The rest of them will have their big
chance tomorrow.
Although attempting to take the
Broncs in stride, Pop has not kidded
himself into thinking that Clipper
Smith's men will put up a feeble bat
tle against his own stalwarts. He
remembers all too well what happened
two years ago. As a consequence, the
regulars will be out on the bench
ready to go in if the feoing gets too
tough for the super-varsity to handle.
Heiser, Simkins Start
However, it is by no means a weak
outfit that will open up for Stanford.
Pete Heiser and Bill Simkins, classed
as regulars before the 1929 grid sea
son got under way and both of whom
have been kept on the sidelines most
of the season because of Injuries, will
both start for the Cards. Coach War
ner is anxious to have these two men
at the peak of their form for the Cal
contest, and the Bronc clash will
probably make or break them for the
remainder of the season.
Besides Simkins, who is scheduled
to do a lot of passing tomorrow, the
Cardinal backfleld will be composed
of Harry Hillman at quarter, Rudy
Rintala at left half, and Bill Clark at
right half. This quartet of ball-toters
is expected to come through with the
goods, as it combines a smashing
punch with speed.
Hillman Develops
The big blond giant, Hillman, is
fast developing into one of the best
line-plungers on the Coast, and it is
only lack of experience that keeps
him from being a regular today. He
has been showing up especially well
in practice all this week, and in
scrimmage the other night proceeded
to smash through the forward wall at
will for lengthy gains.
Clark is a light but flashy type of
runner, whose elusive hips shake off
would-be tacklers in Hyland fashion.
Although not classed as a first-string
player, Clark was one of the outstand
ing stars of the U.S.C. game not so
long ago. Rintala was a big threat on
Husky Hunt's frosh eleven last year,
but as yet has not been given much
