# FAMINE IN PLACE OF FOOD GREETS FROSH COMING FROM RALLY
## 
### 
Two hundred freshmen living in
Encina went hungry or sought food
at some other place yesterday noon
when they returned from the student
body rally to find the dining rooms
presenting a closed and forbidding
aspect.
Despite loud and enthusiastic pro
testations, recitations, and incanta
tions on the part of the excluded
frosh, the portals remained closed to
the imploring famine victims.
The mistake was due to insufficient
arrangements, according to Miss Etta
Handy, director of the dining halls.
"Ninety per cent of our student wait
ers have 1 o'clock classes. Without
official notice from the administra
tion of the University, we cannot,
under any circumstances, interfere
with these classes," said Miss Handy.
"We always strive to be of utmost
service to the student body, but this
was one time when it was not pos
sible."
Miss Handy said that the doors
were kept open until 12:35 o'clock,
the last possible moment that would
enable the help to reach their classes.
