# SON OF A GAMBOLIER
## 
### 
"I wish I had an ocean of rum, and
sugar, a million pounds,
The dear old Quad to mix it in, and
a chimney to stir it round.
I'd drink to the health of the Cardinal
So glorious and so true,
And join the rollicking chorus:
To Hell with the Gold and Blue."
CHORUS :
"I'm a son-of-a, son-of-a, son-of-a
Gambol ier,
A son-of-a, son-of-a, son-of-a-
Gambolier,
Like every honest fellow,
I like my whiskey clear.
I'm a rambling wreck of poverty,
and a son-of-a-Gambolicr."
"Here's to dear old Stanford, where
the color of life is red,
We'll rise and give the Varsity
from our coffins when we're
dead.
And when we mount the golden stair,
We'll give St. Peter the cue,
And he'll join the rollicking chorus:

To Hell with tlie Gold and Blue."
CHORUS:
"Im a son-of-a, son-of-a, . . .
