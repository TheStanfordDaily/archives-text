Further evidence of the emancipation of Stanford's womanhood was
disclosed yesterday with the Women's Conference decision that late leaves
for Big Game night will end at 3 a.m. Sunday instead of at 1:30 a.m., the
hour when co-eds are regularly expected to return to the fold.
This move is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. It would
have been absurd to expect the "500" to cut of! festivities at 12 o'clock
in order to reach the campus to make the deadline on Stanford's gala
night of the year.
The Daily congratulates the Women's Conference on its move away
from Victorianism, and hopes that this decision may be taken as an
indication that eventually the 1:30 time limit for late leaves will be ex
tended to a more reasonable hour.
