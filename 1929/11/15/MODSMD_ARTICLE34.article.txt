Freshmen will have ample opportunity to work up Big Game enthu
siasm by building the bonfire. And any sophomore or upperclassman
whose spirits are exuberant will be welcomed by the committee to assist
in the construction of the Golden Bear pyre.
That method of displaying enthusiasm is literally constructive. An
other method sometimes resorted to by students who profess to have

In the past Stanford men have committed acts of vandalism on the
California campus which they have classified as "pranks." The transbay
youths at times have indulged in similar indiscretions on this campus.
But by mutual agreement the raids were declared to be an incogitant
nuisance. And a "gentleman's agreement" was made between the uni
versities to abstain from that method of getting fired up for dear old alma
mammy.
Need the Daily mention that the upholding of that agreement rests
upon every Stanford gentleman, and that a violation will be a reflection
upon the entire student body ?
