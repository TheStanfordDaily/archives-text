The publication of college student newspapers has come to be busi
ness the extent of which few people realize. There are more than four
hundred college papers published at least once a week, with an average of
some twenty-five students working on each paper. There are thirty-two
collge dailies in the country, about half of which use the service of some
nationally kaown newsgathering organization.
About thirty-five college papers are published either twice or three
times a week. More than three hundred colleges have weekly newspapers,
and nearly a hundred more small colleges have papers coming out less often
than once a week but more often than monthly. Academic credit for work
on college papers is the exception rather than the rule. Twenty-four out
of twenty-five dailies reported financial compensation for the editor and
business manager, while seven divided the profits among the members of
the entire stafT. As for the money the staff members are paid, in about
forty per cent of the cases the amounts are based on the percentage of
profits.—Nebraska Alumnus.
