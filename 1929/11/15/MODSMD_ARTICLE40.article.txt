"THE PASSION OR JOAN OF ARC"
—Stanford Assembly Hall.

"The Passion of Joan of Arc," and
especially the performance of Mile.
Maria Falconetti, proved to be all
that advance stories claimed. It stands
alone as a motion picture.
To most of us Americans, this pic
ture presents something new in the
way of theme. Where we are accus
tomed to simple and oft-repeated
plots, or, in rare instances, to rather
uncertain satire, "The Passion of Joan
of Arc" strives to put across to the
audience but one thing: the emotion
al experience of martyrdom by the
French heroine. This is the theme,
and because everything in the picture
contributes to it, the result is extraor
dinary unity and power. And unity is
art.
The acting of Mile. Falconetti is
superb. A great deal of continuity is
given by her facial expressions alone.
Certainly no American actress has
approached anything like this on the
screen, and probably not on the stage.
Every supporting character in the
picture is almost perfectly cast. There
is no such thing as a director in the
picture (or ho it seems) —the actors
are feeling and living their parts so
intensely that they know intuitively
what to do.
The technique is, of course, unique.
To us it is unconventional; that is
because our technique inevitably fol
lows stereotyped lines. In "The Pas
sion of Joan of Arc" technique is used
to further the theme of the picture.
When placing the camera at an un
usual angle would emphasize a char
acter or a significant situation, the
camera was placed so. The result is
amazing power of expression. We
look directly down on a crowd, or up
under a man's chin at his face, or over
his forehead; and we see and feel
those elements that are significant
and need to be brought out.
The settings and costumes are en
tirely satisfactory. There is no flaw
in the picture to detract from atten
tion to the theme. May Hollywood ob
serve and take heart. —Allan Hart.

"DIAMOND LIL," at the Curran
Theater
Mae West, author and leading lady of
"Diamond Lil" at the Curran Theater,
apparently believes that the best way to
teach the right is to show the results of
the wrong. "Diamond Lil" as a play is
hardly more remarkable than its author.
The setting of the play is the Bowery
of thirty years ago. The story concerns
a beauty who came out of Pennsylvania,
visited the Bowery as a sightseer, and
stayed. Her physical attractions won her
the royal crown of the cabarets —and in
cidentally the crown jewels.
The difficulties of writing and pro
ducing such a play are many. The play
must be faithful to its period and satis
factory to this. Its melodrama must be
restrained in order to avoid offending
modern taste. The large cast of thirty
must be carefully manipulated to avoid
a confusion of personalities.
All of these things are well done. Miss
West's performance is the finest thing
in the play. Her role is so convincing
that it will not add to her popular repu
tation. She holds the pose to the last
curtain.
J. Merrill Holmes in the role of Gus
Jordon, Diamond Lil's consort, plays his
part well. Jackson Halliday as Pablo
Juarez is the male counterpart of Lily
Damita. How the movies have missed
him is strange. However, the play will
be filmed. We may see him again.
Raphaella Ottiano is very talented but
overplays her part. Gerald Kent as
Captain Cummings of the Salvation
Army is good, especially in the passion
scenes. He has a perfect Salvation Army
complexion and haircut.
When you have seen this play you will
admit that the hour-glass feminine fig
ure had its possibilities. The barkeeper
with the Robert Louis Stevenson coif
fure is uproarious. The settings are ex
cellent. The beer looks real, and the
flight of Bowery opera in the third act
is unforgetable. However, if you are
easily offended by what a tactful woman
one row back termed "plain talk," don't
go. You've missed so much already you
won't miss this. Otherwise, see it by
all means.
