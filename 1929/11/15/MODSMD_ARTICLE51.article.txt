# DR. JORDAN CONTINUES SHOWING SLIGHT DAILY INCREASE IN STRENGTH
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan continues to show a
slight Improvement In the general
condition of his health, Mrs. Jordan
stated yesterday.
As evidence of this improvement,
Dr. Jordan Is able to be up from a
half hour to an hour longer in the
morning, than formerly.
Intimate friends of Dr. Jordan are
taking advantage of the opportunity
offered during the time that he is up,
to enjoy short talks with him, so that
scarcely a day passes that the former
president of Stanford does not receive
a visit.
Dr. Jordan never loses interest in
his garden. A half hour of his time
every morning he still spends outside
taking pleasure in the open air and
sunshine, and watching the antics of
the pet monkey given to him a few
weeks ago by Stanford student 3.
