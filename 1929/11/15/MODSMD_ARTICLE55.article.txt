THEY'LL DO IT EVERY TIME

Now that Stanford has snapped out
of It onco more with its yearly burst
of ginger and red-hot enthusiasm, the j
followers of the Cardinal banner are
beginning to get all liet up for the
Big Game.
Ticket scalping is being conducted
on an unusually large scale, and in a
fearless, open manner. It Is rumored
that certain persons, who watch their
pennies with eagle-eyed zeal for 3G4
days out of the year, are nonchalantly
forking over as much as 50 iron 1
smackers for a single pasteboard. |
Moreover, the pockets of fire
water merchants are starting to
jingle again. Bull sessions are no
longer about hell fires to burn,
but about Big Game bonfires. The
most erudite of bookworms are
commencing to risk their bawl-out
averages that they may burn the
midnight oil over vivid gridiron
articles about the 23rd.
Brick Morse is crowding Shake
speare off the map!
The students of dear old Stanford '
U., it seems, have merely been saving
up their pep for this grand finale.
The odds are ample dough against an
iron plug that there will be plenty of
hat-flinging, huzzahing, whoopee-mak
ing, and son-ofa-gambolering between j
now and church-time on the 24th.
And as for Pop and his forty-nine i
handlers of the porcine-coated oval,
it is a cinch that they will come j
through all right. Brick Morse admits ,
without a blush that Stanford always !
plays over its head in the Big Game. '
That's not quite so, however.
What Brick really means to articu-'
late is that the Cards will play their
best game of the season against the i
Golden Bears. They'll do it every
time!
Big Game time is pep personi
fied. No matter how much spirit
may lag in the early part of the
season, it never fails to gush forth
like foam from a steam-beer tap
just as soon as the Bear gets a
whiff of Redshirt and the Red
shirt gets a squint of Bear!
