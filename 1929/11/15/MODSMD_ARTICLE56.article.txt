# SHADES OF '27
## 
### 
Yet, lest we forget, the Cards have
another tough game before the 23rd.
Santa Clara invades the Farm tomor
row afternoon, and unless some of
this above-mentioned red-hot enthusi
asm is displayed, Pop may be forced
to start dealing in the Big Game with
a losing pack of Cards.
Stanford rooters will have to yell
vociferously and the white-jerseyed
players will have to retaliate with a
lot of punch and power, or the Bronc
may knock the Cards over with a
lusty kick. This is not at all impos
sible, for in 1927 Santa Clara actually
turned the trick.
On that certain occasion, Stan
ford went into the game a heavy
favorite, just as it does tomorrow.
And Stanford had barely beaten
the Husky in Seattle, just as it
did last week-end. And Stanford
attempted to take the Broncs in
stride, just as it is doing this
year.
But when the Cards went home to
chow that evening, they were too
dazed to gulp down their usual quota
of beefsteaks. The score that day
read: Santa Clara 13, Stanford 7.
However, the situation will be
Hlightly modified tomorrow. Stanford
ia not so cock-sure of winning, and
Pop will be on the bench to run his
charges as they should be run. Two
years ago the Old Fox was off on a

scouting tour, and his master-hand
was not there to divert disaster.
At all events, tomorrow's game
will be well worth seeing. It has
more highly touted features than
were ever crowded under Barnum
and Bailey's big ten at one time.
A few of these are: The return
of Simkins and Heiser; Possibility
of an Upset; The now famous
King Alfonso Shift; Mettler, the
boy who kicks a la Lom; Tassi,
Heinecke-like center; Clipper
Smith's hard-charging Line; and
Guido Simoni, the boy who led
Santa Clara to victory two years
ago. —Stephen Dietrich.

more highly touted features than
were ever crowded under Barnum
and Bailey's big ten at one time.
A few of these are: The return
of Simkins and Heiser; Possibility
of an Upset; The now famous
King Alfonso Shift; Mettler, the
boy who kicks a la Lom; Tassi,
Heinecke-like center; Clipper
Smith's hard-charging Line; and
Guido Simoni, the boy who led
Santa Clara to victory two years
ago. —Stephen Dietrich.
Yet, lest we forget, the Cards have
another tough game before the 23rd.
Santa Clara invades the Farm tomor
row afternoon, and unless some of
this above-mentioned red-hot enthusi
asm is displayed, Pop may be forced
to start dealing in the Big Game with
a losing pack of Cards.
Stanford rooters will have to yell
vociferously and the white-jerseyed
players will have to retaliate with a
lot of punch and power, or the Bronc
may knock the Cards over with a
lusty kick. This is not at all impos
sible, for in 1927 Santa Clara actually
turned the trick.
On that certain occasion, Stan
ford went into the game a heavy
favorite, just as it does tomorrow.
And Stanford had barely beaten
the Husky in Seattle, just as it
did last week-end. And Stanford
attempted to take the Broncs in
stride, just as it is doing this
year.
But when the Cards went home to
chow that evening, they were too
dazed to gulp down their usual quota
of beefsteaks. The score that day
read: Santa Clara 13, Stanford 7.
However, the situation will be
Hlightly modified tomorrow. Stanford
ia not so cock-sure of winning, and
Pop will be on the bench to run his
charges as they should be run. Two
years ago the Old Fox was off on a

scouting tour, and his master-hand
was not there to divert disaster.
At all events, tomorrow's game
will be well worth seeing. It has
more highly touted features than
were ever crowded under Barnum
and Bailey's big ten at one time.
