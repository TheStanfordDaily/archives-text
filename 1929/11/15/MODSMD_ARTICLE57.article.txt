### 
"Every man and woman here has true
loyalty to both the team and the Uni
versity, but the question is: Have you
been showing it?" This was the senti
ment expressed by Bill Owens, faculty
athletic adviser, at the pep rally held
yesterday noon at the engineering cor
ner.
"Most of you have never seen Stanford
defeated in a Big Game, and I don't be
lieve you're due to see it yet," he de
clared. "This Santa Clara game on Sat
urday will be your opportunity to demon
strate to the team your absolute con
viction that they have the stuff in them."
"The Ex Committee felt it was neces
sary to start the ball rolling," said Stan
ford Steinbeck in explaining the purpose
of the rally. "The Stanford spirit is here
all right; it just is not being exhibited.
We must create a winning spirit, and
we'll win all the way!"
"Tiny" Thornhill, line coach, expressed
the opinion that it was not necessary to
bawl out the student body, but that the
team, struggling against the difficulty of
numerous injuries, needs to be shown
that the student body is behind them.
"We have not had a whole team since
the West Coast Army game," he said,
"but we will have a good team to put up
against Santa Clara Saturday, and it is
up to you to be at that game and show
the fellows you're there."
Paul Speegle, yell leader, who declared
himself to be satisfied with the spirit of
the student body, led cheers for the team
and urged a complete turn-out for the
Santa Clara game.
