# GRIEF RUNS HIGH AS GLORIOUS TRADITIONS ARE TUMBLED DOWN
## 
### 
Another tradition tumbles the way
of all traditions!
Grief and disappointment run high
today at the news of the Daily Chapar
ral pigskin classic. It is not going to
be played! Alas! Such is sophistica
tion and indifference!
"We are too busy," lament some of
the scriveners. "There is no spirit,"
decry others. "The Daily athletes are
subsidized," moan the funny-men.
"They have 110 team this year," an
swer the journalists. "A sad situation,"
outsiders comment.
Amen.
