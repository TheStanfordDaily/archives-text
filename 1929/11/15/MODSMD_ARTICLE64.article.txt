# TOMORROW'S COAST GRIDIRON SCHEDULE
## 
### 
While the Indian is attempting
to ride the bucking Bronco in
the Stanford stadium tomorrow,
a rejuvenated Washington team
will trot out on the Berkeley
field for its last chance to win a
1929 Conference game. The
Golden Bear are the heavy fa
vorites, but so were the Cardi
nals last Saturday, and said Hus
kies may haul down the Blue
and Gold standard from the top
of the standings. In the north,
the state title of Oregon will be
at stake when the university and
the state college clash in their
annual "Big Game." At the same
time Washington State journeys
over to Missoula to fight the
Montana Grizzly.
