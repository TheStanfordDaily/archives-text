# STANFORD BAND USES UNIQUE INSTRUMENTS, MANY FOREIGN DRUMS
## 
### 
If the Stanford band does not always
sound right it is due to faulty execution
rather than to lack of proper and suffi
cient instruments, for the band has every
common musical instrument and many
very uncommon ones. Included in the
equipment of the organization are a Per
sian whip drum, a Scotch drum, an In
dian doukbar drum, a Turkish janissary
cymbal, and a glockenspiel. Next year
a contra bassoon, a contra clarinet, an
alto flute, and a quartet of alto and bass
trumpets, along with a heckelphone (ten
or oboe), will be added to complete the
ensemble. These latter can be obtained
only in Europe, according to Director
Ernest W. Martin. Martin remarks that
there remain to be added only the ophe
cleide and the sackbut.
Aside from these rare instruments the
band already has a very complete instru
mentation in all departments. There are
forty brasses, including French horns
and Fluegel horns, and the reed section
numbers fifty-six, with four bassoons,
four oboes, eight flutes, and alto and bass
clarinets.
