# California Works To Bolster Offense For Rejuvenated Huskies
## 
### 
BERKELEY, Nov. 14 (/P). â€”Expect-
ing one of the hardest battles of the sea
son against the Washington Huskies here
tomorrow, the University of California
eleven was gaining strength in its offen
sive tactics today, hoping for the best,
and preparing for possibly the worst.
Evidences that the Bears consider the
Huskies a serious threat to their Con
ference standing could be seen in the vim
and vigor with which they tossed and
punted and chased the pigskin around the
field in yesterday's practice. The session
did not end until long after the regular
dinner hour. Benny Loin, crack ball car
rier, kept five ends busy grabbing his
passes out of the air. Thornton and Nor
ton snagged them for a while, and then
Avery and Bartlett tried it, with White
relieving Bartlett.
Although the Washington squad will
outweigh the Bears by quite as much as
it outweighed the Stanford eleven last
week, the condition of the field will be
in favor of the California team, and the
result will probably be different from
that of the Stanford-Washington game
when the Cardinals were shoved around
on a wet, sandy gridiron.
