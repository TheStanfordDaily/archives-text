# Second Market Drop Merely Continuation Of Previous Decline
## 
### 
No additional significance should
be attached to the second drop in the
stock market, Dr. Murray S. Wild
man, head of the Department of Eco
nomics, Stanford University, stated
yesterday.
This second collapse is a continua
tion of the first, and the same eco
nomic conditions that accounted for
the latter hold for the former. More
than one drop is a natural occurrence,
that is parallelled by the histories of
previous collapses.
A third fall may or may not fol
low; it cannot be predicted, accord
ing to Dr. Wildman. Certain stocks
are not yet down to normal. Rise in
stocks may occur in one month or
perhaps not until six months. This
also cannot be foreseen.
The stock market situation is com
parable to the elastic property of a
rubber snapper, Dr. Wildman pointed
out. The more the rubber is pulled
back, the harder and longer will be
the return snap. In the same fashion,
the higher the stock market is pushed
up, the more severe will be its fall.
As seen in the Babson chart of
United States Business Conditions for
November 11, 1029, the stock market
quotations for 1929 are much higher
than in any previous. Consequently
the corresponding depression will be
more marked.
