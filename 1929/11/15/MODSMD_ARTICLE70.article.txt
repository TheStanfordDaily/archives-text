# HUSKIES LEAVE SEATTLE
## 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 13 (J-P). â€”
"Get the Bears" was the slogan of the
University of Washington football squad
which left Seattle late yesterday for
Berkeley to tangle with the undefeated
University of California grid eleven next
Saturday.
Thirty-three Huskies, headed by their
ictiring coach Enoch Bagshaw, were
given a rousing farewell reception at the
train depot as they departed on a 5,000-
mile trip to close the Washingten sea
son with two road games. The Husky
eleven plays its last contest with the Uni
versity of Chicago at Chicago Novem
ber 23.
The Purple and Gold team will be at
full strength for its final Pacific Coast
Conference game with the California
Bears and is given an outside chance for
victory by virtue of the Huskies' surpris
ing showing against Stanford last Sat
urday when they held the powerful Car
dinals to a 6 to 0 score.
Bill Bates, third-string center, was the
only member of the first three teams left
behind. Bates suffered a leg injury in
scrimmage Monday. Every other mem
ber of the squad was in good condition.
