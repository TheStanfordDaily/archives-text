# SOCCER VARSITY TO PLAY CAL BEARS IN SECOND 'BIG' GAME
## Twenty-Seven Cardinals Will Invade U.C. Tomorrow For Crucial Test 
### Robert Ricklefs 
Twenty-seven members of the Stan
ford varsity soccer squad, led by As
sistant Coach Ward Smith, will in
vade the Berkeley campus tomorrow
to fight out the second contest of the
annual three-game series with the
Zamloch-coached golden bear eleven.
The game, which will be played on
the new varsity field, will commence
at 1 o'clock.
In spite of the fact that the first
game of the series played last Satur
day ended in a scoreless tie, the
Cards are favored to win because of
the slight edge they held over the
Bears throughout most of the contest.
The defensive work of the Stanford
backs is the best that has been seen
on the local field this year. Attesting
to this is the fact that opposing teams
have scored less than one goal per
game against the Redshirts this sea
son.
Offense Weak
On the other hand, the Cardinal
shin-bruisers have been noticeably
weak on offensive during the past few
games. At times, however, the for
wards exhibit a combination of flashy
teamwork that looks like a certain
scoring aggregation, and then just as
quickly, the flash will die out.
In the last two games the Card
coaches have shifted Eberhard, speedy
forward, from his old position at out
side right, to inside left, in order to
place him in a position to work with
Mujica, outside left. This change has
worked considerable improvement in
the offensive.
Judging from the ease with which
Mujica and Eberhard have driven the
ball through the second-string de
fense during the scrimmages thiß
week, smooth teamwork is expected
in the game tomorrow.
Defensive Stars
One thing is certain. If the Card
offense can score one or two goals,
the game is as good as won, for the
defense is practically impenetrable.
With Captain Mayer, Wittausch,
Burns, and Christensen kicking the
ball out of danger as they did so ef
fectively in the game Saturday, the
Bears do not have much chance of
scoring a goal.
The one man on the Cal eleven that
will constantly be an individual threat
is Smart, inside right. His speedy
footwork and accurate passing have
marked him the individual star for
ward in every game he has played.

wards exhibit a combination of flashy
teamwork that looks like a certain
scoring aggregation, and then just as
quickly, the flash will die out.
In the last two games the Card
coaches have shifted Eberhard, speedy
forward, from his old position at out
side right, to inside left, in order to
place him in a position to work with
Mujica, outside left. This change has
worked considerable improvement in
the offensive.
Judging from the ease with which
Mujica and Eberhard have driven the
ball through the second-string de
fense during the scrimmages thiß
week, smooth teamwork is expected
in the game tomorrow.
Defensive Stars
One thing is certain. If the Card
offense can score one or two goals,
the game is as good as won, for the
defense is practically impenetrable.
With Captain Mayer, Wittausch,
Burns, and Christensen kicking the
ball out of danger as they did so ef
fectively in the game Saturday, the
Bears do not have much chance of
scoring a goal.
The one man on the Cal eleven that
will constantly be an individual threat
is Smart, inside right. His speedy
footwork and accurate passing have
marked him the individual star for
ward in every game he has played.
Twenty-seven members of the Stan
ford varsity soccer squad, led by As
sistant Coach Ward Smith, will in
vade the Berkeley campus tomorrow
to fight out the second contest of the
annual three-game series with the
Zamloch-coached golden bear eleven.
The game, which will be played on
the new varsity field, will commence
at 1 o'clock.
In spite of the fact that the first
game of the series played last Satur
day ended in a scoreless tie, the
Cards are favored to win because of
the slight edge they held over the
Bears throughout most of the contest.
The defensive work of the Stanford
backs is the best that has been seen
on the local field this year. Attesting
to this is the fact that opposing teams
have scored less than one goal per
game against the Redshirts this sea
son.
Offense Weak
On the other hand, the Cardinal
shin-bruisers have been noticeably
weak on offensive during the past few
games. At times, however, the for
wards exhibit a combination of flashy
teamwork that looks like a certain
scoring aggregation, and then just as
quickly, the flash will die out.
