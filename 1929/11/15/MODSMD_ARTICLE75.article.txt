# HOLLYWOOD CHALLENGE WILL MAKE STAGE PLAYS BETTER---MAE WEST
## 
### Bernard Pollard 
"The movies have aided the stage by
making the public stage-smart," declared
Mae West in an interview at the Curran
Theater in San Francisco late yesterday
afternoon.
"Several years ago exaggerated ges
tures and facial contortions were neces
sary to make the public understand. To
day even a small gesture means much.
Hollywood has given the legitimate stage
a challenge. As a result the plays of the
future will be fewer and better.
"Everything progresses. Things are not
pushed aside, but built upon. This is a
pretty good old world and there is no
reason on earth to be dismayed at the
passing of old tilings. The day of the
"Ham" actor has gone forever. A new
school of play writing and production
has been ushered in. Colleges are play
ing an important part in the movement.
"Public speaking and dramatic courses
are important parts of an education.
They give poise and grace needed in the
professional world. Every lawyer should
have stage experience, not to assist him
in deceiving a jury but in convincing
them that he is right.
"We live in a fast age and all of us
are under a certain action which is
neither too restrained nor too exagger
ated. There must be constant movement
on the stage, a sustained interest. The
illusion of reality must be created."
Miss West is a beautiful blonde, pleas
antly plump and unfortunately misunder
stood. She has spent twenty-two of her
thirty years on the stage. At eight she
was imitating Eddie Foy and Bert Wil-

I liams. She danced into the bright lights
of Broadway and unlike many others has
remained.
"I wrote a play called 'Sex'," Miss
West said. "It was a hit and the box
returns big. For business reasons which
every successful producer understands,
professional jealousy, and because the
police claimed that we were corrupting
[ the morals of youth, I spent ten days in
i the workhouse for women on Welfare
Island. The time was spent to advantage.
Jails are mines for authors.
" 'Drag' was perhaps a little prema
ture. It dealt with a vital problem, the
homosexual. It is my belief that if this
phenomenon is a disease then it is up to
psychologists and doctors to find out
what it is and cure it. It is a good rule

to face problems, not to avoid them. I
want the public to understand or at least
to stimulate a desire to understand. Pro
fessor Burton of Columbia University
declared that 'Drag' was a masterpiece.
"When 1 wrote 'Diamond Lil* I deter
mined to bring it to the Pacific Coast.
This is the first time I have ever been
here. I like it very much. From San
Francisco we go to Los Angeles where
the play will be filmed. I am not sure
whether I will like the talkies for my
self but I have always suportcd them.
Hollywood has taught America how to
dress. She will now teach them how to
speak."
