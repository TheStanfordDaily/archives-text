# AFRICAN BLACK MAGIC IS SUBJECT OF TALK BY MRS. J. FLETCHER
## 
### 
Witch doctors are really the most im
portant officials in the tribes in British
Central Africa, according to Mrs. John
Fletcher, who discussed before the Eng
lish Club last night the book "Black
Magic and Witchcraft" which she is now
writing.
Mrs. Fletcher visited Central Africa
last year, accompanied only by native
porters, in search of material for her
subject. She found that the natives in
this part of the continent have remained
untouched by Christianity. The body of
a particularly notable man is frequently
disinterred and his brains and heart are
consumed by those who desire his par
ticular attributes.
Mrs. Charles McGettigan, composer
known as Francisca Vallejo, and Miss
Grace Boles Hedge, dramatic soprano,
rendered several African melodies which
Mrs. Fletcher had brought back with her.
A piano solo by Chester Blackmail con
cluded the program.
