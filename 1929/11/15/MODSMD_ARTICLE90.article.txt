# LOVE-TANGLE FOUND TO BE YEAR'S MOST BAFFLING MYSTERY
## 
### 
Delightful romance hangs to the
bewildering case of lost identity
which was encountered in the office
of the Dean of Men recently.
The problem which confronts ad
ministration detectives la this: who
is the Stanford man among those who
registered for the first timo this fall
who could not banish the thought of
a certain Stanford woman long
enough to write his own name on his
photograph in the registrar's office?
Nervous preoccupation is no name
for the state in which this miserable
man must have been when he signed
his photographâ€”well, Blue-eyed Susie,
for convenience. And now the picture
has been returned to the Dean's of
fice from the Dean of Women's office
where the name of the photograph
was identified as belonging to a cer
tain member of the Five Hundred.
It would seem as if the only solution
were to call on known woman to
identify the unknown man! Unless he
was only a worshipper-from-afar.
