# TWO DOZEN FERRETS ARE TO BE USED IN 'PSYCH' EXPERIMENTS
## 
### William French 
Within the past week, two dozen fer
rets have been imported from an animal
farm in Ohio for experimental purposes
in the psychology laboratories.
"As far as we know this will be the
first time the ferret has been used in the
study of animal psychology," Dr. Wal
ter R. Miles, professor of experimental
psychology, stated. The little animal
seems to be a good subject for experi
mentation, but of course our tests are in
the preliminary stages and the results
are still very problematical."
The ferret, a weasel-like animal, was
chosen as a suitable one to compare with
the white rat, which is so commonly used
in experiments, because the two animals
are of about the same size and have the
same amount of spontaneous activity
when used with mazes and revolving
cages. However, the ferret is unlike the
rat, a rodent, in that it is carnivorous and
prefers to kill its own food.
The object of these tests will be to
determine the ferret's capacity for
learned reactions and later on his reac
tions to drug stimulants. Dr. C. P.
Stone, who has done considerable work
in animal psychology, is prepared to
study the problems in relation to other
animals, while Dr. Miles, through his
interest in drugs, has been selecting suit
able methods for testing the ferret's re
actions to such stimuli.
"The learned reactions, not the re
flexes, are what we are interested in,"
Miles said. "Learning is really nothing
more than shortening of the processes
through experience; so we put the fer
ret in a maze and let him find his way
to a piece of meat in a cage at the end.
By repeating this, the animal soon learns
to find his way with a certain amount of
rapidity.
"We expect to be able to ohserve t' - .c
reactions caused by certain drugs and the
relative effects of the drugs by sending
the ferret through the maze under nor
mal conditions and then giving it some
injection, such as morphine, and sending
it through again fifteen or twenty min- j
utes later."

to a piece of meat in a cage at the end.
By repeating this, the animal soon learns
to find his way with a certain amount of
rapidity.
"We expect to be able to ohserve t' - .c
reactions caused by certain drugs and the
relative effects of the drugs by sending
the ferret through the maze under nor
mal conditions and then giving it some
injection, such as morphine, and sending
it through again fifteen or twenty min- j
utes later."
Within the past week, two dozen fer
rets have been imported from an animal
farm in Ohio for experimental purposes
in the psychology laboratories.
"As far as we know this will be the
first time the ferret has been used in the
study of animal psychology," Dr. Wal
ter R. Miles, professor of experimental
psychology, stated. The little animal
seems to be a good subject for experi
mentation, but of course our tests are in
the preliminary stages and the results
are still very problematical."
The ferret, a weasel-like animal, was
chosen as a suitable one to compare with
the white rat, which is so commonly used
in experiments, because the two animals
are of about the same size and have the
same amount of spontaneous activity
when used with mazes and revolving
cages. However, the ferret is unlike the
rat, a rodent, in that it is carnivorous and
prefers to kill its own food.
The object of these tests will be to
determine the ferret's capacity for
learned reactions and later on his reac
tions to drug stimulants. Dr. C. P.
Stone, who has done considerable work
in animal psychology, is prepared to
study the problems in relation to other
animals, while Dr. Miles, through his
interest in drugs, has been selecting suit
able methods for testing the ferret's re
actions to such stimuli.
"The learned reactions, not the re
flexes, are what we are interested in,"
Miles said. "Learning is really nothing
more than shortening of the processes
through experience; so we put the fer
ret in a maze and let him find his way
to a piece of meat in a cage at the end.
By repeating this, the animal soon learns
