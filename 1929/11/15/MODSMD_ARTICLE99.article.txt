# NATURAL GAS MAY BE SUBSTITUTED FOR OIL AS POWERHOUSE FUEL
## 
### 
Natural gas is being seriously consid
ered as a substitute for oil as a fuel at
the campus power house, according to an
announcement made by Comptroller Al
mon E. Roth yesterday.
The oil that has been used as fuel has
been brought to the power house from
Palo Alto over the tracks of the lately
abandoned street car system. The tear
ing up of the tracks leading into Palo
Alto lias necessitated the bringing of the
oil cars from Mayiield and, as it is pro
posed to tear up these tracks when the
state highway is widened next spring,
this method will have to be entirely aban
doned.
1 he oil could be either piped in or
brought in by trucks but the Pacific Gas
and Electric Company has offered the
University a contract that would make
gas a decidedly cheaper fuel than oil.
