—HAS MADE HIS MARK IN TALKING PICTURES
... A MOST CONSPICUOUS MARK . . . WITH
'SO THIS IS COLLEGE' I
—And please be assured that STANFORD in this
picture gets its chance to tell the world.
"SO THIS IS COLLEGE" (don't let the title
fool you) is the funniest expose of college love
ever presented. It has all the elements of campus
life—and while they are dramatically treated the
entire process is tempered with reason.
The names of Stanford and U.S.C. have been re
tained throughout the story. And the big game
between these teams, together with their familiar
yells and songs, provides some extremely thrilling
moments.
