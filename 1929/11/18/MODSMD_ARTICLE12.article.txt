# Student Scalpers May Cause Ticket Quota Limitation
## Increase of Offenders This Year Likely to Bring Actionâ€”Masters 
### 
That the open scalping of Big Game
tickets prevalent on the campus this
year must inevitably lead to the limit
ing of students to one rooter's ticket
is the opinion expressed by Alfred R.
Masters, general manager of the
Board of Athletic Control.
"Scalping by students has been
more in evidence this season than
ever before," said Masters yesterday,
"as is borne out by the appearance
of numerous signs on living group
bulletin boards offering tickets at
three times the original price. Alumni
who are unable to purcliase v these
tickets complain that the students are
putting them to an illegitimate use,
and ask that they be given the oppor
tunity to buy them.
"The Board of Athletic Control has
neither the inclination nor the time
to play policeman. The only solution
that I can see is to have those stu
dents who are employing their two
tickets in legitimate fashion report
scalpers themselves. Because, when
the Board meets after this season to
discuss the ticket problem, the pro
posal will come up, as it has from
year to year, to limit the student
body to rooters' tickets, and allow the
alumni to purchase the remaining
tickets thus made available. And this
year, the argument in favor of such
an action will be undeniably strong."
