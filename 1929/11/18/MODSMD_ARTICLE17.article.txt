# BRIDGE OVER SAN FRANCISQUITO TO BE READY TODAY
## New Concrete Span Is 30 Feet Wide With Two 4-Foot Walks 
### 
The new San Francisquito Creek
bridge, connecting the campus with
the Portola road, will be opened for
traffic officially today. The old struc
ture, which collapsed last spring
when a sight-seeing bus proved too
heavy for its supports, has been re
placed with a "Class A" concrete
bridge, according to Collins and Mar
tin, contractors. Santa Clara and San
Mateo counties are dividing equally
the expense of $27,325.
Thfc roadway proper of the new
bridge is 30 feet wide; 4-foot side
walks are on both sides. It is 158 feet
6 inches in length and is built in three
spans. The structure is of such good
material that it will last indefinitely,
declares William Martin, contractor.
The removal of lumber underpinnings
is all that remains to be done.
The sharp curve of the old bridge
has been eliminated in the new one,
and GSO feet of waterbound macadam
have been laid for approaches on the
Santa Clara County and San Mateo
County side. The roadways are 40
feet in width. Three weeks' work of
excavating with a steam shovel was
done on the San Mateo side of the
creek. Big Game traffic will help to
settle these approaches, it is hoped.
