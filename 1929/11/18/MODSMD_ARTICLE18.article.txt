# CARD SOCCER VARSITY BEATEN BY BEARS IN SECOND CONTEST 5-3
## 
### 
Picking holes in a defense that has
been considered impenetrable all sea
son, California's soccer team ran wild
through the Stanford varsity eleven
to win 5-3 in the second contest of
the annual three-game series Satur
day at Berkeley. The game was pre
liminary to the Washington-California
conference football game.
The Blue and Gold eleven started
the scoring early in the first half when
Smart, Cal inside left, took the ball
into Cardinal territory and succeeded
in a difficult try for goal.
Toepke evened things up Immedi
ately by taking a corner pass from
Eberhard and driving it into the Bear
net. With the first period half over,
the Berkeley team took the lead again
on a goal resulting from a series of
short kicks. Stanford tied up the
score a second later when Miller took
the ball from a mixup in front of the
net and booted it safely past the
goalie. Smart regained the lead for
the Bears late in the half with a long
kick from the side.
The Bears' two goals in the second
half both resulted from long, hard,
unstoppable drives down the field.
The last Card tally came late in the
half on a sideline run by Mujica and
Eberhard.
The Stanford lineup: Williams,
goal; Wittausch and Dalton, full
backs; Christensen, Mayer, and
Plumb, halfbacks; Nichols, Miller,
Toepke, Mujica, and Eberhard, for
wards. Substitutes, Jackson, Vellenga,
O'Donnell, Reynolds, and Lemmon.
