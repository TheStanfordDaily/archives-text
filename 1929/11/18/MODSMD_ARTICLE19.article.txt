# Sequoia Wake Head Plans New Burial For U.C. Bruin
## 
### 
A new style of burial for the Berke
ley Bruin is promised for the Sequoia
Wake this year by Stan Swain, chair
man of the Sequoia Wake Committee.
Hints of an Indian burial with a troop
of yelling savages making whoopee
around the Blue and Gold casket are
all the information available now, but
definite plans for the sacred cere
mony will be announced soon.
"We will have the old coffin, but
a new type of stunt with lots of
noise," the committees confided, "and
when we are finished the Cal team
won't have a prayer left for the Big
Game."
