# CARD VARSITY HAS NEW RED BREECHES
## 
### 
From Pop Warner comes the an
nouncement that when the Stanford
varsity takes the field against Cali
fornia in the Big Game Saturday, the
Cards' football pants will be a flam
ing red hue in place of the customary
khaki color.
The restoration of red to the var
sity's uniform marks the first time
since the 1927 season, when the white
Jerseys were adopted, that the foot
ball team has worn Stanford's color
on the gridiron.
