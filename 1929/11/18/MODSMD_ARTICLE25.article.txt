# CARD 13-7 UPSET LEAVES U.C. BIG GAME FAVORITES
## Redshirts Offer No Excuse; Santa Clara Team Shows Its Power in Pass Attack Pop Orders Week of Secret Practice to Start After Rally Planned for Today 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Although upset in its final test be
fore the Big Game and doped by a
majority of the Coast gridiron critics
as a huge favorite to fall before the
Golden Bear on the 23rd, Coach Pop
Warner's big Cardinal varsity will
settle down to practice again today
with but one thought in mind —to beat
California!
Stiff practice sessions are in store
for the Redshirts during the next few
days, beginning with an hour's scrim
mage this afternoon. Pop is not only
desirous of adding a few finishing
touches to the offense of his football
machine but must oil up some rusty
cogs in the pass defense as well. Fol
lowing today's practice, at which a
student pep rally will be held, the
team will work out behind barred
gates for the remainder of the week.
Score No Fluke
As for last Saturday's final Big
Game test, the fighting Cards failed
by inches to tame a stubborn yet
fiery Bronc in a game filled with more
thrills than a first-class rodeo. Santa
Clara was theb etter team on the
field that day, and it was through no
fluke that the score read Broncs 13,
Cards 7 when the final gun sounded.
It was a combination of psychologi
cal factors that largely led to Stan
ford's downfall. The Redshirts at
tempted to take the Mission squad in
stride, their real interest being on a
game to be played one week in the
future. At the same time, Santa Clara
was pointed for Stanford. Knowing
that the Cards would be off guard,
Clipper Smith's boys put everything
they had into the game to trip up
their opponents from the Farm.
No Alibis Offered
However, Stanford offers no alibi.
The Broncs were unexpectedly strong,
both on defense and offense, and it
was the playing of a great line that
proved the margin of victory. Inspired
by the work of such men as Tassi,
Ruffo, and O'Daniels, the forward wall
refused to give before the hard
smashing of the Cardinal backs and
at least six times checked Stanford
within easy scoring distance.
On the other hand, the Cards
seemed to lack final scoring punch
against the Broncs. Time and again
they would march down the turf to
within the twenty-yard line, only to
lose the ball on downs by inches be
cause of more or less ragged team
work. Yet, several bad breaks kept
down Stanford's end of the scoring,
one of them coming at the close of
the first half. The Cards had the ball
on Santa Clara's one-yard line with
three downs to go, when the gun
sounded to rob them of a certain
touchdown.
Mettler Stars
Perhaps the outstanding star of the
day was Herm Mettler, at halfback
for Santa Clara. Besides getting off
some nice punts, knocking down
passes on defense, and making a cou
ple of lengthy runs, Mettler tossed
some of the best passes seen around
these parts in a long time. His passes
were of the bullet variety, which all
too frequently landed right in the
arms of some Bronc. Both of Santa
Clara's scores were made on passes
tossed by this same Mr. Mettler.
For Stanford, Captain Mush Muller
played his usual good game on offense,
and once again proved that he is one
of the outstanding pigskin snaggers
on the Pacific Coast. In fact, the
whole Card line came through with a
fair game of ball. Ray Tandy showed
up well on defensive work, as did
Walt Heinecke. Several of the re
serves, who started the game, also
looked good. Perry Taylor, until he
was injured, Dick Bogue, and Ted Kla
bau showed to good advantage in
breaking up the Bronc line smashes.
Injuries Not Serious
In the backfield, Chuck Smalling
and Phil Moffatt stole the show for
the Cards. Time after time Smalling
ploughed through the strong Mission
line, and at the same time made more
than his share of the tackles. Besides
scoring Stanford's lone touchdown,
Moffatt punted well and got away for
some lengthy runs. Several times he
would have been away to the races if
his interference had been clicking
better. Harry Hillman did some heavy
line battering, but his fumbles were
a costly handicap.
Although Stanford received her
weekly quota of injuries, none of
them, with the possible exception of
Taylor's, are expected to slow up the
Cards for the Big Game. Taylor, who
has been laid up at the Paly Hospital
since the game, sustained a torn rib
ligament that may keep him on the
bench Saturday. Heineckle got off
with a slightly bruised knee, while
Rintala was forced out of the game
with a twisted ankle.

ploughed through the strong Mission
line, and at the same time made more
than his share of the tackles. Besides
scoring Stanford's lone touchdown,
Moffatt punted well and got away for
some lengthy runs. Several times he
would have been away to the races if
his interference had been clicking
better. Harry Hillman did some heavy
line battering, but his fumbles were
a costly handicap.
Although Stanford received her
weekly quota of injuries, none of
them, with the possible exception of
Taylor's, are expected to slow up the
Cards for the Big Game. Taylor, who
has been laid up at the Paly Hospital
since the game, sustained a torn rib
ligament that may keep him on the
bench Saturday. Heineckle got off
with a slightly bruised knee, while
Rintala was forced out of the game
with a twisted ankle.
Although upset in its final test be
fore the Big Game and doped by a
majority of the Coast gridiron critics
as a huge favorite to fall before the
Golden Bear on the 23rd, Coach Pop
Warner's big Cardinal varsity will
settle down to practice again today
with but one thought in mind —to beat
California!
Stiff practice sessions are in store
for the Redshirts during the next few
days, beginning with an hour's scrim
mage this afternoon. Pop is not only
desirous of adding a few finishing
touches to the offense of his football
machine but must oil up some rusty
cogs in the pass defense as well. Fol
lowing today's practice, at which a
student pep rally will be held, the
team will work out behind barred
gates for the remainder of the week.
Score No Fluke
As for last Saturday's final Big
Game test, the fighting Cards failed
by inches to tame a stubborn yet
fiery Bronc in a game filled with more
thrills than a first-class rodeo. Santa
Clara was theb etter team on the
field that day, and it was through no
fluke that the score read Broncs 13,
Cards 7 when the final gun sounded.
It was a combination of psychologi
cal factors that largely led to Stan
ford's downfall. The Redshirts at
tempted to take the Mission squad in
stride, their real interest being on a
game to be played one week in the
future. At the same time, Santa Clara
was pointed for Stanford. Knowing
that the Cards would be off guard,
Clipper Smith's boys put everything
they had into the game to trip up
their opponents from the Farm.
No Alibis Offered
However, Stanford offers no alibi.
The Broncs were unexpectedly strong,
both on defense and offense, and it
was the playing of a great line that
proved the margin of victory. Inspired
by the work of such men as Tassi,
Ruffo, and O'Daniels, the forward wall
refused to give before the hard
smashing of the Cardinal backs and
at least six times checked Stanford
within easy scoring distance.
On the other hand, the Cards
seemed to lack final scoring punch
against the Broncs. Time and again
they would march down the turf to
within the twenty-yard line, only to
lose the ball on downs by inches be
cause of more or less ragged team
work. Yet, several bad breaks kept
down Stanford's end of the scoring,
one of them coming at the close of
the first half. The Cards had the ball
on Santa Clara's one-yard line with
three downs to go, when the gun
sounded to rob them of a certain
touchdown.
Mettler Stars
Perhaps the outstanding star of the
day was Herm Mettler, at halfback
for Santa Clara. Besides getting off
some nice punts, knocking down
passes on defense, and making a cou
ple of lengthy runs, Mettler tossed
some of the best passes seen around
these parts in a long time. His passes
were of the bullet variety, which all
too frequently landed right in the
arms of some Bronc. Both of Santa
Clara's scores were made on passes
tossed by this same Mr. Mettler.
For Stanford, Captain Mush Muller
played his usual good game on offense,
and once again proved that he is one
of the outstanding pigskin snaggers
on the Pacific Coast. In fact, the
whole Card line came through with a
fair game of ball. Ray Tandy showed
up well on defensive work, as did
Walt Heinecke. Several of the re
serves, who started the game, also
looked good. Perry Taylor, until he
was injured, Dick Bogue, and Ted Kla
bau showed to good advantage in
breaking up the Bronc line smashes.
Injuries Not Serious
In the backfield, Chuck Smalling
and Phil Moffatt stole the show for
the Cards. Time after time Smalling
ploughed through the strong Mission
line, and at the same time made more
than his share of the tackles. Besides

For Stanford, Captain Mush Muller
played his usual good game on offense,
and once again proved that he is one
of the outstanding pigskin snaggers
on the Pacific Coast. In fact, the
whole Card line came through with a
fair game of ball. Ray Tandy showed
up well on defensive work, as did
Walt Heinecke. Several of the re
serves, who started the game, also
looked good. Perry Taylor, until he
was injured, Dick Bogue, and Ted Kla
bau showed to good advantage in
breaking up the Bronc line smashes.
Injuries Not Serious
In the backfield, Chuck Smalling
and Phil Moffatt stole the show for
the Cards. Time after time Smalling
ploughed through the strong Mission
line, and at the same time made more
than his share of the tackles. Besides
scoring Stanford's lone touchdown,
Moffatt punted well and got away for
some lengthy runs. Several times he
would have been away to the races if
his interference had been clicking
better. Harry Hillman did some heavy
line battering, but his fumbles were
a costly handicap.
Although Stanford received her
weekly quota of injuries, none of
them, with the possible exception of
Taylor's, are expected to slow up the
Cards for the Big Game. Taylor, who
has been laid up at the Paly Hospital
since the game, sustained a torn rib
ligament that may keep him on the
bench Saturday. Heineckle got off
with a slightly bruised knee, while
Rintala was forced out of the game
with a twisted ankle.
Although upset in its final test be
fore the Big Game and doped by a
majority of the Coast gridiron critics
as a huge favorite to fall before the
Golden Bear on the 23rd, Coach Pop
Warner's big Cardinal varsity will
settle down to practice again today
with but one thought in mind —to beat
California!
Stiff practice sessions are in store
for the Redshirts during the next few
days, beginning with an hour's scrim
mage this afternoon. Pop is not only
desirous of adding a few finishing
touches to the offense of his football
machine but must oil up some rusty
cogs in the pass defense as well. Fol
lowing today's practice, at which a
student pep rally will be held, the
team will work out behind barred
gates for the remainder of the week.
Score No Fluke
As for last Saturday's final Big
Game test, the fighting Cards failed
by inches to tame a stubborn yet
fiery Bronc in a game filled with more
thrills than a first-class rodeo. Santa
Clara was theb etter team on the
field that day, and it was through no
fluke that the score read Broncs 13,
Cards 7 when the final gun sounded.
It was a combination of psychologi
cal factors that largely led to Stan
ford's downfall. The Redshirts at
tempted to take the Mission squad in
stride, their real interest being on a
game to be played one week in the
future. At the same time, Santa Clara
was pointed for Stanford. Knowing
that the Cards would be off guard,
Clipper Smith's boys put everything
they had into the game to trip up
their opponents from the Farm.
No Alibis Offered
However, Stanford offers no alibi.
The Broncs were unexpectedly strong,
both on defense and offense, and it
was the playing of a great line that
proved the margin of victory. Inspired
by the work of such men as Tassi,
Ruffo, and O'Daniels, the forward wall
refused to give before the hard
smashing of the Cardinal backs and
at least six times checked Stanford
within easy scoring distance.
On the other hand, the Cards
seemed to lack final scoring punch
against the Broncs. Time and again
they would march down the turf to
within the twenty-yard line, only to
lose the ball on downs by inches be
cause of more or less ragged team
work. Yet, several bad breaks kept
down Stanford's end of the scoring,
one of them coming at the close of
the first half. The Cards had the ball
on Santa Clara's one-yard line with
three downs to go, when the gun
sounded to rob them of a certain
touchdown.
Mettler Stars
Perhaps the outstanding star of the
day was Herm Mettler, at halfback
for Santa Clara. Besides getting off
some nice punts, knocking down
passes on defense, and making a cou
ple of lengthy runs, Mettler tossed
some of the best passes seen around
these parts in a long time. His passes
were of the bullet variety, which all
too frequently landed right in the
arms of some Bronc. Both of Santa
Clara's scores were made on passes
tossed by this same Mr. Mettler.
