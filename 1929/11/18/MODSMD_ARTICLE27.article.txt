# THE 						HANDWRITING ON THE WALL
## 
### 
Stanford students may well view with alarm the announcement car
ried in the news columns of today's Daily that the open scalping of
Big Game tickets must inevitably lead to the limiting of students to one
rooter's ticket. It is more than an annual threat.
It is not necessary for the General Manager of the Board of Athletic
Control to point out that "scalping has been more in evidence this season
than ever before." All one needs to do is notice the bulletin boards at
any of the halls, or to hear the bids offered at fraternity houses, to get
evidence of how open the "scalping" is. Managers of various Palo Alto
eating-houses are said to be offering tickets for thirty dollars ($3O)
apiece. Stanford athletes are seeking the highest bidders.
The General Manager states that "the Board of Athletic Control has
neither the inclination nor the time to play policeman." His point is
well taken as it is outside the province of the B.A.C. to check up on
the scalpers.
Students pledge their word that they will not re-sell the tickets at
a premium when they sign their applications. That the Honor Code
should extend to every activity on the campus cannot be expected.
Neither can it be hoped that "those students who are employing their
two tickets in a legitimate fashion report the scalpers" as Mr. Masters
suggests. That is a remedy but it is only a pipe dream, we are ashamed
to admit, as it would involve practically every student in the University.
There is only one solution. Limit the students to one rooter's ticket
apiece for two or three years and see what effect it will have on scalping
when they are given the opportunity to purchase two additional tickets.
Such action seems wanton and cruel but it is the handwriting on the wall.
