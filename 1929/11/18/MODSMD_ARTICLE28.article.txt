# THE
						CARDINAL IS WAVING
## 
### 
Spirit which manifested itself at the Santa Clara unpleasantness
proved conclusively that Stanford students do support their team to the
last minute of play. And that they have always been behind the team,
although for a while they did not make a big noise about it.
But now that the realyl significant battle is imminent, there is no
inhibiting of spirit in any form. Stanford will back its team from now
until the final gun of the Big Game. That fact was made known to the
team Saturday, and can be further impressed at the rally today.
By attending the practice-field cheer session today, we can see the
team in action for the last time before the important game, and show just
how much we are supporting it.
