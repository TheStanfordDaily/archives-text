# BUILDING THE BONFIRE IS A CHALLENGE TO THE FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Stanford freshmen, who have been subjected to editorial frowns
from the Daily twice this quarter for not directing their burning en
thusiasm into proper channels, go 011 trial before the student body this
morning. Today the construction of the Big Game Bonfire officially
starts.
While the pyre this year becomes more of an A.S.S.U. function than
formerly, as the director is the student body president, the brunt of the
actual work falls upon the freshmen. It is up to them to get behind this
project as all Stanford freshmen have done. The size and the time for
building the bonfire have been limited. This should be welcomed by the
freshmen but it means that they will have to redouble their efforts to
make the fire a success.
Half of their energy and time should be spent on building and the
other half on guarding. It is the common impression that if this year's
bonfire is prematurely burned, Stanford will go without Big Game pyres
for some time. An alert, challenging group of guards, who would be
suspicious of even their own mothers, would save the fire from going up
before Wednesday night and would also save the feelings of several
groups from being injured by nasty accusations, such as the Rally Com
mittee, the Freshman Class, the University of California, and the Execu
tive Committee, which is sponsoring the project.
Just how real the spirit of the freshmen is can be determined by the
method and the attitude they take in making this year's Big Game Bonfire
a roaring success. Were their two previous outbursts indications of sin
cere, whole-hearted "do or die spirit" or were they exhibits of hang
overs from high-school days?
