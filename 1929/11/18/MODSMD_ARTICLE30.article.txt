# MAINLY CONCERNING CAMPUS OPINIONS
## 
### 
S-sh. S-sh. Dame Rumor, that convenient person used by reporters
when there is no reliable authority to quote in their news stories, is at
work again. She has it that the Daily is all against Stanford Spirit, that
the Daily is trying so hard to be a metropolitan paper that it turns up its
long nose at mere trifles such as the Stanford Spirit. S-sh. S-sh.
Parodoxically Dame Rumor bases her contentions on the fact that
there was a lot of space devoted in last Thursday's paper to the Stanford
Spirit and the rally held at the Engineering corner. But in Friday's
paper there was no mention of the Spirit and there campus opinions by
the carloads were sent in and the Daily "refused to print them." There
fore it must be against Stanford Spirit.
This old Dame is partially right. There were "carloads" of campus
opinions received Thursday, four letters in fact, and they were not
printed. But not because the Daily is against Stanford Spirit.
The Campus Opinion column is open to any person on this campus.
For obvious reasons these letters must be signed by the writers. If they
do not wish their real names to appear in the paper, a pseudonym will be
used. Those messages sent to the Daily for Friday's issue did not bear
the signatures of the writers and were immediately cast into the waste
basket along with the publicity regarding dog races at Tia Juana.
So there Dame Rumor! Pull up your skirts and run somewhere else
with your stories. The Daily also has Cardinal blood trickling through
its veins.
