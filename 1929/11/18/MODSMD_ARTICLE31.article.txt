"THEY HAD TO SEE PARIS" at the
New Stanford Theatre.
This is one show that is not a disap
pointment. Although the audience
won't let Will Rogers open his mouth
without giving him a laugh, his bright
cracks go over because they deserve
to, as well as because he is famous
as America's most popular humorist.
Will Rogers is good and he is en
tertainingly, sometimes charmingly,
funny. Ordinarily, a "one man show"
is a little irritating, but Will Rogers
is so utterly natural that it is easy
to forgive him for making practical
nonentities out of the other charac
ters.
Irene Rich and Margaret Churchill
are decorative, but slightly inane at
times. The sparkling little French
siren, who throws herself at the head
of the rich "Americeen" in Paris, is
the best of the women actors.

A HUMBLE LEAR. Lorna Doone
Beers. Dutton, publishers, New
York, 1929.
"Of all sad words of tongue or pen,
The saddest are these, it might have
been."
After reading '"A ■ Humble Lear"
one is inclined to agree with Whittier.
These much-quoted lines from his fa
mous Maud Muller practically sum up
Miss Doone's novel —and a sadder
book would be hard to find.
The plot is excessively simple.
Adam, a Minnesota farmer, has
dreamed from his youth of owning a
great homestead, with a devoted fam
ily supporting him and carrying on
his work. None of his dreams are
fulfilled: his wife, repelled by his
crudeness, does not appreciate his
strength and honesty, and treats him
with humiliating disdain and Alcorn.
His children, a la Shakespeare, cheat,
mock, and desert him.
This theme has been worn thread
bare, but distinguished by the intense
seriousness and conviction that the
author uses in her treatment of it, an
excellent novel results. In its early
pages the book is somber and dreary,
but later the author's style, without
losing its power, is masked by a
quiet, serene tone that adds warmth
and beauty to the story.
Tim book is streaked with pas
sages that dig down deep into the
reader's memory, and stay there. An
example is the scene of the death of

Adam's wife, where she sees life for
the first time in its true perspective
—when it is too late. The tragedy of
the whole book lies in the fact that
everything happens "too late." The
most serious defect of the story is its
lack of humor. Although it is not by
any means great literature, and even
has a tendency to dawdle, it has
"spots" that can be read several
times.

THE DARK JOURNEY. By Julien
Green. Harpers, New York, 1929.
At the Alcove Book Shop.
An optimist wouldn't and a pessi
mist shouldn't read "Dark Journey."
It is a book without a cheerful word,
without a smile, without happiness
of any sort.
The author's chief concern is the
analysis of characters who are so
abnormal that they seem pathologi
cal cases rather than human beings.
The hero is a repressed, thwarted
creature who finds life unbearably
drab and narrow, hating his wife, his
home, and his work. A sinister in
teraction of circumstances with the
forces of his warped nature leads him
to commit two atrocities —the muti
lating of the girl he insanely loves,
and the killing of an innocent old
man. The penalty he pays is very
stark, for although he escapes legal
consequences, he is drawn back to
the scene of his crime, and hangs
around the disfigured, ruined girl, tor
turing himself and her into madness.
Two other characters are as un
balanced and unnatural as the hero.
One of them, the proprietor of an
eating house, is like a loathsome old
spider; she sits at her post in the
midst of her patrons, and sucks from
them their money, their independence,
even their thoughts. The other char
acter is more revolting than this be
cause of the horrible pleasure that
she takes in seeing human suffering.
However, "Dark Journey" is too
strong a book to be eclipsed by its
morbidness. Discriminating readers
will appreciate the fine diction of the
book and the descriptive passages in
which moods of nature are employed
to serve as a background for emotion
al and psychological situations. The
fact that "Dark Journey" won the
Harper prize contest for 1929 also
should not be overlooked.
