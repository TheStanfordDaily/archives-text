## "HERE WE ARE AREN'T WE ALL" 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Three years ago I had the privilege
of being present at the Stanford-Ore
gon send-off rally when Hardy L.
Drumra, '95, was the principal speaker
on the program; if reports are true
that Drumm will speak at the Big
Game Rally this year, coming from

I such a distance as Siam as he did in
j 192G, Stanford students are due for a
! treat. "Room," as he was affection
ately balled, even by the present gen
eration of students, is a real rip
| snorting fervent alumnus of the old
type and should be able to inject some
1 real '95 Big Game spirit into the
I crowd this year. â€”'28.
