# ATTEND THE RALLY TODAY

The Editor, Sir:
I'm not a football authority, or I
would be writing in some other col
umn of this paper. However, there
are some facts which can be brought
together.
In the first place our rooters really
began to find themselves Saturday. If
during the first part of the game they
didn't work too hard, it was because
they didn't take the game seriously.
The team and Pop didn't either, so
the rooters can't be blamed; and dur
ing the second half they did get under
way in a manner which combined
with the larger section and the Big
Game atmosphere will win for us next
Saturday.
As to the team —California has
failed to prove satisfactorily that she
is the best team. The few of us who
went to the noon rally, heard why it
was Washington's day when we did
the visiting, and why we should not
be alarmed over our not too potent
showing against them. Now with their

| big game under their belts Washing
! ton comes down to Berkeley—away
from home and mother, and handi-
I capped by a mudless field really out
plays California.
We outplayed Santa Clara by a
yardage margin that was very de
j cided. Our running attack plowed
! right through the powerful Santa
| Clara line, as it hasn't in the last few
| games. The fatal let-ups near the goal
line were caused by the moving up of
| the secondary defense. This inability
1 to score was also disastrous in the
| U.S.C. contest. When Stanford plays
j in the Big Game don't you believe
j that each man will rise up and put it
j over? Don't you believe that each
1 rooter can impart enough to the team
to put it over?
The Stanford team has been out
scored twice, Stanford University has
; not been licked. May the team and
■ the rooters bear me out.
Sincerely,
Red and White.

the rooters can't be blamed; and dur
ing the second half they did get under
way in a manner which combined
with the larger section and the Big
Game atmosphere will win for us next
Saturday.
As to the team —California has
failed to prove satisfactorily that she
is the best team. The few of us who
went to the noon rally, heard why it
was Washington's day when we did
the visiting, and why we should not
be alarmed over our not too potent
showing against them. Now with their

| big game under their belts Washing
! ton comes down to Berkeley—away
from home and mother, and handi-
I capped by a mudless field really out
plays California.
We outplayed Santa Clara by a
yardage margin that was very de
j cided. Our running attack plowed
! right through the powerful Santa
| Clara line, as it hasn't in the last few
| games. The fatal let-ups near the goal
line were caused by the moving up of
| the secondary defense. This inability
1 to score was also disastrous in the
| U.S.C. contest. When Stanford plays
j in the Big Game don't you believe
j that each man will rise up and put it
j over? Don't you believe that each
1 rooter can impart enough to the team
to put it over?
The Stanford team has been out
scored twice, Stanford University has
; not been licked. May the team and
■ the rooters bear me out.
Sincerely,
Red and White.
