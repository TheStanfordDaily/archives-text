# SO DO WE ALL

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Don't mistake this —this diatribe is
due directly to a crime against my
digestion; it would probably not have
emanated had Encina fed me on that
fateful rally noon. But being gypped
out of lunch along with a hundred
others has caused my scholatry to slip
a notch or two, and I begin to wonder
why more of our campus worthies do
not agree with our Chappie editor's
implication of "synthetic enthusiasm."
They cherish the remains of the
"rah-rali-sis-boom-ah" period, although
even a fragmentary effort at reflec

tion would cause them to realize that
it has gone the way of all flesh and
of John Held Jr.'s illustrations. The
period had, at least, the virtue of
spontaneity and genuineness, and for
that we must admire it.
But we—we become hysterical with
fear lest the Frosh become prema
turely blas6. We must fire them with
the glory that was Greece and the
splendor that was Rome. And attend
ance at Stanford la limited to those
who pass the intelligence test. Bah!
I feel much better now, thank you.
—R. S.
