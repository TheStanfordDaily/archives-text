A survey of the large area of ground
assigned for the new athletic field was
completed and the map submitted to
the Board of Trustees of the Univer
sity. The football gridiron was ex
pected to be located on the corner of
the field nearest the Escondite road.
The survey of the Southern Pacific
Company for sidetracks to the
grounds included plans for a number
of switches branching out in a fan
like formation capable of accommo
dating ten trains.
Forty men entered their names for
the annual fall quarter track meet.

j The two-mile run was to be reduced
j to five laps, and the mile to three
laps, but all other races were to be
run the regulation distances.
