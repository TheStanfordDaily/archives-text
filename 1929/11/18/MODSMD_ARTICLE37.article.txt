# Chemistry Building To Add Laboratory Improvements
## 
### 
Alterations costing approximately
$2500 are under way in the basement
of the Chemistry Building in order to
provide additional laboratory space.
It is expected that the now labora
: tories, two of which will be used for
bio-chemistry, a third for photo-chem
! istry, and the fourth for miscellane
ous, will be ready for occupancy by
j the beginning of the winter quarter.
