## 
### 
Saturday's football games decided
several conference titles all over the
country and brought forth several !
leading candidates to play the great '
intersectional game of the year in |
the Pasadena Rose Bowl on New
Year's Day.
Purdue won its first Big Ten cham- j
pionship since the start of the con
ference in 1897 when it beat lowa, 7-0,
and Notre Dame is still undefeated by
virtue of its win over Southern Cali- I
fornia 13-12. Tulane of New Orleans
is undefeated and may be the "east- J
ern" team in the Pasadena game.
But the probable East team will be j
either Tennessee or Pittsburgh. Ten- j
nessee beat Vanderbilt 13-0 last Sat- i
urday to win the Southern Conference i
while Pittsburgh maintained her un- j
broken string of victories by tram- j
pling the strong Carnegie Tech eleven, |
34-13.
The West will probably be repre
sented by California with St. Mary's
as another possibility. The Bears are
leading the Coast Conference and will
win the title if they defeat the Red- I
shirts next Saturday, while the Moraga 1
institute is the only important (earn
in the country whose goal line has
not yet been crossed.
