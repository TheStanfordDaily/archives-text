## 
### 
In a fast practice game Friday af
ternoon, the first one of the season, j
the varsity polo team went down to
defeat before the Menlo Circus Club's
four by the narrow margin of 7-5. The I
riding was hard and the hitting ex- i
cellent for so early in the season, i
The Stanford team was a group of
individual stars.
John Shortridge, captain of last
year's varsity polo team, played a
very consistent game at number 2 for
the Circus Club. Jensen for Stanford
played an excellent brand of polo in j
the second half. Goodspeed was high- j
score man of the game, scoring four !
out of five of Stanford's points. Jen
sen scored the other tally from a pen
alty. Carter, Stanford's hard-riding
number 3, was a contniual menace to
the visitors.
Revell, Goodspeed, Carter, and Dill :
started the game for Stanford. At the
beginning of the second half, Scripps
went in for Revel at number 1, and
Jensen replaced Dill at back.
