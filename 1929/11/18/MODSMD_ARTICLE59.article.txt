# Fighting Card Team Bows To Olympic Fencing Squad
## 
### 
A fighting Stanford fencing team
bowed to a superior Olympic Club
squad by a score of 14 matches 1o 11
in the Eucina Gymnasium Friday
night. Although the final result of
the bouts was never in doubt, the
Cardinal foilsmen forced to their ut
most the veterans opposing them.
Against experienced fencers, the
Stanford men outdid themselves to
win six matches, the other five being
won by forfeit when the fifth man for
the Winged "O" failed to appear. Cap
tain Jack Snyder downed Koskigen
and Leicester, former intercollegiate
champion, to win two bouts for Stan
ford.
Fletcher Dutton likewise won two
encounters, defeating Koskinen and
Raymond, but it remained for Joe Pol
verino to do the impossible when he
downed De Jong in the most unex
pected victory of the evening. James
Reed, competing for the first time,
defeated Leicester to win the other
bout. Tom Hendry, the fifth Card fen
cer, showed up excellently though de
feated in both his bouts.
