# FRESHMEN BEGIN THREE-DAY TASK ON 1929 BONFIRE
## Pyre To Be As High As First Year Men Can Build It In Limited Time 
### 
Stanford's 1929 Big Game bonfire
will begin to take definite shape this
afternoon when the Freshman Class,
under direction of committees ap
pointed by Stanford Steinbeck, presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., begin the three
day task of collecting the material
and putting it in place on the frame
work of poles and ties erected Thurs
day by employees of the telephone
company and the freshmen.
The three-day limit placed on work
on the bonfire this year by the Execu
tive Committee was done in the effort
to prevent any huge expenditure of
unnecessary time and energy on the
part of the students engaged in the
work. In past years the bonfire has
been a constant stumbling block to
the scholastic inclinations of a few
members of the Freshman Class, ac
cording to Steinbeck.
Spotlights Erected
Phil Caldwell, Carl Izzard, and Ger
ald Byng comprise the committee of
engineers in charge of the actual con
struction work. According to Cald
well, the structure will be approxi
mately forty feet square, with but
tressed corners, and just as high as
the frosh can build it in three days.
Thirty telephone poles, donated by
the P. G. & E., and three carloads of
ties from the Southern Pacific Com
pany, will make up the framework n
which the inflammable material will
be placed. The plans now are to work
most of tonight and tomorrow night
and for this purpose four huge spot
lights were erected around the site of
the fire by Jack Carrington and Irwin
Warner.
No chances are being taken this
year on any premature ignitions. Les
ter McElwain is in charge of the
guarding which began Saturday. The
freshmen are working in shift 3 on
this phase of the fire and one group
of guards will be on duty all the time
between now and Wednesday night
after the Big Game Rally, when the
official burning will take place.
