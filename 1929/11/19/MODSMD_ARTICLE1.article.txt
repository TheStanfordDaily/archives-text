# B.A.C. MEMBERS VOICE VIEWS ON SCALPING FUROR
## Most Members of Board Are Unfamiliar With Scalping Problem, Reserve Opinions Steinbeck, Heinecke, Krenz Opposed to Limitation of A.S.S.U. Ticket Allotment 
### John Isaacs 
Members of the Board of Athletic
Control, with few exceptions, are hesi
tant to declare themselves about
Graduate Manager A 1 Masters' most
recent proposal to limit students to
one rooter's ticket for the Big Game,
until after a meeting of the Board
tonight.
Masters's proposal came as a bomb
shell to the campus yesterday morn
ing and was the result of the present
open scalping of Big Game tickets.
Most Board men are unfamiliar with
the scalping problem, but are agreed
that if scalping is as prevalent as re
ported, serious steps to suppress it
must be taken. The ticket situation
will undoubtedly be the leading topic
of discussion at the meeting tonight.
All three student members are defi
nitely opposed to any limiting action.
Statements Secured
Statements were secured by the
Daily from the following members of
the Board of Athletic Control and
alumni leaders.
Frank L. Guerena, '12, an alumni
member of the Board of Athletic Con
trol and former Stanford crew cox
swain and coach, yesterday stated
that he would not be ready "to declare
himself on the question of depriving
students of their two extra Big Game
tickets as a means to end scalping
until the matter had been thoroughly
reviewed in a meeting of the Board.
"The remedy to the scalping prob
lem lies in the hands of ticket hold
ers," said Guerena. "If there is whole
sale scalping, as there appears to be,
we will have to do something. Wheth
er or not that something is to deprive
students of their extra Big Game
tickets is still an undecided question
in my mind."
"Early Student Choice"
"We can't tell anything about what
will happen yet," was the comment
of J. Pearce Mitchell, registrar and a
faculty member of the Board of Ath
letic Control. "The students were
given an early choice this year; and
if such a privilege is abused, the pro
posed step to limit their tickets is the
only logical thing to do."
Stanford E. Steinbeck, president of
the A.S.S.U. and a student member
of the Board of Athletic Control, yes
terday declared that he was abso
lutely opposed to any action which
would deprive students of their two
extra Big Game tickets.
Steinbeck Opposed
"I believe that all three student
members of the Board are opposed to
any attempt to decrease the number
of tickets allotted to students, Stein
beck said, "and I further believe that
if the matter is brought to a question
at a meeting of the Board that the
faculty and alumni members will vote
with the student representatives.
Very few students scalp tickets. Most
reports of tickets scalping are greatly
exaggerated."
"I don't know a thing about it; and
won't know until after the meeting
of the Board Tuesday night," declared
W. P. Fuller, '10, an alumni member
of the Board of Athletic Control.
Declaring himself in favor of Gradu
ate Manager Alfred Master's proposal
to deprive students of their present
privilege to buy two extra Big Game
tickets, Richard W. Barrett, '04, chair
man of the Board of Athletic Control,
last night said, "This drastic action
is the only thing that we can do to
suppress ticket scalping.
"Few Alumni Scalp"
"Students have abused their ticket
privileges more and more each year
until now they threaten to spoil the
Big Game," continued Barrett in his
statement to the Daily. "Students ate
the guilty parties. Very few alumni
scalp tickets.
"I have always maintained that in
tercollegiate football games are pri
marily for students; but, much as I
hate to do it; we will have to take
away their extra tickets to stop scalp
ing."
"I think the plan is not justified at
all. Since the students receive but two
tickets besides their rooter's ticket,
I don't think that very much scalping
takes place," declared Walt Heinecke,
student member of the Board of Ath
letic Control. "As a rule the students
give their tickets to parents or close
friends. In either case no scalping
takes place."
Not Feasible to Krenz
Eric Krenz, a student member of
the Board of Athletic Control, stated:
"I don't think that plan of taking
away students' rights to their tickets
is very feasible. It certainly seems
to me that this plan would not solve
the problem at all. There are few stu
dents who receive rights to only two
tickets that would scalp them. Un
questionably most of the scalping is
being done by those who receive a
larger allotment than the average
student."
"Alumni Eager"
Professor W. B. Owens, faculty
member of the Board of Athletic Con
trol: "When you consider the number
of alumni eager to see the game who
have had to have their money re
funded, it seems too bad to see stu
dents abusing their privilege of ob
taining tickets. As between alumni,
who have a very clear right to see
the game, and outsiders who are will
ing to sell the tickets. I think the
alumni are entitled. These extra tick
ets that are given to the students are
supposed to be used by members of
their families, and as long as they
are put to that use I believe the stu
dents should have the preference. If
the privilege is going to be grossly
abused at the expense of the alumni.

however, I would not favor continu
ing."
"There is general scalping of tick
ets this year," said Alfred R. Masters.
"Alumni who are unable to get their
tickets through the regular channels
have to buy them at advanced prices,
and then come back at me about it.
Of course, I am unable to say a thing.
"The best way for the students who
are using their tickets in the proper
manner to protect their rights to them
would be to turn in the names of
those students they know are scalp
ing. However, I doubt if that will be
done. The question of taking the extra
two tickets away from the students is
sure to come up at the meeting tomor
row, and there is sure to be a stronger
argument than ever in favor of such
action."
"If Master's proposal goes through,
it will work a hardship on students
who are really using their tickets
right," said J. E. McDowell, alumni
secretary, yesterday. "But you must
remember that in another year or two,
you will be alumni, and then you'll be
glad that there are 6,000 or more extra
tickets available."
