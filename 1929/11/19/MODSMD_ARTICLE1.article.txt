# B.A.C. MEMBERS VOICE VIEWS ON SCALPING FUROR
## Most Members of Board Are Unfamiliar With Scalping Problem, Reserve Opinions Steinbeck, Heinecke, Krenz Opposed to Limitation of A.S.S.U. Ticket Allotment 
### John Isaacs 
Members of the Board of Athletic
Control, with few exceptions, are hesi
tant to declare themselves about
Graduate Manager A 1 Masters' most
recent proposal to limit students to
one rooter's ticket for the Big Game,
until after a meeting of the Board
tonight.
Masters's proposal came as a bomb
shell to the campus yesterday morn
ing and was the result of the present
open scalping of Big Game tickets.
Most Board men are unfamiliar with
the scalping problem, but are agreed
that if scalping is as prevalent as re
ported, serious steps to suppress it
must be taken. The ticket situation
will undoubtedly be the leading topic
of discussion at the meeting tonight.
All three student members are defi
nitely opposed to any limiting action.
Statements Secured
Statements were secured by the
Daily from the following members of
the Board of Athletic Control and
alumni leaders.
Frank L. Guerena, '12, an alumni
member of the Board of Athletic Con
trol and former Stanford crew cox
swain and coach, yesterday stated
that he would not be ready "to declare
himself on the question of depriving
students of their two extra Big Game
tickets as a means to end scalping
until the matter had been thoroughly
reviewed in a meeting of the Board.
"The remedy to the scalping prob
lem lies in the hands of ticket hold
ers," said Guerena. "If there is whole
sale scalping, as there appears to be,
we will have to do something. Wheth
er or not that something is to deprive
students of their extra Big Game
tickets is still an undecided question
in my mind."
"Early Student Choice"
"We can't tell anything about what
will happen yet," was the comment
of J. Pearce Mitchell, registrar and a
faculty member of the Board of Ath
letic Control. "The students were
given an early choice this year; and
if such a privilege is abused, the pro
posed step to limit their tickets is the
only logical thing to do."
Stanford E. Steinbeck, president of
the A.S.S.U. and a student member
of the Board of Athletic Control, yes
terday declared that he was abso
lutely opposed to any action which
would deprive students of their two
extra Big Game tickets.
Steinbeck Opposed
"I believe that all three student
members of the Board are opposed to
any attempt to decrease the number
of tickets allotted to students, Stein
beck said, "and I further believe that
if the matter is brought to a question
at a meeting of the Board that the
faculty and alumni members will vote
with the student representatives.
Very few students scalp tickets. Most
reports of tickets scalping are greatly
exaggerated."
"I don't know a thing about it; and
won't know until after the meeting
of the Board Tuesday night," declared
W. P. Fuller, '10, an alumni member
of the Board of Athletic Control.
