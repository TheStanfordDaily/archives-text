# ROUTING OF FREIGHT VIA MAYFIELD HOPED BY PALO ALTO MAYOR
## 
### 
In accordance with plans for a new
entrance to the University grounds,
Mayor Christensen of Palo Alto sug
gested yesterday that all freight to
Palo Alto and vicinity should be han
dled from one place, the Mayfield sta
tion. In addition, he declared that the
traffic of Stanford and Palo Alto is
entitled to a new passenger station.
"It is entirely out of place to have
a freight depot and freight cars at
the very entrance to the University,
establishing a commercial area be
tween Palo Alto and the state high
way facing the University grounds.
Therefore, I recommend that some
thing be done to eliminate this Indus
trial area."
