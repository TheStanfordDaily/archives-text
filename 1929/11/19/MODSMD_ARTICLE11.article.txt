## "Boom" To Be Introduced At Rally By His Old Pal, Delmar Daves, '27 
### 
Hardy (Boom) Drumm, '95, first
Stanford yell leader, who is now on
his way to attend the Big Game and
who is expected to speak at the Big
Game rally tomorrow night, will be
the campus guest of Alumni Secretary
J. E. McDowell.
In an interview to the Daily yester
day, McDowell briefly sketched the
college career of Drumm.
"Boom was a great fellow," McDow
ell said, "but his interest in sports

and other student
activities caused
him to roll out in
his junior year.
While attending
Stanford he was
an intimate friend
of Herbert Hoo
ver and Dr. Wil
bur."
Before Drumm
flunked out, he
served a term as

yell-leader and was author of the
famous cheer, "Zah, Zah, Zeer, We're
all here, '95, '95, Pioneer."
The Inset is an artist's reproduc
tion of a snapshot taken of Drumm
on his Siamese cow ranch, which he
has operated for the past 15 years.
Delmar Daves, '27, who was promi
nent in campus theatricals and as a
member of the Rally Committee, will
leave his work in Hollywood "talkie"
studios to attend the Big Game Rally
also. Daves is one of Boom's best
friends and will Introduce him to the
student body.
Last word of the prominent alum
nus was received yesterday from
Honolulu where it was reported that
Drumm was expected to catch the
S.S. Maui by seaplane and arrive in
San Francisco tomorrow morning.
