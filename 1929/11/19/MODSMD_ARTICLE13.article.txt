# U.C. GOOD-WILL REPRESENTATIVE TO SPEAK HERE
## Custom Opposed by Campus Opinion; Upheld by Cal Student Leader 
### 
Contrary to rumors which have been
current for the past week, the annual
Stanford-University of California good
will assembly will take place as scheduled
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning in the
Assembly Hall.
Student opinion on this campus has
been hostile to such a meet. Stanford
Steinbeck, president of the A.S.S.U., no
tified John A. Reynolds, California stu
dent head, of this condition and suggested
that the annual get-together be canceled.
Reynolds Favors Assembly
However, Reynolds, who compares the
Card-Bear assembly with the recent Hoo
ver-Mac Donald amity meet, reported that
the California student body favored the
assembly and plans have been made ac
cordingly.
The Daily Californian, student news
paper at the Berkeley institution, disa
grees with Reynolds in an editorial which
will appear in its columns this morning.
Excerpts are quoted below:
"According to reports received from
Palo Alto, the good-will assembly, which
will be held there tomorrow morning, has
been motivated largely by the A.S.U.C.
administration. Some days ago, the Stan
ford president, citing the opposition of
his student body and himself sharing its
opinion, questioned the meeting's advisa
bility; but placed the decision entirely in
California's hands. In replying our stu
dent head declared that the editorials in
the Stanford Daily and the Californian
had missed the point; that good-will as
semblies benefited relations between the
schools; that the custom was analogous
with Mac Donald's visit to this country. In
short, the A.S.U.C. president favors
good-will assemblies, and there will be
one.
Good-Will Not Questioned
"There is some doubt as to whether
California and Stanford need an added
impetus toward friendship and co-opera
tion. Our friendship is as old as our
rivalry. And our mutual esteem is based
on mutual respect. But granting that im
petus is needed and believing that such
exchanges are the best ways to supply
it, there is still no reason to believe that
good-will assemblies should be held dur
ing Big Game week.
"Whether or not the editorials in the
Daily and the Californian have missed
the point, the fact remains that for Stan
ford at least, they mirrored the opinion
of the student body. The Farm does not
favor good-will assemblies."

schools; that the custom was analogous
with Mac Donald's visit to this country. In
short, the A.S.U.C. president favors
good-will assemblies, and there will be
one.
Good-Will Not Questioned
"There is some doubt as to whether
California and Stanford need an added
impetus toward friendship and co-opera
tion. Our friendship is as old as our
rivalry. And our mutual esteem is based
on mutual respect. But granting that im
petus is needed and believing that such
exchanges are the best ways to supply
it, there is still no reason to believe that
good-will assemblies should be held dur
ing Big Game week.
"Whether or not the editorials in the
Daily and the Californian have missed
the point, the fact remains that for Stan
ford at least, they mirrored the opinion
of the student body. The Farm does not
favor good-will assemblies."
Contrary to rumors which have been
current for the past week, the annual
Stanford-University of California good
will assembly will take place as scheduled
at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning in the
Assembly Hall.
Student opinion on this campus has
been hostile to such a meet. Stanford
Steinbeck, president of the A.S.S.U., no
tified John A. Reynolds, California stu
dent head, of this condition and suggested
that the annual get-together be canceled.
Reynolds Favors Assembly
However, Reynolds, who compares the
Card-Bear assembly with the recent Hoo
ver-Mac Donald amity meet, reported that
the California student body favored the
assembly and plans have been made ac
cordingly.
The Daily Californian, student news
paper at the Berkeley institution, disa
grees with Reynolds in an editorial which
will appear in its columns this morning.
Excerpts are quoted below:
"According to reports received from
Palo Alto, the good-will assembly, which
will be held there tomorrow morning, has
been motivated largely by the A.S.U.C.
administration. Some days ago, the Stan
ford president, citing the opposition of
his student body and himself sharing its
opinion, questioned the meeting's advisa
bility; but placed the decision entirely in
California's hands. In replying our stu
dent head declared that the editorials in
the Stanford Daily and the Californian
had missed the point; that good-will as
semblies benefited relations between the
schools; that the custom was analogous
with Mac Donald's visit to this country. In
