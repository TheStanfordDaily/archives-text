# VARSITY DRILLED IN DEFENSE FOR U.C. FORMATIONS
## Practice Scrimmage Brings Enthusiastic Students To Encourage Cardinal Team Reserve Eleven Makes Two Touchdowns on Long Pass Plays; Runs Are Smeared 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Scrimmaging for an hour yesterday
afternoon before approximately half
of the Stanford student body, the
Cardinal varsity held its last open
practice session until after the Big
Game on Saturday. Coach Pop War
ner will work his charges behind
barred gates today and tomorrow, and
immediately following the Big Game
Rally tomorrow evening will lead his
men into the hills to rest up for their
annual clash with California's Golden
Bear.
During yesterday's scrimmage
against the Stanford Grays, the regu?
lar players showed more pep and
punch than they have displayed in
practice for many a moon. The Grays,
using Nibs Price's pet formation and
running plays, had possession of the
ball for the entire hour, and although
stopped cold on a majority of the
plays managed to break away for a
couple of mythical scores.
Pass Defense Weak
One weakness, that in knocking
down passes, was again much in evi
dence. The Cards' pass defense has
been a shaky cog in the team's play
all year, and unless Pop can tighten
it up a bit Stanford may find itself
hard-pressed to stop California from
shoving over a score or two on Satur
day.
So far this season, the Cardinals
have had their goal line crossed just
five times, and all five of these scores
have resulted via the aerial route â€”
two by Santa Clara, one by U.S.C.,
one by Oregon, and one by Oregon
State. On the other hand, the Bears
rely almost entirely on pigskin tossing
to put over their touchdowns, having
one of the best passers on the Coast
in Beny Lom and a quartet of good
ball-snaggers in Bob Norton, Bob
Thornton, Russ Avery, and Lee Eisan.
Pop is having about as hard a time
deciding whom to start in the Big
Game, as he did against U.S.C. four
weeks ago. Last night the same team
that opened with the Huskies was
running together, with the exception
of Joe Bush at Captain Muller'a end
and Red Thompson at Chang Artman's
tackle berth. However, Muller is in
good shape and is a cinch to start Sat
urday. There is a possibility of Phil
Neill replacing Johnny Preston at left
end, while the guard positions are
still very much up in the air.
All of the players, except Rudy Rin
tala, who were injured in the Santa
Clara game will be ready to see action
this week-end. Rintala sustained a
badly twisted ankle and, according to
the latest reports, may be on the shelf
for the rest of the 1929 season.
