Good news has reached this campus.
After all, the students of Stanford and of the University of California
are to be given an opportunity to disembogue a splendid spirit of fellow
ship and co-operation when their two student presidents officiate at those
functions which have been laughingly called Good Will Assemblies.
Although Stanford Steinbeck, local student leader, has expressed a
desire to abandon the custom, John Arthur Reynolds, California's presi
dent, has heard the call of duty and feels a strong urge to better the
spirit which exists between the two great athletic rivals of the West.
Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Steinbeck—setting a splendid example for the
football teams —have smoothed out their differences amicably, and the
Good Will Assemblies are to be held. Friendly relations must be main
tained !
So Cardinal rooters will be favored tomorrow by a speech from
California's leader of student thought; and the Berkeley boys and girls
will sit with rapt attention while listening to Mr. Steinbeck's remarks.
The Daily is convinced that student opinion, here and across the
bay, is against such a ridiculous practice. Stanford Steinbeck showed
good common sense in desiring to call the affairs off, and his California
contemporary would have done well to have harkened to the sentiments
of his constituents.
As Mr. Reynolds is so anxious to address the young manhood and
young womanhood of Stanford, he must have something truly vital to
say, however. So the Daily urges its readers to muster up their bright
est smiles and warmest feelings to welcome the harbinger of good will
from across the blue waters of San Francisco Bay.
