# MUSSOLINI SAYS SO
## 
### 
Along with the discussions and preparations of the Naval Limitation
Conference to be held in London in January, comes the promulgation
of Italy's "Iron Man," Benito Mussolini, that there is entirely "too much
talk of peace and disarmament."
"History teaches us when there are serious crises it is arms and war
which solve them," II Duce thundered, in commenting on the eleventh
anniversary of the victory at Veneto, which marked the defeat of the
Austrian armies in the world war. In the next war Mussolini expects
every able-bodied Italian to glorify himself on the field of battle, even
more than he did in the last hellish encounter. And the Italians agreed
with him. They have to in Italy. The rest of the world has grown ac
customed to the fiery statements of this modern self-styled Caesar, who
achieved his present position through arms and warfare. He apparently
is for war as it is his bread and butter.
There is little disapprobation of Mussolini's work in Italy. He has
stabilized the government and increased the happiness of the Italian
people. As a governor he is to be given just credit, but as a student of
history he has missed his calling. History does not teach that the serious
crises of the world were ever solved by arms and war. Quite the contrary.
The world has always been weaker after each international conflict. His
tory has taught one irrevocable lesson: there is no victor in war.
If there is "too much talk of peace," it is because the people of the
world want peace and are forcing their elected representatives to con
sider a less destructive, less devastating mode of settling international
disputes than by arms and warfare. Most of the civilized nations have a
democratic form of government. Italy has not. Mussolini's fiery dia
tribes cannot be the true sentiment of the Italian people and in uttering
them he brands himself as a man entirely out of tune with modern hopes
and ambitions.
Sooner or later the Italian people will be able openly to join the throng
of patriots of every nation who are making war on war.
