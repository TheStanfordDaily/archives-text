# BETTER BOOK CLUBS
## 
### 
Perhaps no finer example of discriminating American intelligence has
been afforded than that of the book clubs. Overnight, as it were, more
than two hundred thousand clever readers used rare judgment. No more
need they be bothered about selecting books to read. Competent judges
would weed the everlasting masterpieces from the tripe and altruistically
see that each subscriber received the everlasting masterpiece each month.
Not only docs this save time and relieve mental stress but it permits
everyone to discuss the same book at the same time. One is kept thor
oughly conversant with the books everyone reads; one is never guilty of
examining those stale and extinct productions of last year.
Yet the plan needs some perfection. As long as the reader permits
other people to select his books, why not let them also read the books for
him ? I hen, instead of receiving a book each month, be would receive
a brief review, thus permitting him to know just as much as he did before
and keep up with the current books without ever having to bother with
opening or even looking at one. This is so logical a solution that surely
the book-club subscribers will not be content until they have attained to
this new intellectual goal.â€”Mimicsota Daily.
