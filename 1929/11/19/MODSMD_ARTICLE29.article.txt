THE MAURIZIUS CASE, by Jacob
Wassermann. Translated by Caro
line Newton. Horace Liveright,
New York, 1929.
A translation has been made at last
of Wassermann's latest and much
discussed book, "The Mnurlzius Case."
In Germany this book had a great
success; it was hailed as having re
markable treatment of human rela
tionships and very excellent character
portrayal. There is no doubt that this
is a well-written book; but cut in half
it still would be well-written and
much more readable.
The Germans have a tendency to
enter into the smallest details and ex
haust them completely. "The Mauri
zius Case" is a detailed account of a
boy of sixteen and his passion for jus
tice. Wassermann leaves nothing to
the reader's imagination or intelli
gence. Almost every thought of the
boy Is set forth in the six hundred
pages of the book. A very exact pic
ture of him is obtained; at the end
one knows the boy as well as one
can ever hope to know anyone, only
something is lacking. A person likes
to draw his own conclusions as to a
character and is, consequently, a
trifle piqued when he finds this im
possible. Wassermann carefully draws
them for you.
The plot of the book is an original
one. The young son of Baron Ander
gast, a famous lawyer, is convinced
that there was a miscarriage of jus
tice in a certain case prosecuted by
his father years before. Justice is a
passion with the boy and he sets out
to prove the innocence of the man,
Maurizius, who is imprisoned for life.
The book is long and rather compli
cated, yet in spite of its length, inter
est in the story never flags. There is
suspense until the last page. In this,
"The Maurizius Case" has the good
qualities of a detective story. These
qualities are also combined with a

superior style rarely found in detec
tive stories.
Whether "The Maurizius Case" will
have the same success in America as
it had in Germany is yet to be seen.
Its length will no doubt frighten many
people here. Those who once start to
read it, however, will have a hard
time laying the book aside until they
have finished it. —N. J.
"SALUTE"—Varsity.
Here is the old Army game dished up
with all the supreme sound effects the
I'ox technicians can muster. Movietone
puts the young-boy-who-goes-to-Annapo
lis story across.
Although undistinguished, it is inter
esting. '1 he exteriors were really taken
at Annapolis, and it's always funny to
see the plebes given the works. If you
can still believe that the right man pos
sibly might not win the big game, you'll
be excited with this realistic version of
the Army-Navy game. It ends up in
mud splashier than any ever used by
Stanford frosh.
Robust George O'Brien and diminutive
William Janney arc brothers who go to
West Point and Annapolis, respectively.
George is the idol of the Army, but bash
ful Billy has a tough time with the Navy.
But when he gets the idea that George is
stealing his girl, Billy resolves to win that
ol' Army-Navy game or Go West where
men are menaces.
George O'Brien, who is admirably suit
ed for college hero roles, plays a second
ary part. Too bad he couldn't have gone
to Annapolis! Mr. Janney, future ad
miral, gives a sympathetic performance
as the boy handicapped by his famous
brother's reputation. Helen Chandler, the
lady in the case, is not so good. A stage
recruit to the talkies, she is an argument
for trained-in-Hollywood heroines.
Stepin Fetchit, the negro cromic, drawls
in ultra-Georgian style, but it is a new
comer, I* rank Albertson, who carries off
acting honors in "Salute." He is the un
suppressible smartie.
