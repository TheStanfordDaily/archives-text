WHAT PRICE POP
When the last of some four-score
and ten thousand persons has pquat
ted comfortably on his highly coveted
and most likely high-priced bit of
planking, which he has rented for a
couple of hours at a dent in his
pocketbook ranging from five to fifty
pieces of eight, and the referee, him
self tingling with excitement, blows
out a vociferous squeak from his tin
whistle to send twenty-two pigskin
hounds charging down the greensward
on Saturday afternoon, the 35th an
nual Big Gamo will be under way.
What is more, it will be the
fourth meeting in as many years
between two of the nation's coach
ing peers!
For when the opening kickoff goes
looping down the field and plunks
into the talons of some awaiting ball
hawk, Messers Glen Scobey Warner
and Clarence Nibs Price will be fac
ing each other from opposite sides
of the gridiron. Mr. Warner, glum,
gloomy, and half hidden behind a
cloud of cigarette smoke, will be sur
rounded by his charges decked out
in white jerseys and red pantaloons.
California Favored
On the opposite bench with his
usual optimistic smile, will be
Mr. Price, small but overflowing
with the personality of a general.
And His Nibs may well grin confi
dently as he peers out on the turf
to get a glimpse of his cavorting
understudies, for this is the first
time in four long years that he
has led a team out on a Big Game
battlefield, undefeated and favored
to neatly trim its rival from the
Farm.
A glance through the hectic pages
of gridiron history shows that back
in 1926 the Old Fox and His Nibs
tangled wits for the first time. On
that certain occasion, Mr. Price was
blessed with one of the weakest
teams ever to perform for dear old
Berkeley, while Pop held the reins of
the national champs for that season.
Stanford raced up and down the field
that day to pile up 42 points to Cali
fornia's lowly 7.
And so when the moleskins
were packed in mothballs a short
time thereafter, the followers of
the Golden Bear set up an awful
howl. Alumni and students com
bined to razz their unsuccessful
mentor. Rumors floated around at
that time that Mr. Price would
soon be earning his ham and eggs
at some other collegiate institu
tion.
Stronger in 1927
Turning over a page to 1927, it is
seen that the Bear proved to be a
more formidable beast that year. Cali
fornia actually chalked up a number
of wins, and succeeded in holding
Stanford to a 13 to 6 victory. How
ever, the squawks and growls con
cerning Nibs continued to increase.
One who could not produce champs
every year was not wanted, it seems.
Last year Stanford journeyed up to
Berkeley favored to eke out a win, yet
when the final gun went pop the
scoreboard read: Cal 13, Stanford 13.
A last-minute comeback had saved
the Cards from utter rout. A long
flip of the hoghide spheroid floated
into the arms of a Redshirt in the
last minute of play to save the day.
And from that time on, Mr. Price had
come into his own. Cal had won a
moral victory. Nibs was not so bad
after all.
Four years ago Nibs was hooted
at from every corner. Today the
jeers have turned to cheers. Those
who ranked Mr. Price with the
champs now rank him with the
coaching champs! Some even go
as far as to class him on a par
with Pop.
Pop The Sage
If he be as good as Mr. Warner,
he is some coach. For Pop is uni
versally recognized as the dean,
the sage, and the fox of them all!
The Old Man has turned out all-
Americans galore. His championship
teams can not be counted on one's
fingers. Certain plays introduced by
him have revolutionized the grand fall
pastime. His systems of ball toting
have been copied by hundreds of
teams from coast to coast, from the
alligator-infested swamps of sunny
Florida to the snow-capped lair of
the Washington Husky, from the sun
sizzled stamping-grounds of the Thun
dering Herd to the storm and rock
bound reefs of wind-swept Maine.
Where there is football, there
is the handicraft of one Glenn
Bcobey Warner!
At any rate, the fourth meeting of
these two leaders will be interesting
as well as hectic. Saturday's game
will be a clash of wits as well as of
brawn. Pop will not work under lock
and key for the next few days for
nothing. Nibs' bag of tricks will not
be so empty either. Each and every
fan can look for the unexpected to
happen on the 23rd.
Big Games always produce the
unusual. Saturday will not prove
the exception—with Pop there to
brew a potent mixture of tricks
and Nibs on hand to show that he
is a wizard, tool
