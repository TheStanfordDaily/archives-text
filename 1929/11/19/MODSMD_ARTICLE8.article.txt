WASHINGTON, D.C., Nov. 18 (JP).
—James W. Good, Secretary of War,
died tonight after blood poisoning finally
overwhelmed his courageous resistance.
Just before lapsing into the final un
consciousness, the Secretary of War had
turned to one of his physicians and said
feebly:
"I have never lost a fight in my life
and I am not going to lose this one."
The death of Secretary Good grieved
official and diplomatic Washington and
his many friends commented on his death
with sadness.
Secretary Wilbur said:
"Secretary Good was one of those
unique, friendly men who combined poli
tics with a high sense of public service.
"In both his congressional record and
during the short time he was in the cabi
net he had an unusual public sense in
that his view was always national."
