Go Get 'Em, Stanford . . .
This Saturday s
Game
The Big Game . . . brings out the
smartest and most colorful crowd of
the season. Stanford men know that
proper appearance is essential at all
times, and that smart footwear is the
foundation of good dress. For the
Big Game, the smartness of Scotch
Grains in the new dark browns and
blacks will be most appropriate.
Proper shoes are a requisite
of formal dress. Let us fit you
for the evening parties.
