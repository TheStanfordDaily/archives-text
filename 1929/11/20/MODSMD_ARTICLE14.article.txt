# TEMPLETON MAY EMPLOY STARTING BLOCKS FOR COMING TRACK SEASON
## 
### 
"If I can work out a satisfactory
way of combining the use of foot and
hand starting blocks, I shall use them
during the coming season," said Dink
Templeton, Stanford track coach, in
commenting on the recent approval
of the blocks by the A.A.U. meeting in
the East.
"It should be understood that my
blocks have not been approved by the
A.A.U.," Templeton continued. "They
have approved only the foot blocks,
and not the hand blocks that my men
used last season. However, the use of
both kinds of blocks has been ap
proved by the N.C.A.A., under whose
rules the Pacific Coast Conference
operates. Hence the use of the blocks
has been approved by the only or
ganization that means anything to our
conference."
Templeton is of the opinion that the
A.A.U. did a sensible thing in approv
ing the blocks. He said that the use
of the blocks eliminates much of the

"fiddling around" caused by digging
starting holes and filling them in
after each race, and makes starting
conditions for each race more uni
form. The hand blocks that Temple
ton designed last year allow uniform
ity in the starting posture and permit
the trackman to practice his starts
with greater ease. Templeton men
tioned some of the big relay meets in
the East last year in which the use
of starting blocks saved as much as
an hour of time in running off the
events.
"The importance of the A.A.U.
recognition of the blocks," said Tem
pleton, "is that it is the only athletic
organization in the United 3tates
whose approval of records is recog
nized by the International Amateur
Athletic Federation, which has the
power of establishinb marks and
times as world's records. Without the
approval of the A.A.U. on the use of
blocks, records made when they are
used will not be recognized officially."
