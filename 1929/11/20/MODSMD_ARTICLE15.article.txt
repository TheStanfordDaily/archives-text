Game, written by Gould and Temple
ton Peck, will be played by a large
cast in the parts of numerous well
known sports writers, coaches, and
such. Speegle and Stan Mullin are the
authors of another satire, on a very
local subject, in which they, together
with Katherine Keho and Irving
Rosenblatt, will appear.
Two Musical Revues
Two big musical revues, in which
women's choruses, trained by Frances
Boone, will be used, are to be among
the principal acts. The songs and
dance numbers for both of these acts
were written by Ted Duncan, Neal
Spaulding, Jack Ross, George Star
bird, T. Morgan, and Fred Ducato.
There will be numbers in which the
Spaulding-Daniels orchestra will be
featured, and two campus vocal trios
—one of men and one of women —are
to be heard singing numbers by stu
dent song-writers. A double-piano act
by Grif Williams and Neal Spaulding
will be one of the chief musical fea
tures.
Special acts will be given by Jean
Jamison, Marshall Kirby, Helen and
Joe Thompson, Phil Brooks, Emoline
Nollen, and Jack Miller; and a special
ballet has been prepared under the
direction of Harold Helvenston.
People for whom tickets for the
Football Gaieties are being held
"collect" must call for them be
fore Thursday afternoon at 5
o'clock, according to Ralph Cam
piglia, dramatic manager.
Skits, burlesques, local satires, musi
cal revues, song-and-dance acts, and
specialties of all kinds, entirely the
product of student talent, will make
Friday night's Football Gaieties the
most original and most varied show
that has hit the campus.
"Presidential Problems," a satire of
more interest to Stanford than any
other of the acts, which was written
by Nels Carter and Laird Doyle, will
be played by Arthur Hurt, Douglas
Greg, and Stan Mullin. Paul Speegle
and Burnell Gould will be seen in an
act of their own composition which
will be a follow-up of last year's
"Radio Fiasco"; and a burlesque on
the press box on the day of the Big
Game, written by Gould and Temple
ton Peck, will be played by a large
cast in the parts of numerous well
known sports writers, coaches, and
such. Speegle and Stan Mullin are the
