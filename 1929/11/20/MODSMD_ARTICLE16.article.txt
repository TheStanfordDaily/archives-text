# SOPHOMORES CAPTURE HONORS IN PRACTICE HOCKEY GAME SERIES
## 
### 
With the sophomore women as win
ners of the hockey practice series title as
a result of their 6-1 victory over the
frosh yesterday, the junior and senior
squads will meet today to determine the
remaining places in the series which ends
this week.
Juniors will probably hold on to the
second position which they occupy now,
for the fourth-year women have lost ev
ery game so far.
Yesterday's game started out at a slow
pace, and few goals were scored during
the first half which ended 2-1. Some
speedy work was shown in the second
part by the soph forward line. Leib,
Hawkins, and Leggett took the ball down
that field at a steady clip with several
showy passes.
Bess Leggett, sophomore center for
ward of stellar rank, drove five of her
team's six goals. Leib made a splendid
hit on a penalty corner, making the sixth
goal.
