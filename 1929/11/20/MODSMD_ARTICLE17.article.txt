# VARSITY SQUAD TO GO IN SECLUSION FOLLOWING RALLY
## Secret Practice May Result In New Play Formations For Big Game Tilt 
### Stephen Dietrich 
No sooner will the final cheers die
clown in tonight's Big Game rally than
Coach Pop Warner and his big Cardinal
varsity will trek off into the nearby foot
hills to rest up for the annual Cal-Stan
ford gridiron clash three days from now.
Although the place of seclusion is
not definitely known, it is certain that
the Cards will be keyed up to a fighting
pitch by game time on Saturday. This
afternoon's secret practice will be the
white-jerseyed boys' last real workout
before they charge out on the field to
face the Golden Bear.
No one will know just what to expect
when Stanford gets under way against
their r ivals from Berkeley, as the Old
Fox is tuning up his charges under lock
and key this week.
Yet, it is certain that Pop will pull the
unexpected in an attempt to check the
favorerl Bear team. Besides polishing up
the old running plays and perfecting the
Cards' passing defense, the Redshirt
mentor will no doubt teach the boys a
trick or two to spring at the psychologi
cal moment. Coach Warner has a habit
of doing such things, as the followers of
the Blue and Gold well remember.
The entire squad, with the exception
of Rudy Rintala, is in excellent shape
for the fray. Rintala is definitely out of
the game with a badly twisted ankle. All
of the other ex-cripples, strange as it
may seem, are ready to see action. Pete
Heiser is expected to start at guard,
while Johnny Preston may be back in his
old place at left end.
