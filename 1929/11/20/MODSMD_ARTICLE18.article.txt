# REVISED CONSTITUTION ADOPTED BY PHI BETA KAPPA CHAPTER HERE
## 
### 
A revised constitution, providing for
more student participation and earlier
admission into Phi Beta Kappa, has been
adopted by the local organization, the
Beta chapter of California.
The new constitution contains the fol
lowing three changes: First, there shall
be student representation on the execu
tive council, which acts as the nominat
ing committee for student membership
and which formerly consisted of faculty
members exclusively. Second, seniors
shall be elected to membership in the
autumn quarter, and a few juniors shall
be elected at that time. Third, the coun
cil shall take into consideration not only
scholastic records in grade points, but
evidence of mental ability and broad
scholarly interests, as well.
The present executive council of the
organization is as follows: president,
Prof. E. G. Martin; vice-president, S. S.
Seward; vice-president, T. S. Barclay;
secretary, J. P. Mitchell; treasurer, K.
M. Gowdery. Additional members are
Prof. Ralph H. Lutz, and three student
members, Richard Ogg, Jr., Ruth Tins
ley, and Louis R. Vincenti.
