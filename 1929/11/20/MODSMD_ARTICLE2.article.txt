# FIELD FOR BIG GAME AIRPORT SELECTED BY SCHOOL OF AVIATION
## 
### 
Palo Alto will have an airport on
"Big Game" days after all. Plans have
been perfected for a landing field on
Embarcadero Ave., just north of the
city and within a mile of the Stadium,
to take the place of the regular port
which was closed by University edict
on the days of the Stanford-California
and Stanford-Army football games.
This announcement came yesterday
from Mrs. Norman A. Goddard of the
Palo Alto School of Aviation.
The site is being rolled and graded
this week, a three thousand foot run
way will be made, and a shelter to be
used as an office by the various air
transportation companies, will be
erected before the end of the week.
The port will be lighted at night by
means of a demonstrating truck
equipped with regulation airport
searchlights. The site will be purely
a temporary one, according to Mrs.
Goddard. Its use will be confined to
big football days.
All of the principle air-transporta
tion companies of the state are plan
ning to carry passengers to the game
Saturday, stated Mrs. Goddard.
