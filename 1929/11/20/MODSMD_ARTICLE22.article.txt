# Frosh Labor On Pyre Apathetic State Chairmen
## Campus Leaders Unanimously Condemn Poor Turnout Of Class of '33 
### Leonard Bartlett 
Apathy and indifference have en
compassed the class of 1933 in their
Big Game Bonfire building efforts.
Unless a last-minute spurt of pyre
building energy is displayed today,
this year's bonfire will be the smallest
in the history of Stanford Big Game
fire.
"Success of our Big Game Bonfire
has always been entirely dependent
upon the energy of the freshman
class," said Stanford Steinbeck, stu
dent body president, in viewing a situ
ation faced for the first time in the
annals of Stanford Big Game Bonfire
building.
Only twenty-one workers reported
for labor at three o'clock yesterday
afternoon, Phil Caldwell, engineer in
charge of construction, reported.
Seven trucks were on hand, but the
frosh to man them were missing.
Monday night more than 125 men
reported at the scene of the Golden
Bear's funeral fire; work went on rap
idly until midnight when all construc
tion ceased due to a dearth of ma
terial.
Numerous requests for the removal
of wood, boxes, and other inflamma
tory materials have gone unanswered
due to lack of assistance. Committee
chairmen, without helpers, found
themselves blocked in their efforts to
make this year's bonfire "bigger and
better."
Although the size of the 1929 pyre
has been limited, phlegmatic support
by the class as a whole has so far
kept the stack of timbers to tiny pro
portions. Surprise at the lack of spirit
shown by freshmen was expressed
yesterday throughout the campus.
Although the plank skeleton for the
fire has been up for several days,
great open spaces throughout the
structure indicate a need of material.
Wood for the center of the pyre has
not been obtained.
A Daily symposium of campus opin
ion revealed the following views by
students associated with the bonfire
construction:
Stanford Steinbeck, President of
A.S.S.U.—"The frosh work when they
get out there but it is terribly hard
to get them out. If the freshmen will
work today, they can make a success
of the fire. Otherwise it is just an
other tradition gone by the boards."
Phil Caldwell, engineer in charge—
"The only way to build this fire is to
have some more workers. The com
mittees have worked to perfection, the
trucks are here, and we have the ma
terial spotted, but no frosh."
Herb Wenig, chairman of Big Game
Rally—"lt is a question of whether
the frosh want the bonfire or not. So
far the answer seems to be firmly
negative. The A.S.S.U. offices have
had plenty of offers for material but
there is no labor supply. Decrease in
size of the class surely has not
brought about all this lack of spirit.
Hank Adams, chairman of commit
tee on trucks—"So far this affair has
been more or less a case of more
trucks than frosh. Unless something
happens today the bonfire is doomed."
Betts Hawkins, chairman of food
committee—"For once in the history
of Big Game building, there has been
more food than men to eat it."

Although the size of the 1929 pyre
has been limited, phlegmatic support
by the class as a whole has so far
kept the stack of timbers to tiny pro
portions. Surprise at the lack of spirit
shown by freshmen was expressed
yesterday throughout the campus.
Although the plank skeleton for the
fire has been up for several days,
great open spaces throughout the
structure indicate a need of material.
Wood for the center of the pyre has
not been obtained.
A Daily symposium of campus opin
ion revealed the following views by
students associated with the bonfire
construction:
Stanford Steinbeck, President of
A.S.S.U.—"The frosh work when they
get out there but it is terribly hard
to get them out. If the freshmen will
work today, they can make a success
of the fire. Otherwise it is just an
other tradition gone by the boards."
Phil Caldwell, engineer in charge—
"The only way to build this fire is to
have some more workers. The com
mittees have worked to perfection, the
trucks are here, and we have the ma
terial spotted, but no frosh."
Herb Wenig, chairman of Big Game
Rally—"lt is a question of whether
the frosh want the bonfire or not. So
far the answer seems to be firmly
negative. The A.S.S.U. offices have
had plenty of offers for material but
there is no labor supply. Decrease in
size of the class surely has not
brought about all this lack of spirit.
Hank Adams, chairman of commit
tee on trucks—"So far this affair has
been more or less a case of more
trucks than frosh. Unless something
happens today the bonfire is doomed."
Betts Hawkins, chairman of food
committee—"For once in the history
of Big Game building, there has been
more food than men to eat it."
Apathy and indifference have en
compassed the class of 1933 in their
Big Game Bonfire building efforts.
Unless a last-minute spurt of pyre
building energy is displayed today,
this year's bonfire will be the smallest
in the history of Stanford Big Game
fire.
"Success of our Big Game Bonfire
has always been entirely dependent
upon the energy of the freshman
class," said Stanford Steinbeck, stu
dent body president, in viewing a situ
ation faced for the first time in the
annals of Stanford Big Game Bonfire
building.
Only twenty-one workers reported
for labor at three o'clock yesterday
afternoon, Phil Caldwell, engineer in
charge of construction, reported.
Seven trucks were on hand, but the
frosh to man them were missing.
Monday night more than 125 men
reported at the scene of the Golden
Bear's funeral fire; work went on rap
idly until midnight when all construc
tion ceased due to a dearth of ma
terial.
Numerous requests for the removal
of wood, boxes, and other inflamma
tory materials have gone unanswered
due to lack of assistance. Committee
chairmen, without helpers, found
themselves blocked in their efforts to
make this year's bonfire "bigger and
better."
