# Frosh Labor On Pyre Apathetic State Chairmen
## Campus Leaders Unanimously Condemn Poor Turnout Of Class of '33 
### Leonard Bartlett 
Apathy and indifference have en
compassed the class of 1933 in their
Big Game Bonfire building efforts.
Unless a last-minute spurt of pyre
building energy is displayed today,
this year's bonfire will be the smallest
in the history of Stanford Big Game
fire.
"Success of our Big Game Bonfire
has always been entirely dependent
upon the energy of the freshman
class," said Stanford Steinbeck, stu
dent body president, in viewing a situ
ation faced for the first time in the
annals of Stanford Big Game Bonfire
building.
Only twenty-one workers reported
for labor at three o'clock yesterday
afternoon, Phil Caldwell, engineer in
charge of construction, reported.
Seven trucks were on hand, but the
frosh to man them were missing.
Monday night more than 125 men
reported at the scene of the Golden
Bear's funeral fire; work went on rap
idly until midnight when all construc
tion ceased due to a dearth of ma
terial.
Numerous requests for the removal
of wood, boxes, and other inflamma
tory materials have gone unanswered
due to lack of assistance. Committee
