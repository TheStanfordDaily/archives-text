# JOHN BAKER'S DEATH DEPRIVES UNIVERSITY OF GREAT ENTHUSIAST
## 
### 
Known as one of Stanford's greatest
enthusiasts, John Baker, 76, who died
Monday from heart trouble in his
Mayfleld home, had been employed
by Stanford University for eighteen
years, first as head janitor, and later
in his waning years, as the man dele
gated to keep the Quad neat and tidy.
Although Baker had led a colorful
life, having served under the British
flag in the Boer War in Africa, he will
be remembered not so much for what
he did, as for what he was. His
eighteen years working on the campus
established him in the hearts fo Stan
ford people almost as a part of the
institution.
Those who had become accustomed
to seeing his slight figure through
the years, while he walked slowly
over the Quad, were familiar with his
jovial disposition and philosophical
nature.
At one time he was noted, in reply
ing to a query of President Wilbur,
who had asked him how business was,
that it was "Picking up, sir, picking
up."
According to his friends and fellow
workers, his loyalty to Stanford was
unsurpassed.
The following tribute was paid to
the life of John Baker by George B.
Culver, dean of men:
"I have just learned that John
Baker is dead. I shall miss the man
whose friendly morning greeting was
always a sort of inspiration to me.
Although his working tools were only
a rake, a broom, a dust-pan, John
Baker felt himself a part of Stanford,
and he was. To him the job of keeping
clean the area along the eastern side
of the Quad was an important one.
He made it a worth-while piece of
work.
"John Baker was a quaint philoso
pher in his way. He was always cheer
ful, always loyal to Stanford, and al
ways proud of his long connection
with the University.
"I shall miss John Baker's rich Irish
brogue, his droll sense of humor, and
his friendly heart. He was a faithful
workman, kindly and just in his esti
mates of men and events, and a man
worth knowing."
