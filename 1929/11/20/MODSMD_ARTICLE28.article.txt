# A 						MOTH-EATEN BONFIRE?
## 
### 
"As high as the frosh have time to make it."
This is the limit placed on the height of the Big Game Bonfire which
will burn tonight when the Cardinals go out to singe the Golden Bear.
At present, however, the Stanford pyre takes on the appearance of a
skinny flapper who has been on the Hollywood Eighteen Day diet. There
are four gaunt, bare stacks of ties marking the outline of the bonfire that
is to be, perhaps. There is scarcely any material between the ties, not
because there is no material available, but because there have not been
freshmen enough to gather it. At 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon there
were twenty-one freshmen working on the pyre, gathering wood and
aiding in actual construction. The frosh have had two days in which to
build this emblem of Stanford spirit. Unless they show an unusual burst
of enthusiasm and energy by sundown tonight, Stanford students at
tending the rally will be presented with something new in the fashions
of bonfires. The freshmen seem to have taken to heart the dictates of
the modistes who have decreed that silhouettes will be the mode for fall.
Stanford takes its bonfires seriously, even to the extent of voting about
them. The present generation of Stanford men and women have not seen
a Stanford team lose to California. Neither have they seen a Big Game
bonfire fizzle out. They have built three mammoth pyres and rebuilt one
that was larger than any of the rest in a day and a night.
Will the Class of 1933 be the first to lie down on the job?
