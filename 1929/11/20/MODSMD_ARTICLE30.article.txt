# ALL ATHLETICS ARE FINANCED BY FOOTBALL

### 
A university which ignored athletics, and made no provision for the
building of healthy bodies, would be performing a mere half-service. But
athletics arc not ignored at Washington. Students attending the univer
sity are given, at a nominal cost, the finest facilities for gymnasium work,
basketball, baseball, tennis, rowing, handball, golf, swimming, etc.
Football pays the shot for all of them. And unless the Washington
team is capable of giving the spectators a run for their money receipts
at the stadium will fall of!?. Then there will be a consequent curtailing
of other athletics.
The football coach at Washington has the entire athletic problem of
the institution on his shoulders. His success or failure has a vital bearing
on the physical development of every student. No single professor, ex
cepting the president himself, has so heavy a responsibility. No individual
on the campus is more open to criticism from faculty and students alike.
On no person are greater demands made.
The ideal of the University may be expressed in the words "mens sana
in corpore sano"—a sound mind in a sound body. The teaching faculty
looks after the first, the athletic directorate, the second. The lectures arc
financed by the state; athletics by football. The method may not be ques
tioned.—Western Tribune, Vancouver, B.C.
