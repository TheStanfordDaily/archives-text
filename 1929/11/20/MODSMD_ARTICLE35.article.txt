THEY STOOPED TO FOLLY, by El
len Glasgow. The Literary Guild,
Publishers. New York, 1929. At
the Stanford Bookstore.
"They Stooped to Folly" is a study
of various types of women, and the
effects upon them of the moral stand
ards of different periods. Aunt
Agatha, who fell from virtue in the
'80s, pays for her folly by a life of
spinsterhood and a sense of sin; Mrs.
Dalrymple, who "stooped" fifteen
years later, found solace in Europe
and numerous marriages; while Milly,
of the World War period, refused to
consider herself ruined in any way,
though she suffered, perhaps, more
than the others at the desertion of her
lover. The obvious moral is that fall
from virtue is purely a state of mind.
The male characters are not less
interesting. Marmaduke, an artist,
feels that he has gained the most hap
piness possible for him by carrying
on a vague courtship throughout his
life, without the least hope or desire
of marrying the object of his affec
tions. Martin, also an artist, finds
happiness nowhere and finally flees
to solitude.
Virginius Littlepage and his wife,
both the height of conventionality
from an exterior point of view, each
feel an inward sorrow and disappoint
ment at the lack of romance in their
lives, while each feels that this ro
mantic urge has been sacrificed for
love of the other.
Miss Glasgow preaches, fortunately,
no crusade; she has no evangelical
aim, moral or immoral. The charac
teristic of each person, be it love,
faith, duty, or desire for intense life,
is, at the same time, the grief and
the salvation of its possessor.
"It is a hard world for artists," but
no one is crushed as they would have
been in the hands of an uncompromis
ing realist; no one is allowed to "live
happily ever after" as they would
have been in the hands of Harold Bell !
Wright. It is in this moderation that
Ellen Glasgow's novel approaches
greatness. —E. E. W.

BORGIA, by Zona Gale. Alfred E.
Knopf, N.Y. 1929. (At the Alcove
Book Shop.)
Borgia is more a psychological
study, exceedingly skillful and pene
trating, than a real novel. It is a
Bmooth and brilliant achievement, yet
from the natural human point of view
! it is too eccentric, and too cold.
The main character is a girl who is
I under a delusion that she is a sort
of incarnate Nemesis. She brings de
struction to every person with whom
she comes Into contact. The force of
this delusion is strong enough to dis
tort her belief in herself, so that she
shrinks from associating with both
her family and her friends. Several
years of her life are made blank aud
fruitless because of the self-aversion
| that gradually takes hold of her.
Zona Gale's work here is very dis
tinguished. She has three objectives.
First, to put together certain incidents
that will be peculiar enough to make
the so-called Borgia's delusion under
standable, and half justified, and at
the same time incidents possible and
natural enough to make the situation
creditable; second, to show that a
unique and corroding selfishness is
the real cause for the strange warp in
the girl's nature that brings her and
others so much misery—and in this
point lies the greatest artistry of the
book. Her aim is to provide outside
forces that will awaken the girl to a
realization of her terrific egotism, and
ultimately cure her. All of this appar
ently happens, but the tone of the
book and the characters in this third
stage seem artificial and harsh.
However, this artificiality may be
due to the fact that Miss Gale has
branched off into an exposition of
what almost amounts to a philosophy
of life —the philosophy of Harmony.
This idea of social, moral, and emo
tional synchronization is not a new
one of course, but Zona Gale makes
it seem extraordinarily strong and
plausible because she uses concrete
example to such unusual advantage.

First, to put together certain incidents
that will be peculiar enough to make
the so-called Borgia's delusion under
standable, and half justified, and at
the same time incidents possible and
natural enough to make the situation
creditable; second, to show that a
unique and corroding selfishness is
the real cause for the strange warp in
the girl's nature that brings her and
others so much misery—and in this
point lies the greatest artistry of the
book. Her aim is to provide outside
forces that will awaken the girl to a
realization of her terrific egotism, and
ultimately cure her. All of this appar
ently happens, but the tone of the
book and the characters in this third
stage seem artificial and harsh.
However, this artificiality may be
due to the fact that Miss Gale has
branched off into an exposition of
what almost amounts to a philosophy
of life —the philosophy of Harmony.
This idea of social, moral, and emo

one of course, but Zona Gale makes
it seem extraordinarily strong and
plausible because she uses concrete
example to such unusual advantage.

THEY STOOPED TO FOLLY, by El
len Glasgow. The Literary Guild,
Publishers. New York, 1929. At
the Stanford Bookstore.
"They Stooped to Folly" is a study
of various types of women, and the
effects upon them of the moral stand
ards of different periods. Aunt
Agatha, who fell from virtue in the
'80s, pays for her folly by a life of
spinsterhood and a sense of sin; Mrs.
Dalrymple, who "stooped" fifteen
years later, found solace in Europe
and numerous marriages; while Milly,
of the World War period, refused to
consider herself ruined in any way,
though she suffered, perhaps, more
than the others at the desertion of her
lover. The obvious moral is that fall
from virtue is purely a state of mind.
The male characters are not less
interesting. Marmaduke, an artist,
feels that he has gained the most hap
piness possible for him by carrying
on a vague courtship throughout his
life, without the least hope or desire
of marrying the object of his affec
tions. Martin, also an artist, finds
happiness nowhere and finally flees
to solitude.
Virginius Littlepage and his wife,
both the height of conventionality
from an exterior point of view, each
feel an inward sorrow and disappoint
ment at the lack of romance in their
lives, while each feels that this ro
mantic urge has been sacrificed for
love of the other.
Miss Glasgow preaches, fortunately,
no crusade; she has no evangelical
aim, moral or immoral. The charac
teristic of each person, be it love,
faith, duty, or desire for intense life,
is, at the same time, the grief and
the salvation of its possessor.
"It is a hard world for artists," but
no one is crushed as they would have
been in the hands of an uncompromis
ing realist; no one is allowed to "live
happily ever after" as they would
have been in the hands of Harold Bell !
Wright. It is in this moderation that
Ellen Glasgow's novel approaches
greatness. —E. E. W.

BORGIA, by Zona Gale. Alfred E.
Knopf, N.Y. 1929. (At the Alcove
Book Shop.)
Borgia is more a psychological
study, exceedingly skillful and pene
trating, than a real novel. It is a
Bmooth and brilliant achievement, yet
from the natural human point of view
! it is too eccentric, and too cold.
The main character is a girl who is
I under a delusion that she is a sort
of incarnate Nemesis. She brings de
struction to every person with whom
she comes Into contact. The force of
this delusion is strong enough to dis
tort her belief in herself, so that she
shrinks from associating with both
her family and her friends. Several
years of her life are made blank aud
fruitless because of the self-aversion
| that gradually takes hold of her.

BORGIA, by Zona Gale. Alfred E.
Knopf, N.Y. 1929. (At the Alcove
Book Shop.)
Borgia is more a psychological
study, exceedingly skillful and pene
trating, than a real novel. It is a
Bmooth and brilliant achievement, yet
from the natural human point of view
! it is too eccentric, and too cold.
The main character is a girl who is
I under a delusion that she is a sort
of incarnate Nemesis. She brings de
struction to every person with whom
she comes Into contact. The force of
this delusion is strong enough to dis
tort her belief in herself, so that she
shrinks from associating with both
her family and her friends. Several
years of her life are made blank aud
fruitless because of the self-aversion
| that gradually takes hold of her.
Zona Gale's work here is very dis
tinguished. She has three objectives.
First, to put together certain incidents
that will be peculiar enough to make
the so-called Borgia's delusion under
standable, and half justified, and at
the same time incidents possible and
natural enough to make the situation
creditable; second, to show that a
unique and corroding selfishness is
the real cause for the strange warp in
the girl's nature that brings her and
others so much misery—and in this
point lies the greatest artistry of the
book. Her aim is to provide outside
forces that will awaken the girl to a
realization of her terrific egotism, and
ultimately cure her. All of this appar
ently happens, but the tone of the
book and the characters in this third
stage seem artificial and harsh.
However, this artificiality may be
due to the fact that Miss Gale has
branched off into an exposition of
what almost amounts to a philosophy
of life —the philosophy of Harmony.
This idea of social, moral, and emo
tional synchronization is not a new
one of course, but Zona Gale makes
it seem extraordinarily strong and
plausible because she uses concrete
example to such unusual advantage.

THEY STOOPED TO FOLLY, by El
len Glasgow. The Literary Guild,
Publishers. New York, 1929. At
the Stanford Bookstore.
"They Stooped to Folly" is a study
of various types of women, and the
effects upon them of the moral stand
ards of different periods. Aunt
Agatha, who fell from virtue in the
'80s, pays for her folly by a life of
spinsterhood and a sense of sin; Mrs.
Dalrymple, who "stooped" fifteen
years later, found solace in Europe
and numerous marriages; while Milly,
of the World War period, refused to
consider herself ruined in any way,
though she suffered, perhaps, more
than the others at the desertion of her
lover. The obvious moral is that fall
from virtue is purely a state of mind.
The male characters are not less
interesting. Marmaduke, an artist,
feels that he has gained the most hap
piness possible for him by carrying
on a vague courtship throughout his
life, without the least hope or desire
of marrying the object of his affec
tions. Martin, also an artist, finds
happiness nowhere and finally flees
to solitude.
Virginius Littlepage and his wife,
both the height of conventionality
from an exterior point of view, each
feel an inward sorrow and disappoint
ment at the lack of romance in their
lives, while each feels that this ro
mantic urge has been sacrificed for
love of the other.
Miss Glasgow preaches, fortunately,
no crusade; she has no evangelical
aim, moral or immoral. The charac
teristic of each person, be it love,
faith, duty, or desire for intense life,
is, at the same time, the grief and
the salvation of its possessor.
"It is a hard world for artists," but

been in the hands of an uncompromis
