# Campus Opinion
## AND THE GOOD-WILL FLOWS ON 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It would seem to me that our Daily
Editor is indeed hard-pressed for ma
terial on which to air his views. I
suppose that in this age when we feel
free to express ourselves in any man
ner upon each and every subject, his
first editorial in yesterday's paper
might be condoned. But even so, I
think that in this particular case he
might have allowed wisdom the call
over valor and reconciled himself to
the inevitable. Nothing was to be
gained from such childish "griping."
The Assembly was definitely agreed
upon and to carry on in such a syni
cal tone, to say the least, is indicative
of a poor loser.
And again—it wouldn't have been
so bad if the picture were really so
black as he painted it. I have been
to six or seven of these Good Will As
semblies and have yet to notice any
thing wrong with them. If I remember
correctly our Good Will Assembly be
fore the U.S.C. game kind of made

j the rally that same night look sick.
• A comparison of the spirit, pep, and
J enjoyment at the two is not flattering
to the rally.
And again—please, Mr. Editor, don't
; be so naive as to think we are ignor
j ant of the real function of these
\ rallies. You know, and we know, that
: they do not operate to build any bond
i of sentimentality between the two
; student bodies that might hamper our
| expression of school spirit. They do
I give us an opportunity to show off
j and sing a few songs where we can
: hear the effect ourselves, and be
stimulated thereby. Also, there are
some of us tolerant enough to enjoy
listening to the representative head
of a great rival student body.
In closing I wish to request—
"Please, Mr. Editor, be careful in your
j expression of 'campus opinion,'' lest
you make of your devoted constitu
ents a defenseless target for ridicule
and condemnation."
—Vincent Mires, '30.

The Editor, Sir:
It would seem to me that our Daily
Editor is indeed hard-pressed for ma
terial on which to air his views. I
suppose that in this age when we feel
free to express ourselves in any man
ner upon each and every subject, his
first editorial in yesterday's paper
might be condoned. But even so, I
think that in this particular case he
might have allowed wisdom the call
over valor and reconciled himself to
the inevitable. Nothing was to be
gained from such childish "griping."
The Assembly was definitely agreed
upon and to carry on in such a syni
cal tone, to say the least, is indicative
of a poor loser.
And again—it wouldn't have been
so bad if the picture were really so
black as he painted it. I have been
to six or seven of these Good Will As
semblies and have yet to notice any
thing wrong with them. If I remember
correctly our Good Will Assembly be
fore the U.S.C. game kind of made

j the rally that same night look sick.
• A comparison of the spirit, pep, and
J enjoyment at the two is not flattering
to the rally.
And again—please, Mr. Editor, don't
; be so naive as to think we are ignor
j ant of the real function of these
\ rallies. You know, and we know, that
: they do not operate to build any bond
i of sentimentality between the two
; student bodies that might hamper our
| expression of school spirit. They do
I give us an opportunity to show off
j and sing a few songs where we can
: hear the effect ourselves, and be
stimulated thereby. Also, there are
some of us tolerant enough to enjoy
listening to the representative head
of a great rival student body.
In closing I wish to request—
"Please, Mr. Editor, be careful in your
j expression of 'campus opinion,'' lest
you make of your devoted constitu
ents a defenseless target for ridicule
and condemnation."
