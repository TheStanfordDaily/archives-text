# SOME DAY WE ALL SHALL BE ALUMNI

### 
The Editor, Sir:
At present, there is quite a bit of
discussion as to whether or not Stan
ford students should be allowed two
Big Game tickets. The limiting of the
number of tickets sold to members of
the A.S.S.U. is intended to crush
"scalping" by students. The extra
tickets are intended for alumni.
In my estimation, the active stu
dents have a better right to the tick
ets than the alumni. It is our game,

our team. The alumnus has had his
day; it is our turn. For the most part,
it is the parents of the students that
are putting up the money for his edu
cation. Their interest in the Big Game
usually dies after the student's gradu
ation, but during his four years, their
excitement and interest runs high.
They want two tickets, and they want
it now. Why give those two tickets to
an old grad?
