## A 						BEAR EDGE? 
### 
Now that bull sessions have changed
to Big Game sessions and the game
itself has been played and replayed
over every grub and tea table on the
Farm, it has been concluded by the
unanimous vote of skirt- and cord-clad
critics in these parts that fate is fickle
and raises hell in general with what
is commonly known as the gridiron
dope bucket.
For when the curtain rolled up
not so long ago to open the an
nual fall pigskin revue, the Cardi
nals and the Trojans were heavy
favorites to battle it out for the
1929 Pacific Coast football cham
pionship. California was just an
other "also ran."
But within the period of four short
week-ends, the stage setting has been
completely reversed. The two so
called main eventers have fallen by
the wayside, kayoed with resounding
clouts to the chin, while the lowly
Bear has steadily risen to the top of
the title-contending list.
By some strange and Houdini
like metamorphosis, a mangy taxi
dermist's specimen has suddenly
grown into a growling, mauling,
clawing Golden Bear!
How come this unlooked for po
tency? Is His Nibs actually a wizard?
Have the Bears really improved so
much?
It is the honest and humble opinion
of certain blurb artists, who hang out
somewhere in the shadows of the
Berkeley Campanile, and other tripe
hounds, gracing the quiet sanctitudes
of the Stanford homestead, that the
inspired playing of the Blue and Gold
forward wall has brought about this
confident, winning attitude of the Cali
fornia varsity!
Brick Morse recently called the
Bears the Marvel Team. Well, as per
usual, this staunchest supporter of
Cal is a little off tune. Not that Nibs
Price hasn't got a winning ball club
this year, yet the team as a whole
is not so marvelous. In fact, the Bear
backfield is about on a par with last
year's pigskin-packing quartet.
The real improvement has been in
line play alone. Last season Captain
Roy Riegels was little better than the
average Coast center, while the Cali
fornia guards were more than medi
ocre. Added to that Nibs lost his two
best linemen through graduation in
the spring—Captain Phillips at end,
and Steve Bancroft at tackle.
Today, however, the Golden
Bear boasts a solid wall from end
to end. No team has been able to
puncture it for consistent gains at
any time. And if Cal, logical fa
vorite in Saturday's clash, is said
to have an edge over the Cards at
all, it is in this hard charging
line of seven stalwarts.
The Bear is well fixed at center.
According to an article printed in the
Daily Californian a couple of days
ago, "despite the efforts of Giant Paul
Jessup, captain and center of the
Huskies, Riegels is still all-Coast
pivot man." Now that's coming out in
pretty bold print—especially since
Stanford boasts of one Walt Heinecke
at center on its grid machine. Without
a doubt, these two young men are the
best iu their line on the western
slopes. But as yet, how is one so
omnipotent as to say that one of them
is better than the other.
Last year Mr. Heinecke rather
maltreated his rival on one hectic
afternoon. Pop is looking for him
to repeat this week-end. At all
events, the Big Game is bound to
decide who will be all-Coast cen
ter for 1929, and probably all-
American choice as well!
California must be conceded a de
cided edge at the guard berths. Stan
ford lias been handicapped all year
with injuries and, as a consequence,
its interference has not clicked to
perfection. On the other hand, Nibs
has been blessed with two complete
sets of high-class guards. One of these
lads, Bert Schwartz, has even been
named as an all-American possibility.
The rest of the lines are of equal
strength, practically speaking. Ted
Beckett and Ray Tandy, at tackle, and
Captain Mush Muller and Bob Nor
ton, at end, are probably the outstand
ing men at their respective positions.
Muller, though not In the best of
shape for the clash, is one of the best
ball hawks this side of the Rockies
and will be a marked man on Satur
day.
Take your choice, Mr. Football
Fan. But choose with prudence.
Potentially the lines are on a par,
with the exception of the two
guard positions. And the return
of Pete Heiser to form three days
hence may make a whale of a
difference as to this slight edge.

Captain Mush Muller and Bob Nor
ton, at end, are probably the outstand
ing men at their respective positions.
Muller, though not In the best of
shape for the clash, is one of the best
ball hawks this side of the Rockies
and will be a marked man on Satur
day.
Take your choice, Mr. Football
Fan. But choose with prudence.
Potentially the lines are on a par,
with the exception of the two
guard positions. And the return
of Pete Heiser to form three days
hence may make a whale of a
difference as to this slight edge.

Now that bull sessions have changed
to Big Game sessions and the game
itself has been played and replayed
over every grub and tea table on the
Farm, it has been concluded by the
unanimous vote of skirt- and cord-clad
critics in these parts that fate is fickle
and raises hell in general with what
is commonly known as the gridiron
dope bucket.
For when the curtain rolled up
not so long ago to open the an
nual fall pigskin revue, the Cardi
nals and the Trojans were heavy
favorites to battle it out for the
1929 Pacific Coast football cham
pionship. California was just an
other "also ran."
But within the period of four short
week-ends, the stage setting has been
completely reversed. The two so
called main eventers have fallen by
the wayside, kayoed with resounding
clouts to the chin, while the lowly
Bear has steadily risen to the top of
the title-contending list.
By some strange and Houdini
like metamorphosis, a mangy taxi
dermist's specimen has suddenly
grown into a growling, mauling,
clawing Golden Bear!
How come this unlooked for po
tency? Is His Nibs actually a wizard?
Have the Bears really improved so
much?
It is the honest and humble opinion
of certain blurb artists, who hang out
somewhere in the shadows of the
Berkeley Campanile, and other tripe
hounds, gracing the quiet sanctitudes
of the Stanford homestead, that the
inspired playing of the Blue and Gold
forward wall has brought about this
confident, winning attitude of the Cali
fornia varsity!
Brick Morse recently called the
Bears the Marvel Team. Well, as per
usual, this staunchest supporter of
Cal is a little off tune. Not that Nibs
Price hasn't got a winning ball club
this year, yet the team as a whole
is not so marvelous. In fact, the Bear
backfield is about on a par with last
year's pigskin-packing quartet.
The real improvement has been in
line play alone. Last season Captain
Roy Riegels was little better than the
average Coast center, while the Cali
fornia guards were more than medi
ocre. Added to that Nibs lost his two
best linemen through graduation in
the spring—Captain Phillips at end,
and Steve Bancroft at tackle.
Today, however, the Golden
Bear boasts a solid wall from end
to end. No team has been able to
puncture it for consistent gains at
any time. And if Cal, logical fa
vorite in Saturday's clash, is said
to have an edge over the Cards at
all, it is in this hard charging
line of seven stalwarts.
The Bear is well fixed at center.
According to an article printed in the
Daily Californian a couple of days
ago, "despite the efforts of Giant Paul
Jessup, captain and center of the
Huskies, Riegels is still all-Coast
pivot man." Now that's coming out in
pretty bold print—especially since
Stanford boasts of one Walt Heinecke
at center on its grid machine. Without
a doubt, these two young men are the
best iu their line on the western
slopes. But as yet, how is one so
omnipotent as to say that one of them
is better than the other.
Last year Mr. Heinecke rather
maltreated his rival on one hectic
afternoon. Pop is looking for him
to repeat this week-end. At all
events, the Big Game is bound to
decide who will be all-Coast cen
ter for 1929, and probably all-
American choice as well!
California must be conceded a de
cided edge at the guard berths. Stan
ford lias been handicapped all year
with injuries and, as a consequence,
its interference has not clicked to
perfection. On the other hand, Nibs
has been blessed with two complete
sets of high-class guards. One of these
lads, Bert Schwartz, has even been
named as an all-American possibility.
The rest of the lines are of equal
strength, practically speaking. Ted
Beckett and Ray Tandy, at tackle, and
Captain Mush Muller and Bob Nor
ton, at end, are probably the outstand
ing men at their respective positions.

decide who will be all-Coast cen
ter for 1929, and probably all-
American choice as well!
California must be conceded a de
cided edge at the guard berths. Stan
ford lias been handicapped all year
with injuries and, as a consequence,
its interference has not clicked to
perfection. On the other hand, Nibs
has been blessed with two complete
sets of high-class guards. One of these
lads, Bert Schwartz, has even been
named as an all-American possibility.
The rest of the lines are of equal
strength, practically speaking. Ted
Beckett and Ray Tandy, at tackle, and
Captain Mush Muller and Bob Nor
ton, at end, are probably the outstand
ing men at their respective positions.
Muller, though not In the best of
shape for the clash, is one of the best
ball hawks this side of the Rockies
and will be a marked man on Satur
day.
Take your choice, Mr. Football
Fan. But choose with prudence.
Potentially the lines are on a par,
with the exception of the two
guard positions. And the return
of Pete Heiser to form three days
hence may make a whale of a
difference as to this slight edge.
—By S. Dietrich.
Now that bull sessions have changed
to Big Game sessions and the game
itself has been played and replayed
over every grub and tea table on the
Farm, it has been concluded by the
unanimous vote of skirt- and cord-clad
critics in these parts that fate is fickle
and raises hell in general with what
is commonly known as the gridiron
dope bucket.
For when the curtain rolled up
not so long ago to open the an
nual fall pigskin revue, the Cardi
nals and the Trojans were heavy
favorites to battle it out for the
1929 Pacific Coast football cham
pionship. California was just an
other "also ran."
But within the period of four short
week-ends, the stage setting has been
completely reversed. The two so
called main eventers have fallen by
the wayside, kayoed with resounding
clouts to the chin, while the lowly
Bear has steadily risen to the top of
the title-contending list.
By some strange and Houdini
like metamorphosis, a mangy taxi
dermist's specimen has suddenly
grown into a growling, mauling,
clawing Golden Bear!
How come this unlooked for po
tency? Is His Nibs actually a wizard?
Have the Bears really improved so
much?
It is the honest and humble opinion
of certain blurb artists, who hang out
somewhere in the shadows of the
Berkeley Campanile, and other tripe
hounds, gracing the quiet sanctitudes
of the Stanford homestead, that the
inspired playing of the Blue and Gold
forward wall has brought about this
confident, winning attitude of the Cali
fornia varsity!
Brick Morse recently called the
Bears the Marvel Team. Well, as per
usual, this staunchest supporter of
Cal is a little off tune. Not that Nibs
Price hasn't got a winning ball club
this year, yet the team as a whole
is not so marvelous. In fact, the Bear
backfield is about on a par with last
year's pigskin-packing quartet.
The real improvement has been in
line play alone. Last season Captain
Roy Riegels was little better than the
average Coast center, while the Cali
fornia guards were more than medi
ocre. Added to that Nibs lost his two
best linemen through graduation in
the spring—Captain Phillips at end,
and Steve Bancroft at tackle.
Today, however, the Golden
Bear boasts a solid wall from end
to end. No team has been able to
puncture it for consistent gains at
any time. And if Cal, logical fa
vorite in Saturday's clash, is said
to have an edge over the Cards at
all, it is in this hard charging
line of seven stalwarts.
The Bear is well fixed at center.
According to an article printed in the
Daily Californian a couple of days
ago, "despite the efforts of Giant Paul
Jessup, captain and center of the
Huskies, Riegels is still all-Coast
pivot man." Now that's coming out in
pretty bold print—especially since
Stanford boasts of one Walt Heinecke
at center on its grid machine. Without
a doubt, these two young men are the
best iu their line on the western
slopes. But as yet, how is one so
omnipotent as to say that one of them
is better than the other.
Last year Mr. Heinecke rather
maltreated his rival on one hectic
afternoon. Pop is looking for him
to repeat this week-end. At all
events, the Big Game is bound to
decide who will be all-Coast cen
ter for 1929, and probably all-
American choice as well!
