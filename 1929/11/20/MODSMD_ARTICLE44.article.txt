# FROM ELECTRICIAN TO STAR IS RECORD OF GEORGE O'BRIEN; HOPES FOR CARD VICTORY
## 
### Ben Maddox 
From sixth assistant electrician to
star is the record of George O'Brien,
male lead in "Salute," and son of Dan
O'Brien, San Francisco's police chief.
"Salute" is now playing at the Varsity
Theatre in Palo Alto.
"We went back to Annapolis to take
our exterior scenes for 'Salute,' the
climax of which is the annual Army-
Navy game," O'Brien explained. "We
took more than a dozen members of
the U.S.C. varsity along to play in
our movie version of the game—using
shots of the real game as background
for ours.
Leaves Santa Clara
"I'd never have been in the movies
if I hadn't left Santa Clara. You see,"
O'Brien continued, "I played for Poly
High in San Francisco for three years.
Then when war was declared I en
listed on submarine chaser 297." It
was then that the Hollywood star,
while acting as trainer for the light
heavyweight champion of the navy,
forgot himself and knocked the champ
cold.

"After the Armistice, I found that
all ray old teammates at Poly High
had gone to Santa Clara. So I enrolled
as a pre-med, but didn't finish out the
year —decided I wanted to start mak
ing some money of my own. Tom Mix
had promised me a Job, so I went to
Hollywood and began as a prop boy.
"Funny, but I was never much in
terested in college plays at Santa
Clara," says O'Brien. "Now I'd like
to do something on the legitimate
stage, I've had some good offers to
appear on Broadway, too, but I'm tied
up in pictures for the present.
Hoped To Do "Redskin"
"I hope the fellows at Stanford will
like our football game in 'Salute' as
much as I'm going to enjoy Stanford's
victory next Saturday. You know I
wanted to do 'Redskin,' the story of
an Indian boy who went to college and
became a great track star. I'd hoped
that my company would buy it for
me, and that we could take the track
scenes in the Stanford bowl. But by
the time I'd argued them into seeing
it may way, the story had been bought
for Richard Dix."
