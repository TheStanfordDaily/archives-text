# "Pop" Warner Criticizes Carnegie Institute Action
## 
### 
That the Carnegie Institute showed
poor judgment in publishing its report at
the peak of the football season is the
opinion of "Pop" Warner, expressed at
the Mothers' Club tea in the Women's
Clubhouse yesterday afternoon.
Coach Warner believes that more harm
than good was done. Many people took
the attitude that an athlete was entitled
to all the advantages that he could le
gitimately get. If the report had been
made in the spring, however, when inter
est in athletics naturally lags, the desired
effect would 110 doubt have been pro
duced.
In closing, "Pop" said, "Stanford has
higher ideals athletically and uses fewer
inducements to obtain outstanding ath
letes than any other college with the ex
ception of Cornell."
