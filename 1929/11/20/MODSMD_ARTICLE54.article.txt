# Lights To Be Installed On Campus Roads Game Night
## 
### 
Electric lights will be installed on |
campus roads surrounding the sta-'
dium for use during Big Game night, j
according to Edgar Schroder, clerk
of the corporation yards.
Roads are being put in condition
this week in preparation for the heavy
traffic. Cables and signs along Palm
Drive to keep cars off the plants will
be put up Friday.
Repairs on the stadium roads and
sign painting for the booths and en- 1
trances are being given preference,
over other University work, Schroder
said.
