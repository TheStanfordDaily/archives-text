worth-while inspecting because
no other overcoats are like it

there would be little incentive for you to come

Highgate styles are exclusive too, being designed
after actual field surveys of University men's style
tendencies and preferences . . . The 4 'TOPPER''
is worth your while to inspect, because no other
overcoat approaches it in appearance and style | j <jj> f*
