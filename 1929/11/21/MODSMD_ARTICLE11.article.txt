# "BOOM" DRUMM SWIMS ASHORE IN HASTE TO REACH CAMPUS FOR RALLY
## 
### Reid Briggs 
The strain of his hasty trip from
Siam has told on Hardy L. "Boom"
Drumm. The grand old boy, now an
octogenarian, swam ashore from his
boat as it neared San Francisco yes
terday evening, as is his custom.
Even then, he was wearing his nar
row, gold-rimmed spectacles and his
old hat. The full dress coat which
"Boom" invariably wears was on his
back.
After pausing for breath, "Boom"
Drumm was eager to talk of the cattle
business which he left to come to the
Big Game.
Stanford Spirit
"The Stanford spirit of success
which permeates the government of
the United States with my fellow
students 'Tubby' Hoover and 'Lanky'
Wilbur followed me into the Siamese
cattle industry. Ah, me, there's noth
ing like romping with my pet flying
bulls for good, clean fun! And I may
add that the bulls . . . they fly high
in Siam!"
Drumm was emphatic in his agree
ment with his old friend, Delmar

Daves, who deplored the passing of
the Stanford "hello" custom. "Boom"
was deeply hurt when he rushed onto
the campus and found that only a few
echoes greeted his enthusiastic shouts
to several students.
Romantic Traditions
"I wish," said Hardy Drumm, with
sincere feeling, "that we could all
realize that quibbling over traditions
has been the result of a warped view
point. College traditions should mean
all the color of the great college of
venture; to deny yourself that adven
ture is to lose all the romance of your
life at Stanford."
"Boom" Drumm founded the Broth
erly Order of Red and Screaming
Eagles Who Fly by Night and Rest by
Day, at Stanford during his last year
here, 1895. The order, which was in
spired by the first great Stanford vic
tory over California, meets annually
on the night of the Big Game. Drumm,
as international president emeritus of
the 8.0.R.5.E.W.F.N.R.D., will preside
at the gathering Saturday night, with
all the pomp and plenty of the old tra
ditional ceremony.

point. College traditions should mean
all the color of the great college of
venture; to deny yourself that adven
ture is to lose all the romance of your
life at Stanford."
"Boom" Drumm founded the Broth
erly Order of Red and Screaming
Eagles Who Fly by Night and Rest by
Day, at Stanford during his last year
here, 1895. The order, which was in
spired by the first great Stanford vic
tory over California, meets annually
on the night of the Big Game. Drumm,
as international president emeritus of
the 8.0.R.5.E.W.F.N.R.D., will preside
at the gathering Saturday night, with
all the pomp and plenty of the old tra
ditional ceremony.
The strain of his hasty trip from
Siam has told on Hardy L. "Boom"
Drumm. The grand old boy, now an
octogenarian, swam ashore from his
boat as it neared San Francisco yes
terday evening, as is his custom.
Even then, he was wearing his nar
row, gold-rimmed spectacles and his
old hat. The full dress coat which
"Boom" invariably wears was on his
back.
After pausing for breath, "Boom"
Drumm was eager to talk of the cattle
business which he left to come to the
Big Game.
Stanford Spirit
"The Stanford spirit of success
which permeates the government of
the United States with my fellow
students 'Tubby' Hoover and 'Lanky'
Wilbur followed me into the Siamese
cattle industry. Ah, me, there's noth
ing like romping with my pet flying
bulls for good, clean fun! And I may
add that the bulls . . . they fly high
in Siam!"
Drumm was emphatic in his agree
ment with his old friend, Delmar

Daves, who deplored the passing of
the Stanford "hello" custom. "Boom"
was deeply hurt when he rushed onto
the campus and found that only a few
echoes greeted his enthusiastic shouts
to several students.
Romantic Traditions
"I wish," said Hardy Drumm, with
sincere feeling, "that we could all
realize that quibbling over traditions
has been the result of a warped view
point. College traditions should mean
all the color of the great college of
venture; to deny yourself that adven
ture is to lose all the romance of your
life at Stanford."
