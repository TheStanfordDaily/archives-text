# VARSITY ENTERS SECLUSION UNTIL GAME SATURDAY
## Warner Plans Light Signal Drill, Chalk Talk To Keep Men Primed For U.C. Tilt 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Somewhere in seclusion in the foot
hills not so far from the campus are
Coach Pop Warner and his forty-nine
varsity players, on whom Stanford is
hanking to stop California's Golden
Bear. The Cards left the Farm imme
diately following last night's Big Game
Rally and are not scheduled to re
turn until time to don their white
jerseys and red moleskins on Satur
day.
Although supposed to be resting up
for the week-end's blue ribbon grid
iron event, the Cardinals will in real
ity spend today and tomorrow quite
actively. Instead of sitting around
twiddling their thumbs, the players
will be preparing to give the Bears a
rough, tough reception. Besides a cou
ple of chalk talks, Pop is planning to
have his charges run through their
signals in order to have the big Red
offense tuned up to perfection.
Finishing Touches
While the Redshirts are preparing
to make their last stand, over across
the bay near Berkeley the Golden
Bear is putting on finishing touches for
the game, the outcome of which will
determine whether or not the Blue and
Gold is football champ of 1929. Fa
vored to win in a walk, reports from
the Bear camp have it that Nibs Price
will be taking no chances on Satur
day. Nibs' bag of tricks will be raked
to the very bottom in an effort to
down the Cards.
Lucky in that they have not been
hindered by injuries so far this sea
son, the hoys from Berkeley will put
their full strength on the field. The
entire Bear first string is in the best
of shape for the clash, with the same
team that trounced U.S.C. scheduled
to open up again Saturday. Captain
Riegels' knee is 0.k., and the fighting
Bear leader is expected to give Walt
Heinecke more than enough competi
tion at the center position.
Rice Not To Start
The only player that may not be
ready for action is Lee Rice, elusive
halfback. Nibs had been planning to
start Rice in the Big Game, but will
be forced to use Ed Griffiths instead.
However, Griffiths is not a second
rate back in any sense of the word,
having starred in both the Penn and
Trojan encounters. At the present
time it is a toss-up whether Bob Calm
or Dolph Timmerman will start at
left tackle. Cahn, though only a sopho
more, is a smashing linesman, but
Timmerman may get the call because
of his greater experience.
