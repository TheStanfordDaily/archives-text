### 
The following letter of good wishes
for the success of the Stanford varsity
against California was received yes
terday by Stanford Steinbeck, presi
dent of the Associated Students, from
Ray Lyman Wilbur, president of the
University and Secretary of the In
terior:
Washington, Nov. 17, 1929.
Dear Mr. President:
One of the great drawbacks to being
liere in Washington is to be kept
away from the Stanford campus at
the time of a game with the Univer
sity of California.
I have been watching these contests
for many years with the keenest in
terest and satisfaction. While I realize
that one of us must lose in nearly
every contest, I hope that it will not
be our turn this year. The members
of our squad have such high qualities
that I have confidence that they will
come through. The underdog position
is not unfamiliar to Stanford. Our
teams have always done their best
under such conditions.
It will be a great pleasure to us
here to join in the celebration of a
victory, but whatever the result, we
feel sure that the Stanford team will
reflect the greatest credit upon itself
by its performance.
My heartiest best wishes go to
every one of them.
Very sincerely yours,
Ray Lyman Wilbur.
