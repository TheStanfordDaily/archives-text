# PASSING OF "HELLO" CUSTOM AT STANFORD REGRETTED BY DAVES
## 
### 
Delmar Daves, Rally Committee
member, and senior class president
in 1926, expressed great eagerness to
see his old friend, "Boom" Drumm,
when interviewed yesterday afternoon.
The lack of the traditional Stanford
"hello" spirit was quite a shock to
Daves. He said:
"My greatest regret is to see the
passing of the 'hello' custom. It was
a great benefit to every student, and
encouraged a much greater unity and
friendship in the student body. 'Hello'
meant a great deal to every entering
Stanford student; it put a fine warm
spot in his heart and was the founda
tion of a true love for Stanford."
Daves felt that a Stanford spirit
does exist, but that it is marred by a
sophisticated attitude of aloofness. He
urged that every student be natural,
and show an enthusiasm which, Daves
believes, he has hidden under a veneer
of high-hattedness.
"Instead of demanding a great dis
play of effort and time from the
freshmen and a large and very evi
dent show of relaxation on the part of
the upperclassmen, I think the bonfire
should be built by the entire student
body in a much shorter time than
under the present plan.
"A show of spirit and spontaneous,
natural enthusiasm on the part of
every student would build a bonfire
very quickly. The rapid construction
of a great pyre like the one last year
should be the rule every year."
