# BIG CHIEF HOSTEEN NEZ WILL BE GOOD MEDICINE FOR GAME
## 
### 
"Big Chief Hosteen Nez" may
become the traditional symbol
of victory in Big Game classics,
and take his place on a par with
the old iron bucket for which
Purdue and Indiana fight, or the
brown jug of Michigan-Minnesota
fame.
Coach Pop Warner received
yesterday from an anonymous
donor an oil painting of a stately
Indian chieftain. Accompanying
the portrait was a note explain
ing that the picture was to be
kept by Coach Warner as "good
medicine" if the Cardinals were
victorious in the Big Game. In
the event of a Bear triumph,
Chieftain Hosteen Nez was to be
sent to his "Nibs" in Berkeley
where "the eminent chieftain
will hang his head in shame un
til rescued by a Stanford vic
tory."
