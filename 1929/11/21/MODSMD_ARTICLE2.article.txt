# SILK FROM SOW'S EAR IS CHEMICAL PROCESS ACCORDING TO McBAIN

" 'You can not make a silk purse
out of a sow's ear,' the old saying
goes, but it remained for chemistry
to disprove it," said Professor J. W.
Mcßain of the chemistry department,
the other day."A silk really has been
developed from that origin. Artificial
silk from sow's ears may be only a
chemical stunt, but artificial silk from
other sources is one of the important
modern discoveries.
"Chemistry is the science of the
transformation of matter," he con
tinued, "lying at the basis of all hu
man industry and of such applied sci
ences as agriclulture and medicine. I
do not wish, however, to lend support
to the false impression, which is only
too current, that chemistry is a kind
of black magic. On the contrary, the
modern chemist tries to plan a reac
tion just as the engineer plans a
bridge, with the same deliberate de
sign and sustained purpose."
