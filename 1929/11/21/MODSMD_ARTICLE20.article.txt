# BONFIRE ROASTS BEAR AFTER GREAT RALLY; 5000 WATCH BURNING
## 
### Leonard Bartlett 
Hopes of Stanford were high last
night when five thousand bonfire-en
circling enthusiasts watched Golden
Bear meat sizzle and roast as crack
ling flames of the 1929 Big Game bon
fire shed a brilliant glow over the
Farm.
Scarcely had the colorful cere
monies of the Big Game rally ended
in the Pavilion, when the torch was
applied to the towering pyre of fresh
man energy and Stanford spirit. A
tiny, dancing flame at first, the square
tower of inflammatory material was
soon an orange-hued blaze of light.
Across the fields —some on foot,
others in cars —came a mad rush of
Card rooters bent on making the most
of Stanford's annual tribute to Cali
fornia sluggishness.
Dervish-like in zeal, bombastic in
action, a milling chain of roughs and
500's encircled the red-hot mass of
burning timber only to be driven back
by the unbearable heat. Round and
round circled the rallying Cards; time
after time spontaneous cheering and
Speegle-led yells echoed into nearby
shadowy darkness.
For more than an hour the thou
sands lingered to watch the gigantic
fire reach its zenith only to crash and
tumble into showers of sparks. Mid
night found only the white, glowing
embers of another Big Game bonfire.
