# EVERYBODY HAPPY, UNTIL SATURDAY(?)

### 
All is well on the campus now, until Saturday. The Goodwill As
sembly has come and gone and is but a cherished memory. The Golden
Bear was cremated in effigy over a roaring bonfire; true, a fire that was
smaller than those in past years, but one that served its purpose just as
well.
Those freshmen who worked on the Bonfire are to be commended.
They saved the reputation of the Class of 1933 by avoiding the "failure
of each and every member of the freshman class to realize the responsi
bility which rests upon them." The guarding was very efficient. The
Bonfire was saved from premature burning, as was the reputation of
several organizations concerned, not to mention any names.
The members of the Five Hundred lived up to their admittance re
quirements and came through with intelligent service providing coffee,
doughnuts, and sandwiches to those who worked.
So all is well on the campus this year, at least until the 3 o'clock
lock-out Sunday morning. Then the STANFORD SPIRIT can be care
fully folded and tucked away among the moth balls with the Executive
Committee resolutions until the next Big Game.
