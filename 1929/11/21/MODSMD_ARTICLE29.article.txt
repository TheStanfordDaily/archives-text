# SOME MORE ON A TANGLED SITUATION
## 
### 
A special Board of Athletic Control committee, with a chairman and
all the trimmings that constitute a special committee, has been organized
to investigate the scalping of Big Game tickets. Simultaneously three
statements were issued by the members of the 8.A.C., two of whom are
on the special committee.
The chairman of the Ticket Committee stated that the "students
must realize the seriousness of this business" as "scalpers are bringing
the University into bad repute in the eyes of the general public as well
as th alumni and faculty." No one disagrees with Mr. W. P. Fuller, '10,
as the situation is not only serious but critical.
Mr. R. W. Barrett's citation that the "alumni want their tickets too
badly to scalp them" seems slightly dogmatic and unfounded and is ques
tioned at least by the students. There have been reported instances where
alumni sold their Big Game tickets to their employers, for the regular
price to be sure but with the idea in mind that they might advance their
own interests. There appears to be little difference in this form of scalp
ing than that used by the students in asking cold hard money as a pre
mium. Frequently it is the alumni who offer large prices to the student
scalpers.
In the third statement Stanford Steinbeck requests that members of
the student body voice their opinions to him so that he can fully represent
the undergraduates. With the possible exception of the seniors, who will
be alumni next year, the student body is united on the proposition that it
does not want its additional ticket privileges removed for any cause.
The action to be taken by the Board of Athletic Control will depend
largely on the report of the committee. If the Ticket Committee finds
that scalping is as bad as it is said to be there are two recourses open:
provide an efficient policing system to prevent scalping, or take away the
two additional tickets.
However, another knot is found in the tangled skein as the general
manager states that the B.A.C. "has neither the time nor the inclination
to act as police." Whether the Board will support him remains to be
seen.
The ultimate action that would meet with approval of the student
body and the alumni, if the special committee reports that scalping is be
ing done on a large scale, would be the installation of a police system to
check up on the scalpers. If this is decided upon, and it should not be
improbable, the students should co-operate with the Board to keep "scalp
ing at a minimum and not condemn it for sleuthing around in affairs that
are none of its business."

scalpers.
In the third statement Stanford Steinbeck requests that members of
the student body voice their opinions to him so that he can fully represent
the undergraduates. With the possible exception of the seniors, who will
be alumni next year, the student body is united on the proposition that it
does not want its additional ticket privileges removed for any cause.
The action to be taken by the Board of Athletic Control will depend
largely on the report of the committee. If the Ticket Committee finds
that scalping is as bad as it is said to be there are two recourses open:
provide an efficient policing system to prevent scalping, or take away the
two additional tickets.
However, another knot is found in the tangled skein as the general
manager states that the B.A.C. "has neither the time nor the inclination
to act as police." Whether the Board will support him remains to be
seen.
The ultimate action that would meet with approval of the student
body and the alumni, if the special committee reports that scalping is be
ing done on a large scale, would be the installation of a police system to
check up on the scalpers. If this is decided upon, and it should not be
improbable, the students should co-operate with the Board to keep "scalp
ing at a minimum and not condemn it for sleuthing around in affairs that
are none of its business."
A special Board of Athletic Control committee, with a chairman and
all the trimmings that constitute a special committee, has been organized
to investigate the scalping of Big Game tickets. Simultaneously three
statements were issued by the members of the 8.A.C., two of whom are
on the special committee.
The chairman of the Ticket Committee stated that the "students
must realize the seriousness of this business" as "scalpers are bringing
the University into bad repute in the eyes of the general public as well
as th alumni and faculty." No one disagrees with Mr. W. P. Fuller, '10,
as the situation is not only serious but critical.
Mr. R. W. Barrett's citation that the "alumni want their tickets too
badly to scalp them" seems slightly dogmatic and unfounded and is ques
tioned at least by the students. There have been reported instances where
alumni sold their Big Game tickets to their employers, for the regular
price to be sure but with the idea in mind that they might advance their
own interests. There appears to be little difference in this form of scalp
ing than that used by the students in asking cold hard money as a pre
mium. Frequently it is the alumni who offer large prices to the student
scalpers.
