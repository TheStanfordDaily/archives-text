# IT'S THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC'S MOVE
## 
### 
The City of Palo Alto is to be complimented upon the spirit of prog
ress it has shown in beautifying the University Avenue entrance to the
town.
Much of Palo Alto is picturesque and beautiful, but in the past no
motorist, passing on the state highway, had any idea of it. The city was
judged by its main entrance —a sad and unkempt vista.
With the removal of the bus station and the street car tracks; with
the widening and repaving of University Avenue; with the installation
of modern electroliers, and with the planting of parkways along each
side, this old impression will soon change. Palo Alto will present a front
that does justice to the remainder of the town.
It seems unfortunate, however, that the Southern Pacific has not been
moved to enter into the spirit of the campaign which brought about these
changes. The ramshackle station—the same one at which Herbert Hoo
ver and the Irwin boys disembarked when they arrived here to attend
Stanford some thirty years ago—is an eye-sore, and no painting will cover
up that fact.
Considering the amount of train traffic which passes through Palo
Alto, and considering, too, the number of Palo Alto commuters who ride
on Southern Pacific trains, it seems clear that the town deserves, and
needs, a better depot. There arc many sunbaked villages of less than
half Palo Alto's size down in the San Joaquin Valley, on a branch line,
which boast of stations that look like the Grand Central Terminal com
pared to Palo Alto's Victorian structure.
For sentimental reasons alone, the railroad company should attempt
to create a better impression at Palo Alto and Stanford, home of the
Southern Pacific's builder and first president.
