"DYNAMiTE," at the New Stanford.
When two men and a girl are buried
under a million tons of coal, the Eter
nal Triangle of love takea on a new
and gripping aspect.
Such is the biggest moment of a
picture filled with big moments. By
all means do not miss "Dynamite"—
it more than lives up to its name.
To be technically and artistically
shot through with flaws, to have an
illogical plot, and an impossible end
ing, and yet to satisfy thoroughly, en
tertain, and thrill—this is Dynamite's
unique triumph.
Kay Johnson is outstanding: she
has one of the most charming voices
in the talkies, she is very, very beau
tiful, and above all she is a real act
ress. Conrade Nagel, suave, debonair,
handsome, is perfectly cast. In con
trast to Nagel's aristocratic profile,
the crude, bare-armed strength of the
miner, played by Charles Bickford, is
exceedingly effective.
Critics say that Cecil B. DeMille is
slipping, but more than one person is
going to feel that this is the best show
that he has ever seen. Splendid sound
effects, superb acting, and incredible
variety and speed make Dynamite one
picture out of dozens. —M. L. R.

"AN ARCTIC RODEO. Daniel W.
Streeter. (G. P. Putnam and Sons.
New York. 1929. Alcove Book
Shop.)
Not so long ago fifteen men made
an expedition into Arctic regions. The
group included a Montana cowboy, a
radio operator, a cabin boy, and sun
dry others necessary for an Arctic
expedition. One year after the trip
was over, some fourteen books con
cerning the trip had been written.
And finally the fifteenth member of
the party decided to write a book.
He did, and it was a very clever book.

Says Mr. Streeter, "In this Arctic Ar
cadia live the Smith Sound Eskimos,
last of the world's aborigines. They
live exclusively on a diet of blood,
blubber, and meat. Vegetables do not
exist. In their case, a balanced diet
consists of a strip of raw seal meat
followed by a strip of blubber. Yet
below the chest they never know a
moment's illness, nor above the ears,
either. Where do they get Vitamine
D? . . . . That's one of the things we
went to find out."
If you are tired of reading the aver
age explorer's story about how he
lived on a diet of moss and lichens
and lichens and moss until the rescue
ship hove in sight, then we recom
mend that you read "An Arctic
Rodeo." Mr. Streeter's party may nave
had boiled shoe for dinner every eve
ning but the reader does not hear
about it. Not that there is anything
wrong in telling about your hardships,
but it is decidedly refreshing when
one does not.
"An Arctic Rodeo" covers the field
of Northern exploration in a decidedly
clever and interesting fashion. Street
er does not tell you that at noon on a
certain day we camped at latitude
such and such and longitude so and
so. Instead he tells you a story of the
Governor's dogs or the Governor's
daughters. All of which may not be
so educational, but it is deucedly more
entertaining, and ever so much more
readable.
If one is looking for facts, they are
there too. Only, the facts are so dis
guised that one may swallow a bit
of information without even knowing
it. And thus does Streeter deal with
the entire trip. The humorous points
are played up and the disastrous
things are made light of or forgotten
altogether. Arctic exploration would
almost be a joy with such a person
around. —A. M.

the party decided to write a book.
He did, and it was a very clever book.

Says Mr. Streeter, "In this Arctic Ar
cadia live the Smith Sound Eskimos,
last of the world's aborigines. They
live exclusively on a diet of blood,
blubber, and meat. Vegetables do not
exist. In their case, a balanced diet
consists of a strip of raw seal meat
followed by a strip of blubber. Yet
below the chest they never know a
moment's illness, nor above the ears,
either. Where do they get Vitamine
D? . . . . That's one of the things we
went to find out."
If you are tired of reading the aver
age explorer's story about how he
lived on a diet of moss and lichens
and lichens and moss until the rescue
ship hove in sight, then we recom
mend that you read "An Arctic
Rodeo." Mr. Streeter's party may nave
had boiled shoe for dinner every eve
ning but the reader does not hear
about it. Not that there is anything
wrong in telling about your hardships,
but it is decidedly refreshing when
one does not.
"An Arctic Rodeo" covers the field
of Northern exploration in a decidedly
clever and interesting fashion. Street
er does not tell you that at noon on a
certain day we camped at latitude
such and such and longitude so and
so. Instead he tells you a story of the
Governor's dogs or the Governor's
daughters. All of which may not be
so educational, but it is deucedly more
entertaining, and ever so much more
readable.
If one is looking for facts, they are
there too. Only, the facts are so dis
guised that one may swallow a bit
of information without even knowing
it. And thus does Streeter deal with
the entire trip. The humorous points
are played up and the disastrous
things are made light of or forgotten
altogether. Arctic exploration would
almost be a joy with such a person
around. —A. M.
"DYNAMiTE," at the New Stanford.
When two men and a girl are buried

nal Triangle of love takea on a new
and gripping aspect.
Such is the biggest moment of a
picture filled with big moments. By
all means do not miss "Dynamite"—
it more than lives up to its name.
To be technically and artistically
shot through with flaws, to have an
illogical plot, and an impossible end
ing, and yet to satisfy thoroughly, en
tertain, and thrill—this is Dynamite's
unique triumph.
Kay Johnson is outstanding: she
has one of the most charming voices

trast to Nagel's aristocratic profile,
the crude, bare-armed strength of the
miner, played by Charles Bickford, is
exceedingly effective.
Critics say that Cecil B. DeMille is
slipping, but more than one person is
going to feel that this is the best show
that he has ever seen. Splendid sound
effects, superb acting, and incredible
variety and speed make Dynamite one
picture out of dozens. —M. L. R.
