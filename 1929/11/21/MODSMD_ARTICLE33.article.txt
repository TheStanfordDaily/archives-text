# HELVENSTON, CAMPIGLIA, FAVOR OFF-CAMPUS PRODUCTION OF STANFORD DRAMATIC WORK

"Repetition of occasional campus
performances in San Francisco would
be a fine thing for the University, in
my opinion," declared Harold Helven
ston when he was asked about the
feasibility of the idea. "It always
seems like a waste of time, manpower,
and money, to work for several weeks
on a play, give it a single perform
ance, and then forget it.
"Conditions, however, would have
to be suitable to make a San Francisco
performance worthwhile. The produc
tion should be one of small cast, with
spectacular settings which are easily
packed and moved, and good cos
tumes. The play should be one which
had not been produced in the vicinity
recently, a premiere, a revival, or a
fresh treatment of a classic being
preferable.
Practical For Roads
"While a show like the present
Gaieties would not be practical to take
on the road, on account of the large
cast and lack of spectacular sets,
many shows we have put on in the
past would have been well adapted
to such a venture. "The Wild Duck,"
"The Queen's Husband," "R.U.R.," and
"The Ivory Door" are only a few of
those that could have been takon to
the city."
Suggests "Swapping"
Helvenston expressed the belief that
if a San Francisco performance were
impossible, the next best thing would
be "swapping" with another univer
sity.
"An annual exchange with a uni
versity like California would be ex
cellent experience for the students
and would give each university an op
portunity to see what type of work is
being done in the other institution."
"The young people of today are bet
ter able to take care of themselves
than they were in my day," said Pro
fessor L. E. Bassett of the Dramatic
Council, in speaking of the administra
tion's objection to off-campus perform
ances of Stanford plays. "I can see
no more objection to taking these
plays elsewhere than there is to tak
ing debating and athletic teams off
campus. If the production were given
under the proper auspices, I think a
second performance of a suitable play
would be excellent experience for the
students, and would be a credit to the
University."

Must Be Settled
"The question of off-campus pre
servations of Stanford performances
is one that should be considered and
settled in the near future," said Pro
fessor E. E. Robinson, chairman of
the Committee on Public Exercises, to
which committee the problem will
probably be presented soon. "The con
sideration of this question should in
clude also performances other than
playsâ€”concerts, for example."
Ralph Campiglia, present dramatic
manager, expressed the belief that in
cases where conditions are practical,
it would be a fine thing for the Uni
versity to take plays off the campus
for second performances. He deplored
the waste incurred by a single per
formance of a play which requires
weeks of preparation.
