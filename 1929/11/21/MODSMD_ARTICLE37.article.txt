VERSATILE BACKS
Power and speed versus punch plus
shiftiness! That's the menu in
for the 89,000-odd spectators who will
Jostle, shove, stagger, and crawl to
their seats in the huge brindlo-brown
Stadium two days hence.
For when the Cards and Bears
line up in the first play of the
game, it will not be merely two
great defensive forward walls that
face each other. Behind the front
ranks, and eager for action, will
be two of the potentest ball-lug
ging quartets in the gridiron big
time today.
Although these boys won't be sing
ing for the rabble on Saturday, they
will show off a trick or two before
night-shades begin to fall. Versatility
is their middle name!
And though they are not scheduled
to dance before whoopee time long
hours after the referee and head
linesmen have gone home to supper,
they will most likely do the Breakaway
as it has never been done before. The
crowd might as well plan to spend
the whole afternoon trembling with
excitement, for when anyone of the
eight young gentlemen get their paws
on the pigskin he may be off to the
races.
If past performances mean any
thing, there will be thrills galore.
Among the headliners and football
actors, who have made many an
old lady as well as her hardy hus
band and hard-boiled sons faint,
with lengthy dashes down the
greensward, are: Rambling Benny,
85-yard sprint ace—ask Howard
Jones; Elusive Lee, who shakes
off ends coming down under punts
as a duck does water; Galloping
Lud, the boy who out-Cagled
Cagle at the Polo Grounds last
fall; and Slippery Phil, tougher to
bring down than Albie Booth at
his best.
And long runs are only a few of
their tricks. If the common fan be one
who dotes 011 rough stuff, he will be
more than pleased. For smashing line
plunges, the Big Game will not be
equalled during the 1929 season.
Then, too, there will be ample treats
for the air-minded, each team pos
sessing a couple of gents who toss
the spheroid with ease and accuracy.
Last year passes featured the Big
Game. History is due to repeat 011
Saturday!
So much for performances. How do
the two outfits stack up as far as
backfields are concerned? The Bear
forward wall has been universally
conceded a slight edge over the Red
shirt front line. But in the backfield it
is an entirely different matter. The
Bear hacks are good, but so are the
Card ball-toters.
Each backfield is not only made
up of real threats, but both have
an overabundance of reserve
strength. Benny Lom, the best
punter seen around these parts in
years and classed by Dink Tern
pleton as the outstanding back on
the Pacific Coast this year; Lee
Eisan, foxy and elusive signal
barker; Rusty Gill, young batter
ing ram and sophomore find who
tore the U.S.C. line to shreds; Ed
Griffiths, Stan Barr, Moose Gar
rity, and a host of other hard
charging Golden Bears are likely
to cause the Redshirts a lot of
trouble before the final gun pops.
To balance up against the Blue and
Gold threats, Pop will inject into the
fray at one time or another such
hoghide-coated ball hawks as Lud
Frentrup, high-stepping reverse ex
pert, Phil Moffatt, with undulating hip
action; Chuck Smalling, brutal pun
isher of forward walls; Herb Fleish
hacker, piledriving line backer; Har
low Rothert, triple threat artist; Bill
Simkins, who made the sons of Berke
ley groan last fall with his ball-tos
sing; Bill Clark, sub who starred in
the Trojan clash; and several other

players who are aching to get their
meat-hooks on some unfortunate
Golden Bear.
Choice? One might as well flip a
coin. Both combine power with speed.
Both have light shifty men, certain
scorers once they get out in the open
field. Both possess big guys who de
pend on their own punching ability
to break through for scores. Both
have reserve strength on a par with
the starting quarters.
Potentially, neither the Cards
nor the Bears have an edge. But
mere potentialities do not win
Big Games. It is the actual play
ing of the men that counts.
Whether or not Stanford hangs
up another victory over Nibs Price
and his fighting Bears will be
largely determined on how these
backs come through on Saturday.
