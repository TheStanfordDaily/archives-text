### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 20. (Special
to The Daily)â€” Several large groups
of Stanford University freshmen and
sophomores were today busily scan
ning groups of debarking passengers
at many San Francisco steamship
terminals and at the Ferry building
in search of Hardy L. "Boom" Drumm.
Drumm was reported by the Univer
sity men to be on the way to a foot
ball rally before the Stanford-Cali
fornia game.
Many of the students, when they
were unsuccessful in their attempts
to locate Drumm at steamship termin
als and railroad stations on both sides
of the bay, visited the prominent ho
tels of the city to inspect the regis
ters.
