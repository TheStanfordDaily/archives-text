# Statue Of Hoover Stolen From Brussels Library
## 
### 
BRUSSELS, Belgium, Nov. 20.
A bronze bust of President Hoover
was stolen from the entrance of Lou
vain Library last night and placed
undamaged at the foot of the Van
derweyer Monument nearby.
The police, who attribute the inci
dent to a bad taste joke on the part
of students, are searching for the
perpetrators.
Louvain and Brussels officials ex
pressed extreme annoyance and will
tender official apologies tomorrow.
