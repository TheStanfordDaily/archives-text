### 
Women students of Stanford are
more interested in good music than
are men students, according to the
statistics compiled by the A.S.S.U.
Concert Series management. Approxi
mately 47 per cent of tho women pur
chased season tickets for the 1928-29
Series, while only 28 per cent of the
men attended. The figures seem to
indicate about the same ratio this
year, for to date 44 per cent of the
women have bought tickets as con
trasted with 20 per cent of tho men.
However, interest among the fac
ulty seems to have lagged. Last year
36 per cent of the faculty attended the
concerts, whereas only 27 per cent
have purchased tickets this year. It is
possible that they are merely slow in
obtaining their seats; for they still

constitute 16 per cent of tho pur
chasers as against 17 per cent last
year.
For the 1928-29 Series, 1930 tickets
were sold. To date tho season tickets
sold for the 1929-30 Series total 1523.
Due principally to the interest of tho
women, students still hold CO per cent
of the season tnckets, 2 per cent over
their total last year. The general pub
lic has purchased 20 per cent of the
seats this season, and 4 per cent has
gone to employees of the University.
Stanford seems to have earned the
title of a university interested in cul
ture as well as in practicalities
through the fact that over 30 per cent
of the student body attended the
A.S.S.U. Series last year.
