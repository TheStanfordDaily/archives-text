## JORDAN'S INFLUENCE ON STUDENTS RECALLED BY DR. LOUIS C. CORNISH, GRADUATE OF '94 
### BV FEG MURRAY 
"To a degree nerhaps impossible ex
cept at the beginning of a university's
life, Dr. Jordan dominated our whole
thonerht and habit of mind in Stan
ford's earlv days. He was a familiar
figure walking across the Quadrangle
often learlinnr a morUey bv the chain.
No student of that time will ever for
get his lectures, talks, and dominant
influence in the ouest, for stark real
ism in the definition of truth.'' So
spoke Dr. Louis C. Cornish, Stanford
'94, president of the Association of
Unitarian Churches, in an interview
yesterday.
In the course of the conversation,
Dr. Cornish noted many differences
in student life between the present
and the past. The campus then con
sisted only of the central quadrangle
and a row of temporary buiidings. Out
toward Encina and at the rear
stretched a row of sheds divided into
sleeping quarters for the grooms when
this part of the estate was used by
the stock farm. These quarters were
rented for about ten dollars a year to
students who cared to occupy them.

J Those who did not care to live two
in a room at Encina lived in Palo
; Alto, which had onlv a few scattered
houses and windmills. Transnortation
! to the University was in three or four
soaters which came along the road
from Paulson's stable every morning.
The driver yelled when he anoroafhed
j the house and the students climbed
i in.
I Dr. Cornish believes that the pres-
I ent camnus costume is the most sensi
ble that any student ever devised. Tn
his estimation, corduroy trousers and
'a sweater are to be preferred to the
"store clothes" and stiff collars which
the men wore when he attended the
University.
After January 1894 Dr. Cornish was
a student assistant to Professor
Griggs. Eleven years later he reined
as college preacher.

Almon E. Roth, comptroller of the
University, will represent Stanford on
the local board working for the gov
ernment selection of the Sunnyvale
site as the western dirigible base.

Dr. Cornish noted many differences
in student life between the present
and the past. The campus then con
sisted only of the central quadrangle
and a row of temporary buiidings. Out
toward Encina and at the rear
stretched a row of sheds divided into
sleeping quarters for the grooms when
this part of the estate was used by
the stock farm. These quarters were
rented for about ten dollars a year to
students who cared to occupy them.

J Those who did not care to live two
in a room at Encina lived in Palo
; Alto, which had onlv a few scattered
houses and windmills. Transnortation
! to the University was in three or four
soaters which came along the road
from Paulson's stable every morning.

his estimation, corduroy trousers and
'a sweater are to be preferred to the
"store clothes" and stiff collars which
the men wore when he attended the
University.
After January 1894 Dr. Cornish was
a student assistant to Professor
Griggs. Eleven years later he reined
as college preacher.

"To a degree nerhaps impossible ex
cept at the beginning of a university's
life, Dr. Jordan dominated our whole
thonerht and habit of mind in Stan
ford's earlv days. He was a familiar
figure walking across the Quadrangle
often learlinnr a morUey bv the chain.
No student of that time will ever for
get his lectures, talks, and dominant
influence in the ouest, for stark real
ism in the definition of truth.'' So
spoke Dr. Louis C. Cornish, Stanford
'94, president of the Association of
Unitarian Churches, in an interview
yesterday.
