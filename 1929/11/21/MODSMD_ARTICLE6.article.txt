# Isolation Ward Inmates Need Radio For Saturday
## 
### 
In order that the seven Stanford
students who are confined in the Stan
ford Isolation hospital may hear the
Big Game over the radio even if they
are not able to see it, requests have
been made that some one on the cam
pus loan his set to the Ward for
Saturday afternoon. Any student so
inclined is asked to get in touch with
the manager of the Isolation Ward.
