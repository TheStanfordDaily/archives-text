# NEW BALLET CREATED FOR '29 GAIETIES
## "Rehearsal of Marionettes" To Feature Ramâ€™s Head Show Tomorrow 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
Following up last year's novel,
"Ballet Mechanique" of the Big Game
Gaieties, a completely original piece
of choreography will be seen tomor
row night in Harold Helvenston's spe
cial act, "The Rehearsal of the
Marionettes."
Real people become absolutely de
void of human personality in this act,
which has been approached from more
of a humorous angle than was the one
given last year. Hung from above the
stage on strings, a ballet of ten pup
pets, with wooden hands, loose joints,
and marionette expressions, will be
the feature of Helvenston's specialty.
The complete absence of human ex
pression and gesture in this chorus
will make the ballet one of charming
originality.
Burlesque Shakespeare
Preceding the rehearsal of the
marionette chorus, there will be a
comic prelude which vaguely smacks
of Shakespeare. Tremendously comic
expressions have been achieved for
the characters in the prelude through
the medium of masks which Helven
ston has made, and his treatment of
the hands of two of the characters
shows a perfectly humorous apprecia
tion of puppetry.
Special music, which is as original
and suitable as was Jack Meakin's
music for last year's ballet, has been
written for "The Rehearsal of the
Marionettes" by Grif Williams, who
is also responsible for several of the
songs to be featured in the Gaieties.
Large Cast
Parts in the comic prelude will be
taken by Huntly Haight, Dan Bedford,
George Andreini, Paul Speegle, Annie
Lou Carmichael, Cary Odell, Tom
Henry, and Burnell Gould. The wo
men's chorus of "ballerinas" will con
sist of Jean Long, Marjorie Robinson,
Sandy Lieb, Katherine Keho, Betty
Clarke, Francese Abbott, Constance
McCleave, Ruth Helvenston, Barbara
Bailey, and Mary Edna Wittenberg.
