TRIPLE-TIIRFAT
IJFAR
Rambling IJenny
Lorn, Cal., and last
year's all-coast half,
who is expected to
break away for a few
lengthy dashes down
the greensward to
morrow. A natural
triple - threat artist,
IJenny is quoted on
the Hear market as
the outstanding back
on the Pacific Coast
today. Besides toting
the pigskin, Mr. Lom
is one of the best
punters in captivity.
11 is spirals frequent
ly soar down the
field for fifty yards
or more, and so ac
curate that they land
within the radius of
a gnat's eyebrow. The
majority of Califor
nia's scores this sea
son were the result of
bullet passes by this
potent Golden Hear.
He got oft for an 85-
yard run to a touch
down against the
Trojans three weeks
ago.
