CHANG
Corvvin Artnian, whose picture
appears above, is a promising
youth of some 245 pounds. He
plays tackle on ''Pop" W arner's
varsity, and opposing forwards
find "Chang's" bulk no mean
weight to lift aside. Artman cov
ered his brow with wreaths of
glory against the Cadets from
West Point last winter. But the
weighty Cardinal is due to run
into rough weather when he hits
that fighting Hear forward wall,
if reports from the Trojan camp
are to he credited.
