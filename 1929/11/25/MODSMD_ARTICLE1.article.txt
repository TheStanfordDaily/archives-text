on the accident: "Goodspeed, an excel
lent player mounted on a quiet, well
trained pony, came to his death as a
result of internal injuries sustained
when his pony fell. The exact cause of
the fall is unknown, but there was
no player or horse near enough to
have in any way been a contributing
factor."
The accident was the first serious
one in the nine years of polo instruc
tion at Stanford.
