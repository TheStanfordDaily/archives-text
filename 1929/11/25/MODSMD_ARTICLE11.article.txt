# Campus Artistry In Music, Humor Seen At Gaieties
## 
### The Staff Reviewer 
With professional deftness, with a
great variety in music and sketches,
and a gently satirical, if a little ob
scure, tone to the humor, the 1929 Big
Game Gaieties rolled smoothly on its
way to provide an evening of thor
ougs enjoyment on the eve of the
Berkeley invasion.
Few football shows have been so
wide in scope. It is a far step from
the Rio Rita atmosphere of "Arizona"
and the whip-crack ng William Tell
episode to the sheer artistic beauty in
design and color of the Marionette
Ballet. It was a real revue, with a
sense of unity and finesse, held to
gether by George Mauser, and it main
tained a surprisingly high and even
level of entertainment. The costumes
and sets were exceptional especially
in the "Sliding" and "Arizona" acts.
Musically and artistically the show
reached great heights. There were fif
teen campus compositions, including
a new Stanford song, "Flaming Red,"
by Griff Williams and Burnell Gould
which has a distinctive farch-rhytlim
and stirring words. Williams, Star
bird, and Spaulding were responsible
for most o fthe music while Jack
Ross, Fred Ducato, Bob Thornton, and
the Beta Trio contributed original
pieces. Outstanding were "Arizona,"
the "Gal with the Cauliflower Ear,"
"No News, Bad News," and "Take
Back Your Smiles" which had the
loveliest melody in the show.
Puppet Artistry Best
The artistic height of the Gaieties
was Helvenston's "Rehearsal of the
Marionettes" to the composition of
modern music by Williams. In train
ing this act Helvenston caught per
fectly the gesture oi the marionette,
head to toe. Helvenston's creative
power and his ability to train college
j students were revealed. He completely
obscured the personalities of the stu
dents, Pyramus and Thisbe were pure
ly humorous; the incidental move
ments of the stage hands heightened
the marionette effect, as well as the
masks, wigs, and hands. The ballet
was sheer beauty and loveliness, and
its finish and delicacy was quite a
treat to a campus audience.
| The best skit in the snow was "Bits
i from Hits" by Gould and Speegle. The
! impersonations were cleverly con
i ceived and well executed. It will be a
long time before anyone can forget
Speegle as "Sonny Boy" or Gould as
"Jimmy Savo" and the "mint's spy."
I The radio act beginning was enticing
j and the audience would have enjoyed
j another. Carolyn Hall shone in her
j small bit and Speegle struck home as
| Jack Benny.
Joe Thompson, assisted by Babbie,
scored one of the hits of the show
with his "Beez Neez." Here is a new
college comedian whose antics as a j
"bee pioneer" kept the audience in
constant laughter. Sharing laughing I
honors with these two skits was Mar- j
! shall Kirby's act. It was pricelessly
j funny, very subtle, and revealed a j
| master's touch in the AEIOU chorus, j
j Kirby is a real comedian and his ac- i
cessories served to heighten the comic
effect.
Keho in New Role
"Stop the Presses," by Gould and J
Peck, was a delightful satire on the !
press men of the Bay district, but it \
necessitated a knowledge of their j
characteristics the general run of stu- !
dents do not have. To those who un-;
derstood its inferences, it was price- ;
less. The parts were well taken.
The other skits were uneven. The J
Moover-McAwful sketch was funny, i
only because of the characters, and j
the "Iron Gate" served to reveal Miss !
Keho in an entirely new role, but the
possibilities of satirizing Milne were
missed. Phil Brooks' characterization

was excellent but too long. The air
plane skit was fairly effective.
"Conglomerania" was the outstand
ing revue act. It served to introduce
a campus singer who reveals great
promise, Jean Jamison, and her low
crooning voice fits her admirably to
take the place in campus shows re
cently left vacant by Kathleen Fitz.
The choruse in this act was excellent,
while in the opening act, although an
original idea, the chorus lacked snap
and pep. "Arizona" was quite ambi
tious and Helen Ward's animated
singing was the best she has ever
done. Catherine Morse, Emeline No
lan, had nice voices but no person
ality in their singing. Jack Miller and
the Beta Trio were pleasing.
