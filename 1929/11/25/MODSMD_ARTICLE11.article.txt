# Campus Artistry In Music, Humor Seen At Gaieties
## 
### The Staff Reviewer 
With professional deftness, with a
great variety in music and sketches,
and a gently satirical, if a little ob
scure, tone to the humor, the 1929 Big
Game Gaieties rolled smoothly on its
way to provide an evening of thor

the Rio Rita atmosphere of "Arizona"
and the whip-crack ng William Tell
episode to the sheer artistic beauty in
design and color of the Marionette
Ballet. It was a real revue, with a
sense of unity and finesse, held to

tained a surprisingly high and even
level of entertainment. The costumes
and sets were exceptional especially
in the "Sliding" and "Arizona" acts.
Musically and artistically the show
reached great heights. There were fif
teen campus compositions, including
a new Stanford song, "Flaming Red,"
by Griff Williams and Burnell Gould
which has a distinctive farch-rhytlim
and stirring words. Williams, Star
bird, and Spaulding were responsible
for most o fthe music while Jack
Ross, Fred Ducato, Bob Thornton, and
the Beta Trio contributed original
pieces. Outstanding were "Arizona,"
the "Gal with the Cauliflower Ear,"
"No News, Bad News," and "Take
Back Your Smiles" which had the
loveliest melody in the show.
