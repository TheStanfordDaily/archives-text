line and made good a difficult kick
from the corner.
Stanford evened things up a few
moments later when Bud O'Donnell
took a pass from Toepke and buoted
perfectly into the net. It was a shot
that no goalie could have stopped.
During the remainder of the first half,
the Cards threatened to add to the
score but were unsuccessful. The
period ended one all.
J. Smart put the Bears in the lead
again early in the second half by
working single-handed through the
opposing defense to kick into the net
from short center. A goal by K.
Smart, Cal center forward, shortly af
ter, put the Zamloch-coached eleven
well out in front with a lead that the
Redshirts could not overcome. The
final score was made on a short pass
combination of the two Smart brothers
in the last few seconds of play.
