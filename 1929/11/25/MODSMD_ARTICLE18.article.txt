# STANFORD PROVES COLOR OF LIFE IS RED IN BIG GAME

Stanford saw red Saturday.
From the first entrance of the Big
Game bands till the last echo of the
California hymn floated over the roll

desires, united for the moment in real
good-will and the expectation of a
great battle. The stage was set for
the Big Game.
