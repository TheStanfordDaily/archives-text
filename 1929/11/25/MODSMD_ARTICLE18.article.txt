# STANFORD PROVES COLOR OF LIFE IS RED IN BIG GAME
## 
### Sylva Weaver 
Stanford saw red Saturday.
From the first entrance of the Big
Game bands till the last echo of the
California hymn floated over the roll
ing foothills into the gray dusk, forty
five thousand Cardinals witnessed the
rise of a Stanford Red beginning with
a frenzied spirit of fighting mad and
culminating in a premature celebration
of the death of the Golden Bear —the
"Poor Cal" dirge. It was a Red that
proved invincible, and Stanford spirit
rose to unexpected heights.
Stanford was proud of her team,
her rooting section, and her band.
Never before has the Stanford band
shown off to better advantage than its
entrance on the field. The Califor
nians in their military blue and gold
capes were an inspiring sight to 45,000
Bear enthusiasts, but the fighting
spirit of Stanford was mirrored in its
band's brisk march. There was a
psychology in the choice of songs,
"We're going to bury you, California,"
"On Men of Stanford," and "Come
Join the Band." Forty-five thousand
joined that Band and gave great
cheers for Stanford Red.
New strength and new enthusiasm
—a new Stanford team came running
on the field —and Stanford saw more
red than ever. The band spelled out
"Stanford," and then the onrush of
the Golden Bears was in reality an
invasion of Cardinal ground.
It was an excited crowd that sud
denly became silent and impressed
when the strains of the national an
them, played by the two bands, filled
the air. It was a crowd, torn by two
desires, united for the moment in real
good-will and the expectation of a
great battle. The stage was set for
the Big Game.
Stanford significantly enough start
ed the game with "Give 'em the Axe,"
and the rooting section so ably led
by Speegle and managed so well by
the white-outfitted Rally Committee
was a seething, howling mas sof stu
dents who were quite as much on
edge as the team. When Stanford
j made three first downs in a row and
I a touchdown in the first five minutes
jit was almost too good to be true to
i the students who have been watching
[ the team's ragged playing of other
I games.
Loyalty was California's middle
name Saturday, and in spite of disap
pointment heaped on disappointment,
there was an undying spirit backing
the team. Came the half with its at
tendant rivalry. Stanford's rooting
stunts featured a tribute to Pop War
ner and Captain Mush Muller. Cali
fornia's stunts showed Nibs Price, a
Card rooter "before and after," and a
series of steps to the 1929 title, a
trifle premature, indeed.
Bears' Hopes Vanish
The second half found the California
rooting section giving a dejected ap
pearance. As spots of black cluttered
up the symmetry of the gold C on
blue, the spotted and cloudy impres
sion symbolized the fate and fortunes
of California —getting blacker and
blacker as the minutes went by. The
outburst of Big Game spirit which re
sulted in one player's disqualification
only spurred the flaming red on to
new conquests.
The sun was sinking in the west as
Stanford got her third touchdown and
California could say nothing when the
Riegelian influence broke out in the
team. With two minutes to go a spon
taneous demonstration of the Cardinal
victory broke out in the doleful cry
of "Poor Cal, Poor Cal," and the
rooters Bwayed in rhythm to this fun
eral chant for a Berkeley Bear which
has been trying to climb the Palo Alto
tree since 1924.
Darkness was settling as the final
shot came, and Stanford poured over
the field to take its measure of vic
tory. The Stanford hymn rang out in
triumph, in defiance of all predictions,
through the misty air.
There was a touch of sadness in
the California hymn—a sadness re
sulting from the loss of a golden blue
dream of western supremacy and of
defeating Stanford.
California's thousands left the field,
bloody but unbowed, thinking of next
year—while Stanford's happy throngs
joined the Band in "Hail, hail, the
gang's all here," and disappeared for
further celebrations.
Stanford saw red gloriously Satur
day—and California saw a little too
much of it.

Loyalty was California's middle
name Saturday, and in spite of disap
pointment heaped on disappointment,
there was an undying spirit backing
the team. Came the half with its at
tendant rivalry. Stanford's rooting
stunts featured a tribute to Pop War
ner and Captain Mush Muller. Cali
fornia's stunts showed Nibs Price, a
Card rooter "before and after," and a
series of steps to the 1929 title, a
trifle premature, indeed.
Bears' Hopes Vanish
The second half found the California
rooting section giving a dejected ap
pearance. As spots of black cluttered
up the symmetry of the gold C on
blue, the spotted and cloudy impres
sion symbolized the fate and fortunes
of California —getting blacker and
blacker as the minutes went by. The
outburst of Big Game spirit which re
sulted in one player's disqualification
only spurred the flaming red on to
new conquests.
The sun was sinking in the west as
Stanford got her third touchdown and
California could say nothing when the
Riegelian influence broke out in the
team. With two minutes to go a spon
taneous demonstration of the Cardinal
victory broke out in the doleful cry
of "Poor Cal, Poor Cal," and the
rooters Bwayed in rhythm to this fun
eral chant for a Berkeley Bear which
has been trying to climb the Palo Alto
tree since 1924.
Darkness was settling as the final
shot came, and Stanford poured over
the field to take its measure of vic
tory. The Stanford hymn rang out in
triumph, in defiance of all predictions,
through the misty air.
There was a touch of sadness in
the California hymn—a sadness re
sulting from the loss of a golden blue
dream of western supremacy and of
defeating Stanford.
California's thousands left the field,
bloody but unbowed, thinking of next
year—while Stanford's happy throngs
joined the Band in "Hail, hail, the
gang's all here," and disappeared for
further celebrations.
Stanford saw red gloriously Satur
day—and California saw a little too
much of it.
Stanford saw red Saturday.
From the first entrance of the Big
Game bands till the last echo of the
California hymn floated over the roll
ing foothills into the gray dusk, forty
five thousand Cardinals witnessed the
rise of a Stanford Red beginning with
a frenzied spirit of fighting mad and
culminating in a premature celebration
of the death of the Golden Bear —the
"Poor Cal" dirge. It was a Red that
proved invincible, and Stanford spirit
rose to unexpected heights.
Stanford was proud of her team,
her rooting section, and her band.
Never before has the Stanford band
shown off to better advantage than its
entrance on the field. The Califor
nians in their military blue and gold
capes were an inspiring sight to 45,000
Bear enthusiasts, but the fighting
spirit of Stanford was mirrored in its
band's brisk march. There was a
psychology in the choice of songs,
"We're going to bury you, California,"
"On Men of Stanford," and "Come
Join the Band." Forty-five thousand
joined that Band and gave great
cheers for Stanford Red.
New strength and new enthusiasm
—a new Stanford team came running
on the field —and Stanford saw more
red than ever. The band spelled out
"Stanford," and then the onrush of
the Golden Bears was in reality an
invasion of Cardinal ground.
It was an excited crowd that sud
denly became silent and impressed
when the strains of the national an
them, played by the two bands, filled
the air. It was a crowd, torn by two
desires, united for the moment in real
good-will and the expectation of a
great battle. The stage was set for
the Big Game.
Stanford significantly enough start
ed the game with "Give 'em the Axe,"
and the rooting section so ably led
by Speegle and managed so well by
the white-outfitted Rally Committee

much of it.
Stanford saw red Saturday.
From the first entrance of the Big
Game bands till the last echo of the
California hymn floated over the roll
ing foothills into the gray dusk, forty
five thousand Cardinals witnessed the
rise of a Stanford Red beginning with
a frenzied spirit of fighting mad and
culminating in a premature celebration
of the death of the Golden Bear —the
"Poor Cal" dirge. It was a Red that
proved invincible, and Stanford spirit
rose to unexpected heights.
Stanford was proud of her team,
her rooting section, and her band.
Never before has the Stanford band
shown off to better advantage than its
entrance on the field. The Califor
nians in their military blue and gold
capes were an inspiring sight to 45,000
Bear enthusiasts, but the fighting
spirit of Stanford was mirrored in its
band's brisk march. There was a
psychology in the choice of songs,
"We're going to bury you, California,"
"On Men of Stanford," and "Come
Join the Band." Forty-five thousand
joined that Band and gave great
cheers for Stanford Red.
New strength and new enthusiasm
—a new Stanford team came running
on the field —and Stanford saw more
red than ever. The band spelled out
"Stanford," and then the onrush of
the Golden Bears was in reality an
invasion of Cardinal ground.
It was an excited crowd that sud
denly became silent and impressed
when the strains of the national an
them, played by the two bands, filled
the air. It was a crowd, torn by two
desires, united for the moment in real
good-will and the expectation of a
great battle. The stage was set for
the Big Game.
Stanford significantly enough start
ed the game with "Give 'em the Axe,"
and the rooting section so ably led
by Speegle and managed so well by
the white-outfitted Rally Committee
was a seething, howling mas sof stu
dents who were quite as much on
edge as the team. When Stanford
j made three first downs in a row and
I a touchdown in the first five minutes
jit was almost too good to be true to
i the students who have been watching
[ the team's ragged playing of other
I games.
Loyalty was California's middle
name Saturday, and in spite of disap
pointment heaped on disappointment,
there was an undying spirit backing
the team. Came the half with its at
tendant rivalry. Stanford's rooting
stunts featured a tribute to Pop War
ner and Captain Mush Muller. Cali
fornia's stunts showed Nibs Price, a
Card rooter "before and after," and a
series of steps to the 1929 title, a
trifle premature, indeed.
Bears' Hopes Vanish
The second half found the California
rooting section giving a dejected ap
pearance. As spots of black cluttered
up the symmetry of the gold C on
blue, the spotted and cloudy impres
sion symbolized the fate and fortunes
of California —getting blacker and
blacker as the minutes went by. The
outburst of Big Game spirit which re
sulted in one player's disqualification
only spurred the flaming red on to
new conquests.
The sun was sinking in the west as
Stanford got her third touchdown and
California could say nothing when the
Riegelian influence broke out in the
team. With two minutes to go a spon
taneous demonstration of the Cardinal
victory broke out in the doleful cry
of "Poor Cal, Poor Cal," and the
rooters Bwayed in rhythm to this fun
eral chant for a Berkeley Bear which
has been trying to climb the Palo Alto
tree since 1924.
Darkness was settling as the final
shot came, and Stanford poured over
the field to take its measure of vic
tory. The Stanford hymn rang out in
triumph, in defiance of all predictions,
through the misty air.
There was a touch of sadness in
the California hymn—a sadness re
sulting from the loss of a golden blue
dream of western supremacy and of
defeating Stanford.
California's thousands left the field,
bloody but unbowed, thinking of next
year—while Stanford's happy throngs
joined the Band in "Hail, hail, the
gang's all here," and disappeared for
further celebrations.
