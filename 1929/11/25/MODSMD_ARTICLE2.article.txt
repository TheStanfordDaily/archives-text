# "COCK ROBIN" TO BE SHOWN ON COAST FOR FIRST TIME BY SOPHS
## 
### 
When they put on "Cock Robin," a
three-act mystery comedy by Elmer
Rice and Phillip Barry, a week from
this Friday night, the Class of '32
will be giving this play its first per
formance on the Pacific Coast. It had
a long run on Broadway last season
and was greeted there as one of the
finest plays of its kind which played
in New York last year.
Both Rice and Barry are play
wrights who had plays included in
the latest Burns-Mantle collection of
"Best Plays." The former's "Adding
Machine," an expressionalistic satire,
is probably his best-known work. It
was given this summer under the di
rection of Gordon Davis with Burnell
Gould in the leading role. Rice was co
author with Dorothy Parker of "Sub
way," another expressionistic play;
and his "Street Scene," a realistic
drama of New York boarding house
life, was the one chosen for last
year's collection of ten best plays.
"See Nables and Die" is the title of
Rice's latest play, now on Broadway.
Philip Barry, whose charming style
is very different from his collabor
ator's, is known chiefly for his "Holi
day," a high, sophisticated comedy
which was printed last year in the
Burns-Mantle collection. He wrote this
play for Hope Williams, who had
starred in his previous comedy, "Paris
Bound." Among Phillip's other plays
are "You and I," which took the Har
vard prize several years ago, and has
been put on here, and"The Youngest,"
"In a Garden," and "White Wings."
