### STEPHEN DIETRICH 
niSPLAYING more vim, vigor, and vitality than they have during all the
U rest of thcT 1929 gridiron season put together, Coach Pop Warner's big
Cardinal varsity brought its conference year to close in a blaze of glory on
Saturday last with a 21 to G win over the highly touted Golden Bears froui
California in their 35th annual Big Game.
T he score in no way indicates the real difference between the two teams.
Heralded as a cinch to wallop the Cards, Nibs Price's boys were outclassed
in every department of the game. Statistics show that Stanford outplayed,
outgained, outfought, outpunted, outpassed, outran, and outfoxed California

> for at least fifty-five of the sixty hec
tic minutes of play.
The victory was in no way a fluke.
All of Stanford's scores resulted from
power drives down the field, ranging
from a forty-yard march in the first
five minutes of play to a seventy-yard
jaunt down the greensward In the
fourth quarter.
Bears Get Breaks
If anything, flukes favored the
Bears and helped to keep down their
margin of defeat. For the Cards even
outfumbled the Blue and Gold lads,
while the officials even went so far
as to see that the latter were far out
penalized. The way Stanford was
going Saturday the U.C. rooters can
only kiss their lucky stars that their
team tallied at all and that cardinal
colored pantaloons didn't flash across
their goal line on two or three added
occasions.
However, the some four score and
nine thousand mortals who trembled
with excitement during the thrilling
clash will all agree that the Bear was
no taxidermist's specimen. Quite to
the contrary, Mr. Bruna U. C. was
very bearish in his manners, rough,
tough, and full of scrap. Yet, the Red
shirts' playing seemed to befuddle
him clear out of his skin and the sud
denness of the Cards' first touchdown
completely demoralized him.
By the time the final gun went
bang, the Bear was a well-6tuffed
creature, in perfect shape to adorn
the antique sanctitudes of any first
class museum!
Will Be Remembered
As for the game itself, reams and
reams of blurb, tripe, and vivid epics
(more than is printed about the aver
age international conflict) have al
ready been written and long since di
gested by the reading rabble. But al
though the struggle is already history,
a few of the major highlights will
linger on in the memories of Blue
and Gold studes and Sons of the Stan
ford Red for days and days to come.
Almost all of the action, thrills, and
exchange of lusty blows took place in
Cal territory, a goodly portion of it
within the very shadow of the Bear
goal posts. Soon after the opening
kickoff, Captain Mush Muller, who
played a whale of a game at end for
Stanford, pounced on a fumbled ball
bouncing out of Rusty Gill's mitts on
the Bears' forty-yard line. After ex
actly eleven plays thereafter, the fans,
officials, and U.C. players were equal
ly surprised to discover the pigskin
Testing over the goal line in the arms
of one Lud Frentrup.
The bear came right back and near
ly tied the knot, when he caught the
Farm laus napping for the first and
last time of the afternoon. Mr. Frent
rup juggled the ball on his own thirty
two yard line and before he could
scoop it up again, Bert Schwarz re
covered for California. From there the
Bears made a first down and advanced
to the 15-yard line in quick fashion.
On the fourth down with four to go,
Benny Lom took a pass from center,
walked back about five yards, tore off
a few minutes' sleep, counted the num
ber of spectators in the bleachers, and
suddenly upped and tossed a bullet
pass to Bob Thornton over the goal
for six points.
Cards Asleep
The whole Stanford squad was
caught flat-footed. No one rushed Mr.
Lom, and ho had all the time in the
world to flip a perfect pass. Mush
Muller robbed Cal out of their extra
point, though, when he dashed in to
block the try for goal.
From then on to the end of the
game, it was all Stanford. The Bears'
strong defense wilted before the hard
charging Card forward wall, and the
Redshirt backfield aces romped up
and down the turf almost at will. At
the same time, Stanford's weak pass
defense failed to materialize. The Red
shirts always happened to be on the
spot where Lom and the other Bear
ball-tossers had planned to flip their
passes, and had a great time batting
the spheriod out of some would-be
receiver's paws or intercepting the
ball when they felt so inclined.
Besides passing better than they
have all season, the Cards worked
their running plays to perfection. In
terference clicked as it should most
of the time, and when a Cal man was
hit he was generally bowled out of
the way. Only once or twice did the
red-panted backs tumble over their
fellow players.
Nibs' coaching bag was not entire
ly devoid of tricks, and he pulled off
one play that came close to out-Rey
narding the Old Fox. Lee Eisan, elu
sive safety man and outstanding play
er for Cal, snagged a punt and started
trotting for the Card goal, but just as
he was tackled, whirled around and
threw a lateral to Lom, who nearly
got away to the races.
Captain Muller Stars
Besides Mr. Eisan, Captain Riegels,
Bob Thornton, Joe Pitto, and Ted
Beckett all played good ball for t'ae
Blue and Gold. But when it comes to
choosing the best Card players, it is
an entirely different matter, as every
one of the Redshirts played a bang-up
game. Captain Muller played the best
game of his career, in defensive play,
blocking kicks, snagging passes, and
In fighting leadership. Walt Heinecke
clearly outplayed Riegels at center,
and once again proved that he is the
best center on the Coast. In fact, all
of the line stood out â€”Neill and Pres
ton, ends, Tandy and Thompson,
tackles, Driscoll, Wilson, and Bardin,
guards, being especially outstanding.
For backfield work, high honors
must be handed to Chuck Smalling,
who smashed the Bear line time after
time, made more than his share of
vicious tackles, and slapped down
pass after pass. Herb Fleishhacker
showed up on defense, while Phil
Moffatt and Lud Frentrup starred
with their open field running. Harlow
Rothert easily outpunted Lom, while
Bill Clark, Guldo Caglieri, and Harry
Hillman all looked good.
