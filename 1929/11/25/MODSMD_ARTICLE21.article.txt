### STEPHEN DIETRICH 
niSPLAYING more vim, vigor, and vitality than they have during all the
U rest of thcT 1929 gridiron season put together, Coach Pop Warner's big
Cardinal varsity brought its conference year to close in a blaze of glory on
Saturday last with a 21 to G win over the highly touted Golden Bears froui
California in their 35th annual Big Game.
T he score in no way indicates the real difference between the two teams.
Heralded as a cinch to wallop the Cards, Nibs Price's boys were outclassed
in every department of the game. Statistics show that Stanford outplayed,
outgained, outfought, outpunted, outpassed, outran, and outfoxed California

> for at least fifty-five of the sixty hec
tic minutes of play.
The victory was in no way a fluke.
All of Stanford's scores resulted from
power drives down the field, ranging
from a forty-yard march in the first
five minutes of play to a seventy-yard
jaunt down the greensward In the
fourth quarter.
Bears Get Breaks
If anything, flukes favored the
Bears and helped to keep down their
margin of defeat. For the Cards even
outfumbled the Blue and Gold lads,
while the officials even went so far
as to see that the latter were far out
penalized. The way Stanford was
going Saturday the U.C. rooters can
only kiss their lucky stars that their
team tallied at all and that cardinal
colored pantaloons didn't flash across
their goal line on two or three added
occasions.
However, the some four score and
nine thousand mortals who trembled
with excitement during the thrilling
clash will all agree that the Bear was
no taxidermist's specimen. Quite to
the contrary, Mr. Bruna U. C. was
very bearish in his manners, rough,
tough, and full of scrap. Yet, the Red
shirts' playing seemed to befuddle
him clear out of his skin and the sud
denness of the Cards' first touchdown
completely demoralized him.
By the time the final gun went
bang, the Bear was a well-6tuffed
creature, in perfect shape to adorn
the antique sanctitudes of any first
class museum!
Will Be Remembered
As for the game itself, reams and
reams of blurb, tripe, and vivid epics
(more than is printed about the aver
age international conflict) have al
ready been written and long since di
gested by the reading rabble. But al
though the struggle is already history,
