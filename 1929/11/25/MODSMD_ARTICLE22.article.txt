# December 2 Copy Deadline For Chappie Xmas Number
## 
### 
"What a game! What a spectacle!"
cackled the Old Boy as he slowly
poured cold water over his venerable
gray head last night, "but now that
it's almost all over, I'll have to start
work on my December issue of the
Chaparral. All copy, art and literary,
must be in by December 2 or it just
won't get in."
The December issue, announces the
Ancient Wheezer, is to be a combined
Christmas and Football Number, and
jokes about the army game and the
holidays will be greatefully received.
