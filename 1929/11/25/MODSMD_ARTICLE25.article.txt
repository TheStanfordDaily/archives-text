# THE SPIRITUAL POWER
## 
### 
Stanford defeated California.
Consider the wealth of meaning in that sentence.
It means that this talk about spirit is not hokum.
The Varsity rose to magnificent heights Saturday when it made Cali
fornia feel the bitterness of defeat for the first time in two years. And
spirit had no small part in that glorious victory. Sincerity of student
support was demonstrated in the Santa Clara game and in the subsequent
rallies. The team caught the spirit and translated it into honest-to-good
ness fight!
The victory means that no one in the present college generation has
seen Stanford defeated by California, but has seen two tie games and
three Stanford victories in five years.
It means that Pop Warner is still daddy of them all and that every
man on the team played a whale of a game for their coach and for their
University.
It means that the combined efforts of student body officers, press, and
students can accomplish almost anything that the students want, even
win football games.
It means that the coach, team, students, and everyone else connected
with the University can feel proud of a good job well done.
It means that we can all settle down to the essential purpose of
college life with a tranquil mind.
