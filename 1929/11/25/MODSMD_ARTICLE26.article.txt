# A GREAT FRENCHMAN PASSES
## 
### 
Georges Clemenceau, France's "Father of Victory," died Sunday
night honored by the French nation as the man who stemmed the tide, the
statesman who would rather burn Paris than allow the Germans to enter
his beloved capital.
They called him the "Tiger." His energy and will were called "re
lentless" and "remorseless." He never faltered when fighting evil or
destroying men or political combinations that incurred his wrath. The
story of his life is the story of a giant.
Throughout his career, Clemenceau made mistakes, many of them â€”
some of them unquestionably great mistakes. But Clemeanceau never
met a man, whether friend or foe, who could with truth say to him that
he had ever failed to do his best for the greatness, the glory, the dignity
of France.
And that is why the death of France's "Tiger" causes the world to
heave a sigh. Not merely because one of the greatest Frenchmen of all
times is dead, but also because into the portals of death has passed a man
who loved and served his country at all times and ever with the utmost
energy of his convictions.
