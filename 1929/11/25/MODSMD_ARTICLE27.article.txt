# THAT BURIED STANFORD AX

A contributor to the "Safety Valve" column of the San Francisco
Chroniclc visualizes "the pandemonium that would break loose from the
stands" and the spirit that would seize the two teams if California and
Stanford were to do battle for the Stanford ax, and says "then there
would be something to that cheer, 'Give 'em the ax!' "
On this timely topic, "Stanford '24," says:
"Now that the "big game" is here, what about the Stanford ax? Why must
the traditional trophy be hidden in the vault of a bank? Every year we hear vague
rumors al>out the ax, but all the students and public know about it is that it was
stolen from Stanford back in 1892 by California. Many do not know that California
had t« hide it under the skirts of a woman to get it to Berkeley, where it was
securcly locked in a bank—to stay there continually except for a few brief moments
at the "big game" rally in Berkeley—and then back into the bank. Surely, one
cannot help but doubt the sportsmanship of California in this matter and certainly
California cannot be proud of the method used in stealing the ax.
"What a trophy it would be for the two teams to battle for in the 'big game!'
Let the winner keep it until beaten . .
Californians, quite naturally, will be amused by the suggestion that
they give up the Stanford ax, after having guarded it so closely all these
37 years. But, nevertheless, the idea put forward by the Stanford "grad"
has its merits.
Much of the splendid spirit that has made the "big game" between
Stanford and California the grid epic of the West, has been because the
Stanford ax has been buried, both literally and figuratively.
Were they to unearth the ax, and do battle for it year by year, the
idea would not be without precedent in American football circles. As
"Stanford '24" points out, Michigan and Minnesota battle for the tradi
tional brown jug; Indiana and Purdue grip at each other for possession
of an old oaken bucket; Illinois and Ohio State dispute the possession of
a wooden turtle, efTigy of the departed "Illibuck."
What does the Stanford ax look like? Thousands of Stanford "grads"
and undergraduates would like to know. But, unless California decides
otherwise, or some great scholar turns burglar to become the hero of the
hour (a course which we do not rccommend), the coveted trophy will
remain safely hidden in a bank vault.
Even if some David among the Sons of the Stanford Red could seize
the traditional ax, he still would be decidedly handicapped, what with the
prevalence of short skirts, in getting the trophy back to the Stanford
campus. It looks like a hopeless task. But California might lend ear to
"Stanford '24's" suggestion. Who knows?— Redwood City Tribune.

"Now that the "big game" is here, what about the Stanford ax? Why must
the traditional trophy be hidden in the vault of a bank? Every year we hear vague
rumors al>out the ax, but all the students and public know about it is that it was
stolen from Stanford back in 1892 by California. Many do not know that California
had t« hide it under the skirts of a woman to get it to Berkeley, where it was
securcly locked in a bank—to stay there continually except for a few brief moments
at the "big game" rally in Berkeley—and then back into the bank. Surely, one
cannot help but doubt the sportsmanship of California in this matter and certainly
California cannot be proud of the method used in stealing the ax.
"What a trophy it would be for the two teams to battle for in the 'big game!'
Let the winner keep it until beaten . .
Californians, quite naturally, will be amused by the suggestion that
they give up the Stanford ax, after having guarded it so closely all these
37 years. But, nevertheless, the idea put forward by the Stanford "grad"
has its merits.
Much of the splendid spirit that has made the "big game" between
Stanford and California the grid epic of the West, has been because the
Stanford ax has been buried, both literally and figuratively.
Were they to unearth the ax, and do battle for it year by year, the
idea would not be without precedent in American football circles. As
"Stanford '24" points out, Michigan and Minnesota battle for the tradi
tional brown jug; Indiana and Purdue grip at each other for possession
of an old oaken bucket; Illinois and Ohio State dispute the possession of
a wooden turtle, efTigy of the departed "Illibuck."
What does the Stanford ax look like? Thousands of Stanford "grads"
and undergraduates would like to know. But, unless California decides
otherwise, or some great scholar turns burglar to become the hero of the
hour (a course which we do not rccommend), the coveted trophy will
remain safely hidden in a bank vault.
Even if some David among the Sons of the Stanford Red could seize
the traditional ax, he still would be decidedly handicapped, what with the
prevalence of short skirts, in getting the trophy back to the Stanford
campus. It looks like a hopeless task. But California might lend ear to
"Stanford '24's" suggestion. Who knows?— Redwood City Tribune.
