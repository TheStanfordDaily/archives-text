THE WHIRLWIND, by William Davis.
The MacMillan Co., New York
1929. $2.50.
When Rene de Massac actually plans
to marry his lower-class sweetheart
instead of "genteelly corrupting her
as any man of breeding might have
done," when he expresses belief in
God, when he remains true to the op
pressed during the French Revolu
tion —by means of these and many
other traits in the character of Rene
the author of "The Whirlwind" draws
the contrasts that make his book in
teresting and readable throughout.
And in this way he shows how corrupt,
how pleasure-mad, and how extrava
gant was the court of Louis XVI of
France.
Evidently the book is written with
the aim of presenting as true a pic
ture of life in France during the
period of the Revolution as is pos
sible; and if we may believe Carlyle
and other historians on the subject,
the author has accomplished his aim.
The reader is given ample opportunity
to study the characters of many of
the famous people of the day—Louis
XVI, Marie Antoinette, Danton, Robes
pierre, St. Just, Mirabeau, and others.
Louis is shown as a weak-willed mon
arch in the hands of the court and
under the control of the imperious
Marie Antoinette; a king who is ill
fitted and little inclined to keep up
the splendor and pomp that was the
creation of Louis XIV.
By following the adventures of
Rene de Massac through the Revolu
tion the reader is able to gain much
information about that great upheaval
without the often unpopular process
of studying history. Descriptions, con
versations, little remarks dropped
here and there, all contribute to the
effect of the story and make it very
much a story of local color. The color
ing does not become obtrusive or tire
some.

Throughout the book runs the
charming love story of Rene and Vir
ginie, who are fighting against the
efforts of the Queen to break up the
romance in order to maintain the dig
nity of the nobility. At the end of the
tale, they are found happily married
in a calm and peaceful France, ready
to work out their destinies and enjoy
their romance so rudely interfered
with by the eventful years of the
Revolution. —T. D.
THE GREAT GABBO—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Eric Von Stroheim is too good an
actor to be laughed at ordinarily. But
when he appears in a picture show of
such amazing incongruities as "The
Great Gabbo," any audience can be
excused for snickering audibly half
a dozen times. You will enjoy the
show because you can sit back and
groan at it, without really being bored.
With a few exceptions, the sad parts
are funny, and the funny parts are
sad. That makes it bad enough, but
the unforgivable part about this pic
ture is its synchronization—some
times it really hurts.
The "Great Gabbo's" ventriloquist
act, which seems to be the main ex
cuse for the play, is genuinely good,
until the little puppet sings, and then
it is terrible. Betty Compson cannot
sing either, but she certainly can
dance. The choruses are far above the
average, in fact, and an excellent
technicolor number, and two very
tolerable theme songs, almost make
up for the general noisy, overdramatic
effect of the picture, except that these
choruses never tie up with the plot.
They are simply "planted," and they
keep coming on and coming on, until
you are sure that there couldn't pos
sibly be another one —and then ihere
are about five more. —M. L. R.

The "Great Gabbo's" ventriloquist
act, which seems to be the main ex
cuse for the play, is genuinely good,
until the little puppet sings, and then
it is terrible. Betty Compson cannot
sing either, but she certainly can
dance. The choruses are far above the
average, in fact, and an excellent
technicolor number, and two very
tolerable theme songs, almost make
up for the general noisy, overdramatic
effect of the picture, except that these
choruses never tie up with the plot.
They are simply "planted," and they

THE WHIRLWIND, by William Davis.
The MacMillan Co., New York
1929. $2.50.
When Rene de Massac actually plans
to marry his lower-class sweetheart
instead of "genteelly corrupting her
as any man of breeding might have
done," when he expresses belief in
God, when he remains true to the op
pressed during the French Revolu
tion —by means of these and many
other traits in the character of Rene
the author of "The Whirlwind" draws
the contrasts that make his book in
teresting and readable throughout.
And in this way he shows how corrupt,
how pleasure-mad, and how extrava
gant was the court of Louis XVI of
France.
Evidently the book is written with
the aim of presenting as true a pic
ture of life in France during the
period of the Revolution as is pos
sible; and if we may believe Carlyle
and other historians on the subject,
the author has accomplished his aim.
The reader is given ample opportunity
to study the characters of many of
the famous people of the day—Louis
XVI, Marie Antoinette, Danton, Robes
pierre, St. Just, Mirabeau, and others.
Louis is shown as a weak-willed mon
arch in the hands of the court and
under the control of the imperious
Marie Antoinette; a king who is ill
fitted and little inclined to keep up
the splendor and pomp that was the
creation of Louis XIV.
By following the adventures of
Rene de Massac through the Revolu
tion the reader is able to gain much
information about that great upheaval
without the often unpopular process
of studying history. Descriptions, con
versations, little remarks dropped
here and there, all contribute to the
effect of the story and make it very
much a story of local color. The color
ing does not become obtrusive or tire
some.

Throughout the book runs the
charming love story of Rene and Vir
ginie, who are fighting against the
efforts of the Queen to break up the
romance in order to maintain the dig
nity of the nobility. At the end of the
tale, they are found happily married
in a calm and peaceful France, ready
to work out their destinies and enjoy
their romance so rudely interfered
with by the eventful years of the
Revolution. —T. D.
THE GREAT GABBO—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
Eric Von Stroheim is too good an
actor to be laughed at ordinarily. But
when he appears in a picture show of
such amazing incongruities as "The
Great Gabbo," any audience can be
excused for snickering audibly half
a dozen times. You will enjoy the
show because you can sit back and
groan at it, without really being bored.
With a few exceptions, the sad parts
are funny, and the funny parts are
sad. That makes it bad enough, but
the unforgivable part about this pic
