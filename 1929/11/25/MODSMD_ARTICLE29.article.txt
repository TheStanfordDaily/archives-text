## 
### 
Before a crowd of ten thousand
Rocky Mountain football fans, the
Stanford, varsity easily outplayed the
University of Colorado team in the
Thanksgiving Day post-season game
to win 33 0. At only one time did the
Colorado offense threaten the Cardi
nal goal, while the Redshirts scored
five touchdowns and one drop kick
for a field goal.
L. R. Gay, '08, won the handicap
singles tournament held under the
auspices of the Tennis Club, and also
won his first leg on the silver cup do
nated by P. C. Theile of Palo Alto.
A player winning the tournament
three times was to take permanent

possession of the trophy.
The road in front of the Engineer
ing buildings was being leveled off to
insure better drainage. During the
rainy season it had been almost use
less for traffic.
It's just the same way now except
it's useless for traffic in dry weather
as well.
One of the yells during the football
season was:
Fight 'um, Stanford! Fight 'um fair!
Fight 'um square!
Fight 'um! Fight 'um! Fight 'um!
Shades of Gould and Peck! Drink
down a toast to 'um!
