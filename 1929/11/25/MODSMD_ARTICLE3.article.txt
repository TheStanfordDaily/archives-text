"With the death of 'The Tiger,'

cleau was at the head of the French
government as the President of the

Ruthlessly Attacked
" 'The Tiger' ruthlessly attacked
and suppressed the defeatists, revital

PARIS, Nov. 24. (/P)The stout heart

The sharp tongue of the grand old
jnan of France was silenced forever.
His predominating quality as author,
journalist and statesman always had
been the display of fighting spirit and

His predominating quality as author,
journalist and statesman always had
been the display of fighting spirit and
he died as he had lived —fighting until
his last breath.
"With the death of 'The Tiger,'
France today mourns the loss of one
of the greatest of all modern states
men, of the Georges Clemenceau who
will live in the history of the world
as the dictator who saved France
during the World War," declared Pro
fessor Ralph H. Lutz of the Stanford
history department in an interview
given to the Daily yesterday.
"In July 1917 after the May disas
ters Clemenceau and the Senate at
tacked Malvy and the other ministers
who had failed to suppress defeatism
in Fance. Four months later Clemen
cleau was at the head of the French
government as the President of the
Council and Minister of War, but in
reality he was the dictator of France.
Ruthlessly Attacked
" 'The Tiger' ruthlessly attacked
and suppressed the defeatists, revital
ized the government, and proclaimed
war to the death against the invaders,
appointing Foch marshal of France."
Remarking on the fighting instincts
of the rightly named "Tiger" Profes
sor Lutz said, "During the offensive
march of the Germans Clemenceau
declared that he would burn Paris if
it would save France.
Career Ended in 1920
"Together with President Wilson
and Prime Minister Lloyd George of
England Clemenceau made the Peace
of Versailles, after which his political
career came to a close in 1920."
In final tribute Professor Lutz said,
"Clemenceau undoubtedly saved his
country during the Great War and
France has lost in him one of her
greatest fighting statesmen."
PARIS, Nov. 24. (/P)The stout heart
of Georges Clemenceau, Tiger of
France, ceased beating at 1:45 this
morning. The war-time Premier was
88 years old.
The sharp tongue of the grand old
jnan of France was silenced forever.
His predominating quality as author,
journalist and statesman always had
been the display of fighting spirit and
he died as he had lived —fighting until
his last breath.
