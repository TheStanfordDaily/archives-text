## 
### 
Employing a force of approximately
1000 men and boys, the Board of Ath
letic Control handled the Big Game
crowds this year better than ever be
fore in the opinion of many of the
people who attended. By 6:30 in the
evening, the bulk of the automobiles
that had filled the parking areas had
gone, leaving only the usual quota of
people who had parked their cars and
forgotten what area they were in. By
8 o'clock, however, these stragglers
had all been collected up and sent on
their way.
Of the force employed, approximate
ly 600 were ushers, and the rest were
traffic directors, police, and food and
program vendors. Because so many
Stanford men attend the important
games with their parents and friends,
the Board of Athletic Control finds it
necessary to employ many students
from San Jose State, and from nearby
high schools.
