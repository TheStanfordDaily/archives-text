# STANFORD'S FURIOUS ATTACK BEATS CALIFORNIA
## 
### 

The heart of the Golden Bear was broken on this play. Lom (28), California star, has tossed a short forward
pass which was battered back by charging Redshirts who over-ran California's forward wall to break up the play
that promised another touchdown and the virtual evening up of chances for victory. The ball is seen in mid-air
over Stanford's 13-yard line.
