# CHOICES FOR ANNUAL "ROSE BOWL" GAME NARROW TO 7 TEAMS
## 
### 
With the passing of another week of
football, the choice of the Rose Tour
nament Committee on the East-West
game at Pasadena on New Year's Day
narrows down to five teams in the
East and two on the Pacific Coast.
Purdue University, which last Sat
urday won its first Big Ten title in
thirty-two years by defeating Indiana
32-0, is the most sought-for team in
the East, but a Big Ten ruling pro
hibits any Big Ten team from playing
in the Rose Bowl classic. However,

the rule may be waived this year.
Pittsburgh, another possibility, may
not be able to accept because of fac
ulty objections. The same is true of
Tulane University in New Orleans.
Tennessee, Southern Conference cham
pions, may make the journey to south
ern California, and as yet appears to
have no objection to accepting the in
vitation.
California, which was the outstand
ing West team, will probably decline
in view of their defeat by Stanford
Saturday, as neither the players nor
Coach Price are in favor of the game.
In the event of California's formally
declining, the West team will undoubt
edly be Saint Mary's, to date the only
important team in the country whose

goal line has not been crossed.
If the Moraga institution accepts,
Notre Dame, considered by most foot
ball fans over the country as the best
team in the United States, may play
for the East as there is a strong bond
1 of friendship between Coaches Knute
J Rockne and "Slip" Madigaij of the
; two universities.
