# BRILLIANT COLOR IN STUNTS DISPLAYED BY RIVAL CHEER GROUPS
## 
### 
Colorful rooting section stunts exe
cuted with accuracy and precision
featured the interim between halves
at the annual Big Game classic.
California formed the first stunt
when the section changed from a blue
"C" on a field of gold to a brilliant
"S" circled by a scarlet band. Stan
ford followed by creating a brown
bear head with a California blue and
gold "C" in the foreground.
A likeness of "Nibs" Price and a
picture of a Stanford rooter changing
from a smile at the start of the jrame
to a scowl at the finish were the fea
tures of the California section. Other
California stunts which drew applause
were a Bear crying over a Stanford
coffin, and the Golden Boar hurdling
Washington and U.S.C., a stunt in
which the position of the California
mascot was changed from the U.S.C,
hurdle to the top of a higher barrier
formed by a "S" on a white field,
with 1929 showing at the side of the
section.
Stanford's best stunts were the
golden "C" with a white campanile
showing in a green foreground, a pic
ture of Captain Mush Muller catching
a pass, and a perfectly formed A.meri
can flag.
