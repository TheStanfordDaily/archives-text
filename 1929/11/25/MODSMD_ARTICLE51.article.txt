# COACHES HAVE RIGHT TO BOOST SALARIES, DECIDES GEORGE ADE

### 
Football coaches have a perfect
right to boost their salaries to cham
pionships along with their teams, de
clares George Ade in a recent issue of
"Liberty."
The noted humorist says, "All this
worry about coaches being paid large
sums of money is superfluous. The
faculties are wrought up because a
coach is sometimes paid $10,000 a
year and the dean of a department
gets only $GOOO. Why not pay $10,000
to a coach if he is worth it? He rep
resents the survival of the fittest and
has fought his way through a com
peting army and put himself at the
front.
"The dean who gets $GOOO may be
simply an amiable gentleman who has
drifted with the placid tides of scho
lastic life and is no more a combative
influence in his college community
than a full-sized caterpillar. The
coach who holds his job must be a big
man in several ways. 'Pop' Warner,
Fielding Yost, Alonzo Stagg, Knute
Rockne, and Bob Zuppke would have
been commanding figures in any busi
ness or profession if they had not
turned out to be coaches."
