# Card Rooter Cut By Rock Thrown From Cal Section
## 
### 
Socco! And Sidney Charles Singer,
Jr., junior soccer manager, went down
for the count of six when some un- \
known California assailant pegged a
rock at him. Singer took the blow
standing in front of the California
rooting section after the game, and i
although he was wearing his rooter's
cap, the rock cut a gash in his fore- ;
head.
He was taken to the Palo Alto llos- !
pital immediately, where it was found
necessary to take three stitches to
sew up the wound.
