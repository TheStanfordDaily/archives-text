# NEW OCEAN MAIL ROUTES GRANTED BY GOVERNMENT
## Plan Will Aid Shipbuilding, Return Merchant Marine To Former Post-War Rank Construction of 40 Vessels Under New Appropriation; Thirteen Lines Approved 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25. (/P)â€” By a
single action, the federal government
moved today to fill American ship
yards with new construction and re
store the merchant marine to the
position it held immediately after the
war through the approval of thirteen
new ocean mail routes.
Mail contracts to be let under the
recommendations of the interdepart
mental board will call for construc
tion of about 40 new vessels, with a
gross tonnage of about 460,000 during
the next ten years at an estimated
cost of $250,000,000.
Contracts Awarded
Twenty-five contracts already have
been awarded and are costing the
government approximately $5,000,000
annually for mail transportation under
poundage rates. The new contracts
are expected to double this expendi
ture and bring the outlay to within
$3,000,000 of the sum appropriated by
congress for the purpose.
The thirteen lines approved by the
board as essential trade routes are
three in the North Atlantic from New
York, one from New Orleans to Spain
and Portugal known as the West
Mediterranean line, from New Orleans
to the east coast of South Africa,
Baltimore and Newport News to Ger
man ports, New York to Colombia,
San Francisco to Puerto Colombia,
New York to Valparaiso, Tacoma to
Valparaiso, New York to Limon, Costa
Rica, New Orleans to Puerto Colom
bia, and San Francisco to Corinto.
