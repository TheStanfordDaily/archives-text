# HOOSIERS AND CADETS HEAD LIST OF TURKEY DAY GRIDIRON DISHES

### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 25 (/P).â€”Capped
by the youngest of the classics, the Notre
Dame-Army game at the Yankee Sta
dium next Saturday, the Eastern foot
ball Thanksgiving week program is also
featured by holiday clashes between Penn
sylvania and Cornell at Philadelphia,
Pittsburgh, and Penn State at Pittsburgh,
and West Virginia and Washington and
Jefferson at Morgantown.
Notre Dame, on Saturday, will battle
the Army at the Yankee Stadium in the
most colorful fray of the week, an East
ern climax game that overshadows even
such attractive contests as the Cornell-
Penn and Navy-Dartmouth contests, both
at Franklin Field, Philadelphia.
Triumphant in eight successive games
as the Hoosier machine has swept bril
liantly toward the national peak, Notre
Dame will run into a determined Army
eleven, featuring the last-season charge
of the all-American halfback. Red Cagle.
Approximately 80,000 spectators are ex
pected to see Captain Cagle match his
individual passing and running powers
against the great Notre Dame cast.
The Hoosiers will be handicapped by
the absence of their ailing coach, Knute
Rockne, as well as by the loss of Tim
Moynihan, dynamic center, who suffered
a broken leg in the 26-6 victory Saturday
over Northwestern, but the Hoosiers so
far have had the stuff to rise to every
emergency. Army has yet to win a major
game, but if the Cadets can upset Notre
Dame, it will be sufficient balm for all
the bad breaks they have had this year.'
