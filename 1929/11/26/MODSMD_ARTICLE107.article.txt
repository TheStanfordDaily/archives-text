Generations of students differ from one
another in the clothes they wear, the way
they dance, and what they eat for break
fast ; but, according to Dean George B.
Culver, who has watched many classes
come and go, "The changing fashion in
dogs is one of the most interesting to
observe."
"When I first came to Stanford," said
Dean Culver, "it was the day of the
bulldog. The uglier, the fiercer looking,
the better—but every student must have
one. Then came the cocker spaniels, not
such a long drawn out vogue, but very
much in evidence at one time.
"The next period was that of the Irish

| setter, most prominent among which was
I Rex, famous setter of Lane Falk's, track
j captain at the time. Rex and his brothers
i held sway over the campus.
"The fox terrier held somewhat the
position of a split infinitive. For a time
everyone had to have a smooth haired
terrier, and later those of the wire-haired
species were the rage. In between these
two allied fashions came the airedale, a
'homely but lovable' representative of the
canine race.
"And now," concluded the dean, "the
police dog, or German shepherd dog, as
they are called to make them seem less
ferocious, seem to be gaining the ascend
ency. You can't tell what will come next."
