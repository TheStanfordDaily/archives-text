Play Mystifying
With eleven people on the stage at the
time of the murder of Hancock Robinson,
and with several of these eleven bearing
grudges of various sorts against the vic
tim, "Cock Robin" is one of the most
mystifying plays of the year. Reminding
one of the story in which an actor says
"My God, I am shot," the shooting of
Hancock Robin, a member of the Cope
Valley Community Players, takes place
on the stage at a benefit performance of
that company.
In a duel scene in which four or five
pistols are held in various hands off stage
and on, Hancock Robinson, who is plan
ning to elope that night with Carlotta, is
shot to death, "clean through, east to
west." And every one of his eleven fel
low-players is immediately shrouded in
suspicion. The final unraveling of the
mystery, of course, holds a big surprise.
As there will be less than two weeks
for preparation for "Cock Robin," re
hearsals commence tonight at 7 o'clock in
the Assembly Hall, according to Hel
venston, who reports one of the best soph
omore turnouts of the past few years.
