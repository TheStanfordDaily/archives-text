## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 25 (£>).—
President Paul Shoup of the Southern
Pacific Company today offered to make
a "bridge" of his company's lines so that
the Great Northern and the Western Pa
cific would not have to build 200 miles of
new track to connect their systems in
northern California.
Shoup was the big gun of the forces
opposed to the construction of the Klam
ath Falls, Oregon, to Keddie, California,
line planned by the Great Northern and
the Western Pacific at the hearing this
afternoon before C. D. Mehaffie, finance
director of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission.
The Southern Pacific president made a
long statement, questioned occasionally
by his brother, Guy V. Shoup, chief of
counsel for the Southern Pacific.
