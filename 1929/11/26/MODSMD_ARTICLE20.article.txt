WASHINGTON, D.C., Nov. 25 (JF).
—Responses received today by Presiaent
Hoover from a little less than half of the
state governors to whom he appealed Sat
urday for co-operation in the present dis
turbed situation enabled him to envision
a vast army of workers engaged upon
accelerated programs of state, municipal,
and county construction.
Ten of the twenty-two executives who
either had communicated with the White
House directly or made statements for
newspapers gave precise figures of the
programs in their states which amounted
to approximately $375,000,000. This fig
ure is considered surprisingly large for
less than a fourth of the country and
exclusive of New York.
