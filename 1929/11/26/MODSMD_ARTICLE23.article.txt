# NATURAL BEAUTY CONSERVATION IS URGED BY WHITE
## 
### 
"There is nothing more practical than
the conservation of beauty, according to
President Roosevelt," said Colonel John
R. White, superintendent of Sequoia Na
tional Park, in an informal talk before
friends of the Stanford University Press
at a reception in his honor last night in
the Women's Clubhouse. Professor Wil
liam Hawley Davis, Press editor, presided.
National parks, of which there are now
twenty-one, are an American invention.
All but one of them, which is in Maine,
are west of the Rockies. California con
tains four, two more than any other state.
"National forests," he declared, "are
designed for economic development; na
tional parks, for scenic and educational
purposes. Horsepower of the waterfalls
in the parks is not wasted, because the
beauty of the falls is enjoyed by the many
thousands of tourists who visit the parks
annually."
