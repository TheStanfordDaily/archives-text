# AND SHUT THE DOOR BEHIND YOU!

Every once in a while an editor gets vexed, even a school boy editor,
at the constant bombardment from people, nice, whole-hearted, interested
people, for "space" for "this" or "that."
"Only yesterday yon gave a top column to that snooty organization
which doesn't rate worth a damn compared to ours. How do they get
their drag?" are the remarks heard in this office as often as "have you a
cigarette." And the editor sits back and smiles and assures the nice,
whole-hearted, interested people that all is well and that their organiza
tions and pet projects are going to reform the world over night, and
things go on as usual.
The editor of the Daily Bruin of U.C.L.A. has done what we have
always wanted to do but never did, call it lack of nerve, being too diplo
matic, or too sweet, or what have you. But for this once we are aiming
our guns, let the peanuts fall where they may, reprinting word for word
the editorial from the Daily Bruin, and taking off our hats to Walt Bogart,
its editor, for his fortitude.
