# They, Too, Have Suffered

The way of the transgressor is hard but just, but the way of
the college journalist is even harder and, discounting sins in pre
vious reincarnations, we rise to our feet and cry that horrible in
justice of the situation.
Morning, noon, and night the college journalist is beset with
all manner of forceful suggestions on the use of the thunderbolts
placed in his keeping by the Great God Publicity. Professors walk
dignifiedly into the office and solemnly request that their lecture
on "The Attitude of the Frog toward Hypo-catalysis" or some
similar subject, be run verbatim. Indignant young things demand
in shrill voices that their pet organization or project be given the
attention and "position" which the great cause deserves. Campus
politicians and student officers make dark threats on what will
happen to the writer or editor who refuses them the wholesale use
of the columns of the daily paper. And man, woman, or child
who sets foot inside the door never fails, before passing out again,
to put the innocent journalist right on the principles and ethics
of his profession.
And the pitiful part is that the suffering journalist can do
nothing to remedy the situation. No amount of colossal effort is
able to turn the university public to anything resembling a sane
view.
So with the patience of Job, the tongue of a Muchausen, and
the outlook of a cynic, he must bear things as they are —with his
only hope that some day the suffering are rewarded.
