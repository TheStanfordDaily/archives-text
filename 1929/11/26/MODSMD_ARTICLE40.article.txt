# GOOD MUSIC A REAL TREAT
## 
### 
Presenting the finest musical attractions in America at a cost within
reach of all, the A.S.S.U. Concert Series presents a cultural opportunity
too good to be missed by students.
The student series offers to the campus and to peninsula patrons the
most music for the least time, effort, and money expended since it brings
the artists to our own community at a convenient time.
Alfred Hertz and the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra need no
introduction to the Pacific Coast, and Ignaz Friedman, celebrated concert
pianist, has an international reputation. These two will appear in the
first two concerts of the series. Tickets for the concert will be sold
today.
