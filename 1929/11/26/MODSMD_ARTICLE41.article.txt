# SOCIAL CONTACTS AND SOCIAL CLIMBERS
## 
### 
"A university is not primarily for social contacts. You can get those
at any country club." This is the belief of Robert Maynard Hutchins,
30-year-old administrative genius, who last week was inducted into the
president's chair of the young but potent University of Chicago.
Scarcely out of his twenties and at a time when most young men are
struggling to free themselves from the bonds of mediocrity, President
Hutchins steps to the helm of Chicago's greatest institution, the sixth
largest college in the United States.
Although no university maintains that social life should be paramount,
contact with one's fellow men is certainly a major factor in one's college
education.
Academic prowess of a university shoves a school to the head of the
line in scholastic endeavor, but for all the preponderance of studious
grads, the great melting pot of social contact offers benefits which
threaten to overshadow and eclipse the rather abstract values of mental
illumination.
Ability to live amicably and fairly with man is something all should
possess. And it is only through life, through contact, through association
with one's fellows, that such can be gained.
As Chicago's forte is research and post-graduate work, President
Ilutchins will undoubtedly chart his university's course through the calm
byways of deep study and concentration, and not via the sometimes tur
bulent paths of social flair and campus glamour.
Half of Chicago's graduates go forth as preachers and pedagogs; 119
of them have become college presidents. Last week University of
Chicago students voted the Bible as their Favorite Book. And the
registration figures indicate that more than 40 per cent of the enrollment
are graduate students.
Viewing the situation from a distant vantage, Chicago has not been
and will not be an institution "primarily for social contacts."
