THE LOST SHIRT, by Joseph An
thany. Brentano's, New York. 1929.
Beyond a doubt the world's worst
doggerel has at last made Its bow.
This poem was Inspired by the recent
stock market collapse, and it falls
flatter than the market did on its most
dismal day.
A comment on the jacket reads: "If
you feel like committing suicide over
the market, buy this book and laugh
yourself to death."
The humor consists chiefly on feeble
puns, and the hottest wise-crack in
the book is an account of the author's
stenographer fainting when he asked
for wider margins on a letter. Anyone
who can get anything worse than a
mild case of hangnails over that must
have a weak constitution.
To quote one verse, not typical, but
the best in the entire book:
"My gentle mother, many blessings
on her,
Wise sayings taught to keep my
soul from Tophet.
Said she, of old: 'No profit's with
out honor
Save when, my boy, it is a paper
profit.'"
That's the best of the forty verses,
and the worst is left to the reader's
imagination.
Another "blurb" on the jacket says,
"It has done more to revive panic
stricken America than all the bankers
and politicians."
If it had any effect at all, it was
probably responsible for the second
collapse of the market! —M. S.
IS SEX NECESSARY? by James Thur
ber and E. B. White. Harpers.
1929. At the Alcove Book Shop,
Palo Alto.
One Thurber and White did take it
upon themselves to speak lighily of
sex, to speak very lightly of it in fact
—in other words, to make light of it.
Thurber and White begin with these
well — or ill —chosen words. The
"Foreword" starts thus: "During the
past year, two factors in our civiliza
tion have been greatly overemplia

sized. One is aviation, the other is
sex. Looked at calmly, neither diver
sion is entitled to the space it has
been accorded. Each has been deliber
ately promoted."
Having begun in that vein, a light
one, Thurber and White proceed to
make the vein in which they have
begun even lighter. Aviation is irrele
vant to their discussion, but sex is
not —not irrelevant, that is. Sex, being
at once a factor in our civilization and
a diversion, becomes cause for much
levity. Thurber and White laugh. You
know it after reading no more than
the foreword. Having discovered that
Thurber and White are laughing—up
their sleeve, their four sleeves, if you
please—you laugh with them. You
laugh irrationally and incessantly till
you reach the last sentence in the
book proper, or book improper, that is
to say, on page 179. Here is the last
sentence:
"So you see, frigidity in men has
many aspects, many angles. To me it
is vastly more engrossing than frigid
ity in women, which is such a simple
phenomenon you wonder anybody
bothers about it at all."
Between the first sentence, you re
member —the one in the foreword —
and the last sentence, there are, oh,
many sentences, hundreds of sen
tences, thousands even —in short,
many funny sentences.
Not only are there sentences in this
book, but beyond page 179, there is
a glossary of terms used. Here is
one definition: "Erotic: Of or per
taining to sex, usually in a pretty
far fetched manner."
And not only is there a glossary but
there are drawings to illustrate the
text —to make things easier for the
reader, that is. After telling us candid
ly—candidly?—that the inclusion cf
some fifty-two drawings by Thurber,
was "on the whole intentional," White
dubs Thurber the "Ugly Artist." Is
that nice?
Thurber and White have written a
Great American Satire. By all means
—or by some means, rather —read it.

THE LOST SHIRT, by Joseph An
thany. Brentano's, New York. 1929.
Beyond a doubt the world's worst
doggerel has at last made Its bow.
This poem was Inspired by the recent
stock market collapse, and it falls
flatter than the market did on its most
dismal day.
A comment on the jacket reads: "If
you feel like committing suicide over
the market, buy this book and laugh
yourself to death."
The humor consists chiefly on feeble
puns, and the hottest wise-crack in
the book is an account of the author's
stenographer fainting when he asked
for wider margins on a letter. Anyone
who can get anything worse than a
mild case of hangnails over that must
have a weak constitution.
To quote one verse, not typical, but
the best in the entire book:
"My gentle mother, many blessings
on her,
Wise sayings taught to keep my
soul from Tophet.
Said she, of old: 'No profit's with
out honor
Save when, my boy, it is a paper
profit.'"
That's the best of the forty verses,
and the worst is left to the reader's
imagination.
Another "blurb" on the jacket says,
"It has done more to revive panic
stricken America than all the bankers
and politicians."
If it had any effect at all, it was
probably responsible for the second
collapse of the market! —M. S.
IS SEX NECESSARY? by James Thur
ber and E. B. White. Harpers.
1929. At the Alcove Book Shop,
Palo Alto.
One Thurber and White did take it
upon themselves to speak lighily of
sex, to speak very lightly of it in fact
—in other words, to make light of it.
Thurber and White begin with these
well — or ill —chosen words. The
"Foreword" starts thus: "During the
past year, two factors in our civiliza
tion have been greatly overemplia

sized. One is aviation, the other is
sex. Looked at calmly, neither diver
sion is entitled to the space it has
been accorded. Each has been deliber
ately promoted."
Having begun in that vein, a light
one, Thurber and White proceed to
make the vein in which they have
begun even lighter. Aviation is irrele
vant to their discussion, but sex is
not —not irrelevant, that is. Sex, being
at once a factor in our civilization and
a diversion, becomes cause for much
levity. Thurber and White laugh. You
know it after reading no more than
the foreword. Having discovered that
Thurber and White are laughing—up
their sleeve, their four sleeves, if you
please—you laugh with them. You
laugh irrationally and incessantly till
you reach the last sentence in the
book proper, or book improper, that is
to say, on page 179. Here is the last
sentence:
"So you see, frigidity in men has
many aspects, many angles. To me it
is vastly more engrossing than frigid
ity in women, which is such a simple
phenomenon you wonder anybody
bothers about it at all."
Between the first sentence, you re

Having begun in that vein, a light
one, Thurber and White proceed to
make the vein in which they have
begun even lighter. Aviation is irrele
vant to their discussion, but sex is
not —not irrelevant, that is. Sex, being
at once a factor in our civilization and
a diversion, becomes cause for much
levity. Thurber and White laugh. You
know it after reading no more than
the foreword. Having discovered that
Thurber and White are laughing—up
their sleeve, their four sleeves, if you
please—you laugh with them. You
laugh irrationally and incessantly till
you reach the last sentence in the
book proper, or book improper, that is
to say, on page 179. Here is the last
sentence:
"So you see, frigidity in men has
many aspects, many angles. To me it
is vastly more engrossing than frigid
ity in women, which is such a simple
phenomenon you wonder anybody
bothers about it at all."
Between the first sentence, you re
member —the one in the foreword —
and the last sentence, there are, oh,
many sentences, hundreds of sen
tences, thousands even —in short,
many funny sentences.
Not only are there sentences in this
book, but beyond page 179, there is
a glossary of terms used. Here is
one definition: "Erotic: Of or per
taining to sex, usually in a pretty
far fetched manner."
And not only is there a glossary but
there are drawings to illustrate the
text —to make things easier for the
reader, that is. After telling us candid
ly—candidly?—that the inclusion cf
some fifty-two drawings by Thurber,
was "on the whole intentional," White
dubs Thurber the "Ugly Artist." Is
that nice?
Thurber and White have written a
Great American Satire. By all means
—or by some means, rather —read it.

THE LOST SHIRT, by Joseph An
thany. Brentano's, New York. 1929.
Beyond a doubt the world's worst
doggerel has at last made Its bow.
This poem was Inspired by the recent
stock market collapse, and it falls
flatter than the market did on its most
dismal day.
A comment on the jacket reads: "If
you feel like committing suicide over
the market, buy this book and laugh
yourself to death."
The humor consists chiefly on feeble
puns, and the hottest wise-crack in
the book is an account of the author's
stenographer fainting when he asked
for wider margins on a letter. Anyone
who can get anything worse than a
mild case of hangnails over that must
have a weak constitution.
To quote one verse, not typical, but
the best in the entire book:
"My gentle mother, many blessings
on her,
Wise sayings taught to keep my
soul from Tophet.
Said she, of old: 'No profit's with
out honor
Save when, my boy, it is a paper
profit.'"
That's the best of the forty verses,
and the worst is left to the reader's
imagination.
Another "blurb" on the jacket says,
"It has done more to revive panic
stricken America than all the bankers
and politicians."
If it had any effect at all, it was
probably responsible for the second
collapse of the market! —M. S.
IS SEX NECESSARY? by James Thur
ber and E. B. White. Harpers.
1929. At the Alcove Book Shop,
Palo Alto.
One Thurber and White did take it
upon themselves to speak lighily of
sex, to speak very lightly of it in fact
—in other words, to make light of it.
Thurber and White begin with these
well — or ill —chosen words. The
"Foreword" starts thus: "During the
past year, two factors in our civiliza
tion have been greatly overemplia

sized. One is aviation, the other is
sex. Looked at calmly, neither diver
sion is entitled to the space it has
been accorded. Each has been deliber
ately promoted."
Having begun in that vein, a light
one, Thurber and White proceed to
make the vein in which they have
begun even lighter. Aviation is irrele
vant to their discussion, but sex is
not —not irrelevant, that is. Sex, being
at once a factor in our civilization and
a diversion, becomes cause for much
levity. Thurber and White laugh. You
know it after reading no more than
the foreword. Having discovered that
Thurber and White are laughing—up
their sleeve, their four sleeves, if you
please—you laugh with them. You
laugh irrationally and incessantly till
you reach the last sentence in the
book proper, or book improper, that is
to say, on page 179. Here is the last
sentence:
"So you see, frigidity in men has
many aspects, many angles. To me it
is vastly more engrossing than frigid
ity in women, which is such a simple
phenomenon you wonder anybody
bothers about it at all."
Between the first sentence, you re
member —the one in the foreword —
and the last sentence, there are, oh,
many sentences, hundreds of sen
tences, thousands even —in short,
many funny sentences.
Not only are there sentences in this

a glossary of terms used. Here is

And not only is there a glossary but
