## BUT WE HAD GOODWILL ASSEMBLIES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
What hath the Big Game wrought?
Several dozen professional sports writers
have been kind enough to enumerate the
more obvious and least disputed results.
For Stanford: many a well-filled heart
and purse. For California: many a night
mare of reminiscence, filled with the flash
of cardinal breeches, and loomed over by
the grim, dauntless face of an Old Fox.
Some of them also mentioned inci
dentally that the California rooters ac
cepted their defeat in silence. Will you
permit me, as one who tries to speak not
from post-mortem malice but from a deep
love of the old, partly-practiced virtues
of courtesy and courage, to remark that
here the green-sheeters were grievously
awry ?
For when the triumphant Stanfordites
surged over to the California section,
while they were greeted with some silence,
they were met by a great deal of profane
objurgation and obscene gesticulation.
Not even during the singing of our hymn
(which, heaven knows, is always clumsy
enough at best!) could all of the Berke
leyans refrain from vocally revealing the
bitterness within their breasts.
Granted, they had received a disheart
ening blow. Only three hours before,
their ears had still been ringing with the
bravest pre-game speeches heard on the
Berkeley campus since the demise of

Andy Smith; there had been ten-to-one
bets ; there had been Samsonian plans re
garding the Stanford goal posts; there
had been rumor of national champion
ships. And the score! Why the score,
ladies and gentlemen, was TWENTY
ONE TO SIX!
However, by one on the lookout for
courtesy and courage, the situation can
not be accepted as an excuse. Nay, rather
than excuse them, it can only further
damn them: for it was a situation which
should have brought out all the sports
manship they possessed: it was an acid
test. And it seemed to indicate, alas, that
the Golden Bear—however brightly he
may glisten—is partly brass.
Too bad.
For the game of football, as the game
of life, should not be taken too seriously.
The mere fact of defeat should not be
the basis of deciding and announcing that
your opponent is a rogue and an ass.
Neither, of course, should the fact of vic
tory—
So here ensueth the lesson: when the
days of dearth shall blight the Stanford
grid (and pray God they are far in the
misty future!) let it never be said that
our banner is less shining in defeat than
in victory. Back in 1929, may we say,
we looked at certain Berkeley rooters and
learned how not to lose!
Sincerely,
—A. Lumnus
