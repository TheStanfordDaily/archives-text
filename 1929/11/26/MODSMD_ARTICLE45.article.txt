# ALL STANFORD STUDENTS ARE FOR STANFORD
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
While the exultant cheers for our win
ning football team are still ringing in our
ears, the writer would like to pay a com
pliment to our rooting section as a whole
and to two Oriental students who sat next
to him in particular. When our rooting
section rose to cheer the team or to shout
for 110 better reason than the sheer exu
berance of victory, these two Orientals,
undoubtedly subsidized by'the Minister
of Education in their homeland, cheered
as lustily as did good "Boom" Drumm
himself.
When Frentrup dropped back as though
to pass, dodged a would-be California
pass rusher, and then ran some fifteen or
twenty yards through a broken field, one
of these "foreign" students turned to the

other and shouted wildly, "Psychology!
Psychology!"—and they patted each oth
er on the back and cheered as lustily as
any of the assembled Sons of the Stan
ford Red.
The writer had formerly considered
these foreign students to be a stolid,
phlegmatic group of academic individuals
who regarded our pet enthusiasms with
amused tolerance but did not share with
us that ever-present flame of college spir
it. The gesture of these two Stanford
men joining the milling throng on the
field, being swallowed up in the serpen
tine, and going with us in our little visit
to the California rooting section was of
greater actual significance than the win
ning of the Game.
