# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO, NOVEMBER 26, 1904

During the Thanksgiving recess,
the freshmen played two practice
baseball games against teams made
up mainly of second team varsity
men. Although an unusual number of
freshman players turned out, few
stood out superior to the rest.
More than fifty Stanford alumni at
tended tho annual banquet of the
Stanford Club of New York held at
the Park Avenue Hotel. Among (hose
present were Will Irwin, A. H. Suz
zalo, and E. W. Smith, all of the class
of 1899.
Work on the new gymnasium was
progressing rapidly and there was
every Indication that the building
would be completed by the next Sep
tember. Only the central wing stood

uncompleted, work being delayed
through difficulty in procuring the
heavy "lintel" and other large block
stones.
College Notes: About 175 men
turned out for fall track at Harvard,
and practice had started October 4.
Early in tho summer a large gar
bage crematory was built in the foot
hills near tho rock quarry. There was
a large oven and other up-to-date
facilities for disposing of refuse which
should have been able to fill the
needs of the community for years to
come.
