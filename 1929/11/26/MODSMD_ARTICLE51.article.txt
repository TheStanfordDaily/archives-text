## AN UNTIEABLE KNOT 
### 
Now that the most unexpected of un
expecteds has taken place—Stanford's 21
to 6 taming of the Golden Hear—and the
leading Coast sports critics are noncha
lantly saying "I told you so," many of
the common citizens and spectators are
beginning to wonder just what effect the
outcome of the Big Game has on the
final standings of the Pacific Coast Con
ference title race.
Well, to make a short story
still shorter, the Cardinals' win
cheated California out of the first
place crown of glory. And, in so
doing, it threw the Conference
iato a five-way tie for the covet
ed top position.
The Big Game upset knotted
the count so tight that even the
most omnipotent of gridiron mo
guls cannot untie it!
And, moreover, next Saturday's Tro
jan-Washington State game will not alter
the position one bit, unless, of course, the
Cougars pull off another one of those
things. Provided the Thundering Herd
emerges victorious, as it should quite han
dily, the Conference will still remain an
unsolvable muddle. In other words, Stan
ford, California, Southern California, and
Oregon will all hold down first place on
a par.
There will he no Pacific Coast Confer
ence champion for the year 1929 A.D.!
The reason for all this is that
Conference standings are not
reckoned on a percentage basis.
Thus, it matters not that U.S.C.
plays and wins one more game
than the rest of the leading out
fits. The Conference rule em
phatically states that any team
playing at least five games within
the governing body's jurisdiction
shall be eligible for the title.
Provided the Trojans win over the
week-end, the P.C.C. will he tied as fol
lows :
W L T
Stanford 5 1 0
California 4 1 0
Southern California ..6 1 0
Oregon 4 1 0
An All-Coast Quartet
Although every one oi tne Lards who
saw action on the 23rd came through with
a rip-snorting demonstration, the Daily
picks out and highly recommends four of
them for all-Coast honors. For this same
quartet of pigskin hounds has been play
ing outstanding hall all year. The Daily
does not choose these candidates for their
spectacular work, but for their steady
play, their constant fight, and for their
ability to always come through in the
pinches.
Real all-Coast men are not those who
merely flash into the public mind from
time to time by some unusual feat or bit
of luck, but, quite to the contrary, those
unsung young gentlemen who are always
on the spot when needed and whose steady
work is most valuable to their team week
after week.
First of all is Captain Mush
Muller. Mu6h has been an inspi
ration to the Redshirts all year,
and his leadership has been a
blessing to Stanford football
chances. Besides injecting fight
and spirit into his fellow players,
Mr. Muller is without doubt the
best ball snagger on the Coast
today!
His playing last Saturday needs no
comment, as lie consistently brought the
90,000 odd fans to their feet with his
agile feats that happened just at the time
they were most needed. Anyone who can
break through a team as strong as the
Bears and block two kicks is some man !
Then there is Walt Heinecke.
Walt has not been given a break
by the all-wise sports writers this
fall. Yet, every week, without
exception, he has been a star
player and on every occasion he
lias outplayed his rivals at the
center position. He dumped over
the much-heralded Stadelman of
Oregon time after time, upset
the highly touted Jessup of
Washington with machine - like
regularity, and tossed the 240-
pound Trojan, Dye, around as
though the latter were a new
born babe.
Last Saturday—well, only the most
biased of Blue and Gold supporters have
the nerve to say that Riegels was the best
center on the field that day. Heinecke is
an all-Coast player, or the critics are
dumb as well as blind!
Another lineman who deserves lots of
credit and a place on every all-star selec
tion on the Pacific slopes is Ray Tandy,
at tackle. A lot of sophisticated persons
who profess to know football will prob
ably ask: "Who is Tandy? What does
he. play?"
Mr. Tandy is one sweet grid
iron cavorter, and iron man of
the Card forward wall. No team
has been able to budge him out
of the way, and no back has ever
plunged over his position for
more than an inch or two at a
time. As someone said the other
day, "They only try to go through
Tandy once. They peck away at
other spots in the line during the
rest of the afternoon." The Big
Game was no exception!
Last but not least is Chuck Smalling,
plowing, plunging, smashing, pile-driving
fullback. Whenever a yard is needed,
Mr. Smalling sees to it that it is needed
no longer. Besides tearing the opposing
line to bits, the powerhouse back is one
vicious tackier.
It is no wonder that Pop War
ner said that Chuck Smalling is
the most reliable back on the
Stanford squad. The team never
calls time out on Smalling's ac
count. He is too rough and tough
for that. And he plays a heads
up game of football at all times.
On Saturday last he took special
delight in batting down passes
tossed by the mighty B. Lom.
