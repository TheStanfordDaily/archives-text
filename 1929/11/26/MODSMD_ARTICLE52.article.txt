# VARSITY WILL HAVE SHORT REST BEFORE WEST POINT BATTLE
## Thornhill, Winterburn Will Coach During "Pop's" Absence in East 
### Stephen Dietrich 
With the fifth meeting between Pop
and Nibs and the 35th annual gold
metal pigskin classic west of the
Rockies now a thing of the past and
just another one of those glorious
conference endings for the Cardinals,
the Stanford varsity is scheduled to
take a week's rest cure before resum
ing preparations for the West Point
battle to be played in the Farm bowl
on December 28th.
And the Cards well deserve to gulp
down their Thanksgiving turkeys in
peace and quiet after that memorable
and hectic conflict of the the 23rd.
For, although Stanford won in deci
sive fashion, not a few of the Red
shirts were bruised and battered a bit
by the stubborn, pugnacious Golden
Bear.
No One Injured
However, none of the players were
seriously injured and the varsity
crutch-carriers' club still remains inem
berless. Walt Heinecke, sterling Card
pivot man, was forced to spend the
last couple of days in the Palo Alto
Hospital, but not on account of in
juries. He merely played himself rut
after giving all he had for ilfty-ni :e
minutes to the gruelling fray, and, as
a consequence, Dr. E. F. Roth, team
physician, ordered him to bed until
he had fully recovered from the ef
fects of the game.
A few of the other players needed
a small amount of medical attention
on Saturday. Ray Tandy sustained a
bruised leg and was forced out of
the contest early in the second half.
Bull Driscoll, Ray Dawson, and Phil
Neill were also bunged up a little, but
all of these men are back in good
condition once more and will be ready
to see action in the Army encounter.
Practice Next Monday
When the team trots out on the
practice field next Monday, it will be
joined by Bill Simkins, Pete Heiser,
and Rudy Rintala. All three were kept
out of the Cal game because of in
juries. Rintala twisted his ankle in
the first minute of play in the Santa
Clara upset two weeks ago, and l'or a
while it was thought that he would
be forced to adorn the bench for the
remainder of the 1929 season.
The varsity will start practicing
next week as though it were begin
ning the season anew. Light signal
sessions are in store for the first
couple of days, and the practices will
continue to get stiffer until just prior
to the 2Sth. By so doing, Coach War
ner expects to get the players back
to the peak of condition. As Pop will
not return from his Eastern scouting
tour until the end of next week, As
sistant Coaches Tiny Thornhill and
Chuck Winterburn will have charge
of the team during the initial work
outs. â€¢
