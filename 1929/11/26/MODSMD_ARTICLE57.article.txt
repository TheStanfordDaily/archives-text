# STANFORD VICTORY GIVES FANS FOOD FOR THOUGHT AS THANKSGIVING CLASHES LOOM
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 25 (/P).—
Over the peak of a great football season,
Pacific Coast Conference teams relaxed
today while Far Western fandom back
tracked the trail of a schedule cluttered
with many upsets, spectacular victories,
and unusually large crowds.
Promised outstanding treats for their
Thanksgiving Day gridiron menu next
Thursday, the football mob, to the last
man, woman, and child, however, could
scarce do aught else than hark back to
last Saturday's bang-up finish when Stan
ford's Cardinals soundly trounced Cali
fornia, 21-6, to scatter the conference
championship hopes of the previously un
defeated Bears all over the Stanford Sta
dium.
Bears Crushed
Primed for their first title since 1923
and flushed with the confidence that four
previous conference victories had built
up, the Bears met their Waterloo in the
final clash of the year. California had
defeated Southern California, 15-7, a
week after Southern California had beat
out Stanford, 7-0. One week ago last
Saturday, a fighting Santa Clara team
had trounced the Stanford aggregation,
13-7.
While Stanford was knocking Califor

nia's hopes "galley west" last week-end,
Southern California cycloned over a weak
Idaho team to win by a 72-0 score. Wash
ington State and Oregon romped away
with non-conference rivals, the former
defeating Gonzaga, 27-0, and Oregon nos
ing out a visiting University of Hawaii
eleven, 7-0.
Turkey Day Clashes
Thanksgiving Day tilts will bring to
gether the University of California at
Los Angeles Bruins and Montana's Griz
zlies in a conference game at Los Angeles
while St. Mary's will entertain Oregon
at San Francisco., A victory for either
Montana or U.C.L.A. should be the cause
of much merrymaking on the respective
campuses as neither team has won a con
ference game this season. However,
Montana held Washington to a 6-6 tie
early in the season. The St. Mary's-Ore
gon encounter assumes the importance of
a big conference engagement because St.
Mary's is the only major team in the
country that has not been scored upon.
The only blot on an otherwise perfect
record for St. Mary's is a scoreless tie
with California's Bears and the Bears
were fortunate to escape unscathed on
that day, October 5 last. The Bears were
on the defensive most of that game.

a big conference engagement because St.
Mary's is the only major team in the
country that has not been scored upon.
The only blot on an otherwise perfect
record for St. Mary's is a scoreless tie
with California's Bears and the Bears
were fortunate to escape unscathed on
that day, October 5 last. The Bears were
on the defensive most of that game.
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 25 (/P).—
Over the peak of a great football season,
Pacific Coast Conference teams relaxed
today while Far Western fandom back
tracked the trail of a schedule cluttered
with many upsets, spectacular victories,
and unusually large crowds.
Promised outstanding treats for their
Thanksgiving Day gridiron menu next
Thursday, the football mob, to the last
man, woman, and child, however, could
scarce do aught else than hark back to
last Saturday's bang-up finish when Stan
ford's Cardinals soundly trounced Cali
fornia, 21-6, to scatter the conference
championship hopes of the previously un
defeated Bears all over the Stanford Sta
dium.
Bears Crushed
Primed for their first title since 1923
and flushed with the confidence that four
previous conference victories had built
up, the Bears met their Waterloo in the
final clash of the year. California had
defeated Southern California, 15-7, a
week after Southern California had beat
out Stanford, 7-0. One week ago last
Saturday, a fighting Santa Clara team
had trounced the Stanford aggregation,
13-7.
While Stanford was knocking Califor

nia's hopes "galley west" last week-end,
Southern California cycloned over a weak
Idaho team to win by a 72-0 score. Wash
ington State and Oregon romped away
with non-conference rivals, the former
defeating Gonzaga, 27-0, and Oregon nos
ing out a visiting University of Hawaii
eleven, 7-0.
Turkey Day Clashes
Thanksgiving Day tilts will bring to
gether the University of California at
Los Angeles Bruins and Montana's Griz
zlies in a conference game at Los Angeles
while St. Mary's will entertain Oregon
at San Francisco., A victory for either
Montana or U.C.L.A. should be the cause
of much merrymaking on the respective
campuses as neither team has won a con
ference game this season. However,
Montana held Washington to a 6-6 tie
early in the season. The St. Mary's-Ore
gon encounter assumes the importance of
a big conference engagement because St.
Mary's is the only major team in the
country that has not been scored upon.
