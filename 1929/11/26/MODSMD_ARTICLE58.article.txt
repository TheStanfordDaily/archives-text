# STUDENT GLIDER CLUB ESTABLISHED BY P.A. SCHOOL OF AVIATION
## 
### 
In order to give Stanford students in
terested in aviation an opportunity to be
come acquainted with gliders, Lieutenant
Norman A. Goddard, Palo Alto School
of Aviation head, is planning to organize
a Glider Club.
Plans, specifications, and materials for
the building of a glider have all been ob
tained. The construction is to be carried
on by the club members under Lieutenant
Goddard's direction. It is planned to give
club members a few hours' instruction in
the flying school's Waco biplane in order
to avoid all possible risk in the operation
of the glider.
The date of the first meeting of the
club, which will probably be some time
next week, will be announced later. All
students who are interested are requested
to get in touch with Mrs. Goddard at the
local aviation school as soon as possible,
in order that construction of the glider
may start at an early date.
