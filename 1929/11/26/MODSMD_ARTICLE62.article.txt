# BETAS, KAPPA SIGS ARE UNDEFEATED IN INTRAMURAL LEAGUE
## Ancient 'Dead Man' End Play Highlight As Sigma Chi Beats Phi Psi's, 13-0 
### 
A lateral pass, Teague to White,
which netted twenty yards and a
touchdown, enabled Beta Theta Pi to
defeat Delta Chi 6-0 in a hard-fought
intramural football contest yesterday
afternoon. The Betas will meet Kappa
Sigma tomorrow in the deciding game
of their league, as neither team has
been defeated.
Combining line bucks, end runs, and
passes with telling effect, Alpha Delta
Phi smothered Delta Upsilon 31-7. The
D.U.'s one score was made by Cooper
who ran thirty yards after receiving
a pass.
The well-known "sleeper" play,
also known as the "shoestring" play,
wherein an end lies down along one
sideline and then comes to life to re
ceive a pass, provided one touchdown
as Sigma Chi defeated Phi Kappa Psi i
13-0. Goldwater intercepted a pasa and '
ran thirty-five yards to make the j
other score.
Alpha Kappa Lambda defeated j
Alpha Sigma Phi 14-0 in a game to '
decide the cellar occupants of their
league. The "shoestring" play also fea- ;
tured in this game, the second A.K.L. '
score coming after a pass from Bugg !
to Whitesel on the sidelines.
The Pavilion Independents, replac
ing El Cuadro which dropped out of j
intramural football, showed their
gratitude by smearing Phi Sigma
Kappa 26-7. The Phi Sig's had two
opportunities to score in the fourth
quarter, but messed them up with i
fumbles and bad passes.
A forfeit by Alpha Tau Omega >
cinched their league for Phi Kappa
Sigma.
