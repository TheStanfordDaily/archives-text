# PHI BETA KAPPA TO VOTE TODAY ON NEW MEMBERS OF GROUPS
## Juniors May Be Admitted To Organization According To Recent Ruling 
### 
The electorate of Phi Beta Kappa will
meet at 3 o'clock today in room 11 of
the Law building to vote on candidates
for the society, according to Louis Vin
centi, student member of the executive
council of Phi Beta Kappa.
In electing members this year the Stan
ford chapter will incorporate several im
portant changes. Juniors may be eligible
for membership; a newly organized ex
ecutive council is in charge of nomina
tions and other administrative work; a
definite bawl-out average is required,
while at the same time participation in
activities and breadth of scholastic inter
est are considered.
According to the by-laws of the Stan
ford chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, juniors
are eligible to nomination and election
who (1) have completed units totaling
115-134 inclusive, (2) who have com
pleted University residence of at least
three quarters, and (3) whose grade point
average is at least 2.4, or B plus. Seniors
arc eligible to nomination with a grade
point average of 2.0 or more, at least a
B average, in 135 or more units.
Phi Beta Kappa holds two elections
each year, autumn and spring quarters.
The total number admitted during the
academic year is equal to 10 per cent of
the number of A.B. degrees given out
the year before. No member can be
elected without the required scholastic
average, but a person may be given pref
erence over another with a higher record
by reason of prominence in activities or
scholastic interest.
The executive council is composed of
the five faculty officers of Phi Beta Kap
pa and four aditional members, at least
two of whom must be students. This
year three are students. Eligible candi
dates are nominated by a two-thirds vote
of the executive council, and are elected
by a three-fourths vote of the active mem
bers present at the meeting.
