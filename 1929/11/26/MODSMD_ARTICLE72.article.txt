# PALO ALTO BIG TREE NOT "BIG TREE" AFTER ALL BUT COAST REDWOOD, SAYS COL. WHITE
## 
### Ruth Miner 
That the Palo Alto Big Tree is not
a Big Tree at all, but that it will live
indefinitely, is the opinion of Colonel
John R. White, superintendent of Se
quoia and General Grant National
Parks, who spoke last night at the
University Press reception in his
honor.
"Instead of the concrete stopping
them, the roots of the Stanford tree
have penetrated so far that they wiil
push straight through the concrete.
The dead boughs projecting out should
be cut off," said the superintendent,
who has written the book "Big Trees."
"The real California Big Tree (Se
quoia gigantea) is not the same as
the Coast Redwood (Sequoia seraper
virens), to which species the Stanford
tree belongs."
War Veteran
Colonel White, an Englishman, first
served in the Foreign Legion in the
Greco-Turkish war. Then as a result
of fifteen years in the Philippine con
stabulary, he wrote the biography,
"Bullets and Bolos." He also saw ser

vice in the World War, and since then
has been connected with National
Parks.
Although he is familiar with many
national parks, White believes Se
quoia to be the finest.
"From a living point of view, and
from an interest standpoint, there is
nothing to compare with Sequoia. As
well as having the largest tree in the
United States, it has the greatest
range in altitude, with Mt. Whitney,
14,496 feet, the highest mountain in
the United States."
Sequoia Big Place
"Why, if you were to take all the
groves in the United States, and drop
them into Sequoia Park," he said, "no
one but a ranger would know they
were there."
In connection with Secretary of the
Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur's project
of increasing the educational features
of the National Parks, vocational op
portunities for trained educated men
are broadening; those who have a
bent for outdoor study will find ample
work as young rangers and natural
ists, he said.

have penetrated so far that they wiil
push straight through the concrete.
The dead boughs projecting out should
be cut off," said the superintendent,
who has written the book "Big Trees."
"The real California Big Tree (Se
quoia gigantea) is not the same as
the Coast Redwood (Sequoia seraper
virens), to which species the Stanford
tree belongs."
War Veteran
Colonel White, an Englishman, first
served in the Foreign Legion in the
Greco-Turkish war. Then as a result
of fifteen years in the Philippine con
stabulary, he wrote the biography,
"Bullets and Bolos." He also saw ser

vice in the World War, and since then
has been connected with National
Parks.
Although he is familiar with many
national parks, White believes Se
quoia to be the finest.
"From a living point of view, and
from an interest standpoint, there is
nothing to compare with Sequoia. As
well as having the largest tree in the
United States, it has the greatest
range in altitude, with Mt. Whitney,
14,496 feet, the highest mountain in
the United States."
Sequoia Big Place
"Why, if you were to take all the
groves in the United States, and drop
them into Sequoia Park," he said, "no
one but a ranger would know they
were there."
In connection with Secretary of the
Interior Ray Lyman Wilbur's project
of increasing the educational features
of the National Parks, vocational op
portunities for trained educated men
are broadening; those who have a
bent for outdoor study will find ample
work as young rangers and natural
ists, he said.
