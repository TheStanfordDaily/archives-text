VALETTA, Malta, Nov. 25. (/P)â€”
The wireless operator on the British
steamer Baron Echo, who started four
destroyers rushing to his aid when
he sent out SOS calls last Thursday
saying an attempt was being made to
murder him, has been removed in cus
tody to the destroyer Witch.
The master of the Baron Elcho said
the operator still maintained every
body was trying to poison him. He
was found last night hiding in a
ventilator.
The Witch, with the three other
destroyers that answered the SOS
calls, headed back to Malta.
