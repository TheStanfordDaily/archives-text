NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov. 25. (/p)â€”
The famous fence, Yale's treasured
relic of bygone days, was back in its
home city today. Missing since the
day of the Yale-Princeton game, the
fence was shipped from Cambridge,
Mass., after its appearance at ban
quet of the Harvard Lampoon Friday
night, and arrived at the local office
of the railway express agency early
today.
