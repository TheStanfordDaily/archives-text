## Bristow Adams, '00, Chosen National Fraternity Honorary Head 
### Kenneth Mansfield 
(Stanford Delegate to Sigma
Delta Chi Convention)
Bristow Adams, '00, founder of
Chaparral and professor of journalism
at Cornell, was elected national hon
orary president of Sigma Delta Chi,
professional journalistic fraternity, at
the closing session of the fraternity
convention held at the University of
Missouri last week. Edwin O'Neill,
secretary for the past year, was
elected national president, and Walter
Humphrey, alumni secretary for the
closing period, was raised to the na
tional secretaryship.
Among the prominent newspaper
men who gave talks at the convention
was Carl Bickel, president of the
United Press and a Stanford graduate.
puring the course of the conven
tion the fraternity passed a resolution
calling on alumni chapters in the
various states to take action to secure
a greater freedom of press criticism
by sponsoring legislation to bar
judges from sitting at the trial of
editors whom they cite for contempt
of court for editorial attack on the
decision of the judge concerned.
From the sentiment expressed at
the convention, further development
in the alumni field may be expected
during the year with a tendency to
ward a stronger professional organiza
tion, in many repects resembling the
British Institute of Journalists, one
of the outstanding editorial guilds of
the world.
lowa State and Ohio State colleges
divided the honors of the convention.
The former was awarded the annual
chapter efficiency trophy, while the
latter secured the sanction of the
delegates for the 1930 convention at
Columbus, Ohio.
Following investigation in commit
tee, Temple University in Philadel
phia was granted a national chapter,
and its representative initiated into
the fraternity by the Missouri chapter.
