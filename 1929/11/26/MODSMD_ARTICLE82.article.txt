# KEHR SPEAKS ON ART OF CHINESE DYNASTIES AT GALLERY LECTURE
## 
### 
"The art of every country corre
sponds with its history," declared Mr.
Frederick Kehr, of Palo Alto, speak
ing before the Art Department of the
San Jose Women's Club in the Art
Gallery yesterday afternoon. Kehr
spoke on Chinese Art and used his
own collection, now on exhibition in
the gallery, to illustrate his state
ments.
"The Tang dynasty is representa
tive of the finest of Chinese art and
it was at this time that China was
the most powerful country in the
world," Kehr pointed out. "The art
of this period is very forceful in line
and shows a widespread Byzantine in
fluence.
"One of the old religious paintings
which represents Buddah sitting in a
cloud, holding an elongated ear in one
hand —to show all-powerful hearing,
and his left eyebrow in the other il
lustrating all-powerful sight — is a
good example of Byzantine influence,
according to Kehr, "as the features of
the immortals in the painting appear
more African than Chinese."
The Sung dynasty is important in
its detail work which is shown in its
incomparable porcelain and pottery.
The Sung blue is especially renowned
and has never been reproduced. A
small statue of a standing boy was
given as an exceptional example of
the Sung blue.
