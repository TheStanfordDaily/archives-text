# FLUORESCENT AUTO OILS AID EXPERIMENT IN SPECTRA PHOTOS
## 
### 
Oil stocks go up another ten
points!
Another use for petroleum prod
ucts has been discovered by Dr. P.
A. Leighton, of the chemistry de
partment, who has been using or
dinary automobile lubricating oil in
his work on light rays so far be
low the range of vision that even
a camera plate will not register
them. The oil has properties of
fluorescence which accentuate the
wave-length of light projected
through it, so that photographic re
sults of the spcctra can be obtained,
according to Leighton.
He pointed out that these rays
are next-door neighbors to the X
rays, which penetrate almost any
thing, while the extreme ultra-vio
let will not even penetrate the air.
Consequently, work with light in
this range must be done in vac
uum spectrographs.
