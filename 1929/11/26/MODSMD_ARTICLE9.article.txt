### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Nov. 25 (#).—
The desires of dozens of communities—
small and large—to be on the air mail
map of the United States were laid before
the interdepartmental committee on air
ways today in a hearing on proposals for
a second transcontinental route.
Towns and states of the Southwest
which would be served by the line were
grouped as entire Congressional delega
tions appeared to plead the causes of
their sections; and in addition business
and civic representatives sought consid
eration of individual towns.
