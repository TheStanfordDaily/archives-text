# COAST FOOTBALL CHAMPS MAY BE CHOSEN BY P.C.C.
## Present Four-Cornered Tie Necessitates Arbitrary Choice of Team 
### 
That the Pacific Coast Conference
at its meeting December 1G in San
Francisco will arbitrarily name a
football championship team for the
1929 season, or else take action to
ward more definite determination of
championships in the future, was the
forecast of Professor W. B. Owens of
Stanford, president of the conference,
in a statement issued yesterday.
If a champion is not arbitrarily
chosen at the meeting the title will
probably be left undecided in a four
cornered tie between Oregon, Stan
ford, California, and U.S.C. or Wash
ington State, Owens said. At the pres
ent time all five of the above colleges
are tied with one defeat apiece, but
U.S.C. and Washington State will play
each other next Saturday, and unless
a tie is the result one of them will be
eliminated.
President Owens stated that the
conference rules take no cognizance
of percentage in determining the
championship, specifying only lhat a
team must play four conference games
to be eligible for the title. Owens ex
pressed himself as in favor of amend
ing the rules to cover cases similar
to the one now existing.
"I feel that the rules should cover
the point and that they will be
amended to do so," he declared.
Under the percentage system a vic
tory Saturday would give U.S.C. the
title since the Trojans will have
played seven games with only one de
feat, giving them a better rating than
Stanford's six games with one loss or
California's four wins to one defeat.
