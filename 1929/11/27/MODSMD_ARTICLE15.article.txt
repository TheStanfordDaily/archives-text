# CHINA SEEKS LEAGUE HELP IN RUSS WAR
## Asks That Soviet Forces In Manchuria Be Halted And Punished 
### Associated Press 
Her armed forces in western Man
churia scattered, in panic condition,
before the invading Russian troops,
China appealed today both to the
League of Nations and to governments
that signed the Kellogg anti-war pact
to halt and punish the invaders.
Simultaneously, China apparently
was trying to come to terms with the
Kuominchun "People's Army" leaders
who for several weeks have led their
troops in several provinces in revolt
against the Nationalist government.
The fact that fighting between the
Kuominchun and Nationalists had
ceased in central China was cited as
corroborative of reports that Presi
dent Chiang Kai-shek and other offi
cials were endeavoring to unite all
factions of China against the foreign
foe.
But In South China, the rebels of
Kwansi province continued active, and
upon their border city of Wuchow a
Nationalist airplane squadron dropped
bombs, killing many, terrorizing the
people, and causing heavy property
damage.
The rich Manchurian area of 363,700
square miles, often the prize for which
opposing nations fought, today was
again a great battleground, with Rus
sia and China striving for control and
operation of the Chinese Eastern
Railway.
