# DUEL SCENE FEATURE OF 1929 SOPHOMORE DRAMA, 'COCK ROBIN'
## 
### 
When Hancock Robinson, victim of
the murder which is the theme of
"Cock Robin," the approaching sopho
more play, refuses to play opposite
Dicky Lane in a duel scene of the
performance they are rehearsing,
Dickie is naturally the one on whom
suspicion falls after the murder, par
ticularly since it is known that he
had had an affair with Carlotta, who
is about to elope with Robinson.
The part of Lane will be taken by
Ernest Mendenhall; and that of Han
cock Robinson, who, on account of the
former's alcoholic habits and grudge
against him, threatens to leave the
company unless someone else plays
opposite him in the duel scene, will
be taken by John Huneke, Lane,
whose reputation as an erring shot
strengthens the suspicion against
him, was once very close to being
engaged to Carlotta Maxwell, whose
part will be taken by Elizabeth Erlin.
After the duel scene has been changed
so that Lane is off stage, and another,
Clarke Torrence, to be played by
Harry Logan, is opposite Robinson,
the plot thickens with the discovery
that Lane is helping the stage man
ager with off-stage shots.
In fact, circumstances point alarm
ingly straight at Dickie Lane. But cir
cumstance has many fingers in "Cock
Robin," all pointing in different direc
tions. It looks as bad for others of
these amateur actors as it doe 3 for
Lane. Someone remembers something
that clears this one, or implicates
that one. Each one suspects everyone
else; some want to call the police,
others do not. In fact, it is all quite
a mess until the final blow-up smashes
everything, rebuilds new motives, and
springs a complete surprise.
