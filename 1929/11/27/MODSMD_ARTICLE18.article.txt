$346,000 To Go
According to the minutes, as read
by Katherine Keho, secretary, the
funds at present amount to approxi
mately $4000, raised on the campus
last year. A resolution was passed to
put this money out at interest, the
investment to be left to the discre
tion of A. E. Roth, Comptroller.
Practically the entire meeting was
devoted to a discussion of possible
means of raising the $350,000, which
is the estimated cost of the theatre.
Although no definite action was taken,
the committee seemed to be generally
agreed that a good part of this must
be raised on the campus before out
side aid could be sought.
At the first of the meeting acknowl
edgement was made of a pledge of
$100 from Ellwood Cubberley, head
of the Education department.
Committee members include: John
E. McDowell, alumni secretary; John

Quarter; Harold Helvenston, Director
of Dramatics; Nelson Carter, chair
man; Katherine Keho, secretary; Bur
nell Gould, Merle Emry, Donald Flet
cher, Ralph Campiglia, and Alfred
