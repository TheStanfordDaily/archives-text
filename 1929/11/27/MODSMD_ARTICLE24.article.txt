# DISCUSSION OF PLANS FOR INTERFRATERNITY DANCE PROGRAM SOON
## 
### 
Discussion of plans for an inter
fraternity dance was the object of
the Intel-fraternity Council meeting
last night in the Y.M.C.A. lobby in
the Old Union. The meeting was called
to order by "Bingo" Grant, secretary,
in the absence of the president, Scott
Webster, who has gone to New York
to attend the National Interfraternity
Convention.
Phil Brooks, head of the dance com
mittee, explained the purpose of the
dance and the obstacles in the way of
successfully carrying it through. All
profit realized will be distributed
among the various houses in repay
ment of the money which they were
assessed to pay for the expenses of
the Stanford delegate to the National
Convention.
Because of the size of the dance it
will be necessary to hold it off the
campus. Dean Culver has given per
mission if the houses will not hold
individual off-campus dances for two
years. Brooks asked the presidents to
bring the matter up before their
houses and report to the Council sec
retary not later than Wednesday, De
cember 4, if the house is opposed to
the idea.
It is planned to hold the dance to
ward the last of January and the bids
will sell for about three dollars, the
price depending on the number that
plan to attend. Co-operation of the
fraternities was stressed and a large
number must attend if the dance is
to be a success.
