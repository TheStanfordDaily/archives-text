# Jordan Able To Take Part In Thanksgiving Festivities
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan is looking forward to en
joying a little turkey at the family
Thanksgiving dinner to be held at the
Jordan home Thursday.
Mrs. Jordan assured a Daily report
er yesterday that Dr. Jordan was con
sistently holding his own, and that
the condition of his health continued
to be very comforting. He is still con
fined to his bed the greater part of
the day, but not even the increased
coolness of the weather keeps him
from spending an hour each morning
in his garden.
