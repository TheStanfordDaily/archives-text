# CAMPUS WRITERS MAKE ALL-COAST GRID SELECTIONS
## Captain Muller, Heinecke, and Smalling Are the Choices For Mythical Coast Eleven Tandy Recognized as One of Season's Most Dependable Tackles; Stress Steadiness 
### 
Player Position
Muller, Stanford End
Tappaan, U.S.C. End

Smalling, Stanford Fullback
Going the way of all flesh, the Daily
today committed itself by producing
the above all-Coast team, which it
fondly believes to represent the cream
of the season's gridiron crop on the
Pacific Slope. The team is the com
posite selection of seven men, all of
whom are either members of the
Daily staff or campus correspondents
for city newspapers, who had seen all
the men in action at least once.
All For Muller
Ends —Captain Muller of Stanford
was the unanimous choice of the se
lectors for one wing position, on the
basis of his consistent play all sea
son, climaxed by his great exhibition
against California. For the same rea
son, consistency, Tappaan of Southern
California was named as Muller's run
ning mate over Norton of California,
who marred an otherwise great year
by a poor showing against Stanford.
Tackles —Tandy of Stanford and
Schwegler of Washington topped a
list of tackles that contained no reallj>
outstanding men, although Ackerman
of St. Mary's and Colbert and Ohris
tensen of Oregon drew their share of
votes.
Guards —Captain Barrager of U.S.C.
was almost a unanimous choice for
one guard position, but opinion was
nearly evenly divided for the other
post between Shields of Oregon and
Schwarz of California, with the latter
finally winning out because he did
splendid work in a line that, for all
Its strength, was weaker than the
California forward wall.
Heinecke Unanimous
Center — Heinecke was another
unanimous choice at his position, al
though all conceded that it was only
on his showing against California
that he beat out Captain RLegeia of
the Bears, who played brilliant foot
ball all through the season, only to
bow to the consistent Heinle last Sat
urday.
Quarterback —Duffield and Saun
ders, both of Southern California,
were the leading quarterback candi
dates, with the Santa Monica blond
getting the choice because of his
ability to do everything Saunders can
do and play safety as well. Elsan of
California also came in for considera
tion.
Hufford Chosen
Halfbacks —With the high caliber
of the halfbacks on Pacific Coast
teams this year, it is a tribute to Huf
ford of Washington that all but one
of the teams carried his name. The
Husky flash was the backbone of a
weak team, equally adept at kicking,
passing, running the ends, or smash
ing the center of the line. Lom of
California, although he failed to show
.to an advantage against Stanford, was
the keyman of the Bear offense
against every other team, and was
named to flank Hufford, although Mof
fatt of Stanford, Stennett of St.
Mary's, and Pinckert of U.S.C. had
their supporters.

Lorn, California Halfback
Hufford, Washington Halfback
Smalling, Stanford Fullback
Going the way of all flesh, the Daily
today committed itself by producing
the above all-Coast team, which it
fondly believes to represent the cream
of the season's gridiron crop on the
Pacific Slope. The team is the com
posite selection of seven men, all of
whom are either members of the
Daily staff or campus correspondents
for city newspapers, who had seen all
the men in action at least once.
All For Muller
Ends —Captain Muller of Stanford
was the unanimous choice of the se
lectors for one wing position, on the
basis of his consistent play all sea
son, climaxed by his great exhibition
against California. For the same rea
son, consistency, Tappaan of Southern
California was named as Muller's run
ning mate over Norton of California,
who marred an otherwise great year
by a poor showing against Stanford.
Tackles —Tandy of Stanford and
Schwegler of Washington topped a
list of tackles that contained no reallj>
outstanding men, although Ackerman
of St. Mary's and Colbert and Ohris
tensen of Oregon drew their share of
votes.
Guards —Captain Barrager of U.S.C.
was almost a unanimous choice for
one guard position, but opinion was
nearly evenly divided for the other
post between Shields of Oregon and
Schwarz of California, with the latter
finally winning out because he did
splendid work in a line that, for all
Its strength, was weaker than the
California forward wall.
Heinecke Unanimous
Center — Heinecke was another
unanimous choice at his position, al
though all conceded that it was only
on his showing against California
that he beat out Captain RLegeia of
the Bears, who played brilliant foot
ball all through the season, only to
bow to the consistent Heinle last Sat
urday.
Quarterback —Duffield and Saun
ders, both of Southern California,
were the leading quarterback candi
dates, with the Santa Monica blond
getting the choice because of his
ability to do everything Saunders can
do and play safety as well. Elsan of
California also came in for considera
tion.
Hufford Chosen
Halfbacks —With the high caliber
of the halfbacks on Pacific Coast
teams this year, it is a tribute to Huf
ford of Washington that all but one
of the teams carried his name. The
Husky flash was the backbone of a
weak team, equally adept at kicking,
passing, running the ends, or smash
ing the center of the line. Lom of
California, although he failed to show
.to an advantage against Stanford, was
the keyman of the Bear offense
against every other team, and was
named to flank Hufford, although Mof
fatt of Stanford, Stennett of St.
Mary's, and Pinckert of U.S.C. had
their supporters.
