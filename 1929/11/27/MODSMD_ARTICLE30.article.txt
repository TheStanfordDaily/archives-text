# BRISBANE—MOUTHPIECE OF HEARST
## 
### 
Mr. Arthur Brisbane, mouthpiece of William Randolph Hearst, took
occasion yesterday morning to extol again the superior qualities of air
planes as man-killing devices. Aircraft, according to the philosopher of
the yellow journals, make all other engines of destruction seem puny
things.
On one hand Mr. Brisbane enumerates the killing capacities of the
flying machine; on the other hand he sends up a never-ceasing cry for a
greater air force.
Mr. Brisbane's theory of peace is that if every nation were bristling
with arms, soldiery, and death dealing airplanes, then every nation would
be afraid to engage in conflict with another. That theory is not new. Men
have been employing it through the ages, and through the ages men have
killed and slaughtered without end. No, Mr. Brisbane, it won't work. It
is as valid as that foolish cry—"A war to end war."
As long as the nations of the world are laboring under the yoke of
armaments; as long as men like Arthur Brisbane look with suspicion upon
every move made toward disarmament—as long as these things continue
we are constantly menaced by the horrid specter of war. Ideas such as
are promulgated by this Hearst minion defeat the peace hopes of men of
intelligence and vision.
