# "IT IS ACTION THAT COUNTS"

"Words are not of any great importance in times of economic disturb
ance. It is action that counts." With this terse statement made, President
Hoover is once again at work on a "big job."
"The next practical step is the organizing and co-ordinating of a for
ward movement of business through the revival of construction activity,
the stimulation of exports and of other legitimate business expansion.
"Any lack of confidence in the economic future ... of the United
States is foolish."
Claiming that recent market reversals were brought about by over
optimism which soon turned to over-pessimism, Hoover has launched stu
pendous plans for a program which will stir to activity the now-drowsy
giant, American capital. The scope of the President's proposals HAS
stirred the business world. Four group conferences have been arranged
between leading railroad men, industrial and financial magnates, husband
men, and laboring groups.
It is suggested that one purpose of the President's conference is to
flash before the public eye such unrelated expansion programs as a $75,-
000,000 road project in lowa, a $2,000,000 shipbuilding scheme, a billion
dollar telephone development plan, and a billion-dollar waterway improve
ment proposal.
Hopeful that states, municipalities, railroads, and industries would
follow suit, Hoover has ordered government departments to resume all
halted public works under their jurisdiction.
Relief ventures are not novelties in the scope of Hoover enterprise.
One quickly recalls the ease with which Hoover administered aid to war
torn Belgium during the cloudy days of the World War.
As weeks swing by and added impetus to the President's program is
gained, a distinct "forward movement of business" can be anticipated.
