"SWEETlE"—Varsity Theatre.
Individual performances make this
silly picture worth seeing. Helen Kane
and Jack Oakie, two future stars, run
away with the show. Their clowning,
singing, and dancing are a joy not to
be missed.
The story is so impossible that one
is inclined to call it a satire. It's an
other of those Hollywood college af
fairs with the fighting football finish.
Nancy Carroll is a chorus girl who
inherits a boys' school. She takes ac
tive charge in order to put the foot
ball captain, who is the hero, in his
proper place for postponing their
wedding.
Miss Carroll is one hundred per
cent, as usual. She and the idealistic
captain, Stanley Smith, coo a tender
theme song, "Sweeter Than Sweet,"
at many opportune moments.
At least the eventful touchdown is
won in a novel manner. Helen Kane
carries her trusty pop-gun to the
bleachers with her. When all else has
failed she wins the game for dear old
Pelham by shooting her dumb football
lover in the seat of the pants. The im
petus puts him across the goal line.
Miss Kane sings "Oh, He's So Un
usual!" and"I Think You'll Like It,"
in her very own boop-oopa-doop man
ner. And if you haven't heard Helen
pup-up-a-dup you're missing one of
life's greatest moments. She is excel
lent. Better in the talkies thau on
your victrola or radio.
Jack Oakie is a new comedian who
is fast and clever. His rendition of
"Alma Mammy" is an inspiration to
Stanford song-writers. Perhaps it will
inspire an improvement in our school
songs.
William Austin is funny as the
is a riot as Axel, Helen Kane's shot-at
headmaster, and a dumb-looking blond
sweetie. "Sweetie" is a lot of baloney,
but its laughs make up for its story.

MOTHER AND SON, By Kathleen
Norris. E. P. Dutton & Co., New
York. 1929.
After ploughing through the pon
derous pennings of some of the latest
gifts to modern literature, it is a true
pleasure to get back to one of our
old favorites. Mrs. Norris, with her
charming informality, her quietness,
and her rare good taste, will always
be represented on our bookshelf.
"Mother and Son," one of her latest,
is of the short but sweet type. Not
short enough to be casual, nor sweet

enough to be saccharine, it contains a
note that will make some sons smile
complacently, and others —the erring
ones —feel like big bums.
Freshmen will say—"Oh, I'll never
be like that!" Sophomores will take
it —"Of course, there are such peo
ple." For the juniors—"Ouch!" And
the seniors—"Now, in the future, I'll
do thus-and-so."
Don't read this book to discover a
soul-stirring message that will turn
the world over in half a day. If there's
one there, you'll undoubtedly be too
busy to utilize it. But it's the kind of
book you want to read just before
Christmas —awfully good for your va
cation, and your sense of importance.

THE NO-NATION GIRL, by Evans
Wall. The Century Co., New York.
1929.
Precieuse, daughter of a black
mother and a white father, acquired
from this union traits that made her
the most savage, the most glamorous,
the most desired woman in the Loui
siana bayous.
Not white, not black —a no-nation
girl—she declined with no particular
grace the advances of every man she
met, until three collegians on a spree
come into the swamps. One, Cliff, at
tracts her, and when he comes back
to the swamps again, she flees to him
from another of her too-demonstrative
suitors.
The two of them, Precieuse and
Cliff, swing their destinies together.
Supremely happy at first, while she
seems endowed with the characteris
tics of her white father, the pair set
tle down to life in the bayou. But as
Precieuse grows visibly older, her
negro blood shows —her delicate fea
tures vanish, as do her more delicate
scruples—and she and her man reach
the break.
The story goes rapidly to its tragic
end, leaving an exceeding bad taste
in the reader's mouth. "The No-Nation
Girl" is not a literary epic; the au
thor tried to catch the primitive lust
and passion of the uncivilized black
in his book, and failed. Shooting for
so high a goal, and missing, makes
some of the incidents rather —well,
foul.
At times there are occasional touch
es of blood-curdling realism that do
not cause the reader to rebel. Good
as they may be, they are too few
in number to remedy the numerous
defects elsewhere. —O. S.
