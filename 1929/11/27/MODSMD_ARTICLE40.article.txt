# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO, NOVEMBER 27, 1904 
### 
The agreement between Stanford
and California that only graduate
coaches were to be employed by the
universities, was to expire on Decem
ber 31, and was to come up for dis
cussion by an intercollegiate commit
tee sometime in January. The rule
that the head football coach should
be a graduate of the university had
been in existence since 1900, but Stan
ford's crushing victory over the Bears
on November 12 had caused the Cali
fornia officials to desire the abandon
ment of the rule.
At present, strangely enough, the
entire California coaching staff is
composed of Berkeley graduates from
"Nibs" Price down to "Brick" Mit
chell.
The victorious varsity returned

from the Thanksgiving Day game with
Colorado at Denver. A large crowd
of rooters met the team at the Palo
Alto station and hauled the members
to their homes in a tally-ho.
College Notes: The seniors recently
won the class football championship
at Harvard.
Well, that's something.
W. H. B. Fowler, '06, was the only
nominee for the editorship of the
Daily Palo Alto for the coming semes
ter and President Dibble of the stu
dent body announced that the elec
tion was to take place on the follow
ing Wednesday.
Fowler was formally elected editor
and at present is the editor of the
San Francisco Chronicle.
