# TURKEY GETS LEAD IN ANNUAL GAIETIES FOR HOLIDAY FEAST
## 
### 
Turkey at 45 cents a pound
will play the leading role in the
1929 "Thanksgiving Gaieties" to
morrow, for Stanford students as
well as others. Cranberry sauce
and sweet potatoes will support
the lead, and it is hopefully ex
pected that there will be a finale
of pumpkin pie.
The dinner gaieties will be
followed by a three-day holiday
celebration. It has long been a
custom to hold feast days just
before some period of tribulation
and hardship, so Stanford stu
dents will return Monday to
study for finals.
