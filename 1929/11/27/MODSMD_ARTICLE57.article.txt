# Army Coach Scouts Card Games And Returns East
## 
### 
Through judicious use of a trans
continental air-rail route, Russel P.
Iteeder, assistant Army coach, has
been able to scout Stanford in three
games here and get back East in time
to make use of the information he
gleaned out there, an Associated Press
dispatch said yesterday. Army meets
Stanford at Palo Alto December 28.
