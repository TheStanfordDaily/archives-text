# SOPH HOCKEY SQUAD RUNS TRUE TO FORM TO BEAT SENIORS 9-1
## 
### 
True to dope, the soph hockey
eleven won their encounter yesterday
against the senior squad, 9 to 1. But
they disappointed their followers by
allowing the seniors to sneak a goal
in the first few minutes of playâ€”and
by ending a very ragged first half
with a score of 3 to 1. They came
back to a Warner finish in the last
half.
Seniors were better, in contrast,
during that first half, than in any
other game they have played so far.
Rosamund Clarke, Maxine Cushing,
and Elizabeth Woodyatt constituted
their main strength in the backfleld.
The sophomore eleven's forward
line was slightly under par yesterday,
but the backfield gave them the aid
they needed to place the nine goals.
Jane Snyder as left fullback was an
asset.
