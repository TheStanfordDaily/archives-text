Pipes!
PIPES and pants are mascu
line prerogatives that defend
themselves and us. Where else
could men find sanctuary?
Pipes, stout pipes, and packings
of good old Edgeworth—what per
fect expression of man's inviolable
right of refuge with other men
behind barriers of redolent smoke!
Tobacco with the whiskers on,
that's what man wants—good old
seasoned pipe -tobacco, the best
of the leaf, all blended and fla
vored and mellowed . . . Edge
worth, in short.
