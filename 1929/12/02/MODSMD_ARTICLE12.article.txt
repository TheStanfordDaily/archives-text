# CARD WOMEN DEBATE U.C. HERE TONIGHT
## Members of 500 to Defend Conventions in Clash With Cal Women 
### 
Adele McManus and Isabell Warren
will meet a University of California
women's debate team at 8 o'clock to
night in the Little Theatre in one of
the important women's debates of the
year. The Stanford team will sup
port the proposition, "Resolved, That
the breakdown of conventions is detri
mental to the youth of today." Oleta
O'Connor and Elizabeth Wilson of
California will attack the resolution.
Edith R. Mirrielees of the Stanford
English department will preside. At
the conclusion of the debate, Profes
sor William Hawley Davis, editor of
the University Press, will criticize the
arguments and oratorical style of the
four speakers. The audience will then
be permitted to discuss the topic and
question the debaters.
Adele McManus will make her de
but on the Stanford platform in this
contest, although she has had much
high school experience and did well
last week in the informal Wranglers-
Euphronia contest. Isabell Warren
appeared in debates with California
and U.S.C. last year.
The representatives of the two uni
versities and their managers will be
entertained at a dinner in the Union
before the debate tonight. Miss Edith
Mirrielees, Professor J. G. Emerson,
Professor W. H. Davis, and Ben Dun
niway, women's debate coach, will be
present as guests.
