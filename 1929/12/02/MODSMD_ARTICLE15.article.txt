# BAFFLING MURDER MYSTERY IS THEME OF 'COCK ROBIN;' SOPHOMORE PLAY
## 
### 
One of the most baffling mysteries |
of the 1929 stage is set forth and elu- j
cidated by Elmer Rice and Phillip j
Barry in "Cock Robin," the comedy to
be given by the sophomores Friday
night.
The murder takes place on the j
stage at a benefit performance, and |
without the aid of the police, the j
members of the company untangle the j
amazing mass of evidence and pin
the murder of Hancock Robinson —
who will be played by John Huneke — j
on the right person. With professional
shrewdness they see the importance !
of details. A broken jar on a shelf !
saves one man from being convicted
in this informal court. A torn sleeve j
acquits a second person and throws i
suspicion on a third. The opening of
a door implicates another.
In the midst of the investigation, (
someone has the brilliant idea of look-1
ing into the various pistols used in
the scene, both off-stage and on, to dis
cover which has been reloaded with

j real cartridges. This, again, changes
j the whole thing. A new person is in
! volved. And finally the question re
j solves itself into: Who removed the
blanks from that gun? And so on,
things get worse and worse, until fi
nally, like a clap of thunder, the per
| son least of all suspected is proven
I guilty.
j Maria, an assistant to the director
of the company, whose role will be
played by Patty Baker Friday night,
is the one who does the ' Sherlock
Holmes business. Her "photographic
j eye" enables her to reconstruct the
! entire scene, correct in the minutest
I detail. Putting everyone in his place,
] she directs the players through the
j duel scene again. Every movement
i in which the actors differed from the
! dress rehearsal is carefully gone
j through again. Every position a few
I inches from that usually taken at re
hearsals is a part of the picture in
Maria's head. Her reconstruction of
the duel scene proves to be surpris
, ingly valuable.
