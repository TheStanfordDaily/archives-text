# WILBUR DESIRES DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR CHANGE
## Secretary Informs Hoover In Annual Report of "Emphasis Change" 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. (/P)â€” Step
ping from the halls of Stanford Uni
versity into the Cabinet, Dr. Ilay Ly
man Wilbur, diagnostician and edu
cator, has informed his old friend,
President Hoover, that a "changing
emphasis" is the need of the big and
busy Interior Department.
Some of the great bureaus of the
department, he said in his annual re
port today, have oyertaken the peak
of their administrative load while
others have large tasks ahead for
completion. Emphasis, therefore, he
reasoned, should be transferred from
those whose duties are on the de
crease to those showing "constantly in
creasing fields of activity.
"From Nebraska west, water, and
water alone, is the key to our future.
Homestead thinking must be replaced
with watershed thinking. The West
will repeat the degradation of Korea
and parts of China with man-made
barrenness."
Of mineral resources, he said:
"Those expert in the field expect our
present volume of production to last
for less than a decade."
He added that the pro Mem of con
servation was far from a solution, and
admitted the department was baffled
in finding a key to the problem.
