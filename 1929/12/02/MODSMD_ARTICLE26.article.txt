# ARMY COMEBACK SPURS CARDS IN PRACTICE TODAY
## West Point's Great Showing Against Notre Dame Team Proof of Cadets' Power "Pop" to Return from East Thursday After Scouting Army; Varsity in Shape 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Spurred on by news of West Point's
great and wholly unexpected showing
against Knute Rockne's undefeated
Ramblers from South Bend, Coach
Pop Warner's big football varsity will
return to the practice field today to
work off the effects of a week's rest
enjoyed by the Cards following their
smashing upset of California's Glolden
Bear and to get back into fighting
trim for the Army clash on December
28.
As Pop is not scheduled to return
from the East, where he scouted the
Cadet-Irish game and is now selecting
an all-American team in collaboration
with three of his brother coaching
foxes, until Wednesday or Thursday,
the first few practice sessions of the
week will be directed by Tiny Thorn
hill and Chuck Winterburn. The ini
tial workouts will not be secret, being
of a light nature in order to get the
players back in shape once more.
Cards in Shape
All of the Redsliirts are in condi
tion as far as injuries are concerned,
the bruises, bumps, and batterings
sustained in the Cal game being com
pletely healed by this time. The only
possible exception is Rudy Rintala,
who is still slightly bothered with a
bad ankle twisted in the Santa Clara
encounter.
Although the future generals front
New York are not due to arrive on
the Farm until a week before the in
tersectional tilt, the white-jerseyed,
red-panted Warnermen are all anxious
to wrap their meat-hooks around the
piston-like legs of Red Cagle. For if
the Cards can stop Cagle, as they did
last fall, Stanford should not have
much trouble in coming out ahead
and thus bring its hectic 1929 season
of ups and downs to a successful
close.
Mule's Kick Potent
But the kick of the Army Mule is
quite likely to be much more potent
than the chaw and claw of the Berke
ley Bear, if Saturday's battle is any
indication to West Point's real
strength. The Cadets actually out
played Notre Dame during most of
the game, and the latter squad was
lucky to win on a fluke ninety-eight
yard run after an intercepted pass.
Cagle, as usual, tore off a couple of
sensational gains, while Johnny Mur
rell featured at fullback with his punt
ing, bucking, and hard tackling.
The only outstanding weakness of
the Army team was its passing attack.
West Point failed to complete a single
pass and a wild flip of the pigskin
turned out to be its downfall. How
ever, it must be remembered that the
game was played on a slippery trozen
field in an almost blizzard-like gale.
Coach Biff Jones expects his boys to
do better in this department against
Stanford, as the contest will probably
be played on a dry and speedy turf,
and as the Cards have a supposedly
notorious rusty pass defense.

an all-American team in collaboration
with three of his brother coaching
foxes, until Wednesday or Thursday,
the first few practice sessions of the
week will be directed by Tiny Thorn
hill and Chuck Winterburn. The ini
tial workouts will not be secret, being
of a light nature in order to get the
players back in shape once more.
Cards in Shape
All of the Redsliirts are in condi
tion as far as injuries are concerned,
the bruises, bumps, and batterings
sustained in the Cal game being com
pletely healed by this time. The only
possible exception is Rudy Rintala,
who is still slightly bothered with a
bad ankle twisted in the Santa Clara
encounter.
Although the future generals front
New York are not due to arrive on
the Farm until a week before the in
tersectional tilt, the white-jerseyed,
red-panted Warnermen are all anxious
to wrap their meat-hooks around the
piston-like legs of Red Cagle. For if
the Cards can stop Cagle, as they did
last fall, Stanford should not have
much trouble in coming out ahead
and thus bring its hectic 1929 season
of ups and downs to a successful
close.
Mule's Kick Potent
But the kick of the Army Mule is
quite likely to be much more potent
than the chaw and claw of the Berke
ley Bear, if Saturday's battle is any
indication to West Point's real
strength. The Cadets actually out
played Notre Dame during most of
the game, and the latter squad was
lucky to win on a fluke ninety-eight
yard run after an intercepted pass.
Cagle, as usual, tore off a couple of
sensational gains, while Johnny Mur
rell featured at fullback with his punt
ing, bucking, and hard tackling.
The only outstanding weakness of
the Army team was its passing attack.
West Point failed to complete a single
pass and a wild flip of the pigskin
turned out to be its downfall. How
ever, it must be remembered that the
game was played on a slippery trozen
field in an almost blizzard-like gale.
Coach Biff Jones expects his boys to
do better in this department against
Stanford, as the contest will probably
be played on a dry and speedy turf,
and as the Cards have a supposedly
notorious rusty pass defense.
Spurred on by news of West Point's
great and wholly unexpected showing
against Knute Rockne's undefeated
Ramblers from South Bend, Coach
Pop Warner's big football varsity will
return to the practice field today to
work off the effects of a week's rest
enjoyed by the Cards following their
smashing upset of California's Glolden
Bear and to get back into fighting
trim for the Army clash on December
28.
As Pop is not scheduled to return
from the East, where he scouted the
Cadet-Irish game and is now selecting
an all-American team in collaboration
with three of his brother coaching
foxes, until Wednesday or Thursday,
the first few practice sessions of the
week will be directed by Tiny Thorn
