# AN IRON-CLAD RULE AND HUMAN LIFE
## 
### 
The attention of the campus is focused on the Stanford Health
Service by the tragic death of Alan Goodspeed last week, concerning
which "1931" writes in today's Campus Opinion column.
There seems to be a confusion of facts as reported by "1931" and
Dr. Harry B. Torrey, director of the service. The policy of the present
system is against giving treatment to the students as outlined by Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, Medical Advisor of Men. Just why this rule
exists no one seems to know, but a rule is a rule and there are to be
no exceptions. Consequently when surgical aid was sought it could not
be given because of the rule. But the secretary in the office, according
to Dr. Torrey, called a doctor and advised him to go to the hospital;
called the hospital and advised that the operating room be put in
readiness; and called an ambulance.
In this particular case, the aid given by the Health Service worked
out to be of greater value than if one of its doctors had rushed dramati
cally to the scene of the accident. But what about the hypothetical case
where a student is injured and a hemorrhage results? His life depends
on the quickness in which he gets medical attention. It is here that the
pertinent question asked by "1931" is apropos and we repeat with him,
"why can't Stanford have a medical department that will give the
students instant surgical treatment when they need it?"
Regardless of the rules, the wherefores, whereases, and whys, when
a man is injured he needs immediate surgical treatment as quickly and
conveniently as possible. That need should be met here on the campus,
especially when every man in the University pays in advance fifteen
dollars ($15.00) a year, or an approximate total of forty-five thousand
dollars ($45,000.00), for a Health Service.
