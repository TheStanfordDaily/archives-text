# TARIFF, TAX TOPICS FACE CONGRESSMEN
## Initial Regular Session of Hoover Administration Commences Today 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1.
gress convenes tomorrow in the first
regular session of the Hoover admin
istration with a host of old and new
problems commanding attention.
Tariff revision, coming over from
the extra session called last April by
Hoover, and tax reduction, recently
proposed by the administration with
the approval of the Democrats, head
the list of subjects and will receive
first consideration.
Long Session Looms
So varied are the legislative pro
posals facing the session, however,
that Congressional leaders predicted
today the meeting would carry on
until at least next June. By that time
the regular biennial Congressional
election campaigns will be under way
and the top-heavy Republican majori
ties elected with President Hoover a
year ago will be up for the first test
of his administration at the polls.
