# COLLEGIATE VANDALS
## 
### 
Wednesday night shortly after midnight, fire hoses in both Toyon and
Branner halls were turned on full force and allowed to run long enough
to flood the dormitories to the extent of several hundred dollars damage.
The acts were perpetrated on the second floor of both halls. Water
at Branner seeped through the ceiling and deluged the lobby.
These foolish displays of vandalism were undoubtedly committed by
students fully cognizant that they were destroying University property
and taxing inmates of those living quarters with the expense of making
reparation for damage done.
The University furnishes Stanford men with two of the finest dormi
tories to be found anywhere in the country, Branner and Toyon. Com
fortable living quarters are available at a cost far below that of the
average school. No sponsor system prevails. Men living in the two
dorms are free to do as they please, if their actions are within the
bounds of common sense.
But such acts of vandalism as witnessed on Thanksgiving Eve are
intolerable. Those guilty should be deprived of their room rights. There
are too many students on both the Branner and Toyon waiting lists for
the University to tolerate such exhibitions of nonsensical moronishness.
