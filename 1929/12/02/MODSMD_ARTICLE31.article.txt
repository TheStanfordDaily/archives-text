# THE 						ALL-AMERICAN COMPLEX
## 
### 
Now that the great guns along the football fronts are stilled, except
for intermittent rumblings, a time has come in the course of human
events for the nation's array of sport experts to display their erudition
and ignorance in the selection of "All-American," "All-Coast," "All-
Conference," and "All-Ilooey" elevens.
When Walter Camp was at the heyday of his career and when "stars
of all time" were not as thick as flies, such selections meant something,
perhaps. In those palmy days, standards of gridiron excellency were
comparatively clear, envolving principally thickness of skull, size of
biceps, and length of whiskers.
Now that psychology, ballyhoo, and complicated point systems are
recognized as cardinal elements of success; and now that "wonder
teams" are developed by each university at least once every three years,
this business of all-star selections has about as much importance as the
naming of an all-fraternity ping-pong duo.
