BLACK ROSES. By Francis Brett
Young. Harper and Brothers, New
York and London. 1929. $2.50.
"Black Roses" is a story made
beautiful by atmosphere, and sugges
tion. The plot is fairly mediocre, with
decided weaknesses of vitality and
action, as a result of the author's
proneness to sentimentalize too con
stantly. So far as its reading value is
concerned, it is simply another book
in the long list of vaguely haunting,
unreal romances, with some glamor
ous far-away city as a setting, and a
unique historical occurrence used
skilfully for the background of its
climax.
In the case of "Black Roses," Na
ples and the cholera plague furnish
the glamorous and historical elements
that are necessary, and also furnish
the real strength and interest of the
story. Every line that is written about
Naples is worth very careful reading,
both because he faithfully reproduces
the old-world atmosphere of dust and
age and queer customs and strange
temperaments that appears so pecu
liarly fascinating to a modern, practi
cal world.
The story is a tragedy—death, fail
ure, unhappiness, shattered dreams

are the fates meted out to its chief
characters; its pages are stamped
with sadness or bitterness. So much
melancholy becomes a trifle weari
some, especially as the hero, an am
bitious but hopelessly idealistic artist,
drifts from one misfortune to another
in a spirit of futile resignation, losing
his friends, his family, his sweetheart,
and his chance for fame; he finally
ends as a placid old man who con
vinces himself that after all he :s not
unhappy.
But the photographic side of the
book is really exceptional. Take the
following passage:
"Pale lightning washed the dense
sky above the mountains behind
which Pergola lay, throwing into omi
nous relief black billows of cloud,
that, like heralds of approaching
doom, kept nightlong watch over the
city's sleepless coruscations. Though
the night sky was jet, the stones of
Naples still radiated warmth like the
lining of an oven."
Here atmosphere and vivid reality
are combined into a whole of singular
power and beauty. Each adjective,
each figure of speech is faultless. It
is for such pieces of writing that
"Black Roses" can be recommended.
