# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD
## 
### 
W. K. Sprott, '06, was elected cap
tain of the Stanford football team for
the 1905 season. Sprott had played
tackle on the freshman team in 1902
and on the varsity in the two years
following. In the California game, two
weeks previous to the election, Sprott
had displayed excellent work on the
offense and California failed to make
a single gain through him on the de
tense.
The law students of the University
of Chicago petitioned the council ask
ing that women of the college be pro
hibited from using the law library.
They claimed that the younger law
students conversed continually with
the women, hindering those who were
there for serious work.
How about the main library?
An editorial: The second number

FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF DECEMBER 2, 1904

of the Stanford Alumnus, under the
editorship of Archie Rice, '95, has
come off the press. The issue is un
doubtedly the best number of the
graduate publication that has ever
been published.
Well, it had to be either the best
or the worst.
