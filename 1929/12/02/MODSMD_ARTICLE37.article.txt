OH YES, WE ARE COLLEGIATE
The Editor, Sir:
I quote Pare Lorenz in "Life":
" 'So This Is College' looks a great
deal like a Roxyette interpretation of
life at New York U., downtown
branch. At the slightest provocation a
quarter of a hundred and fifty 40-year
old lads break into songs, and the
sharp collegiate repartee greatly re
sembles the kind usually found on
the campus between the Palace and
the Columbia theatres. The college
impersonators included such gay un
dergraduates as Ukelele Ike, a two-to
one bet on Notre Dame being as close
as most of them ever came to campus
life. It is, as usual, a cheap Hollywood
representation of life at college. And
the odd part of it is that, with the
exception of Stanford, life at college
in California probably is like that."
Finally the critics awake to proper
ly criticize the college celluloid opus
after movie moguls who never went
to college tell the U.S.A. about college.
The hash is question is a table
which openly deals with Stanford and
U.S.C. in a Rah Rah way as the above
indicates. Why Senor Lorenz should
differentiate between Stanford and
the rest of the California colleges is
beyond the capacity of my imagina
tion. I can merely guess—
1. Because Stanford is 500 miles
from Hollywood.
2. Because the 500 and the men do
not regard each other seriously or
romantically.
3. Because once in awhile an ath
letic star is flunked out of Stanford.
(I recall Hables.)
4. Because school spirit at Stanford
is largely confined to bottles.
5. Because "College Humor" is as
popular with Stanford students as a
political essay by Lenin is with the
House of Morgan.
