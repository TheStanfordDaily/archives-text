# STANFORD DAILY WILL HAVE NEW PRESS FOR USE WINTER QUARTER
## 
### 
A new, modern press for the Daily
is included in the equipment on its
way here for the Stanford Press
building. It is now at the Palo Alto
depot and will be installed immediate
ly in order that it will be ready for
use at the beginning of Winter Quar
ter.
The new press is known as the
Duplex Model A and is made by the
Duplex Printing Press Company of
Battle Creek, Michigan. It will utilize
roll instead of sheet paper and will
have three or four times the speed of
the press now in use. The machine
will be able to print, cut, and fold the
papers in one operation at the rate
of 3500 per hour.
The equipment from the old build
ing will be moved into the new unit
at the same time that the new equip
ment is installed, which will be some
time around December 15. While the
old building will be remodeled and
used for offices and store and ship
ping rooms, the new building will be
devoted to the actual printing pro
cesses.
