BEAR HOPES, BARE HOPES?
Ever since that memorial licking of
a few days past, when His Nibs, the
little Napoleon of the 1929 gridiron
season, and a vast multitude of rabid
Blue and Gold followers met their
Waterloo, the well-stuffed Golden
Bear has been moping around the
Campanile emitting foam - sputtered
oaths, such as: "You just wait until
1930 —we'll surely beat the holy living
tar out of Stanford next fall."
It seems that the Berkeley lads
have been singing this same
mournful tune for the past five
years now!
And so they take it for granted that
they will be sitting on top of the
world by the time the final gun is
sounded one year hence. One cannot
but admire the pluck and pep of the
fallen champ. Yet, it appears to nu
merous Farm observers that this sud
den burst of optimism is slightly un
called for.
It is a mere tower of hope without
any foundation of fact!
For a close examination of the pig
skin situation discloses that the '30
Cardinal varsity will be on a par, if
not above, with the team that so re
cently administered the 21 to 6 skin
ning of the Golden Bear. At the same
time, cold figures show that the Blue
and Gold football machine can hardly
match this year's outfit —unless it is
quite suddenly injected with loads of
new and better players from the land
of somewhere.
The remains of Mr. Bear are
slim, indeed. His skeleton, when
shorn of Benny Lom and the rest
of the graduating meat, will leave
a rather small pile of bones with
which bearmaster Price can mold
his '30 model formidable bearish
beast!
Mr. Price is undoubtedly a little
more glum than he makes out to be.
W T hat coach could be very happy on
losing his four best linesmen, Captain
Roy Riegels, Joe Pitto, Bob Norton,
and Bert Sehwarz, and a foursome of
his best backs, men of the same cali
ber as B. Lom, L. Eisan, L. Rice, and
S. Barr?
Then take a minute peek at the
opposite side of the picture. There
one sees the Old Fox, master of them
all when it comes to turning out fin
ished football products, not saying
much —but thinking a hell of a lot.
Pop is not gloating over his recent
victory, though he is as happy as a
lark in the springtime. And he cannot
but grin broadly whenever he happens
to cast a thought about next year's
gridiron campaign.
For although the big Cardinal var
sity will be minus a few of its best
players when the next pigskin curtain
rolls up, it will be more than supplied
with first class material. The Red
shirt will be bulging out with preg
nancy in this respect. It seems as
though Stanford is destined to give
birth to one of the best in the West
once more!
Outside of the regulars, who are
scheduled to return to the Farm
for another year of so-called sub
sidization plus brutal punishment,
Stanford will be blessed with a
milling horde of players, classed
as substitutes this fall, though
who in reality would make scin
tillating regulars in any man's
league. Moreover, the Old Man
will be greeted with a number of
graduates from this year's cham
pionship Gray squad, as well as
some potential greats from Husky
Hunt's yearling eleven.
On November 23, Mr. Price was
forced to sit on the bench gnawing his
teeth as a few of these so-called
Stanford subs outplayed his first
string men. He didn't even get a
squint of a couple of Cards, who were
classed as regulars when the season
began but who were forced to the
sidelines because of injuries. This
pair of vets, Bill Simkins and Pete
Heiser, will both be back next autumn
to harass and annoy the little Napo
leon. And so will the gang of stal
wart reserves who taunted him on
the 23rd.
One young gentleman who is
bound to get under Nibs' skin in
the near future is none other than
Phil Neill, lanky blond end. Neill
has played a bang up game all
season, climaxing it with an out
standing demonstration in the
Big Game. On that bright and
sunny day, Mr. Neill far outshone
the highly touted wingmen known
in Berkeley town as Avery, Nor
ton, hnd Thornton.
A quartet of smashing tackles will
be back again. Besides Ray Tandy,
all-Coast candidate, Chang Artman,
240-pound youngster, Red Thompson,
who showed the great Beckett a few
tricks of the trade, and Dick Bogue,
touted by Bill Leister as the smartest
line prospect on the Coast, will be
battling it out for a chance to tangle
with the '30 Bears.
In the backfield, other than iron
man Harlow Rothert, who outpunted
by ample margin the all-Coast kicker
B. Lom, will be Phil Moffatt, Harry
Hillman, Guido Caglieri, and Bill
Clark. All of these boys are cleat

minded, as the '29 Bears will remem
ber to their dying days.
So it is no wonder that Stan
fordites merely smile, when they
hear the awful grumblings and
cursings and optimistic oaths of
the Golden Bear. At any rate, the
Bears will have to show a lot
more stuff than plain ordinary
hope to win the 36th annual Big
Game.--

Phil Neill, lanky blond end. Neill
has played a bang up game all
season, climaxing it with an out
standing demonstration in the
Big Game. On that bright and
sunny day, Mr. Neill far outshone
the highly touted wingmen known
in Berkeley town as Avery, Nor
ton, hnd Thornton.
A quartet of smashing tackles will
be back again. Besides Ray Tandy,
all-Coast candidate, Chang Artman,
240-pound youngster, Red Thompson,
who showed the great Beckett a few
tricks of the trade, and Dick Bogue,
touted by Bill Leister as the smartest
line prospect on the Coast, will be
battling it out for a chance to tangle
with the '30 Bears.
In the backfield, other than iron
man Harlow Rothert, who outpunted
by ample margin the all-Coast kicker
B. Lom, will be Phil Moffatt, Harry
Hillman, Guido Caglieri, and Bill
Clark. All of these boys are cleat

minded, as the '29 Bears will remem
ber to their dying days.
So it is no wonder that Stan
fordites merely smile, when they
hear the awful grumblings and
cursings and optimistic oaths of
the Golden Bear. At any rate, the
Bears will have to show a lot
more stuff than plain ordinary
hope to win the 36th annual Big

BEAR HOPES, BARE HOPES?
Ever since that memorial licking of
a few days past, when His Nibs, the
little Napoleon of the 1929 gridiron
season, and a vast multitude of rabid
Blue and Gold followers met their
Waterloo, the well-stuffed Golden
Bear has been moping around the
Campanile emitting foam - sputtered
oaths, such as: "You just wait until
1930 —we'll surely beat the holy living
tar out of Stanford next fall."
It seems that the Berkeley lads
have been singing this same
mournful tune for the past five
years now!
And so they take it for granted that
they will be sitting on top of the
world by the time the final gun is
sounded one year hence. One cannot
but admire the pluck and pep of the
fallen champ. Yet, it appears to nu
merous Farm observers that this sud
den burst of optimism is slightly un
called for.
It is a mere tower of hope without
any foundation of fact!
For a close examination of the pig
skin situation discloses that the '30
Cardinal varsity will be on a par, if
not above, with the team that so re
cently administered the 21 to 6 skin
ning of the Golden Bear. At the same
time, cold figures show that the Blue
and Gold football machine can hardly
match this year's outfit —unless it is
quite suddenly injected with loads of
new and better players from the land
of somewhere.
The remains of Mr. Bear are
slim, indeed. His skeleton, when
shorn of Benny Lom and the rest
of the graduating meat, will leave
a rather small pile of bones with
which bearmaster Price can mold
his '30 model formidable bearish
beast!
Mr. Price is undoubtedly a little
more glum than he makes out to be.
W T hat coach could be very happy on
losing his four best linesmen, Captain
Roy Riegels, Joe Pitto, Bob Norton,
and Bert Sehwarz, and a foursome of
his best backs, men of the same cali
ber as B. Lom, L. Eisan, L. Rice, and
S. Barr?
Then take a minute peek at the
opposite side of the picture. There
one sees the Old Fox, master of them
all when it comes to turning out fin
ished football products, not saying
much —but thinking a hell of a lot.
Pop is not gloating over his recent
victory, though he is as happy as a
lark in the springtime. And he cannot
but grin broadly whenever he happens
to cast a thought about next year's
gridiron campaign.
For although the big Cardinal var
sity will be minus a few of its best
players when the next pigskin curtain
rolls up, it will be more than supplied
with first class material. The Red
shirt will be bulging out with preg
nancy in this respect. It seems as
though Stanford is destined to give
birth to one of the best in the West
once more!
Outside of the regulars, who are
scheduled to return to the Farm
for another year of so-called sub
sidization plus brutal punishment,
Stanford will be blessed with a
milling horde of players, classed
as substitutes this fall, though
who in reality would make scin
tillating regulars in any man's
league. Moreover, the Old Man
will be greeted with a number of
graduates from this year's cham
pionship Gray squad, as well as
some potential greats from Husky
Hunt's yearling eleven.
On November 23, Mr. Price was
forced to sit on the bench gnawing his
teeth as a few of these so-called
Stanford subs outplayed his first
string men. He didn't even get a
squint of a couple of Cards, who were
classed as regulars when the season
began but who were forced to the
sidelines because of injuries. This
pair of vets, Bill Simkins and Pete
Heiser, will both be back next autumn
to harass and annoy the little Napo
leon. And so will the gang of stal
wart reserves who taunted him on
the 23rd.
One young gentleman who is

shirt will be bulging out with preg
nancy in this respect. It seems as
though Stanford is destined to give
birth to one of the best in the West
once more!
Outside of the regulars, who are
scheduled to return to the Farm
for another year of so-called sub
sidization plus brutal punishment,
Stanford will be blessed with a
milling horde of players, classed
as substitutes this fall, though
who in reality would make scin
tillating regulars in any man's
league. Moreover, the Old Man
will be greeted with a number of
graduates from this year's cham
pionship Gray squad, as well as
some potential greats from Husky
Hunt's yearling eleven.
On November 23, Mr. Price was
forced to sit on the bench gnawing his
teeth as a few of these so-called
Stanford subs outplayed his first
string men. He didn't even get a
squint of a couple of Cards, who were
classed as regulars when the season
began but who were forced to the
sidelines because of injuries. This
pair of vets, Bill Simkins and Pete
Heiser, will both be back next autumn
to harass and annoy the little Napo
leon. And so will the gang of stal
wart reserves who taunted him on
the 23rd.
One young gentleman who is
bound to get under Nibs' skin in
the near future is none other than
Phil Neill, lanky blond end. Neill
has played a bang up game all
season, climaxing it with an out
standing demonstration in the
Big Game. On that bright and
sunny day, Mr. Neill far outshone
the highly touted wingmen known
in Berkeley town as Avery, Nor
ton, hnd Thornton.
A quartet of smashing tackles will
be back again. Besides Ray Tandy,
all-Coast candidate, Chang Artman,
240-pound youngster, Red Thompson,
who showed the great Beckett a few
tricks of the trade, and Dick Bogue,
touted by Bill Leister as the smartest
line prospect on the Coast, will be
battling it out for a chance to tangle
with the '30 Bears.
In the backfield, other than iron
man Harlow Rothert, who outpunted
by ample margin the all-Coast kicker
B. Lom, will be Phil Moffatt, Harry
Hillman, Guido Caglieri, and Bill
Clark. All of these boys are cleat

minded, as the '29 Bears will remem
ber to their dying days.
So it is no wonder that Stan
fordites merely smile, when they
hear the awful grumblings and
cursings and optimistic oaths of
the Golden Bear. At any rate, the
Bears will have to show a lot
more stuff than plain ordinary
hope to win the 36th annual Big
Game.--

BEAR HOPES, BARE HOPES?
Ever since that memorial licking of
a few days past, when His Nibs, the
little Napoleon of the 1929 gridiron
season, and a vast multitude of rabid
Blue and Gold followers met their
Waterloo, the well-stuffed Golden
Bear has been moping around the
Campanile emitting foam - sputtered
oaths, such as: "You just wait until
1930 —we'll surely beat the holy living
tar out of Stanford next fall."
It seems that the Berkeley lads
have been singing this same
mournful tune for the past five
years now!
And so they take it for granted that
they will be sitting on top of the
world by the time the final gun is
sounded one year hence. One cannot
but admire the pluck and pep of the
fallen champ. Yet, it appears to nu
merous Farm observers that this sud
den burst of optimism is slightly un
called for.
It is a mere tower of hope without
any foundation of fact!
For a close examination of the pig
skin situation discloses that the '30
Cardinal varsity will be on a par, if
not above, with the team that so re
cently administered the 21 to 6 skin
ning of the Golden Bear. At the same
time, cold figures show that the Blue
and Gold football machine can hardly
match this year's outfit —unless it is
quite suddenly injected with loads of
new and better players from the land
of somewhere.
The remains of Mr. Bear are
slim, indeed. His skeleton, when
shorn of Benny Lom and the rest
of the graduating meat, will leave
a rather small pile of bones with
which bearmaster Price can mold
his '30 model formidable bearish
beast!
Mr. Price is undoubtedly a little
more glum than he makes out to be.
W T hat coach could be very happy on
losing his four best linesmen, Captain
Roy Riegels, Joe Pitto, Bob Norton,
and Bert Sehwarz, and a foursome of
his best backs, men of the same cali
ber as B. Lom, L. Eisan, L. Rice, and
S. Barr?
Then take a minute peek at the
opposite side of the picture. There
one sees the Old Fox, master of them
all when it comes to turning out fin
ished football products, not saying
much —but thinking a hell of a lot.
Pop is not gloating over his recent
victory, though he is as happy as a
lark in the springtime. And he cannot
but grin broadly whenever he happens
to cast a thought about next year's
gridiron campaign.
For although the big Cardinal var
sity will be minus a few of its best
players when the next pigskin curtain
rolls up, it will be more than supplied
