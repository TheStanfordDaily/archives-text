# FISHER RETURNS FROM EXTENDED RESEARCH TRIP THROUGH EUROPE
## Russian Succession States Show Economic Progress Reports Lecturer 
### Stewart Crawford 
H. H. Fisher, lecturer in the Stan
ford History Department, returned
recently from a five months' trip to
northern and eastern Europe, taken
in the interests of the Hoover War
Library and of research in Russian
history in which he is engaged.
Regarding the change in conditions
he found there, Fisher said:
"The Russian succession states from
Finland to Poland have all made much
economic progress since I last visited
them in ] 922. Political conditions have
also stabilized except in Lithuania
and Poland, where parliamentary gov
ernment has given way temporarily
to dictatorships. Relations of the bor
der states with the Soviet Union are
normal. The question of revolutionary
propaganda is always present but no
longer acute, and there are no other
major issues that seriously disturb
relations. Incidents occur, but the
state of public opinion is such that
they are usually adjusted without dif
ficulty."
Plan Self-Sufficiency
High hopes are held by the Union
of Soviet Republics for the much-ad
vertized Five Year Plan, according to
Fisher, and if attempts to put it into
effect succeed, it is hoped to make the
Union relatively self-sufficient indus
trially, and to socialize the villages.
"Many do not share the Govern
ment's optimism," he continued. "The
New Economic Policy has gone, and
with it most private trade. In the
larger centers retail trade is almost
entirely in the hands of co-operatives.
Some commodities are rationed. Oth
ers are difficult to obtain, but where
obtainable, the prices are reasonable.
Life in the cities is perhaps more
difficult than before the New Eco
nomic Plan was abolished."
Fisher found that there are com
plaints and criticism of the Govern
ment both inside and outside the
party, but there is no organized or
general opposition.
