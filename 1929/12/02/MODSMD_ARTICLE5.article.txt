# Prandtl Lectures Today On Aeronautics Phenomena
## 
### 
"The Formation and Behavior of
Vortices in Moving Fluids" will be the
subject of a lecture given by Dr. L.
Prandtl, Director of the Laboratory
of Fluid Mechanics at the University
of Gottingen, Germany, to aeronauti
cal students and others interested, in
the Machine Shop Lecture Room at
10 o'clock this morning. Lantern
slides and moving pictures will illus
trate the lecture.
Dr. Prandtl, who, according to Pro
fessor Wm. F. Durand, Professor
Emeritus of Engineering, is con
sidered the "father" of the foundation
of the present body of aerodynamic
theory, particularly in regard to the
"vortex phenomena," is making a trip
around the world visiting the principal
aeronautical laboratories. He landed
in San Francisco from Japan last
Wednesday and visited the Guggen
heim Aeronautics Laboratory here
Friday.
