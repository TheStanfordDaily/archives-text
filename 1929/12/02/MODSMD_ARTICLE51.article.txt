# SPORTS OF 1929
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
The exciting Notre Dame-Southern
California football game at Soldier
Field, Chicago, on November 16, pro
duced two of the finest quarterbacks
in years, as well as more thrills than
are usually found in half a dozen av
erage games. The contest also defi
nitely established the 1929 Notre
Dame eleven as the classiest football
team that Rockne has had since "The
Four Horsemen," for they not only
defeated Indiana, Navy, Wisconsin,
Carnegie Tech, and Georgia Tech, but
they proved themselves decisively su
perior to U.S.C., which had beaten
Stanford and wiped up the earth with
Washington, 48 to 0.
Frank Carideo, the "Irish" field gen
eral, proved himself not only an able

leader, but also a marvel at carrying
the ball and punting. Duffield, of the
Trojans, kicked beautiful 50-yard spi
rals, but Carideo booted them 55, 60,
and even G5 yards. And it was
Frank's placement kick after the sec
ond Notre Dame touchdown that
proved the deciding point in the his
toric gridiron epic.
The übiquitous Irish quarterback
also caught Elder's long pass which
bounced off Conley's hands behind
the goal line. Carideo, a "real Notre
Dame quarterback," comes from
Mount Vernon, New York. He runs
the team faultlessly, and can pass
beautifully as well as carry the ball.
In the Georgia Tech game he returned
a punt 75 yards! He is twenty years
old, weighs 172, and stands 5 feet 7.
The Trojan quarterback, ltussell
Saunders, provided one of the biggest
thrills of the afternoon of November
16 at Soldier Field when he ran back
Carideo's kickoff 95 yards for a touch
down to make the score 13 to 12.
Saunders has plenty of speed, and he
used it to advantage in that amazing
run. He also punted well, and led a
second Trojan drive in the fourth
quarter that £nded on the 29-yard line.
Saunders \yas the chief ground gainer
for the University of California in the
losing tight against California on No
vember 2. He is a versatile chap and
has played every position in the back
field. He is married, as are two other
members of the Trojan team.

ond Notre Dame touchdown that
proved the deciding point in the his
toric gridiron epic.
The übiquitous Irish quarterback
also caught Elder's long pass which
bounced off Conley's hands behind
the goal line. Carideo, a "real Notre
Dame quarterback," comes from
Mount Vernon, New York. He runs
the team faultlessly, and can pass
beautifully as well as carry the ball.
In the Georgia Tech game he returned
a punt 75 yards! He is twenty years
old, weighs 172, and stands 5 feet 7.
The Trojan quarterback, ltussell
Saunders, provided one of the biggest
thrills of the afternoon of November
16 at Soldier Field when he ran back
Carideo's kickoff 95 yards for a touch
down to make the score 13 to 12.
Saunders has plenty of speed, and he
used it to advantage in that amazing
run. He also punted well, and led a
second Trojan drive in the fourth
quarter that £nded on the 29-yard line.
Saunders \yas the chief ground gainer
for the University of California in the
losing tight against California on No
vember 2. He is a versatile chap and
has played every position in the back
field. He is married, as are two other
members of the Trojan team.


Two Great Quarterbacks
The exciting Notre Dame-Southern
California football game at Soldier
Field, Chicago, on November 16, pro
duced two of the finest quarterbacks
in years, as well as more thrills than
are usually found in half a dozen av
erage games. The contest also defi
nitely established the 1929 Notre
Dame eleven as the classiest football
team that Rockne has had since "The
Four Horsemen," for they not only
defeated Indiana, Navy, Wisconsin,
Carnegie Tech, and Georgia Tech, but
they proved themselves decisively su
perior to U.S.C., which had beaten
Stanford and wiped up the earth with
Washington, 48 to 0.
Frank Carideo, the "Irish" field gen
eral, proved himself not only an able

leader, but also a marvel at carrying
the ball and punting. Duffield, of the
Trojans, kicked beautiful 50-yard spi
rals, but Carideo booted them 55, 60,
and even G5 yards. And it was
Frank's placement kick after the sec
ond Notre Dame touchdown that
proved the deciding point in the his
toric gridiron epic.
