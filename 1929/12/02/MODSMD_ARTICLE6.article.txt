# 'Old Boy' Wants All Copy For Next Chappie In Today
## 
### 
"Whooie!" puffed the Old Boy yes
terday as he loosened liis belt a cou
ple more notches, "I haven't subsided
yet from that big turkey feed; in fact,
I'm almost set to put out the Decem
ber issue of the Chaparral. Deadline
for copy is today, and anything not
in the office or in the mails by mid
night just won't go in the issue."
The December issue is a combined
"Christmas and Football Number" and
jokes about the holidays or the oc
cupancy of Branner Hall by the West
Point team will be gratefully received
by the Ancient Wheezer.
