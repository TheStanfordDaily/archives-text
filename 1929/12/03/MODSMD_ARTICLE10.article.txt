# HERTZ CONDUCTS A.S.S.U. CONCERT HERE TOMORROW
## Friedman Will Be Soloist; S.F. Symphony to Play Four Selections 
### 
Good seats for the Symphony
concert Wednesday night are still
available at the A.S.S.U. Offices
in the Old Union and at Sherman,
Clay & Co. Prices are $1.00, $1.50,
and $2.00.
Alfred Hertz will conduct the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in the
first offering on the A.S.S.U. Concert
Series, tomorrow evening at 8:15
o'clock, in the Pavilion. Ignaz Fried
man, "Colossus of the Pianoforte,"
will be the soloist.
To Play Liszt Concerto
The orchestra's program will con
sist of Mendelssohn's Overture to "A
Midsummer-Night's Dream," Georg
Schumann's "Dance of the Nymphs
and Satyrs," Rimsky-Koraskov's
"Spanish Caprice," and the Strauss
Tone Poem "Don Juan." Friedman
will play the Liszt Concerto in E Flat
Major.
This season is Hertz's last in the
conductor's stand. He is well-known
and has been one of the nation's
musical leaders for many years. His
orchestra is equally famous as one of
the best in the country, although there
have been several additions to the
personnel this year, as will probably
be noteA by music-wise members of
the Stanford audience.
Friedman likewise needs no intro
duction either to west coast audiences
or to campus audiences. Had he not
appeared in a previous performance
here, his international reputation
would have preceded him.
