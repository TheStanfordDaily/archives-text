# PHI KAPS DOWN BETA SEVEN BY 25 TO 14 SCORE
## Ward Edmonds' Running And Passing Give Margin To Winning Team 
### 
Too much Edmonds proved the
downfall of Beta Theta Pi as Phi
Kappa Sigma emerged on the long
end of a 25-14 score in the first play
off game among intramural football
league winners held yesterday after
noon on the frosh field.
This afternoon at three the Phi
Kap's will meet El Toro on the frosh
field while at the same time Delta Tau
Delta and Breakers clash on the
Grays' field.
Edmonds, Phi Kappa Sigma's fleet
fullback, either ran with the ball or
tossed a pass on every play when his
team had the ball. During the after
noon Ward scored two touchdowns,
gained more than 100 yards on runs
from scrimmage, and ran back one
punt thirty-five yards.
After forcing the Betas to punt,
Edmonds and his cohorts used only
four plays to put over their first acore.
Phi Kap Passes
Just before the end of the first
half, the Phi Kaps put over another
score on two long passes, Edmonds
to Westsmith, for 40 yards, and Ed
monds to Clark, for forty more. Clark
ran the remaining five yards to score.
A pass to Westsmith added the extra
point. Score at half time: Phi Kappa
Sigma 13, Beta Theta Pi 0.
Undiscouraged, the Betas pulled a
comeback in the third quarter to
score two touchdowns and add the
extra points, putting them in the
lead 14-13.
The fourth quarter was all Phi
Kappa Sigma. After a Beta punt rolled
outside on the twenty-yard line, Ed
monds passed 40 yards to Evans who
ran 35 yards to add six more points.
Later, Evans intercepted a Beta pass
on their own twenty-yard line, and
after two short passes Edmonds ran
down the sideline to make the final
score of the day.
