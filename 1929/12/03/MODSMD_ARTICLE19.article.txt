# PLANS FOR STANFORDARMY ROOTING STUNTS MADE BY COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Plans for organizing stunts which
are to be used in the rooting section
at the Stanford-Army game were dis
cussed at the weekly meeting of the
rally committee last night.
Helen Thompson, Fred Hubler, and
Paul Speegle are in charge of the
stunts and suggestions should be sub
mitted to them today or tomorrow, it
was stated.
Rooters are requested by the rally
committee to arrive at the game early.
This is to facilitate seating arrange
ments so that entrances to the sec
tion will not become jammed with
students trying to find seats just as
the game begins.
