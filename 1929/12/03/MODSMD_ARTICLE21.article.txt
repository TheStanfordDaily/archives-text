### Elisabeth Larsh 
Treating the "play within a play"
situation in "Cock Robin" with ex
treme originality, Elmer Rice and
Phillip Barry, authors of this mystery
comedy which is to be given Friday
night by the sophomore class, have
made very interesting use of the one
set required for the play.
The first act takes place at the
dress rehearsal of a home talent pro
duction by the Cope Valley Commun
ity Players, the scene of whose play
is laid in an eighteenth century grog
shop. The second and third acts take
place in the same place but the per
spective is completely reversed. In
stead of facing the stage in (he ordin
ary manner as in the first act. the
audience will be viewing the action
as if from the back of the stage. In
stead of the fireplace and walls which
are seen at the back of the set, a

black void representing the audience
and a row of footlights will give a
completely reversed impression from
that of the first act.
Reversible Side Flats
To make possible this unusual ef
fect, Frederick Stover, acting techni
cal director, had to construct the side
flats so that they were reversible,
which necessitated the use of entire
ly new angles of placement.
The set itself is one of pleasing
warmth and color, representing a
typical eighteenth century grog shop
with many interesting properties and
accessories. A quaint old lighting fix
ture consisting of several old oil
i lamps mounted on a large cartwheel
j and a big lantern at the side of the
huge fireplace will be used for obvi
| ous lighting. Mugs, old pewter, a pipe
j rack, and other properties typical of
, the period and locale being portrayed
| will add atmosphere.
