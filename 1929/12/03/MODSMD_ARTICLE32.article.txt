# THE 						CONCERT SERIES NEEDS YOUR SUPPORT
## 
### 
That the present A.S.S.U. concert series is in difficult financial straits
is putting it mildly. Three hundred and fifty more season tickets must be
sold before the manager can hope to break even. If his books show figures
in the red, it is likely that there will be no more concert series.
Stanford students of past generations fought to bring this superior
and unusually entertaining feature to the campus. They succeeded. As
long as they were in school, the series was supported and was a financial
success. But with the influx of new students from year to year, the con
cert series has been taken for granted and this year its status has reached
a crisis.
The concert series needs no plea as a charitable organization. Inter
nationally famous singers and musicians are brought to the campus for a
sum that cannot be equaled anywhere on the Peninsula. Part of an edu
cation consists of taking advantage of the cultural opportunities offered
outside the classroom. Whether the concert series is to continue is
squarely up to the present Stanford student body. Most of the old students
are going tomorrow night. The new students, should get back of this
worthwhile project.
By attending tomorrow night's concert series, they can keep alive an
institution of which Stanford is proud.
