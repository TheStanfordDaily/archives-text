In the campus opinion column Vox Populi has pointed out what she
considers to be a serious defect in the method of appointing women's
sponsors. Tonight members of the five hundred will hold a mass meeting
to decide whether or not the new constitution shall be adopted.
If all women believe the question of appointing sponsors as serious as
Vox Populi does, they will do well to give the matter serious consideration
and attend tonight's meeting prepared to oppose or defend it. And if they
believe, as the writer of the campus opinion does, that the clause in the
constitution concerning sponsors is undesirable they should be prepared
to set in operation machinery to change the offensive article.
