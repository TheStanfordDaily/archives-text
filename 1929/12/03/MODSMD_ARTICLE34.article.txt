# THE 						NEW "PHI BETE" CLASS
## 
### 
In other columns of this newspaper will be found a list of thirty-one
new members of Phi Beta Kappa, national honorary scholastic society.
While the "Phi Bete" has long been the subject of jest, it must be
realized that the key is concrete evidence of the successful accomplishment
of a difficult feat.
Whether or not the Phi Beta Kappa man or woman is mentally supe
rior to the student who achieves no such signal scholastic distinction is a
matter which has always been argued, and one which will probably be
argued as long as the present grading system exists.
Forgetting the various arguments on the intellectual side of the matter,
the fact remains that one who gains a coveted Phi Beta Kappa key has
proved his or her capacity for hard work and determinationâ€”and after
all the results are what count.
