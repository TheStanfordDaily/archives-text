# WILBUR ADVOCATES CONSERVATION
## 
### 
Long a lover of outdoors and always a staunch proponent of conser
vation campaigns, Dr. Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior, is assisting Pres
ident Hoover in examining the feasibility of restoring public lands, now
under federal control, to state guardianship.
Dr. Wilbur, who is a fisherman of no mean repute and who undoubt
edly knows as many mountain streams where wily trout abound as he
does methods for the elimination of the lower division, appreciates the
value of a strong program of conservation and protection for public lands.
lie knows that in the mountains are the watersheds. lie knows that
industries of the valley and the coast are dependent upon the hydro-elec
tric power generated in those mountain watersheds. He knows that selfish
lumbering causes rapid erosion and that removal of plant growth converts
a watershed into a raging torrent in winter time and a dry arid region in
the summer.
Dr. Wilbur, as usual, is peering into the future. He sees in protected
watersheds a source of water supply which, someday, will unlock the arid
wastelands of the West and transform them into rich farming sections
where America's surplus population will flow.
Alarmed at the persistent deterioration which has marked the federal
control of public lands since the time of Roosevelt, President Hoover and
Secretary Wilbur arc searching for a solution to the problem. "Enlight
ened local self-interest is most likely to bring about the greatest protection
of our valuable watersheds," Secretary Wilbur feels.
The battle is one which must be pushed determinedly. California
farmers successfully fought the placer miners when they were covering
valley lands with debris. The contest for conservation assumes national
proportions now. And the next generation will know whether conserva
tion or devastation will emerge victorious.
