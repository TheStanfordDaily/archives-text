"THE GIRL FROM HAVANA"—At
the Varsity Theatre.
Are you feeling very, very naive this
evening? If so, you will enjoy "The
Girl from Havana." But remember
you will have to believe in Santa
Claus, The Three Bears, Prince
Charming, and all the time-worn hack
plots in filmdom. It's a crook picture
and it has a first-class chase with
sound effects.
You will gush with sympathy for
the girl detective (and wnat a honey
she is! I mean she actually is). The
poor girl finds that the handsome
steward on board the boat is "in
league with" the crooks. And you'll
be surprised when you find that he
really isn't one of those dirty crooks,
but that he is . . . But there! I'm
spoiling the story. You must go to
hear the plot creak for itself.
Better is the short talkie skit, "Dan
gerous Females," featuring Polly
Moran and Marie Dressier. Comedy in
characterization and dialogue. These
two old favorites bid fair to rival the
Laurel-Hardy combination of good,
clean fun.
And better still is the talkie news
reel featuring the Stanford freshmen
manfully passing wood to build the
Bonfire and lustily singing "Come
Join the Band." And were they just
a little flat? Well, just a little!

PULPIT—At Blanding Sloan Puppet
Theatre.
The recent revival of interest in
the use of puppets as a means of pre
senting serious drama has resulted
in a number of puppet theatres being
built in various cities throughout the
country. The best-known in San Fran
cisco is the Blanding Sloan Puppet
Theatre at 718 Montgomery Street.
In a tiny little theatre with a stage
not more than eight feet across, the
Blanding Sloan Puppet Theatre Asso
ciation is presenting plays which in
dramatic quality and effectiveness of
sets approach productions in legiti
mate playhouses.
The current attraction is "Pulpit,"
a four-act play by Lee Gunter. It
portrays a proud, arrogant, evangelis
tic minister who is properly humbled
by imaginary experiences he under
goes while hypnotized. Although a bit
trite in itself, the plot gives an op

portunity for a number of very strik
ing sets. This, and the effectiveness
with which the lines are read, make
the play well worth while.
A church, during a severe storm,
is the scene of the first act, with the
preacher exhorting his followers to
repent lest they suffer hell-fire. The
second is in an African forest, the
third in a Malay jungle, and the last
represents the trial of Christ. Each
set is constructed and lighted in a
manner which reminds one of Harold
Helvenston and his overcoming of
handicaps in the Stanford Assembly
Hall. The sets, which are constructed
of cardboard, are lighted entirely from
behind, producing a silhouette effect
which is impressionistic rather than
realistic. All of them, viewed from
backstage, seem almost absurdly
crude, showing little promise of the
beauty they later present.
At the end of the performance, the
audience is invited to inspect the pup
pets and the theatre, and to visit the
puppet workshop around the corner.
"Pulpit" is presented only on Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday nights. The
run ends December 7.

THE VIRGINIAN—At The New Stan
ford.
Lean, steel-eyed Gary Cooper
slouches magnificently through this
show, and gives such a good perform
ance that the inanities of Mary Brian
can be overlooked. As the schoolmis
tress who captures the heart o'f the
cowboy from Virginia, Mary Brian
manages to be decorative enough, but
that is all.
Gary Cooper, however, makes the
most of a rather limited hole. There
are no fine heights to the picture, and
this is a decided shame, for Owen
Wister's novel undoubtedly offered
plenty of material. But somewhere the
essential force is lacking, and the re
sult is an agreeable entertainment
minus the real thrill.
To claim that "The Virginian" is
an unusually satisfying picture seems
inconsistent. Yet the exceptional
sound effects perhaps justify this
criticism. The sound of hard-ridden
horses, of beer bottles for instance, is
amazingly harmonious and apt. And
when Gary Cooper does anything more
than walk across the street, the effect
is gratifying. —M. L. R.
