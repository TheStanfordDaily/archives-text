A decision was made for a uniform
award of a cardinal sweater with
eight-inch white numerals for fresh
man football players by the Athletic
Committee, and thirteen men, those
who played in the Stanford-California
game, were awarded Block "S" sweat
ers, and the rest of the squad second
team sweaters with the black Ger
man "S."
Roble Club gave an enjoyable dance
in the Roble Gymnasium, starting at
7:30 and ending at 12 midnight. Japa
nese lanterns and umbrellas were
hung from the ceiling giving an orien
tal effect, while college pennants and
holly decorated the sides and relieved
the barren corners, giving a distinc
tive college tone.

Varied, yes, quite varied.
The play committee working on the
English Club's coming play, "Every
man in His Humor," met and adopted
plans for organization. The Club de
cided October 26 to present a play
sometime during the year.
Ah, now for some action.
