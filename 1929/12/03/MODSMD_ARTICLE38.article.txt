The Editor, Sir:
"A GROUP OP SPONSORS (ap
pointed by Council and their number
determined by Council, said appoint
ment subject to the approval of the
President of the University)."
Absolutism ill befits Stanford Uni
versity.
Yet what other name could so well
describe that part of the new A.W.S.
constitution given above. When one
per cent of the women students are
given the complete power to select
the women who will serve as spon
sors for the freshmen in fall quarter,
with the mere formality of the Presi
dent's approval, it is indeed approach
ing that freedom from external re
straint which characterized the Louis'
in France.
That sponsors perform an invalu
able service in adjusting the new
women to the customs and life of the
University is undeniable. Therefore
it is all the more necessary that the
best possible mothod of selecting
those fifteen or twenty women (the
number is determined by Council)
who are best representative and capa
ble of filling the offices be found.
This is a radical departure from the
old method of choosing sponsors. Be
fore, the living groups sent in their
nominations, and *he choice was made
with those as a basis. The new
method, if passed, will give power
for the most important selection that
the women make in the year to a
group of five women—who, while sup
posedly are still human
enough to have their own personal
prejudices, and to represent to a
somewhat limited extent the view
point of the "geographical" division
of the campus from which they come.
It has been known to happen that
four out of five members of Council
have come from one house.
In anything as important as the

selection of sponsors, there should be
a much more representative group
which makes the choice. Under this
new method, the houses have abso
lutely nothing to say, Roble has abso
lutely nothing to say, Miss Yost has
absolutely nothing to say, the older
sponsors make a report, and an ut
terly inexperienced body — the new
Women's Council for the next year
(not more than two of them could be
experienced at all) is given practi
cally absolute power for making the
most important decision in women's
government.
Therefore, in view of the fact that
any group of five has its limitations
and its prejudices, and that there are
many other groups which have a right
to have some say about the choice
of sponsors, it seems to me that this
part of the A.W.S. constitution should
be altered to make way for some more
suitable method of electing or ap
pointing such important people as
sponsors. —Vox Populi.

Yet what other name could so well
describe that part of the new A.W.S.
constitution given above. When one
per cent of the women students are
given the complete power to select
the women who will serve as spon
sors for the freshmen in fall quarter,
with the mere formality of the Presi
dent's approval, it is indeed approach
ing that freedom from external re
straint which characterized the Louis'
in France.
That sponsors perform an invalu
able service in adjusting the new
women to the customs and life of the
University is undeniable. Therefore
it is all the more necessary that the
best possible mothod of selecting
those fifteen or twenty women (the
number is determined by Council)
who are best representative and capa
ble of filling the offices be found.
This is a radical departure from the
old method of choosing sponsors. Be
fore, the living groups sent in their
nominations, and *he choice was made
with those as a basis. The new
method, if passed, will give power
for the most important selection that
the women make in the year to a
group of five women—who, while sup
posedly are still human
enough to have their own personal
prejudices, and to represent to a
somewhat limited extent the view
point of the "geographical" division
of the campus from which they come.
It has been known to happen that
four out of five members of Council
have come from one house.
In anything as important as the

selection of sponsors, there should be
a much more representative group
which makes the choice. Under this
new method, the houses have abso
lutely nothing to say, Roble has abso
lutely nothing to say, Miss Yost has
absolutely nothing to say, the older
sponsors make a report, and an ut
terly inexperienced body — the new
Women's Council for the next year
(not more than two of them could be
experienced at all) is given practi
cally absolute power for making the
most important decision in women's
government.
Therefore, in view of the fact that
any group of five has its limitations
and its prejudices, and that there are
many other groups which have a right
to have some say about the choice
of sponsors, it seems to me that this
part of the A.W.S. constitution should
be altered to make way for some more
suitable method of electing or ap
pointing such important people as
sponsors. —Vox Populi.
