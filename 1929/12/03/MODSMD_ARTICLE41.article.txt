THE ALL-AMERICAN FARCE
Once again the great American
tragedy takes a back seat, for the
still greater annual all-American
farce is on! Once again sneers
and jeers are mixed with cheers
as caste after caste of all-star
pigskin chasers are ballyhooed
from Coast to Coast as THE ALL
AMERICAN TEAM of 1929!
It seems that each fall —Immedi-
ate,ly after the various conference
titleholders have cinched their covet
ed places, the moleskins have been
fumigated, the last goal posts have
been broken up into kindling wood,
and the subsidized players have be
come mere honest wage-earners once
more —this same comedy is repeated,
for although each and every sports
writer, coach, and peanut butcher in
the land selects his team with great
care and in all earnestness, the net
results are invariably greeted with
roars of hilarious mirth.
No Two Teams Alike
The most laughable part about the
whole thing is that no two teams are
alike. A star and .hero on one selec
tion Is a dub and goat on the next
one. Joe Plunger is lauded by some,
booed by the others. Toughy Tackier
receives a gold watch from the New
York Moonshiners' Gazette, but does
not even get honorable mention on
any other mythical eleven. So it goes
for days and days, and then it gets
worse.
These teams are mythical all
right. In fact, it is a mystery that
they are selected at all!
Years and years ago, when there
were only about a dozen decent grid
iron squads in the whole world, the
picking of an all-American meant a
little something at least. In those
glorious times gone by only one man,
Walter Camp, the father of his coun
try as far is football is concerned,
chose the all-American eleven. His
was the selection that counted. All
others were frowned down upon as
frauds as well as the work of rattle
brained parvenus.
Camp's Teams
If Camp's choice could be called
humorous, it was at least a na
tional joke. All law-abiding citi
zens had the privilege of snicker
ing and thumbing their noses at
Mr. Camp. However, when they
did, which was seldom enough,
they had one good laugh and let
it go at that.
What a different spectacle exists
today! There are so many teams cho
sen by such a vast horde of critics
and all-wise numskulls that the foot
ball fans .and reading rabble literally
wear themselves out with prolonged
convulsions of tittering. Take this
year for instance. The laboring serfs
and financial squires have already
wasted away one week in fits of laugh
ter. If many more ail-Americans are
chosen, it is quite likely that a busi
ness depression will follow!
Why then are these mythical teams
chosen?
Similar to Beauty Contests
For the same reason that beauty
contests are held. All-American
ism is a sort of patriotism. As
hard as we common citizens may
try not to be and as much as we
may bluff ourselves into believing
that we are not, we can not in
any way dodge the fact that the
public is a fickle herd of hero
worshippers!
But at least the beauty contests
have one thing over these all-Ameri
can selections. The contestants at At
lantic City, etc., are actually viewed
by the judges. Beauty judges get a
real eye-full. And though we all laugh
at the foolishness of picking out mod
ern Venuses each year, the beauty
queens are really pips.
Quite to the contrary, the omnipo
tent choosers of ail-Americans never
see most of their selected players. The
pigskin kings are picked without as
much as a squint by the judges. They
are chosen purely by reputation and
hearsay. And if the best player in the
country goes to Podunk Ra Ra Nor
mal, he is not even mentioned. For
the critics are not interested in small
college players.
Publicity Essential
Just as public opinion on all
major questions is controlled by
the press, so are all-Americans
placed on their high pedestals of
comical glory through publicity!
A short glance at the New York

Sun's mythical outfit is enough to
prove in convincing fashion that all-
Americanism is a joke and that ail-
American teams are griping as well
as funny. Three Stanford men were
mentioned by the Sun, namely, Walt
Heinecke, Mush Muller, and Pete
Heiser. Walt was justly named on the
second squad, though the Daily, in
its most real yet comical earnestness,
thinks he should be on the first, while
Mush and Pete were placed 011 the
honorable mention list.
Now one doesn't wish to take
away any credit from Mr. Heiser,
for he has the makings of a first
class guard—some day. However,
this season he has not shown
much at ail and has been out of
the lineup most of the time be
cause of injuries. Yet, he is men
tioned over men such as Smalling,
Tandy, Moffatt, Frentrup, Fleish
hacker, and twenty others who
have displayed twice as much.
Laughable
Laugh? A pitiful sort, of a joke at
the most! The Sun's selection is one
that needs a nose-thumbing rather
than a snicker!
And so it goes, each new selec
tion funnier than the last. Even
Pop admits that all-Americans are
a bunch of tommyrot, and then
hurls himself headlong into the
torrent of pigskin farce. Yet, why
not? Everybody's doing it. And as
long as there is a demand for com
edy, there must be someone to
supply the jokes.
So let's prepare for bigger and fun
nier selections. It won't be long now,
and there is a surprise in each and
every mythical team. At all events,
laugh and show that you really ap
preciate the humor in the master
pieces of these ail-American jesters!

frauds as well as the work of rattle
brained parvenus.
Camp's Teams
If Camp's choice could be called
humorous, it was at least a na
tional joke. All law-abiding citi
zens had the privilege of snicker
ing and thumbing their noses at
Mr. Camp. However, when they
did, which was seldom enough,
they had one good laugh and let
it go at that.
What a different spectacle exists
today! There are so many teams cho
sen by such a vast horde of critics
and all-wise numskulls that the foot
ball fans .and reading rabble literally
wear themselves out with prolonged
convulsions of tittering. Take this
year for instance. The laboring serfs
and financial squires have already
wasted away one week in fits of laugh
ter. If many more ail-Americans are
chosen, it is quite likely that a busi
ness depression will follow!
Why then are these mythical teams
chosen?
Similar to Beauty Contests
For the same reason that beauty
contests are held. All-American
ism is a sort of patriotism. As
hard as we common citizens may
try not to be and as much as we
may bluff ourselves into believing
that we are not, we can not in
any way dodge the fact that the
public is a fickle herd of hero
worshippers!
But at least the beauty contests
have one thing over these all-Ameri
can selections. The contestants at At
lantic City, etc., are actually viewed
by the judges. Beauty judges get a
real eye-full. And though we all laugh
at the foolishness of picking out mod
ern Venuses each year, the beauty
queens are really pips.
Quite to the contrary, the omnipo
tent choosers of ail-Americans never
see most of their selected players. The
pigskin kings are picked without as
much as a squint by the judges. They
are chosen purely by reputation and
hearsay. And if the best player in the
country goes to Podunk Ra Ra Nor
mal, he is not even mentioned. For
the critics are not interested in small
college players.
Publicity Essential
Just as public opinion on all
major questions is controlled by
the press, so are all-Americans
placed on their high pedestals of
comical glory through publicity!
A short glance at the New York

Sun's mythical outfit is enough to
prove in convincing fashion that all-
Americanism is a joke and that ail-
American teams are griping as well
as funny. Three Stanford men were
mentioned by the Sun, namely, Walt
Heinecke, Mush Muller, and Pete
Heiser. Walt was justly named on the
second squad, though the Daily, in
its most real yet comical earnestness,
thinks he should be on the first, while
Mush and Pete were placed 011 the
honorable mention list.
Now one doesn't wish to take
away any credit from Mr. Heiser,
for he has the makings of a first
class guard—some day. However,
this season he has not shown
much at ail and has been out of
the lineup most of the time be
cause of injuries. Yet, he is men
tioned over men such as Smalling,
Tandy, Moffatt, Frentrup, Fleish
hacker, and twenty others who
have displayed twice as much.
Laughable
Laugh? A pitiful sort, of a joke at
the most! The Sun's selection is one
that needs a nose-thumbing rather
than a snicker!
And so it goes, each new selec
tion funnier than the last. Even
Pop admits that all-Americans are
a bunch of tommyrot, and then
hurls himself headlong into the
torrent of pigskin farce. Yet, why
not? Everybody's doing it. And as
long as there is a demand for com
edy, there must be someone to
supply the jokes.
So let's prepare for bigger and fun
nier selections. It won't be long now,
and there is a surprise in each and
every mythical team. At all events,
laugh and show that you really ap
preciate the humor in the master
pieces of these ail-American jesters!

THE ALL-AMERICAN FARCE
Once again the great American
tragedy takes a back seat, for the
still greater annual all-American
farce is on! Once again sneers
and jeers are mixed with cheers
as caste after caste of all-star
pigskin chasers are ballyhooed
from Coast to Coast as THE ALL
AMERICAN TEAM of 1929!
It seems that each fall —Immedi-
ate,ly after the various conference
titleholders have cinched their covet
ed places, the moleskins have been
fumigated, the last goal posts have
been broken up into kindling wood,
and the subsidized players have be
come mere honest wage-earners once
more —this same comedy is repeated,
for although each and every sports
writer, coach, and peanut butcher in
the land selects his team with great
care and in all earnestness, the net
results are invariably greeted with
roars of hilarious mirth.
No Two Teams Alike
The most laughable part about the
whole thing is that no two teams are
alike. A star and .hero on one selec
tion Is a dub and goat on the next
one. Joe Plunger is lauded by some,
booed by the others. Toughy Tackier
receives a gold watch from the New
York Moonshiners' Gazette, but does
not even get honorable mention on
any other mythical eleven. So it goes
for days and days, and then it gets
worse.
These teams are mythical all

they are selected at all!
Years and years ago, when there
were only about a dozen decent grid
iron squads in the whole world, the

country goes to Podunk Ra Ra Nor
mal, he is not even mentioned. For
the critics are not interested in small
college players.
Publicity Essential
Just as public opinion on all
major questions is controlled by
the press, so are all-Americans
placed on their high pedestals of
comical glory through publicity!
A short glance at the New York

Sun's mythical outfit is enough to
prove in convincing fashion that all-
Americanism is a joke and that ail-
American teams are griping as well
as funny. Three Stanford men were
mentioned by the Sun, namely, Walt
Heinecke, Mush Muller, and Pete
Heiser. Walt was justly named on the
second squad, though the Daily, in
its most real yet comical earnestness,
thinks he should be on the first, while
Mush and Pete were placed 011 the
honorable mention list.
Now one doesn't wish to take
away any credit from Mr. Heiser,
for he has the makings of a first
class guard—some day. However,
this season he has not shown
much at ail and has been out of
the lineup most of the time be
cause of injuries. Yet, he is men
tioned over men such as Smalling,
Tandy, Moffatt, Frentrup, Fleish
hacker, and twenty others who
have displayed twice as much.
Laughable
Laugh? A pitiful sort, of a joke at
the most! The Sun's selection is one
that needs a nose-thumbing rather
than a snicker!
And so it goes, each new selec
tion funnier than the last. Even
Pop admits that all-Americans are
a bunch of tommyrot, and then
hurls himself headlong into the
torrent of pigskin farce. Yet, why
not? Everybody's doing it. And as
long as there is a demand for com
edy, there must be someone to
supply the jokes.
So let's prepare for bigger and fun
nier selections. It won't be long now,
and there is a surprise in each and
every mythical team. At all events,
laugh and show that you really ap
preciate the humor in the master
pieces of these ail-American jesters!

THE ALL-AMERICAN FARCE
Once again the great American
tragedy takes a back seat, for the
still greater annual all-American
farce is on! Once again sneers
and jeers are mixed with cheers
as caste after caste of all-star
pigskin chasers are ballyhooed
from Coast to Coast as THE ALL
AMERICAN TEAM of 1929!
It seems that each fall —Immedi-
ate,ly after the various conference
titleholders have cinched their covet
ed places, the moleskins have been
fumigated, the last goal posts have
been broken up into kindling wood,
and the subsidized players have be
come mere honest wage-earners once
more —this same comedy is repeated,
for although each and every sports
writer, coach, and peanut butcher in
the land selects his team with great
care and in all earnestness, the net
results are invariably greeted with
roars of hilarious mirth.
No Two Teams Alike
The most laughable part about the
whole thing is that no two teams are
alike. A star and .hero on one selec
tion Is a dub and goat on the next
one. Joe Plunger is lauded by some,
booed by the others. Toughy Tackier
receives a gold watch from the New
York Moonshiners' Gazette, but does
not even get honorable mention on
any other mythical eleven. So it goes
for days and days, and then it gets
worse.
These teams are mythical all
right. In fact, it is a mystery that
they are selected at all!
Years and years ago, when there
were only about a dozen decent grid
iron squads in the whole world, the
picking of an all-American meant a
little something at least. In those
glorious times gone by only one man,
Walter Camp, the father of his coun
try as far is football is concerned,
chose the all-American eleven. His
was the selection that counted. All
others were frowned down upon as
frauds as well as the work of rattle
brained parvenus.
Camp's Teams
If Camp's choice could be called
humorous, it was at least a na
tional joke. All law-abiding citi
zens had the privilege of snicker
ing and thumbing their noses at
Mr. Camp. However, when they
did, which was seldom enough,
they had one good laugh and let
it go at that.
What a different spectacle exists
today! There are so many teams cho
sen by such a vast horde of critics
and all-wise numskulls that the foot
ball fans .and reading rabble literally
wear themselves out with prolonged
convulsions of tittering. Take this
year for instance. The laboring serfs
and financial squires have already
wasted away one week in fits of laugh
ter. If many more ail-Americans are
chosen, it is quite likely that a busi
ness depression will follow!
Why then are these mythical teams
chosen?
Similar to Beauty Contests
For the same reason that beauty
contests are held. All-American
ism is a sort of patriotism. As
hard as we common citizens may
try not to be and as much as we
may bluff ourselves into believing
that we are not, we can not in
any way dodge the fact that the
public is a fickle herd of hero
worshippers!
But at least the beauty contests
have one thing over these all-Ameri
can selections. The contestants at At
lantic City, etc., are actually viewed
by the judges. Beauty judges get a
real eye-full. And though we all laugh
at the foolishness of picking out mod
ern Venuses each year, the beauty
queens are really pips.
Quite to the contrary, the omnipo
tent choosers of ail-Americans never
see most of their selected players. The
pigskin kings are picked without as
much as a squint by the judges. They
are chosen purely by reputation and
hearsay. And if the best player in the
country goes to Podunk Ra Ra Nor
mal, he is not even mentioned. For

THE ALL-AMERICAN FARCE
Once again the great American
tragedy takes a back seat, for the
still greater annual all-American
farce is on! Once again sneers
and jeers are mixed with cheers
as caste after caste of all-star
pigskin chasers are ballyhooed
from Coast to Coast as THE ALL
AMERICAN TEAM of 1929!
It seems that each fall —Immedi-
ate,ly after the various conference
titleholders have cinched their covet
ed places, the moleskins have been
fumigated, the last goal posts have
been broken up into kindling wood,
and the subsidized players have be
come mere honest wage-earners once
more —this same comedy is repeated,
for although each and every sports
writer, coach, and peanut butcher in
the land selects his team with great
care and in all earnestness, the net
results are invariably greeted with
roars of hilarious mirth.
No Two Teams Alike
The most laughable part about the
whole thing is that no two teams are
alike. A star and .hero on one selec
tion Is a dub and goat on the next
one. Joe Plunger is lauded by some,
booed by the others. Toughy Tackier
receives a gold watch from the New
York Moonshiners' Gazette, but does
not even get honorable mention on
any other mythical eleven. So it goes
for days and days, and then it gets
worse.
These teams are mythical all
right. In fact, it is a mystery that
they are selected at all!
Years and years ago, when there
were only about a dozen decent grid
iron squads in the whole world, the
picking of an all-American meant a
little something at least. In those
glorious times gone by only one man,
Walter Camp, the father of his coun
try as far is football is concerned,
chose the all-American eleven. His
was the selection that counted. All
others were frowned down upon as
frauds as well as the work of rattle
brained parvenus.
Camp's Teams
If Camp's choice could be called
humorous, it was at least a na
tional joke. All law-abiding citi
zens had the privilege of snicker
ing and thumbing their noses at
Mr. Camp. However, when they
did, which was seldom enough,
they had one good laugh and let
it go at that.
What a different spectacle exists
today! There are so many teams cho
sen by such a vast horde of critics
and all-wise numskulls that the foot
ball fans .and reading rabble literally
wear themselves out with prolonged
convulsions of tittering. Take this
year for instance. The laboring serfs
and financial squires have already
wasted away one week in fits of laugh
ter. If many more ail-Americans are
chosen, it is quite likely that a busi
ness depression will follow!
Why then are these mythical teams
chosen?
Similar to Beauty Contests
For the same reason that beauty
contests are held. All-American
ism is a sort of patriotism. As
hard as we common citizens may
try not to be and as much as we
may bluff ourselves into believing
that we are not, we can not in
any way dodge the fact that the
public is a fickle herd of hero
worshippers!
But at least the beauty contests
have one thing over these all-Ameri
can selections. The contestants at At
lantic City, etc., are actually viewed
by the judges. Beauty judges get a
real eye-full. And though we all laugh
at the foolishness of picking out mod
ern Venuses each year, the beauty
queens are really pips.
Quite to the contrary, the omnipo
tent choosers of ail-Americans never
see most of their selected players. The
pigskin kings are picked without as
much as a squint by the judges. They
are chosen purely by reputation and
hearsay. And if the best player in the
country goes to Podunk Ra Ra Nor
mal, he is not even mentioned. For
the critics are not interested in small
college players.
Publicity Essential
Just as public opinion on all
major questions is controlled by
the press, so are all-Americans
placed on their high pedestals of
comical glory through publicity!
A short glance at the New York

Sun's mythical outfit is enough to
prove in convincing fashion that all-
Americanism is a joke and that ail-
American teams are griping as well
as funny. Three Stanford men were
mentioned by the Sun, namely, Walt
Heinecke, Mush Muller, and Pete
Heiser. Walt was justly named on the
second squad, though the Daily, in
its most real yet comical earnestness,
thinks he should be on the first, while
Mush and Pete were placed 011 the
honorable mention list.
Now one doesn't wish to take
away any credit from Mr. Heiser,
for he has the makings of a first
class guard—some day. However,
this season he has not shown
much at ail and has been out of
the lineup most of the time be
cause of injuries. Yet, he is men
tioned over men such as Smalling,
Tandy, Moffatt, Frentrup, Fleish
hacker, and twenty others who
have displayed twice as much.
Laughable
Laugh? A pitiful sort, of a joke at
the most! The Sun's selection is one
that needs a nose-thumbing rather
than a snicker!
And so it goes, each new selec
tion funnier than the last. Even
Pop admits that all-Americans are
a bunch of tommyrot, and then
hurls himself headlong into the
torrent of pigskin farce. Yet, why
not? Everybody's doing it. And as
long as there is a demand for com
edy, there must be someone to
supply the jokes.
So let's prepare for bigger and fun
nier selections. It won't be long now,
and there is a surprise in each and
every mythical team. At all events,
laugh and show that you really ap
preciate the humor in the master
pieces of these ail-American jesters!
