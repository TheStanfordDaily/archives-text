Sirs:
Upon the Stanford campus women
swarm. No co-eds these, but members
of that most efficient administrative
machine which enables President of
Stanford and Secretary of the Interior
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur to stand with
such grace with a foot on either side
of the continent. The Stanford Em
ployment Office and Dining Hall Sys
tem are chiefed and staffed by wo
men, the Registrar's Office and Li
brary have two men each directing a
staff composed almost entirely of wo
men, and in every nook and cranny
of Stanford, women secretaries write,
type, talk, phone.
At the head of all is a most remark
able super-woman, Miss Helen True,
de jure Secretary to the President,
but de facto President of Stanford in
the absence of Dr. Wilbur. Her chief
qualities: imperturbability and omni
science. She out-poker-faces that other
Helen of California, and she knows
instantly every rill of information that
affects or may affect the University.
Is there an unwise movement develop
ing in the student body? She touches
invisible button number one, and the
matter ends. Does a faculty member
sponsor a doubtful local issue? In
visible button number two avoids the
difficulty, and it is done so skillfully
that neither student nor faculty mem
ber holds the slightest rancor, nor in
fact quite knows how it all came
about. Although it is rumored on the
campus that Miss True's salary is one

that many a savant would be glad to
have, she lives most simply, and is
most human and unassuming. Her
work is a triumph for womankind.
As a graduate of a man-staffed
Eastern college, visiting Stanford for
the first time, its efficient women
staffed administration seemed to me
to be Time-worthy.

brary have two men each directing a
staff composed almost entirely of wo
men, and in every nook and cranny
of Stanford, women secretaries write,
type, talk, phone.
At the head of all is a most remark
able super-woman, Miss Helen True,
de jure Secretary to the President,
but de facto President of Stanford in
the absence of Dr. Wilbur. Her chief
qualities: imperturbability and omni
science. She out-poker-faces that other
Helen of California, and she knows
instantly every rill of information that
affects or may affect the University.
Is there an unwise movement develop
ing in the student body? She touches
invisible button number one, and the
matter ends. Does a faculty member
sponsor a doubtful local issue? In
visible button number two avoids the
difficulty, and it is done so skillfully
that neither student nor faculty mem
ber holds the slightest rancor, nor in
fact quite knows how it all came
about. Although it is rumored on the
campus that Miss True's salary is one

that many a savant would be glad to
have, she lives most simply, and is
most human and unassuming. Her
work is a triumph for womankind.
As a graduate of a man-staffed
Eastern college, visiting Stanford for
the first time, its efficient women
staffed administration seemed to me
to be Time-worthy.
