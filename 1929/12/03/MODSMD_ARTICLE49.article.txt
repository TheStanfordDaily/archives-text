"The Formation and Behavior of
Vortices in Moving Fluids" was the
title of a lecture by Dr. Ludwig
Prandtl, Director of the Laboratory of
Fluid Mechanics at the University of
Gottingen, Germany, yesterday morn
ing in the Machine Shop Lecture
Room.
Dr. Prandtl discussed the creation
of vortices in a "stream" by moving

in which they could be controlled. He
