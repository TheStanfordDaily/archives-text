# HOOVER ASKS FOR FEDERAL REFORMATION
## Presidential Message Gives Views on Tariff; Tax Reduction Urged 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3. (/p)—A
presidential message bulking with
recommendations for changes and im
provements in the functioning of the
federal government, was submitted to
Congress today by Herbert Hoover
who is just rounding out his ninth
month in the White House.
He presented his views on nearly
every major subject of controversy
which has faced the nation's law
makers in recent times and on the
problem that perhaps vexes them most
at the moment —that of the tariff —he
asked for quick action to get it out
of the way.
His desire for rates beneficial to
agriculture, and to a limited extent to
industry, were repeated and he urged
that a one per cent reduction in the
income tax rates applying to indi
viduals and corporations be effected.
Going down the line he asked for
transfer of major prohibition enforce
ment activities from the treasury to
the Justice Department; remarking
that the question of law enforcement
"is the most serious issue before our
people."
