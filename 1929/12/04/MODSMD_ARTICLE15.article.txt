# FOUR DISTINCT FEMININE TYPES TO BE PORTRAYED IN SOPHOMORE PLAY
## 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
Four distinct feminine types will
be played by members of the sopho
more class in "Cock Robin," to be
given in the Assembly Hall Friday
night. Elizabeth Erlin, Sandy Leib,
Tatty Baker, and Mina Hughes are
taking the women's roles in this mys
tery play by Phillip Barry and Elmer
Rice.
The part of Carlotta Maxwell, to
be played by Elizabeth Erlin, is one
of infinite possibilities. An attractive
young girl with a mind of her own,
she causes much disturbance among
the actors of the Cope Valley Com
munity Players because of her inten
tion to elope with Hancock Robinson,
the victim of the murder. In spite of
the typical parental protests which
are flung at her by her mother and
uncle, she adamantly proceeds with
her plans, in typical "girl" fashion.
Lieb Acts Part
The part of Mrs. Alice Montgomery,
a gushing matron whose chief inter
est is the Cope Valley Community
Hospital, is one which would ordinar

ily be hard to cast in a sophomore
class. Sandy Leib, as Mrs. Montgom
ery, makes a perfectly delightful cur
tain speech, "on behalf of the Cope
Valley Community Players and Hos
pital"; and remains throughout the
three acts a true clubwoman.
Patty Baker, a sophomore transfer,
has the part of Maria Scott, assistant
to George McAuliffe, director of the
company. With some very amusing
lines, she is a character who at times
seems to be of the utmost importance
in the solution of the murder mystery,
and one who always holds comic in
terest.
Character Differs
Helen Maxwell, the mother of Car
lotta, is to be played by Nina Hughes.
It is a role which contains several ex
cellent scenes and continued oppor
tunity for character work. Her scene
with Carlotta and Dr. Grace, her
brother, in which a realistic family
discussion on the subject of Carlotta's
elopement takes place, is particularly
good, as is also her later scene with
the doctor on the same subject.

with Carlotta and Dr. Grace, her
brother, in which a realistic family
discussion on the subject of Carlotta's
elopement takes place, is particularly
good, as is also her later scene with
the doctor on the same subject.
Four distinct feminine types will
be played by members of the sopho
more class in "Cock Robin," to be
given in the Assembly Hall Friday
night. Elizabeth Erlin, Sandy Leib,
Tatty Baker, and Mina Hughes are
taking the women's roles in this mys
tery play by Phillip Barry and Elmer
Rice.
The part of Carlotta Maxwell, to
be played by Elizabeth Erlin, is one
of infinite possibilities. An attractive
young girl with a mind of her own,
she causes much disturbance among
the actors of the Cope Valley Com
munity Players because of her inten
tion to elope with Hancock Robinson,
the victim of the murder. In spite of
the typical parental protests which
are flung at her by her mother and
uncle, she adamantly proceeds with
her plans, in typical "girl" fashion.
Lieb Acts Part
The part of Mrs. Alice Montgomery,
a gushing matron whose chief inter
est is the Cope Valley Community
Hospital, is one which would ordinar

ily be hard to cast in a sophomore
class. Sandy Leib, as Mrs. Montgom
ery, makes a perfectly delightful cur
tain speech, "on behalf of the Cope
Valley Community Players and Hos
pital"; and remains throughout the
three acts a true clubwoman.
Patty Baker, a sophomore transfer,
has the part of Maria Scott, assistant
to George McAuliffe, director of the
company. With some very amusing
lines, she is a character who at times
seems to be of the utmost importance
in the solution of the murder mystery,
and one who always holds comic in
terest.
Character Differs
Helen Maxwell, the mother of Car
lotta, is to be played by Nina Hughes.
It is a role which contains several ex
cellent scenes and continued oppor
tunity for character work. Her scene
with Carlotta and Dr. Grace, her
brother, in which a realistic family
discussion on the subject of Carlotta's
elopement takes place, is particularly
good, as is also her later scene with
the doctor on the same subject.
