Ignaz Friedman, celebrated Polish
pianist, will appear tonight at 8:15
o'clock in the Stanford Pavilion, in
the first A.S.S.U. concert of the 1928-
30 season. He will be soloist with
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra, conducted by Alfred Hertz.
Friedman's contribution to the pro
gram will be Liszt's Concerto in E
Flat Major. Famous as an artist of
great power and technique, he will
undoubtedly make the most of the
dramatic possibilities offered by the
concerto.
The orchestra will feature Richard
Strauss' Tone Poem "San Juan," music
descriptive of the bacchanalian disillu
sion and death of a searcher after
beauty. They will also play Mendels
sohn's Overture to "A Midsummer-
Night's Dream," Robert Schumann's
"Dance of the Nymphs and Satyrs,"
and Rimsky-Korsakov's "Spnaish Ca
price."
Friedman, who made an instantane
ous success in America nine years
ago, is known as one of the four great
contemporary Polish pianists. He has
also composed, arranged and edited
much music. He has made his own
editions of some of the principal
works of Liszt, Chopin, Bach, and
Schumann. His present tour of this
country follows a year of playing in
England, France, Spain, Arabia,
Egypt, and South America.
