# EMERSON PLANS TO SEND DEBATE TRIO TO EUROPE
## N.S.F.A. Invitation Asks For All-California Team From Stanford, California, S.C. Debaters Would Leave For England Next Spring To Meet University Squads 
### 
Stanford will make arrangements
for an all-California debating squad
to make a tour of England next spring
if plans now under consideration by
Professor James G. Emerson, Cardinal
debate coach, are carried out.
Professor Emerson yesterday re
ceived an invitation from the National
Students Federation of America, spon
sors of the recent Oxford tour of the
United States, to organize such a
team.
One man from Stanford, one from
California, and one from Southern
California will compose the squad un
der present plans. Emerson has al
ready sent telegrams to authorities
at the other two universities asking
their stand on the matter.
Under the N.S.F.A.'s suggestion, this
team would be sent to England next
March or April to meet several Eng
lish universities, with the possibility
that the tour might include debates
with schools on the Atlantic Coast as
well.
Indications were that the chief bar
rier to the project would be financial
in character, as the California institu
tions would be required to bear the
expense of the tour.
