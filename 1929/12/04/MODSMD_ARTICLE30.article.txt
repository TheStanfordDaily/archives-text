# STANFORD'S CONVENTION YEAR
## 
### 
In less than a month, Stanford will be the Mecca of stndent leaders
from 533 American colleges and universities. For the first time in its
history, the National Students' Federation will hold a Congress west of
the Mississippi. Stanford will play host.
Committees are hard at work endeavoring to make this convention a
memorable one. Problems of transportation, housing, program, bulletins,
entertainment are being solved by energetic students. But the campus
should be well aware that in its hands rests the general atmosphere of
cordiality which will greet the delegates.
Students from all parts of the nation will be here to visit that far
western institution made famous by Warner football teams, national track
champions, a mosaic-fronted chapel, a combination president and Secre
tary of the Interior, and a Herbert Hoover. To offer these student leaders
a sincere welcome, the "hello system" must be overhauled, for in it is the
big chance to "sell ' Stanford cordiality and hospitality to the N.S.F.A.
guests.
Making a Congress of this type a success is not the work of a moment.
It will demand constant vigilance and co-operation from the entire cam
p us from now until every delegate is well on his way home.
