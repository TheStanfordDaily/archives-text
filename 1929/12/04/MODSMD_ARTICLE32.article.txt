# GERMANY AGAIN PUSHES TO THE FRONT
## 
### 
In 1914 an autocratic Prussian military machine rolled across Belgium,
toward supremacy of the world. In 1918 a defeated, crushed Germany
signed the Armistice. Two years later the gaunt specter of German eco
nomic depression cast its sinister shadow of poverty, hunger, and misery
throughout a country, which only a short time before had basked in the
invigorating sun of world leadership.
Yet in 1929 we find Germany well on its way toward a relatively quick
recovery from the stunning blows of a World War defeat. Patriotic
Germans have every right to regard with satisfaction peace-time accom
plishments of their countrymen.
In recent announcements of Nobel prize winners for 1929, two Ger
mans were honored, Thomas Mann for literature and Professor lians
von Eurler-Chelpin for chemistry.
The round-the-world journey of the inimitable Graf Zeppelin, built,
manned, and commanded by Germans, was an epoch-making event of the
year. Of new flying records established during 1929, Germany made six
while United States and French fliers set up three new marks apiece.
The record-breaking dash of the Bremen across the Atlantic Ocean
was a 1929 marine accomplishment which adds another laurel to German
enterprise.
An airplane recently carried 169 passengers in Switzerland. It was
built and designed by German engineers.
Germany may have lost the war, but she certainly did win the peace.
Freed from the armament burdens of the treaty of Versailles, German
ability and initiative has been forced to express itself along the lines of
scientific and industrial advance.
