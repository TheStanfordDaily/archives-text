Great oaks from little acorns grow!
To test the authenticity of that well-known horticultural truth, con
sider now, gentle reader, that symbol of punctuation used to mark the
smallest structural division of the sentence. It is known to the unlearned
as the comma (,).
It is a well-known fact that millions of dollars have been lost and won
because that insignificant mark was omitted or misplaced in wills; and
that great laws have miscarried because a senator did not know his Eng
lish 2A.
In that estimable volume compiled by Mr. Webster, "The International
Dictionary," one may find a perfect example of the importance of the
comma's presence. Mr. Webster says that the comma is used "to set off
words, phrases, and clauses that are independent, parenthetical, and appo
sitional; as, 'Hail, Caesar!' "
Just think what that comma means! How perfectly silly "Hail Cae
sar!" looks. How finished, how smooth, how polished appears "Hail,
Caesar!" And all because of one teenie weenie mark. Yes, gentle reader,
nature is grand.
This all goes to prove—now, let's see —it goes to prove that commas
they will, the little things are what count. And in this connection we nomi
liate Mickey Mouse as the people's cinema favorite.
