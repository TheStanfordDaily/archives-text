# PLEBE LIFE AT WEST POINT NOT AN EASY ONE
## Military Academy Has Long Line of Traditions and Escapades Handed Down from Generation to Generation 
### CADET I.W. PORTER 
(Editor's Note. —This is the first of a
series of articles on the history and life
of the United States Military Academy
at West Point, prepared by cadets on the
staff of the West Point Pointer.)
"Duty, Honour, Country"—these
cherished traditions of the United
States Military Academy at West
Point, are known all over the nation.
But there is another, individual side
to the academic life that is not so
well known —its escapades, and its
"plebe" customs.
There are restrictions in the mess
hall, in barracks, and on the campus.
In the mess hall a plebe sits at at
tention while he eats. His eyes may
not wander more than seven inches
from the center of his plate; and he
must see that all of the upperclass
men at his table are properly sup
plied with food. In barracks a plebe
always removes his hat before enter
ing the room of an upperclassman.
He is restricted from using "Diagonal
Walk," a shortcut across the main
parade, and also from walking on
"Flirtation Walk."
Academy Romance
"Flirtation Walk" is the center of
many romantic episodes. It is merely
a winding path in the hills along the
river, but for generations it has been
just what its name implies—Flirtation
Walk. In a rather secluded spot is a
rock overhanging the walk. Tradition
says that this rock will fall and crush
any girl who refuses a kiss while
beneath it. There is no man in the
Corps at present who can say that
this is untrue.
It has been handed down as true
that when Edgar Allen Poe was a
cadet, he furnished the surprise ele
ment in the life of the Corps. On one
occasion it was announced that white

gloves would be worn to the next
formation. Cadet Poe complied with
orders and wore white gloves—and
nothing else.
At another time some enterprising
ymng gentlemen slipped out at night
and removed the reveille cannon from
its accustomed place. By some mira
culous engineering feat they hoisted
it on top of the academic building and
fired it off in the dead of night. It
took a detachment of Engineers al
most a week to lower the gun to its
original position.
Yearly Stunts
Enough of what cadets did in the
past. There are a few stunts that are
pulled year after year. Every year on
the morning of graduation, the entire
first class assembles in the area of
barracks (the quadrangle) and holds
an informal parade. The band leads
them around the area and they fol
low in any uniform they choose. The
uniforms range from two Victrola rec
ords, silk lingerie, and so forth, to
overcoats, boots, and wash basins.
A similar parade is conducted by the
cadets in summer camp on the morn
ing of the Fourth of July.
Unique Language
Years of relative isolation from
other student bodies has developed a
system of slang unique to the Corps.
For example, the word "soiree" is
used as a noun to mean "an unpleas
ant task," and as a verb to mean "to
inconvenience." It started back in the
dim ages when officers' wives used
to give evening parties where the
poor military guests suffered in gar
otte collars weighed down with gold
trolley cable. It soon came to be said
that anything unpleasant was as bad
as a "soiree."
