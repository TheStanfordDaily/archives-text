HENRY THE VIIITH. By Francis
Hackett. New York; Horace Liver
wright Co. $3.00.
"Who was King Henry the VHlth?"
This is the one question on English
history that everyone knows he can
answer. "The king who had six wives,"
you say, with utter confidence. "The
king to whom 'off with his head' was
a sort of by-word." But now an amaz
ing and brilliant book has been writ
ten denouncing this familiar concep
tion as a "vulgar and fatuous and
horrible illusion."
Francis Hackett refuses to let you
think of Henry the Vlllth as "a great
bouncing King Hal, who eats a baron
of beef, and cuts off his wife's head,
ha-ha, out of a big, jovial, exuberant
good humor." Instead Hackett pre
sents a portrait that is new, challeng
ing, tremendously moving—and tre
mendously convincing. His style is so
incredibly glittering and swift and
strong that only an excerpt from the
book can do justice to it, and to his
extraordinary command of words.
The following passage illustrates
the magnificent drama that Hackett
makes of history, and also the vigor,
depth, and keenness of his analysis
of historical occurrences:
"And as Henry was stirred to his
depths by Anne Boleyn, tossed out of
his habit by the surge of his feelings
and swept into currents the like of
which he had not conceived and the
strength of which carried him in wide
and baffling circles, he changed the
course of his nation in battling for his
life. He did not set out to be the
chartipion of the state against the
Church. It grew out of his predica
ment.
"Since we are all but tiny wheels
fitting into wheels of an order not
visible to us and barely apprehended,
there were times when the astonish
ing discordance between Henry's acts
and the large operation of human con
sequence about him sent a shiver of
anguished protest into the tragic
spaces; but these shrieks did not dis
may Henry, or divert him from his

obedience to his massive instinpts. He
sprang high and fell leaden, rebound
ing into history with that shocking
force of a completely sincere catas
trophe. And out of this catastrophe, in
exceeding pain, were born two more
or less legitimate children, Queen
Elizabeth and the Church of England."
It is impossible to use a gauge on
Hackett's performance. He' runs the
entire scale of writing—he goes in a
single page from writing that is sheer
beauty and glamour, to writing that
is sheer grossness. The one is as
overwhelmingly powerful as the other.
He shows us Wolsey, "walking in the
midst of putridity, with a perfumed
orange in his jeweled hands"; he
shows us theologians as "gray mon
sters who live by sucking the life
blood of religion, and writhe in their
chimeric and unending war"; he
shows us the world as "base, foul,
rude and brutal, snarling in its na
turalism, yelping in its statehood,
striving to hide its shame in satin
and to glorify its obscene vanity by
sticking a diamond in its shirt front"
—and a thousand other pictures equal
ly gripping, and equally ruthless.
The high-pitched, intense tone of
the book would cheapen a less power
ful work by making it overdramatio
and perhaps untrustworthy. But Hack
ett lifts his account above this dan
ger by his amazing sense of historical
balance and proportion.
Explicitly, each historical figure has
a definite contribution to make as a
vital, living character, but the signifi
cance of each is so finely emphasized
in relation to every other figure, and
in relation to history as a whole, that
the resulting picture—enormous can
vas though it is—possesses a clear,
unerring perspective.
Another excellent point is Hackett's
ability to portray the political situa
tions tied up inextricably with the
personal element, so that the clash of
dynastic ambitions, hatreds, and jeal
ousies find their parallel at every step
in the clash of personalities.

HENRY THE VIIITH. By Francis
Hackett. New York; Horace Liver
wright Co. $3.00.
"Who was King Henry the VHlth?"
This is the one question on English
history that everyone knows he can
answer. "The king who had six wives,"
you say, with utter confidence. "The
king to whom 'off with his head' was
a sort of by-word." But now an amaz
ing and brilliant book has been writ
ten denouncing this familiar concep
tion as a "vulgar and fatuous and
horrible illusion."
Francis Hackett refuses to let you
think of Henry the Vlllth as "a great
bouncing King Hal, who eats a baron
of beef, and cuts off his wife's head,
ha-ha, out of a big, jovial, exuberant
good humor." Instead Hackett pre
sents a portrait that is new, challeng
ing, tremendously moving—and tre
mendously convincing. His style is so
incredibly glittering and swift and
strong that only an excerpt from the
book can do justice to it, and to his
extraordinary command of words.
The following passage illustrates
the magnificent drama that Hackett
makes of history, and also the vigor,
depth, and keenness of his analysis
of historical occurrences:
"And as Henry was stirred to his
depths by Anne Boleyn, tossed out of
his habit by the surge of his feelings
and swept into currents the like of
which he had not conceived and the
strength of which carried him in wide
and baffling circles, he changed the
course of his nation in battling for his
life. He did not set out to be the
chartipion of the state against the
Church. It grew out of his predica
ment.
"Since we are all but tiny wheels
fitting into wheels of an order not
visible to us and barely apprehended,
there were times when the astonish
ing discordance between Henry's acts
and the large operation of human con
sequence about him sent a shiver of
anguished protest into the tragic
spaces; but these shrieks did not dis
may Henry, or divert him from his

obedience to his massive instinpts. He
sprang high and fell leaden, rebound
ing into history with that shocking
force of a completely sincere catas
trophe. And out of this catastrophe, in
exceeding pain, were born two more
or less legitimate children, Queen
Elizabeth and the Church of England."
It is impossible to use a gauge on
Hackett's performance. He' runs the
entire scale of writing—he goes in a
single page from writing that is sheer
beauty and glamour, to writing that
is sheer grossness. The one is as
overwhelmingly powerful as the other.
He shows us Wolsey, "walking in the
midst of putridity, with a perfumed
orange in his jeweled hands"; he
shows us theologians as "gray mon
sters who live by sucking the life
blood of religion, and writhe in their
chimeric and unending war"; he
shows us the world as "base, foul,
rude and brutal, snarling in its na
turalism, yelping in its statehood,
striving to hide its shame in satin
and to glorify its obscene vanity by
sticking a diamond in its shirt front"
—and a thousand other pictures equal
ly gripping, and equally ruthless.
The high-pitched, intense tone of
the book would cheapen a less power
ful work by making it overdramatio
and perhaps untrustworthy. But Hack
ett lifts his account above this dan
ger by his amazing sense of historical
balance and proportion.

He shows us Wolsey, "walking in the
midst of putridity, with a perfumed
orange in his jeweled hands"; he
shows us theologians as "gray mon
sters who live by sucking the life
blood of religion, and writhe in their
chimeric and unending war"; he
shows us the world as "base, foul,
rude and brutal, snarling in its na
turalism, yelping in its statehood,
striving to hide its shame in satin
and to glorify its obscene vanity by
sticking a diamond in its shirt front"
—and a thousand other pictures equal
ly gripping, and equally ruthless.
The high-pitched, intense tone of
the book would cheapen a less power
ful work by making it overdramatio
and perhaps untrustworthy. But Hack
ett lifts his account above this dan
ger by his amazing sense of historical
balance and proportion.
Explicitly, each historical figure has
a definite contribution to make as a
vital, living character, but the signifi
cance of each is so finely emphasized
in relation to every other figure, and
in relation to history as a whole, that
the resulting picture—enormous can
vas though it is—possesses a clear,
unerring perspective.
Another excellent point is Hackett's
ability to portray the political situa
tions tied up inextricably with the
personal element, so that the clash of
dynastic ambitions, hatreds, and jeal
ousies find their parallel at every step
in the clash of personalities.

HENRY THE VIIITH. By Francis
Hackett. New York; Horace Liver
wright Co. $3.00.
"Who was King Henry the VHlth?"
This is the one question on English
history that everyone knows he can
answer. "The king who had six wives,"
you say, with utter confidence. "The
king to whom 'off with his head' was
a sort of by-word." But now an amaz
ing and brilliant book has been writ
ten denouncing this familiar concep
tion as a "vulgar and fatuous and
horrible illusion."
Francis Hackett refuses to let you
think of Henry the Vlllth as "a great
bouncing King Hal, who eats a baron
of beef, and cuts off his wife's head,
ha-ha, out of a big, jovial, exuberant
good humor." Instead Hackett pre
sents a portrait that is new, challeng
ing, tremendously moving—and tre
mendously convincing. His style is so
incredibly glittering and swift and
strong that only an excerpt from the
book can do justice to it, and to his
extraordinary command of words.
The following passage illustrates
the magnificent drama that Hackett
makes of history, and also the vigor,
depth, and keenness of his analysis
of historical occurrences:
"And as Henry was stirred to his
depths by Anne Boleyn, tossed out of
his habit by the surge of his feelings
and swept into currents the like of
which he had not conceived and the
strength of which carried him in wide
and baffling circles, he changed the
course of his nation in battling for his
life. He did not set out to be the
chartipion of the state against the
Church. It grew out of his predica
ment.
"Since we are all but tiny wheels
fitting into wheels of an order not
visible to us and barely apprehended,
there were times when the astonish
ing discordance between Henry's acts
and the large operation of human con
sequence about him sent a shiver of
anguished protest into the tragic
spaces; but these shrieks did not dis
may Henry, or divert him from his

obedience to his massive instinpts. He
sprang high and fell leaden, rebound
ing into history with that shocking
force of a completely sincere catas
trophe. And out of this catastrophe, in
exceeding pain, were born two more
or less legitimate children, Queen
Elizabeth and the Church of England."
It is impossible to use a gauge on
Hackett's performance. He' runs the
entire scale of writing—he goes in a
single page from writing that is sheer
beauty and glamour, to writing that
is sheer grossness. The one is as
overwhelmingly powerful as the other.
He shows us Wolsey, "walking in the
midst of putridity, with a perfumed
orange in his jeweled hands"; he
shows us theologians as "gray mon
sters who live by sucking the life
blood of religion, and writhe in their
chimeric and unending war"; he
shows us the world as "base, foul,
rude and brutal, snarling in its na
turalism, yelping in its statehood,
striving to hide its shame in satin
and to glorify its obscene vanity by
sticking a diamond in its shirt front"
—and a thousand other pictures equal
ly gripping, and equally ruthless.
