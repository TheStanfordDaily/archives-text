Harris J. Ryan was appointed Pro
fessor of Electrical Engineering by
the University Board of Trustees. He
graduated from Cornell in 1886 and
had been professor of electrical en
gineering at Cornell since 1889. The
profes&or had already gained promi
nence from his investigations in the
improvement of electrical generators,
and the strength of gases under pres
sure.
Professor Ryan is still at the head
of the Stanford School of Electrical
Engineering after whom the Ryan
High Voltage Laboratory back of the
Frenchman's hill is named.

Violations of the unwritten rule of
no smoking on the Quad caused Presi
dent Jordan to publish an announce
ment asking students to respect and
enforce the ruling. The rule originally
applied to the Inner Quad, but when
the Outer Quad was completed, stu
dents started the habit of smoking in

the space between the buildings. That
was stopped, but men continued to
smoke on and about the Outer Quad,
until Dr. Jordan again requested that
the practice be abolished.
Three men from a list of fourteen
were chosen to comprise the fresh
man debating team. Professor A. M.
Cathcart and Dr. C. D. Gardner were
the judges of the tryouts.
The faculty defeated the freshmen
13-12 in a fast baseball game. The
professors batted in nine runs in the
first inning and never lost their lead.
