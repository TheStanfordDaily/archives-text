'WARE CARDINALS!
There is perhaps nothing so danger
ous in the realm of football as a
strong team with its back to the wall.
For that reason, adherents of the
Cardinal might do well to be a trifle
less certain of success when the topic
of the West Point Army game 011 Dec.
28 is brought up. For the Army, in a
last desperate effort to salvage its
season, will have its back to the wall,
and the Army is strong, this year's
record to the contrary.
A tie and three defeats in four
major engagements mar the
Cadets' season slate, but a closer
inspection of these games dis
closes the fact that, with a rea
sonable share of the breaks, the
Pointers might have emerged vic
torious in any or all of them.
Tied by Harvard
Early in the season, Red Cagle and
his cohorts tackled their first hard
assignment in the person of a fairly
strong Harvard eleven. With five min
utes to play, and dusk fast descend
ing over the playing field, the Cadets
held a 20-13 lead, and Coach Biff
Jones removed several of his star
defensive backs, including Cagle, Mur
rell, and O'Keefe. Then, with less than
a minute remaining, a Crimson quar
terback winged a prayerful pass into
the gloom, over the heads of the
Army's substitute secondary defense,
and into the arms of a waiting end.
The same quarterback deftly kicked
the extra point, and what had ap
peared a certain Pointer victory be
came a 20-20 deadlock.
Yale was next on the Army pro
gram, and it was the Cadets' misfor
tune to play the Elis on the day that
Albie Booth made his debut as Ail-
American material. A 13-0 margin
piled up in the first half was blasted
as Booth, playing an inspired brand
of football romped over, under, and
through the Army forwards for three
touchdowns and a 21-13 Yale triumph.
Before that game, and after it, too, he
was just another halfback. On his
showing in that one contest rests his
claim to national honors.
Break Aids lllini
Illinois, with a veteran aggrega
tion that had won the 1928 Big
Ten championship with ridiculous
ease, next took the Army's meas
ure, 17-7, but the soldiers were
dealt a staggering blow early in
the contest by one of the freak
iest of plays. Murrell, the Army
fullback, kicking from behind his
own goal line, got off a short
twisting punt that struck on the
20-yard line and then bounced
back into the end zone, where an
lllini end fell on the bail for a
touchdown. That play put the Army
in a hole from which they never
emerged.
The Notre Dame clash, last of the
Cadets' big games, is too recent to
need any rehashing. Suffice to say
that the team that was characterized
as the greatest Rockne product in
years was kept on the defensive for
four full quarters, and eked out a 7-0
win only because of the fleetness of
Jack Elder, a youth who steps the
hundred in 9.8 seconds when he is not
intercepting passes in the Notre Dame
backfield.
All of which is proof enough
that the Army is nobody's push
over, and that Cagle and Com
pany have a marvelous chance to
upset the Stanford applecart some
three weeks hence.

There is perhaps nothing so danger
ous in the realm of football as a
strong team with its back to the wall.
For that reason, adherents of the
Cardinal might do well to be a trifle
less certain of success when the topic
of the West Point Army game 011 Dec.
28 is brought up. For the Army, in a
last desperate effort to salvage its
season, will have its back to the wall,
and the Army is strong, this year's
record to the contrary.
A tie and three defeats in four
major engagements mar the
Cadets' season slate, but a closer
inspection of these games dis
closes the fact that, with a rea
sonable share of the breaks, the
Pointers might have emerged vic
torious in any or all of them.
Tied by Harvard
Early in the season, Red Cagle and
his cohorts tackled their first hard
assignment in the person of a fairly
strong Harvard eleven. With five min
utes to play, and dusk fast descend
ing over the playing field, the Cadets
held a 20-13 lead, and Coach Biff
Jones removed several of his star
defensive backs, including Cagle, Mur
rell, and O'Keefe. Then, with less than
a minute remaining, a Crimson quar
terback winged a prayerful pass into
the gloom, over the heads of the
Army's substitute secondary defense,
and into the arms of a waiting end.
The same quarterback deftly kicked
the extra point, and what had ap
peared a certain Pointer victory be
came a 20-20 deadlock.
Yale was next on the Army pro
gram, and it was the Cadets' misfor
tune to play the Elis on the day that
Albie Booth made his debut as Ail-
American material. A 13-0 margin
piled up in the first half was blasted
as Booth, playing an inspired brand
of football romped over, under, and
through the Army forwards for three
touchdowns and a 21-13 Yale triumph.
Before that game, and after it, too, he
was just another halfback. On his
showing in that one contest rests his
claim to national honors.
Break Aids lllini
Illinois, with a veteran aggrega
tion that had won the 1928 Big
Ten championship with ridiculous
ease, next took the Army's meas
ure, 17-7, but the soldiers were
dealt a staggering blow early in
the contest by one of the freak
iest of plays. Murrell, the Army
fullback, kicking from behind his
own goal line, got off a short
twisting punt that struck on the
20-yard line and then bounced
back into the end zone, where an
lllini end fell on the bail for a
touchdown. That play put the Army
in a hole from which they never
emerged.
The Notre Dame clash, last of the
Cadets' big games, is too recent to
need any rehashing. Suffice to say
that the team that was characterized
as the greatest Rockne product in
years was kept on the defensive for
four full quarters, and eked out a 7-0
win only because of the fleetness of
Jack Elder, a youth who steps the
hundred in 9.8 seconds when he is not
intercepting passes in the Notre Dame
backfield.
All of which is proof enough
that the Army is nobody's push
over, and that Cagle and Com
pany have a marvelous chance to
upset the Stanford applecart some
three weeks hence.
