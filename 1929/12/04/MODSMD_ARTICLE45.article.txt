When the Stanford alumnus comes
back to the Farm he will miss the
"dinky" and the old bridge, and many
traditions which have gone the way
of these two. However, if he tries to
evade the traffic and leaves the high
way, chances are that he may find an
old friend, Billy, who cares for the
campus sheep.
The flock of 1250 sheep, which are
at present on the Timothy Hopkins
estate in Menlo Park, belong to the
Associated Students. They were pur
chased in 1915, to graze on the golf
course which was then being built
near the site of the new one. When
war broke out, the golf course was
abandoned, but the sheep remained
to make the campus a veritable
"farm."
Billy, whose real name is William
McCullough, has herded the sheep
from the beginning. It is quite worth
while to climb over fences and walk
around sheep and dogs to visit Billy,
for he has known Stanford from the
early days. He delivered milk on the
campus for twenty years before his
present job, and during those years
he knew almost everyone 011 the cam
pus. "Times have changed," he grins,
when he tells of Roble co-eds who
used to ride in his milk-wagon with
him. Billy delivered milk to Herbert
Hoover and Dr. Wilbur. He affirms
that there couldn't be a finer man
than Dr. Wilbur.
