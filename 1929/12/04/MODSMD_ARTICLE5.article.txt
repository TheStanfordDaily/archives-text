# Webster Denies War Imminence In China Crisis

"Although Manchuria has been
called the great danger spot of the
world, I do not believe that there is
any danger of a great European war
coming out of it. At the present time
there is no condition there to produce
such a war," declared Professor
Charles K. Webster, member of the
British group at the recent conference
of the Institute of Pacific Relations.
In his lecture last night in the As
sembly Hall, Webster said: "Extra
territoriality and the Manchurian
problem were the two great burning
subjects discussed at the recent meet
ing of the Institute. Extraterritoriality
was a device which made possible the
establishment of European trading
agencies in Asia; established in China
by force of arms. China feels," he
stated, "that the abuses of extraterri
toriality are an intolerable invasion
of her sovereigntyâ€”an infringement
upon her right to be master in her
own house.
"Even though new courts and new
judges have been installed," he con
tinued, "they are not to be considered
as independent judges of executive
China. Civil war is still waging. No
definite result can be obtained imme
diately. Extraterritoriality can not be
entirely abandoned now. Such rights
may be abandoned in outside conces
sions as the first step in total aban
donment."
