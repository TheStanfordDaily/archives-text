# SPORTS OF 1929

### BY FEG MURRAY 
Capt. Biff Jones and the West Point
football team, which travels out to
California soon to meet Stanford at
Palo Alto on December 28, are re
lieved that Biff Hoffman and Bob
Sims won't be among those present
at the little reception to be put on
for the Kay-dets' benefit at the Stan
ford stadium. For Biff and Bob played
particular havoc with the Army team
last year, and Red Cagle was so im
pressed with Sims' great defensive
play that he made a special trip into
the Stanford dressing rooms to con
gratulate that young man. Well, Biff
Hoffman and Bob Sims are gone, but
one or two old friends, who took part
in that 26 to 0 lacing the Kaydets
received at the hands of Pop War
ner's Cardinals, remain — namely,
Fleishhacker and Frentrup. You've
heard a lot of "Thundering Herb"
Fleishaeker, so listen to some dope
on "Lightning Lud" Frentrup, the
"here he comes, there he goes" boy
of the Stanford team.
Hark back to the fourth period of
the Cardinals' sensational victory
over the Army at the Yankee Stadium
last December 1. Heinecke had just

| intercepted an Army pass (he was
'always doing that!). Then Frentrup
took the ball on a bad pass from this
i same Heinecke, juggled it a moment,
i just missed being tackled, started for
j the sidelines, then suddenly cut back
i and ran right through the whole Army
j team for the most spectacular touch
down of the day!
j In the Stanford-California game this
i year, the "Big Game' of the year on
1 the coast, Frentrup's work was equally
! sensational. Lud scored Stanford's
! first touchdown on a reverse in the
i first few minutes of play. Later in
i the game, when back to pass on two
! different occasions, he found all his
1 receivers covered and made specta-
I cular runs. He's slippery, this fellow
[ is, a regular Cagle.
Lud weighs 181 pounds, is 5 feet
j 11 inches tall, twenty-three years old,
j and lives in Berkeley, California, of
; all places for a Stanford man to come
from!
"Hello and Smile" week, sponsored
by the Bachelors' Club, was recently
I concluded at the University of Cali
| fornia with a rally.

The Army's Nemesis?
Capt. Biff Jones and the West Point
football team, which travels out to
California soon to meet Stanford at
Palo Alto on December 28, are re
lieved that Biff Hoffman and Bob
Sims won't be among those present
at the little reception to be put on
for the Kay-dets' benefit at the Stan
ford stadium. For Biff and Bob played
particular havoc with the Army team
last year, and Red Cagle was so im
pressed with Sims' great defensive
play that he made a special trip into
the Stanford dressing rooms to con
gratulate that young man. Well, Biff
Hoffman and Bob Sims are gone, but
one or two old friends, who took part
in that 26 to 0 lacing the Kaydets
received at the hands of Pop War
ner's Cardinals, remain — namely,
Fleishhacker and Frentrup. You've
heard a lot of "Thundering Herb"
Fleishaeker, so listen to some dope
on "Lightning Lud" Frentrup, the
"here he comes, there he goes" boy
of the Stanford team.
Hark back to the fourth period of
the Cardinals' sensational victory
over the Army at the Yankee Stadium
last December 1. Heinecke had just

| intercepted an Army pass (he was
'always doing that!). Then Frentrup
took the ball on a bad pass from this
i same Heinecke, juggled it a moment,
i just missed being tackled, started for
j the sidelines, then suddenly cut back
i and ran right through the whole Army
j team for the most spectacular touch
down of the day!
j In the Stanford-California game this
i year, the "Big Game' of the year on
1 the coast, Frentrup's work was equally
! sensational. Lud scored Stanford's
! first touchdown on a reverse in the
i first few minutes of play. Later in
i the game, when back to pass on two
! different occasions, he found all his
1 receivers covered and made specta-
I cular runs. He's slippery, this fellow
[ is, a regular Cagle.
Lud weighs 181 pounds, is 5 feet
j 11 inches tall, twenty-three years old,
j and lives in Berkeley, California, of
; all places for a Stanford man to come
from!
"Hello and Smile" week, sponsored
by the Bachelors' Club, was recently
I concluded at the University of Cali
| fornia with a rally.
