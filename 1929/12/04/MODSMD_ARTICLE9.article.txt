# A.W.S. APPROVES CONSTITUTION IN MODIFIED FORM
## Selection of Sponsors Is The Only Point Debated at Women's Assembly 
### 
Approval of the revised A.W.S. con
stitution was given by a 10 to 1 vote
at the Women's Assembly last night.
A second motion was passed to the
effect that the constitution as voted
upon should go into immediate use.
The consideration of the constitu
tion was carried on under the leader
ship of Maxine Cusliing, chairman of
the constitutional committee, who
read the draft as passed by conference
and answered any questions that were
asked.
Sponsor Selection
The method by which sponsors
should be selected was the only point
upon which there was considerable
disagreement. The constitution as
adopted provides that the sponsors
shall be appointed and their number
determined by Council, the appoint
ments to be subject to the approval
of the president of the University.
The objections revolved about the
feeling that if each living group did
not have a chance to nominate spon
sors, some women well qualified for
the office might be overlooked. It was
pointed out that the recommendations
of the outgoing sponsors, which are
taken into consideration by Council
in making the appointments, will do
away with any chance of prejudice or
geographical partiality.
New Office Created

tion, Benetta Merner, president of
A.W.S., announced that Jessie Flem
ing was appointed corresponding sec
retary, a new created by the
revision.
Elizabeth Ann Lynch, the official
