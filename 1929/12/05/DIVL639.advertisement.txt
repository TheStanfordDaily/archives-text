SLIPPERS 4®
Men are funny animals . . . certain things
they prize greatly they'd never buy for them
selves . . . They'd go without—unless some
considerate woman in their family, or who
may be in his family some day, takes the
initiative.
The year 'round comfort that goes with a
gift of slippers means a year 'round pleasant
reminder of the giver.
Daniel Green makes the slipper illustrated —which
tells all there's to be told about the quality. It has
a regular leather heel and soft leather sole—heavily
padded. Can be had in all Black, Brown with black
trim, or Blue with black trim.
$4.50
