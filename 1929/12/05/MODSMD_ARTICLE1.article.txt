WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 4
President Hoover informed Congress to
day that it would require more than four
billion dollars to run the federal govern
ment for the next fiscal year but in doing
so he presented encouraging figures on
Treasury finances and reiterated his rec
ommendation for a quick reduction in
taxes.
He submitted the first annual budget
for the Hoover administration, which
contained 1,504 pages with an accompany
ing summary. It called for appropria
tions of $3,830,445,231 and estimated the
outlay for the year beginning next July 1
at $4,102,938,700. At the end of that time
a surplus of $122,000,000 would be avail
able.
The appropriations were $145,696,000
less than for this year. A $200,(XX),000
appropriation for the Farm Board, to be
submitted later, and a $72,000,000 carry
over from last year, however, made up
the difference between the amount re
quested and the estimated expenditures
which covered all of the major projects
of the government.
Although he had recommended the 1
per cent reduction in corporation and in
dividual income taxes in his annual mes
sage, which was submitted yesterday, the
President devoted considerable space to
this subject in the budget message.
