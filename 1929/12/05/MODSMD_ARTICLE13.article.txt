# HERTZ LEADS SYMPHONY TO OPEN SERIES
## Ignaz Friedman With Hertz's Orchestra Plays Liszt, Strauss, Schumann 
### Jean Rosenberg 
Ignaz Friedman, with the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra directed
by Alfred Hertz, appeared on the first
A.S.S.U. concert of the season last
night in the Stanford Pavilion. In the
Liszt Concerto in E Flat Major, he
displayed the poetry and sympathetic
interpretation for which he is known,
and also amazed his audience with an
unexpected force and technique. Cer
tainly his listeners went away with a
realization of the aptness of his title,
"Colossus of the Pianoforte."
Alfred Hertz, as always the excel
lent musician and leader, conducted
the orchestra in a rather light but in
teresting program. The absolute pre
cision in which he has schooled his
men is not so surprising as the appar
ent unity of interpretative feeling
which they possess.
Richard Strauss' descriptive Tone
Poem "Don Juan" was less trite than
the rest of the program and was beau
tifully performed. The Mendelssohn
Overture to "A Midsummer-Night's
Dream" was saved from too much
sweetness; and Giorg Schumann's
"Dance of the Nymphs and Satyrs"
and Rimsky-Korsakow's "Spanish
Caprice" were entirely satisfactory.
