## 
### 
Hunting on the Stanford campus will
meet with determined opposition in the
future, and anyone apprehended shooting
on University grounds will be dealt with
summarily, according to a statement made
yesterday by Deputy Sheriff Fred Frehe.
To stop the invasion of hunters from Pe
ninsula towns who have been killing game
on the campus extra men have been put
on duty, Frehe said.
Since all Stanford property is a state
game preserve, hunting is illegal. Many
violations of the law have been reported
by residents.
Frehe initiated his campaign against
poachers Saturday when lie and Officer
John Olsen arrested John Bankiero and
August Consigliero for hunting on the
preserve. Consigliero and Bankiero were
each fined $25 Tuesday by Justice of the
Peace E. E. Hardy of Palo Alto.
