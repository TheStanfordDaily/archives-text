# Four Year Course Is Unsatisfactory Says Dr. Wilbur In Speech
## Stanford President Charges Fraternities to Acquire Greater Dignity 
### 
Like horse cars and gas lights, the
four-year college course was satisfac
tory twenty years ago, but has now
served its purpose and is dropping
out of the picture, is the opinion ex
pressed by lJr. Ray Lyman Wilbur
last week when addressing the con
vention ol' the National Interfraternity
Conference, according to recent dis
patches from New York City where
the session is taking place.
A.B. Unsatisfactory
The A.B. degree, with its four-year
course and sharp class distinctions,
explained Dr. Wilbur, "is too much for
the man who wants just an elemen
tary course and not enough for the
one who wants advanced work.
"The men who are going to be lead
ers of America,"the Secretary of the
Interior continued, "are not satisfied
with the old course and are going
further into the fields of medicine,
law, the other professions, and busi
ness. The institutions that are adding
professional schools and schools of
business will be the universities of
tomorrow, and the others will become
junior colleges."
"Appreciate Dignity"
Wilbur charged fraternities to "ac
quire more appreciation of human
dignity" if they wish to attract the
ever-increasing number of more ma
ture men coming to universities from
junior colleges. "Slapstick methods of
initiation must go," he declared.
"There is nothing better than a
good fraternity and nothing worse
than a bad one in the development
of youth," Dr. Wilbur declared. He
pointed out that many fraternities
had grown like "mushrooms" and that
their organization was often amateur
ish. "But they are established now,
and to dis-establish fraternities would
be likely to bring about something al
most approaching a revolution in
American colleges."
Praises Greek Council
Wilbur congratulated the Interfra
ternity Council, composed of graduate
members of the national fraternities,
as "most wholesome" in its effect, and
stated that they were working toward
the right direction with their empha
sis on scholarship. "However, real ef
forts to raise the general plane must
come from within the individual fra
ternities themselves."
Two hundred men from sixty-six na
tional fraternities and eighty-five col
leges attended the convention. Scott
Webster, president of the Stanford
Interfraternity Council, was the local
delegate.
