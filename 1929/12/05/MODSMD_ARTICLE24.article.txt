# POP RETURNS TO STANFORD AFTER SCOUTING ARMY
## Selects Ail-Americans With Coaching Board of Jones, Alexander, and Rockne Stiff Practice Sessions To Begin Monday to Polish And Perfect Card Offense 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Returning to the Farm this evening
from the East, where lie scouted the
Army-Notre Dame game and helped se
lect an ail-American team, Coach Pop
Warner will put the Cardinal football
varsity through its first intensive prac
tice tomorrow afternoon since the now
memorable taming of the Golden Bear.
Pop got a bigger eyeful than he had
expected last Saturday, when he shivered
through sixty minutes of hectic football
at the Polo Grounds to see the Kaydets
outplay the highly touted Ramblers from
South Bend for all but eleven seconds of
the contest. Before the game started,
Knute Rockne's Fighting Irish were huge
favorites to trample over the future gen
erals by a lopsided score. As it turned
out, Notre Dame was more than lucky to
win by a bare seven-point margin.
Army Reaches Peak
1 lie Army guns are once more boom
ing as they should, and elusive Captain
Cagle is harder to stop than ever. West
Point will be a much tougher outfit to
stop on the 28th than it was in the New
York roundup last fall. The Army Mule
is quite likely to pack a kick as potent
as that of the Thundering Herd, and, as
Stanford followers well remember, the
latter team possessed a brutal and vic
torious wollop!
On his way out West, Coach Warner
hopped off the train in Indiana and with
three other of the country's leading
coaches, Knute Rockne of Notre Dame,
Bill Alexander of Georgia Tech, and Tad
Jones of Yale, picked a mythical eleven
of gridiron kings. Although thousands of
others are chosen ,the ail-American se
lection of these four mentors is now ac
cepted as THE authentic one.
With the Old Fox as one of the Big
Four, it is quite likely that several Pa
cific Coast stars will be placed on the
mythical team, and there is a possibility
that Walt Heinecke or Mush Muller will
make the grade!
Light Card Workouts
For the past week, Tiny Thornhill and
Chuck Winterburn have been in charge
of the Card workouts, which have been
of a light nature. Pop's assistants have
contented themselves with keeping the
boys in shape, by holding touch tackle
games followed with short signal sessions.
But with Coach Warner back at the
helm again, stiff practices are in store for
the white-jerseyed varsity from now on,
in order to polish and perfect its offense
for the Army battle. Yesterday after
noon less than two full teams showed up
on the practice field, but the entire squad
is scheduled to report beginning Mon
day.

of gridiron kings. Although thousands of
others are chosen ,the ail-American se
lection of these four mentors is now ac
cepted as THE authentic one.
With the Old Fox as one of the Big
Four, it is quite likely that several Pa
cific Coast stars will be placed on the
mythical team, and there is a possibility
that Walt Heinecke or Mush Muller will
make the grade!
Light Card Workouts
For the past week, Tiny Thornhill and
Chuck Winterburn have been in charge
of the Card workouts, which have been
of a light nature. Pop's assistants have
contented themselves with keeping the
boys in shape, by holding touch tackle
games followed with short signal sessions.
But with Coach Warner back at the
helm again, stiff practices are in store for
the white-jerseyed varsity from now on,
in order to polish and perfect its offense
for the Army battle. Yesterday after
noon less than two full teams showed up
on the practice field, but the entire squad
is scheduled to report beginning Mon
day.
Returning to the Farm this evening
from the East, where lie scouted the
Army-Notre Dame game and helped se
lect an ail-American team, Coach Pop
Warner will put the Cardinal football
varsity through its first intensive prac
tice tomorrow afternoon since the now
memorable taming of the Golden Bear.
Pop got a bigger eyeful than he had
expected last Saturday, when he shivered
through sixty minutes of hectic football
at the Polo Grounds to see the Kaydets
outplay the highly touted Ramblers from
South Bend for all but eleven seconds of
the contest. Before the game started,
Knute Rockne's Fighting Irish were huge
favorites to trample over the future gen
erals by a lopsided score. As it turned
out, Notre Dame was more than lucky to
win by a bare seven-point margin.
Army Reaches Peak
1 lie Army guns are once more boom
ing as they should, and elusive Captain
Cagle is harder to stop than ever. West
Point will be a much tougher outfit to
stop on the 28th than it was in the New
York roundup last fall. The Army Mule
is quite likely to pack a kick as potent
as that of the Thundering Herd, and, as
Stanford followers well remember, the
latter team possessed a brutal and vic
torious wollop!
On his way out West, Coach Warner
hopped off the train in Indiana and with
three other of the country's leading
coaches, Knute Rockne of Notre Dame,
Bill Alexander of Georgia Tech, and Tad
Jones of Yale, picked a mythical eleven
of gridiron kings. Although thousands of
