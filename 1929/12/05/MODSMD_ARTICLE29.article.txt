# PROSECUTOR, COURT, AND JURYâ€”ALL IN ONE
## 
### 
Contempt of court, used as a weapon to stifle and suppress unfavor
able newspaper criticism of judicial actions, was condemned by Sigma
Delta Chi, national journalistic fraternity, at a recent meeting in Colum
bus, Missouri.
The meeting adopted as a resolution the following proposed amend
ment to be advocated as a statute law in the various states:
"Hie defendant in any proceeding for contempt of court is hereby
authorized to file with the court a demand for the retirement of the
judge sitting in the proceeding if the contempt arises from an attack
upon the character or conduct of such judge, and if the attack occurred
otherwise than in open court.
"Upon the filing of any such demand, the judge shall thereupon
proceed no further, but another judge shall be designated in the same
manner as provided in case of the approval of an affidavit or personal
bias or prejudice under the provision of the laws of the state. The de
mand shall be filed prior to the hearing in the contempt proceedings."
The amendment proposed by the national journalistic group is a
rational and just one. Under the present law in many states, the judge
who is criticized by the press and who wields his contempt of court
weapon can send the critic to jail, not only without a trial by jury, but
even without an appeal to any other judge for an impartial examination
of the facts of the case.
The criticized judge functions as combined prosecutor, court, and
jury all in one, which is not exactly in keeping with the American con
ception of justice.
