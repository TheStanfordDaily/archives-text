# COLLEGE LIFE ACCORDING TO THE MOVIES IS AS MYSTERIOUS TO US AS TO OTHERS
## 
### 
Professional dancing boys with bellbottom trousers and brightly col
ored sweaters perform an intricate act on the porch of almost any soro
rity, and the college movie is off. While other professionals get together
for some close harmony the sweetheart of the campus skips in to be the
center of attraction. Necessarily, she is awfully sweet, and says things
like "And How!"
Both the hero and the villain are stellar athletes, but the former is
good and clean. Their rivalry, to the accompaniment of songs and
dances, fills most of the next five reels. Finally the hero crosses the last
white stripe to win the game for Alma Mater, but more especially the
hand of the college belle; and thus the public get their insight into the
mysteries of higher education.
In an effort to right this apparent injustice, students at North Caro
lina College wrote to Will Ilays, declaring that a majority of college
films are false, and as such do injury to the college man and woman. Of
course there arc specific defects and ridiculing features which should be
eliminated, since motion pictures have such an enormous influence on
American thinking.
But producers would surely go broke if they presented a true picture
of college life. Only one out of ten college students can clog, and he
can't sing close harmony. There would be too much studying and too
little football season.
Besides, we can get as much fun out of a "collcge" movie as others
can—we have never seen anything like it where we come from.—Daily
Calif or man.
