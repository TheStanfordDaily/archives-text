# STATE'S CUSTODIANSHIP OVER PUBLIC LANDS IS ADVOCATED BY WILBUR
## Federal Control Permitted Steady Deterioration, Says Interior Head 
### 
Roosevelt fought for federal control
of public lands; now President Hoo
ver would reverse his policy, although
he, too, believes in conservation.
Secretary of Interior Wilbur, in a
recent article in the "Review of Re
views," emphasizes important argu
ments favoring state control versus
Uncle Sam's absentee landlordism.
The possiblo transfer of custodian
ship of public lands to the states is
considered "a conservation move of
major significance" by Secretary Wil
bur. /
"Lack of interest, of funds, and of
laws for proper control of the public
domain has resulted in great if not
irreparable damage to a considerable
portion of our heritage," Secretary
Wilbur believes. "Deterioration of the
public domain from the standpoint of
plant life has been persistent and
steady.
"Since this has brought about in
crease in floods and erosion, and de
crease in water-storage capacity of
the soils, more rapid sedimentation of
reservoirs, and the distinct decrease
in the water-holding and water-carry
ing capacity of the great watersheds,
it is a problem of primary importance
to the welfare of the country."
Water is the controlling factor in
the establishment of homes, com
munities, and cities throughout the
semi-arid, western part of the United
States, Secretary Wilbur states. "In
dustry must locate where there is a
dependable water supply or regular
stream flow."
"Persistent deterioration" has em
phasized the twenty years since the
public-land report under Roosevelt,
Secretary Wilbur states. He estimates
that approximately 190,000,000 acres
of land are under the general charge
of the public land office without the
slightest shadow of a program lor its
preservation as a range.
"Either the federal government
should have the laws and the funds
properly to protect and administer the
mountain tops, the deserts, and the
public lands in general, or the states
should assume this responsibility."
The very existence of valley life is
dependent upon the preservation of
mountain watersheds, Secretary Wil
bur maintains. "We must conform our
march with the orderly processes of
nature or we are bound to fail."
Although recreation has become of
of outstanding significance in the life
of the nation, few people realize the
great value of the mountains, Secre
tary Wilbur maintains.
"Storage of water is primary to all
reclamation. Water is the only key
that will unlock the desert. Enlight
ened local self-interest, it seems to
me, is most likely to bring about the
greatest protection of our valuable
watersheds."
Secretary Wilbur believes that the
time has come for the states to ab
sorb and manage their own local
problems. The major question is the
actual preservation of plant life of
present public lands, and not what
political unit or bureau shall have
control.
