# VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE COMMITTEE TO OFFER TEST FOR SCIENTISTS
## 
### 
Aspiring science students are of
fered an opportunity to get a line on
their scientific adaptabilities in a new
test being given by the Vocational
Guidance committee and Director of
Personal Research Karl M. Cowdery,
it was announced yesterday by
Charles G. Wrenn, secretary of the
committee.
Dr. D. H. Zyve, who took his Ph.D.
degree at Stanford in 1927, has been
working for the last two years on
what he calls Zyve's Test for Scien
tific Aptitude. The test is designed to
reveal a man's aptitude for scientific
work, especially in the physical sci
ences and in engineering. The test
was planned on the assumption that
each man has aptitude to do scientific
work to a greater or less degree, and
that this aptitude under the proper
training will become a marketable
ability.
If the tests show that the individual
has a smaller amount of ability for
his chosen work, he will find training
more difficult for that field of en
deavor.
The test will be given in the Regis
trar's office any Friday from 1 to 3
o'clock in the afternoon. Appoint
ments may be made at the Registrar's
window for other hours. A charge of
50 cents will be made for scoring the
test. The secretary of the Vocational
Guidance committee will supervise
the taking of the test, and will inter
pret the results for the subjects at
his office in room 164 J.
