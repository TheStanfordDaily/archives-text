"SHE COULDN'T SAY NO"—At The
President.
Charlotte Greenwood, with those
same long legs, is appearing in per
son —hack in her first, play for years
and years. And take this tip: save up
all your sorrows and go up to the
President Theatre. See Charlotte
Greenwood and die laughing.
Her play is about a stenographer
who,"through hilarious circumstances,
is forced to try a breach of promise
case. Her boss is away, so Charlotte,
with a "mandamus" here and a
"habeas corpus" there, is persuaded
to try the suit against the 80-year-old
small-town philanderer. "What can an
80-year-old man promise?" she de
mand when asked to take the case.
"She Couldn't Say No" is a real
farce. The first act is excellent, the
second act better, and the third —the
court room scene in which Charlotte,
as the impromptu lady lawyer, tries
the case against her boss who has
unexpectedly turned up as attorney
for the plaintiff—well, the third act
is even better than the first two.
The play is straight comedy, neith
er subtle nor suggestive. There are
three sets, a large and good support
ing cast, and first, last, and always
Charlotte Greenwood. Her individual
ity makes this the most downright
funny show Duffy has presented with
in the remembrance of this reviewer.
Bryant Washburn, ex-movie hero,
Is well cast as Charlotte's idol. He is
an excellent foil for Miss Greenwood's
antics. Edward McWade as Eliphalet
Potter ,the man who said "Mebbe"

when the village old maid asked him
to marry her, is an excellent character
actor. And Jane Morgan makes Pansy
Hooper, the instigator of the breach
of promise suit, a type you'll recognize
and roar at.
If you've ever seen Charlotte Green
wood of "So Long Letty" fame, you
won't miss this play. And if you'll
take real advice you'll phone right
away for reservations. If necessary,
do your Xmas shopping at Wool
worth's and see why "She Couldn't
Say No." —B. M.
RIO RITA—At the New Stanford.
In this dressed-up talkie adaptation
of the musical comedy hit, "Rio Rita,"
Bebe Daniels and "devastating loveli
ness" are practically synonymous.
Shimmering Spanish costumes, and
dreamlike Spanish settings set off
Miss Daniels' dark, vivid beauty in
credibly well. But it is the charm of
her voice singing slow, haunting melo
dies that will linger with you after
the show is over.
The glamorous backgrounds and
pageantry are about half of the show,
and the song hits, revues, and special
ties are the other half. Bert Wheeler
and Bob Woolsey in the comedy
scenes are great: they strike that
subtle point of lowness that is some
how awfully funny, when an inch
lower would be merely crass. Ignore
the melodramatic, musical-comedyish
intrigue over the bank robbery, and
concentrate on these two comedians,
and you will enjoy the picture.
