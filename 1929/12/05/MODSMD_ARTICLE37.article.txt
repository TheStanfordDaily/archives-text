# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD...
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF DECEMBER 5, 1904

Luther P. Burbank, world-famous
plant creator, was appointed special
lecturer in the science of plant cul
ture by artificial selection by the Uni
versity Board of Trustees. The Bur
bank potato, the Shasta Daisy, and
spineless cactus were among his plant
creations.
Negotiations were under way by the
Faculty Entertainment Committee
with a number of companies for per
formances during the next semester.
Among them were Paderewski, Kreis
ler, the Kreisel quartet, and Madame
Melba.
The laying of the cornerstone of
the new library was to be postponed
until the return of Mrs. Stanford from
New York. In the meantime, work on
the new gymnasium was progressing
rapidly. The huge 87-foot brick chim
ney was completed and the furnaces
which were to heat water for the

swimming pool and the showers were
installed.
The two new buildings were the
only ones on the campus that were
entirely demolished less than sixteen
months later in the 190G earthquake.
An effort was being made among
some of the men living in Encina Hall
to organize a mandolin club to be com
posed of men who played either the
mandolin or guitar.
An extensive investigation of foot
ball injuries by Professor Edwin G.
Dexter of the University of Illinois
and published in the Football Guide
stated that one college man in ten
plays football and only three men out
of 22,766 players had received fatal
injuries at football during the past
ten years.
