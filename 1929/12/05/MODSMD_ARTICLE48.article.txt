# BREAKERS, PHI KAPS IN MURAL FOOTBALL BATILE FOR TITLE
## Ward Edmonds, Fraternity Grid Star, Expected to Stop Hall Team 
### 
Breakers and Phi Kappa Sigma will
decide who will win the 1929 intra
mural football championship and
carry off for a year the silver football
trophy when the two sevens clash
on the frosh field this afternoon at 3
o'clock.
Judging from previous play of both
teams a flashy contest replete with
broken-field running should be dished
up for the spectators. If the Breakers
can stop Edmonds they should leave
the field victorious, for the fleet Phi
Kap back has been throughout the
season the keyman of his team's of
fense. The clubmen are not, however,
without their own speedsters, as
Carlsmith and Stan Cook can step
with the best of them.
On a basis of team play, the fra
ternity men are given the edge. Much
of Edmonds' effectiveness in past
games has been due to expert block
ing by his teammates. The Breakers
will have to watch Evans, a fast half
back who is on the receiving end of
most of Edmonds' long tosses, and
Lyons, Phi Kap center, who has been
a demon at snaring fast passes for
short gains.
