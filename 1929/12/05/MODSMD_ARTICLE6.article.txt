# Women's Gym Staff Favors Proposal Of Golf, Riding Courses
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford Women's
Physical Education Department have
expressed decided approval of the ac
tion taken by W.A.A. Board, in ac
cepting without reservation Dr. Bertha
Dyment's suggestion to include golf
and equitation classes in the regular
W.A.A. curriculum witli all necessary
fees listed as syllabus fees.
"I see no reason why both golf and
riding should not be added to our
schedule for this winter quarter if the
necessary details can be arranged in
time," said Dr. Dyment, head of the
department. "If the unanimous ap
proval shown by W.A.A. Board at its
meeting Tuesday night can be taken
as an indication of the attitude of the
majority of women on the campus,
these new additional courses should
be exceptionally successful.
Details Undecided
"Our faculty is carrying on a great
deal of work at the present time, and
I have not yet decided the best plan
for providing adequate instruction for
the new courses," continued Dr. Dy
ment.
When asked to state her opinion on
the earning of points for a block "S"
Dr. Dyment said, "There is no objec
tion insofar as I know to having
points for both class and all-star
teams awarded as in any other sport."
Bunting Favors Project
Miss Bunting, instructor in the de
partment, believes that practice tees,
putting greens, and driving cages for
golf instruction can be included as
part of the new athletic equipment.
"The whole question of adding new
classes involves administrative details
which have not as yet been worked
out, but which I think can be satisfac
torily arranged," was her statement.
"Several years ago," said Miss Bunt
ing, "when horses and instructors
were furnished through the courtesy
of the military training department,
classes in riding were carried on, but
these were discontinued because they
entailed too much extra work for the
military department. Similar classes
could, I believe, be arranged with a
suitable riding academy."
Mosher Commends Plan
Dr. Clelia D. Mosher, former wo
men's medical advisor, stated her com
mendation by saying, "I am heartily
glad to hear of the installation of
such classes as golf and riding in the
official curriculum because such ac
tivities can be carried on both during
and after college."
