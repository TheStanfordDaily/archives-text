# PLEBE'S LIFE AT WEST POINT NOT AN EASY ONE
## Lowly First-Year Men at Military Academy Respond to Beck And Call of Superiors with Alacrity 
### BY CADET T.W. CARRITHERS 
(Editor's Note—This is the sccond of
a series of articles on the history and life
of the United States Military Academy
at West Point, prepared by cadets on the
staff of the IVest Point Pointer.)
"You man!" Those are practically
the first words to come to a Plebe's
ear when he enters West Point. He
looks around to see if he is the one
being called, and nine chances out of
ten, he does not look in vain. For all
during the Fourth Class Year, from
the minute he enters until the last
company has passed in review at
Graduation Parade, the Plebe hears
the old cry, "You man!" I still have a
tendency to stop when I hear some
upperclassman call in this fashion.
I can remember my first day of
Pllebe life as though it were yesterday.
Being fresh from a small Middle-West
ern college and full of collegiate ideas,
I carried an ornamented green slicker,
a golf bag and a suit case, covered
with stickers. I was the last word in
the heydey of the times. No sooner
than I had walked through the fatal
Sallyport on the morning of July 1,
I was no longer the collegian but the
poor struggling Plebe.
I had said goodbye to the outside
world and had entered a new sphere,
as strange to me as might have been
Mars, a new sphere in which I must
learn a new language, a new outlook,
a new method of living, and most of
all, learn alone when I entered. More
than 360 others had come into the
Academy at the same time. Each of
us had this adjustment to make, and
most of us made it successfully.
Subject to Training
The first two months after entering
were given to strict training in mili
tary lines and in the customs of West
Point. We drilled, we heard lectures,
we had unofficial talks by those over
us, we asked questions, and gradually
we learned. We were learning to take
it and like it. Our little world was no
longer strange to us.
Duties? They are innumerable. It is
the Plebe's duty at meals to pour the
water, milk, tea, coffee, ,and anything
else pourable. He carves the meat,
sees that there is sufficient of every
thing on the table. At breakfast, he
must know and tell the "number of
days" to all important events. Woe
to the Plebe who knows not "How
many days till Graduation."
There are other various and sundry
things the Plebe must do but there is
little of the old system of hazing left.
We mean physical hazing. "Mental
hazing" by means of trick questions
is done, but even this is not consid
ered hazing for it is done in the spirit
of fun. No upperclasman will ever
touch a Plebe. It just isn't done.
Must Answer Questions
The Plebe must always be ready
to answer any question that comes
his way. And some of the questions
that are asked! The common ones
are: "Where are you from?" "What is
your P.C.S.?" (Previous condition of
servitude), and several others con
cerning his past history and present
status. However the majority are
usually dumb or startling, tending to
make the Plebe give a dumber an
swer.
The "recognition system" is what
governs plebe life. From the day he
enters until immediately after Gradu
ation Parade, the Plebe acts as a
pledge to a fraternity would during
initiation week. He is not known by,
nor does he know the upper classes.
That is, as a whole. He is called
"Mr. " and refers to indi
viduals of the upper three classes as
"Mr. " also. However, he
may be "recognized" by any men who
desire to know him. When he is recog
nized, the Plebe is placed on a social
equality basis with the man whom
he now knows and no longer sprinkles
his sentences with "air."
Classes Difficult
The academics of the Fourth Class
Year do not sound difficult. They con
sist of advanced algebra, plane and
solid geometry, trigonometry, plane
analytical geometry, French and Eng
lish, alternating. He also has physical
training each day, but this does not
require outside preparation. However,

Editor of Notes and Comments, The West Point Pointer

even if these subjects do not seem
hard to those on the outside, they
are, and this is what makes them so.
Before the Plebe entered here, in
other schools he spent most of the
time in classes, being instructed.
Here, the instructors hand out a
long lesson and the Plebe must teach
himself, for when he gets to class he
is expected more to recite and less
to be instructed. More than three
fourths of classroom work is recita
tion. This requires a new method of
study. That is what makes Plebe year
so hard, not the number of subjects
but the acquiring of the new way of
learning. The main cause of men fail
ing in a course is because they have
not learned how to study.
Many Diversions Allowed
However, that is the hard side of
Plebe life. There are many diversions
open to the Plebe. He can find time
to read, to visit the library. There
are always athletic events to see and
there is a Plebe team in every sport.
He is not allowed to go to the Satur
day evening hops, but there are al
ways moving pictures on these nights.
And over the week-end, he can escort
his visitors around the Post, and dine
with them at the hotel. There are
many pleasant things to do during his
spare time. And the Plebe has more
time of his own than any man of the
upper three classes.
The big time of the Plebe year is
Christmas. While the other classes
are on their ten day leave, the Plebe
is "at ease." His class runs the
Academy during that time. They fur
nish the acting cadet officers, have
hops of their own and are free to
wander around the Post. The Plebe
always meets young ladies at the
Christmas hops, and the social activi
ties of the week are always looked
forward to.
The five months till Graduation go
more rapidly than would seem. The
Plebe has new things to do and learn,
and by this time he lias his individual
method of doing the old thing, and a
good system of study. And so, the year
moves on until the grand time, June
Week, comes. This means practically
confinement to the Plebe. He is to
be seen and heard at meals and forma
tions only. But he knows that when
Graduation Parade comes at the end
of the week, he has passed success
fully through a year, meant to test
the best and worst in a man, a year
of the most strenuous mental and
physical building given in any school
of the country.

long lesson and the Plebe must teach
himself, for when he gets to class he
is expected more to recite and less
to be instructed. More than three
fourths of classroom work is recita
tion. This requires a new method of
study. That is what makes Plebe year
so hard, not the number of subjects
but the acquiring of the new way of
learning. The main cause of men fail
ing in a course is because they have
not learned how to study.
Many Diversions Allowed
However, that is the hard side of
Plebe life. There are many diversions
open to the Plebe. He can find time
to read, to visit the library. There
are always athletic events to see and
there is a Plebe team in every sport.
He is not allowed to go to the Satur
day evening hops, but there are al
ways moving pictures on these nights.
And over the week-end, he can escort
his visitors around the Post, and dine
with them at the hotel. There are
many pleasant things to do during his
spare time. And the Plebe has more
time of his own than any man of the
upper three classes.
The big time of the Plebe year is
Christmas. While the other classes
are on their ten day leave, the Plebe
is "at ease." His class runs the
Academy during that time. They fur
nish the acting cadet officers, have
hops of their own and are free to
wander around the Post. The Plebe
always meets young ladies at the
Christmas hops, and the social activi
ties of the week are always looked
forward to.
The five months till Graduation go
more rapidly than would seem. The
Plebe has new things to do and learn,
and by this time he lias his individual
method of doing the old thing, and a
good system of study. And so, the year
moves on until the grand time, June
Week, comes. This means practically
confinement to the Plebe. He is to
be seen and heard at meals and forma
tions only. But he knows that when
Graduation Parade comes at the end
of the week, he has passed success
fully through a year, meant to test
the best and worst in a man, a year
of the most strenuous mental and
physical building given in any school
of the country.

"You man!" Those are practically
the first words to come to a Plebe's
ear when he enters West Point. He
looks around to see if he is the one
being called, and nine chances out of
ten, he does not look in vain. For all
during the Fourth Class Year, from
the minute he enters until the last
company has passed in review at
Graduation Parade, the Plebe hears
the old cry, "You man!" I still have a
tendency to stop when I hear some
upperclassman call in this fashion.
I can remember my first day of
Pllebe life as though it were yesterday.
Being fresh from a small Middle-West
ern college and full of collegiate ideas,
I carried an ornamented green slicker,
a golf bag and a suit case, covered
with stickers. I was the last word in
the heydey of the times. No sooner
than I had walked through the fatal
Sallyport on the morning of July 1,
I was no longer the collegian but the
poor struggling Plebe.
I had said goodbye to the outside
world and had entered a new sphere,
as strange to me as might have been
Mars, a new sphere in which I must
learn a new language, a new outlook,
a new method of living, and most of
all, learn alone when I entered. More
than 360 others had come into the
Academy at the same time. Each of
us had this adjustment to make, and
most of us made it successfully.
Subject to Training
The first two months after entering
were given to strict training in mili
tary lines and in the customs of West
Point. We drilled, we heard lectures,
we had unofficial talks by those over
us, we asked questions, and gradually
we learned. We were learning to take
it and like it. Our little world was no
longer strange to us.
Duties? They are innumerable. It is
the Plebe's duty at meals to pour the
water, milk, tea, coffee, ,and anything
else pourable. He carves the meat,
sees that there is sufficient of every
thing on the table. At breakfast, he
must know and tell the "number of
days" to all important events. Woe
to the Plebe who knows not "How
many days till Graduation."
There are other various and sundry
things the Plebe must do but there is
little of the old system of hazing left.
We mean physical hazing. "Mental
hazing" by means of trick questions
is done, but even this is not consid
ered hazing for it is done in the spirit
of fun. No upperclasman will ever
touch a Plebe. It just isn't done.
Must Answer Questions
The Plebe must always be ready
to answer any question that comes
his way. And some of the questions
that are asked! The common ones
are: "Where are you from?" "What is
your P.C.S.?" (Previous condition of
servitude), and several others con
cerning his past history and present
status. However the majority are
usually dumb or startling, tending to
make the Plebe give a dumber an
swer.
The "recognition system" is what
governs plebe life. From the day he
enters until immediately after Gradu
ation Parade, the Plebe acts as a
pledge to a fraternity would during
initiation week. He is not known by,
nor does he know the upper classes.
That is, as a whole. He is called
"Mr. " and refers to indi
viduals of the upper three classes as
"Mr. " also. However, he
may be "recognized" by any men who
desire to know him. When he is recog
nized, the Plebe is placed on a social
equality basis with the man whom
he now knows and no longer sprinkles
his sentences with "air."
Classes Difficult
The academics of the Fourth Class
Year do not sound difficult. They con
sist of advanced algebra, plane and
solid geometry, trigonometry, plane
analytical geometry, French and Eng
lish, alternating. He also has physical
training each day, but this does not
require outside preparation. However,

even if these subjects do not seem
hard to those on the outside, they
are, and this is what makes them so.

There are other various and sundry
things the Plebe must do but there is
little of the old system of hazing left.
We mean physical hazing. "Mental
hazing" by means of trick questions
is done, but even this is not consid
ered hazing for it is done in the spirit
of fun. No upperclasman will ever
touch a Plebe. It just isn't done.
Must Answer Questions
The Plebe must always be ready
to answer any question that comes
his way. And some of the questions
that are asked! The common ones
are: "Where are you from?" "What is
your P.C.S.?" (Previous condition of
servitude), and several others con
cerning his past history and present
status. However the majority are
usually dumb or startling, tending to
make the Plebe give a dumber an
swer.
The "recognition system" is what
governs plebe life. From the day he
enters until immediately after Gradu
ation Parade, the Plebe acts as a
pledge to a fraternity would during
initiation week. He is not known by,
nor does he know the upper classes.
That is, as a whole. He is called
"Mr. " and refers to indi
viduals of the upper three classes as
"Mr. " also. However, he
may be "recognized" by any men who
desire to know him. When he is recog
nized, the Plebe is placed on a social
equality basis with the man whom
he now knows and no longer sprinkles
his sentences with "air."
Classes Difficult
The academics of the Fourth Class
Year do not sound difficult. They con
sist of advanced algebra, plane and
solid geometry, trigonometry, plane
analytical geometry, French and Eng
lish, alternating. He also has physical
training each day, but this does not
require outside preparation. However,

Editor of Notes and Comments, The West Point Pointer

even if these subjects do not seem
hard to those on the outside, they
are, and this is what makes them so.
Before the Plebe entered here, in
other schools he spent most of the
time in classes, being instructed.
Here, the instructors hand out a
long lesson and the Plebe must teach
himself, for when he gets to class he
is expected more to recite and less
to be instructed. More than three
fourths of classroom work is recita
tion. This requires a new method of
study. That is what makes Plebe year
so hard, not the number of subjects
but the acquiring of the new way of
learning. The main cause of men fail
ing in a course is because they have
not learned how to study.
Many Diversions Allowed
However, that is the hard side of
Plebe life. There are many diversions
open to the Plebe. He can find time
to read, to visit the library. There
are always athletic events to see and
there is a Plebe team in every sport.
He is not allowed to go to the Satur
day evening hops, but there are al
ways moving pictures on these nights.
And over the week-end, he can escort
his visitors around the Post, and dine
with them at the hotel. There are
many pleasant things to do during his
spare time. And the Plebe has more
time of his own than any man of the
upper three classes.
The big time of the Plebe year is
Christmas. While the other classes
are on their ten day leave, the Plebe
is "at ease." His class runs the
Academy during that time. They fur
nish the acting cadet officers, have
hops of their own and are free to
wander around the Post. The Plebe
always meets young ladies at the
Christmas hops, and the social activi
ties of the week are always looked
forward to.
The five months till Graduation go
more rapidly than would seem. The
Plebe has new things to do and learn,
and by this time he lias his individual
method of doing the old thing, and a
good system of study. And so, the year
moves on until the grand time, June
Week, comes. This means practically
confinement to the Plebe. He is to
be seen and heard at meals and forma
tions only. But he knows that when
Graduation Parade comes at the end
of the week, he has passed success
fully through a year, meant to test
the best and worst in a man, a year
of the most strenuous mental and
physical building given in any school
of the country.

of the United States Military Academy

staff of the IVest Point Pointer.)
"You man!" Those are practically
the first words to come to a Plebe's
ear when he enters West Point. He
looks around to see if he is the one
being called, and nine chances out of
ten, he does not look in vain. For all
during the Fourth Class Year, from
the minute he enters until the last
company has passed in review at
Graduation Parade, the Plebe hears
the old cry, "You man!" I still have a
tendency to stop when I hear some
upperclassman call in this fashion.
I can remember my first day of
Pllebe life as though it were yesterday.
Being fresh from a small Middle-West
ern college and full of collegiate ideas,
I carried an ornamented green slicker,
a golf bag and a suit case, covered
with stickers. I was the last word in
the heydey of the times. No sooner
than I had walked through the fatal
Sallyport on the morning of July 1,
I was no longer the collegian but the
poor struggling Plebe.
I had said goodbye to the outside
world and had entered a new sphere,
as strange to me as might have been
Mars, a new sphere in which I must
learn a new language, a new outlook,
a new method of living, and most of
all, learn alone when I entered. More
than 360 others had come into the
Academy at the same time. Each of
us had this adjustment to make, and
most of us made it successfully.
Subject to Training
The first two months after entering
were given to strict training in mili
tary lines and in the customs of West
Point. We drilled, we heard lectures,
we had unofficial talks by those over
us, we asked questions, and gradually
we learned. We were learning to take
it and like it. Our little world was no
longer strange to us.
Duties? They are innumerable. It is
the Plebe's duty at meals to pour the
water, milk, tea, coffee, ,and anything
else pourable. He carves the meat,
sees that there is sufficient of every
thing on the table. At breakfast, he
must know and tell the "number of
days" to all important events. Woe
to the Plebe who knows not "How
many days till Graduation."

ear when he enters West Point. He
looks around to see if he is the one
being called, and nine chances out of
ten, he does not look in vain. For all
during the Fourth Class Year, from
the minute he enters until the last
company has passed in review at
Graduation Parade, the Plebe hears
the old cry, "You man!" I still have a
tendency to stop when I hear some
upperclassman call in this fashion.
I can remember my first day of
Pllebe life as though it were yesterday.
Being fresh from a small Middle-West
ern college and full of collegiate ideas,
I carried an ornamented green slicker,
a golf bag and a suit case, covered
with stickers. I was the last word in
the heydey of the times. No sooner
than I had walked through the fatal
Sallyport on the morning of July 1,
I was no longer the collegian but the
poor struggling Plebe.
I had said goodbye to the outside
world and had entered a new sphere,
as strange to me as might have been
Mars, a new sphere in which I must
learn a new language, a new outlook,
a new method of living, and most of
all, learn alone when I entered. More
than 360 others had come into the
Academy at the same time. Each of
us had this adjustment to make, and
most of us made it successfully.
Subject to Training
The first two months after entering
were given to strict training in mili
tary lines and in the customs of West
Point. We drilled, we heard lectures,
we had unofficial talks by those over
us, we asked questions, and gradually
we learned. We were learning to take
it and like it. Our little world was no
longer strange to us.
Duties? They are innumerable. It is
the Plebe's duty at meals to pour the
water, milk, tea, coffee, ,and anything
else pourable. He carves the meat,
sees that there is sufficient of every
thing on the table. At breakfast, he
must know and tell the "number of
days" to all important events. Woe
to the Plebe who knows not "How
many days till Graduation."
There are other various and sundry
things the Plebe must do but there is
little of the old system of hazing left.
We mean physical hazing. "Mental
hazing" by means of trick questions
is done, but even this is not consid
ered hazing for it is done in the spirit
of fun. No upperclasman will ever
touch a Plebe. It just isn't done.
Must Answer Questions
The Plebe must always be ready
to answer any question that comes
his way. And some of the questions
that are asked! The common ones
are: "Where are you from?" "What is
your P.C.S.?" (Previous condition of
servitude), and several others con
cerning his past history and present
status. However the majority are
usually dumb or startling, tending to
make the Plebe give a dumber an
swer.
The "recognition system" is what
governs plebe life. From the day he
enters until immediately after Gradu
ation Parade, the Plebe acts as a
pledge to a fraternity would during
initiation week. He is not known by,
nor does he know the upper classes.
That is, as a whole. He is called
"Mr. " and refers to indi
viduals of the upper three classes as
"Mr. " also. However, he
may be "recognized" by any men who
desire to know him. When he is recog
nized, the Plebe is placed on a social
equality basis with the man whom
he now knows and no longer sprinkles
his sentences with "air."
Classes Difficult
The academics of the Fourth Class
Year do not sound difficult. They con
sist of advanced algebra, plane and
solid geometry, trigonometry, plane
analytical geometry, French and Eng
lish, alternating. He also has physical
training each day, but this does not
require outside preparation. However,

Editor of Notes and Comments, The West Point Pointer

even if these subjects do not seem
hard to those on the outside, they
are, and this is what makes them so.
Before the Plebe entered here, in
other schools he spent most of the
time in classes, being instructed.
Here, the instructors hand out a
long lesson and the Plebe must teach
himself, for when he gets to class he
is expected more to recite and less
to be instructed. More than three
fourths of classroom work is recita
tion. This requires a new method of
study. That is what makes Plebe year
so hard, not the number of subjects
but the acquiring of the new way of
learning. The main cause of men fail
ing in a course is because they have
not learned how to study.
Many Diversions Allowed
However, that is the hard side of
Plebe life. There are many diversions
open to the Plebe. He can find time
to read, to visit the library. There
are always athletic events to see and
there is a Plebe team in every sport.
He is not allowed to go to the Satur
day evening hops, but there are al
ways moving pictures on these nights.
And over the week-end, he can escort
his visitors around the Post, and dine
with them at the hotel. There are
many pleasant things to do during his
spare time. And the Plebe has more
time of his own than any man of the
upper three classes.
The big time of the Plebe year is
Christmas. While the other classes
are on their ten day leave, the Plebe
is "at ease." His class runs the
Academy during that time. They fur
nish the acting cadet officers, have
hops of their own and are free to
wander around the Post. The Plebe
always meets young ladies at the
Christmas hops, and the social activi
ties of the week are always looked
forward to.
The five months till Graduation go
more rapidly than would seem. The
Plebe has new things to do and learn,
and by this time he lias his individual
method of doing the old thing, and a
good system of study. And so, the year
moves on until the grand time, June
Week, comes. This means practically
confinement to the Plebe. He is to
be seen and heard at meals and forma
tions only. But he knows that when
Graduation Parade comes at the end
of the week, he has passed success
fully through a year, meant to test
the best and worst in a man, a year
of the most strenuous mental and
physical building given in any school
of the country.
