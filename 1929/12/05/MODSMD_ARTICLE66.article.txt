WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. (JP) — A
mountain-climbing, snow-fighting, hus
ky hero is wanted by the government
to carry its hardest mail route —Reno
Junction to Downieville, Cal. The
postoffice department has advertised
for just such a man.
The route goes upward 2000 feet
within a distance of five miles west
of the two of Sattley. The postoffice
inspector reported last winter the
contractor had to have 30 head of
horses at one time to maintain service
through snow and bad roads. The
contractor resigned.
