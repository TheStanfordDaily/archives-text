# NATURAL VOICE AND BEAUTY MAKE BEBE DANIELS TALKIE HIT
## 
### Ben Maddox 
Those old-timers who less than a year
ago predicted the eclipse of our old-time
screen favorites when they were called
upon to talk are kicking themselves down
six new streets. "Rio Rita," Ziegfeld's
great musical comedy hit, has become
the talkie sensation of the year. The diffi
cult prima donna role is sung by none
other than our old friend, Bebe Daniels.
When the erstwhile comic girl emerged
with the most beautiful voice yet recorded
in the studios, Hollywood was just as as
tonished as audiences arc. The Paramount
studio most of all, because they had had
Bebe under contract for years and then
when talkies came in they let her go
without even bothering to give her a
voice test. Mention of "Rio Rita" around
that studio now is—well, it just isn't the
thing to do!
Miss Daniels credits her unexpected
success to six people. Between confer
ences on her next picture, which, since
the discovery of her singing ability, will
be another singing-dancing show, she
said:
"When I was through at Paramount I
was stunned. I had begun as Harold
Lloyd's leading lady when I was four
teen. At twenty-eight I was said to be
finished. I couldn't understand that, be
cause I hadn't failed a talkie test. Then
Bill Le Baron, of the RKO studios, of
fered me a year's contract at my own
price. After we had both signed he said,
'And now, when would you like to take
a voice test?'
"His faith in me restored by confidence.
He gave me the chance to make good.
Henry Hobart, the director of 'Rio Rita,'
told me that the whole picture depended
on me. Harry Tierney, who wrote the
play, and Victor Baravalle, conductor of
'Rio Rita' for Zicgfield, had confidence in
me. My mother, my fiance [Ben Lyon]
believed in me.
"And my singing teacher —Signor Otto

I
j Morando. He discovered that I had a
: natural voice. Every day I practice an
hour and a half. My voice has improved
j even since 'Rio Rita' was made. It will
i be better in my next picture.
"To these six I owe ninety per cent of
|my talkie hit. They have given me an
j introduction to the world of music I
never knew existed."
When "Rio Rita" was released, Bebe
j was invited to star in the London stage
I version. "A great compliment, of course,
j but since the talkies have put-*new life
I into the movies 1 want to continue on the
! screen a few years longer. The stage can
. come later."
Her favorite talkie performers are
I Mary Pickford, Bessie Love, and Kay
Johnson.

on me. Harry Tierney, who wrote the

'Rio Rita' for Zicgfield, had confidence in

believed in me.

Those old-timers who less than a year
ago predicted the eclipse of our old-time
screen favorites when they were called
upon to talk are kicking themselves down
six new streets. "Rio Rita," Ziegfeld's
great musical comedy hit, has become
the talkie sensation of the year. The diffi
cult prima donna role is sung by none
other than our old friend, Bebe Daniels.
When the erstwhile comic girl emerged
with the most beautiful voice yet recorded
in the studios, Hollywood was just as as
tonished as audiences arc. The Paramount
studio most of all, because they had had
Bebe under contract for years and then
when talkies came in they let her go
without even bothering to give her a
voice test. Mention of "Rio Rita" around
that studio now is—well, it just isn't the
thing to do!
Miss Daniels credits her unexpected
success to six people. Between confer
ences on her next picture, which, since
the discovery of her singing ability, will
be another singing-dancing show, she
said:
"When I was through at Paramount I
was stunned. I had begun as Harold
Lloyd's leading lady when I was four
teen. At twenty-eight I was said to be
finished. I couldn't understand that, be
cause I hadn't failed a talkie test. Then
Bill Le Baron, of the RKO studios, of
fered me a year's contract at my own
price. After we had both signed he said,
'And now, when would you like to take
a voice test?'
"His faith in me restored by confidence.
