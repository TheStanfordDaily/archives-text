# Juniors, Sophs Win First Interclass Hoop Clashes
## 
### 
Interclass basketball began last
night in Encina gymnasium with the
juniors defeating the freshmen, 36 to
32, and the sophomores downing the
seniors by a score of 18 to 14.
The junior-frosli tilt was a nip-and
tuck affair, with each team forging
to the front after a desperate rally,
but in the end the superior experience
of the juniors put them in the lead
as the game ended. Weaver was the
mainstay of the winning five, and
played an excellent floor game be
sides sinking several shots in crucial
moments.
Broderick starred for the sopho
mores in an 18-14 triumph over the
seniors. The game was marred by
many fouls, with each side commit
ting their share of the offenses.
