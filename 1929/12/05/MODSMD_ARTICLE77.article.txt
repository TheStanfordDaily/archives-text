# HISTORY OF N.S.F.A. SHOWS DEVOTION TO IDEALS, CONVICTIONS
## Student Federation Is First Conceived by Lewis Fox of Princeton 
### Art McGarr 
An everlasting devotion to an ideal
and a firm conviction in the right
and influence of college men and
women in the working out of prob
lems and international affairs led one
man to conceive the idea of a national
federation of American students
which could exert some influence as
a group where scattered its influence
would be nil. The man was Lewis
Fox, and from that first group which
ho called together at Princeton in
1925 has grown the National Students
Federation of America which will hold
its fifth annual meeting at Stanford
the first four days in January.
Its purpose: "We would achieve a
spirit of co-operation among the stu
dents of the United States of America
to give consideration to questions af
fecting students' interests; we would
develop an intelligent student opinion
on questions of national and interna
tional importance; wo would foster
understanding among the students of
the world in the furtherance of an
enduring peace.". Peace and under
standing are the two main ideals to
ward which the Federation has reso
lutely set its steps.
But let us go back to 1925. The
World Court was the main subject
which interested the United States
at that time. Like many another
dreamer and seeker after world peace,
Fox thought that the World Court
would be a step forward in the march
toward international goodwill. A be
lief in the influence of student opinion
led him to extend an invitation to stu
dent leaders in the United States for
an Intercollegiate World Court Con
gress to meet at Princeton in Decem
ber of 1925.
The Congress met and incorporated
into itself the National Student Feder
ation which had been started by a
group of students of the University
of California. In the nursuance of its
objectives the Federation is organ
ized as a permanent working body
with an executive committee (formed
of three officers, six regional repre
sentatives, and two delegates-at-large,
seven standing committees, and sev
eral special committees. Through this
working body this student organiza
tion carries out its aims and ideals
in the matter of student opinion
throughout the world.
Since 1925 the N.S.F.A. has held
four meetings. Gaining strength each
year, it has today come to represent
the thoughts and opinions of foremost
student leaders throughout America.
Perhaps the greatest step forward
came in 1927 when the American

group aligned itself with the Confed
eration Internationale des Etudiants
at its annual congress held in Rome
in August 1927. Every country in Eu
rope has its national student union
and affiliation with these bodies has
led to an even greater possibility of
a future civilization. Since this is the
thought foremost in the minds of
civilized peoples of today it is only
natural that the N.S.F.A. should merit
the support and encouragement of
student bodies in the United States.

to give consideration to questions af
fecting students' interests; we would
develop an intelligent student opinion
on questions of national and interna
tional importance; wo would foster
understanding among the students of
the world in the furtherance of an
enduring peace.". Peace and under
standing are the two main ideals to
ward which the Federation has reso
lutely set its steps.
But let us go back to 1925. The
World Court was the main subject
which interested the United States
at that time. Like many another
dreamer and seeker after world peace,
Fox thought that the World Court
would be a step forward in the march
toward international goodwill. A be
lief in the influence of student opinion
led him to extend an invitation to stu
dent leaders in the United States for
an Intercollegiate World Court Con
gress to meet at Princeton in Decem
ber of 1925.
The Congress met and incorporated
into itself the National Student Feder
ation which had been started by a
group of students of the University
of California. In the nursuance of its
objectives the Federation is organ
ized as a permanent working body
with an executive committee (formed
of three officers, six regional repre
sentatives, and two delegates-at-large,
seven standing committees, and sev
eral special committees. Through this
working body this student organiza
tion carries out its aims and ideals
in the matter of student opinion
throughout the world.
Since 1925 the N.S.F.A. has held
four meetings. Gaining strength each
year, it has today come to represent
the thoughts and opinions of foremost
student leaders throughout America.
Perhaps the greatest step forward
came in 1927 when the American

group aligned itself with the Confed
eration Internationale des Etudiants
at its annual congress held in Rome
in August 1927. Every country in Eu
rope has its national student union
and affiliation with these bodies has
led to an even greater possibility of
a future civilization. Since this is the
thought foremost in the minds of
civilized peoples of today it is only
natural that the N.S.F.A. should merit
the support and encouragement of
student bodies in the United States.
An everlasting devotion to an ideal
and a firm conviction in the right
and influence of college men and
women in the working out of prob
lems and international affairs led one
man to conceive the idea of a national
federation of American students
which could exert some influence as
a group where scattered its influence
would be nil. The man was Lewis
Fox, and from that first group which
ho called together at Princeton in
1925 has grown the National Students
Federation of America which will hold
its fifth annual meeting at Stanford
the first four days in January.
Its purpose: "We would achieve a
spirit of co-operation among the stu
dents of the United States of America
to give consideration to questions af
fecting students' interests; we would
develop an intelligent student opinion
on questions of national and interna
tional importance; wo would foster
understanding among the students of
the world in the furtherance of an
