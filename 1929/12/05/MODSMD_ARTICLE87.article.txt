## 
### 
ST. JOHNS, N.F., Dec. 4 (/P).—No
trace of the nine fishing vessels which dis
appeared in the North Atlantic Ocean
during the terrific gale of last Friday
night had been found today by two
searching steamers, the Meigle and the
Boethic.
The Meigle has covered a 200-mile
course southeast of Newfoundland in a
vain attempt to discover the date of the
little fishing fleet with 70 persons that set
out for Bonvista ports. The Boethic is
conducting its search eastward.
Four women were among those on
board the missing vessels. The boats had
landed their summer catch of fish here
and, loaded with winter supplies, had
started for their home ports.
