# SOPH DRAMATIC 'DISCOVERIES' TO DO 'COCK ROBIN'
## Huneke, Mendenhall, Logan Featured in Mystery Comedy on Friday 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
Good tickets for "Cock Robin,"
the sophomore play, are still avail
able at the A.S.S.U. office and at
Sherman, Clay & Co. in Palo Alto.
Prices are $1.25 and $1.00.

All but two of the men's parts in
Friday night's performance of "Cock
Robin" will be taken by players new
to Stanford audiences; and every one
of them is a role packed full of char
acter and interest that always shrouds
the possible murderer in a mystery
play.
The part of Hancock Robinson, vic
tim of the murder which is committed
in the presence of ten people, wilL be
taken by John Huneke, who makes a
nice smooth fellow of Robinson. His
mistrust of the man supposed to play
opposite him in the duel scene of the
Cope Valley Community Players pro
duction, gives him excellent oppor
tunity for some fine work.
Ernest Mendenhall is taking the
part of Dickie Lane, who is cast to
play with Robinson in the duel scene.
As a former sweetheart of Carlotta,
the heroine, he is very attractive,
fully meriting the constant praise of
him which pours from lips of Car
lotta's mother and uncle. The part of
George McAuliffe, director of the com
pany of amateur players, will be taken
by Harry Lee Logan. One of the
freshest characters in the play, Mc-
Auliffe has everything of the experi
enced showman about him. Logan
achieves this air to a high degree.
Bromley K. Smith, who had a part
in the summer production of the "Ad
ding Machine" here, will play Julian
Cleveland, one of the players. Cleve
land takes complete charge of the
situation after the murder. Cary Odell,
who had a small part in Harold Hel
venston's marionette ballet in the
Football Gaieties, will play Henry
Briggs, the stage manager. His in
terpretation of the part is one which
adds a different an drefreshing ele
ment to the rest of the cast.
George Quigley, who was originally
cast as McAuliffe, will take Harry
Logan's first part, that of Clarke Tor
rence. Edward Girzi will play Dr.
Grace, uncle to Carlotta; and John
Jessup, another of the community
players, will be acted by William S.
Richards.
