What Will
1930
Mean For You?
If going into business, will it mean the
beginning of a long apprenticeship pe
riod — the trial and error method—which
possibly may never lead to success?
Or will it mean a year spent in prepara
tion for business —followed by a steady
rise to leadership?
If you desire the latter, Babson Insti
tute can help you.
Train for Leadership
To meet the demand for executive train
ing as a foundation for a successful busi
ness career is the purpose of Babson
Institute. Here you would be taught
the fundamental laws of business and
shown how to apply them effectively to
