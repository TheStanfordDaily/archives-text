# FIGHT FANS SEE CLOSE BOUTS AT NOVICE TOURNEY
## Smith, Stromquist Provide Real Thrills by Slugging Three Rounds to a Draw Fred Johnson Tallies Two Knockouts to Carry Off Light-Heavyweight Crown 
### Dick Friendlich 
Slugging toe to toe in a wild punch
ing spree for every minute of their
three-round scrap, George Smith and
Charles Stromquist, a pair of husky
iniddleweights, stole the show com
pletely and absolutely last night as
six University boxing champions were
crowned in the novice tournament in
the Pavilion.
At the end of the affair, which kept
a crowd of 400 spectators on their
feet throughout the entire bout,
Referee Pete Flanagan, announcing
a difference of opinion in the judges'
decisions, called it a draw, and award
ed silver championship medals to
each man.
Smith Wins First Frame
Smith won the first round by a
large margin, although Stromquist did
not yield an inch and fought back
savagely all the way. The second
round was almost even, but Strom
quist punched his opponent all around
the ring in the final frame to earn an
even break.
This whirlwind fight somewhat
overshadowed the other bouts, al
though most of them were packed
with action.
Jack Holwerda won a three-round
decision over Thad McNamara in the
heavyweight final in the slowest
match of the evening. Holwerda
staged a last-round rally to win the
nod.
Fred Johnson unleashed a terrific
overhand right to Otto Haight's chin
in the second round to spill the latter
to the canvas for the ten count in the
175-pound finals. Haight, boxing pret
tily, was leading at the time he ran
into the sleep-producer.
Craig Winner
Wally Craig won on a foul from
Dick Miller in the first round ot the
welterweight final. Miller was hand
ing his opponent a neat shellacking
when he sank a left hook in the re
gion of the belt-line and Craig crum
pled to the floor. Referee Flanagan
ruled Craig had been struck low, and
awarded him the palm.
Scoring a no-count knockdown in
the first round, Freddie Gist took a
three-round decision over C. C. Cut
ting in the lightweight mixup. Cut
ting made a game, uphill fight, but
Gist carried too many guns for him.
Jackie Jordan handed Lewis Page
an artistic lacing over the three-round
distance to win the decision and the
featherweight final. Jordan, a veteran
of two previous novice tournaments,
was simply too smart for Page, and
won hands down, although the latter
kept forcing the issue.
Eardley Victor
Carl Eardley staged a pretty exhibi
tion of boxing to take the nod over
Y. Imai in the bantamweight affair.
Eardley scored repeatedly with a stiff
right cross, and made good use of his
longer reach.
After the fights were over, Coach
Glenn "Pop" Warner, who returned
to the campus from an eastern trip
last night, awarded silver medals to
the winners.
The officiating was handled by
Wells Goodenough, Mort Blackburn,
and Curley Grieb as judges, and Fred
Frelie in the role of timekeeper. Phil
Moffatt, gridiron star, did the an
nouncing honors, with Pete Flanagan,
former amateur middleweight cham
i pion of Australia, doing a clean-cut
i job of refereeing.
