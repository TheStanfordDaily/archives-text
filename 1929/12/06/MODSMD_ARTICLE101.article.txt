# DOEG AND GLEDHILL LOSE DOUBLES TILT TO NATIONAL STARS
## Veteran Combination, Neer And Kinsey, Take Two Hard-Fought Sets 
### 
Once again experience dominated youth
when Howard Kinsey and Phil Neer
came down from San Francisco yesterday
afternoon and nosed out Johnny Doeg and
Keith Gledhill in a flashy, pounding ten
nis exhibition match before a crowd that
nearly filled the stands. The score was
4-6, 6-4, 8-6.
To Howard Kinsey, co-holder with his
brother Robert of a national doubles title
and conceded to be one of the foremost
professional players today, goes the cred
it of showing the finest doubles ability
of the day, with Gledhill, national junior
champion, running him a close se.cond.
Doeg and Neer both showed lack of prac
tice, though they sprang brilliant stroking
in close spots all through the afternoon.
Fast network and trickery furnished
the thrills, with Kinsey showing technique
and court-generalship that only a very
sound knowledge of the game can give.
Gledhill, whose beautiful overhead
smashes kept bouncing over the fence, is
undoubtedly one of the most promising
of the younger players today. He and
Doeg teamed up in doubles for the first
time yesterday, and they showed prospects
of a top-notch combination for next year
that should put in a strong bid for the
national intercollegiate title.
Both teams found it hard getting to
gether, but Kinsey and Neer soon devel
oped the more consistent co-operation.
The first set was all Doeg and Gledhill.
Kinsey and Neer pulled out from a 5-3
hole in second to win the set, and from
the same 5-3 handicap in the third they
were able to even the score at five-all and
pull out the last set at 8-6.
