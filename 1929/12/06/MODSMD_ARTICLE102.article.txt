# "MUSIC IN RUSSIA" IS SUBJECT OF LECTURE FOR TUESDAY SERIES
## 
### 
Mr. Henry Cowell, author of the re
cently published book, "New Musical Re
sources," will speak in the Assembly Hall
Tuesday evening, December 10, at 7:30
o'clock, on "Music in Russia." His lec
ture will be the last of a series of lec
tures sponsored this fall quarter by the
Committee on Public Exercises.
Mr. Cowell, whose playing of his own
compositions has created great interest
both here and abroad, will explain how
the arts have always been influenced by
the powers of state in Russia; and how
the Soviets, in trying to apply their prin
ciples, paradoxically have succeeded in
making music more conservative, rather
than more radical.
Mr. Cowell will describe the various
state institutions of music in Russia, such
as the Conservatory of Music, where all
music teaching in Russia must be done,
as private teaching, is abolished; the de
partment of publishing, where the gov
ernment prints the latest music of Rus
sia, having taken over all of the music
publishers; the strong department of the
Science of Music.
All of these institutions, according to
Mr. Cowell, are more or less unique. He
will speak about the scientific achieve
ments of Russia, as yet unknown in this
country. He will give a resume of the
composers of Russia and their style.
