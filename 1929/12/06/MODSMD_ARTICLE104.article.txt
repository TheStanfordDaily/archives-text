# Phi Kaps Beat Breakers In Mural Gridiron Final
## CHAMPIONS ANNEX TITLE WITH 19-13 VICTORY IN SENSATIONAL ENCOUNTER 
### BY BOB VAN ETTEN 
Defeating Breakers 19-13 in a hectic battle yesterday afternoon Phi Kappa
Sigma won the 1929 intramural football championship and the right to retain
the silver football trophy for one year. This award is semi-perpetual, perma
nent possession going to any group winning it three times.
Edmonds and his cohorts definitely held the upper hand throughout the
first half, smearing the Breakers offense, scoring once, and being stopped
on their rivals' five-yard line twice. Early in the game two passes, and three

pruns by Edmonds for a gain of forty
yards, placed the ball on the eight
yard line from where the Phi Kap
star scored on an end run.
Later the fraternity men brought
i the ball to the five-yard line but failed
to complete a pass over the goal line.
The end of the half stopped a third
drive in the shadow of the goalposts.
Trick Play Score
On the first play of the second half
the Phi Kap's successfully pulled the
worn-out "sleeper" play with West
smith receiving a pass on the side
i lines and running sixty yards to
| score. West smith was aided on the,
j run by two Breakers who obligingly
j clipped each other out of play. Just
| before the close of the third period
j the fraternity seven finished a long
: drive with a touchdown as Westsmith
picked a pass out of the hands of
two Breakers behind the goal line.
A belated comeback in the fourth
quarter netted the clubmen their two
touchdowns. Hables broke loose on an
end run to dash fifty yards to a score.
Some fancy officiating produced the
Breakers' second touchdown a few
seconds before the end of the game.
After gaining possession of the ball
!on an intercepted pass, Lambert
| passed to Stan Cook who ran thirty
j yards to a touchdown apparently with
! out being touched. The referee, how
j ever, ruled that he had been tagged
' on the twenty-yard line.
Final Score
On the next play Carlsmith received
a pass and ran around right end
where a Phi Kap not only tagged him
| with both hands but practically
' pushed him out of bounds. The re
feree, however, failed to blow his
whistle, and Carlsmith ran on to a
score which was allowed.
