# SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO REPRESENT WEST IN ROSE BOWL GAME
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 5 (/P).â€”The
University of Southern California will
represent the West in the annual New
Year's Day football classic in the Rose
Bowl, Pasadena.
Coming from the Trojan general ath
letic committee last night like a thunder
bolt, announcement of U.S.C.'s acceptance
dispersed half the heavy cloud of conjec
ture which hangs over the selection of
representatives of the West and East for
the blue ribbon contest each year.
Declining to talk to the last, the selec
tion committee of the Pasadena Rose
Tournament heaved a sigh of relief, and
promptly washed its hands of the whole
affair, when the following simple an
nouncement was made by the U.S.C.
committee:
"The University of Southern Califor
nia, with the approval of President R. B.
Von KleinSmid, accepts the invitation of
the Pasadena Tournament of Roses to be
the Western representative at the Janu
ary 1, 1930, game at the Pasadena Rose
Bowl."
Concerning selection of teams to par
ticipate, attention today was concentrated
in the East. Purdue, Big Ten champion
and undefeated, Pittsburgh, with an
equally remarkable record in the East,
Tulane, a Southern team with an un
spotted escutcheon, and Southern Metho
dist University of Texas were the focal
points.
