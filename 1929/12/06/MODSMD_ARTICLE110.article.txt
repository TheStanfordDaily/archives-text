# SOPHOMORES, JUNIORS BATTLE TO DEADLOCK IN FAST HOCKEY TILT
## 
### 
In a contest that prophesies a tie
for the championship title, the sopho
more women's hockey team tied with
the junior women's squad, 2-2, yester
day afternoon. The sophs and jun
iors are now on equal standing, hav
ing each won one game, from the sen
iors and freshmen respectively. There
is little doubt, considering the show
ing made yesterday, that the two
elevens will win their games next
week, freshmen vs. sophomores and
juniors vs. seniors.
"If the game had been an intercol
legiate battle, there could hardly have
been more enthusiasm in the bleach
ers," declared Helen M. Bunting,
coach, at the end of the competition.
The best fighting spirit and best team
work on the part of both squads was
in evidence.
Following the old soph tactics of
striking a surprise goal after the first
whistle, Betts Hawkins made a point
for the second-year women. Nourse
in the same half made the only other
soph goal. Badger of the junior squad
retaliated by successfully pulling the
same trick as Hawkins, in the begin
ning of the second half.
Mary Richmond, who was a substi
tute in the second half for Tompkins,
scored the tying point for the juniors.
Tompkins and Leib were injured in
a mix-up.
