# FRESHMAN HOOPSTERS FAVORED OVER SENIORS IN INTERCLASS FRAY
## 
### 
Planning to make a desperate attempt
to remain in the running of 1929 inter
j class basketball play, the seniors will take
on a strong freshman quintet at 7:30
Monday night in Encina gym. Following
this game the juniors and sophomores will
tangle at 8:30.
The frosh, who have been working out
J daily under the guidance of Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw, have a fast smooth-working
team, and are greatly favored to down the
upperclassmen who lost their first game
in a slow contest with the sophomores.
The juniors, boasting a team including
j Weaver, Loumis, Mears, Griffith, and
! Bailey, all varsity men but eligible as
they have never won letters, have already
taken a close contest from the first year
men and are expected to use the sopho
[ more team as just one more stepping
stone to the interclass championship. The
sophs, however, have a strong pair of
guards in Broderick and Brown, and may
offer stiff resistance.
