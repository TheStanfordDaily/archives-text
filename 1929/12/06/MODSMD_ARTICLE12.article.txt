# RADIO, ENGINEERING CLUBS HEAR FEDERAL TELEGRAPH EXPERT
## 
### 
Members of the Radio Club and the
Stanford branch of the American Insti
tute of Electrical Engineers heard the
early history of the Federal Telegraph
Company and details of some of tlie ex
periments which the company is now car
rying 011 when C. H. Suydam, planning
engineer for the company, spoke before
a joint meeting of the two organizations
in the Civil Engineering Building last
night.
In his talk, the purpose of which was
mainly to explain some of the things
which the clubs will see on a field trip
to the Palo Alto laboratory of the Fed
eral Telegraph Company to be taken to
morrow morning, Suydam told how the
company was originally started in Palo
Alto by Stanford men. Dr. Harris J.
Ryan, now head of the Ryan High Vol
tage Laboratory, worked out most of
the original patents, he said. The present
factory in Palo Alto is the first one ever
built by the company, but has been much
enlarged, Suydam declared.
How the talking part of a talking mov
ing picture is made was explained by the
speaker. He passed around some of the
neon tubes used in photographing sound
on the films. Some of the finished films
were also examined by the audience.
Suydam explained the working of the
radio compass which is now in general
use as a location tinder by ships and air
planes, also the idea of a radio beam now
being perfected by the Federal Company
which will enable an aviator to locate a
landing field in a fog. This device is di
rected by a parabolic reflector as accu
rately as a beam of light from a search
light, the speaker stated.
Douglas Ring, the president of the
A.1.E.E., presided at the meeting, which
was attended by about 40 members of the
two organizations.
