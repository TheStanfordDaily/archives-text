# Cagle, Army Star, Key Man of Powerful Eleven
## SOLDIERS BRINGING STRONG TEAM WEST TO MEET CARDINALS Murrell, O'Keefe, and Carver Round Out Backfield; Wingmen Good 
### Richard Friendlich 
With all the hubbub and the luHyhon
attendant on the person of (.."hristian Kee
ner Cagle, an All-American halfback il
there ever was one, most people have
overlooked the fact that Coach IHff Jomjs
of the West Point aggregation in also
bringing to the Pacific Coast this month
several other football players wlm couUI
grace any eleven in the country.
Cagle cannot be praised too highly. He
is a constant threat to the opposition, a
driving runner as well as an open-field
flash, a man who can split a dime with a
forward pass while on the dead run, and
one of those rare birds who can scoot to
his left equally as well as to his right.
Hut he is supplemented by a capable crew
of gridders, among whom are:
Hertz Murrell, a line-smashing full
back-, who handles the punting assign
ment as well, and makes the Cagle threat
double-edged. When the defense is spre;ui
to stop a wide sweep by the rarablhi' red
head, Murrell goes catapulting over the
ccnter of the line for substantial gains.
Dave O'Keefe, a heady quarterback
who is recognized as one of the East's
best defensive backs. He has been kept
out of the latter part of the season by
injuries, but should be in shape to face
the Cardinals on December 28.
Carl Carlmark, a rangy end, adept at
snaring forward passes, and a steady de
fensive cog in the forward wall that
stopped the best Notre Dame could offer.
Buster Perry, a rarin' tearin' tackle
with some seven years of college foot
ball to liis credit and the outstanding
lineman in the Cadet array, who also dis
tinguished himself in the Notre Dame
fray, blocking one of Carideo's punts to
put the J rish in a hole and messing up the
Rockne plays with regularity.
"Meat" Carver, a reserve back who
came with a rush late in the season when
O'Keefe was injured to earn himself a
regular place. An all-round ball-carrier
and a brainy field general.
Ed Messenger, running mate to Carl
mark at the other end position, and every
bit as good. Nothing flashy, but steady
and dependable.

one of those rare birds who can scoot to
his left equally as well as to his right.
Hut he is supplemented by a capable crew
of gridders, among whom are:
Hertz Murrell, a line-smashing full
back-, who handles the punting assign
ment as well, and makes the Cagle threat
double-edged. When the defense is spre;ui
to stop a wide sweep by the rarablhi' red
head, Murrell goes catapulting over the
ccnter of the line for substantial gains.
Dave O'Keefe, a heady quarterback
who is recognized as one of the East's
best defensive backs. He has been kept
out of the latter part of the season by
injuries, but should be in shape to face
the Cardinals on December 28.
Carl Carlmark, a rangy end, adept at
snaring forward passes, and a steady de
fensive cog in the forward wall that
stopped the best Notre Dame could offer.
Buster Perry, a rarin' tearin' tackle
with some seven years of college foot
ball to liis credit and the outstanding
lineman in the Cadet array, who also dis
tinguished himself in the Notre Dame
fray, blocking one of Carideo's punts to
put the J rish in a hole and messing up the
Rockne plays with regularity.
"Meat" Carver, a reserve back who
came with a rush late in the season when
O'Keefe was injured to earn himself a
regular place. An all-round ball-carrier
and a brainy field general.
Ed Messenger, running mate to Carl
mark at the other end position, and every
bit as good. Nothing flashy, but steady
and dependable.
With all the hubbub and the luHyhon
attendant on the person of (.."hristian Kee
ner Cagle, an All-American halfback il
there ever was one, most people have
overlooked the fact that Coach IHff Jomjs
of the West Point aggregation in also
bringing to the Pacific Coast this month
several other football players wlm couUI
grace any eleven in the country.
Cagle cannot be praised too highly. He
is a constant threat to the opposition, a
driving runner as well as an open-field
flash, a man who can split a dime with a
forward pass while on the dead run, and
one of those rare birds who can scoot to
his left equally as well as to his right.
