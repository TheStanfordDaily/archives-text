# CHRISTMAS SEALS TO BE SOLD ON CAMPUS UNTIL NEXT THURSDAY
## 
### 
The annual sale of Tuberculosis Asso
ciation Christinas seals started on the
campus yesterday and will continue until
the coining Thursday. Stamps have been
distributed to the halls and houses, and
an extensive campaign is being carried on
under Lillian Schuck and Stan Mullen,
co-chairineu.
The proceeds of the drive are to go to
the Stanford Rest Homes which were
created for students in need of special
rest and care. They are also used when
hospital care is unnecessary or when the
hospital is full.
"A fair contribution from every mem
ber of the campus will give this drive a
substantial return and at the same time
will not cause any hardship on any one
I person," believes Stan Mullen, men's
I chairman.
i The women's sale is being conducted by
a representative from each living group:
Gertrude Laidlaw, Ruth Lockett, Peggy
Ball, Margaret Ketnpenick, Aileen Aid
well, Ann Hightower, and Joan Nourse.
The men are being canvassed by Irving
Rosenblatt and Douglass Gregg, work
ing under Stan Mullen.
Among the first ten to respond to the
call sent to Palo Alto and Campus resi
dents were three Stanford professors, and
Mrs. R. R. Long, in charge of the drive
for this locality, believes that the students
will follow the professors' example and
turn in a large contribution.
The money is used for prevention
against tuberculosis, which according to
statistics vies with heart trouble as the
disease which causes most deaths. How
ever, the peak of tuberculosis comes be
tween 25 and 35, while that of heart dis
ease comes much later in life.
