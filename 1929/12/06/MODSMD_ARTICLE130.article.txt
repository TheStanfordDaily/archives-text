### 
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn., Dec. 5 (/P).
i lit' minor leagues of baseball met an
old friend today for a few hours in the
form of a draft resolution, but after half
a dozen speeches, an effort by William G.
Bramham, president of three leagues, to
amend the draft rules, failed for the want
of a three-fourths majority.
