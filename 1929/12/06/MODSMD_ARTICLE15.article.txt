WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. S (/P).—
American industry in all its immense ram
ifications took stock today of the pros
pects for business in 1930—and found
them encouraging.
Leaders of its scores of industrial as
sociations and corporations gathered to
hear President Hoover outline briefly the
reasons for their assembly, and to give
one by one the views they held as to the
outlook in their particular field.
The President told them that the recent
crash in the stock market had been fol
lowed first by a recovery of confidence in
money markets, and, second, by a move
ment of leading employers to maintain
wages and activity.
Expansion Planned
"The third line of action has been to
undertake through voluntary organization
of industry the continuity and expansion
of the construction and maintenance work
of the country," Hoover continued. "The
extension and organization of this work
are the purpose of this meeting."
He remarked that in preliminary meet
ings representatives of the country's lead
ing business enterprise had "sown a una
nimity 1 have seldom seen in our country"
in the endeavor "to assure employment
and to remove the fear of unemployment."
