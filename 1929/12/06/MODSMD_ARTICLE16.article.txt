# CALIFORNIA, ARIZONA WATER SETTLEMENT HOPED FOR SHORTLY
## 
### 
DENVER, Dec. 5. (/P) —A start made
on their own problem, the four states
in the upper basin of the Colorado
river tonight hoped to see a resump
tion of negotiations between Califor
nia and Arizona for settlement of the
water division question within the
next few weeks.
Francis Wilson, temporary chair
man of the upper basin conference,
called to discuss the division of 7,500,-
000 acre feet of water annually, said
the three-day meeting had "accom
plished all that it had set out to ac
complish."
Conference Sends Letters
The conference dispatched letters to
the Colorado River Commissions of
Arizona, California, and Nevada —the
three states comprising the lower
basin —suggesting that they try once
more to dissolve their differences.
These differences, which have existed
for a number of years, largely are be
tween California and Arizona.
At the same time the Upper Basin
Conference invited to a future meet
ing of the four states —Colorado, Utah,
Wyoming, and New Mexico —the Ari
zona River Commission because part
of the stream traversing Arizona lies
within the upper basin. The confer
ence is to reconvene at the call of
Chairman Wilson or of William J.
Donovan, former Assistant United
States Attorney General who is well
acquainted with the Colorado River
problem.
