# WHITE CAR WILL BE REQUIRED OF SPEED COPS-EVEN 'JOHNNIE'
## 
### 
If Officer John Olsen doesn't have
his official automobile painted white,
Stanford students speeding about
the campus can snap their fingers
when he waves them over to the side
of the road as a preliminary to
dealing out a ticket. Such is the
effect of a statement received yes
terday by Justice of the Peace E. E.
Hardy of Palo Alto from State At
torney General U. S. Webb.
According to Webb any arrests
made from a car not painted white
are in violation of the California
Motor Vehicle Act, if the arrests
are made in an incorporated section.
