# ALL MOTORISTS ARE NOT CAGLES
## 
### 
Stanford's traffic situation is approaching perfection.. Automotive
regulations are not being flagrantly violated; eight more arterial stops
have been installed recently ; accidents are few ; and the Big Game hodge
podge of motorists was handled with incredible ease and speed.
But now the campus awaits the installation of a stop-and-go signal
at the busy University Avenue-El Camino Real crossing. An automatic
regulator, giving both state highway and University autoists equal rights
of-way, bids to be a traffic panacea for our present troubles.
The University, the City of Palo Alto, and Santa Clara County are the
Big Three who will or will not install the desired traffic regulator. Be
cause of the three-sided situation involved, the University should take
immediate action in effecting the installation of a stop-and-go signal. Un
warranted and unnecessary delay will result if the campus must wait
until action is commenced by the municipality or the county.
Obsolete traffic methods endanger lives every hour of the day at this
crossing. Metropolitan cities like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Ather
ton employ such controllers effectively. Why shouldn't local traffic be
protected by adequate safety devices at this corner?
To negotiate the crossing 011 a busy day one needs an iron nerve, a get
out-of-the-way horn, and the broken-field running ability of a Cagle.
Immediate installation of a stop-and-go signal will result in immediate
safety and satisfaction.
