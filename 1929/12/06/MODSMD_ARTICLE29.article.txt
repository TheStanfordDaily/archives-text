# YOUNGEST FOURTH ESTATE CONVENES
## 
### 
One hundred and fifty high school journalists arrive at Stanford today
for the annual convention of the California Scholastic Press Association.
Theoretically they come to learn the best methods of newspaper pro
duction ; actually the thing about the trip which they will remember long
est is not journalism, but Stanford â€”its campus and its students.
Undergraduate members of the Fourth Estate will share with these
high school newspaper men and women what they know of journalism;
but from the Stanford Rough and from the Five Hundred they will learn
how life is really lived on the Farm.
The convention is held every year through the efforts of the journalism
division and Sigma Delta Chi. These two groups render a service to the
visitors, because such a gathering gives them an opportunity to learn some
thing of journalism and of college. The journalism division and Sigma
Delta Chi render a service to the University, also because the presence of
one hundred and fifty high school editors gives the University an oppor
tunity to make an impression on a group that is influential with the uni
versity students of years to come.
