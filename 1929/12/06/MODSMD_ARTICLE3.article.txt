CLEVELAND, 0., Dec. 5 (#>).â€”'The
mystery of the fate of Pilot Thomas P.
Nelson, who disappeared in the darkness
and snow storm of early Monday while
flying the air mail from Bellefonte, Pa.,
to Cleveland, was solved today when Nel
son's body and his badly wrecked plane
were found in a ravine near Chagrin
Falls, Ohio, 35 miles southeast of Cleve
land.
Nelson, a pilot of the National Air
Transport Company, apparently had real
ized death was close at hand for his para
chute was found partly opened, indicat
ing he had made a belated effort to jump
for his life. His body was found about
100 feet from the wreckage of the plane.
Death apparently had been instantaneous.
Finding of the body ended one of the
most intensive searches ever made for a
missing flier, a search made frantic by
the possibility that Nelson was still alive
and in need of assistance.
