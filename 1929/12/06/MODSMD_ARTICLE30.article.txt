# TRADITIONS AGAIN

Commenting editorially on"a deafening hue and cry about U.CX-.A.'s
lack of traditions," the Daily Bruin, student publication of California's
newest "great" institution, has this to say:
"U.C.L.A.'s traditions will grow like the trees of West wood. Even
now they arc displaying tender young shoots. Their progress will he slow,
but it will be marked by their firm rooting in the soil from which they take
their life. And they will endure like the everlasting oak on the hillside."
Aside from a tremendous amount of lovely bucolic rhetoric that sen
tence contains some sound sense. There is nothing more amusing and
more futile in a new university than the inevitable attempts of Frank
Merrivvells to grind out enough hoary traditions on the spot to last Oxford
and Cambridge for the next three centuries.
While traditions may not exactly "grow like the trees of .Westwood"
or develop "tender young shoots," they are certain of development. No
university need worry about having a paucity of them. They will grow
up on every cross road without nurture from someone's intellectual
sprinkling can. U.C.L.A. had best worry about quality of traditions;
quantity will take care of itself.
