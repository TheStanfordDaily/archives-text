# TWO NATIONS, TWO ATTITUDES

### 
When Secretary of State Stimson sent his "reminder" to the Soviet
Government, he was acting in the interest of peace. But it has resulted
in a virtual diplomatic war between the United States and Russia.
Although the entire incident will piddle away of its own accord, a
scrutiny of the background discloses an interesting commentary on the
Soviet regime.
Russia was one of the forty-five nations, including the United States,
that signed the Kellogg Pact to renounce war. When she appeared to be
on the brink of a struggle with China, Secretary Stimson sent a note
through French diplomatic channels to remind Russia of her agreement.
He implied that this was the time to prove the validity of the pact.
The catch in the matter, according to the Moscow government, was
that the United States had no right to suggest, remind, or imply anything
because it had not recognized Russia diplomatically. Russia is non-exis
tent as far as the United States is concerned.
On the grounds of purely technical and theoretical logic, Moscow "re
sented" the "intervention" of the United States and made public a note to
that effect.
The very act indicates the difference in outlook between the two na
tions: one practically far-seeing, the other theoretically visionary. And
therein may be a clew as to why this country has not recognized the Soviet
Government.
