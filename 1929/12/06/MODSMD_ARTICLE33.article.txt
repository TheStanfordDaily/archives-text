JOURNEY'S END—Geary Theatre
You've heard a lot about this new war
play, and most of what you've heard is
true. Written for the private hearing of
a group of British officers, "Journey's
End" is nevertheless tightly constructed,
and a stirring evening in the threatre as
well.
While owing a great debt, it seems to
me, to "What Price Glory?" R. C. Sher
iff's drama can stand alone, as high criti
cal praise and full houses in New York
can attest.
"Journey's End" lacks the boisterous
humor, the lustiness, and the theatrical
smash of the Stalling-Anderson success,
but is vastly effective in a quiet way.
It is true that the dugout in "Journey's
End" smells more of tea than of sweat,
and the conversation is quite polite
enough to please even a Stanford dra
matic patron; but once you get used to
the "cheeriws" you'll forget the incredulity
with which an American always hears
very English conversation. You'll remem
ber only that men are fighting a mighty
messy war, when they don't want to do
it at all.
Still these officers (there are no mere
privates in "Journey's End") know that
it's the little things that count. They de
mand pepper, for instance. "War is bad
enough with pepper," observes the fleshy
Tupper. "Without it, it's bloody awful!"
There's one right between the eyes for
the journals in the play. "The Germans
are really quite decent, aren't they ?" asks
Raleigh. "I mean—outside the newspa
pers."
It's no use saying anything about the
performance itself, for nothing but un
qualified praise will serve. The dugout
scene, which stands throughout, is excel
lent. The lights and effects are managed
well.
The acting is quite flawless. There are
only eleven characters, and there are no
women. Hugh Williams as Captain Stan
hope carries the play with an intensity
that at one stroke makes drama and char
acter complete.
One did not feel with Williams, nor
with any of the company, that they were
acting. They were too expert for that.
But they zvcre acting, and acting superbly.
Second Lieutenant Raleigh was an ap
pealing youngster as played by Wallace
Douglas, and Basil Gill's Lieutenant Os
born—"Uncle"—was too fine to die—ex
actly the effect that the author desired.
The cook, Mason (Edward Ellis), was
a favorite of ours; and Forrester Har
vey's Lieutenant Trotter was properly
comic and justly popular. Walter Hudd,
in the unsympathetic role of Second Lieu
tenant Hibbert —half-weakling, half-cad
—gave a good performance.

The cast, in short, was one of those
"superlative" ones —starless, but eminent
ly satis factory.
If you do not actually weep at "Jour
ney's End" at least I think you will be
profoundly impressed.

TWELVE AGAINST THE GODS,
The Story of Adventure. By Wil
liam Bolitho. New York: Simon
and Schuster. 1929. At the Alcove
Book Shop, Palo Alto.
Men have been grouped together be
cause they have been kings. They have
been grouped because they have been
generals, because they have been states
men. Men of like vocations of every
kind have been considered together in
single volumes. Though such a grouping
as that of Mr. Bolitho is not without
precedent to the extent that adventurers
have been written of before, it is unique
in this respect: in no other book do we
find treated Alexander the Great and Isa
dora Duncan on a basis of parity. Imag
ine Alexander and Isadora as equals. Or
if this does not seem sufficiently strange,
behold these two who were contempo
raries in some wise: Woodrow Wilson
and Isadora.
Not without cause, do you ask: What
can these two have in common, Wilson
and Isadora? The answer: they are both
adventurers, as are some ten others—
famed adventurers, great characters, ac
cording to Bolitho. When telling in vig
orous language the life of one of these
adventurers, Charles XII of Sweden, ad
venture is in some degree defined: ,
"The capture of the impregnable, the
ascent of the unscalable, the logic of the
illogical; wild-sounding phrases, exactly
—for that is just what adventure is. In
it arc mystery and absurdity . . ."
In the lives of these twelve adventurers
—styled so by Bolitho—there is not a
little mystery, nor is there less of ab
surdity than there is of mystery. Not only
are you given in this volume tales, mys
terious and absurd —tales of men who
"dared"; but you are given often a
glimpse of what Bolitho himself thinks
of life. And that is—well, something.
Says Bolitho of life, likening adventure
to it:
". . . .adventure as hopeless, splendidly
futile as life itself, which by whatever
road our appetites and vain plans push us
to take, converges inevitably to death."
True words, Bolitho, but . . . but, well,
read them yourself in the book, and other
words like them. Bolitho takes you into
iiis confidence, as't were. And you may
like to he taken into his confidence. Who
knows ?
