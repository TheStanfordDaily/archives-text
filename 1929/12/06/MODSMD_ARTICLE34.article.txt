## DEPLORES LACK OF CAMPUS COURTESY

The Editor, Sir:
In a previous issue of your paper I
noted a plea for better attendance at
the A.S.S.U. concerts. At the time I
wondered. Now I understand. When
Hertz and Friedman appear on the
same program and are permitted to
leave after "one" encore by Friedman,
something is certainly lacking.
This is Hertz's last season. We
probably will not hear Friedman

again for another five years. Yet the
audience started to go when the
orchestra stopped; and bolted for the
exits as Friedman hit the last few
notes of his "only" encore. Why do
people go? To be correct? Where is
the Stanford courtesy we take so
much pride in? If Stanford can't do
any better than last night's exhibi
tion, they "deserve" to lose the con
certs! —The Innocent Bystander.
