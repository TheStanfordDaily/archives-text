# STANFORD FOUGHT TO GET THE CONCERTS
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
If the enthusiasm shown at last
night's concert be a fit criterion, it is
not to be wondered at that we are
threatened with the loss of the
A.S.S.U. Concert Series. Alfred Hertz
and his Symphony should in them
selves pack the Pavilion. When we
are also privileged to hear Ignaz
Friedman, one of the greatest living
pianists, it is appalling that one-third
of the house should have remained
unfilled.
The enthusiasm shown was, for the

I most part, considerable. However at
j the end a most deplorable incident
! occured. Mr. Friedman honored us
j with an encore, a delicate piece, ex
i quisitely played. Were we eager for
I more? NO! At the conclusion of the
I encore those few still remaining in
I the Pavilion literally stampeded for
j the exits.
Does this show how much we ap
preciate and take advantage of the
almost unparalleled cultural entertain
ment afforded us here?
