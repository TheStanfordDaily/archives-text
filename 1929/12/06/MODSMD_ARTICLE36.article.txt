# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD....
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF DECEMBER 6, 1904 
### 
Twenty-two men turned out for the
varsity baseball team. Since no coach
had been secured by Athletic Man
ager Barrett, A. L. Trowbridge, cap
tain-elect for the 1905 season, directed
the practice. With only four lettermen
returning, the outlook for the coming
year was discouraging.
College Notes: Minnesota finished
the football season with twelve vic
tories and no defeats, scoring 725
points while her opponents scored 12.
A letter was received by Manager
Barrett from Waseda University of
Japan, asking for a baseball game to
be played between Waseda and Stan
ford at San Francisco. "If the match
is arranged, it will be one of the first
international baseball games ever
played in America," stated the article.
"Best Laid Plans," a farce by Paul
Ford, was presented at Mullen's Hall
in Palo Alto. The cast included Pro
fessors S. S. Seward and L. E. Bassett.
Satisfies at the Yale University
showed that the average college stu
dent matriculated at the age of eight
een years, nine months, and sixteen
days, and was four months older at
that time than forty years previously.
The increase in age was due to added
severity of entrance examinations and
increase of work in preparatory
schools.

Negotiations were under way be
tween California and the University
of Louisiana for a football game to
be played at El Paso, Texas, the half
way point between the two states.
