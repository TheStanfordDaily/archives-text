# ECONOMIC LOSSES OF LAST WAR MAY HELP PREVENT NEXT-BRYANT
## 
### 
"The greatest preventatives for future
wars are, first, the tremendous economic
losses of the last war, second, the new
balance of world power between the Uni
ted States, Great Britain, and Japan, and,
third, the universal social and economic
losses which would result from such a
conflict," said Lieutenant Commander
Stewart Frederick Bryant in discussing
"Limiting the Causes of War" at the
International Relations Club meeting last
night.
In his opinion the greatest question in
the coming Arms Conference in London
will be not solely that of armaments but
of the general value of conferences and
of arbitration as an aid to international
understanding.
The retarding factor in American par
ticipation in international affairs is the
lack of diplomatic background in the
State Department and the need for gov
ernmental machinery for relations of this
kind, according to Lt. Commander Bry
ant:'
The question of limiting air armament
will be a serious one, because it could not
be done without hindering the develop
ment of civil aircraft, he said. He also
stressed the importance of the battleship
in supporting air warfare. He thinks that
the question of economic pressure will be
of utmost importance in the limitation of
armament.
An open discussion followed the lec
ture. Maxine Cushing was elected chair
man and Virginia Voorhris secretary of
the club; Kazuo Kawai and William
Johnstone were appointed to the executive
committee.
