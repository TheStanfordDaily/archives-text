"Ye editor" has ruaely yanked us
out of a pleasant grassy grave to cook
up a few "Cabbages" in order to put
the campus in "good humor" during
convention time, when it is needed
most.
"'Good Humor!' that's a
laugh!'" say members of the Rally
and Executive committees, the
Election Board, the Administra
tion, certain departments, a lot
of fraternities, no sororites, of
course, a few halls, numerous
wounded individuals, members of
the Anti-Pun League, members of
the Grim Mug society, and as
sorted "fans."
"Just turn out a column, will ya?
The high-school delegates are going
to be on the campus, and—well, the
high-school delegates are going to be
on the campus ..."
Very well.
What is my message to the Youth
of America here represented in this
splendid group of "high school folks"?
Why, nothing much. Perhaps just
"Eat, Drink, and be Merry, for tomor
row you must go back home and listen
to the Faculty Adviser again."
We once spent quite a few
happy days on a high-school news
paper. In fact we edited the thing.
We never will forget the time the
principal had an entire edition
run through the press again to
black out a head which contained
the words "drinking bout." Of
course it showed through.
Well, maybe you'd better not pay
much attention to us, anyhow. We're
just a cheap college cynic, if you must
know. Everyone says so, and the ma
jority is always right, if not bright.
And by the way, in our day
this "happy group" was a Federa
tion, not a mere "Association."
"Association" —bah!
Well, young people, we want to wel
come you to the Stanford "Farm"
where life is better (advt.). Our motto
(translated from the German by an
obliging local delicatessen man) is:
"The Winds of Freedom are Blowing."
But don't bother to wear that heavy
overcoat you brought.
