### BY CADET P.H. LASH II Member West Point Pointer Staff 
(Jiditor's Note.—This is the concluding
article of a scries on the history and life
of the United States Military Academy
at IVcst Point, prepared by cadets on the
staff of the IVest Point Pointer.)
West Point, the locality, was well
known as a site of importance long before
West Point, the Military Academy, re
placed with its buildings of instruction
the forts and bastions of defense. The
name West Point came before the public
in 1776, when it was realized by both
Colonists and British that strategical con
trol of the Hudson was a necessity.
Famous names and events of West
Point history, baptized in the blood of
liberty, include: the famous General Put
nam, who built a set of bastions there in
1777; Molly Pitcher, who took a shot
with her husband's cannon at advancing
British regulars; Thaddeus Kosciusko,
who organized and perfected fortifica
tion in 1778; Mad Anthony Wayne, who
defended its position; Baron Steuben,
who drilled our troops; and Washington,
who lived there.
Arnold's Treachery
In 1780, General Arnold took command
of West Point at his own request. The
story of his treachery is too well known
to be repeated. An interesting sequel,
however, tells of confrere Andre's stor
age in a dungeon of the Fort there after
his capture.
The Military Academy first proved its
value in the War of 1812. At that time,
less than 100 cadets had graduated, 65 of
whom were still in active service. In 1817,
Major Sylvanus Trayer was appointed
superintendent of the Academy. For 16
years lie exerted the greatest influence on
cadet life.
In 1846, when the Mexican War broke
out, 1300 men had graduated from the
Academy, many of whom rendered con
spicuous services to their country. Lee,
Bragg, Sherman, Hooker, Grant, and
McClellan arc but a few of the West
Point names distinguished in the war.
Civil War Troubles
The Civil War caused an upheaval at
West Point. Divergent views and opin
ions from all parts of the country were
expressed and strongly supported by
members of the Corps. Intense feeling
aroused by John Brown's raid resulted
in a number of serious fights, and, al
though the authorities did not relax the
customary discipline, cadets agitated by
state feeling cared little for punishment
| or demerits received. Seceding Southern
| states took with them their sons who,
! once loyal Unionists, were soon to tear at
the throats of their Northern classmates.
The names of Grant, Jackson, Stuart, and
Lee will live long in the annals of war
and fame.
Then came the Spanish-American War.
Classes were graduated early. The war
was short hut vigorous, and the ultimate
results shed more glory on the name of
i West Point.
The World War disrupted the Military
| Academy more seriously than any previ

ous event in its history. The frenzied
preparations that followed our entry
swept away all precedetn. The class of
1917 graduated two months ahead of
time; 1918 graduated in August 1917, and
1919, 1920, and 1 ( J21 received their com
missions in 1918. An unparalleled crisis
in the history of West Point was experi
enced at this time, for the fourth class,
which had been at the Academy less than
five months, was all that remained of the
Corps.
Back to Normal Again
The Armistice ended the pressing need
for officers. West Point reverted to nor
malcy. About 3000 graduates served in
this war, demonstrating marked ability in
the performance of duty. General J. J.
Pershing was of the class of 1896.
West Point, then, and even now, is a
child, a child whose strength is built from
the youth of the country, a child whose
diet is milk—the milk of war. West
Point is, and always will be, the backbone
of the nation's defense. Strengthened by
past experiences, t he Academy continues
to fill its purpose, confident that when the
next great test comes, loyal sons will add
fresh laurels to West Point's glorious
past.
