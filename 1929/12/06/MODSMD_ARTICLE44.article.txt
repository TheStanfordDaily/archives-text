# FORMER CURATOR OF MUSEUM BRINGS FAME TO SACRAMENTO FORT
## 
### 
Nineteen years as curator of the
Stanford Museum apparently did not
dim the facile brain of Harry C. Peter
son. He is now curator of Sutter'A
Fort Museum at Sacramento. During:
the three years that he has been
there he conceived the idea of turning
the old fort into a treasure house of
'49 mementos.
Peterson's "Whiskerino" idea
brought fame to the museum. As a
result of the whiskerino celebration
held in Sacramento a few years ago,
interest in the pioneer period has
grown immensely and the attendance
at the museum has grown from 400
to 20,000 a month.
Peterson's father should win fame
as the man in charge of the Stanford
forge at which Herbert Hoover
worked while be was studying en
gineering. Peterson himself is said to
"know more about California history
than the people who made it."
