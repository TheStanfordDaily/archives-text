# LACK OF WATER NOT PROBABLE; WELLS ARE PUMPING NOWâ€”ROTH
## 
### 
Interest in the possible shortage of
water on the campus has been height
ened by the continued delay of the
usual fall rainy season and the dis
cussion of assurance of water for all
consumers on the peninsula through
the use of the Hetch Hetchy water
rights. Lake water, used as the basis
for the regular campus supply, can
be supplemented, in times of shortage,
by well water pumped from the vari
ous wells situated back of campus.
Comptroller Roth, when asked about
the possibility of a future dearth of
water at Stanford, said, "Although the
lake is dry, the regular supply has
been supplemented by water pumped
from the Stanford wells. Even if the
wells were to go dry, and there is no
probability of such a thing happen
ing," he continued, "there would be
no trouble, for there are reserve sup
plies in both Searsville and Felt
lakes."
Some 20,000,000 gallons of water
are kept in Searsville lake, and nearly
10,000,000 gallons in Felt lake for fire
protection. In cas< of any deficiency in
water supply, these reserves could be
used immediately.
