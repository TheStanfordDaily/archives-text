# GARDENER'S PORTRAIT BY M.C. RICHARDSON PAINTED FOR CHAPEL
## 
### 
Fullfilling the desires of his friends,
Dr. Charles Gardener, Chaplain of the
University, has had his portrait paint
ed by Mary Curtis Richardson, San
Francisco artist. The likeness is hung
in the vestry of the Chapel and shows
him in his gown.
Mr. and Mrs. Gardener are now in
Europe on the first sabbatical leave
ever taken by the chaplain since he
has been connected with the Univer
sity in 1902. They are expected back
in March, according to Rev. R. B.
Cherington, acting chaplain.
Mary Curtis Richardson has painted
several well-known campus figures,
among them one of David Starr Jor
dan, which is now hung in the Ad
ministration auditorium, and one of
Dr. Carl F. Branner, second president
of Stanford, now in Branner Hall. She
has won several medals from the Na
tional Academy in New York and from
the Panama Pacific Exposition.
