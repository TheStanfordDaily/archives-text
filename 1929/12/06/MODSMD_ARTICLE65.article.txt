# DAILY SELECTS 1929 MURAL TOUCH TACKLE GRID ALL-STAR SEVEN
## Three Phi Kaps, Two Toros, One Breaker, And One Beta Are Chosen 
### 
The All-University intramural touch
football seven, as selected by the Daily
sports staff, is as follows:
Backfield—Edmonds, Phi Kappa Sigma
Hubbard, El Toro
White, Beta Theta Pi
Evans, Phi Kappa Sigma
Line —Lyons, Phi Kappa Sigma
Lambert, Breakers
Krause, El Toro
Due to the inability of the staff to cover
all preliminary games thoroughly, this
team has been selected from only the
league leading groups. Men are desig
nated solely as backs or linesmen, since
the great variety of formations employed
in touch football makes it impossible to
designate a man as holding down any par
ticular position.
Edmonds, key man of the victorious
Phi Kappa Sigma seven, an accurate pass
er, and a fast and slippery runner, would
be an asset to any team.
Hubbard, El Toro's triple threat man,
is chosen for his all-round ability in pass
ing, running, and kicking. Even the I hi
Kap's failed to stop Hubbard, who broke
away for an eighty-yard run from scritn
mage.
White, mainstay of the Beta team, has
been outstanding on both offense and de
fense. an excellent passer, and sure
on defense, White also rates on all-round
ability.
Evans is probably the surest pass re
ceiver .on any mural team, and the Ed
monds to Evans combination has piled up
an immense yardage throughout the sea
son. Evans is fast, and a demon on de
fense.
Lyons is selected to fill the center po
sition on the basis of his blocking ability
and his knack of capturing short, fast
passes.
Lambert is a tough man to get around
when on offense, and is rarely stopped
from breaking through the line when 011
defense.
Krause has been the chief pass-snagger
of El Toro throughout the season, and
also has shown 011 defense.
