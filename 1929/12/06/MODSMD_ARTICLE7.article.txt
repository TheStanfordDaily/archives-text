Four women and eight men of the
sophomore class will make their formal
debut in campus dramatics when they
are seen in "Cock Robin," a mystery
comedy by Elmer Rice and Phillip Barry,
which is being given in the Assembly Hall
tonight at 8:15 o'clock, under Harold
Helvenston, acting director of dramatics.
The cast will include: Bromley K.
Smith, who appeared here this summer
in Elmer Rice's impressionistic play "The
Adding Machine," in the part of Julian
Cleveland, the member of the Cope Val
ley Community Players who completely
takes hold of the situation after the
murder; John Huneke, as Hancock Rob
inson, who is mysteriously killed in the
presence of ten people; Elizabeth Erlin,
in the part of Carlotta Maxwell, who in
tends to elope with Robinson on the night
of the murder; Ernest Mendenhall, in the
role of Dickie Lane, whose grudge against
Robinson casts suspicion on him; Harry
Lee Logan, as George McAuliffe, direc
tor of the Community Players; and Patty
Baker, in the part of Maria Scott, his
stage assistant.
Odell to Appear
Sandy Leib will play Alice Montgom
ery, a gushing promoter of the interests
of the Cope Valley Community Hospital.
The part of Helen Maxwell, Carlotta's
mother, will be played by Mina Hughes;
and that of her uncle, Dr. Edgar Grace,
by Edward Girzi. Cary Odell, who had a
pantomime role in the Football Gaieties,
will be seen as Henry Briggs, stage mana
ger of the Community Players; William
S. Richards will play John Jessup, and
George Quigley will do Clark Torrence.
Broadway Hit
"Cock Robin" is being presented tonight
for the first time on the Pacific Coast by
the sophomores, having enjoyed a long
run on Broadway. The authors, Elmer
Rice and Phillip Barry, are two of the
most popular young playwrights in New
York, having made their reputations
chiefly on"The Adding Machine" and
"Holiday," respectively. "Cock Robin" is
a clever mystery play without all the
stereotyped characteristics of the con
temporary "thriller."
Frederick Stover, acting technical di
rector, has constructed the set for "Cock-
Robin" and is directing the clever tise of
it, moreover reversing the effect given the
audience. The first act is seen as if from
the auditorium of the theater in which the
murder is committed, and the second and
third acts are seen as if from the back of
the stage.
