# VARIED N.S.F.A. ACTIVITIES INCLUDE CEMENTATION OF FOREIGN CONTACTS

### Art McGarr 
Conventions and student meetings
are not the only things that the Na
tional Students Federation carries on
in its work throughout the colleges
and universities of America. In fact
these two items are but a sma'l per
centage of the things accomplished.
An intricate system of research
into student body problems is main
tained at all times by the N.S.F.A.
Any university in the country may
send its problems to the New York
offices of the student federation and
any former information on the solu
tion of these problems will be avail
able. For instance:
At New York University the pecu
liar problem was faced of combining
three separate student repre
senting bodies of 1300, 5000, and 1300.
Each council handled local activities,
and centralization was needed for all
university functions. What can the
bureau recommend? This case is
merely an example of numerous prob
lems submitted every year to the re
search bureau.
Sponsor Debates
Each year under the sponsorship of
the N.S.F.A. debating teams from oth
er countries are brought to the United
States, for the purpose of meeting de
bating teams from colleges in this
country. Arrangements for meets,
transportation, entertainment, and all
the other fine points of a debate tour
are handled by the N.S.F.A.
This year the Oxford debate team
came to this country under the Fed

j eration's auspices and two years ago
j Cambridge sent a team over. Each of
these teams appeared at Stanford in
debates against Stanford representa
tives. Canadian universities, the Uni
versity of Sydney, Australia, and a
women's team from the British Isles
have all appeared in the United
States during the past year. Next year
an all-California debating team com
posed of representatives from Stan
ford, California, and U.S.C. are plan
ning a tour of England. Since August
of this year a team from the Univer
sity of Colorado has been making a
speaking tour of the world.
Foreign Contacts
Besides arranging for all these team
representations in this country and
abroad, the N.S.F.A. conducts student
tours all over the world with the pur
pose of dissipating misunderstanding
and prejudice through contacts with
people of other countries. Last sum
mer 100 American students visited
Europe and were conducted through
the British Isles, the Balkans, Central
Europe, Germany, and Austria by stu
dent unions of Europe. Last January,
37 South African students arrived in
the United States, their itinerary be
ing managed by the N.S.F.A.
Next year the student federation is
planning a nation-wide poll of Ameri
can universities on the question of
prohibition in general, and drinking in
particular. The N.S.F.A. is the only
means that student bodies have of
expressing any concerted opinion on
current affairs of today.

Any university in the country may
send its problems to the New York
offices of the student federation and
any former information on the solu
tion of these problems will be avail
able. For instance:
At New York University the pecu
liar problem was faced of combining
three separate student repre
senting bodies of 1300, 5000, and 1300.
Each council handled local activities,
and centralization was needed for all
university functions. What can the
bureau recommend? This case is
merely an example of numerous prob
lems submitted every year to the re
search bureau.
Sponsor Debates
Each year under the sponsorship of
the N.S.F.A. debating teams from oth
er countries are brought to the United
States, for the purpose of meeting de
bating teams from colleges in this
country. Arrangements for meets,
transportation, entertainment, and all
the other fine points of a debate tour
are handled by the N.S.F.A.
This year the Oxford debate team
came to this country under the Fed

j eration's auspices and two years ago
j Cambridge sent a team over. Each of
these teams appeared at Stanford in
debates against Stanford representa
tives. Canadian universities, the Uni
versity of Sydney, Australia, and a
women's team from the British Isles
have all appeared in the United
States during the past year. Next year
an all-California debating team com
posed of representatives from Stan
ford, California, and U.S.C. are plan
ning a tour of England. Since August
of this year a team from the Univer
sity of Colorado has been making a
speaking tour of the world.
Foreign Contacts
Besides arranging for all these team
representations in this country and
abroad, the N.S.F.A. conducts student
tours all over the world with the pur
pose of dissipating misunderstanding
and prejudice through contacts with
people of other countries. Last sum
mer 100 American students visited
Europe and were conducted through
the British Isles, the Balkans, Central
Europe, Germany, and Austria by stu
dent unions of Europe. Last January,
37 South African students arrived in
the United States, their itinerary be
ing managed by the N.S.F.A.
Next year the student federation is
planning a nation-wide poll of Ameri
can universities on the question of
prohibition in general, and drinking in
particular. The N.S.F.A. is the only
means that student bodies have of
expressing any concerted opinion on
current affairs of today.
Conventions and student meetings
are not the only things that the Na
tional Students Federation carries on
in its work throughout the colleges
and universities of America. In fact
these two items are but a sma'l per
centage of the things accomplished.
An intricate system of research
into student body problems is main
tained at all times by the N.S.F.A.
