Only a few freshmen have turned out I
for track this fall, and it is hoped that'
possible material for this year's frosh
squad may be unearthed in the intramural
meet. According to Ellington, no one
should hesitate to compete because of lack
of experience in track or field events, as
many "unknowns" have been developed
into stars.
Preliminary trial heats will be held on
Wednesday afternoon, December 11, and
finals on the afternoon of Friday the 13th.
Entries, either of teams or of unattached
individuals, must be posted in Encina
gym by December 10. The meet will be
handled by junior track managers.
