# PROGRESS IS RAPID IN LIGHTNING STUDY EXPLAINS F.W. PEEK
## Research Work Shows That Phenomena Expressed In Volts, Amperes 
### 
"The progress made in the knowledge
of lightning and die effects of lightning
on transmission lines and apparatus has
been so rapid that the subject may now
be said to be on an engineering basis,"
says Frank W. Peek, Stanford graduate,
'08, in a paper recently read before the
World Power Conference and the World
Engineering Congress held at Tokyo, Ja
pan.
Peek is now at the head of the General
Transformer Engineering Department of
the Pittsfield Works of the General Elec
tric Company, and is doing special re
search work in the field of lightning.
"A good indication of this progress is
that lightning phenomena are expressed
in volts, amperes, and time. These results
have been brought about largely as the
result of research," he declares.
The study at this time indicates the
following general characteristics of light
ning: voltage on the order of 100,000,000;
current, order of 100,000 amperes; en
ergy, order of four kilowatt hours; pow
er, order of a thousand billion horse
power; time, order of a few microsec
onds; gradient at breakdown, 100 kv. per
ft. The charge is formed by the action of
air cur rents on raindrops.
"The time for a large part of the cloud
to discharge may vary from one to ten
microseconds where appreciable induced
voltages occur on transmission lines.
When induced voltages on transmission
lines are low, the time may be much
longer.
"The total energy dissipated in the
world by lightning is probably on the
order of 1,200,000 kilowatts continuously.
High induced voltages on the transmission
lines cannot result if the cloud does not
discharge very rapidly."
In speaking of laboratory work, Peek
remarks that voltages higher than any
ever observed on lines have been obtained,
and designed tests have been made on
full-size apparatus. Although progress
has been rapid, there is still much to learn
and extensive laboratory and field work
is planned for the coming year.
The paper gives the characteristics of
lightning measured in engineering units,
the field of laboratory research, and dis
cusses lightning generators, wave shapes
and polarity, grading shields, poles, tow
ers and structures, transformers, and
transmission lines.
Peek has worked for many years, and
has built model sets showing the work of (
lightning on modern towns. He has il
lustrated the various kinds of lightning
rods and the result they have upon divert
ing the lightning ball.

been so rapid that the subject may now
be said to be on an engineering basis,"
says Frank W. Peek, Stanford graduate,
'08, in a paper recently read before the
World Power Conference and the World
Engineering Congress held at Tokyo, Ja
pan.
Peek is now at the head of the General
Transformer Engineering Department of
the Pittsfield Works of the General Elec
tric Company, and is doing special re
search work in the field of lightning.
"A good indication of this progress is
that lightning phenomena are expressed
in volts, amperes, and time. These results
have been brought about largely as the
result of research," he declares.
The study at this time indicates the
following general characteristics of light
ning: voltage on the order of 100,000,000;
current, order of 100,000 amperes; en
ergy, order of four kilowatt hours; pow
er, order of a thousand billion horse
power; time, order of a few microsec
onds; gradient at breakdown, 100 kv. per
ft. The charge is formed by the action of
air cur rents on raindrops.
"The time for a large part of the cloud
to discharge may vary from one to ten
microseconds where appreciable induced
voltages occur on transmission lines.
When induced voltages on transmission
lines are low, the time may be much
longer.
"The total energy dissipated in the
world by lightning is probably on the
order of 1,200,000 kilowatts continuously.
High induced voltages on the transmission
lines cannot result if the cloud does not
discharge very rapidly."
In speaking of laboratory work, Peek
remarks that voltages higher than any
ever observed on lines have been obtained,
and designed tests have been made on
full-size apparatus. Although progress
has been rapid, there is still much to learn
and extensive laboratory and field work
is planned for the coming year.
The paper gives the characteristics of
lightning measured in engineering units,
the field of laboratory research, and dis
cusses lightning generators, wave shapes
and polarity, grading shields, poles, tow
ers and structures, transformers, and
transmission lines.
Peek has worked for many years, and
has built model sets showing the work of (
lightning on modern towns. He has il
lustrated the various kinds of lightning
rods and the result they have upon divert
ing the lightning ball.

of lightning and die effects of lightning
