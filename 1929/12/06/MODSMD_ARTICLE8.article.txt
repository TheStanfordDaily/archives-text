# TELEPHONE ADDICT NOT PERTURBED BY OCEAN SEPARATION

SAN RAFAEL, Cal., Dec. 5 (/P).—A.
C. Blumenthal is a gentleman of fixed
habits—particularly when it comes to tele
phoning his mother once a week.
Blumenthal had been located in New
York for some time, and was one of the
transcontinental telephone line's regular
customers, but his weekly conversations
with Mrs. Barbara Blumenthal of San
Rafael were interrupted when he was
transferred to London.
Last night, however, Mrs. Blumenthal
received a cablegram saying the regular
conversations would be resumed, and to
day talked three minutes with her son, a
continent and an ocean away.
