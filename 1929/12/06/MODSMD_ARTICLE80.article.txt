# IOWA MAKES APPEAL FOR REINSTATEMENT IN WESTERN LEAGUE
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Dec. 5. (/P)—'The Univer
sity of lowa, banned effective Janu
ary 1, from engaging with Western
Conference teams in further athletic
competition, will make its plea for
reinstatement tomorrow.
The faculty committee of the Con
ference will decide whether the Hawk
eye, charged with proselyting and sub
sidizing athletes, have corrected these
alleged athletic abuses, and are now
fit to carry on athletic competition
with the other nine universities com
prising the Big Ten.
The University of lowa has thor
oughly and effectively "cleaned house,"
according to its 4500-word petition.
The report takes up each specific
charge lodged against the institution's
athletic policy, when it was suspended
last May.
Some of the charges are admitted —
others are denied, but all things con
trary to Big Ten practice have been
corrected, the petition states. The
four important questions lowa will be
required to answer are:
1. Can lowa guard effectively the
matter of scholastic eligibility?
2. Can she eliminate the subsidiz
ing of athletes by funds of various
kinds and by the use of student
notes?
3. Can she restrain alumni influ
ence and maintain full faculty con
trol?
4. Is the athletic department willing
to disqualify all present athletes who
have received improper financial aid?
