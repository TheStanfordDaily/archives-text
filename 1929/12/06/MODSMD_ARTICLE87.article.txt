OAKLAND, Dec. 5 (/P).â€”With the
University of Southern California select
ed to represent the West in the annual
Rose Bowl game at Pasadena and with
Pittsburgh declining the invitation to play
a post-season game at Kezar Stadium
here, the board of athletic control of
St. Mary's College today decided to call
the season ended and enter into no further
negotiations.
St. Mary's several days ago announced
that its undefeated team would accept an
invitation to play at Pasadena, if ten
dered, but the selection of U.S.C. ended
this possibility for a post-season contest.
