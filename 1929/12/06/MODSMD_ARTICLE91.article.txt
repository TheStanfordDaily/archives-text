STOP CAGLE
"Stop Cagle and you stop the
Army!"
This ancient and moth-eaten maxim
has boon the battle-cry of opposing
teams and the ballhoo of sports critics
for the past three years. And to back
up thoir startling statement, the multi
tude of blurb slingers point out that
whenever Cadet Chris Cagle has been
stoppod cold in liiß tracks, which has
been seldom enough to say the least,
Weat Point has failed to make much
of a showing.
When only a sophomore at the home
for military-minded, the elusive red
head began to attract attention by his
sensational runs and an almost un
canny ability to imprint his cleats on
the opposing team's goal line two or
three times per afternoon.
Last year Mr. Cagle was so good
that he was chosen on twenty
nineteenths of the all-American
selections throughout the coun
try. There was no mystery at all
as to his place on the mythical
eleven!
Then came the now famous Stan
ford-Army game at the Polo Grounds 112
on a certain bright and wintry day j
last fall. And for the first time in his
most brilliant, career, the West Point J
captain was really stopped. The West
ern Hicks, so styled before the rout
by the New York press, tackled him
in his tracks every time he laid his
hands on the ball, and not once dur
ing the sixty minutes of play did
Cadet Cagle break away for a goodly
gain.
Mr. Cagle was a marked man, just
as he will be on December 28. Can
the Cards bottle him up so effectively
once again? The Ramblers from |
Notre Dame got a healthy sweat up
trying to nail the shifty kid last week
ond, and only a frozen and slippery
field prevented him from scoring. On
the 28th, however, Mr. Cagle will not
have to bother about bringing his
ice skates!
But to really stop Cadet Cagle
does not mean that the opponents
have merely to wrap their arms
around his stocky legs on every
play. For besides this habit of
leaving the line of scrimmage in
a cloud of dust, the all-American
halfback is a vicious tackier on
defense and one of the best ball
tossers in the fall pastime today.
In fact, a large proportion of the
Army's scores have directly resulted
from lengthy passes by this same red
head. From time to time he literally
sprays passes about the stadium,
passes belonging to the bullet variety
which always hit their intended mark.
Even if Mr. Cagle couldn't shoot a
gun straight, he would graduate with
honors in sharpshooting! During the
past season, Cadets O'Keefe, Hutchin
son, Carver, Messenger, and Carl
mark, a quintet of the ablest pass
snaggers in the land, have alternated
in plucking the Cagle-tossed pigskins
out of the breezes and then jogging
the rest of the way down the turf
for touchdowns.
t To actually stop Cadet Cagle,
therefore, the opposing players
must shackle his hands as well
as his hoofs!
Yet, after watching Coach Biff
jones* men in action against the
champions from South Bend, Pop has
docidod that this business about stop
ping Cagle and you stop West Point
Is a bunch of hooey, and he is return
ing to the quiet sanetitudes of the
Farm not a little worried over Stan
ford's chances. For last Saturday's
meeting with Rockne's Fighting Irish
showed that, besides the flashy speed
demon. Captain Cagle, West Point
possesses a fast, hard-charging line
and a great all-around player in
Johnny Murrel.
Although not receiving much
publicity, this Mr. Murrel is a
regular work-horse. He is to the
Army what Chuck Smalling is to
the Cardinals. The rugged full
back does all of the Army's punt
ing, and he does it well. His kicks
are high spirals that soar down |
the field for around fifty yards or
more.
Thus, if Pop has anything to say ■
about it, which he emphatically will,
the white-jerseyed Redshirts are not
simply going to try and stop Cadet
Cagle. They are going to concentrate
as well on bringing this Murrel per- i
son down to earth. Long John Murrel '
is too good a punter, line-smasher,
and hard-hitting tackier to be left j
strolling around the greensward un
niolosted!
At any rate, when the opening
kickoff loops off some player's toe
on the afternoon of the 28th, the
eleven Farm stalwarts decked out
in white uppers and red trousers
will not be sprinting down the
field with the sole idea of stop
ping Cagle. They will be out to
stop the entire Army!

must shackle his hands as well
as his hoofs!
Yet, after watching Coach Biff
jones* men in action against the
champions from South Bend, Pop has
docidod that this business about stop
ping Cagle and you stop West Point
Is a bunch of hooey, and he is return
ing to the quiet sanetitudes of the
Farm not a little worried over Stan
ford's chances. For last Saturday's
meeting with Rockne's Fighting Irish
showed that, besides the flashy speed
demon. Captain Cagle, West Point
possesses a fast, hard-charging line
and a great all-around player in
Johnny Murrel.
Although not receiving much
publicity, this Mr. Murrel is a
regular work-horse. He is to the
Army what Chuck Smalling is to
the Cardinals. The rugged full
back does all of the Army's punt
ing, and he does it well. His kicks
are high spirals that soar down |
the field for around fifty yards or
more.
Thus, if Pop has anything to say ■
about it, which he emphatically will,
the white-jerseyed Redshirts are not
simply going to try and stop Cadet
Cagle. They are going to concentrate
as well on bringing this Murrel per- i
son down to earth. Long John Murrel '
is too good a punter, line-smasher,
and hard-hitting tackier to be left j
strolling around the greensward un
niolosted!
At any rate, when the opening
kickoff loops off some player's toe
on the afternoon of the 28th, the
eleven Farm stalwarts decked out
in white uppers and red trousers
will not be sprinting down the
field with the sole idea of stop
ping Cagle. They will be out to
stop the entire Army!

STOP CAGLE
"Stop Cagle and you stop the
Army!"
This ancient and moth-eaten maxim
has boon the battle-cry of opposing
teams and the ballhoo of sports critics
for the past three years. And to back
up thoir startling statement, the multi
tude of blurb slingers point out that
whenever Cadet Chris Cagle has been
stoppod cold in liiß tracks, which has
been seldom enough to say the least,
Weat Point has failed to make much
of a showing.
When only a sophomore at the home
for military-minded, the elusive red
head began to attract attention by his
sensational runs and an almost un
canny ability to imprint his cleats on
the opposing team's goal line two or
three times per afternoon.
Last year Mr. Cagle was so good
that he was chosen on twenty
nineteenths of the all-American
selections throughout the coun
try. There was no mystery at all
as to his place on the mythical
eleven!
Then came the now famous Stan
ford-Army game at the Polo Grounds 112
on a certain bright and wintry day j
last fall. And for the first time in his
most brilliant, career, the West Point J
captain was really stopped. The West
ern Hicks, so styled before the rout
by the New York press, tackled him
in his tracks every time he laid his
hands on the ball, and not once dur
ing the sixty minutes of play did
Cadet Cagle break away for a goodly
gain.
Mr. Cagle was a marked man, just
as he will be on December 28. Can
the Cards bottle him up so effectively
once again? The Ramblers from |
Notre Dame got a healthy sweat up
trying to nail the shifty kid last week
ond, and only a frozen and slippery
field prevented him from scoring. On
the 28th, however, Mr. Cagle will not
have to bother about bringing his
ice skates!
But to really stop Cadet Cagle
does not mean that the opponents
have merely to wrap their arms
around his stocky legs on every
play. For besides this habit of
leaving the line of scrimmage in
a cloud of dust, the all-American
halfback is a vicious tackier on
defense and one of the best ball
tossers in the fall pastime today.
In fact, a large proportion of the
Army's scores have directly resulted
from lengthy passes by this same red
head. From time to time he literally
sprays passes about the stadium,
passes belonging to the bullet variety
which always hit their intended mark.
Even if Mr. Cagle couldn't shoot a
gun straight, he would graduate with
honors in sharpshooting! During the
past season, Cadets O'Keefe, Hutchin
son, Carver, Messenger, and Carl
mark, a quintet of the ablest pass
snaggers in the land, have alternated
in plucking the Cagle-tossed pigskins
out of the breezes and then jogging
the rest of the way down the turf
for touchdowns.

ern Hicks, so styled before the rout
by the New York press, tackled him
in his tracks every time he laid his
hands on the ball, and not once dur
ing the sixty minutes of play did
Cadet Cagle break away for a goodly
gain.
Mr. Cagle was a marked man, just
as he will be on December 28. Can
the Cards bottle him up so effectively
once again? The Ramblers from |
Notre Dame got a healthy sweat up
trying to nail the shifty kid last week
ond, and only a frozen and slippery
field prevented him from scoring. On
the 28th, however, Mr. Cagle will not
have to bother about bringing his
ice skates!
But to really stop Cadet Cagle
does not mean that the opponents
have merely to wrap their arms
around his stocky legs on every
play. For besides this habit of
leaving the line of scrimmage in
a cloud of dust, the all-American
halfback is a vicious tackier on
defense and one of the best ball
tossers in the fall pastime today.
In fact, a large proportion of the
Army's scores have directly resulted
from lengthy passes by this same red
head. From time to time he literally
sprays passes about the stadium,
passes belonging to the bullet variety
which always hit their intended mark.
Even if Mr. Cagle couldn't shoot a
gun straight, he would graduate with
honors in sharpshooting! During the
past season, Cadets O'Keefe, Hutchin
son, Carver, Messenger, and Carl
mark, a quintet of the ablest pass
snaggers in the land, have alternated
in plucking the Cagle-tossed pigskins
out of the breezes and then jogging
the rest of the way down the turf
for touchdowns.
t To actually stop Cadet Cagle,
therefore, the opposing players
must shackle his hands as well
as his hoofs!
Yet, after watching Coach Biff
jones* men in action against the
champions from South Bend, Pop has
docidod that this business about stop
ping Cagle and you stop West Point
Is a bunch of hooey, and he is return
ing to the quiet sanetitudes of the
Farm not a little worried over Stan
ford's chances. For last Saturday's
meeting with Rockne's Fighting Irish
showed that, besides the flashy speed
demon. Captain Cagle, West Point
possesses a fast, hard-charging line
and a great all-around player in
Johnny Murrel.
Although not receiving much
publicity, this Mr. Murrel is a
regular work-horse. He is to the
Army what Chuck Smalling is to
the Cardinals. The rugged full
back does all of the Army's punt
ing, and he does it well. His kicks
are high spirals that soar down |
the field for around fifty yards or
more.
Thus, if Pop has anything to say ■
about it, which he emphatically will,
the white-jerseyed Redshirts are not
simply going to try and stop Cadet
Cagle. They are going to concentrate
as well on bringing this Murrel per- i
son down to earth. Long John Murrel '
is too good a punter, line-smasher,
and hard-hitting tackier to be left j
strolling around the greensward un
niolosted!
At any rate, when the opening
kickoff loops off some player's toe
on the afternoon of the 28th, the
eleven Farm stalwarts decked out
in white uppers and red trousers
will not be sprinting down the
field with the sole idea of stop
ping Cagle. They will be out to
stop the entire Army!

STOP CAGLE
"Stop Cagle and you stop the
Army!"
This ancient and moth-eaten maxim
has boon the battle-cry of opposing
teams and the ballhoo of sports critics
for the past three years. And to back
up thoir startling statement, the multi
tude of blurb slingers point out that
whenever Cadet Chris Cagle has been
stoppod cold in liiß tracks, which has
been seldom enough to say the least,
Weat Point has failed to make much
of a showing.
When only a sophomore at the home
for military-minded, the elusive red
head began to attract attention by his
sensational runs and an almost un
canny ability to imprint his cleats on
the opposing team's goal line two or
three times per afternoon.
Last year Mr. Cagle was so good
that he was chosen on twenty
nineteenths of the all-American
selections throughout the coun
try. There was no mystery at all
as to his place on the mythical
eleven!
Then came the now famous Stan
ford-Army game at the Polo Grounds 112
on a certain bright and wintry day j
last fall. And for the first time in his
most brilliant, career, the West Point J
captain was really stopped. The West
ern Hicks, so styled before the rout
by the New York press, tackled him
in his tracks every time he laid his
