# CADETS DRILL HARD TO MOULD DEFENSE FOR WARNER PLAYS
## Stanford Well Scouted By Pointers; Cagle Army Offensive Threat 
### Stephen Dietrich 
While the Cardinal football varsity
has been taking things easy for the
past couple of weeks, to rest up after
their stiff conference schedule and
to await the return of Coach Pop
Warner from the East, reports com
ing from West Point indicate that the
Cadets have been working hard in
preparation for their invasion of the
Farm.
West Point is not coming out t.o the
Coast to be befuddled by Stanford's
tricky offense, as it was in New York
last December. Last fall the honest
metropolitan gentry were astounded
to see Pop's charges march up and
down the field at will, and to shove
over four touchdowns to Army's none.
The West Point players were too
mixed up by the Cards' intricate as
sortment of reverses, spins, and more
reverses to do much effective defense
work that day.
Army Scouts
As a consequence, Coach Biff Jones
decided that he would not be fooled
by the Old Fox again on the 28th.
So on four different occasions during
the current season he sent a brother
officer out West by plane to scout
the Cards in action. If Jones' scout
was as effective as were the Army
aviators during the War, the West
Point players will have a lot of ma
terial to work on. At all events, the
Cadets have been scrimmaging for the
past few days against a miniature
Redshirt varsity.
At the same time, Jones has been
polishing up the Army running and
passing offense. Although his team
failed to score against Notre Dame
last Saturday, he is banking on his
hard clipping interference to get Cap
tain Cagle out in the open in the
Stanford game. Once in the clear,
Cagle, who is one of the toughest
men to bring down on any gridiron,
would be almost a cinch to cross the
Cardinal goal line. Besides Cagle, the
Army backfield quartet is made up of
Johnny Murrel, potent line smasher,
"Meat" Carver, heady signal barker,
and Hutch Hutchinson, the team's
best interferer.
Although tied once and defeated on
three occasions, the Army record
shows that Stanford will be hard
pressed to put over a win on the 28th.
It must be remembered that West
Point scheduled seven hard games
this year, and that all of the upsets
were due to unlucky breaks. Following
are the Army scores to date:
West Point 2G, Boston University 0
„ „ 33, Gettysburg 7
„ „ 23, Davidson 7
„ „ 20, Harvard 20
„ 13, Yale 21
„ „ 33, South Dakota 6
7, Illinois 17

Stanford game. Once in the clear,
Cagle, who is one of the toughest
men to bring down on any gridiron,
would be almost a cinch to cross the
Cardinal goal line. Besides Cagle, the
Army backfield quartet is made up of
Johnny Murrel, potent line smasher,
"Meat" Carver, heady signal barker,
and Hutch Hutchinson, the team's
best interferer.
Although tied once and defeated on
three occasions, the Army record
shows that Stanford will be hard
pressed to put over a win on the 28th.
It must be remembered that West
Point scheduled seven hard games
this year, and that all of the upsets
were due to unlucky breaks. Following
are the Army scores to date:
West Point 2G, Boston University 0
„ „ 33, Gettysburg 7
„ „ 23, Davidson 7
„ „ 20, Harvard 20
„ 13, Yale 21
„ „ 33, South Dakota 6
7, Illinois 17
„ „ 89, Dickenson 7

While the Cardinal football varsity
has been taking things easy for the
past couple of weeks, to rest up after
their stiff conference schedule and
to await the return of Coach Pop
Warner from the East, reports com
ing from West Point indicate that the
Cadets have been working hard in
preparation for their invasion of the
Farm.
West Point is not coming out t.o the
Coast to be befuddled by Stanford's
tricky offense, as it was in New York
last December. Last fall the honest
metropolitan gentry were astounded
to see Pop's charges march up and
down the field at will, and to shove
over four touchdowns to Army's none.
The West Point players were too
mixed up by the Cards' intricate as
sortment of reverses, spins, and more
reverses to do much effective defense
work that day.
Army Scouts
As a consequence, Coach Biff Jones
decided that he would not be fooled
by the Old Fox again on the 28th.
So on four different occasions during
the current season he sent a brother
officer out West by plane to scout
the Cards in action. If Jones' scout
was as effective as were the Army
aviators during the War, the West
Point players will have a lot of ma
terial to work on. At all events, the
Cadets have been scrimmaging for the
past few days against a miniature
Redshirt varsity.
At the same time, Jones has been
polishing up the Army running and
passing offense. Although his team
failed to score against Notre Dame
last Saturday, he is banking on his
hard clipping interference to get Cap
tain Cagle out in the open in the
Stanford game. Once in the clear,
Cagle, who is one of the toughest
men to bring down on any gridiron,
would be almost a cinch to cross the
Cardinal goal line. Besides Cagle, the
Army backfield quartet is made up of
Johnny Murrel, potent line smasher,
"Meat" Carver, heady signal barker,
