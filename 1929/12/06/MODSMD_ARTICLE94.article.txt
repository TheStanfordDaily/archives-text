# "GIL" DOBIE SURE OF COACHING POSITION AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 5. (TP) â€”Gilmour
Dobie stands secure in his job as foot
ball coach at Cornell, where he is
under contract until after the season
of 1933. An alumni committee which
criticized him last year is milder in
its criticism this year.
Although Cornell got only an even
break in its four major games, win
ning from Princeton and Columbia
and losing to Dartmouth and Pennsyl
vania, this represented a distinct ad
vance over recent seasons. Cornell
just saved itself in the Columbia
game, but held a lead over Dartmouth
to the very last minute and set the
pace against Penn until Dick Gentle
ripped off his 102-yard run for a touch
down.
The committee pointed out that
Cornell was a university which did
not attract school athletes in great
i numbers because of a lack of "foot
ball atmosphere," but asserted its dis
| approval of proselyting as a means to
! make up this difference. The commit
tee did recommend, however, that a
I wholesome interest in Cornell be stim
ulated in feeder preparatory schools.
Cornell is one of the few institutions
which received a clean bill of health
in the recent Carnegie Foundation re
port.
