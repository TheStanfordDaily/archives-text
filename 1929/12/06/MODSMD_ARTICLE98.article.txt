# PROSPECTS BRIGHT FOR BASKETBALL SEASON; WOULD-BE MEMBERS FIGHT OVER POSITIONS
## 
### 
With seven prospective forwards,
three centers, and seven guards put
ting on a terrific scrap to gain posi
tions on his 1930 quintet, Coach
"Husky" Hunt, varsity basketball
mentor, may be seen wearing a beati
fic smile whihc augurs well for Stan
ford's prospects during the coming
season.
The problem of selecting a first
team will be a tough one for Hunt,
and it is probable that several com
binations will see action in prelimin
ary games scheduled with the Y.M.1.,
on December 21, Nevada, on December
23 and 24, and Oregon State, on De
cember 26.
Veteran Forwards
Fighting for forward positions are
three returning lettermen, Fawcett,
Tyler, and Berg, two members of last
year's freshman squad, Ray and
Clough, and Weaver, a junior playing
his first year of varsity basketball.
Weaver, the coming player of the
squad, has shown a wealth of spe(:d
and ability and may shove one of the
veterans off the team.
A three-man struggle for center po
sition is going on among McCandless

and Hawkins of last year's varsity,
and Doub of the 1932 freshman quin
tet. McCandless looks better than he
has since his freshman year, but will
have to step to get the choice over
his two competitors.
Reynolds Stars
At present, Reynolds, a regular
guard last season, appears the only
man with an edge on his running
mates. Rowley, a transfer from Ohio
State, has looked good in practice,
but so have Mears, a center last year,
Butts, a newcomer, Bailey and Griffin,
transfers, and Baker, captain of last
year's frosh quintet.
In addition to all these men are
four others, playing football until af
ter the Army game, who are expected
to make a strong bid for positions.
These are Captain Rotliert, Thompson,
and Rintala, guards, and Phil Moffatt,
substitute forward last year.
