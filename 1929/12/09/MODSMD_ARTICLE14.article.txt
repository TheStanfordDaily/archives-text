# FEEBLE MYSTERY PLAY INTRODUCES SOPHOMORES IN NOVICE PRODUCTION
## 
### Staff Reviewer 
In a rather feeble mystery play,
"Cock Robin," by Elmer Rice and
Phillip Barry, a dozen sophomores
made their first appearance in cam
pus dramatics last Friday night after
about twelve days of rehearsal. Had
they had longer to work on "Cock
Robin," there would have been less
excuse for the frequent hitches in the
production. As it was, there was some
excuse for it, but the performance was
none the less amateurish.
The play was not written by men
experienced along the mystery line.
It is slow-moving; of itself, and was
not enhanced by numerous pauses and
gropings for lines. It took from eight
thirty until nine-thirty to kill Hancock
Robinson, and at eight-forty, one knew
he was doomed. Mystery play tech
nique requires faster action than an
act and a half to do the murder. Ant
at least twenty minutes before the
end of "Cock Robin" a dozen nearby
people had solved the mystery cor
rectly. "The glove," they whispered
"It's the director!"
However feeble the play, and how
ever little rehearsed, there were sev

ral among the cast whose acting prom
ises future appearances on the cam
pus. Sandy Leib's curtain speech made
her Mrs. Montgomery one of the most
comic and convincing characters in
the play. Harry Lee Logan, as Mc-
Auliffe, was an excellent showman
sort of person. Cary Odell, in the part
of Stage Manager Briggs, and Patty
Baker, as Maria Scott of the camera
eye, stayed in character from start to
finish. Other parts were taken by
Elizabeth Erlin, Bromley Smith, Mina
Hughes, Ernest Mendenhall, John
Huneke, William Richards, Richard
Quigley, and Edward Girzi.
Inadequate as "Cock Robin" was, its
direction must have been very diffi
cult. Harold Helvenston, acting direc
tor of dramatics, did well with all the
complicated action and business re
quired by the lines in the rehearsal,
and then the performance, of the Cope
Valley Community Players.
The single grog shop set, construct
ed by Frederick Stover and his thea
trical workshop class, was very at
tractive; and the clever reversal of
perspective in the second act was well
handled.
