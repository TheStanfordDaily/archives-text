# FRIDAY MEET MAY CURTAIL TICKET RIGHT
## Student Scalping May Cause B.A.C. To Stop Extra Ticket Privilege 
### 
A bitter fight looms when the Board
of Athletic Control special ticket com
mittee meets Friday night at the
home of W. P. Fuller, chairman, in
Hillsborough to discuss the ticket
scalping problem.
A majority of alumni and faculty
members of the Board are convinced
that the scalping situation is a seri
ous one and the students are the lead
ing offenders. Stanford Steinbeck,
student representative on the commit
tee, will go prepared with a lengthy
list of student opinions and other ma
terial destined to disprove the theo
ries of his elders.
Suggest Remedy
Many remedies have been suggested
to eliminate scalping of tickets and
prominent among these is the pro
posal to deprive students of their priv
ilege to buy two extra Big Game
tickets.
The special ticket group was ap
pointed by the B.A.C. following
charges that scalping was prevalent
on the campus just prior to the Big
Game. It is composed of W.P. Fuller,
alumni member and chairman, W. B.
Owens, faculty member, and Stan
ford Steinbeck, student member.
