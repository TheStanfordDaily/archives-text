# Forty-Two Positions Left For Senior Quad Pictures
## 
### 
Only forty-two positions are left for
senior photographs in the 1930 Quad,
while 250 seniors have not yet had
their photographs taken, according to
Stanley Milne, editor of the yearbook.
"As it is impossible to provide more
space for the pictures, the forty-two
positions still open will be filled on a
first come, first served basis," said
Milne.
At the same time, it was urged that
members of sororities, fraternities, and
clubs have their photographs taken
as soon as possible. Appointment may
be made by phoning 6161, the Quad
editorial office.
