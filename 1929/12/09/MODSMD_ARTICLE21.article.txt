## 
### 
That the present system of splitting
up women's teams at Triangle Sports
Days is unsatisfactory was the one
point upon which agreement was
reached at a conference of Stanford,
California, and Mills representatives
Saturday.
The U.C. delegation expressed defi
nite disapproval of the re-establish
ment of the former intercollegiate in
terclass system and was confident
that the Women's Athletic Associa
tion of that university would withdraw
from the triangle if it were adopted.
The representatives from Mills Col
lege reported that participants in the
recent sports day showed considerable
dissatisfaction with the arrangement
and that a change would be welcomed.
With one or two exceptions, repre
sentatives at the meeting agreed that
a system whereby, for example, U.C.
freshmen would play Mills sopho
mores, on a class basis would be a
decided improvement.
No Concerted Action
The question of the A.C.A.C.W. na
tional ruling against intercollegiate
competition was brought up, but no
conclusion was reached as to con
certed action to remove the prohibi
tion at the next national convention.
Representatives of each of the three
universities will communicate the re
sults of the conference to their re
spective organization and report the
reaction to the other two.
