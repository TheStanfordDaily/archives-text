# GRIDMEN START FINAL POLISHING FOR ARMY GAME
## "Pop" Orders Stiff Practice Sessions To Be Held Daily Until Date of Encounter Declares West Point Team Much Better Than It Was Last Fall; Admits Worry 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Coach Pop Warner requests
that all varsity players report in
suits to the practice field at 4
o'clock this afternoon. According
to Warner, stiff practice sessions
will be held every day from now
on.
Starting their last drive of the 1929
grid season in preparation for the in
tersectional engagement with West
Point on December 28th, the Cardinals
will bear down this afternoon in their
first real workout since the Big Game.
For the past week the players have
been holding hectic touch tackle
games and running a few signals
under the guiding hands of Tiny
Thornhill and Chuck Winterburn.
Begin Polishing
With the return of Pop to the Farm,
however, the big white-jerseyed team
will begin polishing up its offense and
defense in earnest. Following the long
let-down after the upset of the Golden
Bear, the Old Fox is not a little wor
ried over the ability of the Cards to
get back in the peak of form for the
Army game.
Card Attitude Poor
Besides fearing the strength of the
Cadets, whom he scouted while in the
East, Pop is far from satisfied with
the attitude of his charges. When he
hopped off the Limited to resume his
coaching duties, he was greeted with
a turnout of only twenty-five players
at Friday's practice. Unless the entire
squad of forty-nine shows a little
more interest in the coming battle,
Stanford is likely to be neatly trimmed
by the invaders from West Point.
Furthermore, the Cards will be han
dicapped with finals during the next
two weeks. With their minds on books
and grade points, the players will not
be able to digest as much football as
they normally could.
Pop Dubious
As for the Army team, Pop let it be
known the other day that Stanford
will have to play as good or better
than it did against the Bears to come
out on the long end of the score. On
that occasion, the Cardinals were at
top form and could have downed any
squad in the country. But the 28th, it
must be remembered, will be an en
tirely different situation.
Army Better Than Last Year
Pop further added, in emphatic
manner, that West Point is a much
better team than it was last fall. He
does not think that the Cadets will be
easy to befuddle with reverses, spins,
and tricks, as they were at the Polo
Grounds a year ago. The Army is a
smart team this season, as well as one
composed of brawny, smashing, fight
ing men. Besides giving a lot of credit
to the Cadet line, Coach Warner was
especially impressed with the all
around playing of Captain Cagle and
Johnny Murrel, backfield aces.
Added to this, West Point will have
a psychological advantage over Stan
ford, when the two teams tangle three
weeks from now. The Army will prob
ably be established as a slight under
dog by a majority of the sports critics
before the game, and the Cadets will
be invading the West with but one
thought in mind â€”to avenge last year's
stinging upset at the hands of "Si
Stanford."
