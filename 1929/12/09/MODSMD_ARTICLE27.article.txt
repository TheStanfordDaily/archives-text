# ANOTHER CLEAR-CUT STATEMENT NEEDED
## 
### 
The traditional opinion of Stanford fraternity men that the Adminis
tration is decidedly prejudiced against organized living groups was dealt
a harsh blow last week at the National Interfraternity Conference
meeting.
Speaking before representatives of sixty-six national fraternities
from eighty-five universities, Dr. Wilbur went on record as approving
cf fraternities—"good fraternities." Stanford's energetic president has
uttered few truer words than his statement that to abolish fraternities
"would bring about something almost approaching a revolution in Ameri
can colleges." But he did not say whether fraternities would continue to
live and prosper or die a natural death. He infers that their future will
be based entirely on their determined course of action..
IF fraternities would abolish "slapstick methods" of initiation and
thereby attract the increasing number of more mature men coming to
universities from junior colleges. IF the individual groups will make
honest efforts to raise the general plane of their scholarship. IF fra
ternities make their organizations less amateurish—then fraternities will
continue to grow into wholesome organizations that will be assets to
American colleges. But IF fraternities choose the opposite course of
action, they will quietly go the way of the peg-top trousers and the
tally-ho. Such is the accurate analysis of the future of American fra
ternities made by a non-fraternity man.
When Dr. Wilbur took over the administrative reins of Stanford
he could have abolished campus fraternities on perfectly justifiable
grounds. The fraternities were in a deplorable financial condition. They
were being hounded by the merchants of the Peninsula for bills long
overdue. Their scholastic rating was a disgrace. They were organized
solely "to eat, drink, and'be merry," and they did all three successfully.
But Dr. Wilbur did not abolish fraternities. He suggested remedies for
their ills and put it up to them to sink or swim. On their own initiative
Stanford fraternities satisfactorily improved. But despite all this, fra
ternity men felt that the Administration was biding time when it could
give them the axe, and so the tradition grew up.
Such a clear-cut statement as Dr. Wilbur made in New York leaves
no room for debate on the Administration's attitude toward fraternities.
Their future is entirely in their own hands.
All that Stanford needs now is another unequivocal statement from
him setting forth the University's plan for reorganization of the living
quarters of the campus fraternities and sororities.

tally-ho. Such is the accurate analysis of the future of American fra
ternities made by a non-fraternity man.
When Dr. Wilbur took over the administrative reins of Stanford
he could have abolished campus fraternities on perfectly justifiable
grounds. The fraternities were in a deplorable financial condition. They
were being hounded by the merchants of the Peninsula for bills long
overdue. Their scholastic rating was a disgrace. They were organized
solely "to eat, drink, and'be merry," and they did all three successfully.
But Dr. Wilbur did not abolish fraternities. He suggested remedies for
their ills and put it up to them to sink or swim. On their own initiative
Stanford fraternities satisfactorily improved. But despite all this, fra
ternity men felt that the Administration was biding time when it could
give them the axe, and so the tradition grew up.
Such a clear-cut statement as Dr. Wilbur made in New York leaves
no room for debate on the Administration's attitude toward fraternities.
Their future is entirely in their own hands.
All that Stanford needs now is another unequivocal statement from
him setting forth the University's plan for reorganization of the living
quarters of the campus fraternities and sororities.
The traditional opinion of Stanford fraternity men that the Adminis
tration is decidedly prejudiced against organized living groups was dealt
a harsh blow last week at the National Interfraternity Conference
meeting.
Speaking before representatives of sixty-six national fraternities
from eighty-five universities, Dr. Wilbur went on record as approving
cf fraternities—"good fraternities." Stanford's energetic president has
uttered few truer words than his statement that to abolish fraternities
"would bring about something almost approaching a revolution in Ameri
can colleges." But he did not say whether fraternities would continue to
live and prosper or die a natural death. He infers that their future will
be based entirely on their determined course of action..
IF fraternities would abolish "slapstick methods" of initiation and
thereby attract the increasing number of more mature men coming to
universities from junior colleges. IF the individual groups will make
honest efforts to raise the general plane of their scholarship. IF fra
ternities make their organizations less amateurish—then fraternities will
continue to grow into wholesome organizations that will be assets to
American colleges. But IF fraternities choose the opposite course of
action, they will quietly go the way of the peg-top trousers and the
tally-ho. Such is the accurate analysis of the future of American fra
ternities made by a non-fraternity man.
