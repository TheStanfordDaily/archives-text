# HEARST ATTACKS A DRAGON
## 
### 
Because of his recommendations regarding the relation of the Na
tional government to education, Dr. Wilbur, as Secretary of the Interior,
has drawn the fire of the Hearst newspaper organization. A typical
Hearst attack appeared in the San Francisco Examiner for Friday. If
the newspaper magnate wishes to quarrel with Secretary Wilbur on the
question of creating a separate department of education, that is his
privilege. But his unfair attack on Stanford and his willful misinterpre
tation of the Secretary's annual report is a dishonest and thinly veiled
bid for unthinking public support.
"It is as the spokesman of private education for private interests
that he says that 'a department of education similar to the other depart
ments of the government is not required,' " charges the editorial. "He
views public education from the standpoint of the subsidized head of a
highly endowed private university."
To the people of Stanford who are struggling to improve the Uni
versity under the handicap of a very restricted budget, the chafge that
Dr. Wilbur is the "head of a highly endowed university" would be
laugahble were it not so evidently unjust. As for subsidization in
connection with a university salary, that is humorous.
But more unfair is the attempt to associate Stanford with the recent
attempts of certain interests to use educational agencies to influence
public opinion favorably for private ownership of utilities merely because
it requires no state funds.
In connection with Wilbur's statement that stimulation of state uni
versities has come from the independent institutions, the editoriay waxes
indignant, while it is generally known that the possibility of curtailed
appropriations frequently prevents educational experiment by public
schools. Dr. Wilbur explains, "The hand of centralized government has
been largely kept off the school-teacher and the schoolroom." This
political difficulty Hearst ignores because it cuts the life out of his
argument.
As a matter of fact Secretary Wilbur does not entertain biased
notions in connection with the proposed department. He has secured
funds to conduct a survey of educational conditions with a view to dis
covering whether the need of such a department exists. On the survey
board are such men as Dean Cubberley of the Stanford Education de
partment who are known to favor the creation of such a department of
the National government.
The Secretary believes that such a need does not exist, but he is
willing to be fair and investigate conditions. The Hearst editorial is
obviously unfair and fails to mention Dr. Wilbur's open-mindedness on
the question.
