Some hundred delegates to the convention of the California Scholas
tic Press Association received a vivid impression of "conduct becoming
a Stanford gentleman" at the presentation of "Cock Robin" Friday night.
And the impression was not a favorable one. The usual number of
child-minded individuals in the balcony sent the usual number of paper
airplanes whirling and drifting through the Assembly Hall to the em
barrassment of the usual number of orchestra seat occupants.
The unusual part of the performance was that high school students
did not think the planes were funny or mildly amusing, while Stanford
men applauded long flights.
Evidently it takes higher education to appreciate the finer things
of life.
