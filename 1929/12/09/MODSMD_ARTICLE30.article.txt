MRS. EDDY, by Edwin Franden Da
kin (Charles Scribner's Sons, New
York, 1929)
That, such a candid and accurately
detailed biography of the founder of
a religious movement which now em
braces a considerable part of the
American population today should
cause the disturbance which Edwin F.
Dakin's "Mrs. Eddy" has, is not to be
wondered at. Naturally, when a sect
has elevated its founder to the place
of exalted divinity which Mary Baker
Eddy holds among the Christian Sci
entists, a book which exposes her hu
man frailties will cause great resent
ment.
Indeed, through tireless research,
Dakin has uncovered facts concerning
Mrs. Eddy's life which add no glory
to her name. She is exposed as a
woman inconsistent, irrational, and
self-centered in her theology, her phi
losophy, and her psychology. Her per
sonal violation of the principles which
she propounded is brought to light,
together with some legally honest, but
otherwise shady, business dealings
which bear her name. A vivid imagi
nation is shown to have caused the
publication of (and probably her own
belief in) stories of her early life
which stray far from the truth; and
"Science and Health," her Christian
Science bible, is disclosed as being in
part based on the teachings of one
Phineas P. Quimby.
And all this on good authority.
Countless footnotes refer the reader
to extant letters, documents, records,
and other sources. Dakin apparently
spent many weary months verifying
his material.
But in spite of the frequent biting
remarks which the author has sprin
kled throughout the book (both from
his own pen and that of the caustic
Mark Twain), the entire work is treat
ed with sympathy and understanding.
Mary Baker Eddy is the subject of a
psychological study by Dakin which
reveals her to be the victim of two
very common delusions: those of
grandeur and of persecution. The for

mer, evinced through her love of abso
lute power, deference, pomp, and of
ferings, causes her less suffering than
the latter, which manifests itself, in
her case, in the form of "demonopho
bia" or a fear of demons. All her un
happiness, ill-health, and unpopularity
she attributes to "malicious animal
magnetism" which soon comes to be
known as the awe-inspiring M.A.M.
The evil thoughts of others, coming
through the air, cause her discomfort
and pain—even unto death.
Particularly in the last section of
the book, "The Twilight of a God,"
does Dakin clear himself of all mis
interpretation of Mrs. Eddy's life and
of all unkind intentions. In her last
days, when she is "a pain-racked old
woman almost ready for the grave,"
beset on all sides by persistent report
ers denying her immortality and ques
tioning her sanity, she has lots of fight
left in her. And Dakin shows a sym
pathy for, and an understanding of,
this pathetic little woman, who had
been lonely and without comradeship
all her life; this justifies him com
pletely. He has explained the tragedy
of the abnormal mind without bias
and with an admirable, humane sym
pathy.
And he does not fail to recognize
the worth of the monument which
Mary Baker Eddy left behind her:
Christian Science. In the author's
own words:
"If a single principle can be found
there (in Mrs. Eddy's empire) which
is useful to the world in general, then
humanity need not quarrel with her
memory. It will not matter even that
she may not have been the first to
employ this principle; her contribu
tion will be no less if she merely dem
onstrated it, helped to test it, man
aged to bring it to the attention of
others who might never otherwise
have known that it existed. Her em
pire may even fall into rack and ruin;
yet if from its towers one contribu
tion to human knowledge can be sal
vaged, then Mrs. Eddy's strange uni
verse was an advance in the evolution
of worlds." .m —E. L.
