A BATTLE OF FRONT RANKS
Although not one sturdy linesman
on either team was fortunate, or
lucky, enough to make ail-American
for the year 1929, although both Stan
ford and West Point are better known
in the gridiron world by the spectacu
lar ball-toting of their respective
backfield flashes, the battle of the
28th wilt be largely a clash of forward
walls.
The line that is able to absorb,
as well as administer, the most
socks on the chin, knees in the
ribs, and cleats through the back,
and all the other gentle forms of
punishment which are dished out
to the fourteen pugnacious youths
that go to make up opposing lines
week after week during the fall
season, will likely prove the de
ciding margin of victory.
For, when all is said and done, it
is almost always the playing of the
forward wall that makes or breaks a
team. No champion outfit in the his
tory of pigskin conflicts has ever
boasted a decrepit line. Likewise, no
team with seven stellar linesmen has
played second fiddle, no matter how
mediocre its backfield quartet turned
out to be.
If the line tears open a big
enough hole, a fullback on crutch
es can hobble through for a neat
little gain. But if the forward wall
is pushed around at will by the
opposing team, even a Grange or
a Tricky Dick is helpless in try
ing to advance the ball.
Line play, it seems, has played a
prominent part in deciding the out
come of this year's Coast Conference
race. The Trojans beat Stanford be
cause their forward wall outcliarged
the Card line, and California turned
around and won from Southern Cal
because her line got the jump on the
men from Troy on nearly every play.
And then Stanford knotted the
triangle with a clean-cut victory
over the Bears—because on the
23rd of November the Cardinal
line shoved the Bear forward wall
around, up and down, and across
the Stadium turf as though it
were a mere practice charging
machine!
The 28th will prove no excep
tion to the general rule. Cadet
Cagle has not been named on
mythical squads for the past two
years for nothing. And if the hard
charging Army line is able to pry
apart the Card defense wide
enough for the slippery redhead
to squeeze through, Cadet Cagle
will be off to the races. Similarly,
it's up to the Redshirt front ranks
to get Messrs. Moffatt, Frentrup,
Smalling, et al, out in the open
As for playing ability, the two teams
stack up on even terms. Stanford has
a slight advantage at the center posi
tion, while West Point must be con
ceded an edge at the guard berths.
The tackles and ends are on about a
par.
The outstanding players on the
Card front line this season have been
Walt Heinecke, at the pivot position,
Kay Tandy, at right, tackle, and Cap
tain Muller and Phil Neill at end. To
balance up against these men, Coach
Biff Jones of the Array has a brilliant
array of line talent in Buster Perry,
tackle, Messenger and Carlmark,
ends, and Hillsinger and Humber at
guard.
This Perry person, by the way,
is quite likely to cause the Cards
plenty of trouble before the after
noon festivities are over. This
youngster of 22 summers towers
up in the ozone some six feet
and two inches, tips the scales at
a mere 197 pounds dressed a la
nature, and has only been playing
the old fall pastime in schools of
college standing for the past
seven years. Besides, Mr. Perry is
a übiquitous lad, to say the least,
and roves about the field like
some agile sprinter. The Cards'
intricate offense will have to be
at its best to escape complete
wrecking by this veteran's paws.
At any rate, the Redshirt line will
have to play against the Army as it
did against the Berkeley Bears if
Stanford is going to come out on top
on the 28th. The Cadet line, it must
be remembered, stood up under the
brutal pounding of the Notre Dame
Ramblers for a full sixty minutes
without a single substitution. Yet, if
the Cardinal forward wall can set the
Army linesmen on their backs as it
did all-American Riegels and Schwarz,
Stanford has nothing to worry about.

tory of pigskin conflicts has ever
boasted a decrepit line. Likewise, no
team with seven stellar linesmen has
played second fiddle, no matter how
mediocre its backfield quartet turned
out to be.
If the line tears open a big
enough hole, a fullback on crutch
es can hobble through for a neat
little gain. But if the forward wall
is pushed around at will by the
opposing team, even a Grange or
a Tricky Dick is helpless in try
ing to advance the ball.
Line play, it seems, has played a
prominent part in deciding the out
come of this year's Coast Conference
race. The Trojans beat Stanford be
cause their forward wall outcliarged
the Card line, and California turned
around and won from Southern Cal
because her line got the jump on the
men from Troy on nearly every play.
And then Stanford knotted the
triangle with a clean-cut victory
over the Bears—because on the
23rd of November the Cardinal
line shoved the Bear forward wall
around, up and down, and across
the Stadium turf as though it
were a mere practice charging
machine!
The 28th will prove no excep
tion to the general rule. Cadet
Cagle has not been named on
mythical squads for the past two
years for nothing. And if the hard
charging Army line is able to pry
apart the Card defense wide
enough for the slippery redhead
to squeeze through, Cadet Cagle
will be off to the races. Similarly,
it's up to the Redshirt front ranks
to get Messrs. Moffatt, Frentrup,
Smalling, et al, out in the open
As for playing ability, the two teams
stack up on even terms. Stanford has
a slight advantage at the center posi
tion, while West Point must be con
ceded an edge at the guard berths.
The tackles and ends are on about a
par.
The outstanding players on the
Card front line this season have been
Walt Heinecke, at the pivot position,
Kay Tandy, at right, tackle, and Cap
tain Muller and Phil Neill at end. To
balance up against these men, Coach
Biff Jones of the Array has a brilliant
array of line talent in Buster Perry,
tackle, Messenger and Carlmark,
ends, and Hillsinger and Humber at
guard.
This Perry person, by the way,
is quite likely to cause the Cards
plenty of trouble before the after
noon festivities are over. This
youngster of 22 summers towers
up in the ozone some six feet
and two inches, tips the scales at
a mere 197 pounds dressed a la
nature, and has only been playing
the old fall pastime in schools of
college standing for the past
seven years. Besides, Mr. Perry is
a übiquitous lad, to say the least,
and roves about the field like
some agile sprinter. The Cards'
intricate offense will have to be
at its best to escape complete
wrecking by this veteran's paws.
At any rate, the Redshirt line will
have to play against the Army as it
did against the Berkeley Bears if
Stanford is going to come out on top
on the 28th. The Cadet line, it must
be remembered, stood up under the
brutal pounding of the Notre Dame
Ramblers for a full sixty minutes
without a single substitution. Yet, if
the Cardinal forward wall can set the
Army linesmen on their backs as it
did all-American Riegels and Schwarz,
Stanford has nothing to worry about.

A BATTLE OF FRONT RANKS
Although not one sturdy linesman
on either team was fortunate, or
lucky, enough to make ail-American
for the year 1929, although both Stan
ford and West Point are better known
in the gridiron world by the spectacu
lar ball-toting of their respective
backfield flashes, the battle of the
28th wilt be largely a clash of forward
walls.
The line that is able to absorb,
as well as administer, the most
socks on the chin, knees in the
ribs, and cleats through the back,
and all the other gentle forms of
punishment which are dished out
to the fourteen pugnacious youths
that go to make up opposing lines
week after week during the fall
season, will likely prove the de
ciding margin of victory.

23rd of November the Cardinal
line shoved the Bear forward wall
around, up and down, and across
the Stadium turf as though it
were a mere practice charging
machine!
The 28th will prove no excep
tion to the general rule. Cadet
Cagle has not been named on
mythical squads for the past two
years for nothing. And if the hard
charging Army line is able to pry
apart the Card defense wide
enough for the slippery redhead
to squeeze through, Cadet Cagle
will be off to the races. Similarly,
it's up to the Redshirt front ranks
to get Messrs. Moffatt, Frentrup,
Smalling, et al, out in the open
As for playing ability, the two teams
stack up on even terms. Stanford has
a slight advantage at the center posi
tion, while West Point must be con
ceded an edge at the guard berths.
The tackles and ends are on about a
par.
The outstanding players on the
Card front line this season have been
Walt Heinecke, at the pivot position,
Kay Tandy, at right, tackle, and Cap
tain Muller and Phil Neill at end. To
balance up against these men, Coach
Biff Jones of the Array has a brilliant
array of line talent in Buster Perry,
tackle, Messenger and Carlmark,
ends, and Hillsinger and Humber at
guard.
This Perry person, by the way,
is quite likely to cause the Cards
plenty of trouble before the after
noon festivities are over. This
youngster of 22 summers towers
up in the ozone some six feet
and two inches, tips the scales at
a mere 197 pounds dressed a la
nature, and has only been playing
the old fall pastime in schools of
college standing for the past
seven years. Besides, Mr. Perry is
a übiquitous lad, to say the least,
and roves about the field like
some agile sprinter. The Cards'
intricate offense will have to be
at its best to escape complete
wrecking by this veteran's paws.
At any rate, the Redshirt line will
have to play against the Army as it
did against the Berkeley Bears if
Stanford is going to come out on top
on the 28th. The Cadet line, it must
be remembered, stood up under the
brutal pounding of the Notre Dame
Ramblers for a full sixty minutes
without a single substitution. Yet, if
the Cardinal forward wall can set the
Army linesmen on their backs as it
did all-American Riegels and Schwarz,
Stanford has nothing to worry about.

A BATTLE OF FRONT RANKS
Although not one sturdy linesman
on either team was fortunate, or
lucky, enough to make ail-American
for the year 1929, although both Stan
ford and West Point are better known
in the gridiron world by the spectacu
lar ball-toting of their respective
backfield flashes, the battle of the
28th wilt be largely a clash of forward
walls.
The line that is able to absorb,
as well as administer, the most
socks on the chin, knees in the
ribs, and cleats through the back,
and all the other gentle forms of
punishment which are dished out
to the fourteen pugnacious youths
that go to make up opposing lines
week after week during the fall
season, will likely prove the de
ciding margin of victory.
For, when all is said and done, it
is almost always the playing of the
forward wall that makes or breaks a
team. No champion outfit in the his
tory of pigskin conflicts has ever
boasted a decrepit line. Likewise, no
team with seven stellar linesmen has
played second fiddle, no matter how
mediocre its backfield quartet turned
out to be.
If the line tears open a big
enough hole, a fullback on crutch
es can hobble through for a neat
little gain. But if the forward wall
is pushed around at will by the
opposing team, even a Grange or
a Tricky Dick is helpless in try
ing to advance the ball.
Line play, it seems, has played a
prominent part in deciding the out
come of this year's Coast Conference
race. The Trojans beat Stanford be
cause their forward wall outcliarged
the Card line, and California turned
around and won from Southern Cal
because her line got the jump on the
men from Troy on nearly every play.
And then Stanford knotted the
triangle with a clean-cut victory
over the Bears—because on the
23rd of November the Cardinal
line shoved the Bear forward wall
around, up and down, and across
the Stadium turf as though it
were a mere practice charging
machine!
