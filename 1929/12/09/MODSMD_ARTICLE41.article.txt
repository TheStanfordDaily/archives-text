# Radio Club, A.I.E.E. Inspect Federal Telegraph Plant
## 
### 
Forty members of the Radio Club
and the Stanford branch of the Amer
ican Institute of Electrical Engineers
inspected the Palo Alto laboratory of
the Federal Telegraph Company on a
field trip Saturday morning. Divided
into two groups of 20 each, the stu
dents were conducted through the en
tire plant and saw a number of the
experiments now in progress.
Among the features of special in
terest were the automatic high speed
radio transmitting room which is en
tirely controlled from San Francisco,
a high frequency furnace for melting
metals, and a new process for weld
ing with atomic hydrogen produced
by an electric arc.
The visitors also saw the process
of manufacturing radio tubes, a dem
onstration of the radio compass for
ships and airplanes, and the method
of recording the sound part of talking
movies.
