## 
### 
License plates for 1930 will be dis
tributed by the local representative of
the State Division of Motor Vehicles
at the Palo Alto police station from
December 16 to January 15, announces
J. R. Murison of the department. Of
fice hours will be fi'om 10 to 4 o'clock.
1929 registration certificates and
three dollars in cash must be present
ed to secure the new plates. In case
the certificate has been lost, applica
tion for a duplicate will be provided
for an additional fifty cents and the
plates will be forwarded by mail from
Sacramento.
Non-residents who bring their cars
to the office can have them inspected
and will be given assistance in mak
ing their applications, but as these
have to be verified from San Francisco
or Sacramento, the plates will be
mailed. This class of registration
should better apply directly to San
Francisco, according to Murison.
