"Student traffic violators on the
campus have no comeback to the ef
fect that Officer John Olsen's car is
not painted white," declared Comp
troller Almon E. Roth yesterday."It
is a matter of breaking University
regulations and not State laws as far
as students are concerned.
"It is not necessary to have a white
automobile to enforce University traf
fic rules any more than it would be
to enforce violations of the Honor
Cade," Roth pointed out.
However, Olsen's car will be painted
white anyway, Roth stated, in order
to avoid all argument, and also so
that outsiders, whom campus regula
tions do not cover, may be brought to
account.
