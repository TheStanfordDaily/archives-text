XXfrf'.* a
new stepper in
the right direction!
TT'S the newest dance record by Guy Lombardo and His Royal
X Canadians, so of course it's another peppy foot-warmcr.
Lombardo plays these two snappy hits (no need to introduce
them to you!) in the smooth, moderate tempo you hear on
all the smartest dance floors. And into each number he injects
skilful musical embroidery of his own that will have you say
ing, "Give me that one!"
Hear these other new hits, also ....
