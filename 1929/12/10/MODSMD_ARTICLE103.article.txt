# Cardinals Open Final Practice Drive
## WARNERMEN START THREE-WEEK GRIND FOR SOLDIER TILT Varsity Faces Prospect Of Rain-Soaked Workouts; Army Due Dec. 21 
### Stephen Dietrich 
With less than three weeks of prac
tice remaining before the big inter
sectional gridiron event of the 1929
season, the Stanford-West Point clash
of December 28th, the Cardinal var
sity swung into action yesterday af
ternoon for its first real workout
since the Big Game.
And for the first time this year,
Coach Pop Warner was forced to drill
his charges on a turf slightly oozing
with moisture. Outside of their en
gagement with the Washington Hus
kies in the slush and muck of the
Seattle Stadium, the Cards have not
yet toted the pigskin in the rain. But
although wet weather is predicted for
the next couple of weeks, Pop let it
be known yesterday afternoon that
the team will practice every day from
now on —rain or shine!
Army Gets Jump on Cards
Stanford has no time to lose in
preparing for the Army invasion, as
the Cadets already have a week's
jump on their Western rivals. Coach
Biff Jones has been working his boys
hard for the past few days, both on
offense and in perfecting a defense to
check the Cards' tricky attack of re
verses, spins, laterals, and passes.
Scheduled to leave New York early
next week, the Pointers will arrive at
the Farm on December 21. Immedi
ately after unpacking their tooth
brushes and establishing their head
quarters in Fort Branner Hall, the
entire squad of Army players, some
ninety strong, will trot out on the
practice field to shake the kinks out
bf their joints from the long train
ride out West. The Cadets will con
tinue to work out daily until kick-off
time on the 28th.
Cardinals in Good Shape
As for the condition of the Stanford
players, according to Dr. E. F. Roth,
team physician, all of the Cards will
be in shape to see action against the
Cadets. Rudy Rintala is still bothered
with a weak ankle, but the sophomore
reserve halfback is once more run
ning signals with the rest of the
squad.
Rumors that several of the Stan
ford players would be declared ineli
gible before the game due to scholas
tic difficulties were said by members
of the B.A.C. yesterday evening to be
entirely unfounded. Players who have
been up in their work so far during
the present season can not be dropped
from athletic competition because of
poor grades until the beginning of
winter quarter—or after January 2.
Probable Lineup
Although definite starting lineups
will not be announced until just be
fore game time on the 28th, following
is a list of players who will probably
face each other at the opening kick
off:
West Point Stanford —

players, according to Dr. E. F. Roth,
team physician, all of the Cards will
be in shape to see action against the
Cadets. Rudy Rintala is still bothered
with a weak ankle, but the sophomore
reserve halfback is once more run
ning signals with the rest of the
squad.
Rumors that several of the Stan
ford players would be declared ineli
gible before the game due to scholas
tic difficulties were said by members
of the B.A.C. yesterday evening to be
entirely unfounded. Players who have
been up in their work so far during
the present season can not be dropped
from athletic competition because of
poor grades until the beginning of
winter quarter—or after January 2.
Probable Lineup
Although definite starting lineups
will not be announced until just be
fore game time on the 28th, following
is a list of players who will probably
face each other at the opening kick
off:
West Point Stanford —
Carlmark LER Muller (C)
Perry LTR Tandy
Hillsinger LGR Driscoll
Miller C Heinecke
Humber RGL Bardin
Price RTI i Thompson
Messenger REL Preston
Carver Q Fleishhacker
HuUhinson LHR Rothert

With less than three weeks of prac
tice remaining before the big inter
sectional gridiron event of the 1929
season, the Stanford-West Point clash
of December 28th, the Cardinal var
sity swung into action yesterday af
ternoon for its first real workout
since the Big Game.
And for the first time this year,
Coach Pop Warner was forced to drill
his charges on a turf slightly oozing
with moisture. Outside of their en
gagement with the Washington Hus
kies in the slush and muck of the
Seattle Stadium, the Cards have not
yet toted the pigskin in the rain. But
although wet weather is predicted for
the next couple of weeks, Pop let it
be known yesterday afternoon that
the team will practice every day from
now on —rain or shine!
Army Gets Jump on Cards
Stanford has no time to lose in
preparing for the Army invasion, as
the Cadets already have a week's
jump on their Western rivals. Coach
Biff Jones has been working his boys
hard for the past few days, both on
offense and in perfecting a defense to
check the Cards' tricky attack of re
verses, spins, laterals, and passes.
Scheduled to leave New York early
next week, the Pointers will arrive at
the Farm on December 21. Immedi
ately after unpacking their tooth
brushes and establishing their head
quarters in Fort Branner Hall, the
entire squad of Army players, some
ninety strong, will trot out on the
practice field to shake the kinks out
bf their joints from the long train
ride out West. The Cadets will con
tinue to work out daily until kick-off
time on the 28th.
Cardinals in Good Shape
