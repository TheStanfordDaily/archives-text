## Card Varsity Opens Season December 21 Against San Francisco Quintet 
### Bob Van Etten 
The 1930 edition of the Stanford bas
ketball varsity meets its first test De
cember 21 when the Cardinals tackle the
strong Y.M.I, quintet in Kezar Pavilion,
San Francisco.
Practice scrimmages every night are
giving Coach "Husky" Hunt a line on
his best performers and are ironing out
the wrinkles in offensive and defensive
play. Concentration of late has been on
developing a man-to-man defense which
will be used intermittently with the zone
defense used ordinarily last season.
Competition Stiff
Such a stiff battle for positions is go
ing on among the twenty-four prospec
tive basketball men playing football, will
cided not to cut the squad further and
will retain all twenty-four throughout
the season.
At present Fawcett and Tyler, for
wards, McCandless, center, and Reynolds
and Rowley, guards, appear to have a
slight edge on their competitors, but are
being closely pressed by Weaver, Ray,
Doub, Mears, Baker, and a host of oth
ers. Most of the squad is expected to sec
action in the four preliminary games
scheduled over Christmas vacation.
Vets Hard Pressed
According to Hunt, Captain Rothert,
Rintala, Thompson, and Moffatt, prospec
tive basketbal lmen playing football, will
have a tough time breaking into the line
up for this season. Stanford will play
U.C.L.A. in the first conference game
on January 11, a scant two weeks after
the Cards meet West Point on the grid
iron.
With fifteen games scheduled against
tough opponents, Coach Jimmy Brad
shaw's frosh quintet will find a busy
season awaiting them. The frosh play
their first game against the St. Mary's
yearlings on January 3. Among promi
nent high school state league contenders
which the first-year men will meet are
Palo Alto, Piedmont, Stockton, Fresno,
and Galileo. The usual three-game series
against the California Cubs is scheduled
for January 25, February 15, and Febru
ary 22.
Frosh Lineup
Bradshaw expects his starting lineup
to consist of Hancock and Mead, guards,
Tway, center, and Palmer and Dyer or
Caudry, forwards. Others who will prob
ably see considerable action throughout
the season are Glasgow and Fry, guards,
and Payne, forward. Twenty men make
up the freshman squad at present, but
Bradshaw plans to cut the list to fifteen
men on Fridav.
