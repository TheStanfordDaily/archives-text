# CHARLES KELLOGG TO SPEAK THURSDAY AT PALO ALTO THEATRE
## 
### 
Charles Kellogg, celebrated naturalist
and "bird singer," will lecture at the
New Stanford Theater at 10 and 11
o'clock Thursday morning. The lectures
are primarily for children, but interestftd
adults may secure information at Sher
man, Clay & Company.
A peculiar construction of Kellogg's
throat enables him to closely imitate the
calls of many birds. He also uses a high
vocal note to direct an automobile by
remote control. This "mystery car' ' will
be demonstrated after the lectures.
On Kellogg's last visit to Palo Alto,
two years ago, he was the guest of Dr.
and Mrs. David Starr Jordan, who are
among the sponsors of the present lec
tures.
