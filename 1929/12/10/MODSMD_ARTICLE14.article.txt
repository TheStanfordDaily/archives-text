## 
### 
HONGKONG, Dec. 9. (#»)—Twelve
persons were killed, about 60 native
passengers drowned, and 40 or more
wounded last night when a swarm of
Chinese pirates fought with the crew
of the British steamship Haiching for
its possession.
Three American women were wit
nesses to the bloody conflict and
spent hours of terror aboard the ship
before British destroyers, the Sterling
and the Sirdar, came to its aid. Much
of the superstructure of the vessel
was burned. It finally made port here
from Swatow.
