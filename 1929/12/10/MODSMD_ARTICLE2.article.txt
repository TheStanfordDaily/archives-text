# OLD BOY IS JOYFUL; HOLIDAY ISSUE IS DUE ON CAMPUS THURSDAY
## 
### 
"Only fifteen days to Christmas,"
shouted the Old Boy yesterday as he
joyously clicked his heels and tangled
himself up in his long gray beard, "and
there's only two days to the next Chap
pie." The "Holiday Number" of Chapar
ral, which Ippears on the campus Thurs
day, according to the Ancient VVheezer,
will contain many sidelights on the com
ing game with Army as well as a little
cheer for the finals.
The cover of the December issue is
drawn by that rising young inkslinger,
Fred Hubler, and has a touch of West
Point. Then there is verse by Burnell
â– Gould and his boon companion Philip
Space, and by Dariel Amyx, as well as
some artistry by Gregor Duncan. An
other item of interest is a charming full
page article by Nels Carter and Joe
Thompson entitled "Christmas Nifties for
Kin Folk." *
