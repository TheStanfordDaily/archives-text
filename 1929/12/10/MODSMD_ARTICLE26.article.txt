Henry Cowcll, editor of "New Music,"
a quarterly periodical devoted to publish
ing new music by American composers,
will speak on "Music in Russia" tonight
in the Assembly Hall at 7:30 o'clock.
Cowell has demonstrated his theories in
many of the outstanding universities and
conservatories in this country and abroad,
including the San Francisco School of
Fine Arts, Cleveland Institute of Music,
University of Sorbonne of Paris, and the
Conservatory of Moscow.
Cowell's compositions have been per
formed by numerous musical organiza
tions and such artists as San Francisco
String Quartet, Roland Hayes, and Eve
Gautier.
He is recognized as a composer who is
introducing significant new materials in
music, and his playing of his own com
positions has created great interest both
here and abroad. He produces tonal val
ues not possible on another instrument,
yet possessing unusual musical effect.
This lecture will be the last of the se
ries of lectures sponsored this fall by
the Committee on Public Exercises, and
will be open to the public.
