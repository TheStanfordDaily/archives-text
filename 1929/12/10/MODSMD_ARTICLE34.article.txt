# "THE CONVENTION CAMPUS"
## 
### 
Although Stanford lias no efficient Chamber of Commerce to adver
tise its attributes in magazines ranging from Child Life to the National
Geographic, it is becoming the Los Angeles of the North, far famed as
an admirable convention university. Already this year there have been
the Pacific Intercollegiate Press, the Western Comic Association, and
the California Scholastic Press Association conclaves on the campus. And
the next is the National Student Federation of America meeting on the
campus in January.
Committees working under the general supervision of the student
body president have been hard at work preparing an interesting program.
Every moment of the convention time will be utilized to consider ques
tions concerning the smallest of campus problems up to the greatest ones
of international purport. Standing committees will report on the work
of the N.S.F.A. for 1929. Special committees will give the results of
investigations on sororities, fraternities, athletics, and the honor system.
With such a well-balanced plane of activity, the delegates cannot miss
getting something worth while out of the meeting.
As the result of such conventions, Stanford's reputation will be aug
mented more than it could be by its national track and football teams.
Stanford must pool all her resources in making the 1930 N.S.F.A. con
vention a successful one.
All Stanford needs now is a perpetual Jimmie Walker or Mayor Rolph
to glad-hand the delegates to put it 011 the map as the"convention cam
pus."
