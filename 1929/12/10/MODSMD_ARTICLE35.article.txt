# NEWS REEL JINGOISM

### 
There are men and women in America who have an earnest desire for
peace; men and women who believe that the price of war is too dear
for humanity to pay; men and women whose vision is broad enough to
permit their seeing the futility of armed strife and the unbelievable, use
less horror which will attend conflicts of the future.
Such people, earnestly believing in peace and working for peace, are
performing a great service for humanity. It seems sad—it seems criminal
even—that such work is being undone daily by agencies that are moulding
public opinion.
The press of this country —notably the Hearst press—is among these
deteriorating agencies, but even more outstanding are the moving picture
corporations which produce the so-called news reels that are shown every
day in the cinema theatres, disseminating militaristic propaganda through
every city and hamlet of the country.
A newspaper man can be more tolerant of these practices than any
other, perhaps, because a newspaper man, trained to understand what the
public wants, can appreciate the fact that guns and soldiers and flags and
battle ships have an appeal that cannot be neglected by any agency which
is striving to live 011 jx)pular interest.
But any newspaper man can testify that the proportion of sach reel
devoted to preparation for war is completely out of balance. There is
absolutely no justification, by standards of news value, human interest
or anything else, for the amount of bald army and navy propaganda
which is foisted on the public.
The National Board of Review, the Motion Picture Academy of Arts
and Sciences, Will Hays, and the various other agencies which represent
themselves as being ambitious to improve the moral and intellectual fiber
of the films would spend their time better investigating this situation than
they spend it now, timing kisses and striving for a new era of art.
There is more real immorality in one war-steeped news reel than there
is in ten sex dramas.
