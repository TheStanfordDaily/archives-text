# WHAT, NO PAPERS?

Stanford students will rise tomorrow morning and find a slight change
in the regular routine —something lacking, perhaps, to make it different
from most Wednesday mornings. Some—how many it is hard to deter
mine—will realize that there is no Daily to read while dressing or while
sipping morning coflfce.
Because even type slingers must study once in a while and because the
University does not allow activities during the week preceding finals, this
paper will cease the quarter's publication with today's issue.
The next paper will be delivered on January 2, Registration day. Until
then the staff wishes the campus good luck in finals and signs off with a
merry Christmas to all!
