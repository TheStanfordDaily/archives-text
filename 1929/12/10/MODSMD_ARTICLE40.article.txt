THE EMPEROR JONES — Ralph
Chesse's Marionette Playhouse
Eugene O'Neill's story of the Pullman
porter who became emperor of a West
Indian island is peculiarly well adapted
to presentation in a puppet theatre. Ralph
Chesse takes advantage of the opportuni
ties offered both by the lines and setting
to make this production fully as effective
as it could be in a legitimate theatre.
The role of the Emperor Jones, even
on the legitimate stage, seems no more
than a glorified marionette, and the dis
ordered mind typical of O'Neill charac
ters is vividly portrayed on the miniature
stage. The use of shadow puppets as an
illustration of what is taking place in
the fear-stricken emperor's mind is par
ticularly good. The green and pink shad
ows against a background of tom-tom
beats seem as mad as the delusions of
Jones himself.
From the prologue—Vachel Lindsay's
"Congo"— to the silver bullet that kills
the fleeing emperor, the audience is hardly
able to realize that these are inanimate
puppets.
Both the sets and the puppets were de
signed and constructed by Ralph Chesse.
The puppets are both well made and well
handled, and the sets, particularly that
for the proolgue, are excellent.
The theatre is located at 566 Merchant
Street, and the play will be presented on
Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays, and
Saturdays until December 14.

THE COCK-EYED WORLD. At
the New Stanford
"The Cock-eyed World" makes you
long for the return of the good old si
lent drama. Not all of the time, of
course. The storming of a rebel outpost
in the tropics, for instance, is a superb
scene, and the sound effects—the whining
of projectiles dropped from an airplane
at a dizzy height ,the crackling of ma
chine guns—are chiefly responsible for
its effectiveness.
The atmosphere of marine life is exu
berantly portrayed, and the color and
shifting variety of the scenes from me
tropolis to Russia, and from Russia to
the tropics, give a lively pictorial quality
to the show.
But if you go to see this picture be
cause you have a vivid memory of the
magnificent performances of Victor Mc-
Laglen and Edmund Lowe as the stars of
"What Price Glory" in the back of your
mind, you will be hugely disappointed.

In "What Price Glory," everyone in the
audience was equally impressed whether
he could figure out what Flagg and Quirt
were saying or not. In this picture, al
though Flagg and Quirt talk very loud,
and go off into enormous horse-laughs
every few feet of film, the effect is one
of offensive coarseness and noisiness—
and is anything but impressive. "Sez
you," from Quirt, and "Sez me," from
Flagg, is about the height of their bril
liance. "The Cock-eyed World" repre
sents a notable instance of the superi
ority of a silent show over a talkie in
certain situations. What was highly en
tertaining and amusing in the former be
comes bawdy and obnoxiously crude in
the latter. Probably there is no more
smut in this show than in the average,
but its particular brand is somehow un
pleasantly obtrusive and blatant.
Victor McLaglen can't help being a
great actor. He is splendid even in as
weakly constructed and poorly directed a
show as "The Cock-eyed World." Lily
Damita, a new star, has marvelous en
ergy, and a flashing smile—but her se
ductiveness is not convincing.

PECCADILLOES, short stories by
Faraday Keene. New York: John
Day Company.
Did you ever read a short story and
have someone ask you what it was about,
and then answer: "I don't remember, but
it was good"? Just such stories are Fara
day Keene's tales in the collection, Pec
cadilloes. A half-hour later one has to
coerce his memory to remember the plots,
but ideas beyond the stories stick.
Not that Peccadilloes have no action.
On the contrary, throughout these tales
there is a continuous excitement—mur
ders, suicide, adultery—but it is the liv
ing personalities, the subtle disclosure of
human relationships that hold the atten
tion.
Faraday Keene writes in an O. Henry
manner that goes that favorite one better.
There is the poignant characterization;
there is the one-sentence climax at the
end. But unlike O. Henry the climax is
one of idea rather than action, and the
reader can tell with meticulous accuracy
what the future of each of the characters
will be.
The stories arc ironic but not cynical—
justice operates as it might if a merry
minded human, full of wisdom and mal
ice, were Destiny itself.
