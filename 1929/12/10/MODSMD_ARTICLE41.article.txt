# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD...
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF DECEMBER 10, 1904

The University Debating Club voted
down the proposal of an intercollegiate
freshman debate with California. Taking
into consideration the small interest taken
by the general student body in debates, the
faculty and student members of the club
thought it wise not to add another annual
debate to the two debates then held every
year with California.
Student Manager Barrett turned over
$3,068.83 to the training house fund, the
largest amount yet paid to the fund by
the associated students. Half of the sum
came from athletic receipts and the rest
from student assessments and the balance
of the proceeds from the gross receipts
the previous year.
Faculty athletic committees of Stanford
and California met and unanimously rec
ommended a change in freshman and var

sity standings, making it necessary for a
man to maintain good standing in his uni
versity for one year before becoming eli
gible to play on the varsity. This plan,
it was thought, would do away with pro
fessional men "hired" to play for a team
during the season and would also prevent
men from playing a hard varsity season
in their first year and endangering their
scholastic standings.
Dr. Doremus Scudder lectured on the
Hawaiian Islands and their religions. The
interest of American missionaries was
aroused, he said, when a Hawaiian boy
was found on the steps of Yale Univer
sity crying for knowledge.
David V. Cowden, '03, was selected to
coach the 1905 baseball team. While in
Stanford Cowden had played four years
on the varsity, and had been elected stu
dent body treasurer in his last year.
