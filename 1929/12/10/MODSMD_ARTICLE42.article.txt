# N.S.F.A. DISCUSSION GROUPS HELP IN SOLVING CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF STUDENT BODY
## 
### Arthur McGarr 
Each year at the National Students'
Federation's conferences various discus
sion groups meet and consider problems
that are being faced by universities and
colleges today. More ideas and mutual
benefits are perhaps obtained from these
discussions than the rest of the conven
tion put together.
In higher educational bodies of today
virtually the same problems are being
faced in one locality as in another. Each
school has its problems of honor system,
fraternities, student publications, student
government, and a host of others that
only time and intelligent treatment will
solve. That the N.S.F.A. is holding its
fifth annual conference at Stanford the
first live days in January will cast a sig
nificant influence on the discussions that
are carried 011 during the meeting.
Stanford Progressive
Stanford is a progressive school and
the solutions of its various problems are
rather different than those worked out at
other institutions. All organized non-fra
ternity group, division oi legislative and
judicial bodies in student government, de
ferred rushing, and the honor system are
illustrations that Stanford will have to
offer in the way some of these problems
have turned out in actual practice.
/vt last year's meeting of the N.S.F.A.
at Columbia, Missouri, much attention
was paid to honor systems in the uni
versities and college. At Stanford this

versities and colelges. At Stanford this
part of faculty and students alike and
the "creaking" of our own system has
called forth much writing of editorials
and campus opinions and many a budding
orator has felt called upon to express his
opinion in voluminous discourse.
Colleges Face Like Problems
Upon reading the committee report 011
this question, one finds that almost ex
actly the same problems have come up in
the working out of the honor system in
other American universities that have
come up out here. Approximately 40 per
cent of the schools in this country are
using the honor system and of this num
ber only one, Washington and Lee, re
ports that it is working perfectly.
In the general discussion of the honor
system it was agreed that its potential
values lay in its training of students for
future citizenship and development of
character through responsibility, and that
the honor system puts a soul into an edu
cational institution. Everyone agreed that
the advantages of an honor system more
than outweighed its disadvantages.
