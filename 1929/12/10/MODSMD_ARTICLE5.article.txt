# SENIORS DEFEAT FROSH IN CLASS BASKETBALL TILT
## 
### 
Playing fast basketball, a senior quintet
downed the frosh 32-22 in interclass play
last night. Offensive play of the seniors
was superior to that of their opponents,
and a tight defense by the upperclassmen
held down the scoring efforts of the
freshman forwards.
In a hard-fought argument the juniors
downed the sophomores 16-14. Trailing
14-4 at the end of the first half, the sec
ond-year men pulled a comeback that
barely fell short. Due to a ruling by
Coach "Husky" Hunt, Weaver, Loomis,
Mears, Griffith, and Bailey, varsity play
ers but not lettermen, who featured the
juniors' win from the freshmen last week,
did not play last night.
Final games of the interclass series will
be played Thursday night when the fresh
men meet the sophomores at 7 :30 and the
juniors and seniors tangle at 8:30. Both
games will be played in Encina gym.
