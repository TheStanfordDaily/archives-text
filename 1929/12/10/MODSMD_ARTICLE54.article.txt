# ROBLE ISN'T WHAT IT USED TO BE IN GAY NINETIES
## Fewer Women Made Old Hall More Congenial in Early Days; Men Now Living There, Call It Sequoia 
### Leonard Kullmann 
"The girls of the old Roble had a
much better time than the girls who
live in the present Roble," stated
Miss Gertrude Gardiner, in sketching
the varied past of the old Roble Hall
to the Daily reporter. Miss Gardiner
was for seventeen years matron at
both old and new Roble. "There were
fewer girls in the hall —only 109 —
compared with the number in Roble
today, and consequently all the girls
were much better acquainted.
Sequoia !s Old Roble
"From 1891 until 1918 when the
present Roble was built, the present
Sequoia Hall served as the women's
dormitory. During that time the first
floor contained the dining room and
some bedrooms, while the reception
rooms were on the second floor. The
present 'bull pen' or wing over the
dining hall was used on the second
floor for the music room, while on the
third floor it contained the maids'
quarters.
No One Injured in Quake
"No one was injured in Roble by
the earthquake of 1906, although sev
eral young ladies went to sleep in
their rooms on the third floor and

awakened rather suddenly in the par
lors on the second story when the
floor of their rooms collapsed. The
quake moved the foundation of the
hall but one-eighth of an inch; the
only damage was caused by the fall
of the chimneys. Encina was so badly
damaged that most of the boys were
forced to eat at Roble."
Today in place of the 109 women,
the hall holds 175 men and is called
Sequoia, since the name Roble was
preserved for the women's dormitory.
The parlors of the gay '90's are re
placed by a billiard table and a read
ing room, but for the most part the
hall is unchanged in spite of the
change of character of its occupants.
