lOWA CITY, Dec. 9. (ff)—Dr. E. H.
Lauer, director of athletics at the Uni
versity of lowa, has put into poetry
his version of how the Big Ten be
came the Big Nine. Closing his talk
at a mass meeting of students and
alumni at lowa City yesterday, Lauer
recited:
Ten Western Conference schools
Getting along fine;
One went amateur —
And then there were nine.
Among teams mentioned on the
lowa campus as possible football con
tenders next season were Nebraska,
Big Six champions, Missouri, Drake,
and Notre Dame.
The lure of distance also has been
strong and the athletic department
was understood to be negotiating with
such teams as Army, Southern Cali
fornia, Pitt, Stanford, and other East
and West Coast teams.
