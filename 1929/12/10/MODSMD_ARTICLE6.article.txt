# MEASURE OF ATOMIC WEIGHT IS DESCRIBED TO PHYSICAL SOCIETY
## 
### 
Description and illustration of the most
accurate method ever devised to measure
the weight of atoms featured the discus
sion of Professor R. T. Birge, of the
University of California, at the 160 th
regular meeting of the American Physi
cal Society at Stanford during the past
week-end. The new method is the result
of research carried on by Dr. Birge and
Dr. A. S. King of the Mount Wilson Ob
servatory.
The work of Dr. George R. Harrison
and Dr. Philip A. Leighton, of Stanford,
in the extreme ultra-violet range of the
spectrum came in as another high point
in the discussion. Dr. Harrison and Dr.
Leighton have been occupied with re
search in light of such short wave-length
that it will not penetrate even the atmos
phere.
Dr. D. L. Webster, executive head of
the department of physics at Stanford,
was elected chairman of the meeting.
Eminent scientists from all over the state
were present.
