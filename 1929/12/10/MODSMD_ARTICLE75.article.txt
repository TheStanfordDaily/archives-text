# PRESIDENT CONSENTS TO HOLDING PLACE IN GENEVA CONFERENCE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C„ Dec. 1 (if).—
American adherence to the world court
again hinges on the Senate, but President
Hoover, who authorized the affixing of
the signature of this nation to the revised
protocol at Geneva today, is expected to
give the Senate some time for reconsid
eration.
Hoover has been informed that another
stubborn Senate contest is in prospect,
even under the revised protocol. He is
not expected by Senate leaders to inject
this question before the return of Secre
tary Stimson from the forthcoming Lon
don Naval Arms Conference.
The Senate group which unsuccessfully
opposed American adherence to the court
when it was voted by 76 to 16 three \ears
ago has given notice that the modifica
tion of the Senate's reservation which is
embodied in the revised protocol is not
acceptable.
