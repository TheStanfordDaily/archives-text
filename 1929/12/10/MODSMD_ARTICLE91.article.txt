## "IN THE WINTER A YOUNG MAN'S FANCY " 
### 
I Clinging to such feeble straws
as All-American, All-Coast, and
All-Hohokus Valley teams in a
last desperate effort to prolong
his stay on the sport sheets, Old
Man Football is fast slipping from
the public gaze. Everywhere but
in California, where there is sun
shine the year 'round (advt.) the
gridiron sport has been interred
with appropriate burial services.
On the coast the Carnegie Tech
„.U.S.C., Stanford-Army, Pittsburgh-
U.S.C., and Shrine East-West con
tests remain to be played before
the boards are cleared for that
up-and-coming sport, basketball.
Speedy Game
A good basketball game is about the
fastest thing that man plays on foot,
and the most exciting to watch. Every
year the cage sport is gaining in
favor, with packed pavilions greeting
court "naturals." And this year should
be no exception, with classy fives
looming for any number of colleges
and universities.
This should be Stanford's year on
the hardwood, in conference play, if
not on the entire coast. With only
one man from last year's squad miss
ing, the Cardinals are in a favorable
Tiosition. California loses Captain Cor
bin, keystone of the Bear quintets for
three years, Stevens, a rattling good
forward, and Gregory, a good stand
ing guard. With only a fair freshman
team from which to draw replace
ments, the Berkeleyans may have a
tough row to hoe.
South May Surprise
The other two conference members,
Southern California and U.C.L.A., may
spring something in the nature of a
surprise, especially the Trojans, who
begin a new coaching regime under
Sam Barry. Barry comes from the
Middle West, where they play basket
ball with a vengeance. U.C.L.A., from
all reports, has a marvel first-year
squad to help matters along, but the
Cards, with their veteran aggregation,
should prove strong enough to take
both of them. However, prognasticat
ing February basketball encounters
during December is equally as healthy
as diving oft' the Woolworth Tower
with a rock in each hand, and Stan
ford will have to play out her con
ference schedule anyway.
As usual, St. Ignatius and Santa
Clara will put first-flight teams on
the court. The Ignations lose no
one from last year's great squad
that swept the coast with only
one defeat, and Santa Clara must
fill only one gap left by gradua
tion. At the present time, no other
teams appear especially danger
ous, but plenty can happen be
tween now and next February.
