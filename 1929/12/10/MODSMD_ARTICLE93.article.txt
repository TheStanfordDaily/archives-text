# Iowa, Ousted From Big Ten, Seeks New Athletic Fields
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Dec. 9 (/P).â€”The Univer
sity of lowa, after a 30-year membership
in the Western Conference, is casting
al>out for new athletic relationships.
Disappointed because its efforts to cor
rect athletic abuses charged failed to
satisfy the faculty committee of the West
ern Conference, lowa officials, alumni and
students today faced a new situation,
with plans for national conquests, rather
than sectional honors. The athletic board
of the outlawed institution will meet to
morrow to outline a definite policy.
