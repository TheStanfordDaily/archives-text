# WEST ELEVENS SET TO REPEL EASTERN GRIDIRON INVASIONS
## Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh Lead Drive to Upset Coast Supremacy 
### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. (/P) â€”The drive
of the Eastern football forces upon
the Far Western front, comprising the
last major maneuvers of the gridiron
season, begins this wfcek.
Carnegie and Pittsburgh join the
Army in an attack that has for its ob
jective the recovery of laurels lost
last year when the hordes from the
Pacific Coast over-ran everything in
sight.
Carnegie plays Southern California
Saturday at Los Angeles. Within the
next fortnight, Pitt's Panthers, as well
as West Point's Cadets will be on
the march West, by easy stages. The
soldiers are assigned to the Palo Alto
sector, determined on a final drive to
break their "jinx" of 1929, win a ma
jor battle, and at the same time obtain
revenge for the walloping adminis
tered by Stanford at the Yankee Sta
dium last year. On the basis of the
form Red Cagle and his mates dis
played against Notre Dame, their
chances for overthrowing the Cardi
nals appear worth some ballyhoo.
This 1929 Army team has the stuff
and Palo Alto may be the spot they
have been looking foV to exhibit it.
So far the West Coast has tumbled
considerably below its 1928 standard
of intersectional play.
California beat Pennsylvania and
Oregon State surprised Detroit, but
three defeats offset these victories.
Southern California dropped the deci
sion to Notre Dame. Washington was
trounced by Chicago, and in the lat
est, longest-range intersectional tilt,
Oregon fell before Florida's fast array.
