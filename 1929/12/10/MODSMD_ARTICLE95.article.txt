# PENN, COLUMBIA, AND WASHINGTON SEEKING NEW GRIDIRON HEADS
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Dec. 9 (£>).—'The usual
result of teams that couldn't win is be
ginning to be seen around the major foot
hall circuits.
Charles Crowley is out as head coach
at Columbia following several poor sea
sons. Crowley, who succeeded the late
Percy Haughton, tried hard to make a
winner out of a young team this year,
but failed to win a major game.
Enoch Bagshaw resigned his coaching
position at the University of Washington,
where he had been connected with ath
letics for 14 years, first as a star football
player. Bagshaw was asked to leave dur
ing a season that brought no confercnce
victories to the Huskies.
It was a different story with Lou
Young at Penn. Young voluntarily
stepped down because, he said, business
and other things forced him to leave the
coaching field. Young was Penn's head
coach for seven years.
