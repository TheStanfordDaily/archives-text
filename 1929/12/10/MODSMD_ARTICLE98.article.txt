# STOWAWAY QUARTER SAVES GAME FOR DEAR OLD PASADENA JAYSEE
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 9. (/P) â€”Joe
Marquette is one stowaway who made
good.
Two weeks ago when the Pasadena
Junior College football team shipped
to the Hawaiian Islands for a game
with the KameHameHa School of
Honolulu, Joe, a third-string quarter
back, was dropped from the squad.
He had other ideas, however, so he
stowed away on the boat.
A touchdown behind and with only
three minutes to go in the game
played yesterday, Coach Frank Baker
cast a worried eye around and spied
Joe sitting on the bench.
"Jump in there, stowaway, an' do
your stuff," he shouted.
Joe jumped, landed in a huddle,
snapped a signal and tossed a long
pass to Cox who scampered across for
a touchdown.
Pasadena won 14 to 13.
