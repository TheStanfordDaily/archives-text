## Needs of Campus To Be Met More Adequately By Enlarged Sheet Staff Puts Out 8-Column Paper Today as Climax Of 37-Year Expansion 
### 
This morning the Stanford Daily
tppears for the first timo as an
light-column daily newspaper,
narking a new era in the history
this 38-year-old publication.
With 3,500 copies per hour being
irinted on the new 30-ton Duplex j
lat bed web press, the Daily will
ie able to meet the news needs of
he campus for years to come.
Eight pages is the maximum
printing capacity of the new press.
However, special editions will be i
• nply cared for under the existing I
incitements.
Much Paper Needed
.'lie press requires more than
200 pounds of paper for an hour's
Minting of eight pages. With four ,
lages this is reduced one-half.
The machine was installed in a [
special room in the new University i
Press building.
The founding of the University !
n 1892 saw the establishment of a |
our-page, four-column weekly. By i
1900 the Daily Palo Alto had come !
into existence, still four columns, j
but published every afternoon.
The change to five columns came
in 1915 and in 1921 the daily paper
graduated to six columns. Six years
later, in 1925, the change was made
to seven columns.
Name Changed
To avoid confusion with the j
Daily Palo Alto Times, the edi- |
lorial board of the 1926 Daily an- j
thorized the change in name and j
time of publication to the "Stan- ]
ford Daily" and it became a morn- !
ing paper the autumn quarter of j
1926. |
With eight columns the Daily's !
coverage of the local news field
will be expanded. Additional na- j
tional and foreign news will be i
available to Daily readers.
