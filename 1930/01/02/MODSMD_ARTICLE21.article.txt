### 
MARKING the opening of the first convention ever held west of the
Mississippi, more than 150 National Students' Federation ot' America
delegates to the Fifth Annual Congress were registered on the campus
yesterday. Men and women student leaders from large and small institu
tions throughout the United States flocked to The Farm —a Mecca
where collegiate problems and questions of student matters will be
considered.
Ursel C. Narver, Oregon State College, '28, is president of the na
tional federation of students. John Van Amridge, '28, is general chair-

♦ man of the Fifth Annual Congress,
while Herbert E. Wenig is the
Stanford general chairman.
Wednesday noon the Executive
Committee of the Federation held
a luncheon meeting in (he Stanford
Union. This was the first official
act of the convention. In the after
noon delegates were entertained
I with a tour of the campus organ
ized by members of the reception
committee. Following the tour, tea
was served in the Women's Club
house.
Official Opening
The official opening of the con
vention occurred in the Women's
Clubhouse last night following a
dinner at Encina Commons. Stan
ford Steinbeck, Dr. Robert E.
Swain, and Ursel C. Narver were
the speakers of the evening.
Narver, president of the National
Students' Federation of America,
stressed the keynote of the con
vention in his address to the dele
gates.
"It is especially fitting that we
should be meeting here for the
Fifth Annual Congress. The pro
gressive spirit of this University
| is peculiarly in harmony with the
I attitude of the Federation. Stan
; ford, with buildings and a campus
of unusual beauty, has never for
gotten Gladstone's works to a
! group of Oxford men, 'Not your
buildings but your men have made
you great.'
Fields of Activity
"In looking ahead we must not
! lose sight of the three distinct
' fields of activity the Federation
must serve. First there is the mat
| ter of service such as making avail
able detailed information concern
ing student government. The sec
ond field is student problems, both
' national and international. There
are three pressing needs of the
American college at the present,
time. They are the assimilatio 1
I the freshmen into the tvaditi >i
! and life of the college, and provision
{ sion for participation in the activi
ties and friendships of undergradu-
I ates by the non-fraternity men, and
j an interest in the welfare of for
j eign students.
"The third Held is international
j work. This field includes arrang
i ing American student tours of for
] eign countries, reception of visit
ing foreign groups, arrangement of
! international debate tours, and the
stimulation of student thought on
! problems of world citizenship."
