Even the wealth of propaganda
. supplied by Graham McNamee, the
! Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce, and the Executive Commit
! tee of the Tournament of Roses
! failed to convince a couple of Stan
j ford football players that Los An
| geles nights are warm and balmy,
i not even in the rooms of the Bilt-
I more Hotel.
Discouraged by the cold recep
tion' with which the management
met their requests for heat, the
boys, with true Cardinal enterprise,
1 built and ignited a second edition
of the Big Game bonfire in the
! bathtub.
j But only for a few minutes did
the boys enjoy the fruits of their
efforts. Disturbed by huge clouds
of smoke wafting about the iifth
floor, someone turned in an alarm,
j and in a short while most of Los
I Angeles' fire engines were fighting
j for parking space in front of the
j Biltmore, With that, expert skill
j which comes only from long prac
j tice the firemen put out the blaze,
] and the boys despairingly aban
j doncd their efforts to keep warm.
The management explained that
â– the boys had apparently failed to
notice their sign: "Kindly do not
! scratch matches on the wall."
