# ANOTHER FLEDGLING TAKES FLIGHT

Today the Daily chortles editorially.
For today the Daily isn't what it used to he. There are eight
columns where there were once hut seven. And that means the
Stanford Daily is a full sized newspaper.
The Daily modestly admits that it may not he quite the news
paper that the Xew York Times is. hut at least its columns are equal
in width and number per page to the Times' columns. And that is
something, to those of journalistic inclinations.
This improvement was made possible by the installation of a
Duplex flat-bed web press in the new University Press building to
replace the antique machinery which has printed this newspaper
for many years. The new equipment, and the larger paper size
which it permits, will mean much to the realization of the ideal
of modern journalism.
Eight columns for this paper will do more than satisfy the
editorial vanity of its staff. The additional space and the standard
ization of the column width will mean a fuller, better newspaper,
from the reader's point of view, and a more satisfactory medium,
from the point of view of the advertiser.
The improvement was made posible only by the co-operation
of the Executive Committee. It is still in something of an experi
mental stage, but it is an experiment which can't well fail.
