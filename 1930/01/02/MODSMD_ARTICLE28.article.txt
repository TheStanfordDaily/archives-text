### 
To those who have long objected to buying education at Stan
ford prices, the news that the sum of fifteen dollars will he tacked
onto the quarterly tuition fee of new students seems a bit shocking.
Much is being said concerning "academic highway robbery" on the
Farm.
But after all, the present Stanford generation need lose no
sleep over the increase, for those in school will go on paying the
usual rate until they graduate. It will be next year's freshmen, and
the freshmen ad infinitum, who suffer.
So t protests from the present Stanford generation are unneces
sary. Jll addition to being unnecessary such complaints are un
called for. Stanford is a private institution, dependent upon cer
tain limited sources of income. Important among these sources is
the tuition fee levied on each student.
It is unfortunate and lamentable that more money is necessary.
Hut since more money is necessary, only one course lies open—that
of securing a greater income.
'1 he whole problem simmers down to this. If a person is a
staunch enough believer in the theory that a private university is
superior to a public one, that person may attend Stanford rather
than < alifornia or I.( .L.A. There is 110 compulsion. All one
has to do is pay the price, just as one must pay the price for be
lieving the Cadillac is a better automobile than the Ford.
1 hat, unfortunately, is how our social system works.
