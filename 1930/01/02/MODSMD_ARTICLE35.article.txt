THE GALAXY: Susan Ertz.
Stisun hJrl/, continues the excel
lent writing which m ule "East In j
West" a best selli r, in '"t he (.lal- '
axy." A novel iu the biographical
style, ii avoids the usual superfluity
of detail ami the consequent lack
ol" Interest in a story which lakes >
its main character front childhood i
to death, II contains enough detail
to provide a more than adequate .
picture of the period from LS(>o to
1920, lini this background remains
a background and in no way de
tracts from either plot or charac
ters.
The story of Laura Deverell's
j suppressed childhood, her struggle
I for mental freedom, her unfortu
, nate, conventional marriage, and
j her final happiness in a union un-;
I blessed by society or church, is
! poignant and challenging. IVliss i
i Ertz makes her characters show I
I their own weaknesses and strengths
with an amazing clarity. Laura is |
j dominated, sometimes for her own
j good (but only sometimes) by four
■ men in turn. During her childhood,
she lives under the iron rule of her
bigoted, stupidly conventional, hy
pocritical father. During adole
scence, she is led by her mentally
j superior younger brother, an un
happy poetic genius, maladjusted
I to his environment and times. An j
unfaithful, egotistical husband at- j
tempts to suppress her. And finally
her lover leads her to a sane and
beautiful, though unconventional,
| philosophy.
The sidelights on the history of 1
the period are instructive as well ;
: as interesting. For instance, a;
"model ship which will fly, THE
! LELAND STANFORD, made in i
1 Palo Alio, California," is men- ;
tioned; and the San Francisco fire]

is given the best dwseriptiou we
have yet reuil of it.
'The (Jalaxy" will not only inter
t-nt you; it will make you think.

ROMANCE OF THE RIO
GRANDE—Varsity.
Warner Baxter's second big success
is presented somewhat in the fashion
of his In st, "In ()lil Arizona." Again
he appears as a handsome, dark
skinned lover with a Spanish accent in
Fox's newest romance of caballeros,
vaqnero , senoritas, and the rest of it.
It is the story of a prodigal grand
son who stayed away from the family
hacienda because bis father had been
an American, lie gets into a battle
with bandits, is wounded, and his horse
carries bin! to the ranch where he is
duly reciii.'nixed and welcomed.
Enter the dark-eyed damsels, Mona
Maris and Mary Duncan, and his
Mexican blood winning out, lie decides
to stay on. Antonio Moreno is the
villain and there are several thrilling
gun battles as well as comedy and gay
songs.
GLORIFYING THE AMERI
CAN GIRL —Stanford.
In a Ziegfeld extravaganza which
is different from others of the kind
only in the rather bitter ending, Mary
Eaton, star of "The Cocoanuts," is
appearing; at the Stanford in "Glori
fying tin- American Girl." Full of re
vue acts, featuring Rudy Vallee and
"I lis Connecticut Yankees," Eddie
Cantor, and Helen Morgan, this 100
per cent talking, singing, dancing,
technicolor, all-star film is good only
if von like it; for the revue acts are
the whole show and the story of Glori
fied Gloria's rise from a department
store song shop to the applause and
flowers of a Ziegfeld act is rather
commonplace and poorly told.
