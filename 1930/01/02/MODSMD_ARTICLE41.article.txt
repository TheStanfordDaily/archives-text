The new shop building of Stan
ford University Press, completed
at a cost ol' $50,000 and doubling
the manufacturing capacity of the
Press, went into service as the old
year closed.
Begun in mid-September, there- I
inforced concrete structure moved
to completion on strict schedule,
and the work of moving equipment I
began on December 10. The build- I
irig houses all machinery for the
setting, printing, and binding of !
Stanford Books, augmented by new i
equipment in press room and bind- j
ery, and a complete composing and i
press room for the Stanford Daily, j
Rapid Growth
The new building was made
necessary by the rapid develop
ment of the Press following it* j
entry into the field of book publish
ing in 1925. The catalogue now
lists more than 200 titles of books
printed and distributed by the
Press. In addition to this book-pub
lishing activity, the Press serves j
as printers to the University and j
to its various departments and or
ganizations, including the Food Re
search Institute, the Hoover War
Library, and the Dudley Herbarium, j
Now a department of the Univer- i
sity under the authority of the J
Board of Trustees, the Press had j
its origin in a job press plant set '
up by a student, J. A. Quelle, in the j
early days of Stanford. This print- I
ing shop was bought by the Uni- ]
versity in 1917 and moved to its
present location, opposite ltoble
gym.
60 Employed

are employed at. the Press, some
of whom have been employed here i
