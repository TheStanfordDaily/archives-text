opening contest on December 21 to
the Young Men's Institute, 38-26, in
j an overtime affair, and another on De
i cember 26 to the visiting Oregon State
| hoop artists, 29-24, but found time in
! between these two affrays to journey
I to Reno and trounce Nevada Univer
j sity's Sagehens in a brace of tilts.
'I he \ .M.I. game was a nip and
j tuck affair that found the two fives
I tied at 25-25 at the close of the regular
' playing period, but saw the Cardinal
j defense crack wide open in the over
i time period as Russ Hamni, Institute
j forward, ran wild to ring up five
buckets by himself and clinch victory
for his team.
Johnny McCandless and Hill Doub
were the bright stars of the Cards'
| twin triumph in the Sagebrush me
i tropolis, the former leading the scor
ers in the first game with eleven points,
and Doub duplicating his feat with the
same total in the second game.
Oregon State's visiting firemen out
classed the Cards in the first half,
leading by a 14-6 count at the gun
and increasing the lead to 25-16 late
in the second half. Here the Red
shirts rallied, Mike Reynolds dropping
one from midcourt and Red Berg ring
ing three in a row to bring the score
to 25-24, but Grayson, the Staters'
star guard, made the outcome certain
with a pair of one-handed baskets that
left the final score 29-24.
j St. Mary's is bringing an assort
j ment of long shot artists to the cam
| pus tomorrow night, headed by Butch
| Simas, erstwhile member of the Four
Blue Ghosts. The Gaels take shots
I from anywhere and everywhere, and
j are dangerous every minute, promising
' the Cards a real argument. In a pre
j liminary tilt, the Card Babes take on
j the Moraga yearlings.

j St. Mary's is bringing an assort
j ment of long shot artists to the cam
| pus tomorrow night, headed by Butch
| Simas, erstwhile member of the Four
Blue Ghosts. The Gaels take shots
I from anywhere and everywhere, and
j are dangerous every minute, promising
' the Cards a real argument. In a pre
j liminary tilt, the Card Babes take on
j the Moraga yearlings.
With an even break in four games
j over the holidays to their credit, Coach
j Husky Hunt's varsity cagers were
preparing today to tangle with St.
Mary's Gaels in the pavilion tomorrow
night at 8 o'clock.
The Redshirt quintet dropped its
opening contest on December 21 to
the Young Men's Institute, 38-26, in
j an overtime affair, and another on De
i cember 26 to the visiting Oregon State
| hoop artists, 29-24, but found time in
! between these two affrays to journey
I to Reno and trounce Nevada Univer
j sity's Sagehens in a brace of tilts.
'I he \ .M.I. game was a nip and
j tuck affair that found the two fives
I tied at 25-25 at the close of the regular
' playing period, but saw the Cardinal
j defense crack wide open in the over
i time period as Russ Hamni, Institute
j forward, ran wild to ring up five
buckets by himself and clinch victory
for his team.
Johnny McCandless and Hill Doub
were the bright stars of the Cards'
| twin triumph in the Sagebrush me
i tropolis, the former leading the scor
ers in the first game with eleven points,
and Doub duplicating his feat with the
same total in the second game.
Oregon State's visiting firemen out
classed the Cards in the first half,
leading by a 14-6 count at the gun
and increasing the lead to 25-16 late
in the second half. Here the Red
shirts rallied, Mike Reynolds dropping
one from midcourt and Red Berg ring
ing three in a row to bring the score
to 25-24, but Grayson, the Staters'
star guard, made the outcome certain
with a pair of one-handed baskets that
left the final score 29-24.
