## 
### 
Recognizing the Stanford Univer
sity Press as one of the leading pub
lishing houses of its kind in the coun
try, the executive committee of the.
organization in individual interviews
to the Daily yscterday expressed ad
miration and satisfaction with the
growth and development of the Press.
The members of the committee—A.
K. Roth, University comptroller; Na
than van Patten, director of the Stan
ford University Libraries; Will A.
Friend, manager of the Press; Wil
liam Hawley Davis, editor; and David
Lamsou, sales manager—offered the
following comments on the new shop
building:
A. E. Roth:
"The University expects the Press
to become the finest printing and pub
lishing house in the West. Plans for
future construction already take the'-
form of another shop unit the same
size as the present new building, and
an administration building fronting
Lomita Drive."
Nathan van Patten:
"The expansion of the University
Press very naturally arouses the in
terest and enthusiasm of everyone con
nected with the University Libraries.
During recent years there has been a
steady increase in sympathetic co-op
eration between Stanford University
Press and the Stanford University Li
braries. The library has been very
distinctly served by the craftsmen of
the Press in meeting its very special
requirements as to binding and print
ing. In return the staff of the library
frequently has been of service to the
Press particularly in its ability to sup
ply specialized information of a biblio
graphical nature and concerning the
technical aspects of cataloguing.
"In developing the library's typo
graphical collections, the needs of the
Press have been continually kept in
mind.
"The Director of University Libra
ries is very happy to have this oppor
tunity of congratulating the University
Press upon its many notable achieve
ments in the past and to extend, quite '
appropriately at the beginning of the
New Year, his best wishes for a pros
perous future."
Will A. Friend:
"The new building, however proud
we might be of it, represents not a
goal but a starting point. Our chief
pleasure in it is for the promise it
gives of still greater accomplishments
for the Press.
"We arc looking forward to the time
when Stanford University Press will
stand as one of the greatest names in
book publishing in the country, just as
Stanford University is acclaimed in
educational circles. Meanwhile we are
thoroughly grateful for these new fa
cilities to aid us not alone in serving
the printing needs of the University,

but also to help us make Stanford '
Books worthy in every respect of the j
University."
William Hawley Davis:
" The endorsement of the Press's j
I achievement provided by the fine new !
j quarters for its manufacturing depart- !
! ment i*. naturally most welcome and j
! is accepted as a means and a stimulus |
! toward steadily improving its service!
i in tbe publishing world from this far- |
j western region. I wish especially to j
I express our gratitude to the authors
; and faculty advisers who have helped |
I to induce the healthy growth which the I
I Press lias experienced."
' David Lamson:
| "The fact that Stanford Books went j
j to 36 foreign countries last year indi- I
Jcates that the Press is fulfilling a real !
] function here. The new manufactur- j
jing plant gives us one of the best shops j
jin the country, and makes Stanford!
I one of the few university presses to
j maintain a complete manufacturing!
J service. New bookmaking facilities,
making possible increased production!
laud still lower book prices, will pro- |
vide a direct stimulus to sales."
