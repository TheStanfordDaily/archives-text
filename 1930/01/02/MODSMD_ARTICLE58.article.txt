### 
Mechanical equipment In the new
I'niversity Press building will en
able the local plant to compete with
the be t of publishing houses, ac
cording to rieon B. Smith, for 11
years head of the pressroom.
Ui': id s the Daily press, the new
shop building houses presses for
making Stanford Books including:
one press taking a sheet of printed
matter :JS by 50 inches, two other
presses taking a sheet 2X by 40
inches, a Kelley automatic, and
three platen presses. Sixteen pages
of Chaparral or the Stanford Illus
trated Review may be printed at
the rate of 2,<><)o an hour.
improved Conditions
Improved working conditions in
l the composing room, pressroom,
and bindery include better light
ing and heating, in addition to a
fifty per cent increase in floor
space. The floors are of end-grain
j redwood blocks which increase the
resiliency of the floor, making it
easier to work, and cutting down
the vibrations occasioned by the
huge presses.
The lower portion of the walls
are painted a dark green, the upper
portion to a light green, and the
saw-tooth ceiling white, to provide
the most scientific lighting condi
tions. Tina saw-tooth roof admits
only north light, and the electric
lights are of the "daylight" type
' so that expert color workmen can
i distinguish tints and shades. "A
hundred and fifty per cent increase
in color work has taken place since
1 came to the Press," Smith ex
f plained.
