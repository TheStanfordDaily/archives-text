WITH the appointment to its staff of Mr. James E. Frank, '29, Stanford University Press
announces the inauguration of a new type of printing service to the Stanford Family.
Mr. Frank's responsibility will be to aid you in formulating your ideas, and to bring them to
the finished product of paper and ink promptly and efficiently. He will see that your printing
wants are satisfied at a minimum of time, trouble, and expense. In this service he will be as
sisted by the entire Press personnel of sixty skilled workers, operating the most modern equip
ment in a thoroughly up-to-date plant. A 'phone call to Local 113 will bring Mr. Frank to your
office at any time. University people will remember "Jim" Frank as Manager of the Stanford
Daily and Chairman of the Publications Council during the academic year 1928-1929.
