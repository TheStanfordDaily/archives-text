# POP'S STALWARTS WIN RECOGNITION SWAMPING CADETS
## Cagle Stopped Cold as Critics Admit That Cards Are Good 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Now that the West Point game
is a matter of football history, a
mere last year's spectacle, all that
remains is for the unsubsidized
followers of the big red to I
slip the Administration a large cut
of their wagers collected on the
28th, the players themselves to try
and get some learning (lining the
next two quarters, after first elect
ing a new captain, and the press
wiseacres to add a few finishing
touches of comment.
As for last Saturday's spec
tacle, it was a huge suueess
from a Stanford standpoint.
Displaying the same brand of
ball as in the Big Game, Coach
Pop Warner's stalwarts not
only closed their 1329 season in
a fitting manner, but they
gained the national recogni
tion that was due them as well.
After the game, coaches and
sports critics all over the coun
try admitted that Stanford was
on a par with the various so
called champion elevens. Some
maintained that the Cards
could have easily defeated the
Pitt Panthers on the 28th,
while the Army players let it
be known that they considered
the Redshirts superior to Knute
Rockne's Ramblers.
At any rate, the East now knows
that last year's 26 to 0 rout at the
Polo Grounds was no fluke!
From a West Point angle, the
game was a flop. The Cadets came
out to the Coast determined to
avenge last year's defeat, but, when
the final gun popped, the future
generals were only too glad to
leave the Stadium trailing by a
score of 34 to 13. For the longer
the Cadets played, the more de
crepit. they became. They wilted
completely in the fourth quarter,
and the game ended with West
Point rapidly losing yardage.
This Cagle person, by the
way, was most disappointing
to the 75,000 cash customers
that were lured into the Sta
dium last Saturday 1 by newfc
that the elusive' redhead was at
top form and anxious to display
his ground-gaining wares to the
Western public. A majority of
the fans paid to see Captain
Chris Cagle perform, but they
actually saw several Cards play
so well as to make Mr. Cagle
look like a dub by comparison.
At a banquet the night after the
game, Cagle said that the Cadets
had a hotter time than they had
expected. Not that he was 'refer-
ring to the weather, but the game
wasn't very minutes old before
Chris wished he was back amid
the blizzards and snowdrifts of
New York. There he would at least
have had a chance to slip on the
ice and slide down the field for a
score. For although playing on the
fastest gridiron in his long and
brilliant career, Cadet Cagle was
unable to break away even once
for a gain suitable to his reputa
tion.
One does not wish to discredit
or razz Mr. Cagle, for at times he
flashed some real playing ability.
Several times he slipped through
the line for short gains, when the
average back would have been held
at the line of scrimmage. And his
bullet pass to Hutchinson, which
scored Army's second touchdown,
was a nice piece of work.
Nevertheless, some of the
Icss-ballyhooed Cadets stole
the show for West Point. Mur
iel and Hutchinson looked good
in the Army backfield, while
Perry, McLain, and Miller stood
out in line play. Yet, as a
whole, the future generals
played like undicipliined buck

privates.
But although badly outclassed
by the Cardinals, the Cadets went
back home with the distinction of
doing to Stanford what no other
team was able to do during the last
football season. West Point scored
a touchdown on a running play!
No other team in 1929 was able to
shove over a score against the
Redshirts except by forward pass
ing.
On the other hand, the white
jerseyed backs trotted up and
down the turf all afternoon for
handsome gains. The Army ends,
who played such an outstanding
game against Notre Dame, might
as well have been sitting on the
bench, as far as stopping plays
was concerned. At the same time,
the center of the Cadet line sagged
on every buck, while at best the
tackles played in-and-out ball.
Although all of the Rerishirts
played like "super-Cagles,"
Chuck Smalling stood out as
the hero of the day. He packed
the ball as he never packed it
before, and piled up a total
gained yardage three times
that of his nearest competitor,
Mr. Cagle. Once, he broke
through the entire Army team
for a 46-yard run, shaking off
four or five would-be tacklers,
dodging the safety man like an
elusive-hipped halfback, and
was finally brought down from
behind deep in West Pointe ter
ritory. Besides, Mr. Smalling
played a whale of a defensive
game; and replaced Bob Sims
in bdwlin'g over the flashy
Cagle, just as the latter was
about to break away for cer
tain scores.
Another Redshirt that looked
like an all-American, if anyone
ever has, was Captain Mush
Muller. Muller played a better
game than both of the Army
ends together, and then some.
The other outstanding feature of
the day was the punting of Messrs.
Rotliert and Moftatt. They both
out-booted the highly heralded Mur
rel, for distance and in placing the
ball.
One performance that most
pleased was that of Perry Tay
lor. With Heinecke out of the
game on account of a bad cold,
Stanford was confronted with
a supposedly weak place at
center. However, Taylor plug
ged up the hole so well that he
looks to be a cinch to hold
down the pivot position next
fall.
All of the other players came in
for their share of the glory: Frent
rup, Fleishhacker, Hillman, Clark,
and Caglieri in the backfield, and
Tandy, Driscoll, Wilson, Bardin,
Thompson, Dawson, Klabau, Bush,
Bogue, Neill, Preston, and M. Al
bert son at line positions.
Now that the West Point game
is a matter of football history, a

touches of comment.
As for last Saturday's spec
tacle, it was a huge suueess
from a Stanford standpoint.
Displaying the same brand of
ball as in the Big Game, Coach
Pop Warner's stalwarts not
only closed their 1329 season in
a fitting manner, but they
gained the national recogni
tion that was due them as well.
After the game, coaches and
sports critics all over the coun
try admitted that Stanford was
on a par with the various so
called champion elevens. Some
maintained that the Cards
could have easily defeated the
Pitt Panthers on the 28th,
while the Army players let it
be known that they considered
the Redshirts superior to Knute
Rockne's Ramblers.
At any rate, the East now knows
that last year's 26 to 0 rout at the
Polo Grounds was no fluke!
From a West Point angle, the
game was a flop. The Cadets came
out to the Coast determined to
avenge last year's defeat, but, when
the final gun popped, the future
generals were only too glad to
leave the Stadium trailing by a
score of 34 to 13. For the longer
the Cadets played, the more de
crepit. they became. They wilted
completely in the fourth quarter,
and the game ended with West
Point rapidly losing yardage.
This Cagle person, by the
way, was most disappointing
to the 75,000 cash customers
that were lured into the Sta
dium last Saturday 1 by newfc
that the elusive' redhead was at
top form and anxious to display
his ground-gaining wares to the
Western public. A majority of
the fans paid to see Captain
Chris Cagle perform, but they
actually saw several Cards play
so well as to make Mr. Cagle
look like a dub by comparison.
At a banquet the night after the
game, Cagle said that the Cadets
had a hotter time than they had
expected. Not that he was 'refer-
ring to the weather, but the game
wasn't very minutes old before
Chris wished he was back amid
the blizzards and snowdrifts of
New York. There he would at least
have had a chance to slip on the
ice and slide down the field for a
score. For although playing on the
fastest gridiron in his long and
brilliant career, Cadet Cagle was
unable to break away even once
for a gain suitable to his reputa
tion.
One does not wish to discredit
or razz Mr. Cagle, for at times he
flashed some real playing ability.
Several times he slipped through
the line for short gains, when the
average back would have been held
at the line of scrimmage. And his
bullet pass to Hutchinson, which
scored Army's second touchdown,
was a nice piece of work.
Nevertheless, some of the
Icss-ballyhooed Cadets stole
the show for West Point. Mur
iel and Hutchinson looked good
in the Army backfield, while
Perry, McLain, and Miller stood
out in line play. Yet, as a
whole, the future generals
played like undicipliined buck

privates.
But although badly outclassed
by the Cardinals, the Cadets went
back home with the distinction of
doing to Stanford what no other
team was able to do during the last
football season. West Point scored
a touchdown on a running play!
No other team in 1929 was able to
shove over a score against the
Redshirts except by forward pass
ing.
On the other hand, the white
jerseyed backs trotted up and
down the turf all afternoon for
handsome gains. The Army ends,
who played such an outstanding
game against Notre Dame, might
as well have been sitting on the
bench, as far as stopping plays
was concerned. At the same time,
the center of the Cadet line sagged
on every buck, while at best the
tackles played in-and-out ball.
Although all of the Rerishirts
played like "super-Cagles,"
Chuck Smalling stood out as
the hero of the day. He packed
the ball as he never packed it
before, and piled up a total
gained yardage three times
that of his nearest competitor,
Mr. Cagle. Once, he broke
through the entire Army team
for a 46-yard run, shaking off
four or five would-be tacklers,
dodging the safety man like an
elusive-hipped halfback, and
was finally brought down from
behind deep in West Pointe ter
ritory. Besides, Mr. Smalling
played a whale of a defensive
game; and replaced Bob Sims
in bdwlin'g over the flashy
Cagle, just as the latter was
about to break away for cer
tain scores.
Another Redshirt that looked
like an all-American, if anyone
ever has, was Captain Mush
Muller. Muller played a better
game than both of the Army
ends together, and then some.
The other outstanding feature of
the day was the punting of Messrs.
Rotliert and Moftatt. They both
out-booted the highly heralded Mur
rel, for distance and in placing the
ball.
One performance that most
pleased was that of Perry Tay
lor. With Heinecke out of the
game on account of a bad cold,
Stanford was confronted with
a supposedly weak place at
center. However, Taylor plug
ged up the hole so well that he
looks to be a cinch to hold
down the pivot position next
fall.
All of the other players came in
for their share of the glory: Frent
rup, Fleishhacker, Hillman, Clark,
and Caglieri in the backfield, and
Tandy, Driscoll, Wilson, Bardin,
Thompson, Dawson, Klabau, Bush,
Bogue, Neill, Preston, and M. Al
bert son at line positions.
Now that the West Point game
is a matter of football history, a
mere last year's spectacle, all that
remains is for the unsubsidized
followers of the big red to I
slip the Administration a large cut
of their wagers collected on the
28th, the players themselves to try

ball as in the Big Game, Coach
Pop Warner's stalwarts not
only closed their 1329 season in
a fitting manner, but they
gained the national recogni
tion that was due them as well.
After the game, coaches and
sports critics all over the coun
try admitted that Stanford was
on a par with the various so
called champion elevens. Some
maintained that the Cards
could have easily defeated the
Pitt Panthers on the 28th,
while the Army players let it
be known that they considered
the Redshirts superior to Knute
Rockne's Ramblers.
At any rate, the East now knows
that last year's 26 to 0 rout at the
Polo Grounds was no fluke!
From a West Point angle, the
game was a flop. The Cadets came
out to the Coast determined to
avenge last year's defeat, but, when
the final gun popped, the future
generals were only too glad to
leave the Stadium trailing by a
score of 34 to 13. For the longer
the Cadets played, the more de
crepit. they became. They wilted
completely in the fourth quarter,
and the game ended with West
Point rapidly losing yardage.
This Cagle person, by the
way, was most disappointing
to the 75,000 cash customers
that were lured into the Sta
dium last Saturday 1 by newfc
that the elusive' redhead was at
top form and anxious to display
his ground-gaining wares to the
Western public. A majority of
the fans paid to see Captain
Chris Cagle perform, but they
actually saw several Cards play
so well as to make Mr. Cagle
look like a dub by comparison.
At a banquet the night after the
game, Cagle said that the Cadets
had a hotter time than they had
expected. Not that he was 'refer-
ring to the weather, but the game
wasn't very minutes old before
Chris wished he was back amid
the blizzards and snowdrifts of
New York. There he would at least
have had a chance to slip on the
ice and slide down the field for a
score. For although playing on the
fastest gridiron in his long and
brilliant career, Cadet Cagle was
unable to break away even once
for a gain suitable to his reputa
tion.
One does not wish to discredit
or razz Mr. Cagle, for at times he
flashed some real playing ability.
Several times he slipped through
the line for short gains, when the
average back would have been held
at the line of scrimmage. And his
bullet pass to Hutchinson, which
scored Army's second touchdown,
was a nice piece of work.
Nevertheless, some of the
Icss-ballyhooed Cadets stole
the show for West Point. Mur
iel and Hutchinson looked good
in the Army backfield, while
Perry, McLain, and Miller stood
out in line play. Yet, as a
whole, the future generals
played like undicipliined buck

privates.
But although badly outclassed
by the Cardinals, the Cadets went
back home with the distinction of
doing to Stanford what no other
team was able to do during the last
football season. West Point scored
a touchdown on a running play!
No other team in 1929 was able to
shove over a score against the
Redshirts except by forward pass
ing.
On the other hand, the white
jerseyed backs trotted up and
down the turf all afternoon for
handsome gains. The Army ends,
who played such an outstanding
game against Notre Dame, might
as well have been sitting on the
bench, as far as stopping plays
was concerned. At the same time,
the center of the Cadet line sagged
on every buck, while at best the
tackles played in-and-out ball.
Although all of the Rerishirts
played like "super-Cagles,"
Chuck Smalling stood out as
the hero of the day. He packed
the ball as he never packed it
before, and piled up a total
gained yardage three times
that of his nearest competitor,
Mr. Cagle. Once, he broke
through the entire Army team
for a 46-yard run, shaking off
four or five would-be tacklers,
dodging the safety man like an
elusive-hipped halfback, and
was finally brought down from
behind deep in West Pointe ter
ritory. Besides, Mr. Smalling
played a whale of a defensive
game; and replaced Bob Sims
in bdwlin'g over the flashy
Cagle, just as the latter was
about to break away for cer
tain scores.
Another Redshirt that looked
like an all-American, if anyone
ever has, was Captain Mush
Muller. Muller played a better
game than both of the Army
ends together, and then some.
The other outstanding feature of
the day was the punting of Messrs.
Rotliert and Moftatt. They both
out-booted the highly heralded Mur
rel, for distance and in placing the
ball.
One performance that most
pleased was that of Perry Tay
lor. With Heinecke out of the
game on account of a bad cold,
Stanford was confronted with
a supposedly weak place at
center. However, Taylor plug
ged up the hole so well that he
looks to be a cinch to hold
down the pivot position next
fall.
All of the other players came in
for their share of the glory: Frent
rup, Fleishhacker, Hillman, Clark,
and Caglieri in the backfield, and
Tandy, Driscoll, Wilson, Bardin,
Thompson, Dawson, Klabau, Bush,
Bogue, Neill, Preston, and M. Al
bert son at line positions.
Now that the West Point game
is a matter of football history, a
mere last year's spectacle, all that
remains is for the unsubsidized
followers of the big red to I
slip the Administration a large cut
of their wagers collected on the
28th, the players themselves to try
and get some learning (lining the
next two quarters, after first elect
ing a new captain, and the press
wiseacres to add a few finishing
touches of comment.

maintained that the Cards
could have easily defeated the
Pitt Panthers on the 28th,
while the Army players let it
be known that they considered
the Redshirts superior to Knute
Rockne's Ramblers.
At any rate, the East now knows
that last year's 26 to 0 rout at the
Polo Grounds was no fluke!
From a West Point angle, the
game was a flop. The Cadets came
out to the Coast determined to
avenge last year's defeat, but, when
the final gun popped, the future
generals were only too glad to
leave the Stadium trailing by a
score of 34 to 13. For the longer
the Cadets played, the more de
crepit. they became. They wilted
completely in the fourth quarter,
and the game ended with West
Point rapidly losing yardage.
This Cagle person, by the
way, was most disappointing
to the 75,000 cash customers
that were lured into the Sta
dium last Saturday 1 by newfc
that the elusive' redhead was at
top form and anxious to display
his ground-gaining wares to the
Western public. A majority of
the fans paid to see Captain
Chris Cagle perform, but they
actually saw several Cards play
so well as to make Mr. Cagle
look like a dub by comparison.
At a banquet the night after the
game, Cagle said that the Cadets
had a hotter time than they had
expected. Not that he was 'refer-
ring to the weather, but the game
wasn't very minutes old before
Chris wished he was back amid
the blizzards and snowdrifts of
New York. There he would at least
have had a chance to slip on the
ice and slide down the field for a
score. For although playing on the
fastest gridiron in his long and
brilliant career, Cadet Cagle was
unable to break away even once
for a gain suitable to his reputa
tion.
One does not wish to discredit
or razz Mr. Cagle, for at times he
flashed some real playing ability.
Several times he slipped through
the line for short gains, when the
average back would have been held
at the line of scrimmage. And his
bullet pass to Hutchinson, which
scored Army's second touchdown,
was a nice piece of work.
Nevertheless, some of the
Icss-ballyhooed Cadets stole
the show for West Point. Mur
iel and Hutchinson looked good
in the Army backfield, while
Perry, McLain, and Miller stood
out in line play. Yet, as a
whole, the future generals
played like undicipliined buck

privates.
But although badly outclassed
by the Cardinals, the Cadets went
back home with the distinction of
doing to Stanford what no other
team was able to do during the last
football season. West Point scored
a touchdown on a running play!
No other team in 1929 was able to
shove over a score against the
Redshirts except by forward pass
ing.
On the other hand, the white
jerseyed backs trotted up and
down the turf all afternoon for
handsome gains. The Army ends,
who played such an outstanding
game against Notre Dame, might
as well have been sitting on the
bench, as far as stopping plays
was concerned. At the same time,
the center of the Cadet line sagged
on every buck, while at best the
tackles played in-and-out ball.
Although all of the Rerishirts
played like "super-Cagles,"
Chuck Smalling stood out as
the hero of the day. He packed
the ball as he never packed it
before, and piled up a total
gained yardage three times
that of his nearest competitor,
Mr. Cagle. Once, he broke
through the entire Army team
for a 46-yard run, shaking off
four or five would-be tacklers,
dodging the safety man like an
elusive-hipped halfback, and
was finally brought down from
behind deep in West Pointe ter
ritory. Besides, Mr. Smalling
played a whale of a defensive
game; and replaced Bob Sims
in bdwlin'g over the flashy
Cagle, just as the latter was
about to break away for cer
tain scores.
Another Redshirt that looked
like an all-American, if anyone
ever has, was Captain Mush
Muller. Muller played a better
game than both of the Army
ends together, and then some.
The other outstanding feature of
the day was the punting of Messrs.
Rotliert and Moftatt. They both
out-booted the highly heralded Mur
rel, for distance and in placing the
ball.
One performance that most
pleased was that of Perry Tay
lor. With Heinecke out of the
game on account of a bad cold,
Stanford was confronted with
a supposedly weak place at
center. However, Taylor plug
ged up the hole so well that he
looks to be a cinch to hold
down the pivot position next
fall.
All of the other players came in
for their share of the glory: Frent
rup, Fleishhacker, Hillman, Clark,
and Caglieri in the backfield, and
Tandy, Driscoll, Wilson, Bardin,
Thompson, Dawson, Klabau, Bush,
Bogue, Neill, Preston, and M. Al
bert son at line positions.
