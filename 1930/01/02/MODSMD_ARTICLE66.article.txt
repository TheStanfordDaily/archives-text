Laying the furor stirred up by
' his recently published article ques
tioning the value of the plant quar
antine method to "the agricultural
bureaucrats who are behind these
measures," G. F. Ferris, associate
professor of entomology at Stan
ford, declared last week that the
matter is no longer one of the
merits of the quarantine alone. "It
is now a question of the right of a
scientific man to express his le
gitimate views."
The trouble started recently
when Director G. 11. Hecke of the
department of agriculture attacked
Professor Ferr's for some of his
statements regarding the depart
ment of agriculture. Ferris stated
that some of the recent quarantine
policies, especially in Florida, went
too far in their efforts to root out
insect pests.
