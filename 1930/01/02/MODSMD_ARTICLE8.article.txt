# TUITION FEE IS RAISED $15 BY BOARD'S ACTION
## Modification in Carnegie Pension Grants Makes Increase Necessary Advanced Fee Not To Be Retroactive; Goes Into Effect in Fall of 1930 
### 
Ah the only means of maintain
ing its faculty retirement allow
ance program in face of the modi
fication which the Carnegie Foun
dation has been compelled to make
' in its pension grants, Stanford will
I increase its tuition to $114 a quar
! ter at the beginning of the next
college year, October 1, 1930.
This announcement was made
December 21 by Acting President
Robert E. Swain. The new tuition,
an increase of .$l5 over the present
rate, is not retroactive and will not
apply to students registered in the
University before October 1930.
The decision to raise the tuition
! fee was reached by the Stanford
Board of Trustees, Dr. Swain said,
! only after a detailed investigation
of all possibilities of meeting the
■ emergency by some other method.
Necessity Explained
"The generous provisions ot' the
Carnegie foundation a number of
years ago enabled Stanford and
j other universities which met cer
! tain requirements to initiate a com
, prehensive program of retirement
| allowances within their faculties,"
I said Doctor Swain. "Because of
i various factors which could not be
j clearly foreseen at the time, par
| ticularly the great movement to
ward higher education on the part
of the youth of the country, with
the consequent expansion in the
size of university faculties, togeth
| er with the increase in salaries fol
-1 lowing the World War period, the
! pension load on the Foundation be
j came too heavy for it to carry.
This has led necessarily to several
moves toward curtailment. The uni
versities which have been benefi
ciaries of the foundation must meet
this new situation if they are to
preserve their retirement programs
unaltered."
To Total $114
Stanford's increased tuition will
still be less than a number of other
leading endowed universities.
Prniceton chargs $450 a year; Har
vard, Yale, Cornell, Pennsylvania,
and Johns Hopkins $400, and
Columbia $360. Chicago's present
charge is the same as Stanford's —
; $300.
The new tuition will not affect
any student now in college until
1933, thus giving all students who
j register this year an opportunity
to complete their normal four-year
| course under the present tuition
i rate. After 1933 the new charge
| will be laid on all students, gradu
i ate and undergraduate, without re
gard to date of original registra
tion. This $100 does not include
the student-body fees, which
| amount to $14 a quarter.
