# CAGERS ON PAR FOR CARD-GAEL CLASH TONIGHT
## Moragans Bringing Galaxy Of Long Shot Stars To Battle Redshirt Squad Fawcett, Berg Named As Forward Combination In Starting lineup 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Playing on their home court fur
the first time this season, a veteran
Cardinal basketball team will svvinn
into action against Coach Dtfteh Con
lon's cagers from Moraga V;ll!ey this
evniing at eight o'clock in the Pavil
ion, while San Jose State will invade
the Farm tomorrow night.
Neither team has been established
as a favorite to cop tonight's annual
Card St. Mary's tilt, as to date their
respective records are on a par. Each
outfit has had an even break in their
games played over the Christmas hol
idays, Stanford 'winning twice from
Nevada and losing to Oregon State
and while the Saints divided
a pair of contests with the Oregon
squad.
Saints Tough
At all events, there should be more
than enough action to suit the cash
customers, as the Saints have a yearly
habit of giving Husky Hunt's boys a
tough hattlc. Last year's game was
no exception, and at times turned into
a hectic rough-and-tumble affair. To
night Conlon is coming down to the
Farm with four football players
scheduled to appear in his starting
lineup, and it is more than likely
that they haven't had time to forget
all of their aggressive gridiron tac
tics.
The Card five has likewise been
bolstered with three pigskin follow
ers, who stepped out of their mole
skins into gym suits immediately after
they had helped to neatly trim West
Point, though only one, Captain Ro
tliert, will start the game. However,
Phil Moffatt and Red Thompson are
old hands on tlie court and may see
action before the fray is ended.
As usual, this year's Gael quintet is
without any sort of organized team
work. Con lon's lads do not try to
advance the ball down the court and
work it in under the basket by short,
passes, hut depend on a tight defense
and long shots to win for them. The
Saints stake their chances on "toss
and pray" loops from the center of
the floor, and they are quite uncanny
in this art, when hot. Butch Simas,
of Blue Ghost fame, is the best shot
on ( onion's team, sinking them iu
from all angles of the court at times.
Pitchford and Hunt are a pair of
effective guards, and the Card for
wards arc not likely t<> get away with
many sucker shots.
Hunt announced his starting line
up last night after practice, with the
exception of the. pivot position. Douh
and Met .'and less are running neck
and-neck for the berth, and the ( ard
mentor is having a hard time deciding
which of them to send in at the tip
off. Douh, star center on last year's
frosh live, lias great potentialities and
is rapidly developing in handling the
hall, though .VI c( and less has a slight
edge in experience. Both of them will
see action before the final gun sounds.
Two vets, Fawcett and Berg, will
open at forward. Fawcett is the
most steady player on the team, both
in handling the ball and in sinking
baskets, and is the key man to the
Card offense. Berg, on the other
hand, is the fastest man on the squad,
and at times loops in shots with more
uncanny ease than Simas, To stop
whatever offense the Saints may try,
Hunt is banking on Kutbert ami
Kovvley. kuwiey is a transfer with
lots of experience., while Rothert is
a two letter man and captain of the
team in as well as again this sea
son.
Tomorrow's game with San Jose,
contrary to general opinion, will be
no set up for the Redshirts, as the
Spartans will invade the campus with
the same team that so handsomely
trounced Hunt's five in last year's
'•rason opener. The Stanford frosh
will play a preliminary to both var
sity encounters, meeting the Saint
Babes tonight ami Sacramento J.C.
tomorrow. The freshman tilts are
• cbeduled for 7:15.

exception of the. pivot position. Douh
and Met .'and less are running neck
and-neck for the berth, and the ( ard
mentor is having a hard time deciding
which of them to send in at the tip
off. Douh, star center on last year's
frosh live, lias great potentialities and
is rapidly developing in handling the
hall, though .VI c( and less has a slight
edge in experience. Both of them will
see action before the final gun sounds.
Two vets, Fawcett and Berg, will
open at forward. Fawcett is the
most steady player on the team, both
in handling the ball and in sinking
baskets, and is the key man to the
Card offense. Berg, on the other
hand, is the fastest man on the squad,
and at times loops in shots with more
uncanny ease than Simas, To stop
whatever offense the Saints may try,
Hunt is banking on Kutbert ami
Kovvley. kuwiey is a transfer with
lots of experience., while Rothert is
a two letter man and captain of the
team in as well as again this sea
son.
Tomorrow's game with San Jose,
contrary to general opinion, will be
no set up for the Redshirts, as the
Spartans will invade the campus with
the same team that so handsomely
trounced Hunt's five in last year's
'•rason opener. The Stanford frosh
will play a preliminary to both var
sity encounters, meeting the Saint
Babes tonight ami Sacramento J.C.
tomorrow. The freshman tilts are

Following arc tonight', lineups:
St. Mary's Stanford
Eliding F Fawcett
Simas F • Berg
Baird < Douh or McCandless
Pitchford C Rothert
Hunt (! Rowley
Playing on their home court fur
the first time this season, a veteran
Cardinal basketball team will svvinn
into action against Coach Dtfteh Con
lon's cagers from Moraga V;ll!ey this
evniing at eight o'clock in the Pavil
ion, while San Jose State will invade
the Farm tomorrow night.
Neither team has been established
as a favorite to cop tonight's annual
Card St. Mary's tilt, as to date their
respective records are on a par. Each
outfit has had an even break in their
games played over the Christmas hol
idays, Stanford 'winning twice from
Nevada and losing to Oregon State
and while the Saints divided
a pair of contests with the Oregon
squad.
Saints Tough
At all events, there should be more
than enough action to suit the cash
customers, as the Saints have a yearly
habit of giving Husky Hunt's boys a
tough hattlc. Last year's game was
no exception, and at times turned into
a hectic rough-and-tumble affair. To
night Conlon is coming down to the
Farm with four football players
scheduled to appear in his starting
lineup, and it is more than likely
that they haven't had time to forget
all of their aggressive gridiron tac
tics.
The Card five has likewise been
bolstered with three pigskin follow
ers, who stepped out of their mole
skins into gym suits immediately after
they had helped to neatly trim West
Point, though only one, Captain Ro
tliert, will start the game. However,
Phil Moffatt and Red Thompson are
old hands on tlie court and may see
action before the fray is ended.
As usual, this year's Gael quintet is
without any sort of organized team
work. Con lon's lads do not try to
advance the ball down the court and
work it in under the basket by short,
passes, hut depend on a tight defense
and long shots to win for them. The
Saints stake their chances on "toss
and pray" loops from the center of
the floor, and they are quite uncanny
in this art, when hot. Butch Simas,
of Blue Ghost fame, is the best shot
on ( onion's team, sinking them iu
from all angles of the court at times.

customers, as the Saints have a yearly
habit of giving Husky Hunt's boys a
tough hattlc. Last year's game was
no exception, and at times turned into
a hectic rough-and-tumble affair. To
night Conlon is coming down to the
Farm with four football players
scheduled to appear in his starting
lineup, and it is more than likely
that they haven't had time to forget
all of their aggressive gridiron tac
tics.
The Card five has likewise been
bolstered with three pigskin follow
ers, who stepped out of their mole
skins into gym suits immediately after
they had helped to neatly trim West
Point, though only one, Captain Ro
tliert, will start the game. However,
Phil Moffatt and Red Thompson are
old hands on tlie court and may see
action before the fray is ended.
As usual, this year's Gael quintet is
without any sort of organized team
work. Con lon's lads do not try to
advance the ball down the court and
work it in under the basket by short,
passes, hut depend on a tight defense
and long shots to win for them. The
Saints stake their chances on "toss
and pray" loops from the center of
the floor, and they are quite uncanny
in this art, when hot. Butch Simas,
of Blue Ghost fame, is the best shot
on ( onion's team, sinking them iu
from all angles of the court at times.
Pitchford and Hunt are a pair of
effective guards, and the Card for
wards arc not likely t<> get away with
many sucker shots.
Hunt announced his starting line
up last night after practice, with the
exception of the. pivot position. Douh
and Met .'and less are running neck
and-neck for the berth, and the ( ard
mentor is having a hard time deciding
which of them to send in at the tip
off. Douh, star center on last year's
frosh live, lias great potentialities and
is rapidly developing in handling the
hall, though .VI c( and less has a slight
edge in experience. Both of them will
see action before the final gun sounds.
Two vets, Fawcett and Berg, will
open at forward. Fawcett is the
most steady player on the team, both
in handling the ball and in sinking
baskets, and is the key man to the
Card offense. Berg, on the other
hand, is the fastest man on the squad,
and at times loops in shots with more
uncanny ease than Simas, To stop
whatever offense the Saints may try,
Hunt is banking on Kutbert ami
Kovvley. kuwiey is a transfer with
lots of experience., while Rothert is
a two letter man and captain of the
team in as well as again this sea
son.
Tomorrow's game with San Jose,
contrary to general opinion, will be
no set up for the Redshirts, as the
Spartans will invade the campus with
the same team that so handsomely
trounced Hunt's five in last year's
'•rason opener. The Stanford frosh
will play a preliminary to both var
sity encounters, meeting the Saint
Babes tonight ami Sacramento J.C.
tomorrow. The freshman tilts are
• cbeduled for 7:15.
Following arc tonight', lineups:
St. Mary's Stanford
Eliding F Fawcett
