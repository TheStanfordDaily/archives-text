## Moragans Bringing Galaxy Of Long Shot Stars To Battle Redshirt Squad Fawcett, Berg Named As Forward Combination In Starting lineup 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Playing on their home court fur
the first time this season, a veteran
Cardinal basketball team will svvinn
into action against Coach Dtfteh Con
lon's cagers from Moraga V;ll!ey this
evniing at eight o'clock in the Pavil
ion, while San Jose State will invade
the Farm tomorrow night.
Neither team has been established
as a favorite to cop tonight's annual
Card St. Mary's tilt, as to date their
respective records are on a par. Each
outfit has had an even break in their
games played over the Christmas hol
idays, Stanford 'winning twice from
Nevada and losing to Oregon State
and while the Saints divided
a pair of contests with the Oregon
squad.
Saints Tough
At all events, there should be more
than enough action to suit the cash
customers, as the Saints have a yearly
habit of giving Husky Hunt's boys a
tough hattlc. Last year's game was
no exception, and at times turned into
a hectic rough-and-tumble affair. To
night Conlon is coming down to the
Farm with four football players
scheduled to appear in his starting
lineup, and it is more than likely
that they haven't had time to forget
all of their aggressive gridiron tac
tics.
The Card five has likewise been
bolstered with three pigskin follow
ers, who stepped out of their mole
skins into gym suits immediately after
they had helped to neatly trim West
Point, though only one, Captain Ro
tliert, will start the game. However,
Phil Moffatt and Red Thompson are
old hands on tlie court and may see
action before the fray is ended.
As usual, this year's Gael quintet is
without any sort of organized team
work. Con lon's lads do not try to
advance the ball down the court and
work it in under the basket by short,
passes, hut depend on a tight defense
and long shots to win for them. The
Saints stake their chances on "toss
and pray" loops from the center of
the floor, and they are quite uncanny
in this art, when hot. Butch Simas,
of Blue Ghost fame, is the best shot
on ( onion's team, sinking them iu
from all angles of the court at times.
Pitchford and Hunt are a pair of
effective guards, and the Card for
