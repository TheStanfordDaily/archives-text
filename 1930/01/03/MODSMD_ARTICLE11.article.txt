# SECOND HAGUE MEETING MAY ASK FOR THIRD
## Trust Agreement Plan Of Young May Meet With Opposition Reparations in Eastern Europe Will Prove Troublesome 
### 
THE HAGUE, Jan. 2 (/P).—The
advance guard of the second confer
ence of the Young plan for repara
tions had scarcely arrived here today
when talk began of the necessity of
a possible third meeting to stabilize
the peace of Europe.
The normal work ahead of this
second conference has been definitely
outlined, but the proposed trust agree
ment between the central banks of
the creditor powers and the new bank
for international settlements which is
to handle collections and distributions
under the Young plan, seems destined
to meet with some critical opposi
tion.
Another question that may prove
bothersome embraces the reparations
payable by Hungary, Bulgaria, and
Austria to the "succession states"—
Rumania, Czechoslovakia, Jugoslavia,
and Greece. A subcommittee appoint
ed by the first Hague conference has
been unable to reach any unanimous
agreement regarding the reparations
obligations of Bulgaria and Hungary.
Aside from these subjects the new
conference is to adopt statutes for the
bank of international settlements and
consider reports from subcommittees
appointed last August to find methods
for liquidation of all the hangovers
of the past between Germany and the
creditor nations. The smaller credi
tors of Bulgaria and Hungary will
be asked to arrange their matters sep
arately.
But those who hold that a third
conference will be necessary argue
that this last section of the proposed
procedure will be the ultimate cause
for the later gathering. They assert
that the Little Entente powers will
not be satisfied at being left alone to
deal with Bulgaria and Hungary and
will demand the backing of a third
full session unless the larger creditors
are willing to remain here until the
recalcitrant debtors of Southwest Eu
rope arc brought to terms.
