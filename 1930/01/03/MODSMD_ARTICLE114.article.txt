# PHOTOSYNTHESIS IS SUBJECT OF STUDY BY CARNEGIE LAB
## Scientists Are Investigating Plant Life in New Building Here 
### 
Contributions which the Carnegie
Institution's Division of Plant Biol
ogy hopes to make to the understand
ing: of life are now centered in the
$75,000 laboratory which was erected
011 Stanford land and dedicated at
impressive ceremonies last August.
Under the direction of Dr. H. A.
Spoehr, chairman of the division, a
stafT of five Carnegie Institute scien
tists are here studying problems of
plant life and co-ordinating the work
of the institution's live Western sta
tions—those at Tucson, Carinel, Santa
Barbara, Manitou (Colorado), and
Stanford.
The big two-story concrete struc
ture with its auxiliary buildings
looms up on the Mayfield-Searsville
road, southwest of the (Jttad.
Its five-acre site was leased from
the University with the understanding
that further territory could he ac
quired if necessary. Beyond this, the
laboratory's only connection with the
University is through the friendly co
operation of scientists working along
allied lines.
To it can he brought from the other
Western units such problems as need
the laboratory equipment and library
facilities provided here. The plant in
cludes, in addition to the main build
ing, a glass house, a structure for the
isolation of materials involving in
flammable solvents, extensive gardens,
and a transplant house for the use of
Dr. H. M. Hall, a member of the
staff whose work in taxonomy and re
lationships requires the study of the
same plant under various ecological
conditions.
Photosynthesis, or the plant's meth
od of making food out of solar en
ergy. is the major problem under con
sideration here. Working with Dr.
Spoehr are Dr. Hall, Dr. J. 11. C.
Smith, Dr. Harold H. Strain, David
D. Keck, and Harold W. Miller. Dr.
Smith has concentrated on the study
of the chemical composition of cell
constituents which play a part in this
quantities of carotin—which science
believes may be Vitamin I)—to make
possible its physical and chemical
analysis. 1t this substance proves,
indeed, to he the fourth vitamin, sci
ence will know more of its l compo
sition through Dr. Smith's investiga
tions than it knows of any other
discovered vitamin.
