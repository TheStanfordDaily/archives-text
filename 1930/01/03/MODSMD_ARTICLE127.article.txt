WASHINGTON, Jan. 2. (/P)â€”Sec
retary Stimson said today that a
study of the recent Chinese proela
mation 011 extraterritoriality
showed that government to be in
accord with the American position
011 abolition of these rights.
Reports from China that the ac
tion of the Nanking government
was taken to end all extraterri
torial rights 011 January 1, Mr.
Stimson said, were not borne out
by the text of proclamation which
lie interpreted to mean that the
Chinese wished January 1 to be the
starting point for gradual elimina
tion of the extraterritorial rights
of the foreign powers. This, lie
said, was exactly in keeping with
the conversations which have been
conducted in Washington between
the State Department and Minister
of China.
