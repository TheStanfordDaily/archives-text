# LIQUOR LEAKS FACED BY DRY COMMISSIONS
## Hoover s Law Enforcement Committee Not to Pass On 18th Amendment Permit System Denounced By Borah as "Scandal"; To Conduct Inquiry 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C, Jan. 2 (/P).
— Industrial alcohol leaks are regard
ed by President Hoover's law en
forcement commission and congres
sional dry leaders as prohibition's
must difficult problem.
Out of the whirl of holiday dis
cussion and controversy among the
drys this fact has been agreed upon
by all factions. The law enforcement
commission has set itself to inquiring
into the situation but the preliminary
report of the commission to Congress
will not touch upon it.
Termed a "Scandal"
Described by Senator Borah of
Idaho as a "scandal," the administra
tion of the permit system whereby
industrial alcohol is distributed to
business is due for a thorough inves
tigation and already rumors of grave
disclosures in this inquiry have been
heard.
Administration of the industrial al
cohol permits comes under the Treas
ury Department and more particu
larly under Assistant Secretary Low
man and Prohibition Director Doran.
In his reorganization of the prohibi
tion enforcement machinery, Mr.
Hoover has proposed to continue this
phase of prohibition in the Treasury.
To Finish July 1
Assurance was given by Senator
Jones that the law enforcement com
mission would complete its study of
prohibition before July 1 and that
the commission has agreed unani
mously not to pass judgment upon the
"wisdom or unwisdom" of the Eight
eenth Amendment itself.
The Washington observers divided
the commission's work into two
phases—prohibition enforcement and
law enforcement — generally "with
several problems in each phase."
