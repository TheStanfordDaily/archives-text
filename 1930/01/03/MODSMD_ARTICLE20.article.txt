LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2 (/P). â€”
Governor Fred Balzar of Nevada,
who came here yesterday to attend
the annual Tournament of Roses at
Pasadena, said today that lie believed
a settlement of tlie tri-state dispute
over the Boulder Canyon Dam would
lie reached at the forthcoming con
ference, tentatively set at Phoenix,
Arizona.
The governor said Nevada would
ask for one-third of the power gener
ated at the dam instead of all power
as was proposed originally. He said,
however, that Nevada was not at
odds with the other two states, Cali
fornia and Arizona, over the division
of water.
