# ROTH TALKS ON STUDENT INFLUENCES
## Stresses Importance Of Public Contact For Universities 
### 
i Importance of goodwill between
universities and the public was
stressed yesterday morning by Almon
E. Roth, University comptroller, in a
speech delivered before 175 delegates
to the Fifth Annual Congress of the
National Students' Federation of
America.
"We arc in an era of goodwill,"
Roth declared. "Great corporations
are spending millions to create it.
Hoover's trip to South America is an
example of national goodwill. A uni
versity needs goodwill, for its gradu
ates must compete in a highly com
petitive market."
"As 90 per cent of a university's
graduates go forth to earn a liveli
hood, the goodwill of the public to
ward a university is most important."
In his speech Roth stressed six
points whereby a student body has a
direct contact with the public. "Good
will may or may not be developed at
these points," Roth said. "Many of
them seem insignificant, but arc really
of major importance."
Roth's proposed contact points
are:
1. Friendliness of student body
toward visitors.
2. Impressions made by teams.
3. Merit of campus publica
tions.
4. Radio and motion picture in
fluences.
5. Respect for university prop
erty.
6. Type of dress displayed on
campus.
"Friendly attitudes toward visitors
make lasting impressions. Stanford's
Hello tradition is an example of this.
A well-regulated campus guide serv
ice is also an important contact
point."
Roth said that the public notes the
manner in which a team participates
I iii athletic contests. He cited a New
! York newspaper article which said
j that "a certain track team" displayed
1 such excellent sportsmanship and gen
| tlcmanly conduct that it should have
I been sent east even if it didn't score
! a single point.
Sensationalism Hit
In dealing with the subject of pub
lications, Ruth urged that colored
I news and sensationalism be barred
j from campus newspapers and maga
zines.
"Is your campus tlaily constructive
or merely cynical?" the speaker
asked. "Constructive criticism is al
ways useful. It's bad business to de
ride your own university." In urging
that publications keep their pages
clean, Roth said that the public gets
a wrong conception of a university if
its publications continually print olT
color jokes.
Radio Control Needed
Comptroller Roth also advocated a
strict control of radio broadcasting of
university functions in order that a
favorable impression of university
life might be given tlie public. For
the same reason, he pointed out,
"moving pictures are not allowed to
be taken of the Stanford campus in
order that the University may not be
used as a background for the type
of college motion pictures now being
| produced."
"The last Big (iatne rally was most
| successful," Rotb said, "but a cer
| tain alumnus most decidedly did not
j use discretion or common sense in
some of the things he said. What
] sounds good at a football rally doesn't
j always sound so well when it echoes
j through the parlors of American
I homes."
Rcspect for Property
j "The public notices students' re-
I sped for University property," Roth
I said. "Students, in general, respect
| their university's property."
"A San Francisco business man re
cently remarked that the untidy
.dressing of students here left an un-
I favorable impression upon him. We
j should regard cleanliness as para
j mount in importance."

National Students' Federation of
America.
"We arc in an era of goodwill,"
Roth declared. "Great corporations
are spending millions to create it.
Hoover's trip to South America is an
example of national goodwill. A uni
versity needs goodwill, for its gradu
ates must compete in a highly com
petitive market."
"As 90 per cent of a university's
graduates go forth to earn a liveli
hood, the goodwill of the public to
ward a university is most important."
In his speech Roth stressed six
points whereby a student body has a
direct contact with the public. "Good
will may or may not be developed at
these points," Roth said. "Many of
them seem insignificant, but arc really
of major importance."
Roth's proposed contact points
are:
1. Friendliness of student body
toward visitors.
2. Impressions made by teams.
3. Merit of campus publica
tions.
4. Radio and motion picture in
fluences.
5. Respect for university prop
erty.
6. Type of dress displayed on
campus.
"Friendly attitudes toward visitors
make lasting impressions. Stanford's
Hello tradition is an example of this.
A well-regulated campus guide serv
ice is also an important contact
point."
Roth said that the public notes the
manner in which a team participates
I iii athletic contests. He cited a New
! York newspaper article which said
j that "a certain track team" displayed
1 such excellent sportsmanship and gen
| tlcmanly conduct that it should have
I been sent east even if it didn't score
! a single point.
Sensationalism Hit
In dealing with the subject of pub
lications, Ruth urged that colored
I news and sensationalism be barred
j from campus newspapers and maga
zines.
"Is your campus tlaily constructive
or merely cynical?" the speaker
asked. "Constructive criticism is al
ways useful. It's bad business to de
ride your own university." In urging
that publications keep their pages
clean, Roth said that the public gets
a wrong conception of a university if
its publications continually print olT
color jokes.
Radio Control Needed
Comptroller Roth also advocated a
strict control of radio broadcasting of
university functions in order that a
favorable impression of university
life might be given tlie public. For
the same reason, he pointed out,
"moving pictures are not allowed to
be taken of the Stanford campus in
order that the University may not be
used as a background for the type
of college motion pictures now being
| produced."
"The last Big (iatne rally was most
| successful," Rotb said, "but a cer
| tain alumnus most decidedly did not
j use discretion or common sense in
some of the things he said. What
] sounds good at a football rally doesn't
j always sound so well when it echoes
j through the parlors of American
I homes."
Rcspect for Property
j "The public notices students' re-
I sped for University property," Roth
I said. "Students, in general, respect
| their university's property."
"A San Francisco business man re
cently remarked that the untidy
.dressing of students here left an un-
I favorable impression upon him. We
j should regard cleanliness as para
j mount in importance."
