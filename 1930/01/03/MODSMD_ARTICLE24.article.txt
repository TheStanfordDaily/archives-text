# ROTH TALKS ON STUDENT INFLUENCES
## Stresses Importance Of Public Contact For Universities 
### 
i Importance of goodwill between
universities and the public was
stressed yesterday morning by Almon
E. Roth, University comptroller, in a
speech delivered before 175 delegates
to the Fifth Annual Congress of the
National Students' Federation of
America.
"We arc in an era of goodwill,"
Roth declared. "Great corporations
are spending millions to create it.
Hoover's trip to South America is an
example of national goodwill. A uni
versity needs goodwill, for its gradu
ates must compete in a highly com
petitive market."
"As 90 per cent of a university's
graduates go forth to earn a liveli
hood, the goodwill of the public to
ward a university is most important."
In his speech Roth stressed six
points whereby a student body has a
direct contact with the public. "Good
will may or may not be developed at
these points," Roth said. "Many of
them seem insignificant, but arc really
of major importance."
Roth's proposed contact points
are:
1. Friendliness of student body
toward visitors.
2. Impressions made by teams.
3. Merit of campus publica
tions.
4. Radio and motion picture in
fluences.
5. Respect for university prop
erty.
6. Type of dress displayed on
campus.
"Friendly attitudes toward visitors
make lasting impressions. Stanford's
Hello tradition is an example of this.
A well-regulated campus guide serv
ice is also an important contact
point."
Roth said that the public notes the
manner in which a team participates
