### LEONARD BARTLETT 
MAJOR problems confronting American colleges underwent the micro
scopic probe of more tlian 175 campus leaders here yesterday when
the Fifth Annual Congress of (he National Students Federation of
America swung into its first important day of business.
Goodwill between universities and the public was stressed yesterday
morning by Alrnon E. Roth, University comptroller, in a speech before
the first plenary session of the Congress.
Ursel C. Narver of Oregon State presided at the Initial plenary
gathering of the delegates. Following roll call, John Van Amridge,
general chairman of the Congress, outlined yesterday's schedule of

• activities'to the delegates. Reports
were given by six standing com
mittees. •
N.S.F.A. delegates were guests
of honor at a special buffet lunch
eon held at noon in the Theta Xi
House.
Campus Tour
After luncheon a large number
of the guests went on a tour of the
Quad and the Memorial Church.
The tour was directed by Calvin
Flint, campus guide. An organ ra
cital in the Memorial Church was
presented by Warren 1). Allen.
National conferences for all dele
gates were in progress in the Wo
men's Clubhouse during the after
noon. Student government was the
topic for discussion.
That freshman hazing has gone
♦he way of peg-top trousers and
tandem bicycles in most of the col
leges of (lie nation was one of the
developments of (he discussion in
(he group lead by Ed Murrow ot
Washington State College.
Considerable friction was evi
denced in the attitudes of repre
sentatives of eastern and southern
colleges toward faculty interven
tion and regulation of student af
fairs. In many of the colleges, the
j faculties assume dictatorial con
i trol of student activities. Discus
j sion at this point centered around
| a system of co-operation between
j students and faculties.
N. Y. U. Problem
i A peculiar problem presented at
j the meeting was that of New York
i University which consists of three
i separate colleges—all under the
j same student administration. Ap
j portionment of funds and alloca
j tion of representation caused diffi
i culties.
j Much time was devoted to the
I discussion of the managerial sys
j tem in extra-curricular activities.
On (he Pacific Coast, managerial
duties are fixed in the hands of a
graduate manager, while in the
East, the students are managers,
if was reported. Graduate man
agers are directly under student
control, but the faculties take an
active part in supervision of the
student-managed activities.
In another group of the afternoon
session, women's student govern
ment was discussed from many
vantages, with particular stress
being devoted to the relationship
between faculty and students. Cor
nelia Anderson of Vassar led the
women's discussion group.
Executive Bodies
It was found that many colleger
have two women's governing
bodies: a small body of executives
who formulate laws presented to t
larger body including presidents o!
various clubs and classes for flu
approval before presentation to the
general student body. In general,
the small executive body co-oper
ates with the dean of women.
Several schools expressed inter
est in the sponsor and big sistei
methods for social orientation o:
freshman women.
Dinner for the delegates wan
served liist night in Emilia Colli
mons.
Regional meetings were held Inst
night in the Women's Clubhouse,
Delegates from various sections ot
the country met in different groups
to discuss mutual problems.
Urge West Participation
The Far Western delegates 1111
der the leadership of Edward Mm
row of Washington State College
were urged to sign up for the five
standing committees on foreign re
lations and travel, student govern
menl. organization and finance, in
ternational education and curriCu
lum.
Fourteen delegates were present
at the New York. New England re
gional meeting called to order by
Paul Friedman of New York.
In a brief introductory speech,
Friedman emphasized the need foi
permanent interest on the part ol
the delegates in the work of tlie
federation rather tlvn a burst ol
temporary enthusiasm aroused ;it
the convention.
Delegates Appointed
Delegates were appointed to vari
ous standing committees on stu
dent problems to meet today. Dis
cussion at this group centered on
the desirability ol' holding a region
al (.'(inference.sometime in.the au
tumn of 1936 to precede the tia
tional Congress. Much of the rou
tine organisation of the Congress
could be eliminated by such >1 re
gional meeting, the delegates .be
lieve.

a regional representative from
their section, the East Central
group discussed the duties and re
quirements of a representative

man.

Too Much Rah-Rah Spirit
Too much rah-rah college boy
spirit is emphasized in the N.S.F.A.
advertising and literature, accord
ing to delegates from the Middle
Atlantic colleges who met in their
sectional group last night under
the chairmanship of Margaret Mar
tin of Bryn Mawr.
N.S.F.A. proceedings and com
munications should be simple, busi
ness-like and thorough was the
opinion expressed by men and wo
men representatives from the Mid
dle Atlantic section.
Smaller intercollegiate student
organization ought to be disbanded
to give exclusive authority and
support to the N.S.F.A., several ol
tiie delegates believed. Associate
membership for smaller schools

was suggested. Under such a sys
tem small colleges could affotd
membership because they would
not be obligated to spend money
to send delegates to the national
conventions, but could participate
in sectional conventions.

A meet in/; was held by the West
Central group. Discussion of the
various standing committees was
carried on. Members of the group
were urged to actively engage in
various committee work.

proposal (hat the I'll 111 N.S.F.A. con
vention be held in Atlanta, Georgia,

sor the nomination of (J. Hawkins
Golden of Southern Methodist Uni
versity as national president.

Lee University presided at the
