### LEONARD BARTLETT 
MAJOR problems confronting American colleges underwent the micro
scopic probe of more tlian 175 campus leaders here yesterday when
the Fifth Annual Congress of (he National Students Federation of
America swung into its first important day of business.
Goodwill between universities and the public was stressed yesterday
morning by Alrnon E. Roth, University comptroller, in a speech before
the first plenary session of the Congress.
Ursel C. Narver of Oregon State presided at the Initial plenary
gathering of the delegates. Following roll call, John Van Amridge,
general chairman of the Congress, outlined yesterday's schedule of

• activities'to the delegates. Reports
were given by six standing com
mittees. •
N.S.F.A. delegates were guests
of honor at a special buffet lunch
eon held at noon in the Theta Xi
House.
Campus Tour
After luncheon a large number
of the guests went on a tour of the
Quad and the Memorial Church.
The tour was directed by Calvin
Flint, campus guide. An organ ra
cital in the Memorial Church was
presented by Warren 1). Allen.
National conferences for all dele
gates were in progress in the Wo
men's Clubhouse during the after
noon. Student government was the
topic for discussion.
That freshman hazing has gone
♦he way of peg-top trousers and
tandem bicycles in most of the col
leges of (lie nation was one of the
developments of (he discussion in
(he group lead by Ed Murrow ot
Washington State College.
Considerable friction was evi
denced in the attitudes of repre
sentatives of eastern and southern
colleges toward faculty interven
tion and regulation of student af
fairs. In many of the colleges, the
j faculties assume dictatorial con

j sion at this point centered around
| a system of co-operation between
j students and faculties.
N. Y. U. Problem
i A peculiar problem presented at
j the meeting was that of New York
i University which consists of three
i separate colleges—all under the
j same student administration. Ap
j portionment of funds and alloca
j tion of representation caused diffi
i culties.
j Much time was devoted to the
I discussion of the managerial sys
j tem in extra-curricular activities.
On (he Pacific Coast, managerial
duties are fixed in the hands of a
graduate manager, while in the
East, the students are managers,
if was reported. Graduate man
agers are directly under student
control, but the faculties take an
active part in supervision of the
student-managed activities.
In another group of the afternoon
session, women's student govern
ment was discussed from many
vantages, with particular stress
being devoted to the relationship
between faculty and students. Cor
nelia Anderson of Vassar led the
women's discussion group.
Executive Bodies
It was found that many colleger
have two women's governing
bodies: a small body of executives
who formulate laws presented to t
larger body including presidents o!
various clubs and classes for flu
approval before presentation to the
general student body. In general,
the small executive body co-oper
ates with the dean of women.
Several schools expressed inter

methods for social orientation o:
