# BRIDGE-PLAYING FOOLS
## 
### 
The venerable Robert Emmons Rogers, professor at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, told a group of 800 Boston stu
dents that playing bridge is the "lowest depth to which a human can
fall." llc attacked the pastime as valueless and a thief of hours that
could he spent in a tremendously more profitable way.
The thought has often occurred to us that if the average college
student could sit down before a textbook and deal with its contents
as intelligently as he handles a deck of cards he wouldn't have much
trouble making Phi Beta Kappa. Although Professor Rogers ap
parently exaggerates, there is still some truth in what he says. He
also told those same 800 people that if they wanted to succeed after
leaving college the\ would have to become very snobbish. â€”Daily I
