THE WAY OF fcCBEN, by J.,met;
Branch Cabell. (Hubert M. Mc-
Bi ide & Co., Publirhei >j. New
York. 1929.)
"The Way ol' lOcben" is an all ■
gory which tells of how, in a
I dream, "Kttarre the wltrli woman
l . . . . ])iil a memory and a desire
| and a summoning u|)om Kuik Alt'
i gar in the hour ol' his triumph. ' At
I the end of the quest, lor which
i Alfgar renounced Ins throne and
1 suffered count h s •• tori ur< in hi
; travels, ago has robheil him ol' the
! power to see beauty in the face <.I
: Kttare. But, he maintains, "my
dream was noble; and il » nobility
| contents me."
In all of the works of James
j Branch Cabell is to be found a
shadowy, sail beauty of aspiration
' beyond hope, of visions which must
j disappoint. In this story of
| the dulled senses of the ugnil and
i of their dimming perception of Hie
| ideal, there appears an increased
i proportion of exqui ite melam'holy,
j viewed, as ever, behind a lightly
! derisive mask.
! The last portion of the book,
! treating ol the fact that an authoi
i has, at fifty, nothing new to offer
' to the world, is als.o concerned with
I that generation of authors wlii h
j has dominati I American literature
during the post-war peri tel. ("abell
, is, as he remarks, himself a writer

I of this period. Of the group he
says, 'Ml was. pre-eminently, the
gem ration which destroyed taboos"
hut it "nowadays evinces a quite
distressing' tendency to preserve at
all costs tin* post lire of Ajax defy
ing' the lightnings under an un
clouded sky." Froth his part in this
generation's revolt against conven
tion, Cabell has gained in wit,
though he has lost, somewhat, in
| beauty.
The ilnal chapters of this book
leave the friends and, for that mat
ter, ilii- i.f Mr, Caholl with the
quest ion of whether or not he is
'finished with willing. Few authors
of note sin e the period of the
Ite.slonition have uelibei'ufely cut
I short their literary lives before
' they were silenced by disease or
; death.
At any rate, the Biography of
Dun Manuel and his descendants
is completed. Those who feel that
its Irioloy.y of Poietesme," its pro-
I togue and epilogue, and other vol
; nines ol no Jess beauty are works
I of t eiiiu: , must he saddened that
there will l»n no more.
But, now that his ideal is dis
i appearing and becoming blurred
| by time instead of growing daily
more bright, Cabell has, perhaps,
i chosen wisely to join with his
I "maimed and .discontented poets"
in the parting gesture, "llail and
j farewell, Et,tarre!" —E. E. W.
