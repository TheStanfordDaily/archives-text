BOSTON, Jan. 2 (JP). â€” Coast
Guard recruiting posters on Boston
Common were torn down and de
stroyed today shortly after a meeting
in Faneuil Hall, in protest of the kill
ing of three rum runners off New
port, R. 1., Sunday by coast guards
men, was concluded. The petty offi
cer in charge of the recruiting sta
tion was unable to cope with the dem
onstrators.
