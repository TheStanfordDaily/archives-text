TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT
It appears that Mrs. Jones' boy,
oward, who does a very good job
cofcching Southern California's
otball teams, has yet to learn not
speak his innermost thoughts in
e presence of newspapermen, as
evinced by a news service article
hlch ran in several coast papers
i file Coast some days ago.
After California had upset
the Trojan applecart last No
vember, it will be remembered
that Jones drew considerable
unfavorable comment for pub
licly criticizing one of his ends
who bad been guilty of a grid
iron faux pas that helped ma
terially in allowing the Bears
to score a touchdown. One
southern paper carried a ver
batim report of Jones' "bawl
out," which was considered
manifestly unfair to the player
in .question. The Trojan mentor
defended himself by declaring
that he thought the sports
writer who heard the dressing
down would consider it as con
fidential, and in that Jones was
mistaken.
However, if the recent article is
noting him correctly, Jones can
ardly be credited with an over--
bundance of tact. According to (he
ory, Howard was quite wroth
ver Hie fact that Pop Warner and
iny Tho'rnhill were on hand to
reet Jock Sutherland and his Pitt
anthers, when they arrived at
asadena this week to play the
rojitns. Inasmuch as Sutherland
layed under Warner when Pop
as coaching Pittsburgh, there
as nothing for Jones to get ex
ited about, yet he branded the
esture as "unsportsmanlike" and
ccused Warner of giving the Pitt
aacli information about (lie Tro
ms.
Inasmuch as scouting is a recog
ized element in football, Jones is
ardly justified in becoming
rough! up if Warner did vouch
afe his former pupil any informa
on anent U.S.C., which is debat
ble. It is no secret , that Hill
paulding, U.C.L.A. coach, scouted
ie Trojans for Knut.e Kockne
hen the Notre Dame eleven came
'est to play U.S.C. last year, and
tie Bruins were on the Trojan
chedule.
But to climax his cataclysmic
statement, Jones was guilty of
something that would make a
schoolboy blush. "Wait until I
meet Warner on the football
field next year. I'll give him
something to think about," was
the trend of his closing re
mark. That certainly is very .
fine, Mr. Jones. You might also
something from Emily
Po6t.
In, an adjoining column on this ■
age is printed the Stanford foot- I
•all"schedule for 1930.-t It carries
11 intcraectional flavor, with Min
esota carded for an October game
t Minneapolis, and Dartmouth
oming here the Saturday t'ollow
ng the Big Game, but the pres
nce of California Tech on the !
chedule gives rise to the question,
How come?"
Pasadena school is a splen- j
id institution of learning, but the :
ixe of its student body and the |
onditions under which its football
earns must practice preclude any
ha'uce of its turning out high-class '
rid teams, and a Starford-Cal
'eeh game can hardly be called
11 attraction.
Last season, with California play
ng U.S.C. at Los Angeles, and no
aajor game held in San Francisco j
n that day, Cal Tech played Stan
ord here. An opponent without the i
Engineers' manifest lack of
trength would have drawn a very j
izeable crowd. As it was, some
500 people, most of them huddled
round the pivss-box, where they
istened to a radio broadcast of
he Bear-Trojan fray, watched as
istless an encounter as it has been
>ur misfortune to witness.
Stanford is perhaps right in tak
ng no chances the week before
he Big Game, but an adversary
the caliber of St. Ignatius, an
ip-and-coming college with a large
iay district following, would look 1
great deal better than several
'al Techs. —Dick Friendlich.
