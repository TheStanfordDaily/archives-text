# Dartmouth, Minnesota On 1930 Card Grid Sked
## FIVE CONFERENCE GAMES ARRANGED FOR WARNERMEN West Coast Army Lifts Football Lid Here On Sept. 20 
### S. D 
With Dartmouth scheduled as the
j climaxing spectacle, Coach Pop War
| ner's football varsity will face its
i toughest and, at the same time, most
j brilliant season next fall. Never be
-1 fore lias a Stanford team lined up
J such a variety of outstanding gridiron
I opponents.
i The playing of certain sophomores
j and juniors in the Cal and Army
games, coupled with the *vork of a
j number of Grays and freshmen, in"
j the season just closed, indicates that
the Cards will have an eleven of
championship calibcr when the pig
| skins start thudding around the Sta
; diuni again next September. Which
j is a good thing, to say the least, as
I many a potentially strong team has
I wilted under a much less imposing
[ schedule than the Redshirts will un
dergo in 1930.
P.C.C. Meeting
Most of the eleven contests were
arranged for at the meeting of the
j Pacific Coast Conference, held in San
Francisco during the first part of Dc
j cember. A home and home agree
ment with Minnesota had previously
: been closed, and during the Christ
mas holidays the Stanford officials
lined up a "breather" with Cal Tech.
! At the close of the Conference meet
W. B. Owens, of Stanford, was rc
! elected president, while Al Masters of
: the B.A.C. was named on a conunit
j tee to see if a better method of choos
ing the Coast champion teams could
be worked out.
Once again the Cardinal s'qilad is
scheduled to open its season against
the West Coast Army. Although the
soldiers will put up a stiff resistance,
Stanford should have no trouble in
knocking them over. Last fall the
Army invaded the Farm with a re- 1
puted strong outfit, but were satis- j
fieri to return home to their barracks :
on the short end of a 45 to 0 score.
Then follow two annual battles, the ;
yearly encounter with the Olympic!
C lul) of San Francisco and the more
or less "grudge" game with Santa !
Clara. The ( lub eleven, composed of \
former college grid stars, is always i
dangerous, while next fall the Cards !
will be out to avenge the 13 to F up-;
set administered by Santa Clara one j
line sunny day last November.
First High Light
On the following week-end comes ■
the first high light of the schedule,
a game with Minnesota at Minneapo
lis. The Redshirts will be hard
pressed to cop this first game of a !
home and home series, as the game '
is sandwiched in between two tough
games, one with Santa Clara and the
other with Oregon State. Minnesota
always has a first-class team and
ranks well up with the Big Ten lead
ers. Doc Spears, coach of the Mid-
West team, scouted the recent West
Point rout, and was more than im
pressed with the power of Pop's lads. J
After the Oregon State game |
comes the annual Trojan clash. The j
game will he played in the Stanford i
Stadium, and as yet the Cards have j
failed to down the men from Troy '
on their home grounds. Next year !
may prove the exception, though j
Coach Howard Jones claims that he |
will have a team even better than that I
turned out at Southern Cal during |
the past season.
Huskies Weakened
The Washington tilt conies two 1
weeks later, the Huskies invading the !
I'arm at that time. Washington has
acquired a new coach for the coming ;
season, Phelan of Purdue, and is not j
likely to be any stronger than Bag- J
shaw s team of 1 920. However, the j
Huskies always play their best game 1
of the yeftr against the Cards.
On the 22nd of November, Pop will
gather his boys around him and trek j
up to Berkeley to give the fans around I
the bay a new version of "the taming ■
of the Golden Bear." Price will be a |
miracle man if lie can turn out a for- J
midable team next fall, as the remains I
of his last one arc very slim indeed, j
Stanford should take the Bears into I
camp again—but then you can never 1
tell about a Big (iame.
Dartmouth comes west the follow- j
ing Saturday, in a game which is
also the first of a home and home
series. The Big Green elevens are
always among the best in the far ,
hast, and according to the critics next r
lall s outfit will be no exception.
Dartmouth will be somewhat weak
ened by the loss of Hal Boons, all-
Anicricau end for 1929, but there- j
niainder of the team returns almost j
intact. Ihe Big Green squad replaces j
Army as the blue ribbon event «>f the j
season, and, at the same time, is quite \
likely to give the Cards a much more }
hectic struggle.
