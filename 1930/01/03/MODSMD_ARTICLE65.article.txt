# BOXING SEASON TO START SOON WITH UNIVERSITY BOUTS
## 
### 
Stanford's boxing season will
lose no time in getting under way,
Coach Harry Maloney announced
last night, and plans for holding
the finals of the annual All-Univer
sity Tournament in the Pavilion
on January 30, with preliminary
bouts to be staged on January 28
and 20, are being discussed.
The All-University boxing tour
nament is open to all registered
students, and the selection of the
varsity squad is largely governed
by the outcome of this tourney. All
who intend to participate are urged
to begin training at once, and entry
lists for the matches will be posted
in the boxing gallery shortly.
During the Christmas holidays,
six punching bag stands have been
installed beneath the bleachers
around the swimming pools. These
stands, a needed improvement, are
of varying heights and will permit
the various weightmen to use the
equipment to the greatest advan
tage.
