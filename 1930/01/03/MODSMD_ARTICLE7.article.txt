DETROIT, Mich., Jan. 2. f/P) â€”
After a reception marred by a hos
tile demonstration on the part of
200 or more men and women who
mingled with a friendly crowd at
the railroad station, Pascual Ortiz
Rubin, president-elect of Mexico,
today was scheduled to receive the
official greetings of the City of
Detroit.
The president-elect appeared un
perturbed by the unfriendly atti
tude of the noisy group which was
outnumbered ten to one by those
who cheered as he left his train
at the Michigan Central station
last night. The hostile crowd was
said by police to have been com
posed principally by local commun
ists.
