## 
### 
Speedy transportation over the
skyways of California solved a
problem for Leo Adams, president
of the Southern California student
body and delegate to the N.S.F.A.
convention now in progress on the
campus.
Adams, who desired to witness
the S.C.-Pittsburgh grid clash and
yet be on the campus Wednesday
night, resorted to air transporta
tion. lie hopped out of a plane late
Wednesday evening and was at
Stanford on time to prepare the
agenda for a discussion group
which he will lead.
