# Golf Opening Day Fails To See Any Par Scores
## 
### 
As yet no one has completed the
new University golf course par.
The best scores of the opening day,
yesterday, were turned in by Louis
Duino, San Jose golf critic, and Ed
Crowley, former Stanford star,
both of whom went around in 70,
par being 71.
More than 125 golfers were out
yesterday testing the new links.
