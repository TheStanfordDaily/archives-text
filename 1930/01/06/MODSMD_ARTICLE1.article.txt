## Rothert, Rowley Star as St. Mary's Trounced by 31 -23 Score in Opener McCandless Leads Attack Against State With '20 Points; Play Is Slow 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Displaying flashes of improve
ment over its playing during the
Christmas holidays, and showing
real form at times, Coach Husky
Hunt's basketball five opened its
home season on Friday and Satur
day by taking both ends of a dou
ble-header, downing St. Mary's 31
to 23 and running away from San
Jose State by a score of 4!) to 14.
Stiff Workouts
Although Stanford was not hard
pressed to win either tilt, Hunt
was not entirely pleased with the
showing of his charges, and is
planning to put them through a
stiff workout this afternoon to iron
out a few of the rough spots, both
in offense and defense, in prepara
tion for the College of Pacific game
tomorrow night.
In both games, the Cards' main
weakness seemed to be in advanc
ing the ball down the court. In
stead of breaking fast, they in
variably allowed their opponents to
get set with a five-man defense be
lore trying to work the ball in lor
a (dose shot. This was especially
true at the tip-off, Stanford nearly
always getting the jump at center,
1 ut failing to make use of the ad
vantage. The Uedshirts either lost
the ball, or let the other quintet
form its defense.
Vet, the work of certain indi
viduals was outstanding, and as a
whole the two victories indicate
that Stanford has more than medi
ocre possibilities for the Confer
ence Championship this winter.
Rowley and Captain Rothert both
looked good at guard positions,
while McCandless, Faweett, and
Berg were especially effective in
looping baskets.
Saint TiIt Ragged
Heralded as a rough and tumble
affair, I lie annual St. Mary's game
proved to be a more or less ragged
( on I est, neither team having much
in the way of teamwork or smooth
tunning plays. Before the game
ended, four players had been eject
ed on personal fouls. Doub, Rowley,
and Itothert for Stanford, and Hunt
oi St. Mary's.
The first, half was nip and tuck,
the lead see-sawing hack and forth
by one or two points. At half time,
Stanford managed to forge out
in the lead by a five-point margin.
The Saints, on sucker shots by
Haird and Eliding, tied the count
early in the second period, before
the Kedshirt offense got function
ing again. Late in the game, Stan
ford began to speed up a bit, and
from then on the Moraga team was
never in the running.
Depending on long shots by
Simas, the Saint, outfit never
seemed to be able to get going.
Simas, noted for his ability to toss
them in from all angles of the
court with his eyes closed, was able
to tind the bucket for only three
ringers, though tying with Rowley
for high-point honors of the game
with eight tallies.
