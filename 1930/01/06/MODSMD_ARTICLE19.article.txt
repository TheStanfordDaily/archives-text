"The strength o" a great country l

together all of the favorable forces I
in every part of it," said Dr. Wil
tur. "Out of this picture must
come the essential strength of the |
future America.

to receive recommendation.
"It is most fortunate that in our !

thing of a world understanding.'
'! he world now has such a chance
as never before to replace battles
with conferences and to save na
tion:; from those periodic destruc
, tions of life and property which
have held back the progress of
civilization. Upon the young men
and women which you represent
here today will come a large re
: jion: ibility for the development, of
this new attitude in this country,
now the most powerful 011 earth,
and the encouragement of it in
other countries.
"I congratulate you upon the op
portunity ottered here of good l'cl- j
lowship and acquaintance. I trust \
that you will deal conscientiously
with the problems in front, of you,

how (hey should behave, you may
linrl that you have missed the real
opportunity of making your feder
ation a continuous cause for good." 1
