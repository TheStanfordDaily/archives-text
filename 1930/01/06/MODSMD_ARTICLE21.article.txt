# SORORITY STRINGS AND WOMEN PUPPETS
## 
### 
On Wednesday Stanford begins its annual puppet show.
From then until January 20, the day of sorority pledging, fresh
man women will play the part of puppets for the campus, the
strings being pulled by the sororities, interested men, women living
in Roble, and alumnae. The theme of the puppet show is not one
of co-operation but that of a tug-of-war, and the puppets, unaware
of what is going on behind the scenes, are often badly mangled.
Though Stanford's rules for the direction of the show are far
ahead of those of many schools, still a great deal can be done to
improve this Punch and Judy performance. A kind of mystical
"rating" of doubtful worth usually decides the action of the
puppets, who have to depend upon the "rating" given them by
women in the hall, men, and some sorority women since they know
practically nothing about the sororities, either as they are on this
campus or nationally. These "ratings" differ tremendously be
tween individuals, and are based upon tradition and the idea an
individual has of a certain house from the members whom he
knows.
New women are thus left with misleading ratings, thinking that
the happiness of their entire college life depends upon the proper
selection of living group, and instead of thinking for themselves,
they become hysterical, and as puppets go where they are yanked
with the greatest pull.
The aim of all the women, both old and new, should be to make
this season one of honor and reason by strictly following Pan
llellenic rules. The rttshees should look upon maligning influence
and "pressure'' as indications that the offending house is sorely
pressed for pledges.
The outcome of rushing is not a life and death matter, and
decisions should be made calmly and thoughtfully. The freshmen
will thank themselves if they act as individuals controlling them
selves rather than as puppets pulled by strings.
