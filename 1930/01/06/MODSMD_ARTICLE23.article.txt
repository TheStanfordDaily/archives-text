# COLLEGIATE SOFTIES
## 
### 
Dr. "Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior and president
of Stanford University, states that "the American advance in
economic status has given us too many youths who have never
known hardship. That is why football teams are so largely made
up of men who are working their way through college, facing ad
versity."
Dr. Wilbur's point is well taken. There are far too many
students in colleges and universities who float through four years
of academic work, buoyed along by generous allowances and a
restful lack of ambition, in preparation for what? In effect, noth
ing. Many of them will find ready-made fortunes on their hands
and their potential abilities as leaders in industry will have already
been nipped in the bud by the very education which strives to foster
latent leadership.
Dr. Wilbur's statement anent football is apt, a neatly put com
mentary on existing conditions. Teams for the most part represent
the cream of manhood. They are not made up of pampered softies,
however, and by the same token they do not represent men from
old line scions of America. The most superficial glance at any
football program will make that apparent.
And it goes further than that. Physical brawn is not the only
criterion by which the hardness of a man may be measured. Some
of the most capable and self-reliant men we know are thin, wiry
fellows who would be promptly killed in a line plunge on the
gridiron ; yet between classes they earn the wherewithal to keep
themselves alive and in that path leading to industrial success.
They are not softies. Would that we had more of them —
whether they be football heroes or confine their campus activities
to dragging a lunch wagon around to 20 or 30 fraternities every
night, wait on table, or sell jimcracks to classmates who are better
off economically but less fortunate industrially.
