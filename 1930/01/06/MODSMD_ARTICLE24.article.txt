"FOLLOW THRU"—Capitol Thea
tre, San Francisco.
Zelma O'Neal, the very popular
| Broadway comedienne, and her
[ partner, Allen Kearns, do their
best to save thp Pacific Coast pre
sentation of the successful New
York musical comedy "Follow
Thru" from a complete failure. Out
. side of the two members mentioned
above the rest of the cast, is not
worth notice. It may be advertised
as a "New York cast" —but what a
cast! But don't let that discourage
you from seeing the show. It is
worth attending just to hear and
j see Zelma and her partner do their
j stuff. You won't soon forget the
[ way they sing together, "Button
i Up Your Overcoat," nor the way
I she sings, "I Wanna Be Bad," by
herself!
The comedy is played against the
background and the social life of
the golf-playing "Bound Brook
Country Club." The scene shifts
from the clubhouse veranda to
various spots on the links, and then
back to the clubhouse and into the
women's dressing and shower room.
Here Allen and a friend disguised
as plumbers provide much amuse
ment in their attempts to rescue a
ring which has to do with the
thread of plot which runs through
I the comedy. This plot involves
j three separate pairs of lovers and
j two gold matches besides a pretty
j chorus (both ladies and gentle
i men).
The golf theme gives many
j chances to poke fun at the great
I American pastime and show up its
humorous side. This is especially
true when Zelma O'Neal and Allen
! Kearns are on the stage, separate
! ly or together. The show is theirs
! and worth seeing for that reason.

THE BEST SHORT STORIES OF
1929, edited by Edward J. O'-
Brien. (Dodd, Mead & Co., Pub
lishers. New York. 1929.)
j It, is, of course, very probable
| that two critics could not he found
j who would select for reprinting
the same twenty stories from the
: many hundreds which appear due
j ing the year. To argue with indi
' vidual selections is absurd, and
i this volume contains, o.i the whole,

' si creditable colled ion of tin* best
works of the yrfur it covers.
All of the stories in the book are
| good; but very few stand out as
gieat. Mt.ctern mass production of
lietion has caused practically all ol'
| these stories to fall into distinct
s groups in a manner which detracts
from their enjoyment. Moreover,
as H»-. O'Brien remarks in his in
troduction, "A year which produced
! one great story would he an excep
| tional one."
"Double Birthday," by Willa fa
ther, is the one story of the group
i wl ich contains the most nearly
j perfect combination of excellent
I style, development, and character
j analysis. Miss Gather's straight
i forward and correct style is well
; suited to an American scene; in
t bin work she presents a father and
| son who are not of the herd in a
modern city, and who find pleasure
i in a life which is not successful by
! common standards. More of a char
j acter study than a true short, story,
i "Double Birthday" is held together
j by unity of lone and interest.
Sherwood Anderson's "The Lost
Novel," which tells briefly of an
; author's devotion to an art of which
the best must be lost, presents the
best plot and plot development of
i the collection; from this standpoint
' it. is the masterpiece of the book.
Bui his unusually good idea is se
riously marred by the style of the
author. Anderson uses, throughout,
; sentences which, when not verb
less, are very short. There can be
( 110 doubt that, this was done delib
l erateiy, under the impression that
if was a proper treatment for the
subject matter. There is nothing
sacred to the rule that there shall
be a verb in every sentence —in oc
! casional paragraphs Anderson's
I treatment might show to great ad
-1 vantage; but when used constantly
: in a story it loses its justification,
just as capitals and italics lose em
phasis if used throughout a vol
j ume.
Other stories in the book are
good, but Ihey do not stand out.
All of them, however, as well as
Mr. O'Brien's interesting Introduc
tion. Magazine Averages, Biograph
ical Notes, and Honor Roles, merit
! the attention of those interested in
i modern fiction.
