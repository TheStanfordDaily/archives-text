"FOLLOW THRU"—Capitol Thea
tre, San Francisco.
Zelma O'Neal, the very popular
| Broadway comedienne, and her
[ partner, Allen Kearns, do their
best to save thp Pacific Coast pre
sentation of the successful New
York musical comedy "Follow
Thru" from a complete failure. Out
. side of the two members mentioned
above the rest of the cast, is not
worth notice. It may be advertised
as a "New York cast" —but what a
cast! But don't let that discourage
you from seeing the show. It is
worth attending just to hear and
j see Zelma and her partner do their
j stuff. You won't soon forget the
[ way they sing together, "Button
i Up Your Overcoat," nor the way
I she sings, "I Wanna Be Bad," by
herself!
The comedy is played against the
background and the social life of
the golf-playing "Bound Brook
Country Club." The scene shifts
from the clubhouse veranda to
various spots on the links, and then
back to the clubhouse and into the
women's dressing and shower room.
Here Allen and a friend disguised
as plumbers provide much amuse
ment in their attempts to rescue a
ring which has to do with the
thread of plot which runs through
I the comedy. This plot involves
j three separate pairs of lovers and
j two gold matches besides a pretty
j chorus (both ladies and gentle
i men).
The golf theme gives many
j chances to poke fun at the great
I American pastime and show up its
humorous side. This is especially
true when Zelma O'Neal and Allen
! Kearns are on the stage, separate
! ly or together. The show is theirs
! and worth seeing for that reason.

j It, is, of course, very probable

"Double Birthday," by Willa fa

i wl ich contains the most nearly
j perfect combination of excellent
I style, development, and character
j analysis. Miss Gather's straight
i forward and correct style is well
; suited to an American scene; in
t bin work she presents a father and
| son who are not of the herd in a
modern city, and who find pleasure
i in a life which is not successful by

i "Double Birthday" is held together
j by unity of lone and interest.
Sherwood Anderson's "The Lost
Novel," which tells briefly of an

the best must be lost, presents the
best plot and plot development of
i the collection; from this standpoint

Bui his unusually good idea is se
riously marred by the style of the
author. Anderson uses, throughout,
; sentences which, when not verb
less, are very short. There can be
( 110 doubt that, this was done delib
l erateiy, under the impression that
if was a proper treatment for the
subject matter. There is nothing
sacred to the rule that there shall
be a verb in every sentence —in oc

just as capitals and italics lose em

good, but Ihey do not stand out.
All of them, however, as well as
Mr. O'Brien's interesting Introduc

Zelma O'Neal, the very popular

best to save thp Pacific Coast pre
sentation of the successful New
York musical comedy "Follow
Thru" from a complete failure. Out
. side of the two members mentioned
above the rest of the cast, is not
worth notice. It may be advertised
as a "New York cast" —but what a
cast! But don't let that discourage
you from seeing the show. It is
worth attending just to hear and
j see Zelma and her partner do their
j stuff. You won't soon forget the
[ way they sing together, "Button
i Up Your Overcoat," nor the way
I she sings, "I Wanna Be Bad," by
herself!
The comedy is played against the
background and the social life of
the golf-playing "Bound Brook
Country Club." The scene shifts
from the clubhouse veranda to
various spots on the links, and then
back to the clubhouse and into the
women's dressing and shower room.
Here Allen and a friend disguised
as plumbers provide much amuse
ment in their attempts to rescue a
ring which has to do with the
thread of plot which runs through
I the comedy. This plot involves
j three separate pairs of lovers and
j two gold matches besides a pretty
j chorus (both ladies and gentle
i men).
The golf theme gives many
j chances to poke fun at the great
I American pastime and show up its
humorous side. This is especially
true when Zelma O'Neal and Allen

Sherwood Anderson's "The Lost

the best must be lost, presents the
best plot and plot development of
i the collection; from this standpoint

Bui his unusually good idea is se
riously marred by the style of the
author. Anderson uses, throughout,
; sentences which, when not verb
less, are very short. There can be
( 110 doubt that, this was done delib
l erateiy, under the impression that
if was a proper treatment for the
subject matter. There is nothing
sacred to the rule that there shall
be a verb in every sentence —in oc
! casional paragraphs Anderson's
I treatment might show to great ad
-1 vantage; but when used constantly
: in a story it loses its justification,
just as capitals and italics lose em
phasis if used throughout a vol
j ume.
Other stories in the book are
good, but Ihey do not stand out.
All of them, however, as well as
Mr. O'Brien's interesting Introduc

ical Notes, and Honor Roles, merit
! the attention of those interested in

"FOLLOW THRU"—Capitol Thea

Zelma O'Neal, the very popular
| Broadway comedienne, and her
[ partner, Allen Kearns, do their
best to save thp Pacific Coast pre
sentation of the successful New
York musical comedy "Follow
Thru" from a complete failure. Out
. side of the two members mentioned
above the rest of the cast, is not
worth notice. It may be advertised
as a "New York cast" —but what a
cast! But don't let that discourage
you from seeing the show. It is
worth attending just to hear and
j see Zelma and her partner do their
j stuff. You won't soon forget the
[ way they sing together, "Button
i Up Your Overcoat," nor the way
I she sings, "I Wanna Be Bad," by
herself!
The comedy is played against the
background and the social life of
the golf-playing "Bound Brook
Country Club." The scene shifts
from the clubhouse veranda to
various spots on the links, and then
back to the clubhouse and into the
women's dressing and shower room.
Here Allen and a friend disguised
as plumbers provide much amuse
ment in their attempts to rescue a
ring which has to do with the
thread of plot which runs through
I the comedy. This plot involves
j three separate pairs of lovers and
j two gold matches besides a pretty
j chorus (both ladies and gentle
i men).
The golf theme gives many
j chances to poke fun at the great
I American pastime and show up its
humorous side. This is especially
true when Zelma O'Neal and Allen
! Kearns are on the stage, separate
! ly or together. The show is theirs
! and worth seeing for that reason.
