# STUDENT CONGRESS CONCLUDED AS FINAL REPORTS ARE MADE
## 
### 
National conferences in which (
N.S.F.A. delegates probed into I
questions of student government, j
honor systems, publications, alh- j
letics, and fraternity and non-'or-|
gaiiization relations were in prog- j
ress Thursday and Friday by the i
Fifth Annual Cone res::.
At the conference on athletics, i
presided over by Stanford Stein- j
beck, resolutions were drawn up {
opposing subsidy and the disc-rim j
ination between .at hleleo and noil
athletes in providing employment, j
The resolutions were as follows:
"Resolved: That the N.S.F.A. go |
on record as recommending that j
there be no discrimination in giv- i
ing jobs to athletes, and that no
special salaries be given athletes."
"Resolved: That the N.S.F.A. go
on record as opposing all subsidy
as defined where a man receives
direct or indirect pecuniary remu
neration without any expending of
labor, other than his athletic abil
ity."
Scalping Discussed
A resolution favoring opposition
to the transferring of tickets as a
method of discouraging scalping
was tabled, when the matter was
boiled down and labeled as "a local
problem." The New York Univer
sity marked scalping as a "very
serious problem" where some scalp
ers get $1 on ordinary games and
as much as $1.50 on big games.
Stanford is one of the few insti
tutions' in the country not vitally
concerned with the problem of the
participation and the representa
tion of the non-fraternity group in
student affairs. This was made evi
dent throughout the national e.on
lerence on fraternity and non-or
ganization relations as factors in
campus morale which was led by
Leo Adams, of Southern California.
Minority Control
The non-organization group in
majority, but the political control
held by the minority fraternity
group, is the condition existing on
practically every "campus in the ;
country, according to the opinions I
voiced by the group. John Reynolds !
of the University of California ex
pressed satisfaction with the situa
tion. He stated that the non-frater
j m.ty group was composed largely
[ of those who were forced to work
1 their way through school. He felt
j that it was better than the han
-1 dling of the student affairs be left
with those who had the time and
; the interest, to devote to it.
I Other delegates presented solu
tions attempted at their respective
I schools. The University of Colo
j rado employs the Hare system of
i balloting. Other colleges have writ
j ten into their constitutions provi
| sions for definite representation
j from the non-organization groups.
Fraternity Influence
The influence of the fraternities
| in regards to athletics was dis
; cussed. Instances of fraternity dis
j sension which had injured teams at.
various schools were reported. Cer-
I tain colleges had found it nece-i-
I sary to do away with the team cap
j taincy; others adopted the scheme
of having two captains or of hav
; ing a rotating captaincy. Leo
Adams suggested the building up
of a strong interfraternity council
as a means of removing fraternity
| friction.
j The delegates next turned their
i attention to the problem of obtain
j ing fraternity co-operation at ali-
I university functions, particularly
I dances. Adams presented the sit u
i ation at U.S.C. where the fraternity
! men do not. support all-school
dances. This seemed to be the case
throughout the country. Cllenn Deg
ner of the University of Missouri
stated that his school had solved
this problem by appealing to the
women. "Men take their 'dates'
where the women want to go. Get
! the girls to favor the university
dances and the men will support
! them," Degner said.
Publications Group
j The publications discussion
| group, led by Tom Stoddard of Ihe
j University of Oregon, delved into
I problems of newspapers, year-
I books, magazines, scandal sheets,
I and razz sheets.
It was found by the group that
several campi have women editors
of annuals. It. was the opinion of
the University of California dele
gate that ''women do not. do much
work" in lliis regard; while a Colo
rado State Teachers' College dele
gate said, "A woman is neater and
tends to the finer points of an an
nual."
Pennsylvania Slate and the Uni
versity of Nevada have blanket sub
scriptions to yearbooksj These sub

scriptions must be paid at time <f
l egist rat ion.
Penn "Lit" Situation
An interesting sidelight in pub
lication of a literary magazine at
Pennsylvania State wan discussed.
Fresh/nan students are forced lo
purchase copies of the literary
magazine lo lie used for study in
English classes, in ibis manner
1500 subscribers are added to the
circulation of the magazine.
In considering newspaper prob
lems, the question of editorial poli
cies was taken up. "The Editor of
the Daily Californian is the most
jJbwerl'ul man on the California
campus," thÂ£ U.C. delegate de
( lat ed.
Council Member
Many of the delegates believed
that tin* editor of the campus news
paper should be a member of the
school's executive council. This
system was found to be in vogue
in many universities.
The formation of a national in
tercollegiate press association simi
lar to the Pacific Coast organiza
tion was suggested. Representa
tives from Kansas college news
papers said that no cigarette ad
vertising is accepted by the pub
lications.
Razz sheets are issued periodi
cally by many colleges. Some
schools experienced considerable
difficulty in the issuances of such
"Scandal sheets," delegates re
ported. The [I.C. representative
characterized the campus razz
sheet as an important publication
in which nothing but fact was
printed.
Honor Systems
Honor systems are a complete
failure at some schools; they are
fairly successful at most of the uni
versities in which they are In
force; they are highly successful at
a few of the smaller colleges.
Such were opinions expressed at
the conference on honor systems
held Friday afternoon. Stanford
delegates at the meeting did not
commit themselves when a show
of hands was called to indicate the
success of the honor system at.
each of the institutions represented.
A majority of t lie delegates be
lieved that the honor system
should be narrow in scope, includ
ing only scholastic work. By the
experience of the various schools,
it was shown that as the system
was expanded to include social con
duct, honesty in the matter of prop
erty, and the handling of library
books, its effectiveness was dimin
ished.
The principal obstacle in the
way of die success of honor sys
tems, the conference brought out,
was the general ethical objection
against reporting violations. While
most of the southern institutions
insist on reporting scholastic dis
honesty as a part of the system, it

lms been found generally unsatis
factory in the North and West.
Larger universities, notably
U.C.Ij.A. and California, found
honor systems the lenst workable.
Fnfair examinations were believed

t<> lx' one of the principal causes 01
dishonesty in scholastic work.
Though no official vote was taken
t>n the matter, the conference
seemed in favor of the use of some
kind of honor system or code.
