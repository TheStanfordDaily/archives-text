## Stanford Rate Is Lowest Of Major Colleges Despite Raise 
### Art McGarr 
"Stanford's increase in its tui
tion foe was just a case of keeping
up willi the progress of higher edu
rational institutions in this coun
try," said Comptroller Almon JO.
Jioth yesterday in commenting on
tlie $15 increase which goes into
effect next October. "This increase
is the only way that we could main
tain the faculty retirement allow
ance in the face of the modification
-which the Carnegie Foundation lias
boon compelled to make in its pen
sion grants.
"As a matter of fact, Stanford's
tuition is still the lowest of any of
the major endowed institutions in
tin; United States. Princeton, Har
vard, Yale, Cornell, are all higher
than ours.
"Until l!i20 Stanford had no tui
tion fee at all except a $10 inci
dental fee which was supposed to
cover a few current running ex
penses," continued itot.li in giving
a history of student fees in the
university. "As a result of the
war and the shrinkage of the Amer
ican dollar, the board of trustees
decided to charge a tuition fee of
$40, which fee did not include the
$10 incidental fee. This tuition fee
was all that saved us in those
years after the war.
"in November of the same year
the tuition was increased to $75
and thus it lias remained until the
present time. With the innovation
of the tuition fee of that year,"
Roth pointed out, "the University
used two means of encouraging
the self-supporting student. One
was the deferred payment of tui
tion fees, known as tuition notes,
by which the student, may defer
tlie payment of his tuition fee for
seven years, with no interest
charged. Ten to fifteen per cent
of tlie students take advantage of
this.
"The other was the awarding of
scholarships. These were first
started in 1!>20 and the number of
scholarships has increased rapidly
up to this time. At first, available
scholarships amounted to $4,41"), j
and income for loan funds amount- i
e<| to $5,150. By 1020, the donated ,
income for scholarships had in- ;
creased to S' 13,554, and the loan
fund to $17,054.
"Willi the number of scholar- j
ships increasing each year there |
i: - . no need for the worry on the j
part of soni" people that Stanford I
i; on its way to becoming a rich ,
man's institution. As it is now j
t ach student pays only one-third
of the price of his education. In
