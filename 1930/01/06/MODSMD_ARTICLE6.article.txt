# FRESHMAN QUINTET WINS AND LOSES IN WEEK-END BATTLES
## 
### 
After trouncing a weak St.
Mary's frosh quintet 40-10 last Fri
day night, Coach Jimmy Brad-'
| shaw's freshman basketball artists
> failed to come up to snuff and were
i downed 42-30 Saturday night by
jan aggressive Sacramento Junior
! College five. Tway and Hancock,
Cardinal guards, who completely
smothered efforts of the Saint for
wards to find the bucket, had great
difficulty even in getting the ball
off the backboard during the Jaysee
game.
Meade, Stanford left forward, ap
peared the class of babe offense
I in both games. Against the Saints
i Meade was high-point man with
' eleven counters, while he scored
HI of the Cards' 30 points in the
I Sacramento contest. Edelen, frosh
i center, contributed a good portion
i of the scoring in both games.
Against the Saints the Cards iiad
| everything their own way, and only
j a large number of setup shots
' missed by Edelen and by Palmer,
| whose shooting was far below par,
kept the Stanford score from
i mounting even higher. Mahoney
; appeared the best of the Saints'
i outfit.
