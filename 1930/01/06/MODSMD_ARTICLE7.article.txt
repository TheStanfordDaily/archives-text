large and unwieldy to yield any
I constructive benefits, according to
| Mid Atlantic representatives who
i discussed problems peculiar to
j their district Friday evening. In
I place of the present type of con-

j regional conventions he held and
I that two representatives from each
j regional congress be sent to the
i national conclave.
