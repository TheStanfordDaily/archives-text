By Elizabeth Larsh
The parts of Mirandolina, "The
Mistress of the Inn," and several of
her suitors were cast last night by
Harold Hclvenston, acting director of
dramatics, the leads being given to
Ruth Beede, Vallcjo (iautner, and Ar
{ thur Hurt.
j Ruth Bcede, a transfer from Mills
I College, Oakland, made her fir.st ap
pearance on the Stanford stage this
I summer when he played opposite Gor
j don Davis, director of dramatics on
| leave, in S. N. Behrman's brilliant
comedy, "The Second Man." As Mon
ica Grey, the young and passionate in
genue in love with the author, < lark
Storey, played by Davis, Miss Beede
gave an excellent performance of the
I part which drew such favor in the
| Hast when it was done by Margalo
Gilmore, of the New York Theater
Guild.
The role of Mirandolina, in
Goldoni's comedy "The Mistress of
the Inn," is one which presents very
different possibilities from those of the
past few campus productions. Miran
dolina, "The Mistress," is an extreme
ly attractive woman whose charms
win her a numcrwus and varied fol
lowing of suitors.
The parts of the Marquis of For
lipopoli and the Cavalier of Cipafratta,
! two noble rivals for the hand of ".La
I Locandiera," or "The Mistress of the
jinn," will he taken by Arthur Hurt
|and Vallcjo (iautner respectively. Hurt
lis known to campus audiences for his
j.work in last year's big succcs , Bar

trie's "What Fvcry Woman Knows,"
j in which he played one of Maggie
I Wylie s brothers. His excellent in
terpretation <if Old Jieppo, the im
portant character part in A. A. Milne's
"The ivory Door," which was given
i last fall, as well as his numerous ap-
I pearances in football shows, junior
I operas, and others of the less serious
jcanipu.i productions, has made Hurt a
favorite with Stanford audiences. Val
lejo Gantner is a new man on the
I campus and unknown to dramatic pa-
J irons, and the part of the. Cavalier
I will be an excellent vehicle for his
| debut.
Fryer to Be Servant
(iaillard Fryer, who played the but
ler in "Not I lerbert," last year's sen
ior farce, will do the part of the
i Cavalier's servant; and Edward \Y.
| Field, who played the part of the doc
' tor in Karcl Capek's "The Makropou
' los Secret" this summer, will be seen
;as the Count of Albaliorita, another
I of Mirandolina's suitors.
I Two women's parts, both actresses,
jas well as that of Fabrizzio, also a
; follower of "The Mistress," will be
least today, according to Helvenston.
This serious comedy by Carlo Gol
doni, one of Italy's most famous
[dramatists of all time, has been pro
duced only a few times in this coun
try, the last performance having been
| in New York under llie direction of
! l .va lc Gallienne. Her production of
this classic, under llie original title
"La L,ocandiera," was highly acclaimed
j there.
