# Freshmen Quintet To Meet College Of Pacific Tonight
## 
### 
Fresh from an overwhelming vic
tory over tlie St. Mary's lirst-year
basketball team, and a close game
with Sacramento Junior College,
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw's Stanford
yearling quintet will meet the Col
j lege of Pacific Kittens at. (>:45 this
j evening as a preliminary to the
j Varsity-Pacific contest.
Yesterday Bradshaw put the
| Baby Itedshirts through a stiff
workout, concentrating principally
upon defense, as the latter phase
of the game looked weak in the
Jaysee encounter. The freshman
players looked noticeably bad on
foul shots, missing an unusual mini
i ber of free throws during their first
| games.
Meade, forward, and Fdelen,
center, have been the most con
| sistent shots on the Card squad,
j being responsible for most, of the
j points made this season. Palmer
showed some nice floor work
against the Saints, but his passing
wasn't quite up to par in the Jaysee
contest. Tway and Hancock are
scheduled to start at the guard
I positions, and Kite will probably
j see action before the game is over.
