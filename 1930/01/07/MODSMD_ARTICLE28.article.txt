# ROTHERT MAY START TONIGHT AGAINST TIGERS
## Captain in Shape to Play In Spite of Reports of Ruptured Blood Vessel Cards Picked to Win Third Straight Victory in Fray With College of Pacific 
### 
Ey Stephen Dietrich
With Captain Harlow Rothert
definitely in shape to play, the
Cardinal varsity five will meet a.
i strong aggregation from the Col
i lege of Pacific tonight at <S o'clock
i in the Pavilion, in its final practice
game before the Coast Conference
opener at U.C.L.A. on Saturday.
Despite reports in certain Bay
f'ity papers that Rothert is on the
bench for the rest of the week with
a broken blood vessel sustained in
yhe San Jose tiit, Coach Husky
Hunt is thinking seriously of start
ing the Redshirt leader.
Rothert was out for practice yes
terday afternoon, and despite a
bandaged foot, was getting about
the court with more than enough
vim and vigor.
Mears May Start
However, Jimmy Mears may get
his hig chance tonight, if Hunt de
cides to give Rothert a rest for the
Bruin contest. The rangy guard
has been showing up well in prac
tice of late, and may give the regu
lar defensive players more compe
tition than they are expecting be
fore the season is over.
Johnny McCandlereplaced Bill
Doub on the first siring in yester
day's workout, and is slated to
open at center for the Cards to
night. If McCandless has a good
night at tipping them in from un
der the basket, Pacific; will do well
to concentrate on bottling up the
elongated pivot man. Which is no
easy task, as was demonstrated in
the Spartan game, in which Mc-
Candless sprayed the ball through
the hoop with great regularity.
Veteran Tiger Squad
Although favored to hang up its
third straight victory, Stanford is
far from a cinch to tame the Pacific
Tigers. Coach Swede Righter is
bringing a fast, veteran squad from
the tule swamps of Stockton, and
fully expects to upset the Cards.
Two years ago, Itighter's men
actually turned the trick, while
last winter they were barely nosed
out in the last minute of play. And
now comes the report that. Pacific
is better than ever, having won all
j four of its games to date, including
a 2ii to 21 victory over Y)regon
j State. The latter team, it. will he
! remembered, won quite handily
from the Cards during the Christ
mas holidays.
Led by Captain Heath, the Tigers
I have a now criss-cross style of at
j tack that is hard to stop. Heath, at
i forward, is reputed to be an eagle
j eye when it comes to looping in
difficult shots. Moose Dixbrow, cen-
I tor, is another man who is likely
| to cause the Cards plenty of I rou
ble. being death on hatting in
| sucker shols.
The preliminary game, between
| the Stanford Babes and Pacific
I Prosh, is scheduled to start at 6:45.
