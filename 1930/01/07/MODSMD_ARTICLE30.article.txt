# STANFORD'S PART IN GROUP ACCOMPLISHMENT
## 
### 
\lthough ilic entire campus banded together and successfully
accomplished the titanic task of presenting tlie fifth annual con
gress of the .National Students' Federation of America, Stanford
participants in the numerous discussion groups of the conclave
were noticeably few.
As Stanford is a school with extraordinary problems in student
government, hall and row relations conditions, and co-education,
its representatives should have voiced our peculiarities at the dis
cussion sessions.
One of the most congresses ever in session at Stanford
lias just adjourned. The mechanics of the meeting were executed
by Cardinal "iron men" with the skill of engineers. I'ut Stanford
i ( presentation in the field of discussion and exchange of local ex
perience should have played a more important role in the vehicle
of the great national drama of student leaders so recently presented.
