# CHURCH-GOING STUDENTS
## 
### 
From \ illanova College in Pennsylvania comes the word that
only 300,000 of America's more than a million students attend some
form of religious observation, and, in addition, that institutions of
higher learning fail to emphasize religion now as they have in the
past.
The report seems to cast aspersion upon the American student
as lacking all reverence for the divine.
Since the beginning of the twentieth century, and more particu
larly during and following the World War, the churches have be
come estranged from the students and it is only in the parochial
schools or in institutions requiring attendance at chapel that the
younger generation may be seen.
This is termed the age of specialization and because churches
do not teach economics and animal biology it is no logical brief
for those who argue the universities should concentrate their efforts
to develop theism. The universities are improving their courses of
study and consequently attract more pupils every year. The
churches remain in the same rut and lose their appeal to the young
man and woman.
