# BIOLOGY AND SKEPTICISM

1 Vii 111 re to accept literally the lliblical account of Jonah and the
whale, and of Noah and the ark, and his open denial of the stories
to a class of ministerial sophomores has cost Dr. Horace Calvin
Day his position as biology instructor at I loward College, a I'aptist
institution at Ih'rmingham.
It seems that Dr. Day was addressing a class as was his custom,
rI is "text" for the day was "The Skeptical."
"In my undergraduate days at Leland Stanford 1 thought T was
ignorant, but today I find some people so ignorant that they still
believe that Xoali crowded two of each species into an ark during
the flood.
"There are others." he continued, "who think that Jonah was
actually swallowed by a whale. During my years of biological ex
perience I have studied two different kinds of whale and found that
it is impossible for either of them to swallow a man whole, and.
anyway, no man could live inside a whale."
Led by a youthful divine, one (lallman, the class retreated in
the white heat of a holy anger. They prayed a while for the fate
of Dr. Day's heretical soul and then laid their case before the
proper authorities. The good doctor was summoned, and his resig
nation demanded. This last he tendered immediately.
It is our naive belief that both Dr. Day and Howard College
have profited immensely by the shakeup. There is a future for such
a man as Day. Regardless of his merit as a biologist, he has been
wasting hi- time by devoting it to an institution which trains juries
for future Dayton evolution trials. And then, Howard College is
rot losing much. It doesn't need a biology department.—Daily fllini.
