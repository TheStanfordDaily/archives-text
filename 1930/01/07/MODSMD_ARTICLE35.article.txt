THE DUNCAN SISTERS—The
New Stanford.
In this latest extravaganza of Met
rt>-(jold\vyii-Mayer, the Duncan Sis
ters are used as an excuse for gorge
ous sets and chorus girls. The plot
is the usual thing. Two sisters who
are on their way to success on Hroad
way are separated by one of the sis
ters marrying. Hard times follow but
it all turns out happily in the end.
The two sisters are of course played
by Rosetta and Vivian Duncan. They
are as charming as they ever were on
' the legitimate stage. "Following Me,"
I the theme song of the picture, is
| catching and the Duncans' harmony is
always good.
The plot is rather thin, but those
who still enjoy beautiful chorusVs,
legs, and spectacular costumes will
overlook the shortcomings.
| POINTED HEELS—At Varsity.
"Pointed Heels" should interest a
rather larger number of students
than have been interested for a
long time. The plot is hackneyed,
terribly hackneyed. The hero is
rich, the heroine is a beautiful
chorus girl, the hero's mother tie
tests all that has to do with tlm
stage, disinherits her son the hero
is hurt, dreadfully hurt ami the
heroine dances forward, and Oh!
Go to see it. I did. And finish tin'
story for yourself.
Helen (Sugar) Kane, the boop-a
-■ doop-boop girl, is good. She sings,
and her songs go over. She's just
like her records, she fairly drips
babyishness, but she's good, never
theless, and the whole picture is
worth seeing because she is just
that. "Skeets" Gallagher sings with
| her and makes a hit, too. You'll en
joy them, all the more because
you'll have a sneaking notion that
you shouldn't. They're both silly,
and loud, and and boop-a-doop
boop.
There is a great deal of music.
' The hero is writing a symphony of
love and it's very touching in its
way'. He tries to write jazz for the
money returns, and fails almost.
The music is good; you'll like to
listen to it, because it is peppy and
; new and well-sung, and because if
isn't Mendelssohn and played
i softly.
I William Powell plays another
part —a new one, and plays it up
to snuff. He even dresses for it.
He's not the "n-dropping" detec
| tive, or the "slick-eyed" villain this
( time; he's a man of fashion, and
'a gentleman. He loves our heroine
—and gives her up to the hero —
that's where the hackneyed plot
comes in again. It keeps coming in

SKAZKI, by Ida Zeitlin (Farrar
and Rinehart, publishers).
At a time when bookstores bulge
i with brittle, sophisticated novels and
| tazing, philosophical, critical, or scien
tific works, it is with great relief that
j the modern reader comes across a book
| like "Skazki" which releases the folk
: lore of that ever-glamorous woneler
j land, Russia.
j "Skazki" is a collection of tales and
j legends of ( )ld Russia, as told by Ida
. Zeitlin. The stories, thirteen in ntim
i her, are drawn from a variety of
sources, including Afanasiev, Pushkin
and Zhukovskv. "Sadko," for instance
lis a typical legend of the free city of
■Novgorod in its prime, and "Kyrih
the Tanner" is ;t legend of Kiev. Tin
| translation is not exact, but the beaut)
! of the first folklores is somehow pre
j served to a miraculous degree.
The deepest charm of the book lies'
J perhaps in its words alone. The
quaint simple sentences are intensely
i fascinating, and the strange, rich fan
| tasies which these sentences weave in
| toxicatc the imagination—even of the
J most discriminating or jaded reader
i The effect is very similar to Donnt
{ l'yrnne's "Messer Marco Polo." Tin
i appeal in both books is chiefly fineness
land delicacy of romantic sentiment
| coupled with an exquisite texture of
! language.
However, the author's prologue in
! troduces the book far better thai
' any prosaic reviewer's vocabulary
; could. She writes —
| "There is a halcyon sea, and Iron
; it- untroubled waters silver mists rise
"And a gnarled oak grows on the
| shore, and a learned cat that is chainec
I with a chain fit" gold walks forwarc
I and back. And he sings as he goes
to the right, and as he goes to the lefl
he tells strange tales of enchantment
"And the breath of Russia lies
sweet* and sweet over all the palace
broods the soul of Russia.
"112 have been there beside the hal
cyon sea, and underneath the oak
quaffed golden mean, and heard the
strange tales of the learned cat. Ant
so 1 tell them to vou."

SKAZKI, by Ida Zeitlin (Farrar
and Rinehart, publishers).
At a time when bookstores bulge
i with brittle, sophisticated novels and
| tazing, philosophical, critical, or scien
tific works, it is with great relief that
j the modern reader comes across a book
| like "Skazki" which releases the folk
: lore of that ever-glamorous woneler
j land, Russia.
j "Skazki" is a collection of tales and
j legends of ( )ld Russia, as told by Ida
. Zeitlin. The stories, thirteen in ntim
i her, are drawn from a variety of
sources, including Afanasiev, Pushkin
and Zhukovskv. "Sadko," for instance
lis a typical legend of the free city of
■Novgorod in its prime, and "Kyrih
the Tanner" is ;t legend of Kiev. Tin
| translation is not exact, but the beaut)
! of the first folklores is somehow pre
j served to a miraculous degree.
The deepest charm of the book lies'
J perhaps in its words alone. The
quaint simple sentences are intensely
i fascinating, and the strange, rich fan
| tasies which these sentences weave in
| toxicatc the imagination—even of the
J most discriminating or jaded reader
i The effect is very similar to Donnt
{ l'yrnne's "Messer Marco Polo." Tin
i appeal in both books is chiefly fineness
land delicacy of romantic sentiment
| coupled with an exquisite texture of
! language.
However, the author's prologue in
! troduces the book far better thai
' any prosaic reviewer's vocabulary
; could. She writes —
| "There is a halcyon sea, and Iron
; it- untroubled waters silver mists rise
"And a gnarled oak grows on the
| shore, and a learned cat that is chainec
I with a chain fit" gold walks forwarc
I and back. And he sings as he goes
to the right, and as he goes to the lefl
he tells strange tales of enchantment
"And the breath of Russia lies
sweet* and sweet over all the palace
broods the soul of Russia.
"112 have been there beside the hal
cyon sea, and underneath the oak
quaffed golden mean, and heard the
strange tales of the learned cat. Ant

THE DUNCAN SISTERS—The
New Stanford.
In this latest extravaganza of Met
rt>-(jold\vyii-Mayer, the Duncan Sis
ters are used as an excuse for gorge
ous sets and chorus girls. The plot
is the usual thing. Two sisters who
are on their way to success on Hroad
way are separated by one of the sis
ters marrying. Hard times follow but
it all turns out happily in the end.
The two sisters are of course played
by Rosetta and Vivian Duncan. They
are as charming as they ever were on
' the legitimate stage. "Following Me,"
I the theme song of the picture, is
| catching and the Duncans' harmony is
always good.
The plot is rather thin, but those
who still enjoy beautiful chorusVs,
legs, and spectacular costumes will
overlook the shortcomings.
| POINTED HEELS—At Varsity.
"Pointed Heels" should interest a
rather larger number of students
than have been interested for a
long time. The plot is hackneyed,
terribly hackneyed. The hero is
rich, the heroine is a beautiful
chorus girl, the hero's mother tie
tests all that has to do with tlm
stage, disinherits her son the hero
is hurt, dreadfully hurt ami the
heroine dances forward, and Oh!
Go to see it. I did. And finish tin'
story for yourself.
Helen (Sugar) Kane, the boop-a
-■ doop-boop girl, is good. She sings,
and her songs go over. She's just
like her records, she fairly drips
babyishness, but she's good, never
theless, and the whole picture is
worth seeing because she is just
that. "Skeets" Gallagher sings with
| her and makes a hit, too. You'll en
joy them, all the more because
you'll have a sneaking notion that
you shouldn't. They're both silly,
and loud, and and boop-a-doop
boop.
There is a great deal of music.
' The hero is writing a symphony of
love and it's very touching in its
way'. He tries to write jazz for the
money returns, and fails almost.
The music is good; you'll like to
listen to it, because it is peppy and
; new and well-sung, and because if
isn't Mendelssohn and played
i softly.
I William Powell plays another
part —a new one, and plays it up
to snuff. He even dresses for it.
He's not the "n-dropping" detec
| tive, or the "slick-eyed" villain this
( time; he's a man of fashion, and
'a gentleman. He loves our heroine
—and gives her up to the hero —
that's where the hackneyed plot

SKAZKI, by Ida Zeitlin (Farrar
and Rinehart, publishers).
At a time when bookstores bulge
i with brittle, sophisticated novels and
| tazing, philosophical, critical, or scien
tific works, it is with great relief that
j the modern reader comes across a book
| like "Skazki" which releases the folk
: lore of that ever-glamorous woneler
j land, Russia.
j "Skazki" is a collection of tales and
j legends of ( )ld Russia, as told by Ida
. Zeitlin. The stories, thirteen in ntim
i her, are drawn from a variety of
sources, including Afanasiev, Pushkin
and Zhukovskv. "Sadko," for instance
lis a typical legend of the free city of
■Novgorod in its prime, and "Kyrih
the Tanner" is ;t legend of Kiev. Tin
| translation is not exact, but the beaut)
! of the first folklores is somehow pre
j served to a miraculous degree.
The deepest charm of the book lies'
J perhaps in its words alone. The
quaint simple sentences are intensely
i fascinating, and the strange, rich fan
| tasies which these sentences weave in
| toxicatc the imagination—even of the
J most discriminating or jaded reader
i The effect is very similar to Donnt
{ l'yrnne's "Messer Marco Polo." Tin
i appeal in both books is chiefly fineness
land delicacy of romantic sentiment
| coupled with an exquisite texture of
! language.
However, the author's prologue in
! troduces the book far better thai
' any prosaic reviewer's vocabulary
; could. She writes —
| "There is a halcyon sea, and Iron
; it- untroubled waters silver mists rise
"And a gnarled oak grows on the
| shore, and a learned cat that is chainec
I with a chain fit" gold walks forwarc
I and back. And he sings as he goes
to the right, and as he goes to the lefl
he tells strange tales of enchantment
"And the breath of Russia lies
