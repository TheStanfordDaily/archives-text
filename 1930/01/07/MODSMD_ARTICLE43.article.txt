| Montgomery, Toby IJansa, and
i Tom Parkinson have been devel

! oped by the former Pitt star and

Twice the Panther has been in
j vited to represent the ISast in the
j annual Tournament of Roses game ,
I with a Pacific Coast opponent at
Pasadena, Calif., the first time in
1927 and again at the end of the j
| past season.
