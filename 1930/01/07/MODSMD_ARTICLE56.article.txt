PULLMAN, Wash., Jan. G.—"To j
one who has associated with col
lege students over a period of \
years it is plainly evident that the '
present generation .of students is
better behaved, easier disciplined, I
arid I think, happier than at any
time in the last 25 years."
This was the statement here to- j
day of Professor H. H. House, a ;
member of the physical education
faculty at the State College of j
Washington.
"Intramural athletics are partly
responsible for this change in atti
tudes, because they have satisfied I
one basic feeling—the love of com- I
petition—the testing of oneself I
against an opponent. Other factors !
such as debate, music, work on stu- !
dent publications, etc., have also 1
been of much value in bringing '
about a changed situation."
