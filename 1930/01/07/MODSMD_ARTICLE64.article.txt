PASADENA, Jan. *i. (/Pi.—Sci
ence, bringing artillery and ma
chine Rims, has made war no more
destructive than if men still fought
with swords and spears, it is con
tended by Dr. Robert S. IVlillikun,
president of the American Associa
tion for the Advancement of Sci
ence.
"Can science escape the responsi
; bility for 2€,000,000 lives lost in
' the World War?" he asked, in ad
dressing a meeting here. "That is
;t matter of opinion.
"Granting only that these people
nil got to the fighting line, 1 am
•sure that, with only ancient man's
'weapons, the sword, the shield,
and the spear, and given the same
issues to tight, about, the 13,000,000
: who died in battle might not have
been even more. And, without mod
ern medical science, the 13,000,000
additional civilian deaths almost
certainly would have been aug
-1 men ted.
; "Every new scientific advance
finds ten times as many new
lul, constructive uses as destruc
tive. War is being abolished at tiie
present time due to the relentless
j advance of science, its most power
ful enemy."
