# TOONER VILLE RAILS WILL BE REMOVED
## 
### 
The Toonerville is gone but the
memory lingers. Translated into
more practical language this
means that even though Stanford
lias seen tlie last of its famous
street car, the tracks that once
guided its wandering ways still re
main on the campus as a remem
brance of more halcyon days of
the almost forgotten past.
But according to the Comptrol
lers office, even this reminder will
be gone within the next few
months. In April or May the new
highway at the edge of the campus
will be built and then it will be
goodbye street car tracks. Thus do
traditions and such give way to the
forward march of progress.
