## FARM-COACHED COACHES 
### 
When the average person thinks
of Stanford University, such things
as stellar students, high-minded
professors, cactus gardens, and
Hoover's hut up on the hill pop
into his head. And when the sports
fan visions the quiet sanctitudes of
the Farm, he sees a cloud of smoke,
from which now and then emerges
the face and form of one Pop War
ner, or subsidized athletes dashing
down the turf for touchdowns, and
world's discus records falling.
It just doesn't occur to the
common being that Stanford
is also an institution for train
ing and developing first class
coaches. More and more,
though, people are beginning
to realize that coaches grow
"where the winds of freedom
blow." For of late, the Farm
has been turning out a promis
ing crop of young athletic in
structors as well as presidents
and cabinet secretaries.
Last fall I he fans got a squint of
what Dud DeGroot could do to a
hunch of green football aspirants.
DeGroot, it will be remembered,
used to do a lot of mighty fine
gridiron cavorting on the Farm
himself. In fact, he was good
enough to make all-coast center.
Now Mr. DeGroot is athletic direc
tor at Menlo J.C. find his record
to date has been quite equal to his
college reputation.
Last Friday night the local
spectators were treated by an
other look at what a Stanford
athlete of a few years gone by
can do in the line of coaching.
Ted Shipkey, who used to star
at snagging passes, tossing
javelins, and looping baskets
between classes, brought down
a quintet from Sacramento J.C.
to play the Frosh. Shipkey, it
seems, can instruct as well as
he could play, for his players
handsomely trounced the Card
Babes. It is also interesting to
note that his J.C. football team
won the championship of its
class in California.
Tonight the students will get
their third glimpse of a team |
coached by a former Redshirt, j
when the College of Pacific five in- ,
vades the campus. Coach Swede !
Righter has been head man of j
Pacific Coast hoop teams for a long >
time now, ever since he was all-
Coast center, and he has been do- |
ing a good job of turning out win- i
ning squads. Two years ago lie sur- j
prised Husky Hunt by upsetting |
the hitter's outfit. Last winter j
Stanford barely nosed out Pacific.
Righter's team, so it is said, is no
slouch this year.
At any rate, the students will
continue to see teams coached
by Stanford products in the
future. For each year the
bumper crop of Farm-coached
coaches grows larger. All of
which is high recommendation
and praise to the Stanford sys
tem of athletics, and to the
men who spend their time
throughout the year developing
green men into finished teams.

The 8.A.C., it seems, is intent on
having Stanford athletes lead the
r< st of the Coast players in the
world of fashion. First, the football
team trotted out in the Stadium
donned in cardinal and white pan
taloons, and now we have the bas
ketball quintet tripping around the
Pavilion in nice little red sailor
suits.
When Hunt's boys, in their
movie-like outfits, appeared on
the home court for the first
time last Friday night, they
were greeted with awe rather
than the usual outburst of ex
clamation. Some of the fans
thought that perhaps the play
ers were members of the dra
matics department, who were
going to present a short skit
before the game. A majority
of the spectators sat back in
their seats expecting the sailor
suited boys to dance the horn
pipe.
The football pantaloons had
some practical value, for they
helped the players to spot each
oilier on the field. However, one
lails to see why the basket ball
team wears little red sailor sweat
suits unless for the stylish effect.
And what an effect! As someone
said at, the game, "all they need
are red stocking caps to make them
look like sea-gnomes."
Yet, at all events, the suits
don't seem to go to the boys'
heads, as the results of the
week-end double-header well
show. —By Stephen Dietrich.

himself. In fact, he was good
enough to make all-coast center.
Now Mr. DeGroot is athletic direc
tor at Menlo J.C. find his record
to date has been quite equal to his
college reputation.
Last Friday night the local
spectators were treated by an
other look at what a Stanford
athlete of a few years gone by
can do in the line of coaching.
Ted Shipkey, who used to star
at snagging passes, tossing
javelins, and looping baskets
between classes, brought down
a quintet from Sacramento J.C.
to play the Frosh. Shipkey, it
seems, can instruct as well as
he could play, for his players
handsomely trounced the Card
Babes. It is also interesting to
note that his J.C. football team
won the championship of its
class in California.
Tonight the students will get
their third glimpse of a team |
coached by a former Redshirt, j
when the College of Pacific five in- ,
vades the campus. Coach Swede !
Righter has been head man of j
Pacific Coast hoop teams for a long >
time now, ever since he was all-
Coast center, and he has been do- |
ing a good job of turning out win- i
ning squads. Two years ago lie sur- j
prised Husky Hunt by upsetting |
the hitter's outfit. Last winter j
Stanford barely nosed out Pacific.
Righter's team, so it is said, is no
slouch this year.
At any rate, the students will
continue to see teams coached
by Stanford products in the
future. For each year the
bumper crop of Farm-coached
coaches grows larger. All of
which is high recommendation
and praise to the Stanford sys
tem of athletics, and to the
men who spend their time
throughout the year developing
green men into finished teams.

The 8.A.C., it seems, is intent on
having Stanford athletes lead the
r< st of the Coast players in the
world of fashion. First, the football
team trotted out in the Stadium
donned in cardinal and white pan
taloons, and now we have the bas
ketball quintet tripping around the
Pavilion in nice little red sailor
suits.
When Hunt's boys, in their
movie-like outfits, appeared on
the home court for the first
time last Friday night, they
were greeted with awe rather
than the usual outburst of ex
clamation. Some of the fans
thought that perhaps the play
ers were members of the dra
matics department, who were
going to present a short skit
before the game. A majority
of the spectators sat back in
their seats expecting the sailor
suited boys to dance the horn
pipe.
The football pantaloons had
some practical value, for they
helped the players to spot each
oilier on the field. However, one
lails to see why the basket ball
team wears little red sailor sweat
suits unless for the stylish effect.
And what an effect! As someone
said at, the game, "all they need
are red stocking caps to make them
look like sea-gnomes."
Yet, at all events, the suits
don't seem to go to the boys'
heads, as the results of the
week-end double-header well
show. —By Stephen Dietrich.
When the average person thinks
of Stanford University, such things
as stellar students, high-minded
professors, cactus gardens, and
Hoover's hut up on the hill pop
into his head. And when the sports
fan visions the quiet sanctitudes of
the Farm, he sees a cloud of smoke,
from which now and then emerges
the face and form of one Pop War
ner, or subsidized athletes dashing
down the turf for touchdowns, and
world's discus records falling.
It just doesn't occur to the
common being that Stanford
is also an institution for train
ing and developing first class
coaches. More and more,
though, people are beginning
to realize that coaches grow
"where the winds of freedom
blow." For of late, the Farm
has been turning out a promis
ing crop of young athletic in
structors as well as presidents
and cabinet secretaries.
Last fall I he fans got a squint of
what Dud DeGroot could do to a

time now, ever since he was all-
Coast center, and he has been do- |
ing a good job of turning out win- i
ning squads. Two years ago lie sur- j
prised Husky Hunt by upsetting |
the hitter's outfit. Last winter j
Stanford barely nosed out Pacific.
Righter's team, so it is said, is no
slouch this year.
At any rate, the students will
continue to see teams coached
by Stanford products in the
future. For each year the
bumper crop of Farm-coached
coaches grows larger. All of
which is high recommendation
and praise to the Stanford sys
tem of athletics, and to the
men who spend their time
throughout the year developing
green men into finished teams.

The 8.A.C., it seems, is intent on
having Stanford athletes lead the
r< st of the Coast players in the
world of fashion. First, the football
team trotted out in the Stadium
donned in cardinal and white pan
taloons, and now we have the bas
ketball quintet tripping around the
Pavilion in nice little red sailor
suits.
When Hunt's boys, in their
movie-like outfits, appeared on
the home court for the first
time last Friday night, they
were greeted with awe rather
than the usual outburst of ex
clamation. Some of the fans
thought that perhaps the play
ers were members of the dra
matics department, who were
going to present a short skit
before the game. A majority
of the spectators sat back in
their seats expecting the sailor
suited boys to dance the horn
pipe.
The football pantaloons had
some practical value, for they
helped the players to spot each
oilier on the field. However, one
lails to see why the basket ball
team wears little red sailor sweat
suits unless for the stylish effect.
And what an effect! As someone
said at, the game, "all they need
are red stocking caps to make them
look like sea-gnomes."
Yet, at all events, the suits
don't seem to go to the boys'
heads, as the results of the
week-end double-header well
show. —By Stephen Dietrich.
When the average person thinks
of Stanford University, such things
as stellar students, high-minded
professors, cactus gardens, and
Hoover's hut up on the hill pop
into his head. And when the sports
fan visions the quiet sanctitudes of
the Farm, he sees a cloud of smoke,
from which now and then emerges
the face and form of one Pop War
ner, or subsidized athletes dashing
down the turf for touchdowns, and
world's discus records falling.
It just doesn't occur to the
common being that Stanford
is also an institution for train
ing and developing first class
coaches. More and more,
though, people are beginning
to realize that coaches grow
"where the winds of freedom
blow." For of late, the Farm
has been turning out a promis
ing crop of young athletic in
structors as well as presidents
and cabinet secretaries.
Last fall I he fans got a squint of
what Dud DeGroot could do to a
hunch of green football aspirants.
DeGroot, it will be remembered,
used to do a lot of mighty fine
gridiron cavorting on the Farm
himself. In fact, he was good
enough to make all-coast center.
Now Mr. DeGroot is athletic direc
tor at Menlo J.C. find his record
to date has been quite equal to his
college reputation.
Last Friday night the local
spectators were treated by an
other look at what a Stanford
athlete of a few years gone by
can do in the line of coaching.
Ted Shipkey, who used to star
at snagging passes, tossing
javelins, and looping baskets
between classes, brought down
a quintet from Sacramento J.C.
to play the Frosh. Shipkey, it
seems, can instruct as well as
he could play, for his players
handsomely trounced the Card
Babes. It is also interesting to
note that his J.C. football team
won the championship of its
class in California.
Tonight the students will get
their third glimpse of a team |
coached by a former Redshirt, j
when the College of Pacific five in- ,
vades the campus. Coach Swede !
