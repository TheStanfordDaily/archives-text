(Continued from page one)
the aircraft carrier is in itself a
defensive arm of the fleet., deriving
its own defense from anti-aircraft
guns and much smaller weapons
than were placed upon America's
two largest carriers, the Lexington
and the Saratoga.
The writers of the Washington
Treaty themselves anticipated
changes in theories surrounding
the use of capital ships and air
plane carriers, and provided in the
treaty for consultations among the
interested powers over such ques
tions as the airplane carrier pro
vides.
Japan's Aid Hoped
Japan is expected to be a sup
porter of a proposal to reduce the
limits of the aircraft carrier. For
mer Premier Roijiro Wakatsuki,
chief Japanese delegate to the par
ley, said in an interview shortly
after leaving Washington—where
he had conferred with American
officials preparatory to the confer
ence —that it was the view of the
Tokio government that the limits
of aircraft carriers should be re
duced below the figures set at the
Washington Conference.
While there has been no public
detailed expression of the attitude
at the Conference as a result of
any changes in technical theories
with regard to aircraft carriers,
Secretary Stimson will have with
him at the conference Rear Ad
miral William A. Moffett, Chief
of the Bureau of Aeronautics of
the Navy, who will act as adviser
on aeronautical subjects.
