# SOUTH EUROPE PACT IS UNDER CONSIDERATION
## Treaty To Be Composed of Non Agression And Mutual Guarantees Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain Are Interested And Affected Powers 
### 
PARIS. Jan. 7. (/P) —Representa-
tives of the interested governments
were tonight engaged in drafting a
Mediterranean pact of non aggres
sion and mutual guarantees that
will be submitted to the London
Naval Conference and is expected
to swing the conference on the
road to success.
Spain is vitally interested in the
pact and will be constantly con
sulted about its provisions. France
and Italy, of course, are the pow
ers chiefly interested, with Great
Britain scarcely less so because of
her need for keeping open the Im
perial Trade Route to the East
through the Suez Canal.
The importance that France and
other powers ascribe to the Medi
terranean Pact may necessitate in
viting Spain to the London confer
ence, at least for the political as
pects touching the pact.
Plans at present call for a pact
that will bo less rigid than the
Locarno accord, which guarantees
peace on (he Rhine, and somewhat
more precise and stronger than the
four-power pact negotiated at the
Washington Naval Conference 10
ensure peace on the Pacific Ocean
between the United States, Britain,
Japan, and France.
The Locarno accord provides
that Great Britain and Italy shall
become guarantors of peace on the
Rhine and that in case of unpro
voked aggression by either Ger
many or France they should come
to the assistance of the nation at
tacked.
The Mediterranean pact as it now
is conceived, apparently in a man
ner that satisfies French desires,
omits the naming of specific guar
antors and makes the guarantees
reciprocal for all signatories.
The signers of the Pacific pact,
which was created as a substitute
for the Anglo-Japanese alliance, un
dertook to respect one another's
rights on insular possessions and
dominions in the Pacific. If diffi
< ulties arise, the pact provides for
the calling of a conference.
It is understood in Paris that
an effort will be made to make
the Mediterranean pact more defi
nite about the measures to be
adopted if peace seems menaced
in the Mediterranean.
