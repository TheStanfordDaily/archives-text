# OFFICER BECOMES PLAYFUL; INVENTS NEW "TAG" GAME
## 
### 
Yesterday was "Tag Day"
on the Campus and fifty stu
dents were "IT." Tall people
and short ones, skinny people
and fat ones; the tags were
no respecters of persons.
Intense and sustained sleuth
ing revealed that the tags had
been donated by none other
than the bland and smiling
traffic officer, John (Law) 01-
sen. At the "Cliem" building
there were not enough tags
to go around and more had to
be requisitioned to make the
party a success.
New traffic rules and regu
lations, installed while the
Farm was deserted over the
holidays, are what put the
party in pay dirt.
