# CARDINAL CAGEMEN SWAMP PACIFIC QUINTET, 55 TO 23
## Redshirts Record High Scoring Mark for a Stanford Team in Basket-Shooting Orgy; Fawcett, McCandless Lead Brilliant Attack 
### STEPHEN DIETRICH 
OILING up more points than ever h
ball team, Coach Husky Hunt's
College of Pacific's defense last nigh
of 55 to 23. The highest previous
Cards swamped Waseda University.
With Vance Fawcett as key man
half, Stanford rang up baskets at w
hoop time after time. The Pacific <
smooth-working Card teamwork, as

iet'ore scored by a Stanford basket
fast-clicking five broke through
t in the Pavilion to win by a score
total was made in '28, when the
to nearly every play in the first
'ill, working the ball in under the
iefense seemed bewildered by the
a consequence of which Jolinnv
McCandiess tapped in one sucker
shot after another for a total of
nine baskets and eighteen tallies.
Tigers' Tricks Fail
As for offense, the Tigers' sup
posedly tricky criss-cross attack
failed to work at all. The entire
Pacific team was too busy at all
times in trying to stop the Red
shirts from running up points. The
only baskets made by the visiting
five were from well out on the
court, with the exception of a tip-in
shot by Odale, lanky "Tiger center,
in the first couple of minutes of
play.
Besides McCandiess' performance
the other outstanding offensive
feature was the comeback of Red
Berg, who had his first really hoi
night of the season and was runner
up to the Card pivot man with
eleven points. Berg sank two of
the hardest shots seen 011 the local
floor this year, one of them swish
ing through the bucket with the
flashy redhead standing just inside
the court in one of the corners.
Rothert Stars
Despite a bandaged loot, Captain
Harlow Rothert stood out on de
fense, as well as finding the bas
ket for six markers. And although
towered over by both of the Pacific
centers, Odale and Disbrow, the
Card captain was able to get the
jump a good part of the evening.
Rowley, Rothert's running mate at
guard, also proved to be a sticker
on defense, and contributed three
baskets to the Card total.
After holding Stanford on prac
tically even terms for the first five
minutes of play, the Pacific live
wilted and from then on it. was
only a matter of how large the
score would be. With the score
reading 14 to 9 in favor of the
home team, the Redshirts got
going, alternating shots by Mc-
Candiess and Berg to pile up twen
ty-one pointy in a row. The score
at half time was Stanford 33,
Pacific 9.
Fawcett Leads Attack
Although not figuring much as
far as ringing baskets went, scor
ing only five points, Fawcett was
largely responsible for the Cards'
showing. Playing a cool, heady
game, the veteran forward was all
over the hardwood, piercing the
Tiger defense with clover dribbling
or bullet-like passes to McCandiess
in the hole. Fawcett proved to be
the main cog in Hunt's "stalling
game," which worked to perfection
in sucking Pacific's defense out of
position.
For the first, time in several
years, the Cardinal quintet sank
free throws with regularity. In the
first period, the red and white play
ers made all five of their foul shots,
while in the last half they were
able to connect with five out of
seven.
Ragged Finish
Starting out to be a repetition
of the opening period, the game
degenerated into a fumble fest in
the closing minutes of play, after
McCandiess and Rowley were
ejected on I'ouls. With the two regu
lars on tlie sidelines, the Cards'
floorwork became ragged, while at
the same time Coach Swede
Righter's men took heart and lo
(ated the ring a couple of times
from out near center to bring their
final total of twenty-three points.

five were from well out on the
court, with the exception of a tip-in
shot by Odale, lanky "Tiger center,
in the first couple of minutes of
play.
Besides McCandiess' performance
the other outstanding offensive
feature was the comeback of Red
Berg, who had his first really hoi
night of the season and was runner
up to the Card pivot man with
eleven points. Berg sank two of
the hardest shots seen 011 the local
floor this year, one of them swish
ing through the bucket with the
flashy redhead standing just inside
the court in one of the corners.
Rothert Stars
Despite a bandaged loot, Captain
Harlow Rothert stood out on de
fense, as well as finding the bas
ket for six markers. And although
towered over by both of the Pacific
centers, Odale and Disbrow, the
Card captain was able to get the
jump a good part of the evening.
Rowley, Rothert's running mate at
guard, also proved to be a sticker
on defense, and contributed three
baskets to the Card total.
After holding Stanford on prac
tically even terms for the first five
minutes of play, the Pacific live
wilted and from then on it. was
only a matter of how large the
score would be. With the score
reading 14 to 9 in favor of the
home team, the Redshirts got
going, alternating shots by Mc-
Candiess and Berg to pile up twen
ty-one pointy in a row. The score
at half time was Stanford 33,
Pacific 9.
Fawcett Leads Attack
Although not figuring much as
far as ringing baskets went, scor
ing only five points, Fawcett was
largely responsible for the Cards'
showing. Playing a cool, heady
game, the veteran forward was all
over the hardwood, piercing the
Tiger defense with clover dribbling
or bullet-like passes to McCandiess
in the hole. Fawcett proved to be
the main cog in Hunt's "stalling
game," which worked to perfection
in sucking Pacific's defense out of
position.
For the first, time in several
years, the Cardinal quintet sank
free throws with regularity. In the
first period, the red and white play
ers made all five of their foul shots,
while in the last half they were
able to connect with five out of
seven.
Ragged Finish
Starting out to be a repetition
of the opening period, the game
degenerated into a fumble fest in
the closing minutes of play, after
McCandiess and Rowley were
ejected on I'ouls. With the two regu
lars on tlie sidelines, the Cards'
floorwork became ragged, while at
the same time Coach Swede
Righter's men took heart and lo
(ated the ring a couple of times
from out near center to bring their
final total of twenty-three points.

reading 14 to 9 in favor of the
home team, the Redshirts got
going, alternating shots by Mc-
Candiess and Berg to pile up twen
ty-one pointy in a row. The score
at half time was Stanford 33,
Pacific 9.
Fawcett Leads Attack
Although not figuring much as
far as ringing baskets went, scor
ing only five points, Fawcett was
largely responsible for the Cards'
showing. Playing a cool, heady
game, the veteran forward was all
over the hardwood, piercing the
Tiger defense with clover dribbling
or bullet-like passes to McCandiess
in the hole. Fawcett proved to be
the main cog in Hunt's "stalling
game," which worked to perfection
in sucking Pacific's defense out of
position.
For the first, time in several
years, the Cardinal quintet sank
free throws with regularity. In the
first period, the red and white play
ers made all five of their foul shots,
while in the last half they were
able to connect with five out of
seven.
Ragged Finish
Starting out to be a repetition
of the opening period, the game
degenerated into a fumble fest in
the closing minutes of play, after
McCandiess and Rowley were
ejected on I'ouls. With the two regu
lars on tlie sidelines, the Cards'
floorwork became ragged, while at
the same time Coach Swede
Righter's men took heart and lo
(ated the ring a couple of times
from out near center to bring their
final total of twenty-three points.

Tigers' Tricks Fail
As for offense, the Tigers' sup
posedly tricky criss-cross attack
failed to work at all. The entire
Pacific team was too busy at all
times in trying to stop the Red
shirts from running up points. The
only baskets made by the visiting
five were from well out on the
court, with the exception of a tip-in
shot by Odale, lanky "Tiger center,
in the first couple of minutes of
play.
Besides McCandiess' performance
the other outstanding offensive
feature was the comeback of Red
Berg, who had his first really hoi
night of the season and was runner
up to the Card pivot man with
eleven points. Berg sank two of
the hardest shots seen 011 the local

flashy redhead standing just inside

towered over by both of the Pacific
centers, Odale and Disbrow, the
Card captain was able to get the
jump a good part of the evening.
Rowley, Rothert's running mate at

baskets to the Card total.
