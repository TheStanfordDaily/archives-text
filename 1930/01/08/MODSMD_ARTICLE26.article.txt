# DEC. 28 TOO LATE FOR POST SEASON GAME SAYS "TINY"
## 
### 
Stanford will probably never play
another football game as late in
the season as the West Point Army
game this year, which was played
on December 28. This was the state
ment, made by Line Coach Claude
E. ("Tiny") Thornhill in a talk be
fore the Palo Alto Kiwanis Club j
yesterday. He declared that it is :
too difficult to keep the men on j
edge for so long after the close of '
the regular season.
Thornhill asserted that the Stan-1
ford coaching staff never had any
doubts about the outcome of the
Army contest this year.
"Last year when we went East,"
he said, "we didn't know how it
would come out. But this year we
knew Stanford would win."
Man for man, Western players ;
are slightly superior to those of
the East, Thornhill believes, but ;
the real Western edge is in tlie :
team play which is made possible j
by the fact that California weather j
allows a wide variety of plays.
"Tiny" complimented "Chuck" j
Smalling whom he called a real all- ;
American who missed recognition j
because he is from the West.
