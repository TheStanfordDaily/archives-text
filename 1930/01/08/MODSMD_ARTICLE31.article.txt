# PROFESSIONAL EGOISM

### 
Youth and maturity have always found it hard to understand
each other. Since the beginning of time youth has been impatient
with age and age lias been distrustful of youth. Perhaps that is
whv it is difficult for the collegian to understand the workings of
the faculty mind.
At any rate, the actions of certain Stanford professors with
reference to their work and their students is completely baffling
to those who have crime to this institution as seekers after
knowledge.
It is hard, for instance, to understand the man who is so
enamoured with his own fund of knowledge and his capabilities
as a disseminator of learning that he will lay down an inviolate
no-cut rule. The professor who takes such action implies that his
lectures are so valuable that no student can afford to miss any oi x
them. If the student succeeds in passing his examinations without
attending every class meeting, it makes no difference. The divine
inspiration and the pearls of wisdom which rolled from the peda
gogical lips have been missed : the student has failed —both figura
tively and literally.
To be more specific, a certain student took a certain course
last quarter from a certain professor. The certain student received
"C" grade in the midquartcr examination and a "I»" in the final.
That combination, according to all the just laws of man and (iod,
should have netted at least a "t " plus grade. l>ut no, the certain
student had taken advantage of the unwritten custom of this in
stitution and had "cut" the live-hour course five times. Ile had
offended the dignity of his superior, lie had not carefully grasped
each precious bit of knowledge which had dropped from teacher's
droning tongue. So that certain student was failed in the course—
failed with a "C" plus in the midquartcr and a *T>" in the final.
If that professor should chance to read these words and deign
to rcplv at all, he will say. of course, that one so close to "flunking"
should have been more careful about his attendance record, lie
will justify his action on all the grounds of scholarship, education,
and what not.
I>ut it all simmers down to one thing—a queer, cruel, egoistic
complex. And such complexes are a drag on American educational
] rogress.
