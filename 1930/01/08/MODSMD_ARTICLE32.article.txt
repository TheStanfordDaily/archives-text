# FOG SHROUDED POLITICS
## 
### 
San Francisco is the cosmopolitan city of the world. With its
building-studded heights shrouded in fog and the cheery friendli
ness of its inhabitants, the city by the (iolden (late is the mecca of
all. In the summer months it boasts of the low temperature of 52
degrees and it is sloganed as a city possessing a warm winter cli
mate. I'ntortunately, San Francisco can point only with ambigu
ous pride to its politics and the board of directors—the super
visors.
As a result of a heated election—warm, at least, for the candi
dates. but more than apathetic on the part of the registered voters —
there was selected what was termed a progressive Hoard of Super
visors. This bodv went into office Monday and six members of the
old board went out. And before they went some of these men. who
had been appointed as the city's official representatives to the Pasa
dena New Year's Day Tournament of Roses celebration, returned
such money as tliev had appropriated to pay their expense to the
southern fete. r This "expense money" was to pay the bills for hotel
lodging, food, and entertainment.
The members of the San Francisco junket were publicly told
that their appropriation of civic money savored of graft. And the
retiring supervisors returned the unused portion of their "expense
money'' and promised to make an accounting for the expenditure
of their appropriations. It was an example of the present day poli
tician's fear of public redress upon him and illustrated the progress
i>f politics from the day when the grafting boss would have said
"the public be damned." lie would have never returned the funds.
San Francisco's task for the present is to construct its political
M'heuie to the highest peak of idealism of political science. I'ntil
that is accomplished this ultra-cosmopolitan city will fall far short
o.f progress.
