THE STRAY LAMB, By Thorne
Smith. Cosmopolitan Publish
ing Co., 1929.
Being a modern fairytale, ainus
. ing the reader to the point of fre
quent laughter with its cleverly
written and shockingly frank chat
ter. Tiie stray lamb is Mr. Lamb,
a wealthy New Yorker, unhappily
married, who suddenly turns into
a horse one day, then a seagull, a
goldfish, a lion —all rather discon
certing, but you can picture what
tun he lias. E.g., Mr. Lamb-horse
'gleefully turns the cold shower on
his hated brother-in-law, screaming
a most awful horse-cry through the
shower curtains at him. Then the
refractory beast, imbibing too
much, gjn before tlie horse show,
does a clog while being judged, and
passes out cold on the track. Smith
has a keen sense of the ridiculous
i —Mr. Lit nib, reduced to a seagull,
| manfully says, "1 haven't come to
that. Damned if I'll bully pigeons
yet."
The best thing to be said about
this book is that, sluiced along in
gulps of gin, il never lags to be
j come dull. —W. H. G.

THE HOLLYWOOD RFVUE OF
1929 —New Stanford Theatre.
Loud trumpets and rolling drums!
Here? is Mctro-Goldwyn-Muyer's big

] splash for the year, a gala extrava
ganza featuring "more movie stars
than ever before assembled" for a
I motion picture, and other press
agentry. For the most part, it is a
big bore. A hodge-podge of adagio
ballets, trick photography, and
mastering of ceremonies is thrown
together for the crowded theatres
full of cash customers.
| There are some very high spots
| in the long unwinding*, especially
in Laurel and Hardy's comedy,
Joan Crawford's singing, Buster
Keaton's dance, and Jack Benny's
introductions. But then they turn
on Charley King "putting over" a
cheap mother ballad, and give you
long and tiresome dance routines
in ridiculous costumes until you
begin to squirm in the seat and
look at the ceiling decorations.
The show introduces several
! tunes which are rapidly approach
ing old age at .this point. T.he .sing
ing-in-the-rain finale is well-staged
and leaves a good impression. Cliff
Edwards shows up well, atfld there
is some low and funny comedy with
Polly Moran and. Marie Dressier.
John Gilbert and. Norma Shearer
do a technicolor interpretation of
th" famed Shakespeare balcony
scene. The whole show is a mix
ture of good and bad, and you will
j probably go anyway. —J. T.

THE STRAY LAMB, By Thorne
Smith. Cosmopolitan Publish

Being a modern fairytale, ainus
. ing the reader to the point of fre
quent laughter with its cleverly
written and shockingly frank chat
ter. Tiie stray lamb is Mr. Lamb,
a wealthy New Yorker, unhappily
married, who suddenly turns into
a horse one day, then a seagull, a
goldfish, a lion —all rather discon
certing, but you can picture what
tun he lias. E.g., Mr. Lamb-horse
'gleefully turns the cold shower on
his hated brother-in-law, screaming
a most awful horse-cry through the
shower curtains at him. Then the
refractory beast, imbibing too
much, gjn before tlie horse show,
does a clog while being judged, and
passes out cold on the track. Smith
has a keen sense of the ridiculous
i —Mr. Lit nib, reduced to a seagull,
| manfully says, "1 haven't come to
that. Damned if I'll bully pigeons
yet."
The best thing to be said about
this book is that, sluiced along in
gulps of gin, il never lags to be
j come dull. —W. H. G.
