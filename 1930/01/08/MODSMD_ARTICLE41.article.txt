# RACIAL RELATIONS GREATLY INFLUENCED BY NEWSPAPERS, PROFESSOR REYNOLDS
## Stanford Researcher Discloses Results of Work on Anti-Oriental Topic in Santa Clara County 
### Theodore DeMotte 
"Through the subjective mind of
the reporter, news of Orientals in
this country is brought to the pub
lic in such a way that it has much
influence on Oriental-White race
relations." Assistant Professor C.
X. Reynolds of the Economics de
partment was d'iscfissing' a paper
which he submitted to the recent
annual meeting of the American
Sociological Society held at Wash
ington, D.C.
Newspaper â€¢ Research
Professor Reynolds conducted a
research of a Santa Clara county
newspaper's files for two periods,
one running from 187)1 to 1882,
when the anti-Chinese agitation in
California was at a high point, and
the other from 1912 to 1924, when
anti-Japanese sentiment was at its
height. Santa Clara county was se
lected as a representative area in
considering the Oriental problem.
During the research, some 30,000
column-inches of material were
considered in finding how news
paper articles affect the growth of
racial attitudes and behavior when
races are in contact.
Contact between whites and Chi
nese and later between whites and
Japanese appear, as shbwn in the
newspaper research, to follow
parallel lines with fairly well-de
fined stages. Each stage had its ac
companying racial attitudes. The
races came in contact as a result,

largely, of economic forces.
The invaders met some need
which encouraged their coming,
and in meeting it were welcomed
for a time. This period of good feel
ing gave way to a period of compe
tition, with attitudes of growing
hostility, fear, and distrust as a
consciousness of a laboring class
with low standards of living de
veloped.
Riots And Bloodshed
Next come a stage of conflict,
with the native stock on the of
fensive and the invaders on the
defensive. Legislative discrimina
tion was mixed with riot and blood
shed. In tiie case of both the Japa
nese and the Chinese, the conflict
stage was accompanied by a crys
tallized race prejudice where the
invaders were not looked upon as
individuals, but as an undesirable
class. The conflict stage in both
these cases forced a tentative so
lution of exclusion.
The invaders then learned that (
there were narrow limits within
which they might operate, and
found that it paid to keep within
those limits. Gradual adjustment
and better understanding ensued.
The parallel behavior of the
races in contact, as shown by the
news record in this study, adds
weight to the conclusion that, ail
interaction between races, after a
transplanting process, leads to be
havior paTterns that follow rather
well-defined lines.
