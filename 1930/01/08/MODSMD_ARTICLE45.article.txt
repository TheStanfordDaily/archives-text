## TO BE OR NOT TO BE!

Whether Stanford will have a
championship football eleven this
year, or merely another good team
may he decided today, when the
letter men on the '2'j gridiron ma
chine gather round the festive
board at the Phi Pelt house this
noon to elect a football captain for
1930.
Although an article about
the election appeared in yes
terday's Daily written up in
the news style of a society
note, the luncheon will be
much more than a tea party.
For after gulping down a few
groceries, the players will pro
ceed to cast ballots with the
greatest of solemnity and judg
ment.
At. least they should, for a suc
cessful team must have a good
leader." Very seldom does one find
a champ squad led by a second
rate player, either in tlie matter of
handling himself on the field or
in personality. A team must have
Inspiration. That's why captains
are elected.
Too frequently just the op
posite is true. Petty politics,
personal prejudices, and self
interest combine to make the
captaincy election a farce.
The team literally becomes en
tangled in tile meshes of politics,
with all of its evils to boot.
Cliques are formed. Bartering of
"votes goes on, while prejudices de
velop into malice. And it isn't long
before some player belonging to a
certain clan is railroaded into of
fice.
So when the next season rolls
around, dissension among the play
ers sets in. The only inspiration
the players have is to fight among
themselves. And another good team
becomes a muchly-kicked-about
ham-and-egg outfit.
Stanford can well profit from
her own past experiences in
this respect. Not so long ago,
a certain young fellow was rail
roaded into the coveted posi
tion. The chap was not a bad
sort, knocked the women dead
with his sex-appeal, and was
engaged in all kinds of outside
activities. He also played foot
ball—during his spare hours.
When the next pigskin cam
paign got under way, this cer
tain player would have been
adorning the bench a good deal
of the time if he had not been
captain.
But being head man, he played
on week after week. And once more
Stanford had just another good
team, although less politics and
more discretion on election day
would have landed the Cardinal
eleven in the role of national
champs.
At the close of 1928 the Red
shirts must have used the rar
est sort of judgment when they
chose Mush Muller as leader.
Muller's record for the season
just ended speaks for itself.
Besides playing an outstanding
game at end, snagging passes
with the best of them, and call
ing signals, he instilled all
kinds of pep and fight into the
other ten white-jerseyed stal
warts on the field.
As a consequence, the Card foot

ball machine of 1929, over whose
chances Pop spent many a sleep
less night at the beginning of the
season and, later on, scattered car
loads of cigarette ashes about the
practice field, and which was con
siderably handicapped all season
with numerous injuries, battled its
way through a quite successful
campaign.
The Daily joins the rest of
the student body in eagerly
awaiting the result of today's
election. It hopes the house
fathers furnish enough edibles,
so that the players stuff them
selves and not the ballots. And
it hopes for another leader of
Muller caliber!
