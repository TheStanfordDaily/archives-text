# Card Frosh Swamp Tigers, 32-13
## PACIFIC KITTENS DOWNED BY FAST "BABE" DFFENSE Cards Hold Opponents To Second Half Without Goal From Field 
### Don Oswill 
Holding the College of Pacific
freshmen without a single field goal
during the entire second half of
their game played at the Pavilion
last night, Stanford's pearling bas
ketball team easily defeated the
Tiger Kittens by a score of .12 to
13. At half time the baby Redshirts
were leading 15 to 11.
During the first period the play
was fairly even, the Cards having
a. slight edge due to their superior
passing and floorwork. Pacific start
ed'the Scoring when Mor'yania,
Tiger - forward, sunk a couple of
long field goals for a four-point
lead. .However, this advantage was
not, held long as Meade and Han
cock, forward and guard on the
Stanford team, evened up the count
with two short tosses.
The fast floorwork displayed by
the Cardinal I'rosU in the second
half completely bewildered their
opponents, while the shooting of
Hancock, Meade, and Palmer gave
them a substantial lead. Coach
Jimmy Bradshaw's charges had lit
tle trouble solving the Pacific of
fense, the latter being forced to
shoot from far out in the court
and with little success.
Paul Hancock, former Stockton
high school star and now running
guard on the Card first-year team,
was high-point man of the contest,
sinking seven field goals and one
free throw for a total of fifteen
points. Besides being responsible
for nearly half the digits amassed
by the Stanford frosh, he played a
steady defensive game, effectively
stopping the Tiger forwards and
retrieving the ball with ease from
the backboard.
The fine work of the regular
Card forwards, Meade and Palmer,
was overshadowed by the playing

of Tom Cordry, a substitute.'
Cordry entered the game in the
middle of the first half and dis
played some of the flashiest floor
work seen during the contest, be
sides looping in a couple of pretty
field goals.
For the losers, Moryama, small
Japanese forward, and Hill, huge
standing guard, were the outstand
ing players. The former was easily
the best shot on the Stockton team,
while Hill was the only man capa
ble of halting the Card offense.
Apparently the workout on the
foul line which Coach Bradshaw
has concentrated upon during the
last week's practice has had some
good effect on the members of tlie
Card quintet. In their last contest,
played against Sacramento Junior
College, the Cards failed to sink a
single free throw, but last night
they almost completely reversed
that performance, missing only two
throws in the first half and sink
ing a large majority of those at
tempted in the second period.
