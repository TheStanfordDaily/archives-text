# PARTS VARIED IN NEXT PLAY
## Vallejo Gantner To Have Woman-Hater Role 
### 
Variety of charm, as well as num
ber, characterizes the group of
suitors for the hand of Mirando
lina, the mistress of the inn, to be
played by Ruth Beede, in Carlo
Goldoni's classic comedy of that
name, which will be given here
under (he direction of Harold Ib'l
venston, acting director of dra
matics, on February 7.
Of all the guests at Mirando
lina's tavern, one of the most
amusing of those who are in love
with (he (harming hostess is tiie
Marquis of Forlipopoli, to be
played by Arthur Hurt. The Mar
quis, who has noble lineage but
little financial backing for it, is an
ardent suitor of Mirandolina's, be
lieving himself throughout ex
tremely generous in offering her
his "protection."
The Count of Albafiorita, on the
other hand, offers the mistress of
the inn costly gifts and large hills.
His competition against (he Mar
quis produces vast, results for
Mirandolina in the way of jewels
and other trifles. The part of this
welcome nobleman Avill be played
by Edward W. Field, who appeared
in "The Makroponlos Secret" here
this summer.
Diametrically opposed to both of
these amorous gentlemen is the
Cavalier of Ripafratta, a brusque,
severe fellow who swears himself
a "woman-hater." Vallejo Gantner,
new to the campus, will do this
part, which carries with it excel
lent opportunities of character de
velopment and the portrayal of
conflicting elements within the
character.
Fabrizio, an Italian servant at
the inn, and the Cavalier's person
al attendant, like the rest of the
men who come within the sphere
of Mirandolina's more or less un
aware fascination, are also to be
numbered among the admirers of
La Locandiera, or the mistress of
the inn, and are naively charming
in themselves.
