## Remaining Stanford Court Men Contending For Ranking Position 
### 
"Although John Doeg's decision i
not to return to Stanford this year j
means a great, loss to tennis here, j
there will be a keener spirit of ,
competitive ranking among those j
players remaining than was pres- ,
ent. heretofore," stated Elwyn '
Bugge, tennis instructor, yesterday, [
when questioned concerning Stan- I
ford's prospects in the net sport !
for 1930.
Five players, Hall, Easton, Dris- j
coll, Plymire, and Weesner, all i
seem to he about on a par in play- |
ing ability at. present, according to j
Bugge, and t lie absence of Doeg, I
who topped the list by a safe mar- I
gin, will sharpen the competition I
between these stars.
