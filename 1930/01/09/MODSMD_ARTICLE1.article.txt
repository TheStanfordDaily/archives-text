# DELEGATES TO DEBT COUNCIL NEAR DECISION
## Tardieu, French Premier, Displays Hope of Final Agreement Next Week Arrangement of German Reparations Schedule Is Yet To Be Considered 
### 
TIIK II \GI'K, Netherlands, Jan. Hj
(/P). Premier Tardieu, chief of the |
l'i 'lieh delegation to the second rcpa- j
rations i tiferencc, said tonight that j
tlir members oi the delegations still ;
hope I to ei'd their work by the begin- j
ning of next week.
latere remain several questions in- j
eluding that of sanctions, or measures i
he taken in the event that Germany j
.should default in her payments, and j
the date of the payment of monthly j
instalments on the reparations account.
These questions, however, are being j
worked upon constantly and it is ex
pected they will be ready for hnal de
cision before Wednesday next.
The, French delegation today sent
In the Germans a document summing
up the negotiations thus far with a
summary of the I'rench arguments
concerning sanctions. It is understood
tin French have entirely abandoned
the idea of a military reoccupation of
German territory in case of a German
default and have proposed a system of
reference's to intermediaries, linally
noing to the international court in case
;i dee is inn cannot tie obtained else
where.
The question of commercialization \
oi tli" unconditional annuities is be- i
ineoiisidered in private conversations
concerning which the delegates have
observed the greatest discretion; nev
ertheless there is reason to believe that
this que- tif hi will not come to a head
until after Jackson Reynolds, M. A.
Tiavlor, l)r. Iljahuar Schacht, and j
the other bankers who drew up the
|i|;ni for the international bank have
i onferred here beginning Monday. |
Premier Tardieu is going to Paris
in any case Tuesday next for the
reupening of parliament. His subse
quent movements will depend on de
velopments. He is supposed to meet'
Secretary of Stale Stimson before the
London conference, but final details
remain to be fixed.
There was somewhat of a flurry in
conference circles today between the
French and German delegations. Pre
mier Tardieu in a declaration to the
I rench press last evening repeated
what he had said at a meeting to the
effect that the Germans, by raising
repeated objections on account of the
difficulty of getting their decisions ap
proved in Uerlin, had showed a lack
ni confidence in themselves, and asked
how they in consequence could ask
their creditors to have confidence in
them. â€¢
This declaration was spread around
in distorted versions and provoked a
demand by the German delegation for
an explanation. The situation was
quickly cleared up when this was
given.
