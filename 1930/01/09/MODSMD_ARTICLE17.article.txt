# HAITIAN ACTION ADVOCATED BY IDAHO SENATOR
## Borah Seeks Commissioner, Free Election, For West Indians Foreign Relations Head Hits Military Rule 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 8 (/P).
Chairman Borah of the Senate for
eign relations committee today advo
cated immediate action in Haiti by
President Hoover as the committee
began consideration of the President's
request for a commission of investi
gation.
Appointment of a civilian as high
commissioner for Haiti and authority
for a "free and untrammeled election"
were proposed by Senator Borah in a
statement issued after the committee
failed to reach a decision on the House
resolution authorizing an investigating
commission.
Hits Military Rule
Borah severely condemned military
rule of the Haitians. He offered no
objection to the commission asked by
the President, and said the absence of
several members had precluded com
mittee action on the resolution. He
predicted an early report, "But 1 feel
that something ought to be done with
out waiting for the report of a com
mission," said the Idahoan. "We
should appoint a civilian as high com
missioner or as governor —for that is
what it is—of Haiti.
"Second, we should give the Haitian
people a free and untrammeled elec
tion, At this election they should be
permitted to vote for members of their
congress, and then the congrcss should
be permitted, as is provided by the
constitution, to elect their president."
