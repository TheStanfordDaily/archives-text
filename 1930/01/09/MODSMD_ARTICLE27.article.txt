# Plate, Musante To Have Parts In New Campus Production
## 
### 
Phoebe Plate and Catherine Mu
sante were cast last night by Har
old Helvenston, acting director of
i dramatics, in the parts ot' Ortensia
J and Deianira, the two actresses in
I Carlo Goldoni's serious comedy,
i"The Mistress of the Inn," to be
: done here in February.
Both parts are flashy, rather rau
: cous ones full of boisterous comedy
and by-play. Deisianira is the pliilo
i sopher of the two, being more lion
i est and conscientious than her com
' pan ion comedienne. The elegant
! verbiage of this actress, who intro
! duces herself as "The Countess
| Deianira dal Sole, from Rome," is
one of the most comic elements of
tli is thoroughly amusing play.
Catherine Musante is doing the
part of this loud young actress.
| This production will be her debut
[ in campus dramatics.
Deianira More Raucous
More enterprising and perhaps
! more raucous than Deianara, Orten
! sia is the manager of all the pro
| jects undertaken by the comic pair
of actresses. Even more of a flirt
I than her fellow comedienne, and
i more of a jokester, she makes the
: decisions for the pair, makes the
, plans, and nuinages the campaigns,
i No qualms, no shyness has she as
j she announces herself with many
j flourishes as "The Baroness Orten
i sia del Poggio. from Palermo," and
! with delightfully vulgar assurance,
j she baroness-es through the play.
Ruth Beede, as Mirandolina, the
1 mistress of the inn, is taking the
j only other woman's part. Other
i roles will be taken by Arthur Hurt,
j Vallejo Gantner, Edward Field, and
j Gaillard Fryer. The part of Fabri
! zio, the Italian servant of the inn,
i lias not yet been cast, according to
i Helvenston, but will be announced
j very soon.
