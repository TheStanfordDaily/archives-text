# RAY TANDY TO LEAD VARSITY FOOTBALL TEAM NEXT YEAR
## Rangy Tackle Has Played Two Years; Smalling Receives "Pop" Warner Most Valuable Player Award; Coach Pleased With Team's Choice 
### BY STEPHEN DIETRICH 
j DAY ELMER. TANDY, '29, was unanimously elected football captain
! for 1930, and Charles O. Smalling, '29, was awarded the Olenn S.
| "Pop" Warner perpetual trophy for the most valuable player yesterday
| noon during a meeting of varsity lettermen at the Phi Dell house.
Playing his second year on the Stanford varsity during the grid
j season just closed, Tandy, a member of El Campo and registered from
I Alta Loma, was a tower of strength at right tackle. The rangy linesman
| was especially effective on defense, and no team was able to budge him
i out of position for consistent gains.
When the pigskin campaign got under way two years ago, Tandy was
i rated as a substitute with mere possibilities. Yet, by the time the
j Big Game rolled around, he was running neck and neck with Tiny
Sellman for a berth on the regular team. Tandy got off to a good start

last fall and played a consistent
game week after week.
Although not a flashy performer,
and failing to receive a place on
mythical all-Coast elevens, Tandy
was recognized by opposing squads
as one of the toughest linesmen
on the Pacific slopes. In fact, every
team, meeting Stanford in 1929,
saw fit to place him on its all
opponent selection.
Pop Pleased
Besides playing outstanding ball,
the new captain is well-liked by his
fellow players, is smart in diagnos
ing other team's plays, and is cool
and steady under all conditions.
Coach Pop Warner is more than
pleased by the team's selection
and believes that Tandy is well
qualified to replace Mush Muller
as leader. In speaking of the out
going captain, Pop said: "Mush
Muller is one of the greatest cap
tains that ever played for me."
Smalling Chosen
In making the Glenn S. "Pop"
Warner award, a $250 watch, the
committee chosen by President
Ray Lyman Wilbur and consisting
of Coach Robert "Dink" Templeton,
Bill Owens, faculty member of the
8.A.C., and Jack McDowell, alumni
secretary, chose Smalling by an
unanimous decision.
Smalling's record speaks for it
self, the plunging fullback being
one of the steadiest players on the
Card squad for the past three
years. Overlooked by the critics in
their all-star selections, Smalling,
a Phi Delt registered from Tem
pleton, closed his career on Dec. 28
by running West Point ragged. It
was not until this game that
Smalling received his due recogni
tion, being acclaimed by the Army
men as the best line-plunger they
had ever seen in action.
Honors Warner
The award is a perpetual trophy
in honor of Pop Warner, the gift
ol an anonymous alumni donor. It,
was made for the first time last
fall, when Bob Sims received a,
wrist watch. The committee liases
its decision on character and ath
letic ability of the men who have
played their last year on a Stan
ford varsity.
