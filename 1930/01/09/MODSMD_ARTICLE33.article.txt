the season of I'MO. «

driving, consistent play, along with his personal qualifications, makes

Another Cardinal gridman who was honored yesterday was
( liarles ("Chuck") Smalling, the smashing halfback, who received
the (ilenn S. ("I'op") Warner Annual Award. Smalling definitely
entered the ranks of the mighty this year when he pulverized the
