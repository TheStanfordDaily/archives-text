Stanford's famed 500 are recipients of more education than the
mere S ( W registration they paid last Thursday signifies. The women
receive, free, a complete course in the mystery-ridden and devious
way> of acquiring the proper type of a husband. Because a young
woman has the chance to mingle with prospective soul-mates on the
campus and observe them at their best and their worst, she will gain
the "experience necessary to her future enjoyment of life, is the
idea sent to American universities and colleges by Dr. Anna N . Reed,
professor of personnel administration in the School of Education at
New York l*niv£rsity.
Perhaps the Stanford women had better forget their recently ex
pressed ambitions to learn the ways and means of writing, teaching,
and drama as occupational interests and devote their time to imbibing
the higher type of learning available here in the subtle art of attract
ing a suitable mate. Stanford women haven't matriculated into the
liner arts of husband hunting as Dr. Reed would have it.
