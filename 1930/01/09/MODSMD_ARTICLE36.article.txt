The New York Bar Association lias announced that American
adherence to the World Court under the Root formula would not
involve this country in litigation without its consent.
To he sure, the finding is nothing original on the part of the New
York barristers. It has been vouched for previously on high official
and judicial authority. Ilut in spite of the reiteration of the an
nouncement and the widespread publication it has gained, two gen
tlemen of considerable publicity influence in the land seem not to
have heard of it vet. Thev are William Randolph Hearst and his
prolific editorial writer, Arthur Brisbane. Evidently those two gen
tlemen acquire all of their ideas about the World ( ourt from their
own writings only.â€”l'ulo ;\lto Times.
