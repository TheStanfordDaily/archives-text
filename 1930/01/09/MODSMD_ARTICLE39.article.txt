"A GALLERY OF WOMEN." By
Theodore Dreiser. (In Two
Volumes.) New York: Horace
Liveright. 1929.
In these two volumes, Dreiser
has treated with consummate skill
the careers of many women, lit'teen
of tliem, women real or imagined.
There is skill in this treatment of
Dreiser's; the characters of his
women are revealed with remark
able clarity, hut that revelation of
characteristics is accomplished by
means of diction that is so ponder
ous, so involved, so unreasonably
involved that one feels tit times as
(,ne would in readiug a very compe
tently written, bin unnecessarily
pedantic, scientific work. One for
gets that this is I lie work of a
popular novelist —for Dreiser is
popular, is lie not ?

Looking beyond such obstruc
tions to u clear vision of tlit* uu
thor's meaning, such obstructions
as frequent redundancies, as sen
tence structure always too com
plex, one observes at once that
Dreiser lias put before those who
would read him portraits of women,
drawn with great skill, touched
i even now and again witli a color,
' vivid and felicitous, a color applied
not merely by a master craftsman
1 in the trade, if you will, of letters,
hut hv one greater than any crafts
man — a geniurf.
Dreiser is not easy to read. He is
never a facile writer. But lie is
' well worth reading, even though
jt he reading of him becomes at
times difficult or tiresome. Dreiser
1 knows people well, and after read
ing him, you also will, in some de
l gree, know people—well. (i. N.
