# Officials Study Palm Drive Traffic Problem
## 
### 
Palo Altocity engineers are now
, studying traffic control devices for
possible use at the intersection of
Palm Drive and University Avenue
with El ('amino Real. Several types
of controls are being considered,
' among them ii sound box signal and
a tripping device which would hall
traffic on El ('amino Real to allow
cars to cross.
Since the highway is outside the
jurisdiction of both Stanford and
Palo Alto, although they are vitally
interested in the crossing, it lias
been suggested that the state, city,
and University co-operate in find
ing a solution of the problem.
