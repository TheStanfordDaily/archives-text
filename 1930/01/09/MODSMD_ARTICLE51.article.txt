NOT A GOOFY IDEA
ilthough the varsity hoop squad
I not hp seen in action on the
lie court for the next two weeks,
veling down to West wood to
et. the Bruins on Saturday and
sliing the gdtes of Troy on the
owing week-end in a Conference
ibje-header, there is not the
?htest. chance of the Pavilion
•dwood rotting away from dis
• before Husky Hunt brings his
udering boys back to the Farm.
For beginning tonight, when
•ight teams tangle to open the
30 mural season, the swish of
.onnected buckets and thud of
jouncing basketballs will echo
lightly for weeks to come
hrough the frigidaire-like sanc
itudes of the Pavilion, as well
is Encina Gym.
ncidentally, speaking of ice
xes, it is interesting to note that
cific, after its 55 to 23 drubbing
» other night, did not use tlie
hi so popular with 'the Eastern
ims invading the Coast. For
en the game ended, Coach Swede
gliter admitted that his players
1 not. wilt from the heat.
Getting back to intramural
mes, it, seems that each year
>re and more interest is taken in
is form of non-subsidized sport,
arting with a couple of half-or
nized teams a few years ago, in
unural basketball has grown by
ips and bounds into a quite com
icated affair. Today, the all-Uni
rsity organization is divided into
<ht leagues, each comprised of
c or more teams.
Rivalry between the various
squads is more than keen, all
of the huts up on the row,
luncheon clubs, and independ
ent outfits putting up a stiff
battle for the coveted trophy—
a large silver-mounted basket
ball.
Yet, mural sports, especially bas
tball, which is the most popular
and, lias a much greater value
an drumming up mere interest
d rivalry between the living
oups. The various house fathers
end enough time figuring out how
ey can cut each others' throats
it is. And the luncheon clubs
)iild keep on throwing water
en though sports were abolished
together. Its big value lies in de
loping green material, and creat
e, an interest in the game itself,
is the cradle of varsity material!
True, the cradle is only of
small family size, and has not
directly developed a great
horde of prominent stars. But
in the absence of a Goof bas
ketball team to turn out fin
ished material, as does the
Gray football eleven, this more
gentle form of entertainment
does its bit.
For example, last winter Carroll
eaver was unheard of as far as
oping the bucket went. But by
rticipating in the mural series,
us improving his play week by
■ek, he blossomed out into a dead
e dick. This year Mr. Weaver
is graduated to Hunt's varsity,
id according to the Card mentor,
is great possibilities ahead of
m. Mural basketball gave Weaver
s start.
And so it will continue to

give green players a start in
the future. Mural basketball
will hold an important role in
Stanford athletics, until the
B.A.C. coaches, and other head
men see the light—and form a
Goof hoop team with which to
develop the unlimited young,
inexperienced material about I
the campus. The Grays have
already proved their worth.
The athletic authorities would
do well to consider this other '
suggestion—a Goof basketball
team. —Stephen Dietrich.
