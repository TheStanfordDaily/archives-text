Sigma Chis Strong
Appearing in these games are
several fives expected to emerge
near the top at the close of the
tournament. Sigma Chi, with a
wealth of material, has been prac
ticing regularly since the start of
the quarter, and looks to have an
outfit which should place high in
the final rating. Ed Elliott, lanky
center, Art. Larsen, guard, and
Whitey Bowers, forward, are among
the Sigma Chi assets. Nothing is
known of the caliber of their op
ponents.
The S.A.E.-Fiji struggle should
be fairly evenly matched. The
Fijis possess a number of capable
hoop artists but will meet plenty
of competition from the S.A.E.
quintet led by Johnny Shidler.
Sigma Nu Looks Good
Sigma Nu, prominent contenders
during the last two years, will pre
sent many of the same players
used in the past. Kim Dyer, Bob
Clarke, the Mnlmquist. brothers,
among others, will compose a for
midable quintet. The Encina All
Stars boast several men of genuine
ability and may upset the Sigma
Nu's hopes.
The Betas have material for a
strong five and should tnke their
contest with the A.K.L.'s.
