# NOT-SO-WEARY WILLIE
## "Nurmi's Shadow" Willie Ritola, Who Beat The Flying Finn in Olympic Race in 1928, Plans Comeback 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Willie Ritola, famous irt years
' gone by as "Nurmi's shadow,'.' has
announced that he is coming out
of the retirement that has obscured
him since the close of the 1928
Olympic games, and will open his
1930 indoor campaign at the fifth
annual games of the Brooklyn Eve
ning High School on January 11.
Ritola is the present holder of nu
merous world's and American rec
ords, including the indoor marks
for three, four, and five miles, and
5,000 meters. In the last Olympics,
i at Amsterdam, lie finished second
to Nurmi, the Flying Finn, in the
10,000 meter run, but conquered
his more illustrious countryman in
the 5,000 meter event. Willie also
' won a heat of the 3,000 meter
1 steeplechase trials, but dropped
Gut in the finals.
I never could quite figure out,
back in 1925, when Ritola was
Nurmi's right-hand man and was
taking semi-weekly beatings at the
hands, or rather feet of the sensa
tional Abo Antelope, whether the

inspiration of Paavo's remarkable
running urged Willie on to far ex
ceed his best previous efforts, or
whether he really was a great run
ner with an inferiority complex. At
any rate the two staged some me
morable duals that winter, and I
believe Ritola always ran second
txcept in that famous "veal pot-pie
race" in which Nrmi was forced to
stop before the end, after setting
a couple of world's records en
route.
Ritola hasn't Ihe polish and
rhythm of Nurmi, his style is much
more awkward. His head rolls
around and his arms and legs paw
the air, so to speak, but lie gets
there just the same. Willie ran 2
miles in 9 minutes 3 4-5 seconds
in 1925, which speaks for itself. 11l
the 1924 Olympic games he won
two championships, breaking the
records in the 10,000 meters and
3,000 meters steeplechase, and fin
ished second to Nurmi in three
other races. Quite a foot racer,
this Willie Ritola!
