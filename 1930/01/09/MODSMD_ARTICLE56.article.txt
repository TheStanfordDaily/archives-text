STOCKTON, Jan. 8. (,P)â€”An at
tempt to serid provisions to Mr. and
i Mrs. John Nightingale, snowbound
in a cabin at Niagara Creek, 45
i miles above Sonora in the high
I Sierras, by airplane, failed today
when Les Oranges, local pilot, re
j turned after two hours and 20 min
utes in the air. Oranges, who was
j accompanied by Ralph Hughes and
Pete Botkin, circled over the vicin
-1 it y of Niagara Creek, but were un
able to distinguish the cabin due
to the white blanket of snow.
