# Cards Prepare For Tilt With U.C.L.A. Bruins
## Hard Game Expected When Redshirts Tangle With Southern Quintet 
### 
With the Pacific upset a thing
of the past and with high hopes of
a Coast title, Coach Husky Hunt's
basketball five got down to real
practice yesterday afternoon in
preparation for its Conference
opener at U.C.L.A. on Saturday.
All of the players came through
the Tiger .tilt in good shape and
are ready for the Southern inva
sion this week-end. Captain Har
low Kothert, in spite of a broken
blood vessel, played the entire
forty minutes and stood out by his
defensive work as well as locating
the basket for three ringers. Rot li
cit is rapidly improving over his
showing last winter, and is develop
ing into one of the best guards on
the Coast. The Card leader has
added value, in that he can jump
at. center with the tallest of them.
Surprise Showing
The Pacific rout came as a. com
plete.- surprise, as the Stockton
team came down to the Farm re
puted as a strong team. Coming as
it. did, after the Cards had drubbed
St. Mary's and piled up a 49 to 14
win over San Jose State, seems to
indicate that Stanford is not fo be
denied on the court this year.
These latter two wins were thought
by some to be a mere flash in the
bucket, until the Redshirt forwards
broke through the Tiger defense
to score at will.
