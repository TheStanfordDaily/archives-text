"Meat! Meat! Here comes an
open car! Sock 'ini. O-h-h! Where's
your aim? Contact. Got that one!"
What was that? Oh, just the
Kappa Sigs' impromptu snow party
staged on tlie lawn and vicinity in
front of the house. Alden Oliver
made an excursion to the Skyline
yesterday afternoon and returned
with a tonneau full of the white
and fluffy substance, which was
immediately rolled into snowballs
and hurled at unsuspecting motor
ir.lf. who chanced to be going up
the Row.
No casualties were reported, but
there were several direct hits
which did not put anybody but the
pranksters in a very good humor.
