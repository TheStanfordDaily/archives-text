# LOVE 'EM, LAM 'EM; JUST AN ANCIENT MEXICAN CUSTOM

MEXICO CITY, Jan. !). (#>)
â€”Because Maria Reyes did
not come out on the balcony
to toss him the traditional
flower when he serenaded her
at live o'clock in the morning,
Juan Martinez climbed
through a window and broke
his guitar over her head.
Juan was merely following
Mexican custom when he an
pea red to awaken Maria early
on her Saint's Day to the
strains of Las Mananitas, and
when she refused to get up
after a half hour's singing and
strumming, he became in
censed.
While the police do not in
terfere ordinarily with sere
naders, they do take a hand
when the situation demands.
Consequently Juan is now in
jail.
