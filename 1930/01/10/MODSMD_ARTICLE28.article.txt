# CARDINALS FACE BIG TEST TOMORROW NIGHT IN TILT WITH EAST BRUIN QUINTET
## Southern Team Given Slight Edge Over Rivals From Farm; Hunt's Five Has Strong Reserves 
### BY STEPHEN DIETRICH 
i TIEADINGi lor West wood to meet the U.G.L.A. Bruins tomorrow night
in their lirst Conference tilt of the 1930 basketball season, the
Cardinal hoop squad, twelve strong, is scheduled to depart on the
southbound limited this evening. Coach Husky Hunt and Charles Fox,
j team manager, will accompany the players.
Doped as a toss-up, tomorrow's game may go a long way in determin
j ing the outcome of the Conference race, as Stanford and U.G.L.A. are
i held by critics to be the two strongest college quintets on the Coast.
! Comparative practice tilt scores give the Bruins a slight edge, as
, Coach Caddy Works' five lias won four out of its five contests to date,
: including a lopsided victory over Whittier and two wins out of a three-
I game series with the University of Utah. The Utes, it will be remem-

bered, had an easy time trouncing
St. Mary's in a doubleheader over
the Christmas holidays.
Cards Improve
Hunt's outfit, on the other hand,
has come out on the long end of
the score in five out of seven en
counters. Getting off to a slow
start, the Cards dropped two rag
ged games during the holidays, or.
to Oregon State and the other t
Y.M.I. Since the beginning of th
year, the Cards have speeded up ;
bit, chalking up three wins in a
row, Tuesday's game ending in a
record-breaking score for the Farm
players.
But while Stanford has a veteran
five, with a large squad of experi
enced substitutes, U.C.L.A. is made
up of comparatively green material.
The only exception is Captain
Larry Wilds, who has played an
outstanding game at forward for
the past two years.
However, the southern team has
rapidly developed into a Emooth
running title contender under the
tutelage of Coach Works. In fact,
Works thinks that this season's
quintet is one of the best in Bruin
basketball history.
Von Hagen Good
Besides Captain Wilks, who har
rassed the Cards considerably in
'29 with his uncanny basket-shoot
ing, the Bruin mentor has another
flashy forward to stall, tomorrow
night in the person of Dick Von
Hagen. The latter came into promi
nence two weeks ago, when he ran
wild against the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club, and promises to cause
the Itedshirts a lot of trouble be
fore the evening is over.
Works hopes to-get the jump at.
center with Frank Lubin in at the
pivot position. Lubin, like Rothert,
Card captain, drops back to a
guard berth after the tip-off. The
Bruin center plays a clever floor
game, and is especially adept, in
getting the ball off the backboard.
Against this combination, Hunt
will probably start the same five
that looked so good in the San Jose
and Pacific games, although the
definite Card lineup will not be an
nounced until game time tomorrow
night. In all probability, Johnny
McCandless, elongated tip-in art
ist, Red Berg, who sinks baskets
from all angles, Vance Fawcett,
tricky dribbler and passer, Captain
Rothert, tower on defense, and Milt
Rowley, who stands out on offense
as well as defense, will be in at
the opening whistle.
Following are the players com
prising the roster, for the West
wood invasion.
Forwards —Fawcett, Weaver, Ty
ler, Berg.
Centers —Doub, McCandless, and
Hawkins.
Guards —Mears, Rothert, Row
ley, Reynolds, and Rintala.
