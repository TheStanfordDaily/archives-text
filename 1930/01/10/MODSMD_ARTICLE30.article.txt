## 
### 
SAN PEDRO, Jan. !). (/p) â€” The
v reckage of one of the motion pic
ture philips which collided off
Point Vicente near here a week
ago, killing ton persons, was raised
(o the surface of the ocean today
.Hid hauled aboard the salvage tug
Salt. There were no bodies in it
and Charles Smale, diver, who pre
viously recovered two bodies from
it, descended to the ocean floor to
make a final search.
The tangled mass of steel showed
that the terrific impact caused by
the mo-mile-an-hour speed at, which
the planes were cruising when they
collided had reduced the ships to
complete wreckage. The meager re
port received here did not tell
whether the motor, plane instru
ments, or valuable camera equip
ment which was in the ship, also
had been salvaged. The material
which could be saved from each
plane was valued at about $10,000.
