# THE 						RED TERROR
## 
### 
\\ liil<' tond memories of the old Toonerville line of the Peninsula
Railway Company linger on with the presence of rusty rails, the
present torm ol motor coach transportation on the campus is be
''lining obnoxious in its intrusion into the smooth functioning ways
of the community.
\\ hen the hi#, red buses promiscuously stop to take on or eject
passengers, the operators usually choose a spot to halt the coaches
direcily in the way ol automobiles traveling in both directions. This
binders traffic and constitutes a serious menace on the narrow cam
pus roads.
I he buses are especially nuisances on Lasuen Street and more
particularly at the end of the lineâ€”the intersection of Lasuen and
Santa N nez streets. At this crossing the coaches back up Santa
'''i ne/. to turn around. While waiting for the proper departure times,
the buses remain in the middle of the thoroughfare or so close to it
as id become a danger to automobiles passing Santa Yne/. or turning
into the upper portion of it.
Instead of enforcing campus parking rules in such an isolated
place as the Chemistry building, the local authorities might do well
to regulate the Peninsula company's buses and keep them from
annoying the residents.
A series of designated bus stops where the coaches could
drive in close to the roadside might be a remedy to this prob
lem.
