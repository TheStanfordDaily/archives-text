# OUR "STALWART, COURAGEOUS" SENATOR
## 
### 
From the capital of our golden state comes a scathing attack
upon (ieorge C reel, speaker at the X.S.F.A. Congress, in the form
ol ".Merely a Private Think." It was written by C. K., who pre
sumably is C. k. McClatchy. publisher of a San Joaquin Valley
newspaper chain.
Creel in an address to 175 campus leaders from American col
leges attacked Senator Johnson of California and Senator Borah of
Idaho. Me declared that America's chances of joining the League
of Nations had been "buried under a mass of •lies."
"Those chances were buried —and < iod be thanked they were!—
b\ a stalwart, courageous, unceasing fight; and the honor therefor
belongs principally to one I liram W. Johnson. Were it not for him
i here is no doubt the I'nited States today would be a member of the
League of Nations"—so writes C. K.
" I o some it may be a surprising fact that the students of Stan
lord University listened to this liaron Munchausen's attack upon
-enator Johnson without hissing.
"I'ut there may be two reasons, or excuses, therefor:
"1. —The average Stanford student could not expect to he well
acquainted with political events which happened in 1914.
'2.—The atmosphere of Stanford University—as well as that
of the University of California—is not favorable to the truth con- I
' » rning Progressive measures, or such Progressive leaders as I liram
W. Johnson.
For the general air in both is decidedly reactionary.
"Still, even at that, one would think that, now knowing the facts, j
everybody in Stanford University hereafter would steer clear of j
itch vicious and irresponsible Ananiases as George Creel."
From the tone of C. K.'s article the Daily would gain the im- ;
pression that he and (ieorge Creel are not exactly bosom pals. Put
for all of C. K.'s derisions, the Daily cannot but continue to remain
convinced that (ieorge Creel has served The People (a muchly-re
ered term in C. K.'s journals) as faithfully although not as loudly
as Senator Johnson.
I bat the atmosphere of Stanford is not favorable to truth con
cerning Progressive measures is indeed an irrational statement from
< K. Stanford, where "The Winds of Freedom Blow," holds on j
iis campus representatives from almost every conceivable political
faction.
Ii was not a group of Stanford students who listened to Creel's
message. It was a session of prominent student executives from all
parts of our country. The speaker was enthusiastically applauded.
Keaction by an assemblage of Cardinal students would have been !
imilar. if not more riotously bombastic in its plaudits.
( . K.. Johnson, and I learst represent one kind of thinker; Creel
represents a type appealing to an intelligent university audience.
