SINCERITY, by John Erskine.
Bobbs-Merrill Co. New York,
1929.
I In his latest book, "Sincerity," John
Erskine has turned serious, or per
haps he has become sincere. Those
who read this book will find none of
the levity of treatment that was used
in "Helen or Troy" or "(ialahad."
Erskine calls his tale a "story of our
' time" and he tells of the tangled lives
, of three essentially fine people in
1 search of liberty.
The plot is unusually original; any
statement of it in bald facts would
make it appear to have a sordidness
! which it does not possess. YVinthrop
Beauvel and his wife Mary are es
teemed and respected American citi
zens.
One night after ten years of pros
perity they entertain an unexpected
visitor, Isabel. The next dav Mary
leaves town and Tsabel remains with
Winthrop. Isabel it seems is his real
wife and he and Mary had never been
married. The case from the outside
is inexplicable. Erskine tells us how
these strange facts are the result of
Isabel's attempt to be asolutely sin
cere.
The story is fascinating. Erskine
says what lie has to say with no apol
ogies and no embellishments. He
lets his characters explain themselves
and allows the reader to draw out his
own opinions. The hook is made up
j entirely of conversation or "stream
| of consciousness," and consequently
there arc no lengthy descriptions or
tedious details.
The quest for sincerity is not a suc
cess. Erskine seems to think that sin
cerity is complex and as such cannot
1 be completely attained. It is only at
the end of ten years, however, that
i the search for sincerity is ended and
Mary and the Beauvels are at the
same place from which they started.
Erskine is widely read and has a
knowledge of many places and things;
consequently his book never becomes

boring. The only criticism of "Sin- i
ccrity" is to he found ill the frequent
occurrence of hed-room scenes. While
they are extremely delicately de
scribed, they become a trifle too nu- '
merotis.
Krskine writes beautifully. His
clarity and simplicity of style never
detract from the effect. His charac- .
ters, while unusual, are vividly por
trayed and at the close of the book
their disordered lives remain before
one as a very real problem of life.

"A Short History of Women,"
I!»2J> book by John Langdon-Davies,
is one of the volumes which will
go into circulation in the reference
room of the Stanford Library to- ,
day.
The author dedicates the book,
"a history of human ideas about
the nature and differences of the j
two sexes," to his wife. The ma
terial covers the biological back
ground of woman, her place iri
primitive society, her relation to
the church, and her transition from
the "womanly woman to intelligent
being."
The consulate general of Japan
at San Francisco has donated "Im- 1
perial Coronation," which also goes
into circulation today. The book is
bound in Japanese fashion and is
illustrated. Published and edited
by Kazuo Oinumu, it is a history of
Japan's industrial, financial, and
business growth from 1924 to 1928.
Others of the group which is
being transferred from the inspec
tion shelf are "Sinism, a study of
the evolution of the Chinese world- |
view," by Herrlee Glessner Creel;
"The Romance and Rise of the
American Tropics," by Samuel
Crowther; and "Primitive Econo
mics of the New Zealand Maori,"

"A Short History of Women,"
I!»2J> book by John Langdon-Davies,
is one of the volumes which will
go into circulation in the reference
room of the Stanford Library to- ,
day.
The author dedicates the book,
"a history of human ideas about
the nature and differences of the j
two sexes," to his wife. The ma
terial covers the biological back
ground of woman, her place iri
primitive society, her relation to
the church, and her transition from
the "womanly woman to intelligent
being."
The consulate general of Japan
at San Francisco has donated "Im- 1
perial Coronation," which also goes
into circulation today. The book is
bound in Japanese fashion and is
illustrated. Published and edited
by Kazuo Oinumu, it is a history of
Japan's industrial, financial, and
business growth from 1924 to 1928.
Others of the group which is
being transferred from the inspec
tion shelf are "Sinism, a study of
the evolution of the Chinese world- |
view," by Herrlee Glessner Creel;
"The Romance and Rise of the
American Tropics," by Samuel
Crowther; and "Primitive Econo
mics of the New Zealand Maori,"

SINCERITY, by John Erskine.
Bobbs-Merrill Co. New York,
1929.
I In his latest book, "Sincerity," John
Erskine has turned serious, or per
haps he has become sincere. Those
who read this book will find none of
the levity of treatment that was used
in "Helen or Troy" or "(ialahad."
Erskine calls his tale a "story of our
' time" and he tells of the tangled lives
, of three essentially fine people in
1 search of liberty.
The plot is unusually original; any
statement of it in bald facts would
make it appear to have a sordidness
! which it does not possess. YVinthrop
Beauvel and his wife Mary are es
teemed and respected American citi
zens.
One night after ten years of pros
perity they entertain an unexpected
visitor, Isabel. The next dav Mary
leaves town and Tsabel remains with
Winthrop. Isabel it seems is his real
wife and he and Mary had never been
married. The case from the outside
is inexplicable. Erskine tells us how
these strange facts are the result of
Isabel's attempt to be asolutely sin
cere.
The story is fascinating. Erskine
says what lie has to say with no apol
ogies and no embellishments. He
lets his characters explain themselves
and allows the reader to draw out his
own opinions. The hook is made up
j entirely of conversation or "stream
| of consciousness," and consequently
there arc no lengthy descriptions or
tedious details.
The quest for sincerity is not a suc
cess. Erskine seems to think that sin
cerity is complex and as such cannot
1 be completely attained. It is only at
the end of ten years, however, that
i the search for sincerity is ended and
Mary and the Beauvels are at the
