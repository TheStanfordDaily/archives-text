# GEOLOGY AS LIFE WORK REQUIRES MUCH HARD PREPARATION; INCOME RANGE LARGE!
## THE 						PROFESSION OF GEOLOGY

( Editors A lote. —7 he follounnu is the first of a series of weekly articles 1
: to be published in the Stanford Daily, concerning vocational fields open to l

mittee on I'ocatiounl Guidance through its secretary, ( . Xiilhert H'reim.,

The (raining of a geologist, must
be wide. The lale Professor Bran
| ner said that a geologist should
have a reading knowledge of Latin,
French, and German, the mathe
matics of a civil engineer, with
some attention to astronomy, and
| thorough training in physics and
chemistry with especial reference
to inorganic chemistry and optics.
Professor Branner further believed
that a good geologist should be
also a good civil engineer with an
understanding of mining and me
chanical engineering. He should at
least have a thorough, knowledge
of surveying, topographic work,
and drawing. At least a bachelor's
degree in geology is necessary and
from one to three years of gradu
\ ate work is preferred.
The range of income is wide. Of
fice workers, draftsmen, and field
workers in government service get
from .$l4OO to $4000; Bureau chiefs
in state and government work get
I from $6000 to $10,000. Compensa
tion for geologists in private work
! or working for corporations, is
especially high, the range being
from $2500 to $25,000.
Geology is not an independent
i science. It partakes of the prin
ciples and findings of various sci
-1 ences such as physics and chem
istry and is intimately linked in
| some phases witli engineering, eco
nomics and industry. Economic
and commercial geology are the
two most profitable fields fianeially.
! Exploring geology, petroleum
j geology and mining geology
all appeal to the man with
a taste for tin* outdoors. The great
demand of a few years ago for
I petroleum geologists is now being
; adequately met. and it seems that
mining geology with a research em
i phasis offers a better commercial
opportunity today. On the other
hand teaching, research, and mu
i seuni geology give employment to
i men more scholastlcally minded.
I A study made in 11)21 by the Na-

I tional Research Council concluded
! that there wuh a total of 1275 indi-
I viduals in geology and geography
! in the United States. It was further
i found that, an average of 25 new
men and women had entered the
; profession annually for the past 40
i years and that a total of 50 to f>o
more each year would adequately |
j supply the demand. It is believed
that the situation is much more
; hopeful today and that many more
j than 00 a year are needed, par
ticularly in t-he commercial Held.
California has recently estab
j lished a state geological survey as
; a bureau of the Division of Mines.
I A former Stanford man, Olaf Jen
i kins, is director of the survey.
Anyone contemplating geological
, work in the United States Geol

Eight reasons why a young man
might want to enter geology as a
professional are given by 11. P.
Little, prominent in this field:
1. The science} is young.
2. The range of possible employ
ment is large.
.'!. The investigator may feel that
his work has an intimate relation
with the winning and best utiliza
tion of the raw materials which
contribute to national and world
prosperity.
4. The geologist has the pleasure
of realizing close bonds with many i
kinds of people and many fields of
human interest.
5. The character of the science i
is such as to develop good judg
ment.
6. The geologist deserves great
reward from his intimate under
standing of nature.
7. Geology is an invigorator —
physically.
8. Science is an invigoralor —
morally and spiritually.

( Editors A lote. —7 he follounnu is the first of a series of weekly articles 1
: to be published in the Stanford Daily, concerning vocational fields open to l
j the ctJlet/e student. I lie material presented has been offered hy the Com- \
mittee on I'ocatiounl Guidance through its secretary, ( . Xiilhert H'reim.,

The (raining of a geologist, must
be wide. The lale Professor Bran
| ner said that a geologist should
have a reading knowledge of Latin,
French, and German, the mathe
matics of a civil engineer, with
some attention to astronomy, and
| thorough training in physics and
chemistry with especial reference
to inorganic chemistry and optics.
Professor Branner further believed
that a good geologist should be
also a good civil engineer with an
understanding of mining and me
chanical engineering. He should at
least have a thorough, knowledge
of surveying, topographic work,
and drawing. At least a bachelor's
degree in geology is necessary and
from one to three years of gradu
\ ate work is preferred.
The range of income is wide. Of
fice workers, draftsmen, and field
workers in government service get
from .$l4OO to $4000; Bureau chiefs
in state and government work get
I from $6000 to $10,000. Compensa
tion for geologists in private work
! or working for corporations, is
especially high, the range being
from $2500 to $25,000.
Geology is not an independent
i science. It partakes of the prin
ciples and findings of various sci
-1 ences such as physics and chem
istry and is intimately linked in
| some phases witli engineering, eco
nomics and industry. Economic
and commercial geology are the
two most profitable fields fianeially.
! Exploring geology, petroleum
j geology and mining geology
all appeal to the man with
a taste for tin* outdoors. The great
demand of a few years ago for
I petroleum geologists is now being
; adequately met. and it seems that
mining geology with a research em
i phasis offers a better commercial
opportunity today. On the other
hand teaching, research, and mu
i seuni geology give employment to
i men more scholastlcally minded.
I A study made in 11)21 by the Na-

I tional Research Council concluded
! that there wuh a total of 1275 indi-
I viduals in geology and geography
! in the United States. It was further
i found that, an average of 25 new
men and women had entered the
; profession annually for the past 40
i years and that a total of 50 to f>o
more each year would adequately |
j supply the demand. It is believed
that the situation is much more
; hopeful today and that many more
j than 00 a year are needed, par
ticularly in t-he commercial Held.
