This damp weather, it seems, is
griping in more ways than one.
Of course, Hilly, the campus
sheepherder, chuckles gleefully
when he notes how green the grass
is growing, and Ernie Brundsten,
dealer in swim records and lake
resort concessions, rubs his hands
together most lustily as he visions
water trickling into Searsvllle
i basin.
Yet, moral and physical discom
forts of the oozing atmosphere
more than balance up against its
economic assets, especially when
the various forms of outdoor ath
letics are taken into consideration.
The vast multitude of ama
teur student golfers come in
for their share of the gripes.
For after patiently awaiting
the gala opening of the new
campus golf course on New
Year's Day, spending their
spare time all fall between
classes and grid festivities
working out over bridge and
poker tables, the prospective
niblic-wielders have been
forced during the past two (
j weeks to confine their golfing
activities largely to parlor put
j ting.
Those that have been brave<
I enough to venture out to the course
have passed away the hours
"swinging in the rain!"
I Knicker - wearing anticipations
i have been completely water
soaked. The golf shop on the
course has taken on the air of an
exclusive duck club, with the paid
members plodding around decked
! out with boots, slickers, and other
1 articles of hunting paraphernalia.
The course itself looks more
like a duck reservation than a
place for replacing divots, with
bunkers poking their heads out
of the pond here and there in
the aristocratic bearing of
shooting blinds, and sand pits
appearing most menacingly to
decoy slices and hooks that
have strayed too far from the
fairway swamps.
But with balmy spring days pre
dicted for the near future, a silver
lining hovers among the clouds, j
j and it won't be long before the
course fairly teems with dubs, par
shooters, and those eligible for the
hol6-in-one club.
Outside the realm of golf, such
sports as tennis, track, and winter l
grid practice have suffered most.
: The tennis courts are as isolated
as the pest house, while sprint as- \
( pirants dodge raindrops for diver
sion and exercise.
What is more, the intramural
fall track meet, postponed to
this quarter by a mixture of
lethargy and rain, seems des
tined to be put off to a still
remoter date. In fact, if things
go on as they are, the mural
directors may see fit to hold
two meets next fall, or to com- i
bine the two track events into
one big biennial affair.
The rain, it must be admitted,
has had something to do with the i
change. But more than one person
1 on this campus is inclined to be- i
lieve that the stalling has been i
largely due to inefficiency on the |
I part of the so-called intramural di-1
rectors. For the high-sounding ,
board has slipped up on several I
matters to date.
Among the slip-ups was the
scheduling of the mural track meet j
a week late. The finally fixed date
proved to be all wet, and now all j
that remain is a lrit of dampened j
spirits. « /

The directors seem lo be
more interested in other things
than mural sports. Before this
school year, intramural activi.
ties were organized under the
central control of one man.
And the various all-University
athletics clicked off quite
smoothly. However, the head
man was sent out to earn Mis
ham and eggs elsewhere, and
the present board system was
introduced.
II is rumored that the ex-head
nytn was given the gale because
he was too easy-going. Well- -lie
may have been a little lux, but,
then, the present mural directors
appear lo be almost dead on their
feet!
This is no idle jest, for one
has merely to sit in at some
of the living group bull ses
sions to hear growl after growl
of discontent.
May the mural directors
shake the mildew off their
backs and run the basketball
series as it should be run, ;ind
may they see fit to hold the
track meet before it is forgot
ten altogether!
