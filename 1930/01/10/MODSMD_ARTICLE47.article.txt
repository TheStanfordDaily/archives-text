# "HAIL TO OLD PURDUE"...
## Coach Jimmy Phelan, of Purdue Fame, Goes to Seattle To Coach Husky Gridmen 
### Feg Murray 
112 Now that, the Boilermakers of
1 Purdue are wearing little gold foot
balls, emblematic of the 1929 West
ern Conference football champion
ship, instead of iron rivets, let us
take a peek at Coach Jimmy Phe
j lan, whose untiring efforts have
put the Lafayette, Indiana, institu
tion at the top of the Big Ten for
I the first time in history.
Phelan played football with
j Knute Rockne at Notre Dame,

i learning his stuff from Coach Jess
Harper. He was quarterback and
captain of (he 1916 Notre Darae
varsity, and noted as an elusive
broken field runner. After three
years of coaching experience at
Missouri, Jimmy took charge of
things at Purdue in 1922, and found
football matters in a very bad way.
Basketball was the big sport there, j
and the football glories of Purdue
in the past had been forgotten, j

| But Coach Jimmy went to work,
j installed his own version of the
j now famous Notre Dame system,
and in 1927 startled the football
! world by defeating Harvard and
I springing the redoutable "Pest"
Welch on the multitude. This same
"Pest," ably aided and abetted by
Glenn Harmeson and Yunevich,
have run riot through all opposi
| tion this year and helped to bring
tjie afore-mentioned little gold loot
balls to Purdue at last. Phelan has
just arrived in Seattle to take over
the Husky football coaching posi
tion.
