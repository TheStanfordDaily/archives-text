Pipes save no
midnight oil
IF PIPES made the man, anybody
at all could rise in the world just
by smoking a few pounds of Edge
worth. Butpipesdonotmaketheman.
Men make the pipe—most men do.
i Somewhat depends on the individual,
J more on the pipe, and t lie tobacco is
I most: important of all. Thing 9 must
[ be congenial.
Edgeworth is a congenial tobacco,
! cool, slow-burning, fully flavored.
| Edgeworth has poise, kindly good
j nature, real tobacco personality —*
! Edgeworth welcomes new friends,
j Many a good man has been pledged
| to pipes by Edgeworth alone.
| Like to inert Edgeworth? Just aslc
; with the coupon—and the postman
| will bring your first few pipefuls of
j the genuine, three years seasoned if
j it's a day. Our treat, if you please.
| Others have found Edgeworth and
' quit their discontent.
So may it be with you!
