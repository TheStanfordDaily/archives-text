From small shops to vast factories . . .
from blacksmith's forge to six-ton electric
furnaces . . . from Joule's theory of heat
to superheat . . . from guesswork to sci
ence . . . from waste to economy—these
' i
hint the revolution in industry since 1855.
The growth of Crane Co. through these
years is a significant reflection of the
growth of all industry. From a one-man
shop founded three-quarters of a century
ago, it has grown to a world organization,
meeting in its own factories the power and
production problems that have faced other
manufacturers. Supplying the piping mate
rials that have released power, effected
economies, and increased production
everywhere, it has of necessity met and
solved piping problems as they have
arisen in all industries.
Now in its 75th anniversary year,it serves
all industries with the materials developed,
the knowledge and experience gained. To
engineering students, its customers of the
future, it offers a valuable reference book
and research manual on metal reactions
under high pressure and superheat:
"Pioneering in Science." Write for it.
