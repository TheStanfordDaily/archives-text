### 
HENDERSON, Ky , Jan 12. (/p)
- Far back in the Kentucky bills,
Aaron Bridewell, 3!5, and Dorris
Woods, 38, today were sealed tight
in a blazing mine- a mine (hat. will
be their tomb.
The two men were working 300
feet* back in a slope mine, one that
goes into a hillside, late yesterday,
when tire broke out in the entrance,
trapping them. Gasoline from an
engine pulling the mine car be
came ignited, spread, and in a, few
minutes the mine entrance was a
blazing inferno.
Rcscuc Crews
Calls for mine rescue crews were
sent, to Evansville, Ind., Madison
ville and Sturgis, Ky. But it was
late at night before aid arrived on
horseback and mulcback. Tie
roads in the vicinity are impass
able for automobiles.
The volunteer workers labored
heroically to stem the flames, but
could make no headway.
Mine Sealed
At midnight last, night <J. 1*
Powell, Evansville, U.S. Mine Bu
reau inspector, anounced there was
no chance for the men to be alive
and ordered the mine sealed to
smother the fire. The sealing of
the mine was completed today. In
spector Powell said il probably
would be at least lour or live weeks
before the mine could be opened,
as the lire was expected to burn
that long.
