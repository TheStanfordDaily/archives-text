# AN AGE-OLD QUESTION
## 
### 
Marmon < ). De (iraff and M;ix l\ Meyer, professors at the
I'niversity of Missouri, were thrown out of their johs last year hy
crude political maneuvering" to satisfy cheap moralists of the
"Show-rue" state who became shocked ;it a sex questionnaire cir
culated hy the two educators.
Professors l)e (iraff and Mever now find themselves fully justi
fied hv a special committee of the Association of University Pro
fessors which thoroughly investigated the controversy stirred up
hy mid-Yictorian hypocrisy at Missouri's state university.
This justification prohahly will not return the two men to their
posts, of course, hut it is gratifying to see "arm strong" methods
of administration control over faculty members publicly repudiated.
In its findings the committee says, "These students do have
ideals and convictions about the sexual code and they do discuss
their ideals. These students have access to books and magazine
articles by the hundreds that deal with the social institutions of
betrothal, marriage, fidelity, birili control, divorce, and other aspects
of our sexual code. They see these problems discussed in current
fiction, in the moving pictures, and on the stage."
When the world at large, and the big moguls of education in
particular, come to realize the truth of that statement, they will
perhaps, that it is better calmly and scientifically to instruct
\outh along these lines.
Does this country wish to have its young men and women form
their ideas and ideals from fraternity and sorority bull sessions,
from movies and magazines; or should their ideas and ideals on one
of life's most vital issues be based on sanity and knowledge?
