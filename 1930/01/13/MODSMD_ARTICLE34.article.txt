India, that land of opulent princes and down trodden populaces,!
that nation of fertile lands yet periodic famines, is bubbling with
agitation, stirring with ;i desire to hite ihe hand that feeds it.
Led by that self-starved, wizened little saint—Mahatma Gandhi j
—patriotic Indians are impatient to proclaim an independent state 1
ruled by a ( >2 per cent illiterate electorate. In another attempt to j
foment popular opinion to such a peak that revolt will bring inde
pendence, the Indian National Congress convened a few days ago
in famed Lahore, capital of the Punjab and ancient city of the 1
Mogul ruler, Akbar.
Protected by fiUO British special constables, 80,000 Nationalists ■
met for the announced purpose of committing high treason cn i
masse. "We are now in open conspiracy to free India" was the i
entiment of the conclave. A year ago the Nationalists issued the,
ultimatum: "If the British Parliament does not grant India domin-j
ion status with a legal Indian Parliament before December 31, 1929,;
then the Indian National Congress will proclaim civil resistance to,
the British rule."
Gandhi, always a non-resistant, urged independence by exhort-,
ing 250-million Indians to stop paying taxes, stop buying British!
goods, and indulge in a passive orgy of "non-violent non-co-opera- !
tion."
Realization of Gandhi's proposed non-co-operation would seri
ously injure Great Britain. More than one-eighth of her export !
:ales would he lost. If Indian tax payers closed their coffers, pay- i
incut of Britain's war debt to the I Hited States would not be read- '
ilv forthcoming.
