Service at the Cellai once again is becoming sluggish. Compli
rated systems for registering small sales and employees indifferent
to the student rush have slowed tip the campus' main eating center j
considerably. Fifteen minute waits for a snail and coffee are not
uncommon.
The administration prides itself on the fact that there are no j
commercial "grease joints'' .on the campus. Hut a few gobs of
grease scattered here and there about the Cellar might lubricate
dragging feet and aid materially iu the speedy dispensing of short 1
orders.
