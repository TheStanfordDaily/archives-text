DISRAELI, at the California Thea
tre, Mayfield.
"Hisraeli" is out-- of the finest

i/i a long time, li .stars ilit* veteran

nificent portrayal of Hit* Victorian
| prime mitiistei is vv«-> 11 taken |>y the
j tii living picture. 11 is performance is
one ol flawless perfection, human
and powerful. There are several
thrilling moments, especially at the
| finish when Disraeli goes to meet
Queen Victoria after his successful
purchase of the Suez Canal.
The show is all Ailiss. However,
! the juveniles, Joan Bennett and
Anthony Bushell, are good. Mrs.

ia show that shouldn't he missed.'

' SEACOART OF BOHEMIA, fly
Christopher Morley. Double
day, Ooran and Co. 19P9.
| The Seacoast of Bohemia, it
I seems, lies in Hoboken; and it
: was there that the Three Hours
! for Lunch Club discovered the Old
I Rialto Theatre, to the benefit and
i delight of New York as well as
! Hoboken theatregoers. In liis in
i imitable style, Christopher Morley
! relates the adventures of himself,
CI eon Throckmorton, Conrad Milli
ken, and Harry Wagstaff Gribble.
In a not too respectable but very
affectionate way, lie describes the
old traditions of the theatre, which
dates from 18(13. He Dils of the ef
j forts of the four "infatuated adven
; turers" to refurnish and revive the
j romantic playhouse, iind of their
eminent success.
Near beer has taken the place
| of the authentic beverage in the
theatre garden of this old German
I town. Modern drama and comedy
replace the old conglomeration of
plays, variety, and prize-fights. Dut
i the near beer is good, and the plays
better, according to Morley. How
ever, t lie curious seeker after the
; "quaint" is not urged to make the
ferry trip from New York to Ho
boken; for, while the directors
take their theatre light-heartedly,
they have a certain affection for
it that resents such superiority.

I Seacoast of Bohemia in liiluri

THF TRESPASSER—At thr New
Stanford Theatre.
Here is a picture which the most
jaded movie-goer, or the most dis
criminating critic alike will call
magnificent with no qualification.
Gloria Swanson is responsible foi
this. The picture opens on an un
usual Gloria —only a pretty secre
truy, just one of the thousands of
happy, careless, very human office
girls. Then the too wealthy; too at
tractive young husband breaks her
heart. Gloria witli a broken heart
is worth looking at: her head and
her backbone are not affected. She
is regal, poised, and beautiful.
Gloria Swanson, the "trespasser"
no other on the screen. No other
star has anything that can approach
the arresting, distinguished quality
that characterizes Gloria's loveli
ness in this picture. No other star
can express so much by her pos
ture alone: And her voice is some
thing* you won't forget.
Kay Hammond's vivid charm,
and the performance given hy the
rtilbless iron-willed father in the
play, deserve particular mention,
while the little juvenile gives a
singularly appealing interpretation
of his part.
Incredibly, Hie plot of Ihe show
is almost as strong as the charac
terization — Willi tile exception of
the box-office, "happy-ever-after"
ending, which is practically the
only flaw to the show from an
artistic point of view.
Gloria Swanson, the "trespesser"
at the bedside of a dying lawyer
lacing this man's wife is the most
powerful scene in the picture, al
t,hough that between the former
and Kay Hammond where both
i make their supreme sacrifice is
also memorable. In a picture in
which renunciation and suffering
plays so large a part, the fact that
the melodramatic element is never
overdone is no small criterion of its
merit. . —M. L. It.
