THF TRESPASSER—At thr New
Stanford Theatre.
Here is a picture which the most
jaded movie-goer, or the most dis
criminating critic alike will call
magnificent with no qualification.
Gloria Swanson is responsible foi
this. The picture opens on an un
usual Gloria —only a pretty secre
truy, just one of the thousands of
happy, careless, very human office
girls. Then the too wealthy; too at
tractive young husband breaks her
heart. Gloria witli a broken heart
is worth looking at: her head and
her backbone are not affected. She
is regal, poised, and beautiful.
Gloria Swanson, the "trespasser"
no other on the screen. No other
star has anything that can approach
the arresting, distinguished quality
that characterizes Gloria's loveli
ness in this picture. No other star
can express so much by her pos
ture alone: And her voice is some
thing* you won't forget.
Kay Hammond's vivid charm,
and the performance given hy the
rtilbless iron-willed father in the
play, deserve particular mention,
while the little juvenile gives a
singularly appealing interpretation
of his part.
Incredibly, Hie plot of Ihe show
is almost as strong as the charac
terization — Willi tile exception of
the box-office, "happy-ever-after"
ending, which is practically the
only flaw to the show from an
artistic point of view.
Gloria Swanson, the "trespesser"
at the bedside of a dying lawyer
lacing this man's wife is the most
powerful scene in the picture, al
t,hough that between the former
and Kay Hammond where both
i make their supreme sacrifice is
also memorable. In a picture in
which renunciation and suffering
plays so large a part, the fact that
the melodramatic element is never
overdone is no small criterion of its
merit. . —M. L. It.

THF TRESPASSER—At thr New
Stanford Theatre.
Here is a picture which the most
jaded movie-goer, or the most dis
criminating critic alike will call
magnificent with no qualification.
Gloria Swanson is responsible foi
this. The picture opens on an un
usual Gloria —only a pretty secre
truy, just one of the thousands of
happy, careless, very human office
girls. Then the too wealthy; too at
tractive young husband breaks her
heart. Gloria witli a broken heart
is worth looking at: her head and
her backbone are not affected. She
is regal, poised, and beautiful.
Gloria Swanson, the "trespasser"
no other on the screen. No other
star has anything that can approach
the arresting, distinguished quality
that characterizes Gloria's loveli
ness in this picture. No other star
can express so much by her pos
ture alone: And her voice is some
thing* you won't forget.
Kay Hammond's vivid charm,
and the performance given hy the
rtilbless iron-willed father in the
play, deserve particular mention,
while the little juvenile gives a
singularly appealing interpretation
of his part.
Incredibly, Hie plot of Ihe show
is almost as strong as the charac
terization — Willi tile exception of
the box-office, "happy-ever-after"
ending, which is practically the
only flaw to the show from an
artistic point of view.
Gloria Swanson, the "trespesser"
at the bedside of a dying lawyer
lacing this man's wife is the most
powerful scene in the picture, al
t,hough that between the former
and Kay Hammond where both
i make their supreme sacrifice is
also memorable. In a picture in
which renunciation and suffering
plays so large a part, the fact that
the melodramatic element is never
overdone is no small criterion of its
merit. . —M. L. It.

THF TRESPASSER—At thr New
Stanford Theatre.
Here is a picture which the most
jaded movie-goer, or the most dis
criminating critic alike will call
magnificent with no qualification.
Gloria Swanson is responsible foi
this. The picture opens on an un
usual Gloria —only a pretty secre
truy, just one of the thousands of
happy, careless, very human office
girls. Then the too wealthy; too at
tractive young husband breaks her
heart. Gloria witli a broken heart
is worth looking at: her head and
her backbone are not affected. She
is regal, poised, and beautiful.
Gloria Swanson, the "trespasser"
no other on the screen. No other
star has anything that can approach
the arresting, distinguished quality
that characterizes Gloria's loveli
ness in this picture. No other star
can express so much by her pos
ture alone: And her voice is some
thing* you won't forget.
Kay Hammond's vivid charm,
and the performance given hy the
rtilbless iron-willed father in the
play, deserve particular mention,
while the little juvenile gives a
singularly appealing interpretation
of his part.
Incredibly, Hie plot of Ihe show
is almost as strong as the charac
terization — Willi tile exception of
the box-office, "happy-ever-after"
ending, which is practically the
only flaw to the show from an
artistic point of view.
Gloria Swanson, the "trespesser"
at the bedside of a dying lawyer
lacing this man's wife is the most
powerful scene in the picture, al
t,hough that between the former
and Kay Hammond where both
i make their supreme sacrifice is
also memorable. In a picture in
which renunciation and suffering
plays so large a part, the fact that
the melodramatic element is never
overdone is no small criterion of its
merit. . —M. L. It.
