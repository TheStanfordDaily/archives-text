| Drive for Big Game traffic, why
doesn't. the administration remem
ber that winter is here and put in
a walk for those in Branner.
j One of the worst eyesores and
1 tliH worst foot-wetter on the cam
pus is n series of man-sized lakes
! extending from Branner to Toyon.
Big-hearted gardeners have put in
; stepping-stones, and planks, and
| have even dug ditches to carry off
the water, but still Hip vast silent

| puddles persist. At high tide, flio
water is way over the various
rorks and bridges. Yours for bigger
