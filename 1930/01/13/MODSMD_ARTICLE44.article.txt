# "Seeing Stanford First" Is Aim Of Daily Travelogue
## 
### 
Editor's Notet This is the first
of a series of articles by Joe Carroll
on the things to do and tsee around
the University which no real Stan
ford man or woman can afford to
rnies.
By Joe Carroll
Today we are going to start
something we have always wanted
Ito do: a Burton Holmes Travel
ogue Department for the Stanford
I Daily with the idea of showing
Stanford students the things tiny
j can do hy "Seeing Stanford Kirst,"
We feel that we have a mission.
! We can see great crowds tram
| pling paths into highways as Stan
ford people awaken to a realization
of the things to see and do in, on,
and about the Stanford campus.'
and also the places to go to, using
Stanford as the base for the place
to leave from.
Many Stanford Trips
We can see these crowds follow
ing in our footsteps, but it doesn't
matter in the least to us if they
never follow. Anyway, we are go
ing to go tlie places and see the 1
people and do the things we have
always said we would do and have
never done. Maybe we can per
I suade others to do them too. May
be not. Anyway, we feel that ev
ery Stanford student wants to go to
these places before he graduates.
' Maybe he'll go there if we tell him
how to make the trips.
1 Now one should always start at
the beginning so we'll commence
with the first thing that one sees
about Stanford: Palm Drive. Ev
eryone drives up it or down it sev
eral times during his college ca
reer (unless lie uses the widely ad- i
vertised back door).
"Back-to-Stanford"
When one turns into Palm Drive
after a vacation or a trip or even i
when returning from Paly, one gets j
that "back-to-Stanford" feeling. One
feels at home. At least this one j
does.
Take time, some clear sunshiny '
day, to walk from the Circle up I
Palm Drive to the Chapel. Paint j
that scene on your memory, for it's
a beautiful one and one that will j
be gone in ten years or so. The |
Palms, the Drive, the Chapel, all j
framed in the background of the [
hills. Remember that and remem- j
ber it well: for even now, oaks
have been planted in back of t lie j
palms and we will eventually go tip I
! Oak Road instead of Palm Drive.
Visit Stanford Tomb
Or take a side trip to the Mu-j
seuni. Be methodical and stop by
the Stanford Tomb. The Mattso-1
leum is on the first road to the
light coming up from Palo Alto.
Visit it. You'll go there once when
you're a senior, so get acquainted
with it now. Then take ttie road
up to the Museum. Prepare to
spend the day. We won't tell you
about, the exhibits. Use your own
j eyes. We have been there. Be-i
lieve it or not.
The Leland Stanford Junior Mu-,
I seum is open every day from in'
a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission costs
adults 25 cents, it is free to cliil
I dren accompanied by their parents,
I excepting that Stanford students,
i can get. in on llieir student body |
| cards, just, like a regular sporting
event or a B.A.C. function.
Return to Civilization
We figure it takes fifteen mill- |
utes for one person to walk up
| Palm Drive to the Memorial Court. |
Two persons or more, walking to
gether, should also do the trip in
the same fifteen minutes. Going by ,
the Mausoleum, allow ten minutes I
to the Tomb, five minutes to the |
Museum, and ten minutes from j
I there back to civilization. You'll]
have to figure out for yourself how
much lime to spend at the Mauso
, leum or the Museum.

Today we are going to start
something we have always wanted
Ito do: a Burton Holmes Travel
ogue Department for the Stanford
I Daily with the idea of showing
Stanford students the things tiny
j can do hy "Seeing Stanford Kirst,"
We feel that we have a mission.
! We can see great crowds tram

ford people awaken to a realization
of the things to see and do in, on,
and about the Stanford campus.'
and also the places to go to, using
Stanford as the base for the place
to leave from.
Many Stanford Trips
We can see these crowds follow
ing in our footsteps, but it doesn't
matter in the least to us if they
never follow. Anyway, we are go
ing to go tlie places and see the 1
people and do the things we have
always said we would do and have
never done. Maybe we can per
I suade others to do them too. May
be not. Anyway, we feel that ev
ery Stanford student wants to go to
these places before he graduates.
' Maybe he'll go there if we tell him
how to make the trips.
1 Now one should always start at
the beginning so we'll commence
with the first thing that one sees
about Stanford: Palm Drive. Ev
eryone drives up it or down it sev
eral times during his college ca
reer (unless lie uses the widely ad- i
vertised back door).
"Back-to-Stanford"
When one turns into Palm Drive
after a vacation or a trip or even i
when returning from Paly, one gets j
that "back-to-Stanford" feeling. One
feels at home. At least this one j
does.
Take time, some clear sunshiny '
day, to walk from the Circle up I
Palm Drive to the Chapel. Paint j
that scene on your memory, for it's
a beautiful one and one that will j
be gone in ten years or so. The |
Palms, the Drive, the Chapel, all j
framed in the background of the [
hills. Remember that and remem- j
ber it well: for even now, oaks
have been planted in back of t lie j
palms and we will eventually go tip I
! Oak Road instead of Palm Drive.
Visit Stanford Tomb
Or take a side trip to the Mu-j
seuni. Be methodical and stop by
the Stanford Tomb. The Mattso-1
leum is on the first road to the
light coming up from Palo Alto.
Visit it. You'll go there once when
you're a senior, so get acquainted
with it now. Then take ttie road
up to the Museum. Prepare to
spend the day. We won't tell you
about, the exhibits. Use your own
j eyes. We have been there. Be-i
lieve it or not.
The Leland Stanford Junior Mu-,
I seum is open every day from in'
a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission costs
adults 25 cents, it is free to cliil
I dren accompanied by their parents,
I excepting that Stanford students,
i can get. in on llieir student body |
| cards, just, like a regular sporting
event or a B.A.C. function.
Return to Civilization
We figure it takes fifteen mill- |
utes for one person to walk up
| Palm Drive to the Memorial Court. |
Two persons or more, walking to
gether, should also do the trip in
the same fifteen minutes. Going by ,
the Mausoleum, allow ten minutes I
to the Tomb, five minutes to the |
Museum, and ten minutes from j
I there back to civilization. You'll]
have to figure out for yourself how
much lime to spend at the Mauso

Return to Civilization
We figure it takes fifteen mill- |
utes for one person to walk up
| Palm Drive to the Memorial Court. |
Two persons or more, walking to
gether, should also do the trip in
the same fifteen minutes. Going by ,
the Mausoleum, allow ten minutes I
to the Tomb, five minutes to the |
Museum, and ten minutes from j
I there back to civilization. You'll]
have to figure out for yourself how
much lime to spend at the Mauso
, leum or the Museum.
