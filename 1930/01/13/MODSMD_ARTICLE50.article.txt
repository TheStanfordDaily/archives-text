# STANFORD YEARLINGS ROUT MENLO JAYSEE BASKET TEAM, 47-15
## Palmer, Meade Play Well; Stockton High Oppose Babes Next Week 
### Don Oswill 
Menlo Junior College's highly
touted basketball team provided
little opposition for Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw's Stanford freshmen here
Saturday night, the Cards winning
easily by a score of 47 to 15. The
baby Redshirts grabbed the lead
early in the first period and were
never headed alter t hat, the score
being Stanford IS, Menlo 7 at half
I line.
Coach Dud DeOroot's Menlo var
sity seemed sadly lacking in of
lensive power. They failed to
demonstrate one play, or any sem
blnnce of a play that was capable
of penetrating the Cards' live-man
defense. However it may have been
the stoutness of the Stanford de
fense that accounted for the in
i'bility of- the Menlo forwards- to
work the ball past the foul line.
Tway and Hancock in particular
exhibited ' some pretty playing
around the backboard besides con
tributing a great deal to the Cardi
nal attack.
Palmer, Stanford right forward,
was the high-point man of the eve
ning sinking eight field goals and
three free throws for a total of
1!» points. The speed of the Card
offense so bewildered the Jaysee
Quintet that time after time Palmer
was free in the hole, where a
quick pass and a sucker shot meant
two points. Bill Meade played a ;
gcaif- game at ■ the .other forward!
position, but Edelen, lanky Card
center, was slightly off form Satur
day night, being somewhat erratic
in bis passing.
In the second half of the contest, j
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw put in j
nearly a complete new team which :
held Menlo almost as easily as the .
regulars did. Tom Cordry, sub for- j
ward and former Hayward High 1
star, turned in some good work for !
the Cards.
For the losers, Tod was probably I
the outstanding performer on the |
floor, while I'ngar, small forward, |
did some good shooting and a j
whole lpt, of not-so-gpod shooting, j
The Menlo guards were not fast
enough to stop the Card forwards, j
who dribbled around and through
them almost at will.
Next week, the Cards will take i
en the Stockton High School five, j
Stockton holds a victory over the j
College of Pacific frosh, who the j
baby Redshirts beat so bad last j
week, and a more recent win over j
Poly High of San- Francisco.

I line.
Coach Dud DeOroot's Menlo var
sity seemed sadly lacking in of
lensive power. They failed to
demonstrate one play, or any sem
blnnce of a play that was capable
of penetrating the Cards' live-man
defense. However it may have been
the stoutness of the Stanford de
fense that accounted for the in
i'bility of- the Menlo forwards- to
work the ball past the foul line.
Tway and Hancock in particular
exhibited ' some pretty playing
around the backboard besides con
tributing a great deal to the Cardi
nal attack.
Palmer, Stanford right forward,
was the high-point man of the eve
ning sinking eight field goals and
three free throws for a total of
1!» points. The speed of the Card
offense so bewildered the Jaysee
Quintet that time after time Palmer
was free in the hole, where a
quick pass and a sucker shot meant
two points. Bill Meade played a ;
gcaif- game at ■ the .other forward!
position, but Edelen, lanky Card
center, was slightly off form Satur
day night, being somewhat erratic
in bis passing.
In the second half of the contest, j
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw put in j
nearly a complete new team which :
held Menlo almost as easily as the .
regulars did. Tom Cordry, sub for- j
ward and former Hayward High 1
star, turned in some good work for !
the Cards.
For the losers, Tod was probably I
the outstanding performer on the |
floor, while I'ngar, small forward, |
did some good shooting and a j
whole lpt, of not-so-gpod shooting, j
The Menlo guards were not fast
enough to stop the Card forwards, j
who dribbled around and through
them almost at will.
Next week, the Cards will take i
en the Stockton High School five, j
Stockton holds a victory over the j
College of Pacific frosh, who the j
baby Redshirts beat so bad last j
week, and a more recent win over j
Poly High of San- Francisco.
Menlo Junior College's highly
touted basketball team provided
little opposition for Coach Jimmy
Bradshaw's Stanford freshmen here
Saturday night, the Cards winning
easily by a score of 47 to 15. The
baby Redshirts grabbed the lead
early in the first period and were
never headed alter t hat, the score
