# THE 						FIGHTING FIRST BASEMAN.
## Great Shires Stops Spohrer in Fourth in Saturday Night Bout, His First Fight Since Reinstatement 
### Feg Murray, '16 
The ever present Arthur (the
Oreat) Shires is vvitli us again,
this time in the guise of a pre
liminary lighter on the Christmas
fund card at Madison Square Gar
dent on December 9. Oh yes, Art
Shires loves to fight. You baseball
fans will remember well how twice
last season he got into a row with
the White Sox manager, Lena
Blackburne, and was each time sus
pended from the ball club. Well,
Shires laughed hist, for the man
ager got the air, while Shires is
looked upon as the regular White
Sox first baseman for 1930. But he'll
be under Donie Bush next year,
who is one manager who doesn't
stand any fooling on the part of
the ball players he bosses!
A recent A,P. announcement from
Chicago says that the Great Shires
will also go in for basketball, a
game at which he says he is very
good. While not playing guard for
a semi-pro team in the Windy City
the Bad Boy from Texas will tight
a few professional bouts and think
about the baseball days to come,

when he will thrill tlio crowds at
American League parks, and of thn
honors he won on I lie gridiron in
the past. What? Didn't you know
that the Great Shires could play
foot.ha 11 too? Well, listen to this!
At Waxahachie High School,
Texas, which Art attended a few
years ago, they still talk about a
game Shires won against Hillsboro
High. Little Arthur's 53 yard drop
kick with the proverbial "minute
to pay" decided the contest, 9 to 7.
Shires started his career as
White Sox first baseman by crash
ing out a triple over Ira Flag
stead's head in Boston. He ended
the season with a record of numer
ous fights, two suspensions, and a
batting average of \312, acquired
by making 110 hits in 353 times at
hat. In his last battle with his man
ager, in September, Traveling Sec
retary Lou Barbour's thumb was
badly bitten, but Shires explained
that Blackburne did it by mistake,
thinking it was his! His weekly
radio talks to "his public" were a
feature of (he season.

ous fights, two suspensions, and a
batting average of \312, acquired
by making 110 hits in 353 times at
hat. In his last battle with his man
ager, in September, Traveling Sec
retary Lou Barbour's thumb was
badly bitten, but Shires explained
that Blackburne did it by mistake,
thinking it was his! His weekly
radio talks to "his public" were a
feature of (he season.

The ever present Arthur (the
Oreat) Shires is vvitli us again,
this time in the guise of a pre
liminary lighter on the Christmas
fund card at Madison Square Gar
dent on December 9. Oh yes, Art
Shires loves to fight. You baseball
fans will remember well how twice
last season he got into a row with
the White Sox manager, Lena
Blackburne, and was each time sus
pended from the ball club. Well,
Shires laughed hist, for the man
ager got the air, while Shires is
looked upon as the regular White
Sox first baseman for 1930. But he'll
be under Donie Bush next year,
who is one manager who doesn't
stand any fooling on the part of
the ball players he bosses!
A recent A,P. announcement from
Chicago says that the Great Shires
will also go in for basketball, a
game at which he says he is very
good. While not playing guard for
a semi-pro team in the Windy City
the Bad Boy from Texas will tight
a few professional bouts and think
about the baseball days to come,

when he will thrill tlio crowds at
American League parks, and of thn
honors he won on I lie gridiron in
the past. What? Didn't you know
that the Great Shires could play
foot.ha 11 too? Well, listen to this!
At Waxahachie High School,
Texas, which Art attended a few
years ago, they still talk about a
game Shires won against Hillsboro
High. Little Arthur's 53 yard drop
kick with the proverbial "minute
to pay" decided the contest, 9 to 7.
Shires started his career as
White Sox first baseman by crash
ing out a triple over Ira Flag
stead's head in Boston. He ended
the season with a record of numer
ous fights, two suspensions, and a
batting average of \312, acquired
by making 110 hits in 353 times at
hat. In his last battle with his man
