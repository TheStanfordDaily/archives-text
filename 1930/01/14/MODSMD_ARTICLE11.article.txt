# DEADLINE SET TODAY BY QUAD FOR FILING OF SENIOR RECORDS
## 
### 
Senior records for the Quad that
! are not handed in today will not
j lie printed, it was stated at the
j Editorial office of the Quad last
| night. The importance of this stale
! ment was stressed because of t lie
fact that many seniors who are
prominent in campus life have
failed to turn them in.
Fraternities and eating clubs
should have their pictures taken
immediately, the statement con
finued, since the photographer will
j leave on January 29. Presidents of
! these organizations are also urged
j to turn in their posters as soon as
| possible.
Those students who have had
I their pictures taken and have not
j turned in the proofs are warned
that an arbitrary choice will he
J made if they are not turned in im-
I mediately.
