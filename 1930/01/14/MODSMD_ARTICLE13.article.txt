CHICAGO, Jail. 13 (#).—Chicv
go's city couficil .still was deadlocked
tonight over its 1930 budget, 25,(11)0
city employees still were awaiting pay
checks, and the president of the
board of education was predicting the
'closing of the metropolis' schools,
j Aldermanic leaders, the corporation
counsel, Silas 11. Strawn (of the
j Citizens' Rescue Committee)-, and
others, representing Both sides of the
controversy over the nature of the
budget, conferred and reported "just
friendly discussion." The afternoon
newspapers said, however, they had
: learned definitely the conferees were
unable to agree.
Administration forces insist the
city council cannot amend items ni
the budget which were not vetoed by
the mayor and their insistence is
i backed by a legal opinion from the
corporation counsel which says that
amendment of the items is illegal.
The opposing forces are determined
the budget shall not exceed antici
pated tax collections, and in line with
this determination they seek to trans
fer necessary economics from the po-
I lice and tire departments to other
brant lies of (lie public service. It 'was
economics in the police and hie de
1 partments, calling for the di mi sal
j of hundreds of men, that the mayor
vetoed.
The finance committee of the board
j of education continued work on the
school budget with a confessed feel
ing of futility. President H. Wallace
Caldwell of the hoard said
"The school system is bankrupt and
| the schools probably will be closed in
!a few weeks. There is no money
| available and 1 have learned definitely
j that tax anticipation warrants can
• not be sold."
