# STANFORD GRID CAPTAIN SOUGHT AS MISSING SON
## 
### 
Is Captain-elect Ray E. Tan
dy of the Stanford football team
going about under a false name?
A pathetic letter was received
yesterday by Dean Culver's of
fice from Olaf Tande of Oklit,
Minnesota, asking if the Tandy,
whom one of his neighbors had
heard over the radio as playing
on the Stanford football squad,
was his thirty-year-old son, Mal
vin S. Tande, "sometimes writ
ten Tandy," who left home sev
eral years ago and has not been
heard of since.
Ray F. Tandy, however, wa.
born in Wichita, Kansas, the son
of John Tandy, and is not old
enough to tit the description.
Dean Culver would appreciate
any information regarding Mai
vin S. Tande's whereabouts.
