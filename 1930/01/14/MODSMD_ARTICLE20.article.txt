## 
### 
GENEVA. Jan. 1) (IP) —Palestine
and Irak furnished the tirst flurry to- j
night in the deliberations of the 48th
session of the Council of the League j
of Nations which began this morning, j
A proposal by Great Britain, the l
I mandate power, to seek solution of
the wailing wall controversy between j
the Arabs and Jews through research I
by a special commission received a
check when the permanent mandates j
commission reported unfavorably.)
j The British foreign secretary was |
I ready to support his proposal with a j
i long exposition of the difficulties aris- i
j ing out of the conflicting racial and |
| religious claims, but the C ouncil de-j
cided to postpone the subject to a
sitting later this week when more j
time, will l»c available.
The. question of entry by Irak into j
the League, as advocated by Great :
Britain which is also mandatory pow- i
er for that ancient biblical land, grew
to importance when il was seen that j
lil involved the new problem of how j
to get rid of a mandate. Since there!
was 110 precedent for such procedure j
I the Council proceeded cautiously and j
I asked its permanent mandate, com '
| mission to advise it l nily as the situ I
ation develops and the time ap- ■
I proaches for Irak to stand 011 its own
feet.
