### 
At last the "nasty truth about that Stanford-West Point football
game" has been revealed and the informer is j. J. Shields of Newark,
New Jersey, in a letter to the New York Evening Post, which is
printed in an adjoining column. Incidentally, Mr. Shields has lived
both in California and in the East and from this he, living in New
ark, has gained sufficient experience in these parts to judge a grid
iron match.
"When the Stanford players, with SAYACiE BRUTALITY,
knocked Cagle cold and put half the West Point regulars out of
action, there was more involved than the questionable sportsmanship
of disabling a competitor with few reserves," is Mr. Shields' intro
duction to the topic that such bruising tactics on the part ofWestern
players against the East is just an indication of the "hatred" carried
in the hearts of Californians for those of the Atlantic Seaboard. Far
be it from the Stanford. Daily to suggest that Stanford covered
C agle so efficiently that the Eastern star was unable to demonstrate
his so-called skill and that he failed to play the game as he had been
expected to. Cagle himself admitted to friends here that Stanford
showed fine sportsmanship in the Army game.
Mr. Shields, it must be remembered, satisfied his brutal instincts
by listening to the radio announcer of one of the two transconti
nental chains that broadcast the game. Undoubtedly, he lost money
on the game or maybe he was unable to enjoy his stay in wonderful
California.
