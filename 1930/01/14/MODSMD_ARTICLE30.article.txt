# AN EDUCATIONAL UTOPIA
## 
### 
Now conies Dr. Daniel E. Phillips, Denver University professor
with plans for a new Utopian university wherein there would he no
grades, no entrance examinations, no graduation exercises.
If Dr. Phillips had his way professors who are proficient in re
search, but not in teaching, would he replaced by those who teach
regardless of the research work they do. Dr. Phillips would abolish
the system of classifying students "like ears of cornâ€”good, bad,
and indifferent."
Xo doubt these ideas of the Denver savant are a bit extreme to
be taken on their face value. Those of us who are familiar with the
present machinery of America's factories of learning can hardly
imagine such a thing as he proposes.
But there can be no doubt that the Doctor is headed in the right
direction. If we can somehow strike a medium between his fancies
and discouraging reality, the educational system of this country will
be in happy straits.
