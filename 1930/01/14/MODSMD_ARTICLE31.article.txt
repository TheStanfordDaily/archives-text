# LOW PRICES IN THE SOUTH
## 
### 
From our enlightened friends, the Trojans, comes word that
coffee in the recently erected, expensive Union at Southern Cali
fornia has been reduced to the joyous price of five cents. Soup, too,
has gone the way of steaming Java and is retailing for a nickel.
Stanford's Union, burdened by the complexities of a handy
system, must demand ten cents for coffee, fifteen rents for soup, and
thirty cents for a hot roast beef sandwich.
