# A 						UTOPIAN SUGGESTION

### 
Construction of twenty garages to accommodate automobiles
owned by Roble women is a forward step toward building similar
structures near other campus dormitories.
Shelter for the property of automobile owners here is noticeably
lacking. Each year hundreds of dollars in depreciation is the price
autoists pay because sufficient housing is not available.
Sooner or later it is hoped that the Administration will furnish
the campus with the necessary garages.
