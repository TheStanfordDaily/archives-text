# C.K. "THINKS" AGAIN
## 
### 
At the meeting at Stanford University on Saturday of 250 mem
bers of the National Student Federation of America, Robert Keith
of the Los Angeles section of the University of California branded
the honor system among students as "the most complete failure ever
seen."'
This precipitated a general discussion, which resulted in an
agreement that it is a failure because of the reluctance of students
to inform on each other.
l or that, the students are to be commended.
Why should any plan be termed an "honor" system by which
men and women are expected to dishonor themselves by becoming
contemptible tattlers ?â€”Sacrawcnto Bcc.
