FULL MEASURE, by Hans Otto
Storm. Mac Mi II an, New York.
With a radio in almost every
home, "we modern. " are likely in
j consider the accomplishment , of
the pioneers of the wireless as an
cient history ami lei it go :it that.
In his hook, "Full Measure," flans
'Otto Storm, himself a radio eiiri
| neer, has done mueh to show the
I real romance that if. connected
; with lhe efforts of ihe let hnlcian
' ni their search for improvement
oil the radio.
The story abounds in characters;
if lias almost too many characters.
I The plot revolves about the pre
war development <»l tin* radio and
; the part that fiendrick Vardan and
John Manley had in that work, but
i there are so many little choppy
I episodes that break into the thread
| of the story that it is nearly lost,
j time after time, ii reads more like
; a serial story than a novel, but the
' saving grace oi the whole book is
; that every chapter is interesting,
I regardless of how it breaks into
i the scheme of things.
Yardan and Manley are the best
| developed characters in the story
j—undoubtedly because the author
| is chiefly interested in the actual
radio work accomplished by the
; two men. Nevertheless, his interest
i in technical work does not prevent
j him from putting a lot of sharp
I observations about life in general
i into the story. He seems to have
pltoty of ability as an author, and
I somehow, the reader gels the idea
• that most of the story has been
I the actual experience of the author
i and his associates.
Though the language used is
I technical for* the average readei
j the author has attempted to use
i terms about radio that will be un
derstood by the layman The story
j ends in a vague sort of way, but
I even that does not materially lessen
1 the interest that the reader feel.:.
I It is a worthwhile book which :-Uves
j us glimpses of the dynamic char-

I acter of big business and the tire
| Un: ineu who run the machinery,
'i'liore is jusi enough of rani an tie
love story in the hook partially to
explain the ambitions of the char
acters, though the love of mastery
I is shown to be most important.

THREE LIVE GHOSTS—At the
VarEity Theatre.
Alter a long siege of musical
coined ies, one more gorgeous ihan
I In' other. Throe Live Ghosts, lie
f ides being u most amusing com
: edy, conies us a great, relief. This
picture should prove that a talkie
< mi be a success without a bevy of
I chorus girls and a theme song.
I Strictly speaking, Three Live
Ghosts might be called a war pic
lure, but there are none of the
| lengthy, harrowing, scenes at the
front. The play opens at the an-
J p.ouncement o£ the Armistice. Three
' : oldiers, buddies, report for their
Lack pay. One of them is shell
shocked and has lost his memory.
The other two are informed that
they have been killed in action and
then the fun begins.
Claud Allister, as Spooky, the
shell-shocked soldier, walks away
with the honors ol' the picture. He
plays his difficult role excellently,
creating many of the laughs and
at thf ime time being pathetic.
Spooky gets his pals, Jimmy and
Hill, into trouble through a kidnap
ping and a jewel rufebery. They
stick by him and consequently all
of them, including Bill's giri and
Jimmy's girl and step-mother, are
thrown into jail. An opportune
policeman's stick brings Spooky's
memory back and all ends happily.
The outcome of the story is eas
ily guessed, but the obvious ending
does nothing to detract from the
picture. In fact it relieves the audi
ence from all fears and one can
settle down to enjoy the show.
