# EASTERNER CHARGES CALIFORNIA WITH VICIOUS JEALOUSY, HATRED

(Editor's Note—The following let

! To the Editor of the Evening Post.:
Sir —This is the right time for
t some one to tell tin* misty truth
| about that Stanford-West Point
football game Hist Saturday, as well
I as something about (California and
i Eastern competition in general. 1
have lived both in the East and in
| California. I know whereof I : .peak,
1 and here it is:
When the Stanford players, with
| savage brutality, knocked Cagle
j cold and put half the West Point
regulars out of action, there was
more involved than Ihe queslion
j able sportsmanship of disabling a
j Competitor with a few reserves.
Back of the bone ( rushing tactics
| of Stanford was the desire of all
; California to hit the entire East
I through Cagle and the cither West
I Point players.
You know, California tells ihe
i world about her wonderful climate.
' The radio announcer did it last
! Saturday and did plenty of it. But
j California hasn't much else beside
climate. She needs population,
1 wealth, industry, and commerce,
j all found so Abundantly in the East.
I On the other hand nowhere in the
! world will you lind a more vicious
provincialism than in California,
California is jealous of the East,
; jealous to the point ot hatred, and
j especially of New York, so repre
! srntative of the East. Consequently
there is a certain vicarious satis
faction in seeing Eastern football
j teams defeated and Eastern foot
! ball players beaten up and knocked
| unconscious.
"Eastern" is a term of reproach
in San Eraucisco and I'll gladly
j furnish details to any one who
! wants to know. Nowhere but in
j California is ii coir idered disgrace
ful to any one who wants to know.
Nowhere but in California is it con
sidered disgraceful to live or have
your business in New York. East
ern products are referred to in Eos
Angeles as "importations from Ihe
I East."
The difference between Notre
' name-West Point and Stanford
' West point is this: Notre Maine
j plays hard and plays to win, and
often does win. But Notre Dame is

. not carrying the hatred of Indiana
i against New York and the Atlantic
seaboard. It's just a football game,
| to beat, the cadets for the honor of
| old Notre Dame and that sort of
j thing. But Stanford or any other
' California college, against any
i team from the East, is vindicating
! the native and adopted sons of
| California against the East and al-
I most anything is justified. So we'll
j irsi break a lew ribs, legs, and
I collarbones to show them.
There is much to be said in favor
| of discontinuing Eastern competi
j tion against California's mass at
j tempts at murder. Nothing I know
i of against, except to please Cali-
I fornia.
