# FRESHMAN QUINTET TO MEET STOCKTON HIGH HERE TONIGHT
## 
### Don Oswill 
With two consecutive and over
whelming victories over highly ,
rated basketball teams to its credit,
Stanford's freshman quintet is ex
pected to defeat Stockton High
School when the two meet here at
7:30 o'clock tonight in the Pavilion.
The Cards have shown some ex
ceptionally fine teamwork in their 1
last games, and, despite the fine ;
early season record made by the
Stockton five, are rated ;i big edge.
Viewed from the sidelines, 1
Palmer, Meade, and Hancock have
been tlm most consistent shots on
the Card squad, being responsible
for the majority of the points t
amassed this season. Palmer and i
Meade lean slightly toward the !
fiasliy type of player, both good on i
angle shots and reliable from I
closer positions. Hancock, while i
somewhat slower, can be found in
the midst of nearly every heavy
play on the floor. He is adept at •
getting the ball off the backboards
and shines when the going gets
rough, lidelen will start at center,,
while Tw:,7 will hold down the
ether guard position.
The fast-breaking offense which
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw has con
centrated upon has been one of
the biggest assets of the frosli
team. This was nl>l y demonstrated
against Menlo Junior College lasl
week, when the Cards were away
and scoring before the Jaysee
guards got underway. The baby 1
Red shirts are also the possessors;
ol a stout five-man defense which
ehticeil more than one team to do
most of its shooting from well be
hind the foul line.
Perhaps the most impressive
showing of the Stockton Tarzans
this season was against San Pran
cisco Poly High. The Tarzans eas
ily defeated the Bay City quintet
last Saturday by a wcore of to j
12 on ihe preceding day, Stockton
held Alameda High without a
single point during the entire first
half, vi<l easily copjxml tin* contest.
Carl Stevens, rangy center, has
been the outstanding man on the
Stockton five this year. He was
high-point man in the recent con
test again: i the Poly Parrots, and \
is rated as the main cog in the !
Tarzan offense.
The probable line-ups for to- j
night's game are:
Stanford —Palmer and Meade, j
foiwards; Edelen, center; Han- i
cock and Tway, guards.
Stockton Schiffnian and Siev- |
eis, forwards; Stevens, center; j
' Pinkel and Milslavich, guards.
