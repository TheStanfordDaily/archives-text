# SORORITY PAPAS DO RUSHING BUSINESS IN NUGGET SEARCH
## 
### 
Fairy godmothers—or rather
godfathers—still exist. Certain
sorority houses can testify that
a group of men designating
themselves as the "rushing pa
pas" seem to have adopted them
and anxiously phone or tele
graph after each party to ask
about the "nuggets."
Hardly a night passes with
out the sororities being waked
up in the dark of night to an
swer the bell only to have an
other telegram from the "rush
ing papas" wishing them luck
and the best of health.
Interest in the mythical "class"
has run so high that certain
"papas" arc backing their house
in the coin of the realm. Among
the phone numbers dialed by the
"rushing papas" while calling
the favored few are:
6195, and 7177.
