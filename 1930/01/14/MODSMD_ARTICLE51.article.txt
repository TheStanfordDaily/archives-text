"WEATHER — FAIR WITH DIS
TINCT CARDINAL HUE IN
FAR WESTERN SECTOR"

The recent rumblings from the
executive body of the I C.l-A. uncut
the proposal to split tlie annual
meet into two separate affairs, one
consisting of track events and one
of field events, are indicative of
the Wait's growing discontent with
continual Western supremacy. The
aforesaid rumblings may or may
not eventually crystallize into ac
tion, but the future does not prom
ise any relief lor our Eastern
brethren.
What irks the boys from the At
lantic Seaboard most of all is the
fact that the West's triumphs in
eight of the past nine years have
all been built on superiority in the
field events, and more .specifically,
in the weights. Glance at Ihe list:
The present intercollegiate tille
holder in the shot put is Harlow
Rothert of Stanford; Ihe discus
champion, Eric Krenz of Stanford;
the javelin king, Leo Kibby, also of
Stanford. In I!I2S, Krenz held both
the allot and.discus titles, and I In'
years previous are tilled vviili coast
champions in those, events- lioff
man and I lartranft of Stanford,
Gerkeu and.Neufehlt of California,
Houser of Southern California, and
others, is it any wonder the Mast
weeps ?
But the trouble is that it looks
very much as though the Pacific
Slope is going .to be top dog in
those events for some time to
come, if Stanford prospects are any
criterion. Krenz and Rothert re
turn to Cambridge fdr the third
and last time this spring to defend
their titles, but in the class of 1933
are two youths who may be ready
to step into their shoes next year
and continue the Western dynasty.
The two flush from whom great
tilings are expected are Harry
(Hercules) La Horde and "Nelson
Gray, both of whom, incidentally,
served a term at tackle on Husky
Hunt's freshman football squad.
Laßorde, a .graduate of Lowell
High School, San Francisco, was
the interscholastic discus chain
pion in 1 !>2S, with a mark of 14a
feet to his credit. Gray, wearing
the colors of Chaffey Union High,
whirled the 12-pound shot out some
60 odd feet to take first honors in
the state meet last year. Which is
fair country weight tossing in any
man's land, and bodes well for the
Cardinal.
One hundred and forty-five l'eet
in the discus will win a first place
in many collegiate dual affairs this
year and for many years to come.
Wi hesitate to classify Gray's mark
in terms of the Hi-pound pellet,
but it should be plenty far. And
when the Card miracle man, R. L.
"Dink" Templeton, '2d, gets
through with*those two boys, the
sky's the limit!

Hunt's freshman football squad.
Laßorde, a .graduate of Lowell
High School, San Francisco, was
the interscholastic discus chain
pion in 1 !>2S, with a mark of 14a
feet to his credit. Gray, wearing
the colors of Chaffey Union High,
whirled the 12-pound shot out some
60 odd feet to take first honors in
the state meet last year. Which is
fair country weight tossing in any
man's land, and bodes well for the
Cardinal.
One hundred and forty-five l'eet
in the discus will win a first place
in many collegiate dual affairs this
year and for many years to come.
Wi hesitate to classify Gray's mark
in terms of the Hi-pound pellet,
but it should be plenty far. And
when the Card miracle man, R. L.
"Dink" Templeton, '2d, gets
through with*those two boys, the
sky's the limit!

The recent rumblings from the
executive body of the I C.l-A. uncut
the proposal to split tlie annual
meet into two separate affairs, one
consisting of track events and one
of field events, are indicative of
the Wait's growing discontent with
continual Western supremacy. The
aforesaid rumblings may or may
not eventually crystallize into ac
tion, but the future does not prom
ise any relief lor our Eastern
brethren.
What irks the boys from the At
lantic Seaboard most of all is the
fact that the West's triumphs in
eight of the past nine years have
all been built on superiority in the
field events, and more .specifically,
in the weights. Glance at Ihe list:
The present intercollegiate tille
holder in the shot put is Harlow
Rothert of Stanford; Ihe discus
champion, Eric Krenz of Stanford;
the javelin king, Leo Kibby, also of
Stanford. In I!I2S, Krenz held both
the allot and.discus titles, and I In'
years previous are tilled vviili coast
champions in those, events- lioff
man and I lartranft of Stanford,
Gerkeu and.Neufehlt of California,
Houser of Southern California, and
others, is it any wonder the Mast
weeps ?
But the trouble is that it looks
very much as though the Pacific
Slope is going .to be top dog in
those events for some time to
come, if Stanford prospects are any
criterion. Krenz and Rothert re
turn to Cambridge fdr the third
and last time this spring to defend
their titles, but in the class of 1933
are two youths who may be ready
to step into their shoes next year
and continue the Western dynasty.
The two flush from whom great
tilings are expected are Harry
(Hercules) La Horde and "Nelson
Gray, both of whom, incidentally,
served a term at tackle on Husky
Hunt's freshman football squad.
