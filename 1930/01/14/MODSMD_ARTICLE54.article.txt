# Redshirts Return From Los Angeles
## CARD HOOPSTERS DRILL FOR GAME AGAINST TROJANS U.S.C. Quintet Reputed To Be More Powerful Than Uclans 
### Stephen Dietrich 
! Back on the Farm from their
| disastrous Westwood invasion,
, Coach Husky Hunt's basketball live
I settled down yesterday afternoon
1 to four days of stiff preparation for
another hectic reception down in
the land of Troy this corning week
end.
The U.S.C. quintet, which is
I scheduled to face (lie Cards in a.
I double-header at Los Angeles, is
reputed to have stronger man-.
I power than the U.C.L.A. Bruin
i squad, the green five thai so nealiy
lining up a new high scoring Con
! ference record against Stanford on
i Saturday last.
Although held to an even break
1 l:y California in their first Confer
; i nce tilts and defeated several
i times oyer, the holidays, the Tro
; jaus possess one of the tallest
I teams on the Coast, the regulars
I ranging from six feet to six and
; four inches, and are being bally
j booed by Southern scribes as the
! live to press the pace leading for
i the league title.
Hunt Optimistic
j However, Coach Hunt has high
j hopes that his charges will slip
j over a couple of unexpected wins
! on the lanky men from Troy, as
i Iho latter lack the speed of Ihe
I Westwood five, are less experi
i enced, and are further handicapped
jby t he installation of a new coach
I and a "new system of play.
if the Cards can regain the form
displayed in their own record
l>r» aking episode, the recent Pacific
I basket-shooting orgy, they should
1 have no trouble climbing out of
| the cellar position. But if the Tro
i jans treat them as roughly as did
U.C.L.A., Hunt's players might as
well hang up their suits for Ihe
, rest "of the season, as far as title
; chances go.
In' speaking of the TT.C.L.A. rout,
Hunt said yesterday thai Ihe
Bruins were the hottest team he
i has seen in action, bar none, and
sank baskets from all angles of
the court with the greatest of ease.
"My players were not so bad,
though they could have shown more
i stuff, as were the Bruins good."
U.C.L.A. Good
U.C.L.A. is better than a ma
, jority of the teams entered in the
National Basketball playoffs, ac
cording to Hunt, who went back
to the Kansas tourney Inst winter.
Yet, he does not think that Satur
i day's score in any way indicates
! the real strength between the
1 Cards and the Bruins.
The Farm mentor was especially
impressed with the playing of one
Lubin, at center, for the Southern
i outfit. Towering up five inches
j above tlie six-foot level, the elon
gated Bruin pivot man got the
i jump at the tip-off nine times out
| of ten, besides recovering the ball
; off the backboard all evening.
Before concluding that the
i Cards will give Coach Caddy
| Works' lads a tough battle when
they meet on the Farm court next
i month, Hunt added that "the
| Bruins have been pointing for Stan
ford ever since their defeats by
the latter last winter, while Ihe
; Stanford players have been occu
pied with football, track, and other
athlel ics."
