Chuck Weesner, Larry Hall,
j Larry Driscoll, Ted Faston, and
! Bob .VlcKeilip were all on the
' courts yesterday brandishing rac
quets to keep (he blood from freez

ing in their veins. Coach Ragan re
marked upon the improvement of
Weesner's form over List quarter.
McKellip, who over the weekend
was mixed up in his second auto
mobile smash-up of the year, gave
evidence of a few cuts about the
face, but other than that no dis
ablement.
"The absence of Doeg, who will
not be registered this year, though
of course it will weaken the team,
will have a good effect upon tlie
rest of the players in stimulating
competition for the top places on
the squad," is the opinion of Ragan,
coach. Doeg is working for Spa Id
ing Brothers in Los Angeles, where
Ray Casey, another racquet flash,
helped him to secure a. job.
In addition to ranking matches
among the varsity first ten, there
is a round-robin tourney provided
for the next eighteen on the squad.
The top man of this group is en
titled to challenge number 10 in
the first group.
