# Heavy Rainfall Causes Large Rise In Lagunita
## 
### 
Stanfordites who had despaired
of painting their canoes or resur
recting their bathing suits will be
relieved to hear that Lagunita is
rapidly taking on a liquid form.
The lake, which is formed by the
overflow from SearsvHle, profited
by the .16 inch of rain yesterday.
Although the season's fall has been
only 4.74 inches, far lower than
last year, one is encouraged in the
belief that the boathouse will soon
have a front yard more suggestive
of Venice than before.
