## 
### 
WASHINGTON, D.C., Jan. 13
(/P). â€”Prohibition Commissioner L)o
-| ran believes the expenditure, of more
i than $15,000,000 for federal prohi
! bition enforcement would be unwise
j because of congestion of (lie federal
j court dockets.
The House appropriations eommil
I tee was guided by the commissioner's
opinion in reporting the annual
Treasury-Postoftice supply bill to the
Mouse today, but it allowed for the
strengthening of the Coast Guard by
j allotting $32,123.040, an increase of
! $2,452,000 over the current year.
"We could make a 50 per cent in
| create in the number of persons ar-
I rested," Doran said, "but under pre:,
ent conditions it would merely eon
I the courts still further and iur-
I (her complicate the situation."
