# SPEAKER IS ACCLAIMED AT LECTURE
## Garland Talks on British Authors' Works to Large Crowd 
### 
"George Bernard Shaw is one of
j the most misunderstood of all mod
| ern men," said Hamlin Garland,
j prominent American author, in an
[ address last night in the Assembly
j Hall. More than 400 people at-
I tended the lecture.
"Shaw suys those savage things
! for newspapers with a laugh. He
j doesn't expect people to believe
| them, lie says that he sees things
| as they are and that we see them
1 upside down."
j In an hour of reminiscences, Gar
land, a venerabie iiteratus some
! what resembling Mark Twain in
j appearance, related many interest
! ing tales of personal experiences
I with Joseph Conrad, Sir Arthur
| Conan Doyle, Sir James Barrie,
1 and George Bernard Shaw.
, Shortly before the end of the
j last century Garland made his tirat
j trip to England. "I had two meals
| on the way over," he said; "one
j shortly after we sailed out of
j Sandy Hook, the other just as the
j green shores of England hove into
j sight."
Garland, at an important ban
! quet of prominent English writers,
j found himself seated next to Sir
| Henry Stanley, noted African ex
j plorer and at first a "sour and im
| penetrable" dinner partner. Gar
| land, at a loss as to means of
! starting conversation, finally que
! lied Stanley as to the correct pro
| nunciation of "tsetse" fly. It proved
j an "open sesame" for an enjoyable
: session with the African traveler.
Barrie was characterized as "a
! shy little man with brown liair*and
| a high forehead." Conversation
i with him was difficult, but charm
j ing when once started.
"Barrie has never written a line
I which looks downward," Garland
I said. "He is always original and is
! the most beloved and richest of all
J English writers."
