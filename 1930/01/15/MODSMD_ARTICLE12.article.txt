George Bernard Shaw and Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle are two of
England's oddest literary figures.
! Tliis is the belief of Hamlin Gar
| land, prominent writer of American
life in the midland regions and
speaker last night at a lecture on
i his personal reminiscences of fam
j ous English authors.
"Shaw, a man of amazing vitality
for his extreme age, still looms
foremost as an important writer in
i England," Garland told a Daily
| representative. "As a friend, one
could never ask for a more sincere
one than Shaw. But I certainly
pity the man who must bear the
brunt of Shaw's scorching critical
: pen.
Doyle Not Mysterious
j "Conan Doyle, known to Ann• ri
cans as a supreme author of niys
j lory tales, lives a life extremely
! opposite that reflected in his writ
' ings. He is a big, hearty Englisher,
I always jovial and amiable,
i "Doyle's work in psychic re
search for many years was on a
scientific basis, hut lately he has
become inclined to abandon soien

{ 1 ific methods of experimentation
j and has assumed almost a religious
! aspect in his work."
Thirty-two years ago Garland
| traveled in England where he made
' intimate acquaintances with Kip
ling. Zangwill, Barrie, Henry
j James, Hardy, Doyle, and Shaw.
