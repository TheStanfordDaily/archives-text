# CAPITAL LOBBY 'SIMPLE GRAFT' SAYS CARAWAY
## Investigation Committee Head Charges Huge Expenditures Hoover Absolved of Blame In Sugar Controversy 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14. (/P)â€”
Lobbying activities in Washington
were described to tlie Senate today
as "simple graft," by Chairman
C i.iaway, of the Lobby Investigat
ing Committee, as he presented a
report estimating that more than
$400,000 had been expended by
those interested in the pending
sugar tariff controversy.
"Businessmen might just as well
go to "a palm reader or a crystal
gazer and have the future of legis
lation foretold," Senator Caraway
observed after the committee's re
port was read, "as to put their
money in the so-called publicity
agents and these lobbyists we see
here in Washington."
The report absolved President
Hoover of any impropriety in con
nection with any attempt he might
have made to bring sugar interests
together on a proposed sliding
scale for sugar duties.
$1,000,000 Spent
In his speech to the Senate,
Caraway said it "might be safely
said that $1,000,000 had been spent
to influence public opinion on the
sugar duties in the tariff bill.
The lobby committee, a little
while before, had started an in
vestigation into the activities of
New York importers. It heard a
denial from E. R. Pickrell, of the
General Dye Stuff Corporation, of
New York, that lit' had used the
offi '0 df Senator King, Democrat,
Utah, as headquarters during con
sideration of the tariff bill.
