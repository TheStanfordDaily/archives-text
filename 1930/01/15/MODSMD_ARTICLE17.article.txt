Being more a comedy of situa
tion than one of character or of
! lines, "The Mistress of the Inn,"
i the classic play by Carlo Goldoni,
to he given here by the Dramatic
: Council on February 7, contains
' many possibilities which do not
i actually appear in the script,
i The very circumstances of the
! action and the mixture of charac
ters make "The Mistress" a rol
i licking comedy which moves swift
: ly through the amours of Mirando
| lina, -the mistress of the inn, at
1 whose feet woo live men of totally
! different types. The varied metli
; ods of approach employed by these
suitors, the manner in which they
1 cross each other's paths, the as
-1 tonishing favor which the puzzling
! "locandiera" heaps on one and then
\ another, and the appearance of two
! actresses to complicate the already
I involved circumstances at the inn
' all go to make tins classic comedy
extremely entertaining.
Complicated Comedy
Particularly good are the scenes
I in which Ortensia and Deianira,
! the two actresses, parading as the
| Baroness Ortensia del Poggio from
i Palermo and the Countess Deianira
! dal Sole from Rome, exercise their
I newly elevated charms on the in
| riGcent Count d'Albafiorita and
i Marquis di Forlipopoli. Deianira,
: the less enterprising of the pair, is
comical beyond comparison as she
boshes plan after plan of the in
genious Ortensia; and the latter,
with all her airs and pretenses, is
i a perfect companion-player to
! Deianira.
The fact that Fabricius, general
household servant at the inn, as
well as the Cavalier's personal at
' tendant. is very fond of Mirando
lina complicates matters; as does
j also the fact that the Cavalier di
i liiplafratta is a woman-hater,
j Gifts play a large part in the
suit of "la locandiera" (the mis
tress of the inn) and particularly
I amusing is the circumstance of a
j golden flask which is passed from
hand to hand in the last act, ae
| conipanied by many truthful and
| untruthful remarks. An almost
! duel between the Count and the
Cavalier puts some comic action
j in this act and closes the play with
a surprise and a flourish.

Complicated Comedy
Particularly good are the scenes
I in which Ortensia and Deianira,
! the two actresses, parading as the
| Baroness Ortensia del Poggio from
i Palermo and the Countess Deianira
! dal Sole from Rome, exercise their
I newly elevated charms on the in
| riGcent Count d'Albafiorita and
i Marquis di Forlipopoli. Deianira,
: the less enterprising of the pair, is
comical beyond comparison as she
boshes plan after plan of the in
genious Ortensia; and the latter,
with all her airs and pretenses, is
i a perfect companion-player to
! Deianira.
The fact that Fabricius, general
household servant at the inn, as
well as the Cavalier's personal at
' tendant. is very fond of Mirando
lina complicates matters; as does
j also the fact that the Cavalier di
i liiplafratta is a woman-hater,
j Gifts play a large part in the
suit of "la locandiera" (the mis
tress of the inn) and particularly
I amusing is the circumstance of a
j golden flask which is passed from
hand to hand in the last act, ae
| conipanied by many truthful and
| untruthful remarks. An almost
! duel between the Count and the
Cavalier puts some comic action
j in this act and closes the play with
a surprise and a flourish.
Being more a comedy of situa
tion than one of character or of
! lines, "The Mistress of the Inn,"
i the classic play by Carlo Goldoni,
to he given here by the Dramatic
: Council on February 7, contains
' many possibilities which do not
i actually appear in the script,
i The very circumstances of the
! action and the mixture of charac
ters make "The Mistress" a rol
i licking comedy which moves swift
: ly through the amours of Mirando

1 whose feet woo live men of totally
! different types. The varied metli
; ods of approach employed by these
suitors, the manner in which they
1 cross each other's paths, the as
-1 tonishing favor which the puzzling
! "locandiera" heaps on one and then
\ another, and the appearance of two

I involved circumstances at the inn
' all go to make tins classic comedy
extremely entertaining.
