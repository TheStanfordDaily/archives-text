# TESTING MACHINERY IS INSTALLED FOR CAMPUS ENGINEERS
## 
### 
Installation began yesterday in
the Civil Engineering laboratory of
the new Universal machine re
ceived recently from Philadelphia
for testing in tension, compression,
and bending, up to a capacity o£
200,000 pounds.
According to Professor Charles
Moser of the Civil Engineering De
partment, this modern machine is
ar important addition to the labora
tory equipment. Driven by an
eight-speed electric motor, it will
accommodate pieces in tension and
compression up to ten feet in
length, and the extension to the
weighing table will take beams up
to 16 feet.
