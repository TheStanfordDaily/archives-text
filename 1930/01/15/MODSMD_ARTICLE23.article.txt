Missionary Tells Horrors
George Andrews, a missionary
born in Kansu province and just
returned from nine months of relief
work there, said that famine, dis
ease, and exposure in Kansu,
Sliensi, and Shansi provinces had
caused one of the most terrible
situations ever experienced in
China, in which plagues of disease
and famine are common and life is
c heai>.
Failure of crops last year, and
no seeds planted for the coming
season, together with below sero
weather in the Yungtse Valley and
North China, were ascribed by An
drews as causes for the widespread
suffering.
Reduced to the lust extremity by
starving, people in Kansu province,
said Andrews, are resorting to
cannibalism. On many occasions he
had witnessed flesh carved from
bodies that lay in the roads, and
had seen it cooked and eaten by
the desperately hungry. Bugs and
insects had formed the only diet
for weeks, but they had grown
scarce when cannibalism broke out.
