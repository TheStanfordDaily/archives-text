# DOUBTING THOMASES AND GOLD NUGGETS
## 
### 
Stanford fraternities are again trying to solve their age-old prob
lem —enforcement of the rushing rules. Moses was in no worse
pickle when the lights went out than are the Creek letter organiza
tions in their present quandary.
This was clearly exemplified at a meeting of the Interfraternity
Council Monday night, which developed into a rip-snorting bull ses
sion on the crudity of the enforcement of rushing rules in past sea
sons. For once in their lives the fraternity men forgot themselves,
discarded their nefarious cloaks of suspicion, and became frank with
one another, admitting that the rules in the past were nothing but
farces.
They denounced the violations in wholesale terms and issued a
demand that-this yearV violations, of, which there ,have been far too
inafiy. bctstnpped. .-Why have lln'y nfbt lux-n reportedl
f^lieriT^y^tni^iing.in;"another' f«'+r illegal 'rushing' may find itself in
the embarrassing position of being penalized for the self-same act.
It is not only a case of dog eat dog, but who eats first.
Nothing was left unscathed by the fraternity men in their desire
to correct a loathesome situation that has cast disrepute on the name
of the University as well as that of the campus fraternity system.
The fact that there are fraternity sponsors received a great amount
of attention. As can Ik* guessed, those houses having fraternity men
in the hall were all for it. while the harshest critics were those who
have no "brothers" in Encitia. Mut nothing constructive was offered
to take the place of the present sponsorial system. The sponsors are
in a position to see that the rushing rules are enforced in so far as
they are able, if they will.
It was suggested that a heavier penalty be placed on freshmen
attending illegal parties : that they be denied the privilege of pledging
for two quarters. This seemed to meet with half-way approval.
When asked to go on a party most of the freshmen feel that they
are duty bound to accept for fear of offending good old Kappa Kega
Nails. If there was a more severe penalty inflicted on the golden
nuggets, they would think twice before accepting a bootleg invita
tion.
The situation is not wholly as hopeless as it seems, for which the
fraternity men are thanking their (ircek gods. The Interfraternity
Council has a strong set of officers, headed by Kim Dyer, who has
the qualities of leadership to prevent a repetition of last spring's
botch. It is squarely up to him to see that a plausible set of rules
is drawn up and to have the gumption to see that they are EN
FORCED.
The one promising condition as was reflected in Monday night's
session is that the fraternity men realize the seriousness of the prob
lem they arc facing and apparently are sincerely trying to find a
remedy. There is one solution that is very simple to put down on
paper—if each house was certain that the other houses would not
unhesitatingly violate their oaths and would live up to their agree
ments like gentlemen, it would not feel the necessity of stooping to
illegal rushing.
Suspicion lies at the bottom of the whole question of enforce
ment, and until fraternity men throw off their roles of Doubting
Thomases, the rushing situation at Stanford will remain a disgrace
to themselves and the University.

It is not only a case of dog eat dog, but who eats first.
Nothing was left unscathed by the fraternity men in their desire
to correct a loathesome situation that has cast disrepute on the name
of the University as well as that of the campus fraternity system.
The fact that there are fraternity sponsors received a great amount
of attention. As can Ik* guessed, those houses having fraternity men
in the hall were all for it. while the harshest critics were those who
have no "brothers" in Encitia. Mut nothing constructive was offered
to take the place of the present sponsorial system. The sponsors are
in a position to see that the rushing rules are enforced in so far as
they are able, if they will.
It was suggested that a heavier penalty be placed on freshmen
attending illegal parties : that they be denied the privilege of pledging
for two quarters. This seemed to meet with half-way approval.
When asked to go on a party most of the freshmen feel that they
are duty bound to accept for fear of offending good old Kappa Kega
Nails. If there was a more severe penalty inflicted on the golden
nuggets, they would think twice before accepting a bootleg invita
tion.
The situation is not wholly as hopeless as it seems, for which the
fraternity men are thanking their (ircek gods. The Interfraternity
Council has a strong set of officers, headed by Kim Dyer, who has
the qualities of leadership to prevent a repetition of last spring's
botch. It is squarely up to him to see that a plausible set of rules
is drawn up and to have the gumption to see that they are EN
FORCED.
The one promising condition as was reflected in Monday night's
session is that the fraternity men realize the seriousness of the prob
lem they arc facing and apparently are sincerely trying to find a
remedy. There is one solution that is very simple to put down on
paper—if each house was certain that the other houses would not
unhesitatingly violate their oaths and would live up to their agree
ments like gentlemen, it would not feel the necessity of stooping to
illegal rushing.
Suspicion lies at the bottom of the whole question of enforce
ment, and until fraternity men throw off their roles of Doubting
Thomases, the rushing situation at Stanford will remain a disgrace
to themselves and the University.
Stanford fraternities are again trying to solve their age-old prob
lem —enforcement of the rushing rules. Moses was in no worse
pickle when the lights went out than are the Creek letter organiza
tions in their present quandary.
This was clearly exemplified at a meeting of the Interfraternity
Council Monday night, which developed into a rip-snorting bull ses
sion on the crudity of the enforcement of rushing rules in past sea
sons. For once in their lives the fraternity men forgot themselves,
discarded their nefarious cloaks of suspicion, and became frank with
one another, admitting that the rules in the past were nothing but
farces.
