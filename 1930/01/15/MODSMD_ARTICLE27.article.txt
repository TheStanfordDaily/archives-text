						LAMBS OF THE FLOCK

Pope Pins* recent encyclical denouncing co-education, sexual
education, pedagogic naturalism, and excessive physical education,
brings to mind papal dccrees devoted in part to the censure of women
who smoke.
Last Sunday morning a well known ()akland minister (Protes
tant) devoted the largest portion of his radio discourse to the per
nicious evils of nicotine when used by the feminine sex. ()akland s
crusader thundered and wept, almost, as lie drew ugly pictures of
what this world is coming to.
The Daji.y does not set itself up as a defender of habitual smok
ing; and much less does this newspaper set itself up as a critic of
the theology of the Pope and his Protestant contemporary.
As moulders and interpreters of morals, both men have a per
fect right to denounce smoking or anything else they consider wrong.
If they failed to do that thing they would be failing to perform a
duty that is theirs.
Granting all those things, it is difficult to see why Pope Pius and
the Oakland preacher should point accusing fingers at women who
smoke, and leave masculine addicts to the weed uncensured. They
infer by the course they have taken that sauce for the gander is ar
senic for the goose. That doesn't make good sense.
After all, it's just that old bugaboo question—shall the standard
be single or ihall it be double? The Catholic and the Protestant in
this case apparently believe in the latter.
Churches nowadays are making a great ado over the necessity of
keeping the young people within the flock. I o interest the young, the
churches must think young. And the single standard is one of the
first precepts of youth.
