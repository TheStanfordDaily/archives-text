BAMBINA, at the Curran Theatre.
"Bambina" Monday night held
and thrilled a fastidious first-night
1 audience. More than usual depend
ed on the reception given this per
formance, for it represented the
j first world premiere presentation
J of an operetta ever staged in San
| Francisco, and its success was only
a gamble. Unsophisticated and
sweet, "Bamhina" leaves a recollec
i tiori of harmonic loveliness and
1 very solid charm.
The salient puint of "Bambina" is
I iis exceptional vocal work. The lilt
j and swing of the song for which
; the play was named will establish
jit as the favorite of the show, al
! though the haunting beauty of the
> "Inspiration Waltz" as sung and
i danced by Laurel Nemeth ami Wil
' bur Evans made this brief appear
j ance the most appealing spot of
! the whole play.
On a slender but sweet and pl
; quant story, an exquisite fabric of
I song and dance ensembles was
; built, in which costumes of satin
I and spangles soi'tly blended, and
handsome broadcloth were worn by
graceful, golden-voiced ladies, and
■ consumate lovers who glided on
j and off the ever-changing stage in.

enchanting harmony.
Although this delicate, dreamlike
quality of the play wuh its most
notable charm, Marie Wells, with
her vibrance and glorious bur
lesque, and that genius of comedy,
Al St. John, imparted a liveliness
of spirit that was priceless. Also,
it was almost a toss-up between
Nancy Welford and Dorothy Dix
far us beauty, personality, and
talent were concerned. Both were
adorable; the audience completely
tell in love with them. However,
Marie Wells us the slightly tipsy
tut captivating Madame Pompa
dour scored the triumph of the eve
ning—and deservedly so. Her act
ing and singing was superb.
In its essence the play Is not
sophisticated. The quaint and sim
ple elegance of the dialogue and
the demurely picturesque costumes
gives "Bambina" an Intangible,
"long ago and far away" charm.
But a very deep sophistication
nevertheless lay in the smoothness
of performance. Carnival scenes so
easily arg loose and conglomerate.
I "Bambina" the careless

at. the same time gives a beauti-
I fullv unified, finished effect.
