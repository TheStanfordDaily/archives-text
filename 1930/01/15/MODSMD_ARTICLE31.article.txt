## SHALL WE HOUSE STUDENTS OR CARS? 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
1 am moved by the plight of the
unfortunate Chrysler roadster own
' (rs who, it seems, each year suffer
hundreds and hundreds of dollars
in depreciation due to the lack of
| garages. I can feel, even for the
• proprietor of a new Ford. What,
1 however, of the graduate women,
the men, graduate and undergradu
! ate, who, housed in hovels, are
forced to commute from the fartli
j eft confines of Palo Alto? What of
I the depreciation of their university
I careers, academic and otherwise?
| My crusading spirit in this cause
had been effectively broken by the
often-stressed, extreme impecuni
l osity of Stanford University, which,

i it now appears, is q hoax and i
myth. The capital for the construe
tion of 20 garages must be rathei
a tidy sum, which could be as eas
iiy applied to students as aut(
housing. If the administration con
tinues in this garage program, wlia
must the candid commentator con
elude, but that on this campus (as
elsewhere), plutocratic influence:
dominate?
And in conclusion, 1 wisli to in
ject this grim spectre: the possi
liility of commuting students, thei:
pride broken by quarters and quar
ters of miserable arrangements
taking up a bare, but, handy, exist
! ence in the new edifices. Wha
wculd tlie roadsters do then, poo:
i things? —R. Turner.
