# CONTINUED SUCCESS OF "BAMBINA" MAY LEAD TO PERMANENT COMPANY-ROYCE
## 
### W. H. G 
"If 'Bambina' continues as sue-|
cessfully with San Francisco audi-!
ences as tonight's reception indi
cates, this cast will form a perma- !
nent company to pin v good musical
shows for the coast, circuit. The j
New York talent is shot, aud for •
too long have you been tantalized i
out here with inferior productions
thrown together in a couple of j
weeks' time with an eye for box
office receipts."
Edward (I. Royce, veteran direc- j
toi of "Merry" Widow," "ftio Hita," j
"Sally"-he crouched in tired hap
piness receiving compliments back
stage Monday night after the last ;
curtain rang down on bis well-di
rected world premier of the oper- !
elta "Bambina."
San Francisco Talent
First night, with its telegrams,
fl< wers, top hats, and turmoil, |
meant rest, for the first time in ,
five solid weeks for Royce. "Four- j
teen hours a day rehearsal all that j
time," he said. "We turned the
stage into a regular school of i
drama for awhile, tor a well-drilled j
production is what. San Francisco i
deserved for a long time. We chose ;
nearly the whole cast from local i
talent." The director is a small, !
cjuiet man, and the husk in his
voice was easy proof of the "four
teen hours per diem" schedule, lb 1
wears glasses, and his very charm
ing wife is at his side to remind
him of telegrams and other forget
table details.
" 'Bambina' is a lacy operetta, i
and I hope audiences will like the
music as well as I did. My 'Kid
Boots' was more comedy, and
'Sally' lacked the music and chor-j
uses that the 'Bambina' Venetian
carnival scenes offer. It is a pretty j
thing. No, I haven't seen the talkie j
'Sally' yet, but the most effective ;
place for sound films is in news
reels. L like them. But the novelty j
of talkies has worn off; they will j
never replace the light, opera, bo-j
cause how can film stars hear ap- 1
plause?"

Royce was nearly crushed among
(lie excited chorines —who are just
as pretty up close, by the way—
when tliH enchanting Marie Wells
pullet] him out of reverie to intro
duce pa, ma, and little brother Wil
lie to "Mr. Royce, who is SO. won
derful to work under." She ought
to know.
Dorothy Dix Is "Find"
"Marie Wells and Nancy Wel
ford are old troupers. They know
how to play to a finesse." Royce
could barely whisper by I his time,
hut was still game. "Dorothy Dix is
a girl wlio deserves a hand. She
had never danced before this pro
duction, and had had very lit He
acting experience." It may be be
ginner's luck, then, because Dor
othy does some nice little dances,
and simply runs away with the
feminine comedy. The director is
training her from Monday night
on, as Nancy Welford's understudy.
The stage was nearly uncluttered
and empty when Mr. Royce started
to fell us about the chorus girls,
but "Edgar," said the Mrs., "how
many times have I told you that
you must get sleep."
"Oh, yes," he said, and the "first
night" was over.
