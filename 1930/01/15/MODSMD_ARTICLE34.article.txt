## 
### 
While Congress is scrapping
r.var the tariff problem, Uncle Sam
is doing things to help lighten tin*
load on the farmer. Fertilizer lias
long played an important part in
making lands more productive, it
is in this line that great strides are
being made by the government to
raise the farming population from
the status of the "land poor."
Yesterday, Dr. Fred (i. Cottrell,
of the Fixed Nitrogen Research
Laboratory of Washington, D.C.,
visited the Carnegie Laboratory,
which is under the Department of
Agriculture. Dr. cottrell is 011 his
way home from the World Kngi
neering Congress which' has just
been held in Tokio. He has heÂ» n
away from Washington for nix
months.
Swords to Plowshares
Dr. Cottrell, also connected with
the Bureau of Chemistry, Soil, and
Fertilizer Division, which was or
ganization during the war in con
nection with the/Muscle Shoals
project, said that the problems be
ing considered at present are grow
ing away from those of a military
nature into a study of agricultural
problems.
"In the field of fertilizer produc
tion, the problem has shifted from
nitrogen technique to that of phos
phate. Nitrogen >s being adequate
ly and economically produced by
private industrial concerns. The
research work conducted under the
government is aimed at finding an
economical, and at the same time,
profitable method of producing am
monium phosphate instead of am
monium sulphate in commercial
quantities," Dr. Cottrell said.
