## EARLING QUINTET EFEATSSTOCKTON WITH FAST FINISH lancock Stars For Home Team; Stevens Leads For Losers 
### 
After getting tiff to a fast lead by
nI:iii)' two field goals early in the
i t quarter, St«><• kt»>ll High School's
r.l-.i tball team weakened before the
iiv<- of the Stanford freshmen and
t re defeated by a score of 2<S to 13
t the Pavilion last night. The Card
arlings were just a little too fast
>r tlie Tarzans, who were weakened
i the last half by the loss of two
Millars on personal fouls.
John Hancock, Stanford running
uard, was the high point man of the
veiling with 8 points, the majority
i which were made on free throws,
ail Stevens, rangy Tarzan center,
as well in the lead for high point
iting until lie was put out of the
anie for too many fouls.
At the start of the contest it looked
ke a sure victory for the Stockton
uintet. The Tarzan man-for-inan
efense was plainly a puzzle for the
ards, who have played against a
raight five-man defense all se?,on.
lowever, by the end of the iirst quur
uaitci tlie baby seemed to
ave solved the diA'.culty and at half
me the-; were leading by 14 to 10.
Card Defense Good
defensively, the Cards did fairly
.<ll in the lirst period and very well
i the second, holding the Tarzans to
single field g«al in the latter. I lan
ock again stood out as a tower of
trength on the defense, playing a
ood game under the basket. Tway
lso did some tine work at guarding,
Meade, Palmer, lulelen, and Cord
v, playing at the forward positions,
pened up with a nice passing attack
i the second half after discarding a
rihhling procedure which nearly
pelled ruin in the lirst period. Hdc
ii was put out of the game on fouls
nthe third quarter, and Tway, tak
ng his place at center, most of the
ime.
Stevens and Miloslivich stood out
or the losers, tlie former doing some
ice shooting while Miloslavich was
lie main cog in the Tarzan floor at
