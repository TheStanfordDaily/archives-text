###

the fourth quarter, El Toro over
whelmed Delta Kappa Epsilon 30-S
in an intramural basketball game
played in Encina gymnasium last
night. Fisher, liinky club center,
1( d high point honors with eleven
counts, and was ably seconded by
Loomis and Craiulall at the forward
berths. Butts, demonstrating some
expert fioorwork, proved the chief
scoring threat of the fraternity
quintet, looping in two long shots
to provide half of his team's points.
Expert guarding by the Toro five
forced the Dekes to resort largely
to difficult shots.
El Toro used a fairly large num
ber of men during the contest, but
the most effectual combination
proved to be Fisher at center,
Loomis and Crandall, forwards, and
Brown and Hubbard, guards. Phil
Neill, of football fame, put up :i
good game at guard for Delta
Kappa Epsilon, bat was unable to

club quintet,
A.T.O. Loses To Encina

defeated Alpha Tan Omega 13-10.
Individual honors were divided be
tween Tnrr of the Encina five and

ing three field goals. Play was fast

fraternity men missed a greater
number of potential scoring shots
during the contest, the Encina
team made up for this by proving
unable to sink free throws.
Neither team replaced a man
during the entire fame. Fioorwork
by both teams was much better
than usually appears in intramural
basketball. Smith of Encina 4E. and
