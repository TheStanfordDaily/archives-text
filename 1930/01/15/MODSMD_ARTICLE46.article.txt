# WESTERN SON RISES....
## Johnny Doeg's 1929 Ranking Will Be Third, Thinks "Feg"; Tilden and Hunter Alone Are Better 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Where Will Johnny Doeg rank
as far as 1929 tennis is concerned?
The t.owheaded southpaw from
California who is a nephew of May
Sutton Dundy ranked eighth in
102S, just below Fritz Mercur, who,
in turn, was one place lower than
John Van Ryn. That he will pass
both uf these lads is rather certain,
although Van Ryn's being a mem
ber of tjie Davis Cup team will add
a lot of weight in his favor.
But let's go at it from the other
end. That Dill Tilden will be No. 1
tor the tenth year in succession is
certain. That Frank Hunter will
be No. 2 is almost as much of a
cinch, for Hunter was a singles
i player on the 1929 Davis Cup team
in the Inter-Zone finals, and a final
ist in the U.S. men's singles cham
pionship, defeating such players as
Fritz Mercur, Dick Williams, and
Junior Coen. George Lott, third
ranking player in 1928, also was a
Davis Cup singles man, but he
failed to do well in the National
Singles, losing to Wilmer Allison
in the fourth round. Allison was
, ranked fifth in the last national
ranking, and, with Van Ryn, was a
number of the U.S. Davis Cup dou
bles team which did so well abroad.
: Johnny Hennessey, fourth in the
, I!'2S ranking, slipped badly this

last season.
Johnny Doeg, the Stanford south-!
paw, whose fierce service reminds i
many of that of Robert Lindley
Murray, another Stanford left
hander who was U.S. champion in
1917 and '18, defeated among others
in 1929, Van Rvn (at least twice),
Mercur, Mangin, Arnold Jones, j
Dick Williams, Bunny Austin, and j
Stligson. He won, besides, the j
men's doubles championship, the|
Lcngwood Bowl and Seabright
singles, the Rhode Island State
singles title, Pacific Southwest sin
gles championship, and Nassau
Country Club Invitation singles. (
He lost to Mercur in the finals of
the Southampton invitation singles,
to de Ricou at Newport, and to
Tilden in live sets in the national
singles semi-finals.
1 think he'll rank third for 1929.
What do you think?
