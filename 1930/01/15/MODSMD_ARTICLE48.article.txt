# NEW COMBINATIONS PLANNED FOR CAGE FRACAS WITH U.S.C.
## Husky Hunt Plans Change Of Line-up Against Tall Trojans 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Snapping out of it for the first tunc
since they landed in the Conference
cellar last Saturday, the Cardinal var
sity cagers went through a still thirty
minute scrimmage yesterday after
noon in preparation for their second
southerti invasion over the coming
week-end.
Coach Musky I Tun} tried out sev
eral combinations before the workout
was over in an effort to find the right
five with which to "come back"
against the Trojan quintet. This is
no easy task for the Card mentor, as
U.S.C. is reputed to have the tallest
team in Coast college circles.
When Height Counts
. It was a big edge in height that
largely led to Stanford's Crushing set
hack in the Conference opener at
Westwood, according to I hint s cal
culators. None ot the Bruins could
be classed as midgeffi, while Lubin,
lanky center, towered over the tallest
Redshirt by a good four inches, t on
sequently the Farm players were itot
only handicapped at the tip-off, but
failed to cover up the long shots with
any degree of success.
And since the Trojans overshadow
the Bruins, I lunt has about decided to
sacrifice speed for taller timber him
self. His first move along this line
has been the injection of Don Tyler
at Berg's forward berth during the
last couple of nights' practice ses
sions. For although he is the best
long shot artist on the team and ihc
fastest on the floor, the flashy red
head is also the smallest player on
the squad.
Reynolds Over Rowley
Another possible change in the
regular lineup is ihc starting of Mike
Reynolds at guard instead of Milt
Rowley. Reynolds has been going
great guns in practice for the past
two weeks and showed to -good ad
vantage in the U.C.L.A. tilt, while the
Ohio transfer is still bothered by a
! bruised finger. Paired with Captain
Rothertj Reynolds is likely to make it
plenty tough for the 1 rojan giants
to crash through for sucker shots, as
the combination worked to perfection
last winter.
The U.S.C. attack is composed of
a weaving, short passing system.
