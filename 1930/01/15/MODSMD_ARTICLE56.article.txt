# SHIP FREED FROM ICE-LOCKED DRYDOCK BY CHEMICAL SPRAY
## 
### 
QI'EBEC, Jan. 14. -Science
was credited with another victory
over nature today after a chemical
compound had liberated a steam
ship from an ice-locked drydock in
three minutes.
Dr. Howard T. Barnes of McGilL
University, using a high-pressure
pump and a hose, sprayed the thick
ice about the Chqmplain Dry Dock
at Lauzon, where the Italian
freighter Concordia was frozen in
and faced the prospect of being
held prisoner until the spring
breakup.
Under the action of ihe chemical
the ice splintered with a thunder
ous noise and the ship floated free.
The ice was broken into such small
particles that even small boats
j could be navigated about the dock
i and its approaches.
Experiments have been made
: with the compound to break up
! river ice and to remove snow from
j stieets. This is the first time it lias
j been used to shatter harbor ice.
