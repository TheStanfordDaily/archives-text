# MEN'S COUNCIL AGAIN
## 
### 
Twelve more imprudent parkers
i received one dollar fines at the
j regular weekly meeting of the
j Men's Council yesterday afternoon.
Light fines were also imposed on
| four campus speed law violators
!\\ho appeared. The small number
; of parking cases is due to the fact
I that Officer John Olsen was off
j duty two days last week.
