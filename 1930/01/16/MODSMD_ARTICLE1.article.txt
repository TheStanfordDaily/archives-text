Swollen streams crashed nut of their .
hanks to maroon families and lay
waste fertile soil.
At Ottovva, Ohio, 300 families were |
marooned by the raging waters of the j
Blanchard River, which rose to forty j
feet, higher hy twenty-eight feet than !
its usual level. The families were said

Homes Flooded
A dozen or more families were i
kept in their homes by flood waters
of the Sandusky River at Mechanics- |
burg, Ohio, and in some sections of j
the state the floods were held to be
the worst since 1913.
Southern Illinois streams raged tin- j
controlled, and augmented the havoc !
wrought by recent rains, sleet, and j
snow. More than 00,001) acres were j
inundated in the Kaskaskia River j
bottoms, among which was several j
thousand acres of corn and wheat.
