# Physicist Ends Parking Trouble Without Fines
## 
### 
Though scientists are powerless
j to inflict fines, they have discov-
I eied h very effective method of
i bringing ;i "no parking" rule to
I the attention of students. Many
motorists were in the habit of
; parking along the side of the
I physics building, where their cars
chut out the light from the X-ray
I laboratory in the basement.
Ordinary "no parking" signs
i were useless, and, at last, some
i genius made use of his scientific
I mind and inaugurated the custom
of firmly pasting stickers upon the
left side of the windshields of cars
violating the rule. Poetic justice
results when students find their
vision obscured by a "no parking"
label until the clinging sticker can
be scraped off.
