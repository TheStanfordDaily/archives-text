# CAMPUS PHYSICIST STUDYING METEOR CRATER IN ARIZONA
## 
### Ruth Ross 
Hurtling out of the ether at ter-
I rific speed, enveloped in blinding
j flames, a small comet is thought lo
! have struck the surface of the earth
|in Arizona between one and three
I thousand years ago.
The resulting Meteor ('rater of
j Arizona is attracting the attention of
'geologists and astronomers. Dr. 1).
I L. Webster, of the Stanford physics
i department, is now engaged in study
j ing physical aspects of the problem of
excavating and removing deposits of
j nickel and platinum which would be
: left by such a comet.

In describing the Arizona crater,
j Dr. Webster said : "The crater is cir
cular, with a rim 150 feet above the
J plain, and a flat bottom 4(10 feet be
llow the plain. It looks like the Sta
i dium, but has an area 100 times as
great. The crater, which resembles
those on the moon, is obviously not
volcanic.
"The mystery of its origin was
solved by the late I). M. Barringer, a
' mining engineer of Philadelphia.
| There are more meteors on the
j ground within five miles of the crater
i than on all the rest of the earth. This
| suggested to Barringer that the cra
ter might be formed by the impact of
; an enormous meteor or swarm of me
! teors forming the head of a small
| cornet. Further evidence is furnished
i by the old Indian legend that years
| ago the sky caught fire, fell down,
j and everyone within 70 miles was
j killed.

"The problem now is to tinr 1 out
; whether the total mass of the comet
I is big enough to finance the excava-
I tion by the sale of nickel and plati
i num obtained from it. I bis presents
| problems in physics as well as in as
| tronomy and geology, and is cngag
i ing the attention of investigators in
j different parts of the country."
Dr. Webster explained that he has
j been working on the calculations of
j the resistance offered to such a com
|et, which evidently weighed between
| 3 and .?() million tons, by the atnios
| pile re and by the earth's surface, lie
i said that the hardness of the rock
| surface is probably an unimportant
j factor, compared with (lie inertia ii
i displays when it has to gel out of the.
I way of a comet striking at 10 to 20
| miles per second.

In describing the Arizona crater,
j Dr. Webster said : "The crater is cir
cular, with a rim 150 feet above the
J plain, and a flat bottom 4(10 feet be
llow the plain. It looks like the Sta
i dium, but has an area 100 times as
great. The crater, which resembles
those on the moon, is obviously not
volcanic.

' mining engineer of Philadelphia.
| There are more meteors on the
j ground within five miles of the crater
i than on all the rest of the earth. This

ter might be formed by the impact of
; an enormous meteor or swarm of me
! teors forming the head of a small
| cornet. Further evidence is furnished
i by the old Indian legend that years

j and everyone within 70 miles was
