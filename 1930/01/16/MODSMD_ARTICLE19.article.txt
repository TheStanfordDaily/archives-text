# ZIMBALIST ACCLAIMED BY CAMPUS
## Violinist Proves Himself Master of Technique In Recital 
### Jean Rosenberg 
Efrem Zfmbalist, violinist, was:
received with great appreciation
by a rather small audience in the i
Stanford Pavilion last night. His |
| program started with a display of ]
I technique in the Pugnani-Kreisler !
: Praeludium and Allegro. Zimbalist's
j brilliant technique is his outstand
| ing feature.
I The Praeludium was followed by i
j Mendelssohn's Concerto in E Minor, j
j by way of contrast. The Russian j
j artist showed more feeling than be
j is usually credited with in the j
Mendelssohn, and gave it a lovely j
rendition.
The second group, consisting of
Achron's Suite Bizarret, was rather !
tiresome. The eight parts of this i
Lsuite are clever and varied, but '
j too long. Cleverness, even when j
j well done, becomes dull.
j The third group of the concert ;
j contained four popular arrange-J
j mcnts of light selections. The Schu-!
! hurt Ave Maria was beautiful and '
sweet. The Chopin Valse was per
! haps the best and most popular I
j number of the evening; and both j
| Glinka's Persian Song and Sara-j
| sale's Fantasy on themes from
j Carmen were greeted with ap- j
: plause.
The second of the l'J29-30 !
i A.S.S.U. Concerts was, proliably j
| due to a better and more balanced
| pjogram, an even greater success I
j than the first.
