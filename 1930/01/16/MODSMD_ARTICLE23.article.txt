## Japanese, Latin Nations Irritated at Close Co-operation Between England, United States; Stimson Is Silent as Ship Nears Plymouth

S.S. GEORGE WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (/P). —Jt seems certain that
the Anglo-American leatnre of the forthcoming Koiklou naval conference
negotiations will have a prominent place in discussions beginning with the
arrival of the American delegation in England Friday.
Although Colonel Henry L. Stimson, American Secretarv of State and
head of the delegation, is not disclosing his plans, it is not improbable
that he and hamsay Macl)onald, British premier, will discuss in advance
of the conference recent indications of irritation among the other powers at

' the dose co-operation of the British
and American governments in the in
ception of tile forthcoming negotia
tions.
Irritation Not Justified
I lie American delegation feels
strongly that such irritation is not
justified and that Colonel Stimson
may take the first opportunity to re
assure others that the two nations en
ter the conference unbound by any
agreement except to work toward the
common end of naval limitation.
After Premier Mac Donald's visit
to President Hoover, Colonel Stini
i son publicly denied suggestions abroad
that an effort would be made to bring
the conference under Anglo-Ameri
can domination. A misunderstanding
seems to have arisen in some quarters
also regarding the status of the parity

Secretary Stimson feels it would
be most unfortunate if anyone en
