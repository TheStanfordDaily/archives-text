; THE HAGUE, Jan. 15 (/P). â€”The
I Germans and the creditor powers to
j day finally settled the difficult ques-
I tion of sanctions, which has been one
I of the chief stumbling blocks in the
I way of adoption of the Young plan

cover liberty of action against Ger
many whenever the Court of Inter
national Justice, on complaint of the
'creditors, may find the German gov
ernment has committed an act tending
ito destroy the Young plan.

Premier Andre Tardieu of France
explained that there would be, of

Ito themselves to anticipate any pos
j sible repudiation by Germany of bet
i financial obligations and have it un
derstood clearly that in such case the>
(would have the right to take action
j Karl J. YVirth, minister of occupier
areas, and Dr. Hjalmar Schacht, heat
! of the Keichsbank, confirmed the Get'
I f
j man governments acceptance of tin
declaration, although they considerer
! the contingency provided for was ai
impossible one and regretted that th<
question has been raised.
