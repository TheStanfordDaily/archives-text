Last night Hamlin (iarland. noted writer and charming speaker,
completely won over a large audience by his intimate discourse on
Lngland s great authors, (iarland was given a record-breaking
round of applause by that traditional blase group which attends
Tuesday evening lectures.
Hut it will be surprising if the man can again be induced to at

Assembly Hall are in themselves discouragement enough to deter
the average speaker; but with the noises made by that group of
people who Hock down the aisle like a herd of horses, the din becomes
unbearable.
Last night one couple, a man and a woman, old enough to know

but marched out only after they had made it literally impossible for
those sitting along the aisle to hear or see.
Inasmuch as fire regulations make it illegal trt lock the doors t<>

lately in the employ of the Hoard of .Athletic Control for policing
