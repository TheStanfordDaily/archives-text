# PASSING OF COLLEGIATE HYPOCRISY
## 
### 
< )ne more aspect of collegiate hypocrisy lias passed with the rec
ommendation of the Executive Committee at its meeting Tuesday
night that further Cood Will assemblies be forever abolished from
this campus. With the Ex Committee on record as against these
farcical attempts to allow over-ambiliotis student body leaders to
preen themselves on fantastic bombast, Stanford once more demon
strates its ability to renounce foolish and empty idealism.
Sentiment to cancel all arrangements with other Pacific Coast
universities that called for < iood Will assemblies was crystallized
last quarter by the Daily when it suggested that the California
meeting be abandoned because of lack of purpose in holding such a
gathering.
Originally designed to act as a safety valve to control student
enthusiasm before athletic contests and thus prevent property-dam
aging invasions of other campuses, the migrations of student leaders
soon proved that no real value was accruing to any institution and
that these assemblies lowered themselves to tiresome meetings where
moth eaten and sometimes questionable humor was exchanged be
tween representatives.
1 lie Stanford student committee is to be commended for its ac
tion and it is to be hoped that I'resident Stanford Steinbeck's pro
posed plan to send representatives to Award Assemblies, where re
cipients of letters and medals might be congratulated by an opponent
in the field of intercollegiate endeavor, will be favorably acted upon.
