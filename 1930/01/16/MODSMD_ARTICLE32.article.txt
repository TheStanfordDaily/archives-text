I'an-Hellenic, director of Stanford's I'uncli and Judy show, in
working toward the simplification of the puppet performance, has
departed from custom this season and announced the exact time that
the final scene, sorority bidding, will take place.
Heretofore men, sororities, and authorities in charge of bidding
have plaved a game of hide and seek. The men and the sororities
have used their wits and detective ability to find out what time bid
ding was to begin, and the authorities have attempted to conceal the
fact. This year the directors have made a wise decision ; they have
eliminated the mysterious element by announcing, far in advance,
the time of bidding. This is a convenience for the sororities and the
rushees for they can make definite plans, which they have not been
able to do before.
The disorder usually aroused by cars rushing up and down the
Row following the pledge-fillet! automobiles should be lessened, is
the belief of Pan-! lellenic council. To do away with this, the mys
terious element has been eliminated by announcing the time of bid
fling as 6:30 o'clock at night.
I»v that time, the sorority governors reason, the darkness will
prevent onlookers from being able to discern which pledge is their
favorite. And tlie sororities, according to custom, will have open
house following bidding to allow campus sportsmen who have been
betting on certain puppets and certain houses the chance to find out
the results of their bets.
