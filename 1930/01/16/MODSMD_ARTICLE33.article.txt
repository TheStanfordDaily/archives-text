"THE TRACIC ERA." By Claude
G. Bowers. New York: Huityli
tori Mifflin Company, 1929.
Poor old misunderstood and
much vituperated Andrew Johnson
and the years of corruption that
marked his term as President of
the United States provide the
subject matter for this historical
work of Mr. Bowers, which he has
I aptly called the revolution after
Lincoln.
j The more we read the book the
i more ii neems that as far us any
personal glory and fame in the
future went, it was just as well
i that Abraham Lincoln died when
he did. According to this author,
i Lincoln aL the time of his death
! v/as a more lonely figure, with the
| country less' under his control,
! than any president before or since.
It was at this point that fate made
! Andrew Johnson the goat for all
I those years ofshame that followed
I the Civil War. The events, of those
bloody and dramatic years after
the war are exerting an influence
| on this country even to this day.
A country was lighting for its na
| tionalism and whether the methods
used in the various life struggles
for existence were right, only time
1 will tell.
When Bowers paints the word
portraits of Johnson, Thaddeus
Stevens, Sumner, and others who
figured in the melodrama of thost*
years, one begins to think that
after all history w;is not the dismal
thing that numerous high school
' teachers manage to make out of it.
All in all this work of Mr.
Bowers is well worth reading if
. only for a new picture, and certain
ly a more just one, of the only
President of the United States ever
to be impeached. —A. M.
THE THIRTEENTH CHAIR—At
the Varsity Theatre.
Hollywood has done the most it
possibly could for Bayard Veiller's
excellent mystery play. It hasn't
spoiled it by over-manipulation of
the original story. The play does
i not require strong acting and with
the exception of Margaret Wycher
ley's excellent performance it does
n't get it. The other characters,
among whom are Conrad Nagel and
Leila Hyamis, contribute all that is
required of them, which isn't much.
The Thirteenth Chair has all (lie
old hokum served up in a- new dish.
Clever detectives; turbaned hin
tius, ghost voices, rather stupid
English gentlemen and their beau
tiful wives and sweethearts com-,
bine again to solve* a strange mur
der.
A hypercritical observer might

■ 1 1
justly remark that the solution of
the murder depends upon Informa
tion withheld l'rom the audience
, until the bitter end. Theoretically,
! the best mystery story comes
through various interpretations ol
the same perplexing clews which
: when finally put properly together
! solve the situation.
Complete neglect of the guilty
i party as he or she concerns the !
j crime is apt to weaken the plot,
i Vciller is only able to solve the !
■ first murder through the execution
! ot a second under conditions more
| lavorable to detection. The key
j clue is a psychological one and
j masterly deceptive.. It consists of
I the flippant self-assurance of the
j murderer to escape discovery.
I The picture provides an exoel-
I lent evening's entertainment and
j i-? full of guaranteed thrills. II is
' convincingly acted and- with the
! exception of a too frequent chang
j in;.; of scenes, which mars the con
j tinuhy, is well staged. —B. i J .

Theatre.
j "It's the Age of Unrequited Ado

"Bad Babies" shows high school

[of themselves frying to find thrills. |
j This theme has been used hel'ore,!
I but the play puts a uniquely effec- i
| five interpretation of the situation.
1 It is not sophisticated, a fact which
j may prove a disappointment, for
i sophistication is inevitably de
manded from a play of a so-called
I daring type.'"Bad Babies" is differ

j from this it derives a realism that
i-; very striking. The characters are
; convincing because they are only
i sick'enly foolish, frightened, blus

aptly named. The eight figures are

G. Bowers. New York: Huityli
tori Mifflin Company, 1929.
Poor old misunderstood and
much vituperated Andrew Johnson
and the years of corruption that
marked his term as President of
the United States provide the
subject matter for this historical
work of Mr. Bowers, which he has
I aptly called the revolution after
Lincoln.
j The more we read the book the
i more ii neems that as far us any
personal glory and fame in the
future went, it was just as well
i that Abraham Lincoln died when
he did. According to this author,
i Lincoln aL the time of his death
! v/as a more lonely figure, with the
| country less' under his control,
! than any president before or since.
It was at this point that fate made
! Andrew Johnson the goat for all
I those years ofshame that followed
I the Civil War. The events, of those
bloody and dramatic years after
the war are exerting an influence
| on this country even to this day.
A country was lighting for its na
| tionalism and whether the methods
used in the various life struggles
for existence were right, only time
1 will tell.
When Bowers paints the word
portraits of Johnson, Thaddeus
Stevens, Sumner, and others who
figured in the melodrama of thost*
years, one begins to think that
after all history w;is not the dismal
thing that numerous high school
' teachers manage to make out of it.
All in all this work of Mr.
Bowers is well worth reading if
. only for a new picture, and certain
ly a more just one, of the only
President of the United States ever
to be impeached. —A. M.
THE THIRTEENTH CHAIR—At
the Varsity Theatre.
Hollywood has done the most it
possibly could for Bayard Veiller's
excellent mystery play. It hasn't
spoiled it by over-manipulation of
the original story. The play does
i not require strong acting and with
the exception of Margaret Wycher
ley's excellent performance it does
n't get it. The other characters,
among whom are Conrad Nagel and
Leila Hyamis, contribute all that is
required of them, which isn't much.
The Thirteenth Chair has all (lie
old hokum served up in a- new dish.
Clever detectives; turbaned hin
tius, ghost voices, rather stupid
English gentlemen and their beau
tiful wives and sweethearts com-,
bine again to solve* a strange mur
der.
A hypercritical observer might

■ 1 1
justly remark that the solution of
the murder depends upon Informa
tion withheld l'rom the audience
, until the bitter end. Theoretically,

through various interpretations ol

and the years of corruption that
marked his term as President of
the United States provide the
subject matter for this historical
work of Mr. Bowers, which he has
I aptly called the revolution after
Lincoln.
j The more we read the book the
i more ii neems that as far us any
personal glory and fame in the
future went, it was just as well
i that Abraham Lincoln died when
he did. According to this author,
i Lincoln aL the time of his death
! v/as a more lonely figure, with the
| country less' under his control,
! than any president before or since.
It was at this point that fate made
! Andrew Johnson the goat for all
I those years ofshame that followed
I the Civil War. The events, of those
bloody and dramatic years after
the war are exerting an influence
| on this country even to this day.
A country was lighting for its na
| tionalism and whether the methods
used in the various life struggles
for existence were right, only time
1 will tell.
When Bowers paints the word
portraits of Johnson, Thaddeus
Stevens, Sumner, and others who
figured in the melodrama of thost*
years, one begins to think that
after all history w;is not the dismal
thing that numerous high school
' teachers manage to make out of it.
All in all this work of Mr.
Bowers is well worth reading if
. only for a new picture, and certain
ly a more just one, of the only
President of the United States ever
to be impeached. —A. M.
THE THIRTEENTH CHAIR—At
the Varsity Theatre.
Hollywood has done the most it
possibly could for Bayard Veiller's
excellent mystery play. It hasn't
spoiled it by over-manipulation of
the original story. The play does
i not require strong acting and with
the exception of Margaret Wycher
ley's excellent performance it does
n't get it. The other characters,
among whom are Conrad Nagel and
Leila Hyamis, contribute all that is
required of them, which isn't much.
The Thirteenth Chair has all (lie
old hokum served up in a- new dish.
Clever detectives; turbaned hin
tius, ghost voices, rather stupid
English gentlemen and their beau
tiful wives and sweethearts com-,
bine again to solve* a strange mur
der.
A hypercritical observer might

■ 1 1
justly remark that the solution of
the murder depends upon Informa
tion withheld l'rom the audience
, until the bitter end. Theoretically,

through various interpretations ol
the same perplexing clews which

Complete neglect of the guilty
