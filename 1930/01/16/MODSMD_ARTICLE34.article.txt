FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF JANUARY 16, 1905

An editorial reminded certain
residents of the University com
munity that galloping horses over
| the soft baseball field did not im
prove the ground. After a long
'fight, those interested in the for
| tunes of the baseball teams had
succeeded in closing the field to
carriage traffic and were then
â–  somewhat disgusted to find it torn
up by horses' hoofs.
The unveiling of the Rogers
monument at Olymuia, Washington,
aroused much interest on the cam
pus. Governor Rogers was the
j father of Professor P. J. Rogers
of the Physics department.
Work on the new gymnasium
1 building was progressing satisfac
torily. The roof, with the exception
i of the central portion of the dome,
had been completed. Active work
I had begun on the central portion

I and the lintel stones were being
placed.
The large new building adjoining
the Students' Guild Hospital in
Palo Alto, which was in construe- 1
I tion during the preceding diphthe
ria epidemic, was finally completed.
It was constructed in four sections
so that, each one might be com
pletely shut off from the other.
