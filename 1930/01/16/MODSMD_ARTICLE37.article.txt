# "SEEING STANFORD FIRST" CONTINUES WITH SNOW TRIP
## Rain Thaws Snowfall On Skyline; Mt. Hamilton Furnishes Crop 
### 
Disappointed because Ibis last
rain has washed all of the snow
away from the Skyline Boulevard
and tin l hills in back of the cant
pus, today's trip to the snow will
take all eager travelers to Mt.
Hamilton. This is one journey
, where the auto will be used to
transport the Stanford student, it
i Ivj or she is interested in snow.
Ordinarily, a trip to see the snow
at Mt. Hamilton would not be fit
ted in with a series of articles con
cerned with seeing Stanford, but
right now that subject holds the
attention of every red blooded man,
woman, or child on the campus.
Last week one could gather a good
< rep of the solidified rain by auto
ing up to the hills and filling the
rear seat full of snow.
Snow Fight Ensues
At least, one of the houses on
the How went far enough back to
ward high school hero days to haul
a load down to their front yard
and there indulge in the childish
amusement of pelting passing peo
ple with snowballs.
While the snow was on the foot
hills, Stanford students had a good
1 chance to take a ride, see the beau
• ties of the white-carpeted forests
' and pastures, look down on our
campus from afar, and take a trip
to the snow at the same time. But
it. can't be done now.
Mt. Hamilton Trip
The next best place to go for
snow is Mt. Hamilton. This makes
an easy and educational trip con
suming about ninety minutes of
■ your time going and the same re
turning. Your length of stay will
bo determined by the speed with
which your feet get cold.
Drive down Highway 101 —the
one right in front of the campus —
through Santa Clara and on to
San Jose. The highway continues
itself as Santa Clara Avenue in San
Jose. Follow that street through
the town. California State Automo
bile signs will lead you on your
way to the mountain, if you can
follow them. The road to Mt. Ham
i ilton is in good shape now, or was
before this last rain. If is crooked,
. so watch the curves.
Short Walk Necessary
i It's about 25 miles from San Jose
I to Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamil
ton. The only drawback to a jour
ney to the observatory is the fact
that at present the road is closed
at Smith's Creek. It is five miles
by road from there on to the sum
mit. The distance walking over the
ridge is shorter. There is plenty of
i snow at Smith Creek.
i Lick Observatory takes its pla.ee
1 among famous observatories, it is
j open to the public every afternoon.
Every Saturday night a lecture is
given which is open to all who de
sire to attend. The operation of
! the different instruments is ex
plained, astrological facts and
theories are expounded and an edu
! eational as well as entertaining
1 evening is afforded to all. Parties
must leave on the return trip by
10::u) p.m.
(Next Monday: The Thomas Wei
ton Stanford Art Gallery.)

Last week one could gather a good
< rep of the solidified rain by auto
ing up to the hills and filling the
rear seat full of snow.
Snow Fight Ensues
At least, one of the houses on
the How went far enough back to
ward high school hero days to haul
a load down to their front yard
and there indulge in the childish
amusement of pelting passing peo
ple with snowballs.
While the snow was on the foot
hills, Stanford students had a good
1 chance to take a ride, see the beau
• ties of the white-carpeted forests
' and pastures, look down on our
campus from afar, and take a trip
to the snow at the same time. But
it. can't be done now.
Mt. Hamilton Trip
The next best place to go for
snow is Mt. Hamilton. This makes
an easy and educational trip con
suming about ninety minutes of
■ your time going and the same re
turning. Your length of stay will
bo determined by the speed with
which your feet get cold.
Drive down Highway 101 —the
one right in front of the campus —
through Santa Clara and on to
San Jose. The highway continues
itself as Santa Clara Avenue in San
Jose. Follow that street through
the town. California State Automo
bile signs will lead you on your
way to the mountain, if you can
follow them. The road to Mt. Ham
i ilton is in good shape now, or was
before this last rain. If is crooked,
. so watch the curves.
Short Walk Necessary
i It's about 25 miles from San Jose
I to Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamil
ton. The only drawback to a jour
ney to the observatory is the fact
that at present the road is closed
at Smith's Creek. It is five miles
by road from there on to the sum
mit. The distance walking over the
ridge is shorter. There is plenty of
i snow at Smith Creek.
i Lick Observatory takes its pla.ee
1 among famous observatories, it is
j open to the public every afternoon.
Every Saturday night a lecture is
given which is open to all who de
sire to attend. The operation of
! the different instruments is ex
plained, astrological facts and
theories are expounded and an edu
! eational as well as entertaining
1 evening is afforded to all. Parties
must leave on the return trip by
10::u) p.m.
(Next Monday: The Thomas Wei
ton Stanford Art Gallery.)
Disappointed because Ibis last
rain has washed all of the snow
away from the Skyline Boulevard
and tin l hills in back of the cant
pus, today's trip to the snow will
take all eager travelers to Mt.
Hamilton. This is one journey
, where the auto will be used to
transport the Stanford student, it
i Ivj or she is interested in snow.
Ordinarily, a trip to see the snow
at Mt. Hamilton would not be fit
ted in with a series of articles con
cerned with seeing Stanford, but
right now that subject holds the
attention of every red blooded man,
woman, or child on the campus.
