REINCARNATION
Now that the Farm lias become
e stamping grounds for national
aderputh titleholders, football
'V(-mh that most brutally mis
ndle players from New Vork out
pure malicious hatred for the
tst, and a basketball live with
liabit of breaking records, both
o and con, the average campus
sident is apt to forget that cer
itl minor sports exist.
In fact, it is an even bet that
twenty-nineteenths of the hon
est tuition payers do not know
that Stanford has a wrestling
team. Not that a majority of
them, including the 500, fail lo
f-nqage in a certain branch of
the grappling game themselves
at times; but that is an entire
ly different and a personal mat
ter. When speaking ot the Card
wrestling team, one refers to
the University equipped and
sanctioned amalgamated ama
teur student mat men.
Of course, there are reasons for
lis lack of knowledge on the part
112 the common tuition payers, "the
lain and quite obvious one being
iat the activity of rolling around
n padded canvas in pugnacious
mbrace is a newly installed sport
a (he Farm.
That is, Stanford now has a
wrestling squad for the first
time in more than five long
years. Grappling, as an author
ized art, died a natural death
in '24, after going through a
couple of lean years as far as
interest was concerned. Thus,
the present generation of
roughs and erudite maids has
not had its just chance of find
ing out what the grappling
game is all about.
But last year the ancient urge
>112 pinning an opponent flat on his
;aek for sheer fun and exercise
jegan to invade the Farm again,
(•'earing an epidemic of jiujitsu
nanias, which might eventually
ead to st tides tossing each other
ibout the Quad, or other forms of
nergetic outbreaks, the high po
tentiates of Redshirt athletics
finally approved of a fully organ
ized and coached grappling varsity.
Working out daily under the
knowing eye of Bob Nicholson,
who used to win a good ma
jority of falls for Stanford him-,
self back in '23 and '24, the
wrestling squad at the present
time is composed of twenty-five
inexperienced mat men, who
are rapidly acquiring the knack
of toe holds, half-nelsons, head
locks, and all the other tactics
of mat belligerency.
Although there is at least one
man for each weight from 125 lbs.
ii p, Coach Nicholson is sadly lack
ing in beefy grapplers, and could
readily use a number of additional
heavyweights. It's a wonder that
some of Pop's gridiron stalwarts
don't sign up for the squad, for
iliey demonstrated great possibili
ties in holding from time to time
last fall, as the record of Card
pi naltics for the season well shows.
Too bad Dynamite Gus Son
nenburg doesn't turn fairy
godfather, as does Gentleman
J. J. Tunney now and then, and
offer gold medals to the Farm
grapplers. Without a doubt, all y
of the excessive mattresses on
the campus would at once be
converted into wrestling mats.
Two years ago the ex-pugilistic
scholar presented glittering
trophies to the all-University
fisticuff champs, between quo
tations of Shakespeare, and is
scheduled to duplicate the kind
act again this winter.
Needless to say, boxing is
now one of the most popular
forms of athletic activity on
the Farm!
But, then, as yet the college
grappling game has not become en
dorsed by philanthropic million
aires, nor has it been carried on
t > such a. scale as to become mixed
up with Carnegie monetary scan
dals. And what is more, the mat
men are not due to receive circle
"S's" this year, for the lord direc
tors of Card athletics have balked
at a meet with California.
Wrestling needs the support
of both the students and the
B.A.C. or it will die out all
over again before the present
year is over, as perhaps the

high sports moguls down in
their fine brick palace so de
sire—as would seem from their
moral and monetary aid to
date. The Daily hopes that the
latter shelve a little of their
conservatism and put Cardinal
wrestling on the map!
