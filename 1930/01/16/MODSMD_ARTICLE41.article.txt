# Cards Head For South Tonight
## IMPRESSIVE TROY FIVE FAVORED TO DEFEAT STANFORD Husky Plans Surprise For Southerners; Thirteen Men Make Trip 
### Stephen Dietrich 
With thirteen players scheduled
to board the Southbound Limited
tonight, Coach Husky limit will
lead his Cardinal cage squad down
to the land of Troy this week-end
in an attempt to redeem the recent
rout at the hands of the U.C.L.A.
Bruin by upsetting the highly
touted Trojan five in a Conference
double-header.
Playing more or less "in and
out" ball to date while the U.S.C.
quintet has shown steady improve
ment. since the season opened,
Stanford will take the court a
heavy favorite to remain in its
present cellar position. However,
Hunt plans to knock over the
Southern team and has been work
ing his charges overtime during
the past few days to accomplish
this end.
Cards Scrimmage
Before announcing the trip ros
ter yesterday afternoon, the Card
mentor put several combinations
through a hard scrimmage session,
f-witching the players around from
time to time in an effort to find
a smooth-running lineup composed
of tall men. The Trojans have one
of the tallest fives on the Coast
and Hunt intends to combat them
v/ith as much height as he can
muster, which at best will appear
at- a miniature quintet alongside its
lanky rivals.
Averaging around six feet and
two inches, the men from Troy
range from slightly under the six
foot mark to four inches over. Wil
bur Caldwell, playing at guard,
towers above them all, and handles
himself well on tiie floor. Stanford
will be lucky to make any sucker
shots with Caldwell under 1 ho back
board.
Battle at Center
Next in line is Frank Smith, vet
el an center, being overshadowed
Jess than an inch by his giant team
mate. However, Troy is no cinch
to monopolize the tip-off during the
next two evenings, as Captain
Rothert jumps at the pivot posi
tion with tiie best of them. Lubin
beat the Card center out time filter
time at Westwood, but then the
Bruin beanpole stands nearly two
inches over Smith.
Besides using his reach to ad
vantage at center, Smith is an ex
cellent. shot, ringing the basket
with the greatest of ease from far
out on the hardwood and tipping
the ball in a la McCandless under
j the hoop. Coach Sam Barry, new
Trojan coach, has built his last
charging. short-passing offense
nround Smith, who is also a clever
dribbler and a bullet passer.
The only other letter man on
Barry's regular five is Captain
Johnny Lehners, guard. Although
Stanford trounced U.S.C". three
times last, winter, the Trojan
leader stood out by his defensive
play, and is likely to cause the
Farm outfit no little trouble again
this week-end.
Following are Ihe men who will
accompany Coach Hunt and
Charles Fox, team manager, on the
Los Angeles trip:
Forwards—Berg, Fawcett, Moors,
Hawkins, Weaver, Tyler, and Kay.
Centers —McCandless and Doub.
Guards —Captain Rothert, How
ley, Reynolds, and Rintala.
