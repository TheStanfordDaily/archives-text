# MONEY IN HIS NAME...
## Diegel One of Favorites to Win $25,000 Tourney on Home Course at Agua Caliente Next Week 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Leo Diegel, a golfer long overdue
to win the U.S. open championship,
is one of the favorites for the first
annual Agua Caliente $25*000 tour
nament. which starts at the Baja
California resort next week. Of
course the famous cough drop bovs,
Morton and Mac Smith, will be on
deck with plenty of backers, and
there will be lots of other splendid
golfers in the running too, but
"Lion-Hearted Leo" will be the
center of interest and the cynosure
oT all eyes because Agua Caliente
is his home grounds and lie will be
hot to win its first big tournament.
Not that the money has anything
to do with it! Oh no, not at all!
"Thar'a gold in them tliar hills!"
the professional golfers say every
December, as they point to South
ern California with its Long Beach

Open, Catalina Open, Los Angeles
Open, and other golf tournaments
with prize money totaling around
$06,000. What a battle there will
be for this fat Agua Caliente purse,
and what a place to hold a big
sporting event! I was there last,
summer and it positively knocks
your eye out, with its beautiful
hotel, casino, and surrounding
grounds. The race track, golf
course, and swimming pool were
then in the course of construction.
Leo showed his mettle not so
long ago when he retained his
P.G.A. title by defeating some of
ihe finest; professionals in the
game. He will probably never re
gret leaving the effete East, to live
in "Hot Water" (which is English
for Agua Caliente). The land of the
hot tamale, frijole, and jumping
bean is a good place to park in,
provided yon carry a machine gun
in your golf bag, and Leo gets
$15,000 a year and all club conces
sions too, so his life won't be all
a bed of cactus.
