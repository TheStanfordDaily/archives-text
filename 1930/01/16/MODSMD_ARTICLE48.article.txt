# EL CAPITAN BOWS TO ZETE QUINTET IN SLOW CONTEST
## Delia Chi Stages Rally To Down Phi Heirs By One Point 
### 
Staging a sensational and do-1
termined rally in the second half
of the contest, Delta Chi overcame j
a 19-5 lead in the linal two periods!
to down the Phi Betes 24 to 2.'! in ;
their game last night in the Eneina j
Gym. After being completely out
classed in tiie first half, the Ira- !
ternity team equally outclassed j
their opponents in the last, half,!
scoring 19 points to 4 for the Phi;
Betes.
Falk of Delta Chi, who led the
scorers with eight digits, was the
chief factor in his team's offense, I
but Pearson, lanky center, sup- j
l orted him ably.
Superior height and weight ac- !
counted for the Phi Pete's edge in i
the initial periods, While added :
fight on the part ol the Delta Chi's,
and faltering on the side* of the
Phi Betes were the main factors
in the victors' rally.
Close guarding and slightly j
superior teamwork gave Zet.a Psi j
a 19-14 victory over El Capitan in i
an uneventful game, with the score j
just about representing the true
strength of the two teams. The |
fraternity men held the lead j
through most of the contest:, being j
threatened only in the third quar-!
ter when El Capitan gained the j
edge for a few minutes.
Smith stood out for the Zetes on
the scoring end, chalking up 13 :
points to carry off the honors, j
! while Laird did some aggressive j
guarding. Heicher at center looked
good for the Capit'ans.
