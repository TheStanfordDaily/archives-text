# POLITICS MINUS INTEREST â€“ LUTZ
## Sensations Are Interests Of American Public 
### 
Politics must compete with base
ball, fashion decrees, thug murders,
and love-nest tangles before it
tickles the popular fancy. At least
that is the opinion of Dr. Harley
L. Lutz.
Dr. Lutz, formerly a professor in
the Department of Economics at.
Stanford, said yesterday, in a dis
cussion of taxation and its prob
lems before the Chamber of Com
merce in Palo Alto. "Government
business must compete with sports,
fashion, crime, and scandal news
in order to catch popular interest.
People Uninformed
"People are not interested in pub
lic affairs because they have no
adequate means of finding out what
is going on. Public officials are not
primarily interested in bringing
problems to the attention of the
people themselves. Where can you
find a government that brings its
problems before the people?"
"Tax problems lie with the local
rather than the state or national
governments," Dr. Lutz declared.
"Seventy-five per cent of the na
tional tax bill is met in the local
units. In the East, local govern
ment is developed to a higher de
gree than in the West. Many of
the cities of Florida are bankrupt,
as is the City of Chicago. Even
bankers will not lend money to the
school boards in Chicago.
Changes Needed
"A condition of 'tax-conscious
ness' must be brought about before
an adequate solution of the prob
lem facing the taxpayers of the
nation can be found."
Dr. Lutz left Stanford in August
1928 to take a position at Prince
ton University. He is an outstand
ing authority in this country on
taxation. For some time he has
been occupied with a technical
survey of the tax conditions in the
slate of Utah. A similar survey in
Wyoming will be his next project.
