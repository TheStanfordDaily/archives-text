# PRELIMINARY NAVAL DISCUSSIONS FAIL, IS BELIEF OF JAPANESE
## Bring Exchange of Views But Not Hoped-For Agreements 
### 
TOKYO, Jan. 15. (/P) Although
( fficials in*' reticent in expressing
opinions, there seems little doubt
thill they are disappointed in the
results thus far of the Anglo-
A merioan-Japa nese conversations
prior to convening of the London
Naval Conference.
From the wording of the British
invitation to the conference the
Japanese appear to have received
the impression that the preliminary
(onversations were intended to •'li
able the participants to reach early
tentative agreements. The disap
pointment that is now felt is to
some extent that the conversations
ipsulted in little more than an ex
change of views.
Faith in Wakatsuki
Comment in the native press
makes this plain, and indications
;• if not lacking that this reflects
also the official view although of
ficials are endeavoring to minimize
their disappointment and have ex
pressed the belief that Ileijiro
Wakatsuki, head of the delegation,
has at least succeeded in impress
ing Mac Donald that Japan's claim
for a seventy per cent naval ratio
is not unjustified.
Meanwhile certain Nationalist
elements are endeavoring strenu
ously In rouse the nation to the
necessity of Japan's demanding the
in 10-7 ratio, and are urging aj
resolution to this effect when the
I Met meets January 21.
If they achieve their ends the
> overnment will be embarrassed
greatly, since the opposition par
ties could make political capital
of the situation at the anticipated
general election if the government
attempts t<> turn down the resolu
tion. This the government almost
surely will do since they cannot
aflord thus to tie the hands of the
Japanese delegation at London.
