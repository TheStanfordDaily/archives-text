j i< an youth, in the opinion of Dr.
I James Rowland Angell, president
of Vale University, goes to college

Addressing Colgate alumni, lie
I said the time had come to ask if
the hunt for social prestige had
not drawn hundreds into college
who would have done better had
| they never been there.
"Colleges," he said, "should lion
!(s-.tly admit that they are obliged
' to reconceive their recruiting prob
lem and begin to be responsible
for their failure as well as for
, their achievements. When we come
together we should not only think
of the men the University lias
turned out who have become suc
cessful, but also of those who have
not met with success."
