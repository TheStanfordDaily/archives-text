Definite plans for the invasion of
English forensic circles by a crack
Pacific Coast team composed of
debaters from Stanford, University
of California, and Southern Cali
fornia, were announced last night
by Sloan McCormick, debate man
ager.
Stanford and U.C. agreed to par
ticipate in tiie venture when the
plan was first suggested. Southern
California was reluctant to co
operation, due to lack of funds.
Word was received yesterday by
McCormick that S.C. had appro
priated funds for 'lie trip and that
further arrangements could be un
dertaken.
The National Student Federation
of America is sponsoring the tour.
Martha Biehle, past vice-president
of tiie organization and now secre
tory, is in charge. Campus arrange
ments will he handled hy McCor
mick and John McClintock.
In order to be in England by
April 20 which is the date of tiie
first debate, the team will sail
from New York about the sixth or
eighth. Although the schedule has
not yet been made out, about three
weeks will be spent debating ques
tions with English colleges. No de
bates will be made on the way
over or back.
Coach James Gordon Emerson,
frculty members, and graduate de
baters familiar with English argu
mentation, will choose the Stan
ford representative from the pres
ent debate squad on merit of his
past records and without tryout.
