# GOLDONI'S PLAY DEPARTS FROM CONVENTIONAL COMEDY STYLE
## 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
Departing quite unconventionally
i from the commedia dell' arte form,
| in which only type characters were
portrayed, Carlo Goldoni, author of
"The Mistress of the Inn" which
will be presented here on February
7, uses in ibis classic play realistic
charactersâ€”but obvious, rather
than subtle, ones.
Very amusing, and totally dif
ferent, are all of the suitors who
woo at the feet of the fascinating
Mirandolina, mistress of the inn.
; Direct rivals for her hand are the
' Marquis of Forlipopoli and the
I Count of Albafiorita. In an allegor
i icalplay they might, well be named
Mr, Protection and Mr. Dollar re
-1 spectively. The marquis, whose
noble heritage is merely one of
name and rank, generously offers
! Mirandolina his "protection," de
claring its worth superior to all of
the costly gifts laid at the shrine
of Mirandolina by the opulent
I count. The rount, naturally, be
lieves in the power of the dollar
when it comes to courtship and acts
accordingly.
Entertaining Charaster
Even more entertaining and just
as obvious is the Cavalier of Ftipa
fratta. who succumbs to the charms
of the hostess only after a struggle.

The audience, or Ihe reader, is
made the cavalier's confidant in the
matter of his painful waverings
between woman-hating and com
plete adoration of Mirandolina.
The mistress of tlie inn, herself,
is being interpreted as a. little more
subtle than the others in the cast.
Like all women (in plays at least),
she reacts in a contrary manner
to all her admirers, telling only
the audience of her hopes and
plans. And again, like all women
in plays, she comes forth with a
big surprise at the end.
Disclose Enterprises
Most obvious of all, and thor
oughly comic are the two actresses,
, Peianira and Ortensia, who regis
ter at the Inn early in the play,
I much to the relief of some, and
! equally to tin* despair of others.
The latter leads, and the former
follows. Not only do they tell the
: audience of their ambitious enter-
I prises, but through Deianira's fail
j uie to play her part, they soon give
j away their plans to the wily mis
! tress.
Interesting, also, is Fabricius,
Italian servant at the inn. and an
other aspirant to the hand of
Mirandolina. Wholly different from
the other men in the play, hi' tries
to fathom his fickle mistress, and
; shrugging his shoulders, gives up.
