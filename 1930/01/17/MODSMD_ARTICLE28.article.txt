# ALL STANFORD SENDS FELICITATIONS
## 
### 
A lifetime of humanitarian service. Years of progress and of
adversity. All will be celebrated Sunday on the Stanford campus
when Dr. Jordan observes his seventy-ninth birthday and the whole
University community honors Stanford's first President. From an
Obscure Xew York farmer lad endowed with an insatiable curiosity
concerning the world about him, Dr. Jordan, by his clear thinking
and sturdy independence, rose to world eminence ar a natural scien
tist and a prophet of peace.
But it is not for his fame that he has commanded the respect and
won the love of students and faculty alike on the campus. His per
sonal charm and warm sympathy for every acquaintance have en
deared him to all the faculty and to generation after generation of
Stanford men and women. Dr. Jordan's illness, which last year
forced him to suspend the Thursday evening conferences in his
home, deprived the campus of its.most inspiring molder of character.
W hen the world was descending into the maelstrom of war, Dr.
Jordan courageously maintained his humanitarian stand that "all war
is murder, robbery, trickery, and no nation ever escaped the losses
of men, prosperity, and virility. For his clear vision and independ
ence, he was roundly criticized at the time, but now with a chastened
world earnestly seeking to follow the paths he blazed, Stanford's
Chancellor Emeritus stands justified and holds a place of honor to
which few may aspire.
As a leader in science, a pioneer in education, and a prophet of
peace. Dr. Jordan greets his seventy ninth year while all Stanford
sends felicitations.
