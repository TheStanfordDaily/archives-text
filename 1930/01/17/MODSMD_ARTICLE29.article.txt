# COMMON COURTESY IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED
## 
### 
It is bad enough when campus boors are permitted
to insult visiting lecturers by tramping noisily into the
Assembly Hall after the speaker has begun, but the ex
hibition which took place Wednesday evening at the
Zimbalist concert was the crowning affront to good
taste.
Zimbalist, a real artist, endured rudeness that one of
a less temperamental profession might well have fierce
ly resented. Only in the back country do people annoy
a musician by entering the hall while he is playing, and
by leaving just as he is about to begin an encore.
If those in charge of the concert expect patronage,
they will instruct the ushers to seat late comers only be
tween numbers. The system used Wednesday night evi
denced poor taste, poor management, and an utter lack
of judgment. It was an insult to the artist and to the
music lovers who came to listen.
Those on this campus who have any regard for com
mon courtesy or any desire to enjoy real music should
protest en masse. The concert, as conducted, was a dis
grace to Stanford.
