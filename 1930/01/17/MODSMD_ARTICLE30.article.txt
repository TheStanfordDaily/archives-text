# THE 						EX COMMITTEE MEANS BUSINESS
## 
### 
Some thirteen years ago the country was vastly concerned with
war and with slackers. Today, here at Stanford, student body gov
ernment is on the verge of collapse with the recruiting of moral
slackers as participants in determining local autonomy. Although
selection of committees to carry on student affairs was made last
quarter by the Executive Committee, many of these bodies have not
met as yet and those functioning are transacting business with less
than half of the organization members present.
Today the outcome of the situation is as important to Stanford
as the result of the World War was to the nations of the globe. The
future of student government lies in the hands of these procrastinat
ing and disinterested slackers, who, through political pull and favor
currying, have been appointed to reputable offices for the mere sake
of saying they are on this or that committee. That this condition has
wrought its effects on local government is seen in the indifference
of students toward official student body acts.
To strengthen student body administration, the Daily recom
mends that the Executive Committee enforce its requirement that
complete reports of each committee's work to date be made by Janu
ary 28, and further, that those members who have retarded the com
mittee's work be compelled to resign.
