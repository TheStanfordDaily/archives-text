LOOK HOMEWARD, ANGEL. By
Thomas Wolfe. (Charles Scrib
ners' Sons, Publishers. New
York. 1929.)
It is natural that one should
compare this story of a family in
a small town of the South with
those novels of Midwestern com
munities which have enjoyed some
thing of a vogue during the past
few years. "Look Homeward, An
gel" bears such comparison well;
it is a more truthful picture than
a great majority of. its predeces
sors.
Wolfe, when he turns to satire,
i.3 no less clever than is Sinclair
lit wis, but lie does not allow hLs
book to he a caricature of life. He
shows, also, the ugly anil inane,
but he does not omit the more
pleasant illusions with which peo
ple make life more bearable.
The characters and their con
flicts, as well as the style of the
author, cause the novel to sustain
interest throughout. There are ex
amples of the attitudes of different
types of people to literature and
to many other matters, and one is
entertained and refreshed by chap
tors of satire such as the one which
describes the war hysteria of a
university campus 111 1918.
Wolfe's symbolism i3 good, but
it does not fit in well with the
other portions of work. Edi
torial comments and exclamations
are not in tone with the realism
of the story, and the last chapter,
while excellent, in itself, comes as
a puzzling shock.
Observations of the psychology
of the characters and their emo
tions are often impressive in their
truth, for they reveal reactions of
which very few persons ever speak.
An outstanding example is the al
most irrepressible impulse to iaugh
which is felt by those most deeply
touched by grief, while others, who
care less, turn naturally to the
tears which are expected in such
a situation.
As the first work of an author
who is under thirty years of age,
"Look Homeward, Angel" is a sur
prisingly good book. As an attempt
at the fusion of the ordinarily sepa
rate types of romanticism and real
ism, it is poor, but it is a step
along a road which will lead to a
high type of art. —E. E. W.
SALT WA.TER TAFFY. By Corey
Ford. (G. P. Putnam's Sons,
1929.)
"Salt Water Taffy, or Twenty
Thousand Leagues Away from the
Sea," by, according to the title
page, "June Triplett," is Corey
Ford's uproarious parody of Joan
Lowell's "Cradle of the Deep."
This book begins as a mild take
oft on Miss Lowell's highly improb
t'ble though extremely popular
story of her life as a child and a
young woman in a ship's crew com
posed entirely of men. The glaring
discrepancies in her tale are told
in an even more impossible way
and are made quietly amusing. In
the course of the volume, the par
ody becomes more ribald until the
amusement ceases to be quiet and
btcomes almost Rabelaisian.
Miss Lowell's slight confusion on
the matter of the name of her
father's ship is exaggerated. The
names in "Salt. Water Taffy" vary

from the Edith M. ll'lnntun through
the Mabel ll'. H'ilU'hnwdt and the
C Inra 11. Bow to the Mrs. lid wo rd F.
Conn. The ship's personality changes
Willi the episodes ol' the story. The
incident wherein the young girl
learns about sex from the dissec-1
tion of a female shark is made
ridiculous by having her find a
copy- of "What Every Girl Should
Know" within the fish. In a foot
note at this point, Miss "Triplett"
says: "There has l been some ob
jection to this part of my story
on the grounds that the shark is ■
not a mammal and therefore she
could not contain a copy of 'What
Every Young Girl Should Know.' i
My only answer to this is that 1
suppose tlie New York Public Li
brary is not a mammal either."
The pictures which illustrate ;
"Salt, Water Taffy" were posed by
well known people in' the fields of
arts and letters. Knut Hamsun is j
the? funniest of these. All the pho
tographs are amusing; and one in
particular, entitled "Seduction Ad
Absurdum," is utterly ludicrous.
"Salt Water Taffy" is the kipd j
of a book which bears reading
aloud. It will set a group of not
too serious-minded people to howl- i
ing. It is the kind ot a book to read '
in bed where you can roll and roar I
with laughter. If you have read 1
"Cradle of the Deep," by all means i
read the parody. If -you haven't
read "Cradle of the Deep," read
the parody anyway. —J. R.
LA ARGENTINA—Geary Theatre. l
La Argentina, famous Spanish j
dancer, again returned to San Fran- j
cisco last Tuesday to repeat her
former triumphs there. Much had
been said of the dancer's grace
and talent, and those who saw her
for the first time at the matinee
performance, left the theatre not j
a whit disappointed.
Mine. Argentina is typically a t
modern artist, and yet her dances
have much of the beauty of old
Spain. Perhaps the most remark- j
able feature of her performance is
her use of the castanets. The per
fect rhythm she maintains through
cut the intricacies of the dance and
Ihe expression she manages to in
still into the wooden instruments
is extraordinary.
The dance's presented by Mm* 3 . ,
Argentina, which are all her own
creations, are widely different, j
though all are fundamentally Span
ish. The Andalusian Dance and j
Granados' Dance No. 5 are allur
ing ami vivacious. The "Cielo de
Cuba" and "El Carotin" are more
bizarre and display all of the art
ist's delightful humor.
While Mine, Argentina's tech
nique is not as varied as it could
he, her grace and charm make up
for any lack there might be in this
respect. The dancer's costumes are
superb, each different one bringing
fresh applause from the crowded
house.
The combination of charm, ori
ginality, talenl, and huiiior, which
La Argentina possesses make her
undoubtedly one of the world's
foremost dancers as well as a
fascinating personality.
La Argentina wlil give a final
performance in San Francisco Sun
day afternoon at the Geary theatre.
