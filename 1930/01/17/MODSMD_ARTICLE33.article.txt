College teaching is one of the
most rapidly growing of the major
professions of today. In 1926 there
were 62,224 college and university
teachers in the United States, a
gain of 45 per cent, in six years.
Despite the fact, that the period
of apprenticeship and training is
very long, the average university
teacher seldom reaching the rank
of professor before forty years of
age.
The distinction between college
find university teaching must be
noted. The college, which gives
the foundational and orienting edu
cation to a less selected number,
lays stress upon the teaching abil
ity of its staff. The university, giv
ing professional training of an ad
vanced sort, demands of its faculty
teaching ability plus the ability
and willingness to do research and
to make original contributions.
Ranking and salary scale is defi
nite and fixed for most institutions.
The first three years as an assist
ant professor are considered as a
period of probation. If u man is not
then promoted to the rank of as
sociate professor, hr* is either re
quested to go or allowed to remain
and stagnate. Four to five years of
further service as an associate
usually follow before a man is
ranked as professor.
Salary scales vary for each uni
versity or college. The scale set at
Stanford in 1916 ar.d still operative
is: Instructors $ 1800 to $2400; As
sistant Professors $2500 to $3000;
Associate Professors $3250 to
$4000; Professors $4500 to $7500.
The range of average salaries for
the state universities of Michigan,
Illinois, Ohio, and Kentucky in 1924
was: Instructors $1645 to $1961;
Assistant Professors $2290 to
$2918; Associate Professors $l!4('Â»0
to $3776; Professors $3090 to $5240.

, In 1927 eighty-six universities
were operating under u plan of the
Carnegie Foundation providing /for
i annuity payments for life after re- |
tirement at Ihe age of sixty-five.
1 Approximately $1,330,000 was paid j
! in these allowances in 11)26-27.
! Long tenure and stability of em
j ployment is an important advan
i tage in the compensation of a col
lege teacher. Once a university pro
lessor is established he ordinarily
has a position for life.
I There is no limit to the training 1
period of a college teacher. Either
; the Ph.D. degree or special doctor's
degrees, such as the M l)., are re
, quired of all persons entering the
I college teaching profession. Such ,
; degrees call for a minimum of
seven years of college work, of j
which at least the last two must
evidence a high degree of inde
pendence and originality.
The value of the Ph.D. as a teach
' ing degree depends largely upon '
I the standing of t lie institution be- I
I stowing it. Stanford holds an en
j viable reputation among universi-!
ties of the United States. Standing i
| forty-seventh in number of stu
dents among the institutions of j
this country, Stanford ranks six-:
i t< entli in number of Ph.D.'s granted
! (l'.t2(J). The School of Education i
j ranks ninth in number of doctor's
degrees in Education.
