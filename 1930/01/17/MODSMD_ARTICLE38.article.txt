# SIDELINE LANTS...
## CUTTING OUR OWN THROATS 
### 
IV!J*. Joe Referee, who acted in
he capacity of head lloor-walker a
ouple of nights ago ill the slow
iini penalty-retarded cage fracas
Jetween the Stanford Yearlings
nd the Stockton Tarzans, can
hank his lucky stars that the
i A O, strictly forbids the sale of
cda water in the Pavilion, and
hat as a rule the watchers of hoop
truggles on the Farm are not en
hused enough to carry glassware
>n the hip.
From the way the easily-ired
crowd ot frobh supporters re
• eivrd his all too numerous
and, perhaps, doubtful deci
sions, he should have been a
rvio;.t excellent tarijet fur flying
pop bottles. Standing there on
the hardwood, decked out in a
yebra-like jockey suit, Mr. Joe
Referee would have taken the
count m a much more assured
and permanent fashion than
Fainting Phil bcott, the Eng
lish canvas necker.
We hear of Blind Tom Umpires
n baseball games quite frequently,
it whom profane oaths accom
panied hy so in h convincing missiles
ire hurled, but very seldom, out
ide of Punkin Center, does a bas
ic tball official receive such a hoot-
Cxg and howling as did Mr. Joe
Reteree the other evening.
Of course, Mr. Joe Referee
must have been a little off color
in rendering his verdicts, or
the crowd would not have arti
culated so loud and long. But,
even so, the spectators showed
the poorest of judgment in
their verbal retaliation. Not
lhat one could expect them to
sit and suffer, yet, considering
the seats were supplied gratis,
they could nave walked out on
the house in utter contempt.
For, anyway, an evening at the
Library would have been much
more exciting ihan the game
itself.
It really didn't matter socially
(hat the watching culprits did hoot
,nd howl, except in that it failed
to impress the visiting team and
its coach as being a bit collegiate.
Air. Joe Referee didn't seem to
mind and took it more or less as a
joke, which was on himself, but
the Stockton lads' impressions of
Stanford were not thereby en
hanced.
"Small town stuff," was the way
one of the visiting players dei
scribed the affair.
Before censuring the spec
tators too severely and chas
tising the student sports fans
lor their lack of true and gen
tlemanly Stanford spirit, which
has come to the front on sev
eral other occasions this year,
however, one must remember
that a large majority of the
sideline critics were mere
freshmen, youthful lads inex
perienced in the ways and eti
quette of the college sporting
world. First-year men at all in
stitutions of higher education
are most apt to be unruly and
rot properly versed in the man
ners becoming of learned uni
versity men.
In all due respects 1o Dr. Ter
man and his all-wise colleagues, it
seems that these universally es
teemed psychology critics have
overlooked this angle entirely when
drawing up their final drafts of
Aptitude and other college en
trance tests. Etiquette, apparent
ly, must be imbibed from experi
ence after the candidates have ac
tually ciashed the college gates.
At any rate, the Daily hopes
that these frosh "hooters," and
the few upperclassmen who j
have remained in this unenlight
ened class, will turn over a '
new leaf in the near future and
act as Stanford men should act I

at the various athletic con
tests. "Small town stuff," if
continued, will only tend to
drive prospective athletic stars
arid other students to institu
tions of less "razzberries"!

Before censuring the spec
tators too severely and chas
tising the student sports fans
lor their lack of true and gen
tlemanly Stanford spirit, which
has come to the front on sev
eral other occasions this year,
however, one must remember
that a large majority of the
sideline critics were mere
freshmen, youthful lads inex
perienced in the ways and eti
quette of the college sporting
world. First-year men at all in
stitutions of higher education
are most apt to be unruly and
rot properly versed in the man
ners becoming of learned uni

In all due respects 1o Dr. Ter
man and his all-wise colleagues, it
seems that these universally es
teemed psychology critics have
overlooked this angle entirely when
drawing up their final drafts of
Aptitude and other college en
trance tests. Etiquette, apparent

ence after the candidates have ac
tually ciashed the college gates.
At any rate, the Daily hopes
that these frosh "hooters," and
the few upperclassmen who j
have remained in this unenlight
ened class, will turn over a '
new leaf in the near future and
act as Stanford men should act I

at the various athletic con
