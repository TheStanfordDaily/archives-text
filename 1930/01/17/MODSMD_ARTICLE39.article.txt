# Fawcett Out Of Trojan P.C.C. Tilts
## STANFORD HOPES SLUMP ON EVE OF U.S.C. ENCOUNTERS Hawkins, Tyler to Open at Forward Tonight; Mears May See Action 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Willi news that Vance Fawcett,
veteran forward, has been added
to the hospital list and may not be
in sh,ape to see action this week
end, Stanford's chances of upset
ling the Trojan cagers in a Con-
It rem e double-header down at Los
Angeles tonight and tomorrow have
taken a decided slump. Already
touted its the team to give the
Urn ins a good run for the title,
I'.S.C. has been established heavy
favorites over the invading Cards.
Fawcett, one of the cleverest
dribblers and passers on the Coast
and key man to Husky i-lunt'p of
fence, was forced out of play yes
terday afternoon because of a bad
cold. However, the flashy forward
made the trip South with the rest
of the squad last night, and may I
get into at least one of the tilts.
Hawkins Starts
Before leaving for the land of
Troy yesterday evening, the Red
shirt mentor announced that Bud
Hawkins will probably take Faw- ,
cett's place in the starting lineup.
According to Hunt, Hawkins has
been showing up well in practice
during the past few days. "Haw
kins has great possibilities," added
the Card coach, "and 1 expect him
to come through in good shape
against the Trojans."
Paired with Hawkins at the for
ward berths will be Don Tyler, who
lias replaced Red Berg during the
past week. Tyler's presence on the
floor adds a little height to the .
Card lineup, which will be greatly
handicapped in size in meeting the
lanky Trojan quintet, tallest col
lege team on the Coast. Jimmy
Miars has also been slrifted from i
guard to forward by Hunt, and
will probably get into both games
when the going gets 100 tough.
Battle At Center
Captain Harlow Rothert will he
in his usual position at center,
dropping back on defense after the
tip-off. Although out jumped by
Li.bin, Bruin pivot man, last week
and overshadowed nearly three
inches by Frank Smith, his center
rival this week-end, Rothert may
be expected to get the tip off his
share of the time as he has a
habit of out-reaching taller oppon
ents.
The same pair of guards, Johnny
McCandless and Milt. Rowley, that
started the U.C.L.A. fracas, will
open again for Stanford tonight.
Although the Bruins hung up a rec
ord score against the Cards, Hunt,
was entirely satisfied with the
playing of his defensive men, and
expects them to stop the high
powered Trojan attack quite ef
fectively. The only reason U.C.L.A.
ran up such a big point total, said
Hunt, was because the Bruins were
exceptionally hot at looping the
basket from out past, the foul line.
Yesterday's practice session was

confine'd to offensive play and foul
shooting. The Cards liuve had a
hard time locating the hoop all
week, and unless I liny ring up
points with more regularity tonight
and tomorrow, Stanford is in for
a bad trouncing. The Redshirls
have been weak in sinking free
throws all season, losing one of
their early games because of this
inability.
Following are the probable line
ups for tonight's battle:
Trojans— Cards —
Gardner F Hawkins
Pierce F Tyler
Smith 0 Rothert (o)

Caldwell G McCandless

Hawkins Starts
Before leaving for the land of
Troy yesterday evening, the Red
shirt mentor announced that Bud
Hawkins will probably take Faw- ,
cett's place in the starting lineup.
According to Hunt, Hawkins has
been showing up well in practice
during the past few days. "Haw
kins has great possibilities," added
the Card coach, "and 1 expect him
to come through in good shape
against the Trojans."
Paired with Hawkins at the for
ward berths will be Don Tyler, who
lias replaced Red Berg during the
past week. Tyler's presence on the
floor adds a little height to the .
Card lineup, which will be greatly
handicapped in size in meeting the
lanky Trojan quintet, tallest col
lege team on the Coast. Jimmy
Miars has also been slrifted from i
guard to forward by Hunt, and
will probably get into both games
when the going gets 100 tough.
Battle At Center
Captain Harlow Rothert will he
in his usual position at center,
dropping back on defense after the
tip-off. Although out jumped by
Li.bin, Bruin pivot man, last week
and overshadowed nearly three
inches by Frank Smith, his center
rival this week-end, Rothert may
be expected to get the tip off his
share of the time as he has a
habit of out-reaching taller oppon
ents.
The same pair of guards, Johnny
McCandless and Milt. Rowley, that
started the U.C.L.A. fracas, will
open again for Stanford tonight.
Although the Bruins hung up a rec
ord score against the Cards, Hunt,
was entirely satisfied with the
playing of his defensive men, and
expects them to stop the high
powered Trojan attack quite ef
fectively. The only reason U.C.L.A.
ran up such a big point total, said
Hunt, was because the Bruins were
exceptionally hot at looping the
basket from out past, the foul line.
Yesterday's practice session was

confine'd to offensive play and foul
shooting. The Cards liuve had a
hard time locating the hoop all
week, and unless I liny ring up
points with more regularity tonight
and tomorrow, Stanford is in for
a bad trouncing. The Redshirls
have been weak in sinking free
throws all season, losing one of
their early games because of this
inability.
Following are the probable line
ups for tonight's battle:
Trojans— Cards —
Gardner F Hawkins
Pierce F Tyler
Smith 0 Rothert (o)
Leliners (c) G Rowley
Caldwell G McCandless
Willi news that Vance Fawcett,
veteran forward, has been added
to the hospital list and may not be
in sh,ape to see action this week
end, Stanford's chances of upset
ling the Trojan cagers in a Con-
It rem e double-header down at Los
Angeles tonight and tomorrow have
taken a decided slump. Already
touted its the team to give the
Urn ins a good run for the title,
I'.S.C. has been established heavy
favorites over the invading Cards.
Fawcett, one of the cleverest
dribblers and passers on the Coast
and key man to Husky i-lunt'p of
fence, was forced out of play yes
terday afternoon because of a bad
cold. However, the flashy forward
made the trip South with the rest
of the squad last night, and may I
get into at least one of the tilts.
