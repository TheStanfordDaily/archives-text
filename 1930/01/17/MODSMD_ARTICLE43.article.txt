points of basketball technique. The '
< 'ards have experienced little trou j
ble in winning their last ' four
starts, and with (he renewal of the

Pavilion.
However, when the Cards meet
Palo Alto's unlimited basketball
team here Saturday, evening, they

( rack. Coach Howard Ray has one I
of the strongest teams in the Penin- j
sula Athletic League and will give !
the baby Redshirts a real test. The j
Vikings have displayed some bril- !
iiant. playing this season, including
a'i impressive win over San Mateo.
Lowell High should not give the
freshmen much cause for worry.

put some good teams on the floor, |
end may give. the Redshirts an in
teresting game.
Freshman Record
In the last two years, Stanford i
frosh basketball teams have made
very impressive records. In 1931,
tin- yearlings went through the,
season undefeated until the Cali

record was nearly as perfect. And
this year the Cards have dropped
cne out. of live starts, still leaving
' room for another good record.

for the Card-Viking contest are: j
Stanford —Meade and Palmer, I
iorwards; Edelen, center; Tway

Palo Alto —LaCombe and Shaw,
forwards; Ericson, center; Misen- 1
