## 100% Return of Varsity, Good New Material Bid Fair for 1930 
### Reid Briggs 
"Swimming in the rain" â€”that's i
what Stanford swimmers and water
polo men are doing while the wet !
weather puts other sports on the j
shelf. Every afternoon brings sev- '
eral dozen out to practice in En- ,
j cina pool.
j Water in the three tanks of the
! pool is heated, and clouds of vapor
j arise into the chilly atmosphere, j
; But this doesn't prevent Coach
I Ernst Brandsten from bringing the
mermen into shape for the com- j
ing schedule.
Just now, Brandsten is pointing '
his efforts toward the swimming:
meet and water polo game with i
California. The meet will be held!
on Saturday, March J, followed by j
I the polo contest on the following
Saturday. The rest of the sched- 1
tile has not been definitely fixed.
Clapp, Desjardins Back
The varsity swimming team of j
i last year is back 100 per cent, and !
! is reinforced by strong additions j
! from the 1929 frosh team. Last j
| year Stanford defeated Oregon, j
| California, Southern California, and
| 1.C.L.A., and dropped the meet j
with Northwestern by one point, j
With a. strengthened team, pros- |
pect3 for this season are unusually j
bright.
Austin Clapp, sophomore, prom- 1
ises to be outstanding in the 220- j
yard and relay events. In Ihe 192S
Olympics he swam the fastest lap
on the winning American relay
team. Pete Desjardins is another
Olympic star. Twice he'has repre
sented the United States at the
Games. In him Stanford has un
questionably one of the foremost
divers of the country. Backing him
up will be Ed Throndson, rated by :
Swimming Guide as one of the j
country's ten best intercollegiate
divers. Last year he defeated*Wally j
Colbath, national champion, in the
Northwestern meet.
Frosh Men Promising
Frank Booth and Ferd Fletcher !
are two speedy men from last
year's frosh squad. Booth swims
both free-style and back stroke in
fast time. Fletcher's event is the
breast-stroke, where he swims a
tight, race with Milt Burns. Burns,
a varsity man last year, does pretty
close' to national intercollegiate
time.
