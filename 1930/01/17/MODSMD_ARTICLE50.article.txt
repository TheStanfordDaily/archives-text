### 
Stanford formerly was the home
(<f the much-famed Roble bridge,
and if present plans of the Board
of Athletic Control are followed
j the campus will also be the scene
of one of the few water holes on a
j California golf course, according to
word from Comptroller A. E. Roth's
office yesterday.
B.A.C. plans call for a dam to
be built across San Francisquito
Creek at the former site of the old
bridge. The dam will be used to
provide a water hazard for the
1 third hole of the new golf course,
and also a bridge across the creek.
Water holes in California are not
prevalent except in the rainy sea
son. Pebble Beach golf enthusiasts
use the Pacific Ocean as one of
| the water hazards, as do several
other seaside courses, but the pres
ence of (lie Pacific Ocean beside
some courses will not detract in the
j least from the fame that will come
to Stanford because of its water
hazard.
