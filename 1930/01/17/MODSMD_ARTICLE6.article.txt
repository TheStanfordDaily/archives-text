# CALVIN COOLIDGE WRITES HISTORY
## To Compose Inscription For Huge Statues 
### 
KEYSTONE, S.D., Jan. 10. (/P)â€”
Calvin Coolidge is to write a his
tory of the United States with an
assured popularity for 5,000 cen
turies.
It is to be as brief and terse as
the former President's conversa
tion.
And, although Mr. Coolidge is
one of the highest paid writers per
word, he' will not receive a cent
for the narrative.
The former President, according
to the Mt. Rush more National Me
morial Association, has accepted an
invitation to write historical data
to be engraved beside the colossal
figures of Washington, Jefferson,
Lincoln, and Roosevelt upon the
granite face of the Black Hills
mountain. Mt. Rushmore is near
Keystone.
The history will be Mr. Coolidge's
contribution to the memorial
which he dedicated during his sum
mer vacation in the Black Hills in
1027.
