On being questioned concerning
possibility o ft he creation of a de
partment of education in the presi
dent's cabinet, Dr. Wilbur declared
that, standardization of educational
methods by a federal office of edu
cation should be avoided. Such uni
formities are contrary to the very
essentials of education, he said.
"Outstanding successes of both
flit- past and present have been due
to the individualities of America's
educational system," Dr. Wilbur
stated.
In clearing up the hodge-podge
of the Interior Department, one of
the first changes ordered by Dr.
Wilbur was the transfer of rein
deer herds control from"the Office
of Education to the Territory of
A lw.sk a.
Regarding the administration's
plan eventually to construct addi
tional dormitories, Dr. Wilbur said
that, funds are not available as yet
for the realization of the project.
When such a housing program
is undertaken. Stanford will be
placed in a distinctly advantageous
position in this regard among
American universities, Dr. Wilbur
believes.
Brought to California on a num
ber of official errands, Dr. Wilbur
plans to continue his program of
conservation by installing the unit
plan of operation in the Kettleman
Hills district.
"Conservation must play na all
important part in the development
«>• Kettleman Hills," he said. "Drill
ing must be regulated in this field,
where there are billions of gallons
of oil."
