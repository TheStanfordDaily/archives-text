# POSSIBILITIES OF LONDON NAVAL PARLEY REVEALED IN INTERVIEWS FOR DAILY
## Sprout Expresses Grounds For Hope in Compromise Of Maritime Nations 
### Philip Humphreys 
Commenting on a situation of
i grave possibilities, which exists in
| the convention of the Five Power
! Naval Conference which begins in
! London tomorrow morning, Acting
Assistant Professor Harold E.
Sprout, in the Political Science l)e-
I partment, today summarizes for
j "Daily" readers the contentions of
I the representative nations and calls
attention 'to the consequences
which might follow a period of bit
ter competition in naval arma
ments among the great maritime
nations of the world.
Dr. Sprout is unusually well
qualified, through the nature and
extent of his training in the field
of international law and relations,
| to discuss tlie problems confront
■ ii g the nations represented at. the
: London Conference. His commen-'
; tary follows:
Washington Conference
"On January 21st, representa
| tives of five nations—Great Bri-
I tain, United States, Japan, France, j
j and Italy—will meet in London to i
reaume the task of limiting, by in
' ternational agreement, the strength ;
of their respective naval arma
; ments. At the Washington Confer- J
• ence of 1921-22, the governments
| oi these nations agreed to a limita
j tion upon their capital ship ton
j nage based on a ratio of
! 5:5:3:1.75:1.75, respectively, but
I made little progress in other as
pects of naval armaments beyond ;
establishing a maximum tonnage j
unit for ships of the cruiser type.
"The failure of the. Geneva Con
ference, called in 1927 by President
Coolidge, but attended only by
J representatives of Great Britain, j
; United States, and Japan, to agree j
upon a plan for limiting naval com-
I petition with respect to cruisers, j
focussed attention in British coun
tries, the United States, and else
where, upon the gravity of the in
ternational naval situation. The
election of President Hoover and
the defeat of the conservative Bald
win ministry in Great Britain af
forded an occasion for renewal ol'
negotiations, wliicli culminated in
the recent visit of Prime Minister
McDonald to this country, and a
call for another Five Power Con
ference to he held in London.
Intricate Problems
"The problems, which the dele
gates must face at the conference,
are intricate to an amazing degree,
and it is manifestly impossible to
review them adequately in a few
words. The general positions of the
five governments may bo sum
marized, perhaps, as follows: The
government of the United States
demands a greater number of
la.ger cruisers than should be alot
ted to the British, but will accept
a lesser total number of ships, on
the grounds that actual parity in
naval defense can be obtained only
in this manner, due, in part, to the
many and widely dispersed naval
stations possessed by the British
Government.
"The British Government insists
upon a greater number of total
ships, than should be allotted to
the Americans, on the grounds that
the longer coastline of British ter
ritories requires such a force lor
adequate defense. The Japanese
Government seems likely to expect
a somewhat larger ratio of cruiser
strength, than they received at the
Washington Conference with re
spect to capital ships, and to insist
upon the translation of the ratio
into ships on the basis of the num
ber and size of cruisers allotted
to the United States, to which the
British may be expected to object.
"The French Government be
lieves that defense requirements
necessitate a cruiser and subma
rine tonnage much greater than
the Washington Conference capital
ship ratios would permit, and the
Italian Government may insist
upon naval strength equal to the
French. To agree to the French
and Italian demands, the British
must abandon the policy of main
taining naval strength in the Medi
terranean greater than the com
bined strength of the Italian and
Fiench fleets.
"The most optimistic observer
must admit that the London Con
ference, to accomplish any real
limitation in naval armaments,
must overcome tremendous obsta
cles. it seems doubtful if any sun
stant in 1 reduction of naval armn

merits will Ijp realized. There In
grounds for hope, however, that
tlip representatives of the five na
tions v.ill ho able sufficiently to
compromise their conflicting inter
ests to reach an agreement for
limiting substantially the naval
bliilding programs of the future.
Hoover's Hopes
"In the words of President
Hoover, 'Upon the conference . . .
will depend such moderation us we
can make in naval expenditure. If
we shall he compelled to undertake
the naval construction program
. . . which would appear to be
necessary if no international agree
ment. can be completed, we shall
he committed during the next six
years to a construction expendi
ture of upward of $1,200,000,000 lie
sides the necessary further in
crease in costs for annual upkeep.'
"Finally, il may be fitting to call
attention to grave international
cr nsequences which might follow
a period of bitter competition in
naval armaments between the
great maritime nations of the
world. It is to be hoped by all
thoughtful citizens that the Lou
den Conference may reach some
alternative."
