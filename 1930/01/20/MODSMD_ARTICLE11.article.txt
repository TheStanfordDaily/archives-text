"lii considering the possibility
of a satisfactory outcome of the
London naval conference, it is im
portarit to keep in mind the poli
cies of the governments to he rep
resented," said Professor Ichihashi
of the History Department, in an
interview granted to the Daily yes
terdayl
"The attitude of the Hoover ad
ministration in the United States
is a liberal-minded one, while
Great Britain will be represented
by Prime Minister Mac Donald, per
haps the most liberal-minded lead
er in the English government," he
continued. "Japan, too, with the
policies of the party now in con
trol, will have a representative
who will he in a position to con
sider compromise."
Clemenceau Politics
Professor Ichihashi believes,
| however, that France, with Clemen
i ceau policies predominating, and
Italy, under the Mussolini regime,
; will he the countries most difficult
â€¢to please. In the French resent
ment of the parity between the
I United States and Great Britain,
and the refusal of Italy to consent
|to Mediterranean parity with
France, he sees a thorn in the side
of the conference which will prob
ably cause trouble.
"France is holding a ratio that
she is really not able to maintain
financially, but she is not willing
!to concede that point," he con
i tinned. "Italy, though worse off
tDa 11 France financially, is playing
! a clever game by declaring that if
France increases her navy, Italy
will do likewise. None of the
( powers but the United States is
! financially capable of undertaking
an extensive ship-building program,
i however.
i
"We hear a great deal about sub
marine scrapping," ii<* Raid, "and
i from the preis and other sources
people have been led to believe
Dial the United States is prepared
to scrap her submarine;?, wliieh is
not trtie. Great Britain would wel
come a submarine scrapping pro
1 gram, and consent to such an
agreement would come from the
United States only as a diplomatic
concession to England.
"Another obstacle which will be
ei,countered is the ratio of 11) to ti
between the United Slates and
Japan, which the latter has never
11111 y accepted," he continued,
i "Japan's view that a ratio of 10
to 7 is necessary for adequate de
fense is opposed by Lhe United
States, and though I have request
ed reasons from both nations for
, their contentions, neither has of
fered arguments to substantiate
their claims. Why? Perhaps their
reasons are of a sort that cannot
Lk' made public."
Predicts Failure
Ichihashi, who attended the
i Washington naval conference, be
lieves that though some of the
! technicalities will be cleared up,
effective naval disarmament will
I probably not be accomplished in
| the coming conference.
"If disarmament is to become a
reality," he concluded, '"not only
iu naval but in land and air forces
a bo, the five powers must lead the
; way, not by words, but by action."
