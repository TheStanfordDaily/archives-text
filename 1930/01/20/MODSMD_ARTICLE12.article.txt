# MAC DONALD HAS FULL CONFIDENCE
## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 1!» (TP). —Ramsay
I Mac Donald heads the British dele
| gation at the London armaments
! conference beginning January 21
| ar a Prime Minister with full con
j fidence of his country. This is de
| spite the fact tlmt his is a minority
j Labor government.
A combination of the 2T»B Con-
I servatives and the f>7 Liberals
! could easily overthrow Mac Donald,
i supported by 290 Labor members
I of the House of Commons. But. I lie
opposition has been careful not to
I defeat the government; another
| general election just now would be
i expensive, perhaps indecisive.
But tiie domestic prestige of the
j Laborite government has been
marred by tragic unemployment,
coal, textiles, foreign markets, and
i perplexing problems of Empire
; trade. Revolt has developed within
; the Labor party itself, but thus far
j the rebels have only helped to con
| vince t he country of Labor's sense
! of responsibility in government.
Yet the Laborites already have
! redeemed some election pledges.
Diplomatic relations with liussia
' have been restored, widows' pen
sions and unemployment insurance
i extended, British troops withdrawn
from the Rhlneland, the optional
clause of the Hague Court signed,
j and many commissions set up to
> study various problems.
At the Five Power Conference
I new achievements in international
statesmanship will strengthen La
! bor domestically and serve to bal
j ance diculties in internal policy.
