# SORORITY BIDDING WILL TAKE PLACE AT 6:45 TONIGHT
## 
### 
The final period of women's
rushing ended last night with
dinner. Panhellenio cut the
second period this year from
six to five days in length, and
during this time new women
were entertained by sororities
at lunch and dinner.
Like the two days between
the first and second periods,
today is a day of silence in
which no communication may
pass between sororities and
ne-w women. The time of bid
ding has been announced, con
trary to the custom of previ
ous years, and will take place
at 6:45 p.m. in Roble Hall.
