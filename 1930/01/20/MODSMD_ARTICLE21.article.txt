# SLEEP, NOT COLD, WORST FOE OF MAN IN ARCTIC: SAYS MACMILLAN
## 
### William Grace 
i"It is sleep—not coldness or po
• lfi' bears—that kills men in the
Arctic," Captain Donald B. Mac
i Millan, wlio lectured in San Fran-
I cisco last week, told the Daily.
"The nights are six months long,
i and if a white man is allowed to,
i lie will sleep himself into a flac
| (id state of body which will not
stand the northern vigors. 1 have
i to set a ten-hour maximum on my
men."
MacMillan looks as though he
would be the last on any party to
be caught sleeping. He is a fine
j looking man, deep-chested and
! keen of eye, but more like a scien
| tist than explorer. After graduat
: ing from Bowdoin College Mac.Mil
( lan took a degree in anthropology
i at Harvard, were he is now a pro
! fespor.
Trip to Arctic
"Why did I ever go to the Arc
tic? Well, my father had gone
into Greenland with a crew of men,
and never came back. I just want
, ed to see. I have been back up
j with the icebergs for 21 years now
i —yes, going back next June. The
government of Denmark wants my
little ship, the "Bowdoin," which is
just the size of the old Norsemen's
boats, to help celebrate the thou
sandth anniversary of Iceland, first
parliamentary government in the

! world."
Greenland also is under Den
mark. That is tlie one large place
in the world where you cannot go
foi love or money, the captain de
( hired. Even with the government
and interests of this country be
hind him, MacMillan worked for
months to get papers allowing him
to anchor there lor a few days. His
men had to he hack on hoard ship
by sundown every night, and if
they gave any article of clothing to
any inhabitant, they were to be
« sent home in irons.
White Man's Diseases
When Denmark took charge of
Greenland, she decided to keep the
Eskimos free from white man's dis
eases. Every country in the world
hi>s volunteered treaties prevent
ing its people from going there.
So don't let any cosmopolite tell
you how he used to hunt Ovibos
moschatus in Greenland.
1 Hundreds of would-be arctic
companions apply to MacMillan ev
i ery year. "Athletes are what. I
Vi-iit on my trips; husky young fel
lows who can handle a dog team
— but not sleep too much. I pick
football men who also know a use
| fu! science."
This was the fourth lecture of
this 1 winter at the Scottish Kite
hall in San Francisco. The next
will be by William B. Seabrook on
i February ID.
