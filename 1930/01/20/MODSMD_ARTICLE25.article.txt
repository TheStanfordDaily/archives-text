# COURAGEOUS ACTION NEEDED IMMEDIATELY
## 
### 
The A.S.S.I' "Concert Series manager, Carl Mather, was ag- |
grieved at the editorial appearing in Friday's Daily which stated j
that the complete disregard of common-sense courtesy exhibited by
the boorish late-comers t,o the Ximbalist concert was "an insult to
the music lovers who came to listen." The editorial also declared that
"the system used Wednesday night evidenced poor taste, poor man
agement, and an utter lack of judgment."
The Daily reiterates those statements.
There is a practical solution to the problem which is at least !
worth a try on the part of the management, if it cares to take a cou- i
rageous stand to blot out this disgrace. The guest artist could be I
informed of the situation and make his first group of selections very j
short. W hen he leaves the stage after his first group of pieces, then, j
and not until then, admit the late-comers. When they have become j
seated, the program could continue without the embarrassment of j
either the artist or the audience.
Similarly, the Committee of Public Exercises could very easily
handle the disgraceful action that occurs at practically every Tuesday !
evening lecture. If campus cops were stationed at the doors of the'
Assembly Hall to keep people out who showed up after the lecture
has commenced, there would be no need for the recurrence of the j
situation which took place last Tuesday night when people clanked ■
down the aisles to the chagrin of both I lamlin CJarland and the audi
ence.
Courageous action on the part of the C oncert Series management'
and the Committee on Public Exercises would correct this evil which I
is casting disrepute on the name of the I niversity.
