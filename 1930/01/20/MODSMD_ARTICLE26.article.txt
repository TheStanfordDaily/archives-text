# AN AGE-OLD QUESTION REVIVED
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning representatives from five world maritime'
powers gather about the conference tables of St. James Palace to!
once again cogitate on possibilities for limitation of naval anna-1
ments.
That age-old question which has plunged war-stricken nations
into extravagant ship-building orgies, which has sped the big three
of the world into a devastating race for superiority, will he consid
ered at the London Conference.
Even before the grave diplomats assemble around the conference
tables, murmurs of dissatisfaction have arisen from the representa
tives' ranks. These rumors may convert the London parley into a
Washington Arms Conference. They may send the missioners home |
with nothing accomplished.
Fear of Anglo-American dominance at the conclave has been j
expressed in the Japanese press. Premier Mac Donald's visit to the j
I "nited States did not aid in quelling Japanese, French, and Italian
fears of an Anglo-American alliance.
]ust what are the factors expected to disrupt the C onference J .
Tinted States wants mote cruisers than (ireat Britain, yet Eng
land insists on a greater number of total ships because of the tre
mendous coast lines of her possessions which she must protect.
Britain will probably object to Japan's request for a larger ratio
of cruiser strength and insistence that the ratio be translated into
ships on the basis of the number and size of cruisers allotted to the j
I nited States.
1 "ranee wants for her defense more cruisers and submarines.!
Italy will insist on parity with France. \nd to meet French-Italian j
demands, Britain must abandon her policy of Mediterranean naval;
trengt-h greater than both Italian and French fleets.
Mountainous obstacles await the London conferees. Doubt that j
any substantial reduction will be realized has been expressed by j
Harold E. Sprout, Stanford political scientist, in an interview given
to the I)aily.
Success or failure, the London Conference will be another step
toward the future realization of international amity when harmony,
goodwill, friendship, and peace will encompass the world.
