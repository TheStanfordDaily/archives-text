EVERY SOUL IS A CIRCUS, by
Vachel Lindsay. The Macmillan
Co., $2.50
'"A book for precocious children,
twelve or fifty years of age," so
Vachel Lindsay characterizes his
nc w volume of verse, "Every Soul
Is a Circus." This is a rather ir
regular collection, both in execu
tion and in material. Some of the
poems are most emphatically lor
children of twelve, and not preco
cious children either. Others re
quire a mature reading. Some are
lovely, some are merely clever, and
others are decidedly dull.
There is less of Lindsay's favor
it*! pastime of whipping himself
into a patriotic political fervor, and
more sincere lyricism than usual.
The title poem is perhaps the most
interesting, hut scarcely the most
beautiful, poem of the book. The
children's verses and poem-games
are unproved experiments, more in
teresting to the Btudent of child
psychology and education Hum to
the poet.
"The Virginians Are Coming
Again" is a dramatic effort to blast
the Babbitts and hail the return of
the old cavalier tradition of the
great. South. As one reads Lind
say's lovely exposition, one almost
believes that the younger genera
tions are different and that they
are the hope of the country. His
optimism is so sincere, and his po
etry so surging, that, even the skep
tic is moved. But afterward lie
sees this poet as an idealistic trou
badour crying against the inevi
table.
The lyric touch which enters the
book in several places is illustrated
by "When the Sun Rose from the
Mariposa Lily":
When the sun rose from the tnari
posa lily in the sky,
It was first a feather, . . . then . . .

It was next a Lard!: wing, . . .
then . . .
ll was bird, and egg;, and shell and
neut, . . . then.
For the livelong day,
The fire dove, the cloud-dove, of
the • ky, east and west.
And so again the days had come to
pass,
When the sun rose from the lily,
And the moon rose horn the moon
llower,
And (lie stars rose,
The stars rone
From the grass.

ingredients necessary to, a full f've

chorus element whatsoever.
The story is one of estranged

love with the sou of the woman
who caused the estrangement of
the parents. Try and figure thai
j one out! At any rate, the story
moves swiftly and brightly, and
the cast is excellent. Robert Mont
gomery is "one of the film's newer
juveniles who is actually likeable.
' Miss Shearer never showed off to
better advantage, both dramatically
(and optically. Her brother, Doug

work in t lie recording of tin; pic

{ for some pleasureable enjoyment.
