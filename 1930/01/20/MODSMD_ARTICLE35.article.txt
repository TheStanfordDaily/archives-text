## REDSHIRTS WIN FIRST TILT EASILY, ROUTED IN SECOND 
### BY STEPHEN DIETRICH 
IJFtEAKjr'G even in a Conference double-header during the pa: t week
end on its second Southern invasion in an many weeks, Coach Husky
Hum's "in-and-out" basketball live climbed out of the cellar position
into a tie wiili I'.C. in P.C.C. standings. After trimming the Trojans
by a wide margin in the first encounter, Stanford displnyed a complete
reversal of form the next evening and went down to defeat by eighteen
points.
Scbduled to warm the bench because of a bad cold, Vance Fawcett
led tlie Cards to a to 23 victory on Friday night with a bit of
: pectaciilar basket shooting. Having his first hot night at locating (lie
hoop hiding the present season, the veteran Stanford forward dribbled,

passed, and shot his way through
the reputedly strong Trojan de
fense to pile up a fourteen point
total.
Long .John McCandless came
through with his usual good game
at center, and followed Fawcett in
: coring with eleven tallies. The
other feature of the opening lilt
"was the work of Captain Harlow
Rothert at guard. Playing u steady
floor game, the Card leader helped
t ) keep down the Trojan end of the
score hy recovering tin hall off Ihe
backboard lime after time.
Cards Falter
! uceessfully hounding' Fawcett
in the second game, the Trojans
had' no trouble at all in neatly
trouncing the faltering Farm lads.
While the Cards played more or
less ragged ball on both offense
and defense, Fawcett was held to a
ingle field goal and a foul tip,
both made during the first, half.
Mill Pierce, lanky Troy forward,
took the "cripple's" place at swish
ing the ball through the basket
with regularity, being high-point
nan with twelve markers.
According to reports from the
South, Stanford failed to show
much in the way of basketball
(lass in either fracas, indicating
that Coach Harry's men dropped
1 lie opening game largely by their
own misplays. The Cards never
threatened the Trojan lead on Sat
urday night, and trailed all the
vaj from the opening tip-off. At
half time, U.S.C. had piled up six
tern points to Stanford's nine. Dur
ing tiie second period, Pierce caged
:;ix baskets in rapid succession, to
put his team far out in front.
While the Cards were having
their troubles wiili IJ.S.C., the
Golden Bear showed unexpected
strength at Oakland in bowing to
the I't'L.A. Bruin quintet. Fresh
from their record-breaking score
against Stanford, the Bruins were
heavy favorites to swamp Nibs
Price's players. Yet, when the final
viiitle sounded, the Southern
â–  (.mad was lucky to leave the court
<11 the long end of a 2<> to 23 score.
