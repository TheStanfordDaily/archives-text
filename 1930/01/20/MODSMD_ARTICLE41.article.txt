# NEW MANAGERS IN BIG LEAGUES
## 
### Feg Murray, '14 
> In football the coach Is the big
guy, and gives orders to the man
ager. In baseball it's the other way
j around, Hie manager is boss, the
i coach is second or third fiddle. Can
â–  you imagine Knute Rockne becom
' ing manager of the Notre Dame
football team? It is to laugh (al
j though I have heard rumors to the
' effect that Bill Jones is going back
I to West Point in a year or so to
1 become permanent graduate man
\ ager of athletics!). Well, Bill Kil
: hfer, Gabby Street, Heinie Wag
! ner. and Bob Shawkey have all
I hoc n promoted from coaches to
! managers, arid Jewel Ens served
| j,, |i| !( t capacity before he was
! made Pirate manager last Septem

ber. Tn many cases fliey acted as
first-lieutenant to the men they
have succeeded.
Exactly half of the sixteen major
league clubs have signed new man
agers for the season of 1930. Three
of them, however, held managerial
jobs last season with other tennis.
That's why I haven't included them
in the above drawing.
Ens was made manager of the
Pirates when Donie Bit li resigned
in September and then given a new
contract for 1920, so he can he
included in the new managers. The
other three are Uonie Bush, now
with the White Sox, Uan Howley,
now with the Reds, and Bill Me
Kechnie, now with the Braves.

Boston and St. Louis, then, get
two new pilots. Both Boston teams
I finished last season in the cellar,
so Messrs. McKechnie and Wag
ner, former major league inlielders,
are in for tough jobs. Bill used to
play next to Hans Wagner, famous
old shortstop of the Pirates. Heinie
was as good a fielding shortstop as
Hie more afmous Hans, but not so
good a batter. He played for the
Hed Sox from 190G to 1910.
St. Louis gains Bill Killefer, who
succeeds Dan Howley as pilot of
the Browns, and Gabby Street, who
steps into Bill McKeclmie's shoes
as boss of the Cardinals. Both St.
Louis teams finished in fourth
place last season. Killefer was a

former Cub manager; Street has
had minor league experience. Both
were former major league catchers
who made reputations receiving
i the offerings of two of the greatest
hurlers of all time. Killefer caught
Alexander for 4 the Phillies, and j
Street caught Walter Johnson fori
the Senators. Hot 11 former catchers 1
have now become managers in the 1
! league opposite to the one in;
which they used to play.
Just a word more, on Bob Shaw
key. He has had no managerial ex
perience, but served under the late
I Miller Huggins as coach of the j
pitchers. He always gave his best, i
and should make it popular, and I
hope, successful manager.
