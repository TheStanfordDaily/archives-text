# CIGAR-GAZING DOOMED Season Closed In Union "WHITE FLAG" HOISTED
## 
### 
Does tlie big white cloth which
Jiangs in the Union Store these
days signify anything? Just ask
tlio man behind tlie counter, and it
will no longer be a mystery.
Due to the hordes who lean over
the counter and deposit the entire
season's rainfall on the glass, some
one has donated a large white rag,
which' will, witli considerable ef
fort on the part of he who wields
it, restore some of the polish. And
so the Union utters the plea, "If
you must gaze at cigars, please do
it from a distance."
