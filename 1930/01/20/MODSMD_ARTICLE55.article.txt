# McCLINTOCK SAYS PLANS UNSETTLED FOR ENGLISH TOUR
## 
### 
"Why, I have no definite plans,"
was Robert McClintock's answer
to questions about his debating
tour in England. He, with Gregson
Bowtzer of Southern California and
an unpicked man from California,
is to meet English university de
baters in a three-weeks' tour be
j ginning April 20.
"Three weeks is a pretty short
time, and I don't think I'll return
to Stanford until the summer quar
ter. There are many things I
should like to do in Europe, but I
have had no time to plan anything
definitely.
"I have been in England before,
but I should like to see the country
leisurely. I may stay there awhile
after the tour. I have some friends
. in Constantinople whom I should
j like to visit. And I want to go to
Athens.
"But," he concluded, with a
j smile, "I really don't know where
I I am going!"
i This will be McClintock's fourth
I trip to Europe. Last year he and
his brother, John, went with repre
sentatives from many American
and foreign universities to watch
the League of Nations in action.
Seemingly everywhere lie has
friends he wants to visit: the Ox-1
ford debaters who were recently !
here, friends he met during the
League's sessions at Geneva, and
friends he has made on his two
earlier trips.
