# JACK M'DOWELL, RUTH BEEDE TO PLAY OPPOSITE IN GOLDINI'S ITALIAN COMEDY
## 
### 
| Jack McDowell, familiar to cam
-1 us audiences, will play opposite
j Ruth Beede a second time this
| year when he does the part of
Fabricius in ('alio Goldini's classic
I comedy, "The Mistress of the Inn,"
! to lie given hero on February 7,
! under the direction of Harold Hel
i venston, acting director of dra-
I niatics.
Miss Beede and McDowell ap- |
; peart d together in the juvenile i
I leads of S. N. Behrman's sparkling j
; comedy of four < haracters, "The |
I Second Man," this summer, when 1
i Gordon Davis made in that play his i
J annual appearance. As Austin i
â–  Lowe, a brilliant birt, unsocial;
I young chemist, McDowell played
i opposite Miss Beede, the delight
fully adolescent ingenue. The pair
was recognized as one of the best
dramatic teams that has been seen j
on the Stanford stage.
Jack McDowell nitide his first
' appearance last year when he did
[the part of John Shand in Barrie's ]
charming comedy, "What Every |
Woman Knows," playing opposite j
Katherine Keho.
In the part of Fabricius in the
present play, he will be doing a
part utterly different from either j
i of the two he took last year. It, is j
1 a comic part, and a rather obvious

I one, with many possibilities along
the lines of horseplay and panto
mime. Fabricius is the Italian ser
vant at the inn of which Mirando

lina (to he played by Ruth Beede)
is mistress; and, like the rest of
the men in the cast, he ultimately
turns out to bo in love with the
wily, fascinating charmer, Miran
dolina.
