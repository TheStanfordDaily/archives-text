### 
BERKELEY, Jan. 1!>. -Although
rain lias prevented any hard prac
tice by the California baseball
squad, Clint Evans, new Bear men
tor, is more than pleased with his
prospects and pre-season dope
seems to point to another confer
ence-winning title for the Blue and
Gold.
Nine lettermen are back in har
ness for Hie .Bears, "Brick"' Wil
liamson has returned to take up
his position behind the bat, Jim
Sharpe will take over the first bag
vacated by Captain Stevenson, sec
ond base is filled by Swenson, and
Hurry Butler is holding down his
old job in the hot corner. Captain
elect "Cili" Valianos has come
back fo the winily alley and can
play the short patch as well as the
best of them.
The pastures will again be filled
by lettermen. Burgett, who led the
conference with the willow last
year, is in the left cornfield, Power
is retaining the right pen, and
Rickson is fighting with Kerwin
for the center position. Only the
pitching staff' se<ins weak. Norm
Horner, leading twirler of the
league last, year, is back, but, out
side of him, the staff is sadly de
pleted.
