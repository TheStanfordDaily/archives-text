# 'DEJECTED' PARROTS ONLY ONES DANGEROUS, SAYS DR. SCHULTZ

### Ruth Miner 
Parrots presenting limply droop
ing wings, disordered plumage, and
a dejected appearance are the only
ones which need to give local bird
owners any concern over I lie par
rot disease, psittacosis, said Pro
fessor Edwin L. Scliultz. of the
Bfict< riology and Experimental Pa
thology Department, in an infer
] view with the Daily.
With the quarantine of recently
imported birds, as well as those in
pet stores, the disease is now be
lieved to be under control in Los
AngcleH, after causing the death of
onn and the illness of three others.
A number of cases have been re
-1 ported in cities of the East.
Poison or Disease
Contraction of the bacterium
psittacosis by man mav lead either
i . .
1 to an intoxication by the poisons
or to the actual disease, which is
said to resemble typhoid fever com
plicated with pneumonia. The
I Mortality of the latter is believed
I to be about to 40 per cent. The
I 1
bacterium is one of a large group.
I Salmonella, different species of
' which are responsible for enteric
; infections in a variety of lower

, animals. Professor Scliultz staled.
"Food, especially meat, which
i has become contaminated with any
i of these bacterial species may, if
1 (lie organisms have flourished
there sufficiently, cause severe gas
trointestinal and other disturb
j ances when ingested by man, even
; though the food has been cooked,
j This is the food poisoning which
: is commonly referred to as 'pto
maine poisoning' and is the result
ol ingestion of the heat stable poi
sons resident within the bodies of
i the bacteria."
Incubation Period
In regard to the disease in man,
he said. "The incubation period
seems to range from 7 to 25 days,
j The temperature rises rapidly,
reading 102 to 104. The patient
I may become dull and show more
or less marked delirium." There
are also signs of lung and gastro
intestinal development.
So long as the bird exhibits
health and normal appearance,
there is no danger, he believes.
Within a short time ol contraction
of the disease the animal will have
some respiratory disturbance, will
ibccome emaciated, and will show
other symptoms.
