# UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE FOREIGN GUNBOATS
## 
### 
'China's recent degree abolishing extraterritoriality has brought'
cries of protest from indignant capitals at London, I okio, and
Washington.
Long suppressed by the right of foreign residents to be tried in
their own consular courts, China is now struggling to rear its head
above the burden superimposed upon a decadent nation under the
ominous shadow of foreign gunboats.
Since 1842. I'nited States, llritain, and Japan have gobbled with
relish great slices of trade privileges generously portioned out by
the weak, irresponsible administrators of the world s oldest living
civilization.
Naturally the Rig Three hate to view such an advantage fade ,
into thin air. Gunboat threats have by no means been placed in j
discard. Military power remains a "big stick in the Far East.
From its smug, self-satisfied position of centuries ago China has I
retrogressed into a nation dominated by warring militarists. At the
present time at least 12,000.000 people are slowly perishing of star-!
vation. Death is rampant in several provinces. Crazed by lack of |
food, some Chinese have turned cannibal.
Indelible stamps have been placed on the pages of the Celestial
Empire's history by the great powers participation in the ()piitm
War and the Coolie Trade. At various times Chinese peasantry has
slaughtered a few foreigners.
I>ut those outrages were infinitesimal when compared to the
greedy contact of Americans, Japanese, and Englishmen with C hina.
China's extraterritoriality decree doubtlessly will not be respect
ed. Yet someday the Chinese may turn their heads away from the
past; they may peek into the golden prospects the future holds for i
latent, man-powered nations. j
Sometime the Chinese dragon may grow restless and belch forth |
flames of defiance.
