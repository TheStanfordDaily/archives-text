CRITIQUE OF LOVE. By Fritz
Wittel. The Macaulay Com
pany, 1929. At the Stanford
Bookstore.
"Flower o* the clove," Browning
wrote In Fra Lippi Lippi, "All the
Latin I construe is 'Amo,' I love!"
Such a spicy remark might be
made of modern letters or of all
art if one is to believe the Freu
dians. Science, Wittel believes, is
just discovering what most artists
! and writers have always uncon
sciously understood.
"The Critique ot Love" is con
cerned chiefly with the application
of psychoanalysis to the subject of
! love, Wittel's avowed purpose be
ing to prove to the American pub
lic that the new truth, Preudism,
is not as loathsome as many peo
ple imagiue, or in other words to
deal with sex from a scientific
| point of view.
Whether one believes in the
Freudian concept of human psych
ology or not, it is not an insignifi
cant fact that life and conversa
tion owe more to libido' than they
do to anything else. The most
witty drama, the comedy of man
ners, and the most profound trag
edy have employed libidinous plots.
Witness Lady Teazle and Oedipus.
The book is especially valuable
as an explanation of the most baf
lling part of Freud's theory, the
i emphasis upon sex. The psycholo-
I gical aspect of Freud's discoveries:
1 his interpretation of dreams, his
theory of the unconscious conflict,
his ideas of repression, and the
structure of t.lie ego, are more or
! less accepted by official science
1 today.
Deserted by deity, man looked
; about the world and, finding noth
' iug so admirable as himself, started
writing biographies. Psychoanalysis
has followed naturally enough.
Science has probed matter: now
the investigation of mind has lie
gun. Will the egoistic nature of
man be satisfied by this last mine
for flattery? The truth may make
us free but will it make us happy?
Wittel thinks it may.
I THE POET AND THE LUNATICS.
By G. K. Chesterton. New
York: Dodd, Mead & Company.
; 1929.
Gabriel Gale, the poet, is very
different from the traditional type
! of detective used by Poe and Conan
Doyle. He solves a series of crimes
1 and mysteries perpetuated by luna
! tics because of his ability to under
: stand the workings of the abnor
-1 rnal mind, and this ability is the
result of a mind so unusual that
, Gale's sanity is often questioned.
The stories, however, fall into
the ordinary pattern as the vari
ous foils to the hero build up elab
-1 orate theories which are, in the
closing paragraphs, completely de
stroyed by the poet. Continually,

I the conflict is between the practl
| cal and the artistic mind. Also in
accordance with tradition is the
I independence of the individual
stories, though Gale reappears to
solve each problem.
A number of interesting ideas
are presented among the ideas of
thM lunatics, as, tor example, the
[ absolute horror of the man who
thought himself to be omnipotent
and took upon himself the responsi
bility for all the ills of the uni
verse.
The stories are well written and
interesting; they should, I believe,
take their position well toward the
top of detective fiction. Their ulti
mate ranking in literature depends,
; of course, entirely upon the level
0? prose to which one ranks the
i tale of crime and its exposure.
1 do not think that this rank
I should be high and, in reality, the
i stories of Chesterton do not pre
tend to be more than light read
• ing. As such they are very satis
factory. —E. E. W.
THE LAUGHING LADY—At the
Varsity Bheatre.
This show is going to play to a
capacity house at every perform
ance. To miss it, would be a real
misfortune; it will more than make
up for those last half a dozen
shows at which you were not sure
- whether you were more bored than
; amused. There is not any doubt
about "The Laughing Lady"—from
the first scene to the last it. is mar
velous entertainment.
A beautiful young society matron
| laughs at the wrong moment —
i twice, and she loses her reputa
-1 tion, her husband —and what really
1 hurts —her child.
But. this lovely lady has brains
1 equal to her beauty, and she makes
no more mistakes, when she de
cides to recover her child and
salve her wounded pride at the
: same time by revenging herself
len the cold, aristocratic lawyer
who was responsible for her trag
i tdy. She succeeds —but. in a far
different manner from which she
| intended. The charming, carress
ing voice, and exquisite heart-
I shaped face of Ruth Chatterton as
the lead could not be resisted even
; bv the unimpeachable aloofness of
such a lawyer as Clive Brooks.
Ruth Chatterton is a supreme
I actress in this picture. She is in
-1 credibly adorable and fascinating
1 in the light moments —and in the
dramatic moments, her characteri
; zation is one of singular power and
dignity.
But if Ruth Chatterton were not.
in the picture, the excellence of
Clive Brook's acting would make
the show worth while; and with
out Clive Brook, the picture would
still have an array of splendid
1 minor characters that would make
i you love it. It is really that good,

CRITIQUE OF LOVE. By Fritz
Wittel. The Macaulay Com
pany, 1929. At the Stanford
Bookstore.
"Flower o* the clove," Browning
wrote In Fra Lippi Lippi, "All the
Latin I construe is 'Amo,' I love!"
Such a spicy remark might be
made of modern letters or of all
art if one is to believe the Freu
dians. Science, Wittel believes, is
just discovering what most artists
! and writers have always uncon
sciously understood.
"The Critique ot Love" is con
cerned chiefly with the application
of psychoanalysis to the subject of
! love, Wittel's avowed purpose be
ing to prove to the American pub
lic that the new truth, Preudism,
is not as loathsome as many peo
ple imagiue, or in other words to
deal with sex from a scientific
| point of view.
Whether one believes in the
Freudian concept of human psych
ology or not, it is not an insignifi
cant fact that life and conversa
tion owe more to libido' than they
do to anything else. The most
witty drama, the comedy of man
ners, and the most profound trag
edy have employed libidinous plots.
Witness Lady Teazle and Oedipus.
The book is especially valuable
as an explanation of the most baf
lling part of Freud's theory, the
i emphasis upon sex. The psycholo-
I gical aspect of Freud's discoveries:
1 his interpretation of dreams, his
theory of the unconscious conflict,
his ideas of repression, and the
structure of t.lie ego, are more or
! less accepted by official science
1 today.
Deserted by deity, man looked
; about the world and, finding noth
' iug so admirable as himself, started
writing biographies. Psychoanalysis
has followed naturally enough.
Science has probed matter: now
the investigation of mind has lie
gun. Will the egoistic nature of
man be satisfied by this last mine
for flattery? The truth may make
us free but will it make us happy?
Wittel thinks it may.
I THE POET AND THE LUNATICS.
By G. K. Chesterton. New
York: Dodd, Mead & Company.
; 1929.
Gabriel Gale, the poet, is very
different from the traditional type
! of detective used by Poe and Conan
Doyle. He solves a series of crimes
1 and mysteries perpetuated by luna
! tics because of his ability to under
: stand the workings of the abnor
-1 rnal mind, and this ability is the
result of a mind so unusual that
, Gale's sanity is often questioned.
The stories, however, fall into
the ordinary pattern as the vari
ous foils to the hero build up elab
-1 orate theories which are, in the
closing paragraphs, completely de
stroyed by the poet. Continually,

I the conflict is between the practl
| cal and the artistic mind. Also in
accordance with tradition is the
I independence of the individual
stories, though Gale reappears to
solve each problem.
A number of interesting ideas
are presented among the ideas of
thM lunatics, as, tor example, the
[ absolute horror of the man who
thought himself to be omnipotent
and took upon himself the responsi
bility for all the ills of the uni
verse.
The stories are well written and
interesting; they should, I believe,
take their position well toward the
top of detective fiction. Their ulti
mate ranking in literature depends,
; of course, entirely upon the level
0? prose to which one ranks the
i tale of crime and its exposure.

I THE POET AND THE LUNATICS.
By G. K. Chesterton. New
York: Dodd, Mead & Company.
; 1929.
Gabriel Gale, the poet, is very
different from the traditional type
! of detective used by Poe and Conan
Doyle. He solves a series of crimes
1 and mysteries perpetuated by luna
! tics because of his ability to under
: stand the workings of the abnor
-1 rnal mind, and this ability is the
result of a mind so unusual that
, Gale's sanity is often questioned.
The stories, however, fall into
the ordinary pattern as the vari
ous foils to the hero build up elab
-1 orate theories which are, in the
closing paragraphs, completely de
stroyed by the poet. Continually,

I the conflict is between the practl
| cal and the artistic mind. Also in
accordance with tradition is the
I independence of the individual
stories, though Gale reappears to
solve each problem.
A number of interesting ideas
are presented among the ideas of
thM lunatics, as, tor example, the
[ absolute horror of the man who
thought himself to be omnipotent
and took upon himself the responsi
bility for all the ills of the uni
verse.
The stories are well written and
interesting; they should, I believe,
take their position well toward the
top of detective fiction. Their ulti
mate ranking in literature depends,
; of course, entirely upon the level
0? prose to which one ranks the
i tale of crime and its exposure.
1 do not think that this rank
I should be high and, in reality, the
i stories of Chesterton do not pre
tend to be more than light read
• ing. As such they are very satis
factory. —E. E. W.
THE LAUGHING LADY—At the
Varsity Bheatre.
This show is going to play to a
capacity house at every perform
ance. To miss it, would be a real
misfortune; it will more than make
up for those last half a dozen
shows at which you were not sure
- whether you were more bored than
; amused. There is not any doubt
about "The Laughing Lady"—from
the first scene to the last it. is mar
velous entertainment.
A beautiful young society matron
| laughs at the wrong moment —
i twice, and she loses her reputa
-1 tion, her husband —and what really
1 hurts —her child.
But. this lovely lady has brains
1 equal to her beauty, and she makes
no more mistakes, when she de
cides to recover her child and
salve her wounded pride at the
: same time by revenging herself
len the cold, aristocratic lawyer
who was responsible for her trag
i tdy. She succeeds —but. in a far
different manner from which she
| intended. The charming, carress
ing voice, and exquisite heart-
I shaped face of Ruth Chatterton as
the lead could not be resisted even
; bv the unimpeachable aloofness of
such a lawyer as Clive Brooks.
Ruth Chatterton is a supreme
I actress in this picture. She is in
-1 credibly adorable and fascinating
1 in the light moments —and in the
dramatic moments, her characteri
; zation is one of singular power and
dignity.
But if Ruth Chatterton were not.
in the picture, the excellence of
Clive Brook's acting would make
the show worth while; and with
out Clive Brook, the picture would
still have an array of splendid
1 minor characters that would make
i you love it. It is really that good,

CRITIQUE OF LOVE. By Fritz
Wittel. The Macaulay Com
pany, 1929. At the Stanford
Bookstore.
"Flower o* the clove," Browning
wrote In Fra Lippi Lippi, "All the
Latin I construe is 'Amo,' I love!"
Such a spicy remark might be
made of modern letters or of all
art if one is to believe the Freu
dians. Science, Wittel believes, is
just discovering what most artists
! and writers have always uncon
sciously understood.
"The Critique ot Love" is con
cerned chiefly with the application
of psychoanalysis to the subject of
! love, Wittel's avowed purpose be
ing to prove to the American pub
lic that the new truth, Preudism,
is not as loathsome as many peo
ple imagiue, or in other words to
deal with sex from a scientific
| point of view.
Whether one believes in the
Freudian concept of human psych
ology or not, it is not an insignifi
cant fact that life and conversa
tion owe more to libido' than they
do to anything else. The most
witty drama, the comedy of man
ners, and the most profound trag
edy have employed libidinous plots.
Witness Lady Teazle and Oedipus.
The book is especially valuable
as an explanation of the most baf
lling part of Freud's theory, the
i emphasis upon sex. The psycholo-
I gical aspect of Freud's discoveries:
1 his interpretation of dreams, his
