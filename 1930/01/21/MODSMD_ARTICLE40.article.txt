# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD..
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF JANUARY 21, 1905 
### 
J The attractions at the San Fran
; cisco Theatres were listed and the
titles read as follows: "The Silver
: Slipper," "The Girl and the Judge,"
1"A Working-Girl's Wrongs," "A
| Country Mouse," and "Captain
January."
Sunday marked the second an
niversary of the dedication of the
Memorial Church which was erect
-1 ed by Mrs. Stanford in memory of
her husband. Within those two
years, the church had developed
and become a distinct part of the
bniversity. Thus the University
had grown spiritually as well as
materially.

I Tickets for the sophomore com
edy, "The Rivals," were put on
1 &ale on the Quad at 1Â»: 30. The num
! ber of complimentary seats had
been materially decreased by the
committee in charge. This action
was taken in behalf of the inter
ests of the sophomore class be
cause the comedy was being pro
-1 duced for the financial returns as
' well as for the sake of the dra
matic welfare of the class. (Who
would have thougfit this alibi
twenty years old?)
Subscription to the Daily Palo
Alto, twenty-five years ago, was
three dollars a year and single
copies sold at five cents apiece.
