## 
### 
With the first scheduled game of
; the 1930 season but five days off,
1 Coach Harry Wolter's varsity base-
I 1 tall squad held the first practice of
112 the year yesterday. Due to the soft
condition of the diamond, no organ
\ ized batting and fielding practice was
possible, and the squad limbered up
j tossing the ball about the .field. Pitch
ers and catchers have been the only
players to carry on any degree of
work since the start of the winter
quarter, and rain lias prevented even
I them from doing more than light
| workouts.
The Card hall tosscrs open the
schedule with a game with the Olvm
' pic Club to he played here Saturday.
I Practice games with semi-pro teams
