## A 						NO-MAN'S LAND? 
### 
Although temporarily transformed
into a duck pond, the new campus
goU" course lias been saved for pos
terity by the recent daily rain storms.
And when the sun starts shining once
more in regular Sunny California
fashion, the course will be in shape
to play.
For during the few hours
between showers that the
links have been opened, it has
been proven conclusively that
the all too numerous would
be student golfers are sadly
lacking in the etiquette and
manners of the ancient Scotch
pastime, and are much more
fitted for wielding muck
sticks than golf clubs.
According to Garry Bennett, head
of the golfing industry on the Farm
under the title of varsity and frosh
coach, these would-be players, if al
lowed to continue their most unman
nerly and destructive ways, would
soon convert the course into a well
ploughed held, as safe to play on as
No-Man's-Land during the late war.
The putting greens, says
Mr. Bennett, have been bru
tally mistreated from the
opening day.' They are be
ginning to look as wrinkled
as washboards, and as hard
to master.
It seems that the local golfers arc
not even satisfied with banging their
putters down on the greens, when
they hole out of miss an easy shot,
but have acquired the habit of leaning
on the flagsticks as well. Benches are
provided for resting purposes, Air.
Bennett wants if to he known; the
flag poles being merely guides for the
players to tee off in the right general
direction., barring slices and hooks.
The fairways, too, have ab
sorbed their share of the
physical punishment. In fact,
it is on this part of the links
that the student golfers like
best to try out their ditch
digging abilities. Which, by
the way, they do to perfec
tion. Very few professional
muck stick wielders can slice
out plots of sod as neatly as
can these unsubsidized club
swingers.
Now missing the ball completely (
at times is all right. We are all
dubs in the beginning and fan the
air most clumsily. Even record
breaking pros occasionally send a tuft
of turf instead 0/ the little white
pellet soaring toward ihe hole.
But when it comes to an
unmannerly college student
•ripping into the fairways with
the robotish pugnacity of a
steam dredger, all the while
his ball sinking deeper and
deeper underground, the of
fense becomes more serious.
And when the dub finally and
unexpectedly socks the little
white object and marches of
nonchalantly down the links
to new digging grounds, with
out even an attempt at re
placing the sod, the matter
demands action.
This latter form of destruction is
one of the most persistent violations
with which the local course heads
have to deal. The students forget all
about scientific methods out on the
links, and fail to replace divots time
after time.
Even the lowly sand traps
come in for a beating. The
would-be's spend most of
their time tramping around in
these pits, but they haven't
manners enough to smooth
out their tracks on departing
for the next trap. It appears
to be a case of eye-for-eye;
the traps decoy the ball and
the dubs retaliate by con
temptuously messing up the
sand.
So much for actual destruction.
There are numerous other ways in i
which the campus players either show j
indifference to the various rules or I
an utter lack of golfing etiquette.
For example, the course rules read
that the foursome is the largest group ]
to play together at one time. Yet, j
says Mr. Bennett, the players shoot j
around the links in regular herds. I
A foursome, of course, must
give way to a following two
some. But such is not the
case on the local course—at
least, the two would endan
ger their lives trying to get
through. And trying to get
ahead of one of the herds is
like Cagle attempting an end
run against the Stanford grid
ders.
At times, golf balls whiz through
the air in all directions. One has to

keep dodging from being hit, some
times in the middle of a stroke. Con
sequently one has a hard time shoot
ing par, even if he could. Which is
all unnecessary, caused by a dub,
shooting too soon or failing to yell a
simple, one-syllabled word, "bore."
Such are the conditions to
date. But not for long, says
Mr. Bennett. Failure in fol
lowing out course rules from
now on will lead to action.
Violations are likely to be
handled by the Men's Coun
cil Not that a slip-up in eti
quette will cause hours to be
added to one's graduation, but
it may mean the loss of play
ing privileges. The Daily fa
vors such action — which is
the only way of preventing
the Stanford golf course
from becoming a ploughed-up
No-Man's-Land.
