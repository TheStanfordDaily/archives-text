Two Stanford fraternities paid
the penalty last night for viola- .
tions of interfraternity rushing |
rules.
, These two were probably no \
1 more deserving of such action
than are several other Greek lft
\ ter organizations. But these two
I were unfortunate enough to be
j apprehended. And only by swift,
ruthless action like this will the j
Stanford rushing situation be
cleaned up.
Last year's rushing fiasco
proved that the maintenance of ,
: the established order is vitally |
| necessary to the welfare of Stan- j
ford houses. A repetition of that !
situation may mean the end of \
fraternities here.
Every thinking fraternity man
• on the campus is aware of that
fact, and is aroused by the fla- '
grant disregard of regulation that j
has marked Frosh-Row relations
thus far this season.
The Interfraternity Board of
Control is to be commended for
' the firm stand it has taken in this J
! matter. The Daily is squarely be- |
hind Kim Dyer and his colleagues t
j in their efforts to stamp out prac
tices that are threatening the
name of Stanford fraternities and
the reputation of the University
I itself.
