# LION-HEARTED LEO
## Leo Lermond, Who Has Taken Into Camp Three Men That Have Beaten The Great Flying Finn 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Just about a year ago I wrote, in
a story on Leo Lermond, that track
fans should not overlook-the fact
that the Boston Athletic Associa
tion flyer was quite capable of
making Paavo Nurmi do some
extra-fast stepping'. Nurmi was
beaten by Conger who was later
beaten by Lermond, and "Lion-
Hearted Leo" also took two other
conquerors of the famous • Flying
Finn into camp, namely Purje and
Wide. The transition of Leo Ler
mond from a two-miler into a miler
about a year ago was one of the
sensations of the winter track sea- .
son, but in the board campaign
that is about to open the fans wlil
have to do without the rangy Bos
tonian, for the popular distance ,
runner lias gone to Australia to
compete in a, series of races "down
under."
While Leo lacks the rhythmic
running style and grace of a Nurmi 1
or a Wide, he gets there just the
same and his wonderful finishing
sprints have brought 1 he fans to
their feet on many occasions. He
has plenty of power in reserve 110

matter how his head bobs up and
down or rolls about. Don't be
fooled into thinking that he is - "all
in" because he looks that way! —
and the big heart and great stride
of this likable lad often carry him
ahead at 11 terrific place when he
really feels ready to drop. Espe
cially in the final two laps of a
race does this latent power show
itself. Leo's last-minute "kick" is
a sight to behold.
In Amsterdam, at the 1928 Olym
pic Games, Lermond finished fourth
in the 5,000 meter run, trailing
Ritola, Nurmi, and Wide, the
"Three Scandinavian Musketeers."
In the winter previous he had run
two miles in 9:16 4-5 at the Na
tional Indoor games, and last win
ter he forced Conger to do 4:13 1-5
in the mile, in that thrilling Con
ger-Lermond-Wide-Purje contest in
Madison Square Garden. Then, at
the General Wingate Memorial
Fund meet in New York last sum
mer, he turned in his sensaliouul
4:1", and later beat Conger at Den
ver to win the outdoor National
A.A.U. mile title.

While Leo lacks the rhythmic
running style and grace of a Nurmi 1
or a Wide, he gets there just the
same and his wonderful finishing
sprints have brought 1 he fans to
their feet on many occasions. He

down or rolls about. Don't be
fooled into thinking that he is - "all

and the big heart and great stride
of this likable lad often carry him
ahead at 11 terrific place when he
really feels ready to drop. Espe

a sight to behold.
In Amsterdam, at the 1928 Olym

in the 5,000 meter run, trailing
Ritola, Nurmi, and Wide, the
"Three Scandinavian Musketeers."
In the winter previous he had run
two miles in 9:16 4-5 at the Na
tional Indoor games, and last win
ter he forced Conger to do 4:13 1-5
in the mile, in that thrilling Con
ger-Lermond-Wide-Purje contest in
Madison Square Garden. Then, at
the General Wingate Memorial
Fund meet in New York last sum

4:1", and later beat Conger at Den

A.A.U. mile title.

that the Boston Athletic Associa

making Paavo Nurmi do some
extra-fast stepping'. Nurmi was
beaten by Conger who was later
beaten by Lermond, and "Lion-
