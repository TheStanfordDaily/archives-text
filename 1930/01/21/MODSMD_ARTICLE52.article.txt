# STANFORD BOXERS GETTING IN SHAPE FOR COMING BOUTS
## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney is rapidly '
whipping his boxing squad into '
fihape for the strenuous season of j
scrapping which is in store for the j
ndtt-slingers, and every indication i
points to a successful season for !
the Card boxers.
Maloney personally directs the !
workouts of the squad, and rope- i
skipping, shadow boxing, and ac- !
tual ring work are the order of the j
day, as well as intensive drill on 1
slips, counters, an dother essen- j
tials of the clever leather pushers' j
art.
"At present two new men, both :
freshmen, are showing excellent :
prospects of developing into out- j
standing boxers," Maloney stated, j
"Dick Miller, a welterweight, pos- :
sesses all the natural attributes of |
an athlete, and is perhaps the best |
man of that weight at Stanford |
since the days of Joe Murphy, now I
District Attorney of Nevada. Fred '
Glover, a featherweight, will also |
be an asset to the squad before he I
finishes his college career." 1
