# STANFORD CAGERS START WORKOUTS FOR BEAR CLASH
## Coach Hunt Dissatisfied With Charges' Showing Against U.S.C. Five 
### S. D 
Far from satisfied with the show
ing of his charges against U.S.C.
I over the past week-end, Coach Husky
Hunt put his basketball varsity
through a heated workout yesterday
afternoon in preparation for the first
; tilt of the annual Big Series with
I California to be played in the Farm
Pavilion on Saturday.
Although both Stanford and Cal
j are down in the Conference cellar and
' each team has suffered a good num
ber of defeats to date, the Pavilion
will probably be packed to the rafters
on the 25th. For besides playing on
the home court for the first time in
two weeks, the Cards will take the
floor slight favorites to tame the
Bear quintet.
Not since Stanford came to life in
1921 and trounced the Berkeley boys
on a couple of hectic occasions, has
a Cardinal basketball squad been
conceded much of a chance, to cap
ture a Big Series. Hunt has seen his
fives go down to defeat ever since he
took over the coaching reins on the
Farm and is anxious to retaliate this
winter by handing Nibs Price's lads
, a trio of stinging defeats.
When the present season opened,
the various sports critics 011 the Coast
practically conceded Stanford a Big
Series win. And for a time it looked
as though ihe Bears would be
swamped by their Farm rivals, Stan
ford hanging up a record score on
Pacific while Cal dropped a three
game series to Kansas.
