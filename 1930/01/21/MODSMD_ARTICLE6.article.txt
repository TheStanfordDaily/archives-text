# SORORITY HOUSES FALL FOR FAKIR IN PLEDGE RUSH
## 
### 
Open arms and kisses greet
ed a Phi Kap "rushing papa"
last night when, dressed in a
fur coat and green hat, he
was received as a pledge with
sisterly affection by many
sororities who were fooled by
his make-up.
At the Alpha Phi house tlie
wolf in sheep's clothing was
admitted to the fireside where
his true identity was discov
ered when he attempted to
warm li is unusually large
hands.
His wits gained his admit
tance to the Gamma Phi
house, but not for long;
screams drove him from the
porteh of the Theta house;
the Alpha O's were a little
more hospitable, but the Kap
pas and Phi Phis locked the
door in his face.
He got perhaps his warm
est reception at the Chi
Omega house, but in his hurry
to leave he dropped a dainty
silk handkerchief, which is
serving as a clue for campus
sleuths.
