# HORN SOUND WORKS RED, GREEN SIGNALS IN TRAFFIC SYSTEM
## Controls for Palm Drive Highway Intersection Are Considered 
### 
Loud and joyous "beeping" ot
Klaxons will be the "Open Sesame"
for motorists crossing El Camlno
Ileal at Palm Drive and University
Avenue, if a unique sound traffic:
signal now being considered by
Palo Alio officials is installed at
that intersection.
The device, a General Electric
product, is arranged ho that a green
light would permit traffic on El
('amino Real to go through indefi
nitely until an approaching motor
ist on Palm Drive honking iiis horn,
sets the apparatus working. Then
a red light would stop highway
traffic at the same time that a
green light, would permit him to
< ross. After a short interval the
lights would reverse again, letting
the traffic continue.
The objection has been raised
that, the noon rush of cars down
Palm Drive, all tooting horns,
would keep the light green and
bold up highway traffic for 10 to
l. r » minutes at a time. This objec
tion is, however, ungrounded since
the red and green lights would
keep alternating at two-minute in
tervals, as they do in the ordinary
traffic light system, until no more
horns were blown. Then the traf
fic on El ('amino Real would be
given the right of way again. A
similar system has been used with
great success in the East during
the past year.
Since four parties, Palo Alto,
Stanford, Santa Clara County, and
the State Highway Commission, are
interested in the problem, its solu
tion must be worked out co-opera
tively.
