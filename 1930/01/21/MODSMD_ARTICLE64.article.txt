Whenever the sun shines a few
I minutes, Coach "Dink" Tcmpleton
trots out his varsity track squad and
! proceeds to warm up his charges on
tile muddy oval. Yesterday he ran
j the men in a number of his sprint
! relays, sending a lot of the middle
distance men out on a cross-country.
Krenz, Dawson, and Grey were j
tossing the shot under the direction
of Templeton. Krenz was pushing ;
the iron ball out better than forty-six !
feet without much effort, while Daw
j son and Grey were hitting close to
j the forty-five-foot mark. Dawson is ;
j handicapped with a weak wrist and j
1 has to put the shot from the palm of
j his hand without using his lingers,
| thus losing a foot or more in distance.
Prospects for a successful season
i look brighter with the reported re- i
' eovery of johnny Morrison from the
tendon injury he suffered In the I.C.
A.A.A.A. meet last summer. He is
running with the injured leg taped,
but Templeton thinks he will be all j
right before the track season starts. |
Morrison will have to lie at his best |
to beat Vic Williams of U.S.C., who
i nosed him out in the dual meet last
j year in the 440.
It is probable that the annual in
terelass track meet and the Irish
I marathon will be held after the L.A.
A.C. and Olympic Club meets 111
season, as there will be more than a
I month between the meet with the !
i Winged "O" and the meet with the
i 1 rojans on April 12. The interclass
I would' serve to keep the men in con-
I (1 it ion in the long wait between con
l tests.
