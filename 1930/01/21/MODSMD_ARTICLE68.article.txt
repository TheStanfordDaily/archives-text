# YEARLING QUINTET DRILLS FOR GAME WITH BEAR FROSH
## 
### 
With the first game of the Little
Big basketball series scheduled for
Saturday night at California, Coach
Jimmy Bradsliaw is drilling liis
freshman hoopsters hard in hopes
of winning the third successive
j series from the Bear yearlings. In
the last two years, Stanford first
year quintets have dropped but a
single contest to the Bear Cubs,
but the games this season should
i be close.
Both freshman organizations hold
i recent victories over Lowell High
School, the Cards winning by a
score of 27 to 10, and the Bears
20 to 11. In each case the college
i coaches started teams composed
of reserves, but were forced to sub
stitute regulars when the going
j got too rough.
Stanford's recent loss to the Palo
Alto casaba shooters should not
depress the yearling followers, as
the Vikings have one of the strong
est basketball teams in the state,
with an excellent chance of win
ning a championship. Palo Alto has
not suffered a defeat this season,
and has run up some enormous
scores against highly-rated oppon
ents, the Cards giving them the
toughest opposition they have had
this year.
California, with three straight
wins, falls short of approaching
the Card record of five consecutive
victories, and has not run up the
impressive scores that the baby
Redshirts have. Stanford's highest
score of the year was made against
the College of Pacific- five, whom
they trimmed 47 to 15.
| Bob Castro, Bear forward, has
been the most consistent shot on
the Berkeley quintet, running up
high score in nearly every contest.
For Stanford, no one man has ac
counted for the majority of points
in any two successive games, Han
cock, Meade, and Palmer alternat
ing for the high-point post.
