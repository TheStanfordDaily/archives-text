j "In no field of society is the slow
| progress of our changing social
! order more evident than in the
j field of medicine," said Dr. Ray
; Lyman Wilbur in his article,
I "Facts to Face in the Future,"
! which appears in the current issue
| of the Survey Graphic Magazine.
"Not until such pressing problems
i as the distressing illness of our
j relatives and friends do we become
I acutely conscious of the great dis-
I parities that exist at the present
| time in the distribution of proper
j medical care to the various ole
; ments in our population."
Few people, according to Dr. Wil
! bur, realize the number of ele
j nients there are in making up the
total bill for medical service and
j too long have physicians been
yoked to the historical system of
1 giving charitable care to the indi
i gent. sick.
"With the rapid changes going
j on in every phase of American life,
I the medical profession is constantly
i confronted with the fact that it is
i losing step and unless order comes
j out of the present chaos,
I solutions may lie developed which
| will be of great detriment to the
: interests of both patients and doc
j tors."
I Such is the situation, he says,
that now faces the Committee on
the Cost of Medical Care organ
ized in 1927, after two years of
conference with physicians, sani
tarians, and economists. The staff
| is now working on a five-year pro
j gram of fact-finding, including sur
j veys of medical needs and facili
| ties, study of medical costs, and
j analyses of specially organized
i medical service in industry and
! universities.
"It is too early for us to know
| what the results will be," he con
j eluded. "All we can say is that we
j are <fn our way and that we are
i trying to meet, the facts squarely
j and to work toward a typically
American solution of this massive
and vital problem."
