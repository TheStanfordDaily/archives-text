# FRESHMEN TO SUFFER FROM ILLICIT RUSHING
## Board Plans to Withhold Right of Pledging From First-Year Offenders Majority of Fraternities Agreed on Heavy Fine; Penalty To Be Warning 
### 
All freshmen found guilty of at- ;
tending an illegal rushing party |
will In* denied the privilege of!
liiedgiiig any Stanford fraternity!
loi a definite length of time.
Thus the Interfraternity Council |
went on record liy an almost unani
mous decision at its meeting last;
night in the lobby of the Old !
l iiion. This recommendation will i
be passed to the Interfraternity,
Hoard of Control which tries all j
cases of alleged illicit rushing.
Representatives of the twenty
tour campus Greek letter societies |
were of the opinion that such aj
stringent penalty will force the ,
treshnien to hesitate before they i
accept a bootleg invitation and ,
take the chance of forfeiting the j
privilege of pledging any house on !
tlie campus.
Four "Nays"
After a heated discussion a poll 1
was taken in which there were i
enl.v four dissenting votes out of a |
total of twenty-four.
Ii also was decided that the open .
rushing period, held at the start of j
the spring quarter, should consist 1
of two periods. The first will lie i
alternate days, each house rushing j
on every other day; the secondj
period will be solid, the houses
rushing every day during this time.
The number of dates that the 1
lreshmen may have with each
house during the first period was
left to the discretion of the Inter- j
fraternity Board.
Financial Report
A brief financial report to be i
made at definite times is expected '
to ,uive the Interfraternity Board
of Control information on living ;
expenses and housing accommoda-;
Hons, if a suggestion of the Board
offered last night is acted upon by
the Council in the near future. j
The Hoard also seeks the estab-;
Ibhment of a permanent trophy to i
be awarded the most representa
tive campus house. The houses, it.
was urged, are to be judged on I
scholarship, participation in cam
pus activities, and their financial !
condition.
