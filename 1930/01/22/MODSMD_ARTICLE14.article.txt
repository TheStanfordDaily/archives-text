Blinding rain, lrom a sudden !
1 Kf|ua 11 that blew in from the Pa

The theory was advanced by S.
! I). Welch, pilot and member of the
T. A.T.-Maddux board of inquiry,
which took testimony in a public
! hearing this morning for an official i
report to the company's board of
| directors. Welch, who had investi-,

; wreck, said the evidence showed
the giant tri-motored plane was
flying north at a very low altitude
'into the storm, and that visibility'
became so poor Pilot Basil Russell !

| so, it was explained, the craft lost j
! altitude slightly and in banking |
