### Bernard Pollard 
"The world not only loves lovers
1 hut il needs more of them," be
lieves Madame Amelita Galli-Curci,
lamed coloratura, soprano of the
'Metropolitan Opera Company. In
J an interview granted recently in
i San Francisco, the beloved singer
told the Daily that the fine art of
love was lost, and as a result the
j other arts had declined.
"Love is an art," she said, "and
all artists arc lovers. Women and
| not men are responsible for the
loss of love as a gracious accom
plishment. Men are big babies and
I in the past women have babied
them into doing great things. Now
both men and women are babies.
Women Fail
"Art comes from longing, not
ftoni satisfaction. It is the reaching
upward, not the securing that pro
vinces artistic things. Our modern
philosophy emphasizes satisfac
tion, and with material things this
is possible. The more important
hunger of our spirit is neglected,
' starved for its natural food, which
is art. Women of yesterday were
nble to create the illusion that they
could satisfy this hunger. They
maintained a pretty mystery about
their person, an indefinable some
thing kept attractive by restraint.
It was this something that called

"Most young people of today are
I not happy. Some of them are tired
jof living at twenty. They have
| tasted all of life and found nothing
j worthwhile. They criticize because
I they are too undeveloped to ap
preciate maturely, and because of
their innocence they come to the
absurd conclusion that life is
worthless. Then they throw thein
j selves away. They cannot unlock
i the door to beauty because the
; door is gone. Women have torn it
' down.
Femininity Lacking
i "Femininity should have gone
jfciward with rights, not backward.

the successes of men from their
1 blunders and profiting by six thou

! But with the virtues ot man. wo
! man took over his vices. With her
j dwarfed vision she declared her
| self man's equal, Instead of Insist
ling, as she might have done, that
I slm was man's superior.
"She traded her assured seat in
the street car for a very doubtful
j one in an office. She shortened her
i skirts and her hair. In lino, she set
' out to achieve her notion of Inde
pendence. She became a man with
out a man's responsibilities.
"But something is wrong. The
J possibility of independence has un
dermined her former security and
