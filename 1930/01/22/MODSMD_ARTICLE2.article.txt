## 
### 
NT.YV YORK, Jan. 21 (&).â€”The
possibility of a concerted counter-at
tack on the Carnegie Foundation's
famous "Bulletin 23" on college ath
letics loomed today as a result of the
I'nivcrsity of Michigan's action iu
making an official reply to some of
the charges contained in the report.
In his annual report to the Michi
gan faculty as chairman of the hoard
on control of athletics, Professor
Ralph YV. Aigler had charged the
C arnegie report was unfair and "al
most vicious," This brought a quick
reply today from Dr. Howard J. Sav
age of the Foundation who retorted
that the Foundation had discovered
no reason, a-> yet, for altering any of
the statements made in that sensa
tional document.
