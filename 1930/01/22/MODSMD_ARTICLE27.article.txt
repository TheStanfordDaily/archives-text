# ACTION THAT MEANS SOMETHING—FROSH TAKE HEED
## 
### 
Any freshmen found guilty of attending an illegal
rushing party will forfeit the privilege of pledging
ANY fraternity for a definite period of time.
So reads the resolution adopted liv Stanford fraternities through
the Interfraternity Council at a meeting last night. This statement
will be passed on to the Interfraternity Hoard of Control, the body
that has final action on fraternity affairs.
By this recommendation Stanford fraternities took a long step
toward correcting the nefarious illegal rushing practice which has
been so prevalent oimlk* campus in vears past.
Not only is the regulation of the activities of fraternity men
fully provided for, hut the- other equally important problem has
been dealt with—the activities of those who cause half the trouble,
the freshmen.
]'reshmen are now to lose the idea that illegal rushing parties are
a lark, kven though it's pleasant to first-year vanity to be singled
out bv houses on the Row for special attention and no-expense par
ties, the Interfraternity Council's action will make reason take the
place ot vanity and cause the hrosh to think twice and three times
before they dare risk their chances to join ANN' FRATERNITY
by participating in the plucking of forbidden fruits.
By adopting this stand the fraternities automatically took a defi
nite step toward an ultimate solution of the problem of illegal rttsh
ing.
It is human nature to accept glowing and flattering invitations
to one of these rushing parties, no matter what character of a man
the freshman may he 11 a house dares to risk its chances of pledg
ing and its bid is accepted by a freshman that man is comparable
to a sneak, a violator of convention and despicable in all that stands
for the description—A Stanford (ientleman.
To some this may seem a harsh recommendation. But it is no
more harsh than the steps taken against fraternities when they vio
late the law. Ihe problem is just as much the freshmen's as it is
the houses', and there is no reason whv thev should not be held as
liable.
It goes without saying that such steps will dampen completely
the enthusiasm of the first-year men for sub rosa parties. Xovv that
they are given to understand the consequences, a span of mules
could not drag most of them into illegal rushing. The houses, too,
will be forced to respect stub a measure for their own good and for
the good of the men thev hope to take.
it was argued that this move would be unsatisfactory because
fraternity men would not turn in freshmen whom they might them
selves want. This argument does not seem valid for the simple
reason that all the houses don't want tilt the freshmen. C ertainly
there have been enough illegal rushing parties going on, and enough
freshmen attending them, that some houses could have reported
some of them for either the < ireeks or their bootleg guests.
1 he campaign against intercourse between the Row and Kncina
has been carried on with vigor and fearlessness thus far. Last
night's action shows that the fraternities are in earnest. They are
through pussyfooting. Ihe outlook' for a clean, honest rushing sea
son is optimistii 1 lie penalty for guilt has been placed on the right
party.
Xo longer will freshmen feel themselves obliged to accept an
illicit invitation. If they are wise they will turn it down immedi
ately, for being caught means that they cannot pledge AX Y campus
fraternity for a definite period of time.
