# CLEARING MUDDLED DECKS
## 
### 
Constructive work 1 hat is being arcomplislie*l piece by piece
promises to bring tfie I nite<l States the first eilicient Department f»f
the Interior as Dr. Rav Lvinan Wilbur, absentee President of Stan
ford, patiently probes tbe snarls and twists of the country's internal
problems, sometimes to the consternation of wily politicians who
infest Washington.
l or the first time in many years there sits in the Interior chair
a person of sufficient "hardboiled* or, as I )r. \\ ilbur terms it, "thick
skinned," attitude who has the w ill power and courage t<» straighten
out unhesitatingly the messiest and dirtiest governmental office
against the wishes and desires of crafty schemers.
As the result of this patient undertaking Stanford's President
expects to clear the muddled decks of tbe Hattleship Interior before
bis first term of office expires. It will be the only time since the*
World War that the Department of the Interior has not seen "buck
passing" disrupt its workings and transactions. And even though
ibis ironing out of internal wrinkles means a certain amount of
disagreeableness from persons seeking their own end, Dr. Wilbur
finds the post of Secretary of the Interior fascinating.
Stanford is proud that such a representative of its service and
training is contributing to tbe progress of the country.
