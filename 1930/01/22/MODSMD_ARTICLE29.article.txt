' NAVY BLUES—At The Stanford.
Every ho often Metro-Goldwyn
j Mayer lias trundled out tin* equip
ment and "co-operated" with our
( government to set their stars in a
story of one of the "services." The
talkies have not stopped the pro
endure, ami the latest product is
."Navy Blues" with the ever smart -
{decking William (we call him
billy) Haines.
"Navy Blues" has some line mi
\"i| photography ami a few laughs
ami manages to keep the interest
■ up. "Billy" grimaces his way
I through the opus, sometimes amus
! ingly, and sometimes sickeningly.
First he is "tough," then coquet
tish, and then sort of poignant and
sweet. You feel I hat he is trying a
J littlr» 100 hard to he just the snappy
1 number with a smart one for even
situation.
Judging from the reactions of I
the audience at the Fox (The Last
jV'ord) Theatre when the picture j
played in San Francisco, "Billy"
is a world-beating panic, just a
j "card." But Palo Alto onlookers
: will probably not he so receptive.
Karl Dane is worked in for a. few
' laughs," and Anita Page plays the
love interest. Better is the work
of Edythe Chapman and J. Nu
gent as Anita's parents.
"Navy Blues" is bound to please
in parts and gripe in others. Your
impression will probably be two
sided and hard to iletine. —J. T.
HIDE IN THE DARK. By Frances
Noyes Hart (Doubledjy, Doran
& Company, Inc., New York,
1929.)
Entertaining but hopelessly en
tangled characters and situations
j that is the best that can be said
for Frances Noyes Hart's latest
book, "Hide in the Dark," which
falls below the standard of her
, "The Bellamy Trial."
The story occurs on All Hallows
Eve, 1028, in an old manor house
south of Washington. The March

. Hares, a group of friends drawn
1 together by tin* common guarantee
of witty madness, gather for a re
union after ten years. There are
four securely married couples,
three of whom have been married
I Lor some eight or nine years and
are still surprised al each other's
j actions. The live otliei guests pair
up nicely with on>> man conven
ient ly It fi over to Im murdered.
All tin' details are perfect for a
mystery story- thirteen guests,
the shadow of (lie strnfige death
of a former March Hare still hov
ering over the gay group, a driv-
Ing storm with wind that rasps
I I lie nerves, an easily discernible
I and growing feud between two of
the men, and al midnight intense
blackness as all lights are turned
t.ut i oplay 'hide in the dark.'
Then a ghastly scream is beard
| and Jill is found staring al her out -
stretched bloody hands as she
I stands by Hie couch where the
murdered man lies. The last half
of the book sweeps one into a wild
daze ill confusion as motives and
evidence pin on nearly all tlie
March Hares in turn. Now and
then one has a feeling that lie
knows who the culprit* really is
but there is no doubt but that, any
hall' a dozen of them might have
done the foul deed.
Hart's lengthy descriptions - of
the characters make the beginning
of the story slow and tedious, al
though tlie; e same descriptions are
rather amusing in their very ver
hoseness and ridiculous similes.
Cut (he end gives an unusual little
iwist, and considering thai two ro
mances have been settled and a
mystery solved, the last two thirds
of the book compensates for the
lack of interest in Ihe beginning.
It at least may be said that front
page one hundred on, one would
hate to have Mother come in and
say, "Turn out tlm lights and go
to sleep now. You can finish your
book iu the morning." It. L. B.
