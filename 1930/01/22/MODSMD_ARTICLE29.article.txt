"Navy Blues" has some line mi

I through the opus, sometimes amus

Judging from the reactions of I

is a world-beating panic, just a

of Edythe Chapman and J. Nu

HIDE IN THE DARK. By Frances
Noyes Hart (Doubledjy, Doran
& Company, Inc., New York,
1929.)
Entertaining but hopelessly en
tangled characters and situations
j that is the best that can be said
for Frances Noyes Hart's latest
book, "Hide in the Dark," which
falls below the standard of her
, "The Bellamy Trial."
The story occurs on All Hallows
Eve, 1028, in an old manor house
south of Washington. The March

. Hares, a group of friends drawn
1 together by tin* common guarantee
of witty madness, gather for a re
union after ten years. There are
four securely married couples,
three of whom have been married
I Lor some eight or nine years and
are still surprised al each other's
j actions. The live otliei guests pair
up nicely with on>> man conven
ient ly It fi over to Im murdered.
All tin' details are perfect for a
mystery story- thirteen guests,
the shadow of (lie strnfige death
of a former March Hare still hov
ering over the gay group, a driv-
Ing storm with wind that rasps
I I lie nerves, an easily discernible
I and growing feud between two of
the men, and al midnight intense
blackness as all lights are turned
t.ut i oplay 'hide in the dark.'
Then a ghastly scream is beard
| and Jill is found staring al her out -
stretched bloody hands as she
I stands by Hie couch where the
murdered man lies. The last half
of the book sweeps one into a wild
daze ill confusion as motives and
evidence pin on nearly all tlie
March Hares in turn. Now and
then one has a feeling that lie
knows who the culprit* really is
but there is no doubt but that, any
hall' a dozen of them might have
done the foul deed.
Hart's lengthy descriptions - of
the characters make the beginning
of the story slow and tedious, al
though tlie; e same descriptions are
rather amusing in their very ver
hoseness and ridiculous similes.
Cut (he end gives an unusual little
iwist, and considering thai two ro
mances have been settled and a
mystery solved, the last two thirds
of the book compensates for the
lack of interest in Ihe beginning.
It at least may be said that front
page one hundred on, one would
hate to have Mother come in and
say, "Turn out tlm lights and go
to sleep now. You can finish your
book iu the morning." It. L. B.

HIDE IN THE DARK. By Frances
Noyes Hart (Doubledjy, Doran
& Company, Inc., New York,
1929.)
Entertaining but hopelessly en
tangled characters and situations
j that is the best that can be said
for Frances Noyes Hart's latest
book, "Hide in the Dark," which
falls below the standard of her
, "The Bellamy Trial."
The story occurs on All Hallows
Eve, 1028, in an old manor house
south of Washington. The March

. Hares, a group of friends drawn
1 together by tin* common guarantee
of witty madness, gather for a re
union after ten years. There are
four securely married couples,
three of whom have been married
I Lor some eight or nine years and
are still surprised al each other's
j actions. The live otliei guests pair
up nicely with on>> man conven
ient ly It fi over to Im murdered.
All tin' details are perfect for a
mystery story- thirteen guests,
the shadow of (lie strnfige death
of a former March Hare still hov
ering over the gay group, a driv-
Ing storm with wind that rasps
I I lie nerves, an easily discernible
I and growing feud between two of
the men, and al midnight intense
blackness as all lights are turned
t.ut i oplay 'hide in the dark.'
Then a ghastly scream is beard
| and Jill is found staring al her out -
stretched bloody hands as she
I stands by Hie couch where the
murdered man lies. The last half
of the book sweeps one into a wild
daze ill confusion as motives and
evidence pin on nearly all tlie
March Hares in turn. Now and

but there is no doubt but that, any

All tin' details are perfect for a
mystery story- thirteen guests,
the shadow of (lie strnfige death
of a former March Hare still hov
ering over the gay group, a driv-
Ing storm with wind that rasps
I I lie nerves, an easily discernible

blackness as all lights are turned
t.ut i oplay 'hide in the dark.'
Then a ghastly scream is beard

stretched bloody hands as she
I stands by Hie couch where the
murdered man lies. The last half
of the book sweeps one into a wild
daze ill confusion as motives and
evidence pin on nearly all tlie
March Hares in turn. Now and
then one has a feeling that lie
knows who the culprit* really is
but there is no doubt but that, any
hall' a dozen of them might have
done the foul deed.
Hart's lengthy descriptions - of
the characters make the beginning
of the story slow and tedious, al
though tlie; e same descriptions are
rather amusing in their very ver
hoseness and ridiculous similes.
Cut (he end gives an unusual little
iwist, and considering thai two ro
mances have been settled and a
mystery solved, the last two thirds
of the book compensates for the
lack of interest in Ihe beginning.

page one hundred on, one would
hate to have Mother come in and
say, "Turn out tlm lights and go
to sleep now. You can finish your
book iu the morning." It. L. B.
