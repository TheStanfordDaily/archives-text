The Editor, Sir:
I For the benefit of those students
who work with one eye on the
clock and, incidentally, for those
who have classes and no time
pieces, may I suggest that the Li
j bvary clocks be repaired? If one
has to incite the Committee on
j Library Clocks to activity (a stim
j ulus seems to be in order), I pre
! surne I lie proper course of action
! would be to compile statistics on
the hours lost in hunting for the
correct time, but since no facts are
available offhand, I hope the Com
! mittee will be moved by its hn
! mnnitarian instincts and make an
effort to improve ibis unnecessary
j condition immediately.
Mosi disgustedly yours,
Watehless Waiter.
