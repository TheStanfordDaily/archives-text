# Remarkable Post-War Progress Of Germany Told By Stewart Way, '29
## 
### 
That Germany is once again the
mecca of students is evidenced hy
the ever-increasing number of
young men anil women who are
flocking to that, country to com
plete their education. Stewart
Way, '29, writes - bis impressions
alter six weeks in Germany as
Work Student.
"Germany has won the world
war! She is recuperating al an
amazing rate from the disastrous
ell eels <il tiie British blockade, the
waste of milural resources, anil the
waste of manpowerâ€”all incurred
by the great conflict. All this is
happening in spite of paying in
terest on the American capital she
i.ses, and paying reparation under
the Versailles treaty, a dirty trick
played on her by the allies.
Social Legislation
"America has much to learn from
Germany in the lield-of "social en
gineering. " We have (in America)
made splendid progress in the
. building of material things, but
! have failed miserably in the build
ing of healthy, happy, loving men
j and women. Consumers co-opera
tives in every little town, old age
pensions (the absence of "which in
America is a manifestation of bar
barism-), social insurance against
sickness, and unemployment chal
! lenge the American people!
"The greatest menace to Ger
. Man-American friendship is tlie
! Young Plan. It is based on the
. assumed war-guilt of Germany, and
rankles in the hearts of the people.
It also compels the nation to pay
. over a period of sixty-!liree years.
"It is Impossible for Germany to
pay for three reasons: Germany
. | economically is unable to pay. And
; | Germany is psychologically unable
I to pay. Revolution will come be
fore the end of those sixty-three
i years, if the German government
presses the payments from her citi
zens. The Young Plan also neces
sitates capitalization of German
industry by America. This makes
I socialization impossible where it
is absolutely necessary. The Ger
man worker must, make profits for
American investors as well as
carry hack-breaking reparations
payments.
"People here are politically alive.
Workers realize their Union of it
self cannot bring them to a better
slate. They are not fooled, as are
many American workers, into
i thinking they can "work up" into

Hie "upper crust" of society. Con
sequently, they take to political ac
tion to better their conditions.
They are organized politically in
| the sozialdemokratikpartei, the
I strongest of radical parties. This
j party advocates the thorough
i democratization of Industry through
j collective ownership of the produc
i tive forces of the country.
Ballots Count
I "Opponents to the socialists join
the Nationalist or conservative
1 arty. At any rale, everyone is in
j terested in politics because real
| economic issues are fought out at
; the polls.
"The average worker realizes
i that war is part of the old eco
nomic order, characterized by so
cialized production under private
j capitalism. All the workers with
whom I have spoken have emphati
cally stated that they will never
j support another war! American
I trade barriers are a serious hin
drance to the recuperation of eco
nomic - Germany as they practically
close off the largest foreign mar
ket."
