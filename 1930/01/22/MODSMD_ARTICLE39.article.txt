## THAT BEAR BUGABOO

That will-'o-the-wisp, the Pa
cific Coast Conference basket
ball championship, is scheduled
to flit past the Stanford cam
pus for the last time this sea
son next Saturday night, and
if tlie Cardinals would see
more of the phantom that has
successfully eluded their grasp
these many years, it behooves
them to cut the buck in no un
certain fashion.
In words of one syllable, Stan

This particular California con

alifoniia basketball games since
bat time is one of unbroken Blue

This year, if any, the Cards
should crack through, although
their record in conference play
to date is inferior to that of
the Bears. They bad the mis
fortune to catch U.C.L.A 'on a
"hot" rnyht in the Southland,
and broke even with the Tro
jans on the latter's court. That
second Trojan game is still
more or less of a mystery, but
it is in the books now and can't
be helped. Six games remain
on the schedule, five of them
in the Stanford Pavilion.
California, her ranks decimated
bv graduation, took three lickings
from Kansas I'. back on the Jay
h.iwkers' home stamping grounds,
and then while every one but Nibs
Price was weeping into his coffee
over tlie situation, the Bears rose
on their hind legs and clawed the
lulling out of I'.S.c. after losing
one game to the Southerners. They
followed this up by running a
cocky U.C.L.A. team onto the floor
in the first half, only to fold up
like a jacknife and lose by three
points in the second period. Oh
yes, the Bear's hide is not quite
ready for the rugmaker.
To cling to their mathemati
cal chance for the champion
ship, the Cards must win Sat
urday. But far more important
than that is the value of such
a victory to their morale. Cali
