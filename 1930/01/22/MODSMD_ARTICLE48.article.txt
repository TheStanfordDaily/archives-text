# AN IRISH LOCHINVAR....
## Belligerent Gerald Griffiths Is Heralded as Heavyweight Boxing Championship Contender During Year 
### Feg Murray, '16 
The belligerent young man pic
(ui'ed above, swinging l«ft and
i ialll from a crouch, and iu front
of as nifty a background as iliis
tired right hand lias drawn in
many moon, is, perhaps, a future
world's heavyweight champion.
The weaving, bobbing Irish Mr.
Griffiths of Sioux City and points
I West is rapidly getting bigger,
better, and tougher, and ii does not
take much imagination to picture
him as one of the prominent
heavyweight contenders during the
S coining year.
Gerald Ambrose Griffiths has a
likable way about him, and a rec
i ord that shows not only his ag
gressive spirit, but also his de
j termination to succeed. For in
j stance, Tuffy made liis first New
• York appearance in November
IU2S. I It- came out of the West as
h young Lochinvar who had 53
lights and had won them all, and
who had included in his victories
three successive knockouts over
s ich cagey veterans as Tony Mar
ullo, Mike McTigue, and Joe An
derson.
It's all ancient history of course,
how Jimmy Braddock stopped the
| stage-struck Tuffy in the second
round. But was Gerald Ambrose
(liscouraged? Most emphatically he

• was NOT. lb 1 won three more
bouts before the year ended, beat
ing Belanger, Johnson, and Doris
in nine days. Tliis year he got a
double-barreled revenge on Brad
dock (and on Leo Lomski too) in
la round-about and a very nice way
for Braddoek. He won a decision
over Leo Lomski after Leo had
i beaten both Braddoek and himself.
TnlTy recently won a decision from
that tough old warrior Paulino
| Uzcudun, so if he survives Johnny
Risko he'll be right up there with
the Sharkeys and Seh'mellngs.
