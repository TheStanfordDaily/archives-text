# NINE MEETS CLUB TEAM IN SEASON OPENER SATURDAY
## Strong Stanford Squad Is Expected With Eight Lettermen Back 
### 
Although the first conference
game of lilt' Ht.'iO baseball season
is more than three weeks oft',
Coach Harry Wolier is rapidly
whipping bis recruits into shape
for a series of practice names with
various semi-pro teams, the tirst of
which will lie played here Satur
day with the Olympic Club.
With eight lettermen back in
uniform, Wolter has a. strong nu
cleus around which to . build bis
team. "Spud" Hardy will again be
behind the bat but Hon Oswill will
probably see plenty of action also
before the season is ever.
One of the hottest competitions
will center around first base. Muir
h< r Wright, last year's first sacker,
has returned, but Wolter plans to
play him in the outfield, leaving
Teague, Goodell, Kelly, and Fox to
light if out for the bag.
Perry Churchill will be on the
Keystone sack again, Imi Cutshaw,
a transfer from Brawley J.C., re
puted to be plenty good, may take
over the position.
Laird Is Captain
Captain Bill Laird will hold down
the hot corner with Ma gee and
Sampson as capable understudies,
while Dykes Johnson will again
take care of the windy alley. Camp
bell, a transfer from Menlo Jaysee,
is another good shortstop, and
White, who held down the short
patch on the freshman team last
year, may get in.
Three lettermen will play in the
pastures this year, Johnny Hunken
in the left pen, "Red" Berg in the
1 inlil corn patch, and Wright be
tween them. Any one ol' the three
may be displaced by numerous as
pirants including Kintala, Witte
hiiii, and Riede, a transfer from
Ma rin.
The pitching staff, however,
looks to b<' the weak spot in the
team. Four regulars have been
lost, leaving only Perry Taylor still
on the mound. Story and Loomis,
star pitchers for the t'rosh two
years ago, may have the day,
though, and there is Leverenz, who
played foi 1 tlie babes three years
ago but who has been out sick
since then, who may also turn in
a lew victories for the Cards.
