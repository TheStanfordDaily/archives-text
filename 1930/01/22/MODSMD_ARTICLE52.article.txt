# Rothert Out With Infected Toe; Card Chances Take Drop
## 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Whatever edge the Cardinal varsity
five was (loped to have over the Bears
in the first tilt of the annual Big
, Series to be played in the Stanford
Pavilion on Saturday night was com
j when Captain Harlow Rothert showed
pletely wiped out yesterday afternoon,
.up to practice with an infected toe.
Although Rothert may be able to
I play by Saturday, it is certain that
he will not be allowed to work out
i for the rest of the week, and consc
i qucntly will not be in the best of
{shape to face the Cal quintet. The
Hard leader sustained a blister dul
ling the lirst L.S.C. fracas last week
end, which developed into a slight iu
lection the following evening when
Rothert again played most of the
time against the Trojans.
Coach Husky Hunt is confronted
with plenty of troubles this week
with Rothert out of the lineup, as the
latter is\not only valuable in getting
the tip-oft, but the best man on the
! squad in recovering the hall off the
[backboard :r* well.
Fawcett Has Cold
I The rest o/ the Redshirts came
'through the Trojan tilt-- in good shape
with the exception ol Vance l-awcelt,
who is still slowed up to some extent
with a bad cojd. However, Hunt is
hanking on the veteran forward to
'come through as lie did down south,
when Fawcett sank baskets from all
j over the court in the series opener
to capture high point honors.
