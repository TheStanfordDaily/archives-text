# NEWMAN QUINTET DEFEAT THETA XI CAGERS, 12 TO 10
## Alpha Sigs Lose To Betas With 37-10 Score; Fijis Win 
### 
Fast, rough play featured the
12-lu win of the Newman Club
quintet over Theta .\i in the
closest game of intramural basket
ball played last night. Frequent
spills and fouls made the contest
erra:ic.
Starting fast, the fraternity men
held an early lead, but the clubmen
milled by half-time and the game
was nip-anil tuck during the linn I
l periods. No one player was out
standing for either squad; Boyd of
the club and Worsley of Theta Xi
lied for high-point honors with t
each.
(leorge Gray, big shot-putter,
looped in 1!) points to lead Beta
Theta Pi to a decisive U7-10 vie
tcry against Alpha Sigma Phi in
,'i fairly fast, contest, the result of
which was never in doubt.
A rather uneventful game saw
Sigma Nu cop honors from Phi
(lamina Delta, 1(1-1!!. Poor shoot in
lost the Fiji's a chance to make
the contest really close, since the
leamplay was about equal. Dyer,
lanky center for Sigma Nu, m
counted for !> of his team's digit-
Alpha. Delta. Phi failed to show
up, so Kappa Sigma, took the
fourth scheduled game by default
