# LACK OF VISIBILITY HALTS AIR SEARCH FOR PILOT EILSON
## Planes Waiting at Nome For Better Weather Before Starting 
### 
NOME, Alaska, Jan. l\ </P).
J.ack of visibility here and in north
ern Siberia is the only tiling, which
prevents an aerial reconnaissance of
the region where Carl Ben Eielson
and Earl Borland, American aviators,
disapjieared November 9 last.
Word today from the niotorship
Nanuk at North Cake, Siberia, to
which Eielson was Hying when he
became lost, said that repairs have
been completed on Harold (villain's
airplane, which was damaged Decem
ber 1.1 in an attempted take-off from
the ship. Ciliam had been awaiting
the arrival of welding equipment
from Nome, but engineers aboard the
Russian steamer Stavropol, which is
frozen in the ice three miles from the
Nanuk, succeeded in making the re
pairs.
Bad Hying weather at the Russian
ice-breaker l.itke's position in Provi
dence Bay, 350 miles southeast of
North Cape, has delayed the depar
ture of two Junkers planes which also
will aid in the search.
The Junkers planes, manned by So
viet aviators, are to carry dog teams
and sleds with them for use in the
event of a forced landing. The Rus
sians plan to skirt Bering Strait and
the Arctic Ocean until they reach
Koliuehin Bay, where a supply of
five barrels of gasoline lias been
stored. From Koliuehin Bay it is only
a short hop of 190 miles to the base at
North t ape.
Delayed here six days by unfavor
able weather, Pilots Pat Reid and Ed
Young today were hoping to be able
to make the GO-mile hop to Teller, the
last Alaskan outpost for them before
they start searching over Siberia's
northern coast.
