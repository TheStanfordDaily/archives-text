# EASTERN HOCKEY WELL ORGANIZED
## Hockey Camps Attended By Players in East

"Western hockey has great pos
sibilities," declared Kitty McLean,
captain of the Ail-American team,
"but because of better organiza
tion and a widespread interest and
knowledge of the sport, the East
is able to play a superior game."
The reverse stick is never played
by the All-American team because
the Eastern squad believes that it
makes a poor position and conse
cuently a poorer shot and is easier
to foul. They are trained in run
ning fast, stopping and turning
quickly; and because of continual
practice have perfect muscle co
ordination. The Easterners also
differ from Stanford by playing
their fullbacks farther from the
forward line.
Card Players Clean
Comparing U.C.L.A. and Stan
iord teams, the players said that
they preferred to play with Stan
ford as the Cards play a cleaner
game. The southern university is
fester but fouls more.
Not only are there organized
(lubs in ail the Eastern cities who
play competitive games, but many
of the players attend a hockey
camp during the month of Septem
ber. At camp each day is devoted
to stick practice, followed by a
practice in tactics at which time
a game is played and every wrong
play is called and corrected. After
this a regular match is run off. The
evenings are devoted to a rule
catechism and the science of the
game is illustrated on jhe black
board where different plays are
worked out and discussed. Every
member on the All-American team
has been to this camp at least
once.
The East lias had the advantage
of playing with English teams
in the past.
