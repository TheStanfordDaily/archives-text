# California Wastes Natural Gas, Says Ray Lyman Wilbur

"The industrial future of the
state i.s bring blown up into the
air in the form of gas from oil
w< lis," said Dr. Bay Lyman Wil
bur, Secretaray of the Interior, in
j an interview for the Daily yester- J
i day.
I Dr. Wilbur is 111 the West to in
i vestigate oil production on govern- j
i mi nt lands and to determine means
I ol: conservation of the natural re
| sources of the country. "In the his- ,
j lory of the petroleum industry, it ,
j has long been considered the right
| of the oil companies to liberate
! natural gas into the air. The eost j
j of storing the gas is prohibitive,"
1 he continued.
Agreements Fail
! "There have been voluntary '
i agreements to prevent drilling on i
j government land privately held uo
| der lease, but weils have come in
! on adjoining property which does
i not fall under the jurisdiction of
the federal government. This j
causes a difficult situation because j
the operators holding leases com- i
plain that the oil is being drained |
! from under their property by com- I
| panies which are not regulated by
the agreements," Dr. Wilbur point-1
I ed out.
| Millions upon millions of cubic
j feet of natural gas have been ;
| wasted in the past because there j
j was no demand for the product.)
j When the Militant discovery well
i came in in the Kettleman Hills re
| gion, there was enough natural gas
; liberated into the air to furnish the j
! whole city of San Francisco with
'fuel. Dr. Wilbur's purpose is to!
i prevent such terrific waste by or* 1
! derly control of drilling.
According to Dr. C. F. lolman,
: ol the Geology Department, a case
! is being tried in Los Angeles to
i test tJie constitutionality of the
i present conservation laws. Very
i bitter feeling has been evidenced 1
| in the attitudes of the various oil
j c<:m panics toward a curtailment of
| petroleum production, although the
I country is a I present faced with a
I tremendous over-production.
