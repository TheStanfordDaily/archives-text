### Elisabeth Larsh 
U.v making free and varied use
I of both the aside and (lie soliloquy
I In "The Mistress of the Inn," which
1 will he given here next month,
1 Carlo Goldini, famous 18th century
Italian playwright, has added plot
development to the comedy ele
ment, and to the obviousness of
; the characters of this classic play.
Throughout the comedy, frequent
Rt.ides and an occasional soliloquy
provide a rather obvious but, in
this case, not objectionable, means
or Informing the audience of what
htis happened and what is going;
to happen. The complicated inter
relationships of tlie suitors of Mir
. aiulolina, th»! mistress of the inn,
are elucidated as the Count of Al
, baflorita and the Marquis of Forli
popoli bicker back and forth,
sprinkling their arguments with
, remarks which prove enlight
ening as well as entertaining. Some
of the subterfuges of the charming
mistress and the two actresses who
are all after various men are re
vealed by means of clover asides
I and solilioquies, as are also the
i prospects of h 11 the suitors for the
I band of Mirandollna.
Actresses Comic Pair
Much comic b.v-plny is also the
result of (Joldoni's use of the aside,
> particularly between the charac*
ters of Ortensia and Deianira.
These two actresses, whose arrival

hi I lie inn causes ;t change of heart
in one person and great relief in
another, are an extremely eoniie
pair with their ambitious enter
prises and the latter's constant
trustration of t hosf■ plans. The
Cavalier of llipafratla also affords
i some good comedy in his solilo
quies while he is in the throes of
falling in love. His resistance to
the fascinations of Hie mistress
is .violent at first, vacillating a
little later, and totally futile in the
j end.
Soliloquies Important
These aside devices are most
i important perhaps as indices to all
I of these rather obvious but thor
j ouglilv real characters. Through
. the soliloquy Mirandolina announc
es her intention of going after one
| suitor in particular as follows:
"May my nose drop off, if lie
doesn't fall in love before tomor
row!" And as the play progresses
her nose remains decidedly and
rightfully attached. Similarly, the
I audience is allowed to hear the
'suitor's reactions to Mirandolina's
j subtle campaign through the aside
and the soliloquy.
In fact, fhe employment of these
devices is a very important ele
ment in "The Mistress of the Inn."
for, alt hough it does not approach
ftiigene O'Neill's use of (hern, (»nl
doni two centuries ago apparently
appreciated' the efficiency of this
technique and put it to good use.
