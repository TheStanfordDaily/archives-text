### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22 (ff).
('resident Hoover's policy of commis
sion investigations was condemned in
the Senate todav after the foreign re
lations committee had declined his
request for congressional authority to
send a commission to Haiti.
The committee did approve a sub
stitute proposition authorizing the
$50,(KM) requested hy the President
for a study of Haitiali hut
even this proposal was blocked in >he
Senate. Committee members had ta
ken the position that the President
has the power to name his own com
mission and could do so without con
gressional approval.
Senator Blaine, Republican, Wis
consin, and Senator McKellar, Demo
crat, Tennessee, objected to immedi
ate consideration of the substitute
resolution. It went over for future
discussion. The Tennessee senator
remarked that he was inclined "to
think we have all the commissions we
need." Senator Blaine assailed con
stant appointments of commissions
and insisted no investigation was
necessary in I laiti.
In bringing up the modi lied Haitian
resolution, Chairman Borah of the
foreign relations committee observed
that "it seems the more speedily we
act, the more speedily we would get
out of Haiti."
