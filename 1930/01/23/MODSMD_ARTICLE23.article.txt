# LEAGUE SYSTEM SUCCEEDS---LUTZ
## Check And Supervision Is Effective, Club Told 
### 
"The present system of check and
supervision that the League of Na
tions holds over the niandatorial pow
ers in their policies toward mandates
lias been very effective," said Pro
fessor R. H. Lutz of the History De
partment in an informal talk at the
meeting of the International Rela
tions Club last night.
In relating the events of the. meet
ing of the Institute of International
relations, held at Riverside last De
cember, where he conducted a round
table on "Mandates," Professor Lutz
told of a spirited argument between
Professor C. K. Webster of Harvard
and two others present at one of the
sessions of his round table.
"Professor Webster maintained that
the menace in the possibility that
mandates would become colonial pos
sessions has practically disappeared
during the last ten years under the
League system," he continued, "and
my views correspond with what he
believes. However, no one. can fore
east the future, though we may live
to sec the day when mandates all be
come independent republics."
Professor Lutz considered the con
vention at Riverside a huge success,
since a great number of problems
were discussed thoroughly.
