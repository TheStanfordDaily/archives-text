V ONDON, Jan. 22. (#>)â€”The American, British, French, Italian, and
Japanese delegates to the Five Power Naval Conference played hide
and-seek all over London today in final exchanges of views before the
first, business meeting at St. James Palace tomorrow morning, when
the chief delegates are to outline the general naval needs of their
countries.
From early morning until late tonight the big limousines, flying
national flags, slipped through the maze of London traffic from embassy

to embassy, and back and forth
from Downing Street.
Quiet Talks
With quiet talks in the seclusion
of their own headquarters and at
the residence of the British Prime
Minister, the delegates endeavored
to remove preliminary difficulties
and reach an understanding before
buckling down to actual work.
Throughout the day's proceed
ings the delegates sought, harmony
of expressions for tomorrow's first,
business session. As yet only the
broadest .phases of the problems
confronting the conference have
been touched upon. The concilia
tory note remains dominant.
Block False Report
Nevertheless the British, the
Americans, and the French simul
taneously blocked today the first
seriously erroneous report sent
abroad about the nature of the pro
ceedings. This report was to the
effect that. Premier Tardieu of
France was acting as a mediator
between Great Britain and the
United States who were described
as being "far apart."
British official circles quickly
discredited the report, while the
American delegation expressed sur
prise that it had been circulated.
Premier Tardieu himself and the
French delegation met it with an
official denial.
Yesterday reports were circu
lated to the effect that British and
American representatives had
failed to reach any common ground
of agreement, and that Premier
Andre Tardieu of France would act
as mediator.
Premier Tardieu was quoted as
saying that he would try to "recon
cile American and British theories
on several outstanding points."
