While college critics and sport
writers argue and talk about less
domination of athletic coaches
over players in competitive sports,
Palo Alto and Sequoia (Redwood
City) high schools will go ahead
and practice player control.

tomorrow night, in a basketball
game at Palo Alto the coaches will
be sitting on the officials' bench
away from their players, and all
control of the teams will be in the
hands of the respective captains.

Stanford graduate, is being intro
duced into this section by Coach
Howard Ray of Palo Alto and Coach
Frank Griffin of Sequoia. They have
