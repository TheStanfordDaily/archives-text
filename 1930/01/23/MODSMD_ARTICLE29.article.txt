LEAVENWORTH, Kans., Jan. j
-2. (A*) â€”Although official announce- i
ment was lacking, it was learned !
on good authority today that a pa- '
role lias been recommended for Dr.
Frederick A. Cook, Arctic, explorer
and oil promoter, who has spent ,
nearly five years in Leavenworth
federal penitentiary.
Federal action of the application ,
of the 65-year-old prisoner for re- ;
lease had been forecast previously j
because of his excellent prison rec
ord and the fact that officials con
nected with the prosecution offer
no objection to clemency.
