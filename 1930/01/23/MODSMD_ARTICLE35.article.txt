An indication of another encroachment of women into man's
activities was forecast on the campus Tuesday afternoon when more
than 25.0 spectators turned out to witness the lassies of the famous
l ive Hundred lose to the All-American hockey team.
The score does not indicate the true worth of the contest for
which eleven women traveled across the continent, hut it is pleas
ant to add that the Cardinal players handled themselves in a very
ahle fashion and fought hard to overcome their more experienced
rivals. The main result was the astonishing amount of interest taken
in the game by both co eds and the roughs, who now know how a
woman feels the first time she set s a baseball game and her escort
tries to explain the whys and wherefores to her.
Some time ago Stanford women protested against the practice
of holding glorified play days, where the teams from .Mills College,
California, and Stanford were mixed up hi a conglomeration that
became an awful mess as far as the effectiveness of team work was
concerned.
The interest showed Tuesday proves that intercollegiate sports
for women are feasible and the IJaii.y hopes the five Hundred
