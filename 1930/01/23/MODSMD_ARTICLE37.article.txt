# DAILY CAL SPEAKS ITS PIECE

"Xo more goodwill assemblies." gleefully announces the Slan
fi))(l Daily. It refers to an action ol the Stanford Kxecutive I 0111-
mittee in which that body went on record as opposing any goodwill
assemblies in the future.
The Daily is gleeful because last semester it. together with The
Calif ornian, engaged in a campaign to rid the two universities of
the farcical exchanges of diplomatic hypocrisy.
"The objections voiced at the meetings," it declares, "were that
representatives of the institutions interested are prevented from
bringing anv reallv worth-while message to the students visited by
tbe necessity for making wisecracks and expressions of goodwill.
The action of the Stanford Kxecutive Committee is of special
interest because last semester, when endeavors were made to end
the epidemic ol goodwill speeches prior to import.Tnt games, tbe
committee seemed to be lukewarm in favor of the speeches. At that
lime tbe president of the Stanford student body, however, declared
il did not matter to him whether the speeches took place or not, and
passed the buck to John A. Reynolds, A.S.I .( . president. Ihe
addresses were given.
Kast night Reynolds again was asked his stand on the subject.
I le stated that it was the same as ever, adding that Stanford's action
made no difference to him—no more speeches would occur during
his administration, anyway.
And so the matter rests. Stanford is against it. Many Califor
nians are against it. And perhaps a future Kxecutive Committee
someday officially will declare ilseli opposed to a tradition which by
its very nature' is inconsistent with the time at which it takes place.
