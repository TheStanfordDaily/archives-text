THAT FERGUSON FAMILY—At
the President Theatre.
That by-now-hackneyed theme of
I the parent-child conflict Is the
theme of this rather commonplace
play by Howard Ohenery. And it is
handled in no unusual manner. The
characters are type figures which
experience (lie usual emotions
aroused by such a situation.
Lillian Dean, in the part, of the
fault-finding, trouble-seeking, sour
mother, provides many laughs be
cause most, people have known, or
know, someone exactly like her.
Her nagging tyranny drives every
one nearly mad, and of course, in
the end she becomes a pathetic
figure, deserted by the children she
brought into the world and slaved
for.
The henpecked father who rises
up and shows his backbone when
faced by the problem of his chil-
I dren's happiness is played by Lloyd
Neal, who looks the part of the
henpecked father and who rises up
quite valiantly. He is as much a
type (but not so much exaggerated)
as liis wife, but bis tender scenes
with his (laughters are very real
1 and very moving.
Robert Keith, wlto is said to have
created the chief role in O'Neill's
"The Great God Brown," plays ihe
smart back-slapping bag of hot air
who marries one of the Ferguson
daughters, and who, of course,
turns out to be a pretty good egg.
lie is excellent in this part, but it
is hard to believe him capable of
"The Great. God Brown."
Other members of the cast in
titule three good-looking girls, two
good-looking men, and a typical
scandal-monger neighbor. None of
them is remarkable.
ALL OUR YESTERDAYS. By H.
M. Tomlinson. New York: Har
pers. 1930.
"All Our Yesterdays" is another
war book, but before you turn away
in boredom, let it be added that
here at last is THE war book for
which the world has waited for
more than a decade.
"All our yesterdays have lighted
fools the way to dusty death,"
mourned Macbeth. And now Mr.
Tomlinson takes the yesterdays of
1900, t lie Boer War, and shows
how, step by step, because of fear
and overwhelming pride, the en
tire world was swept into that

whirlpool or hatred: war.
Here is the wflr hook that does
not attempt, to create a sensation
nor on the other hand does it list
cut and dried facts wearily. It is
not a novel; there is no heroine or
love element. Hilt there is sus
pense, action, surprises, and strange
adventures, and one is held en
thralled until the final page.
"All Our Yesterdays" is a long
book and yet when the end is
reached it seems all too short.
Each word, every phrase, has
meaning. It is a hook that cannot
he hastily scanned and put. aside. It
requires deliberation and thought,
it is a book that, stirs you, makes
you revolt against war and men
that sacrifice their children to their
pride.
"'it isn't clean,' storms the old
! senior officer in the dugout. 'It's
horrible. Europe is eating her own
young.'
"That sounded serious. Nobody
moved or spoke; then a tiny voice
piped:
"'All right, Pa; we don't mind.'"
And so it goes.
Mr. Tomlinson gives us a story,
rather a history, a commentary.
He warns us:
"Our God has been deposed
again. There is another god now,
the State, the State Almighty. I
tell you that god will be worse than
Moloch. It lias no vision; it lias
; only expediency. It has no moral
ity, only power. And it. will have
no arts for it will punish the free
spirit with death. It will allow no
freedom, only uniformity. Its altar
will be a ballot-box, and that will
be a lie. Right before us js its pil
lar of fire. It has a heart of gun
metal and its belly is full of wheels.
You will have to face the brute,
you will have to face it. It is noth
ing but our worst, nothing the
worst of us, lifted up. The children
are being fed to it."
Speaking of the people whose
pride comes foremost, Mr. Tomlin
son writes: "They allowed it to
come, and they kept, it going, and
now the bitter end is a souvenir
for thenij It is not easy to forgive
them. But wisdom answers there
is nothing to forgive for they
never knew what they were doing.
, . . . . There is no longer a God
to whom one may appeal, but there
is 'more day to dawn,' and that is
the only hope.*' —N. .1.
