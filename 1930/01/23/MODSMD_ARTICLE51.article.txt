## THIRD STRAIGHT? 
### 
When Coach Jimmy Brad
shaw's freshman basketball
team takes the floor Saturday
night against the University of
California casaba-shooters, the
Cards will be battling for their
third consecutive series from
the Blue and Gold. For the last
two years Stanford yearling
quintets have handily deco
rated Berkeley hopes with a
heavy hanging of black crepe,
and according to all pre-season
dope, are scheduled to repeat.
The Class of l!)3l possessed bas
ketball talent capable of making
the most pessimistic coach imagin
ible give a shout of glee. Hawkins,
Reynolds, Pawcett, and Tampcke
ire names now well-known in the
local basketball world, the former
three now playing regular for the
Stanford varsity, while Tampcke is
starring for the Rossi Florists of
San Francisco, a team doped as
the most powerful contender for
the P.A.A. championships.
Playing as frosii, this group of
budding basketball stars went
through the season undefeated, un
til the Little Hig Series. Berkeley's
youngsters blasted Cardinal hopes
of a perfect victory by eking out
a slim victory over the baby Red
shirts in the initial contest. Not a
whit abashed by this unexpected
turn of events, the Stanford year
lings came back strong to swamp
the Cubs in the next, two games,
and capture the series.
In '32, Bradshaw -was handed an
exceptional dish of material. Plenty
of big, husky lads with years of
high school experience turned out
for the first practice. The team had
high hopes of repeating the fine
record, but dropped an early sea
son contest to the Santa Clara
frosh by a measley two points. How
ever, tliat. was the single game of
the year that was marked up on
the wrong side of the scoring pad
for the Card yearlings. This team
took two straight games from Cali
fornia's highly rated freshmen, end
ing the season with but one mark
on the liability side of its ledger.
What 1933 lacked in size, it
made up in fight. Taken as a
unit, the players were much
smaller than those on either of
the two preceding teams, but
the frosh have managed to bat-*
tie through a tough schedule of
early season games with but
two defeats. The first was
handed to the yearlings by the
Sacramento Junior College
qunitet, an organization com
sed largely of players with
e year of college competition
der their belts. The second
t-back was given the year
gs by Palo Alto High School,
thout doubt the largest, and
most powerful, prep school
quintet we have ever seen.
Saturday night at 6:45, the baby
Redshirts will go up against Cali
fornia's frosh for the first game of
the current series. Berkeley's pre
season record measures up favor
ably with that of the Cards. The
Blue and Gold .has won three
straight practice games from high
school teams by fairly respectable
scores, and should put up a good
liKlit against Stanford. The Cards
are conceded a slight edge, but it
would never do to underrate the
Golden Bear as its representatives
can be depended upon for a good
battle. Hopes are high among the
freshmen, and still higher among
those upperelassmen who started
the winning streak.
Odds may be about even, but
we favor the baby Redshirts as
our ambition is three straight!
