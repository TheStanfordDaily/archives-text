# Dry Weather Beckons To Golfers As Course Reopens
## 
### 
Clicking golf balls, cries of "fore,"
and other signs of the eighteen
hole-fever are in order again today.
After constant delay, Stanford's
golf season reopened yesterday
with rainless skies and green fair
ways to lure out the campus
Hagens.
With cloudy but dry weather fore
casted, golf officials are expecting
record turnouts over the week-end
for the recently opened course.
