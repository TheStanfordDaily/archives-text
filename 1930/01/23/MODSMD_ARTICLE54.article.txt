# U.C. Plans Yearly Cage Victory Over Stanford
## BEARS HAVE EVEN BREAK ON EVE OF GAME WITH CARDS Rothert's Injury Puts U.C. On Even Terms With Stanford Squad GOLDEN BEARS WIN 
### Stephen Dietrich 
In a whirlwind, last-minute
finish, California defeated the
St. Mary's basketball squad
last night by a score of 36 to
34.

Conceded but an outside chance
against. Stanford at the beginning
of the 1930 season, the California
basketball varsity is scheduled to
take the floor on even terms with
their Farm rivals in the first Big
Series tilt on Saturday night, now
that Harlow Rotliert, Card leader,
has been forced out of practice with
an infected toe.
In fact, the Golden Bear plans to
hand Hunt's cagers their yearly
beating, which it has done without
fail for the past five winters. Re
ports from Berkeley have it that
Nibs Price is putting his squad
through its workouts this week
with the greatest of optimism.
From the standpoint of experi
ence Stanford lias a slight edge,
with a team composed entirely of
veteran players, while the Bear
quintet lias but one regular from
last year's title-winning aggrega
tion. Yet, the Cards haven't been
able to click just right at any time
this season, with the exception of
the Pacific game, and have so far
shown up as an in and out team.
On the other hand, Cal has been
coming along slowly but steadily
and is- due to reach its peak against
the Cards. After taking three beat
ings from the University of Kan
sas, the Bears came to life and
broke even with the* Trojans in a
conference double-header. Last â€¢
Saturday Nibs' charges displayed j
real possibilities, when Cal held the :
strong U.C.L.A. five to a 20 to 23 !
score. Which is some contrast with j
the score of the Card-Bruin fracas, j
the Farm boys coming out on the j
short end by a thirty-three point '
margin.
One man on the Berkeley outfit ;
who is expected to cause Stanford j
lots of trouble is Captain Ten i
Eyck, playing his third year on the |
first string. Besides jumping at 1
center, the lanky Bear skipper is j
the key man to Nibs' offense, being |
especially adept at handling hot 1
passes under the basket which he
quickly converts into field goals.
Tripp and Pursel, at forward, are |
the leading scorers on the Cal team, 1
and Coach Price is counting on this '
pair to toss in plenty of shots on j
Saturday night. Although neither j
could be classed as a regular before i
this season, these hoop-loeaters !
have had years of experience on j
various hardwoods around the j
country, and are considered a i
threat at all times. Pursel found his j
eye during the recent Bruin tilt, and i
was high-point man with thirteen >
tallies.
