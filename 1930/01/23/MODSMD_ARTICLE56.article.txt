# HOLES-IN-ONE AT GOLF . .
## Hagen, Jones, Have Made Only Single Hole-in-One; New Jersey Pro Has 21 ; Veteran Wins Gold Putter 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Funny things these holes-in-one
golf. Walter Hagen lias only made
one, and Bobby Jones has only
made one, and that while playing
with Walter Hagen. Yet a compara
tively unknown English profession
al named Rowland Jones lias made
17! And that isn't, the, record!
Sandy Herd, famous veteran pro
of Moor Park, England, made his
eighteenth hole-in-one about a
month-and-a-lialf ago, and received
a solid gold putter as a reward. But
that isn't the record! "1 cannot tell
a lie," but Tom Washington, pro
at the Monomonock Inn course in
New Jersey, has made twenty-one
holes-in-one, and is thus the King
of all ace-makers of the world. In
1928 alone, Washington sank his
tee shot four times. Yet those two
English veterans, Harry Vardon
and John Ball, have only made a
couple between them in eighty
years of golf!

Last July Maurice Regimbal, a'
! nine-year-old Canadian boy, sank
his tee shot on a 125-yard hole at
North Bay, Out. But Sidney Colt
art, also nine years old, had made
an ace previous to that, at Valley
Forge, Pa. The oldest member of ,
this hole-in-one club that I have j
any record of is C. B. Kessing, 83, j
of Cincinnati, who scored an ace
on a 136-yard hole at the Hyde ;
Park course a few years ago.
Yessir, they're funny things,
these holes-in-one at golf. Mysteri- i
ous Will-O'the Wisps, 25% skill:
and 75% luck. Grant Orth of Pasa- i
dena made an ace the first time j
he ever swung a club on a golf 1
course, as did George Hester of
Dallas, and on New Year's Day,
11)29, too! And Paul T. Bloodsworth
of Hornell, N.Y., dropped dead from
excitement after dropping his tee i
shot into the cup.
Jim Drain, former national com
mander of the American Legion,
made the same hole in one shot
twice in two days, and Jim has
only one arm!
I
And Charlie Johns, a British pro- j
l went through twenty-five years of
I famine and then bagged 3 "ones" '
| within six weeks!
Funny things, these holes in one!

Park course a few years ago.
Yessir, they're funny things,
these holes-in-one at golf. Mysteri- i
ous Will-O'the Wisps, 25% skill:
and 75% luck. Grant Orth of Pasa- i
dena made an ace the first time j
he ever swung a club on a golf 1
course, as did George Hester of
Dallas, and on New Year's Day,
11)29, too! And Paul T. Bloodsworth
of Hornell, N.Y., dropped dead from
excitement after dropping his tee i
shot into the cup.
Jim Drain, former national com
mander of the American Legion,
made the same hole in one shot
twice in two days, and Jim has
only one arm!
I
And Charlie Johns, a British pro- j
l went through twenty-five years of
I famine and then bagged 3 "ones" '
| within six weeks!
Funny things, these holes in one!

Funny things these holes-in-one
golf. Walter Hagen lias only made
one, and Bobby Jones has only
made one, and that while playing
with Walter Hagen. Yet a compara
tively unknown English profession
al named Rowland Jones lias made
17! And that isn't, the, record!
Sandy Herd, famous veteran pro
of Moor Park, England, made his
eighteenth hole-in-one about a
month-and-a-lialf ago, and received
a solid gold putter as a reward. But
that isn't the record! "1 cannot tell
a lie," but Tom Washington, pro
at the Monomonock Inn course in
New Jersey, has made twenty-one
holes-in-one, and is thus the King
of all ace-makers of the world. In
1928 alone, Washington sank his
tee shot four times. Yet those two
English veterans, Harry Vardon
and John Ball, have only made a
couple between them in eighty
years of golf!

Last July Maurice Regimbal, a'
! nine-year-old Canadian boy, sank
his tee shot on a 125-yard hole at
North Bay, Out. But Sidney Colt
art, also nine years old, had made
an ace previous to that, at Valley
Forge, Pa. The oldest member of ,
this hole-in-one club that I have j
any record of is C. B. Kessing, 83, j
of Cincinnati, who scored an ace
on a 136-yard hole at the Hyde ;
Park course a few years ago.
