# CARDINAL BASEBALL TEAM OPENS 1930 SEASON SATURDAY
## 
### 
Heralded as the strongest Olym
pic Club team in years, the Winged
"O" baseball squad will journey
down to the Stanford campus Sat
urday afternoon to take on the
Card nine. The Club roster looks
like a banquet list of a college re
union and includes two former
Stanford stars.
Bud De Meyer, considered by
many critics as the best semi-pro
pitcher around the bay, will be on
the mound for the visitors with
either Wyatt or Dutch Thompson
011 the receiving end. Joe Collins,
reputedly a heavy wielder of the
willow, as well as a plenty nice
fielder, will hold down first base.
DAn Garibaldi, Stanford's second
baseman two years ago, will play
the keystone sack for the Post
Streeters, and is also a very handy
man with the bat. Wilson or Rohe
will bp on third, and Jimmy Busch,
shortstop and teammate of Gari
baldi for the Cards in 1928, will
strut his stuff in the short patch.
The outfield will be filled by
Maurice, former California player,
Smith, an erstwhile luminary of
St. Mary's, and Corpman, manager
of the Olympic outfit and formerly
of Syracuse University.
