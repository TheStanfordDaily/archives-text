# TRACK MEN TURN OUT IN FORCE AS RAINY DAYS PAUSE
## Outstanding Performances In Last Iwo Days Are Made in Weights 
### Ted Demotte 
For the first time in many days,
the Stanford trackmen were able
yesterday to work out at all the
events, both in track and field, and
Dink Templeton had a large turn
out. Even the vaulters and the high
jumpers were able to try a few
leaps, though the ground was a hit
slippery in spots.
Johns and Berry, upon whom
Templeton will pin his hopes in the
pole vault, this year, both showed
up well, though they did not at
tempt any great heights. Madison
was the outstanding performer in
the high jump. Dowell did not try
for distance in the broad jump,
i though he lias been clearing better j
than twenty-two feet about every ;
day. West and Butler look pretty
I good. ■
Morrison was striding some 220's, ,
j and said that his leg, which he in
jured at the 1.C.4-A. meet last year, !
was. feeling O.K. Hec Dyer, whose j
great weakness last year was.slow
starts in the dashes, was getting ,
out of his holes ahead of the bunch
| yesterday. Charley Paddock said
last winter that all Dyer needed to ,
become a champion was a fast j
start, and he seems to be develop-1
ing tliat. i
Fine Form in Weights
As usual, the outstanding per- >
formances the past two days have I
been in the weights. When Herb ;
\ Fleischacker and Harlow Rothert
come out for practice, Dink will j
! have live men who will probably ;
1 beat forty-seven feet in the shot. !
I Eric Krenz wound up his practice '
j yesterday with three puts of 48 j
feet 5 inches, 48 feet 7 inches, and i
48 feet. !) inches. He had tossed the '
shot better than 47 feet a score of j
: times. Day before yesterday, he j
finished discus practice with a j
throw of 145 feet. George Grey, '
1 sophomore weightman, got off a 1
nice toss of 133 feet at the same
practice. Dusty Allen was also
showing good form with the discus, j
seeming to experience little trouble ;
in staying in the ring.

the high jump. Dowell did not try
for distance in the broad jump,
i though he lias been clearing better j
than twenty-two feet about every ;
day. West and Butler look pretty
I good. ■
Morrison was striding some 220's, ,

jured at the 1.C.4-A. meet last year, !
was. feeling O.K. Hec Dyer, whose j
great weakness last year was.slow
starts in the dashes, was getting ,

Fine Form in Weights
As usual, the outstanding per- >
formances the past two days have I
been in the weights. When Herb ;
\ Fleischacker and Harlow Rothert
come out for practice, Dink will j
! have live men who will probably ;
1 beat forty-seven feet in the shot. !
I Eric Krenz wound up his practice '
j yesterday with three puts of 48 j
feet 5 inches, 48 feet 7 inches, and i
48 feet. !) inches. He had tossed the '
shot better than 47 feet a score of j
: times. Day before yesterday, he j
finished discus practice with a j
throw of 145 feet. George Grey, '
1 sophomore weightman, got off a 1
nice toss of 133 feet at the same
practice. Dusty Allen was also
showing good form with the discus, j
seeming to experience little trouble ;
in staying in the ring.
For the first time in many days,
the Stanford trackmen were able
yesterday to work out at all the
events, both in track and field, and
Dink Templeton had a large turn
out. Even the vaulters and the high
jumpers were able to try a few
leaps, though the ground was a hit
slippery in spots.
Johns and Berry, upon whom
Templeton will pin his hopes in the
pole vault, this year, both showed
up well, though they did not at
tempt any great heights. Madison
was the outstanding performer in
the high jump. Dowell did not try
for distance in the broad jump,
i though he lias been clearing better j
than twenty-two feet about every ;
day. West and Butler look pretty
