# HALL OF CARNEGIE EXPERIMENTS HERE ON PLANT GROWTH
## Institute Headquarters of Biology Situated On Campus

While Thomas Edison's direct at
tempt to find weeds or other use
less plants to yield rubber is in
teresting the world at this time,
quite different is the experimental
work on plants pursued by Dr. H.
M. Hall of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, located on the
Stanford campus.
This Investigator, while thor
oughly sympathetic with economic
studies, such as Edison's, is pri
marily concerned with the search
for laws underlying plant growth,
as a basis for their classification.
Plant Influences
"Some plants are classified in
the same species, whereas they
should be in Iwo or more different
species, or vice-versa, the differ
ence in the plant structure being
due sometimes to adaptation to cli
matic or soil conditions, sometimes
to fixed hereditary traits. Every
plant and animal is a product of
those two influences," stated Dr.
Hall to a Daily reporter.
Rather than gather up the frag
ments and put them together, Dr.
Hall and his colleagues, David D.
Keck and W. M. Heusi, are taking
certain plants, even the humble
tar-weed, and transplanting them
in diverse climatic and soil condi
tions, observing the variations in
structure of the plants in different
localities as they grow.
Process Scientific
"Strictly experimental is this
procedure, no guesswork whatever
being allowed. We take one plant,
divide its roots, or cuttings, into
teveral pieces and plant them in
localities ranging in altitude from
timber line, with 10,000 feet eleva
tion, to sea level," explained Dr.
Hall.
To expedite* these experiments,
the institution has established sta
tions at Mather, with an elevation
of 4500 feet; at Mono, with its
Great Basin climate; at San ford;
at Montara on the ocean; and a
station above timber line, where
plants may be set. out, and their
development watched. At each of
these places, except Montara,
plants are grown both in the shade
and sun, and at Mather in moist,
dry, and optimum shade and sun.
Tribute Paid
At the Stanford station, which is
the headquarters of the Carnegie
Institution's division of plant bio
logy, of which Dr. H. A. Spoehr
is chairman, the buildings, with
twenty acres of ground and hot
house of steel-frame construction
and automatic temperature control
were dedicated only last, summer.
That Stanford should be chosen
as a site for experimental work of
the institution is a tribute to the
Stanford Bontanical Department,
there being the most helpful co
operation between these two groups
of investigators.

the same species, whereas they
should be in Iwo or more different
species, or vice-versa, the differ
ence in the plant structure being
due sometimes to adaptation to cli
matic or soil conditions, sometimes
to fixed hereditary traits. Every
plant and animal is a product of
those two influences," stated Dr.
Hall to a Daily reporter.
Rather than gather up the frag
ments and put them together, Dr.
Hall and his colleagues, David D.
Keck and W. M. Heusi, are taking
certain plants, even the humble
tar-weed, and transplanting them
in diverse climatic and soil condi
tions, observing the variations in
structure of the plants in different
localities as they grow.
Process Scientific
"Strictly experimental is this
procedure, no guesswork whatever
being allowed. We take one plant,
divide its roots, or cuttings, into
teveral pieces and plant them in
localities ranging in altitude from
timber line, with 10,000 feet eleva
tion, to sea level," explained Dr.
Hall.
To expedite* these experiments,
the institution has established sta
tions at Mather, with an elevation
of 4500 feet; at Mono, with its
Great Basin climate; at San ford;
at Montara on the ocean; and a
station above timber line, where
plants may be set. out, and their
development watched. At each of
these places, except Montara,
plants are grown both in the shade
and sun, and at Mather in moist,
dry, and optimum shade and sun.

At the Stanford station, which is
the headquarters of the Carnegie
Institution's division of plant bio
logy, of which Dr. H. A. Spoehr
is chairman, the buildings, with
twenty acres of ground and hot
house of steel-frame construction
and automatic temperature control
were dedicated only last, summer.
That Stanford should be chosen
as a site for experimental work of
the institution is a tribute to the
Stanford Bontanical Department,
there being the most helpful co
operation between these two groups
of investigators.
While Thomas Edison's direct at
tempt to find weeds or other use
less plants to yield rubber is in
teresting the world at this time,
quite different is the experimental
work on plants pursued by Dr. H.
M. Hall of the Carnegie Institution
of Washington, located on the
Stanford campus.
This Investigator, while thor
oughly sympathetic with economic
studies, such as Edison's, is pri
marily concerned with the search
for laws underlying plant growth,
as a basis for their classification.
