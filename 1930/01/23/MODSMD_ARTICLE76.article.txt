Local interest, not in the paint
ings themselves but in their crea
tor, will be one of the most at
tractive features of the next ex
hibit. at the Thomas Welton Stan
ford Art Gallery, which opens Sun
day.
Graduating from Stanford in
1924, William ("Bill") Irwin, whose
paintings will be shown, is the son
of a well-known Stanford family—
Will Irwin, '98, nationally known
journalist and writer, is his father.
Hallie Hyde Irwin, '98, is his
mother, and Wallace Irwin, '00, his
uncle. The Irwin brothers are still
famous in campus "folklore."
Artistic blood runs in the family,
for Hallie Hyde Irwin was for a
long time prominent in the art cir
cles of San Francisco, and Helen
Hyde, Irwin's aunt, gained interna
tional recognition, before her death,
1 in the field of woodcuts done in
Japanese manner.
! Although Irwin graduated from
; the entomology department, he
I found time to take several art.
; courses under Professor Clark,
; Mrs. Storks, and Edward Palmer.
While in school he was a frequent
; contributor to Chaparral, and was
prominent in the technical end of
various stage activities.
After finishing here he attended
the California School of Arts and
Crafts for two years, and then went
to Paris for another two years of
study and travel. Since his excur
! sions, made mostly by bicycle, have
; taken him to many fascinating
; places not oply in Europe, but also
; in Africa, lfi« paintings, consisting
I of European landscapes, promise
to be intensely interesting.
