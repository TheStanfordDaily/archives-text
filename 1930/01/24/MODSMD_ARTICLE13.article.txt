About Carlo Goldoni, the fatli«r
i of Italian comedy, and author of
j "The Mistress of the Inn," the rol
, licking comedy to be given here
| on February 7 under Harold Hel
i venston, acting director of dra
matics, little has been written con
sidering his importance as a play
wright. But those who have writ
i ten of him have appreciated his
1 inestimable contribution to the de
j velopraent of the drama, recogniz*
i ing him as one of the finest flowers
of the Italian atmosphere and
: spirit.
Known among Italians, and par
j ticularly among the natives of his
! birthplace, Venice, as "dear Papa
| Goldoni," ' he is described by Ho
! hart C. Chat field-Taylor as "a kind
ly man of the merry century." Tay
i lor is the author of a life of Gol
doni which was published several
i years ago.
Had Genial Smile
Speaking of a statue of the great
playwright which stands in Venice
i he says:
"The smile on tlie round face
j beaming beneath the periwig and
| the three-cornered hat of this man
| of long ago is so genial that the
; most casual tourist will tarry to
I admire, even though the name
j 'Goldoni' on the base of the statue

| be meaningless to him."
Referring to his introduction to
the Italian stage of real human
beings instead of masked type !
characters, Voltaire has character-
I feed the author of "The Mistress
;of the Inn" as "the painter and i
son of nature." Indeed, Voltaire i
his struck the significant phase of
, Gbldoni's whole work; for in re-i
yilting against the established ,
I cAmmedia dell' arte, this great j
piiywright was making a step |
which would be felt all over Eu- l
rope.
Robert Browning, ever under- |
standing of Italy, has caught the !
| spirit of "dear Papa Goldoni" in
these lines:
I "Goldoni —good, gay, sunniest of
souls —
Glassing half Venice in that j
verse of thine ....
) There throng the people; how ;
they come and go,
Lisp the soft language, flaunt the
bright garb, see,
On piazza, calle, under portico i
and over bridge!"
And it is as the mirror of bright j
Venice, as well as the unconven- j
tional playwright, that Goldoni will !
live. His characters are the sim-'
])|e, direct people of gay, unpre- j
. tending Venice, so often exagger
| atcd or misinterpreted.
