# COWARDS VS. RECEIVERS OF STOLEN GOODS
## 
### 
In the Campus ()|>inion column of this newspaper today will he
found a communication from a Mr. F. 1). Woodhou.se, who objects
to the ' 'cowardly attitude of the Interfraternity Council as reported
editorially and in the news columns of Wednesday's issue."
One nf two things inspired Mr. Woodhouse's outburst, appar
ently. kit her he misinterpreted the action of the Council, or he is
woefully misinformed as to the situation which exists here in fresh
man-fraternity relations.
Mr. Woodhouse's first big point—that freshmen cannot initiate
illegal parties themselves—is too absurd to be seriously considered.
\nyone with a casual knowledge <»112 the situation would not for a
minute even consider such a possibility. The writer's second point,
however, deserves an answer.
"What defense does the poor freshman have who receives an
'illegal' invitation?" Mr. Woodhouse wants to know.
If Mr. Woodhonse had investigated even slightly before he took
his pen in hand, he would know that the Council's action was inspired
by the fact that hitherto freshmen have had no good excuse for
declining illicit invitations. Now that a penalty awaits the frosh
violator as well as his fniternity host, he has a valid reason for refus
ing, a reasoll "which will be respected by the fraternities. Further
more, the ( ouncil s action makes it so that no self-respecting Creek
letter organization will jeopardize a prospective rushee's welfare
by making him the target for such a penaltv.
It should be perfectly clear to anyone, who has put an iota of
thought into the matter, that the proposed rule of the Interfraternitv
Council will be effective because it strikes at both roots of the evil.
It makes illegal rushing unprofitable for both the houses and for the
112 reshmen.
Mr. Woodhouse's argument that the problem belongs wholly to
the (.1 recks is as valid as saying that a receiver of stolen goods is
not culpable.
A: testimony of his fairness and his (jualifi cat ions as a critic of
Stanford fraternity problems, Mr. Woodhouse declarers that he him
self has "traveled the road of one of the largest fraternal organiza-'
tions in the world." Judging from his analysis, one must conclude
that his travel on "the road" occurred as an initiate in the Knights
of ( olumbus or the Masonic Lodge-—or perhaps the Woodmen of
ihe World. All of these are fraternal organizations, and they are
large. Hut hardly would a knowledge of their problems and inner
workings give a person insight into college fraternities.
In spite of bombast of the Woodhouse variety, a strong sentiment
is growing on the campus for the passage of the rule proposed at a
meeting of representatives of the twenty four Stanford fraternities,
last Tuesday evening. To those who have a sincere desire to clean
up the whole trouble, no other course lies open.

Council will be effective because it strikes at both roots of the evil.

Mr. Woodhouse's argument that the problem belongs wholly to
the (.1 recks is as valid as saying that a receiver of stolen goods is
not culpable.
A: testimony of his fairness and his (jualifi cat ions as a critic of
Stanford fraternity problems, Mr. Woodhouse declarers that he him
self has "traveled the road of one of the largest fraternal organiza-'
tions in the world." Judging from his analysis, one must conclude
that his travel on "the road" occurred as an initiate in the Knights
of ( olumbus or the Masonic Lodge-—or perhaps the Woodmen of
ihe World. All of these are fraternal organizations, and they are
large. Hut hardly would a knowledge of their problems and inner
workings give a person insight into college fraternities.
In spite of bombast of the Woodhouse variety, a strong sentiment
is growing on the campus for the passage of the rule proposed at a
meeting of representatives of the twenty four Stanford fraternities,
last Tuesday evening. To those who have a sincere desire to clean
up the whole trouble, no other course lies open.

If Mr. Woodhonse had investigated even slightly before he took
his pen in hand, he would know that the Council's action was inspired
