Promotions are announced today for ihosc people who are to
direct the destinies of Volume 77. Already Volume 7() is beginning
to sink behind the inflamed horizon of a glorified past, or wherever

The names of Rawson Holmes, Willis Sullivan, William French,
and Leonard Kullman will henceforth be found in the copy editors'
