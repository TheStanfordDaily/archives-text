YOUR UNCLE DUDLEY—At the
Alcazar Theatre.
"Leave it to your Uncle Dudley"
is i lie by-word in that outrageously
shocking and amusing family of
grandmother, niece, nephew, and
sister that is making Uncle Dud
ley's life u nightmare when the
curtain rises.
This policy works very well, un
til the big-hearted, irresponsible
uncle falls in love Willi a beautiful
blonde from Denmark, and aston
ishingly takes a stand for his own
independence. He has a. big prob
lem: it is imperative that half of
his burdensome family be shipped
off to lOurope. Otherwise be cannot
marry. But this requires $5000,
and he hasn't even $f>oo. His chase
for the $5000 leads him into one
madly funny situation afier an
other with everything working
out in a final laugh that is almost
the best of all.
Taylor Holmes as Uncle Dudley
goes joyously through his part,
sometimes an artist, sometimes a
clown, but always charming, and
always sure of his audience.
In one scene, he is alone on the
stage for perhaps two minutes. He
has a new suit, and he is preening
himself; he strikes jaunty atti
tudes, and saunters around in a
glow of pleased egotism. With no
spoken lines, lie sustains a high
dramatic interest solely by his
adept pantomime, and his rare per
sonality. Here he is an artist.
And when he deliberately clowns
all over ihe stage, the audience
still likes him. Taylor Holmes lias
a quality of magnetism ihat leaps
over the footlights and captures
everyone, from the front row in
the orchestra, to the last row in
the gallery—and is a license even
for the most brazenly slapstick
humor.
Flora Bramley as the ingenue is
an exquisite little. thing with a
fragile blonde prettiness that

makes her appealing even when
she is nothing but a sweet helpless
iuinl> being browbeaten by her
mother. This mother is necessarily
a horrible creature but a very ex
cellent actress, nevertheless. The
grandmother of the play is an out
rageous old lady that any nice fam
ily would keep out in the kitchen.
Her complete lack of elegance fur
nishes half the laughs of the play.
"Your Uncle Dudley" is un
ashamedly lowbrow, tint you will
like it. An exuberance, a spontane
ous energy fills every scene. The
uninhibited spirit of the play takes
hold of the spectator ;it the start,
to such a degree that all its clamor
ously jumbled effect, and its im
, possible rowdiness, and its unrea
sonable mix-ups seem thoroughly
splendid entertainment,

UNTAMED—At the Varsity.

"Not so good," from one.
"Ii hough! it was great," from
another.
And so, we graphically and bril
liantly predict the reactions to
"Untamed." Personally, we recom
mend il highly. Mainly, because
of Joan Crawford. Ilusky-voiced,
persuasive, appealing, and better
to look at than ever, she plays with
unquestionable personality. Her
part is one of a jungle-bred beauty
plunged into New York society.
There is less of the fiery, wildcat
stuff than one might expect, and
the developments are amusing and
engrossing.
Noble support is furnished by
Ernest Torrence and Robert Mont
gomery. Torrence's brogue is a
treat in itself, as well as the way
he uses it. The dialogue is clever,
especially between Montgomery
and Miss Crawford. And don't miss
the scene on the garden seat when
ihey are discussing their marriage.
