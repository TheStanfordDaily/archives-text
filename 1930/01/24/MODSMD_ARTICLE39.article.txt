## HE PLACES BLAME ON FRATERNITIES 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Grant me the privilege of ex
pressing my reaction to the cow
ardly attitude of the Interfraternity
Council as reported editorially and
in the news columns of Wednes
day's issue. To try to blame the
freshmen for the self-confessed
rottenness of the Stanford fraterni
ties is like stabbing a man in the
back.
In (he first place, what chance
would a freshman or a group of
freshmen have to initiate an "ille
gal party"? Such actions on the
part of any freshman, short of a
millionaire's son, would kill his
chances, then .and there. In tin-*
second place, what defense does
the poor freshman, who receives an
"illegal" invitation, have? If he
turns down the invitation lie marks
himself as a poor sport in the eyes
of the group giving the invitation,
and kills his chances. If he goes,
some other Creek may see him,
and again lie is out of luck.
On Ihe other hand, if he were so
audacious as to report the party

giving the bid, the chances are
even that he would be black-listed
by the whole Row; whereas some
other Greek house than the one
giving tlie bid can report him it'
he accepts, and, being an estab
lished institution, instead of a mere
individual, laugh at his chagrin.
If there were no illegal invita-*
tions, there could be no illegal ac
ceptances on the part of the fresh
men. "If a house dares to risk its
chances of pledging and its bid is
accepted by a freshman," that
HOUSE "is comparable to a sneak,
a violator of convention and de
spicable in all that stands for ihe
desciption Stanford Gentlemen."
The blame must be put fairly
and squarely where it. belongs, on
the fraternities, and on them alone.
I repeat, for them to punish the
freshmen for the results of their
own rottenness is abject cowardice.
Having myself traveled the road
of one of the largest fraternal or
ganizations in the world, I speak
without personal prejudice.

The Editor, Sir:
Grant me the privilege of ex
pressing my reaction to the cow
ardly attitude of the Interfraternity
Council as reported editorially and
in the news columns of Wednes
day's issue. To try to blame the
freshmen for the self-confessed
rottenness of the Stanford fraterni
ties is like stabbing a man in the
back.
In (he first place, what chance
would a freshman or a group of
freshmen have to initiate an "ille
gal party"? Such actions on the
part of any freshman, short of a
millionaire's son, would kill his
chances, then .and there. In tin-*
second place, what defense does
the poor freshman, who receives an
"illegal" invitation, have? If he
turns down the invitation lie marks
himself as a poor sport in the eyes
of the group giving the invitation,
and kills his chances. If he goes,
some other Creek may see him,
and again lie is out of luck.
On Ihe other hand, if he were so
audacious as to report the party

giving the bid, the chances are
even that he would be black-listed
by the whole Row; whereas some
other Greek house than the one
giving tlie bid can report him it'
he accepts, and, being an estab
lished institution, instead of a mere
individual, laugh at his chagrin.
If there were no illegal invita-*
tions, there could be no illegal ac
ceptances on the part of the fresh
men. "If a house dares to risk its
chances of pledging and its bid is
accepted by a freshman," that
HOUSE "is comparable to a sneak,
a violator of convention and de
spicable in all that stands for ihe
desciption Stanford Gentlemen."
The blame must be put fairly
and squarely where it. belongs, on
the fraternities, and on them alone.
I repeat, for them to punish the
freshmen for the results of their
own rottenness is abject cowardice.
Having myself traveled the road
of one of the largest fraternal or
ganizations in the world, I speak
without personal prejudice.
