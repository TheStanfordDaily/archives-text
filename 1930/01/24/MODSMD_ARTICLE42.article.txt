In 1920 t here were 122,01!! law
yers in the United States or lit!
lawyers to each 100,000 population.
The proportion in California is
much higher, being close to MO per
100,000 population, according to an
estimate made in 1929. The median
annual salary of succesful lawyers,
as determined from a grouping of
three statistical studies, ranges
from $6,000 to $7,000.
The lawyer holds a peculiar posi
tion as "an officer of the court."
He is sworn to defend justice and
is an agent id' the State. The ethics
of his profession do not allow him
to advertise, and in England he
cannot sue for his fees. A second
unique quality of law lies in the
close relationship between law and
business. Many business men must
be lawyers, and most lawyers
should know business.
17G Law Schools
There are 170 degree-conferring
law schools in the United States
i (1927) of which slightly less than
i two-thirds are connected with col
i leges and universities. Of these,
only 70 are full-time institutions.
Fifty-six of this group demand five
academic years (two in college
and three in law school) and a
more selective group of 14 require
1 six or more college years. Stanford
is of this group, requiring college
graduation and three years of law.
In addition, Stanford offers three
more years of elective work be
yond the three years' graduate
work required to gain a degree;
this is more law work than is of
! fered by any of the six full-time
and 12 evening law schools in Cali
fornia (1927).
Most law schools follow the Har
vard plan of offering an LL.B. de

' give, ordinarily requiring college
graduation, although 30 schools of
fer an equivalent J.l>. degree. At
Stanford, for all students entering
hereafter, the J. 13. degree is a sec
ond degree, requiring 32 units of
work more than the L.L.B. and a
I thesis.
j Each state has its own bar ex
| animation* The American Bar As
sociation recommended in 11)21 and
in 11)29 that admission to the state
{ bar examination require a mini
mum of two years of college and
graduation from a three-year law
school. To date 14 states have ap
proached this minimum, but in
other states requirements vary.
Education Is Advantage
California requires three years
in the study of law and the passing
of the written examination of the
Committee of Bar Examiners of the
: California State Bar. The advan
-1 tage of an academic background is
obvious from the Commit tee's re
, port for the February and July
1929 examinations. This showed
that only 1 V/c of the applicants
with no high school education
passed, 38% of those with less
than two years of high school, and
81'/ of those with A.B. or B.S.
degrees.
The personal qualities demanded
by the profession are many. An
analytical and orderly mind (to be
possessed or trained), courage to
face any issue, and good judgment
are essential qualities. The much
heralded feature of ability as a
public speaker is a valuable asset
but not an absolute necessity. The
rigor and keen competition of the
professional training and appren
ticeship periods should be supple
mented by a wide sweep of knowl
edge and culture for one to become
an outstanding attorney.
