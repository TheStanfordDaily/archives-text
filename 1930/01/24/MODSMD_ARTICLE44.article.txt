# Bears, Cards Ready For First Cage Tilt
## CELLAR POSITION OF P.C.C. DECIDED TOMORROW NIGHT Captain Rothert to Start At Center Despite an Infected Toe 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Battling to climb out of the Con
ference! cellar ami, at the same
time, to defeat their Berkeley ri
vals for the lirst time in five long
years, Coach Husky Hunt's varsity
basket hall five will tangle with the
California Hears tomorrow night at
8 o'clock on the hardwood of the
Farm Pavilion.
With Captain Harlow Itothert
definitely scheduled to start at cen
ter, the Cards will take the floor
on even terms with the Bear quin
tet. However, the Farm leader is
not in the best of shape, as he is
still bothered with an Infected toe,
and it is doubtful whether he can
last long if the going gets at all
rough. And if past games mean
anything, there will be no tea party
when the ancient foes start mixing
it up on the court.
Bears Due
Although Stanford has a slight
edge when it comes to material,
Nibs Price's squad has been im
proving steadily during the past
few weeks and is due to have a
good night against the Cards. The
B( ars made a good showing in the
IT.C.L.A. tilt last Saturday, al
though they were nosed out by
three points, and more recently dis
played championship caliber in
downing St. Mary's.
Only lack of experience and some
poor substitutions lost the Bruin
game for the Pricemen. After pil
ing up a 22 to 11 point lead at half
time, the Bear defense suffered a
relapse while the offensive depart
ment was held to a single tally.
The Saint tilt proved that U.C. has
profited greatly by the Bruin upset,
as the Bears were most successful
mi warding off a last-minute rally
by th«- uncanny Moraga sharp
shooters.
Hunt Optimistic
On the other hand, Coach Hunt
is looking for his charges to snap
out of it tomorrow night, and play
Hie brand of ball of which they are
capable. If the Cards can regain
the form displayed in the Pacific
game, when McCandless and com
pany broke through the Tiger de
fense to loop in 55 points, Ihe Farm
live should have no trouble in mak
ing good Hunt's most cherished
liop<- his first win over Cal since
way back in 1925.
Willi the exception of Rothert,
all of the Cards are in line fettle
for tomorrow's hectic fracas. Don
Tyler lias shaken off his cold and
hould locate, the basket a number
< I times before the evening is over.
Following are the tentative start
ing lineups for the initial Big Came
of 1930:
California — Stanford —

ment was held to a single tally.
The Saint tilt proved that U.C. has
profited greatly by the Bruin upset,
as the Bears were most successful
mi warding off a last-minute rally
by th«- uncanny Moraga sharp
shooters.
Hunt Optimistic
On the other hand, Coach Hunt
is looking for his charges to snap
out of it tomorrow night, and play
Hie brand of ball of which they are
capable. If the Cards can regain
the form displayed in the Pacific
game, when McCandless and com
pany broke through the Tiger de
fense to loop in 55 points, Ihe Farm
live should have no trouble in mak
ing good Hunt's most cherished
liop<- his first win over Cal since
way back in 1925.
Willi the exception of Rothert,
all of the Cards are in line fettle
for tomorrow's hectic fracas. Don
Tyler lias shaken off his cold and
hould locate, the basket a number
< I times before the evening is over.
Following are the tentative start
ing lineups for the initial Big Came
of 1930:
California — Stanford —
Tripp F Fawcett
Pursel F Tyler
Ten Kyck (' Rothert
Vendt O McCandless
Davis G Rowley
Battling to climb out of the Con
ference! cellar ami, at the same
time, to defeat their Berkeley ri
vals for the lirst time in five long
years, Coach Husky Hunt's varsity
basket hall five will tangle with the
California Hears tomorrow night at
8 o'clock on the hardwood of the
Farm Pavilion.
With Captain Harlow Itothert
definitely scheduled to start at cen
ter, the Cards will take the floor
on even terms with the Bear quin
tet. However, the Farm leader is
not in the best of shape, as he is
still bothered with an Infected toe,
and it is doubtful whether he can
last long if the going gets at all
rough. And if past games mean
anything, there will be no tea party
when the ancient foes start mixing
it up on the court.
Bears Due
Although Stanford has a slight
edge when it comes to material,
Nibs Price's squad has been im
proving steadily during the past
few weeks and is due to have a
good night against the Cards. The
B( ars made a good showing in the
IT.C.L.A. tilt last Saturday, al
though they were nosed out by
three points, and more recently dis
played championship caliber in
downing St. Mary's.
Only lack of experience and some
poor substitutions lost the Bruin
game for the Pricemen. After pil
ing up a 22 to 11 point lead at half
time, the Bear defense suffered a
relapse while the offensive depart
ment was held to a single tally.
