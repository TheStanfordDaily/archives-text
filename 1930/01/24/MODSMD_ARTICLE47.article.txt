# CONSIDER THE 1930 PHILLIES
## 
### Feg Murray '16 
Consider the Phillies, how they j
i grow; they toil not, neither do they j
I win pennants . . . but how they do
j sock the old horsehide! Yessir,
| those lowly Phils, for years the
j laughing stock of the National
j League, not only led all other
teams in the circuit for 1929, as
far as club batting and slugging
percentage (driving in runs) is
concerned, but also they finished
the season in better than sixth
place for the first year since 1917.
Talk about your long years of 1
drought! The lean years, Ihe years
of famine, experienced by that
other Philadelphia team, the At.li
j letics, were a mere breathing space
compared to that strange interlude
between first-division feasts for the
J Phillies. Would that .Manager Shot
i ton's boys had a Moses Grove to
i lead them out of the wilderness
j and into the promised land of pen
jnants!
The Athletics were in last place
I for seven straight years, then lin-

I ished seventh, sixth, and fifth be- (
! fore they jumped to second place
| in 1925. The Phillies won a pen
nant. last in 1915, were second in
1916 and '17, then finished last,
seven times in the next eleven
years, seventh twice, and sixth
twice. Last year they finished fifth,
batted .309 as a team, and made
more hits and home runs than any
other National League outfit! The
Phillies also led in slugging, with
a percentage of .467.
Now, as everybody knows, what
' the Phillies need more than any
thing else, is good pitching. The
fans of Quakertown got a real
thrill at the announcement that,
that Old Master, Grover Cleveland
Alexander, was coming back to end
his glorious baseball career with
the team he started with nineteen
years ago. But Alex will be forty
three in February, and, while a
change of scenery may pep him up
for a time, he can't have many
more victories left in that old
j sotipbone of his. To get. Alex, Man

( ager Shotton had to give up Pitcher
j Bob McGraw and Outfielder Homer
! Peel, but he also got Harry Mc
; Curdy, a hard-hitting catcher. Mc
| Curdy will take the place of Wal
j ter Lerian who was killed in an
; accident. Shotton feels that Alex,
I in a relief role, will save a lot of
| games, when erratic hurlers start
i to give in to rival batsmen along
! about the seventh inning, and he's

probably right.
Hi Lefty O'Doul and Chuck Klein
the Phillies have two of the hard
est hitters in either league, both
of whom were once tagged as
"X.G." by well-known scouts or
managers. Lefty batted .398 to win
the hitting championship of the
circuit, while Klein's 4:; home runs
surpassed Hornsby's National
League record.
