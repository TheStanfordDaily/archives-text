Freshman baseball aspirants have
put in several days of practice this
week and are prepared to play a
game sometime soon, provided a suit
able opponent can be secured, accord
ing to Coach Murray Cuddeback. The
schedule for the season lias not yet

in arranging games with high school
nines.

Hollywood, has been showing up like
a veteran in the box so far, and is
certain to pitch many innings for the
1933 outfit. Bill Triplett, who hails
from Spokane, Washington, lias been
turning in a snappy performance at
