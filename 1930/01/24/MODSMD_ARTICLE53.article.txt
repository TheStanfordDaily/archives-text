## NO RUNS, NO HITS, NO ERRORS

Willi a season's outlook as
gloomy as the recent oozing skies,
Stanford's 1930 baseball varsity
will trot out in tlie Farm's old ball
I>ui k tomorrow after lunch to cross
bats wit it a highly touted Olympic
Club nine in its first, public appear
ance.
Not only does Coach Harry
Meiggs Wolter look forward to
this opening game with pessi
mism, but he fails to wax en
thusiastically over his ball
club's chances during the rest
of the schedule, which is com
posed of twenty-two tough en
gagements.
The Olympic tossers should beat
the local lads easily enough, as the
Club outfit boasts a lineup of vet
eran ex-collegians. There's not a
man among them that can't peg
the ball around the field with the
greatest of accuracy and clout the
old apple far beyond the outer gar
dens.
Besides those who learned
their fundamentals in the na
tional pastime and how to keep
from swallowing a cud of to
bacco when slamming out home
runs at such institutions as St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, there
are several Farm-developed
players on the Winged O team.
Jim Busch and Don Garibaldi,
as neat a pair of infielders that
ever donned baseball togs for
Stanford U., will show the
home boys a few tricks in
handling hot grounders at
shortstop and second base re
spectively.
However, Mr. H. M. Wolter isn't
going to shed tears if his under
studies come out second best to
morrow. What really worries him
is how the Cardinal nine will stack
np against Cal, St.. Marys, I'.S.C.,
and the other Conference teams
later on in the season.
Cal, for one, is going to have an
experienced and hefty hitting ball
club, even though it loses that pre
mier coach, Mr. Carl Zamloch, who
lias had a habit, of turning out nines
to trounce the Cards as long as
the present generation can remem
ber. The other Conference teams
are not going to be softies in any
sense of the word.
To date Mr. H. M. Wolter has
had all kinds of troubles to
harrass him, and to handicap
his rounding up a presentable
club of players. The weather,
of course, has been griping.
The local ball park has been
a much more fitting place for
swimming lessons than base
ball practice during the past
month. The players have spent
most of their time in the few
workouts that have been held
between showers diving for
lost balls in the many pools
and good-sized lakes.
The pitchers are likely to be
most erratic —that is, what ball
tossers there are to be classed as
varsity chuekers. Only one man
from last year's nine, Perry Tay
lor, is back for mound duty. And
last, year this Taylor person was
so wild at times that he popped off
players in the dugout. The spec
tators ducked and the batters
prayed that lliey would only be
hit on the legs or arms, whenever
Taylor began winding up his
gorilla-like arms.
Yet, if this veteran chucker
has improved as much in pitch
ing since last season, as he has
in pigskin-passing during the
past gridiron campaign, he
should be a great asset to the
Cards, and the pride and joy
of Mr. H. M. Wolter.
The other mound prospects are
only average, though Don Story
lias possibilities of becoming a
strikeout artist, while Leverenz,
McGarry, Itickleffs, or Spencer
may develop with unexpected rap
idity.
The remainder of the team, re
ceivers and fielders, balances up in
good style. In fact, Mr. H. M. Wol
ter has several combinations that
can snag (lies, capture grounders,
and connect with curves. Stanford
won't, be entirely a team of No
Runs, No Hits, No Errors. And if
the pitchers come through, the
Cards ought to chalk up their
share of wins.
At any rate, the outlook is
far from filled with sunshine.
Which may be a blessing in

disguise. A team can't be
counted out on paper alone.
Nor made either, for that mat
ter. Look at the basketball
squad. Doped as a world-beater
before the season, Mr. Husky
Hunt's cagers are now wallow
ing around in the Conference
cellar. The student body is be
hind Mr. H. M. VVolter to re
verse the situation, and is look
ing forward to cracking pea
nuts in the stands while his
players crack out runs on the
diamond.

The remainder of the team, re

Willi a season's outlook as
gloomy as the recent oozing skies,
Stanford's 1930 baseball varsity
will trot out in tlie Farm's old ball
I>ui k tomorrow after lunch to cross
bats wit it a highly touted Olympic
Club nine in its first, public appear
ance.
Not only does Coach Harry
Meiggs Wolter look forward to
this opening game with pessi
mism, but he fails to wax en
thusiastically over his ball
club's chances during the rest
of the schedule, which is com
posed of twenty-two tough en
gagements.
The Olympic tossers should beat
the local lads easily enough, as the
Club outfit boasts a lineup of vet
eran ex-collegians. There's not a
man among them that can't peg
the ball around the field with the
greatest of accuracy and clout the
old apple far beyond the outer gar
dens.
Besides those who learned
their fundamentals in the na
tional pastime and how to keep
from swallowing a cud of to
bacco when slamming out home
runs at such institutions as St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, there
are several Farm-developed
players on the Winged O team.
Jim Busch and Don Garibaldi,
as neat a pair of infielders that
ever donned baseball togs for
Stanford U., will show the
home boys a few tricks in
handling hot grounders at
shortstop and second base re
spectively.
However, Mr. H. M. Wolter isn't
going to shed tears if his under
studies come out second best to
morrow. What really worries him
is how the Cardinal nine will stack
np against Cal, St.. Marys, I'.S.C.,
and the other Conference teams
later on in the season.
Cal, for one, is going to have an
experienced and hefty hitting ball
club, even though it loses that pre
mier coach, Mr. Carl Zamloch, who
lias had a habit, of turning out nines
to trounce the Cards as long as
the present generation can remem
ber. The other Conference teams
are not going to be softies in any
sense of the word.
To date Mr. H. M. Wolter has
had all kinds of troubles to
harrass him, and to handicap
his rounding up a presentable
club of players. The weather,
of course, has been griping.
The local ball park has been
a much more fitting place for
swimming lessons than base
ball practice during the past
month. The players have spent
most of their time in the few
workouts that have been held
between showers diving for
lost balls in the many pools
and good-sized lakes.
The pitchers are likely to be
most erratic —that is, what ball
tossers there are to be classed as
varsity chuekers. Only one man
from last year's nine, Perry Tay
lor, is back for mound duty. And
last, year this Taylor person was
so wild at times that he popped off
players in the dugout. The spec
tators ducked and the batters
prayed that lliey would only be
hit on the legs or arms, whenever
Taylor began winding up his
gorilla-like arms.
Yet, if this veteran chucker
has improved as much in pitch
ing since last season, as he has
in pigskin-passing during the
past gridiron campaign, he
should be a great asset to the
Cards, and the pride and joy
of Mr. H. M. Wolter.

his rounding up a presentable
club of players. The weather,
of course, has been griping.
The local ball park has been
a much more fitting place for
swimming lessons than base
ball practice during the past
month. The players have spent
most of their time in the few
workouts that have been held
between showers diving for
lost balls in the many pools
and good-sized lakes.
The pitchers are likely to be
most erratic —that is, what ball
tossers there are to be classed as
varsity chuekers. Only one man
from last year's nine, Perry Tay
lor, is back for mound duty. And
last, year this Taylor person was
so wild at times that he popped off
players in the dugout. The spec
tators ducked and the batters
prayed that lliey would only be
hit on the legs or arms, whenever
Taylor began winding up his
gorilla-like arms.
Yet, if this veteran chucker
has improved as much in pitch
ing since last season, as he has
in pigskin-passing during the
past gridiron campaign, he
should be a great asset to the
Cards, and the pride and joy
of Mr. H. M. Wolter.
The other mound prospects are
only average, though Don Story
lias possibilities of becoming a
strikeout artist, while Leverenz,
McGarry, Itickleffs, or Spencer
may develop with unexpected rap
idity.
The remainder of the team, re
ceivers and fielders, balances up in
good style. In fact, Mr. H. M. Wol
ter has several combinations that
can snag (lies, capture grounders,
and connect with curves. Stanford
won't, be entirely a team of No
Runs, No Hits, No Errors. And if
the pitchers come through, the
Cards ought to chalk up their
share of wins.
At any rate, the outlook is
far from filled with sunshine.
Which may be a blessing in

disguise. A team can't be
counted out on paper alone.
Nor made either, for that mat
ter. Look at the basketball
squad. Doped as a world-beater
before the season, Mr. Husky
Hunt's cagers are now wallow
ing around in the Conference
cellar. The student body is be
hind Mr. H. M. VVolter to re
verse the situation, and is look
ing forward to cracking pea
nuts in the stands while his
players crack out runs on the
diamond.

Willi a season's outlook as
gloomy as the recent oozing skies,
Stanford's 1930 baseball varsity
will trot out in tlie Farm's old ball
I>ui k tomorrow after lunch to cross
bats wit it a highly touted Olympic
Club nine in its first, public appear
ance.
Not only does Coach Harry
Meiggs Wolter look forward to
this opening game with pessi
mism, but he fails to wax en
thusiastically over his ball
club's chances during the rest
of the schedule, which is com
posed of twenty-two tough en
gagements.
The Olympic tossers should beat
the local lads easily enough, as the
Club outfit boasts a lineup of vet
eran ex-collegians. There's not a
man among them that can't peg
the ball around the field with the
greatest of accuracy and clout the
old apple far beyond the outer gar
dens.
Besides those who learned
their fundamentals in the na
tional pastime and how to keep
from swallowing a cud of to
bacco when slamming out home
runs at such institutions as St.
Mary's and Santa Clara, there
are several Farm-developed
players on the Winged O team.
Jim Busch and Don Garibaldi,
as neat a pair of infielders that
ever donned baseball togs for
Stanford U., will show the
home boys a few tricks in
handling hot grounders at
shortstop and second base re
spectively.
However, Mr. H. M. Wolter isn't
going to shed tears if his under
studies come out second best to
morrow. What really worries him
is how the Cardinal nine will stack
np against Cal, St.. Marys, I'.S.C.,
and the other Conference teams
later on in the season.
Cal, for one, is going to have an
experienced and hefty hitting ball
club, even though it loses that pre
mier coach, Mr. Carl Zamloch, who
lias had a habit, of turning out nines
to trounce the Cards as long as
the present generation can remem
ber. The other Conference teams
are not going to be softies in any
sense of the word.
