# CARDS OPEN BALL SEASON TOMORROW AGAINST OLYMPICS
## 
### 
When Perry Taylor hurls the little
white pellet down the line to- the
home plate at 2:30 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon, Stanford's 1930 baseball
season will be under way. The Red
shirts' opening appearance will be
against the Olympic Club's highly
touted nine with Hud De Meyer on
the mound for fhe visitors.
The Card lineup lias only three
new names ; all the rest of the boys
are regulars with one and two years
of experience. Hill Marks of last
year's trosh will play first base, Kelly
will be out in the center pasture, and
Glen Tucker will patrol the right
field.
The Post Street outfit is heralded
as the best team the club has pro
duced in some years, and should be
able to win rather easily. Jimmy
Busch and Don Garibaldi, former
Stanford stars, will play short and
second respectively for the Winged
"0." In addition to Garibaldi and
Busch, the Olympic Club boasts a
Stanford man as manager, "Lex"
Klirman, who was manager of the
Card varsity last year. Klirman grad
uated last spring, and at present is
employed in a stock and bond house
in San Francisco.
