The Pipe
ev( j \ hk lps you say
nothing at all . •
YOU'VE noticed how expressive
the pipe can he, what meaning
it can put into the simplest gesture.
The pipe even helps you say nothing
at all—and that, O mortal, takes
a man among men !
Men to their pipes and women
to their lipsticks—but suppose you
had no pipe and faced repression?
Suppose you had no tobacco to put
in your pipe! Empty pipes make
empty gestures that have no mean
ing. Filled with good tobacco, your
pipe becomes eloquent. Filled with
Edgeworth, it is Olympian!
What, no Edgeworth? Lose not
a moment—haste to the mails with
the coupon. Let the machinery of
government rush to you a free
packet of good old Edgeworth,
delicious and friendly Edgeworth,
full flavored, slow-burning, cool.
