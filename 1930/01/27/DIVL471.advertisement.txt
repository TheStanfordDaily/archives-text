u slo.oo for a Slogan"
When we recently ran an advertisement, captioned as above,
we could not foresee the heavy response which has resulted
therefrom nor that so many would submit suggestions by phone
that it would constitute a handicap.
We consequently wish to state that hereafter only ideas received
by mail will be considered.
If you have not sent in your "Fill 'er Up" slogan, do so at once
as award will be made to the first one who hits upon the catch
phrase which best fits our need.
