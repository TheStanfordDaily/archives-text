SEATTLE, Jan. 20. (JP) â€” On an
island of ice in a lagoon near the
coast of Siberia, 90 miles east of
North Cape, two fliers yesterday
found the scattered wreckage of
the airplane of Carl Ben Eielson
and his mechanic, Earl Borland,
missing since November 9.
The craft had fallen, apparently
from a high altitude. The motor
had been torn from the fuselage
and hurled more than 100 feet from
the ship, the right wing was de
molished, and the tail was torn off.
A search of the deep snow, which
was drifted over the wreckage, re
vealed no trace of the fliers' bodies.
Pilots Joe Crosson and Harold
Gillam, who made the discovery,
said the men must have been
killed at. the moment of impact.
Details of the find were com
municated to the Seattle Times to
day in radio messages from Marion
Swenson, marooned on the fur
trading ship, Nanuk, at North
Cape. Eielson and Borland left Tel-
It r, Alaska. Nov. It, for North Cape
to transport passengers and furs
from the Nanuk to Nome. They
were never seen again.
