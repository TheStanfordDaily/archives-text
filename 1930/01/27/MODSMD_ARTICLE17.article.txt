Intimately connected with avia
tion for the past 17 years, Lieuten
ant Norman A. Goddard, U.S.N.it.,
was one of the outstanding flyers
in the State of California. His fast
biplane was a consistent winner in
all meets on the coast, and its pilot
was even better known.
Goddard had had a varied ex
perience in the occupation -which
yesterday cost him his life, having
flown under two flags and in sev
eral countries. During the World
War he fought for Great Britain in
the flying service. After the war
Goddard dropped aviation for a
time, but later did some flying in
Canada. For four years he taught
aviators in the United States Naval
Reserve at San Diego.
Dole Flight
Lieutenant Goddard first attract
ed notice in northern California
when he entered the ill-fated Dole
flight to Hawaii in 1!)2K. His ship,
El Encanto, cracked up on the
take-off at Oakland with Goddard's
navigator at the controls. Of those
that did get off only two reached
their goal.
In the fall of 192ti Goddard de
cided to establish a school of avia
tion in Palo Alto, and this plan
was carried out in January liâ™¦ 27
when tlie school of which he was
director until yesterday was estab
lished here. During tlie three years
of its existence the local school lias
turned out 2!) pilots.
Goddard's last activity was the
organization of the Stanford Glider
Club and construction of a glider.
He made several flights from the
Palo Alto airport in the glider.
