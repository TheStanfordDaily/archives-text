# IRWIN EXHIBIT OF PAINTINGS EXCELS IN LANDSCAPE ART
## 
### 
Landscape, rather than portrai
ture, is no doubt the field in which
William Hyde Irwin, '24. whose
paintings are now on exhibit, at
the* Thomas Welton Stanford Art
Gallery, finds best, expression of
his artistic ability. Versatility in
the use of medium is also notable,
for Mr. Irwin is showing several
dry-point etchings, as well as water
colors and oil paintings.
Traveling throughout Europe
and touching the north coast of
Africa has given ample subject
matter for landscape work, and
Mr. Irwin depicts with some skill
charming views of Tunis, Brittany,
and France. Preferable are his
renditions of the secluded old vil
lage of Uzerche, and oL' Granada.
Street scenes in Tunis, showing
the lovely contrast of blue sky and
colorful buildings are also well
done.
Mr. Irwin's water colors, though
not flashy, seem inexpressibly gay,
but his small oil sketches are per
haps the most delightful. There
seems to be a cheerfulness, if such
can be expressed on canvas, and a
lightness to his smaller paintings
that few of his larger canvases re
flect. On the whole, his exhibit is
interesting and worthwhile.
