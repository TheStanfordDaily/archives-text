# GODDARD PLUNGES TO DEATH
## VETERAN AVIATOR KILLED IN 3000 FOOT FALL WHEN GLIDER WINGS COLLAPSE Frail Craft Goes Into Whip-Stall as Goddard Attempts Loop; Metal Pin Holds Flyer to Seat, Prevents Use of Parachute Until Too Late to Open 
### 
PIONEERING in aviation look another life yesterday when Norman A.
| Goddard, head of the Palo Alto School of Aviation, plunged to his
| death into the Oakland Estuary while attempting lo break ihe existing
j glider loop record.
Death came after a sensational 3,000-foot fall. Goddard's glider col
lapsed, tlie wings crumbling,. shortly after the frail craft had been
released from a towing airplane.
A slender metal pin was the only difference between life and death,
I investigations revealed last night. Strapped to his precarious seat while
| the glider fell through space, Goddard failed to release the belt pin

in time to safe his life by para
chute.
Leaves Palo Alto
Goddard left Palo Alto about one
o'clock, towed by a Waco training
plane with Leo P. Root as pilot,
heyding for the Alameda airport.
About .*5,200 feet over the field, the
glider was cut loose and dove for
the first loop. Pailing to complete
the turn, the craft whip-stalled, and
both wings collapsed. Not until he
was about 2-~i feet from the water
could Goddard free himself from
the seat, when it was too late for
the parachute to open.
"It was the construction of the
plane, not the handling," Hoot said
after tlu> crash. Root, accompanied
by J. I). Herman, Paramount News
cameraman, watched the accident
from the towing plane nearby. Her
man stopped photographing when
the glider crumpled, Root said.
Rigidly Built
The glider was of especially rigid
construction, built by Goddard at.
the Palo Alto School of Aviation,
with a 40-foot wingspread of
Clark-Y curve. It was brought here
last, night.
Goddard hoped to break the ex
isting record of ten loops, it was
learned last night. Plans for the
future of the. school were not
known. Funeral arrangements will
be planned today. Mrs. Goddard
was in Los Angeles yesterday.
