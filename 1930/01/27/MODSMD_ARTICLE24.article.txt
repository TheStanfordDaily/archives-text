# AVIATION SCHOOL FOUNDED IN 1927
## Palo Alto Flying School Is First Of Its Type 
### 
I The Palo Alto School of Avia
j lion was founded by the late Lieu
j tenant Norman A. Goddard in
I January 1027, to provide Stanford
j students and outsiders interested
aviation an opportunity to get
! into the flying game at a compara
i tively reasonable expenditure.
It was the first institution of its
j type in the country to be estab
j lished in such close proximity to a
I university. But, although it was
I founded on the campus and with
| the approval of the Board of Trus
j tees, it was not officially connected
j with the University.
Goddard Instructs
Instruction at the new school be
l gan on February Oth under Lieu
j tenant Goddard and Lieutenant \V.
i H. Brown, who had been a British
I flying ace during the World War.
j Three Waco biplanes, including
I the El Encanto, which Goddard had
| entered in the Dole race to Hono
{ lulu during the summer of lH2t!,
constituted the flying equipment of
the school. Students were enrolled
for a three months' course at the
tuition fee of $300.
Equipped with a 60x80 steel
hangar, large enough to house eight
planes, and a 2400-foot runway, it
afforded Palo Alto a much-needed
airport. Its value as a landing field
was shown very clearly last fall,
when what is said to have been the
largest concentration of airships on
any field at one time that has ever
occurred, namely the hundred-odd
planes here on the day of the Stan
ford-University of Southern Cali
fornia football game, was handled
with an unprecedented efficiency.
Danger to Spectators
The danger to spectators at this
game caused by the landing and
taking-off of so many ships caused
the University lo issue an edict
closing the port on the Stanford-
California and Stanford-Army game
days, An improvised field, however,
was prepared on Embarcadero ave
nue. at tlie northern edge of Palo
Alto, lo take care of the "air
minded" football fans on these
days.
In December of last year God
dard began construction of the ill
fated glider for the Stanford
Glider Club, which was to end in
his tragic death vesterday. The
ship was entirely constructed in
the flying school's shop, making its
first flight a week ago last Satur-'
day.
