# POLITICS VS. INTELLIGENT CO-OPERATION
## 
### 
Stanford students who heard Dr. Kay Lyman Wilbur, Secretary
of the Interior, "a prominent alumnus of the class of '96," and ab
sentee president of the I'niversity, speak Friday listened to wliai
may be the first of bickerings between the seven states in the (level
opment of the C olorado Uivcr and the IsouTder 13am project. In
directly attacking the selfish aims of the political units which do nol
eoicidc with the natural topographical areas of the region, I)r
Wilbur intimated that the Reno conference will succeed in its pur
pose to co-ordinate the water requirements of the West only b_\
non-interference from pork-barrel rollers.
Stanford's president-on-leave is a shrewd man. lie demon
strated it at the Prida\ lecture on current events. Listen to practical
politicians and they'll tell yon that college presidents are theorists
in the political science field—that they fail to take in the human
dement of politics.' Mr. Wilbur appealed to the people—not the
politicians. Of course, the politicians will know that be said that
they, masters of political units, were selfish. Me hopes that the
people will express their will strongly enough to offset any detri
mental retrogression on the part of politicians.
Politicians don't care to be told the yare selfish. Consequently,
ihey and newspaper editors of the Jiearst type may be expected to
lake up Mr. Wilbttr's statements, uttered in his official capacity, and
use them in the attack against him and bis control of IJoulder Mam.
Mr. Wilbur as the Secretary of the Interior told the country
through newspaper accounts of his address here the government's
land on the political aspect of the construction of I'oulder Mam:
Shall the huge material benefits of the P.oulder Dam project accrue
to the even states as a whole or to a few selfish individuals?
