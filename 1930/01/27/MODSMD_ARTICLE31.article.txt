TWO THOUSAND YEARS OF
SCIENCE. By R. J. Harvey-
Gibson. New York: The Mac
rnillan Company. $4.00.
When the author of "Two Thou
sand Years of Science" was asked
by a friend to recommend a con
cise history of the development, of
science, he was unable to do so,
and from that incident came the
idea of writing a book to lili ihe
; request.
Harvey-Gibson lias cleverly ar
ranged his book in four parts which
he labels the Autumn, the Winter,
the Spring, and lite Summer of
science, and in which he follows
Uie development of scientific
thought and discovery from the
time of Thales of Asia Minor about
600 IJ.c. to the present day. He
compares the growth of knowledge
I in science to the development of a
winter bud on a tree, and with
each unfolding of t lie bud of
science he marks the passing of
another season until a wealth of
foliage comes forth, "yet bearing
buds in its turn—the promise of
I even greater developments to fol
low." This season is the summer
j of science, which includes the time
from the beginning of Ihe eight
eenth century to our day.
Short paragraphs on the work
of each scientist, and brief descrip
tions and explanations of various
discoveries are the feature of the
book. The author is able to de
j scribe some of the most difficult
things of science in an amazingly
small amount of space. No doubt
he found such brevity imperative
! when he began his attempt at
thoroughly covering the history of
science in a mere 345 pages pages
that are liberally sprinkled wilh
simple and understandable dia
grams'illustrating various theories,
discoveries, and principles.
Interesting facts about astron
( cmy, geology, physics, chemistry,
i and biology are discussed, with
; the main developments in each
science explained in simple and
unteclinical language that may be
readily understood by the layman.
Since it was practically impos

| Bible, us the author said in his in
troduction, for one man intimately
to know all the fields of science,
the book was produced by (he col
la bora)ion of many of the noted
scientists of England, in which
country the author lived. Harvey-
Gibson died just before the ma
terial on the book had been com
■ pletely arranged, but the work was
completed by his colleagues, and
evidently suffered little by the
change in supervision.
It is an especially worthwhile
book for those persons who have
! never had the opportunity to study
i (he sciences in detail, but who
have a desire to possess a talk
ling acquaintance with Ihe facts of
I I lie world about them, and who
wish to acquire that knowledge in
enjoyably spent leisure hours.

BEHIND THE MAKEUP—At the

New Stanford.
Just another intimate glimpse
behind the scenes into the lives of
the aof or folk, who are discovered
It) be real flesh and Idood people
i after all, though* perhaps a little
queer, if this picture is at all ac
curate.
Hal Skelly as the ham vaudeville
actor may have no high artistic
I standards; but a kind heart beats
behind his makeup, and if you
don't believe it, just watch and
listen to him rescue an indigent
wop he finds leaning against a lamp
post and start him on the road lo
fame and fortune, as his vaudeville
leant male.
But (he man proved an ingrate,
and stole not only the spotlight of
the show, but Skelly's pet waitress
as well. All turns out. well in the
end when he throws himself into
Ihe river because liis sleek inspira
tion—who had replaced the ex
waitress iu his affections- ceased
inciting liini to further artistic ef
forts.
This leaves the way clear for as
pretty a. little romance as ever oc
curred on either side of the make
i up, and you have further evidence
that right always prevails in (lie
end. —M. S.
