The Editor, Sir:
Who save the Interfraternity
Council jurisdiction over the fresh
men? It certainly assumed this
when it passes a resolution pro
nouncing' certain freshmen "guilty"
and "denying them the privilege of
pledging." The real procedure will
bo, of course, that those freshmen
will make up a blacklist of indi
viduals whom the fraternities are
forbidden to pledge. It all amounts
to the same tiling, but I consider
that to let the Interfraternity
Council get away with this attempt
to "Penalize" persons who are not
members of fraternities is to set a
precedent that is undesirable.
â€”Graduate.

The Editor, Sir:
In the. section of your paper de
voted to theatrical reviews I have
noticed lately a tendency to have
them overly sweet, giddish, and
j movie-magazinisli, if you'll allow
irie that. word.
' Of course, now and then np
peared a review which really seems
to be a review worth reading, but
unfortunately such does not ap
pear often.
I have been sorry to see the
Daily in its show review columns
go the way of all the candy coated
magazines of dear Hollywood.
Isy the way, where do your re
viewers get it?
Sincerely, CI. G. H.
