### Joe Carroll 
(Editor's Note. This is the fifth
of a series of articles by Joe Car
roll on the things to do and see
around Stanford which no real
Stanford man or woman can afford
to miss.)

Now that winter is here, the
open seaKO,n on tourists has start
ed. The Easterners are arriving
in droves. Mostly, they are people
who want to see orange groves. Ho
the student guides take them
around in back of the History
Building arid show them our or
ange trees. And the tourists are
satisfied. Look around sometime
and see the oranges yourself.
The student guides hold forth at
Ihe entrance lo the Memorial Court
where I hey meet and greet the
tourists. The Easterners are told
all about the Memorial Court, the
Stanford Chapel, and as much of
the history of the University as
can be crowded into twenty min
utes of rapid speech.
Memorial Court
Many people on (lie campus be
lieve that the Memorial Court was
dedicated to the Stanford men who
were in the World War. They're
wrong. II is called "Memorial
Court" in honor of the Stanford
volunteers to Ihe Spanish-Ameri
can War of 1898-U9. A tablet placed
in the court "by their fellow slu
dents, May 25, 1900," gives I his
informal ion. Highty-fwo names are
listed, including the names of (wo
who were killed in action.
Approximately 100,000 tourists
visit, the campus each year. The
bulk of (lie travel comes in (he
summer, which is one reason why
the Quad is not cluttered up with
curious people gazing at the native
American college student in his
Stanford habitat. Sunday is the
big day for tourists, so they miss
the hard working student even
when I hey do visit the campus.
Bus Line Tours
Bus lines running tours from San
Francisco aid greatly in handling
the large number of guests enter
tained annually by Stanford Uni
versity as visitors within its walls.
Private automobile parties also
bring scores of tourists to the
campus.
The travelers are still anxious to
see Herbert Hoover's home. Ask
any Stanford man. He may not tell
you correctly how to get to it. but
he will at least tell you something.
Pictures of (he Hoover home are in
demand even now, as is shown by
the sales record kept by the guides.
Court and Chapel
The tourists, of course, see the
Memorial Court and the Chapel es

pecially, but there are many other
points of interest which they
glimpse briefly during their rapid
trip through Stanford property.
The campus draws many outsiders,
and the things to see should cer
tainly prove as popular to Stanford
students as they do lo Ihe tourists.
Next. Thursday: The Stanford
