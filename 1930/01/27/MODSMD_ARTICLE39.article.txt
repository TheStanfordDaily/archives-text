Bears Outplayed
Although outplaying the Berke-I
Iny boys during a greater •part of j
Urn last half and narrowing the I
Hour lead down to '-V1 to '■'>() ;i coifple j
of minutes before the finish, the
Cards lacked the punch to put over
:i win, mainly because they tossed,
away a number of set-ups while j
the Hears maintained a constant j
edge in ; tailing and wrestling tac- :
tics. I
Coach Hunt surprised the wise j
ones of the press by starting a 5
team of shock troops against the j
Blue and Cold five. Everyone in ;
the stands thought that Hunt made i
this move to wear down the Bears !
a bit before injecting his first-j
siring five into the fray. And again j
the Card mentor fooled the dope-;
sters, for he did not yank out these
übst.itute starters until the first 1
half was just about over, and Cal j
had piled up a comfortable lead |
of eight points.
With Hunt's shock troops on the j
floor, the Bear quintet used their i
weaving offensive attack to perfec-,
tion and had no trouble at all in
in king the Card five-man defense
out of position to tip in set-ups
from under the basket. Time after
time, lanky Wilson Tripp received
a. hot pass in the hole, which he
quickly converted into two points. 1
The score at half time was 19 to
11, fourteen of the U.C. tallies be
ing tossed in by this lanky Wilson
Tripp.
The second half was even-steven,
with Long John McCandless, Red
Berg, and Vance Fawcett locating
the hoop, while the Card defense
began to function as it should.
However, Kent Pursel of Cal found
the basket, with regularity and kept
his team out in front with his
timely shots.
As most Cal-Stanford basketball
games, Saturday's fracas was un
duly rough. Both of the Bear regu
lar guards, Vendt and Davis, were
forced out on personals late in the
second period.
In fact, the game nearly ended
in fisticuffs, when Mike Reynolds
decided to give the much-hooted
and liowled-at referee a piece of
his mind. The latter, Blind Bill
Hollander, was saved from bodily
punishment only after the other
Card players surrounded the great
ly ired Mr. Reynolds.
Spectators' Part
Then, Blind Bill was escorted
from the floor amid the hisses and
cat-calls of the multitude, both
California and Stanford supporters
joining in the vociferous protest.
It seems that every spectator in
the house disagreed with at least
two-thirds of Referee Hollander's
decisions.
Tripp and Pursel were the big
guns for Cal, scoring 29 out of
the Bears' 36 points between them.
If Stanford can bottle up these i
two long, lean fellows in the next
two Big Series fracases, it should i
not have much trouble in chalking j
up at least one muchly desired win.
For no one else on the Cal five was
able to find the basket with any
degree of success.
McCandless Outstanding
For the Cards, Johnny .McCand
less stood out as usual, and was
high-point man for the losers with
eight markers to his credit, al
though he was only in the game for
a little over a half. Fawcett and!
Her>' featured with their tloorwork

and shooting, while Captain Roth
ert gave Ten Eyck plenty io think
about at center.
The setback practically elimi
nated Stanford from the Confer
ence race, though if still has an
'outside chance of copping high
honors, because of Saturday's vic
tory of Troy over C.C.L.A. by a
lop-sided score.

Bears Outplayed
Although outplaying the Berke-I
Iny boys during a greater •part of j
Urn last half and narrowing the I
Hour lead down to '-V1 to '■'>() ;i coifple j
of minutes before the finish, the
Cards lacked the punch to put over
:i win, mainly because they tossed,
away a number of set-ups while j
the Hears maintained a constant j
edge in ; tailing and wrestling tac- :
tics. I
Coach Hunt surprised the wise j
ones of the press by starting a 5
team of shock troops against the j
Blue and Cold five. Everyone in ;
the stands thought that Hunt made i
this move to wear down the Bears !
a bit before injecting his first-j
siring five into the fray. And again j
the Card mentor fooled the dope-;
sters, for he did not yank out these
übst.itute starters until the first 1
half was just about over, and Cal j
had piled up a comfortable lead |
of eight points.
With Hunt's shock troops on the j
floor, the Bear quintet used their i
weaving offensive attack to perfec-,
tion and had no trouble at all in
in king the Card five-man defense
out of position to tip in set-ups
from under the basket. Time after
time, lanky Wilson Tripp received
a. hot pass in the hole, which he
quickly converted into two points. 1
The score at half time was 19 to
11, fourteen of the U.C. tallies be
ing tossed in by this lanky Wilson
Tripp.
The second half was even-steven,
with Long John McCandless, Red
Berg, and Vance Fawcett locating
the hoop, while the Card defense
began to function as it should.
However, Kent Pursel of Cal found
the basket, with regularity and kept
his team out in front with his
timely shots.
As most Cal-Stanford basketball
games, Saturday's fracas was un
duly rough. Both of the Bear regu
lar guards, Vendt and Davis, were
forced out on personals late in the
second period.
In fact, the game nearly ended
in fisticuffs, when Mike Reynolds
decided to give the much-hooted
and liowled-at referee a piece of
his mind. The latter, Blind Bill
Hollander, was saved from bodily
punishment only after the other
Card players surrounded the great
ly ired Mr. Reynolds.
Spectators' Part
Then, Blind Bill was escorted
from the floor amid the hisses and
cat-calls of the multitude, both
California and Stanford supporters
joining in the vociferous protest.
It seems that every spectator in
the house disagreed with at least
two-thirds of Referee Hollander's
decisions.
Tripp and Pursel were the big
guns for Cal, scoring 29 out of
the Bears' 36 points between them.
If Stanford can bottle up these i
two long, lean fellows in the next
two Big Series fracases, it should i
not have much trouble in chalking j
up at least one muchly desired win.
For no one else on the Cal five was
able to find the basket with any
degree of success.
McCandless Outstanding
For the Cards, Johnny .McCand
less stood out as usual, and was
high-point man for the losers with
eight markers to his credit, al
though he was only in the game for
a little over a half. Fawcett and!
Her>' featured with their tloorwork

and shooting, while Captain Roth
ert gave Ten Eyck plenty io think
about at center.
The setback practically elimi
nated Stanford from the Confer
ence race, though if still has an
'outside chance of copping high
honors, because of Saturday's vic
tory of Troy over C.C.L.A. by a
lop-sided score.

Bears Outplayed
Although outplaying the Berke-I
Iny boys during a greater •part of j
Urn last half and narrowing the I
Hour lead down to '-V1 to '■'>() ;i coifple j
of minutes before the finish, the
Cards lacked the punch to put over
:i win, mainly because they tossed,
away a number of set-ups while j
the Hears maintained a constant j
edge in ; tailing and wrestling tac- :
tics. I
Coach Hunt surprised the wise j
ones of the press by starting a 5
team of shock troops against the j
Blue and Cold five. Everyone in ;
the stands thought that Hunt made i
this move to wear down the Bears !
a bit before injecting his first-j
siring five into the fray. And again j
the Card mentor fooled the dope-;
sters, for he did not yank out these
übst.itute starters until the first 1
half was just about over, and Cal j
had piled up a comfortable lead |
of eight points.
With Hunt's shock troops on the j
floor, the Bear quintet used their i
weaving offensive attack to perfec-,
tion and had no trouble at all in
in king the Card five-man defense
out of position to tip in set-ups
from under the basket. Time after
time, lanky Wilson Tripp received
a. hot pass in the hole, which he
quickly converted into two points. 1
The score at half time was 19 to
11, fourteen of the U.C. tallies be
ing tossed in by this lanky Wilson
Tripp.
The second half was even-steven,
with Long John McCandless, Red
Berg, and Vance Fawcett locating
the hoop, while the Card defense
began to function as it should.
However, Kent Pursel of Cal found
the basket, with regularity and kept
his team out in front with his
timely shots.
As most Cal-Stanford basketball
games, Saturday's fracas was un
duly rough. Both of the Bear regu
lar guards, Vendt and Davis, were
forced out on personals late in the
second period.
In fact, the game nearly ended
in fisticuffs, when Mike Reynolds
decided to give the much-hooted
and liowled-at referee a piece of
his mind. The latter, Blind Bill
Hollander, was saved from bodily
punishment only after the other
Card players surrounded the great
ly ired Mr. Reynolds.
Spectators' Part
Then, Blind Bill was escorted
from the floor amid the hisses and
cat-calls of the multitude, both
California and Stanford supporters
joining in the vociferous protest.
It seems that every spectator in
the house disagreed with at least
two-thirds of Referee Hollander's
decisions.
Tripp and Pursel were the big
guns for Cal, scoring 29 out of
the Bears' 36 points between them.
If Stanford can bottle up these i
two long, lean fellows in the next
two Big Series fracases, it should i
not have much trouble in chalking j
up at least one muchly desired win.
For no one else on the Cal five was
able to find the basket with any
degree of success.
McCandless Outstanding
For the Cards, Johnny .McCand
less stood out as usual, and was
high-point man for the losers with
eight markers to his credit, al
though he was only in the game for
a little over a half. Fawcett and!
Her>' featured with their tloorwork

and shooting, while Captain Roth
ert gave Ten Eyck plenty io think
about at center.
The setback practically elimi
nated Stanford from the Confer
ence race, though if still has an
'outside chance of copping high
honors, because of Saturday's vic
tory of Troy over C.C.L.A. by a
lop-sided score.
