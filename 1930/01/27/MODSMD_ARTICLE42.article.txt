# AGE AND YOUTH....

### Feg Murray, '16 
"For New York; Zachary and
Dickey!" Be ready to hear 'ball
park announcers bawling out that"
sentence this summer when it
comes time to tell the pop-eyed
fans Who will pitch and who will
catch for the day's game. And
there will be many rival managers
who will grit their teeth and mut
ter because they didn't grab that
man Zachary when he was offered
by the Senators on waivers, or be
cause their scouts didn't grab
Dickey first, too.
Jonathan Thompson Zachary,
the "Age" of this combination, will
be thirty-three years old next May.
He is not too old to do many sea
sons of effective hurling when you
think of what real old guys like

Alexander, Johnson, and Cy Young
did. "Zach" starred at Guilford Col
lege before . lie joined the A's as
"Zach Walton" in 1918, and, after
becoming a regular member of the
Washington hurling staff in 1920,
Ik l established a. record as a fair
left-hander, who usually won more
games in a season than lie lost.
Twenty-three-year-old Billy Dickey
is a future star or many a good
baseball man is all wrong in his
predictions. He caught over 100
games in his first season in the
majors, fielded like a veteran, and
batted .324. He is husky—weighs
185 pounds—thrives on Work, is
modest, ambitious, quick to learn,
and has everything a catcher needs
to make liini a star.
