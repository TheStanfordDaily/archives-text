ANSWER ON PAGE?â€”
II will be some time, we imagine,
before the campus ceases to hum
with a discussion of last Saturday
night's basketball game against
the gentlemen from California, and
the memory of the affair is bound
to leave a dark-brown taste in the
mouths of Stanford rooters.
Two things proved to be fo
cal points of discussion today.
The first one is really of minor
importance. But why in the
name of all that's holy do Stan
ford authorities persist in hir
ing referees who invariably
draw the ire of the crowd upon
their heads by their officiating?
Bill Hollander, the pudgy gen
tleman whose activities with
the whistle endangered his
health last Saturday night, was
in water only a shade less tor
rid during the second Big Game
here last winter, and the writer
has heard him booed impartial
ly by rooters of both teams in
numerous other games. There
are several men in the Bay Re
gion, including Ned Kay, who
refereed the freshman affair
night before last, Herb Dana,
Paul O'Neill, and others, who
are capable of the clean-cut of
ficiating that a Stanford-Cali
fornia game deserves. We hope
that Mr. Hollander has made
his last appearance on a Stan
ford court in an official capa
city.
The second incident which is
causing it great deal of comment
is Coach Husky Hunt's use of shock
troops. This idea of starting a sec
ond string is comparatively new to
Pacific Coast basketball, having
been introduced successfully this
season by Ad Dewey, coach of the
Rossi Florists, one of the fastest
amateur hoop teams in this section.
Dewey says that the advantages of
the system lie in the fact that
where your first string men are
likely to be nervous at the start of
an important contest, your second
learn will be striving to make good,
and lose their nervousness in their
concentration on success. But the
real effect of it, he admits, is to
tire the opponents by setting a
whirlwind pace in 1 lie opening ten
minutes, and then inserting a fresh
first string which can outdistance
ils winded adversaries.
In the face of that, Hunt's ac
tions against the Bears become
more or less of a mystery. In the
first place, whatever pace-setting
there was done by California, who
opened up with their fast-breaking
weave when they had the ball, and
then, when they lost possession of
il, stood around under their own
basket and rested until Stanford,
using the slow break, came cau
tiously up to mid-court and threw
the ball out of bounds or into the
hands of some Bear player.
In the second place, Califor
nia was tiring badly at the end
of the first ten minutes, due
chiefly to their own basket
shooting efforts. 'But the Card
shock troops had tired right
along with them, and their bolt
was shot. Yet Hunt allowed all
but one of his starting line-up
to stay on the court for another
seven minutes while the Bear
lead grew to alarming propor
tions. Then with only three
minutes of play left in the first
half, he shot in his regulars,
who had barely time to get
warm when the gun cut short
activities.
In the second half, California re
turned refreshed and matched the
Redshirt varsity's spurts with sev
eral of their own, to finish on the
long end of the count. The question
of the moment is now "What price
shock troops?"
