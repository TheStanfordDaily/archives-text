# VARSITY BALL TOSSERS LOSE SEASON'S OPENER SATURDAY TO O.C. TEAM, 13-7
## 
### 
By Howard Moore
Twenty-one Cardinals lost a
game to the Olympic Club last Sat
urday afternoon. No one can say
it was a baseball game—it was
more like a combined parade, cir
cus, and mob scene plus plenty of
bleacher wisecracks and with one
or two boys in uniform throwing
the ball around occasionally.
After two hours and -15 minutes
of playing time, the game was
called on account of darkness at
the end of the eighth inning with
the Winged "O" leading 13-7, hut
some of the critics say il was
called on account of lack of fur
ther available substitutes. The
Cards used 21 players and the
O.C.'s 13.
Redshirts Score
The first six innings went all
right, the Redshirts scoring one
each in the first and second on a
combination of three errors, a
walk, and a hit, and the Post Street
outfit gleaning one in the first and
fifth and two in the third by eight
hits including four doubles and a
triple.
Then the fireworks started. In
the seventh, the Redshirts jumped
into a 6-4 lead, scoring a quartet of
runs by three tree tickets, two er
rors, and one long single by Hun
ken. Each ball called by the umpire
raised a howl of protest from one
Bud De Meyer, O.C. pitcher. His
teammates went into a huddle and
argued, pleaded, and threatened.
Finally a couple of strikeouts were
called and t he appeased Post
Streeters trotted in to take up their
bats.
Three Pitchers
They retaliated with nine runs,
not a single one earned. Coach
Wolter used three pitchers and each
one contributed miscues until one
error, two wild pitches, six walks,
and three safe bingles forced in
the nine tallies. If the umpire
hadn't called the game, the club
men might still be at bat.
Loom is and Taylor pitched good
ball for the Redshirts while they

were in, and Johnson turned in
some nice work at shortstop.
"Spud" Hardy, varsity first-string
(atelier, was severely spiked in the
wrist in the first inning when
Smith, Olympic Club third base
man. attempted to score and slid
into Hardy at the plate. Hardy will
be out of the game for about three
weeks, according to Coach Wolter.

Three Pitchers
They retaliated with nine runs,
not a single one earned. Coach
Wolter used three pitchers and each
one contributed miscues until one
error, two wild pitches, six walks,
and three safe bingles forced in
the nine tallies. If the umpire
hadn't called the game, the club
men might still be at bat.
Loom is and Taylor pitched good
ball for the Redshirts while they

were in, and Johnson turned in
some nice work at shortstop.
"Spud" Hardy, varsity first-string
(atelier, was severely spiked in the
wrist in the first inning when
Smith, Olympic Club third base
man. attempted to score and slid
into Hardy at the plate. Hardy will
be out of the game for about three
weeks, according to Coach Wolter.

Twenty-one Cardinals lost a
game to the Olympic Club last Sat
urday afternoon. No one can say
it was a baseball game—it was
more like a combined parade, cir
cus, and mob scene plus plenty of
bleacher wisecracks and with one
or two boys in uniform throwing
the ball around occasionally.
After two hours and -15 minutes
of playing time, the game was
called on account of darkness at
the end of the eighth inning with
the Winged "O" leading 13-7, hut
some of the critics say il was
called on account of lack of fur
ther available substitutes. The
Cards used 21 players and the
O.C.'s 13.
Redshirts Score
The first six innings went all
right, the Redshirts scoring one
each in the first and second on a
combination of three errors, a
walk, and a hit, and the Post Street
outfit gleaning one in the first and
fifth and two in the third by eight
hits including four doubles and a
triple.
Then the fireworks started. In
the seventh, the Redshirts jumped
into a 6-4 lead, scoring a quartet of
runs by three tree tickets, two er
rors, and one long single by Hun
ken. Each ball called by the umpire
raised a howl of protest from one
Bud De Meyer, O.C. pitcher. His
teammates went into a huddle and
argued, pleaded, and threatened.
Finally a couple of strikeouts were
called and t he appeased Post
Streeters trotted in to take up their
bats.

By Howard Moore
Twenty-one Cardinals lost a
game to the Olympic Club last Sat
urday afternoon. No one can say
it was a baseball game—it was
more like a combined parade, cir
cus, and mob scene plus plenty of
bleacher wisecracks and with one
or two boys in uniform throwing
the ball around occasionally.
After two hours and -15 minutes
of playing time, the game was
called on account of darkness at
the end of the eighth inning with
the Winged "O" leading 13-7, hut
some of the critics say il was
called on account of lack of fur
ther available substitutes. The
Cards used 21 players and the
O.C.'s 13.
Redshirts Score
The first six innings went all
right, the Redshirts scoring one
each in the first and second on a
combination of three errors, a
walk, and a hit, and the Post Street
outfit gleaning one in the first and
fifth and two in the third by eight
hits including four doubles and a
triple.
Then the fireworks started. In
the seventh, the Redshirts jumped
into a 6-4 lead, scoring a quartet of
runs by three tree tickets, two er
rors, and one long single by Hun
ken. Each ball called by the umpire
raised a howl of protest from one
Bud De Meyer, O.C. pitcher. His
teammates went into a huddle and
argued, pleaded, and threatened.
Finally a couple of strikeouts were
called and t he appeased Post
Streeters trotted in to take up their
bats.
Three Pitchers
They retaliated with nine runs,
not a single one earned. Coach
Wolter used three pitchers and each
one contributed miscues until one
error, two wild pitches, six walks,
and three safe bingles forced in
the nine tallies. If the umpire
hadn't called the game, the club
men might still be at bat.
Loom is and Taylor pitched good
ball for the Redshirts while they

were in, and Johnson turned in
some nice work at shortstop.
"Spud" Hardy, varsity first-string
(atelier, was severely spiked in the
wrist in the first inning when
Smith, Olympic Club third base
man. attempted to score and slid
into Hardy at the plate. Hardy will
be out of the game for about three
weeks, according to Coach Wolter.
