# WILBUR TALKS OF NEEDS FOR DAM SOLUTION
## Politics, Topography Must Be Co-ordinated For Boulder Plan Water Storage Basis For Western Civilization 
### 
Co-ordination between the na
tural topography and the super-im
posed political units must result
before the Boulder Dam project
will ever become a practical real
ity.
This waft the opinion expressed
by Ray Lyman Wilbur, president
of Stanford on leave and Secretary
of tlie Interior, speaking before
2500 students at an all-University
Assembly Friday about (lie work
and problems of the Department
of the Interior.
Natural Laws
"You must realize that there are
certain natural laws. One of these
is that water does not run uphill.
Then there is the natural topogra
phy of the land upon which is laid
a checkerboard of political units.
These must be agreed, and with
the advice of experts, it can be
worked out to a satisfactory con
clusion," Secretary Wilbur said.
"Water storage is the real basis
for our civilization in the West.
Water is the determining factor in
the population and wealth."
In the Kettleman Hills problem,
the solution is much the same.
"Politicians regard it as though a
waffle iron has bteen pressed into
the land with different people
holding different, sections of pat
ented land. Political mechanisms
must regard the physical facts."
Indian Reservations
As concerns the distribution of
Indian reservations, Wilbur said.
"Unless we can get out. of the
tangle of legislation we may be
left in a very unsatisfactory posi
tion. It comes as a unique responsi
bility to me that these lands are
either well protected or handled
with wide programs instead of cen
tered on immediate needs."
We realize that in a democracy
a majority may rule, so we have to
keep in touch with the people. Our
capacity to advance is our capacity
to understand what political effect
our actions would have on any
democracy. Besides this, the na
tural laws are there and we have
to find out how to use them."
Secretary Wilbur stated he had
the distinction of being the presi
dent of an Alaskan railroad which
lost $75,000 less last year than the
year before.
Co-ordination between the na
tural topography and the super-im
posed political units must result
before the Boulder Dam project
will ever become a practical real
ity.

Indian reservations, Wilbur said.
"Unless we can get out. of the
tangle of legislation we may be
left in a very unsatisfactory posi
tion. It comes as a unique responsi
bility to me that these lands are
either well protected or handled
with wide programs instead of cen
tered on immediate needs."
We realize that in a democracy
a majority may rule, so we have to
keep in touch with the people. Our
capacity to advance is our capacity
to understand what political effect
our actions would have on any
democracy. Besides this, the na
tural laws are there and we have
to find out how to use them."
Secretary Wilbur stated he had
the distinction of being the presi
dent of an Alaskan railroad which
lost $75,000 less last year than the
year before.
