# CARD SPRINTERS TO USE BLOCKS
## Cromwell Says U.S.C. Can Win Despite Blocks 
### 
"Sure we'll use thern." Dink ,
Templeton, Stanford track coach,
commented on the use,of the start
ing blocks that acuscd such a
furor last year at Los Angeles, j
when the Stanford tracksters un- |
officially ran away with the Bis j
Four meet, but lost on disqualifica
tions for the use of blocks.
"They have been unanimously
approved by the N.C.A.A.," Tem
pleton said, "and 1 shall have any ;
of my men use them that 1 think j
will benefit by their use. Since the
Pacitic Coast Conference operates ■
under the rules of the N.C.A.A., ;
it is the only organization that
counts here on the coast, and the
use of the blocks will be perfectly
legal."
Coach Dean Cromwell of U.S.C.
recently voiced a defi to Temple
ton, saying that lie intended to
beat the Cardinal trackmen this
year, whether or not the blocks
were used.
Starting blocks are now pretty
generally used all over the East,
since in the big relay meets, much
time can be saved in running off
the events. Simpson of Ohio State
used them last year in his fast
races, and they are very much ap
proved by track fans who dislike
waiting for the men to dig starting
holes.
Both hand and foot starting block:*
were approved last fall by the
N.C.A.A., but the hand blocks,
which were designed by Temple
ton last year, were not approved
by the A.A.U., which is in a posi
tion to approve times for world
records. All the Stanford printers
have been starting with the blocks
the past few weeks. Hand blocks
are designed to aid the sprinter in
always starting from a uniform
position.
