Arc extra-curricular activities in
college worth while?
Should restrictions Im• placed on
participation in them?
These and a number of other
j questions were answered by Dean
of Women Mary Yost, and Dean
of Men George B. Culver in inter
views for the Daily, Friday.
Because of their positions of au
thority and the nature of their
work, in which they meet practi
cally fver.\ student of the Cnivei
112 nit y. Deans Yost and Culver are
I particularly well fitted to answer
! such questions as the above which
often arise in the minds of stu
dents, and (heir opinions have
j been sought by the Dairy In the
first of a series of interviews with
faculty members on the various
student activities and their values
to the participants,
"At least once every college gen
eration, every four years, each
campus activity should be surveyed
1 to discover any which no longer
have a place in University life,"
| said Dean Yost.
I "At the same time they could b<'

classified ;t* online to major and
minor, but a tradition that no stu
dent should undertake responsi
bility in more than one major and
one minor activity al, the same
time, then, when correlated with
academic work, they would have a
very sound place.
"The most valuable activities, as
for one instance, your Daily, are
those in which work can be pro
gressive ami in which the student
may win during bis three or four
years of work positions of leader
ship and merit.
".Activities may play a real and
wholesome (tart In college life, but
they can by mismanagement cause
definite harm," continued the dean
of women. "They should not be an
end in themselves."
Vague objectives, overlapping
functions, and too much work for
too few people she classified as
her objections to the present state
at Stanford. As a partial remedy
she would make It advisable for
each committee of five formed to
have on it two people new to activi
ties, and each committee of three
to have one new student.
"This would do away with any
! blas6 attitude toward activities,"
j she concluded, "and would , give
[ sophomores and juniors especially
! the chance to participate."
"University life is not just a part
: of life. Il is life itself and all of
• us have in live our lives ourselves,"
I lean Culver asserted.
Few Restrictions
"I believe in as few restrictions
■ as possible concerning yne's par
ticipation in ■student activities,"
'said Ihe Dean. "Success, it seems
to me, can only come through per
sonal adjustment to conditions as
| we Jiml lliein or are able to make
j them. Whatever opinions I may ex
■ pre i hoilld lie considered solely
| in connection with men students.
J "There are, I believe, many so-
I called 'extra curricular' activities
i which are in ilieir nature construc
| live and beneficial to the student -
i activities which afford training and
j experience and contacts which
j prove of greai value to the indi
i vidual as well as io the couimun
■ ily which claims him after he has
| left Stanford. I can recall many
j such eas< s.
Waste Time and Energy
"I am equally certain that some
| other activities are of compara
tively small value and frequently.
| result in an absolute waste of time
■and energy. Worse than this, they
i crowd out the worthy attainment
I of scholarly ideals and intellectual
| achievement. I! is a curious com
| mentary on many of our colleges
i and universities that it is easily
possible for men of splendid men
i tal and personal ability to become.
; so vastly interested and readily
I useful to the student body and the
. university as to neglect and appar-
I ently l'orget the real purpose of
the university and their own pur
: poses in attending it. As a result,
they go out with no adequate uni
versity training aside from that
; gained from their various activi
i ties. They graduate in the class
j that 'just got by.'
Politics Worthwhile
"I believe that it is a good thing
; for students to become interested
! in university politics, at least to
the extent of taking enough real
interest to see that worthwhile
, men and women are elected to of
fice —who, when they get into of
fice, think in terms of the office
and the responsibility that have
been given them, rather than in
• terms of political obligations that
may. not be to the best interests of
the university and the student
body. It is well to be politically
minded if it does not interfere
with being public spirited.
"The incessant and insistent
cry to 'get on the boat' demoral
izes and discourages some men
who do not take to the water read
ily. They need seasoning and self

' development and would become ex
pert oarsmen i!' given more time
and allowed to do a bit of wading
