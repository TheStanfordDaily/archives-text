LONDON, Jan. 27. (/P) —France
today gained a technical victory on
a point of procedure for the formal
agenda of the Five Power Naval
Disarmament Conference after a
meeting of the chief delegates at
Number 10 Downing Street.
What actually happened was that
after nearly three hours of keen
discussion, the delegates endeav
ored to settle part of their dis
agreement by invoking the alpha
bet, and under its auspices France,
by precedence over Italy, was
granted the right to propose dis
cussion of the French plan for
limitation of naval armaments by
total tonnage instead of by cate
gories of ships.
This is expected to produce a
compromise on the global tonnage
proposals satisfactory to all the
powers. Meanwhile, Italy's desire
to plunge into the question of
maximum and minimum fleets for
each country must wait.
Secretary of State Stimson ad
mitted that today's meeting, which
lasted far past the hour for lunch,
had proceeded more slowly than
he desired.
For the Americans and the Japa
nese it was largely a day of watch
ful waiting while the European
delegates maneuvered in a maze
of technicalities relating to Franco-
Italian problems, including naval
parity.
