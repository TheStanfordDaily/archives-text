# CARDINAL BASEBALL TEAM PREPARED TO MEET S.F. TOSSERS
## 
### 
After ;i rather dismal clay of
errors, wild pitches, walks, and
various other types of free tickets
about the bases in last Saturday's
game against the Olympic Club,
Coach Wolter's charges are all set
to go against the fast Kenealy
Seals nine tomorrow afternoon.
Wolter used five pitchers in the
Winged "O" game as well as seven
or eight inflelders and a crop of
outfielders, and gave the boys a
chance to show their stuff. With
only four days of practice, nothing
startling was expected, but the
Redshirts should make a better
showing in their second game.
The two Dons, Story and Oswill,
will be Wolter's battery against
the Winter League outfit. Story
was a star pitcher two years ago
011 the frosli team when he dis
tinguished himself by hurling a
no-hit, no-run, no-walk game against
Bitrlingame High and another one
against Hayward High. Oswill is a
reserve who should see plenty of
action during the year.
Goodell will replace Marks on
first base, while Churchill, Laird,
and Johnson will play the rest of
the infield. Hunken will retain his
position in the left pasture, Lee
will be shifted lo right field, and
Campbell will patrol the area be
tween them.
Cutshaw, a transfer from Braw
ley J.C., who has shown real prom
use at second base, will be out of
the game for at least a week, ac
cording to Wolter. Cutshaw suf
fered a charley horse the first day
of practice and pulled it when run
ning the bases in Hie Olympic Club
game.
