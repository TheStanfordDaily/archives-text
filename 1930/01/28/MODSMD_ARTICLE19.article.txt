# FRATERNITY BOARD O.K.'S NEW RULES
## Interfraternity Board May Withhold Frosh Right To Be Pledged Punishment of Violators Not Definite 
### 
The Interfrateruity Board of
Control has the power to punish
freshmen caught on rushing parties
to the extent of denying them the
right to pledge any house until the
following winter quarter. This was
asserted at a meeting of the Board
last night. However, no fixed pun
ishment was decided upon, it being
left to the discretion of the Board
which will judge the seriousness of
the violation.
The rushing rules presented lo
the Interfraternity Council at its
last meeting were passed together
with the suggestions that flic
Council made. The suggestions
were those referring to the punish
ment of freshmen caught on rush
ing parties and the rules regarding
formal rushing. The formal rush
ing period will take place at the
start of spring quarter and will
consist of two periods. During the
first period the fraternities will
rush on alternate days; the last
period will be solid, all fraternities
rushing every day.
