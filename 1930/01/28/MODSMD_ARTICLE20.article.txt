# GARDINER AND WOOD SCORE EASY WINS IN PRELIMINARY BOUTS
## 
### 
In the two preliminary bouts of
the all-University tournament run off
in the boxing gallery yesterday, Toni
jmy Gardiner packed too much of a i
' punch for Arnold Stcincr, and won
!by a technical knockout in the lirsl
] round, while Jerry Wood took a de
cision from Art Angel after three
i torrid rounds.
Thcbouts were a trifle late in start
ing, and Harry Maloncy put the V'ar-J
j sity squad through their paces to en-,
I tcrtain the crowd. Some fast action
I was crammed into the short workout
| of the Varsity, and the men received
| quite a hand when their bouts were
â–  concluded.
In the first preliminary scrap of
j the tourney, Tom Gardiner showed a
1 little too much strength and experi-
I ence against Arnold Stcincr and liatl
j his hand raised by Maloney in the
! first round. Stcincr fought back game-
Ily against his heavier opponent, but
j the odds were too steep for him.
j The second and concluding match
iof the day saw Jerry Wood win
j handily from Art Angel. Wood
I showed a marked improvement in yes
terday's bout, u>ing his long reach to
j stab Angel repeatedly with a straight
; left. Angel was put at a tremendous
j disadvantage by his opponent's ad
i vantage of reach, but never stopped
j coining in. Angel staggered his lanky
i opponent in the second with a stiff
I right, hut was unable to follow up
j the advantage.
About seventeen bouts are sched
i ulcd for Thursday night in the Pa
j vilioti, Harry Malouej announced,
land the matches will start promptly
lat 7:30 in order to permit all the
j fights to be run off.
