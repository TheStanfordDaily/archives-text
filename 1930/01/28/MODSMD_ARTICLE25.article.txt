# SHAKESPEARE-BACON CONTROVERSY INVESTIGATED BY PALO ALTO MAN
## 
### Betty Clarke 
j Whether Shakespeare or Macon
| wrote the plays generally attribu
ted to Shakespeare is a question
I wicli must, he dealt with from (lie
! scientific point of view, according
! to James Hestwood of Palo Alto.
| Hestwood, a plasterer by trade, has
! become widely known because of
I his research on this question.
| Hestwood claims to have di.-s-
I covered some interesting inform.i
! tion which may throw more light
|on the subject. lie has been at
i work on the Shakespeare Macon
' controversy for several years, do
; ing his individual research in the
j Stanford library. Jlowever, as yet
jhe does not commit himself one
! way or the other, but is striving
! for the positive and manifold proof
i that will result from bis employing
. the same method of research as
,that used in chemistry and physics.
Controversy Revived
When J. Edward Morgan, former
Oakland printer, returned from
! England, where lie bad found what
|he claims to be substantial evl
| dence that Bacon was the "master
| playwright," the question of the
1

authorship was revived, and public
interest on the subject reawakened
In looking over old manuscripts,
Morgan discovered "F. 8." 's in the
margins of many of the Shake
spearean plays, which he believes
confirms Francis Haeon as the real
author. Also, in the designs on the
frontispieces of the original folios,
he claims to have discerned the
name Francis Bacon, cleverly con
cealed, and under many of the titl<>
pieces of the acts lie decipherer
Bacon's signalure.
Pro-Baconists
Morgan says that the English are
wary of admitting any belief In the
Bacon theory because many pro
Baconists contend that Lord Vera
lain was the son of Queen Eliza
both whom they supposed married
the Earl of Leicester secretly be
fore she came to the throne. This
theory, if accepted, might prove
that the royal line now on the
throne has no right to it.
An authority of Cornell, speak
ing of Morgan's discoveries for the
Cornell "Sun." student paper,
claims that "F. 8." was only a
printer's device. If that indicates
Bacon's authorship, he said, the
man would have written more than
half of Elizabethan literature, since
the initials are to be found in most
of the writings of that time. As for
the cover designs, the Cornell
scholar explained that wood blocks
were commonly used for long
periods of time, in many volumes,
and by various authors.
Unquestionable Proof
Morgan went to England to
prove conclusively that. Shake
speare was the author. Having
found what he considers unques
tionable proof on tlie contrary side
of the Bacon-Shakespeare contro
versy, the Cornell authority says
that in the light of his proof, "the.

' father of English essay must also
be the author of scores of other
Elizabethan plays, good or bad."
Experts, well-informed about Eliza-
I bethan printing, are the only ones
' qualified to discuss matters of this
- sort.
i Like Hestwood is the stand
j taken by the Bacon Society of
America, to look at the contro
versy objectively, located in
New York City, of which he is a
member. This society does not try
to prove Bacon's authorship, but
merely to face the question dis
passionately and arrive at the
truth in that way. The society was
founded in about 1923, and now
has two branches, one at the Uni
versity of Miami at Oxford, Ohio,
: and another in Philadelphia.
France, Germany, and England
also have students at work on the
i question.
