# Twisted Wreck Dragged From Mud, Junked Here
## 
### 
A heavy cage of twisted steel is
all that remains of the Goddard
glider as it lies in the P.A.S.A.
hangar on the campus. The broad
wing which made it fly, and the
light tail surfaces which steered it,
are lying where they fell in the
Oakland Estuary, snapped off when
the wreck was dragged out of the
mud and water.
The broken fuselage was brought
to the airport on a truck yesterday,
and will be crammed back in some
corner of the hangar of junk.
