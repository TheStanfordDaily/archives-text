Shed ;i tear for Stanford's rushing regulations.
Inspired by the latest Interlrateruity (otincil ruling and hy a
sense of hunior which is positively delicious, the young chaps who
lend their brain power to the Paily ( ali fornian's editorial page have
turned the big guns of lUrkeh-y wit lull upon the misguided youths
down here on the Farm who are trying to make the world safe for
the fraternities and the freshmen.
Cp at llc.rkeley they are very progressive. I hey have just loads
of fraternities—all that you ever heard of, and a lot that no one ever
heard of. So they are well (jtialified to judge, don't you know.
1 he outstanding funny man to wave his facile pen in the direc
tion of Stanford is one who signs himself i\. I I. \V. and conducts a
column called " The Californiac." Running close second is an un
known writer who editorializes under this heading: "Why Substi
tute Distrust for Trust: The California Method Seems l'etter."
The difference between the two lies in the fact that R. 11. \V. is
intentionally funny.
Following is a sample of the profound reasoning employed by
the Californian editorial writer:
"Although Stanford rushing is regulated and ours is not, much
more complaint arises at the harm than here. There the law-abiding
are penalized. Many fraternities break the rules but few are caught.
Most violators profit by their violations.
"The situation is different here. Few fraternities indulge in un
fair rushing. There are no rules to break; no organization secures
an advantage by breaking them."
That, dear reader, is much funnier than R. 11. YV.'s labored wit.
()ver in Russia during the late unpleasantness when Czar Nicho
las was deprived of his throne, they followed the same line of rea
soning, von know. There was no lawlessness then because there
were no laws to disregard.
"California fraternities profit bv their trust." declares the Cali
f ornian.
Can't vou just see the California boys sitting about the fraternal
fireside, adjusting the big knots in their neckties, and reveling in
trustworthiness?
Then the scene shifts, it's at the I'alace or the St. Francis. I'y
groups of two or three the California lads arc sitting at tables with
a freshman, who is getting bleary-eyed in preparation for being pre
sented with a pretty colored bit of brass just before he passes out.

1 he outstanding funny man to wave his facile pen in the direc

more complaint arises at the harm than here. There the law-abiding
are penalized. Many fraternities break the rules but few are caught.
Most violators profit by their violations.
"The situation is different here. Few fraternities indulge in un
fair rushing. There are no rules to break; no organization secures
an advantage by breaking them."
That, dear reader, is much funnier than R. 11. YV.'s labored wit.

soning, von know. There was no lawlessness then because there
were no laws to disregard.

fireside, adjusting the big knots in their neckties, and reveling in
trustworthiness?
