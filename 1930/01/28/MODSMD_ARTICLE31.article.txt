# LOBBYING BY AIR
## 
### 
With the rapidly increasing numbers of radio sots, air propa
ganda is fast assuming a prime position among the social and
political problems of the I'nited States. The'previous dominance of
the press in tins field is rapidly being displaced by the skill til combi
nation of musical programs and partisan information. Lobbying is
being transferred from the center of legislation to the homes of the
voters and the question of ownership of the air channels will become
increasingly important as further use of them is made.
Recently there has been organized a nation wide chain of radio
stations giving regular information on the topics of the day from
the National Capitol. The political value of such information cannot
be over-estimated.
Vndoubtedlv radio, by giving accurate, nonpartisan news and
hv giving equal prominence to opposing factions where controversial
topics are concerned, can contribute much to the institutions of dem
ocratic government, l'ut the danger ol monopoly and the misuse
of the air are problems which should inter' st every citizen.
I he advertising aspect ol radio in this connection is unimportant
because the sponsoring organization must declare its identity in
order to reap any benefit from the publicity. For political purposes
uch announcement is not necessary and 111 many cases the program
is more effective if it is omitted.
Newspapers liave for years been compelled to publish semi-an
nually a report indicating the ownership ol the stock of the company
b uing the paper in order to bring public attention to any industrial
or political leanings the publication might have. In order to maintain
the political honest\ of radio programs, stations and chains as well
should likewise be forced to declare their ownership at regular in
tervals.
