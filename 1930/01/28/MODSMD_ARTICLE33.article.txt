THE JADE MOUNTAIN, A CHI-,
N ES,E ANTHOLOGY. Trans
lated by Witter Bynner. New
York: Alfred A. Knopf. 1929.
This anthology of three hundred
I poems <d Hit? T'ang Dynasty, tils j
9(H» A.1)., is, in 11original, tin 1
most popular hook of verse in the
Orient. Its translation is the result
of ten years' co-operation between
Bynner and i>r. Kiaug Kang-Hu, 1
noted scholar of Peking.
The book is very interesting, and
one is surprised fliitl ii is easy to \
understand and that the poetic
J symbols used seem quite as beau
tiful to the Occidental as they una l
have been in the original language.
They are, indeed, mueh nearer to
ns than are most lOnropean produc
tions of the Middle Ages. (''or j
example:
"I think of heaven and earth,
without limit, willioul end,
| And I am till alone and my j
tears fall down."
"Her hands of white jade by
a window of snow
Are glimmering on a golden- 1
fretted harp—
And to draw the quick eye of
Chou Yu,
I She touches a wrong note now
and then."
"... A thousand years' fame, ;
ten thousand years' fame—
What good, when you are dead j
and gone?"
It is true, as Bynner remarks in
the introduction, that few people
of our civilization know of any
: thing but the Greek and Hebrew
traditions of literature. But, wilh
completely different traditions, the j
! two streams of literature seem to
have travelled essentially the same 1
path.
There are extant in China poems
written 2357 years 8.C., or more
than a thousand years before
Homer. The combination of this
i ancient line of writing with our
own must produce interesting re
i suits, and its study*might indicate,
: to some extent, the course which
will be followed in the future by .

our literature.
The introduction and notes to
The Jade Mountain give a brief
history of Chinese poetry, and ex
plain the various verse forms used.
Il is, of course, impossible to say
that the translation is good when
one knows nothing of the originals,
hut the translations are surely, in
themselves, good poems.
—E. 10. W.
THE LOCKED DOOR—At the Var
sity Theatre.
We bill It as a good picture- not
one that you shouldn't miss neces
sarily - but one that will afford two
hours of pleasant entertainment.
The a (ting is good and the plot
fast, in fact almost too fast.
The story concerns itself with a
gay young bachelor and the hearts
and homes he has wrecked. Me
picks up his last, innocent little
(lower and finds the girl's brother
and sister-in-law are on his trail.
Sister readies his apartments first,
■but brother breaks in and fires the
fatal bullet.
Rod La Roeque is the debonair
receiver whom every one wants to
choke, but he rises nobly at the
end to clear the guilty man. Bar
bara Stanwyck steals the show and
performs the double heroics of pro
tecting the little flower and shoul
dering the murder. Zasu Pitts fur
nishes the comedy relief as the
telephone operator.
There is a good raid scene on
hoard ship within the twelve-mile
limit and a melodramatic fight in
the apartment for possession of the
gun.
The comedy is good enough—it's
a sentimental affair where hubby
stops his wife's elopement with a
European count, and then magnifi
cently regains her love.
There's two news reels which
give a silent and talkie on Hum
bert marriage to Princess Marie —
all in choice Italian. Ice skating
and yachting, a dog derby in bar
kie, and our own A 1 Smith and
I3abe Ruth playing golf. —H. M.

of ten years' co-operation between

The book is very interesting, and

Rod La Roeque is the debonair
receiver whom every one wants to
choke, but he rises nobly at the
end to clear the guilty man. Bar
bara Stanwyck steals the show and
performs the double heroics of pro
tecting the little flower and shoul
dering the murder. Zasu Pitts fur
nishes the comedy relief as the
telephone operator.
There is a good raid scene on
hoard ship within the twelve-mile
limit and a melodramatic fight in
the apartment for possession of the
gun.
The comedy is good enough—it's
a sentimental affair where hubby
stops his wife's elopement with a
European count, and then magnifi
cently regains her love.
There's two news reels which
give a silent and talkie on Hum
bert marriage to Princess Marie —
all in choice Italian. Ice skating
and yachting, a dog derby in bar
kie, and our own A 1 Smith and
I3abe Ruth playing golf. —H. M.
