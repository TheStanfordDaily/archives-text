The Editor, Sir:
The loss of the basketball game
Saturday night does not begin to
compare with the disappointment
due to the lack of sportsmanship
displayed by the Stanford rooting
section during and after the game.
The Stanford Tradition suffered a
disheartening setback.

The Editor, Sir:
The mighty Board of Athletic
I Control has done many things,
I some approved of, and some that
have met with a great amount of
disfavor. Their latest, offense came
recently in regard to the selling of
rooters' tickets for the Stanford
( California basketball game, played
Saturday night.
Students that go to Stanford

should be given the privilege of
buying the best seats in the Pavil
ion, but apparently the Board of
Athletic Control does not believe
in this, for some of the seats sold
to the students were in row 9. To
many that, means nothing, but to
some of us that means the narrow
aisle in back of the other seats
that lias a board two inches wide
that is numbered and upon which
some are "supposed" to sit. But
unless you are six feet tall, and in
that case your head bumps the
roof, you can see nothing at all.
At the next game between Stan
foul and ('alifornia played in the
Pavilion, it. is hoped that the
B.A.C. will at least, give the stu
dents an even break, but they are
, more anxious, in all probability, to
rake in a few more dollars.
