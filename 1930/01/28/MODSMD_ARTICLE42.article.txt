During the past year various
sporting spectacles on ihe Farm
have been tainted with outbursts
of belligerancy. At times, rivalships
mi the field have degenerated into
open hostilities of flying fisfs.
Only a couple of cool heads
in the crowd that swarmed out
on the hardwood, after last
Saturday's cage fracas had
ended, saved a general riot and
perhaps the life of one referee.
At that, there was a public dis
playal of ungentlemanly catch
as-catch can in the press box.
Yet, :i majority of these same
pugnacious souls, who delight in
undisciplined combative tactics at
unwarranted times, seem fo lack
interest when il comes to legiti
mate swinging of the dukes or
I hat pastime known in minor sport
circles as BOXING.
Which is all wrong—this
student preference of bare
knuckles to the glove, and of
brutal beatings to be saved by
the gong.
Not, that these two-Hated lads
slum Id forsake llie turf, court, or
cinders for the ring, but it would
be most excellent and profitable if
they would try their hand at ex
changing blows on the canvas in
spare times between the other
sporting seasons.
The notorious Shires affair and
the edicts that followed, let it be
known, are confined solely to the
professional industries. Unsubsi
dizod ball players can indulge in
the gentle art of prize-fighting, and
vice-versa, without losing their
self-respect or personal liberty. In
fact, the head men of amateur
sports advocate that very thing—
the game of left hooks and right
jabs—as long as it is done on the
square and in the ring.
True, boxing is far from un
popular at Stanford U., and
through the efforts of Mr.
Harry Maloney the legalized
game of fisticuffs is gaining
interest with rapidity.
Yesterday afternoon the prelim
inary bouts of the all-University
boxing tourney were run off, and
on Thursday night in t lie Pavilion
the pugilistic students who sur
vived will poke af each other in
the finals. Although there will be
no actual bloodshed, except, of
course, for an occasional broken
or bruised proboscis, the finalists
will trip around the canvas with
but one idea in mind —to adminis
ter a knock-out punch.
There have been plenty of
these K.O.'s in the last few
mitt-slinging festivities, and
Thursday night should prove
no exception, as the boys will
be fighting to win some mere
of those glittering, gold, en
graved medals from that re
tired world's titleholder—Mr.
J. J. Tunney.
According to Mr. Maloney, who
coaches the boxing team, when he
finds time from his thousand and
one other instructive jobs, there
is lots of excellent fighting ma
terial hiding around the campus,
potential champs of the socking
racket, who fail to sign up for box
ing because of inferiority com
plexes and other equally unexcus
nble excuses.
What is more, Mr. Maloney
says that his squad is in dire
need of more men, especially
in the heavier classes. He is
most anxious to unearth a bit
of this potential ring timber.
The football eleven, for example,
Itemed with first-class pugilistic
prospects last fall. Some of the
grid stalwarts were big, strong
lellows, to say the least. And box
ing is just the thing for them for
development, training, and to bet
tor playing.
Johnny Preston, thinks the
Card fisticuff mentor, would
make a real fighter. Herb
Fleishhacker would be the
Primo Camera of coast college
competition. Chuck Ehrhorn
would be a second Firpo, a bull
of the campus. Pete Heiser
would be a tough customer.
And so on down the line.
All football coaches advocate
boxing for (heir men, and at other
institutions of higher learning a
good percentage of the gridders
try out for the fighting squad. Lorn,
Beckett, Gill, Cahn, Higgenbottem,
and a number of others at Cal are
acling in the capacity of pugs over
1 lie winter months.
The Cards are no more dainty
than these bruisers!

vived will poke af each other in
the finals. Although there will be
no actual bloodshed, except, of
course, for an occasional broken
or bruised proboscis, the finalists
will trip around the canvas with
but one idea in mind —to adminis
ter a knock-out punch.
There have been plenty of
these K.O.'s in the last few
mitt-slinging festivities, and
Thursday night should prove
no exception, as the boys will
be fighting to win some mere
of those glittering, gold, en
graved medals from that re
tired world's titleholder—Mr.
J. J. Tunney.
According to Mr. Maloney, who
coaches the boxing team, when he
finds time from his thousand and
one other instructive jobs, there
is lots of excellent fighting ma
terial hiding around the campus,
potential champs of the socking
racket, who fail to sign up for box
ing because of inferiority com
plexes and other equally unexcus
nble excuses.
What is more, Mr. Maloney
says that his squad is in dire
need of more men, especially
in the heavier classes. He is
most anxious to unearth a bit
of this potential ring timber.
The football eleven, for example,
Itemed with first-class pugilistic
prospects last fall. Some of the
grid stalwarts were big, strong
lellows, to say the least. And box
ing is just the thing for them for
development, training, and to bet
tor playing.
Johnny Preston, thinks the
Card fisticuff mentor, would
make a real fighter. Herb
Fleishhacker would be the
Primo Camera of coast college
competition. Chuck Ehrhorn
would be a second Firpo, a bull
of the campus. Pete Heiser
would be a tough customer.
And so on down the line.
All football coaches advocate
boxing for (heir men, and at other
institutions of higher learning a
good percentage of the gridders
try out for the fighting squad. Lorn,
Beckett, Gill, Cahn, Higgenbottem,
and a number of others at Cal are
acling in the capacity of pugs over
1 lie winter months.
The Cards are no more dainty
than these bruisers!

During the past year various
sporting spectacles on ihe Farm
have been tainted with outbursts
of belligerancy. At times, rivalships
mi the field have degenerated into
open hostilities of flying fisfs.
Only a couple of cool heads
in the crowd that swarmed out
on the hardwood, after last
Saturday's cage fracas had
ended, saved a general riot and
perhaps the life of one referee.
At that, there was a public dis
playal of ungentlemanly catch
as-catch can in the press box.
Yet, :i majority of these same
pugnacious souls, who delight in
undisciplined combative tactics at
unwarranted times, seem fo lack
interest when il comes to legiti
mate swinging of the dukes or
I hat pastime known in minor sport
circles as BOXING.
Which is all wrong—this
student preference of bare
knuckles to the glove, and of
brutal beatings to be saved by
the gong.
Not, that these two-Hated lads
slum Id forsake llie turf, court, or
cinders for the ring, but it would
be most excellent and profitable if
they would try their hand at ex
changing blows on the canvas in
spare times between the other
sporting seasons.
The notorious Shires affair and
the edicts that followed, let it be
known, are confined solely to the
professional industries. Unsubsi
dizod ball players can indulge in
the gentle art of prize-fighting, and
vice-versa, without losing their
self-respect or personal liberty. In
fact, the head men of amateur
sports advocate that very thing—
the game of left hooks and right
jabs—as long as it is done on the
square and in the ring.
True, boxing is far from un
popular at Stanford U., and
through the efforts of Mr.

During the past year various
sporting spectacles on ihe Farm
have been tainted with outbursts
of belligerancy. At times, rivalships
mi the field have degenerated into
open hostilities of flying fisfs.
Only a couple of cool heads
in the crowd that swarmed out
on the hardwood, after last
Saturday's cage fracas had
ended, saved a general riot and
perhaps the life of one referee.
At that, there was a public dis
playal of ungentlemanly catch
as-catch can in the press box.
Yet, :i majority of these same
pugnacious souls, who delight in
undisciplined combative tactics at
unwarranted times, seem fo lack
interest when il comes to legiti
mate swinging of the dukes or
I hat pastime known in minor sport
circles as BOXING.
Which is all wrong—this
student preference of bare
knuckles to the glove, and of
brutal beatings to be saved by
the gong.
Not, that these two-Hated lads
slum Id forsake llie turf, court, or
cinders for the ring, but it would
be most excellent and profitable if
they would try their hand at ex
changing blows on the canvas in
spare times between the other
sporting seasons.
The notorious Shires affair and
the edicts that followed, let it be
known, are confined solely to the
professional industries. Unsubsi
dizod ball players can indulge in
the gentle art of prize-fighting, and
vice-versa, without losing their
self-respect or personal liberty. In
fact, the head men of amateur
sports advocate that very thing—
the game of left hooks and right
jabs—as long as it is done on the
square and in the ring.
True, boxing is far from un
popular at Stanford U., and
through the efforts of Mr.
Harry Maloney the legalized
game of fisticuffs is gaining
interest with rapidity.
Yesterday afternoon the prelim
inary bouts of the all-University
boxing tourney were run off, and
on Thursday night in t lie Pavilion
the pugilistic students who sur
vived will poke af each other in
the finals. Although there will be
no actual bloodshed, except, of
course, for an occasional broken
or bruised proboscis, the finalists
will trip around the canvas with
but one idea in mind —to adminis
ter a knock-out punch.
There have been plenty of
these K.O.'s in the last few
mitt-slinging festivities, and
Thursday night should prove
no exception, as the boys will
be fighting to win some mere
of those glittering, gold, en
graved medals from that re
tired world's titleholder—Mr.
J. J. Tunney.
According to Mr. Maloney, who
coaches the boxing team, when he
finds time from his thousand and
one other instructive jobs, there
is lots of excellent fighting ma
terial hiding around the campus,
potential champs of the socking
racket, who fail to sign up for box
ing because of inferiority com
plexes and other equally unexcus
nble excuses.
What is more, Mr. Maloney
says that his squad is in dire
need of more men, especially
in the heavier classes. He is
most anxious to unearth a bit
of this potential ring timber.
The football eleven, for example,
Itemed with first-class pugilistic
prospects last fall. Some of the
grid stalwarts were big, strong
lellows, to say the least. And box
ing is just the thing for them for
development, training, and to bet
tor playing.
Johnny Preston, thinks the
Card fisticuff mentor, would
make a real fighter. Herb
Fleishhacker would be the
Primo Camera of coast college
competition. Chuck Ehrhorn
would be a second Firpo, a bull
of the campus. Pete Heiser
would be a tough customer.
And so on down the line.
All football coaches advocate
boxing for (heir men, and at other
institutions of higher learning a
good percentage of the gridders
try out for the fighting squad. Lorn,
Beckett, Gill, Cahn, Higgenbottem,
and a number of others at Cal are
acling in the capacity of pugs over
1 lie winter months.
The Cards are no more dainty
than these bruisers!
