# Track Records Doomed In Mural Meet
## FINALS IN TRACK, FIELD TO BE RUN OFF TOMORROW Hables, Hubbard, Threaten 440 Mark; LaBorde Excels in Shot 
### 
Several records seem doomed to
| extinction in the finals of the iiitra
! mural track and field meet to be held
| tomorrow afternoon.
The previous 440 mark of 52 2-5
| seconds has already been badly shat
| tered in Friday's trials, Les Hables ol
j Breakers going around the oval in
! 51 4-5 seconds, and Mill Hubbard of
j K1 Toro making the circuit in 51
I flat. When these two, together with
I Eastman of Encina 2E who was but a
i few strides behind Hubbard on Fri
day, meet tomorrow afternoon there
should be no danger of the stop
watches having to work overtime.
"Here" Laborde needs but to bet
j fer his trial mark with the shot by
i four inches to erase from flic records
I the 43-foot 3-inch toss of Eric Krcnz
I set in 1926. Another F1 Toro—Brcak-
J ers battle, featuring Hubbard and
I Goldsmith, may advance the present
| javelin record of 170 feet.

the 120-vard race in better than 16
seconds, the existing record. As Nis
bet will also run the low hurdles and
a lap in the relay, he may not feel

! mural track and field meet to be held
| tomorrow afternoon.
The previous 440 mark of 52 2-5
| seconds has already been badly shat
| tered in Friday's trials, Les Hables ol
j Breakers going around the oval in
! 51 4-5 seconds, and Mill Hubbard of
j K1 Toro making the circuit in 51
I flat. When these two, together with
I Eastman of Encina 2E who was but a
i few strides behind Hubbard on Fri
day, meet tomorrow afternoon there
should be no danger of the stop
watches having to work overtime.
"Here" Laborde needs but to bet
j fer his trial mark with the shot by
i four inches to erase from flic records
I the 43-foot 3-inch toss of Eric Krcnz
I set in 1926. Another F1 Toro—Brcak-
J ers battle, featuring Hubbard and
I Goldsmith, may advance the present
| javelin record of 170 feet.
Among the timber-toppers AI Nis
bet of Delta Tan Delta should cover
the 120-vard race in better than 16
seconds, the existing record. As Nis
bet will also run the low hurdles and
a lap in the relay, he may not feel
anxious to unnecessarily exert him
self, but even with this program Nis
bet should hang up a record in the |
highs.
