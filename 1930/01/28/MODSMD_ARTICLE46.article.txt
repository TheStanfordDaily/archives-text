# NO MORE LIKE HIM....
## Stanislaus Klecal, Alias Stanley Ketchel, Fought at Any Time, At Any Place, Against Anyone 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Tf Stanley Ketchel were alive to-'
day and in his prime as a lighter,
he would hold the world's middle
weight, light-heavyweight, and
heavyweight titles. Maybe you
think that that's an exaggerated
statement. Maybe you think that.
time has made glamorous the repu
tation of this remarkable fighter
beyond all proportion to his real
ability. Maybe you think that, 1
thrown into the ring with a
Mickey Walker, a Tommy Lough
ran, or a Max Schmeling, Ketchell
would be badly defeated and put ,
in his proper place as just a good,
willing, two-fisted fighter who was
highly over-rated as a champion
among champions.
Maybe you think so, but T don't.
1 think that Stanislaus Klecal,
otherwise known as Stanley Ket
chel, was one of the fightingest
fools who ever laced on a glove,
and that he could not only show ,
these modern champs a thing or
two about the power of the punch,
but also about not caring what the
other fellow weighed, what color
he was, or how the purse was
split. Ketchel was one of the most

i popular prize-fighters who ever'
lived. In less than seven years he \
had beaten all the best, fighters of \
the middleweight and light-heavy-1
weight class, and had knocked
down huge Jack Johnson, fo whom
he gave a handicap of 65 pounds!
The fighting Pole scored 44 knock
outs in r»S ring battles, and won ten
other bouts. He was knocked out
i by liillv Papke, the Illinois Thun
derbolt, on September 8, 15)08, and
regained his middleweight crown
on Thanksgiving Day the same
year by knocking out his con
queror in the eleventh, after giv
ing him a terrible beating. He was
shot to death in a quarrel in Octo-
I ber 1910.
Just one more thing in closing.
The other day, in Los Angeles,
James J. Braddock got $7,500 for
losing a decision to Yale Okun. On
Labor Day, 1007. Stanley Ketchel
| knocked out Joe Thomas in as
thrilling a bout as ever was fought.
He was floored twenty times, while
Thomas was flattened on thirty oc
casions. And the winner's purse
for that Homeric championship
1 struggle was only $7,500!

beyond all proportion to his real
ability. Maybe you think that, 1
thrown into the ring with a
Mickey Walker, a Tommy Lough
ran, or a Max Schmeling, Ketchell
would be badly defeated and put ,
in his proper place as just a good,
willing, two-fisted fighter who was
highly over-rated as a champion
among champions.
Maybe you think so, but T don't.
1 think that Stanislaus Klecal,
otherwise known as Stanley Ket
chel, was one of the fightingest
fools who ever laced on a glove,
and that he could not only show ,
these modern champs a thing or
two about the power of the punch,
but also about not caring what the
other fellow weighed, what color
he was, or how the purse was
split. Ketchel was one of the most

i popular prize-fighters who ever'
lived. In less than seven years he \
had beaten all the best, fighters of \
the middleweight and light-heavy-1
weight class, and had knocked
down huge Jack Johnson, fo whom
he gave a handicap of 65 pounds!
The fighting Pole scored 44 knock
outs in r»S ring battles, and won ten
other bouts. He was knocked out
i by liillv Papke, the Illinois Thun
derbolt, on September 8, 15)08, and
regained his middleweight crown
on Thanksgiving Day the same
year by knocking out his con
queror in the eleventh, after giv
ing him a terrible beating. He was
shot to death in a quarrel in Octo-
I ber 1910.
Just one more thing in closing.
The other day, in Los Angeles,
James J. Braddock got $7,500 for
losing a decision to Yale Okun. On
Labor Day, 1007. Stanley Ketchel
| knocked out Joe Thomas in as
thrilling a bout as ever was fought.
He was floored twenty times, while
Thomas was flattened on thirty oc
casions. And the winner's purse
for that Homeric championship
1 struggle was only $7,500!

Tf Stanley Ketchel were alive to-'
day and in his prime as a lighter,
he would hold the world's middle
weight, light-heavyweight, and
heavyweight titles. Maybe you
think that that's an exaggerated
statement. Maybe you think that.
