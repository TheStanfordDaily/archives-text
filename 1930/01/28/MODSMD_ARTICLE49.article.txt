â€¢Hunt's varsity cagers will swing!
into action against the Olympic i
Clu 1) five tonight at 8 o'clock in
the Farm Pavilion in their first j
game of a comeback campaign.
Although not in tlie best of
spirits after losing Saturday's tilt 1
1 o the Golden Bears of Berkeley,'
the Cards went through a stiff
workout yesterday afternoon to ;
polish up a few rough spots on of
fense and defense that contributed
largely to their downfall at the'
hands of the Blue and Gold quin-;
tet.
Coach Hunt and every man on
his squad believe that Stanford
will come out on top when the
Cards and Bears next, tangle on
the court. If the Farm lad's defense ;
functions as it should in keeping j
Hie long, lanky pair of Bear for
wards, Messrs. Tripp and Pursel, j
away from the basket, there is no '
reason why Hunt's men can not
take the Bears.' measure in the
final two contests of the Big Series.
Then, too, Hunt feels that his boys
will have a little more luck at lo
cating Ihe hoop on the future hard
wood meetings.
Clubmen Good
However, the comeback road will
be a hard grind for tlie Cards, as
! every game on the schedule from
now on is with a topnotch team.
; The Post Street aggregation that
faces Stanford tonight, is no excep
| tion, as the Club live has been
I winning a good percentage of its
j games to date. Included in the list
1 of victories is a 52 to 26 win over
j the San Jose Golds the last week
! end.
Yet the Winged O team is not
i unbeatable, as California handed
! the Clubmen a setback two weeks
! ago. And if the Cards profit by
\ their mistakes in Saturday's de
feat, they may well be able to clialk
! up their first win since taking the
i opener of the Trojan series down
; in the land of Troy.
Hunt is starting his regular line
up tonight with the exception of
I Tyler for Fawcett, as the latter is
| not in shape to last a full game.
