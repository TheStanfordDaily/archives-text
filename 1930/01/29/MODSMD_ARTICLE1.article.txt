### 
"Keep I lie soft pedal on campus
politics" was ilu- watchword of the
Executive Committee last night
when Stanford's governing council
rejected a proposal that t lie
A.S.S.IT. sponsor a general student
political meeting preceding eacli
elect ion.
An open mass meeting where
each candidate for office should he
introduced and his campus history
recalled were the features of a
plan suggested by Irwin Warner,
'30. Warner's proposal w;is defeat
ed because of general opinion that
such a gathering might easily de
generate into a l'arcial skirmish
between rival political groups.
"Stanford has traditionally
frowned on electioneering and un
due political activity" declared one
committeeman. The committee
finally expressed itself in favor of
continuing the present custom of
publishing names of candidates in
the Stanford Daily.
A motion to abolish the bonfire
was defeated by a vote of five to
two. The Rally Committee was re
quested to submit a plan by which
nil future Big Game rallies could
be patterned.
Following a brief address by
Betty Alden, president of the
Y.W.C.A., who outlined the condi
tions among students in Bulgaria,
the committee authorized an offi
cial A.S.S.I*, drive to solicit funds
to aid the Bulgarians.
Climaxing several weeks of dis
cussion regarding the inadequacy
of the A.S.S.C. constitution, a re
visional committee was authorized
which will be appointed by Presi
dent Steinbeck. Petitions from
rifle and handball teams for a
monogram award were referred to
the revising committee.
