"112 ianii's in which 25 participate and
sonic 25,000 watch d<> not represent
the German ideal of physical train
ing," stated Dr. Friedrich Schoenc
mann, last night's lecturer, in an in
terview v\ith the Daily. Dr. Schoenc
niann is professor of the history of
American literature and civilization
at the University of Berlin.
"Individual skill and team perfec
tion are valued more highly in Ger
many than the mere capture of vic
tory," the educator continued. "What
few intercollegiate contests are held
are not performed with an objective
of showmanship, but for testing indi
vidual merit. This type of compe
tition is carried on, because the de
fects of a great athletic program such
as is common in \tncrica arc recog

nized and considered undesirable.
Dr. Schoencmann pointed out that
'university life in his country, as ev
! erywherc, is changing, and humor
j ously spoke of foreigners who visit
| Heidelberg and spend their time look
' ing for a student prince, a character
i who can no longer be found in such
; higher institutions.
"Activities, which play such an im
' portant part in the life of the under
'graduate in the United States, arc not
J recognized or carried on to any ex
tent iu German universities," re
marked the professor, in touching
upon a subject of current interest on
the Stanford campus. "The American
1 system seems very desirable, but id
. our schools students who similarly
j develop their individual interests do
I so without supervision of the univer
, sit\ or connection wtili it."
