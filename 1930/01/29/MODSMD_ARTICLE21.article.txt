1 Tlioft, of several automobiles on
the campus and in Palo Alto re
cently has caused Fred Frehe, cam
pus deputy sheriff, to advise car
owners to louk their machines
when they are parked.
"Car thefts have been growing
numerous of late," he said, "and
only by locking their cars can
drivers help us curb this activity."
The most recent prize of thieves
is an Auburn cabriolet belonging
to Florence Skipp, which was
stolen from a parking area near
the Union last night. A Chrysler
roadster belonging to Virgil Dow
' ell, '30, varsity broad-jumper, which
was taken Sunday evening in Palo
Alto near the Varsity theatre, was
found by police a few hours later
near, the highway polo field with
two tires blown out.
Charles Parker McHarry lost a
; Hudson coach from the drive in
front of Encina Hall late Sunday
1 night.
Stolen from in front of Fncina
Hall early Monday morning,
i Charles P. McHarry's Hudson
coach was discovered yesterday
> noon in an alley next to the Palo
Alto Women's Clubhouse, by Cor
don Irving, Dorothy Ulrici, and an
other Stanford student, who were
i returning home tor lunch.
The car had evidently been taken
for a "joy-ride." Although the gaso
