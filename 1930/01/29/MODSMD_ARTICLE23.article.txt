## 
### 
An iiH(|iU'iicli;i|j|e spirit was
demons!rated by the class of
yeste rday noon when tho
first-year men survived two
severe drenchings from above
and managed to stand still
long enough for their Quad
picture. The residents of 1011-
cina were standing on the ha.ll
steps posing for their photo
graph at the time of the de
luge, which came out of a
clear sky in a paper bag.
Their enthusiasm only slight
ly dampened, the freshmen
were soon prepared again for
the shot: Then came the sec
ond downpour. The ranks
broke, and confusion reigned
for a few minutes. The photo
grapher, with the use of
sturdy lungs and an expres
sive vocabulary, finally se
cured the group's co-operation
long enough to take his pic
tures.
