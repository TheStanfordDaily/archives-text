Speaking of the new democracy
in Germany, Dr. Schoenemann
said: "German democracy of today
has yet to be worked out. The new
government, of public opinion, ex
perimental though it is, is better
by far than the old government of
force, of sheer strength, and of
clubbing.
"Universities in Germany stand
for national-mindedness. As state
institutions they do not fail in their
duties to the nation. They serve
as a counter-weight to all experi
mentation in the New Germany,"
he said. "The German universities
are not to be considered reaction
ary. Complications are tlie order
throughout the world. In fact, the
whole idea of University education
has become problematical."
