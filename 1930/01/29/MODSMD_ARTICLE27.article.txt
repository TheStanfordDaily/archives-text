# CARDS DOWN OLYMPIC CLUB 34 TO 30 IN ROUGH TILT
## Stanford Quintet Shows A Marked Improvement Since Defeat by U.C. McCandless Takes Scoring Honors for Redshirts With Nine Point Total 
### 
Matching a desperate last minute
Olympic Club rally with an offen
sive spurt of its own, the Cardinal
varsity basketball live defeated a
hard-charging I'osl Street aggrega
tion by a score of 1,4 to 30 last
night at the Pavilion in a rough
court, battle.
Playing a flashy brand of ball at
times, the Cards displayed no lit
tle improvement over their show
ing in the Cal setback last, week
end. Although Coach Husky Hunt'.;
men started out slowly and mis
handled the ball on a number of
occasions, there was no compari
son between the two teams and
only tuogh luck at locating the
hoop kept the Farm quintet from
piling up a much larger score.
First Half Close
The first half was nip-and tuck,
being featured by the. close guard
ing of both outfits. Neither team
was able to break through for
sucker 51i0!.., though Long John
McCandless, Card center, tipped in
a couple of shots from within the
foul line. The lead see sawed back
and forth, with (he score being tied
at five all, seven to seven, and
eleven all.
McCandless put Stanford out in
front and Tyler followed up with a.
foul tip to give Hunt's men a Hi to
14 margin as the first period came
to a close.
Breaking fast on offense, the
Cards played a good floor game at,
the start of the second half to pile
ui> a seven-point lead over the
Winged () five in quick fashion.
Several times the Farm boys
worked the ball down the court
under the basket, where McCand
less, who had an off night at find
ing the hoop, batted in a couple of
field goals.
Plenty of Fouls
Then the Club team fired up a
bit and the going began to get
ample rough, Both Holmgren,
Olympic pivot man, and Don Tyler,
Card forward, were tossed out of
the game on personal fouls. The
fumble-fest did not. last long, how
ever, as Hunt yanked Captain
llothert to give the Kedshirt cen
ter a much-needed rest.
With llothert on the sidelines,
the Farm quintet's defense crum
pled, and the Club squad looped
in live points in short order to nar
row down the Stanford lead to 28
to 26. Taking no chances, Hunt in
jected llothert back in the lineup,
and the Cards managed to increase
their margin two points as the
game ended.
Wilson, Okerberg
Wilson, at guard, and Okerberg.
lanky forward, were outstanding
i for the Post Street, team. Besides
playing a clever floor game and
successfully keeping the Card for
wards from sneaking in the hole
for set-ups, Wilson connected with
two baskets from the renter of the
floor, tying Okerberg for Club
high point honors with nine tallie .
For Stanford, Mike Reynolds
stood out with some improved de
fensive play and a good night hi
hitting the basket. Paired with
llothert, Reynolds gave the Winged
i() offensive guns plenty of trouble
| in working the ball in close, at-, a
1 consequence of which the Club
I players were hard pressed.

playing a clever floor game and
successfully keeping the Card for
wards from sneaking in the hole
for set-ups, Wilson connected with
two baskets from the renter of the
floor, tying Okerberg for Club
high point honors with nine tallie .
For Stanford, Mike Reynolds
stood out with some improved de
fensive play and a good night hi
hitting the basket. Paired with
llothert, Reynolds gave the Winged

Matching a desperate last minute
Olympic Club rally with an offen
sive spurt of its own, the Cardinal
varsity basketball live defeated a
hard-charging I'osl Street aggrega
tion by a score of 1,4 to 30 last
night at the Pavilion in a rough
court, battle.
Playing a flashy brand of ball at
times, the Cards displayed no lit
tle improvement over their show
ing in the Cal setback last, week
end. Although Coach Husky Hunt'.;
men started out slowly and mis
handled the ball on a number of
occasions, there was no compari
son between the two teams and
only tuogh luck at locating the
hoop kept the Farm quintet from
piling up a much larger score.
First Half Close
The first half was nip-and tuck,
being featured by the. close guard
ing of both outfits. Neither team
was able to break through for
sucker 51i0!.., though Long John
McCandless, Card center, tipped in
a couple of shots from within the
foul line. The lead see sawed back
and forth, with (he score being tied
at five all, seven to seven, and
eleven all.
McCandless put Stanford out in
front and Tyler followed up with a.
foul tip to give Hunt's men a Hi to
14 margin as the first period came
to a close.
Breaking fast on offense, the
Cards played a good floor game at,
the start of the second half to pile
ui> a seven-point lead over the
Winged () five in quick fashion.
Several times the Farm boys
worked the ball down the court
under the basket, where McCand
less, who had an off night at find
ing the hoop, batted in a couple of
field goals.
Plenty of Fouls
Then the Club team fired up a
bit and the going began to get
ample rough, Both Holmgren,
Olympic pivot man, and Don Tyler,
Card forward, were tossed out of
the game on personal fouls. The
fumble-fest did not. last long, how
ever, as Hunt yanked Captain
llothert to give the Kedshirt cen
ter a much-needed rest.
With llothert on the sidelines,
the Farm quintet's defense crum
pled, and the Club squad looped
in live points in short order to nar
row down the Stanford lead to 28
to 26. Taking no chances, Hunt in
jected llothert back in the lineup,
and the Cards managed to increase
their margin two points as the
game ended.
