# THE 						Y.M.C.A. SEES LIGHT
## 
### 
Stanford's polliwog of former days lias apparently passed out
of existence, for there is now a rejuvenated Y.M.C.A. on the cam
pus, according to the information contained in that organization's
report for the Autumn Ouarter published yesterday.
Xo longer is the "Y" merely content to preach service and save
freshmen from the ha/avdous days ol ( itizenship courses. It has
launched a practical program of constructive work. This Associa
tion, which received many criticisms in past Ijaii.y editorial col
umns, some of which were justifiable and others of which were fod
der for the editorial cannon, has unostentatiously been practicing the
past c|uarter what it preaches— service. Ihe various commendable
projects which the Association put through can be found in the
story of its report elsewhere iu today's paper. ( hitstanding among
its activities were: providing a "room listing" service for the seven
cr eight hundred students who must live olf campus ; aiding students
of different nationalities to orient themselves on the campus; aiding
in the creation of the Vocational < luidance Committee; and working
on the project of placing an illuminated map of the world in a stra
tegic place on the campus to graphically depict for the students the
places where events of the day are occurring.
Such acts as these have been of practical service to Stanford, and
by such acts the Association is not only making itsell a worth-while
organization but is functioning for the iirst time as it should on 111i
campus. Only through the continuation ol a practical program of
this nature can the \ .M.l A. hope to gain the interest and respect
of the student bodv, a desire that i vet \ near its heart. If the Asso
ciation continues in its present trend il will receive the support of
the students.
I lowever, if the Y.M.C.A. does not concentrate on fulfilling the
everyday needs on this campus and goes up in the clouds of theory
again and fails to get the response from the campus that it should,
then it should be killed as <|iiielly and as humanely as was the
"Stanford Lit."

campus. Only through the continuation ol a practical program of
this nature can the \ .M.l A. hope to gain the interest and respect
of the student bodv, a desire that i vet \ near its heart. If the Asso
ciation continues in its present trend il will receive the support of
the students.
I lowever, if the Y.M.C.A. does not concentrate on fulfilling the
everyday needs on this campus and goes up in the clouds of theory
again and fails to get the response from the campus that it should,
then it should be killed as <|iiielly and as humanely as was the
"Stanford Lit."
