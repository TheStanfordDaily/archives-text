# A 						JOB! MY KINGDOM FOR A JOB!

### 
The four-year vacation of the younger generation, commonly,
called higher education at some college or university, is drawing to
a close and in June the large majority of Stanford s graduating class
will face the world in stark reality unprepared and undecided as to
their life profession, fn the attempt to remedy this situation and
repair what seems to the individual a hopeless and discouraging task,
Stanford faculty and student body leaders have taken it upon them
selves to aid the prospective wage earner in his choice of employ
ment.
Instead of the individual .asking "What am I going to be good
for when my undergraduate days have passed:' the I niversity
through the medium of its vocational guidance committees seeks to
find the profession for which the individual is most fitted. \\ ith the
preparation of what is believed an adequate survey ol the professions
now available to students, the I Diversity can now relieve that hope
less feeling possessed by graduating seniors of being a misplaced
cog in the smooth-running machinery of the world.
A Stanford student at the present time can enter a vocation
armed with tacts facts supplied by the Committee on Vocational
(Juidanee and the two sub committees of the»A.S.S.I . and A.W .S.
—and be assured that be has a fair chance of satisfying his wants
with the returns from his chosen field of endeavor.
In the attempt to bring this work closer to the student, Stanford
women will meet in the Women's I lubhouse at o clock Saturday
morning to listen to five well known professional women, authorities 1
in their fields, and come to the realization that the leaves of college
life are fast falling one by one and that the after-Stanford phantom
of pitiful memories is haunting their remaining days. Any member
of the Five Hundred who can shake off the sleepiness from that
Friday night date will do well to attend the meeting and hear such
women as Maude Howell, prominent in world dramatics, and Kath
leen Xorris, writer, address them on the potential value to be derived
from the vocations of drama, writing, personnel work, teaching, and
department store management. I
