### 
The four-year vacation of the younger generation, commonly,
called higher education at some college or university, is drawing to
a close and in June the large majority of Stanford s graduating class
will face the world in stark reality unprepared and undecided as to
their life profession, fn the attempt to remedy this situation and
repair what seems to the individual a hopeless and discouraging task,
Stanford faculty and student body leaders have taken it upon them

life are fast falling one by one and that the after-Stanford phantom
of pitiful memories is haunting their remaining days. Any member
of the Five Hundred who can shake off the sleepiness from that
Friday night date will do well to attend the meeting and hear such
women as Maude Howell, prominent in world dramatics, and Kath
