ASPECTS OF BIOGRAPHY. By
Andre Maurois. New York: D.
Appteton & Co. 1929.
Maurois, author of Disraeli and
oT Acrid, The Life of Shelley, is
recognized to he one of the great
est of modern biographers. In this
hook, which consists of six lec
tures recently delivered by him at
Cambridge, he presents his views
upon the various types and pur
poses of his chosen field of litera
ture.
Maurois is sympathetic with tlie
modern ideal of truth; he also de
mands that, biography shall be
artistically beautiful, and a large
portion of the book is devoted to
an attempt, at the reconciliation of
these two ideals. He admits that
it. is a most difficult feat; I do not
believe that he, or any other writer,
will ever accomplish it.
As tiie author says, it would be |
impossible for any man to give th"
truth about his own life. So it.
seems to me that a biographer can
do no more than to create a char
acter upon the framework of facts
which are known of his hero. Over
the novelist he has no advantage
except the interest which attaches
to the deeds of a famous man.
At. any rate, one must agree with
Maurois that, whatever form bio
graphy may take in the future, it
will always be a difficult form of
art.
Very interesting is the account
of how he happened to write the

life of Shelley and, later, that of
Disraeli, lie explains tliiit Shelley
interested him because he had
goYie through much the same emo
tions as that poet, and in the bio
graphy felt that he could find a
means of expression for himself.
Of Acrid he says, "1 do not like
the book any longer. In my eyes it
is spoiled by the ironic tone which
came from the fact that the irony
was aimed by myself at myself. 1
wanted to kill the romantic in me;
and, in order to do it, I scoffed at
It. in Shelley, but I loved it while
I scoffed."
In Disraeli he found a romantic,
also a man of action, who failed in
the spiritual sense. Further, he had
a means of presenting a political
idea] of democratic conservatism.
And, at the present time, Maurois
adds, he is considering the life of
a romantic who became reconciled
with the serenity of philosophy.
For this, he will probably choose
Goethe or Meredith.
With such ideas, it is obvious
that Maurois is much more of the
artistic, than the scientific school.
One wonders if it is for the best
that lie tries to reconcile the two;
but as lie says in conclusion: "We
demand of if (biography) the
scrupulosity of science and the en
chantments of art, the perceptible
truth of the novel, and the learned
falsehoods of history. Much pru
rience and tact, are required lo con
coct this unstable mixture."
