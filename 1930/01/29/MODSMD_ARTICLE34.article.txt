Duae's Choice
In Ihe leading role of "La Locan
j diera" (the original title of "The
: Mistress of the Inn") Duse ap
peared in June, 1905, at the Wal
j dorf Theatre, in one of her few
comedy parts. Although she will go

tragic actress, critics who saw her
in the charming part of Mirando
lina declare that the great actress
cast, her most potent spell in "La
j Locandiera."
Given in Italian, with Ettore
Mazzanti playing opposite Duse in
the part of the Marquis of Forlipo
poli, the production achieved great
success, both because of Duse's tri
umph in the part of Mirandolina

) and because of the immediate

i pretending style.
Described by a contemporary i
critic tis "a dainty rogue" in the
I role, Duse won her audiences with 1
her charming coquetry. Although

archness usually exhibited on the

Given in Italian, with Ettore

Described by a contemporary i
critic tis "a dainty rogue" in the
