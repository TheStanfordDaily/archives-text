new impetus. The meeting room is
open to all students who care to
lounge there, especially those living in

Of the many services rendered by
the Association, an outstanding one
is that of assisting students, particu
larly transfers, in finding living ac
commodations in private homes on the
campus or in i'alo Alto. A large per
centage of these students secure their
rooms through this service, and as
many as 65 were taken care of in one
day last quarter. Separate from this
service, the"V" during registration
each fall in the Administration Build
ing maintains a general information
service which proves of real value to
the new men and foreign students
puzzled in the process of registration,
the report states.
Another big success of the Associ
ation was the annual fall cabinet re
treat held at the camp on Kescadcro
( reek, where K. M. I laves, executive

Benjamin h*. Culver, executive secre
tary, yesterday issued the quarterly
report of the Association.
Opening the quarter in its new
home in the lobby of the Old Union,
the Association began its work with a
new impetus. The meeting room is
open to all students who care to
lounge there, especially those living in
Palo Alto, and campus organizations
may secure the room for meetings.
Of the many services rendered by
the Association, an outstanding one
is that of assisting students, particu
larly transfers, in finding living ac
commodations in private homes on the
campus or in i'alo Alto. A large per
centage of these students secure their
rooms through this service, and as
many as 65 were taken care of in one
day last quarter. Separate from this
service, the"V" during registration
each fall in the Administration Build
ing maintains a general information
service which proves of real value to
the new men and foreign students
puzzled in the process of registration,
the report states.
Another big success of the Associ
ation was the annual fall cabinet re
