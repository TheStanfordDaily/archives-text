ENFEEBLED MAN POWER
Man Power on the Farm is
becoming more enfeebled each
year!
At least, this statement, which
Ml fir.st glance seems rather start
ling, is Hie humble opinion of no
lew of the various athletic he;uls
down in the B.A.C. mansion.
And almost any of us common
blokes about the campus cannot
but realize its truth when we take
time out to compare the athletic
roster of Stanford IT. to the
lengthy roll calls at other institu
tions high in Coast college compe
tition.
Not that the situation is ac
tually acute, but, without
doubt, the manpower has
grown decrepit to some extent
in the last couple of years!
Dry bit lis might venture to say
that this is a most excellent thing,
for after all we come to fcollege
to gel an education. And Stanford
is up among the elite when it
comes to high scholastic standings.
But, then, an education de
void of activities, especially
those forms of body-building
pastimes, is detrimental as well
as one-sided. A keen mind
housed in a sickly hulk is like
a first-rate jockey on a broken
down plug. Neither of them
get very far!
Some will ask as lo where we
pel this weakling stuff. And point
oul our football team, the squad
of stalwarts who cavort around
the gridiron for Mr. (Jlenn Scobey
Wa rner.
True, there is enough man
power on the Farm to make a
number of good pigskin-pack
ing elevens. But when some of
the other sports are consid
ered, nearly all minor sports
for example, the roll call
verges on being laughable.
Mr. Harry Maloney, in an inter
view to the Daily the other day,
stressed this latter fact, and went
on to show why.
The administration axe that lop
ped off a hundred frosh from the
entrance list not so long ago is
largely I lie "why." For the Junior
College transfers, who go to make
up the deficit, fail as a rule to show
interest in Stanford athletics.
Al all events, 111" J.C. transfer
has not taken bis place in Farm
sport activities as yet!
The other colleges, it seems,
pluck off the junior college
athletes as soon as they ripen
into potential greats. And Stan
ford U. is left holding the sack.
Cal gets five to our one, U.C.L.A.
as many, while U.S.C. scoops off
Hie very cream of the crop. Both
Cal and Troy will owe lots of their
track success to this J.C. harvest.
Which is going to handicap Mr.
Robert L. Templeton most severe
ly. Practically the same may be
said of basketball. Both of the 1 .C.
first string guards are former Jay
sees, while three of the Trojan
regulars graduated from the J.C.
ranks.
Yet, all we common blokes
can do is look to the future
and hope that our Farm man
power gets a sudden dynamic
injection from the land of some
where. But the "gods that be"
—why, they had better get off
the time!
This Maloney person, by the
way, is about the hardest man to
get hold of on the whole campus.
And it is no wonder, for, at pres
ent, he is doing the work of three
or four men.
lie is here, there, and every
where, all day long.
Besides being head coach of
minor sports, and devoting
more than enough time to box
ing and soccer, Mr. Maloney
has charge of corrective gym
classes and the hydropathy in
dustry on the Farm.
This water-cure business is he
coming quite an institution. To do
the thing right, it really takes the
time of one man alone to treat the
numerous injuries and ailments via
steam boxes, sun lamps, and all
the other paraphernalia. Yet, Mr.
Maloney carries on quite well, con
sidering his many other jobs.
It seems that the Farm either
has first class athletic coaches
and assistants or high-priced
parvenus, many of whom spend
their costly time lolling around
th« athletic plant cracking
jokes or out cluttering up the
golf links. The Daily classes
übiquitous Harry high among
the first.
An ordinary man would have
broken down under the strain long
ago. Yes, the "gods that be" had
better get off the dime in more
ways than one!

College transfers, who go to make
up the deficit, fail as a rule to show
interest in Stanford athletics.
Al all events, 111" J.C. transfer

sport activities as yet!
The other colleges, it seems,

athletes as soon as they ripen

is up among the elite when it

Mr. Harry Maloney, in an inter

The administration axe that lop

College transfers, who go to make
up the deficit, fail as a rule to show
interest in Stanford athletics.
Al all events, 111" J.C. transfer
has not taken bis place in Farm
sport activities as yet!
The other colleges, it seems,
pluck off the junior college
athletes as soon as they ripen

ENFEEBLED MAN POWER
Man Power on the Farm is
becoming more enfeebled each
year!
At least, this statement, which
Ml fir.st glance seems rather start
ling, is Hie humble opinion of no
lew of the various athletic he;uls
down in the B.A.C. mansion.
And almost any of us common
blokes about the campus cannot
but realize its truth when we take
time out to compare the athletic
roster of Stanford IT. to the
lengthy roll calls at other institu
tions high in Coast college compe
tition.
Not that the situation is ac
tually acute, but, without
doubt, the manpower has
grown decrepit to some extent
in the last couple of years!
