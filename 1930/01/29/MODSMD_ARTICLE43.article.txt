# Mural Track and Field Meet To Be Held Today
## RELAY MAY PROVE DECISIVE EVENT IN FINAL COMPETITION Breakers, El Toro, Encina 2E, Delts Are Big Contenders 
### Robert Van Etten 
Upon tlie result ol' the relay
may hinge the final outcome of the
intramural track and field meet to
be held this afternoon, starting at
four o'clock.
For with the four strongest
teams- Breakers, El Toro, Encina
210, and Delta Tau Delta —entering
fast quartets in the stick-passing
event, each anchor man will carry
with him the hopes of his group
of placing high in the final stand
ings. And what a battle the relay
. should he! In the last 220-yard
spurt will he matched Eastman,
Hubbard, Howell, Hay, and Hables
wearing the colors of Encina 2E,
El Toro, Helta Tau Delta, Delta
Chi, and Breakers, respectively
all men who art? capable of sensa
tional effort under the impetus of
competition.
Breakers Have Edge
Breakers hold a slight, edge over
their competitors by virtue of quali
fying more men in last Friday's
meet, but this advantage may be
lost because of their weakness in
the distance events, for which no
trials were held. Enterline, 880
man, is Breakers' chief hope in
the long routes. El Toro, also a
prominent contender, is better
represented with Northcote, Car
ley, and Wright, capable of turn
ing in good time in the mile- and
two-mile runs.
Were Stanford students not so
long accustomed to watching wear
ers of the Cardinal break world
records and swamp their opponents
in track and field meets, the times
ancl distances which should be
turned in this afternoon would be
the subject of considerable amaze
ment. The 440 battle among Hub
bard, Hables, and Eastman will
probably be run in little more than
HO fiat —good mid-season time. In
the 100-yard dash, Howell or
Hables should break the tape in
very close to even time. Here La-
Borde's mark of 4:{ feet in the
shot-put, made in the finals Friday,
would make him acceptable on
many a varsity roster.
The time schedule drawn up for
this afternoon's meet is as follows:
4:00 —Pole vault, t high jump,
javelin throw, shot put.
4:10 —100-yard dash.
4:13 —Mile run.
