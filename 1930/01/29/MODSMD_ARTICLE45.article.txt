# THE 						DARK HORSE
## Gene Sarazen, The Dark Horse Golfer of 1930, Who Won the Huge Agua Caliente Purse This Month 
### Feg Murray, '16 
There used to hp a thoroughbred
named Sarazen, who could step
;il<>ng pretty fast in a race when he !
felt like it. I believe there is a
successor to Mrs. W. K. Vander
bilt's gelding now, called Sarazen
11, who is ateo pretty i'ast when
; put into high on the straightaway.
; 15lit the "Dark Horse" of 1030, so
I far al least, is dene Sarazen, the
; golfer, who came from behind in
! the last round to lead the field by
! two strokes in the first annual
| Agua Oaliente open golf tourna- ■
! ment for the largest purse ever put
tip for such an event.
J I drew a cartoon of Sarazen just
j before the U.S. open last summer
! as a Centaur —half-man, half-horse
I—with the remark that Gene was
I 'no relation to Sarazen the race-1
I horse. But now I am beginning to
1 think there is a relation. The way j
Gene galloped around that Agua
i Caliente course to break par by
three strokes and take the lead in

the last round must have made
some of the other contestants think
that Sarazen the horse had been
shipped out to the Agua Caliente
track, had slipped out of his stall
and into knickers, and taken Sara
zen the golfer's place in the tour
nament.
At any rate, Sarazen breezed
around the last round in OS, where
lie had taken a 70 the day before,
and but for a 0 on the tenth hole,
might just as well have had a «'»(».
After Ihe tournament at the Jockey
Club, beyond the first green, three
Mexican senoritas pushed in three
wheelbarrows filled with American
silver dollars. Gene was given a
shovel and told to dig out his
$10,000 first prize! Sarazen the
racehorse never was served oals
like those!
He's a real thoroughbred, this
little Italian-American golfer! Now
if Primo Camera could only lighl
like Sarazen!
