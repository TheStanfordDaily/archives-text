# CARD NINE PLAYS SECOND CONTEST OF SEASON TODAY
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball nine
will take the field for the second
game of the season at 3:15 o'clock
this afternoon on the varsity dia
mond against the Kenealy Seals
team from San Francisco.
In the season's opener last Sat
urday, Coach Wolter tried out
nearly the whole squad, and with
another two days' practice since
then, the Cards should make a
good showing. Although Storey,
who was laid up with a sore arm
last week, is not entirely up to
snuff, Wolter plans to start him
on the mound with Oswill receiv
ing.
The Winter League outfit is of
an unknown quantity, appearing to
be made up of a fe.w old-timers
and several ringers. Croning, a
familiar name in baseball circles
around the bay, will play short for
the visitors, and Johnson, another
Coast Leaguer, will be one of the
fielders. O'Keele will probably pitch
for the Seals, although it is ru
mored that Bud De Meyer may be
in the box.
