ing, according to the announce
ment made yesterday by Coach
Harry Maloney. Final and semi
final bouts, approximately seven
teen in number, will be staged in
the Pavilion beginning at 7:30 to

Student body cards will admit
holders to the fray, while an ad
mission fee of $1 will be charged
the general public. Pete Flanagan
will again referee the bouts, witli
Mort Blackburn, Wells Goodenough
and Chris Curley as judges, and
Fred Frehe as timekeeper.
Some torrid scraps are in store
for the fans Thursday, and at jires
ent the featherweight division,
which includes the only defending
champion in the person of Paul
Maurer, should furnish the fastest
action. Four men, Paul Maurer,
Vance Rodgers, Fred Gist, and
Fred Glover, will battle among
themselves for the prized Tunney
medal, and all of their bouts should
have the audience on their feet
before the final bell.
