# INDEPENDENT PLAN IS EVALUATED BY STUDENT LEADERS
## Ingraham, Jacobson Tell Of Success In Use Of Study 
### 
Advantages of the independent
study plan, under which 15 stu
dents are now carrying on work
iit Stanford, have been pointed out
hy Alien Ingraham and IJave Jacob
son, the two students to graduate
last quarter under tile direction of
Professor Robinson, director of the
depart blent.
In giving her opinion of the idea,
Miss Ingraham said: "The princi
pal advantage that I found in inde
pendent study was that I was able
to get into the heart and spirit of
iny subject, and since I was work
ing on iny own initiative and in
closer contact with professors, that
the study held more interest than
it would have under the class sys
tem. It seems to me that the ideal
scheme is to carry on about half
of one's work under independent
study so that interest will be welU
balanced and one will not lose
class associations."
Capacity Doubled
l);ive Jacobson, in expressing his
approval of the plan, said: "My ex
perience is that more can be ac
complished in a year under inde
pendent study than in two years
under the class system, since a
person has the opportunity to fig
ure out his own problems and
learns to think for himself. liy

one oral examination at the end
of the year, it seemed that I could
retain more material when I was
not concentrating 011 specific facts
for which I would soon be held re
sponsible in written exams."
According to Professor Robin

crease in the number of students
going into the work in the social
