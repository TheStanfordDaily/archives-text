# FROSH CAGERS DOWN GALILEO HIGH EASILY BY SCORE OF 29 TO 16
## 
### 
Holding their opponents to a single
held goal during the Final three quar
ters of the game, the Stanford fresh
man cage team defeated Galileo High
last night in the Pavilion, 29-16. At
half time the yearlings led, 17-11.
Slow in starting, the Card babes
saw Galileo pile up a 10-3 lead at the
start of the second quarter, but the
substitution of Meade for Cordry at
lor ward started a rally which forged
the frosh into the lead.
Kdcleti, with four Field and
two foul shots, walked off with high
point honors of the contest, with
Meade and Palmer each scoring six
points to trail the leader. Kdclen
turned in one of the best games he
lias played to date, and scored buck
ets whenever they were needed.
Galileo, using a man-tor-man de
lense most of the time, gave the
trcsluneii plenty of trouble during the
early stages of the game, but once the
First-year team got under way they
were never beaded. The Galileo Five
likewise possessed a dead eye on free
throws and missed none of their shots
from the foul line.
