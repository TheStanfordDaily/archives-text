QFEBEC, Que., Jan. 29. (/Pj—
The elements appeared to have tri
umphed today in a desperate battle
for the life of a deep sea diver
who was trapped at the bottom of
the Outarde river, in an isolated
section 175 miles north of here.
Peter Trans was caught Monday
in the cribbing at the bottom of a
falls where the Ontario Paper Com
pany is constructing a power plant,
at a point near where tlie Outarde
empties into the St. Lawrence.
Two airplanes bearing two res
cue divers set out yesterday to go
lo Trans' aid, but they were forced
down by a snowstorm at Ritnou
Ski. A volunteer diver went down
twice yesterday and reported Trans
could he freed only by sawing away
(lie crib, but he was afraid to try
it himself lest he accidentally sever
the air lines.
Today a laborer, Arvo Silyala,
put on a diving suit and went down
into the icy waters. He worked
close enough to Trans to grip his
hand. There was no response.
Trans was either unconscious from
the long exposure or dead.
