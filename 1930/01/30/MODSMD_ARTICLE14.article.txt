# COTTRELL SAYS CAMPUS ACTIVITY VALUABLE PART OF COLLEGE EXPERIENCE
## Many Students Have Great Responsibilities While Managing Finances, Carrying Out Policies Of Organizations They Represent 
### BY THEODORE DE MOTTE 
pitOBABLY two-thirds of the larger offices held by students on the
campus are as big and as responsible as are those held by many of
our politicians." Professor Edwin A. Cottrell, head of the Political
Science department, was discussing the value to students of university
politics ami officeholding in an interview for the Daily.
"In miidiy of the important offices," he continued, "such as those of
business managers of publications, house managers, and executives of
the various student organizations, there is direct responsibilityâ€”re
sponsibility to the students who elected the officers, and to the organiza-

tions tliey represent. This responsi-<
bility is either financial or it is
responsibility for the carrying out
of policies and programs.
"Politics as a term means mere
ly the method of obtaining a posi
tion. Political organization is for
the purpose of attaining certain
ends. Often the political organiza
tion is permanent in character, but
here it is of a more temporary
kind because of the changing mass
of the student body. At Stanford,
a student generation, as far as
politics is concerned, is about three
years, since the first year is
usually spent in adjustment and
the freshman learns little of poli
tics.
Point System Fails
"Because of the shifting charac
ter of the political organizations
on the campus, a candidate has to
be a better than ordinary type of
politician to swing elections, be
cause he has less time to plan his
campaign. He must possess a good
deal of political 'horse sense.'
"A number of attempts have
been made to institute a point sys
tem of office holding in colleges
whereby a pefson would be al
lowed to hold but one of the major
positions of responsibility, such as
head of the student body or editor
of an important publication. The

1 point system has rarely worked,
| though the principle back of it is
good. Usually there are not enough
I people willing to do the work to
I allow this diffusion of offices. Per
! sonally," Professor Cottrell added,
"I think that one position, such
as ihe president of a house, or of
the A.S.S.U., or editor or business
! manager of the Daily or the Quad,
is enough work for one person if
the work is to be properly done.
Freshmen Pushed
"Freshmen are unduly pushed
into activities. They should be al-
I lowed to get acquainted gradually,
j for there are many cases where
i freshmen have spent so much time
i in politics and in other student
I activities in an effort to make a
name for themselves that they
: haVe gone very low in their
' studies.
"More valuable' training can be
obtained in handling student af
faire than in studying methods of
handling affairs in the classroom.
Thdre is a feeling of getting re
i sultii that can be seen, and an ex
perience that will be similar to
that gained in later years. Every
! student should take an active in
terest in college politics and in
I campus activities, however large
| or small such affairs may be."
