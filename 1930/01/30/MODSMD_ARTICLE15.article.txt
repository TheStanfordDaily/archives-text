### 
AVASHINGTON, Jan. 29. (/P; â€”
The :i2-year-old controversy over
Philippine independence appeared
likely today to come up for deci
sion by the Senate during the
present session.
Chairman Bingham, of the Ter
ritories committee, announced in
the Senate that his committee
hoped to complete hearings on
Philippine independence by Febru
ary 10 and that a bill would be re
ported to the Senate as soon there
after as possible. House action ap
pears unlikely, however.
Two bills have been considered
by the committee, one by Senator
King, Democrat, Utah, to free the
Filipinos, and the other by Bing
ham to appoint a commission to
investigate the question and report
recommendations to Congress. It
also was disclosed today that Sen
ator Vandenberg, of Michigan, an
administration member of the Ter
ritories committee, is preparing a
bill which would give the Filipinos
independence in ten years and
gradual tariff autonomy.
