# POWERS STRIKE SNAG IN CHOICE OF COMMITTEE
## Steering Committee Plan Draws Objections of Representatives Difficulty Is Caused by British Demands 
### 
| LONDON, Jan. 29 (7P).â€”New and
! unexpected difficulties of procedure
| arose tonight to threaten the smooth
j running of the plenary session of the
| Naval Conference tomorrow. A iive
| power agreement on the method of
| measuring fleet tonnage was practi
| cally complete, however, and ready to
| be broadcast to the world through the
I newspapermen who will lie admitted
I to the session.
The problem which so suddenly
I reared its head grew from objections
to the proposed steering committee of
I delegates on methods and limitations,
112 the setting up of which ,was expected
i to he the chief formal business of the
| session tomorrow. To this committee
j were to he referred technical ques-
I tions such as those France and I taly
j have been wrangling over for more
| than a week, so that the conference
proper can go forward with the busi
! ness of disarmament.
So complex are the political issues
| involved in naval disarmament that
! Mr. Mac Donald faces obstacles even
in establishing a committee of dele
j gates. The British dominions would
I desire representation ou such a com
mittee and appointment of one dcle
j gate from each unit of the empire
j would mean seven British representa
tives on this important body. If only
one empire delegate was named the
divisions not represented would likely
I be displeased.
