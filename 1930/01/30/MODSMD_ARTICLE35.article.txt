# BLATANT POLITICS VS. THE PRESENT SYSTEM
## 
### 
The Executive Committee at its meeting Tuesday night wisely
disapproved of a proposal tlint the A.S.S.I', sponsor a general stu
dent political conclave preceding each election of the major officers
on this campus.
On the surface, the proposal appeals to those who are trying to
throw more light on the qualifications of the nominees to the various
student hods offices. Ihe plan submitted was to have each candidate
for a major office speak for a few minutes at a general assembly
called for that purpose In ihe Kxecutivc Committee. In this way,
the proponents argued, the students could become familiar with the
respective nominees and reajlv judge of their qualifications. In the
ory it sounds nice, but in practice . . . ?
In the first place the meeting would tend to become a farce.
Imagine Joke I ilokc pounding out in flowery phrases his theories on
student government, or pleading for the erection of more stop signs
on the campus to make it safer for democracy. < )r Sally Sousie tell
ing the campus that her platform was "Women in Complete C ontrol
over Athletics and I Hind hate Importations." Thereupon all the
fraternity brothers or sorority sisters or merely friends of said can
didates would applaud mightily.
A much more plausible plan was proposed to the effect that the
Daily print qualifications of the various candidates. The argument
brought against this was that the man or woman with a long impos
ing list of activities beside his or her name would be unduly empha
sized, while the candidate witli not quite such a varied list, but with
better personal qualifications, would be discriminated against.
Stanford politics are on the whole cleaner and more honestly
conducted than at most universities of its size, where the political
strangle hold belongs to combines of fraternities and sororities,
(here is less log-rolling and throat cutting here. Ibis campus has
never awakened in the morning to find a big banner strung in trout
of a hall or a fraternity house announcing that "C laud ( ampus W ins
by a Landslide," or to see the trees draped in mourning because the
Alpha /eta Lambda Kappa combine lost which are common prac
tices on other campuses we know of.
Stanford has cleaner politics than most similar universities be
cause it has traditional!) frowned on electioneering and undue politi
cal activity. As lon}.; as tlii-, tradition is maintained this campus will
be better off as far as politics are concerned.

A much more plausible plan was proposed to the effect that the
Daily print qualifications of the various candidates. The argument
brought against this was that the man or woman with a long impos

The Executive Committee at its meeting Tuesday night wisely
disapproved of a proposal tlint the A.S.S.I', sponsor a general stu
dent political conclave preceding each election of the major officers
on this campus.
