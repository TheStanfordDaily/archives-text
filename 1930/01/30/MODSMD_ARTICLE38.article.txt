THE FIRST MRS. FRASER. By

The modern renaissance of
drama which began with the ap
pearance of Ibsen has been devoted
almost wholly to tragedy. Even
the plays of Shaw fall, largely, into
the "problem" group; indeed, if
one considers the long and witty
prefaces which he adds to them,
they are really half essay and half
play.
The delightful drama of the
Restoration remains the last and
the greatest of English comedy,
and it is with surprise and pleas
ure that one linds, in Ervine, a
quite promising returu to this form.
The First. Mrs. Fraser does not
burden itself with an attempt to
present or to solve problems, its
characters speak cleverly in all
situations, and they are not' trou

over, the reader, to his joy, finds
ungrounded his fears that, the play
will decline into a depressingly
trite or moral ending.
Mi's. Fraser has been divorced
by her husband, but when the
latter linds that his young second
wife is determined to cast him
aside for a Baron, he returns to
his first, wife for advice. Mrs.

wife to run away with the Huron
so that her ex-husband will not.

I so. Its weakness is, throughout, its

the plays of Shaw fall, largely, into
the "problem" group; indeed, if

prefaces which he adds to them,
they are really half essay and half

the greatest of English comedy,
