## CONDITION NOT CONDUCIVE TO STUDY

If the students of this Univer
sity are expected to make use ol'
I tie campus library, then why isn't
it heated as il should he?
As ;i result of prolonged investi
gation, we have found that the
average temperature of this build
ing exceeds by ten degrees that
normal uv.erage at which maximum
i efficiency and greatest bodily com
j fort can be obtained. Students are
' expecti (I to study ill this air which
is utterly lacking of proper humi
dity. They might just us w«*11 lie
out, on. the Sahara, desert roasting;
peanuts ;is to be wasting time ami
[ energy in such over heated rooms.
The Hygiene department might

bo intereHted to know that (lie
health of every student who. usea
I lie library is jeopardized iis a re
! nil of I lie abrupt change from the
extremely hot ;ui<l dry interior air
lo the cold and damp outside air.
On the oilier hand the University
is using liftmen per rent more fuel
than is necessary to properly heat
tin' library.
In view of these facts there is
no earthly reason why we shouldn't
get a little immediate action to
ward the correction of this condi
tion which so vitally concerns the
health and efficiency of the stu
dent;; on ihis campus.
