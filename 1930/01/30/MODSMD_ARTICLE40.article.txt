# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD..

### 
Several changes of great import
ance were made in the intereolle-
I giate athletic agreement between
, California and Stanford at the
meeting of the Intercollegiate Ath
letic committees of the two uni
versities. Il was decided that
! either graduate or professional
j coaches might be employed; bot.li
varsity and freshman boating con
tests were added to the list of an
nual intercollegiate contests; and
the dates for the coming year were
fixed.
President R. I. Wheeler, of the
i University of California, and Jus
i tice W. W. Morrow, of the United
States Circuit Court, San Fran-

cisco, spoke at the Assembly.
A singles tennis tournament to
decide the ten best players in the
University was announced to be
held in the Encina courts. The
tournament was open to all mem-
bers of the Tennis Club.
The Boat-house at Lagunita was
being overhauled and cleaned up
in preparation of the intensive
training of the crew men. Practice
was soon to begin in the shells.
The four-oared and pair-oared
barges were to be used on the
lake, and the new shell was to be
reserved for work at Redwood

later in the season.
