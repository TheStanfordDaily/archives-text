The place that attracts more tour
ists year in and year out than any
other spot on the Stanford campus
is (lie Memorial Church. Nearly
everyone who comes to Stanford
visits the Chapel.
At one time or another every
Stanford student attends services
in the Church. They go to the wel
coming services when they are
freshmen or new incoming trans
fers. And they enter it again when
they step forth at the end of their
college course to receive their di
plomas, unless they have used Ihe
wide hack door that, leads off,
down, and out of this campus.
Construction began in and
was completed in 1902. The Church
was partially destroyed in the
earthquake of 1906. it was not com
pletely restored unlil LS) 1.
One of the most interesting parts
of the Church is the mosaic facade,
) most of which is covered with J4-
karat. gold leaf. This work of art
comprises the most stupendous
piece of mosaic in the I'nited
States, in conjunction with a great
part of the interior wails of the
Church which are also lined with
• mosaic.
It. is a non-sectarian institution,
I conducted on the broad lines of
Christianity, and is not confined
within the tenets of any one sect.
The Kev. Dr. I >. Charles Gardner,
D.D., is regularly in charge of the
I services held in the Church, but
lie is on leave at present. The
Rev. Dr. (J. A. Johnston Ross, act

; ing chaplain, has taken over his
duties for this year.
Services are held in 'the vestry
room every morning at 7: r»o o'clock
with Dr. Ross presiding. They are
open to all students who wish to
attend. Ministers from different
denominations speak from time to
I time at the regular 11 o'clock ser
vices on Sunday.
At 4:15 every Sunday and Thurs
day afternoons Warren D. Allen,
University organist, gives an organ
recital. His work is followed by
i many musical critics and enthusi
