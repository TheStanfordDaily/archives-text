### BY WAY OF EXPLANATION 
Ernest P. (Husky) Hunt, the di
rector o!' the destinies of Stan
ford's varsity basketball team,
holds no brief with those coaches
who employ the system of starting
so culled "sliock troops" and had
no such idea in mind when he
gave the starting assignment
against California last Saturday
night, to a second-team lineup.
That was the sum and substance
of his remarks to this writer in an
interview yesterday.
"The use of shock troops has
been seen on the Paci,fic Coast
before this season, with indif
ferent success," commented
Hunt. "While the system un
doubtedly has its merits, I per
sonally do not care to use it.
"I opened the California
game with a second-string
team because injuries had
played havoc with my regu
lars," he continued. "Fawcett's
health has not been of the best
this season, and I could not
count upon him to last a full
game. In addition, Doctor Roth
had advised me against using
Rothert any more than neces
sary, because of Harlow's in
(ected foot.
"In choosing to keep these two
men out of the starting lineup to
fiave them for an opportune mo
ment, I was left wiih two possible
plans of action. I could start my
other three regulars, Tyler, Mc-
Caudless, and Rowley, with two
substitutes, or i could use a com
bination /hal had been working to
gether for the past week. I finally
determined on the latter course.
The five men 1 named as starters
put everything they had into the
game, and it was only through the
failure to cover a certain zone
properly that Tripp, the Bear for
ward, was able to sneak through
for several set-up shots and give
California a lead we could not over
(ake.
"However," Hunt went on,
"nine minutes before the end
of the game we were in as fa
vorable a position as one could
ask for. True, we trailed Cali
fornia by one basket, but our
regulars had played only about
ten or twelve minutes where
the Bears had been used with
out a rest until then. But the
breaks were not with us, and
in a basketball game, breaks
count."
The Cardinal coach indicated
that he thought his team, at full
strength, the equal of Ihe Bears,
and had no excuses to offer for the
defeat, the margin of which was
much narrower than the six-point
difference in I lie score would indi
ca I e.

health has not been of the best
this season, and I could not
count upon him to last a full
game. In addition, Doctor Roth
had advised me against using
Rothert any more than neces
sary, because of Harlow's in
(ected foot.
"In choosing to keep these two
men out of the starting lineup to
fiave them for an opportune mo
ment, I was left wiih two possible
plans of action. I could start my
other three regulars, Tyler, Mc-
Caudless, and Rowley, with two
substitutes, or i could use a com
bination /hal had been working to
gether for the past week. I finally
determined on the latter course.
The five men 1 named as starters
put everything they had into the
game, and it was only through the
failure to cover a certain zone
properly that Tripp, the Bear for
ward, was able to sneak through
for several set-up shots and give
California a lead we could not over
(ake.
"However," Hunt went on,
"nine minutes before the end
of the game we were in as fa
vorable a position as one could
ask for. True, we trailed Cali
fornia by one basket, but our
regulars had played only about
ten or twelve minutes where
the Bears had been used with
out a rest until then. But the
breaks were not with us, and
in a basketball game, breaks
count."
The Cardinal coach indicated
that he thought his team, at full
strength, the equal of Ihe Bears,
and had no excuses to offer for the
defeat, the margin of which was
much narrower than the six-point
difference in I lie score would indi

Ernest P. (Husky) Hunt, the di
rector o!' the destinies of Stan
ford's varsity basketball team,
holds no brief with those coaches
who employ the system of starting
so culled "sliock troops" and had
no such idea in mind when he
gave the starting assignment
against California last Saturday
night, to a second-team lineup.
That was the sum and substance
of his remarks to this writer in an
interview yesterday.
"The use of shock troops has
been seen on the Paci,fic Coast
before this season, with indif
ferent success," commented
Hunt. "While the system un
doubtedly has its merits, I per
sonally do not care to use it.
"I opened the California
game with a second-string
team because injuries had
played havoc with my regu
lars," he continued. "Fawcett's
