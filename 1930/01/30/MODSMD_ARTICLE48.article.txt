But one champion will be de
fending his laurels in the tourney,
! and his division looks to be the
hardest of the seven. Paul Maurer,
| featherweight, is the sole possessor
of a Tunney medal who is again
competing for the University
championship, but entered in his
division are Vance Ro.dgers, lanky
letterman of last: year, Fred Gist.,
winner of the lightweight, division
in the last novice tourney, and
i Fred Glover, a promising freshman.
Another interesting division will
| be the light-heavy class. Four men
! are entered, and the winner will
probably be the varsity man at
that weight. The intercollegiate
season will open a week from to
day with a meet with Davis Farm
slated for the campus, and the var
sity boxing squad will largely be
selected on the basis of the show
ings of the men in tonight's tour
ney.
