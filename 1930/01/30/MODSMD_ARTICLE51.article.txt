# COMING INTO HIS OWN...
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Ask most any average baseball
I fan who was the best hitting
catcher in the majors last season
i and it's L' to 1 he'll answer "Mickey
! Cochrane." But the great backstop
I of the A's ranked more than twen
ty points below the practically un
known Clyde Sukeforth of the Cin
cinnati Reds. Of course Mickey
played in 135 games, Clyde in 84,
but the Red receiver worked in
more than half his team's contests
and out batted one of the greatest
catchers of all time in a season
which saw the Athletics champions
| and the Reds finish seventh.
You'll hear more of this young
I Maine youth who turned in such a
J remarkable record in his major
| league debut. He hasn't made many
j headlines nor even been mentioned
j to fight Arthur (the Great) Shires,
j but he'll be in these almost every
day this season working his head
off for his team, his boss, and for
the fans of the Rhineland.
Dan Howley won't keep Clyde
Sukefroth on the bench much, you
can make a bet on that. The h\d

collected splinters for dear old
Jack Hendricks during 1!>27 and
1928, playing in only 71 games dur
ing the two seasons. He batted
.190 one year, .132 the other, and
was so disgusted that he demanded
either more work of his boss or to
be shipped to another club. He got
work and the result i& history. He
batted .354, hit 1(1 doubles, one
home run, stole 8 bases, and led
the nearest batter on his own team
by over 40 points!
In tlie dope sent out by (he Na
tional League publicity director,
Cullen Cain, the following is of
especial interest to me regarding
Sukeforth. "Sukeforth was raised
in the Maine woods and played
semi-pro ball in the town of Mil
linocket. Some Georgetown college
boys who were spending a summer
up there took the young man back
to college with them, and he was a
student at Georgetown for two
years." Did this "semi-pro ball
player" play for the Hilltoppers 1
wonder? The Carnegie Foundation
should look into this!
