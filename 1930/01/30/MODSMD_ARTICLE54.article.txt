# CARDINALS FINISH Be THETA XI IN BASKETBALL TILT
## Kappa Sigs Lose To K.A.'s In Close Battle 
### 
Case, sucker-shot, artist, sank ten
field goals and two l'ree throws as
the Cardinal Independents nut
scored Theta Xi 41-22 in intramural
basketball last night. A lot of
1 Case's shots were made possible
by some expert feeding by Getts,
Card center, who played a beauti
ful floor game.
Tlie Cardinals showed an effec
tive offense, nearly always working
the ball in close to the bucket be
fore taking a shot. Theta Xi played
a hard game, but found their op
ponents' defense hard to penetrate
j and relied on a number of success
ful long shots to account for their
| scoring. In this line, Sleeper
starred, putting in five field goals.
After playing three quarters of
j very so-so basketball, Kappa Alpha
and Kappa Sigma fought to a
whirlwind finish, the K.A.'s ending
up on top of a 17-15 score. With
' the score tied at 11 all, long shots
! by the Kappa Alpha forwards gave
them a six-point lead. In the last
j three minutes of play, Mann and
| Sexson, Kappa Sis center and for
j ward respectively, sank two pretty
| field goals, but. the final whistle
! made their efforts in vain.
Neither of the other two sched
| uled games were played, Theta Chi
; winning by default of Phi Kappa
i Psi, and Newman Club receiving a
: forfeit by Alpha Delta Phi.
