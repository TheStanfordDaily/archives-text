### 
Embalmed whales can have their
Jonahs, even without cruising the
briny deep to find them. Raymond
Crawford, lt>, crawled into (lie pre
j served cetacean, which is now in
Palo Alto, while it was in Denver,
! Colorado, hoping to get a free ride
; with the whale to Los Angeles. Dn
i fortunately he went to sleep inside
the leviathan, and when he woke
i up and emerged he found the whale
had merely been moved to some
other part of Denver. Police failed
to sympathize With Crawford's
emulation of Jonah and took him
to jail.
