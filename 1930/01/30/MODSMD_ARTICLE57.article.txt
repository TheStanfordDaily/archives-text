"Wo cannot expect to build u j
model of mi atom with the same
kind of mechanics - (hat Henry
Kord uses in building an automo- i
bile," said Dr. W. B. Lee, of the
Department of Chemistry yester
day, in discussing the new course
in Quantum Mechanics which he !
will conduct during the spring
quarter.
"The philosophy of Quantum
Mechanics means that we must j
change the old concepts of space
and time within the atom. In 1925, |
the present Quantum Mechanics!
replaced the old Quantum Theory
which was developed about 1!(()()," ,
he continued. "Heisenberg's the-j
ory takes no account of atom mod
els and concentrates on those,
things which we can observe in
connection with the atom: radia
tion of light and spectral lines.'
Hence, in Quantum Mechanics,
brightness and positions of spec
tral lines can be computed by j
mathematics."
"An interesting development of |
the new theory," Dr. Lee pointed 1
out, "lies in the prediction of two ,
kinds of hydrogen, using Quantum \
Mechanics. Scientists probably
would never have thought of look
ing for the second type of hydro
gen without the use of this theory." ,
Previous courses have been
given under the Physics Depart
ment, but next quarter, the chemi
cal application of the new theory
will be stressed particularly.
