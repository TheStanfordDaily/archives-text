# CONFERENCE TO AID WOMEN IN CHOOSING FIELD OF VOCATION
## 
### Ruth Miner 
"Particular vocations which a j
student may take up within a field j
are largely determined by chance !
opportunities at, the time. Conse
quently the important tiling is to ;
pick out the field and that is what
I he A.W.S. conference will help
women to do," said I)r. E. K. ;
Strong, chairman of the vocational
guidance committee, yesterday. |
Dr. Strong will open the program
to be held in the Women's Club
house from It to 12 Saturday morn
ing.
"Agencies maintained by clubs
and similar organizations to help .
women get jobs and to give them j
advice on vocations are far more I
numerous than those for men. Con-1
sidering that not so many women
as men go into positions, women'
are probably equally well taken !
care of," he said.
Jobs Built For Men
"Woman lias had great, diffi- ;
culty, however," he believes, "in !
fitting herself to jobs that were !
built up around men; and until the j
structure is reorganized to fit. both,
women will not be getting a fair !
turn to show their ability. It is an i
adaptation which is just now lak- j
ing place.
"If a woman makes up her mind
she is seriously going into one par- j
ticular vocation, that is one thing.
If she is interested only in a tern

porary position until she may
marry, then she will be given tem
porary and 'puttering* jobs. Many
women do not. want to develop the
characteristics of self-assertion
that are necessary to succeed in
some lines."
The fields to be discussed Satur
day are those in which women have
been active for some time, lie said.
