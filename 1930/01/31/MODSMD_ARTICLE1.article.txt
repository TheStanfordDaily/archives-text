# UNIVERSITY CHAMPIONSHIPS FEATURED BY SLOW BOUTS
## Al Roth Pays Tribute To Maloney In Awarding Medals To Champions Dick Miller, Frosh Welter, Provides Most Likely Exhibition Of Fighting 
### Dick Friendlich 
Plying lists with a sprinkling of
gore marked the All-University
boxing championships staged last
night in the Pavilion as seven men
won division titles and Gene Tun
ney medals.
Three of the final scraps ended
in technical knockouts. Phil Smith
won the heavyweight crown when
Freddie Voigt failed to answer the
bill for th" third round. Voigt re
ceipted for a merry pasting in the
first two cantos, and was unable
to drag his bulk from his corner
when the third-round gong rang.
Freddie La Marsna also earned
a championship and a medal when
lie was awarded a third-round t.k.o.
over Hugh Keenan in the light
heavyweight final. The bout was a
free-swinging affair, fairly even un
til La IVlarsna clipped his opponent
on the chin with a right hand and
had him in bail shape when Re
feree Pete Flanagan intervened.
Miller Workmanlike
Isy far the most workmanlike ex
hibition was put on by Dick Miller,
freshman welterweight, in stop
ping George Eastman in two heats.
Weaving and bobbing, Miller rock
ed Last man repeatedly in the first
round and finally dropped him in
one coiner with a left hook in the
second stanza, the referee then
stopping the encounter.
Freddie Glover and Vance Rog
ers put up an interesting melee in
the featherweight final, with Glo
ver getting the nod, although
thiough Referee Flanagan's error
in reading the name of the judges'
choice, Rogers was announced as
the winner. Coach Harry Maloney
later rectified the mistake, but
added that he would wire Gene
Tunney for an additional medal in
order that Rogers might be award
ed one also for the splendid fight
he made.
Glover started fast and nearly
floored Rogers with'the lirst punch
of the scrap, an overhand right to
the head. He tired in the second
round, but came hack fast in the
final session to jar his adversary
repeatedly. Rogers, however, made
good use of his longer reach and
greater experience.
Duke Brown Wins
Duke Brown took the middle
weight crown, winning a three
round decision over Fred Johnson.
Johnson, a terrific right-hand
puncher, spent the entire time
waiting for a chance to slip over
the haymaker, while Brown belted
him heartily with lefts and rights,
opening a gash over his left eye in
the second round.
The lightweight title went to
Ralph Malcolm, who coasted
through to a three-round win over
Hoh Lilly. The Card captain, obvi
ously under wraps, won as he
pleased, and failed to work up a
sweat in doing so.
Carl Eardley grabbed the ban
tamweight crown by decisivelv
licking Hugh Israel over the three
round route. Israel forced the is
sue most of the way, but was no
match for Eardley's sharpshooting
tactics, and was virtually cut to
ribbons by the latter's beautiful
eounterpun clung.
