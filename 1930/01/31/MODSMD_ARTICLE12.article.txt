### 
Stanford's new women's gymna
sium, long a bone of contention
between the Board of Athletic Con
trol and the Women's Athletic As
sociation, is at last well on its way
toward becoming a definite thing,
according to word given out by the
Comptroller's office yesterday.
"Tentative plans for the structure
1 are already drawn, and it is ex
pected that the final plans will be
finished and ready for the contrac
tor within the next two months,"
said Alrnon E. Roth, University
Comptroller.
The building will be located
across from Roble on the north
side of Santa Teresa street, facing
the lake, and will be on the same
east and west axis as the Quad.
This spot will be somewhere near
the present women's hockey fields.
As far as the tentative plans
have gone the new gym will con
tain all the modern features of
gymnasium planning. This includes
| the latest in shower baths, swim
ming pools, dance studios, and two
specially equipped sun porches
j where the members of the live hun
dred may acquire their summer
tans in peace and comfort.
On the ground floor of the build
ing will be the offices, classrooms,
clinics, W.A.A. executive room,
dressing rooms, showers, the dance
studio, and the gymnasium proper.
The second floor and roof will be
given over to balconies and sun
porches.
