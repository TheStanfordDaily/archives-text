### 
ALBUQI'FRyUE, N.M., Jan. .50
(/P). â€” A Sandia mountain fastness
bristled with gunfire which killed Dep
uty Sheriff Fmilio Candelaria and
twice wounded an alleged moonshin
er, when a posse of prohibition agents
swept last night into one of the remote
mountain worlds where people of pio
neer stock still live to themselves and
where each man makes his own laws.
(iregarios Kspinosa, 45, stands
charged with first degree murder for
the death of Candelaria, six other
mountain farmers, alleged to be moon
shiners, are in jail in Albuquerque, and
a seventh is sought by the sheriff's
deputies.
Two weeks ago Federal Agent t. L .
Findley raided the place but found
only six empty mash barrels which had
been dumped in the mountains. No
arrests were made.
