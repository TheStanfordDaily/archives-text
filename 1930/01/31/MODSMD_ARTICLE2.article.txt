# DANE DIVES DOWN TO DREARY DEATH IN RIVER DEPTHS
## 
### 
MONTREAL, Que., Jan. 3.
(/Pi Peter Trans, whose quest
for livelihood led him into
paths that he feared —down
along the cold and lonely beds
of seas and lakes and rivers—
is dead.
And somewhere in far-away
Denmark are two little boys
who won't be "going to Amer
ica next spring to see daddy."
Trans did as he had feared
he would die —helpless and
alone, locked in the cumber
some and grotesque habili
ments of his job. His lifeless
body was brought up at dawn
today from the bed of the
Outardes River, where he had
been imprisoned since Mon
day forenoon after his lines
became caught on spikes in a
cofferdam in which lie was
■working.
