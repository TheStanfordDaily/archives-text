### Elisabeth Larsh 
As one of the first productions given i
in Eva Le Galliennc's Civic Repertory j
Theater in 1926, Carlo Goldoni's com- i
edy "The Mistress of the Inn." which |
will be presented here a week from i
tonight, was revived by this actress- j
! dirccti. r after several years of m gleet, j
Establishing the New York (. ivie
i Repertory Theater entirely at her own
expense and through her own effort,
! Eva Le Gallienne launched her ven-
I turt in the season of 1926 with-three
! plays a week to packed houses in the
' little old West Fourteenth Street I he
j ater. Among the productions given in
j the first season along with "I.a Lo;-an-
I diera" ("The Mistress of the Inn )
| were Ibsen's "The Doll's Mouse," (. he
' khov's "Three Sisters." and Beiui
i vente's "Saturday Night."
Performed 31 Times
"La Locandiera" was given per- j
J formances during the season of 1926. ,
! Apparently it was very nearly the most I
1 popular production given in that open
[ ing year of the Repertory Theater, lot- I
| "Three Sisters" was the only play to
I he given more often that season by
! Miss Le Gallienne.
Playing the leading role oi Miran
dolina, mistress of the inn, this pio
! neer in the theater movement scored J
| a great success in a part very different J
; from the Jeanne d'Arc which she had i
Splayed in Paris and the l.ilioin which J
' she had played on Broadway. Her in j i
; tcrpretation of the part was declared ]
Iby contemporary critics to be extreme ;
j ly in sympathy with the great Italian s |
I intent.
Revised Play
As director of this production, Eva j
! Le Gallienne was also applauded. She
'revised "«La Locandiera," making it i
j play of three acts rather than live-, cut- j
I ting and combining the scenes in a way I
j which improved the play for modern J
j production. Helvenston is using her j
' version.
Miss Le Gallienne was awarded the j
Pictorial Review $5,000 prize tor "the ;
j outstanding achievement of the year j
by a woman" in 192K in recognition of |
her establishing and running success- |
fully the Repertory Theater.
Ruth Becde. a transfer from Mills !
College, will take the part of Miran- |
l dolina in Harold Helvenston's prodtic- j
! tion of this classic by the "father of |
I Italian comedy" next Friday. She |
