\\ lien the Dail\ s new Duplex press grinds nil its first paper
in the cold, dark hours \londa\ morning there will he carried in
the masthead the n;nne «» f a new editor. Volume 77 w ill he officially
under way. \ olunie 7<>, dear old tiling, becomes mere histor\'. Like
a drowning man, the present editor makes one last clutch for the
Straw of Life and hangs desperate!;, on lo speak his piece while
the speaking is good.
In In's earliest days at Stanford lie heard its illustrious I'resi
dent, who now is Secretary of the Interior, warn all students to
"beware of the hall and chain of the past" (my, how time flies).
So at the beginning of dear old Volume 7f> he did not write an
editorial setting forth his hopes, his aims, his ambitions nor the
quota of gripes he expected during the ensuing four and one-half
months.
Mis ambition was to serve the campus with a better, newsier
paper and to increase the efliciencv of the editorial staff. It is not
up to him to judge whether lie has succeeded. Consequently, in
line with the policy adopted at the beginning of the term, the con
eluding editorial will not he a back slapping resume of what has
happened during his regime.
There is one nefarious idea that has of late sprung up like ;i
stiuk-weed that of having a I )ire< tor of Publications who shall Ik
s czar of campus publications in general and the I)aii.v in partial
»ar. When this journal was a live column sheet printed on gloss\
paper little attention was paid to what it said or what it did. l»ut
year by year the Daily has grown in size and importance, con
trary to what the old-timers mav tell vim about the good old days
< )n the whole, this increase of power and prestige on the campus
has been quite ably handled, contrary to what the faculty or the
Division of Journalist*! may believe.
Ii is only natural now that an agenev, or agencies, would like 1<
set their hands on the Daily, only of the managerial office, they
will tell you. lint they forget that those who control the purse
">trings also cramp the editorial policy.
As the official publication ol the Associated Students, this paper
has developed soleh with their aid and under their advice. It is
their paper. I'ublLlied by them. to them not to a
■•ingle individual with a nicely appointed office and a high-sounding
title. To change this condition would be a criminal act.
The Dai iv ha no tolerance for such persons who may try to
wax fat b\ living re a leech off the campus publications as their
czar.
This one ( loud on ilip horizon does not completely blacken the
future a' far as Volume 7/ L concerned. The new editor is thor
oughly capable of handling, his new job. < o-operating with Hal
Terwilliger, one of the most eoinpeteul business manager who lias
ever politely turned an editor down when he asks for more moneys,
Speers hould live up to his expectations and give the campus a
worth while and readable paper.
Volume 7(> was blessed with a unified and cooperative staff,
Day after day reporter and < op\ editors covered their beats, or
should have, for no compensation, except the questionable glory
that comes from an occasional "In line." Night editors worked nil
lie itantly on desk from early in the afternoon until the paper "went
to bed late at night. Il take a great amount of devotion to toil
many wearisome hour each week jusl for the love of the art. Ihi
•pirit(s) of the Daiia i a fine unquenchable liquid that cannot be
duplicated elsewhere on the campus. So the editor's respects go to
the stall and especially to its Woman's Lditor, who has been going
her way quietly working much harder than her 1 '/• per cent of the
profits would indicate, e pecially when there are to be no profits.
Thus the editor, almost "has been," finds himself played out.
I le can think of no adequate conclusion for expressing the fun he
has had these past three and a half vears. So he just stops.
