# Marcella Brown To Lead Junior Basketball Team
## 
### 
Marcella Brown, star basketball
player and flrst-Btring guard last
year, will captain the Junior cage
squad for this season.
Due to the post-season hockey
game with the All-Americans, prac
tice lias been badly slowed up and
the squads are not in as good shape
as usual. The sophomores and sen
iors are both handicapped in the
absence of forwards Metis Haw
kins, Dorothy Sweet, and Marian
Hoi ley. No lineups have been
picked and the practice game
cheduled for Wednesday is ex
pected to be very ragged.
