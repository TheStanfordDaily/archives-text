Llewelyn Powys, even with his

(Otherwise. The explanation of the
magical mutations, of electrons, ho
thinks, does' not lie in this world.
And"the sound of waters, the
songs of birds, poignant wiih inLi

the secret, of a far-different solu

j Llewelyn Powvs is:a poet in the
midst of the "engulfing ocean of
j an unfathomable and unintelligible
eternity." He remains uncrushed
! by the immensity of the meaning

made him a fanatic pagan with an
ennobled Omar Khayam philo
sophy of life. His style of writing
is well fitted to his nature, but.

j To tell a simple story is one
