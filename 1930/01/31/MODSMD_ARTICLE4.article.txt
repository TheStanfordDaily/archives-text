# GERMAN PROFESSOR TELLS OF WORK IN ORIGINAL RESEARCH
## 
### 
Delving into a region of the field
of physics and chemistry hitherto
relatively unknown, Professor H.
G. Grimm of the University of
Wurzburg, Germany, has done
work of outstanding merit. Dr.
Grimm discussed several aspects
of his work in the subject, "Atomis
tics and the Systematization of
Chemical Compounds," in a lecture
under the auspices of the depart
ment of chemistry and Sigma Xi
yesterday.
Professor Grimm took his degree
at the University of Munich and
has been professor of chemistry at
Wurzburg since 1!)24. During the
war he was lieutenant in the Ger
man army and saw active service
for two years in Southern Europe.
