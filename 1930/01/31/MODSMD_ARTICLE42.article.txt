In the I niled States in 1!)2">
there were I4r.,!itiii physicians, an
average of one physician to every
801 people. This is a higher ratio
than in any other coumifry. Of the
i 4,().'?0 medical graduates in 1927,
approximately one third matricu
lated in some special branch ot
medicine, which recognizes at least
sixteen major groups.
K. litnales ol the median income
of successful physicians (based
upon several ilalistical studies)
vary from $6,(100 to $!i,f>oo higher
than for any otlu r major profes
sion. In city practice from 25 to |
50 per cent of the gross income is >
used to del'l'a . overhead expenses.
Minimum pro-medical training,
as proscribed by the Association of
American Medical ►Colleges, is 60
j sellie; I el' llOlirs of college WOl'k
with specific hotii ; in the physical
land biological sciences, in Knglish,
and in a foreign language. Stanford
require three y.-ai of pre-medical
work.
Competition Keen
Competition for medical school
e^iiranee r keen, and pre-niedical
grades count for much, > specially I
I hose earned in I lie sciences. Stan
ford's first year I'las" i' limited to
5(1. In 1026, 20,0!):? applications were
made h.v 8,500 stmh ills, of whom
6,266 were accepted by 112 lie modi
cal schools.
Medical training proper general
ly covers four years. ')i these, the
first two an devoted to study of
the basic medical sciences and the
last two to clinical matter, much
of wliich is studied at the hospital.
Many schools including Ibis I'niver
sif.y, and approximately one-third
of the stales require in addition
one year of internoship.
Por internesliip purposes 40 hos
pitals are owned outright by the
61 class "A" medical colleges
(1027). Lane Hospital and Stan
lord Hospital in San Francisco are
ownwl by Stanford. Internes ordi
narily work without pay, although
hoard, room, and use of equipment
are provided.
Tuition Figures Given
Statistics supplied by the Carne
gie Poundation show that the aver
age yearly tuition of class "A" col
leges (1W27) is $254, although the
yearly cost per student to the col
lege is $704. At Stanford tuition in
the sduwil of medicine is $:?(»(! a
year.
Each state has its own examina
tion for licenses. In addition, Ha
I stales allow practice without fur
ther examination to holders of cer
tificates from the National Hoard

of Medical Examiners.
Physical, mental, and social re
quirements of the medical profes
sion are rigorous. Abundant health
and endurance, with ability to
withstand long and irregular hours;
high intelligence and trained puw- 1
ers of observation and of concen
tration; love for his, wori\ and con
fidence ill ils value; and a posilh
and harmonizing personality an
minimum essentials for a succe
ful physician.
A high percentage of elimination j
takes place during the years of |
training which put a decided strain j
upon the physical, menial, and
nervous health of the candidate. An
ardent desire to practice medicine,!
supplemented by careful evalua
tion of the demands made by Hie j
training, should precede every d- j
eision to become a physician.
