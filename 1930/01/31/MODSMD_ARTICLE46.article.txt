# SIDELINE LANTS...
## A 						GOOD START 
### 
To most citizens of the Farm,
Wednesday's inui'ii] truck affair was
just another hi! of cut-throat com
petition between the various liv
iiif' (.-roups scattered about the cam
pus, will) tin* Toreodor hash house
performers doing more 11 i;iri their
lliire of tilt- cut linn.
But to Mr. Robert L. Tern
pleton, the result of the meet
was a ray of sunshine break
ing through foreboding clouds
that loom on the horizon most
menacingly to Stanford's track
supremacy.
Not only were eight mural • rec
ords est a bliheil, bill some of ihe
performances would do justice to
mid-season college cinderpath ac
t ivi ties.
Several freshmen came thru
in the manner of veteran com
petitors, yet, what most con
cerned and pleased America's
Boy Coach and chief monopo
list of 1.C.4-A. championships
were the unexpected times and
distances of a couple of this
year's varsity neophytes.
One of the latter prospects
proved lo lie iin iron man. Lea
liable!- streaked around the old
oval with the ability to win three
tir-I place:', each in (plile creditable
i ime,
After being clocked in the
century at a mere ten and
one-fifths seconds, this Hables
lad stretched his legs over a
quarter mile of cinders to lead
a fast fieid home in forty-nine
and four-fifths seconds.
Although Student llahles is not
too proud of his bawl-out average
:i| tile present time, lie is cracking
the books ovNlime this quarter and
should lie eligible for spring com
petition.
Which will be most welcome
to Mr. Robert L. Templeton,
who has been on the verge of
worrying lately over his 440-
yard prospets. It seems that
elongated John Morrison's
lower limbs are not in the best
of shape as yet, while Alvin
Adolph Hables, who lowered
the Little Big Meet one lap
record last season, is still
bothered with an injured foot.
America's Hoy Couch has plenty
of other troubles. He has a number
of first-place certainties to be sure,
and ought to maintain his mono
poly over the 1.C.4-A. for another
year. Such men as Erie Apollo
Krenz, Foot-A-Week Rothert, Hec
Dyer, Podge Smith, and Virg Dow
ell cannot be denied.
Yet, material is sadly lack
ing in certain events and there
is a great scarcity of second
and third place men to cop
points in dual meets. This is
especially true in the track
events, and most outstanding
in the middle distances and
longer jaunts around the oval.
In fact, old Walter Christie, dean
of college track coaches a decade
ago, thinks that he can scrape to
gether enoungh point-winners up at
Merkeley to seriously extend Stan
ford in the coining Big Meet. He
predicts a Cal defeat by a hare
five-point margin.
Dean Cromwell, lord of track
and field down in the land of i
Troy, goes a step farther,
claiming that he will give Mr.
Ternpleton's hopes a severe
setback when the Trojans and
Cardinals clash next quarter.
The odds favor old crowing Crom- j
well by a wide margin 011 paper.
Tlis material looks unbeatable at
this date, for I.S.C. alumni and i
oth< r head men have fairly scoured ;
the state for cinder athletes dur
ing the past few years. And the >
T'.S.C. vacuum cleaner methods j
have sucked in a vast horde of po- |
tential greats.
Which is beyond the pale of j
criticism as these nun are all un- j
übsidized, believe it or not and j
I range as it may seem!
