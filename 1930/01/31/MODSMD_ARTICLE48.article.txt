# Card, Bruin Tilt Here Tonight
## TWIN CAGE BILL TO DECIDE FARM CONFERENCE FATE Varsity Hopes to Revenge Record-Breaking Upset By U.C.L.A. Five 
### Stephen Dietrich 
With all his campaign cards on
the table and his playing Cards
on hardwood, Coach Husky Hunt
will turn his varsity basketball live
loose tonight in the first game of
la double-header with the C.C.L.A.
Bruins at eight o'clock in the Farm
; Pavilion.
The Card mentor will hold back
nothing in his effort to down the
Westwood quintet, as this week
end will offer Stanford its last
j chance to climb out of the Confer
ence cellar and get hack in the
j title race. The Farm team must
win both tilts to stand any sort of
a chance for the championship,
j while a pair of defeats will mean
its complete elimination.
Out For Revenge
It is Ihe general belief of Hunt
and his squad of players, who so
| successfully cleared their initial
hurdle of a comeback campaign on
Wednesday night against the Olvni
-1 pic Club, that Stanford will re
venge the record-breaking spec
tacle down at Westwood a couple
i of weeks ago.
According to Hunt, the Bruins'
63 to 30 humiliation of the Cards
was a mere flash in the pan on the
part of the Southern quintet. The
Cards had an average night at lo
cating the hoop on that occasion,
while the Bruins played over their
heads to sink field goals from all
over the court with uncanny ease.
Although si ill leading the confer
ence, U.C.L.A. was most hand
somely trounced by tin- Trojans
last Saturday evening, the final
score being 33 to 16. The latter
outfit, which Hunt considers to be
vastly tougher to down than the
Bruin five, was held to an even
break by Stanford.
Shy in Lineup
However, reports from the
Southland have it that C.C.L.A.
will be considerably strengthened
by the return of Carl Shy to the
lineup. Shy, running guard and key
man to the Westwood offense,
starred against the Cards in the
season's opener, and his absence,
due to illness, was keenly felt in
the Bruin-Trojan tilt.
If Captain Rothert and Mike Rey
nolds work together as smoothly
as they did during the Olympic
game, the tall Bruin sharpshooters
will find it hard to break through
for many sucker shots. Then, too,
Hunt feels that Johnny McCamlless
is due to have at least one of his
good nights this week-end.
Coach Hunt stated yesterday
after practice that he intended to
start the same lineup that opened
against the Winged 0 team, with
Tyler and Berg at forward, Mc-
Camlless at center, and Rothert
and Reynolds holding down the
guard berths.

start the same lineup that opened
against the Winged 0 team, with
Tyler and Berg at forward, Mc-
Camlless at center, and Rothert
and Reynolds holding down the
guard berths.
With all his campaign cards on
the table and his playing Cards
on hardwood, Coach Husky Hunt
will turn his varsity basketball live
loose tonight in the first game of
la double-header with the C.C.L.A.
Bruins at eight o'clock in the Farm
; Pavilion.
The Card mentor will hold back
nothing in his effort to down the
Westwood quintet, as this week
end will offer Stanford its last
j chance to climb out of the Confer
ence cellar and get hack in the
j title race. The Farm team must
win both tilts to stand any sort of
a chance for the championship,
j while a pair of defeats will mean
its complete elimination.
Out For Revenge
It is Ihe general belief of Hunt
and his squad of players, who so
| successfully cleared their initial
hurdle of a comeback campaign on
Wednesday night against the Olvni
-1 pic Club, that Stanford will re
venge the record-breaking spec
tacle down at Westwood a couple
i of weeks ago.
According to Hunt, the Bruins'
63 to 30 humiliation of the Cards
was a mere flash in the pan on the
part of the Southern quintet. The
Cards had an average night at lo
cating the hoop on that occasion,
while the Bruins played over their
heads to sink field goals from all
over the court with uncanny ease.
Although si ill leading the confer
ence, U.C.L.A. was most hand
somely trounced by tin- Trojans
last Saturday evening, the final
score being 33 to 16. The latter
outfit, which Hunt considers to be
vastly tougher to down than the
Bruin five, was held to an even
break by Stanford.
Shy in Lineup
However, reports from the
Southland have it that C.C.L.A.
will be considerably strengthened
by the return of Carl Shy to the
lineup. Shy, running guard and key
man to the Westwood offense,
starred against the Cards in the
season's opener, and his absence,
due to illness, was keenly felt in
the Bruin-Trojan tilt.
If Captain Rothert and Mike Rey
nolds work together as smoothly
as they did during the Olympic
game, the tall Bruin sharpshooters
will find it hard to break through
for many sucker shots. Then, too,
Hunt feels that Johnny McCamlless
is due to have at least one of his
good nights this week-end.
