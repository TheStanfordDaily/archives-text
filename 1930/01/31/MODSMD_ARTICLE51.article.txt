# THE 						LIMEHOUSE WINDMILL
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Cervantes, in "Don Quixote," told
of the antics of :t Spanish country
gentleman, who, imbued with tales
of chivalry, set forth with his
trusty squire seeking heroic ad
venture. The excited imagination
of the Spanish Don turned wind
mills into giants and he attacked
tlieni valiantly, if disastrously. His
tory may repeat itself in the fight
game today, where Jack "Kid"
Berg of London represents the
windmill and A 1 Singer or Sammy
Mandell the Don Quixote of the
plot. Perhaps soon a Jewish or an
Italian "country gentleman" will be
charging against this British Wind
mill who is called the "Whitechapel
Whirlwind" and whose real name is
Judah Bergmanâ€”a Jewish boy
from the Limehouse district of
London.
The drawn and pasty-faced Kid i
Berg gave 15),000 wildly-excited
spectators the surprise of their
lives recently in Madison Square}
Garden, when he administered a \
terrific beating to the powerful ;
Tony Canzoneri. The fight was so ,
one-sided that it was truly tin J
amazing performance for the anae- ]
mic-looking Briton* who, by his vie- I
iory, finds himself only a step
away from a fight for the world's
lightweight championship.
At this writing it appears that

Berg may get the shot at Sammy!
Mandell's title without lighting A 1 i
Singer, that fast-eomiiig junior
lightweight, first. Singer is a close ;
friend Of Berg's. Either combina- ;
tion would pack 'em in, as Berg }
ranks close to Singer as a drawing- 1
card. Don't he too sure that the
Windmill would come off the bet
ter in a bout with either of these ;
Don Quixotes. Harry Creb, the:
original "windmill." was finally
bettered by Deacon Tiger Flowers,
the black Don Quixote from
Georgia.
Now if Fluttering Phil Scott of
England would only fight like Jack
"Kid" Berg! j
