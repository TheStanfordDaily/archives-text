# WOLTER TO START STORY, OSWILL IN GAME TOMORROW
## Athens Club Reputed As Difficult Proposition For Card Team 
### 
Story and Oswill, battery in last j
Wednesday's baseball tilt between j
the Redshirt varsity and the Ken-'
ealv Seals, have been picked by j
Coach Wolter to start tomorrow's j
game against the Athens Club at 1
12:30 o'clock on the local diamond. {
Wolter put the boys through a stiff i
workout yesterday and they should j
make a good showing against the
Oakland club.
Little is known about the club |
team, but it is reputed to be pretty
good. If they play baseball as well
as basketball, the Cards may be in
for a good drubbing.
Wolter plans to use the same \
lineup that started the Kenealv j
Seals game with one exception
Cordon Campbell will replace Ma
gee in right field. Several of the j
second-string men look pretty good j
out in the field. White is showing j
up well at short and will probably j
give Johnson plenty of competition !
for the position. Muirson Wright, j
regular first-sucker last year, will i
see plenty of action before the sea-'
son is over, and Magee looks good
for a few games on third or in the
Out field.
Stanford's lineup tomorrow:
Story p. Oswill c, Goodell lb,
Churchill 2b, Laird 3b, Johnson ss,
llunken If, Rintala cf, Campbell rf. ,
