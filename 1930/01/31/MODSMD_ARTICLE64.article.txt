# BASEBALL SEASON OPENS WITH GAELS' PROSPECTS BRIGHT
## 
### 
Although the Kedshirts have !
eight returning lettermen to the j
1930 baseball squad and Coach j
Clint Evans up at Berkeley has j
nine Big "("' men on his team this !
year, St. Mary's looks to have the j
best team in the conference.
I'nlike Stanford, California, and j
Santa Clara, the strongest unit on j
j the Gael squad is its pitching staff. I
Conlin and Hamilton have returned
as well as five or six relief t.wirlers.
Butch Sinias, captain of i lie basket
ball squad, will return to full duty
at his old position behind the bat
as soon as the cage season is over.
Seghetti has been moved from
the outfield to first base, Valim or
Mulronev will play the keystone
i sack, Thomas will be in the hot
corner, and Neeley will be the
regular shortstop. Ackerman, All-
American football tackle, Stennett,
another well-known performer on
the gridiron, and Ragus will patrol
i the outer gardens.
