j Harlow Rothert took a little time
out from liis basketball duties yes
i terday morning to heave the shot
j around a bit in liis first warm-up
| of the season. Though his fingers
i were weakened from lack of exer
cise, lie managed to throw the
1 weight close to the fifty-foot mark.
• His best toss was l;i feet inches,
; while his first try went better than
j forty-seven feet. With Krenz around
| the forty-nine foot mark also, the
| shot seems well taken care of, as
\ Ray Dawson took third in the in
| tramural Wednesday with 44 feet
8% inches, his best effort of the
season to date. Krenz also threw
the discus 153 feet yesterday, and
t landed a number of tosses around
j the 150-foot. mark.
Mural results showed plenty of
; reserves who will no doubt pick up
j some odd points in this season's
! meets. Among the men who are'
| eligible and who looked like var
| sity material were Atkinson, a
: transfer, who ran the 880 in 2:01,
I Wright, with 4::>8 1-5 in the mile,
j and Nisbet who won the high and
I low hurdles under 16 and 2<> sec
