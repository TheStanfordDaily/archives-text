# ROTH BEEDE TO ACT IN LEAD OF COMEDY FRIDAY
## Played Opposite Gordon Davis Last Summer In 'Second Man' Has Most Subtle of Ten Parts in Play 
### Elisabeth Larsh 
Ruth Beede, a transfer from
j Mills College, will play the lead in
| Carlo Goldoni's comedy of situa-
I tion, "The Mistress of the Inn,"
■ which is being given here Friday
night under Harold Helvenston,
i acting director of dramatics.
Miss Beede has been seen on the
j qampus stage only once before,
I when she played in S. N. Berh
-1 man's sparkling comedy of four
j characters, "The Second Man," last
I rummer. As the determined young
! ingenue, Monica Grey, whose ob
! ject is to have Clark Storey, she
: was a delightfully disturbing in
-1 fluence in that play. She had Clark
| Storey, the temperamental "au
| tlior" played by Gordon Davis,
tapping his foot because he did not
want her particularly, and Austin
Lowe, the brilliant chemist played
i by Jack McDowell, biting his nails
j because he could not have her.
Opposite McDowell
Miss Beede will be playing op
posite McDowell again in "The
Mistress of the Inn," with him in
the part of Fabrizio, an Italian !
servant at the inn of which she, I
! Mirandolina, is hostess.
The role of Mirandolina, "la lo- |
i candiera" (or the mistress of the
jinn), is one which was immortal
ized by Dus6, who played it in |
Italian in 1905. It has been morel
recently been done by Eva Le Gal-|
lienne, founder and director of the j
New York Civic Repertory Thea- ]
ter, who put on this play in the
opening year of her dramatic veil j
j ture at the old Fourteenth Street]
Theater.
Subtle Character
Full of color, good nature, and j
some wit, Mirandolina is probably ,
the most subtle of the ten rather'
obvious characters in "The Mis- j
tress of the Inn." She is the cen-1
ter of attraction throughout the j
play, is wooed by most of the men i
in the cast, and springs a big sur-1
prise on everyone concerned be- j
I fore the three acts of comic situ
ations are over. She is confiden-1
tial with the audience, alluring <
with the men, and thoroughly un-j
derstanding with the other women j
in the play—altogether a fascinat- j
ing character with new charms j
cropping out all the time.

I tion, "The Mistress of the Inn,"
■ which is being given here Friday
night under Harold Helvenston,
i acting director of dramatics.
Miss Beede has been seen on the
j qampus stage only once before,
I when she played in S. N. Berh
-1 man's sparkling comedy of four
j characters, "The Second Man," last
I rummer. As the determined young
! ingenue, Monica Grey, whose ob
! ject is to have Clark Storey, she
: was a delightfully disturbing in
-1 fluence in that play. She had Clark
| Storey, the temperamental "au
| tlior" played by Gordon Davis,
tapping his foot because he did not
want her particularly, and Austin
Lowe, the brilliant chemist played
i by Jack McDowell, biting his nails
j because he could not have her.
Opposite McDowell
Miss Beede will be playing op
posite McDowell again in "The
Mistress of the Inn," with him in
the part of Fabrizio, an Italian !
servant at the inn of which she, I
! Mirandolina, is hostess.
The role of Mirandolina, "la lo- |
i candiera" (or the mistress of the
jinn), is one which was immortal
ized by Dus6, who played it in |
Italian in 1905. It has been morel
recently been done by Eva Le Gal-|
lienne, founder and director of the j
New York Civic Repertory Thea- ]
ter, who put on this play in the
opening year of her dramatic veil j
j ture at the old Fourteenth Street]
Theater.
Subtle Character
Full of color, good nature, and j
some wit, Mirandolina is probably ,
the most subtle of the ten rather'
obvious characters in "The Mis- j
tress of the Inn." She is the cen-1
ter of attraction throughout the j
play, is wooed by most of the men i
in the cast, and springs a big sur-1
prise on everyone concerned be- j
I fore the three acts of comic situ
ations are over. She is confiden-1
tial with the audience, alluring <
with the men, and thoroughly un-j
derstanding with the other women j
in the play—altogether a fascinat- j
ing character with new charms j
cropping out all the time.
Ruth Beede, a transfer from
j Mills College, will play the lead in
| Carlo Goldoni's comedy of situa-
I tion, "The Mistress of the Inn,"
