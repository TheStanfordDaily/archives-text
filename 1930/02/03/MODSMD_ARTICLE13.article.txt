j the requisites of any author.
"If you can talk, you can sing,"
j said Mrs. Margaret J. Cheeseman,
' known as Jerry Germaine, the
! "Crooning Balladist" of KPO, who

"Secretarial work is the opening
wedge into the business world,"
said Miss I. L. Macrae, of the vo
i cational information bureau of the
j Women's City Club, in talking on
secretary and department store
work. "Store work offers the big
gest opportunity among all the
j fields for educated women."
