# CARDS IN EVEN BREAK AGAINST BRUIN QUINTET
## Varsity Cagers Play Best Game of Year to Cop Opening Tilt 40-37 Defeat Eliminates Hunts Men From Conference Race; Still in Cellar 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Although breaking even with the
j highly touted P.C.L.A. Bruin live
and playing better ball than they
have all season, Stanford's varsity
cagers were practically eliminated
1 from the Coast Conference title
race over the past week-end in a
hectic double-header on the Card';;
| home court.
The Card quintet has a mathe
matical chance of'tying for first,
j place honors, but one that is not,
! likely to occur. Not only do the
Farm players have to win all of
their remaining games to accom
plish this end, hut the Trojans and
j Bruins must show a complete re
versal of form as well.
Both of the Bruin tilts proved to
he thrillers, Stanford running wild
! in the final stages of Friday night's
! game to come out on top by a score
j of 40 to 37 in an extra period of
j play, and losing out 20 to 1.5 on
the following evening when 'he
| Card offense failed to to in
.sucker shots time alter time.
Speedy Opener
In the opener, which was by far
l the fastest game played on the
i local hardwood this winter, Stan
! ford came from behind in an orgy
|of uncanny basket shooting to
| down the Southern invaders, whn
1 bad things their owe way in the
first half. C.C.L.A., led by Captain
| Larry Wilds, located the hoop from
; all over flie court to pile up a 13.!
to l<> lead at half i ime.
With the Cards seemingly fiul
| classed and snowed umiei by a I.!-
point handicap, the Farm rooter,
were already to leave the Pavilion
with a bad taste in their mouth;;.
But no sooner did the second
period get under way, than the
fireworks started.
Berg, Tyler, and McCaudless
broke through the Bruin defense
at. wili to spray in shots, while the
, Card defense tightened and hold
the I.C.L.A. sharpshooters h"li>
I less. Before the final gun sounded
j enough Stanford tossed basket .
: had swished through the hoop to
tie Ihe count at :! 1 all.
Extra Period Rally
Captain Rothert was thrown out
of the lilt on personal fouls at thi
! stage of the festivities, and thing
began to look dark for the Cards
as Knowles, Bruin center, opened
i the extra period with a set-up shot.
With 111" score even at l.a, Ked
Berg, star of the evening, sank a
long bucket to give Stanford it;
winning margin. .Jusl to cinch mat
ters, Long John Met nidless
sneaked in for a sucker hot to
bring the Cards' total to in points.
Saturday night's game turned
out to be slow and ragged by coni
' parison, with both teams inclined
to "rough it ii])." The players ap
peared to be burned out by the
fast pace set in the series opener,
and had a hard time hitting the
backboard, let alom trying to lo
cale the hoop.
The Bruins again got off to a
flying start and at the end of the
first half were out in front by a
six-point margin Stanford rallied
in l lie closing period and twice
came within one point of tying the
cautious I'.C.L.A. five. But tho
Cards were away off form in shoot
ing and hobbled at least a dozen
set-ups to come out. second best.
For the invaders, Captain Wilds,
Von Hagen, and Lubin stood out by
their play in both tills. Wilds was!
really "hot" on Friday night and
copped high-point honors with 18
tallies. Von Hagen played a clever
floor game and was high-scorer in
Ihe second game with 7 points.
Lubin caused the Cards plenty of
trouble on defense, although Roth
ert outjumped him at center during
both engagements.
All of the Cardinals showed im
provement over their previous
playing, and with a little more
luck at dropping the ball in the net 1
would still be Conference con
tenders. On Saturday the players
seemed to be stark blind at times,
and missed enough easy baskets to
win two or three ordinary games.
When it comes to naming the
outstanding man for Stanford, one
has a hard time judging between
Red Berg and Mike Reynolds.
Berg was easily the head man of
Friday's show, being the cleverest
man on the floor as well as arch
ing in five field goals. Although
l;iiling to find the basket for a
ingle shot on the next evening, the
VHsliy red-head covered the floor
in a most übiquitous manner.
Reynolds seems to have found
himself at last, and was the best
guard on the court during both i
halves of the twin bill. Il<; even out-
Luhined Lubin at recovering the
ball off the backboard on defense.
Don Tyler also came through with
a pair of good performances, as
did Captain Rothert. who was
tossed out of both tills on personal
fouls.

port fee for Holy Year pilgrims.

Extra Period Rally
Captain Rothert was thrown out
of the lilt on personal fouls at thi

began to look dark for the Cards
as Knowles, Bruin center, opened
i the extra period with a set-up shot.

bring the Cards' total to in points.
Saturday night's game turned
out to be slow and ragged by coni

to "rough it ii])." The players ap
peared to be burned out by the
fast pace set in the series opener,
and had a hard time hitting the
backboard, let alom trying to lo
cale the hoop.
The Bruins again got off to a
flying start and at the end of the
first half were out in front by a
six-point margin Stanford rallied
in l lie closing period and twice
came within one point of tying the
cautious I'.C.L.A. five. But tho
Cards were away off form in shoot
ing and hobbled at least a dozen
set-ups to come out. second best.
For the invaders, Captain Wilds,
Von Hagen, and Lubin stood out by
their play in both tills. Wilds was!
really "hot" on Friday night and
copped high-point honors with 18
tallies. Von Hagen played a clever
floor game and was high-scorer in
Ihe second game with 7 points.
Lubin caused the Cards plenty of
trouble on defense, although Roth
ert outjumped him at center during
both engagements.
All of the Cardinals showed im
provement over their previous
playing, and with a little more
luck at dropping the ball in the net 1
would still be Conference con
tenders. On Saturday the players
seemed to be stark blind at times,
and missed enough easy baskets to
win two or three ordinary games.
When it comes to naming the
outstanding man for Stanford, one
has a hard time judging between
Red Berg and Mike Reynolds.
Berg was easily the head man of
Friday's show, being the cleverest
man on the floor as well as arch
ing in five field goals. Although
l;iiling to find the basket for a
ingle shot on the next evening, the
VHsliy red-head covered the floor
in a most übiquitous manner.
Reynolds seems to have found
himself at last, and was the best
guard on the court during both i
halves of the twin bill. Il<; even out-
Luhined Lubin at recovering the
ball off the backboard on defense.
Don Tyler also came through with
a pair of good performances, as
did Captain Rothert. who was
tossed out of both tills on personal
fouls.
Hungary has reduced the pass
port fee for Holy Year pilgrims.
Although breaking even with the
j highly touted P.C.L.A. Bruin live

Extra Period Rally
Captain Rothert was thrown out
of the lilt on personal fouls at thi
! stage of the festivities, and thing
began to look dark for the Cards
as Knowles, Bruin center, opened
i the extra period with a set-up shot.

long bucket to give Stanford it;
winning margin. .Jusl to cinch mat

bring the Cards' total to in points.
Saturday night's game turned
out to be slow and ragged by coni
' parison, with both teams inclined
to "rough it ii])." The players ap
peared to be burned out by the
fast pace set in the series opener,
and had a hard time hitting the
backboard, let alom trying to lo
cale the hoop.
The Bruins again got off to a
flying start and at the end of the
first half were out in front by a
six-point margin Stanford rallied
in l lie closing period and twice
came within one point of tying the
cautious I'.C.L.A. five. But tho
Cards were away off form in shoot
ing and hobbled at least a dozen
set-ups to come out. second best.
For the invaders, Captain Wilds,
Von Hagen, and Lubin stood out by
their play in both tills. Wilds was!
really "hot" on Friday night and
copped high-point honors with 18
tallies. Von Hagen played a clever
floor game and was high-scorer in
Ihe second game with 7 points.
Lubin caused the Cards plenty of
trouble on defense, although Roth
ert outjumped him at center during
both engagements.
All of the Cardinals showed im
provement over their previous
playing, and with a little more
luck at dropping the ball in the net 1
would still be Conference con
tenders. On Saturday the players
seemed to be stark blind at times,
and missed enough easy baskets to
win two or three ordinary games.
When it comes to naming the
outstanding man for Stanford, one
has a hard time judging between
Red Berg and Mike Reynolds.
Berg was easily the head man of
Friday's show, being the cleverest
man on the floor as well as arch
ing in five field goals. Although
l;iiling to find the basket for a
ingle shot on the next evening, the
VHsliy red-head covered the floor
in a most übiquitous manner.
Reynolds seems to have found
himself at last, and was the best
guard on the court during both i
halves of the twin bill. Il<; even out-
Luhined Lubin at recovering the
ball off the backboard on defense.
Don Tyler also came through with
a pair of good performances, as
did Captain Rothert. who was
tossed out of both tills on personal
fouls.
Hungary has reduced the pass
port fee for Holy Year pilgrims.
Although breaking even with the
j highly touted P.C.L.A. Bruin live
and playing better ball than they
have all season, Stanford's varsity
cagers were practically eliminated
1 from the Coast Conference title
race over the past week-end in a
hectic double-header on the Card';;

The Card quintet has a mathe
matical chance of'tying for first,

Farm players have to win all of
their remaining games to accom
plish this end, hut the Trojans and
j Bruins must show a complete re
versal of form as well.
Both of the Bruin tilts proved to
he thrillers, Stanford running wild

! game to come out on top by a score
j of 40 to 37 in an extra period of
j play, and losing out 20 to 1.5 on
