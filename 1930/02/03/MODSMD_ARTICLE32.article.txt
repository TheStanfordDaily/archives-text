# CARDS IN EVEN BREAK AGAINST BRUIN QUINTET
## Varsity Cagers Play Best Game of Year to Cop Opening Tilt 40-37 Defeat Eliminates Hunts Men From Conference Race; Still in Cellar 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Although breaking even with the
j highly touted P.C.L.A. Bruin live
and playing better ball than they
have all season, Stanford's varsity
cagers were practically eliminated
1 from the Coast Conference title
race over the past week-end in a
hectic double-header on the Card';;
| home court.
The Card quintet has a mathe
matical chance of'tying for first,
j place honors, but one that is not,
! likely to occur. Not only do the
Farm players have to win all of
their remaining games to accom
plish this end, hut the Trojans and
j Bruins must show a complete re
versal of form as well.
Both of the Bruin tilts proved to
he thrillers, Stanford running wild
! in the final stages of Friday night's
! game to come out on top by a score
j of 40 to 37 in an extra period of
j play, and losing out 20 to 1.5 on
the following evening when 'he
| Card offense failed to to in
.sucker shots time alter time.
Speedy Opener
In the opener, which was by far
l the fastest game played on the
i local hardwood this winter, Stan
! ford came from behind in an orgy
|of uncanny basket shooting to
| down the Southern invaders, whn
1 bad things their owe way in the
first half. C.C.L.A., led by Captain
| Larry Wilds, located the hoop from
; all over flie court to pile up a 13.!
to l<> lead at half i ime.
With the Cards seemingly fiul
| classed and snowed umiei by a I.!-
point handicap, the Farm rooter,
were already to leave the Pavilion
with a bad taste in their mouth;;.
But no sooner did the second
period get under way, than the
fireworks started.
Berg, Tyler, and McCaudless
broke through the Bruin defense
at. wili to spray in shots, while the
, Card defense tightened and hold
the I.C.L.A. sharpshooters h"li>
I less. Before the final gun sounded
j enough Stanford tossed basket .
: had swished through the hoop to
tie Ihe count at :! 1 all.
Extra Period Rally
Captain Rothert was thrown out
of the lilt on personal fouls at thi
! stage of the festivities, and thing
began to look dark for the Cards
as Knowles, Bruin center, opened
i the extra period with a set-up shot.
With 111" score even at l.a, Ked
Berg, star of the evening, sank a
long bucket to give Stanford it;
winning margin. .Jusl to cinch mat
ters, Long John Met nidless
sneaked in for a sucker hot to
bring the Cards' total to in points.
Saturday night's game turned
out to be slow and ragged by coni
' parison, with both teams inclined
to "rough it ii])." The players ap
peared to be burned out by the
fast pace set in the series opener,
and had a hard time hitting the
backboard, let alom trying to lo
cale the hoop.
The Bruins again got off to a
flying start and at the end of the
first half were out in front by a
six-point margin Stanford rallied
