# WHAT STATUS WOMAN?
## 
### 
Opportunity knocks at a person's door but once in a lifetime, i
so the sages say. The members of the Stanford Five Hundred!
who attended the Associated Women Students' Vocational Con-1
ference Saturday heard the gentle tap as five well-known women
gave their views on the prospects of women in business and enter-1
tainment. They have an idea of what types of careers women arc I
capable of selecting and exploiting to a successful end, and are
now in possession of a number of valuable facts concerning the
practical ways of entering a profession.
The inauguration of the vocational guidance conferences, a
part of ihe general movement which is sweeping American colleges I
and universities, is the first step on the part of the women and the
I niversity toward the solution of the age-old question: "What i
status Woman?"
If the Stanford conferences accomplish no other end than to
help even a few women overcome the ancient prejudices against •;
their se\- in the fields of human endeavor, then these discussions
will be valuable and worthwhile. In the opening of new fields to
women lies a large factor in the future of the world, and it is i
fitting that Stanford be one of the institutions sponsoring such !
•an introduction.
