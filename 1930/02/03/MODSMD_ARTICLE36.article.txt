# AND AFTER GREAT DELIBERATIONâ€”
## 
### 
College boys, Rotarians, and others will be accorded the privi
lege of wearing bargain-counter straw hats this summer while mem
bers of the Five Hundred and their less fortunate sisters will be
forced to grope deeper in the "first national banks" if they wish to
carry those chic embroidered handkerchifs hanging limply from
beaded cosmetic containers. So decreed the august Senate recently
after a day of debate on the much-debated tariff bill.
Meanwhile thirsty \incrica awaits the departure of tariff log
rollers and lobbyists and the arrival of the battle of a decade which
is expected to occur on the Senate floor over the prohibition ques
tion. Rumblings of distant verbal artillery are frequently heard in
Washington, according to press reports, while the Anti-Saloon
League calls for a $50,000,000 sponge to dry up a continent. Surely
America will learn more about the relative merits of strict aridity
and temperate drinking in the next few months than it lias during
the whole ten years since the inauguration of prohibition.
With senatorial primaries looming just over the horizon, hesi
tant senators twiddle their thumbs and talk of straw hats and
pretty kerchiefs, keeping both the thirsty and the camels in stts
pense.
However, siteli topics are safe; for it is certain that American
womanhood will be disturbed but little over an increase in ihe
price of embroidered handkerehiefs and the dominant male will be
delighted at Ihe prospect of reduced installments on summer bead
gear. Anyway, so long as Congress refrains from putting on a
prohibitive tariff on imported cosmetics or Mongolian Chow dogs,
the feminine vote will be saved for the go-getting, prosperity
nurturing Republican party.
