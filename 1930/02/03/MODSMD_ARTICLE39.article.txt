PUBLiC RELATIONS OF THE

The Stanford University Press,
1929.

Belgium was. once described by an
official of the British Foreign Of
j fice as a, piratical state organized
for benevolence.
This commission, founded at (lie
outbreak of the World War with
' Herbert Hoover as its chairman,
was an organization without, pre
cedent in international relations.
It assumed functions which usu
| ally belong only to nations, ft had
i its own flag; it made contracts
and informal treaties with belliger
; ent governments; its ships were
granted privileges accorded no
other flag; its representatives in
'regions of military occupation en
joyed powers and immunities ao
! corded to those of no other recog
nized nation.
As a private institution, the
: C.lt.li. had a financial record com-
I paring in size with the largest cor
porations. Its gross income of
' $900,000,000 is unprecedented in
the history of philanthropy.

j files of the Hoover War Library,
I which are contained in these two
1 volumes, tell the story of this ex
traordinary organization, which
fed nine million people in an area
covering 19,455 square miles for
four years.

pages of the book is of a statistical
! nature and makes rather dry read

PUBLiC RELATIONS OF THE
COMMISSION FOR RELIEF IN

The Stanford University Press,

The Commission for Relief in
Belgium was. once described by an
official of the British Foreign Of
j fice as a, piratical state organized
for benevolence.
This commission, founded at (lie
outbreak of the World War with
' Herbert Hoover as its chairman,
was an organization without, pre
cedent in international relations.
It assumed functions which usu
| ally belong only to nations, ft had
i its own flag; it made contracts
and informal treaties with belliger
; ent governments; its ships were
granted privileges accorded no
other flag; its representatives in
'regions of military occupation en
joyed powers and immunities ao
! corded to those of no other recog
nized nation.
As a private institution, the
: C.lt.li. had a financial record com-
I paring in size with the largest cor
porations. Its gross income of
' $900,000,000 is unprecedented in
the history of philanthropy.
The 680 documents from the
j files of the Hoover War Library,
I which are contained in these two
1 volumes, tell the story of this ex
traordinary organization, which
fed nine million people in an area
covering 19,455 square miles for
four years.
