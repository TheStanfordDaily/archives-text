AIJ. attendance records were broken by the thousands that
crowded into the San Francisco Civic Auditorium the first
two days of the Fourteenth Annual Pacific Automobile Show
which opened Saturday. Contrary to all expectations the greatest
:rowd in the history of the show thronged the auditorium the
first day and there were no less yesterday, which indicates that
norp than 100.000 people will have seen the show by the time it
'loses Saturday night.
The unprecedented interest shown in the show may be due in
pari to the most interesting group of motor cars displayed on the
auditorium floor in years and rilso to the entertainment featuring
Maurice Chevalier. George A. Wahlgreen, the manager, has ar
ranged the exhibits and the entertainment with the touch of a
master showman.
Never before in its fourteen years of existence has the Pacific
Automobile Show featured four types ot power plant. 'I here are
fours, sixes, eights, and even a sixteen. In tact, the 10-cylinder
car, a Y-t.vpe twin eight, five new eight-cylinder cars, and a new

racy front-wheel drive car have never been seen at any other
show. i
The new 16-cylimler car is without a doubt the feature exhibit
among the motor groups. It is always the center of attention of
the crowds who are intrigued by the compactness of its engine
and bv the beauty.of its body lines.
The present trend in motors is in evidence at the show. The
eights are more popular than ever this year. They are displacing
the sixes just as the sixes displaced the fours several seasons ago.
However, the sixes and fours are attracting their share of
attention' from the motoring public which is thronging the audi
torium. Tltev are offering new stylish lines and the concensus of
opinion seems to be that they are presenting more alluring color
combinations than ever before.
The versatile salesmen on duty to answer the queries of the
public assure all that- the 1930 models offer more power and
greater speed and more dollar-for dollar value than ever before.
The price trend varies, hi the lower price ranges the cars have

been listed at lower prices in
most instances, while in the price
bracket ranging about the $1500
mark, price increases seem to be
the rule.
The showings are not confined
to passenger cars alone. New
1930 model trucks are also on
display. On the mezzanine floor
■>112 the auditorium are complete
lines of automobile accessories.
Quite as much of an attraction
is the remarkable display of auto
mobiles is Maurice Chevalier,
famous Paramount motion pic
ture star, who makes a personal
appearance every afternoon and
evening. He calls his twenty
minute performances "The Dis
play with a Personality," and is
scoring with the same success
that has made him the idol of
two continents.
Rudy Sieger and his famous
orchestra arc also entertaining the
show patrons with their enchant
ing music. In addition to both
Chevalier and Sieger interesting
talking picture films are being
shown in the various exhibits.
This is a feature new to the show
this year.
The auto show, which runs un
til Saturday night, opens each
day at 12 noon and closes at
10:30 o'clock. On Saturday
morning the show will open at
10 o'clock.

show patrons with their enchant
ing music. In addition to both
Chevalier and Sieger interesting
talking picture films are being
shown in the various exhibits.
This is a feature new to the show
this year.
The auto show, which runs un
til Saturday night, opens each
day at 12 noon and closes at
10:30 o'clock. On Saturday
morning the show will open at
10 o'clock.


AIJ. attendance records were broken by the thousands that
crowded into the San Francisco Civic Auditorium the first
two days of the Fourteenth Annual Pacific Automobile Show
which opened Saturday. Contrary to all expectations the greatest
:rowd in the history of the show thronged the auditorium the
first day and there were no less yesterday, which indicates that
norp than 100.000 people will have seen the show by the time it
'loses Saturday night.
The unprecedented interest shown in the show may be due in
pari to the most interesting group of motor cars displayed on the
auditorium floor in years and rilso to the entertainment featuring
Maurice Chevalier. George A. Wahlgreen, the manager, has ar
ranged the exhibits and the entertainment with the touch of a
master showman.
Never before in its fourteen years of existence has the Pacific
Automobile Show featured four types ot power plant. 'I here are
fours, sixes, eights, and even a sixteen. In tact, the 10-cylinder
car, a Y-t.vpe twin eight, five new eight-cylinder cars, and a new

racy front-wheel drive car have never been seen at any other
show. i
The new 16-cylimler car is without a doubt the feature exhibit
among the motor groups. It is always the center of attention of
the crowds who are intrigued by the compactness of its engine
and bv the beauty.of its body lines.
The present trend in motors is in evidence at the show. The
eights are more popular than ever this year. They are displacing
the sixes just as the sixes displaced the fours several seasons ago.
However, the sixes and fours are attracting their share of
attention' from the motoring public which is thronging the audi
torium. Tltev are offering new stylish lines and the concensus of
opinion seems to be that they are presenting more alluring color
combinations than ever before.
The versatile salesmen on duty to answer the queries of the
public assure all that- the 1930 models offer more power and
greater speed and more dollar-for dollar value than ever before.
The price trend varies, hi the lower price ranges the cars have

been listed at lower prices in
most instances, while in the price
bracket ranging about the $1500
mark, price increases seem to be
the rule.
The showings are not confined
to passenger cars alone. New
1930 model trucks are also on
display. On the mezzanine floor
■>112 the auditorium are complete
lines of automobile accessories.
Quite as much of an attraction
is the remarkable display of auto
mobiles is Maurice Chevalier,
famous Paramount motion pic
ture star, who makes a personal
appearance every afternoon and
evening. He calls his twenty
minute performances "The Dis
play with a Personality," and is
scoring with the same success
that has made him the idol of
two continents.
Rudy Sieger and his famous
orchestra arc also entertaining the
show patrons with their enchant
ing music. In addition to both
Chevalier and Sieger interesting
talking picture films are being
shown in the various exhibits.
