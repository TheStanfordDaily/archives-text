## Wolves Feared as Search In Arctic Continues 
### 
SEATTLE, Feb. 2. (/p)—Though I
six fliers —three Americans, a j
Canadian and two Russians —are j
bound by order and pledge to re-1
main on the bleak Arctic shore of !
Siberia until the bodies of Carl Ben
Eielson and Earl Borland are
found, apprehension increased
among pioneers here and in Alaska j
today that wolves have left no j
trace of the aviators.
Ole Eielson, father of Alaska's
famous air pioneer, himself ex
pressed that fear while waiting
here to sail on the Northwestern
Wednesday for Seward, Alaska.
Rescuers have been digging for j
a week over the wide area where j
wreckage of Eielson's plane was |
strewn when it crashed nearly i
three months ago !><) miles south-1
east of North Cape. Clothing worn !
by the missing men and parts of i
the plane were found deeply buried i
by snows which have fallen since j
the two men hopped off from
Alaska to lake passengers and furs j
off the icebound ship Nanuk at:
North Cape.
