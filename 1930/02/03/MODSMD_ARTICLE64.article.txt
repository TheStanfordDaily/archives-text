# STANFORD TOSSERS SCORE 5-1 VICTORY OVER ATHENS CLUB
## 
### 
The third time's the charm, i
Stanford's baseball varsity finally j
vindicated itself after two previous
defeats, taking an easy game from
the Athens Club nine on the local
diamond last Saturday by a score
of 5 to 1. Story and Loomis, Card
pitchers, walked eight men be
tween them, but proved effective
in the pinches, and the lledshirts
had a bin day at the bat, collect
ing 10 hits in eight innings.
The clubmen were playing their
first game of the season, which
largely accounts for their poor
showing both in the field and at
bat. Altogether they made eight 1
errors and were able to amass only
five hits, all from Loomis' offer- 1
ings.
Stanford garnered two tallies in |
the first inning on singles by :
Churchill, Johnson, and Hunken
and a sacrifice fly by Laird, and ■
two more in the second canto on
an error and hits by Campbell, Os
will, Story, and Churchill. The final
run came in the fifth when Oswill
scored on a series of errors by
the club men. The rally was cut
short when Captain Laird at bat
with the bases stacked knocked a !
hot grounder down the third base i
line, hitting Story, and making an
automatic putout.
The Oakland outfit made their j
one and only score in the eighth ■
frame when Starainsen hit a 1
single, advanced on Rintala's error
and a passed ball, and scored on
J. Bill's sacrifice fly to Hunken.
