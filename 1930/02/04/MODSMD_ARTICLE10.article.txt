# INNER ARCH TO FRAME SETTINGS OF "THE MISTRESS OF THE INN"
## 
### Elisabeth Larsh Â» 
An inner proscenium arch, on
which a Venetian street scene is de
picted in gay colors, will frame all of j
the scenes in the Dramatic Council's '
production of "The Mistress of the
Inn" Friday night in the Assembly j
Hall. The arch has been constructed I
within the regular permanent one, es- i
pecially for this play.
This inner proscenium, being so |
built that it is visible to the audience ;
at all times, is made of dyed muslin |
drops, on which is painted the exte-i
rior of the inn at which all the action !
takes place. It will be used before the !
play and between acts. The use of <
this device throughout the seven !
scenes of action gives an effect which |
i> hardly realistic, but one which is |
extremely suitable to this comedy of j
manners b\ Carlo Goldoni, Italian
eighteenth-century playwright.
Ingenious Shifts
All of the actual sets arc colorful
and rharmiug interiors of the inn, tin
action of the play shifting from one
room in Mirandolina's hostelry to an
other. Many of the same units are !
retained in several scenes, partial- i
lai'lv "Hats"; but the ingenious wa\ iu i

which they are used makes each new j
set a room apparently very different.
A door is exchanged for a window J
here, a fireplace for a door there, and j
so on. A screen covers a fireplace, j
and a tapestry, a window, so that a j
fresh effect is achieved each time.
Like most old Italian inns, Miran- j
dolina's is not a luxurious one; but |
there is a decided distinction between '
the expensive rooms and the more j
reasonable ones. That occupied by the
Count of Albafiorita, a wealthy, os- J
tcntatious nobleman, is unmistakably :
an attempt at luxury on the part of I
the mistress.
Italian Furniture
A number of old Italian pieces ot 1
furniture and fabrics have been se- j
cured for Friday's performances by j
the property crew, as well as uumer- I
out bottles and wine glasses. Some '
genuine early eighteenth - century j
books will be among the properties,
having been purchased a' two and a I
half cents apiece.
All of the sets have been construct- j
ed by the class in theatrical work
shop, under Frederick Stover, acting
technical director, who came here
from Vale at the beginning of the
year.
