# AIR LINES SHOULD SEEK ADVICE OF WEATHER PROPHETS—RICARD
## 
### William Grace ■ 
"A sudden storm? Who can ex
plain sudden storms? Well, il is
not beyond prediction, but air lines
don't ask about them. I'm dead
sure more forecasting would be of
great help. Why should a storm
rise suddenly, as squalls do at sea,
for instance?"
Father Jerome Six!us Ricard, our
neighbor at Santa Clara Univer
sity, answers his own question in
believing that the storm which
wrecked an air liner ai San Cle
mente this month, like all weather
is caused, and does not just "hap
pen."
Born in Plaisiaus, France, and i
educated iu Turin, Italy, Father
Ricard lias been under the stars j
al Santa Clara since 1887. A charm
ing, humorous old man, his heavy 1
lines of thought have left no lines
upon his brow. Can this man be a
mathematician, I thought? With
black robes, stout figure, a griz
zled head, and jolly face, he .seemed
to fit in with Hi" vine-covered
cloisters of the mission. We went
into the observatory which the
Knights of Columbus have built
for him on the campus, into the

little office where lie has hauled
the sunspols from the sky to work
puzzles in weather for him.
"Depending on the major planets'
movements, great "whorls of gas
with magnetic force move across
the sun. They are called sunstorms,
or sunspots, and, when moving
counterclockwise, cause similar
storms on the earth by creating
areas of low barometric pressure.
Do you see?" The Father lit his
pipe. He talks about these terrible
forces of nature in the voice in
which lie would tell David and the
Lion's Den to a little boy.
Sunspots and Weather
By figuring what forces of plan
ets will be at work, he can tell
how the sunspots will lie far in
advance years. I asked? "Well,
yes, but it takes some calculating,"
chuckled Father Ricard. "I could
tell for ii football gairie whether
or not there would be a storm."
Newspapers quoted the Padre of
the Rains as predicting a dry Janu
ary to which he recently replied
by simply explaining an assistant's
error escaping his supervision be
fore the papers grabbed the copy.
