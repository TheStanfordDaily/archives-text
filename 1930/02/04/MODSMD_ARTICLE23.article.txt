# AIR LINES SHOULD SEEK ADVICE OF WEATHER PROPHETS—RICARD
## 
### William Grace ■ 
"A sudden storm? Who can ex
plain sudden storms? Well, il is
not beyond prediction, but air lines
don't ask about them. I'm dead
sure more forecasting would be of
great help. Why should a storm
rise suddenly, as squalls do at sea,
for instance?"
Father Jerome Six!us Ricard, our
neighbor at Santa Clara Univer
sity, answers his own question in
believing that the storm which
wrecked an air liner ai San Cle
mente this month, like all weather
is caused, and does not just "hap
pen."
Born in Plaisiaus, France, and i
educated iu Turin, Italy, Father
Ricard lias been under the stars j
al Santa Clara since 1887. A charm
ing, humorous old man, his heavy 1
lines of thought have left no lines
upon his brow. Can this man be a
mathematician, I thought? With
black robes, stout figure, a griz
zled head, and jolly face, he .seemed
to fit in with Hi" vine-covered
cloisters of the mission. We went
into the observatory which the
Knights of Columbus have built
for him on the campus, into the

little office where lie has hauled
the sunspols from the sky to work
puzzles in weather for him.
"Depending on the major planets'
movements, great "whorls of gas
with magnetic force move across
the sun. They are called sunstorms,
or sunspots, and, when moving
counterclockwise, cause similar
storms on the earth by creating
areas of low barometric pressure.
Do you see?" The Father lit his
pipe. He talks about these terrible
forces of nature in the voice in
which lie would tell David and the
Lion's Den to a little boy.
Sunspots and Weather
By figuring what forces of plan
ets will be at work, he can tell
how the sunspots will lie far in
advance years. I asked? "Well,
yes, but it takes some calculating,"
chuckled Father Ricard. "I could
tell for ii football gairie whether
or not there would be a storm."
Newspapers quoted the Padre of
the Rains as predicting a dry Janu
ary to which he recently replied
by simply explaining an assistant's
error escaping his supervision be
fore the papers grabbed the copy.
Eighty years old this mouth, he is
more accurate with his predictions
than he is with his publicity. I had
the satisfaction of looking back to
the Los Angeles Times for Decem
ber 20 when the Father himself
said in an interview, "We are due
for a clear Christmas and a clear
New Year's Day. Rain will start
in January and continue through
the winter and well on into May."
Astronomers Dislike Work
Scientists, like the public, have
differed widely as to the value of
Father Ricard's work. "Take the
astronomers," he said. "They have
done their best, to knock me out,
but the Smithsonian Institution has
recognized my findings. United
States Weather Bureau officials
here on the coast are in sympathy
with my work, and are very fine
men, but it is the chief at Washing
ton who lias been opposing 'weather
prophets' with all his might, and
we are completely ignored by the
air lines."
Admitting that his work is a
mere nibble in this fruitful field,
the Padre hopes for co-operation
from universities all over the coun
try; it would achieve so much
more that. way. How about that as
a career for college men, 1 queried.
"The more the merrier," he
laughed. "But 1 hope they help the
farmers, tell him what crops he
can plant each winter in safety.
Universities often don't think of
those things. They are too learned
—they know too much."
I showed Father Ricard an arti
cle on making rain by electricity.
He takes off his glasses to read,
and puts them back on his nose to
talk. "What do you think of that?"
I asked. He had a long chuckle all
t6 himself, consulted his pipe, and
finally said, "Well, maybe."
