# A 						QUESTION OF HONOR

Stanford's most Iniid famih skeleton I lonoi I'ode violation—
has been dragged from the closet again.
I lie I) a11 s ( ampus < (pinion column carries loday a communi
cation b\ one who signs hi in.sell "Shocked The letter charges
that a case o{ wholesale cheating occurred during a recent exami
nation— that one-third ol those heing quizzed walked out of the
room and gained information on the subject in violation of the
I low)t" I ode.
I he Daily has investigated this charge, and has found it justi
fied. The faculty member giving the examination left the room, as
he is expected to do, and during his absence a verv bald and very
general violation occurred. Anonymous letters from members of i
the class inlormcd the professor ol these abuses, and he made ar
rangements for giving the examination over again, so that no injus
tice should 1 e done those who refrained from dishonest v.
'!(» those who believe in student government and in the inherent (
trustworthiness of mankind, this situation is distressing. And that
is putting it mildly.
I here is a very obvious root to the evil, of course. Student leth-,
argv in reporting violations which are observed is responsible for'
the situation in other words, the honest students themselves are re
ponsihle. As long as such acts are merelv resented, and not re
ported, no progress will be made. Resentment must be made of
terner stuff than that.
I he I)aii v does not believe that the I lown* ( ode is rotten, nor
does the Daily believe that the system is failing, lint the I lonor |
( ode cannot be called a success, not when students sit bv and watch ,
a third of a class cheat in an examination without doing anvthing
more than writing anonymous letters to an instructor.
Many times before it has been said that the success or the failure
' I the Honor ( ode lie- solely in the hands of the students. That !
just as true toda_\ as it ever was. 11 Stanford men and women want
a system of honor and not a system of policing, and want that svs- |
tem of honor to work, they must banish the hallucination that re
porting cheats is mean and unadmirable.
