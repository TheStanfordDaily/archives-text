HER FRIEND THE KING—At the
President Theatre.
i Her Friend the King is a very
usual play. II employs a number
of the ancient coruic devices in a
manner I hat is not strikingly origi
nal, hut which successfully in
spires in I lie audience a fair
amount of laughter.
In this the play is not disap
pointing. Hut.one expects from lhe
much-advertised heroine, Miss
Alice Joyce of motion picture fame,
at least a creditable performance.
In this expectation the great ma
jority of the audiences seem to he
! justly disappointed. Indeed, it is
difficult to see why any producer
should have chosen Miss Joyce for
i any part in a play. She seems to
he suffering from intense nervous
ness throughout the comedy, as
half her lines are either stammered
or spoken 100 rapidly to be effec
tive. Moreover, on the stage, she
j lacks beauty and nearly every
other variety of appeal.
Miss Flora Bramley, the Princess
Lydia of the play, gives no remark
able piece of acting, but far out
shines the star. Her voice is pleas
ing, she speaks (dearly, and slu- is
quite beautiful in her costume for
the third act.
Hale Hamilton is rather well
lifted to his part as exiled King,
and his wit is well received. He,
as well as the supporting players,
is fully as good as the play de
serves.
In all, Her Friend the King is as

| good entertainment as the average
! motion picture; it is no better. The
I stage, to he sure, has a certain
I charm of its own; hut in a play
such as this it lacks some of the
, possibilities of the cinema.
As Mr. Dulfy charges no more
j for admission than do many of the
| theatres presenting no lunger silent
j drama, no one is very seriously
| cheated. —E. W.

difficult to see why any producer
should have chosen Miss Joyce for
i any part in a play. She seems to
he suffering from intense nervous
ness throughout the comedy, as
half her lines are either stammered
or spoken 100 rapidly to be effec
tive. Moreover, on the stage, she
j lacks beauty and nearly every
other variety of appeal.
Miss Flora Bramley, the Princess
Lydia of the play, gives no remark
able piece of acting, but far out
shines the star. Her voice is pleas
ing, she speaks (dearly, and slu- is
quite beautiful in her costume for
the third act.
Hale Hamilton is rather well
lifted to his part as exiled King,
and his wit is well received. He,
as well as the supporting players,
is fully as good as the play de
serves.
In all, Her Friend the King is as

| good entertainment as the average
! motion picture; it is no better. The
I stage, to he sure, has a certain
I charm of its own; hut in a play
such as this it lacks some of the
, possibilities of the cinema.

HER FRIEND THE KING—At the

i Her Friend the King is a very

In this the play is not disap
pointing. Hut.one expects from lhe
much-advertised heroine, Miss

at least a creditable performance.
