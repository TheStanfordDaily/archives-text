# STANFORD BUILDS "BOOING" PRESTIGE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Some of us are perhaps at this
lime aware of Ihe unsportsmanlike
conduct at our basketball games.
If we are not, il is evident I hat
the general public is. Our prestige
is suffering as I lie result of persist
ent, unnecessary "booing." il just
is not done elsewhere, and Ihe
sooner our "collegiate" freshman
and some of the older brothers
learn ibis fact, Ihe better off we
will he.
The officials for each game have
definite qualificulions. They know
more about basketball than you or
I, so why not leave them alone. It

I is nol ill) easy task to referee n
fast Kami!, and those who "Ijoo"
are merely showing how little they
know a hont t lie sport.
Such conduct cost us an extra
point ut lust Saturday's .mime. It
might have been an important
point. Unfortunately the referee
was forced, to rely on micli an ;t -
i I ion.
Let us endeavor to curb such
; conduct in the future, and direct
i our support to better channels. It
will mean more to the team, and
Stanford's prestige will nol be
I rumpled on.
Sincerely, .1. .VI. Nunes.
