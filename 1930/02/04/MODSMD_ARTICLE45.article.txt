"TO MAKE A ROMAN HOLIDAY"
The wholly uncalled-for out
break of Bronx cheers, in the
form of boo 3 and vociferous
"razzberries" that marred the
all-University boxing tourney
last Thursday night gives rise
to speculation as to just what
some people believe a student
body card entitles them. Also,
do the various gentlemen not
affiliated with the University
who paid a dollar to witness
the bouts believe that the
aforesaid iron man entitles
them to a mild form of man
slaughter?
JVIr. Peter Flanagan, who did an
efficient job of refereeing the
.scraps, was the object of mil eh
caustic comment from the gallery
because he stopped several lights
and awarded the victory to one of
the contestants on a technical
knockout, when the loser was ap
parently unhurt. We say "appar
ently" advisedly, because Flana
gan, a former boxer himself, was
in the best position to judge
whether or not the man was in a
condition to continue without ill
efleef. Furthermore, if Flanagati
did err, he is to be congratulated
rather than condemned for acting
hastily instead of halting the bouts
too late. A dazed boxer can he
badly hurt by a punch for which
he has no defense.
The crux of the whole mat tel
lies in the inability of certain
bloodthirsty persons to distinguish
between the respective purposes of
professional and collegiate boxing.
The professional game has as its
objective money-making, and any
one who lias paid four or live dol
lars to watch a couple of beetle
browed behemoths tin-can through
ten tepid rounds (which happens
only too often in this state) can
hardly he blamed for giving voice
to his disgust.
Collegiate boxing, on the other
hand, is primarily for the benefit
of the participants, and the spec
tators are really only incidental to
the sport. The sport makes no
money for the University—that is
not its raison d'etre —and the
boxers' only remuneration is the
physical good it does them and the
chance to earn a circle block let
ter. Little enough, say we, without
expecting them to stage a gory
spectacle to satiate the desires of
gallery gods with atavistic ten
dencies.
Coach Harry Maloney has
striven long and mightily to
give boxing a deserved place
in the list of Stanford's ath
letics. A few more exhibitions
similar to that of Thursday
must inevitably undo all his
good work and sound the death
knell of the sport on the cam
pus, —Dick Friendlich.
