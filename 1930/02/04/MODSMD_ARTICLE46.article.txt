# COAST CONFERENCE INDIVIDUAL SCORING HONORS UNDECIDED
## 
### 
Three weeks remain in which to
deride the basketball championship
of tbe southern division of the
< oast conference. The race for
team honors has already begun to
narrow down, but the battle for
individual scoring honors is just
as much of a free-for-all as ever.
Carl Knowles, U.C.L.A. center,
managed to pick up 14 points in
the two games with Stanford and
clinibcd back into the lead in the
scoring race. He now has a total
of r>:i points, just one point more
than his teammate and captain,
Larry Wilds, who jumped from
sixth to second place last week.
Hotli of these Bruins have shot 21
field goals. Knowles leads Wilds
by the margin of one free throw.
Johnny McCandless, Card cen
ter, is back in third place again
with an even 50 points. Johnny has
i nng up more baskets than any
other player in the conference, but
hasn't been so fortunate in free
I brows.
Jack (Jardner, I'.S.C. forward,
could not find the basket consist
ently in the game with California
and dropped from first to fourth
place. He has a total of 47 points.
California's two forwards, Bill
'Iripp and Kent Purse], are fifth
and sixth respectively in the scor- j
ing column. Tripp has made 44
points and Pursel has made 41.
Johnny Lehners, Trojan captain,
ih in seventh place with 35 points,
lie is the only guard among the
first ten scorers.
