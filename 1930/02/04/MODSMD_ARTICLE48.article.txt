TONIGHT'S STARTING LINEUP
St. Ignatius— Stanford —

Bareilles G Reynolds

Playing their fourth tough game
within a week, Stanford's varsity
cagers are scheduled by sports
critics to take a sound thumping
on the borne hardwood tonight at
eight o'clock, when they tangle
with the veteran HI. Ignatius five.
Heralded as I lie best college
quintet on the coast, the San Fran
cisco hoop-punishers have been
winning most of their games to
date with the greatest of regular
ity, bowing to only the Rossi Flor
ists and the Alliens Club by slim
margins.
To balance this pair of losses,
St. Ignatius has trounced eight
fearns, all composed of fair coun
try basketball players. Among
these latter wins are lop-sided
scores over St. Mary's, Santa
Clara, Olympic Club, and l)e Paw
University, touted as one of the
strongest outfits in the Middlewest.
Cards at Peak
On the other hand, the Cards
have evidently found themselves
at last, putting up two first-class
exhibitions with the U.C.L.A.
Bruins during ihe past week-end.
The Farm players broke faster on
offense and displayed more clever
floorwork than has been shown by
Stanford teams for a number of
years gone by.
Only erratic shooting, which
verged on being ludicrous at times, ,
kept the Cards from handing the
Westwood lads a most brutal beat
ing on Saturday night. Stanford
far outpassed tlie Bruins and had
at least twice as many shots at the j
basket, but the ball just wouldn't
drop through the net and evaded
the hoop with unlucky consistency.
The Cards apparently lost their
eyes through over-activity, having
burned themselves out on the pre
vious evening and also against
the Olympic Club only three days
removed. And so to put his boys
on edge for tonight's anticipated
hectic affair, Coach Husky Hunt
gave his firsLstring a much-de
served rest yesterday afternoon,
confining tlie regulars' workout to
a short session of locating the bas
ket.
Stars Benched
Hunt has also decided to bench;
Red Berg and Long John McCand
less tonight, in order to get his ,
sliarpshooting combination in the 1
best of shape for Friday's Confer
ence tussle with the Trojans. Both
of these men appeared to be stale;
in the closing Bruin tilt, after
pulling the first engagement out of
the tire with a spurt of uncanny
shooting.
Hud Hawkins is scheduled to (ill
McCandless' berth at center, when
the game gets under way this eve- j
ning, while Berg's place at forward
will he taken care of by lanky Jim
Mears. Mears has been showing up
well in practice scrimmages lately j
and his added height may enhance I
Stanford's chances in downing the
elongated St. Ignatius live.
Veteran Trio
Included in the Saint lineup are
Maloney, Cameron, and Bareilles, a
trio of experienced court cavorters
who have been playing together |
for the past seven or eight years. |
After being the mainstays of th"
St. Ignatius high school quintet for
four years, this trio proceeded to
get a monopoly on the college var I
sity five, and has taken the vari
ous hardwoods up and down the'
Coast by storm for the past three
seasons.
