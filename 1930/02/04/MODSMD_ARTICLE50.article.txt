# GIVING 'EM THE DOUBLE-O
## Harvard and Yale Teams Are a Unique Pair of Rivals In Gridiron and Baseball Diamond Encounters 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Well, well, well! If here aren't
our old playmates, Albie Wood and
Barry Booth, I mean Barry Wood
and Albie Booth, sophomore quar
terbacks of the Harvard and Yale
football teams respectively in 1H2!»,
and at present very busy little
members of the winter sports teams
of the Crimson and Blue. Barry,
one of tiie greatest forward pass
ers in tlie history of football, is
making passes on the ice now for
dear old Harvard, while Albie,
neatest little broken-field runner
that Yale lias had in years, is run
ning around on the basketball
courts- tossing the melon for dear
old Efi.
And it won't be long now before
Barry and Albie will meet again,
this time on the diamond, for both
are expert baseball players and
should face each other, barring
accidents, many more times in
their athletic careers, on both
gridiron and diamond. Too had that
they can't fix up sort of a combina
tion hockey-basketball game for
Albie and Barry to test each
other's mettle in.. It could either
be played on skates on the ice,
using a basketball as a puck (ima
gine socking that witli a hockey
stick!), or it could be played on

• the courts using a rubber disc to
! toss into the baskets.
All kidding aside, these two hoys
I are really remarkable all-around
athletes. Albie was captain of his
freshman football, baseball, and
basketball teams. Barry is not only
a star at football, baseball, and
hockey, but he has been chosen
as a member of the 1930 U.S. Davis
Cup squad. The careers of these
two fine lads seem to be about as
entwined as the two "O's" that
appear in both their last names,
i More power to them!
