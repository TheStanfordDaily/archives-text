# VARSITY NINE WILL MEET ATHENS CLUB ON HOME DIAMOND
## 
### 
With a record of one victory and
Iwo defeats, Coach Wolter's var
sity bull-tOHsers will take 011 tli
Lee's Haberdashers team on the
local diamond tomorrow afternoon.
After two bad starts, the Card nine
played its best game of the season
last Saturday against the Athens
Club, and should do even better
in tomorrow's tilt.
Little is known about the semi
pro outfit, but in past years the
haberdashery ban put out some
good teams, and if this year's line
up is as good as usual, the Red
shirts may he in for their third
defeat.
With the exception of the pitcher,
"Wolter plans to start the same
lineup that played in the Athens
Club contest. Either Leverenz or
Perry Taylor will be on the mound
tomorrow, Taylor starting unless
his sinus trouble and a hand blister
are still bothering him.
The rest of the lineup will be:
Oswill, c; Wright, lb; Churchill,
L'h; Laird, 3b; Johnson, ss; Hun
ken, If; Rintala, cf; Campbell, rf.
