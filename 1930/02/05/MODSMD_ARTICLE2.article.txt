1928 world champion diver, Reggy

Wally Colbath of Northwestern,
national intercollegiate champion.

frosh team, will make the back
stroke and 440-yard swims far from,
latne. John McKelvey, another
sophomore, has been doing excel
lent time in the sprints, and will
probably press Reggy Harrison
hard in the short distances. In the
breast-stroke the duel between

Fletcher, '32, will furnish plenty of
excitement. Burns swims close to
national intercollegiate time in that
event.

has Ihe most promise. His events
are the 220- and 410-yard swims,
and lie will be closely watched in
