# PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN PUBLIC LIFE SHOWN BY MRS. SPRINGER-RICE
## 
### BY SYLVA WEAVER 
"1 don't think women feminists
are satisfied with their purely po
| litical activity," said Mrs. Margaret
I Spring-Rice last night in an inter
j view with the Daily. "Vet any
[thought of marriage is considered
J traitorous and heretical by British
: feminists. To me such an attitude
I .
j is nonsense.
Ancient Prejudices
AH vocational fields are open to
; women in England except the For
eign Office and the Church, accord
j ing to the woman leader, "in
! America it is taken for granted
that women will work and work
well, but in England there are cen
; furies of prejudices against the sex
j which must be broken down," con
l tinned Mrs. Spring-Rice, "but the
j accommodations have not been in
creased. However, there is none
1 of the co-education sttidt as I see
| here at Stanford. The women are
lan entirely distinct unit and they
i do not enter the college life."
The educational facilities for
I women were described by the Brit
ish leader. "About five-hundred wo
men attend Cambridge while a
slightly larger number go to Ox

| ford. The provincial institutions
â€¢ .scarcely draw the women at all. II
is very much less usual for Eng
, lisli girls to go to college than it is
{ in America. A really stiff entrance
examination and limited accoinmo
, dations keep down the number of
women students,"
The prevalence of women in
public life was emphasized by Mrs.
Spring-Hice. "Women are now in
civil service and medical positions,
and there is one woman in the
present Labor Cabinet. The Labor
party is by far the most demo
cratic and emancipated in its at
titude, toward women," the femin
! ist wen I on.
Never Replace Men
"But for all the women's strug
gle," Mrs. Spring-Rice concluded
with a smile, "we're still face to
face with the fact that women are
women and can never take men's
places. Personally, 1 am in favor of
the extension of education into
lines fitting women to be mothers
and wives and this training can
also be put to use in medical and
health service by those who do not
marry."
