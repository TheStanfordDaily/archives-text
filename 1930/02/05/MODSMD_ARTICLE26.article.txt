Outfighting and generally out
j playing the highly tout (id Gray
j Fog Five, Coach Husky Hunt': var
sity cagers handed the dope sliest
( one of its most brutal beatings in
years, when they downed St Igna
i tius ."!4 to 24 last night in the Farm
Pavilion before a howling tuoh of
j spectators.
Strutting out on the hardwood
j at the opening tip-off as though
they were cinches to end on the
j long end of the score, the Grav
Fog players were harrasscd a: well
las surprised to find themselv.
| trailing the Cards by a I I to 1::
margin at half t imo.
The play in the initial period wa
J ragged and slow on both side: ,
I with the Stanford combination
| lineup of subs and regulars display
i ing the little pep and fight tiiat
j there was.
False Threat
Coming back with blood in I heir
| eyes, the Ignatius lads lied Hit l
j count in rapid fashion, when
j Kleckner arched in a difficult shot,
i A few moments later the Gray For.
rooters went wild as Cane ton
j tipped in a sucker shot to put hi
i team out in front at 17 to 1.6. Tlr
l St. Ignatius joviality was shorl
-1 lived, however, as Vance Fawcett
retaliated with a one-handed ha;
ket from out near the foul line.
From then on, Stanford had
; things pretty much its own way,
i with the players showing flashe
| of real teamwork us well as finding
| the hoop with regularity. The Gray
I Fog men became befuddled as lhe
j Card score grew in size and wor
j sucked out of position time alter
j time, allowing Hunt's boys most
excellent shots from under the has
j ket.
Long John McCandless, at een
| ter for the home aggregation, lea
i tured the high securing rally with
three timely shots, though lie wa
| materially helped with fast floor
work on the part of Red Berg and
j Fawcett, and the great defensive
â–  play of Mike Reynolds, who wa
! without a doubt the star of the
evening's hectic festivities.
Bareilles Stars
For the losers, Bareilles, at
! guard, stood out with bis lain
and clever handling of th<' ball.
! He also connected with a couple
I of lengthy baskets to take high
; scoring honors for his squad with
| seven markers. Moloney and Klerk
j ner looked good on ol'fcn <\ in
I spurts, while Cameron gave th '
I Cards plenty of trouble on dofeiis'
Besides Reynolds, who p,\aye<l
i the best guarding game seen on
: the local court this season, recover
ing tho ball off the backboard with
' seeming ease, and MrCaudh . ,
! high-point man of the tilt with thir
teen tallies to his credit, houndinr.
1 Don Tyler came through v/M 11 an
| outstanding performance. Although
slapped down on the floor from
! time to time, Tyler was in th"
middle of every offensive atta- I
[ and swished in two basket: v.he .
they were most needed.
