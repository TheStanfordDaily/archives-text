Yesterda\ the I) a r r.. s ream let I the protest of a student against
a wholesale violation ol the Honor ( ode. With the papers hardly
off the press, another protect \y;r uttered against another and
equally flagrant violation. Ihi second protest came not from a
-indent, but from ;i professor.
Professor Pay son J. Treat, before returning examination papers
to his Far Past history class, said litis: "there are marks here
which have been stolen, ft is with bitterness in my mind that I
am returning the papers on Thursday a bitterness which comes
over me because I like to shoot straight with the students and I
expect the students to shoot straight with me."
Those who know Payson J. Treat know that such a statement
from him is not the unjustified suspicion of an unsympathetic fac
ulty mind.
And coming ns it does, on tlie heels of that other charge, Pro
fessor Treat's protest assumes unwonted importance. It should
inspire thought and action by those who lead.
Stanford has been known for her fair play in all lines. There
are no "creaking institutions" of honor or fairness on the green
turf or on the cinder path. < iood sportsmanship is the highest trib
ute paid to Stanford teams. Is this tradition to be followed in
athletics alone?
The Daily says again what il lias said before—ihe Honor Code
has not failed. Put it will fail, if this student lethargy continues.
Steps can be taken, and should be taken, by the student honor
committee, but the real responsibility lies not with any such ad
ministrative instrument. It lies in the rank and file of the Stan
ford roughs and the Kive Hundred; it lies in the Halls and on the
Pow. Without support from these quarters, honor committee meet
ings and editorials on honor will be so much pother.
