# SANE NOMINATING ESSENTIAL

With nominations for the mid-year A.S.S.I', and class elec- j
tions becoming numerous, a more judicious use of the unrestricted
nominating privileges v.lii<h are accorded members of I lie student;
body becomes necessary. While the Daii.s docs not question Ihe
right of anyone to name whom he pleases as a candidate for office,

a restricted group to put a candidate in office who is not satisfac- |
