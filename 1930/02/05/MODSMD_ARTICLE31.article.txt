"NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER,"
by Richard Halliburton. (Bobbs-
Merrill, 1929.) At The Alcove.
Richard Halliburton hus again
been at play and itt work pmduc
inf.*; romance and adventure, this
; time out of Latin America. "New
; Worlds to Conquer" carries the
| Tennessee wanderer through the
J New World from Mexico to Buenos
| Aires, absorbing local color as lie
goes, mixing it with intriguing epi-
I sodes of himself, setting it. down
on a background of history.
Our modern Conquistador re
j discovers San Salvador (by sea-
plane), follows Cortez through
Mexico, and sights the Pacific,
with Balboa, "silent, upon a peak
, in Uarien." He is known now —lam-
■ ous —and universal entre awaits
! him to Ed ens, palaces, arid halls.
Canal Zone's governor is howled
| over for a pass to swim the Istli
i mus, locks and all. In Peru lie wins
the President and American Am
bassador. And on all sides he
I charms government aviators, sol
diers, guards, secretaries, natives
—and children. That is not all
fame. Halliburton has nerve and
< imagination anil words, and lie
I must, have charm, He grinds a
| hurdy-gurdy, plays Robinson Cru-
I soe, spies on rhe unspeakable
| French Guiana prisons, falls in love
with Rio tie Janeiro. "When I die
I don'l want to go to heaven; I
i want to go back to Rio."
There are all sorts of travel
J books. Halliburton's have youth,
. high spots, and appeal. They are
I not thorough, scientific, nor exact.
: In this last his' adventures are be-
I coming a bit lens spontaneous and
: more commercial. The impudent,
' enthusiastic college youth of "Roy
al Road to Romance" has reaped
-and written much since those un-
I certain days of stealing worst-class
j rail accommodations on t lie Conli
! nerit. —F. T.

There is a tendency to speak of
! modern poetry as being merely
; "significant." The remark is mean
ingless, and tends to disregard
what many feel to be the most im
portant tiling America has ever
done for world art. Modern poetry
is new, for one thing, and still plas
tic. As yet. it. lias few definite
i standards. It is essentially Ameri
can and thoroughly democratic,
but is not, as Henry Louis Menck
j en said, a device to make poetry
easier to write and harder to read.
The crime it commits is much
simpler to state. Originality, it
affronts pedantic-ism, intellectual
apery. It is.the expression of a new
day, and if we would believe the
traditionists, an inferior one. There
have always been poor poets and
! good ones. Lola ilitlge is in many
| ways an excellent, one.
"Ponder a day as fair as this —
Transfigured now and changed
beyond redress —
Smelling of loam and horses
and soft airs
Atingle with an April eager
ness —
| How it was called to stand
there in God's way
In stubborn glory, like a golden
ass
Forefeet, planted against lime,
that shall not pass
With light-shod hoofs in dark
ness."
Those lines establish the au
thor's style and purpose. She writes
of those intimately or casually
connected with the day of Cruci
fixion. Through individual comment
of these eye-witnesses of Christ's
death, she reveals the extraordin
ary comprehension of the far-reach
ing effect of that demise of God.
Her style is arteried with fire of

i fancy. II glows with her imagina
tion.
Lola Ridge is an invalid. Much
| that her work in grows from that
fact. Her strong mind luis refused
to forbear adventure because of
sickness. On the other hand, her
imagination has developed. she
journeys with her mind. Her vo
cabulary is thai of a caged intel
lect. Her style is lense willi (lie
determination of spirited pent ups.
Her work is shot with the elec
tric fires of fierce emotions, which
are dammed up by enforced re
straint and released in Hoods of
poetry. Some indefinable (|ualityof
her work makes it seem strange
at first., Inn as one reads the power
of her expression grows in one's
consciousness, .lust as if was an
inner feeling that produced ihe
poem, il requires an' interna] re
ceptiveness to appreciate it.
"Py unused way and secret
lane
Il made its way up to iiis head
And whirled amid the pillared
frame
Of ivory, that could not spread
To give it:? pinions place."
—H. Pollard.
OH, SUSANNAH—At the Curran
Theatre, San . r ranciuco.
Good song numbers, atmosphere,
and novelty combine in "(Hi, Susan
nah" to make a show worth seeing.
Beginning Willi a colorful liesla
scene —enlivened by a. Spanish
dance of "considerable fervor, and
a: fight between live gamecocks l hat
is immensely diverting, the per
formance moves swiftly through
scenes that reveal the high tenor
of excitement ami danserous, yet
amusing adventure in which the
American and Sa.pn.hdi scllf is of
ihe Sacra-menlo valley once lived.
The succession of pulsing chor
uses and dance ensembles that is
the leading al tract ion of Ihe show
reaches one of its highest points
in a mining canjp scene just al the
close of lhe lirsl ad. I'.y a humor
ous fluke, a band ol miners find
themselves clutching handfuls of
real gold nuggets. There is a mo
ment of suspense, then the group
surges together and roars out a
song so full of the spirit of those
gold rush days of their courage
and brutality that eight curtain
calls hardly satisfy ihe audience.
The applause is justified; il is a
real thrill to' see these thirt.y-lwo
toughened, seamy-laced men move
forward almost to the edge of the
footlights and throw themselves
into Ihe splendid rhythm of the
"Gold" song with a feeling in voice
and gestures, that ds a great im
provement over the dapper per
formances given by the avenYg •
sleek-haired, trim-waisted male
chorines of musical romances.
The generous superiority of "Oh,
Susannah" over the ordinary run
of this type of shows is also ex
hibited in the leading actor, Wal
lace Mac Donald, who has in addi
tion to a fine voice, a rather charm
ing haughteur and an aristocratic
appearance that place him above
the familiar leading man of the
too-good-looking profile, and the
too-ingratiating personality.
Besides a talent, for singing,
Stella Seager, the Susannah of Ihe
play, has an ability to look alto
gether ravishing in creations of
lace and pale silk that, make her
presence on the stage much appre
ciated.
"Oh Susannah" is good, solid en
tertainment. 11, is no! spectacular,
and rises to no startling heights,
yet there are likewise no weak
parts to disappoint. —M. L. It.

There is a tendency to speak of
! modern poetry as being merely
; "significant." The remark is mean
ingless, and tends to disregard
what many feel to be the most im
portant tiling America has ever
done for world art. Modern poetry
is new, for one thing, and still plas
tic. As yet. it. lias few definite
i standards. It is essentially Ameri
can and thoroughly democratic,
but is not, as Henry Louis Menck
j en said, a device to make poetry
easier to write and harder to read.
The crime it commits is much
simpler to state. Originality, it
affronts pedantic-ism, intellectual
apery. It is.the expression of a new
day, and if we would believe the
traditionists, an inferior one. There
have always been poor poets and
! good ones. Lola ilitlge is in many
| ways an excellent, one.
"Ponder a day as fair as this —
Transfigured now and changed
beyond redress —
Smelling of loam and horses
and soft airs
Atingle with an April eager
ness —
| How it was called to stand
there in God's way
In stubborn glory, like a golden
ass
Forefeet, planted against lime,
that shall not pass
With light-shod hoofs in dark
ness."
Those lines establish the au
thor's style and purpose. She writes
of those intimately or casually
connected with the day of Cruci
fixion. Through individual comment
of these eye-witnesses of Christ's
death, she reveals the extraordin
ary comprehension of the far-reach
ing effect of that demise of God.
Her style is arteried with fire of

i fancy. II glows with her imagina
tion.
Lola Ridge is an invalid. Much
| that her work in grows from that
fact. Her strong mind luis refused
to forbear adventure because of
sickness. On the other hand, her
imagination has developed. she
journeys with her mind. Her vo
cabulary is thai of a caged intel
lect. Her style is lense willi (lie
determination of spirited pent ups.
Her work is shot with the elec
tric fires of fierce emotions, which
are dammed up by enforced re
straint and released in Hoods of
poetry. Some indefinable (|ualityof
her work makes it seem strange
at first., Inn as one reads the power
of her expression grows in one's
consciousness, .lust as if was an
inner feeling that produced ihe
poem, il requires an' interna] re
ceptiveness to appreciate it.
"Py unused way and secret
lane
Il made its way up to iiis head
And whirled amid the pillared
frame
Of ivory, that could not spread
To give it:? pinions place."
—H. Pollard.
OH, SUSANNAH—At the Curran
Theatre, San . r ranciuco.
Good song numbers, atmosphere,
and novelty combine in "(Hi, Susan
nah" to make a show worth seeing.
Beginning Willi a colorful liesla
scene —enlivened by a. Spanish
dance of "considerable fervor, and
a: fight between live gamecocks l hat
is immensely diverting, the per
formance moves swiftly through
scenes that reveal the high tenor
of excitement ami danserous, yet
amusing adventure in which the
American and Sa.pn.hdi scllf is of
ihe Sacra-menlo valley once lived.
The succession of pulsing chor
uses and dance ensembles that is
the leading al tract ion of Ihe show
reaches one of its highest points
in a mining canjp scene just al the
close of lhe lirsl ad. I'.y a humor
ous fluke, a band ol miners find
themselves clutching handfuls of
real gold nuggets. There is a mo
ment of suspense, then the group
surges together and roars out a
song so full of the spirit of those
gold rush days of their courage
and brutality that eight curtain
calls hardly satisfy ihe audience.
The applause is justified; il is a
real thrill to' see these thirt.y-lwo
toughened, seamy-laced men move
forward almost to the edge of the
footlights and throw themselves
into Ihe splendid rhythm of the
"Gold" song with a feeling in voice
and gestures, that ds a great im
provement over the dapper per
formances given by the avenYg •
sleek-haired, trim-waisted male
chorines of musical romances.
The generous superiority of "Oh,
Susannah" over the ordinary run
of this type of shows is also ex
hibited in the leading actor, Wal
lace Mac Donald, who has in addi
tion to a fine voice, a rather charm
ing haughteur and an aristocratic
appearance that place him above
the familiar leading man of the
too-good-looking profile, and the
too-ingratiating personality.
Besides a talent, for singing,
Stella Seager, the Susannah of Ihe
play, has an ability to look alto
gether ravishing in creations of
lace and pale silk that, make her
presence on the stage much appre
ciated.
"Oh Susannah" is good, solid en
tertainment. 11, is no! spectacular,
and rises to no startling heights,
yet there are likewise no weak
parts to disappoint. —M. L. It.

There is a tendency to speak of
! modern poetry as being merely
; "significant." The remark is mean
ingless, and tends to disregard
what many feel to be the most im
portant tiling America has ever
done for world art. Modern poetry
is new, for one thing, and still plas
tic. As yet. it. lias few definite
i standards. It is essentially Ameri
can and thoroughly democratic,
but is not, as Henry Louis Menck
j en said, a device to make poetry
easier to write and harder to read.
The crime it commits is much
simpler to state. Originality, it
affronts pedantic-ism, intellectual
apery. It is.the expression of a new
day, and if we would believe the
traditionists, an inferior one. There
have always been poor poets and
! good ones. Lola ilitlge is in many

"Ponder a day as fair as this —
Transfigured now and changed
beyond redress —
Smelling of loam and horses
and soft airs
Atingle with an April eager
ness —
| How it was called to stand
there in God's way
In stubborn glory, like a golden
ass
Forefeet, planted against lime,
that shall not pass
With light-shod hoofs in dark
ness."
Those lines establish the au
thor's style and purpose. She writes
of those intimately or casually
connected with the day of Cruci
fixion. Through individual comment
of these eye-witnesses of Christ's

The generous superiority of "Oh,

appearance that place him above
the familiar leading man of the
too-good-looking profile, and the
too-ingratiating personality.

"NEW WORLDS TO CONQUER,"
by Richard Halliburton. (Bobbs-
Merrill, 1929.) At The Alcove.
Richard Halliburton hus again
been at play and itt work pmduc
inf.*; romance and adventure, this
; time out of Latin America. "New
; Worlds to Conquer" carries the
| Tennessee wanderer through the
J New World from Mexico to Buenos
| Aires, absorbing local color as lie
goes, mixing it with intriguing epi-
I sodes of himself, setting it. down
on a background of history.
Our modern Conquistador re
j discovers San Salvador (by sea-
plane), follows Cortez through
Mexico, and sights the Pacific,
with Balboa, "silent, upon a peak
, in Uarien." He is known now —lam-
■ ous —and universal entre awaits
! him to Ed ens, palaces, arid halls.
Canal Zone's governor is howled
| over for a pass to swim the Istli
i mus, locks and all. In Peru lie wins
the President and American Am
bassador. And on all sides he
I charms government aviators, sol
diers, guards, secretaries, natives
—and children. That is not all
fame. Halliburton has nerve and
< imagination anil words, and lie
I must, have charm, He grinds a
| hurdy-gurdy, plays Robinson Cru-
I soe, spies on rhe unspeakable
| French Guiana prisons, falls in love
with Rio tie Janeiro. "When I die
I don'l want to go to heaven; I
i want to go back to Rio."
There are all sorts of travel
J books. Halliburton's have youth,
. high spots, and appeal. They are
I not thorough, scientific, nor exact.
: In this last his' adventures are be-
I coming a bit lens spontaneous and
: more commercial. The impudent,
' enthusiastic college youth of "Roy
al Road to Romance" has reaped
-and written much since those un-
I certain days of stealing worst-class
j rail accommodations on t lie Conli

1929. At Stanford Bookstore.
There is a tendency to speak of
! modern poetry as being merely
; "significant." The remark is mean
ingless, and tends to disregard
what many feel to be the most im
portant tiling America has ever
done for world art. Modern poetry
is new, for one thing, and still plas
tic. As yet. it. lias few definite
i standards. It is essentially Ameri
can and thoroughly democratic,
but is not, as Henry Louis Menck
j en said, a device to make poetry
easier to write and harder to read.
The crime it commits is much
simpler to state. Originality, it
affronts pedantic-ism, intellectual
apery. It is.the expression of a new
day, and if we would believe the
traditionists, an inferior one. There
have always been poor poets and
! good ones. Lola ilitlge is in many
| ways an excellent, one.
"Ponder a day as fair as this —
Transfigured now and changed
beyond redress —
Smelling of loam and horses
and soft airs
Atingle with an April eager
ness —
| How it was called to stand
there in God's way
In stubborn glory, like a golden
ass
Forefeet, planted against lime,
that shall not pass
With light-shod hoofs in dark
ness."
Those lines establish the au
thor's style and purpose. She writes
of those intimately or casually
connected with the day of Cruci
fixion. Through individual comment
of these eye-witnesses of Christ's
death, she reveals the extraordin
ary comprehension of the far-reach
ing effect of that demise of God.
Her style is arteried with fire of

i fancy. II glows with her imagina
tion.
Lola Ridge is an invalid. Much
| that her work in grows from that
fact. Her strong mind luis refused
to forbear adventure because of
sickness. On the other hand, her
imagination has developed. she
journeys with her mind. Her vo
cabulary is thai of a caged intel
lect. Her style is lense willi (lie
determination of spirited pent ups.
Her work is shot with the elec
tric fires of fierce emotions, which
are dammed up by enforced re
straint and released in Hoods of
poetry. Some indefinable (|ualityof
her work makes it seem strange
at first., Inn as one reads the power
of her expression grows in one's
consciousness, .lust as if was an
inner feeling that produced ihe
poem, il requires an' interna] re
ceptiveness to appreciate it.
"Py unused way and secret
lane
Il made its way up to iiis head
And whirled amid the pillared
frame
Of ivory, that could not spread
To give it:? pinions place."
—H. Pollard.
OH, SUSANNAH—At the Curran
Theatre, San . r ranciuco.
Good song numbers, atmosphere,
and novelty combine in "(Hi, Susan
nah" to make a show worth seeing.
Beginning Willi a colorful liesla
scene —enlivened by a. Spanish
dance of "considerable fervor, and
a: fight between live gamecocks l hat
is immensely diverting, the per
formance moves swiftly through
scenes that reveal the high tenor
of excitement ami danserous, yet
amusing adventure in which the
American and Sa.pn.hdi scllf is of
ihe Sacra-menlo valley once lived.
The succession of pulsing chor
uses and dance ensembles that is
the leading al tract ion of Ihe show
reaches one of its highest points
in a mining canjp scene just al the
close of lhe lirsl ad. I'.y a humor
ous fluke, a band ol miners find
themselves clutching handfuls of
real gold nuggets. There is a mo
ment of suspense, then the group
surges together and roars out a
song so full of the spirit of those
gold rush days of their courage
and brutality that eight curtain
calls hardly satisfy ihe audience.
The applause is justified; il is a
real thrill to' see these thirt.y-lwo
toughened, seamy-laced men move
forward almost to the edge of the
footlights and throw themselves
into Ihe splendid rhythm of the
"Gold" song with a feeling in voice
and gestures, that ds a great im
provement over the dapper per
