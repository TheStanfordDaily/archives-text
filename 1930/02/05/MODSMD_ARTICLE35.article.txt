There ha 4 : been a new road built
lon the Stanford campus which
'Opens up an old historical spot
: while serving a very modern and
up-to-date purpose. This road has
! not been named as yet. It runs
| from the Mayfield-Searsville road
to Mayfiejd avenue, passing
through Ihe center of the old Palo
j Alto Stock Kami. It also culs
i through the new golf course,
j The Palo Alto Stock Kami was
! Senator Stanford's pride and joy.
j Scientific bleeding and manage-;
1 ni«• 111 under his able direction
brought the trotting horse to its |
| highest perfection in California.'
I Eastern tracks also counted on j
j great days of friendly competition]
j when a shipment of Stanford- j
j owned, Palo Alto trained horses
j arrived for l lie races.
Famous Horses
The Kami was started in ISSO
j and discontinued in l!Mi!{. It gradu-,
j all> disintegrated after Senator j
| Stanford's death in The great- i
| est hoi" e bred there was Azote,
i who set a record of 2:H4% which |
stood until I!) 24.
Go out ihe Mayfield-Searsville j
road pasl Governor's Avenue and I
ion until you come to a road turn
ing off to the left". (The Mayfield
! Searsviile road, as you probably i
I do not know, is the one that starts
■out near the Physics'corner of the
{Quad and goes along in back of
: Sequoia Hall.) Take the road turn
ing lo the I«f |, which as yet has!
! no name, and you will soon come |
I lo Ihe old Stock Kami.
An old fed hariron the •left, and J
! a long, low building on the right, ;
together with several fenced-in i
'paddocks, remain to I• -11 of former,
j glory. On down the road, where it j
joins with Mayficrd AVende, is a I
| house occupied al one lime by the
superintendent of the - Palo Alio
I Stock Kami. One of the ground I
lenders for the new golf course!
lives in il now.
Statue Still Stands
The greatest memorial left is Ihe
statue of the horse "Electioneer"
which has been erected as a. last- i
ing tribute lo the horses who made ;
history on liie race track and car
ried the name of the Palo Alto
Stock Kami to a high pinnacle of
fame.
In 1891 the Farm rose to its
greatest pitch with Arion, best. I
among two-year-olds, Sunol among
five-year-olds, and with Palo Alto j
having the best record for stal- !
lions.
While you are out at. the Karm, j
assuming that you fire interested:
enough in Stanford history to go, 1
read the placque commemorating
the research conducted in 1878 and j
I87!» under the direction of Sena
tor Stanford which proved to be
the forerunner of the motion pic
ture.
Walk or Ride
There are several ways of visit- >
ing Ibis historic and interesting i
spot. One of the best is mentioned I
above. One or a party of six or
more can walk out. The total time ;
elapsed will range from thirty mini
utes to an hour. One who is driving
can go up Lasuen to Mayfield Ave
nue, out Mayfield past Lagunita and
ihe Lathrop home, on under the I
golf foot bridge and on to the first
road which turns to the right. If
will lead you back to the statue
and the placque.
The Karm is not. entirely desert
et. There are a few head of the |
Lansburgh horses in the barn,
though the majority of litem will |
be away on exhibition for Ihe next ;
i two months.
