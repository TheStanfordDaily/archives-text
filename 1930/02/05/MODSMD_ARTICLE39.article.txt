worn-out jokes up in this neck ol
the woods is about the invasion 01
Los Angles hy tin* Middle Wesl
l';i rinera.
It is said that these tillers of
the soil come out to the Coast
to make whoopee and spend
their last days basking in the
sunshine, after trudging
through a life of hard knocks
among the dreary plains and
the bandit-infested battlefields
up and down the Mississippi.
Which is not only ;i historical
faux pas, hut an unscholarly and
unconscious fallacy in athletic an
nals as well.
For it is to be noted that
among the recsnt emigrants
from lowa and way stations
are several of the outstanding
up-and-coming coaches in the
land.
Meaning, of course, such per
sons as Mesers, Sain Marrv and
Jimmy IMielan.
Not only are these gentlemen
unversed in the ways and
means of handling the plough,
but they are also not coming
out to the Pacific Slope to sit
around on their haunches in the
sunlight. And their whoopee
niaking is quite uncertain.
Mr. Chelan was enticed away
from I'urdue to become chief di
rector „of football activities up al
Washington L r . at the close of last
fall's Krid campaign hy an offer in
the form of a big, fat. salary.
His record at the Boiler
maker school was up to snuff,
to say the least, and only last
season his gridiron team man
aged to come out on top in the
Birj Ten title scramble.
Washington officials expect him
to continue his winning ways.
Enoch Dagshaw, it must he remem
bered, did nol gel the bounce out
of unadnllerated malice, hul be
cause his Husky stalwarts had ac
quired a most annoying habit of
playing second fiddle in Cons! col
lege pigskin competition.
The other hero of this blurb
column, Mr. Sam Barry, has
already made a mark for him
self. Shaking the agrarian dust
of lowa off his clothes for the
first time this winter, Mr.
Barry has led a supposedly
weak Trojan basketb;dl five
out of the P.C.C. cellar wilder
ness. In fact, U.S.C. is now in
the driver's seat at the top of
the Conference rankings.
Whether Messers. Phelan and
Harry really make good in a big
way remains to be seen. Lint their
injection into Pacific Coast sport
ing circles has marked the begin
ning of a new era -one in which
coaches - must either produce or
join the vast horde of job hunters.
And it won't be long now,
according to no few athletic
dopesters, before other coaches
of well-known higher institu
tions go the way of Bagshaw,
et al.
For the tuition payers at these
colleges are* getting mighty sick
and tired of having excellent pros
pects so mishandled that they ac
tually perform.at. times like unin
structed chumps.
Not, that these tuition payers
can't stand to see their alma mater
go down to defeat now and then.
Jin t when the same condition goes
on year after year and with no re
lief hi sight well, that is a differ
ent matter.
Already the rumblings and
mumblings of discontent are
swelling in certain directions.
A storm of disapproval will
break, no doubt, unless these
coaches heed the fact that they
are no longer wanted and gra
ciously step down from the
high pedestals on their own ac
cord. —Stephen Dietrich.
