## Home Life Is Primary Job, Speaker States 
### 
"Woman is woman, anil her activity
j in any branch of public work must
| not rule out the primary job desig
j natcd for her by nature, that of the
J home,'' concluded Mrs. Margaret
Spring-Rice, British feminist leader,
: in her lecture last night on "English
; Women in Public and Private Lite."
j "That they are just women and not
i imitation men is the attitude gaining
increasing popularity among women
j interested in feminist movements. The
! large majority of women desire pri-
I marily marriage and family life. I hey
' should introduce a higher, more effi
i cient standard into this, their most
j common job, as a solution of the de
: sire for activity.
"The fields of professional and bus-
I iness activities should be kept open tor
| the unmarried woman. It is true that
■ women do not devote as much of their
energy after marriage to a profession
! as do men, and for this reason they are
| generally less valuable to the field
I which they enter," said Mrs. Spring
i Rice in commenting upon the fact that
'London medical schools have been
{closed to women students.
| "The emancipation struggle of wotn
j en in America has been less bitter than
jin England, probably because much
■ of the prejudice on the matter in Eng
j land was left behind in the pioneering
! spirit of America. Witchcraft was
j very likely an outlet for feminine gen
-1 ius in earlier times. Much of the great
j English literature signed 'Anon' must
I have been the work of women.
"The Industrial Revolution in Eng
' land and the French Revolution
I brought about the awakening of the
i feminist movement in England. The
I Industrial Revolution took away wom
j an's former household duties, and she
I consequently sought other ways of
self-expression."
Mrs. Spring-Rice's review of the
| women in English public life included
mention of prominent British women
] who pioneered the movement, and very
I interesting accounts of women in the
j educational institutions. < hitstanding
[in the lecture was her description of
| life at Ciirton College, connected with
j Cambridge University, of which she
! is a graduate.
