# GENTLEMEN, THE KING ...
## Robert King, '29, One of the "Good Old Reliables" of hast Year's American Olympic Games Team 
### Feg Murray, '16 
"Good old reliable Bob"* King is
going to try for a new world's in
door record al I lie Millrose games
to be held in Madison Square (Jar
den, New York, the night of Feb
ruary 8. That is good news for
many reasons, for this lad is not
only one of the greatest of all high
jumpers, but one of the best sports
men and most-likable chaps in any
branch of athletics. Bob's sunny
disposition, contagious smile, and
wonderful jumping ability have
made him a favorite wherever he
has competed. If he goes over the
bar he grins; if he knocks the
cross-piece off he grins all the
harder; and it isn't long before all
the spectators who are watching
the jumpers are pulling for King,
heart and soul.
If the United States Olympic
team at Amsterdam had had more
performers like Bob King, Sabin
Garr, Ed Hamm, and Ray Barbuti,
the athletes wearing the red, white,
and blue would not. have been de
feated in so many events. They
belong to that select class of "good

old reliables" who always come
through. As an example of Bob
King's consistency, let me remind
you that in 1!>28, after easily prov
ing himself the best high jumper
on the Pacific Coast, he came iDast,
representing Stanford University,
to win the 1.C.4-A. title, the New
York A.C. championship, the Na
tional Collegiate title, the final
Olympic tryouts (and National
championships) and Olympic cham
pions.
Bob has cleared better than 6
feet, 0 inches several times, and
on the new standards adopted by
the A.A.r. and 1.C.4-A, in 11»27. too,
not on the old style standards with
which those jumpers using the
"Western roll" could lie on the
bar, forcing it down several inches
without knocking it off. Please no
tice that Harold Osborn, the
world's record holder, has been
just another high jumper since that
change went into effect. King's 6
feet 0 5-8 made at. the N.C.A. meet
in 1928, is easily one of the great
est high jumping efforts made in
any land or at any time.

Olympic tryouts (and National
championships) and Olympic cham
pions.
Bob has cleared better than 6
feet, 0 inches several times, and
on the new standards adopted by
the A.A.r. and 1.C.4-A, in 11»27. too,
not on the old style standards with
which those jumpers using the
"Western roll" could lie on the
bar, forcing it down several inches
without knocking it off. Please no
tice that Harold Osborn, the
world's record holder, has been
just another high jumper since that
change went into effect. King's 6
feet 0 5-8 made at. the N.C.A. meet
in 1928, is easily one of the great
est high jumping efforts made in
any land or at any time.

"Good old reliable Bob"* King is
going to try for a new world's in
door record al I lie Millrose games
to be held in Madison Square (Jar
den, New York, the night of Feb
ruary 8. That is good news for
many reasons, for this lad is not
only one of the greatest of all high
jumpers, but one of the best sports
men and most-likable chaps in any
branch of athletics. Bob's sunny
disposition, contagious smile, and
wonderful jumping ability have
made him a favorite wherever he
has competed. If he goes over the
bar he grins; if he knocks the
cross-piece off he grins all the
harder; and it isn't long before all
the spectators who are watching
the jumpers are pulling for King,
heart and soul.
If the United States Olympic
team at Amsterdam had had more
performers like Bob King, Sabin
Garr, Ed Hamm, and Ray Barbuti,
the athletes wearing the red, white,
and blue would not. have been de
feated in so many events. They
belong to that select class of "good

old reliables" who always come
through. As an example of Bob
King's consistency, let me remind
you that in 1!>28, after easily prov
ing himself the best high jumper
on the Pacific Coast, he came iDast,
representing Stanford University,
to win the 1.C.4-A. title, the New
York A.C. championship, the Na
tional Collegiate title, the final
Olympic tryouts (and National
championships) and Olympic cham
pions.
