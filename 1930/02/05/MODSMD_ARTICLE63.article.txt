## 
### BY FRITZ GOODWIN 
"investigate and then invest" is
the advice of Professor J. 15. Sears
of the Stanford School of Educa
tion on the school bond issue con
fronting Palo Alto at present, as
expressed at a public meeting in
the high school auditorium Monday
night and in an interview for the
Daily yesterday.
"We of 4 h«• Palo Alto dist.r4ct,
which includes the school on the
Stanford campus, need more
schools. To get them we must go
in debt, and I find no fault witi
the bond financial plan offered by
the school board," said Professor
Sears when interviewed. "Before
carrying out any building program,
however, we should investigate the
definite needs of our school system
and then go ahead with a clear
. knowledge of the necessary im
-1 provements and the cost involved."
In his address Monday evening
! Professor Sears spoke at the l'e-
I quest of the Palo Alto P.T.A. on
' the subject of "The School Survey:

112 What It Is and What It Would
Mean to Palo Alio." The Stanford
expert of school survey work spoke
fearlessly on the subject, criticiz
ing (lie school board's policy of
presenting the issue and not the
bond itself, and advocating a com
plete school survey for tlie district.
Professor Sears expresses t lie
hope that the petty arguments
'brought into tins controversy will
be dropped and Hie real issues
faced as a result of Monday night's
meeting. He has been in close con
tact with the problem of school
bonds in Palo Alto, both through
his position as an authority on
school surveys in general, and in
the capacity of adviser to a com
mittee of citizens appointed by the
city government to investigate the
,* matter.
