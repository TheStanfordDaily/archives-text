Under the conditions of quiet and

I work, measurements are made of basic
| metabolism, blood pressure, vital ca
j pacity, and the biochemical condition
i of the body fluids. These factors will
j be studied in connection with scores on
i tests of general physical fitness. The

1 for some weeks, will continue through
