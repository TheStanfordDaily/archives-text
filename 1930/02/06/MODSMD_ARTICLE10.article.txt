# CONTINENTAL SPLIT THEORY EXAMINED BY BAILEY WILLIS
## 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis. Professor Kmeri
tus of the Department of Geology, is
in London after a 7,000-mile trip
through Africa in an effort to formu
late his own theory as to whether
there was a great continental split run
ning from Abyssinia to the Jordan
River.
An article in the current issue of
I "Time" credits the 72-year-old geolo-
I gist with having walked 500 miles of
! the trip, "nicking rocks, sampling
j gravels, and speculating <>11 the waters
j of the great lake and big game coun
i tr > -"
Most of the work for which Dr.
j Willis is noted lies in the field of
I structural geology, particularly with
reference to the mechanics of thrust
faults and earthquakes. When Willis
predicted another earthquake for
Southern C alifornia in 192K, the Los
Angeles Graphic, excited by a rival
geologist, assailed the prediction as
j "the incondite ravings of a niischief
j maker .... God must have tipped him
j off."
I Willis went on the emeritus list in
! 1922, after having served for seven
I years. It was then that Dr. Kliot
| lUackvvelder, present head of the de
partment, came from the University
I of Illinois to begin hi> work at Stan-
I ford.
