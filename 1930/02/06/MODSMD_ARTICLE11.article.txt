### 
Judge Frank Kerrigan, federal
judge of the northern district of
California, last night addressed the
members of Delta Tlicta Phi, legal
I fraternity, on "Procedure in Fed
i oral Courts." He discussed import
ant technical details.
Judge Kerrigan touched also on
| the crowded conditions in federal
; courts which seriously hamper pro
hibition enforcement. He declared,
J however, that the policy of federal
courts of not arlmilting evidence
; illegally obtained was a very de
j sirable stand. This position is not
J taken by state courts.
