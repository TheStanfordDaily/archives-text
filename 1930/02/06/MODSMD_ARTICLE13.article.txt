I 18th century Italy, chosen to har
! monize with the sets, will be seen
j tomorrow night in Harold Helven
j ston's production of Carlo Goldoni's
I comedy, "The Mistress of the Inn."
! Most gaudy perhaps, and cer
| tainly very much in character, are
; the costumes to lie worn by Phoebe
Plate and Catherine Musante in the
i parts of Ortensia and Djaneira, two
raucous actresses who come to the
I inn decked out in the loudest, most
I "elegant" clothes they could find
jin the theatre wardrobe. Ortensia
' is a symphony in green and yellow
j with many feathers, ruffles, and
1 furs protruding at various points.
J Her fellow-comedienne, Djaneira,
1 appears in a blue-and-orange outfit
with jacket, feathers, and shoes to

Ruth Beede, as Mirandolina, tli"
' mistress of the inn, appears in the
'first few scenes in a costume very
j similar lo that worn by Eva Le
; Gallienne, in her production of Ibis
I play at the New York Civic lleper
; tory Theatre in 15)2(5. A jaunty lace
| cap and an Italian apron give her
1 the proper look for "locandiera," or
i mistress of an inn.
The men of the cast, being of
j various ranks, display great diver
; sity in their costumes. Most ele-
I gant is that of the Cavalier of
j Ripafratta, to be played by Vallejo
! Gantner. Black moir6 silk and
i braid trimmings characterize his
I costume, while Arthur Hurt, in the
| part of the Marquis of Forlipopoli,
• wears royal purple—significant,
' perhaps, of the fact that all he has
| to offer the mistress is rank, un
! soiled by lucre.
Edward Field, as the affluent
! Count of Albafiorita, blazes forth
in rich gold-embroidered velvet of
; burnt orange with the proper airs;
: while Jack McDowell, in the part
of the Italian servant, Fabrizio,

nicu, coionui costumes 01 eariy
I 18th century Italy, chosen to har
! monize with the sets, will be seen
j tomorrow night in Harold Helven
j ston's production of Carlo Goldoni's
I comedy, "The Mistress of the Inn."
! Most gaudy perhaps, and cer
| tainly very much in character, are
; the costumes to lie worn by Phoebe
Plate and Catherine Musante in the
i parts of Ortensia and Djaneira, two
raucous actresses who come to the
I inn decked out in the loudest, most
I "elegant" clothes they could find
jin the theatre wardrobe. Ortensia
' is a symphony in green and yellow
j with many feathers, ruffles, and
1 furs protruding at various points.
J Her fellow-comedienne, Djaneira,
1 appears in a blue-and-orange outfit
with jacket, feathers, and shoes to
! match.
Copies Le Gallienne
Ruth Beede, as Mirandolina, tli"
' mistress of the inn, appears in the
'first few scenes in a costume very
j similar lo that worn by Eva Le
; Gallienne, in her production of Ibis
I play at the New York Civic lleper
; tory Theatre in 15)2(5. A jaunty lace
| cap and an Italian apron give her
1 the proper look for "locandiera," or
i mistress of an inn.
The men of the cast, being of
j various ranks, display great diver
; sity in their costumes. Most ele-
I gant is that of the Cavalier of
j Ripafratta, to be played by Vallejo
! Gantner. Black moir6 silk and
i braid trimmings characterize his
I costume, while Arthur Hurt, in the
| part of the Marquis of Forlipopoli,
• wears royal purple—significant,
' perhaps, of the fact that all he has
| to offer the mistress is rank, un
! soiled by lucre.
Edward Field, as the affluent
! Count of Albafiorita, blazes forth
in rich gold-embroidered velvet of
; burnt orange with the proper airs;
: while Jack McDowell, in the part
of the Italian servant, Fabrizio,
: buzzes in and out in green trou
| sers, gray vest, and a long white
apron.
