### Theodore DeMotte BY THEODORE DE MOTTE 
"If is put ting it mildly to say
llial I believe in extracurricular
activities." Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
head of the Physical Education de
partment, was explaining his stand
j oil the value of athletics in the life
of the college student.
"I mean, however, the sort that
I supply recreation and are gov
erned by the spirit of play and fine
J sportsmanship. One has not learned
I how to live until he has learned
j how to combine work and play. 111
I the absence of one or the other,
i living is incomplete and inade
! quate; a balanced life is made of
I appropriate proportions of each.
"A college is concerned with
I helping youth prepare itself for
l better living and for leadership in
i the improvement of the living of
! others. A college experience that
| leaves play out fails as a prepara
tion for balanced living. Such deti
' cient experiences imperil mental
I and social health.
Fine Equipment
"Stanford made place for play
when the University calculatingly
decreed that the curricular day
shall begin at 8:1 ft in the morning
and that at 4:10 in the afternoon,

classroom and laboratories shall
yield to extracurricular recreations,
sports and athletics. The Univer
sity, through its Board ot Athletic
Control, is making rich provision
for these activities. On any late
normal afternoon during the week,
one will llnd the Stanford student
body at play on the tennis courts,
in the gymnasium, on the golf
course, in the swimming pools, on
the track and field, baseball dia
monds, basketball courts, handball
courts, football fields, in the appa
ratus room, boxing gallery, fencing
room, punching bag arcade, golf
cages, or, in season, canoeing and
swimming in Lagunita.
"Spectators are few. Players and
participants are many. There is a
place for everybody the lame and
the blind as well as super athlete.
Physical recreations, games, sports,
and athletics attract a great ma
jority of Stanford students.
Develops Leaders
"These extracurricular activities
contribute powerfully to the self
training of our men and women.
They hi lp them form habits of out
door life, make use of sunshine
dark places of our campus life."
