\* the first, official action in connection with recent violations of
the 1 lonor Code, it is projjosed that the present system he modified
to the extent of instituting a plan whereby proctors may he called in
to guard against cheating.
Regarding this project the report of the Honor Code Committee
to the Executive Committee says in part: "'1 he .1 lonor Code will be
kept as it is. but proctors will be optional during any examination at
the desire of any student or the instructor."
The action taken by the 1 lonor Code Committee in drafting the
resolution and the action of the Executive Committee in considering
it are indic;ytiye of a healthy interest in the present situation.
But is the proctor system—even though optional—a wise altera
tion of the present plan?
Can a system of proctors and a system of honor be reconciled ?
Will not proctors under this plan, or any other plan, constitute
a police system in disguise?
It is argued that the honor system would he maintained where
proctors are obviously not needed. Surely an honor system which
operated under such conditions would be a hollow thing.
The Daily believes that an "1 lonor" Code under which proctors
were used would he an Honor Code in name only. It all simmers
down to this —does Stanford want an Honor Code or does it want
proctors? Certainly the two can't go together.
