# SEX EQUALITY AND CO-EDUCATION
## 
### 
Paradoxical'as il may seem, Mrs. Margaret Spring-Rice, erst
while 1 iritisii leader of the feminist movement which has been en
gaged in decades .of struggle for women's ]>olitical and economic
equality, declared last Tuesday night that women's true vocation was
in the home, .Femininity not feminism was the text of her message.
This thought has been the ancient prejudice, the mental barrier
which the British feminists have been trying to hurdle for quite
some years now. and success has unowned their efforts to the extent
that all fields except the Foreign Office and the Church have been
opened to the fairer sex. Evidently the crown of sex equality does
not rest easily on the head of British feminism, as Mrs. Spring-Rice
considers the attitude that regards marriage as traitorous to the
women's cause—"nonsense."
Perhaps the true answer to the paradoxical stand that this one
section of British feminism has taken lies in the fact that the wrong
prejudice has been removed. Instead of public offices, what liritish
women need is education; instead of feminism, perhaps some sound
intellectual and emotional training would stand more in line with
Burns' version of femininity—"a woman's a woman for a' that."
Co-education is representative of the western world, and while it
may have its opponents, there is no reason why women should not
be given the benefits of modern knowledge in order that they may
use it in the home. The real answer to the British question lies in
eliminating the attitude which once prompted an ()xford under
graduate to say, "()h ves, there are women here, but no one ever sees
them."
