# ORIGINALITY IN STREET FIGHTS
## 
### 
Street fights, however repulsive to cultured people, never fail to
draw large crowds of onlookers. For months there has been a daily
fight in the streets of San Francisco, a fight which draws a crowd
of considerably over 100,000; but out of the large number of spec
tators, few are aware of the battle.
Xew York' saw such daily hostilities just before the turn of the
century and Denver, more recently, witnessed similar skirmishes.
In fact every large city is the scene of encounters which differ only
in intensity, lint it is only rarely that the public becomes conscious
of these battles.
Educated people almost never become interested in the daily
brawls, for most of the lighters are noisy, blatant clowns struggling
for popular favor and the evidences of favor in the form of .Ameri
can dollars. Strangely enough, however, the San Francisco street
fight is of interest to cultured people. It is of interest to those who
are desirous of obtaining unbiased! accurate information.
The fight is between the San Francisco Daily Xeii's and Hearst's
Call-Bulletin, journalistic jousters in the afternoon newspaper field.
The struggle on tlx- city's pavements is for circulation and for the
rewards of advertising which accompany it. In this respect the
battle is little different from that between I learst's New York Jour
nal'and Pulitzer's World which rocked the journalistic world in the
last five years of the past century. But the rules and the scoring have
changed. The San Francisco papers will not fight under the rules
of sensationalism, but under those of decency and accuracy.
The AYa'.s 1 has issued the challenge and thereby has the advan
tage of lighting in the home ring. It has also taken the first round
by forcing the consolidation of the Call and the Bulletin and com
pelling the opponents to abandon "yellow" paper. The second round
is now on and it will he interesting to see if Hearst, who outdid
Pulitzer in sensationalism, can outdo the News in decency. The
people of the Bay region are the judges and their reward will be
better journalism in the metropolitan area.
