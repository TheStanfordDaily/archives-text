j Gardens of This World is an ae
i count of the leisurely travels of
|I wo elderly French noblemen
| through southern Europe. There is
no sudden or exciting action in the
j book; it is completely in tone with
| the scenes and persons repre
isented.
It is obvious Ihiit the author is
in sympathy with the quiet, and
urbane attitude of his heroes, and
that he loves the historic lands
through which they-travel. One
l'eels, indeed, that everything has
been viewed with a sort of kindly
tolerance.
The book could not, and was not
intended to be a well-constructed
novel in plot. Its purpose seems to
be the presentation of an attitude,
of characters and their conflicts,
and descriptions of places which
the author thought beautiful. This
has resulted in a pleasing book.

GARDENS OF THIS WORLD. By
Henry B. Fuller. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. 1929.
j Gardens of This World is an ae
i count of the leisurely travels of
|I wo elderly French noblemen
| through southern Europe. There is
no sudden or exciting action in the
j book; it is completely in tone with
| the scenes and persons repre
isented.
It is obvious Ihiit the author is
in sympathy with the quiet, and
urbane attitude of his heroes, and
that he loves the historic lands
through which they-travel. One
l'eels, indeed, that everything has
been viewed with a sort of kindly
tolerance.
The book could not, and was not
intended to be a well-constructed
novel in plot. Its purpose seems to
be the presentation of an attitude,
of characters and their conflicts,
and descriptions of places which
the author thought beautiful. This
has resulted in a pleasing book.
