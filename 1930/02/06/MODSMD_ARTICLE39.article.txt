"It is interesting to note that both
i Rubio, president of Mexico, and Pres
ident Iloover of the United States
J are engineers. Both are trained, prac
tical, professional men, not the <>!d
I type of politician, either Mexican or
| American."
! Commenting on the recent election
land inauguration yesterday of Presi-
S dent Ortiz Rubio of Mexico, Pro
j fessor Charles \V. Hackett of the
i History department made the above
' remark to a Daily reporter yesterday.
Other similarities between the elec
tions of the two presidents were
drawn by Professor Hackett. Both
ran as candidate of the party in pow
er;.both ran on a platform of niain
| tabling the existing governmental
I program. Both Hoover and Rubio
i were opposed by more aggressive ad
i versaries, and each won by a very
i large majority.
"Jt was inevitable that, as long as
i the government lasted, Rubio would
]be elected. The election itself was
; merely the rubber stamp of govern
j mental approval," declared Hackett.

) There is an axiom in Mexican poli
tics that "The choice of the govern
meut in Mexico always wins," hut,
I according to Hackett, "It is also true
| that no Mexican government â€¢ would
j in . itself survive, much less perpetu
! ate itself, unless it were responsive to
I the will of the militant Revolution
j aries." The "Revolutionaries" rc
; ferred to are the members of the Na
! tional Revolutionary Party, the con
trolling party in Mexico.
Ya'sconcelos, the opposition candi
date, was a member of the original
I revolutionary group which ended the
long reign, of-Diaz in 1910, Professor
! Hackctt said, lie and Rubin really
belonged to different factions of the
| same .party, as Rubio was also a mem
j ber of that group.
Sketching the' high points of the
i new president's career, llackett sakl,
| that he has been Mexican ambassador
'to Brazil, fought with Obregon, Ca-
I lies, and Madero against Diaz, prac
ticed engineering successfully, and
held the post of secretary of the in
terior under the retiring president,
