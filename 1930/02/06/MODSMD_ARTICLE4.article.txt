# LOSS OF COUNTY SEAT CONTESTED BY MINING TOWN
## 
### 
I'.ISBKK, Ariz.. I'Yli. 5 </P>.—
The ghost of Tombstone, boom
town of Arizona's dead past,
walked today in a filial effort to
forestall encroachments of its
more youthful and vigorous
neighbors.
Porter McDonald, pioneer res
ident of the now dusty and
moth-eaten city which was once
the mining capital of the South
west, filed suit in superior court
here attacking the constitution
ality of moving of the Cochise
county seat — Tombstone's last
heritage— to Bisbce. The Co
chise electorate voted for the
move last November.
