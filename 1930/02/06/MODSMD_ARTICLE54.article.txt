# Carnera Is Battling Giant, Thinks Feg, But He'll Have To Meet Tougher Opposition Than Peterson

Now- that. Primo (Primare, Pri- i
mavi, Primatus) Camera, the Car- |
niverous Corytliosaurus, or "Storm
King of de Halps" has came, lias
saw, and has conquered (to the
tune of $257 per second) in his |
first American appearance, it re- j
mains to match him with a more I
i worthy foe than "Big Boy" Peter- j
son to find out whether or not the j
, big goof can really fight. After 70 i
i seconds of riotous brawling, in
• which Peterson bounced up and
down from the canvas like a rub
ber ball, it was decided by those j
| who saw the performance that the ,
i newest heavyweight sensation: (1) !
was very fast and agile for one so
( large; (2) had plenty of color; (3)
I had met about as much opposition
;in Peterson as he would in a
| midget.
"Big Boy" Peterson, it developed,
was not only a set-up, he was a
push-over of the rankest type, and
Primo actually pushed him over

once, shoving him to the canvas
with one of his massive paws like
a St. Bernard dog warding off an
overly piayful puppy. "Poosfi-'Em-
Up" Tony I hey call Lazzeri, the
Italian outfielder who plays second
base for the Yankees. "Poosh'Em-
Dowri" is my suggestion for a name
for this Walloping Wop, unless you
want to go in for prehistoric ani
mals and tag him "Battling Bron
tosaurus, the Thunder Reptile,"
"Carniverous Camera, the Tricky
Triceratops," "The Gorgosaurus of
Genoa," or "The Tyrannosaurus of
the Tiber." (The last two sugges
tions are especially appropriate as
the monster comes from Venice.)
Wotta man this spaghetti-inhaler
is! He eats enough for three aver
age mortals (according to his press
agent) and stows away chickens,
sides of beef, and fish like Gargan
tua himself. I suppose, after dust
ing off the dessert course, he swal
lows "Kid Chocolate" by mistake,
thinking him a bite of candy.

I had met about as much opposition
;in Peterson as he would in a
| midget.
"Big Boy" Peterson, it developed,
was not only a set-up, he was a
push-over of the rankest type, and
Primo actually pushed him over

once, shoving him to the canvas
with one of his massive paws like
a St. Bernard dog warding off an
overly piayful puppy. "Poosfi-'Em-
Up" Tony I hey call Lazzeri, the
Italian outfielder who plays second
base for the Yankees. "Poosh'Em-
Dowri" is my suggestion for a name
for this Walloping Wop, unless you
want to go in for prehistoric ani
mals and tag him "Battling Bron
tosaurus, the Thunder Reptile,"
"Carniverous Camera, the Tricky
Triceratops," "The Gorgosaurus of
Genoa," or "The Tyrannosaurus of
the Tiber." (The last two sugges
tions are especially appropriate as
the monster comes from Venice.)
Wotta man this spaghetti-inhaler
is! He eats enough for three aver
age mortals (according to his press
agent) and stows away chickens,
sides of beef, and fish like Gargan
tua himself. I suppose, after dust
ing off the dessert course, he swal
lows "Kid Chocolate" by mistake,
thinking him a bite of candy.
