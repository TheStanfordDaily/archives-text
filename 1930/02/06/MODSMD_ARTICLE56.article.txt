# VARSITY TOSSERS WIN MATCH FROM SEMI-PROS, 1010 2
## Taylor Fans One, Gives Six Hits in His First Full Contest 
### 
j Pitching his first full nine-inning
I game, Perry Taylor was in fine
i form yesterday and turned in a
creditable exhibition of pre-season
twirling; against the Lee's Haber
: dashery nine, the Card ball-tossers
; winning handily, 10-2. Taylor
fanned one and walked three and
1 hil three others, but tightened in
| the pinches and allowed only six
J scattered hits, most of which were
| flukes in tlie infield.
The semi-pro aggregation of
ringers were good players, but the
Redshirts bunched their hits and
were aided with a couple of costly
errors and eight walks. Among the
haberdashery players were Betten-
I.court and Kress, big-timers now
playing with the St. Louis Browns.
All sorts of uniforms were seen on
the field, ranging from the Seattle
Indians and the Oakland Oaks to
Michigan and Notre Dame and the
S.P., Imperial Soda, and C. and L.
Tires.
Stanford pushed over the win
i ning- tallies in tlie first inning when
Churchill walked, Johnson singled,
and Laird walked, to fill the bags.
Wright walked to force in Church
ill, Johnson scored on an error,
and Laird tallied on a sacrifice fly.
They added another in tlie fifth
and three apiece in the sixth and
eighth for good measure by pretty
much the same methods. Laird
knocked a double in both the sixth
and eighth which brought in five
runs between the two.
