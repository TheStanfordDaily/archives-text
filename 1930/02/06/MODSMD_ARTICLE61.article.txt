# 'DINK' TO RUN HIS ENURE SQUAD IN MEET TOMORROW
## Expect Close Competition As Team Is Rounding Into Top Form 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon, Coach Dink
Templeton will run his track squad
through the first regular Friday
j meet of the season. All classes com
pete, both varsity and freshmen,
and judging by the times and dis-
I tances made in the intramural
meet recently, the results tomor
row should approximate mid-sea
j son performances.
Tuesday evening, Hec Dyer ran
a 352-yard dash in 38 2-5 seconds,
which is very fast time for the odd
i distance. In the 100-yard dash,
I however, he was nosed out by
| Jimmy Howell, who is a vastly im
-1 proved runner this year. The time
j was a shade more than 10 seconds.
If Harlow Rothert lias time to
compete in the shot Friday, some
keen competition may be expected,
for the big basketball captain
j tossed the weight an even fifty
i feet in a workout Tuesday morn
: ing. Krenz has- already bettered
j fifty feet.
In the 880 and mile race, good
times should result, with Cooper
and Atkinson in the former and
' Wright and Parker in the latter.
Red Berry may be expected to pole
! vault around 12 feet G.
