## 
### 
FRF.SNO, Feb. () (/P).— Power to
turn the oil industry topsy-turvy rests
in the hands ot landowners of Kettlc
j man Hills. Farseeing oil men, agrcc-
I ing with Secretary of the Interior
' Wilbur that a few more producing
wells would "drown the gasoline mar
ket," are watching anxiously the prog
-1 rcss o1 parleys looking to orderly de
velopment of the vast field of newly
| discovered resources.
There are thirty wells, either drilled
or drilling, that could within a short
j time pour forth a stream of gasoline
that might shut down every other field
iin California. This astounding fact
is made true hy the nature of the oil
—which comes from the ground 95 per
1 cent gasoline.
Four of these wells are already pro
< dueing. Their total output is 1.3.3U0
barrels of oil daily. Gasoline from
these four wells would run more than
one-third of the state's gasoline scrv
t ice stations.
