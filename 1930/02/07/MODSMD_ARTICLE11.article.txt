# HOOVER PROPOSES TO SHIFT LIQUOR ENFORCEMENT UNIT
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6. (/P)â€”The
Williamson bill to carry out the
first of President Hoover's propos
als to strengthen dry enforcement
by transferring the prohibition unit
from the Treasury to the Justice
Department today received its first
consideration in the House, where
its passage by Saturday virtually
was assured.
Although there is little opposi
tion t,o the transfer there, an at
tack was launched immediately by
wets and drys against a provision
to make the Attorney General and
Secretary of the Treasury jointly
responsible for regulation of indus
trial alcohol permits. Tlje wets are
agreed that they want to give the
drys everything they desire to en
force the law under the bill, so
that there will be no alibi when, as
they contend, enforcement will
have failed in the Justice Depart
ment.
