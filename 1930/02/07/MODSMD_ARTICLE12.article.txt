Mother Nature seems to under
stand the problems of men. Here
is proof that she sometimes helps
solving them.

to the polls to deeide whether they
should retain or tear down the
wooden awnings that have pro
truded over the town's sidewalks
for •years Mother Nature poured
forth rain by the bucketful. Voters
traversed Hi" protected walks and
kepi dry.
Likewise! they voted to keep the
awnings in place. The vote was Gis
to 27 in their favor. When the bal
lots were counted Hie skies cleared.
