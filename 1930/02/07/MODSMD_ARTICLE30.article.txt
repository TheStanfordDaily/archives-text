# DOES STANFORD ALSO SIN?
## 
### 
Do the three sins of the present American University system, I
ns pronounced by Hamilton 1 1011, president of Rollins College,
npplv lo Stanford? The vices are: first, the insatiable impulse to I
expand materially; second, the glorification of research at the ex- j
poise of teaching; third, the lack of human contact between teacher
and student.
11 ere there are tendencies on the part of both faculty and stu
dents to deplore the existing cramped conditions and seek methods]
whereby, the Stanford plant and the Stanford name can be enlarged
o as to Constitute the world's best, if not the largest, institution.
( )f course, this would undoubtedly include the augmentation of '
additional women to the present I'ive Hundred. However, these j
pangs of growth cannot be satisfied. The I'niversity's development
112 stopped bv the apparent lack of funds. Thus, if it intentionally!
v ished "to expand materially," Stanford could not do so because
of the lack of money.
With the" encouragement of graduate study and the gradual ,
abolition of the Lower Division, Stanford seeks ihe "glorification
of research at the expanse of teaching." Although the I'niversity,
lias at present a number of men who attempt to instruct knowledge
seeking students, it also possesses a number who are more desirous
(if hunting out the cure all for human and social ills. These latter
intellectuals are almost hysterical when they learn they have been j
assigned to reveal the mysteries of Principles of Flim-Flam. It is
distinctly the I niversity's policy to encourage research to the detri- i
ment of all else.
Dr. Holt in his third indictment says the lack of human con
tact between professor and student is "the chief besetting sin of our
modern colleges." Perhaps the astute educator fails to realize that
students themselves are somewhat to blame for the apparent lack
of intercourse between the all-wise and the all-seeking. "Apple-j
polishing" is a process whereby a student or a group of students
lose temporary favor of their fellows for conversing with the in
structor. The faint stigma of ostracism is cast upon the person who
polishes apples.
()n the other side, the modern professor often welcomes con
tact with students. That is the only method by which he is able
lo determine the proper means to present the information he has
to impart. His purpose, besides that of instruction, is to point out
the goal to which a student may climb. Stanford is proud of its)
new school of professors there are many contacts between fac
ulty and students. Fven those who indulge in monastic research
sometimes appreciate stimulating encounters with students.
