YOUTH'S ADVENTURE. By
Allan A. Hunter. New York: D.
Appleton & Company. 1925.
"Youth's Adventure" is a plea for
candor and Christianity. "What is de
manded now is ventilation of the
mind; freedom from sham and that
sentimentality which sugar-coats real
ity." In a sense, it may be considered
as an apocalypse of the youth move
ment. This adolescent revolution,
Hunter says, is conspicuous in Ger
many and China. In the United States
it is small as a mustard seed. The
chief danger that the young encounter
in America is no tempetation to radi
calism.
Having said this, the author estab
lishes two ideals, reverence for per
sonality, and, strange as it may seem
at first, sublimation of die individual
to the social scheme. "Co-operation"
i is the term used. This ideal re-occur
' ring in the youth movement is no sur-
J prise. The narrow strand of socialism
leads back unbroken through the intri
cate mazes of history to that spool of
| occidental religion, Jesus Christ. The
: L'npropertied Preacher of Palestine,
unpossessed by possessions, still re
, mained the great ideal of indepeud
| once.
There is always a tendency to dis
regard the fact of Christ's unauthen
ticity. We are not certain that we
have a single sentence as it came un
tarnished from his lips. The first gos
pel was not written until forty years
after the death of the man-god. But
all this heresy is immaterial.
Christ is an individual in the mind
of the people. Certain ideas have be
come inseparably attached to him. llis
mythical biography is accepted as true
by the many. He has been the anchor
for men's souls for two thousand
years. Such an individual cannot be
disregarded. He is in truth a King
of Kings.
Most of those radicals who reject
belief in his divinity nevertheless base
their reform upon the Christian ideals
of Faith, Hope, and Charity. The
man is real if the god isn't. The au
thor does not seem satisfied with such
an acceptance of Christ. "What con
cerns us," he says, "is ibis open secret
of Jesus: he had such an immediate,
objective sense of (iod, that we can
not tear his ethics apart from that
union." There are many who would
dispute that.
The world is in a revolution of
thought. Einstein has convinced about
nine noble minds that all is not right
with the theory of gravity. Biologists
j're suspecting strange things about
the unassuming chromosome. And
then there is Mahatma Gandhi, who
like Buddha wears a loincloth, but
| rebel that he is, refuses to sit com
i lacently scrutinizing his stomach.
Allan A. Hunter's book is stimu
lating. The man asks questions. That
'is always dangerous. He places his

' hope in science hut then sensiblyasks
what lies beyond the modern cure-all.
There is a possibility that it is brother
hood. Others are on the cross besides
ourselves.

DEATH OF A HERO. By Richard
Aldington. Covici, Friede, New
York. 1929.
And still another war book! No
excuses are needed, however, to
justify Hie topic; Mr. Aldington
does that amply enough in "Death
of a Hero." He has written a sur
prisingly original and fascinating
story for his tirst novel.
On November 4, 1918, Captain
George Winterbourne of the Brit
ish Army, stands up suddenly in
the face of machine gun lire and
is instantly killed. From this in
cident "Death of a Hero" is drawn.
Mr. Aldington is extraordinarily
bitter. Even those used to modern
cynicism will be appalled at his
desperate, sneering attacks. He as
sails Victorian England and mod
ern England; he attacks the mid
dle classes and the aristocracy;
the intelligensia and art; the army
and ihe newspapers. "Journalism,"
he says, "is the lowest form of
mental prostitution; but," he adds,
"It' this, or Indeed anything, much
mattered, one might be tempted
to deplore it,"and he does not
deplore.
Mr. Aldington is a fatalist, a
pessimist, a destroyer. Yet he de
clares himself to be an idealist.
What his ideals are, he leaves for
us to decide. They must be unat
tainable in view of his overwhelm
ing attacks. His only belief seems
I to be in a certain comradeship be
tween men, and even this, he says,
is often betrayed.
"Death of a Hero" is written so
convincingly that by the time one
has finished it, it becomes difficult
to believe in anything. Mr. Alding
ton's bitterness is contagious, lie
' writes coldly, brilliantly, and yet
his descriptions of the English
country make its loveliness live
before our eyes'; In these passages
he shows us that in spite of every
thing he still believes In beauty.
Mr. Aldington has written what
he thought and what he heard and
saw in a straightforward manner,
consequently there are a good
number of asterisks in his book.
, He himself says, however, that he
; had not the slightest intention of
appealing to anyone's salacious in
stincts, as his theme was too seri
ously tragic for that.
"Death of a Hero" is called by
its author "a memorial in its inef
fective way to a generation which
hoped much, strove honestly, and
suffered deeply." It. is more than
1 this —it is a great book. N. J.
