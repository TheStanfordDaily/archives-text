The Editor, Sir:
1 John Olsen, "the whitest cop that
ever pinched a co-ed for speeding
to make Roble Hall before lockout
i hour," is saying goodbye to the
Stanford campus as traffic officer.
Needless to say, most o£ us are
sorry to see him go, because "John
had that rare quality of giving you
a tag if you needed one, and mak
ing you "like it." Those of us who
i have been here some years can
really appreciate him and his
splendid work of traffic organ i/.a

Where his predecessors would

| greet a speeder with a very sour
i and gruff "Hey you! Pull over;
what's tlie big idea," etc., etc.,"
: John would more often give a

gratifying to set' the results
j achieved by his methods. John un-

him. His pleasant personality lias
changed "that damn cop" to "Our
John." That's all. except we wisli
him the best of luck and hope that
his successor lias half the "stuff"
