WASHINGTON, Feb. G. </p)—

"the refusal to reply to a courteous
communication within reasonable
time, that is official in character,
by any department, or a reply that
may be either mistaken or decep
tive in character. These things, I
say, sir, are things simply thai, are
not done in official lite —except by
the Secretary of the Treasury of
the United States."
Senator Johnson spoke his mind
after reading to the Senate an ex
change of correspondence with
Secretary Mellon over patronage in
California. The nomination of

customs at San Francisco, was
pending.
The Senator recalled that this
office had been abandoned in

told the Senate, he wrote to Mr.
Mellon asking about it. He said ,

partment knows of no reason why \
the policy which has been followed
since 1925 should be changed at
this time and is not recommending
the appointment of a surveyor at
San Francisco."
Johnson related how Tracey then
was appointed three months later'
to this office which had been aban
doned. He said he then wrote to
Mr. Mellon but had received no j
reply.
