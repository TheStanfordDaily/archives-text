In the discussion of opportunities ;
for college men in aviation lour fields
will be considered. The vocations of j
pilots and ground men will be taken
I up in this article, while openings avail
able to the commercial operator and)
the aeronautical engineer will be dis
| cussed next week.
PILOTS
On January 1, 1929, there were in
the L'nited States approximately -4,000 i
: airplane pilots licensed by the Ue
' partment of Commerce. The depart- ;
ment issues licenses for transport pi- ;
I lots (unlimited as to the type of li- j
I censed aircraft or area of flying),!
i limited commercial pilots (limited in 1
j area), industrial pilots (carrying only
; freight), and private pilots. The ap-
I plicant for any type of industrial li- >
cense must be eighteen years of age, |
j pass a thorough physical examination j
!by a designated physician, and have i
had 20(1 hours of solo living in the |
j case of transport or limited commer-
I cial licenses or 50 hours for an indus-
I trial license.
Army Pilots in Demand
Most of the large air transport corn- i
I panies employ pilots trained in the
army or navy, although training can
be secured in private schools. Lind
bergh, as a trustee of the Guggenheim
: Fund, says that a man should not ex
; peel to secure thorough training in a
private school for less than $500 or
with less than fifty to one hundred
! hours of flying and seventy-live hours
of ground training. Of the private
schools, the Boeing School of Aero
nautics, located at the Oakland Air
port, is as good as can be found.
The army gives one year of inten
sive training to carefully selected ap
plicants (about 200 a year) at Brooks
Field and Kelley Field, San Antonio,
| including about 300 hours of flying
i and 500 to 000 hours of ground work.
! The cadet receives $75 a month and

allowances while training, and ii suc
cessful is discharged at the end oi a
year as a second lieutenant in the Air
Reserve Corps. About 00 per cent ol
a class of 2(H) pass.
Pilots are used by the many passen
ger and freight transport companies,
the L'nited States Forest Service,
Coast Guard and Weather Bureau, and
by many commercial companies. In
1027 the sixteen companies contracting
for air mail service flew planes an
average of 10,382 miles daily.
Pay Is Varied
The compensation of a pilot ranges
from the $50 to $100 a week paid the
utility pilot of smaller companies, to
the $600 to $900 a month paid air mail
pilots.
GROUND FORCE
It is estimated that ten mechanics
are needed on the ground lor every
pilot in the air. The demand will in
crease for this type of work, lor the
large, expensive machines now coming
into use need careful and expert
checking and repairing.
Training at San Luis
A good course of training in such
work can be secured at the California
Polytechnic, at San Luis Obispo. The
course in aeronautics given there in
cludes such subjects as ship construc
tion and rigging, aircraft motors,
aerodynamics, aeronautical navigation,
and aeronautical meteorology. Cotn
, pletion of the junior college course
there fits one to take the Department
of Commerce examinations for air
plane mechanic or airplane-engine me
chanic. I r or ground work a man
should be expert in one of several
fields: rigging, radio repair, battery
repair, ignition, instrument repair, etc.
Compensation of a helper is a salary
of $125 to $150 a month with some
range upward, while the licensed me
chanic starts in at $IXOO a year and
I may work up to $3500.
