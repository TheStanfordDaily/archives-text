# THE
						PASSING OF JOE COLLEGE
## 
### 
(From Ihe Daily I Hint) |

Now that twelve-weeks grades have
J been sent in, the Axe-(irinders have
started grinding, the hrst snow has
1 melted — in short, now that it has
soaked in on everyone that school is
indubitably under way, enough time
has elapsed to show the yearly devel
opment of the Typical Student. Ev
ery year there are slight changes in
his makeup and demeanor, but these
are changes in the mass production I
and not individual variations. j
As lias been remarked countless
times before, there is a definite striv
ing toward standardization of the col
-1 lege type, and conformity i* the great
i god Brown. This is a more tor less '
[conscious effort 011 the student's parti
'—it must be, to attain such results. In '
| this case, we are referring exclusively'
to men, for this is undeniably a man's
school, even if it has turned out not
to be a man's world. At any rate, cach
student does his best to keep his entire
life—school work, dating, conversa
tion—within the confines dictated by
the mythical ideal.
Joe College of a year or so ago,
with his crushable hats, nail-studded
heels that scraped, dragging pant-legs,
and this month's Colegc Humor dia
logue, has been replaced by a soberer,
conservative individual. This new
figure appears, spatted and wooly
coated, at his eight o'clock, comes in
quietl\' and does not guffaw during the
entire period.
I A significant straw in the wind is
the fact that local haberdashers are '
beginning to suggest silk hats for col
lege functions, though not without

some temerity. And in conversation
over the counter, suspenders have be
come "braces." Now and then one
even overbears the name of a book
figuring in social conversation. Life
has begun to be a rather serious af
fair, and the word "job" 110 longer
means a committee membership. A
few still cling to the old order, going
their blithe way and cutting classes
up to the hilt. But their day is fast
going, ft has become the fashion to
be conservative, and conservative they
must be, or be relegated to the realm
of the Charleston and bell-bottomed
trousers.
Not without regret do we watch the
disappearance of Joe C ollege. Me had
many good qualities, not the least 01
which was a refreshing insouciance in
the face of all difficulties, from a flat
tire to a broken date. It is not good
to take one's self too seriously—it
dulls the most formidable weapon
which youth can wield against tin
world, a sense of humor.
