# LATEST DISCOVERY IN PRODUCING LIFE DESCRIBED BY HEYL
## German Scientist Makes Respiration Ferment In Laboratory 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 6 (/P). â€” The
Litest step by science toward one*of j
its hardest tests, learning whether it
can produce life artificially in its lab- |
oratories, was described recently by j
Dr. Paul R. I ley 1, physicist of the :
I S. JUireau of Standards, when he j
s|i >ke before a meeting of the New
Vork Electrical Society.
This step, he said, is the 1 discovery
within the year by Professor Hans
Fischer of Munich, (iermany, of a j
way to make artificially the substance <
called the "respiration ferment." This I
matter is the red part of the blood
corpuscle, both in humans and aui-|
mals. It carries the oxygen from the j
lungs to the body tissues. Without it j
a person would quickly suffocate. s
r ischer, after seventeen years' re-j
search, succeeded in making the fer- j
went from ordinary chemicals, in
i luding carbon, hydogen, oxygen, and
nitrogen.
"The body," said Dr. Hcyl, "is after {
all simply a physical and chemical j
laboratory. There is no reason why I
we cannot understand it all some day. j
< )ue hundred years ago it was con- j
sidcred impossible to make synthcti- J
rally such a thing as an organic com- i
pound, a substance having certain pe- j
culiarities of living things, it was)
even impious to think it might be done, i
Yet now thousands of these organic
compounds have been produced syn
thetically.
"Fischer's ferment is the middleman
ii delivery of oxygen from our blood
Hi bodily tissue ~ I am quite satisfied
that eventually we shall come to a
solution of the mystery of life. Then
we shall understand all the life pro
cesses as well as we now know the 1
burning of a lump of coal.
"Protoplasm i> the basis of all liv- j
ing matter. Some day we shall learn
how to produce protoplasm. It may or
it may not turn out to be living. If it
is alive, we shall have created life
artificially." I
