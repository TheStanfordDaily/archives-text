# EMINENT GEOLOGIST DISCUSSES PROBLEM OF SEA COAST RISE
## 
### 
Speaking before members oL' I lie
' leology department and advanced
tudents yesterday afternoon, Pro
lessor Douglas M. Johnson, of
Columbia Cniversity, discussed a
phase of geological study concern
ing the rise and fall of (lie sea
level.
lie showed that the benches in
I lie stone along the sea coast could
have been caused by the action of
the waves in periods of exception
ally high tides. Several theories
are in existence at present, princi
pally Daly's theory which supposes
.1 drop in sea level of about 20
feet. Johnson's observations have
disproved that, for geological signs
have showed that there have been
no changes in the sea level along
the Atlantic Coast for a period
ranging from 3000 to 5000 years.
Dr. Johnson is on his way homo
from the International Geological
Congress in South Africa. He has
been away l'rom Columbia for
about six months, studying the
physiography of Australia, Java,
Japan, and the Hawaiian Islands.
During the war, Johnson was a
major In the A.E.F. and was the
only geographer in the army. Since
that time he has become one of the
foremost physiographers in the
world.
