# REINFORCEMENT OF FAMOUS TOWER OF PISA TO BE MADE
## 
### 
I'ISA, Italy, Feb. 6. (fi>) The
Leaning Tower of Pisa, lodestone
of the American tourist who visits
Italy, is to be straightened at its
base in order to prevent its lean
ing too far over and crashing.
A meeting of the special com
mission appointed by the, Minister
of National Education, including
the best engineers in the kingdom,
decided that two methods are to be
pursued, as a result of findings
made in the last several months.
One consists in making the basin
from which the tower rises im
permeable, so that water cannot
seep through and eat. at the founda
tion of the tower. The second eon
sists in the gradual consolidation
and strengthening of the ground
around and under the monument.
This would be done with reinforced
concrete.
The tower at present is 14 feet
out of the perpendicular. Engineer.,
say it leans because during con
struction the ground on the south
side fell. An inclination in the op
posite direction from the third
story up then followed. The tower
is Jti!Â» feet high, has eight stories,
six of which are surrounded by
colonnades, and was built between
1 17d and KifiO.
Two years ago engineers de
clared that the degree of inclina
tion was increasing, and the tower
was in grave danger of falling. Ex
perts then adopted the temporary
expedient of shooting cement, into
the earth under the lower. Now,
however, more permanent meas
ures are necessary.
