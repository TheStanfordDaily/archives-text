"Four solutions oL' lhe Philippine
' problem confront the American
people," said Professor Payson J.
Treat of the history department in
an interview yesterday regarding
the proposed legislation before
1 Congress for immediate or eventu
al independence of the Philippines.
Professor Treat's four alterna
tives'are either a frank statement
that the islands will be held per
manently by the United States, u
continuance of the present policy
of control pending internal devel
opment, a grant of autonomy under
American or international guaran
ty, or the granting of independence
j to the islands.
Force Not Best Policy
! "Of the four proposals, the most
reasonable is that which advocates
; American control for a term of
i years," lie continued. "It would be
; very helpful if the leaders of the
Philippine people would accept

such a plan in good faith. If they
J do not, and if the independence
' agitation passes from words to
i deeds, it would be a most regret
; table thing if the United States
j should maintain its sovereignty by
j force in the islands."
Professor Treat summarizes the
! status that the problem has re
j tained for years. "Manila has as
i serted, 'We have set up a stable
j government,' and Washington has
| replied, 'Not according to our in
| terpretation of the term.'
Appropriations Needed
"If an agreement could be
reached in this respect," he con
j eluded, "and if Congress would do
| more than exhort the Filipinos to
! march forward, but would follow
| the example of Japan and appro
i priate a few million dollars every
i year for public education, internal
: improvements, or other useful
j things, a better spirit of co-opera
, tion might develop in the islands."
