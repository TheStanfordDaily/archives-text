# Cardinals Set For Trojan Cage Invasion
## TOMORROW'S TILT TO DECIDE FARM CHANGES IN P.C.C. Hunt Optimistic; To Star Vance Fawcett and McCandless 
### Stephen Dietrich 
All set to advance a step nearer the
coveted Conference championship,
Coach Sam Harry is bringing his high
powered Trojan varsity to the Farm
tomorrow evening to tangle with the
Cards on their home hardwood at <X
o'clock.
However, the anticipated win is
quite likely to prove a disastrous up
set, according to Husky Hunt, head
mentor of basketball activities on the
Farm. For Stanford will not only be
battling to win the Troy series, two
game;, to one, but will be making its
final drive to get out of the Confer
ence cellar and back into a mathemati
cal chance for the title as well.
Hunt went on to point out yester-.
day before practice that I'.S.C. is not
as invincible as the various southern
scribes crack it up to be,, barely nosing
out Cal by a one-goal margin on two
occasions. Then, too, the Cards broke
even with Harry's five down south
Ihree weeks ago, losing out in the
second game largely due to bad
breaks.
Cards at Best
Tf Stanford shows as much good
basketball tomorrow as ii did against
St. Ignatius on Tuesday last, the Tro
jans are in for an unexpected hectic
fracas. The Cards were unbeatable
during the last half of the Gray Fog
tilt, and ran all over the boys who
were touted as the best in the West.
With hopes of getting a jump on
the Trojan quintet, Hunt is planning
to start his strongest lineup possible.
Vance Fawcett, one of the cleverest
floor men on the Coast, will open at
forward for the first time since the
opening engagement of the U.S.C. se
ries. Fawcett has been benched a
good part of the time this season be
cause of poor condition, but against
St. Ignatius demonstrated that he has
returned to top form once more.
Paired with Fawcett will be the vet
eran Red Berg, who stole the show
during the U.C.LA. encounter last
Friday. Although the smallest man on
the squad, the flashy redhead has been
a mainstay of the Card offense, with
his timely shooting, and is due for an
other sharpshooting exhibition against
the Trojans.
Long John Starts
Long John McCandless will handle
the center position duties as usual.
Long John is high scorer for the
Stanford live to date, being especially
"hot" in the first Bruin game and lo
cating the basket for thirteen tallies
against St. Ignatius. The elongated
pivot man may find the going tougher
tomorrow, as the Trojans play a man
to man defense and are not at all
backward about using football tactics
under their own goal.
Holding down the guard berths will
lie ( aptain Kothert and Mike Rey
nolds. The defensive work of this
pair has been outstanding in every
game this year without exception, be
ing responsible for most of Stanford's
wins, in Hunt's estimation. Reynolds'
big features is his ability to recover
the ball off the backboard, even when
the going gets roughest.
Rothert's Hands Full
Rothert will have bis hands full,
though, in trying to get the tip-off, as
his opponent, Wilbur Caldwell, meas
ures a full six feet and four inches
lengthwise. Caldwell has* lots of
spring in his lower limbs for a man
of bis bulk, and consistently got the
jump over Wot hert down south, which
put the Cards under a big handicap.
And Hunt believes that the tip-off may
go a long ways in deciding the final
outcome of tomorrow's tilt.
Another man whom the Cards will
be out to bottle up is Jess Mortensen,
of football and javelin tossing fame.
Mortensen can also toss the basket
ball with uncanny ease, and only last
week he pulled the Cal game out of
the lire with a last-minute flip.
Mortensen and Caldwell are not the
only elongated" lads on Barry's outfit,
