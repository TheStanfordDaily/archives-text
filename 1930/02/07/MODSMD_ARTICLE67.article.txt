## Singer Enters Lightweight Boxing With Chance to Ruin Mandell in Titular Fight in Florida 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Al Singer, one of the two great
| est drawing cards at Madison
I Square Garden, N.Y., nowadays,
i will hereafter fight as a genuine
I light weight, having left the 130-
pound division forever. When Al
; inel the Babbling Brook of Jersey,
Young Zazzarino, on October 11,
j he lost a. $500 weight forfeit, be
! cause he scaled a pound over the
| 130 agreed upon. After the A bad
'and Nebo lights, the latter taking
place on November 29, Singer and
I his manager, Hymie Chaplin, will
shove off for Florida, where, it is
rumored, the popular Jewish lad
! will meet Sammy Mandell, the
! Rockl'onl Sheik, in a titular fight
i some time in February.
j The Bronx boy showed, against
i Zazzarino, that losing a close' de
| cision to Kid Chocolate last sum
| mer had not affected his fighting
jability. He nearly murdered the
| "Great Gabbo" from the other side
' of the Hudson, and was about to
finish him when the referee stop
ped it in the sixth round. In this
fight Singer hit his opponent with
I every fair blow known to boxing,
side-stepped or stifled "Zazzy's"
wild rushes, and knocked the talk
ative one down twice before the
slaughter was halted.
Some may claim that Al Singer
will have no chance with Sammy

I Mandell, if I hey do meet, because
; Canzoneri, with whom Singer j
! fought a draw, was quite outclassed i
by the lightweight champion. But)
I Singer is a better fighter-now than >
■he was when lie met the busy !
Tony, and he will go on improving, j
He has proved his courage and his j
will-to-win by the way he has come
back after being knocked out by j
! Ignacio Fernandez, and his many j
friends are still counting on bis j
becoming "A Second Benny Leon- >
i ard."
