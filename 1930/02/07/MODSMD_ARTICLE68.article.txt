LOS ANGELES, Feb. fi. f/P)â€” j
America's talkie actors received a j
i little free advice today from Alas-j
; tail* Mac Donald, son of the British j
I Premier, and it didn't concern poli- j
; tics or architecture, but speaking, j
"The movie players should act ;
| natural instead of affecting the !
j British broad "A," Mac Donald oh- !
J served. "Affectation is despised by !
j English playgoers and those of the j
I films should not try to ape the
i English in their broad pronuneia
i tion. All they ask is that they enun
i eiate clearly. We have found that
| most American screen actors talk '
' through their noses."
