the inn of which Mirandolina is
mistress. McDowell appeared last
year as John Shand in Barrie's
"What Every Woman Knows," and
as Austin Lowe in "The Second
Man."
Hurt Is Forlipopoli

Forlipopoli, a noble suitor of the
mistress, will be seen Arthur Hurt,
who will be remembered as James
Wylie in "What Every Woman
Knows." Hurt appeared last quar
ter in the character part of Old
Beppo in A. A. Milne's "The Ivory

mistress of the inn.

in "The Makropoulos Secret" hero
last summer, will make his second

Two Actresses

sia and Djaneira; and Gaillard
Fryer, who appeared in last year's
senior furco, "Not Herbert,'' will

marquis.
"The Mistress of the inn" is a
play full of comic situations and
by-play, and one which makes use
of the soliloquy in true Goldoni
fashion. The lead, Mirandolina, was
immortalized by Eleanora Duse,

Italy's greatest contribution to the
stage, who played the part in
Italian in 1!»(>5. The play was pro
duced under its original ttiie, "La
liOcaridiera," by Eva Le Gallienne
at the New York Civic Repertory
Theatre in FJ26, with this actress
director in the title role. It is the
Le Gallienne version of Goldoni's
play which Helvenston will pre
sent here tonight.
