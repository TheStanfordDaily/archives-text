# Varsity Loses Four Matches In Tennis Tilts
## Easton Downs Phil Neer For Only Card Win Of Afternoon 
### Ed Peck 
A brilliant, smashing victory by Tod
Easton over Phil Neer, former na
tional intercollegiate net champion,
saved Coach Ragan's varsity netmen
from a clean-sweep defeat at the
hands of a Stanford alumni team yes
terday on thi' local courts.
In the doubles thriller of the after
noon, Captain Larry Hall and Larry
Driscoll came within a point of up
setting A! Herrington and Ralph Mc-
F.lvenny, intercollegiate champs three
years ago, only to lose the match after
three flashy sets. Cranston Holnian,
Pacific Coast champ, beat out Keith
Cledhill, national junior title-holder,
in a one set added attraction, by an
<X-(> score.
The alumni team took two of the
three singles matches and both the
doubles. Holnian found Larry Hall
nervous and easily beat him out in
straight sets, 6-2, 6-3. -Easton took
second singles from Neer, 1-6, 8-6,
6-4. Herrington heat Driscoll, 6-2,
6-4. McElvennv and Harrington de
feated Hall and Driscoll, 3-6, 10-,S,
7-5. Holnian and John Wlicatley won
from Plymire and Stephens of the
varsity, 6-2, 6-3.
With tin *ee high class matches going
on all at one time most of the after
noon, the spectators who filled the
bleachers .were in much the same fix
as the small boy who can't decide
which pierce of candy to choose. Hol
nian and Cledhill furnished most of
the thrills in an exhibition set which
saw Holnian win four games in a
row to overcome Gledhill's 5-4 lead
and pull out the set 8-6.
