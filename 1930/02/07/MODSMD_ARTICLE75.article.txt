DIVOT DIGGi.NG WITHOUT COST

Moat persons would break forth
in convulsions of chuckles if told
that Stanford had more than one
golf course.
The laugh is on themselves,
however, as all one has to do
almost any hour of the day is
to drop around to the polo field
and he will be dumbfounded at
the golfing spectacle thereon.
For instead of tiie dull thud of
galloping polo ponies, all that one
hears is the continual resounding
click of golf clubs socking little
white pellets into the ozone.
True, the field is a most un
usual golf course, composed en
tirely of fairway and quite
holeless. But for all that, it
makes an excellent practice
place as its popularity well
shows.
Earlier in the year plenty of
competition was offered by the front
lawn of Encina Hall as a putting
green. Hut the campus gardeners,
in a final effort to save their
greensward from utter destruction,
recently proceeded to spread it.
over Willi a thick layer of grass
tonic.
At once the frosh niblic
swingers moved across to the
polo field en masse. And at
times the unusual divot dig
ging ground fairly teems with
these inexperienced lovers of
the old Scotch pastime.
There being no holes, par for the
course is as many strokes as one
wishes to take. Which- is no small
item, as some of the golfers evi
dently baptize the field with their
lirsl switigs at the ball.
The Daily reporter, a char
ter member and par-shooting
dub of said course, was sur
prised the other day to note a
brother gold fledgling playing
between two goal posts on the
mural football field that bor
ders the polo pastures.
On closer investigation, it was j
easy to see that the club swinger
was teeing off under one crossbar
with a mashie and trying to place
the ball between the opposite set
of uprights.
And how that person could
place his shots, making at least
a dozen straight conversions!
Ho, thought the Daily reporter, ,
if a man can mashie over twelve
goals in rapid succession from the
oilier end of (lie field, why cannot
the talented gridiron stalwarts who
cavort around the Farm Stadium
boot over a vast majority of their
tries from within the very shadow
of the goal posts?
Perhaps the game should be
revolutionized —and the golf
club substituted for the edu
cated toe!
At any rate, the Farm gtflfers |
are not confined to pursue their j
activities on the regulation Uni- j
versify course, which is continually i
crowded and at. which nice fat dues
are charged. And persons new in
Ihe avl of handling drivers, bras- •
sies, et al. can practice without
cost on "a most unique and holeless
fairway.
Both the University course
and the dubs profit greatly
thereby, as the latter practice
unhampered and gratis, while
the new course does not be
come as ploughed up as it
otherwise would. May the
B.A.C. refrain from putting
thumbs down on divot digging
at the polo grounds.

For instead of tiie dull thud of

hears is the continual resounding
click of golf clubs socking little

True, the field is a most un

There being no holes, par for the
course is as many strokes as one
wishes to take. Which- is no small
item, as some of the golfers evi
dently baptize the field with their
lirsl switigs at the ball.
The Daily reporter, a char
ter member and par-shooting
dub of said course, was sur
prised the other day to note a
brother gold fledgling playing
between two goal posts on the
mural football field that bor
ders the polo pastures.
On closer investigation, it was j
easy to see that the club swinger
was teeing off under one crossbar
with a mashie and trying to place
the ball between the opposite set
of uprights.
And how that person could
place his shots, making at least
a dozen straight conversions!
Ho, thought the Daily reporter, ,
if a man can mashie over twelve
goals in rapid succession from the
oilier end of (lie field, why cannot
the talented gridiron stalwarts who
cavort around the Farm Stadium
boot over a vast majority of their
tries from within the very shadow
of the goal posts?
Perhaps the game should be
revolutionized —and the golf
club substituted for the edu
cated toe!
At any rate, the Farm gtflfers |
are not confined to pursue their j
activities on the regulation Uni- j
versify course, which is continually i
crowded and at. which nice fat dues
are charged. And persons new in
Ihe avl of handling drivers, bras- •
sies, et al. can practice without
cost on "a most unique and holeless
fairway.
Both the University course
and the dubs profit greatly
thereby, as the latter practice
unhampered and gratis, while
the new course does not be
come as ploughed up as it
otherwise would. May the
B.A.C. refrain from putting
thumbs down on divot digging
at the polo grounds.
