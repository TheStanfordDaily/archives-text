# VARSITY, FROSH TRACK TEAMS HOLD PRACTICE MEET TODAY AT 4:10 O'CLOCK
## 
### Theodore DeMotte 
Real contests for places loom
this afternoon when the varsity
and freshman track teams engage
in a meet at the old oval, starting
at 4:10 o'clock. All the races are
to be full distance.
Only a few of the squad members
were out for practice last, night.
Coach Templeton put Hec Dyer
through a long workout on start
ing since Dyer has been a notori
ously poor starter, usually winning
after having given his opponents a
handicap of a yard or two. Last
night, however, he started against
both Les Hables and Johnny Mor
rison, both of whom are fast start
ers, and he was out of his holes
ahead of them consistently.
A pretty race should result in
the first event when John Parker
and Dick Wright meet in the mile.
Parker has been out of condition,
but he is improving fast. Wright
was in poor shape last year, but
his 4:38 mile in the intramural
should give Parker plenty to think
about.
Cooper will have a chance to try
his speed against Atkinson in the

I 880. Atkinson won the intramural
l SBO in 2:01, which is better than
i Cooper has shown as yet. Neikirk,
last year's letterman in the event,
lis not in shape to run.
Johnny Morrison will probably
have his hands full winning the
440-yard dash, with Hubbard,
j Shove, and Eastman in the race.
Les Hables is not expected to run
I the 440.
Even time or better is almost a
1 cinch in the sprints this afternoon.
Dyer will have his hardest oppo
sition from Howell and Giberson,
1 and from Hables, it' the latter runs.
Dyer should win hotli races unless
he has an off day.
Krenz should encounter little op
position in the shot, though he may
have his troubles with Henri La
borde in the discus. Mucti interest
is centere d in the form Dowell and
West will show in the broad jump,
1 for the points these two men take
in the U.S.C. meet ibis year will
be very important. Dowell seems
i good for 24 feet or better this year,
while West should get into the
same class by mid-season.

i good for 24 feet or better this year,
while West should get into the
same class by mid-season.
Real contests for places loom
this afternoon when the varsity
and freshman track teams engage
in a meet at the old oval, starting
at 4:10 o'clock. All the races are
to be full distance.
Only a few of the squad members
were out for practice last, night.
Coach Templeton put Hec Dyer
through a long workout on start
ing since Dyer has been a notori
ously poor starter, usually winning
after having given his opponents a
handicap of a yard or two. Last
night, however, he started against
both Les Hables and Johnny Mor
rison, both of whom are fast start
ers, and he was out of his holes
ahead of them consistently.
A pretty race should result in
the first event when John Parker
and Dick Wright meet in the mile.
Parker has been out of condition,
but he is improving fast. Wright
was in poor shape last year, but
his 4:38 mile in the intramural
should give Parker plenty to think
about.
Cooper will have a chance to try
his speed against Atkinson in the

I 880. Atkinson won the intramural
l SBO in 2:01, which is better than
i Cooper has shown as yet. Neikirk,
last year's letterman in the event,
lis not in shape to run.
Johnny Morrison will probably
have his hands full winning the
440-yard dash, with Hubbard,
j Shove, and Eastman in the race.
Les Hables is not expected to run
I the 440.
Even time or better is almost a
1 cinch in the sprints this afternoon.
Dyer will have his hardest oppo
sition from Howell and Giberson,
1 and from Hables, it' the latter runs.
Dyer should win hotli races unless
he has an off day.
Krenz should encounter little op
position in the shot, though he may
have his troubles with Henri La
borde in the discus. Mucti interest
is centere d in the form Dowell and
West will show in the broad jump,
1 for the points these two men take
in the U.S.C. meet ibis year will
be very important. Dowell seems
i good for 24 feet or better this year,
while West should get into the
same class by mid-season.
