# BEARS MUST BEAT BRUINS TONIGHT TO STAY IN P.C.C. RACE
## 
### 
IJKRKELKY. ! ; ch. f>. â€” Fifteen
Golden Bear basketball players left
the University of California last night
for Los Angeles to face U.( .L.A. to
night and tomorrow night in a des
perate last stand for a place in the
southern division conference race.
U.C.L.A.'s powerful quintet is the
most formidable hurdle the Hears must
clear. 11l fact, to figure in the title
race at all they must win every league
game remaining on their schedule, and
judging from their past difficulties
with southern California teams, the
task set for them is a hard one.
As a matter of fact, the Bears'
chances in the conference are exceed
ingly slim. Not only will they have to
win every game to figure in the final .
tabulation, but will have to have no J
little luck as well.
The Bears, even by winning all of
championship unless Southern Califor
nia loses two of the next three games
their games, cannot possibly take the ;
schedule. The Trojans don't appear
to be about to do that, and even if ,
they lose one game and California is
undefeated, the conference race will j
eiml in a California-C.S.C. tie, as it
did in 1928. ,
