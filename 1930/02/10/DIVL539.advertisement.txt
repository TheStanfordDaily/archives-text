Watering 87,000
Horses
On Horseshoe Lake near Oklahoma City, in
a businesslike,compact building, 8 7,ooohorses
(figuratively speaking) are stabled . . . nearly
three for every family in Oklahoma City. For
with the completion of a new unit of the Okla
homa Gas <5c Electric Company's power sta
tion at this point, the total generating capacity
was raised from 46,930 to 87, 130 horsepower.
To keep these "horses" up to full working
condition, and do it cheaply as possible, is no
small job. Just the water required is 86,400,-
oco gallons daily, the equivalent of eight days'
supply for Oklahoma City.
The new generating unit was made necessary
by the expansion of industrial activity through
out Oklahoma and particularly by the in- '
creased use of electric power by the oil industry.
For it, improved valves, fittings, and piping,
so vital to efficient and economical power
production, were supplied by Crane Co. Thus
in these modern times does progress in one
industry bring progress in another.
No matte.' what branch of engineering you
enter after graduation, you are likely to find
Crane piping materials essential tools of your
profession. In the Crane book, "Pioneering in
Science," is told the story of Crane research in
metallurgy, with important scientific data and high
pressure and temperature curves. A copy will
be valuable for reference. Let us send you one.
