# MODERN BY-PLAY IN "MISTRESS" OF INN" GAINS FAVOR OF AUDIENCE
## 
### BY ELISABETH LARSH 
Provoking roars of laughter at
times, and dragging a little at oth
! er times, Harold Helvensfon's pro
j duct ion of "The Mistress of the
| inn," which was given before an
{ Assembly Hall audience Friday
| night, was a rather uneven per
| forma nee.
The play was written by Carlo
I Goldoni as a realistic comedy of
j the 18th century. It was produced
j as an 18th century play from a
j 20th century standpoint, with fre
j fiuent. lapses into modern "slap
j stick." It was these lapses that
I made the play in the eyes of the
! audience. When Gaillard Fryer, as
| the servant, neatly removed a
j dainty morsel from the fork being
I waved gracefully about by Arthur
I Hurt, the marquis, the audience
| was amused. And when Wdward
! Field, in the part of the count, used
1 a brilliant green broom to sweep
' aforesaid marquis who had fallen
j into the inevitable laundry basket,
j the audience was again amused.

j But in the periods between such
i by-play (which was of course not
! indicated in the script) there were
: moments at which things dragged
perceptibly. One hesitates to think
i what it would have been had "The
i Mistress" been given in its origi
nal five acts instead of in the Le
i Oallienne three-act version!
Until Heede, ill the lead, wa ;
! charming. Whereas the |emptatinn

| must have been great, she did not
; over-act the part of the mistress.
I Her asides and soliloquies had a
'natural, confidential air which jus
| tilled the -apparent artificiality of
Goldoni's style.
Vallejo Cantner and Arthur
l Hurt, as the cavalier and the mar
quis, carried the comedy of the
play with their elnbor&te and grace
j fill gesticulation. Each was ex
tremely funny in himself, but had
the gesticulating been confined to
one of them, the effect would have
been the greater. As Gantner's
first role, however, it was a bril
liant debut. His interpretation of
the part of the Cavalier of Itipa
fratta was a caricature which
might have been branded as over
acting, had it not been obviously
necessary to "over-act" it.
Horse-Play Good
Gaillard Fryer, as the cavalier's
servant, walked away with the at
tention of the audience in many
spots where perhaps it belonged to
the other characters on the sfagt*.
Hut his horse-play was worth it.
He was one of the most comical
servants ever seen on the campus
stage.
Catherine Musante and Phoebe
Plate made an excellent comic
team, with the former a very live
and sparkling bungler. Edward
Field and Jack McDowell played
the count and Fabrizio, not bril
liantly, but satlsfnctorilv.

Horse-Play Good

servant, walked away with the at
tention of the audience in many
spots where perhaps it belonged to
the other characters on the sfagt*.
Hut his horse-play was worth it.
He was one of the most comical
servants ever seen on the campus
stage.
Catherine Musante and Phoebe
Plate made an excellent comic
team, with the former a very live
and sparkling bungler. Edward
Field and Jack McDowell played
the count and Fabrizio, not bril
liantly, but satlsfnctorilv.
Provoking roars of laughter at

{ Assembly Hall audience Friday

| forma nee.
The play was written by Carlo
I Goldoni as a realistic comedy of
j the 18th century. It was produced
j as an 18th century play from a
j 20th century standpoint, with fre
j fiuent. lapses into modern "slap
j stick." It was these lapses that
I made the play in the eyes of the
! audience. When Gaillard Fryer, as

j dainty morsel from the fork being
I waved gracefully about by Arthur
I Hurt, the marquis, the audience
| was amused. And when Wdward

1 a brilliant green broom to sweep
' aforesaid marquis who had fallen
j into the inevitable laundry basket,
j the audience was again amused.
