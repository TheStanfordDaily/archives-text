# FRESHMAN CAGERS WHIP FRESNO HIGH IN LISTLESS TILT
## 
### 
With the exception of a flash of
good basketball near the end 'of
the third quarter, the game be
tween the Stanford freshmen and
ilie Fresno High eagers Saturday
night was a listless affair in which
Ihe Card frosh had little trouble
in keeping ahead, to finish on the
long end of a 31 to 13 score.
After playing through the first
half of t lie game without ever
seeming to become warmed up, the
two teams came to life for a mo
ment when, with the score stand
ing 13 l o -1 for the yearlings, Emer
zian began the short-lived rally of
the high school outfit by taking
tlie tip-off and sinking a long shot
from near mid-floor. Working
through the Card defense with his
teammate, Harold, Fresno center,
the fast-working high school for
ward a moment later found tlie
basket for two more markers.
Rally Short-Lived
On the next tip-off, Palmer, Card
forward, retaliated by dribbling
through the Fresno team to sink a
cripple shot single-handed at the
end of the third period. The last
quarter was featured by ragged
playing and many tries for long
shots, with the Card frosh having
things all their own way.
Cordry, playing forward for the
I'rosli in place of Meade, who was
out of tlie game with a bad foot,
displayed some clever floorwork to
tie with his teammate Tway for
high, scoring honors of seven
points.
Harold at center was high-point
man for the Fresno lligh team with
five markers to his credit.
