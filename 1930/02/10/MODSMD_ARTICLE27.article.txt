# CARDS BEATEN BY U.S.C.; LOSE TITLE CHANCE
## Stanford Misses 17 Out of 19 Chances At Free Throws; Game Ragged Thirty-Two Personal Fouls Called During Contest; Caldwell, Berg Star 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Although establishing a new Con
ference record, Coach Husky Hunt's
varsity cagers were defeated by
| U.S.C., 30 to 24, in the Farm Pa
vilion on Saturday last and were
thereby completely eliminated from
the Coast title race.
In fact, the new record, that of
missing free throws, was the di
rect cause of Stanford's most piti
ful and harrassing basket ball down
fall of the year. Out of 1!J chance.;
from the foul line, the Cardinal
blind men were able to convert
just exactly 2. Many of the other
tries missed the hoop by at least
a foot or two, while some were
flung over or under the backboard.
Miss Set-Up Baskets
But foul shots were not the only
possible points tossed away by the
Cards, for they miscued enough set
up baskets to win a whole sched
ule of tilts. It-is said that. Stanford
has an "in and out" five this sea
son. Well, the Farm lads were so
far out last Saturday night, thai
they could have scored twice as
many points had they been blind
folded.
The game was a ragged affair
at best, and was considerably
slowed down by the officials' tool's
and the crowd's hoots. Altogether,
there were 32 personal fouls called,
which also verges on being some
sort of a new Conference mark,
and no few of the decisions greatly
griped the rabid fans. Before the
engagement was concluded, Rey
nolds and Fawcett, of Stanford,
and Caldwell, of U.S.C., were
ejected from the floor on penalties.
Caldwell Autstanding
This Caldwell lad, by the way,
was the outstanding performer of
the evening. Playing at guard, In
recovered the ball off the back
hoard with exceptional regularity,
as a consequence of which Stan
ford's number of follow-up shots
totaled exactly zero. Which, com
bined with the Farm players'
"blind man's buff" tactics, was the
reason why Stanford came out. sec
i ond best.
The Trojans started out as
though they would make short
i work of the Cards, and piled tip ti
! points before Stanford was able
I to register a single tally. It was
j this early lead that proved to be
! the Southerners' margin - of vic
i lory. At half time, Troy was out
| in front by 13 to !).
Stanford Rallies
With the score at. LS to !t, I lunt

tually locating the hoop for three
j timely shots, to bring Stanford
| within three tallies of catching
I their tenacious rivals. The Card
| rooters' hilarity proved to be short
! lived, however, as the Trojan of
fense began to click once more
! while Hunt's lads tossed I lie ball
I away most hopelessly.
Besides Caldwell, at guard, .le;
Morstensen turned in a creditable
game for Troy. Mortensen not only
got more than his share of the tip
offs at center, but lie was liigh
scorer of the evening vfith H
points. The lanky Trojan's big spe
cialty was in follow shots, which
he tapped in wit 11 ease. At times,
Mortnnsen leaped so high in mak
ing these shots that he was actu
ally looking down at the basket.
For Stanford, little Red Berg
stood out, playing his usual good
floor game and looping in two
buckets. Don Tyler and Long John
McCandless also showed flashes of
form, being high-point men for
the Cards with 6 markers each.
While Stanford slid a notch
deeper into the Conference cellar
over the week-end, California sur
prised the Coast critics by nosing
out C.C.L.A. in two hectic fracases
to move up into second place rank
ing. The Hears still have an out
side chance of copping the title.

Miss Set-Up Baskets
But foul shots were not the only
possible points tossed away by the
Cards, for they miscued enough set
up baskets to win a whole sched
ule of tilts. It-is said that. Stanford
has an "in and out" five this sea
son. Well, the Farm lads were so
far out last Saturday night, thai
they could have scored twice as
many points had they been blind
folded.
The game was a ragged affair
at best, and was considerably
slowed down by the officials' tool's
and the crowd's hoots. Altogether,
there were 32 personal fouls called,
which also verges on being some
sort of a new Conference mark,
and no few of the decisions greatly
griped the rabid fans. Before the
engagement was concluded, Rey
nolds and Fawcett, of Stanford,
and Caldwell, of U.S.C., were
ejected from the floor on penalties.
Caldwell Autstanding
This Caldwell lad, by the way,
was the outstanding performer of
the evening. Playing at guard, In
recovered the ball off the back
hoard with exceptional regularity,
as a consequence of which Stan
ford's number of follow-up shots
totaled exactly zero. Which, com
bined with the Farm players'
"blind man's buff" tactics, was the
reason why Stanford came out. sec

Besides Caldwell, at guard, .le;
Morstensen turned in a creditable
game for Troy. Mortensen not only

cialty was in follow shots, which
he tapped in wit 11 ease. At times,
Mortnnsen leaped so high in mak
ing these shots that he was actu
ally looking down at the basket.
For Stanford, little Red Berg
stood out, playing his usual good
floor game and looping in two
buckets. Don Tyler and Long John
McCandless also showed flashes of
form, being high-point men for
the Cards with 6 markers each.
While Stanford slid a notch
deeper into the Conference cellar
over the week-end, California sur
prised the Coast critics by nosing
out C.C.L.A. in two hectic fracases
to move up into second place rank
