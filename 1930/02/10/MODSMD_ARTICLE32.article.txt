# MATERIAL THOUGHTS AND SERENADING

\rc Stanford women impervious to the wiles of serenading?
< )r do the lilting strains of a husky-voiced campus Rudy Yallee
cease when the serenadee losses a pan of hoi water out the window?
At the University of Washington, the northwestern abode of
the I In sky I'ack. sleep-loving students are endeavoring to encourage
rigid control over the less material minded who are willing to spend
early morning hours running up and down harmonious scales. They
deplore the lack of sophistication among the Washington co-eds.
I hey point with pride to the women of ()hio State University who
effectively silence "such carryings-on" with a deluge of water from
an upper window.
The serenading at Washington is probably better than that at
Stanford. Or maybe the business like and efficiently run svstem on
the harm does not permit such collegiate trivialities to interfere with
the desire to sleep, eat. and study. However, local serenadcrs seem
to have lost their voices.
