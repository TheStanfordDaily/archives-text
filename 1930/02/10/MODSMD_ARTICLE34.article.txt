| BOLIVAR — THE PASSIONATE
WARRiOR. By T. R. Ybarra.
! New York: Ives Washburn. 1929.
Written by a grandson of one of
Bolivar's ranking generals, this
book is much tlie same to people
of South America as< the first good
biography of George Washington
would be to the people of the
United States. It tells the life
story of a military genius of high
-1 est rank and an excellent states
man who waged relentless war 011
the Spaniards and who died an old
and broken man in exile at an age
1 when he should have been at his
prime.
Ybarra is manifestly an admirer
of Bolivar, for the Liberator, as he
was called, had become a family
I idol. Nevertheless, t lie author has
tried to cast off any bias that, he
might have and to write the story
of Bolivar "without unduly enhanc
ing virtues or condoning faults,"
and that he lias accomplished this
aim is evident when the book is
read.
As is usually the case with suc
cessful biographers, Ybarra had a
better than usual chance to collect
intimate details about Bolivar.
: Much of his materials are drawn
| from family correspondence, and
for the rest of his information he
| worked diligently at research on
both sides of the Atlantic. The re
sult is the building of a real char
. acter who had enough genius to be
I a great factor in Spanish America's
I fight for independence, but whose
weaknesses led to his death, a pau
per, at the age of forty-seven years.
Liberally sprinkled with little
j personal detail and local anec
dotes, the story reads like the rem
j iniscences of an old man rather
than a biography, and it is this
pleasant mixture of historical data
! and traditional tales that entertain
and teach at the same time. Such
reading' is one of the best possible
ways of acquiring knowledge.
As the book is read, the impar
tial observer is likely to feel, in
I some of the accounts of battles,

iliat the author is making a moun
lain out of a molehill, with his
stories of fiercely fought and ex
tremely important engagement*
where the total number of men
on both sides would scarcely equa
a division. Those battles, however
decided the fate of countries largei
in area than the mother country
itself. And as tlie author hiniseli
said in his preface, anticipating
such a criticism, "it is the stake
that counts in a contest, not the
number of contestants. How many
Spartans barred the Pass of Ther
mopylae?"
It is an especially interesting
book for persons who plan to gc
1 to South America, or who are en
I gaged in the study of South Amer
' ican politics and history.

NOT SO DUMB—At the New Stan

A typical Marian Davies picture
I And since Marian Davies is a
j clever actress when given half a
! chance, "Not So Dumb" rates very
high so far as entertainment value
j is concerned.
The blonde star has a genius for
I comedy that keeps her bubbling
! through the show with a charm
1 that makes her most, foolish re
marks appealingly funny. And
even if you are not a Marian
Davies fan, you will enjoy the
smart satire of the lines. Although
it is not the riotous comedy that
causes the audience to double up
in their seats with laughter, it is
funny enough to cause a great
many long chortles.
The misguided Dulcy flounders
into one mess after another, reach
ing the climax in a house party at
which all the wrong people are in
vited —spelling ruin to her fiance's
future. Dulcy is knocked around
pretty severely, and yet she never
learns her lesson. The novelty of
the incidents in the picture, and
the very unexpected way in which
it is all finally solved make "Not
So Dumb" unusually diverting.

| BOLIVAR — THE PASSIONATE
WARRiOR. By T. R. Ybarra.
! New York: Ives Washburn. 1929.
Written by a grandson of one of
Bolivar's ranking generals, this
book is much tlie same to people
of South America as< the first good
biography of George Washington
would be to the people of the
United States. It tells the life
story of a military genius of high
-1 est rank and an excellent states
man who waged relentless war 011
the Spaniards and who died an old
and broken man in exile at an age
1 when he should have been at his
prime.
Ybarra is manifestly an admirer
of Bolivar, for the Liberator, as he
was called, had become a family
I idol. Nevertheless, t lie author has
tried to cast off any bias that, he
might have and to write the story
of Bolivar "without unduly enhanc
ing virtues or condoning faults,"
and that he lias accomplished this
aim is evident when the book is
read.
As is usually the case with suc
cessful biographers, Ybarra had a
better than usual chance to collect
intimate details about Bolivar.
: Much of his materials are drawn
| from family correspondence, and
for the rest of his information he
| worked diligently at research on
both sides of the Atlantic. The re
sult is the building of a real char
. acter who had enough genius to be
I a great factor in Spanish America's
I fight for independence, but whose
weaknesses led to his death, a pau
per, at the age of forty-seven years.
Liberally sprinkled with little
j personal detail and local anec
dotes, the story reads like the rem
j iniscences of an old man rather
than a biography, and it is this
pleasant mixture of historical data
! and traditional tales that entertain
and teach at the same time. Such
reading' is one of the best possible
ways of acquiring knowledge.
As the book is read, the impar
tial observer is likely to feel, in
I some of the accounts of battles,

iliat the author is making a moun
lain out of a molehill, with his
stories of fiercely fought and ex
tremely important engagement*
where the total number of men
on both sides would scarcely equa
a division. Those battles, however
decided the fate of countries largei
in area than the mother country
itself. And as tlie author hiniseli
said in his preface, anticipating
such a criticism, "it is the stake
that counts in a contest, not the
number of contestants. How many
Spartans barred the Pass of Ther
mopylae?"
It is an especially interesting
book for persons who plan to gc
1 to South America, or who are en
I gaged in the study of South Amer

Davies fan, you will enjoy the
smart satire of the lines. Although
it is not the riotous comedy that
causes the audience to double up
in their seats with laughter, it is
funny enough to cause a great
many long chortles.
The misguided Dulcy flounders
into one mess after another, reach
ing the climax in a house party at
which all the wrong people are in
vited —spelling ruin to her fiance's
future. Dulcy is knocked around
pretty severely, and yet she never
learns her lesson. The novelty of
the incidents in the picture, and
the very unexpected way in which
it is all finally solved make "Not
So Dumb" unusually diverting.
