## OUR HONOR SYSTEM AGAIN 
### 
Stanford's "Honor System" is
being drawn over the coals again
—or is it YET!! An honor system
| that never has existed on the Farm
j never has —and never will exist
under Stanford's present educa
' tional system.
Just what is the Honor System?
To most of us the tiling we have
been pleased to call our Honor
System is a vague something that
permits us to write on an exami
nation while the instructor is out
of the room —something that gives
us certain other privileges, such as
being allowed to leave the room
for a time without an armed guard,
and something that even makes it
an honorable thing to tell on our
less-honorable classmates.
Obviously there can be but one
Honor System. It must, be a sys
tem which depends entirely upon
the individual honor of the student.
Perhaps the only true honor system
that ever existed was the one that
gave the system its name. The
i story has it that a certain Southern
university decided to put its stu
dents upon their honor to do the
right thing by themselves and
their instructors during written
examinations. Individually, those

1 students refused to cheat, and they
; refused to tolerate the friendship
of those who did cheat. A simple
code hut all-sufficient.!
We can't afford to adopt such a
, code of conduct here at Stanford
as long as so many of our instruc
tors admittedly grade according to
rlass average. A breach of honor
: becomes not only an individual
thing to work a hardship on the
culprit himself, but it becomes a
| distinct injury to 1 lie class as a
whole. To protect ourselves against
such an injustice we are told that
we must report violations our
selves! The proctor system has
been given an artistic touch of ef-
I ficiency by deputizing every stu
dent in the class to act as an indi
vidual overseer. A sense of honor
is far from the minds of most of
those who religiously "live up to
it!" Abject fear, NOT HONOR, is
i the controlling nemesis. And to
I he minds of a few of us ihe person
who would report a violation is the
same kind of individual who would
| have a little social drink with the
; poor widow, and then proceed to
i turn his benefactor over to the
j hungry proliis! (With apologies to
the Hearst newspapers!)
