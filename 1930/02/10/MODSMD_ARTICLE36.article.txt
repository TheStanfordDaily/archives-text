# CAN WE HAVE BOTH?

### 
i The Editor, Sir:
I 1 was interested in 1 lie editorial
in this morning's issue of the Stan
ford Daily which implies that a
proctor system and the Honor
Code cannot go together.
Why not?
Most of us, surely, are glad to
know that there are policemen in
the community to watch those who
need to he watched, instead of
1 having to assume this distasteful
job ourselves. Again, surely no

i person with a true sense of honor
feels that jusl because there are
policemen, he is privileged to try
to "get l>v" with everything lie
can.
Perhaps the reply will lie that
1 we must assume that all Stanford
students are honorable. Lovely,
hut not. practicable, in the light
of past history here —or at any
j other institution, for that matter.
Faithfully yours,
—Just an Onlooker
