The proximity of final examina-r
tions causes one to consider the j
University method of grading uni
versity students, and such a con
sideration is likely to lead to tlie
conclusion that the method is tui
■ fair.
The method is not unfair inten
tionally; but final examinations,
by their very nature, cannot give
la true indication of a student's
ability. An explanation of this con
, tention is due.
An examination in an average
j course in the College of Arts and
Sciences, covering an entire semes
ter, will require a knowledge of a
vast amount of detail which is no

more than intellectual rubbish anil
which will be forgotten an soon as
the ordeal is undergone. The ques
tions will be concerned with some
of these details. It is entirely pos
sible that an intelligent student
could have a good general knowl
edge of tlie work just completed,
and yet fail to remember the points
asked in the examination.
A better way to discover the
proper grades for students would
be for the instructor to give occa
sional tests during the year, and
at the end of the term require the
student to prepare a treatise on
the subject. The Daily Student be
lieves this system would be more
fair than final examinations are.
