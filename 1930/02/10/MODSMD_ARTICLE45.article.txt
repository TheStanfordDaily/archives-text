## WHAT PRICE HOOTING

"If the Stanford rooters would
spend half as much energy try
ing to pep up their players as
they do in razzing the officials'
decisions, the Cardinals would
probably play a better brand of
basketball."
Said opinion was heard from tlie
press box following last Saturday
night's vociferous debauchery of
protests, advertised to the general
public as the Stanford-U.S.C. bas
ketball game.
Which may or may not be true,
although jeering does seem to be
contagious, and ragged tilts gen
erally become more ragged when
accompanied by outbursts of
squawks.
At any rate, the ungentle
manly antics of the fickle rab
ble at Farm hardwood festivi
ties are becoming obnoxious,
boorish, and disgraceful. A
game of good clean fun is pros
tituted into an orgy of boos,
jibes, scoffs, taunts, sneers,
hisses, hoots, howls, twits,
flouts, horse laughs, banter,
cat calls, or what, have you.
Stanford is not only getting
a black eye thereby, but its
long-established reputation of
good sportsmanship is absorb
ing plenty of K.O. punches on
the button!
Citizens of the Farm take great
eiiglit in referring to U.S.C. as a
jerkwater and second-rate institu
tion of higher learning. But never
hits a Stanford team had to face as
ungentlemanly a crowd down in
Ihe land of Troy, as did the Trojan
cagers perform before last week
end in the Farm's own Pavilion.
The students of good old Stan
ford I". have lately acquired a bad
Jiabit of booing the officials —no
matter how good or bad they might
he. There tnay well have been
ause for protests in the Cal series
Opener two weeks ago, when Blind
Bill Hollander called decisions with
his eyes closed.
But the Trojan game offered
no such alibi for an unsports
manlike demonstration. True,
the officials may have been a
little strict yet they were ab
solutely fair and none of the
penalties were one-sided boners.
And last. Saturday, the squawk
ing spectators were not satisfied
with sneering at the officials. They
went a step farther, and jeered t lie?
visiting players.
When Stanford men had free
throws (they shouldn't have
even tried to shoot them), the
house was as quiet as a mouse
hole. But if U.S.C. was on the
tossing end of a penalty, the
Pavilion degenerated into a
bedlam.
AVhich, on one occasion, led the
Trojan shooter to appeal to the
referee for silence —as foul-shoot
ing in a close game is no less than
nerve-wracking. At once, the Farm
funs retaliated with hisses and
more hisses.
Well, all one can say is that
said retaliation was rotten to
the core; even granted that the
Trojan foul-flipper was over
temperamental !
There appear to he more razz
berries stored up for the near fu
-lure, sad to say, as Blind Bill Hol
lander has failed to used discre
tion. Unless the unexpected hap
pens, Blind Bill will referee the
two remaining Cal series tilts.
In a recent letter to Coach H.
Hunt, Blind Bill wrote that he
didn't think the Farm rooters were
so bad. And added that he didn't
think he did such a bad job of
officiating, either.
He concluded with: "The booing
of the crowd at the Santa Clara-
Y.M.I. game (which Blind Bill
worked two days after the Cal
spectacle) Avas much worse."
We take it that it was just
another one of Blind Bill's
"good" nights!
So all we can do is to hope
that he has one of his "bad"
evenings up at the Oakland
Auditorium this coming week
end. And that the Stanford
rooters snap out of it along
with Coach H. Hunt's players!

"If the Stanford rooters would

Said opinion was heard from tlie
press box following last Saturday
night's vociferous debauchery of
protests, advertised to the general
public as the Stanford-U.S.C. bas
ketball game.
Which may or may not be true,

squawks.
At any rate, the ungentle
manly antics of the fickle rab
ble at Farm hardwood festivi
ties are becoming obnoxious,
boorish, and disgraceful. A
game of good clean fun is pros
tituted into an orgy of boos,
jibes, scoffs, taunts, sneers,
hisses, hoots, howls, twits,
flouts, horse laughs, banter,
cat calls, or what, have you.
Stanford is not only getting
a black eye thereby, but its
long-established reputation of
good sportsmanship is absorb
ing plenty of K.O. punches on
the button!
Citizens of the Farm take great
eiiglit in referring to U.S.C. as a
jerkwater and second-rate institu

hits a Stanford team had to face as
ungentlemanly a crowd down in
Ihe land of Troy, as did the Trojan
cagers perform before last week
end in the Farm's own Pavilion.
The students of good old Stan
ford I". have lately acquired a bad
Jiabit of booing the officials —no
matter how good or bad they might
he. There tnay well have been
ause for protests in the Cal series
Opener two weeks ago, when Blind
Bill Hollander called decisions with
his eyes closed.
But the Trojan game offered
no such alibi for an unsports
manlike demonstration. True,
the officials may have been a
little strict yet they were ab
solutely fair and none of the
penalties were one-sided boners.
And last. Saturday, the squawk
ing spectators were not satisfied
with sneering at the officials. They
went a step farther, and jeered t lie?
visiting players.
When Stanford men had free
throws (they shouldn't have
even tried to shoot them), the
house was as quiet as a mouse
hole. But if U.S.C. was on the
tossing end of a penalty, the
Pavilion degenerated into a
bedlam.
AVhich, on one occasion, led the
Trojan shooter to appeal to the
referee for silence —as foul-shoot
ing in a close game is no less than
nerve-wracking. At once, the Farm
funs retaliated with hisses and
more hisses.
Well, all one can say is that
said retaliation was rotten to
the core; even granted that the
Trojan foul-flipper was over
temperamental !
There appear to he more razz
berries stored up for the near fu
-lure, sad to say, as Blind Bill Hol
lander has failed to used discre

two remaining Cal series tilts.

temperamental !
There appear to he more razz
berries stored up for the near fu
-lure, sad to say, as Blind Bill Hol
lander has failed to used discre
tion. Unless the unexpected hap
pens, Blind Bill will referee the
two remaining Cal series tilts.
In a recent letter to Coach H.
Hunt, Blind Bill wrote that he
didn't think the Farm rooters were
so bad. And added that he didn't
think he did such a bad job of
officiating, either.
He concluded with: "The booing
of the crowd at the Santa Clara-
Y.M.I. game (which Blind Bill
worked two days after the Cal
spectacle) Avas much worse."
We take it that it was just
another one of Blind Bill's
"good" nights!
So all we can do is to hope
that he has one of his "bad"
evenings up at the Oakland
Auditorium this coming week
end. And that the Stanford
rooters snap out of it along
with Coach H. Hunt's players!
