# Dyer Plays Bridge, Gets Heart Throbs, Bids Seven

Even Milton Work or Sidney
Lenz couldn't have played the
bridge hand Her Dyer picked up
yesterday any better than did that
well-known track star. Dyer, who
seldom plays cards, picked up his
hand, bid seven hearts, and calmly
laid down thirteen little valentines.
