# BALANCED TRACK SQUAD REVEALED IN FRIDAY RACES
## Hables Noses Out Dyer in Sprints; Butler in Long Jump 
### Dy Ted DeMotte 
Under the handicap of chilly
weather and occasional breezes,
Coach Dink Templeton's varsity
and freshman track teams engaged
in a meet. Friday afternoon which
lacked any startling performances,
but which nevertheless showed
plenty of balance and potential
strength.
Outstanding in the races were
the pair of defeats handed Hec
Dyer by Les Hables in the 100-
and 200-yard dashes. Hables came
from behind in both races to nip
Dyer at. the tape. The 100 was run
against a breeze in the slow time
of 10 2-5 seconds, while Hables
took the 220 in 22 1-5 seconds.
Giberson, sophomore, showed class
in nosing Dyer out lor second in
the 100, and taking fourth place
in the 220 behind Hables, Dyer,
and Morrison.
Morrison Wins 440
Morrison ran a pretty rac'e to
win the 440 in 01 2-5 seconds with
Shove, Hubbard, and the freshman,
Eastman, following in close order.
Atkinson came from behind to win
the 880 in 2 minutes 2 1-5 seconds
with Pullenwider, a freshman, a
close second.
A threatened duel in th'e hurdles
failed to materialize when Podge
Smith did not. compete in either
barrier event. Nisbet took both
hurdles, the highs in 15 4-5 sec
onds, and the lows in 25 flat. What
ever breeze there was at. the time
was against the runners. Alden
Herbert, freshman, took his heats
in the hurdle events in 17 1-5 for
the highs and 2(5 flat for the lows.
Bob Brown ran his best, race so
far in the two-mile in 10 minutes
23 seconds. He was forced to set
the pace for most of the distance
and had little opposition. Wright
did not run the mile, but Storms
had 100 much for Parker and won
in 4:37 1-5 in a fast finish. Parker
was plainly in poor condition.
Krenz Throws 149 Feet
Most encouraging in the field
events was the showing of Butler,
sophomore, in the broad-jump. His
leap of 23 feet 5U inches barely
took first from Arnie West, who
jumped 23 feet 5 inches. Dowell
was not in shape, and failed to make
23 feet. Krenz won the shot Without
straining himself at 48 feet 7 J ,<2
inches, followed by Laborde with
45 feet even. George Grey, sopho
more, tossed the shot 44 feet. 11
inches to take third, with Nelson
Gray, freshman, fourth with a good
heave of 44 feet 9 inches.
Krenz threw the discus 119 feet
2 inches, which would be a start
ling performance for anyone but
Krenz. Laborde took second with
139 feet even â€”a good indication
that Ding is to have a discus cham
pion for a few more years.
