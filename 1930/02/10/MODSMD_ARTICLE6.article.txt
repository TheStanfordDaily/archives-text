The Fourth Eclogue, one of Vir
gil's minor poems, is a prophecy,
| quoted ostensibly from the Sibyl
of Cumae, of the coming of a new
i age in which the sorrow and sin!
lof the old will be no more. This J
regeneration of the world is de-j
j scribed as taking place in progres- ;
sive stages corresponding to the j
birth, youth, and manhood of a j
babe who, addressed as the off- |
spring of God, is to be born at J
practically the same time as the j
' new world-period, and will as a
j man rule the world in peace.* 1
The lecture attempts to digest
