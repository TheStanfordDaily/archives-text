j the new state law covering aid to ■
! the needy aged was effective, i
'brought 1670, applications to the i
j slate department of social welfare, |
: it was. shown in a report issued by j
• Miss Edna DeTurbeville, in charge I
of this work. Of the total, U27 tip- j
plications have been approved and
j eight denied.
| At least 2000 more applications
i were expected to reach the depart
j incut during February, and those
I in charge of the work • declared it
might be three months before the
peak of the flood of applications
j was passed.
January's applications were, re
| eeived from lid counties. The larger
counties have not sent in their ap
plications, because local investiga
tions have not been completed due
to the large number of cases, it
was said here.
Approximately 400 applications
were returned by the state depart
ment to county authorities because
! of incomplete data, Miss DeTurbe
ville said. In the cases of some ap
-1 plicants, she pointed out, proof of
age was difficult to establish.
Reports of applications for state
aid are to be issued monthly from
the department here, it was an
nounced, and at the end of the first
! year of operation of the law ac
curate knowledge of the extent of
i old age dependency in California
! is expected to be fully known for j
• the first tirme. This will be the
| first complete state-wide survey of
this subject made in the United
i States, Miss DeTurbeville said.
