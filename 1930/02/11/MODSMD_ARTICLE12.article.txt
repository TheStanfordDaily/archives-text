# HUGE FISH IS HOOKED BY HOOVER
## First Day's Prize Whopper Is Seven Feet Long, Weighs 45 Pounds 
### 
LONG KEY, I'la., Feb. 10 (/-P). A
huge sail fish, seven feet long and
weighing forty-five pounds, stood to
President Hoover's credit in this little
fishing camp tonight as a result of his
first day of deep sea fishing off the
shores of the Florida Keys.
Justice Harlan F. Stone, one of his
fishing companions, reported that he
had hooked a sail fish, which lie be
lieved to be larger than the Presi
dent's, but that a shark had taken it
off his line before he could land it.
There were some dissenting opinions
in the camp, particularly concerning
that part of the story regarding the
hungry shark.
Other members of the party who
fished, including Lawrence Ridley,
Dr. Vernon Kellogg, and Mark Sul
livan, newspaper man and writer,
failed to get a strike. The haul for the
whole camp totaled five sail fish, in ad
dition to the President's, and two bar
racudas.
