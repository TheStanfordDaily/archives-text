## 
### 
"Communism hasn't a dog's chance
in C hina," Dr. Allan A- Hunter, world
traveler, lecturer, minister, and leader
of a three-day student conference on
"Modern Trends in Religious
Thought" being held on the campus,
said in an interview to a Daily report
er last evening. "It's absurd to worry
about it."
"I was talking with Bodin, fore
most leader in China, one day. lie
remarked, 'We communists are on the
train. We hope to go through to the
terminal. The Chinese may get off at
station one or station two, but we
have no illusions.' Russia is merely
trying to get what she can out of
China, like all the rest. Of course,
nobody knows."
Dr. Hunter spent a number Â«>I years
in the Orient where he taught at the
National Normal University, a gov
ernment school, and at Canton. In
I'->25 lie was secretary for the bar Mast
of the Fellowship of Youth for Peace.
Dr. Hunter is also author of "Facing
the Pacific," a treatise on international
relations of the Pacific Basin.
"Christianity is merely strengthened
by its opposition," he remarked. "The
recent conflict with communism has
merely dropped off the hangers-on. It
is slowl\ gaining ground."
"Dr. Sun Yat Sen, with whom I
talked some years ago, appeared quite
sympathetic with Christianity, all ru
mors to the contrary. I see no reason
why he should not be. He owes much
to it, including his religion."
Dr. Hunter, when asked about the
Filipino riots in this country, called
them absurd. "We import these men
to exploit them," he remarked. "We
do not bring them women. These
riots are utterly uncalled for."
Dr. Hunter will lead the next dis
cussion of the conference. It will be
ill the Y.M.C.A. lobby at 4 :.Ml o'clock
tonight. All interested are invited to
attend the discussion, which will con
tinue to deal with the student and
modern trends in religion.
