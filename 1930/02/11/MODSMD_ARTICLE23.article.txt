# VALUABLE COLLECTION OF HUNGARIAN DATA RECEIVED BY HOOVER WAR LIBRARY
## Books, Pamphlets Cover Communist Regime of 1919; Purchase Arranged for in Europe by Harold H. Fisher, Library Director 
### 
Representing the mo.->t outstanding collection of material on the Great
War that the Hoover War Library has received in recent years is that of
Julius tie Czibor, Hungarian scholar of Iludapest. Negotiations for its pur
chase have been going on for some time, and it was finally through the efforts
of Mr. Harold H. Fisher, a director of the library, that the linal acquisition
was made in 1929 when he went to Furo'pc for that purpose.
The collection itself contains some 650 books and pamphlets, almost en
tirely on the Hungarian Communist regime of July 1919, and eight news-

lilo representing all of the im
portant political parties in Hungary,
as well as the official journal of Buda
pest it-ell' for the period from 1913 to
I'JIH. "'1 his is inuloubtcdly the rarest
, collection of the Bela Run period, and
probably the only one in existence out
side of Hungary," Professor Lutz
said.
This nmst complete and impressive
group will prove a great aid to the
research project on the Hungarian
Revolution now heing carried on by
the history department here at Stan
ford.
"It is, without doubt, the greatest
addition to the already impressive col
lection on communism in Hungary
I that the Library has yet acquired,"
said Lutz. "We have been collecting a
fine group of posters and leaflets
throughout the past ten years." Pro
fessor Lutz himself was instrumental
in obtaining much of this material. It
will be recalled that the first collec
tion made by him was seized by the
police because of its Bolshevist con
i tent, and with great difficulty was fi
nally gotten into this country.
Funds for the purchase were pro
vided for by an anonymous friend of
the Librarv.
