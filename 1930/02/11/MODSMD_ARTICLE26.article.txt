## 
### Stewart Crawford 
j "Perhaps comparatively few per
sons understand the connection be
-1 tween the poet Virgil and the pres
ent celebration of Christmas," said
j Professor Marbnry I?. Ogle, whose
1 Tuesday evening lecture will deal
I with "Virgil's Prophecy of a Mes
i siahâ€”the Fourth Eclogue."
In discussing Virgil's poem, Pro
cessor Ogle pointed out that it was
j probably written about the festival
of the sun god. which was eeie
j brated on December 24 and 2f>
j throughout the civilized world for
centuries before the birth of
i Christ. The poem deals with the
same set of ideas that is set forth
in the Christian story of the pro
phecy of the Saviour, and since it
I was written long before the birth
| of Christ, the similarity of the
| language of Virgil's prophecy to
[the prophecies of the Old Testa
ment led the early Christians to
see Virgil as an inspired prophet
of Christ.
"It is an interesting fact that the
celebration of the birth of the sun

god 011 December 25 when the days
begun to grow longer was the ori
gin of our present Christmas," he
continued, "since the date had long
been n pagan celebration of great
popularity. The Christians with
their new religion saw the pagan
affair as an ideal date to use for
their purpose of celebrating the
birth of Christ, so they applied it
to the story of the SaViour, offi
cially establishing the date abou'
the fourth century."
Professor Ogle in his lecture
Tuesday evening will try to trace
the appearance in the ancient
world of the Saviour idea. "It evi
dently originated among the Orien
tals long before the time of Vir
gil." he said.
Instant and world-wide response
lias followed the announcement of
Italy that this year will be cele
brated as the two-thousandth anni
versary of the birth of Virgil, ac
cording to Professor Ogle, and in
our country there is a general com
mittee with headquarters in New
York who lias charge of the move
ment. In many of the Eastern
states the governors have appoint
ed committees of leaders in educa
tion and business to have charge
of the celebration.
"The object of (lie movement is
to further study of Virgil," lie con
cluded, "to further understanding
of what he has contributed to hu
manity."
Professor Ogle, who is acting pro
fessor of classical literature here
for the winter quarter, is chairman
of the department of classical lan
guages at Ohio State University,
and litis written several articles
dealing with Virgil and with classi
cal and medieval literature.
