Today is election time on the Farm.
The Daily will refrain from its traditional exhortation to stim-:
nlate student voting. Whether students choose to vote or not to!
vote is. after all. a matter for their own concern.
I hit it might he well for these same students to hear in mind
the fact that in times past there have been A.S.S.I . officers who ■
were none too satisfactory in the discharge of their duties.
And when a political blank is drawn by this process the"voters"
of the campus are not backward in voicing their displeasure.
It's an old, old story. Those worthies who sit twiddling thumbs j
while others are casting votes complain in the loudest tones when ;
some fair-haired choice of the people turns out to be a dud.
Theoreticallv, Stanford's system of student government is good.
... ' .
\nd actually it has been fairly successful.
It can be made more successful, however, by a general partici-]
pat ion in the balloting. Only by such means will student govern-'
ment become something real. That is a truism, but il is applicable
l it re.
lie who doesn't vote will do well to hold bis peace.
