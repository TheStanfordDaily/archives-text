# FROSH FAVORED TO CAPTURE TONIGHT'S BRONCO ENCOUNTER
## 
### 
I'laying tin; preliminary game
before the varsity meets Santa
Clara in the Pavilion tonight, the
Card frosh quintet will take the
floor at f>:4s to tangle with the
Santa Clara yearlings.
The visitors will have a husky
bunch of players, among them
Siavifh and Red Smith, two former
(Jalileo High School stars, who
played sterling football for the
Santa Clarans last fall. Slavich is
the fellow who caught the pass
that beat the Card babes on the
gridiron last sason, and if his foot
loll ability is an indication of his
basketball prowess, the Stanford
frosh will have to keep their eyes
on him tonight. Coach Uradshaw
saw the Santa Clara outfit in ac
tion but Was not much impressed.
