# WEST MUST MEET THE EAST
## 
### 
Recent disturbances along the Pacific rim of the I'nitcd States
involving white and Filipino citizens indicate that the supposedly
civilized i>eople of the western world have not traveled so far
from the culture of the .Filipinos whose head-hunting ancestors
lurk just bevond the horizon. I'revious clashes on the Pacific coast
with the Chinese and Japanese, coupled with the Filipino riots,
clearly demonstrate that careful thought must be centered around
the Pacific basin in the next decade if Fast and West are to remain
on friendly terms.
At the present time the advantage lies with the Western powers
because of commercial and industrial supremacy. The myth of
Nordic mental supremacy has been exploded by the rapid rise of
those ( )rientals who have chosen to compete with the white man
on his own ground. Thus, even while the Occident retains the
resources of the world on its side of the scales, the potential power
of teeming millions in the Fast makes a factor which cannot be
denied if the two racial groups refuse to see the necessity of co
operation and choose conflict instead.
The present generation has seen the futility of conflict, but to
ihc generations of the future the colors in the picture of horror
and waste, painted between I' > 14 and will gradually fade and
bitter experience will have to be substituted once more for percep
tion unless means for training in international co-operation are
provided.
The Institute of Pacific Relations is doing much to prevent
misunderstanding in this region, to which the commercial and
political center of the world is rapidly shifting. I Wit the discussion
of Pacific problems by the leaders of the two cultures is not
enough. Such (fiscussion will not prevent the recurrence of the
economic and social conflict which frequently flares up on the
shores of the Pacific. If something is not done, the emotional reac
tions of the untrained masses will sweep the leaders into the mael
strom of race hatred, and history will again repeat itself.
Stanford's President has taken a leading position in the dis
cussion of the problems of the Pacific, but the interest has not
permeated the student group. The I'niversity's Education Depart
ment could do much in the way of training teachers in the methods
of giving instruction on international co-operation. The department
is in the fortunate position of having numbers of prospective teach
ers from both races in its classes, students who will be able to work
with the generations which are to come on both sides of the sea
which divides Fast from West. If the heads of the department
took a decided stand in the matter they could in time bring about
proper instruction in the entire West in both state and private
schools, and contribute much to initiating such training in the
schools of China and Japan.

with the generations which are to come on both sides of the sea
which divides Fast from West. If the heads of the department
took a decided stand in the matter they could in time bring about
proper instruction in the entire West in both state and private
schools, and contribute much to initiating such training in the
schools of China and Japan.
Recent disturbances along the Pacific rim of the I'nitcd States
involving white and Filipino citizens indicate that the supposedly
civilized i>eople of the western world have not traveled so far
from the culture of the .Filipinos whose head-hunting ancestors
lurk just bevond the horizon. I'revious clashes on the Pacific coast
with the Chinese and Japanese, coupled with the Filipino riots,
clearly demonstrate that careful thought must be centered around
the Pacific basin in the next decade if Fast and West are to remain
on friendly terms.
At the present time the advantage lies with the Western powers
because of commercial and industrial supremacy. The myth of
Nordic mental supremacy has been exploded by the rapid rise of
those ( )rientals who have chosen to compete with the white man
on his own ground. Thus, even while the Occident retains the
resources of the world on its side of the scales, the potential power
of teeming millions in the Fast makes a factor which cannot be
denied if the two racial groups refuse to see the necessity of co
operation and choose conflict instead.
The present generation has seen the futility of conflict, but to
ihc generations of the future the colors in the picture of horror
and waste, painted between I' > 14 and will gradually fade and
bitter experience will have to be substituted once more for percep
tion unless means for training in international co-operation are
provided.
The Institute of Pacific Relations is doing much to prevent
misunderstanding in this region, to which the commercial and
political center of the world is rapidly shifting. I Wit the discussion
of Pacific problems by the leaders of the two cultures is not
enough. Such (fiscussion will not prevent the recurrence of the
economic and social conflict which frequently flares up on the
shores of the Pacific. If something is not done, the emotional reac
tions of the untrained masses will sweep the leaders into the mael
strom of race hatred, and history will again repeat itself.
Stanford's President has taken a leading position in the dis
cussion of the problems of the Pacific, but the interest has not
permeated the student group. The I'niversity's Education Depart
ment could do much in the way of training teachers in the methods
of giving instruction on international co-operation. The department
is in the fortunate position of having numbers of prospective teach
ers from both races in its classes, students who will be able to work
with the generations which are to come on both sides of the sea
which divides Fast from West. If the heads of the department
