## 
### 
\ssociated Press dispatches from Chicago bring the news that
\merica's second city has $1X5,393,282 on the dehit side of its
ledgers—a colossal sum even for a huge municipality.
Word comes, also, that the guns of Chicago's gangland have
taken a toll of a dozen murders in ten days. I'ombings, robberies,
and all manner of crimes against society have been recurrent.
And now Chicago is aroused by this reign of "hoodlum sav
agery." Almost a thousand denizens of the underworld have been
temporarily placed behind the bars.
People wonder how all this came to happen.
The answer is easy. As long as men and women elevate clowns
to important positions: as long as men and women listen to political
gibberish of the William Male Thompson variety; as long as men
and women suffer the workings of "the machine"; as long as these
things e.\i>l there will be graft and corruption and crime.
