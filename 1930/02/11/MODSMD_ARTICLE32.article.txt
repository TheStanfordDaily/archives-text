FROM A HARVARD NOTEBOOK.
By Thomas W. Duncan. Des
Moines: The MairelancJ Press.
1929.
That so slight a volume should
havetlie amount of beauty pressed
between its covers as does this
book of poems written by a boy
just out of college, seems in
credible.
Thomas W. Duncan, the author,
is new in literary fields. Whether
he is only another youthful meteor
cannot be said, but this much is
certain: to anyone who has an ear
that appreciates pure melody of
words, and a spirit t Mat responds
to delicate imagery, "Prom a Har
vard Notebook" will be a source of
extraordinary delight.
There are only half a dozen or
so poems, and none of them are
long. But as often happens, length
here is no criterion. Each page has
an intangible loveliness, whose ef
fect grows on the reader with
every line. The greatest charm of
Duncan's work is its youth; but
with the ardency and swift inten
sity of feeling that belongs to
youthfulness a rare quality is com
bined: refinement of diction.
Tt is this deep element of refine
ment that lifts the poems out of
the plane of ordinary young poets'
efforts. Even in verses where the
thought is bitter, poignant, or
exuberant, there is always present
a certain reserve which heightens
rather than detracts from their
power.
Earnest young poets too often
exaggerate. Duncan is sincere to
a degree that precludes any sus
picion of his writing for effect. He
has neither the objectionable over
lastidiousness of youthful poetry
nor the unskilled realism so often

] attempted by embryo poets. He i
idealizes Harvard because he loves
it, yet he does this with an artistry (
that makes the sympathetic pic
tures which he gives of the uni
versity and of its student lite seem
of as high value to you as they do
to him. "From a Harvard Note
hook" should attract enough at
tention to necessitate further edi
! tions being printed. It is real
poetry. —M. L. R.
APPLAUSE—At the Varsity.
You may not be able to paint a
h< use with applesauce but smear it
! on it strip of celluloid and you can
make a movie. The plot of t his
.story is as mushy as fruit butter, 1
but somehow it doesn't impress you
that way. The directing is good.
Perhaps that's why you don't feel
sticky when you leave the theatre.
The extrawdinary tale is the j
morbid recital of how Helen Mor
gan gave her youth, beauty, and
happiness for applause. Of course
j she conies to a hittah end but her
| little gal marries a sailor and goes
] back to Wisconsin. Tommy-rot of
! course, but. it doesn't matter so
much what's done and how it's
done.
Helen Morgan is regenerated. Of
course she isn't a Sarah Bernhardt i
or a La Duse but then she's good. ,
Her role is a heavy one that could*
easily topple but Helen carries it ■
magnificently. Joan Pierce, a new
comer, is good, too. We forget the i
rest of the actors but they aren't
bad enough to mention anyway.
! Oldtimers may not recognize the !
Helen of old. In this picture she
swapped her Irene Bordoni hair
cut. for a frowsy blond wig. And
she doesn't sit on the piano once.
Oh yes, there is a Micky Mouse
' comedy. —B. P.
