# Campus Opinion
## FEELS PUBLIC OPINION SHOULD END CHEATING 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
One of (lie oldest and most cher
ished student traditions is the
| Stanford Honor Code. The recent
I action of the Honor Code Commit
tee and the Executive Committee
in allowing such a move as that of
optional proctors during examina
tions shows, to my mind, an utter
lack of understanding of the inte
gral part the Honor Code has
played in student life since it was
instituted on this campus. It is in
grained in Stanford.
I The motto "let the winds of free
dom blow" certainly belies the
: position that such a thing as proc
j tors in examinations is compatible
with the democracy tliis t'niversity
stands for. To have a group of
gum - shoeing, suspicious - minded
proctors sneaking up and down the
I aisles during examinations, is to
my way of thinking, completely re
l pulsive and repugnant to all real
1 Stanford men and women. Even in
the seventh and eighth grades of
| grammar school, the Honor Code
, is used. Is Stanford to retrogress
simply because some students DO
j CHEAT?
There are some men and women
at Stanford who say: "I feel that
it is a personal matter, and if 1
1 want to cheat, I will." To anyone
who follows campus affairs at all,
lit is clear that last year cheating
was shown conclusively to be a
j SOCIAL problem and not an indi
vidual one. It affects a whole group
when one person cheats —as well
' as the individual's integrity—and
I it therefore lies in the group at
large to remedy the situation.
This may sound indefinite and
ideal to many of the more practical
minded students around tlie Farm,
i but the force of public opinion is
more powerful, once it is roused,
than any other. And there surely
are enough red-blooded and honest
minded Stanford men and women
around this University to frankly

■ express their convictions that !
cheating is a despicable habit —
and to put cheaters in their proper j
places—out of the University cate
gory completely.
Stanford doesn't need any proc
tors to do this. In fact proctors
will only aggravate the situation
as they wilT cause the honest stu
dents to become very righteously
indignant, the professors who use
t lie "optional" power of asking for
them to become unpopularly known
as those who suspect students, and i
who in the world would ever be a
proctor under such a system? Sure- 1
lv no real Stanford man would so
subsidize his own honor, intelli
gence, and character to WATCH
for cheating among his own friends
and fellow-students.
The whole remedy lies in the
casting out of a certain social fear
which permeates the whole student. -
body.. Those WHO BELIEVE that
some of their own friends OUGHT
NOT to cheat are AFRAID TO
SAY SO. Let. the leaders of the
| student, body—the morally coura-!
; geous—come out and frankly show
j their righteous indignation that
( heating goes on and let those who
would stoop to cheating KNOW
THAT IT IS PRESENTED—and in
almost no time, a little more
studying will be done and tlie ne
i cessity for cheating will disappear.
! For it is mostly the half-prepared
students who do the cheating.
So let's not think of compromis
ing Stanford's own integrity by
instituting a system of espionage,
i by admitting to the world at large
' that there are more vicious-minded
: students here than there are st.u
-i dents who believe in HONOR and
j FAIRNESS, and shooting straight
with professors and themselves —
and let every loyal man and woman !
j of Stanford University tear away
i the clouds of mental tear and PUT
i CHEATING IN ITS PLACE—at the
bottom of Stanford's intellectual
j castes. —A Real Stanfordite.

j CHEAT?
There are some men and women
at Stanford who say: "I feel that
it is a personal matter, and if 1
1 want to cheat, I will." To anyone
who follows campus affairs at all,
lit is clear that last year cheating
was shown conclusively to be a
j SOCIAL problem and not an indi
vidual one. It affects a whole group
when one person cheats —as well
' as the individual's integrity—and
I it therefore lies in the group at
large to remedy the situation.
This may sound indefinite and
ideal to many of the more practical
minded students around tlie Farm,
i but the force of public opinion is
more powerful, once it is roused,
than any other. And there surely
are enough red-blooded and honest
minded Stanford men and women
around this University to frankly

■ express their convictions that !
cheating is a despicable habit —
and to put cheaters in their proper j
places—out of the University cate
gory completely.
Stanford doesn't need any proc
tors to do this. In fact proctors
will only aggravate the situation
as they wilT cause the honest stu
dents to become very righteously
indignant, the professors who use
t lie "optional" power of asking for
them to become unpopularly known
as those who suspect students, and i
who in the world would ever be a
proctor under such a system? Sure- 1
lv no real Stanford man would so
subsidize his own honor, intelli
gence, and character to WATCH
for cheating among his own friends
and fellow-students.
The whole remedy lies in the
casting out of a certain social fear
which permeates the whole student. -

I action of the Honor Code Commit

in allowing such a move as that of
optional proctors during examina

I The motto "let the winds of free

stands for. To have a group of

proctors sneaking up and down the

my way of thinking, completely re
