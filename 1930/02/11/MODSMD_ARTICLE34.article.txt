# RAZZING HURTS GOOD NAME OF UNIVERSITY
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Stanford University lost more,
much more, than a basketball same
I tonight. Her good name and reputa
tion were dragged to lower depths
' than can he imagined, and by
"Stanford Students" In brief,
i "Stanford men" demonstrated that
1 tliev were not truly Stanford men
tonight in the Pavilion.
Hell! Another one of those senti
mental appeals! Yet, the truth is
1 that it is high time to fane the
issue. Let us analyze the question.
We have a basketball team which
was "doped" to win quite a few
games, according to pre-season
newspaper reports. This team lias
1 not come tip to those expectations.
Whether the reason for this be the
j coach, game officials, or team mem
bers does not matter. The point
j is that, some "Stanford Students
I have tried to correct the fault at
the expense of the name of Stan
. ford University. I am unable to ad
vance another method of approach
| to the problem (no method could
be worse) but I feel that dishonor
ing the name of our University is
! not the correct one. I am sure I
! am not alone in this view and i
I am sure the "dry balls" are not the
i sole supporters of it. Then, why
do "Stanford Students" stage their
razzherry parties? The answer is
obvious; they are passing the buck.

Public opinion will not blame so
and-so as an individual; it will,
however, blame Stanford as a
whole. Very few will say, "So-and
so is a hell of a sport." A great
majority will say, "Stanford is the
! worst loser I ever saw." Probably
these buck-passers are a small mi
! nority, but such a group is an un
j desired one at Stanford. It does
1 not understand the spirit of our
University and they are not Stan-
I ford men even if they insist on
designating themselves as such.
We all desire victory for our teams
' but if victory with dishonor be the
j only way, we might as well with
draw.
We are very proud of the reputa
l tion and name built up by former
j generations of Stanford men and
I women. Will future Stanford men
I and women be proud of the "good
j old days" of 1930?
Yours sincerely,
"Stanford '31.

I have tried to correct the fault at
the expense of the name of Stan

I am sure the "dry balls" are not the
i sole supporters of it. Then, why
do "Stanford Students" stage their
razzherry parties? The answer is
obvious; they are passing the buck.

Public opinion will not blame so
and-so as an individual; it will,
however, blame Stanford as a
whole. Very few will say, "So-and
so is a hell of a sport." A great
majority will say, "Stanford is the
! worst loser I ever saw." Probably
these buck-passers are a small mi
! nority, but such a group is an un
j desired one at Stanford. It does
1 not understand the spirit of our
University and they are not Stan-
I ford men even if they insist on
designating themselves as such.
We all desire victory for our teams

j only way, we might as well with
draw.
We are very proud of the reputa
l tion and name built up by former

I women. Will future Stanford men
I and women be proud of the "good

The Editor, Sir:
Stanford University lost more,
much more, than a basketball same
I tonight. Her good name and reputa
tion were dragged to lower depths
' than can he imagined, and by
"Stanford Students" In brief,
i "Stanford men" demonstrated that
1 tliev were not truly Stanford men
tonight in the Pavilion.
Hell! Another one of those senti
mental appeals! Yet, the truth is
1 that it is high time to fane the
issue. Let us analyze the question.
We have a basketball team which
was "doped" to win quite a few
games, according to pre-season
newspaper reports. This team lias
1 not come tip to those expectations.
Whether the reason for this be the
j coach, game officials, or team mem
bers does not matter. The point
