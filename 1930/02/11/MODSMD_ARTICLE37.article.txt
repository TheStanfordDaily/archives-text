# CAMPUS KINGS ARE EDUCATIONAL FAILURES
## 
### 
The shingle hound, the key
chaser, tlie athletic grind, and prac
tically every other sort of campus
king are all taken for the usual
sleigh-ride by Henry F. Pringle,
'10, in the current College Humor.
When he winds up his petulant
polemic directed at over-emphasis
of extra-curricular activities, he
has said much that has been said
before, plus something more. The
something more is the meat of his
paper. He pleads for "an added de
gree of self-determination for the
college man."
After banging away at the theory
that the campus king invariably
has an easy time of it after grab
bing up his college degree, a bang
ing that booms along for several
hundred packed lines of type.
Pringle points out the importance
of having sufficient, leisure while
at college, something that usually
eludes the average campus king.
Most freshmen who are in l'ra-

(Cornell Sun Student Editorial)

ternities on this campus and else
wliere, are early in their careers
lined up for various activities
which keep them going at top
speed for four years. Either that,
or they sit back and do nothing.
It is necessary neither to force a
faltering freshman into something
merely to get him going in the
task of plastering the with
a little more glory, nor to ignore
his potential interests entirely.
What seems to escape most con
temporary collegians is that a com
promise between the dilettante and
the campus king is the most sensi
ble and intelligent means for get
ting the goods that lead to a de
gree. If his superiors would indi
cate to the freshman the activities
ot potential interest to him, and
then content themselves with sil
ting back and letting the ignoble
one decide for himself, more men
would approach commencement
with the satisfaction that accom
panies Mr. Pringle's "self-determi
nation." And what is possibly more
important, the post-college disillu
sionment that hits the campus king
between the eyes when left to shift
for himself, would be less acute for
the fellow who has been allowed to
follow his own inclinations while
trotting around the campus.

The shingle hound, the key
chaser, tlie athletic grind, and prac
tically every other sort of campus
king are all taken for the usual
sleigh-ride by Henry F. Pringle,
'10, in the current College Humor.
When he winds up his petulant
polemic directed at over-emphasis
of extra-curricular activities, he
has said much that has been said
before, plus something more. The
something more is the meat of his
paper. He pleads for "an added de
gree of self-determination for the
college man."
After banging away at the theory
that the campus king invariably
has an easy time of it after grab
bing up his college degree, a bang
ing that booms along for several
hundred packed lines of type.
Pringle points out the importance
of having sufficient, leisure while
at college, something that usually
eludes the average campus king.
Most freshmen who are in l'ra-

ternities on this campus and else
wliere, are early in their careers
lined up for various activities
which keep them going at top
speed for four years. Either that,
or they sit back and do nothing.
It is necessary neither to force a
faltering freshman into something
merely to get him going in the
task of plastering the with
a little more glory, nor to ignore
his potential interests entirely.
What seems to escape most con
temporary collegians is that a com
promise between the dilettante and
the campus king is the most sensi
ble and intelligent means for get
ting the goods that lead to a de
gree. If his superiors would indi
cate to the freshman the activities
ot potential interest to him, and
then content themselves with sil
ting back and letting the ignoble
one decide for himself, more men
would approach commencement
with the satisfaction that accom
panies Mr. Pringle's "self-determi
nation." And what is possibly more
important, the post-college disillu
sionment that hits the campus king
between the eyes when left to shift
for himself, would be less acute for
the fellow who has been allowed to
follow his own inclinations while
trotting around the campus.
