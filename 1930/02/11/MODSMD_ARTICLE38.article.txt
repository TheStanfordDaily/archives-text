## 
### 
"No other than the laughing:,
happy Pierrot of legend is what I
sometime* think the real cliarae
ter of Lawrence Tibbett is," said
Maude T. Howell, MO, who is pres
ent stage manager of George Arliss
and who directed Tibbett when
she was head of the dramatics de
partment of Manual Arts
School in Los Angeles, where he
attended school.
"He had a keen zest for living
and was always an enthusiast,
popular with all types and con
sidered an aii-round man," she con
tinued. in her communication spe
cial to the Daily. "He is a magnifi
cent swimmer."
Tibbett, Metropolitan Opera bari
tone, is to sing at Stanford next
Monday on the A.S.S.U. concert
series. Tickets are on sale at $1.
$1.50, and $2 at t lie A.S.S.TT. office
in the Old Union and at Dodson's
in Palo Alto.
Of the parts lie played in high
schools, especially in Mary Aus
tin's,* "The Indian Maker," she
says:
"I have never known an amateur
performer who could so quickly
■grasp the truth of a part, vitaliz
ing it with a sureness that bespoke
true genius.
"He also played the clown in
'The Maker of Dreams,' by Downs.
II was a romping, lilting part that
suited his boyish, happy nature. As
usual lie sang the bits of poetry —
quaint, curious bits of philosophy
which the part of the clown de
manded —and lie caroled them with
such abandon that. 1 believed ho
must be a real Pierrot.
"The years have rolled by since
those days—hard work and study
for ini -grim days of war have in
tervened, but whenever I see him
again here is the same enthusiast.
Time lias not changed the essential
qualities but has broadened him
immensely. I beiieve here is genius
both in'acting and singing. And
Pierrot isn't crying for the moon
any more, but sitting on if quite
serenely and pinning the stars on
his own breast."
