SHOT OR HOT?
Stanford's truck supremacy in
just about shot. Wobbling on its
last logs right now, nothing will
bo 101 l but an empty shell to show
lor iho Kami's past glory on the
rniih ipatli, when ibis year's crop
■ lur performers grab off their
: liflopskins in spring.
Last year the Cards were
sitting on top of the world.
But graduation took a most
heavy toll, and from all pre
season indications, the Farm
track team of 1930 will be
nipped at the tape on at least
one occasion—if Dean Crom
well's verbal attack bears any
weight.
How can Mr. Robert L. Temple
tou possibly keep his sunny side
up after (his .June's diploma mati
nee, with such men as Eric Apollo
Krenz, Koot-A-Woek Itothert, Virg
Howell, Cedrie Madison, and Long
.lolin Morrison deserting the oval
for the boudhouse Held ?
There's only one answer,
which, strange as it may seem,
is THE CLASS OF '33. For
the freshman track squad
looms up strongest in those
events which will be hardest
hit in June.
Take the strong man prospects,
for example. Mr. Templeton loses
Krenz and Kothert, to be sure. But
coming up from the yearling squad
will be that potent pair, Here La-
Morde and Nelson Gray.
Both of these youngsters will
be putting the shot anywheres
from 48 to 50 feet before the
present season is ended, while
Lnßorde will be flippnig the
discus out around the 150-foot
mark. At least, Mr. Templeton
has such a hunch.
The other big hole to he filled is
Long John Morrison's place in the
quarter mile and relay. Long John
will do around 4S Hat by the time
the U.S.C. meet conies along, pro
vided his lower limbs hold up.
Here again the CLASS OF '33
comes to the fore with one Ben
Hangs Eastman, from Menlo
School, who booms around the
oval with natural agility.
In the Mural meet, two
weeks ago, this slabsided lad
finished two steps behind Les
Hables, who set a new record
at 49 and four-fifths seconds.
Which means that Ben Bangs
covered the one lap in not
more than 50 flat.
Hables ran a beautiful race,
but to young Eastman goes the
real credit of pushing the win
ner to a new record!
With more experience Ben Bangs
might have even stretched his legs
over the line first, as he is as green
as they come and has not yet
learned how to judge his pace. He
has an excellent build for a 440
champ, though his lower limbs are
si ill too skinny to stand much cin
der pounding. When he fills out a
hit, as he will in another year, Ben
Bangs will be unbeatable.
In fact, Mr. Templeton thinks
that he is the best-looking quarter
mile prospect that ever entered
Stanford IT. Which augurs well —
with Spencer, Miller, Story, Bab
eock, and Morrison as his prede
(dssors.
At any rate, Stanford's down
fall to date has consisted of
mere guffaws and the optimis
tic cackling of opposing
coaches. Although Mr. Robert
L. Templeton is no wizard, he
is one of the best mentors in
the land, and if he gets the
breaks and the material, the
Farm citizens need not be
downcast. For "Dink" has a
knack and a habit of develop
ing mediocre-appearing men
into champion contenders!

the U.S.C. meet conies along, pro
vided his lower limbs hold up.
Here again the CLASS OF '33
comes to the fore with one Ben
Hangs Eastman, from Menlo
School, who booms around the
oval with natural agility.
In the Mural meet, two
weeks ago, this slabsided lad
finished two steps behind Les
Hables, who set a new record
at 49 and four-fifths seconds.
Which means that Ben Bangs
covered the one lap in not
more than 50 flat.
Hables ran a beautiful race,
but to young Eastman goes the
real credit of pushing the win
ner to a new record!
With more experience Ben Bangs
might have even stretched his legs
over the line first, as he is as green
as they come and has not yet
learned how to judge his pace. He
has an excellent build for a 440
champ, though his lower limbs are
si ill too skinny to stand much cin
der pounding. When he fills out a
hit, as he will in another year, Ben
Bangs will be unbeatable.
In fact, Mr. Templeton thinks
that he is the best-looking quarter
mile prospect that ever entered
Stanford IT. Which augurs well —
with Spencer, Miller, Story, Bab
eock, and Morrison as his prede
(dssors.
At any rate, Stanford's down
fall to date has consisted of
mere guffaws and the optimis
tic cackling of opposing
coaches. Although Mr. Robert
L. Templeton is no wizard, he
is one of the best mentors in
the land, and if he gets the
breaks and the material, the
Farm citizens need not be
downcast. For "Dink" has a
knack and a habit of develop
ing mediocre-appearing men
into champion contenders!

SHOT OR HOT?
Stanford's truck supremacy in
just about shot. Wobbling on its
last logs right now, nothing will
bo 101 l but an empty shell to show
lor iho Kami's past glory on the
rniih ipatli, when ibis year's crop
■ lur performers grab off their
: liflopskins in spring.
Last year the Cards were
sitting on top of the world.
But graduation took a most
heavy toll, and from all pre
season indications, the Farm
track team of 1930 will be
nipped at the tape on at least
one occasion—if Dean Crom
well's verbal attack bears any
weight.
How can Mr. Robert L. Temple
tou possibly keep his sunny side
up after (his .June's diploma mati
nee, with such men as Eric Apollo
Krenz, Koot-A-Woek Itothert, Virg
Howell, Cedrie Madison, and Long
.lolin Morrison deserting the oval
for the boudhouse Held ?
There's only one answer,
which, strange as it may seem,
is THE CLASS OF '33. For
the freshman track squad
looms up strongest in those
events which will be hardest
hit in June.
Take the strong man prospects,
for example. Mr. Templeton loses
Krenz and Kothert, to be sure. But
coming up from the yearling squad
will be that potent pair, Here La-
Morde and Nelson Gray.
Both of these youngsters will
be putting the shot anywheres
from 48 to 50 feet before the
present season is ended, while
Lnßorde will be flippnig the
discus out around the 150-foot
mark. At least, Mr. Templeton
has such a hunch.
The other big hole to he filled is
Long John Morrison's place in the
quarter mile and relay. Long John
will do around 4S Hat by the time
the U.S.C. meet conies along, pro
vided his lower limbs hold up.
