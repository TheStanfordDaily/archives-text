# Bronco Cagers Out To Avenge Defeat Tonight
## MISSION HOOPMEN POINT FOR CARDS; PROMISE THRILLS Blind Bill Hollander Will Referee Tilt; Teams Are Big Rivals 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Invading the Farm to avenge
In si year's defeat at the hands of
the Cards, Santa Clara is sched
uled to tangle with Coach Husky
Hunt's varsity capers on the cam
pus hardwood at eight o'clock this
evening.
The Mission players have been
pointing for the Stanford engage
ment all season, as last winter's
upset was a most hitter one, the
Cards coining from behind in the
last minute of play to win out by a
score of 28 to 27 after Santa Clara
had apparently cinched the tilt
with a 13-point lead.
Consequently tonight's game
should provide plenty of thrills for
the cash customers, for outside of
the fact that Blind Bill Hollander
will be out on the floor with his
tin whistle, the two teams are na
tural rivals. Hunt's lads must come
out .on top to keep their season
from being a complete Hop, while a
defeat will put the Cards at a
psychological disadvantage for the j
decisive Cal court battle on Splur- I
day night.
Squads on Even Terms
The two squads will be on prac- ;
tically even terms when they take j
tlie floor, as both have absorbed j
more than their just share of the j
bumps this winter. Santa Clara i
holds a close victory over Cal, but j
dropped a 27 to 17 contest to St. !
Ignatius two weeks ago. On the i
other hand, Stanford trounced the
Gray Fog outfit and fell an easy '
prey before the Bears in the Big ]
Series opener.
With four of last year's veterans
back, the Broncos were doped to
clean up before the season got
under way, but like the Cards, have
yet failed to function with any sort
of regularity. Jack Cough, captain,
plays an outstanding game.at for- !
ward, being high-scorer for the
Drones in nearly every game to
date. Tim Connolly, at center, is ,
the other big cog in Santa Clara's j
attack and expects to get a ma- i
jority of the tip-offs this evening.
Regular Lineup
In an effort to check the Mission ,
offense, Hunt has decided to start j
his regular lineup, with Mike Rey- j
nolds and Captain Rothert at i
guard, and Don Tyler paired with
Red Berg at forward. Long John ,
McCandless will hold down the i
pivot position as usual.
Long John had another off night i
against the Trojans lust Saturday,
nd the Card mentor figures that
he is about due to tap in baskets I
with regularity once more. Tyler, ;
who is bothered with a bad knee, i
will get the call over Vance Faw
cett because of his speed and wil
lingness to mix it up. The latter
has failed to display any degree of
punch all season, looking especial
ly sluggish in the U.S.S. debacle.

upset was a most hitter one, the
Cards coining from behind in the
last minute of play to win out by a
score of 28 to 27 after Santa Clara
had apparently cinched the tilt
with a 13-point lead.
Consequently tonight's game
should provide plenty of thrills for
the cash customers, for outside of
the fact that Blind Bill Hollander
will be out on the floor with his
tin whistle, the two teams are na
tural rivals. Hunt's lads must come
out .on top to keep their season
from being a complete Hop, while a
defeat will put the Cards at a
psychological disadvantage for the j
decisive Cal court battle on Splur- I
day night.
Squads on Even Terms
The two squads will be on prac- ;
tically even terms when they take j
tlie floor, as both have absorbed j
more than their just share of the j
bumps this winter. Santa Clara i
holds a close victory over Cal, but j
dropped a 27 to 17 contest to St. !
Ignatius two weeks ago. On the i
other hand, Stanford trounced the
Gray Fog outfit and fell an easy '
prey before the Bears in the Big ]
Series opener.
With four of last year's veterans
back, the Broncos were doped to
clean up before the season got
under way, but like the Cards, have
yet failed to function with any sort
of regularity. Jack Cough, captain,
plays an outstanding game.at for- !
ward, being high-scorer for the
Drones in nearly every game to
date. Tim Connolly, at center, is ,
the other big cog in Santa Clara's j
attack and expects to get a ma- i
jority of the tip-offs this evening.
Regular Lineup
In an effort to check the Mission ,
offense, Hunt has decided to start j
his regular lineup, with Mike Rey- j
nolds and Captain Rothert at i
guard, and Don Tyler paired with
Red Berg at forward. Long John ,
McCandless will hold down the i
pivot position as usual.
Long John had another off night i
against the Trojans lust Saturday,
nd the Card mentor figures that
he is about due to tap in baskets I
with regularity once more. Tyler, ;
who is bothered with a bad knee, i
will get the call over Vance Faw
cett because of his speed and wil
lingness to mix it up. The latter
has failed to display any degree of
punch all season, looking especial
ly sluggish in the U.S.S. debacle.
Invading the Farm to avenge
In si year's defeat at the hands of
the Cards, Santa Clara is sched
uled to tangle with Coach Husky
Hunt's varsity capers on the cam
pus hardwood at eight o'clock this
evening.
The Mission players have been
pointing for the Stanford engage
ment all season, as last winter's
upset was a most hitter one, the
Cards coining from behind in the
