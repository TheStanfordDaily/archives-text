# THE 						PUNISHING PINWHEEL OF PICCADILLY
## "Kid" Berg, "Another Harry Greb," Always Thrills His Spectators With Ten Full Rounds of Slugging 
### BY FEG MURRAY, '16 
Last May an unknown English
Jew by the name of Jack "Kid"
Berg proved the sensation of the
evening at Madison Square Garden
when he put up one of the most,
spectacular fights ever seen in that
arena, with the ever-willing Bruce
Flowers, New Rochele negro, as
his opponent. For ten rounds the
two lightweights stood toe-to-toe
and mixed it, the free-handed slug
ging not coming in short bursts
but being virtually continuous. The
customers were left limp and ex
hausted after the thrilling bout, was
over and the two willing gladiators
were rematched to do it again two
weeks later.
Again Kid Berg won the deci
sion in a punching party that was
only slightly less exciting than
their first set-to. The line showing
made by the English-Jewish lad
put to shame the so-called fights
put up by numerous high-priced
gladiators who don't do as much
battling in ten rounds as Berg did
in one. Fans began calling the
Whitechapel youth "Another Harry
Greb," because of his windmill
style, and Walter St. Denis, of the
Garden, called attention to lite fact
that G-R-E-B backwards spelled
B-E-R-G. Then, too, Greb's real
name was Berg. There certainly is
a similarity in more than the names
between this fighting son of Johnny
litill and the former world's middle
weight champion, whose death so
shocked the sports world in Octo
ber 1926.
In July Berg beat Mushy Calla
han, junior welterweight cham
pion, in a bout at Ebbets Field; on
August 5 scored a technical knock
out at the expense of Joe Trabon

j of Kansas City; and on August IS
j scored another > victory when the
.referee stopped the fight with
Harry Wallace of Philadelphia to
| prevent Wallace from being
knocked out. In September, he won
j on a foul over Georgie Balduc, and
' later mussed up Phil McGraw so
i badly that the popular Greek
i florist announced his retirement
I from the ring. Maybe Berg isn't a
| classy fighter, maybe he hasn't got.
| much of a knockout punch, maybe
j science and skill are unknown to
j him, but you can't help wishing
good luck to a guy who gives you
I your money's worth from the first
j gong to the last! More power to
j him!
