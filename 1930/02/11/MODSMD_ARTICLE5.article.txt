# OGLE TO SPEAK ON POET VIRGIL
## 1930 Chosen to Celebrate Birth of Latin Poet 
### 
Professor Marbury B. Ogle, now
visiting professor in Stanford's De
partment of Classical Literature,
and former head of the same de
partment at Ohio State University,
will discuss one of Virgil's minor
poems, the Fourth Eclogue, at 7:30
o'clock tonight in the Assembly
Hall. His subject is "Virgil's Pro
phecy of a Messiah."
Since the year 1930 has been
chosen, by the common consent of
the nations of the western world,
the occasion for the celebration
of the bimillennium anniversary of
the birth of the Latin poet, Virgil,
the world will be acknowledging
its indebtedness to him. According
to Professor Ogle, "Virgil is a uni
versal poet."
"Few men, certainly no poet,
have ever made a deeper appeal
to the thought and imagination of
those who came after them than
has Virgil. Although his poetry
owed its inspiration to the condi
tions and spirit of his own day, it
deals with those profound problems
of life which humanity meets
everywhere, and at. all periods. He
| dealt with the problems of duty
' and conduct, of man's problems of
j duty and conduct, of man's rela
i (ions to his fellows and to God, of
! suffering and sorrow, and in gen-
J eral of man's place in the scheme
' of things."
This lecture, fifth of the winter
quarter series of regular Tuesday
evening lectures, has been ar
ranged bv the Stanford Committee
! on Public Exercises. It will be open
! to the public.
