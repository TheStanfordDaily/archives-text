# Lost Articles Should Be Called For At Once
## 
### 
Several very good fountain pens,
a few pairs of gloves, a book en
titled "Ben Jonson" from the San
Francisco Library, and a number
of other lost articles have been
turned in to the Cashier's Window,
on the second floor of the Aduiiuis
tration Building, in the Auditor's
office. If any student has lost any
of these things, the office would
appreciate it if he called for them,
