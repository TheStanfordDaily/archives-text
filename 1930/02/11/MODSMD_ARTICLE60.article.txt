While Stanford women are going
in for sport clothes of the bright
new spring colors, and are making
a colorful appearance on the scene
of the University's newest activity,
the golf course, campus clothes
with curves is the latest fashion
edict handed down for the well
dressed co-ed at California, accord
ing to an Associated Press dis
patch received yesterday.
At a fashion tea held on the
campus of the University of Cali
fornia recently in conjunction with
the university Y.W.C.A., the model
apparel that should be worn by the
up-to-date co-ed was displayed.
This was the decision:
She should attended classes in
semi-sport, clothes with the skirt
not more than four inches below
the knee.
Floor-Length Dresses
She goes to formal afternoon
teas or evening parties dressed in
floor-length frock.
"A predominance of curves is
the keynote for the new styles,"
declared Miss Ann Covert, Univer
sity graduate who lias interested
herself in women's clothing as a
career. "Longer skirts are in
vogue ,of course, but the new
lengths Paris has decreed were
never meant to apply for sports
or campus wear."
