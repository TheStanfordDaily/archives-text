# CARD BOXING TEAM BADLY HANDICAPPED BY DEARTH OF MEN
## 
### 
After losing the first meet of the
season to Davis Friday, the boxing
squad last night met without the serv
ices of three men who competed
against the California Aggies. Handi
capped as lioxing Coach Harry Malo
ney is with the small squad, the loss
of the three men is a major disaster.
Fred V ciiglit, heavyweight, is un
able to work out because of an attack
of boils. Hugh Kecnan, light-heavy,
had an abscess in his ear lanced Sat
urday and his doctor forbids him to
exercise lor a day or so. Vance Rog
ers, lightweight, pulled a muscle in
his left arm and will be lost to the
squad for at least a week.
Partially compensating for all the
losses, the return of l-.d Dillon to the
squad is marred only by the fact that
the former captain is at present recov
ering from an attack of the flu. and
will not be in shape to box for a
week at least.

With (icotge Eastman still suffer
ing from poison oak and Fred John
son suffering from an attack of boils,
Maloncy is faced with a dearth of
man-power. If the men do not round
into shape, there is a possibility that
the remainder of the boxing schedule
will be canceled. So small is the squad
that the coaches arc forced to give
individual attention to each of the
men, since the possibility of injuries
precludes much boxing among the
men.
