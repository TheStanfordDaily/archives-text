in order to make the Quad a i
more efficient, continuous unit in-1
stead of being a separate one each
year, an amendment to the section
in the Publications Council by
laws governing the organization of
the Quad was recommended to the 1
Executive Committee at its regu- I
lar meeting last night by the editor j
and business manager of that pub
lication, and duly passed by the !
Committee.
The amendment provides for the
taking on of tryoutees each year of
freshman instead of sophomore
standing. At the end of a year of
work as general assistants, three i
assistant editors are to be appoint-!
Ed by the editor then in office. At
the end of a year of assistant edi
torship the editor then will appoint
the one he deems fittest to be his
successor.
