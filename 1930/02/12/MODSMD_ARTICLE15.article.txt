# APPOINTMENT OF HUGHES ATTACKED
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Fob. II </p).
Severe condemnation of the views
of Charles Evans Hughes rang
forth in the Senate today as un
expected opposition to his nomina
tion as Chief Justice of the United
States developed and forced over
until tomorrow a vote on his con
firmation.
Senator Borah, Republican, Ida
ho, and Senator Glass, Democrat,
Virginia, assailed Hughes' attitude
on public questions. They stirred
up a debate which brought two
Democrats —Wagner and Copeland
—and the veteran Senator Gillett,
Republican, Massachusetts, to their
feet in praise of the nominee.
The opposition to Hughes, cen
tered principally in the group of
Western Republican independents,
appeared overnight after the
speech yesterday of Senator Nor
ris, Republican, Nebraska. Lead
ers were confident tonight regard
less that Hughes' nomination
would be confirmed tomorrow by
a decisive majority.
