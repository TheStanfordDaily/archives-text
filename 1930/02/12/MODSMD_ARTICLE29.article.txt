# QUAKE LOCATED NEAR MONTEREY
## Santa Clara Seismograph Records Three Shocks 
### 
The earth tremors which shook
Stanford University and vicinity
yesterday afternoon at. approxi
mately 1:20 o'clock probably origi
nated in Monterey Bay, according
to University ol' Santa Clara ob
servers.
The seismograph there recorded
three separate shocks of varying
intensity and duration. According
to Professor 11. C. Schenck of the
Department of Geology at Stanford,
(he tremors followed a line extend
ing in a northwesterly and a south
easterly direction, and may have
originated in the San Andreas
fault or one of the many faults
known to geologists in this region.
"The shocks came under section
!V r of the Rossi-Forel scale," Dr.
Schenck said. "'Shaking movable
objects, such as doors and win
dows. and causing cracking sounds
in houses is the classification
which is listed. The San Francisco
catastrophe in 1906 came under X,
the last section of the same scale."
