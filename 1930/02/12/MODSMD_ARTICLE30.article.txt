# MEETING OF FROSH TRACKSTERS CALLED BY BILL ELLINGTON
## 
### 
Far from satisfied with the pres
ent showing of his frosh track
team. Hill Ellington, assistant track
coach, has called a meeting of the
entire freshman squad tonight at
7 o'clock in room 45 of the Board
of Athletic Control Building. Less
than two weeks now remain before
the first meet of the season, and
yet the freshman team actually ap
pears weaker than it did a month
ago.
Eastman in 440
In the -140 Ellington has Ben
Eastman who is as fine a prospect
as has entered here in recent
years. Eastman has been pressing
the varsity men right along and
Ellington expects him to run the
440 in 50 seconds or better before
the season is over. Thorny Rogers
has excellent possibilities in the
quarter mile, too.
The half-mile is probably the
strongest running event on the
frosh team. There are three men,
Frank Fullenwider, Bob Hunter,
and George Naylon, who are all
capable of 2:05 or better. Ellington
is afraid he will have to break this
trio up and shift Fullenwider to
the mile if no prospects in the
longer race are uncovered. The
mile and two mile are without any
promising runners as yet.
Herbert Only Hurdler
Alden Herbert has plenty of po
tential ability in both the high and
low hurdles, but he is all alone in
the events. Last week Herbert ran
the 220 lows in 2(5 seconds flat and
the 120 highs in 17 1-5 seconds.
The frosh team's greatest
strength is concentrated in the
weight events. In Here Lu horde
and Nelson Gray. Ellington has an
other Krenz-Rothert combination.
Both of them put the l<i-pound shot
out '!"> feet. Laborde is throwing
the discus only a few inches short
of 1 10 feet and Gray is sailing the
platter around the 12f> mark.
I»(>n Blackmail, a 5-10 high
jumper, and Lloyd Austin, a 11-<i
vaulter, look like point winners in
their respective events. It is very
doubtful how tjie frosh will fare in
any of the other fluid events. The
broad jumpers are having their
troubles in getting close to 2u
I< « t and the javelin throwers have
not tossed their spears over 150
vet.
