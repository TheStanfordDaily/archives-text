I Sinking a free throw in the last
few seconds of play in an over
time period, Captain Harlow Ro
thert broke a 31-all tie to give the
j Cardinal cagers a one-point victory
over Santa Clara, :t2 to 3J, last
1 night in the Farm Pavilion.
After piling up points at will in
j the first stages of the hectic tilt,
| Stanford played ragged ball in Mi':
i second half to blow a ten-point
j lead, when the Bronc sharpshoot-
I ers connected with, a couple of
baskets from the center of the
j court. A lengthy shot by Jack
I Cough, leader of the Mission live,
1 followed by Niles' foul toss, knot-
I ted the count at 27 to 27 as the
j regular playing period came to a
| close.
With Vance Fawcett out of the
I game on personal l'ouls, Stanford';;
1 chances looked slim indeed as tin;
; extra session got under way with
! Cough converting a free throw to
i put the Broncs out in front.
The Cards came right back to
! snatch the lead when Red Berg,
| flashy forward, sneaked in under
| the, basket to flip in a difficult left
handed shot. Long John Mc.f'aiid
! less apparently cinched the till a
i moment later by tapping in an
| easy set-up.
But with less than u minute to
| go, Cough let fly another one of
! his long shots which swished
j through the hoop uncannily. Ami
| once again the score was even
i Steven. Just as the rapid fans
j started whooping it up with expec-
J tations of an added five minute",
j of heart throbs, Niles fouled Cap
i tain Rothert as the latter dribbled
J in under the goal for a sucker at
j tc mp(.
Rothert came through with one
j out. of the two free trys and all
| was over but the yelling.
Besides playing a good floor
i game, Long John McCaudless vva
| high point man of the evening";
i festivities with 1"> tallies. At that,
I the elongated Card pivot man
I missed three or four sucker bas
| ket.s. However, Red Berg was the.
! real star of the tilt, as it was hi
I pep, speed, and ball hounding that
inspired the Farm cagers to come
j out on top.
Mike Reynolds came through
j with another good exhibition at
I back guard, finding the, basket lor
j three field goals as well as recov
| ering the ball off the backboard
time after time. Captain Rotherl
! also played a strong defensive
I game, and paired with Reynold.;
kept the Broncs from getting more
than a couple of set-ups.
I For Santa Clara, Jack Cough
! stood out by his shooting ability,
•and was second high scorer with
I 12 points to his credit, five long
j arching baskets and two Ire
throws. Spotlswood, at center.
: played a creditable game, although
lie was outjumped by Rothert mo;
