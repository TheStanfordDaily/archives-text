### 
I lif flection hoard provided the campus will) iis semi-annual
laugh yeslerdav by making another sludenl flection into a hit of
low comedy:
\o, the hallot hoses weren't siulled this time. The trouble came
when some bright-eyed hoy or girl discovered that a candidate had
I/feu left oil the sophomore hallot and three junior political aspi
rants were missing from the roll.
I lie constitution \< at fault, of course. It should provide that
election hoard members must take a course in bookkeeping before
assuming their duties. Or perhaps a good stiff set of hunt the
thinible games would whet their powers ol observation sufficiently
to make them watch such small things as candidates in an election.
I'.oh t lark, chairman ol the board, has been verv frank and verv
sensible. Ile oilers no excuses. Alter all. there can be none.
I'ul C lark is to be blamed no more than his predecessors who
weathered through other election fiascos. Somewhere the system is
at fault. I 'resident Steinbeck would do well to appoint another of
his investigating committees to see if a plan cannot be devised
whereby the weighty political wheels that grind out student govern
ment here may run without slipping persistently out of gear.
