# LINCOLN—"SELF-MADE MAN"
## 
### 
< )ne hundred and twenty-one years ago in a mean shacj< set
among the Kentucky backwoods was born a boy who livedo to be
come a great man —a man who was more fiercely hated and more
fondly loved than any other in the history of this country.
That man was Abraham Lincoln. From the depths of rusticity
he rose to the highest place of the nation, from a morass of igno
rance and provincialism lie rose to fame as a political philosopher.
Starting as a non-entity he made himself a leader of men.
In short. Lincoln was what we Americans call self-made. We
like to think of that. Mothers tell their children about I lonest Abe
and what he made of himself; how in America every boy has an
equal chance.
I hit are there any \braham Lincolns today? And if there are
any what is to be their lot ?
Sadly enough we aren't living in his day. We are living in an
:u-e of conllict :in an agf when "pull" counts more than labor: in
an age when "position" counts more than ability.
