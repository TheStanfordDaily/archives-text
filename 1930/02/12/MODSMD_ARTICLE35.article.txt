# SOMETIME IN THE HAZY FUTURE

T'or thirty-nine years there lias been a campus "]>rol)lem" sur
rounding the possibility of a new gymnasium for the women. Last
print; the long years of inactivity were broken bv an active cam
paign by the I'ive Hundred to get a new to replace the "tem
porary structure" which has been gracing the University property
since the first days of Stanford.
Last June the gift which had been the object of much clamor
and conversation for generations of Stanford students was pre-
sented to the women by the Board of Athletic Control. The dreams
of years were realized — and the Five Hundred were soon to have
a structure befitting the name of Stanford under the questionable
title of Roble Gymnasium. The summer went by — plans were
drawn and many conferences occurred.
Last quarter brought with it many more conferences until at last
there was a definite promise made to the women that the building
would be actually started on the first of February. Now, with the
characteristic inactivity which has grown to be a symbol of all agi-
tation for a women's gym — the ground still lies unbroken and the
women's gym is still in the "conference"' stage.
Surely thirty-nine years L quite long enough for the I'ive 1 kin
dred to wait for new showers and sun porches — and it is the hope
of this newspaper that those who are responsible for breaking the
ground will make an effort to see that the ancient vision is actualized
during the fortieth year — forty is such a nice round figure.
