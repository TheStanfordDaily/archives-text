T'or thirty-nine years there lias been a campus "]>rol)lem" sur
rounding the possibility of a new gymnasium for the women. Last
print; the long years of inactivity were broken bv an active cam
paign by the I'ive Hundred to get a new to replace the "tem
porary structure' which has been gracing tlie I'niversitv property
ince tlie first days of Slanford.
I.ast June the mill which had been tlie object of much clamor
and conversation for generations of Stanford students was pre
sented to 111<• women by the I'.oard of Athletic ('onlrol. The dreams
ol years were realized—and the l-ive Hundred were soon to have
a structure befitting the name of Stanford under the questionable
title of Ruble (iymnasium. The summer went by — plans were
drawn and many conferences occurred.
Last quarter brought with it many more conferences until at last
there was a definite promise made to the women that the building
would be actually started on the first of l ehruarv. Now, with the
characteristic inactivity which has grown to be a symbol of all agi
tation lor a women's gym the ground still lies unbroken and the
women's gym is still in the "conference"' stage.
Surely thirty-nine years L quite long enough for the I'ive 1 kin
dred to wait lor new showers and sun porches—and it is the hope
of this newspaper that those who are responsible for breaking the
ground w ill make an effort to see that the ancient vision is actualized
during the fortieth year — forty is such a nice round figure.
