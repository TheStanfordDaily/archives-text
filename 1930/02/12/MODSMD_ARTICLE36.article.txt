# THOSE WHO THROW STONES
## 
### 
While members oi the l ive Hundred smile knowingly, co-eds
at our esteemed contemporary institution over in lierkelev are rally
ing to the detense ol good old California pulchritude.
I he inspiration for numerous campus opinions appearing in the
Ihuly ( ah)ornidii, in defense of the much touted beauty of the I Hue
and (iold sisterhood. seems to be that some embittered male of the
Hear species has not won the lavor of the gods who dispense blind
dales, and has aired his views on ( aliforni.Vs femininity in the col
umns of the campus daily.
\pparently California women are being exposed to this sort of
attack for the first time: they feverishly deny the embittered male's
â€¢ barges and launch counter attacks on the he-men of the region.
Surely the fair ( aliforuians arc novices at this game, which fortu
nately died ot old age on the Stanford campus some time ago.
( ounter attacks are boomerangs and aggravate the cross-fire of
criticism, a fact which the hive Hundred discovered after a brief
debate. Stanford women neither boycotted nor snubbed during the
last outbreaks, but merely smiled tolerantly and remained silent, thus
taking the sport out of writing ill-considered diatribes.
I be tea-pot tempest which raged for a short time died of stag
nation and the l ive I lundred easily won the battle bv being good
sports.
