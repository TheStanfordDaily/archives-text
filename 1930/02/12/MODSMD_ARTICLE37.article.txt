THE MIRACLE OF PEILLE., By
J. L. Campbell. New York: E.
P. Dutton & Co. 1929. At Stan
ford Bookstore.
The reader must, whatever liis
other reactions, be surprised lliat
such a book as this should have
been written during the past year.
Religious mysticism in a modern
setting is a very unusual pheno
menon in present literature.
The Miracle of Peille is the story
! of a girl of southern France whose
j motheV was stoned to death as a
j Gypsy and whose father, supposed
I to have been in league with the
devil, was hung as a murderer.
The girl begins to work miracles;
she writes an Arabic inscription
upon an altar which, when trans
lated, proves to be the measure
ments of an ancient monastery at
Peille. To tlie restoration of this
, edifice she devotes her life.
An American vaudeville pro
ducer happens to hear of her while
at Monte Carlo, and she accepts
his offer of an American tour in
j order that she may raise money
i for her work. She is not successful
l on the stage, but, 011 returning to
France, she is killed by the auto
mobile of a wealthy family. They
hear of her story and rebuild the
monastery.
Whatever one may believe, mira-
I cles do not seem proper in New
York. One can accept and enjoy
stories of saints if they are laid
in the times of Aucassin and Nico
lette. But the same beauties are
not at all convincing when treated
as in The Miracle of Peille.
! It is evident that the author is
laboring to secure contrast when,
1 at the conclusion of a miracle, he
remarks upon the activities of
gambling houses in Monaco. The
whole thing is annoying, and is,
1 think, a subject which should
have been left to those authors
who found themselves living in nn
age of faith, untroubled by modern
science. —E. E. W.
THE LOVE PARADE—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Maurice Chevalier, thanks to
some sort of an automotive exhibit
conducted last week, is the subject
of nearly every theatrical discus
sion these days. Many saw him
dancing at the St. Francis Hotel,
and the Auto Show brought him
face-to-face with record-breaking
crowds. All of which brings up his
latest picture, "The Love Parade,"
which opens tonight in the friendly
little hamlet of Palo Alto.
"The Love Parade" will be im
mediately compared to "Innocents
of Paris." It is much more preten
tious, lias a more charming lead
ing lady, and sets Monsieur Cheva
lier in a different and more prince
ly part. He is the naughty foreign
minister of Svlvania, a fictitious
European monarchy, lie is recalled
for being so naughty, and faces tli"
queen for punishment. The queen
falls for him, amid considerable
theme songs.
"The Innocents of Paris" was
; often condemned ns being a poor
story, but it was much more suc
cessful than "The Love Parade" in
setting Chevalier in a situation
suitable to his winning personality.
Jeanette Mac Donald as the queen
adds « great deal of scintillation
to the opera. Lupino Lane and
Lillian Roth supply the comedy.
Put we still hold out for the simple
I inau-of-t.he-stroots part for the

i French favorite of Paris, New
York, and San Francisco.

YOUNG APOLLO. By Anthony
Gibbs. Harper and Bros., Pub
lishers. New York and London.
1929.
When T finished this book I was
strongly reminded of the French
gentlemen who said that ninety
per cent of all modern novels were
just plain trash. For "Young Apol
lo" in spile of a rather intriguing
name is unfortunately not among
the upper ten per cent.. Just why
it is not would he a little hard to
say. lu the firsl place it is terribly
weak, ever so ineffective, and
somewhat inclined to he over-dra
matic. When the book is done you
; wonder just why in the name of
something or other the author
wrole the book.
Allan Shepherd is (he beautiful
young man around whom the so
called plot revolves. The son of a
wandering, rather ne'er-do-well art
ist, whose mother died when he
was born; lie grows up to be a
rather lonely person, inclined to
poetry and oilier things likely to
contain beauty. We find him at Ox
ford, wandering around like the
dreamer he is and in love with
Gibbs' idea of a combination
j nymph-scientist by the name of
Jane Andersen. But to make a
somewhat tiresome story short, Al
lan and Jane finally married and
are thrown in contact, with their
fellow human beings all involved
in the daily struggle for existence.
This struggle is too much for
Allan so Jane helps earn the liv
-1 ing for'the family which is by this
lime well on its way toward being
composed of three members. The
arrival of lliis third member is tlie
crowning high point of absurdity
of the book —the husband pacing
j frantically up and down in front
of the locked door, etc., ad nau
seam. Finally Allan takes three
long walks, smokes bis pipe until
he is dizzier than usual, and then
comes back home to find his wife
dead. Just why she died I have
not been able to figure out. Per
haps it was dramatic, but if that
is the case then so is red flannel
underwear.
There were of course some good
parts to the book. Gibbs is rather
clever when it comes to descrip
tion and some of his philosophic
platitudes contained good sense.
One of them in particular is "The
| utterly rational man will find him
self an outcast in this world where
1 most men are content to rule them
selves by their follies." Which sen
j timent is pretty true when one con
siders some of the things that are
done in this day and age in search
of happiness.
But after all you should nol be
I expected to read an entire novel
; for a bit of philosophy. —A. !\T.

When T finished this book I was
strongly reminded of the French
gentlemen who said that ninety
per cent of all modern novels were
just plain trash. For "Young Apol
lo" in spile of a rather intriguing
name is unfortunately not among
the upper ten per cent.. Just why
it is not would he a little hard to
say. lu the firsl place it is terribly
weak, ever so ineffective, and
somewhat inclined to he over-dra
matic. When the book is done you
; wonder just why in the name of
something or other the author
wrole the book.
Allan Shepherd is (he beautiful
young man around whom the so
called plot revolves. The son of a
wandering, rather ne'er-do-well art
ist, whose mother died when he
was born; lie grows up to be a
rather lonely person, inclined to
poetry and oilier things likely to
contain beauty. We find him at Ox
ford, wandering around like the
dreamer he is and in love with
Gibbs' idea of a combination
j nymph-scientist by the name of
Jane Andersen. But to make a
somewhat tiresome story short, Al
lan and Jane finally married and
are thrown in contact, with their
fellow human beings all involved
in the daily struggle for existence.
This struggle is too much for
Allan so Jane helps earn the liv
-1 ing for'the family which is by this
lime well on its way toward being
composed of three members. The
arrival of lliis third member is tlie
crowning high point of absurdity
of the book —the husband pacing
j frantically up and down in front
of the locked door, etc., ad nau
seam. Finally Allan takes three
long walks, smokes bis pipe until
he is dizzier than usual, and then
comes back home to find his wife
dead. Just why she died I have
not been able to figure out. Per
haps it was dramatic, but if that
is the case then so is red flannel
underwear.
There were of course some good
parts to the book. Gibbs is rather
clever when it comes to descrip
tion and some of his philosophic
platitudes contained good sense.
One of them in particular is "The
| utterly rational man will find him
self an outcast in this world where
1 most men are content to rule them
selves by their follies." Which sen
j timent is pretty true when one con
siders some of the things that are
done in this day and age in search
of happiness.
But after all you should nol be

THE MIRACLE OF PEILLE., By
J. L. Campbell. New York: E.
P. Dutton & Co. 1929. At Stan
ford Bookstore.
The reader must, whatever liis
other reactions, be surprised lliat
such a book as this should have
been written during the past year.
Religious mysticism in a modern
setting is a very unusual pheno
menon in present literature.
The Miracle of Peille is the story
! of a girl of southern France whose
j motheV was stoned to death as a
j Gypsy and whose father, supposed
I to have been in league with the
devil, was hung as a murderer.
The girl begins to work miracles;
she writes an Arabic inscription
upon an altar which, when trans
lated, proves to be the measure
ments of an ancient monastery at
Peille. To tlie restoration of this
, edifice she devotes her life.
An American vaudeville pro
ducer happens to hear of her while
at Monte Carlo, and she accepts
his offer of an American tour in
j order that she may raise money
i for her work. She is not successful
l on the stage, but, 011 returning to
France, she is killed by the auto
mobile of a wealthy family. They
hear of her story and rebuild the
monastery.
Whatever one may believe, mira-
I cles do not seem proper in New
York. One can accept and enjoy
stories of saints if they are laid
in the times of Aucassin and Nico
lette. But the same beauties are
not at all convincing when treated
as in The Miracle of Peille.
! It is evident that the author is
laboring to secure contrast when,
1 at the conclusion of a miracle, he
remarks upon the activities of
gambling houses in Monaco. The
whole thing is annoying, and is,
1 think, a subject which should
have been left to those authors
who found themselves living in nn
age of faith, untroubled by modern
science. —E. E. W.
THE LOVE PARADE—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Maurice Chevalier, thanks to
some sort of an automotive exhibit
conducted last week, is the subject
of nearly every theatrical discus
sion these days. Many saw him
dancing at the St. Francis Hotel,
and the Auto Show brought him
face-to-face with record-breaking
crowds. All of which brings up his
latest picture, "The Love Parade,"
which opens tonight in the friendly
little hamlet of Palo Alto.
"The Love Parade" will be im
mediately compared to "Innocents
of Paris." It is much more preten
tious, lias a more charming lead
ing lady, and sets Monsieur Cheva
lier in a different and more prince
ly part. He is the naughty foreign

THE MIRACLE OF PEILLE., By
J. L. Campbell. New York: E.
P. Dutton & Co. 1929. At Stan
ford Bookstore.
The reader must, whatever liis
other reactions, be surprised lliat
such a book as this should have
been written during the past year.
Religious mysticism in a modern
setting is a very unusual pheno
menon in present literature.
The Miracle of Peille is the story
! of a girl of southern France whose
j motheV was stoned to death as a
j Gypsy and whose father, supposed
I to have been in league with the
devil, was hung as a murderer.
The girl begins to work miracles;
she writes an Arabic inscription
upon an altar which, when trans
lated, proves to be the measure
ments of an ancient monastery at
Peille. To tlie restoration of this
, edifice she devotes her life.
An American vaudeville pro
ducer happens to hear of her while
at Monte Carlo, and she accepts
his offer of an American tour in
j order that she may raise money
i for her work. She is not successful
l on the stage, but, 011 returning to
France, she is killed by the auto
mobile of a wealthy family. They
hear of her story and rebuild the
monastery.
Whatever one may believe, mira-
I cles do not seem proper in New
York. One can accept and enjoy
stories of saints if they are laid
in the times of Aucassin and Nico
lette. But the same beauties are
not at all convincing when treated
as in The Miracle of Peille.
! It is evident that the author is
laboring to secure contrast when,
1 at the conclusion of a miracle, he
remarks upon the activities of
gambling houses in Monaco. The
whole thing is annoying, and is,
1 think, a subject which should
have been left to those authors
who found themselves living in nn
age of faith, untroubled by modern
science. —E. E. W.
THE LOVE PARADE—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Maurice Chevalier, thanks to
some sort of an automotive exhibit
conducted last week, is the subject
of nearly every theatrical discus
sion these days. Many saw him
dancing at the St. Francis Hotel,
and the Auto Show brought him
face-to-face with record-breaking
crowds. All of which brings up his
latest picture, "The Love Parade,"
which opens tonight in the friendly
little hamlet of Palo Alto.
"The Love Parade" will be im
mediately compared to "Innocents
of Paris." It is much more preten
tious, lias a more charming lead
ing lady, and sets Monsieur Cheva
lier in a different and more prince
ly part. He is the naughty foreign
minister of Svlvania, a fictitious
European monarchy, lie is recalled
for being so naughty, and faces tli"
queen for punishment. The queen
falls for him, amid considerable
theme songs.
"The Innocents of Paris" was
; often condemned ns being a poor
story, but it was much more suc
cessful than "The Love Parade" in
setting Chevalier in a situation
suitable to his winning personality.
Jeanette Mac Donald as the queen
adds « great deal of scintillation
to the opera. Lupino Lane and
Lillian Roth supply the comedy.
Put we still hold out for the simple
I inau-of-t.he-stroots part for the

i French favorite of Paris, New
York, and San Francisco.

YOUNG APOLLO. By Anthony

1929.
When T finished this book I was
strongly reminded of the French
gentlemen who said that ninety
per cent of all modern novels were
just plain trash. For "Young Apol
lo" in spile of a rather intriguing
name is unfortunately not among
the upper ten per cent.. Just why
it is not would he a little hard to
say. lu the firsl place it is terribly
weak, ever so ineffective, and
somewhat inclined to he over-dra
matic. When the book is done you
; wonder just why in the name of
something or other the author
wrole the book.
Allan Shepherd is (he beautiful
young man around whom the so
called plot revolves. The son of a
wandering, rather ne'er-do-well art
ist, whose mother died when he
was born; lie grows up to be a
rather lonely person, inclined to
poetry and oilier things likely to
contain beauty. We find him at Ox
ford, wandering around like the
dreamer he is and in love with
Gibbs' idea of a combination
j nymph-scientist by the name of
Jane Andersen. But to make a
somewhat tiresome story short, Al
lan and Jane finally married and
are thrown in contact, with their
fellow human beings all involved
in the daily struggle for existence.
This struggle is too much for
Allan so Jane helps earn the liv
-1 ing for'the family which is by this
lime well on its way toward being
composed of three members. The
arrival of lliis third member is tlie
crowning high point of absurdity
of the book —the husband pacing
j frantically up and down in front
of the locked door, etc., ad nau

THE LOVE PARADE—At the Var
sity Theatre.
Maurice Chevalier, thanks to
some sort of an automotive exhibit
conducted last week, is the subject
of nearly every theatrical discus
sion these days. Many saw him
dancing at the St. Francis Hotel,
and the Auto Show brought him
face-to-face with record-breaking
crowds. All of which brings up his
latest picture, "The Love Parade,"
which opens tonight in the friendly
little hamlet of Palo Alto.
"The Love Parade" will be im
mediately compared to "Innocents
of Paris." It is much more preten
tious, lias a more charming lead
ing lady, and sets Monsieur Cheva
lier in a different and more prince
ly part. He is the naughty foreign
minister of Svlvania, a fictitious
European monarchy, lie is recalled
for being so naughty, and faces tli"
queen for punishment. The queen
falls for him, amid considerable
theme songs.
"The Innocents of Paris" was
; often condemned ns being a poor
story, but it was much more suc
cessful than "The Love Parade" in
setting Chevalier in a situation
suitable to his winning personality.
Jeanette Mac Donald as the queen
adds « great deal of scintillation
to the opera. Lupino Lane and
Lillian Roth supply the comedy.
Put we still hold out for the simple
I inau-of-t.he-stroots part for the

i French favorite of Paris, New
York, and San Francisco.

YOUNG APOLLO. By Anthony
Gibbs. Harper and Bros., Pub
lishers. New York and London.
1929.
When T finished this book I was
strongly reminded of the French
gentlemen who said that ninety
per cent of all modern novels were
just plain trash. For "Young Apol
lo" in spile of a rather intriguing
name is unfortunately not among
the upper ten per cent.. Just why
it is not would he a little hard to
say. lu the firsl place it is terribly
weak, ever so ineffective, and
somewhat inclined to he over-dra
matic. When the book is done you
; wonder just why in the name of
something or other the author
wrole the book.
Allan Shepherd is (he beautiful
young man around whom the so
called plot revolves. The son of a
wandering, rather ne'er-do-well art
ist, whose mother died when he
was born; lie grows up to be a
rather lonely person, inclined to
poetry and oilier things likely to
contain beauty. We find him at Ox
ford, wandering around like the
dreamer he is and in love with
Gibbs' idea of a combination
j nymph-scientist by the name of
Jane Andersen. But to make a
somewhat tiresome story short, Al
lan and Jane finally married and
are thrown in contact, with their
fellow human beings all involved
in the daily struggle for existence.
This struggle is too much for
Allan so Jane helps earn the liv
-1 ing for'the family which is by this
lime well on its way toward being
composed of three members. The
arrival of lliis third member is tlie
crowning high point of absurdity
of the book —the husband pacing
j frantically up and down in front
of the locked door, etc., ad nau
seam. Finally Allan takes three
long walks, smokes bis pipe until
he is dizzier than usual, and then
comes back home to find his wife
dead. Just why she died I have
not been able to figure out. Per
haps it was dramatic, but if that
is the case then so is red flannel
underwear.
There were of course some good
parts to the book. Gibbs is rather
clever when it comes to descrip
tion and some of his philosophic
platitudes contained good sense.
One of them in particular is "The
| utterly rational man will find him
self an outcast in this world where
1 most men are content to rule them
selves by their follies." Which sen
j timent is pretty true when one con
siders some of the things that are
done in this day and age in search
of happiness.
But after all you should nol be
I expected to read an entire novel
; for a bit of philosophy. —A. !\T.

Packing more entertainment into

The reader must, whatever liis

such a book as this should have
been written during the past year.
Religious mysticism in a modern
setting is a very unusual pheno

The Miracle of Peille is the story
! of a girl of southern France whose
j motheV was stoned to death as a
j Gypsy and whose father, supposed
I to have been in league with the
devil, was hung as a murderer.
The girl begins to work miracles;
she writes an Arabic inscription
upon an altar which, when trans
lated, proves to be the measure
