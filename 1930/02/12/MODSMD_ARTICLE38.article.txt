The Editor, Sir:
i find it necessary to vent tny
wrath and indignation. Why is it.
Unit Stanford students arc forced
to allow all of Palo Alto High
School and Santa Clara and Moun
tain View and'Mayfield to play on
the Stanford tennis courts when
they want to use them themselves
and when they are supposedly
erected for their benefit? It is more
, than discouraging to go, time and
again, only to find the courts oc
cupied by numerous and sundry
1 people who have no connection
1 villi the University whatsoever,
except a temporary one with the
! tennis courts. What's the point in
having tennis courts for the stu
! dents and leading them on to be
; lieve that they are one of the Uni
! versity privileges when they have
as much chance of using them as
; an elephant lias of making a trans-
I atlantic flight?
! And another thing, when an en
j terprising student signs up at the
I Library for a reserved book, the
' popular supposition is that he will
' be able to read that book during
: the hour for which lie has signed.
] But this seems to be another Fable
] of the Farm; for nine chances out
of ten, he doesn't get it. It comes
in before the hour is up, the li
brarian gives it. out again to some
unsigned up person for the remain
der of the hour, it isn't turned in
on time, and the person who is
signed up for the next hour is
politely asked to sign up for some
other hour later 011. The other
hours are all taken, or the student
himself is unable to be there at
any other time. One usually has a
pretty vital reason for signing up
for a book. And is certainly
wouldn't hurt the librarian's pres
tige to go and find that book which
' should be in the Libe. But no, the
idea is to sign and sign and sign
until you flunk the ex. It does help
to keep the class average down!
Once a person gets hold of the
book he wants, it's not at all sur
prising that he takes it out and

I
keeps it indefinitely. Hp knows that ;
if ho doesn't, there are about 99
chances to 1 that, he'll never again
get any nearer to it than Hie loan
desk reserved hook cards.
Yours very truly, Co-ed. !
