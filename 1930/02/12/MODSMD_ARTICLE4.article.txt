# LAGUNITA FIENDS DOOMED WITHOUT AID FROM PLUVIUS
## 
### 
"No Lagunita unless it rains,
hard!!"
Campus queeners, canoeists,
guitarists, and swimmers should
offer up prayers to the great god
Pluvius for the needed down
pours, according to the above
tragic edict forecast by J'-d
Throndson, varsity swimming
captain and chief canoe-renter
at the lioathouse.
The present level of the lake
is far below average, he said,
and the necessary overflow from
Searsville Lake will not be suffi
cient to raise it unless there is
heavy'rain between now and the
spring-time warm weather.
Despite the predictions of ba
ther Ricard of Santa Clara, dry
weather has continued since the
rain four weeks ago, with clear
skies forecast hv government
authorities for the next few
days.
