ALAS, POOR VORICK
(lather round, all ye brethren,
and shed a tear for the late Ilobert
Lyman Templeton, '20, who is be
ing buried and mourned daily in
the public prints. It's a sad case,
mates.
It seems that once upon a
time Mr. Templeton, who was
known to his friends as "Dink,"
was a very good track coach,
and had the habit of turning
out winning cinderpath teams
at Stanford University. In fact,
only last year, he produced his
third straight intercollegiate
championship outfit, besides
licking everything worth men
tioning on the Coast.
But lliis year, fellows, the youth
ful Mr. Templeton had the unparal
lelled temerity to schedule for his
charges some live track meets, en
gaging to tangle with the Los An
geles Athletic CIIII), Olympic Club,
the University of lowa, Southwest
ern Branch (sometimes known ;is
ilif University of Southern Cali- \
I'oruia), California, and Washing-;
ton.
From the first.*three nforemen-j
tioned aggregations have come, via
ili«' press, bold statements, slink
ing insinuations and subtle innu
ejidos, all to the elTect that it will
la* a rainy spring at Stanford as
far as track is concerned. Walter
Christie, the venerable California
coach, looking over his athletes !
and discovering two javelin-throw
ers, a two-miler, and three left
handed hurlers, broadcasts that the
Big Meet will be a toss-up., Only be
en use the University of Washing
ion clip sheet must have been lost
it; the mail lias Dink not yet heard
what the Lumberjacks from the
tall timber are going to do to us.
Several institutions (we name no
names, but. anyone interested may
obtain the desired information at
the Daily office) have a perennial
habit of winning track meets by
large margins on paper, and finish
ing in second place on the cinder
path and greensward. But seldom
have they been so outspoken as to
their superiority so early in the
season. To be sure, a perusal of
their rosters reveals a scintillating
array of 50-foot shot-putters, 4:20
milers, J): 15 sprinters, and 14-foot
pole vaulters, but if memory serves
us aright, such tilings have hap
pened before.
The Templeton front door is
suspiciously devoid of crepe.
Heart-broken mourners might
do well to kindly omit flowers
until they are sure the corpse
in really dead.

It seems that once upon a
time Mr. Templeton, who was
known to his friends as "Dink,"
was a very good track coach,
and had the habit of turning
out winning cinderpath teams
at Stanford University. In fact,
only last year, he produced his
third straight intercollegiate
championship outfit, besides
licking everything worth men
tioning on the Coast.
But lliis year, fellows, the youth

lelled temerity to schedule for his
charges some live track meets, en

Several institutions (we name no
names, but. anyone interested may
obtain the desired information at
the Daily office) have a perennial
habit of winning track meets by
large margins on paper, and finish
ing in second place on the cinder
path and greensward. But seldom
have they been so outspoken as to
their superiority so early in the
season. To be sure, a perusal of
their rosters reveals a scintillating
array of 50-foot shot-putters, 4:20
milers, J): 15 sprinters, and 14-foot
pole vaulters, but if memory serves
us aright, such tilings have hap

The Templeton front door is
suspiciously devoid of crepe.
Heart-broken mourners might
