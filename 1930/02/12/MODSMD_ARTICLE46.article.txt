### BY CHARLES RANDOLPH, '31 Sports Dept., Daily California 
BERKELEY, Feb. 11.- Ky Eb
right, University of California crew
coach faces a difficult problem this
spring. Here it is:
Developing a crew out of a group
of candidates including only four
lettermen, capable of traveling to
Lake Washington early in April
and defeating a veteran University
of Washington eight that finished
second in the I'oughkeepsie regat
ta last summer; and by doing this
run California's string of consecu
tive crew victories over the Hus
kies up to four.
Big Job for Coach
That is a large assignment for
any coach, but Hbriglit is tackling
the man-sized job in a manner that
indicates success, and despite the
comparative lack of letterinen, and
the loss of four of the best, oars
men ever developed at California,
material is abundant.
Missing from last year's shell
are Pete Donlon, hailed as the pre
mier stroke in the country, Wil
liam Thompson, Francis Frederick,
and Ward Von Tillow. The first
three rowed in the world's' cham
pion crew at i lie Olympic (ladies
in 1!)2S. Moon Mull-ins, varsity cox

[ swain, also is missing from the
i shell.
Last Year's Veterans
Lettermen who will be hard to
oust from their positions are Hu
bert Caldwell, Jack Brinck, Billy
Dally, and Jim Workman. Those
making the strongest bids for
I places in the varsity shell at pres
! ent include Bill Woodward, llar
; vey Granger, Lee Pope, Jack
j Knight, and Carlton Steiner of last
year's jayvee shell, and Dave Dun
lap, Bill Van Voorhies and Burton
Jastram, 1929 freshmen.
The loss of Donlon is perhaps
Ihe greatest blow to California's
hopes, but Jacobsen, Gregg, Hoi
man, and Salisbury are engaged in
a battle that should produce at
least one first-class stroke oar.
To Enter Regatta
California will send her varsity
<rew to the Poughkeepsie regatu
! in the summer, with the outcome
of the Washington races determin
ing the entrance of the freshman
i and jayvee shells.
Freshman Coach Russ Nagler is
well-pleased with the progress be
-1 ing made by the large turnout of
j freshman candidates.
