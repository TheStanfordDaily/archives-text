man sluggers were winning a five
inning game from Murlinganie l-ligli
School, 9 1o (!. The Burlingame
team, coached by Frank Wilton,
former Cardinal football star, was
simply unable to see Johnson's of
ferings, and only two were able to
conect at all.
In the second inning Delmas,
Triplett, and Irsfeld hit two-bag
gers in succession, and Livermore
and Saufley followed with singles,
four runs being scored during the

finished the game in the box for
the frosh by striking out two of the
high school players. During 1 his
