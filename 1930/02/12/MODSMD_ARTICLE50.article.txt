# LIGHT-HEAVY CLASS OFFERS PROBLEM TO BOXING COACH
## Maloney Names Tentative Team to Meet Cal Friday Night 
### 
With the light-heavyweight class
a decided problem, Boxing Coach
Harry Maloney last night put the
varsity boxing squad through a
strenuous workout in preparation
for the tournament with the Uni
versity of California which will be
staged in the Pavilion Friday night.
Hugh Keenan, the light-heavy
who battled against Davis Farm
last week, is definitely out of the
bouts Friday night, since the doc
tor forbids him to box for a week.
Several possibilities are open to
Maloney, hut in all probability Fred
Johnson will be moved up lo the
17-5-pound division.
Lineup Announced
Tentative lineup for the bouts
with California were announced by
Maloney last night, and include
either Hugh Israel or Len Kull
niann in the bantamweight, Paul
Maurer in the feather, Captain
Ralph Malcolm in the lightweight,
either Eastman or Wood in the
welter, Brown or Johnson in the
middleweight', Fred Voight in the
heavy, with the light-heavy divi
sion a problem.
Three exhibition bouts are like
wise on tap for' Friday, with Yuji
Imai, Fred Clover, and Dick Miller
slated to show their wares in the
no-decision matches. Lightening
the gloom which has to some ex
tent clouded the heavier divisions
is the rapid fashion in which Ed
Dillon, former boxing captain, is
rounding into shape.
