take a )!52 in 9 seconds after
trailing Shove most of the way.
J lis injured leg seems to lie all
right again, as he did not have to
favor it in the least. Wright is
suffering shin splints and may not

Club meet March 1, though lie
probably will be running again by
the end of the week.
George Grey, sophomore weight
man, made a nice toss of 141 feet
in the discus last night, as well as
