so it goes ... The first Spring
Fashion word from abroad — from London where
Men's Fashions are standardized, stabilized, etc. . . .
Word comes direct from an observer who witnessed
young University men at The Carlton Grill . . . and
High Gate master Tailors promptly respond with the
authentic University Sack Suit—-2 buttons, notch lapels,
high cut 5 button vest — straight hanging trousers in
gray flannels and cheviots, brown worsteds, arid
Donegals. With Hastings the first to say something
about them and show them — we invite your early
inspection. $
