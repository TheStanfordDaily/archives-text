# INSTRUMENTS BUILT IN PHYSICS DEPARTMENT FEATURE ACCURACY
## 
### BY PHILIP HUMPHREYS 
The fine technique of a watch-1
maker combined with the infinite I
skill of practical experience are
qualifications brought into play in |
the everyday job of S. W. Borrow, >
instrument-maker in lite Physics
Department. Borrow has been at ;
Stanford for ten years, having |
come here from the University of
Michigan with Dr. I). L. Webster,
executive head of the department.
Instruments that are accurate to I
unbelievably small gradations have
been turned out of Morrow's shop
whenever there has been need of i
equipment which would cost a j
small fortune to buy.
Borrow got his early training in ;
England and has been an expert
instrument-maker for ">2 years. He i
tells of the first job to which he
was assigned while still an ap
prentice: "I was a 'gentleman ap
prentice,' that is, I didn't have to
sweep the floors, but I didn't get
any wages. When my first job was
given tup, 1 was astonished. The
foreman gave me a lump of iron
about as big as my head and told |

me to file it away to nothing! II
took rue two weeks. But one of the
first things an apprentice had to
do was to learn to file; I learned.
After 7 years' apprenticeship, I was
given my certificate and I went to
work at Hatton Garden, the center
of the jewelers' trade in London.
And in 1 !M>7, I set for America, ar
riving during Christmas week."
In the tiny workshop in the
Physics building, Borrow lias more
than $2500 worth of tools and
equipment, including lathes, cali
pers of incredibly small calibra
tions, drills, punches, drawing in
struments, and nearly everything
that the imagination can picture.
In his spare time, Borrow makes
a hobby of making to his own de
sign such things as ash trays and
pedestals for desk writing sets; be
sides this he has made frames for
several (locks from a composition
material, resembling amber, called
redmanol. He has presented many
of these trinkets to friends for
keepsakes, birthday presents, and
the like.
