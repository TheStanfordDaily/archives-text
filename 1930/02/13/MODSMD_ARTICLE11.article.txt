### BY FRITZ GOODWIN 
11Itl'JlO sell-dubbed "standardized, unintelleclual nincQin/oops" from
* Stanford attacked the educational system of which they are a pari in
j debating the justification of English indictment of American education
i last night with three representatives from the University of Hawaii.
Donald 11. Layman, Dai Ho Chun, and Shigeo Yosliida of Hawaii,
| speaking on the negative side of the question, upheld the American
j system on the grounds that it is based on sound and worthy principles,

s> that present defects are being re
i moved.
Students Standardized
Wadieh S. Sliibley, speaking first
for Stanford, justified English
criticism through the use of the
product o!' American education as
I an example, mentioning the stand
! ardized nature of the college stu
dent. George Bodle furthered the
contention that all education is
being bent toward a professional
end, and deplored that "the cream
of the youthful intellects be wa
tered with an endless stream of
purposeless individuals" in Ameri
can institutions. Norman It. Tyre
concluded tin; Stanford arguments
with the point that too much em
phasis is placed upon organization
in the school system and not
enough attention to results desired.
Clever Rebuttals
The debate was featured through
out by clever rebuttal work, parti
cularly on the part of the Stanford
speakers. Layman's question as to
the continuance of such a system
if it were undesirable was an
swered by Bodle with the words:
"through ignorance, sir, pure ig
norance."
Tyre criticized women in col
leges for the fact that their pri
mary aim was to find a future hus
band, and was answered by
Yoshida, "If women can get a good
education and at Ihe same time a
good husband, their college educa
tion becomes an advantage."
The debate was a non-decision
affair.
