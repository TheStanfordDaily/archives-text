## 
### 
Nearly 1000 years ago Peruvian
11icas paid homage to l heir god, the j
Sum, with a majestic "Hymn to the J
Sun." A.I). the Stanford Band
will greet the advancing sun of;
spring with the same primitive I
hymn, the oldest existant piece of j
music native to America. Written j
in the pen (atonic scale, this ancient !
composition, which has just been j
obtained by the Stanford Band, is
a real throwback to the native reli
gious expression of America when i
iT was really the "New World."
Dr. Ambrose Itobles, famous j
Peruvian archaeologist, is the do
nor of the hymn, which lie recon
structed. It has bean played sev
eral times under his direction, but!
only one or two organizations in
litis country beside the .Cardinal'
band have copies of the piece, ac
cording to Director E. W. Martin.
Professor It. K. Flint, Stafford ;
'nl, author of the famous "Stanford .
Forever." march, is now engaged '
m scoring the composition. It will j
In played hv the band for the first'
time at the. spring concert, Profes-|
sor Martin says. The "Hymn to the j
Sun" is a very important addition i
to the band's growing collection of
carl.v Americana, which already in - j
eludes many rare native composi
tions.
