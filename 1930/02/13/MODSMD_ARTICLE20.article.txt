According to the new system,
there will he three positions on the
editorial staff and four on the
managerial open to juniors who
have been tryoutees for a year and
a half. On the editorial side, the
junior members will include Illus
tration Editor, Copy Editor, and
Managing Editor. On the mana
gerial staff, there will be Circula
tion Manager, General Advertising
Manager, San Francisco Advertis
ing Manager, and an Asistant Of
fice Manager, who will be ineligible
for the general managership.
Work for approximately two
years and a half will be necessary
before one can attain either the
editorship or managership awarded
to the holders of junior posts, bill
the work would be considerably
lighter than it is at present.
In the past, both stall's have, held
tryouts for sophomores, with only
the position of editor and manager
to be earned. No work was done
during the junior year.
