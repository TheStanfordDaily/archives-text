### BY BERNARD POLLARD 
"Hawaii in too satisfied with her
present status as a territory to de
sire statehood or independence,"
said Dai Ho Chung, ( Diversity of
Hawaii debater who spoke at Stan
ford last night. "The last governor
favored statehood but the majority
of Hawaiians favor a continuation
of the present arrangement. The
situation is comparable to the.
South before the Civil War. There
is a plantation culture."
"Hut in the Philippines, the
situation is different. They want
freedom. If one can judge the capa
bility of those islands by the ability
of students In the University of
Manila, then there can be no doubt
of their deserving independence,"
Chung said. He was one of a group
that toured the Orient on a Uni
versity of Hawaii good-will debat
ing team.
Although he is an American citi
zen by virtue of his birth in the
Hawaiian Islands, this is the first

time Chung ha ; visited the main
land. He is Chinese. Slilgeo Yo
shida, another of the forensic trio,
i an American citizen of Japa
nese extraction. Donald H. Lyman,
the only Anglo-Saxon on the team,
is a citizen of Canada.
Many Races
"The cosmopolitan nature of our
group is typical of the t'niversity
of Hawaii student body as a
whole," Chung said. "Thirty-six
per cent of the student body is
Anglo-Saxon, twenty-five per cent
Japanese, twenty per (tent Chinese,
and the rest are native Hawaiians,
Koreans, Portuguese, etc. There is
no race feeling.
"Stanford has a wonderful school
spirit," Dai Ho Chung concluded.
In Hawaii students live about the
town. There are no dormitories and
no fraternity or sorority houses.
Yoshida and I saw our first soror
ity house at the t'niversity of
Washington, It was quite an ex
perience."
