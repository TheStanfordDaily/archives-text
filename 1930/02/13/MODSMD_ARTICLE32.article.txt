# FOR WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

In daring In criticize a faculty member or anything a faculty
member dues, the student newspaper risks being called sophnmoric,
insolent, and a purveyor ol cheap cynicism. I'rofessorial dignity is
a tender thing.
So the course of the student newspaper, in its relation to the
taculty, is trnublous. < )n one hand, it must satisfy those who wish
to see a publication of real journalistic merit, and on the other hand
it i-. expected to meet the demands of a second clique which knows
nothing whatever about the process of newspaper making, yet insists
nil dictating the simplest rules.
Some weeks ago the Daily brought the fearsome wrath of the
executive head of a certain department flown upon its humble eaves.
\ hard working copy editor was the unwitting inspiration for this
outburst. I hat worthy had the audacity to change, slightly, the lead
on a story which had previously received the < >.K. of the aforemen
tioned executive head.
\lthough this change did not in any sense alter the import of
the story, the l).\N.v regretted its impertinence. It was duly humble
and duly contrite.
I icing duly humble and dul\ contrite, however, was not enough,,
oltiminous letters from the executive head in question appeared in
the editor's mail. (.Icing ever fearful of those hateful words, "soplio
mnric" and "cheap cynic," the editor answered these missives with
all the editorial humbleness and tact which he could command.
I he executive head, however, was not to be placated bv a mere
desire to be obliging.
This was his first demand : "I must therefore repeat my previous
tatcment that until the Stanford Daily guarantees in writing that
no articles shall be printed except in a form approved by a member
ol this department, the department must refuse unconditionally to i
release any stories for the Staxford Daily."
Such a demand was. of course, nothing less than the rather bald
expression ot a desire to throttle fin a modest way) the freedom
of this press. That was irksome enough to those who have the mi
nutest quantity of journalistic spirit. !'>ut this newspaper, ever wish- i
ing to avoid being called sophomoric and cynical, was willing to '
stifle its journalistic spirit to the extent of agreeing to such a proviso [
with regard to feature stories. That, the Daily felt, was signing its
life away to the cause of discretion.
Hut that, it developed, was not enough. In the executive head's!
next manifesto he said : "It is also understood that the headlines are !
to be included as parts of the article and that on this basis the article I
as a whole is to be submitted to the member of the department re-1
leasing the interview, and that after his approval is obtained, there
i' to be no change except in the kipping off of parts of the last para- |
graph."
I hose who have the slightest inkling fit* how a newspaper is put
together should know that it is utterly impossible for a newspaper
to submit headlines to anyone for an ( >.K. The demands of make-up
and the speed at which journalistic work must be done absolutely
preclude any such acti<ml
I lie Daily, finally losing rill fear of the epithets already men
tioned. answered the executive head in that vein.
I he executive head lost his temper and called one person in par
ticular on the Daily stall* an "insufferable cad."
Professorial dignity, forsooth! Imagine an executive head say-!
ing such things. Tsk ! Tsk !
I his editorial, as anyone who has read this far may have gath
ered. is not written for the general public. Ii is written to anyone
whose ideas of fairness and reasonableness coincide with those of
the executive head in question.
This newspaper strives at all times lo be accurate and fair. If it j
fails in these thing- (humans err sometimes) it is willing to correct
it< error. Ihe Dajlv cannot and will not promise more than that.
I he Daily welcomes criticism and suggestions, but it will suffer
no dictatorial pressure. The Daily is a newspaper at all times, and
never the mouthpiece of any individual or set of individuals whose
desire for power exceeds their sense of proportion.
