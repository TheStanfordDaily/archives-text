Daily Editorial)
I For several years college cheer
leaders, both East and West, have
complained about the lack of en
thusiasm at pep rallies. Washing
ton is not excepted in this respect.
Here we have, apparently, a reac
tion against snch demonstrations.
Yell leaders continually register
complaints.
In going into the matter, several
points crop out. First, it seems to
be the opinion of certain sophisti
cated or pseudo-sophisticated col
legians that yelling for Joe Goon is
no longer "the thing to do." Sec
ondly, it. appears that other stu
dents consider a refusal t.o exert
one's lungs gross treason to one's
college. A third group, due to the
influence of the broad publicity
given college life, consider such
doubtful sports as pep rallies too
childish for them.
This last group, together with
the pseudo-sophisticated students,
are running the rallies. The cause
may be summed up in short as
self-consciousness. II is self-con
sciousness brought on by publicity.
Have you ever gone to a movie and
seen a picture of a cheering sec
tion in a college stadium? And
haven't, you onsidered it. a bit
s-lly?
Perhaps after all there are ways
of showing loyalty besides the vocal
method. Perhaps—and probably—
the reaction to the rallies is not a
sign of entire lack of interest in
fdlege athletic loyalty.
