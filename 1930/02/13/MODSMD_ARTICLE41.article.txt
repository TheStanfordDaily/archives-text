THE EMBEZZLERS. By Valentine
Kataev. Translation by L.
Zarine. Lincoln MacVeagh, The
Dial Press, New York. 1929. At
Stanford Bookstore.
Russian art bears an unmistak
able .stamp. The distinguishing
quality, is perhaps upon last analy
sis, exaggerated truth. A Russian
writer looks at life, isolates one
attribute which impresses him at
the moment, and then culls ex
perience for other examples of the
same peculiar feature.
"The Embezzlers" is clever,
mildly sardonic. It is a story of
two soviet accountants, who ac
cording to a popular new Russian
custom, abscond with soviet money.
Most, of the book tells of their
headless adventure financed with
government funds. Wine and wo
men have always been the chief
masculine diversions. These two
are theirs. Chief Accountant Philip
Sfephariovitch Prohoroff and young
Ivan, two heavily cargoed vodka
boats in a storm of heedless pleas
ure, stagger through two months of
drunken extravagance until their
money is gone and they are appre
hended.
As they are taken off to jail,
Prohoroff turned around "and saw
his wife and daughter who were
running after them on the edge of
the pavement: one stout, excited,
and wiping her face with a ker
chief; the-other young, slender, iii
a little orange-coloured knitted hat,
in a pool' blue coat, no goloshes,
frozen, pretty, with frosty wisps oi
hair, and the tears freezing as they
dripped down her glowing cheeks."
Tints the book ends.
if one is fond of naivete, one
will find this book enjoyable. It3
artful artlessness (if such a para

| dox b possible) is pleasing.
ONE LOVELY MORON. By Lucian
Cary: Doubleday, Doran Co.,
New Yor'k. 1930.
If Mr. Cary should choose to
apply himself, lie undoubtedly
would he able to turn out a good
| book. As it is, however, he seems
to have had several amusing ideas
and there it ends.
For its type—that of the light
love story "One Lonely Moron" is
'superior. The plot- is original; a
professor of Applied Psychology
falls in love with a beautiful girl
whose I.Q. is 75, apparently
means that she is a moron. Mr.
Cary writes in a fluent, easy style,
Parts of the book are extremely
; funny, and it never drags.
The hook is easy reading, in fact
too easy. One hour is sufficient to
spend on it. Aside from the plot
; there is nothing to it. The dialogue
'is atrocious. Mr. Cary appears to
have sat himself down, after his
b illiant idea, written as fast as he
i could write, and sent his manu
script off to the publishers.
One thing must be said in Mr.
Oarv's defense. He writes about
! college but he manages to avoid
all glaring exaggerations which
j other contemporary authors seem
• to consider so necessary in depict
ing campus life. The college in
"One Lovely Moron" is quite true
to the actual institute of learning,
which is a great relief.
There is np doubt, that "One
Lovely Moron" is amusing. Those
who have read "The Duke Steps
Out," will admit that Lucian Cary
is entertaining, and though his
latest book lacks in both ideas and
style, it will help to pass a divert.-
i ing hour.
