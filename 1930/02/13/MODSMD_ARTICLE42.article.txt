## THIS IS A "STRONG" CASE 
### 
Tlir» Editor, Sir:
1 have delayed writing to you bn
cause I hesitated mentioning ku<•!i
a delicate subject. But I am a I'm id
t hat I si in 11 have to write. I t'eel
too deeply on this mutter lo keep
silence longer.
Someone in one of my classes is
a garlic fiend. At least, if lie is
not a fiend, he has the habit. 1 I
come to class in the morning and
breathe garlic-tinted air for an
hour. Don't think that I am preju
diced against garlic. By no means.
I merely do not like it second
hand.
I have a few suggestions to make
for this person's benefit:

1. Stop eating garlic (It's almost
immoral anyway lo oat il for break
fast ).
2. Mat onions instead. Onions are
I lie lesser oi' Hie two evils.
IT.se Listerine, and he popular.
4. Don't come to class.
1 do hope that the offender will
take these suggestions in the
spirit in which they are given. I
Lad to say something. It's really an
awful strain to try and hold your
breath in class for fifty minutes.
Ami at eight o'clock 1 never feel
myself anyway, so I could do nice
ly without tiie nauseating odor.
Sincerely yours,
A Student.
