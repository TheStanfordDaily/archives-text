# IRONIC EXAMPLES OF MODERN PERSPECTIVE
## (Daily Princetonian Editorial) 
### 
The value of' an education in elec
tric a. 1 engineering is set at a very
high figure by Robert Nealy, a Port
land, Oregon, youth. "IT any person
will put me through the Coyne
Electrical School of Chicago, I will
work for him the rest of my life
. . . or do anything he may want me
to," he announced recently.
The history of past ages is light
ed with the stories of many brave
souls who fought hard battles and
made great sacrifices to satisfy
thirst for learning. Nothing is more
genuinely thrilling than the record
of those who enriched their own
knowledge and that of the world in
spite of adverse circumstances and
actively hostile public opinion. But
in this age when the democratic
ideal of "education for all" is ac
cepted with a fervor which inspires
great public libraries, millions of
dollars for scholarships and a vast
amount of time and energy spent
in making culture available to the
masses, it. surely seems that Mr.
Nealy has offered to make an en
tirely unnecessary and very foolish
sacrifice. When we read that the
schooling for which he is willing
to bind all the rest of his life would

! cost n total of $295, the whole af
; fair seems absurd, unbelievably
Quixotic. If Mr. Nealy finds any
body selfish and perverted enough
1 to accept bis offer (which we hope
! lie won't) he lias sold his freedom
! for something utterly insignificant
beside it in value.
The wider horizons, the greater
: opportunities for liberty which
learning brings have been the in
spiration of all those who sought
| it throughout the ages. Education
i means independence, not servi
tude. That a man should sign away
' bis independence for that very edu
cation seems to us about, the most
ironic example of distorted per
| spective that modern life could
I offer.
