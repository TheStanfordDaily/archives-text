TUESDAY NIGHT'S LUCK
BE DAMNED!
ll' the head man of basketball
i-hows, spectacles, tragedies, and
burlesques on the Farm ever takes
to shaking «lit-»* for a living, he had
bettor confine his "rolling hones"
iicl ivil ies to Tuesday night's alone,
lie would rake in a fortune in no
time, without a doubt.
At least, he would if his luck
ran the way of his basketball
five's good fortunes during the
present hardwood season. For
in looking back over the 1930
list of tilts played in the Farm
Pavilion, one is astounded by
the fact that the Cardinal
cayers have not dropped a
single game on Tuesday eve
nings.
Which games were far from set
ups, such quintets as Pacific, Olym
pic Club, St. Ignatius, nnd Santa
Clara invading the campus on
I hose occasions.
The Card team has been called
nil "in and out" aggregation, being
unbeatable (.n one night, and per
forming lil<e an out tit of blind imp
pets on the very next evening.
Strange as ii may seem, the Farm
players have niwavs been "in" on
Tuesdays.
In this respect, Stanford is
like the Saturday Night Kid—
always "out" on the week
ends !
The sad part about the whole ,
matter is that the week-end
games are Conference tilts,
the ones that really count,
while Tuesday night contests
are mere practice affairs. Con
sequently, Stanford has just
about cinched the cellar posi
tion on the P.C.C.
Three new records, pro and con,
have been established by this
year's erratic varsity. And again,
believe il or not, the only "pro"
part was made 011 a Tuesday, when
Stanford piiled up 55 points against
Pacific.
The "con" records, missing 17
out of 19 free throws, and allowing
U.C.L.A. to toss in •>" points in a
single game (not. a series), were
hung up during the regular week
end spectacles.
This being the ease, why did not
the H.A.C. use foresight and sched
ule every Conference game on
Tuesdays? Perhaps the athletic
loids can get Cal to change the
next two Big Series tilts from Sat
in day to the middle of the week.
According to their past record,
the Card cagers are due to be all
washed up when they tangle with
the Golden Bear in the Oakland
Auditorium two (lays hence. They
have already played their "in'
game of the week agaiusl Santa
Clara.
As in the well-known Cin
derella tale, the clock has
struck twelve and the last of
the Tuesday night festivities is
over. Then, too, none of the
Cards lost a shot out on the
court, so there can be no prince
to save the day.
However, this is an enlight
entd age. The DAILY does not
believe in fairy stories. Super
stition is a bunch of tommy
rot. And, strange as it may
seem, the Card cagers are go
ing to trot out on the floor
Saturday night to win—to beat
Cal for the first time since
1925. The whole campus is
clamoring for a victory. And
the DAILY has a hunch that
once again the Cardinal will
whip the Gold and Blue, Tues
lay night's luck be damned!

in looking back over the 1930
list of tilts played in the Farm
Pavilion, one is astounded by
the fact that the Cardinal
cayers have not dropped a

In this respect, Stanford is
like the Saturday Night Kid—
always "out" on the week
ends !
The sad part about the whole ,
matter is that the week-end
games are Conference tilts,
the ones that really count,
while Tuesday night contests
are mere practice affairs. Con
sequently, Stanford has just
about cinched the cellar posi
tion on the P.C.C.
Three new records, pro and con,
have been established by this
year's erratic varsity. And again,
believe il or not, the only "pro"
part was made 011 a Tuesday, when
Stanford piiled up 55 points against
Pacific.
The "con" records, missing 17
out of 19 free throws, and allowing
U.C.L.A. to toss in •>" points in a
single game (not. a series), were
hung up during the regular week
end spectacles.
This being the ease, why did not
the H.A.C. use foresight and sched
ule every Conference game on
Tuesdays? Perhaps the athletic
loids can get Cal to change the
next two Big Series tilts from Sat
in day to the middle of the week.
According to their past record,
the Card cagers are due to be all
washed up when they tangle with
the Golden Bear in the Oakland
Auditorium two (lays hence. They
have already played their "in'
game of the week agaiusl Santa
Clara.
As in the well-known Cin
derella tale, the clock has
struck twelve and the last of
the Tuesday night festivities is
over. Then, too, none of the
Cards lost a shot out on the
court, so there can be no prince
to save the day.
However, this is an enlight
entd age. The DAILY does not
believe in fairy stories. Super
stition is a bunch of tommy
rot. And, strange as it may
