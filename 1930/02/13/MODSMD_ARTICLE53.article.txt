# Semi-Pros Down Cards, 5-3
## INFIELD WITHOUT CAPTAIN LAIRD AT THIRD IS RAGGED Stanford Errors Coupled With 7 Hits Win Game For Visiting Team 
### 
Minus the services of Captain
Bill Laird at third base, the varsity
infield didn't function very well
| yesterday, and coupled with four
infield errors and seven good hard
lilts, the McMullin and McNamara
baseball team won the ball game,
5-3. Taylor lasted the full nine in
nings, and turned in a creditable
performance fanning four and
clamping down perfectly on the
; matter of free tickets.
i There was a marked lack of
\ spirit both from the players on the
I field and from the Kquad over in
| the dug-out. Johnson contributed
| two errors at short, Churchill made
; one, and Goodell took his foot off
j first base too soou one time to
| chalk up another donation. Goodell,
{ l.y the way, experienced quite a
; little difficulty in standing on his
i base all a'ftdrnoon, Three of four
j times the M and M batters were
i nearly safe when the flrst-sacker
left the bag almost too early; in
fact, one time he had to tag the
runner a little way down the base
line. Kelly turned in a nice game
■ at third, but had a little hard luck
j on foul flies.

| rung ui> in the next canto when
1 Johnson got on by an error and
' was brought around by successive
I bingles by Goodell and Rintala.
! Hunken shone at bat with three
! safeties out of four trips to the
I platter.
