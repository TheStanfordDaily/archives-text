# DEVASTATING DANNY . . .
## Outfielder Wins 1929 Batting Crown in International League With .371 ; Earns Chance With Cubs 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Danny Taylor,, who looks some
thing like the pugnacious Hack
Wilson, will get another tryout
with the Cubs this spring, which
may or miiy not mean something
to you, dear reader, but is very im
portant to the Cubs. Danny (who
is not to be confused with "Dum
my" Taylor, famous Old-timer) was
purchased from Memphis a year ago
by the Wrigleyites, but didn't last
long in the Windy City, being
shipped soon to Rending of the
International League where he
made an enviable record as an out
fielder and slugger.
In 125 games for the Keys, Tay
lor batted .371, leading the league
in that respect. He scored 113 runs,
made 158 hits for a total base mark
of 2ii4, and gathered 34 doubles, 9
triples, and 18 homers. He was
walked 78 times, struck out 47,
stole 3G bases, and batted in 90
runs. In a league which included
such famous former major-leaguers
as Tris Speaker, Billy Southworth,
W'hiley Witt, and Wally Pipp.

Danny swung such a lively bat that
no other regular came within 20
points of him.
It might he observed in passing
that olie Joe Babbitt of Toronto
was the leading basestealer in the
international, and that Mr. Fallen
stein of Newark and Mr. Signor of
Buffalo each had a batting average
of .000, and both played in more
than ten games, too! Which was
exactly Danny Taylor's batting
average with the Cubs in 1929, only
he appeared in only two games.
I'm wagering one (1) Mexican 50c
piece that Danny Taylor bats bet
ter than that, if given a trial with
Chicago after the season opens in
1930.
