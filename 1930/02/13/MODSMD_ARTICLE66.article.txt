# FROSH CAGERS GO TO U.C. SATURDAY FOR SECOND GAME
## 
### 
Meeting California in the; second j
iof their three-game series, the J
' Stanford freshman quintet will
j journey to Berkeley Saturday night j
i to try to make it two straight on I
the Cub cagers, when they tangle |
'at 0:45 o'cloek in the preliminary!
| to the varsity contest.
The Card yearlings hold the ad- '
| vantage because of the one-point j
I victory that they scored over the i
j Bear frosh early in the season.
! However, Coach Bradshaw saw the
[ California team outplay the St. Ig
natius babes Tuesday night and
I since t lie Ignatians have a victory
i over Stanford to their credit, he is 1
J expecting a lot of tough opposition
j for Saturday night. The Card do
! feat is the only contest that the
U.C. hoop artists have dropped this
J season.
