# PROFESSOR McBAIN REVEALS LIFETIME RESEARCH IN SOAP
## 
### Philip Humphreys 
For 21 years, Professor J. W. Mo
Bain, <>l the Chemistry department,
has been doing research concerned,
principally, with the manufacture
oi' soap. He knows soap from cocoa
nut oil to mutton tallow.
"While the first recognized soap
factory was in France in the 12th
century, ruins of a plant have been
excavated in Pompeii.
"Since earliest times, soap-mak
ing has been a father-to-son propo
sition," lie said. "There was no sci
entifically accurate' method of put
ting the component parts together
to attain a given result,." It is Dr.
Mc√üain's work to put the manufac
ture of soap on a scientific basis.
A pamphlet, which he prepared,
has been used as a "Bible" by a
large soap-making concern in the
East.
"tinder the present system, it
requires 14 days to make a cake of
soap," he continued. "There are
five different shapes in which soap
can exist, but there must be a com
bination of alkaline fat such as is
found in the animal fats. For soaps
made from vegetable oils, there
must be added some alkali such as
caustic soda or a potassium com
pound.
"Most people do not understand
the chemical actiton of soap. It
forms an emulsion with the water,
preferably warm, and forms a film
around the dirt particles and car
ries them away when the water is
rinsed out."
