As every tweed coat should be! This means they're
absolutely rainproof as well as windproof. And it
adds an appreciable difference to the wearing
I qualities. Glen Martins are of imported English
j
tweeds, good looking patterns made with plenty
of sweep . And they have the Derrymore Raglan
cut that has won a deserved favoritism among well
dressed college men. Well worth seeing â€” and
wearing at $29.50. Exclusive at the City of Paris
