## Opponents of Eighteenth Amendment Assail Law in Liquor Committee Meet Charge Speakeasies Lead Youth Into Corruption; Would Prefer Saloons 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13 (A 3 ).
Led by four determined women, op
ponents of the Eighteenth Aniendment
today related to the House judiciary
committee stories of crime, corruption,
and debauchery which they charged
resulted from the prohibition law.
The women set out to refute claims
that the women of tlie country favored
the dry statutes. The men witnesses,
among them former Senator Bruce, of
Maryland, backed them up with
charges that the greatest crime wave
o! history bad resulted from the
Eighteenth Amendment.
Approximately 200 men and women
in the audience applauded declarations
by the witnesses so frequently that
( hairnian Graham of the committee
said he would have to ask those who
continued to leave.
Voters Had No Voice
Representative Mary 'I. Norton, a
New Jersey Democrat, vigorously as
sailed the dry amendment. She charged
the voters had no voice in its adop
tion and advocated a national refer
endum.
Mrs. ( harles 11. Sabin, a former
Republican National Commit lee-wom
an from New York, declared that co
educational and uncontrolled speak
easies had replaced the corner saloon
and were worse, because they sold
liquor to children. She represented the
Women's Organization for National
I'rohibition Reform.
Demands Repeal
Mrs. David Holmes Morton of
Brooklyn, N.Y., secretary of the
\\ omen's ( ommittee for Repeal of
the Eighteenth Amendment, demanded
an "unequivocal repeal of prohibition
because it undertook to interfere with
the personal habits of the individual."
"This enterprise," she said, "is spe
cifically denied the government by the
bill of rights without which there
WO uld be no constitution."
Charging that national prohibition
has failed of its purpose, Miss M.
Louise Cross of New York, chairman
ol the Women's Moderation League,
asserted that "young people are drink
ing liquor obtained in speakeasies, at
madhouses, and from bootleggers who
cannot be regulated."
Youth Destroyed
"The youth of our country is being
destroyed by these unregulated and
illegitimate purveyors of liquor," she
said.
Asserting that he believed it an
impossibility to repeal the Eighteenth
Amendment entirely, former Senator
Bruce supported the Sabath resolution
which would permit local option by
the states under federal supervision.
He said that there should be some
better way under which liquor could
be controlled instead of returning the
saloons to their former corners. He
added, however, if "I were put on my
choice between the old saloon and
prohibition, I would take the old sa
loon."
Second Day of Hearing
The former senator, one of the most
severe critics of prohibition in C'on
gress since its enactment, declared that
hew ould rather have a "raven perched
upon my bedpost than to be compelled
to turn for consolation to some of the
hybrid preacher - politicians who arc
doing all they can in support of the
Eighteenth Aniendment."
