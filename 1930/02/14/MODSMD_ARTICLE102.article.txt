—Oji his eighty-third birthday, Feb
ruary 11, Thomas A. Edison was
still holding out against this aerial
age,
, Nevet' has he consented to take
any aerial trip." Recently he demon
strated his consistency by refusing
a ride in a blimp.
That recalled li is one venture in
aeronautics to his laboratory as
sistants here. It was disastrous and
almost terminated his career in
1884, when lie was only )57.
Aviation's lure to the then young
and impecunious genius was a one
thousand dollar prize posted by
James Gordon Bennett for a suc
cessful flying machine.
Edison sel to work on a rocket
contrivance. Several reels of ticker
tape, soaked in an explosive, were
led mechanically into a spark
chamber, the resulting series of ex
plosions furnishing the motive
power for the propwllerless craft.
On the tryout day for the ma
chine several attempts to make it
11 y were unsuccessful. Finally the
KO-pound plane sustained itself in
the air several minutes.
Just when success seemed as
sured an explosion occurred. The
inventor's hair and eyebrows were
burned and the machine was
wrecked.
That ended Edison's aeronautical
activities*, lie never has taken a
ride in the air and has not been
active in aviation development. In
his birthday interview in 1!M)N Edi
son predicted airplanes never
would have commercial value.
Among questions submitted to
him by reporters on his birthday
there invariably is one asking his
opinion on aviation, but lie never
has given an enthusiastic answer.
Edison's refusal of the invitation
to ride in the blimp took one writ
ten word. It was "no," penciled at
Ihe bottom of the invitation.
