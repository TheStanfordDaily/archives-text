### John Jernegan 
Students who spend their entire
undergraduate career at Stanford
must yield tlie palm scholastic-ally
to the junior college transfers who
do their lower-division work else
where. Such is tlx' efl'ect of a state
ment in the Faculty Bulletin by
Registrar Pearce Mitchell and
Professor Walter Crosby Fells of
the Department of. Education.
Measured by the Thorndike in
telligence tests the ability of trans
fers is markedly above that of stu
dents of junior standing who en
tered as freshmen, the bulletin
stated. The previous academic rec
ords of the two classes of students
give the same results. After the
first quarter at Stanford the junior
college students show steadily in
creasing superiority over the "na
tive" students.
Average Ages High
.Information on the average
length of time required for obtain
ing scholastic degrees is also con
tained in the Faculty Bulletin. Rec
ords show that most students do
not get an A.lt. degree before tlie
age of 25, with 29 being the usual
age for an A.IVI. and 35 for a doc
tor's degree.
Some persons have received
Ph.D. degrees at the age of 23
while others have not obtained that
honor before 5(5. It usually requires
a span of four years to get an
A.M. after having received a bache
lor's degree, and 10 years generally
elapse after that before a Ph.D. is
obtained, according to the records
of tiie University.
