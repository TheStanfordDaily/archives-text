## 
### 
Hard hit by injuries, the wrest- j
lin a team under the direction of
Coach R. L. Nicholson is neverthe- I
less training faithfully with the .
hopes of making a clean sweep in
all the bouts of the return match
with the team from the Berkeley
Y.M.C.A., which will be staged in
Encina Gymnasium tomorrow night.
Two light-heavyweight wrestlers,
Cordry and Janin, will be unable
to compete Saturday, while Perry,
a lightweight, is likewise out of
the meet due to a slight infection.
Notwithstanding these losses,
Coach Nicholson is confident his i
squad will repeat its recent tri
umph over the transbav matmen.
