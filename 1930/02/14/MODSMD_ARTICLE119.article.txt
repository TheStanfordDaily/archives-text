to relieve London's traffic congestion
by making use of the Thames.
Hack in Shakespeare's day the rivei
was (tne oi the principal passenger
thoroughfares, of the metropolis,
I bailies boatmen, err ing passengers
it]) and down or across the river, were
as numerous then as taxi drivers now.
Jhiring the past century, however,
various efforts to capitalize the pas
senger traffic possibilities of the
Thames haye met with little success.
In 1840 a service ol seven steamers
was established I,\ the London, West
minster and \ anxhall Steamboat Com
pany, and steamer trallic grew rapidly
enough to encourage the organisation
ol rival concerns.
