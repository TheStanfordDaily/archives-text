# WALTER JOHNSON AND HIS WASHINGTON SENATORS..........
## 
### Fes Murray, '16 
With all due respect to the famous
painting that hangs in the Metropoli
tan Museum, showing (ieneral Wash
ington and his men pushing their way
in boats through the cakes of ice in the
Delaware to slip a fast one over on
a bunch of I lessians on the other side,
the rowing technique shown by the
bow oar is bad, number three is about
to catch a crab, and the coxswain has
lost his megaphone. The Washington
crew could show those revolutionary
heroes something about crossing the
Delaware, but what we all want to
know is "can the Washington base
ball club come out of the slump that
held it back all last season, and cross
the Delaware of Despond into the

i Promised Land of more Victories and
maybe another pennant?"
The Senators finished in the second
division last year, possibly because
they were picked by two of our most
famous baseball experts to win the
pennant and probably because only
four of their regulars batted .300 or
better and only two of their pitchers
•could win as many as ten games while
I several of them had no trouble at all
in losing that many.
(loose (loslin. the National's best
hitter, in fact the best hitter in the
American league iu 1028, fell off 91
points in his batting, while others were
likewise afflicted. Sad Sam Jones,
w ho won 17 games in 1928 while losing
seven, could only win nine while losing

tin.' same number last year.
All in all, it was a rather dreary
year for Manager Walter Johnson and
his men. \hout the only blokes whose
names appear on the club roster whose
work was consistently good were Nick
-\lt rock and A 1 Schacht, the come
dians, and ( lark Griffith, the president,
i Ciri I*!'s work on the <> 11 links was
1 really sensational, and while he did
r not make another hole-in-one as he did
in 1928, he approached close to par on
! many a tough course.
1 Now ii only the Nationals could
make a. grand recovery from the traps
and hunkers oi 1929! Many oil the
'team are addicts of the Scotch pas
time. K-uel, Rice, (joslin, Johnson,
and others, swing a mean niblick. I tut

what they need is a "Murderers' Row - '
to row that old boat over the river into
the first division ! Maybe this new
MUithpaw, I•-<I Wineapple, is just the
man they need. A portsider with a
monicker like that should he very
good or very awfu'. So up and at
'em, Washingtonians! I.et Mr. Hard
Cider pilch, and then soak the old
apple.

make a. grand recovery from the traps
and hunkers oi 1929! Many oil the

what they need is a "Murderers' Row - '

the rowing technique shown by the
bow oar is bad, number three is about
to catch a crab, and the coxswain has
lost his megaphone. The Washington

heroes something about crossing the
Delaware, but what we all want to
know is "can the Washington base
ball club come out of the slump that
held it back all last season, and cross
the Delaware of Despond into the

maybe another pennant?"
The Senators finished in the second
division last year, possibly because
they were picked by two of our most
famous baseball experts to win the
pennant and probably because only
