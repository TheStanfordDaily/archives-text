# CARD SONGS TO BE RE-WORDED
## Committee of Six Named To Consider Words 
### 
In order to prevent the necessity of
having to sing songs that particularly
pertain to the University of California
at football games with oilier colleges,
and vice versa, Stanford Steinbeck ap
pointed a committee of six yesterday
to study over the old discarded songs
and select a few for each occasion.
The student body president cited the
inappropriatcness of such songs as
" The Cardinal Is Waving" at a L'.S.C.
or Washington game, and yet the ne -
cessity of singing them at the present
time to avoid repetition of the few
"impartial" songs that Stanford has.
The committee is to consist of Ju
liet Thorner, chairman, Etneline Nol
len, Mary Lee Richmond, Ralph Wal
lace. Frank Krlin, and George McKce.
It will attempt particularly to find
songs that |>crtaiii to no particular
university and can be sung on any
occasion.
