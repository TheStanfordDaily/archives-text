"Those of you who read the St.
James' version of the Bible, today,
liltle realize the trials and endless
efforts which were undergone be- ,
fore this translation could tie
made," declared John Howell, San
Francisco book collector, who
spoke last night in the Women's ;
Clubhouse, under the auspices of j
the Stanford University Press.
Mr. Howell paid great tribute to I
the printing press. "If we had had
the printing press at the time of j
Jesus, Christianity would have j
spread immeasurably farther, and ,
the difference would be felt even
today," lie said. "And speaking of
, presses," lie continued, "I am sure !
I that Stanford lias a very fine one."
Mr. liowell illustrated his talk
j with very interesting original and
facsimile copies of the various
translations, all of which are in
his own collection, and are very
rare.
