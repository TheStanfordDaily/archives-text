# FRENCH NAVAL GROUP REPORTS TONNAGE NEEDS
## Tardieu Demands 700,000 Tons; Japan Seeks New Gun Limit Parity With France" Is Claim of Italians 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 13 (A 3 ).—The long
I expected French pronouncement of
• naval needs was made today, setting a
! figure of 724,479 tons by December 31,
j 1936, as the basis on which the dcle-
I gation would debate.
The Japanese delegation also made
j public an outline of its policies, ex
: pressing willingness to agree to a
| holiday in capital ship construction
i until 1936, and favoring reduction in
j battleship tonnage to 25,000 tuns and
| in gun caliber to 14 inches.
I The American delegation did not
| greet the statement of Premier An
-1 dre Tardieu with great delight, but
I was pleased because the French fig
| ures by the complete and definite na
j ture al least provided a working basis
on which agreement could be sought.
Demand Parity
The Italian delegation also was dis
appointed in the high total of French
fleet requirements, and Dino Grandi,
j having proclaimed parity with France
|as the watchword of Italian policy,
| presumably may announce similar fig
ures as the Italian needs. That, if car
ried out. would necessitate Italy's
j doubling her present fleet if Franco-
Italian parity were to be reached dur
! ing the life of the proposed London
i treaty.
It was learned authoritatively to
i night that Premier Tardicu's interpre
' tation of the French demand for
j tonnage figures is that France will not
j surrender her naval security merely to
i aid an agreement between Great Brit
| ain and the United States.
The French leader maintains that
! France is not fully protected by three
j international pacts. He affirms that
j the League of Nations covenant is
! rendered ineffective by Article Sixteen,
j the Locarno treaty, by failing to men
; tion naval matters, and the Kellogg
| I Jriand pact by having no "teeth."
lie gave these points of comment
j before going to Paris tomorrow to
face a critical debate in the French
I Chamber of Deputies.
