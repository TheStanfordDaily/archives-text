The white ghost of Palm Drive
will no longer haunt Stanford
motorists hurrying home from
the city in time for eight o'-
clocks, and members of the Five
Hundred "giving it the gun" to
heat lock-outs. The familiar
white roadster driven by John
Olsen, former campus cop, has
been taken out of service and
sold to Kurt Widmer of Palo
Alto.
Although the color and license
number of the car remain the
same, the offcial status given it
by Olsen's badge is lost, and stu
dent drivers need no longer dread
tin sight of a white phantom in
the shadows of the arboretum.
