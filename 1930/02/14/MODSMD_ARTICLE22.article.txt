# COTTRELL OUTLINES REASONS FOR CHICAGO'S PRESENT MONEY CRISIS
## 
### Rawson Holmes 
The present financial crisis in
the city of Chicago was outlined
by Professor Edwin Angell Cottrell
of the Political Science Department
to a Daily reporter yesterday, as
being similar to that of a man who
has borrowed money beyond the
limit of his resources.
"Any city," Cottrell stated, "has
the legal capacity of borrowing to
a certain percentage of its as
sessed valuation. Chicago has
reached I he saturation point of I his
power. It has borrowed money be
yond the extent of the last reas
sessment of its propc rty, and as
that reassessment was set too high
in the first place, Chicago's credit
has been killed.

"The administration has spent
millions of dollars during the last
fiscal year that should have been
saved until the end of the year to
keeii their books balanced. This

t put tlietn in (he hole because of the !
fact tluil a large portion of last
year's taxes could not be collected. I
It was a political blunder on the
part of the administration.
"There are only two things that j
can bo done to remedy the situa
tion," the professor continued. I
"First, next year's taxes may be I
collected in advance. This was at- j
tempted by the Strawn Committer j
with little success. The other soln- !
tion is to obtain loans from private j
individuals and bankers in antici-j
; pa tion of. these taxes, even to the
, point of exceeding them.
Recovery Certain
"There is little question of the
I onicome of the whole situation,"
Cot troll continued. "Chicago will i
i pull out of the matter as many j
othci* cities have done before her.
The only municipalities that have
c\< r completely failed to have been
the "boom" mining towns of the
West. The real foundation of a
city's wealth lies in its powers of
taxation. A city the size of Chicago
has an almost unlimited source of
supply in this field.
"There will probably be an in
vestigation into the city's adminis
tration in an attempt to tind out
what is becoming of the millions
of dollars of public money that is
being wasted," Cottrell concluded.
"Nothing lias ever been shown that
lias definitely proven the existence
of graft, although a general opinion
to that effect is prevalent. The
gang that is in control, if there is
any such gang, is too clever for
that. As a result of the investiga
tion, a government may get into
control which will have the confi
dence of the people, and accord
inly be able to borrow enough
funds to bring the city out of its
present crisis."
