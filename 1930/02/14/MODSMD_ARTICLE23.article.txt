### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13. (A')
I Charles Evans Hughes was el<
| vated to Chief Justice of the l'nite'l
i States tonight with the consent of
1 the Senate, after four days of in
tense debate over his attitude on
economic issues.
His nomination by President
| Hoover to succeed William How-
I ard Taft was confirmed by a vot •
of 52 to 2G. Mr. Taft resigned last,
week as his health gave way. Mr.
Hughes is expected to assume tin-
Chief Justiceship immediately.
Stubborn Opposition
A stubborn uphill fight in the
j Senate against the former Supreme
] Court Justice and presidential can
didate, led by Senators Norris of
Nebraska, and Borah, of Idaho,
picked up unexpected support but
! fell short alter another full day of
J debate.
j The roll call showed the Demo
crats almost evenly divided.
Fourteen Democrats and 08 li<'
publicans voted for Hughes while
11 Republicans and 15 Democrats
opposed him.
The end of the four-day contest,
I which was unprecedented as the
j first discussion of an important
| nomination in open session, came
after nightfall when an effort b.
I the opposition to carry the debate
I over another day had been de
i ft ated.
Foes Carry Debate
Foes of Hughes carried the de
bate almost entirely and launched
a relentless drive today while it ap
peared they were gaining strength.
But a motion by Norris to recess
for another day was defeated, 45
to 35. The judiciary committee
chairman then moved to return the
j nomination to his committee for
reconsideration and this was re
jected, 49 to 31.
Launched unexpectedly on Mon
day by Senator Norris, the opposi
tion to Hughes gained considerable
momentum as one after another of
I the Senate, mostly on the Demo
I cratic side, made Known a decision
to vote against the celebrated Re
-1 publican jurist. Four days of hee
j tic work and sharp debate followed.
: Members of the Senate who wen 1
j classed as "doubtful" wen? center;;
of frequent conferences after the
| debate warmed. The contest, at
| tracted full galleries and tonight ai
! 6:35, when the final vote came, the
j gallery seats were still filled.
The opposition of Hughes was
based principally on the ground
j that his attitude on economic is
| sues before the courts today were
j prejudiced in favor of "big biisi
! ness" and because he had resigned
i from the Supreme Court to run for
! the presidency in 11)16.
In the closing hours, Senator
I Walsh, of Montana, the acting
i Democratic leader, announced to
i the Senate that lie luid changed
| his mind and would vote against
J Hughes. He had voted for a report
i of the nomination from the judi
j eiary committee but lie said after
] "the most mature, reflection" lie
I hail come to the conclusion that he
was wrong.
He then unleashed one of the
most severe attacks on the nomi
nee. Meanwhile, Hughes' distin
guished predecessor was on a sick
bed in his Wyoming Avenue home,
unable to receive visitors. Word of
the Senate action was made ready
for him by friends.
Confident of commanding the
votes necessary for confirmation,
friends of Mr. Hughes left the de
bate entirely to the opposition to
day and they hammered away se
verely.
Senator Norris asserted Hughes
"is not lit to sit. in judgment in a
contest between organized wealth
and those who toil."

contest between organized wealth
and those who toil."
WASHINGTON, Feb. 13. (A')
I Charles Evans Hughes was el<
| vated to Chief Justice of the l'nite'l
i States tonight with the consent of
1 the Senate, after four days of in
tense debate over his attitude on
economic issues.
His nomination by President
| Hoover to succeed William How-
I ard Taft was confirmed by a vot •
of 52 to 2G. Mr. Taft resigned last,
week as his health gave way. Mr.
Hughes is expected to assume tin-
Chief Justiceship immediately.
Stubborn Opposition
A stubborn uphill fight in the
j Senate against the former Supreme
] Court Justice and presidential can
didate, led by Senators Norris of
Nebraska, and Borah, of Idaho,
picked up unexpected support but
! fell short alter another full day of
J debate.
j The roll call showed the Demo
crats almost evenly divided.
Fourteen Democrats and 08 li<'
publicans voted for Hughes while
11 Republicans and 15 Democrats
opposed him.
The end of the four-day contest,
I which was unprecedented as the
j first discussion of an important
| nomination in open session, came
after nightfall when an effort b.
I the opposition to carry the debate
I over another day had been de
i ft ated.
Foes Carry Debate
Foes of Hughes carried the de
bate almost entirely and launched
a relentless drive today while it ap
peared they were gaining strength.
But a motion by Norris to recess
for another day was defeated, 45
to 35. The judiciary committee
chairman then moved to return the
j nomination to his committee for
reconsideration and this was re
jected, 49 to 31.
Launched unexpectedly on Mon
day by Senator Norris, the opposi
tion to Hughes gained considerable
momentum as one after another of
I the Senate, mostly on the Demo
I cratic side, made Known a decision
to vote against the celebrated Re
-1 publican jurist. Four days of hee
j tic work and sharp debate followed.
: Members of the Senate who wen 1
j classed as "doubtful" wen? center;;
of frequent conferences after the
| debate warmed. The contest, at
| tracted full galleries and tonight ai
! 6:35, when the final vote came, the
j gallery seats were still filled.
The opposition of Hughes was
based principally on the ground
j that his attitude on economic is
| sues before the courts today were
j prejudiced in favor of "big biisi
! ness" and because he had resigned
i from the Supreme Court to run for
! the presidency in 11)16.
In the closing hours, Senator
I Walsh, of Montana, the acting
i Democratic leader, announced to
i the Senate that lie luid changed
| his mind and would vote against
J Hughes. He had voted for a report
i of the nomination from the judi
j eiary committee but lie said after
] "the most mature, reflection" lie
I hail come to the conclusion that he
was wrong.
He then unleashed one of the
most severe attacks on the nomi
nee. Meanwhile, Hughes' distin
guished predecessor was on a sick
bed in his Wyoming Avenue home,
unable to receive visitors. Word of
the Senate action was made ready
for him by friends.
Confident of commanding the
votes necessary for confirmation,
friends of Mr. Hughes left the de
bate entirely to the opposition to
day and they hammered away se
verely.
Senator Norris asserted Hughes
"is not lit to sit. in judgment in a
contest between organized wealth
and those who toil."
