# SHALL GOVERNMENT ABUSE A CITIZEN'S RIGHTS?

### 
Violation of the constitutional guarantees granted American I
citizens looms as the I louse judiciary committee seeks to find a
method whereby the federal courts can he relieved of the burden}
of trying numerous liquor law violations. The committee is this j
week considering the phase of the \\ ickersham law enforcement |
commission report dealing with "casual or slight" violations of the
laws.
That this section of the commission's recommendation raises
important questions of constitutional rights is the interpretation of!
I'rofessor Thomas S. I'.arclay, of the Stanford Political Science j
Department, lie refers to the gross invasion of citizens' rights!
which might result if this phase of the report is adopted by ( 011-1
cress.
I'rofessor I'.arclay views the casual or slight violation of the,
law in these words: "The proposal provides for the trial of 'casual
or slight' violations of the law, without a jury, by an officer who is j
not a judge. Sentence is to be pronounced by a district judge upon :
the. recommendation of the I'nitcd States commissioners: if the'
latter recommends conviction, the accused can demand jury'trial. ;
Then the district attorney can either seek a grand jury indictment
or try the accused for the misdemeanor for which he has been .
(barged."
"In other words," I'rofessor Barclay continues, "a slight or
casual violation of the law can be turned into a felony, after the!
accused has been summarily tried, merely because he asks for trial
by jury. The assertion of his right changes the degree of his guilt."
This is the stickler in the \\ ickersham recommendations. Xo
doubt the commission's intention to provide a means whereby the j
courts may be relieved of undignified trials of petty bootleggers is
laudable. Hut to jeopardize a person's rights in the process is an
abuse of government.
