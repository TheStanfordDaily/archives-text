Dean Max AlcConn of Lehigh l/niversity recently cast another
cabbage at American educational methods and ideals in a recent
article appearing in the North . Imcrican Review. Ile claims that
ihe influx of students from every walk of life into colleges and
universities has demanded a shift from the ancient and venerable
academic traditions which the institutions fit learning have failed to
make.
Continuing his analysis of American universities, Dean McConn
claims that the students have substituted for the traditional sub
jects, extra-curricular activities which they pursue profitably and
with almost complete disregard for the more formal training in
which the faculty vainly attempts to interest them. Students have
brushed aside that which they have found uninteresting and un
profitable and have erected their own educational ideals, have sub
stituted training in organization, management, and leadership
through activities for the less practical training of the class-rooms.
Such is the opinion of a dean.
Student opinion on modern education was expressed by the
Stanford debaters in the forensic encounter with Hawaiian stu
dents Wednesday evening. The C ardinal speakers called themselves
' standardized, unintellectual nincompoops" and blamed the system
of education for their predicament.
\\ ithout a doubt there is something wrong with educational
methods when criticism originates both from above and from be
low, but who can say where the responsibility lies? Originally a
clcct few who were capable of so-called "highbrow" educational
attainments were the only college students, but with the tendency
toward mass production in industry there came the same tendency
m education. Schools and colleges are swamped with numbers
seeking not so much an education as the appearances of education
and the social prestige which attaches to a degree.
Eventually thorough technical schools for salesmen, executives,
lawyers, and physicians must come, leaving the select few in
undisputed control of the centers of culture.
