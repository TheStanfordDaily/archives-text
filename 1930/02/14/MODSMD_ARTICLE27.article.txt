"Journalist-! Listen to who's talking! Peeking through key-:
holes! Running after fire engines! Waking people up in the middle |
of the night to ask them what they think of Mussolini. Stealing ;
pictures from old ladies of their daughters who get kidnapped in
' )ak I'ark. And all for what? So a million hired girls and motor
men's wives'll know what's going on."'
Iliis picture of Chicago newspaper life, garnered from"The
ITont I'age," does not exactly fit the domain of Stanford Uni
versity. Mere journalists wake professors up in the middle of the
night to find out what they think of the Honor ('ode. and steal pic
tures of Hawaiian debaters, and it's all done so that the Stanford
ommunity of students, faculty, administrative officials, and a few
loyal alumni scattered through the states mav find out what is hap
pening here on the harm.
At present there are forty-five young, eager, and enthusiastic
tiyontees struggling for positions on the masthead of this paper.
They are combing the campus to glean bits of news and with the
hope that they will someday be real, live reporters.
The l).\n,Y trusts that members of this community will be toler
ant and fatherly with these earnest workers. Remember, they are
jus! nice boys and girls trying to get along in the world.
