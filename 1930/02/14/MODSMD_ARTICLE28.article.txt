' FEVER HOUSE by Walter Von '
Hollander. Translated from the
German by Susan Jenkins. New
York: The Macaulay Company,
1929.
i Crowd into one Berlin apartment
i house such diverse types of people as
i an expatriated American quadroon
'with his beautiful and promiscuous
j German wife, whom he is scientifically
studying for signs of Old World
decadence; an idiot girl with a strange
| inner life; an old prostitute; her inti
: mate friend, the precocious thirteen
year-old daughter of a movie director ;
I a Robot-like Russian coal heaver; a
I dying consumptive girl hanging onto!
! life with a grim gaiety; middle-class
| families who have forgotten the con- j
! ventions.
Use these characters and this house
las the background for a novel, and it
could not well he called anything but
! "Fever House."
Into this house, the building like
I its occupants degenerating from a Jin
j dt' sit'clc elegance, comes Manfred
| I'rk. lie has sought escape from the
j modern world in the country, and fail-
I ing there, seeks it in the loneliness of
| a great apartment house. Hut he can-
I not resist the infection of fever j
House. Against his will he is dawn
1 down into the whirling vortex of its I
I occupants' unhappy lives.
The whole gloomy book portends i
i to be a symbol of modern civilization. 1
Despite its exaggeration of incident, I
its tone expresses admirably the vio
i lent clutching-after-happiness of a by
. no means small segment of people to- j
I day. ' M.S. !

BROADWAY. At the New Stanford.
This is a Melodrama. There are

1 gangsters, beautiful chorus girls, night
clubs, murders, and detectives. Like
wise, (ileun Tryon is a silly clown,
and Kvelyn Brent is a haughty under
world queen. I hit provided that you
tin not swoon, with astonishment at
the aforementioned amazing facts, cer
tain points in "Broadway" can he en
joyed.
First, neither of the rival gangster
I chiefs are reformed at any spot (lur
ing the show, and both of them are
killed. Realism. The ending is real
istic, too, at least half of it, for the
beautiful Evelyn Brent has nothing
but a broken heart and a memory at
■ the fade-out. Any one else but Fve
lyn Brent might also have a troubled
conscience, after the revenge gesture
that ihis lady has to go through with.
There is only one Fvelvn Brent, how
ever. •
The other half of the ending—in
which dull faced Myrna Kennedy ar
ranges to live happily ever after with
the honorable intentions of Mr. Tryon
—seems to be necessary. When a col
orlessly sweet and pretty chorus girl
begins by being dazzled at the atten
tions of a gangster leader, and snub
bing the devoted small-town hoofer,
j you can depend oil it that she will fall
! into the arms of the small-town boy
! in the last scene.
Night club life is glorified to an
i impossible degree in this show. The
color fulness of the cabaret scenes is
: stupendous and exciting, but it gives
a false impression. Even New York
could not live up to it. Yet out of all
I the exaggeration of "Broadway" there
! is still one almost perfect feature: the
acting of the chief detective. His
speaking voice and character pro
traval is the best thing in the picture.
