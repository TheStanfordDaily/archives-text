## ACTING CHAPLAIN ASKS QUESTION 
### 
I The Editor, Sir:
On Monday night, in Dr. Allan I lun-
I tor's discussion-meeting, a student, J
1 speaking in the name of the younger
generation, asked, "Why should we in
i tercst ourselves in religion? We do i
! not need itour life is complete with
| out it."' The discussion at the 1110-
| mcnt was somewhat general, and Dr.
I Hunter, unhappily, did not catch the'
| student's question.
i If you do not object to non-contro
versial correspondence on religion in
your columns, I wonder if I might
ask, through you, for suggestions as '
to the right answer, if there be one,
jto the student's claim for the suffi- i
ciency of a purely secular life.
The best statement of the situation,
which has created the claim, so far as
J I know, is to he found in a paper
Iprepared by Dr. Rtofus Jones, of Hav- 1
lerford, in view of the recent Kcumeni-
Ical Council at Jerusalem. But even
| that paper failed to provide an answer
j which the really secular-minded youth
jof today would understand. 1

It would help ine greatly in my work
as a religious propagandist, not only
I here but elsewhere, if someone would
tell me how to meet the difficulty pre
sented by the fact that many good,
112 clean-living, and serviceable young
men and women today find all the
wants of which they are conscious, met
within the bounds of an entirely secu
lar and mundane life.
It is possible, of course, that there
exists no effective solution of the dif
ficulty. Cetainlv we older people have
â–  not provided one: and in my search, I
: am not anxious to hear from any one
I of either sex who is over, say, 26 years
! of age.
I : or only the young, or rather, only
those, of them who have not been
brought up under the pressure of re
ligious and ecclesiastical "suggestion,"
can understand llie young people of
today.
Yours very truly,
G. A. JOHNSTON ROSS,
Acting Chaplain.
