Last week were considered oppor
tunities for college students in the field
of aviation as pilots and ground men.
In this article the vocations of com
mercial operator and aeronautical en-
Igineer will he discussed.
Commercial Operator
Men interested in the commercial
Iside of aviation will find two paths
jof advancement open to them. In ihe
'operating department of an air trans
! port company opportunity may he
i found to work up to ihe position of
i Superintendent of Operations; while
lon the business and public relations
side the job of traffic managership is
the goal.
Training for the work of Superin
tendent of Operations should include
i acquisition of an engineering degree,
experience in dealing with men and
i practically always, flying experience.
Economics Necessary
The prospective traffic manager
I should be well grounded in economics,
j with particular emphasis on transpor
tation and business accounting, ami
should be experienced in advertising
Jor in public relations functions. He
lis the promoter and "trouble man" as
the public is concerned.
In both instances promotion is
earned by "working up" through the
more detailed positions of an air
transport company. Salaries are ap
proximately equivalent to those for
similar positions in other types of
transportation companies, sometimes
amounting to as much as $900 a month.
Aeronautical Engineer
The rapid development of the com
paratively new science of aviation
makes very necessary the specialized
training of aeronautical engineers.
Ability to design new aircraft, parts,
and equipment, requires a technical
training in aeronautical engineering
for one or two years beyond founda
tion work in engineering fundamentals.
Takes Graduate Work
At Stanford the engineer special-
I izing in aviation takes two years of
graduate work in the Department nt"
Mechanical Kiißincering, receiving the
degree of Kngineer. Massachusetts In
stitute of Technoloßv, California In

l stitute of Technology, University of
| Michigan, and certain other institu
j tions grant an undergraduate degree
in aeronautical engineering. Sonic uni
versities have separate schools of aero-
I nautics, but even their curriculum is
I not more complete than the work of
ifered in the two graduate years at
| Stanford.
; There are 75 well-recognized man
jufacturers of aircraft in the United
States, all of whom employ aeronau
tical engineers. Of these the Curtiss
i Company, the Hoeing Company, and
j the Douglas Aircraft Corporation are
particularly prominent. The work of
an engineer in such companies con-
I sists in designing and testing airplanes
land equipment. An average starting
| salary for the graduate of an aero
! nautical engineering school is around
$1800, about comparable with the
starting salaries in other fields of en -
i ginecring. ,
j Several research organizations em
ploy aeronautical engineers. Profes
, sor-Rmeritus W. I\ Durand of Stan
| ford University is a member of the
j best known of these organizations, the
| National Advisory Committee for
! Aeronautics, which last year spent in
i the neighborhood of $2,000,000 at
Langley Field, near Norfolk, \ irginia,
j their base of operations.

Last week were considered oppor
tunities for college students in the field
of aviation as pilots and ground men.
In this article the vocations of com
mercial operator and aeronautical en-
Igineer will he discussed.
Commercial Operator
Men interested in the commercial
Iside of aviation will find two paths
jof advancement open to them. In ihe
'operating department of an air trans
! port company opportunity may he
i found to work up to ihe position of
i Superintendent of Operations; while
lon the business and public relations
side the job of traffic managership is
the goal.
Training for the work of Superin
tendent of Operations should include
i acquisition of an engineering degree,
experience in dealing with men and
i practically always, flying experience.
Economics Necessary
The prospective traffic manager
I should be well grounded in economics,
j with particular emphasis on transpor
tation and business accounting, ami
should be experienced in advertising
Jor in public relations functions. He
lis the promoter and "trouble man" as
the public is concerned.
In both instances promotion is
earned by "working up" through the
more detailed positions of an air
transport company. Salaries are ap
proximately equivalent to those for
similar positions in other types of
transportation companies, sometimes
amounting to as much as $900 a month.
Aeronautical Engineer
The rapid development of the com
paratively new science of aviation
makes very necessary the specialized
training of aeronautical engineers.
Ability to design new aircraft, parts,
and equipment, requires a technical
training in aeronautical engineering
for one or two years beyond founda
tion work in engineering fundamentals.
Takes Graduate Work
At Stanford the engineer special-
I izing in aviation takes two years of
graduate work in the Department nt"
Mechanical Kiißincering, receiving the
degree of Kngineer. Massachusetts In
stitute of Technoloßv, California In

l stitute of Technology, University of
| Michigan, and certain other institu
j tions grant an undergraduate degree
in aeronautical engineering. Sonic uni
versities have separate schools of aero-
I nautics, but even their curriculum is
I not more complete than the work of
ifered in the two graduate years at
