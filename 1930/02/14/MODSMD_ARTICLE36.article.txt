# MOTHERS CLUB OF STANFORD FOUNDS MEN'S REST HOME
## Home Meets Need of Men Not Sick Enough To Enter Hospital 
### Stewart Crawford 
Conceiving the necessity for an
infirmary on the campus, tin* Stan
ford Mothers Club took steps to
ward establishing such an institu
tion two years ago. The outcome
of their efforts may be seen today
in the Stanford Men's Rest Home.
In the full tpiarter of 1928, visu
alizing the need for :i place of rest
for students not ill enough to he
confined in a hospital, ;i group of
Stanford Mothers presented their
rase to Dr. Wilbur, asking that
they be allowed to raise the money
to carry out their phin under Uni
versity sanction. Since the Univer
sity did not see fit io build the
necessary quart a. six of the
mothers, will) the backing of the
club, offered to finance the home,
and two of them expressed* their
willingness to make room for it in
their own residences.
"Tile Stanford Mothers Club has
been very generous in establishing
the home," said Mrs. Kdwin J.
Thomas, chairman of the rest home
committee, "and has made avail
able for students unable to pay
their expenses, a fund from which
will be paid tile cost of maintain
ing them."
Students Help
The University watched the
progress of the institution as an
experiment, to tost the value of the
idea, and, recognizing its import
ance, the Student (Juild decided to
make the same arrangements for
paying the expenses of students in
Ihe home, as they do in student
hospital cases. Under this plan, a
patient is charged only one dollar
a day during his stay at the rest
home.
"Due to the fact that we have
to be careful not to get cases in
the home that really require hos
pital attention," Mrs. Thomas said,
"the general opinion has developed
that its benefits are not worth the
red tape that is required to get in.
This is not the case, however. In
fact,-the procedure for gaining ad
mittance is very simple."
Small Expense
A student who feels that he is
not well, but does not need hospital
attention or cannot afford to pay
hospital fees, may see Dr. Torrey
of the University health service,
or simply phone him at 4182. lie is
in touch Avitli the conditions at tli• ■
home, and will be able to tell the
student whether or not the space
is available. If the student wishes,
he may have his personal doctor
call Dr. Torrey regarding the seri
ousness of his case, although this
is not necessary. If it is too late
to reach Dr. Torrey, tlie student
may simply call Mrs. Nellie Mor
rison at 53(! Alvarado, in whoso
residence the home is located, and
she will decide "whether or not he
is really too sick to stay there,"
she said.
Other members of tlie Rest Home
Committee, whom Mrs. Thomas
commended for their efforts and
generosity, are Mrs. A. B. Clark,
Mrs. Thomas A. Storey, Mrs. Paul
Shoup, Mrs. J. W. Bingham, Mrs.
A. li. Khrnian, and Mrs S. D. Balcli.
