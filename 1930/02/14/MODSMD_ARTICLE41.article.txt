"Arc campus morals better than they
I used to be?" will he the subject of a
j talk 1 "'ri (lay before the high school
leaders conference.
( The subject of campus morals has
been a moot question for 10, these
many years—with the unsatisfying re
sult that no decision has ever been
reached. Doubtless one speech more
| or less will not change the situation,
j However, the subject is one that will
j draw quite a bit of comment.
American colleges are perhaps the
j most disgustingly misrepresented in
| stitutions of any portrayed in motion
j pictures or fiction. Always the college
! of today is pictured as a place for gin,
| women and drunken brawls—with one
J exception The Daily has noted—and
j little or no attention is paid the class
room. Or, if the theme does not con
cern gin and women, athletics is the
d<miinating feature.
The attitude of the screen and fic
■ lion is perfectly understandable. As

| college .studeuts -are young and not as
mature as they might be, their lives
i are not sufficiently interesting to vvar
| rant plays and stories being written
about them. The life'of the college
student possesses glamor only if
j dressed up with gin bottles and women
' with short skirls.
Consequently, in college stories, gin
bottles are inserted and short skirts
I are added to give it life. The result
i is that college life, to the outsider, be
i comes one great party. Books, thev
! think, are a sideline.
The Daily does not hold the brief
that the campus is a haven of abso
lute purity. However, it is decidedly
not as it is painted.
j The Daily does not pretend to know
I conditions as they exist in past days
ion the campus. That was before this
I generation, and consequently all evi-
J deuce is hearsay.
| Campus morals, however, at the
j present time, are not what they are
J pictured.
