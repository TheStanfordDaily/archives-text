# TOLMAN DISCUSSES WATER PROBLEMS FACING PALO ALTO
## Eleven-Year Deficiency of Rainfall Cause of All Trouble 
### Philip Humphreys 
"People are just beginning to ap
j predate that water must be cou-
I served, just as any other natural
j resource," said Professor ! ( \ Tol
i man, of the geology department,
[yesterday in discussing the series
j of water stage registers which has
I just been installed in the vicinity
' of Stanford and Palo Alto.
"Wells, which Ir> or 20 years ago
j were artesian, that is, flowing of
: their own accord, have dropped to
more than f>o feet in depth at the
| present time," lie pointed out. "l)e-
I ficiency in the rainfall of the state,
j extending over a period of 1 1 years,
has induced subnormal conditions
| which have brought, the question
; into public consideration. Water
i l.as been pumped out of tho ground
; faster than it has collected in the
; underground reservoirs. Just what
I t lie ultimate outcome will be, is a
j question which must he worked, out.
I in the future. Its present aspect is
I serious."
Under present plans of the de
partment, the entire water-bearing
gravel area of the Santa Clara
! Valley will be tested by means of
i the water stage registers which re
i cord the rise and fall of the water
table. At. the present time, only the
I area in the San Francisquito Cone
is being measured by the new ap
j paratus which is automatic in its
: operation.
The instruments, which cost
about $100 each, have been in
stalled by advanced students in
; geology, and periodic readings are
taken as part of the laboratory
work. Of the six installations now
1 in operation, one has been in place
, for a number of years and the
other five are new.
