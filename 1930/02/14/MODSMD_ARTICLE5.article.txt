# TIBBETT SINGS HERE MONDAY AFTER L.A. HIT
## Capacity Audiences Hear Baritone During Past Week in South Song Selection Has Wide Range of Type 
### 
Lawrence Tibbett, Metropolitan Op- j
' era baritone who will appear on the |
j Stanford concert stage Monday night j
I at 8:15 in the Pavilion, has been play
j ing to capacity audiences in the Los j
! Angeles Philharmonic Auditorium |
! during the past week, according to
I newspaper accounts from the south.
| To a Los Angeles audience sold out
| in advance Tibbett interpreted negro j
: spirituals, "Narrative of the Shirt" i
i from his talkie "Rogue Song," and j
1 songs from Rupert Hughes, as well
j as classical works of Brahms and Han
j del.
"From one extreme of style to an
| other, he turned with an ease that be- j
j spoke a temperamental range equal to |
! the range of his voice," said a Los j
Angeles review of bis concert, which j
; was practically doubled in length by |
encores.
Talented Accompanist
"Stewart Wille, Tibbett's aide in i
artistry, played a familiar group of j
| piano numbers as well. His ability as i
| a composer was demonstrated in an ;
| arrangement of a spiritual which j
I earned much applause," said another j
j report.
The same variety of program will ;
| feature bis concert here Monday |
which will include an Old English bal- i
lad, "The Bailiff's Daughter," "Jazz-|
i Boys," "Captain Stratton's Fancy," j
and "Travelin* to de Crave," a negro j
| spiritual, the last three being on the j
latter half of his program, which will
be of a lighter character than the first.
Tibbett also sings a poem, written |
by his wife. Grace M. Tibbett, and set |
to music by Frank La Forge, accom- j
panist and coach who has worked i
with the baritone in the development j
i of his art.
