# Frosh Cagers Meet Bears In Second Fracas
## Game Will Be Preliminary To Varsity Contest Tomorrow Night 
### 
With one victory over the Califor
nia cagers early in the season to their
credit, the Stanford freshman basket
ball five will meet the Bear Cubs on
their own floor tomorrow night at 6:45
preliminary to the varsity contest, in
an effort to repeat last year's record
of two straight wins.
Couch Bradshaw is not overconfi
dent of success in this encounter,
since the basketball lie saw the U.C.
frosh play against the St. Ignatius
babes Tuesday night would not inspire
confidence in any coach. Bradshaw
says that the California cagers out
played the team that beat Stanford by
even more than the 30-36 score indi
cated. The one-point defeat by the
Card freshmen is the only contest that
the U.C'. hoop artists have dropped
this season.
In preparation for the tilt Coach
Bradshaw has been putting his outfit
through some stiff workouts, in an
effort to perfect an attack that will
penetrate the defense of the Berkeley
frosh. Cordry has been doing some
good work in the place of Meade at
forward, and with Meade out of the
hospital and in condition to play to
morrow night, the frosh coach is un
decided as to which he will include in
the starting lineup. The Card chances
will depend to a large extent on the
shooting of Palmer at the other for
ward, who looped them in from all
angles to collect 20 points against
Santa Clara Tuesday night.
Fdelcn will start at center for the
Stanford babes, with Tway and Cap
tain Hancock at the guard positions.
