# WILBUR HUBBARD, VERSATILE ALL-AROUND ATHLETE FROM SAN JOSE, IS INELIGIBLE
## 
### BY LEONARD KULLMANN 
As outstanding an all-round ath
lete ever to enroll at Stanford, bu<
ineligible for varsity competition!
Such is the position of Wilbur
Hubbard, who transferred to St.au
j ford from San Jose State College
last quarter, but who is unfortun
ately not eligible to wear the Stan
ford red in competition. Four years
j of participation in three sports at
the San Jose institution preclude
any possibility that Hubbard may
compete for the Cards.
A glimpse at Hubbard's record
at State shows how great an asset
I he was to that college in athletic
I activities. He holds a total of
twelve letters earned "in three
| sports, football, basketball, and
track, and he was captain of the
i team in each of the three sports
at one time or another during his
career at S^ate.
In football, Hubbard played
quarter, and served as field gen
| eral. His spectacular open Held
running is still the topic of con
versation, and more than one con
ference opponent lias seen his elu
sive running responsible for touch
j downs. Fast and shifty, long runs
came to be expected of him in prac
tically every game.
All-Conference guard for two

| years on championship teams, and
1 holder of four letters in basketball,
| Hubbard was the mainstay of the
j San Jose cage squad, and held the
' captaincy of the team / during his
last year of competition,
i Hubbard loafed along on the
; track squad, merely running the
1 100, 220, 440, *ind acted as anchor
i man on the relay team. He also
| tossed the javelin around 175 feet
j whenever he was called upon to
I enter that event. As captain, he led
| the San Jose State team to the
championship in the class 15 compe
tition at the Fresno Relay meet in
j ID2B. Consistent around 50 seconds
i flat in the quarter mile, this versa
i tile young man was rarely pressed
in any of his races.
The coming track season will
probably see Hubbard wearing the
AVinged O of the Olympic Club, al
though no definite announcement
to that effect has yet been made.
Not content with three sports,
1 Bill took an occasional turn on the
mound for the nine which last sum
mer won the baseball champion-
I ship in the Santa Clara Valley
League, although he was not the
i regular twirler of the team.
A natural athlete —but, he can
never compete for Stanford Uni-
I versify!
