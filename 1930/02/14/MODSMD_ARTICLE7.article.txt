### Catherine Spaulding 
Cicinenee Dane, author of "Gran
ite," I h< English Club play which
is to he presented on tin- campus,
February 28, is known as a novelist
and actress as well as a playwright.
She once intended making portrait
painting iter profession, hut later
gave it up.
Such novels as "Regiment of
Women" and -"Legend" have given
her place among the host of con
temporary novelists; such plays as
"Bill of Divorcement" and "Will
Shakespeare," among the best of
contemporary dramatists. It is of
ten said that the greatest, artists
have concentrated their genius on
one art, but critics differ in their
attitude as to whether IVliss Dane
is at her beat as a novelist, or play
wright.
Since her success In the theatre
she seemed to have discontinued
writing novels, but has returned to
fiction and written some long short
stories, in which condensed form
of narrative, the arts of dramatist

i
; and novelist were considered sue- j
(essl'ully combined.
Realistic Character
('lenience Dane generally choos- 1
l es for her characters people who j
are good and had, clean and dirty, !
base, noble, and contemptible as '
people really are, rather than em
phasizing one type. In "Granite" j
her characters are portrayed as
victims of the surrounding nature)
I which seems to have moulded them i
lo its stormy and rocky form.
4 This play differs in its wilder at- j
inosphere, from "Will Shakes- ;
pea re," which is a sheer romance, I
and "A Rill of Divorcement" writ- i
ten on the problem of an unloved I
husband, who, divorced during his
long insanity, unexpectedly re- !
I covers.
Differing from many of the mod- j
ern writers, she does not turn out j
novels or plays annually, ('lenience
Dane follows no beaten track, and
shows her originality in the unique
plots she creates. She has an ex
traordinary sense of I lie stage.
