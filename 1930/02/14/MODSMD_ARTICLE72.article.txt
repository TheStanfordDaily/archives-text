# Stanford Ball Team, Broncos Mix Tomorrow
## Cards Set for Conference Opener To Be Played At Santa Clara 
### Howard Moore 
Traveling down the highway t< > the
Santa Clara hall diamond, Stanford's
varsity baseball team will ofliciall)
open its conference season at 2:.?()
o'clock Saturday afternoon against the
Bronco nine. The Card diamond art
ists have been welded into a compact
team and should have a good chance
of copping the conference title.
Although the Stanford squad is hav
ing a drought of experienced pitchers
and has been bit bard by injuries, a
check up on the other conference ag
gregations has shown similar condi
tions. California has but one regular
pitcher, Santa Clara has lost two
pitcher; Santa Clara has lost two
though Saint Mary's has an excellent
pitching staff, the Gael nine is weak
both in the infield and outfield. The
U. S. C. and U. C. L. A. outfits are
unknown quantities.
Many Injuries
Injuries have hurt Wolter's squad
more than anything else. Hardy was
the first when lie was spiked in the
wrist in the opening game of the
season and put out of the game for
three weeks. Then Goodell cut a
finger on one hand and received a
stone bruise on the other. Oswill was
spiked in the foot in one of the prac
tice games. Three days ago Loomis
was hit in the arm by a batted ball and
will be on the bench until next week.
And worst of all, Captain Laird frac
tured and dislocated his ankle the first
part of the week, forcing him out of
the game for the rest of the season.
With half a break, however, the
Cards ought to come through. r l he
pitching staff is way above par; in
the last three names only three pitchers
were used, one for each tiltâ€”a record
since "Strong-arm" Nevers left this
institution.
Hardy Back
Hardy is hack in the game again,
Goodell's finger is practically healed,
I and Kelly has shown nice work at
I covering third base. Churchill and
i Johnson are all set, and Wolter is
i blessed with three good fielders, hard
I hitters to boot. Added to that, the
| boys are beginning to talk up the game
again and spirit is rising. Taylor was
amusing the multitudes yesterday at
| batting practice and Hunken almost
| got griped at the jibes handed around.
And "Ike," the old gent that comes
out faithfully to see all practices, was
on hand to give out his advice. Given
just a little luck, the Cards will be
away to the races.
Bronco Lineup
I Myles Regan is slated to start in
'the box for the Broncos tomorrow;
j last year the Rcdshirts pounded him
lout of the box in one game. Captain
Milt Axt will catch for the Mission
team. First base is an uncertainty and
a weak spot, but Harper and Jaqua,
old stand-bys, will be on second and
third, respectively. Stuart, a promis
ing sophomore, is playing short, and
Gaddy, Rowland, and Morcy will be
in the outer gardens.
Wolter will start the regular Stan
ford lineup, with Goodell, Churchill,
Johnson, and Kelly in the infield;
Hunken, Rintala, and Campbell out in
112 the pastures; Hardy behind the plat
ter, and either Story or Leverenz on
I the mound.
