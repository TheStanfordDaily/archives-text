# HUNT'S MEN SET FOR 1ST VICTORY IN FIVE SEASONS
## Don Tyler on Injured List; May Not Be in Shape Tomorow Night 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Favorer! as usual to be mauled all
over the hardwood, yet determined to
end the Golden Bears' monopoly of
Big Series tilts, Coach Husky Hunt's
varsity cagers are scheduled to tangle
with California's title aspiring quintet
tomorrow evening at eight o'clock in
the Oakland Auditorium.
Beaten in the first Big Series en
gagement three weeks ago by a six
point margin and now wallowing
around in the Conference cellar uncon
tested, Stanford is the natural and
logical underdog for tomorrow's clash,
which situation may spur the Cards
on to great heights before the final
basket swishes through the hoop.
For Hunt's men wiil not only be out
to win a basketball game, but they
will be fired up to win their first court
battle from the Blue and Gold since
way back in 1925. Five long, lean
winters, it is said, sometimes actually
get under a team's skin so that it
comes through with a good game of
ball at the crucial moment.
Hectic Battle Likely
As the Cardinal live is in just such
a position, the cash customers may
well look forward to a hectic forty
minutes of entertainment tomorrow
night. And although heralded as be
ing in the driver's scat, the Berkeley
Bears will have to display some fancy
basket shooting themselves to come out
on the long end of the score.
Outside of being doped the short
enders, the Cards may be handicapped
with the loss of Don Tyler, who has
been out of practice for the past three
days with a badly bruised knee. Tyler,
forward, and one of the most spirited
players on the squad, was injured dur
ing Monday's workout.
At all events, Tyler will not be in
the best of shape, even though the
team physicians allow him to play, and
it is doubtful whether he would be
able to last long. With tbi> flashy for
ward on the sidelines, Hunt is likely
to start Vance Fawcett, best passer on
the st|uad, but who has been coming
through with sluggish performances
all season.
Subs May Start
However, Jimmy Mcars or Hud
Hawkins may get the call, as they
have been showing up well in practice
all week - . Mears' playing in the Santa
Clara game also impressed Hunt, and
although he can't be counted on to
flip in many baskets, the lanky sub
i stitute is likely to see action during at
least a part of the evening's festivities.
Yesterday afternoon the Card men
tor put his charges through their last
practice before game time tomorrow,
scrimmaging his men against Cal for
mations and having each player shoot
at least KM) fouls. There will be no
new free throw record tomorrow, ac
cording to Hunt.
The following lineup worked togeth
er yesterday, and is the one, barring a
last minute change at forward, that
will open against the Bears: Red Berg
and Vance Fawcett, forwards, John
McCandless. center, and Captain Fo-
I thert and Mike Reynolds at the guard
i positions. Berg has played consistent
ly good ball since the season's opener,
I while McCandless is high scorer for
I the Cards to date.
Reports from Berkeley have it that
I the Bears arc working overtime in
j preparation for the coming fracas, as
! besides being desirous to keep their
i wins over Stanford intact, the i'rice
j men still have an outside chance of
j copping the Conference championship,
I provided they trim the Cards in the
j two remaining tilts of the year.
To stop Cal, the barm lads will
I have to bottle up Ken Bursel, who has
; been locating the basket with regular
| it >' lately and leads the ( oast scorers
j with L? 3 points. Will Tripp, at for
ward, is another man the Cards will
i have to watch closely, as lie ran wild
' in the last Cal-Card court meet to toss
I in seven field goals.

For Hunt's men wiil not only be out
to win a basketball game, but they
will be fired up to win their first court
battle from the Blue and Gold since
way back in 1925. Five long, lean
winters, it is said, sometimes actually
get under a team's skin so that it
comes through with a good game of
ball at the crucial moment.
Hectic Battle Likely
As the Cardinal live is in just such
a position, the cash customers may
well look forward to a hectic forty
minutes of entertainment tomorrow
night. And although heralded as be
ing in the driver's scat, the Berkeley
Bears will have to display some fancy
basket shooting themselves to come out
on the long end of the score.
Outside of being doped the short
enders, the Cards may be handicapped
with the loss of Don Tyler, who has
been out of practice for the past three
days with a badly bruised knee. Tyler,
forward, and one of the most spirited
players on the squad, was injured dur
ing Monday's workout.
At all events, Tyler will not be in
the best of shape, even though the
team physicians allow him to play, and
it is doubtful whether he would be
able to last long. With tbi> flashy for
ward on the sidelines, Hunt is likely
to start Vance Fawcett, best passer on
the st|uad, but who has been coming
through with sluggish performances
all season.
Subs May Start
However, Jimmy Mcars or Hud
Hawkins may get the call, as they
have been showing up well in practice
all week - . Mears' playing in the Santa
Clara game also impressed Hunt, and
although he can't be counted on to
flip in many baskets, the lanky sub
i stitute is likely to see action during at
least a part of the evening's festivities.
Yesterday afternoon the Card men
tor put his charges through their last
practice before game time tomorrow,
scrimmaging his men against Cal for
mations and having each player shoot
at least KM) fouls. There will be no
new free throw record tomorrow, ac
cording to Hunt.
The following lineup worked togeth
er yesterday, and is the one, barring a
last minute change at forward, that
will open against the Bears: Red Berg
and Vance Fawcett, forwards, John
McCandless. center, and Captain Fo-
I thert and Mike Reynolds at the guard
i positions. Berg has played consistent
ly good ball since the season's opener,
I while McCandless is high scorer for
I the Cards to date.
Reports from Berkeley have it that
I the Bears arc working overtime in
j preparation for the coming fracas, as
! besides being desirous to keep their
i wins over Stanford intact, the i'rice
j men still have an outside chance of
j copping the Conference championship,
I provided they trim the Cards in the
j two remaining tilts of the year.
To stop Cal, the barm lads will
I have to bottle up Ken Bursel, who has
; been locating the basket with regular
| it >' lately and leads the ( oast scorers
j with L? 3 points. Will Tripp, at for
ward, is another man the Cards will
i have to watch closely, as lie ran wild
' in the last Cal-Card court meet to toss
I in seven field goals.
Favorer! as usual to be mauled all
over the hardwood, yet determined to
end the Golden Bears' monopoly of
Big Series tilts, Coach Husky Hunt's
varsity cagers are scheduled to tangle
with California's title aspiring quintet
tomorrow evening at eight o'clock in
the Oakland Auditorium.
Beaten in the first Big Series en
gagement three weeks ago by a six
point margin and now wallowing
around in the Conference cellar uncon
tested, Stanford is the natural and
logical underdog for tomorrow's clash,
which situation may spur the Cards
on to great heights before the final
basket swishes through the hoop.
