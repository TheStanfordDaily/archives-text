WASHINGTON, I'cb. 13 (/P>.
! The wariness of (he seller today
j blocked c(Torts of the government to
J test whether the buyer of liquor is
| guilty of violating the prohibition laws.
With a man in court whom they de
scribed as having been arrested after
I coining from a speakeasy with a half
I pint of gin in his pocket, detectives
! cast about in vain for a person who
i would admit selling it to him. Decid
ing that it required at least two per
' sot; to make a liquor transaction, they
changed the charge of buying that had
' been placed against Joseph Patrick
j Larley to one of possessing liquor.
