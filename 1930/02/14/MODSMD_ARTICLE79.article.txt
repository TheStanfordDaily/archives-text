One Black Cat Is Bad Enough!
"Where was Stanford when
the lights went out?
Down the cellar . . . without
a doubt!"
Now that llit' 1930 basketball season
is tottering on its last legs and getting
ready to render its yearly swan song,
the tuition payers of dear old Stanford
U. are already beginning to hum this
annual funeral dirge in honor of their
coach and his most promising mate
rial.
Which is quite different
from the tune these honest
citizens looked forward to at
the beginning of said hard
wood season!
They say a black cat has
nine lives. It seems that the
basketball situation on the
Farm belongs in the same
category. If so, the nine year
period is up (1921 to 1930),
and the populace demands a
new cat to kill!
Yet, while tlie cagers prepare for
their fond adieu, a new and different
sport springs into the limelight. To
morrow afternoon, the Cardinal base
ball club makes its 1930 Conference
debut down on the Santa Clara dia
mond.
And once again the modest harm
tuition payers are looking forward to
singing a more jovial song, when the
last batter of the season takes his
final mighty cut at the horsehide.
For this year's baseball
prospects are the brightest in
a long, long time. Not that
Stanford has a world beater of
a ball club, but pre-season
dope places the Cards on a par
with the rest of the Confer
ence nines.
True, Coach H. M. Wolter has
witnessed his players go down to
three defeats already. But all of these
losses were by close scores, and to
high powered ball clubs, with lineups
composed of ex-college stars and
sprinkled with big-leaguers.
At the same time, Wolter's lads have
trounced a trio of highly touted out
fits to date. And these same ball clubs
in turn have neatly trimmed other
rival Conference teams.
However, all is not rosy
with the Farm nine. For the
Cards will be forced to play
the remainder of the season
without the services of their
captain, Bill Laird, who frac
tured his ankle sliding to sec
ond base in Monday's practice.
Besides being an inspiration to his
fellow players, overflowing with pep
and ginger at all times out on the dia
mond, Laird was the most consistent
batter and fielder on the whole squad.
In fact, he was just about
a cinch to make all-Confer
ence third-baseman.
That his absence is keenly felt was
shown on Wednesday last, when Stan
ford was nosed out by the hard slug
ging McMullin and McNamara semi
pros and pros from San Francisco.
But even with this handicap,
the Cards stand an excellent
chance of finishing on top.
Wolter has as good a pitching
staff as any in the league, with
Perry Taylor, Vard Loomis,
H. W. Leverenz, and Don
Story chucking their curves
and fast ones across the plate.
California has its little Jack Hor
ner, last year's leading Coast college
twirler, to be sure, but that is all;
while St. Mary's and Santa Clara's
nioundsmen are touted as second rate.
The rest of the Stanford players com
pare favorably with the other Con
ference ball hawks.
At any rate, the Farm's
baseball chances are equal to
those of its basketball quin
tet at the beginning of the
season. And the DAILY feels
that the Stanford nine, unlike
its predecessor, will be far re
moved from the cellar when
the lights go out. One black
cat in the family is bad
enough!
