to take advantage.

perfect shape and it is my business to
see that it stays that way. Oftentimes
I am asked how a girl can prepare

know of no other way than actual
experience in the theatre. Everything
must go like oil and the men must not
realize the difficulties."

for several years headed the dramatics
department of Manual Arts High
School in Los Angvles. There, besides
coaching, she supervised the designing
and construction of all sets, including
one for the production of "Joan of

man in the naval service, the highest

to take advantage.

perfect shape and it is my business to
see that it stays that way. Oftentimes
I am asked how a girl can prepare
herself for the work I am doing. I

must go like oil and the men must not
realize the difficulties."
