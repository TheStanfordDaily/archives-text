WASHINGTON, Feb. 13. (/P)â€”
Purest rangers are expected to pro
duce curling irons and blankets
from fir clad solitudes ;is magicians
would rabbits out of a hat, the U.S.
forest service reports.
Last summer the 1,845,693 per
sons who used the 1186 camp
grounds provided by the service
appealed to the rangers for all
; orts of odd things. Though invari
ably considerate of "tenderfoot."
tbe rangers could only offer them
the camp facilities of fireplaces,
garbage pits and sanitary con
veniences.
These have been installed in all
but 300 of the camps. As soon as
funds permit these will also be
equipped.
