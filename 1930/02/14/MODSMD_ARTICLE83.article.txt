# California Cagers Prepared For Second Game
## BEAR TITLE HOPES HINGE ON RESULTS OF TILT SATURDAY U.C., Bruin Victories Over Week-End Will Cause Conference Tie 
### Victor F. Ludewig, '31 (Assistant Sports Editor, Daily Californian 
With another conference cham
pionship still remaining a possi
bility, California's varsity basket
hall team is being carefully pre
pared for this Saturday's encounter
with Stanford at the Oakland Audi
torium.
Not since 1024 has a Cardinal
quintet downed the Bears, and with
this thought in mind Coach Nibs
Price is fully aware that nothing
would please the Redstarts more
than to extinguish all title hopes
that the Bears still have. Conse
quently a California victory this
week-end will be a much cherished
one.
Need Bruin Win
At the same time tomorrow night,
California followers will be praying
for the Bruins to defeat the con
ference-leading Trojans. Should
both Bear and Bruin be victorious,
the southern division race would
be thrown into a tie.
Coach Nibs Price will very prob
ably start the same lineup that he
has used in all the important games
this season. Captain Perry Ten-
Eyck is slated to open at the pivot
position with Wilson Tripp and
Kent Pursel holding down tlie for
ward berths. Carl Vendt and Bill
Davis will be the guards.
Pursel Scoring Ace
I Pursel is leading scorer on the
Bear squad with Tripp running him
a close second. Both are good long
shots with the former being the
steadier of (lie two. In Whitey
Nealson, Price lias a very capable
| substitute for either of bis start-
I ing forwards. Nealson came in
especially bandy last Friday night
when he replaced Tripp and scored
ten points to give the Bears a vic
! tory.
Captain Ten Eyck has managed
ito get. the tipoff in practically
j every game and because of his
! height is very valuable under the
basket. During the last few games,
bis shooting eye lias improved con
i siderablv, giving the Bears another
i scoring threat.
Vendt and Davis, both new play
! ers this season, liave improved
j very rapidly and make a fine pair
j of guards for the Bears. Joel Cof
! field, a member of the 1929 cham
' pions who has been out because of
j injuries, is fully recovered and
gives Price a third first-class guard.
Cofl'ield was very much in evidence
j against the Bruins Saturday with
I his flashy floor-work and winning
] basket in the final seconds of play.
