# A.S.S.U. COMMITTEE OUTLINES TOPICS OF CONSTITUTION STUDY
## 
### 
The ironing out of ambiguities, the
elimination of "dead" sections, and
the shifting of certain minor portions
to the by-laws in order to increase
their flexibility, were outlined as the
principle points to be considered by
the Constitutional Revision Commit
tee in their study of the A.S.S.U. Con
stitution, by Stanford Steinbeck at the
committee's initial meeting last night.
Among the specific topics for consid
eration mentioned by the Student
Body president, were the possible sub
stitution of a preferential system of
voting in A.S.S.U. elections for the
present double election system; the re
duction of the length of the nomina
tion period; the establishment of the
A.YV.S. president as a member of the
Kxecutive Committee; the possible
combination under one man each, of
the offices of junior and sophomore
president and Kxecutive Committee
representative; and the definite consti
tutional limitation of the bonfire build
ing period. Certain additional minor
sport awards were also mentioned.
