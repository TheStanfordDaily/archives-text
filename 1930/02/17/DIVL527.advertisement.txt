Over the Horizon
TTERE they come—the nucleus of an all-electric mer-
J chant marine. Yesterday, they were a dream. To-day,
they are well over the horizon, linking the ports of the
east and west coasts with fortnightly service. The goal of
the Panama Pacific Line is to build three more turbine
electric; ships thus enablingweekly New York-Frisco sailings.
Even now, the three liners California, Virginia, and
Pennsylvania, constitute the largest fleet of turbine-electric
commercial ships in the world.
