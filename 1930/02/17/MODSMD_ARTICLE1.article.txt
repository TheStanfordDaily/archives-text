# BEARS TROUNCE STANFORD 38-31 TO WIN SERIES
## Redshirts Gain Early Lead But California's Offense Proves Too Powerful Card Cagemen Outclassed; Tripp Makes High Score; Troy Leads Conference 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Although outscoring the Bears
in the second half and coming
within throe points of catching
their Berkeley rivals two minutes
from tlie final gun, Coach Husky
Hunt's Cardinal cagers dropped
their second straight Big Series
tilt, to California at the Oakland
Auditorium on Saturday night by a
score of 28 to 31.
With the defeat went the annual
scries championship, the ninth in a
row to be capture<l by tlie Golden
Bear. Not since 1921, when Stan
ford won the Pacific Coast title,
have the Cards been able to turn
the trick. Hunt's men still have
another crack at the Bears next
Saturday on the Farm hardwood,
but from the looks of things the
Blue and Gold monopoly on "bin"
tilts will remain intact until 1931,
at least.
Cards Outclassed
For California completely out
classed the Card five in all depart
ments of the game on Saturday
last, and Ihe score in no way in
dicates the real difference between
the two rivals. The Bear teamwork
clicked quite smoothly at times,
while Hunt's understudies merely
played their usual week-end brand
of basketball.
It was light alone, the desire to
down the Bears for the first time
since 1925, that kept Hunt's men
in the running up to the very end
of the evenings' festivities. Taking
the floor in the second period
eleven points behind, the Cards
made a desperate rally, and with
Captain Ten Kyck, rangy C'al cen
ter, out of the game on personal
fouls, managed to narrow the
count down to 34 to 31 with less
than two minutes to go.
Lead See-Snws
The l<ad see-sawed back and
forth until three minutes before
half-time, when Cal's offense began
to function. Tripp, Coffiehl, and
Purse I located the hoop by turn
with great rapidity to give th â€¢
Pricemen a 28 to IT margin as the
initial period ended.
Berg Stars
Individually, most of l lie Card
players performed quite well, the
work of Bud Hawkins, lied Berg,
and Mike Reynolds being particu
larly outstanding. Berg was flashy
on the floor as usual, besides being
liigh-point man for Stanford with
8 points.
Tripp and Pursel were the big
offensive guns for the Bear quin
tet, scoring 14 and 10 points re
spectively, most of them via the
set-up route. Ten Kyck outjumped
Harlow Rothert, Farm leader, dur
ing a greater part of the time,
while, Vendt and Coffield gave the
Cards a hectic evening on defense.
