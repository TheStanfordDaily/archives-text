# U.C. QUINTET TAKES SECOND GAME FROM CARD FROSH, 33-25
## 
### 
Failing to penetrate the air-tight
defense of the California freshmen,
the Stanford frosh quintet in the
preliminary to the varsity contest
Saturday night, dropped the second
tilt of their series with the U.C.
yearlings by a score of 33 to 25,
putting the two teams in a tie with
one victory each. Close checking
featured the play throughout.
With neither team showing any
advantage for the first eight min
utes of the game, Palmer found the
basket to start a rally of the Cards
which put them in the lead, 11 to 6.
The comfortable margin was not to
last long, however, for the Bear
Cubs retaliated with a smooth-run
ning drive that netted them three
more baskets to put them one
point, ahead at halt time.
Not until the IJ.C. frosh had in
creased their lead to seven points
in the second half did the Card
babes score again, when TwVy,
dribbling the length of the floor,
sneaked under the basket to sink
a setup unassisted. For the remain
der of the second period the play
was on an even basis, with neither
team showing an effective offense.
Palmer and Tway were tied for
high-point honors of the evening,
with ten markers each to their
credit. Munlock, California center,
was the leading scorer for the Hear
Tubs with nine points, while
Ohashi, flashy Cub guard, broke
up a number of Stanford plays to
turn in the best exhibition of floor
work.
