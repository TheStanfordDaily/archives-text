# BULGARIA RELIEF DRIVE ORGANIZED
## Wednesday, Thursday Set For Raising $500 
### 
In an attempt to give relief to
tlu; starving students of Bulgaria,
the A.S.S.U. will launch upon a
! drive Wednesday and Thursday 111
an attempt to raise $500 as a con
tribution to Ihe International Stu
dent Service fund for the purpose.
The money will be used for the
construction of a Student House in
Sofia, which will house, feed, and
give employment to some 2,000 stu
dents. Twenty-six thousand dollars
is necessary for the construction
| of the building, of which amount
$15,000 is to be raised in the United
States.
The International Student Ser
vice is the organization in charge
of the movement. It. grew up im
j mediately after the war as a con
i necting link between university
students of practically every na
: tion. In 1920 the service gave suc
cor to the youth of Austria. The
| condition in Bulgaria is reported
i to be much worse than that in
i Austria after the war.
According to Betty Ahlen, gen
! oral chairman, the A.S.S.U. com
; mittce which was appointed to cxe
| cute the drive will emphasize a
â€¢ great many small contributions
j rather than a few large ones, in
their canvass. The committee will
meet on the lirst. floor of the Wo
men's Clubhouse at 5:15 o'clock
today.
