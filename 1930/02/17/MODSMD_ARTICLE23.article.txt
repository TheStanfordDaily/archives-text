i where slio was guest of honor Fri
day. "Why should students be con
cerned with anything off the cam
pus? However, the change of in- i
j (crest in international affairs ev-
I cry where is very great."
"Everyone is reading and talk- ■
I ing, and gradually entering into a

of this now idea, a now world is
forming and our model of a world
society is gradually being built
like the model of the inner quad
