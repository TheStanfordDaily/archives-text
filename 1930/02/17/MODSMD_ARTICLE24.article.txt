I'nversity and intimated that there were exceptional opportunities in
tiie motion picture field at the present time l'or work in his chosen

Davis, Associate Professor of
I English and Director of Dramatics,
has been on leave of absence for
| a year in Hollywood where he is
i acting as personal assistant to
| Hunt Stromberg of Metro Gold
| wyn-Mayer studios. He is reported
; to be working on scenarios and
studying the mechanics of talking
| pictures. For ten years he has
■ been connected with Stanford d' i
j matics and during this time has
; had tv/o previous leaves of absence,
j one to tour the Orient with a n
j pertoire company and the other to
| study the European stage.
Organizes D-amatics
i Out of comparative chaos, Davis
for whom the position of Dramatic'
i Director was created, formed an
j artistic dramatic organization here,
| and lias been untiring in his efforts
to give the Stanford theatregoer
j the opportunity to see amateur
j productions which nearly achieve
professional perfection, lie organ-
I ized the first Dramatic Council in
j 1920 of any American university,
land developed the technical and
I art staff to a high degree.
1 Davis brought to the University
, a mastery of stage technique
gained from years of acting and
directing experience on the profc ■
i sional stage. His attitude! toward
the college theatre he expressed
j as, "At Stanford we have built, up
1 a constituency that reaches from
I San Francisco to Cannel. These,
| people have not been import urn 1
, to act as patrons and patroness* s.
They have learned to expect, that,
the play will be done in a careful,
| workmanlike manner, without.
| genius perhaps, but with infinite
1 pains and the approach at least of
the artist.
"This means that Ihe college
I theatre has come of age and put,
away childish things. II stands
alone with its youth, its vigor, and
its intelligence. In the university
theatre you may iind the brittle
wit and sophistication of high
comedy, the drama of ideas, re
vivals of standard drama and
classic tragedies."
Character Study
Davis considered the effect of
the part on the individual person.
He believed that to portray good
I characters changed the actor or
actress for the better, while tin
opposite was not true. "Had people
in bad parts do not get worse.
They bring these tendencies from
a subconscious plane out, to the
light whereithey can be seen and
mentally controlled," he said.
When Davis was in Stanford he
was a member of the English
Club, Sword and Sandals, and
other honorary societies. He was
also prominent in college dramatic
and served in the war under Un-
American flag. He has been at.
Stanford since If2o and has been
advanced from instructor in dra
matics and English to the positions
he now holds.
