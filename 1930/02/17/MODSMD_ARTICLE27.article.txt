Perhaps the mos! consistent criticism ]cvcl<*<l "at Sinn ford by 1
those who hark hack in "the dear dead days hevond recall" is J
inspired l>v the lack of social life on the campus.
'I lie highly tonled motor car for every third student makes San :
ITaucisco, San Jose, < )aklahd, and way points too convenient, it is j
aid. Stanford's social life flickers and [(lows in happy disorgani-I

This general exodus of students from the harm over week ends j
does not give vitality to Cardinal spirit, it is argued. And that argil- j
incut is reasonable enough.
I'.lit the Cardinal spirit waxed warm ITiday night, if campus
social life is any criterion. There were live dances here on the

Thai is good. The Daily does not advocate the installation of j
;n institution of cookie pushing. (Can you imagine that most virile;
and brawny of Stanford traditions the Koughâ€”enduring spats!
and tea cups ?)
lint a revival of campus sociability could be effected without
resort to those extremes. And such a revival becomes more desir-j
able with the influx of advanced students under the Lower Division I
elimination plan.* The difficulty of making the Stanford community ,
rloselv knit becomes more difficult each year.
There is the practical side, also. The Stanford Rough would |
have to dig less deeply into his cords. After all, Dumbarton bridge j
and San Krancisco cafes make serious inroads into the collegiate
bankroll.
