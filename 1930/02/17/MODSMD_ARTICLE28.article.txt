# TIBBETT AND THE LATE-COMERS
## 
### 
Although modern economists paint in glowing terms ihe picture
of a successful America with its high standard of living, there is
one. important element which has been almost crushed out of ex-j
istence by the application of liig business efficiency to modern life,
't his undeveloped aspect is the cultural one.
In college it is easy to crowd out culture. Most students don't
have time to visit art galleries and attend concerts. 'I he "shiftics" !
and the radio have almost superseded the personal enjoyment of
artisfie things.
, |
It is a privilege for the Stanford community to hear such a
famous artist as Lawrence Tibbett who will sing lonight in the
I'avilion. Californians have a special pride in the artistic success of ;
the baritone as he is a native son, having been born in ttakersfield |
and having attended school in Los Angeles where he received his:
first dramatic training under a Stanford graduate who spoke on the j
campus yesterday, Maude llowell.
Tibbett is especially appealing to a college audience as he is a j
1 vpically American singer, lie does not have the flourishing ges j
lures or the Hashes of temperament which have attached themselves |
to most opera singers, vet he has one of the most famous voices in
America. In his singing he emphasizes the songs which are truly '
\merican as all those who heard him last year will no doubt rcmern- j
her his giving "C )ld Man River."
Hut if the situation tonight parallels that which attended the
Zimbalist concert, Tibbett will have to sing something more appro- |
priate l]/ian that —"There'll He a Mot Time in the Old Town To 1
night," perhaps.
If is hoped that tonight's concert will be managed so that late- ;
comers will be kept out until a proper time, and not allowed to 1
distract the artist and the audience by stumbling in during the :
songs.
