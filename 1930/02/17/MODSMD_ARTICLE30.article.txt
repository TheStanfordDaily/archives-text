"ESCAPE." By Francesco Nitti. G.
P. Putnam's Sons, New York.
1930. Sold at the Palo Alto
Book Shop.
i Writing with facile pen the story
! of his thirty months' imprisonment
j oil Ihe island of Lipari ;is a politi
leal deportee, Francesco Nitti,
! nephew of a former prime minister
j of Italy, succeeds (piite well in pro
| ducing ;t < lioice hit of anti-Musso
lini propaganda. Convinced that
j liberty and "freedom from the ab
solutism of political and social
I dogmas" should be the major
j guides to t lie establishment of a
; successfully co-ordinating group of
: peoples, Nitti feels that Mussolini',i
! domineering policies are violently
I unjust.
j The hook is an interesting tale
of a noble attempt to withstand
: hardships, and shows an admirable
| spirit of fighting for those things
; which the author is convinced are
j best. And thrilling indeed is the
! account of the author's daring es-
I cape from the Fascisti "Devil's
We are often inclined to feel
I that the facts have been just a bit
! twisted to show Nilli's views. We
, wouldn't be quite so daring as to
| insist on using the 'term "gross
! exaggeration"; but Mr. Nille, we
I must wager, iias his romantic mo
ments.
"Escape" provides a few hours'
entertainment or amusement for

| those who still insist on the ideal
i isinh of democracy and absolute
freedom of the soul nnd spirit.

j guides to t lie establishment of a
; successfully co-ordinating group of
: peoples, Nitti feels that Mussolini',i
! domineering policies are violently
I unjust.
j The hook is an interesting tale
of a noble attempt to withstand
: hardships, and shows an admirable
| spirit of fighting for those things
; which the author is convinced are
j best. And thrilling indeed is the
