ONE IDEA ON RELIGION
I The Editor, Sir:
G. A. Johnston Ross, Acting
: Chaplain, asks for the right answei
■ to students' claim ol" the sulTiciencv
i ol" a purely secular life, tie states
that his work as a religious pi'opa
gandist is hindered hy "the clilTi
|culty presented hy the fact that
i many good, ( lean-living, and Her
1 viceahle young men and women to
(lay find all (lie wants of whieii
i they are conscious, met within the
j hounds of an entirely secular and
mundane life."
It seems to me that the ideal lift
is a full life —one which develops
the individual intellectually, mor
ally, physically, and emotionally as
i far as possible. So long as (his de
velopment is attained, the means
j is inconsequential. In my opinior
