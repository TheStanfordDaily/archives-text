# "A SORT OF INTELLECTUAL LAZINESS"

j The story of the man wlio ob- j
I jected to calendar reform because
I it would mean just another book-
I of-the-month illustrates a revolt.
which is not uncommon, against
I the frequent present-day attempts
to spoon-feed the public taste. The i
! fact that book-of-the-month clubs
exist is prima facie evidence that
ja certain section of the public, at. r
j least, because perhaps of pressure
| of time or for other reasons, is will- |
j ing to have its literary tastes dic
j fated or guided to some extent.
; We would like to feel that college
students are among those who like .
i to choose their own reading mat
tei without reference to the benev
olent literary despots.
The five-foot shelf of books is

;in old or idea Iha n the book-of-the
mo 11111 club, and also fulfils an ap
parent need for many people. It
i.s said that the late Dr. Eliot of
Harvard made his personal selec
tion of the contents of such a
bookshelf, not with any dictatorial
attitude, and that it was in a mo
ment of weakness that he consent
ed to |eiu| iiis name to the publi
cation of the volumes in a uniform
set. No doubt many people have
derived benefit from the guidance
of such recommendations, but for
a student, especially one in a lib
eral arts course, the recourse to
the works of any one set of books
merely because they are in a set
seems to exemplify a sort of in
tellectual laziness.
