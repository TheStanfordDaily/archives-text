## Veteran Alpine Runner Has Been Champion for Twelve Years in Homeland; Trounces Conger, Edwards 
### Feg Murray, '16 
| They held a little surprise party |
j in (he Newark Armory at the New
j ark A.c. games on February 5. In
!a much-heralded return match be-!
i I ween Ray Conger and Phil Ed- !
j wards at 1,000 yards, one Paul Mar
j tin stole the thunder from those
j two famous runners and defeated
I them both quite handily in the fast
i time of 2.ir> 2-5. The veteran Swiss
j campaigner's victory proved the
j upset of the evening, while he liim
! self proved anything but a setup,
! for he finished at least ten yards
! ahead of his more-famous rivals.
When I say "more-famous rivals," {
! I am referring to fame in this J
I country, but in Europe Martin is.
I far better known than Conger or
j Edwards. Martin lias been chain- I
! pion of Switzerland for twelve i
j straight years, and has defeated)
' many famous half-mile and mile \
! runners. You'd hardly expect so ;
j mountainous a country as Switzer- j
; land to produce great half-mllers, ,
but Paul Martin is not only that, :
| ho is also an accomplished surgeon j

and is now in America to study our
hospital conditions. Conger and
10(1 wards should have yelled, "Is
there a doctor in the house?" "be
fore they started their famous duel
in Newark the other night, and
when they found that one was
present, suggested to the good Mar
tin that he confine his practice to
the Swiss Navy, to mountain
climbers, to yodelers, or to cuckoo
clocks!
Dr. Paul Martin was second to
England's Douglas Lowe in the 800
meter run at the 1924 Olympic
Games in Paris six years ago. I
saw him first in Antwerp in 1920,
where he was an unsuccessful com
petitor at the age of nineteen. Two
years ago, at Amsterdam, he failed
to reach the finals in the 800 me
ters, and finished sixth in the 1500
meters. He is a great pal of Char
ley Paddock's, the two "having
toured Europe together after the
1924 Olympics. He once defeated
the Well-known Sera Martin, of
France, in an 800 meter race in th,>
fine time of 1:53.
