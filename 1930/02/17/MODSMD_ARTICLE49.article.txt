# REDSHIRTS DEFEAT SANTA CLARA NINE IN SLUGFEST, 19-13
## Cards Show Hitting Power In Conference Opener; Knock Three Homers 
### Howard Moore 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
'got a few more hits than Santa
I Clara Saturday afternoon and de
j feated the Broncos 19-13 in a wild
j slugfest. The fielding of the Red
j shirt nine was a bit spotty in
| places, hut the team showed hit -
i ting power far above Stanford
! teams in the near and distant past,
|and made an excellent start to
j ward the conference title.
; The game was full of protests,
j The Cards took unofficial time out
for about ten minutes one inning
I lo argue over a ball close to (lie
| foul line and three Santa Cla.rans
j scored during the shuffle. This
j was followed by another debate for
j five minutes over ground rules,
j Then Sheridan deliberately drop
| ped a fly to make a double play
! and Wolter's men rose in protest.
I Captain Milton Axl of the Broncos
j pulled a. couple of foxy plays at
j the plate that raised arguments,
j and a supposed passed ball and
; balk occupied more time. All that
| plus a total thirty-four hits includ
| ing four home runs, two triples,
j and eight doubles made a very
| amusing game even if there were'
' no peanuts.
Lead See-Saws
j The Cards started off with three
tallies in the firsl frame, but Coach
Owens' men countered with an-
I other trio. Kelly doubled in the
j second to start a rally which put j
I across three more, and Hie Mis- \
! sion players jumped into an 8-0 i
lead when they shoved over five '
digits in the third canto. Stanford
! came back with a quintet of runs
1 in the si-xth to take the lead at j
| 11-8, but the Broncos retaliated
| with three scores in their half to
j knot the count.
I In the eighth, the Cards jumped !
! into a one-run lead, and then came |
| the eventful ninth. Three home |
I runs off the bats of Churchill, Rin- i
j tala, and Hunken, plus a bunch of j
j singles, made seven markers for
( tills spree during which twelve men
i went to t lie plate. Santa Clara
: staged a ninth-inning rally and
made two runs and stueked the
| bases without an out against them.
I Taylor was rushed in and almost
! broke his hand stopping a hot liner
! on the next play, but it was good
for a double play and the next man
| was called out on strikes.
Perry Churchill, second baseman,
i was elected field captain for the
| game. In the future the team will
J elect a field captain before each
j conference tilt to act in place of
I Captain Laird.
