### BY WILLIAM WALLS 
"With Templeton luck and Tem
j pleton starting blocks Stanford will
! beat U.s.C.'s track team this year,"
admitted Charley Paddock in an
interview for the Daily Saturday.
"Stanford lias an optimistic out
, look for the season," said the for
mer U.S.C. star. "Although the
'sprinters were a little disappoint
ing Friday, they can not be ex
pected to reach their top form for
some time yet and probably will
j not attain their peak until mid
j season."
In regard to his former press
statement that Dyer might beat
] Wyckoff of Southern California,
Paddock explained that he was
; speaking of the Wyckoff of last
j year. "The WvckolT of this year is
ja different edition. He is again in
i his 1928 season form," he said.
Concerning the use of starting
i blocks introduced by "Dink" Tem-
I pleton, Stanford coach, the veteran
: sprinter was reticent. "I do not

â–  believe that the use of the starting i
j aids will become generally accept- j
jed and recognized for some time," i
he stated.
Paddock left Saturday night for '
the East. He regretted being un
able to participate in the field event I
scheduled for some time in the fu- !
ture between the L. A. Athletic!
| Club and Stanford, but said "Stau
i lord will probably be taken into |
i camp without my help."
