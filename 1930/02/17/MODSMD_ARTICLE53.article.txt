# STORMS CAPTURES MILE AND 880 IN FAST TIME FRIDAY
## 
### Ted De Motte 
Allen Storms, junior transfer
student, furnished the feature ex-|
hibition of the Friday meet when
he pulled the "iron man" stuff to
take both the mile and the SBO in
fast early-season times of 4:34 2-5 1
and 1:58 3-5 respectively. If he is !
declared eligible for competition |
this year, it may mean the differ- i
ence between victory and defeat j
tor the Cards in the U.S.C. meet, j
There is a good chance that he will I
be able to compete.
Hables again had too much finish j
for Dyer, and took both sprints in ,
even times. Morrison took the lead j
on the turn and won the 440 in |
