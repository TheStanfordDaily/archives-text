## 
### Ted De Motte 
Allen Storms, junior transfer
student, furnished the feature ex-|
hibition of the Friday meet when
he pulled the "iron man" stuff to
take both the mile and the SBO in
fast early-season times of 4:34 2-5 1
and 1:58 3-5 respectively. If he is !
declared eligible for competition |
this year, it may mean the differ- i
ence between victory and defeat j
tor the Cards in the U.S.C. meet, j
There is a good chance that he will I
be able to compete.
Hables again had too much finish j
for Dyer, and took both sprints in ,
even times. Morrison took the lead j
on the turn and won the 440 in |
4!) 3-5 seconds. Eastman, frosli.
was second and was timed in 50 2-5
seconds. Smith, minus the competi
tion of Nisbet, topped the high
.sticks in 15 seconds flat, and ran
Hie lows in 24 1-5 seconds, times
that would win plenty of hurdle
races in mid-season.
Krenz took the discus with a
throw of 151 feet, 5Va inches, and
won the shot at 4S feet, 2 inches.
Here Laborde took seconds in both
events, ilis 145 feet in the discus
and 45 feet, 2V£ inches in the shot
show that Dink's predictions of a
brilliant future for him are not far
astray. George Gray, sophomore,
took third in the discus with a
throw of J 40 feet 7 inches.
Chvrlie Paddock, former cham
pion sprinter, met defeat in his
100-yard special race witli Johnny
Lauritzen in 10 1-5 seconds, but
nosed out Herb Fleishhacker to
win a 440 by inches in 1 minute
and 20 seconds, or approximately
seconds above the world's rec
ord.
The high jump, pole vault, and
javelin throw, and the distances
are the Cards' weak events. Arnold
broad-jumped 21! feet, 3% inches
and Butler 23 feet 3 inches.
