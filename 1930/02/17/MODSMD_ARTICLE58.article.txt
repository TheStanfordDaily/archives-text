# GEYSER GURGLES HERE
## Why Visit Yellowstone? BOILERS CAUSE SPOUT 
### 
Stanford's "Old Faithful" spouts
only 011 Wednesdays, Thursdays,
and Fridays.
Sixty-five paces from the upper
Engineering Corner in the parking
along the front of the M.E. "heat"
lab there is a small geyser. The
water and steam gurgles up a sec
ond, then recedes again.
The phenomenon is caused by an
expansion valve on one of the boil
ers opening intermittently into a
leaky drain pipe. Steam is main
tained for laboratory use only on
Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fri
days from one to four o'clock.
