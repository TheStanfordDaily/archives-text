# CLEMENCE DANE IS AUTHOR OF 'A BILL OF DIVORCEMENT,' 'WILL SHAKESPEARE'
## 
### Catherine Spaulding 
i Perhaps better known than
i "Granite," the English Club play
j which is to be presented to the
campus February 28, are Clemence
I Dane's plays "Will Shakespeare"
and "A Hill of Divorcement." The
latter was successfully produced
in San Francisco, and both have
| contributed to the established rep
utation of the author in the field
j of dramatics.
Profitable comparison between
j the plays is difficult because Miss
| Dane is not one of those authors
I who work in a groove, and the idea
i and manner of each is unique. The
i home problem and its realism give
i "A Bill of Divorcement" an emo
tional appeal—the pathos of the
j unloved husband who is divorced
' because of insanity, and who re
covers to find his wife in love with
1 another man.
This play is based on a law that
it a man is incurably insane, his

I wife is entitled to her freedom, and
in setting is a post-war play look
ing backward, as the action takes
place on Christmas Day in 1932.
Based on Sonnets
"Will Shakespeare" does not
claim to he true to history, and
portrays the great poet as the lover
I of Mary Fitton, the Dark Lady of
the sonnets, and the rival of Mar
lowe. Here Shakespeare was eon
| cerned more with the rights and
, wrongs of his love than with its
j beauty and its ugliness.
The mystical melodrama "Gran
j it e," which relies a great deal </n
atmosphere—and upon the inter
vention of the Nameless Man —or.
perhaps, Devil —who gives every
. thing just on the wrong side of
; perfect achievement, is perhaps
the most startling of the three and
is a masterpiece in its clever con
struction. In this play. Miss Dane
shows her power to feel in dra-
I matic terms.
