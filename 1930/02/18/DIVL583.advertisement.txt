Reis pajamas
of Burton s Irish Poplin /
with "Jim-Lastic" belt....
]
Here's a pajama that is smart looking, but not
loud enough to give you a nightmare...Slightly
fitted at the waist, and has the comfortable,
patented, " Jim-Lastic " belt... All in pastel
shades of two-tone combinations ... As for
laundering, the more you wash Burton's
Irish Poplin, the better
it looks.
