# OLD FORTIFIED HOUSE IS SETTING FOR DANE'S TRAGEDY "GRANITE"
## 
### BY CATHERINE SPAULDING 
Situated on Dundy Island, ;i very
old house which has in all proba
bility stood there since Ihe, island
was inhabited, forms the sotting
lor ('lemcnce Dane's tragedy.
"Granite," and lends sonic; of Ihe
atmosphere so necessary to the
play.
The room in which all of the
action takes place has an immense
fireplace which furnishes practi
cally all the light in the room since
ihe windows are little narrow slits
built, for protection. The general
appearance is hard and crude, and
the furniture, which is being made
by the Theatre Workshop class, is
almost, finished.
The present occupants probably
roofed over the old granite castle
whose roof and beams fell in,
rotted by the fierce storms so com
mon on the rocky island. However
the living room at, the time still
presents a fortress-like quality of
earlier days and looks almost hewn

t out of the granite itself.
A few unframed prints are the j
j only pictures and These are stuck [
to the wall, glass and molding be- |
ing unknown at the time. A copy I
of a steel engraving of Nelson's j
Victory is being made for the sets.
Tn the corner of the room hangs j
a bell on a rope which connects the
ground floor to the rooms above..
Watchers during a storm ring this i
j as a warning that ships have been I
] wrecked, or to indicate any sort J
'fit' danger. A stairway, without a|
, railing, also goes to Ihe upper floor, i
j and its crude, hand-hewn appear-]
ance lends an atmosphere of hard, !
j unyielding granite.
A storm on the rocky coasts of I
I the Island during the play fur-|
j lushes a further eerie touch and
jibe sound of the surf breaking,
j against, the rocks and the wind i
moaning around the granite cliffs
I tunes the audience to a high ten
i sion for the expected melodramatic
| happening.
