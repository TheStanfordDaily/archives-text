# TIBBETT IS APPLAUDED IN CONCERT
## "Roustabout Song," "Old Man River" Favorites With Audience 
### Ruth Miner 
More gracious even than lie was
lust year, Lawrence Tibbett en
tranced a responsive audience of
2300 in the Pavilion last night to
(he music of Verdi's "Credo, from
Othello," and of "Old Man Itiver,"
for which lie is so well-remem
bered.
Building song upon song in his
program and varying each succes
sive number with a different tem
perament, he rose to the height of
the evening in the "Prologue from
Pagliacci," a dramatization givinu
a wide range for his resounding
voice.
Putting himself into every song,
and he is an actor, lie holds the
audience to his own feeling, hold
ing the crowd breathless during
the two offerings of Frank
La Forge's "Retreat" and letting it
chuckle while lie sang the non
sensical "My Old Nag Ned," com
edy which he seemed to enjoy for
its rhythm and story.
Transitions from high delicacy
to subtle ribaldry he made with
apparent ease, although his voice
did show the wear of too frequent
ly succeeding concert appearances.
His facial expression for those iu
front was real and his stage smile
was as if he were genuinely happy.
Stewart Wille at the piano gave
an excellent accompaniment, blend
ing his tones especially in "Le
The" by Koechlin. His piano solos
were well received and he played
for his encore "Claire de Lune" by
De Hussy.
From many requests he chose to
sing Sumerville's "Kingdom of the
Sea," "The Cloths of Heaven" by
Dunhill, Wagner's "Evening Star"
from Tannhauser, and his famous
Moussorgski "Song of the Flea."
