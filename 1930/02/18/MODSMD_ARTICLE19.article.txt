# Time For Definite Action
## 
### 
(Editorial)
A petition was circulated on the campus last uiglil requesting
that the Board of Athletic Control terminate K. I\ limit's con
nection with the I uiversity as basketball coach. The petition and
statements by I hint have been given wide publicity by the press
associations and various newspapers.
I he fact that the situation lies in the public eye makes it im
pcrative that the parties concerned guard against hysteria. In
justice is too often done in the heat of excitement.
II must be remembered, also, that the signing of petitions has
no importance other than reflecting the opinion of a portion of
the students. And that value is small, since the Hoard of Ath
letic < ontrol and the Hoard of Athletic ( ontrol only has power
to take official action in this matter.
I he Hoard owes it to the I Diversify and to Loach Hunt to
| take immediate and final action, one way or the other. Such a
situation must not be allowed to drag through all the stages of
undesirable publicity.
