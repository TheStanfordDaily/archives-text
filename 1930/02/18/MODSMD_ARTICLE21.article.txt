# RAYMOND T. BIRGE FINISHING LECTURES ON "BAND SPECTRA"
## 
### 
Professor Raymond T. Birge,
physicist from the University of
California, yesterday afternoon con
eluded the series of four lectures
on "Band Spectra" conducted by
the Department of Chemistry over
a period of a month.
I The study of hand spectra is a
i comparatively new one, having
i been begun in l!)IK. At the present
time, not more than half a dozen
I scientists may be classed as "au
j thorities" on the subject. By means
of the results obtained by study of
j these spectra, mathematical rela
j lions between frequencies of vibra
I lions in atoms may be computed,
i As the work progresses, more and
j more knowledge of the structure
[of I lie atoni will be, obtained.
