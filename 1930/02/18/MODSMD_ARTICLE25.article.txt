# EARTH PROBE FAILS TO REVEAL EXPECTED HIGH TEMPERATURES

NKYV YORK, Feb. 17. (/p) Man's
| deepest elect rim I probe into earth
:;o miles and the surprising
! story it told were reported to the
! American Institute ol Mining and
Metallurgical Engineers here to
| day.
The surprise was failure to lind
j the high temperatures and hot
| rocks expected. Except for read
ling the messages of earthquake
j waves this electrical probe, was
j said to be the deepest man yet has
! explored by any method.
Two Frenchmen, Conrad and
; Marcel Schluniberger, originators
of the electrical probe, made the
|:j(Mnile soundings. Support for the
credibility of their daring report
was furnished by another speaker,
Theodor Zuschlag, who gave tliei»
device credit for discovery of un
derground salt domes in Rumania
and Alsace.
The Frenchmen apply an electri
cal current to the ground at two

points, with hare electrodes. The
ground completes the circuit. Fur
Ihermorc flip ground shows resist
mice to passage of the current and i
t lie Frenchmen <• la im that they can [
measure this resistance.
Measuring it give* a broad pic
hire of the shape, nature, and tem
pernture of the rocks beneath, they
say, because the amount of resist
ance depends upon the character
of crust. The depth of measurement
is about one-quarter the distance
between the two electrodes on the
surface.
In Britanny, France, in the
neighborhood of Vitro, they set two
electrodes 125 miles apart. This
gave them about 30 miles of depth.
"The authors," their report says,
"had expected to find lowering of
festivity at very groat depths, due
to the rise in temperature of the
rocks. Hut this was not the case.
Perhaps it will be necessary to
reach much greater depths in order
to discover such a diminution.
