# GORDON DAVIS AND THE NEW THEATRE
## 
### 
I hose vvlio have watched the growth and development of drama
on this campus realize (hat Stanford has suffered a loss through the
resignation of (iordon Davis, for ten wars director of dramatics
here.
In (en years Mavis raised Stanford dramatics from practically
nothing to a high place in the university field. The Stanford stage
r known from coast to coast for the <|tialitv of its productions.
To use his own words, Davis is now taking part "in the develop
ment ol an art which is hound In its popularity to have a profound
influence upon a vast audience"â€”the talking pictures, lie is des
tined for success in that field, and deserves such success.
During his years at Stanford (lordon Davi* produced finished
drama under the handicap of a barn like theatre. During those
years he was one of the strongest supporters of the drive for a new
and suitable building.
It is hojwd that others will continue to further the project, now
that Davis has left the I.'diversity.
