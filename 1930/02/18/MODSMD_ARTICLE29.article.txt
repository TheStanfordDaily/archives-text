# BEAUTY AND SAFETY
## 
### 
As is pointed out by the I'ulo . 1110 '/ inu'\, the. city and university
will benefit mutually by the recent decision of the Hoard of Trus
tees to improve the campus entrance at I'aim Drive and Kl ("amino
Real.
Stanford is appropriately following the lead of Palo Alto in its
beautification program. The city's new plaza and the university's
new entrance will mean much to both, and will attract many visitors
who would otherwise drive by.
Hut more important than gateways and plaza is the problemati
cal stop and go signal that is to be installed on the intersection of
Calm Drive, blowers and sandstone may add an attractive touch,
hut they won't add to the safety <>r the convenience of a dangerous
and troublesome intersection.
