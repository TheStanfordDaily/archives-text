it itn 1 ion of a preferential voting system, for the one now in use,
the reduction of the period for nominations, the establishment of
the president of the \ssociated Women Students as a member of
the Executive Committee, the replacement of the sophomore and
junior elective members of the < onimittee with the respective class
presidents, and the definite limitation of the period of bonfiire con
( >ut of the group, the restriction' on the bonfire building time is
the only proposal which will undoubtedly meet with the unqualified
approval of the student body generally. Preferential voting, if a
manipulation-proof system is used, should enable the committee on
elections to dispense with the nuisance of holding two elections,
earning thereby the thanks of the entire student group. In some
methods of preferential balloting, however, a minority by selecting
their strongest opposing candidate and voting their preferences cor
rectly, can elect a less popular man.
Hefore the president of the A.W.S. is given a place on the Ex
ecutive ( onimittee, attention should lie called to the fact that there
are already two representatives on the committee of nine and one
ex officio member. If the student bodv wishes representation to be
in proportion to the number of men and women at Stanford, it will
reject this proposal.
The suggested replacement of the present sophomore and
junior members of the I'.x Committee with the respective, class
presidents will merit more criticism than any of the changes con
templated. These two members are now elected by the entire student
body to present a point of view, not to represent a class in the nar
row sense of the word, ( lass distinctions have practically disap

preserved by maintaining the present method of representation from
the electorate at large.

of filling the Ex Committee membership be accomplished without i
