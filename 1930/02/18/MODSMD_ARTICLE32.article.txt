Louis and Lizzie llougliim are
j two Norwegians who live a I'airly
happy and contented Iil<• on :t mid
western farm until they begin to
worship Iho goldpieces and hunk
notes which ihey hide about their
! home.
! Avarice becomes the one motive
of tiieii lives. They live wretched
j ly, caring nothing for each other or
i for anything except their money.
I The failure of a hank to which
I they had entrusted a, portion of
( their savings, the loss of a I lion
j nantl dollars to n confidence man,
'and the burning of their house
1 when Ihey refused to subscribe to
t the Ketl Cross during the war, only
| servo lo make tliein more deler
! mined and more hitler in .their
| quest of money.
The plot is a, strong one, and it
is completely unified. The charac
ters have childish minds, which,
! when obsessed, make monsters of
! them.
Yel something is lacking in the
book. II hears very many reseni
j blances to the sort of thing thai
• was produced in Russia lifty years
I ago, an era that is now of the past.
Moreover, I lie story points too
j obvious a moral. One must know
I from the first, that avarice will
make miserable the protagonists
of the title, and that they will guin
j nothing from lheir store of money,
j When this is overemphasized it
I loses force.
A realist should not abandon
; realism if lie is to secure the
[greatest of dramatic effects. The
j close of the novel, when the two
j misers have frozen to death, and
j smoke is curling from the old
clothes which have hidden in litem
the $70,000, for which two lives
j had been made miserable, is far
i too trite and out of lone lo lie
' I ruly powerful.

The then™ of "Pure Gold" could
h;ive been bundled more success
fully if il had been treated from
ii frankly romantic view, or if it
had been h'ss dramatically well
constructed anil obvious, but more
realistic. As it is, the best features
of both types of art are lost.
Rol vaag indulges in the satires
of war-time chauvinism which are
now to be found in practically
every author of note, but he does
not. do il particularly well. In sa
tire he is not a rival of Lewis, in
clia.rueler portrayal and realism he
is not an equal of Dreiser or Willa
rather. —E. E. W.
THIS THING CALLED LOVE
at tilt- New Stanford.
Ilin i-, a good example of low
comedy dressed up but not too much
disturbed as to be uproarously funny.
Low comedy is generally associated
with pie-tbrowing and other such mis
haps. There is no pie-throwing in
"This Thing ( ailed Love," and the
plot is laid in high social cirles. Nev
ertheless there is nothing subtle about
it.
The story is of course an almost
preposterous exaggeration, but this
very exaggeration makes it amusing.
Imagine a husband coughing backing
gingerly out of the room when he
luuls his wife in another man's arms!
The plot is too complicated to try to
explain briefly. There is a tangled
mixture of husbands and wives, other
men and women, who all manage to
end up still neatly paired off.
The dialogue is snappy and always
audible; the jokes never take longer
than a minute to get across. Constance
liennctt who is most beautiful, Ruth
Taylor, and Kdtmmd Lowe arc all in
the cast. XaSu Pitts also plays one of
the leads. She is cast in a different
role than usual : of the wives who
thinks that "men are swine," and she
plays this part with great success. All
in all "litis Tiling Called Love" is an
attempt at humor which really arrives
there. -—N. V.

Low comedy is generally associated
with pie-tbrowing and other such mis
haps. There is no pie-throwing in
"This Thing ( ailed Love," and the
plot is laid in high social cirles. Nev

it.
The story is of course an almost
preposterous exaggeration, but this
very exaggeration makes it amusing.
Imagine a husband coughing backing
gingerly out of the room when he
luuls his wife in another man's arms!
The plot is too complicated to try to
explain briefly. There is a tangled
mixture of husbands and wives, other
men and women, who all manage to
end up still neatly paired off.
The dialogue is snappy and always
audible; the jokes never take longer
than a minute to get across. Constance
liennctt who is most beautiful, Ruth
Taylor, and Kdtmmd Lowe arc all in
the cast. XaSu Pitts also plays one of

thinks that "men are swine," and she
plays this part with great success. All
