## NINE YEARS OF DECLINE 
### 
Tilf Editor, Sir:
Believe it or not, but Stanford
won the basketball championship
of the Pacific Coast in 1920 and
1021. Stanford was represented by
REAL teams in (hose two years. In
1922 began a decline which could
reasonably be expected to last for
two, three, or possibly four years.
Hut instead, it litis lasted for nine.
The situation seems to be growing
worse each season and there is no
relief in sight—at present !
For the last three years the
Stanford frosh have had excellent
teams. The Class of *:U had the
best basketball material that ever
entered Stanford. This class as
frosh lost only one game during the
season and that to the California
frosh. The ('hiss of '32 had some
excellent material. They lost only
one or two games. One of these
losses was at the hands of the
undefeated Santa Clara, frosh by a
score fo 31 to 2!). The freshman
learn this year also looks good.
The varsity team in 1929 verged
on being good but. they couldn't
beat California. That team was
composed of a majority of sopho
mores, who put. plenty of spirit into
their playing in addition to some
excellent basketball —at. times.
With the same team back again
this year, Stanford was supposed
to he the favorite to win (ho South
ern Division championship. The

! team started out great by running
tip a record score against the Col
lege ol' Pacific. Stanford may not
have had very much opposition,
j lint nevertheless the team showed
real possibilities. Stanford students
had visions of those long-forgotten
years of '20 and '21, when BASKET
BALL was played on the Farm.
This score was a record for Stan
ford and then the very next week
the team went down to L.A. and
! took one of the worst beatings a
Stanford team has ever taken. The
| score was 03 to 30. This was a Con
i ference record, but Stanford ought
to be ashamed of it. Since.then the
team lias steadily declined until it
' is now back at the same old place
j Si an ford lias occupied for a ma
| jority of the last NINE YEARS—
I THE CELLAR! This situation
j passed the laughing stage about
live seasons ago. It has become a
j disgrace to the fair name which
j Stanford so ably supports in track
and football.
The situation would not be so
| bad if Stanford did not. have 1 lie
' material, but it has as good ma
■j terial as any school on. the Coast.
! We also have a coach?
What is wrong? Everybody
I knows what is wrong, but nobody
; does anything about it. The time
for something to be done has been
' here for the last five years. Some
! tiling should be done, and DONE
j NOW! —Plenty Griped, '31.
