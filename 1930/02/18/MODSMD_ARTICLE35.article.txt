Tim Editor, Sir:
A ft'w days ago a certain gentle
man inquired as to the indifference
of modernity to religion. I do not
believe that this findifference) is
a fact. The worship may be be
stowed npon another belief; but it
is still there. It would be silly to
state that people no longer travel,
inasmuch as they no longer use
horse-and-buggy outfits; it is simi
jlarly erroneous to suggest that
the modern generation (from 7 to

' 7d) is irreligious. Tl lias merely in
i corporaled into its creed (new) n
great many ideas and ideals which
are not orthodox to the aged tongs.
Ueiigion once offered all the
available art and culture to its fol
lowers. Magazines, books, radios,
transportation facilities, Mr. White
and Mr. Carroll very brutally pre
sent fd the public with a ih'w type
and brand. It succeeded. Too w«* 11
for the once flourishing business
ot respectable religion.

T( may be asked What and Who
is the object of veneration in Ibis
so-called new religion. I would sug
gest pleasure; I would mention
ambition; I would offer courage;
I would include common sense;
I would insert intelligence; I would
present art; I would conclude cul
ture.
Owner: 1 can't understand why
you can't rent this building.
Renting Agent: I told you it's
cut of date.
Owner: It's always rented well.
R.A.: Doubtlessly. Mill if you
want it handled you have to put
in some modern trimmings.
O.: And if I don't?
U.A.: You'd better raze if.
().: I'll let it stand as it is; I
think this is only a temporary lull.
R.A.: That's your business. Prog
ress doesn't go backwards. If you
wait for gas fixtures to become
stylish, you'll be broke; if you wait
for walk-ups to become fashion
able, you'll be forgotten.
O.: But even if 1 renovate it, I
can hardly compete with the newer
buildings.
It.A.: Quite right. Only I hated
to tell you. Take a tip. Chuck it.
You've gotten out of it all that is
in it. Donate il to the days that
are past.
Personal opinion? Precisely.
Radical? Exactly. Wrong? 1 shall
say I hope so. On the other hand,
I'm afraid I'm right. —'30.

you can't rent this building.
Renting Agent: I told you it's
cut of date.
Owner: It's always rented well.
R.A.: Doubtlessly. Mill if you
want it handled you have to put
in some modern trimmings.
O.: And if I don't?
U.A.: You'd better raze if.

think this is only a temporary lull.
R.A.: That's your business. Prog

wait for gas fixtures to become
stylish, you'll be broke; if you wait
for walk-ups to become fashion
able, you'll be forgotten.

Tim Editor, Sir:
A ft'w days ago a certain gentle
man inquired as to the indifference
of modernity to religion. I do not
believe that this findifference) is
a fact. The worship may be be
stowed npon another belief; but it
is still there. It would be silly to
state that people no longer travel,
inasmuch as they no longer use
horse-and-buggy outfits; it is simi
jlarly erroneous to suggest that
the modern generation (from 7 to

' 7d) is irreligious. Tl lias merely in
i corporaled into its creed (new) n
great many ideas and ideals which
are not orthodox to the aged tongs.
Ueiigion once offered all the
available art and culture to its fol
lowers. Magazines, books, radios,
transportation facilities, Mr. White
and Mr. Carroll very brutally pre
sent fd the public with a ih'w type
and brand. It succeeded. Too w«* 11
for the once flourishing business
ot respectable religion.

T( may be asked What and Who
is the object of veneration in Ibis
so-called new religion. I would sug
gest pleasure; I would mention
ambition; I would offer courage;
I would include common sense;
I would insert intelligence; I would
