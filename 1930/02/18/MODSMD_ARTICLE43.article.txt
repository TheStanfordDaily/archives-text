# BASEBALL TEAM MEETS BRONCOS HERE WEDNESDAY
## Welter's Team Holds One Victory Over Santa Clara By Large Score 
### 
After taking a wild slugging bee
from Santa Clara Saturday after
noon to start tlie conference stand
ings with a 1.000 percentage, Coach
Harry Wolter's varsity diamond
iirlistH took things a hit easier yes
terday and calmed down to prepare
for Wednesday's hat tie. Woltev
pave the hoys a little pep talk ex
plaining it lew plays and correcting
the miscues of Saturday's game.
Tomorrow afternoon the Cards
will take on the Brontos again,
this lime on the local diamond and
I'iom the looks of things, the var
sity is in for iis second win, Myles
Regan will probably do the chuc k
ing for the Mission aggregation,
and last year the Redshirts
knocked htm out of the box. Added
to that the Santa Clarans are a
bil weak at hitting curve balls, and
if Taylor pitches for the home
team, a few of 1110 boys down the
road will be doing a lot of swing
ing.
Jim Kelly, who is handling third
base now that Laird is out of the !
game, has been turning in some
nice work. He handled four ground
ers and three putouts in Saturday's
till without a single bobble and was
tile leading batter, getting four
bingles out of five trips to the plat
ter. flooded seems to be locating
first base with bis foot a little
belter and the infield as a whole j
is turning out smoother work.
