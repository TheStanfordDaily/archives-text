# Tall "Ichabod Crane of Baseball" in 1928 Knocked Out Six Four-Baggers in Six Successive Days

Manager Hob Shawkey expressed '
satisfaction over the purchase of
Ken Williams, veteran outfielder, J
I at the waiver price from the Bos
ton Red Sox. The public was as
sured, incidentally, that the deal 1
was not put through due to any I
apprehension felt concerning Babe
J Ruth's attitude toward Colonel '
Ruppert's generous offer of $75,000
a year. I would think that Mana
ger Bob would express satisfaction
at getting the thirty-six-year-old
Williams. Ken is just six months i
older than Babe, and, like Jack |
Dempsey, may be slowing up in j
the legs but still has a terrific
sock!
Last season Williams was used
'in 74 games and batted .340, one
point higher than Ruth, who played
135 games, and who scored exact
ly 100 more runs than Ken. In 1928,
Williams' first season in Boston, ,
! the veteran played more or less I
: regularly (133 games) and hit .303, 1
In the nine straight years previous j
i to that, during which time the i
icadaverous looking Kenneth Roy ;
i Williams was a fixture in the out
j field of the St. Louis Browns, he
i only once, in 192<Â», failed to hat

.300 or bettor. 'There is no reason
to believe tlint the tall "lehabod
Crane" of baseball will not. smack
out plenty of four-base drives into
the rightfield bleachers of the
Yankee Stadium in 1930.
Years ago Ken used to-be a con
tender in the annual major league
home run derby, along with Cy
Williams of the Phillies. The two
Williamses are not relatives, but
both batted exactly the same, fig
uro, .331, in 192. r >, which is some
thing of a coincidence. Ken holds
several home run records, such as
making three home runs in one
game, two in one inning, seven in
six consecutive games, and so on,
but probably his greatest batting
feat was the following: In six con
secutive games, on July 28, 29, 30,
31, Aug. 1, and 2, 1922, Ken got
six four-base wallops, and a homer
was his one safe hit in each of
the first five games.
