# Big Colleges Are Most Appreciative Audiences-Tibbett
## 
### Ruth Miner 
"Large universities like Stanford
are most expressive and I enjoy
playing to them because naturally
I like the audiences that like me,"

said Lawrence
Tibbett between
11 u 111 be r s last
night. "Small col
leges are more
still' and reserved,
a little afraid,
perhaps, to show
feeling.

"Generally :i young audience, if
il is not too carefully trained, will
show its appreciation and enthu
siasm. The songs I present, ill
though they are not so familiar to
thi! audience, are probably morfc
the kind we like, since I am not
.yet so very old myself." lie smiled I
with his rare twisted combination
of wrinkles and twinkles.
"I am glad the audience liked
"Retreat" by Frank La Forge, be
cause I enjoy singing it and I be
lieve it is one of the best he has
written. You know lie was xny i
teacher for some eight years.
"The only languages I know of
those I sing are Italian, and well,
a little American. I understand ;
French and German and do like '
the German school of music.
"The cold-hearted manner of giv- \
inn songs in the production of
talkies is of course disagreeable 1
and unresponsive because there ,
can be no applause or it, would be j
recorded 100.
"Hut I like to work in movies.
It is an odd and interesting feeling
to hear yourself sing and talk and i
to see your own acting. It gives
you an unparalleled sensation,"
and lie shivered, maybe from the'
idea but maybe from the dressing
room temperature, since he did it j
often during the interview.
Tibbett, with his wife, Grace, is I
visiting Mr. and Mrs. Charles G.
Norris in Palo Alto. Mrs. Tibbett i
will return immediately to Los An-j
geles bul he, on his way north and j
east for 20 or more concerts, will j
appear in Sacramento tonight, lie
will also sing some opera in New i
York before he returns to his I
Jleverly Hills home early in the j
summer to make two movies for i
which he has contracted.
Just as he was returning l<> the j
stage and as the applause for Stew- j
art Wille's piano encores was at j
its height, a sudden loud burst of |
tone came from the baritone, pre
paring for the "Credo from Othel- '
lo," by Verdi.
