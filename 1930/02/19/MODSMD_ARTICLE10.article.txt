# HOOVER SEEKS REPUBLICAN AID IN TARIFF ROW
## Breakfast Conference At White House Clears Atmosphere Watson, Republican Leader Satisfied With Stand 
### 
| WASHINGTON, Feb. IX. (/V)
! President Hoover called upon Re*
! publican Congressional leaders lo
i flay to enact the tariff bill and his
| conference blew up a storm of ora*
I tory and statement-making on

Capitol Hill which
cleared the air.
The 1 louse chief
tains later gloom
ily discussed the
outlook for legisla
tion while the Sen
ate members of
th e president ial
breakfast pa rt y
were back in the
tariff-bound Senate
urging speed and
promising t ho tariff
bill by March 10.

I The oratory centered there where
I the Democratic-Republican coali
| tion has control.
Senator Harrison, Democrat, Mis
| sisippi, wanted to know what kind
of hill Hoover wanted â€”the high
! tariff measure passed by the House
j or the revised bill eliminating ;ill
j but agricultural increases being
| written in the Senate.
Replying, Senator Watson, of
I Indiana, the Republican leader, said
j the President "wants a tariff bill
passed." He declared no rates had
been discussed, and maintained
! emphatically that the high tariff
j measure passed by the House "no
! longer exists."
{ The White House breakfastcrs
j were satisfied after (he parley thai
| Hoover was standing by the Sen
: ;ite Republican leadership, which
i was adversely criticized yesterday
; by Representative Tilson, of COll
- necticut, I lie House Republican
I fioor leader. The House leader's
j threat, to recess pending final ac
j tion by the Senate on the tariff
was withdrawn.
