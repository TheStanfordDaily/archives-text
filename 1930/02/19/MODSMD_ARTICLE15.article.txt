# BETAS WIN LEAGUE BASKETBALL TITLE IN POOR EXHIBITION
## 
### 
In one of the worst exhibitions
of basketball recently seen on Stan-
ford courts Beta Theta Pi won
their league championship last
night, defeating El Tigre 11-9.
Three shots by Ticknor in the
first few minutes of the second
half gave the fraternity quintet a
two-point lead, and incidentally
ended the scoring for the game. A
total of lour field goals scored dur
ing the contest gave. Ticknor high
point honors.
Two fancy long shots by Jurs
contributed largely to establishing
El Tigre's 9-5 lead at half-time.
Smith played a good floor game for
the Betas, but his attempts to push
the oval through the basket were
pitiful.
The Beta - El Tigre fracas was
the only one of four scheduled
games to be played. Alpha Kappa
Lambda won by default from Se-
quoia II; Phi Sigma Kappa won
from Alpha Sigma Phi by default;
and both Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
Sigma Nu failed to put in an ap-
pearance.
Games scheduled for tonight are
as follows:
Pavilion at 7 — Delta Tau Delta
vs. Theta Chi; Pavilion at 8 — Los
Arcos vs. Phi Kappa Psi; Gymna-
sium at 7 — Dark Horses vs. Break-
ers; Gymnasium at 8 — Kappa
Alpha vs. Newman Club.
