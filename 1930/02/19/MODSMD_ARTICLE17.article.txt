ASTORIA, Oregon, Feb. fB. (/pj
Standing a lonely watch on the I
bridge of his command to protect !
from bands of small boat pirates, !
Captain Charles Graham alone re
mained aboard the atranded coast
al liner Admiral Hen son tonight. j
As darkness settled over Pea- j
cock Spit, north of the mouth of j
j Hie Columbia river, Captain Gra
j ham's figure was still faintly visi-
I ble to watchers a 1 the Fort Can by
; Coast Guard station. Throughout,
I the afternoon he paced the bridge
| of the disabled steamer and from j
j all indications planned to maintain j
! his vigil through the night. The |
last of the crew, the three mates j
I and chief radio operator, c ame j
ashorl in a lifeboat this morning. |
i They reported water in the engine '
j room of the Admiral Unison had
I reached the upper platform and
I that the vessel's holds were vir
tually flooded. The water in t h«• j
j holds was pumped there, they said, |
[to prevent the vessel from pound-|
| ing against the sand of tho spit, j
but that in the engine room seeped j
i in through the shaft, alley.
Captain Graham was not regard- |
ed in danger. Should the Admiral!
Benson start to break up, the haw- !
'ser connecting it with the shore is |
still in place and a breeches buoy j
could be rigged up by Coast |
Guardsmen in a few minutes.
