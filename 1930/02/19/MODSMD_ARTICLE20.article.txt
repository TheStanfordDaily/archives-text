# CARD CAGERS IN STIFF WORKOUT
## Team Prepares For Third Tilt With California 
### 
Ostensibly oblivious lo the storm
iof protest raging around tiie per
| son of their couch, a horde of Red
j shirt varsity cagers last night
whirled through one of the most
spirited workouts of the season in
preparation for the third and final
game ol' the California series slated
for Saturday night in the Pavilion.
In the Cardinals' hands lies the
i opportunity to definitely knock the
j Hears out of a chance for the con
| ferenco championship, inasmuch as
ia third consecutive Blue and Gold
j triumph on Saturday night, cou
pled with a U.C.L.A. victory over
| Southern California will leave the
I Hears and the Trojans tied at the
; top of the conference heap. Sam
I Barry's men, however, can make
| the title a mathematical certainty
| by taking the llclans' measure,
Tripp Is Problem
Indications were that Hunt would
pin his hopes on the same com
bination that started last Saturday
i night against the Bears. The big
problem that fac.es him, however,
is that of keeping Wilson Tripp,
the California sucker-shot artist,
from getting too many set ups. Had
not Tripp had a bad night last Sat
urday, and missed as many hole
shots as ho registered, the Bears'
margin of victory would have been
much larger, for the Cal forward
had plenty of opportunities.
Two Redshirts will be playing
their last game on the hardwood
for Stanford next Saturday night.
Captain Harlow Rothert and Harry
(Rod) Herg will have completed
their third year of collegiate hoop
play when the final whistle blows.
Rothert had the distinction of cap
taining the Card cagers when a
junior, and was reelected to the
post at the end of last season. Herg
captained the l!Ki7 freshman quin
tet, and served three years at for
ward on Stanford varsity teams.
