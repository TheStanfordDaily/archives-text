# COMMON CONSENT TRADITIONS

### 
Tli? DAILY lias loudly moaned, in limes past, at tendencies I
toward "collegiatism" on this campus, hut now il raises its edito- i
rial voice in paeans ol thanksgiving--a comparison with other I
institutions proves that the level of Stanford's maturity is rather
high.
I'or instance, there is a school down at the other end of the
Ridge Route which goes hv the name of I'.S.C. The people who \
go to that school call themselves I rojans. Thev have an organiza ,
tion called the I rojan S(|iiires. The Squires are very htisy men. i
I hey must see that I rojan spirit is nurtured; they must see that j
I rojan traditions are instilled in every I rojan Frosh.
'I he I rojan Squires put their heads together recently and pre
pared a set of len ( oinmandments for the freshmen. These man- i
dates regulate every phase of first year campus life with the excep '
tion of hath habits. Many of the '"don'ts* are reminiscent of Stan |
ford prohibitions when the harm was younger.
Hut the Farm, fortunately, has outgrown that stage. Freshmen ,
are human beings here. I hey may talk to co-eds whenever and
wherever they please. They need not wear monkey caps, unless
they have personal aboriginal tendencies. For these things Sons of !
the Stanford Red should be thankful.
Stanford has traditions, it is true. Freshmen don't wear cords.
Students in general don't smoke on the Ouad.
Hut these traditions (or artificialities, if you will") are not en- i
forced at the end of ;i paddle. They exist by common consent. And
ihe traditions which exist by common consent are the only ones '
worth having.
