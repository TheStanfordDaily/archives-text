# THE 						DECREASING WATER SUPPLY
## 
### 
While the residents of the campus go calmly on washing their
faces and hands with soap and water, there is an earnest group of
students seeking to determine the water resources of lliis locality.
I>y means of scientific instruments these searchers will attempt
to measure the rise and fall of the water table to determine if Palo
\lto and the Stanford campus are really facing a serious water
hortage.
At present the two water systems on the campus are furnishing
:ni adequate supply. I loth the Searsville system, which is used for
watering and fire-protection purposes, and the Masoleum well, for
drinking and cooking uses, are reported to be flowing enough to
afford an abundant supply. However, both these sources have been
teadily decreasing in production.
According to Professor ( . I*. Tolman, of the Stanford Geology
department, artesian wells that formerly flowed freely are now giv
ing up water at the 50-foot level. I his indicates that within the
past 15 years the water table has dropped more than 50 feet—a
serious situation in any community.
In order that a water shortage might be avoided in the future, 1
it might be well for local authorities to conduct an independent
urvey of conditions or co operate with Santa Clara county officials
in determining the capacity of the waterbearing gravels of the i
Santa ( lara valley.
