"ll is my opinion that the down
fall of the Tardieu cabinet in tlie
■ French government is a result, of
! domestic politics, rather than a
| sudden opposition of the chamber
j to the policies regarding the Lon
i don naval parley, which seems to
| have been unusually successful
| from the standpoint of France,"
! said Professor Ralph J-l. Lutz of
I the history department in an in
terview with the Daily, yesterday.
"However, the expected news of
(the negotiations for the formation
| of the new cabinet will probably
; reveal tlie real cause of Tardieu's
fall," lie believes. "Foreign policy
i as far as limitation of naval arma
! ments is concerned has at least
j been consistent from the French
j point of view since the armistice,
j so there is no reason to expect a
| radical change in this policy."
Professor Lutz was surprised
' when he learned of the overthrow
of the cabinet on account of do
mestic controversies at this time,
| when all the world has been inter
| ested in her foreign policy concern
ing the London naval arms confer
ence.
