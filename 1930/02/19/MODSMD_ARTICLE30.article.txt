SIGNIFICANT CONTEMPORARY
STORIES. By Edith Mirrielees.
New York: Doubleday, Doian
& Co. Inc. 1929. $1.75. At the
Stanford Bookstore.
Those interested in the various
types of the short story which pre
vail in the present day should read
litis very interesting volume. In ii
are represented stories of many
different types, such as the slream
of-consciousness story, the surprise
ending story, and the character
sketch. Miss Mirrielees remarks in
llie preface of her unique anthol
ogy, "The stories have been in
cluded for one reason only be
cause, once read, I hey refuse to
depart from mind." Her (tolled lon
includes tales and stories by such
eminent writers as Lord Dunsany,
Berber! (leorge Wells, Virginia
Woolf, Joseph Conrad, and Harvey
O'l liggins.

Aside from the value of the book
ms one giving the reader ail idea
of what is being done in contem
porary fiction, it affords a great
deal of pleasure in the diversity
and the contrast of (lie stories
contained therein. The dream-like
quality of Lord Punsany's tale,
"The Sword and the Idol," and
Joseph Conrad's "The Secret
Sharer," contrasted with the more
adventurous stories, "The Fourth
iViitn" by John Russell and"The
Mob Prom Massac" by Irvin Cobb,
and (host* still further in contrast
with the Wells story, "The Man
Who Could Work Miracles" and
lamest Hemingway's "The Killers"
(an excellent piece of short story
technique), make the anthology a
very pleasant one io read, to think
over, and to enjoy a long time
after it has been read.
