## AN OPINION ON "MATERIAL" 
### 
To the Editor, Sir:
Coach Husky Hunt's Btatement
that the disgraceful basketball rec
ord set by Stanford quintets sinee
tbe start of his regime is directly
traceable to "poor material" is not
only a very weak defense mechan
ism on his part, but, entirely un
fair to the boys who night, after
night gave of their time and ener
gies to contribute to the upbuilding
of a team that, might adequately
represent Stanford on the court. It
is not only unfair, but silly.
As I look over the roster of play
ers, Illy eyes run.across the names
of men who in their prep days
were considered the class of the
entire slate. If today, they are to
be dubbed as "poor material" it
may be th;il the Hunt system (if it
may be culled such) has degener
ated their basket hall talent instead
of improving it. Without mention

1 ing any names, Mr. Hunt lnis not
only better material than GuMfor
nia, hut better potential material
than most schools on the Coast.
And I'd he willing to het my last
dime, that were Mr, Hunt given
his choice of the ten or fifteen
"best" men in the conference, his
results would he just as poor. The
point is, Mr. Editor, that no matter
iiow perfect your material is, it'
they are uninspired, if they do not
learn a system that is fundament
ally sound try as they will —their
inevitable destination is the cellar.
Therefore, I can accept his ex
cuse in only one of two lights:
either he doesn't know what he's
i talking about when lie dubs his
material as "poor"; or his material,
if he's correct in saying it's poor,
has become poor only because it
has rusted and wilted under tin 1
pressure of inadequate coaching,
