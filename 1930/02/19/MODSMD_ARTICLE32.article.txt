# ON THE BULGARIAN DRIVE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford Student Body has
been called upon to give material
aid to the students in tbe colleges
and universities of Bulgaria
through the International Student
Service. This is an appeal not. to
Stanford alone, but to students of
America, and to students in all
other nations of the world where a
comparative degree of prosperity
exists. In a word, it is a demonstra
tion of the development of an in
ternational student friendliness
which transcends national and
continental lines.
There is no place in this situa
tion for sent.iniontalism. Careful
survey and study by the Secre
tariat in (leneva have proved be
yond question that Bulgarian Stu
dents are in need of help. A mil
lion dollars might be raised to get
food for these GOOO students, and
after that, was consumed this same
6000 would soon be hungry again.
What this project will do is not to
feed these students but to help
them build a Student House which
will care for 2000 of their number.
This house will feed the students
at wholesale prices, it will give
them work so that Oiey may b">-

i come self-supporting, H will give
them study rooms and libraries,
student workshops and living quar
t ers.
One question that is often and
j fairly asked is, "If Bulgarian stu
dents find the going so hard why
don't they stop school and get to
work?" If the students stopped
their university training, it. would
! he practically impossible for them
to find work. The economic condi
tion of the country is serious. The
land is rich but the agricultural
methods employed are out of date,
and there is, in general, an urgent
need for professional men and
j women such as engineers, agrieul
-1 Itirists, and doctors. The youth of
Bulgaria is determined to meet
that want and is flockitfg to the
i universities.
Bulgaria may indeed seem far
away from us, and we may justly
question the validity of helping
grant this request for $500, but
before we pass judgment in entire
ly let us give our thoughtful con
sideration to this request that has
1 come to us from the Government,
the university students, and the
professional classes, and students
of Bulgaria.
Sincerely yours, Betty Alden.

The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford Student Body has
been called upon to give material
aid to the students in tbe colleges
and universities of Bulgaria
through the International Student
Service. This is an appeal not. to
Stanford alone, but to students of
America, and to students in all
other nations of the world where a
comparative degree of prosperity
exists. In a word, it is a demonstra
tion of the development of an in
ternational student friendliness
which transcends national and
continental lines.
There is no place in this situa
tion for sent.iniontalism. Careful
survey and study by the Secre
tariat in (leneva have proved be
yond question that Bulgarian Stu
dents are in need of help. A mil
lion dollars might be raised to get
food for these GOOO students, and
after that, was consumed this same
6000 would soon be hungry again.
What this project will do is not to
feed these students but to help
them build a Student House which
will care for 2000 of their number.
This house will feed the students
at wholesale prices, it will give
them work so that Oiey may b">-

i come self-supporting, H will give
them study rooms and libraries,
student workshops and living quar
t ers.
One question that is often and
j fairly asked is, "If Bulgarian stu
dents find the going so hard why
don't they stop school and get to
work?" If the students stopped
their university training, it. would
! he practically impossible for them
to find work. The economic condi
tion of the country is serious. The
land is rich but the agricultural
methods employed are out of date,
and there is, in general, an urgent
need for professional men and
j women such as engineers, agrieul
-1 Itirists, and doctors. The youth of
Bulgaria is determined to meet
that want and is flockitfg to the
i universities.
Bulgaria may indeed seem far
away from us, and we may justly
question the validity of helping
grant this request for $500, but
before we pass judgment in entire
ly let us give our thoughtful con
sideration to this request that has
