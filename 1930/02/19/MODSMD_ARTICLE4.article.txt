j "Today China, with her age-old civ
! ilization, her background of years of
j history and art, i-* standing at the
I crossroads, is facing another crisis,
j and i-. looking to America for help,"
j Herbert White, photographer and lec
j turcr of Chinese art and culture, so
characterized China's present situation
j in his talk last night in the Assembly
I Hall on "Chinese Architecture."
"To help China is to understand her
j civilization better, to respect her age
I and culture, to love the things she
j lÂ«>ve>," he continued. "By studying the
are of China, by admiring her master
| pieces, and her standards of beauty,
i Americans can come to a fuller un
j derstanding of China herself."
White showed colored pictures of
I Chinese temples, mountains, and what
I lie declared the most romantic of her
j cities, Pckin.
"To see China at her best, one
! should visit Pekin. To live there is to
! love her, a t*;icc 1u 1 city, dignified,
I the most calm of all cities ot the
world, liven in its decadence, Pekin
retains much of its early splendor,"
White said.
Ihe pictures, delicately tinted,
showed many of the show places of
Pekin. The summer palace of the
lunpress Dowager, its bronze incense
burners, shining yellow porcelain roofs
ol carved marble tea houses, its pago
das, and emerald lakes, spanned by
multi-shaped bridges, were enhanced
by the clear colored screens.
