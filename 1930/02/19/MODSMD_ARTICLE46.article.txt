# A 						PAR-SHUTING FOOL . . . .
## Densmore Shute, Who Has Won the Los Angeles and Texas Open Golf Titles Since January I 
### Feg Murray, 16 
Lima, Ohio, is proud of Denny
Slinte. The city; tluit produced Bob
King, Olympic high jump cham
pion, also produced the newest
sensation in the rjinks of profes
sional golfers. Ohio has a knack of
turning oul Presidents —and ath
letes. Ballplayers like Root, Uhlo,
Gerber, English, Tavener, Benton,
Haines, and Sam Jones were all
born in Ohio. And plenty of foot
ball stars and track athletes, too.
But to return to Denny Shute, the
slender young pro who has copped
two big prizes since the start of
3!).'!(), and far oul scored all the best
professionals in the land with the
exception of Gene Sarazen and
Morton Smith —and he beat Smith
twice!
Shute was a good amateur player
for several years (he competed in
192.'! at Floosmoor) and as early
as that time, when Shute was
eighteen, certain pros had picked
him out as a comer. And he is now

| coming through with a bang, out
scoring those' same pros, and many
| others, and walking off with the
big checks, while they get the lit
tle ones, or none at all.
Deltsmore Shute was sixth in the
1!>28 U.S. open with a score of 29J).
At Winged Foot last summer he
tied with Sarazen for third place,
two strokes behind Jones and Es-
Ttinosa! He beat 74 on each of his
first two rounds, but couldn't equal
j that figure on his last 3 8 holes,
| when another such round would
have put him in the play-off!
This hollow-cheeked lad from
Lima first galloped around in the
rain to win the fifth annual Los
Angeles $10,000 open, then on Feb
ruary at San Antonio, he led the
' field by three strokes to win the
1 Texas Open, shattering par by
seven strokes! Shute's rounds
were (58, F>9, f>9, 71 over the tricky
j par-71 layout. He may be another
1 Morton Smith, you never can tell!
