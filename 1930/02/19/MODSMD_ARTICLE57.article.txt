## 
### 
Krenz ;iiml Rothert staged a little
cxhiliiti<>ll in tin- shot IJUt night before
last with the result that the 51-foot
line was dusted off a couple of times.
Kothert's best put was about 50 ft. 7
inches, while Krenz tossed one out on
the 51-foot line. Kothert's first at
tempt of the season in the discus
landed on the 140-foot line. Krenz
was throwing to demonstrate the
proper form to the rest of the men,
and did it so well that one of his
tosses went 161 feet.
News from the south indicates that
1..A.A.C. will put a strong' team in the
field against the Cards oil March lirst,
headed by Herman lirix, former I Di
versity of Washington football star.
I»ri.\ set the American record in the
shot last year at 51 feet 11 3-4 inches,
and Saturday he tossed the ball 50 feet
7 inches against Occidental College.
< irahani vaulted 13 feet 4 inches, and
two men made (> feet 1 inches in the
high jump against the Tigers.
Half-Mile Strong
I'ercy Niersbach ran the 880 in
2:02 1-5 for the clubmen, and he is
said lo he just starting training. He
was a good two-la]) man when he was
competing for the Trojans, and is ex
pected to take the Cards into camp.
With Pomteroy, Grumbles, and Max
well in the hurdles, the Mercury run -
Uers figure to clean up most of the
points in those events, though Podge
Smith should win both races.
DcMets of the clubmen tossed the
javelin 197 feet, and his teammate,
Katon, threw 194 feet for second. The
Cards will have to exceed their best
of the season to place in the spear
tossing.
I lob ISroun will have plenty of
work in the two-mile with Henry
Chaca in the running. Chaea is really
a better five-mile man than a two
milcr, but he is a classy runner. Tcm
pletoii told I'.rown to run a 10:40 race
last night, but Brown surprised him
self by running the distance in 10:17.
He should get under 10 minutes by the
lirst of March.

He should get under 10 minutes by the
lirst of March.
Krenz ;iiml Rothert staged a little
cxhiliiti<>ll in tin- shot IJUt night before
last with the result that the 51-foot
line was dusted off a couple of times.
Kothert's best put was about 50 ft. 7
inches, while Krenz tossed one out on
the 51-foot line. Kothert's first at
tempt of the season in the discus
landed on the 140-foot line. Krenz
was throwing to demonstrate the
proper form to the rest of the men,
and did it so well that one of his
tosses went 161 feet.
News from the south indicates that
1..A.A.C. will put a strong' team in the
field against the Cards oil March lirst,
headed by Herman lirix, former I Di
versity of Washington football star.
I»ri.\ set the American record in the
shot last year at 51 feet 11 3-4 inches,
and Saturday he tossed the ball 50 feet
7 inches against Occidental College.
< irahani vaulted 13 feet 4 inches, and
two men made (> feet 1 inches in the
high jump against the Tigers.
Half-Mile Strong
I'ercy Niersbach ran the 880 in
2:02 1-5 for the clubmen, and he is
said lo he just starting training. He
was a good two-la]) man when he was
competing for the Trojans, and is ex
pected to take the Cards into camp.
With Pomteroy, Grumbles, and Max
well in the hurdles, the Mercury run -
Uers figure to clean up most of the
points in those events, though Podge
Smith should win both races.
DcMets of the clubmen tossed the
javelin 197 feet, and his teammate,
Katon, threw 194 feet for second. The
Cards will have to exceed their best
of the season to place in the spear
tossing.
I lob ISroun will have plenty of
work in the two-mile with Henry
Chaca in the running. Chaea is really
a better five-mile man than a two
milcr, but he is a classy runner. Tcm
pletoii told I'.rown to run a 10:40 race
last night, but Brown surprised him
self by running the distance in 10:17.
He should get under 10 minutes by the
lirst of March.
