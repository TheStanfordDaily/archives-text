tion tit strict fundamental influ
ences," David R. Porter, national
secretary of the student division
of the Y.M.C.A., remarked last eve
ning when lie addressed members
of the Stanford Christian Associa
tions at dinner in the Union. "Jt. is
necessary to think your way

Chicago, Illinois, Georgia Tech,
Princeton, and Oxford, lie returns
from attending an international
conference of student organizations
last year in Egypt, at which were

similar to that now being carried
