# FALSE LIGHTHOUSES PLACED BY FEUDAL LORDS TO WRECK SHIPS

### BY CATHERINE SPAULDING 
Storms * i r mi Mm: won; not de
structive enough for (lie undent
lords, so they created their own
shipwrecks hy placing false lights
to lead unsuspecting sailors astray,
entitling them, by right of wreck,
to the salvaged goods. This was a
common practice along rocky
coasts from I lie middle ages to the
nineteenth century, according to
Professor Carl F\ Brand.
Luncly, a rocky island off the
coast of England, is used by ('le
nience Dane as a setting for the
play "Granite" and this old barbar
ous practice is one of the high
lights in the plot of the play.
In the days of feudal ages, the
shipwrecked man was looked upon
as forsaken by God and man, and
his fate, when taken, was imprison
ment and often torture while the
lord of ,the land endeavored to se
cure a ransom for him. I lis goods
were also considered as part of the

I spoil, iind in Anglo-Saxon times
this was used as one of the ordi- j
nary sources of royal revenue.
It is snid that a lord of Brittany,
indicating a rock famous for the
number of shipwrecks it had
caused, once declared "I have a
.'tone here which is more valuable
than the crown diamonds."
The most famous example in his- J
â€¢ory of the use of the right of j
wreck, is that of the Saxon Karl
Harold, who was shipwrecked I
about 1064 on the coast of Pon
thieu, and accordingly fell into the '
hands of Count Guy, a vassal of
Duke William of Normandy. The I
Duke, of course, compelled Count
Guy to give up Harold.
In "Granite" il is even Intimated i
that the shipwrecked men are
pushed back into the sea to drown
since dead men tell no tales. The
tragedy is to be produced on the
campus February 28,
