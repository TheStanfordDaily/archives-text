Will Rogers, cowboy sage with a
wisecracking bent, at bis home

ions on personalities and events as
follows:
"Calvin Coolidge is a (jnint hu
morist, whose stulT goes over most,
folks' beads.
"Bernard Shaw is the greatest.
Englishman.
"The best speech I heard in Eng
land was by Lloyd George in I he
House of Commons.
"Lady Astor is the champion wo
man and that goes for the world.
"Tlie British King speaks the
most perfect English in bis coun
try almost good enough to be an
American.
"Reapportionment would be i
better word. It looks to me more

like a building conference than a |
sinking conference. For most coun
tries if is going to mean a lot of '
building to justify the parity t hey j
are demanding.
"The conference certainly will do i
as much good as any of the dele- j
gates hoped for, but probably not i
as much as peace-loving folks ex- I
pected. The trouble is folks don't i
know the conditions away from
home and expect, too much. If we
had France where Mexico is and
Germany whore Canada is, we j
might like to sleep with a lot big-1
ger gun tinder our head, I
"The delegates at the conference ;
all must make a good showing.
They're all appointed by somebody
who has been elected, and none
can appear to get the worst of it
in so now France is the cocky
nation at the conference."
