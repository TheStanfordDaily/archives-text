LENINGRAD, U.S.S.R., Feb. 18.
(A J ) —"Curse us as much as you
please; we will never turn from
the path shown us by Lenin," says
a fiery manifesto issued by the
Union of Militant Atheists today
dealing with the recent papal de
nunciation of the Soviets for their
attitude regarding religion.
"There will come a time when
the atheist workers of the entire
world will convert the Vatican into
a museum," says the manifesto.
"The mummy Roman Pope will be
interred with the mummy Siberian
medicine man as a monument to
th«' thousand years old deligious
delusion and deceit."
