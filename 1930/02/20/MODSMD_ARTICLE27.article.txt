# MURDERESS IN ARIZONA GIVEN DEATH PENALTY
## Laws in Arizona Preclude Possibility of Reprieve Or Commuting Sentence Jury of Twelve Men Finds Eva Dugan Sane After Trial of Seven Weeks 
### 
FLORENCE, Ariz., Feb. 1!Â». (/p)
Mrs. Eva Dugan, first woman in the
history of Arizona to be sentenced
to death, failed today in her final
attempt to escape the gallows.
A jury of twelve men found her
sane and deprived her of the only
alternative to death -life imprison
ment in an asylum.
She will be hanged at the An
zona State Prison here at sunrise.
Friday morning for the murder in
1927 of A. J. Mathis, her employer.
Previous to her attempt, which
ended today, to establish herself
as insane, the Arizona State Board
of Paroles and Pardons had de
dined to commute the death sen
tence to life imprisonment. Cover
nor John C. Phillips, under Arizona
law, is not empowered to grant,
either a reprieve or a commuta
tion.
Taken From Cell
When the sanity hearing opened
! yesterday, Mrs. Dugan was taken
from the death cell, which she al
ready had occupied for six days, to
the superior court, room here. She
; smiled grimly as she. heard physi
j clans and other witnesses testify
I to the belief that, she is insane.
| Today, however, when the State
produced witnesses in its attempt
to refute the defense contention,
she became extremely nervous, anh
when the case was submitted t<i
the jury, she asked to he taken
back to her cell.
Before the verdict was brought
in, she had regained her composure
and was returned to the court
room to hear her death sentence
I affirmed for the last time. Sin
! shifted slightly in her chair as the
verdict was read to her, but other
wise displayed no outward sign of
emotion.
