# PROBLEMS IN SPIRIT AND SPORTSMANSHIP
## 
### 
Stan lord s basketball s<|iiad is apparently oblivious to tin* storm
tliat is raging about the person oi its coach. Sport writers declare
llial I uesday evenings practice was the most spirited workout of
the season. ,
It is to be hoped that ( ardinal rooters will follow the lead of the
players when Stanford winds up its 1930 basketball s( ■ason against
< alifornia Saturday evening. Petitions may be signed, campus
opinion letters may be written, and hot words may be uttered by
both factions, but one thing stands out as more important than anv
controversial side issue—Stanford has a basketball team, and that
team is scheduled to play its greatest rival.
Stanford spirit, if it amounts to anything at all. should be a
big enough thing to cause a student body to forget for an evening
any campus row. Student rooters, no matter what their personal
convictions may be, owe to the team and to its coach the fullest
support in this final game.
There is no championship at stake, not even a series. Hut there
is an ancient score to settle. Stanford should not stint in its effort
to break the winning streak of the C'lolden Hear.
And this game Saturday night brings up another issue. It is
the issue of Stanford sportsmanship.
Stanford rooters have reverted to type on several occasions re
cently—but they have reverted to a type which inhabitants of the
Farm fondly believed did not exist here.
Student support and Stanford spirit are necessary things. Hut
they must be expressed in something other than the high school
mode of the immediate past. That game Saturday night will not be
worth winning, it the victorv is to be spoiled bv booings and cat
calls.
Stanford rooters can prove two things to an observant public
Saturday. They can prove that Cardinal spirit is bigger than local
controversy, and they can prove that Stanford sportsmanship exists
in fact as well as in legend.
