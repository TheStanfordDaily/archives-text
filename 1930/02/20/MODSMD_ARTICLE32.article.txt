# PRESIDENTIAL OPTIMISM
## 
### 
President I loover is an exceedingly optimistic man.
I he other day he invited several congressional chieftans to I
breakfast, and asked that action on a tariff hill he accelerated. Ap
parently he expects t ongress to take his request seriouslv.
('resident Hoover should know by this time that Congress will
speed up the tariff measure when it sees lit to do so, and not until
then. It will act only after il has finished such important problems |
as expending political licit air on Charles ICvans Hughes and prohi
bition enforcement for the benefit of folks back home.
I'resident Hoover should have learned by this time that being j
chief executive of the I nited States is a pretty small job. Any of ,
llie senators or representatives could do il better than Ihe president
- ask them if you don't believe it.
So why should they regard seriously any request coming from 1
1 lie While House? If the Senate and the House were to be the
recipients of a celestial command, members of those two exalted |
bodies would receive it as a signal for exerting independence.
The president's request was received in the characteristic manner.
Representative Carner. Texas Democrat, saw an opportunity for)
1 bunder against I loover leadership. And seized the opportunity.
President Hoover is not perfect.
lint even granting that lie is exceedingly imperfect, it is safe to
conclude that he is right and Congress is wrong. If President 1
I loover had the intellect of a fourteen-year-old boy, he would be j
right more often than the pompous fuss-buttons who are expected J
1o make the laws of this countrv.
