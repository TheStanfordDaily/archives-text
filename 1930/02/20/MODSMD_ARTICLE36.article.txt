THERE IS ANOTHER HEAVEN.;
By Robert Nathan. Indianapo
lis: Bobbs-Merrill. 1929.
Thin book furnishes food for
thought, especially to those inter
esled in non-inatl.er-of-fnct heavens. 1
Almost worthy of poetry is this |
book. One learns of the heaven of;
the missionary and the sinless,
child where all understand one tin
other. But . . . "There Is Another;
Heaven" assurlngly states the
bead of each page. And we com
mence to understand: in this city
is no pain, to he sure, but there is
no hope. We all secretly agree with
the righteous minister, Mr. Crisp:
"If a reward for right-doing were
really to be a reward, oughtn't it,
perhaps, be something more than
an endless opportunity for that self
same right-doing?"
Professor Wulheridge, William
Meiggs, and Mr. Lewis, born Levy,
are on the bank of the River Jor
dan, about to enter Heaven. Each
wonders what will be his reception
in the city across, the water. Sam
uel Lewis, horn Levy, is worried.
He had renounced the religion of
his fathers and had been baptized
that he might have the benefit of
a friendly God. II' 1 feared he
wouldn't feel welcome in ibis city
he had striven so hard to gain.
Thoroughly realizing that none of
his family would be. there to greet
him he was greatly perturbed . . .
But the boat had come to take
them across the Jordan.
Several days later the three were
swimming back through the icy
water —though milk and honey
flowed in that City of the Saved,

where there was only peace and
joy.
There is another heaven for
llieiii who did know that they are

SONG OF LOVE—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
David Durand, not Belle Raker,
is the star in this picture. The
small, black-eyed, curly-haired hoy
lakes all the honors, hoth for act
ing and for singing. Rven the ex
ceptionally stupid lines put into his
mouth to lit the endless banalities
of the plot are forgiven hie.
Belle Hiiker and Ralph Graves
do not fare so well. Graves has one
Inebriated scene, in which he ap
pears marvelously at home, and
Belle Baker does two very clever
impersonations —the only scene in
the show in which she does her
talent justice.
But. the plot, in which every in
cident —happy family trio, unscru
pulous blonde siren, unfaithful hus
band, broken-hearted wife, and
final touching all-is-forgiven-re*
union—can be foreseen at a dis
tance, is too large :i handicap for
the cast.
The song tunes themselves are
lovely, but Belle Baker puts exag
gerated pathos into them. In the
"blues" numbers you are given a
far too realistic version of what
Al Jolson would have done if he
had been born a woman. However
there is no getting around the fact
that Miss Baker has an excellent
voice. —M. L. R.
