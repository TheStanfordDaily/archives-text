## THIS KETTLE BOILS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
It's taken a long time for lli.is
kettle to boil over, hut here she
comes.
For four years we have all
looked, usually the other way, at
violations of the much-bombarded
Honor System. For four years we
have listened to perspiring Itally
Committeemen while they goade I
freshmen on to bigger and better
bonfires. For four years we have
heard the mournful pleas of editors
and managers, of house presidents '
and sponsors —Turn out for this!
ui) for that!
And topping them all, we have
winced when outsiders mentioned!
the display of Stanford rooting sec- :
l ions.
Mr. Editor, you and i are seniors
now —lofty, and bothering not too
much about the antics of our
younger compatriots. But I ■ think
that even we get more than slight
ly disgusted when such an exhibi
tion as that occurring during the {
basketball game Saturday is
thrown in our respective faces.
We've grinned shamefacedly
when our own black sheep panned
the coach. We've griped inwardly
when they roasted th< j players. But
when they insist, time after time,
on booing and hissing not only at :
the referees but at I California

rooters —tbut's a bit. too foul to be
stomached.
Back in the good old days, we
used to boast, to the folks back
home about the particular Stanford
sportsmanship — the kind that
meant doing even more than our
share for the good name of the
University. Saturday night, my
folks sat with me at the game,
looking most surprised when the
California yells were greeted with
rapturous hisses from the Cardinal
rooters.
Unfortunately, it was hardly a
suprise to me —it. has reached the
state where nothing in the line of
bad manners is surprising—when
it comes from our own rooters.
It isn't difficult to blame the ter
rible turnouts at all University af
fairs but jolly-ups on the modern
version of good sportsmanship. And
these blemishes on the fair name
of the Honor System are due mere
ly to warped sense of fair play.
Perhaps, Mr. Editor, we're getting
slightly warped ourselves. Perhaps
the phrase of our younger days —
"play square," has been replaced
by the newer version—"nobody
cares or gives a damn."
If that be so. let us extend pity
to those poor souls who don't know
what they've missed.
—Scoop '30.
