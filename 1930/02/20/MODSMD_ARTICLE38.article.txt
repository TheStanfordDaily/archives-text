# THE
						RELIGION OF HUMANISM

The Editor, Sir:
In view of the recent request for
various outlines of Hie trend of
modernity in religion, the follow
ing summarization of a personal
belief may he of interest.
First, twentieth century religion
stresses the personal religion:*
choice of the individual. Authority
is recognized as highly open to
doubt, if not wholly erroneous.
This personal choice of the indi
vidual is mainly directed toward
liberalism in the various creeds;
extremes of belief are 110 longer
popular, and a combination of tra
dition and fairly elastic form and
ceremony is to be upheld.
Generally speaking, the modern
churchman steers clear of creating
an impression of religious parti
sanship. "Live and let live" reflects
the common principle of a tolera
tion bordering upon indifference
for the convictions of his fellows.
The day of the outspoken (usually
unthinking) champion of a creed
is fortunately passing. The modern
adherent to any creed is interested
in gaining a maximum of spiritual
comfort in the most reasonable,
certain manner. The efficiency of
present-day business methods has

: doubtless influenced methods of re
ligious teaching, as well as in such
fields as bigger and better collec
tions. A modern believer refuses to
accept t.lie burden of vituperating
fellow-beings of another sect. In
lieu of spiritual solace, he rightly
condemns the role of the agitator
and the bigot.
Modern religion is no longer the
. primary custodian of art and at
tendant beauty. The richest cul
ture of music, literature, sculpture,
- and painting can now compete on
•an equal footing with religion for
! die devotion and love of the think
ing man. Social opprobrium no
| longer attaches to the man of free
| will who avoids orthodox religion,
! and strives to find a balm in life
j in the stimulus of his own intel
! lect. Is it. to be wondered at that.
; in the degree to which this same
man turns to religion, he demands
J purity of worship unadulterated by
i petty prejudices? The present-day
I man must find culture, reason, and
! moderation in religion, or he will
| discard hide-bound religion and
seek elsewhere. Perhaps Humanism
i has become the genuine devotion
j of the modern man.
