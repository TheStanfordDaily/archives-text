# IN DEFENSE OF THE HONOR CODE
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Referring to a letter printed yes
terday bearing the signature " '33,"
may I suggest that in spite of any
average-raising which naturally re
sults from the "cribbing" referred
to, a little more study and a little,
closer attention to bis own paper
during an "ex" might possibly as
sist him in securing the high or
even passing grades which seem
f,o distant at the present time.
The tone of his letter almost
suggests that the majority of good
grades last quarter were obtained
unfairly. While 1 do not deny the
possible existence of infractions of
the honor code, I have never yet
had tlie opportunity or the time to
observe them during an "ex." and

, while I am acquainted with some
of the so-called "average-raisers,"
their characters are such lhat
cheating would he quite impossibl <
l'or them.
It is my opinion, therefore, that
the highest grades do not go to the
unprincipled students, and I will
never forget the thrill I felt when
I fully realized the meaning of the
honor system after the Prof's exit
at the beginning of my first exam
ination.
Why deny this feeling to future
classes by instituting a proctor sys
tem? I dislike the idea of report
ing cheaters, but could not some
I system of temporary ostracism be
instituted among the students
I themselves? â€”Another Frosh.
