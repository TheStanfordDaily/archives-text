# A 						FAMILY AFFAIR
## Brilliant Tennis Career Is Predicted for Remarkable Young Sisters, Mianne and Sarah Palfrey 
### Feg Murray, '16 
What, are you going to do about
those Palfrey girls! Here they are,
i the oldest only eighteen years old,
| and they already have a strangle
hold on the indoor tennis title's of
j the United States, and there are
j all the reasons in the world why
j one or the other of them should
isucceed to the throne now oecu
pied by Helen Wills! Tennis critics
are already predicting a brighter
career for Mianne and Sarah Pal
frey than that of the famous Sut
! ton sisters, May and Violet, who
did so much in the realms of
women's tennis.
Mianne Palfrey, playing in her
I first women's national indoor sin
-1 gles championship, defeated half
the seeded players, including Mrs.
I Marion Zinderstein Jessup in the
finals, and won the title in so
astonishing a manner that she left
the crowd, the experts, and her op
ponent gasping for breath like, fis 11
I out of water. Mrs. Jessup, an ex
perienced and ranking player, "led
the youngster five games to none
in the first set. Then Mianne, the

I eighteen-year-old hid, became n
, ' combination typhoon and whirl
, ; wind and raced through eleven
- • straight games without losing one!
112 1 She t hen "won 7-5, t!-2, in one of the
• most astounding comebacks in ten
• nis history.
I But what about Sarah, Mianne's
- ' younger sister, who had been one
? ; of the sensations of the women's
• | outdoor championships at Forest
- J Hills last summer, defeating Mrs.
- Shepherd-Barron, of the English
) Wigbtman Cup team, among
112 ■ others? Previous to that tourna
ment she had won tht l Eastern
' ; women's singles title at Rye. Well,
- | little Sarah won her third succes-
I! ' sive doubles title, paired with Mrs.
. i Wigbtman, who, it may be said
■ here, has given no end of time
) and energy in developing the Pal
t sisters' tennis.
-! Sarah and Mianne held a mono
i i poly on the girls' indoor and out
- j door titles for several years. Now
! ; they are, apparently, going to have
>j a monopoly on more grownup
1 j honors.
