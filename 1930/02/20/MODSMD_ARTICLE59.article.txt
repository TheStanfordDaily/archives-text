## 
### 
With the California game sched
uled for Saturday night at <!:4r,
preliminary to tlie varsity contest,
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw is putting
his freshman hoop artists through
some stiff workouts in preparation
for tlie tilt, which will decide the
U.C.-Stanford series.
When the two teams trot onto
the Pavilion hardwood with one
victory each to their credit, the
fans are destined to witness a
hard-fought ball game. Bradshaw
believes that the two outfits are

perhaps more evenly matched than
ever before and that the deciding
factor will be fitflit. Physically, nei
ther quintet lias the advantage,
since the Bear Cubs have a pair
of bigger men in ihe forward ter
ritory, with a center slightly taller
than Edelen", Card pivot man, while
the Stanford yearlings hold a
slight edge in (lie guard positions.
Hancock and Tway will start at
guard for the farm babes, with
Edelen at center, Palmer playing
one forward, and either Cordry or
Meade at the other.
