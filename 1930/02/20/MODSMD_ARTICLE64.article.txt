# ELLINGTON MAKES LAST SHIFTS PRIOR TO YEARLING MEET
## 
### 
After running off a couple of
elimination heats among his sprint- 1
ers yesterday afternoon, Bill El
lington, freshman track coach, lias
practically decided on t lie squad
that will face the Menlo and Mo
desto junior college track teams I
on the Old Oval track Saturday
morning in the first meet of the
season. His present choice of men
and the events they are to compete
in has involved certain shifts dur- '
ing the past week.
Because of a decided weakness :
in I lie mile, Ellington was forced (
to break up his strong trio of half
milers and shift Boh Hunter to the
longer race. Hunter ran three-quar
ters of a mile in practice the other ,
afternoon in H:2o which indicates J
lie should step the full four laps 1
in better than 4:50.
Nick Pierose lias been ruled in
eligible for track competition this !
spring because he competed on the 1
Southern All-Stars, a collection of
prep athletes, last year. His loss
left the javelin without a man and j
the pole vault with but one vaulter
its Lloyd Austin is also ineligible 1
this quarter due to his scholastic
standing, but another spear-tosser !
was found in the person of Bill
Bates, frosli football player.
Without any previous training in
the event, Bates threw the spear
150 feet in his second afternoon of
practice. With but one week of
practice lie can hardly be counted
on for many points, but Ellington
expects him to develop into a good
javelin-thrower before the season
is over.
Jack Hohverda is the latest ad
dition to the weight-throwing con
tingent.. He had never thrown a
shot until he reported for track
last week, but he is powerfully
built and when he develops co
ordination should toss the 16-pound
ball 45 feet, according to Ellington.
He hits the 38-foot mark with a
standing put now.
