j "In no field of society is the slow
progress of our changing social
order more evident than in the field
of medicine," said Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur in his article "Facts to Face
in the Future" which appeared in
|a recent issue of the Survey
! Graphic Magazine.
"Not until such pressing prob
lems as the distressing illness of
our relatives and friends do we be
come acutely conscious of the great
i disparities that exist at the pres
ent time in the distribution of
proper medical care to the various
elements in our population."
Few people, according to Dr. Wil
j bur, realize the number of ele
ments there are in making up the
total bill for medical service and
too long have physicians been
yoked to the historical system of
\ giving charitable care to the in
digent sick.
i"The Committee on the Cost of
Medical ('are organized in 1927,
after two years of conference with
physicians, sanitarians, and econo
mists, is faced with the solution of
I the problem which puzzles the
medical professionâ€”the rapid
change going on in American life,"
Wilbur states.
"It is too early for us to know
what the results of the survey will
be," lie concluded. "All we can say
is that we are on our way and that
' we are trying to meet the facts
squarely and to work toward a
typically American solution of the
j problem.
