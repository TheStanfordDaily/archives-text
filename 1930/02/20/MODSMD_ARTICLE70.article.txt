# CARDSPREPARE FOR LAST U.C. GAME BY SPEEDY SCRIMMAGE
## 
### 
In a last desperate attempt to
j salvage what remains of a some
j what disastrous season by whip
j ping California here Saturday
! night, Stanford's varsity cagers
j yesterday went through a brisk
j workout marked by ;l vicious scrim
i mage between the first and second
I strings.
Ail the Cards also took a whirl
i at the basket from the foul line,
from which spot tlie Redshirts
have been woefully weak all year.
At least three defeats may be
charged directly to the Cardinals'
inability to convert the gift shots,
and Husky Hunt is overlooking no
bets for Saturday's game.
Line-Up Not Certain
Just what the Stanford line-up
will be is still problematical, al
though indications were that Tyler
and Berg would start at the for
] ward posts, supported by Captain
Rothert and Mike Reynolds at
guards, with the possibility that
Bud Hawk Vis would replace Johnny
i McCandless at center. Hawkins has
been burning up the court in prac
tice sessions this week, and Husky
may start him in tlie hope that he
will be "hot."
The final game of the series with
the Blue and Gold will bring to a
close one of tiie weirdest records
ever established by a Redshirt
varsity. Including the California
j contest of last Saturday night, the
' Cards won ten clashes and dropped
j eight. Of the ten victories, eight
were registered against non-confer
ence opponents, but six of the eight
defeats came at the hands of con
' ference teams.
