# LEAK IN GAS LINE PLUS PIPE EQUALS LARGE EXPLOSION
## 
### 
HARRISON, N.Y., Feb. 20.
(TP) â€” Joseph Visceglea, 40,
has read many times that one
should not go looking for gas
leaks with matches.
Consequently, when he went
today in the basement of his
four-story apartment, house
seeking such a leak, he in
tended to rely entirely upon
his nose. There wasn't, a
match in his pockets.
However, no sooner had he
set his foot on the bottom cel
lar step than he was blown
hack up the stairway, badly
cut. and bruised,
Joseph had overlooked the
pipe lie was smoking.
