# KEHO TO PLAY DIFFICULT PART IN ENGLISH CLUB PLAY "GRANITE"
## 
### BY CATHERINE SPAULDING 
Km I herine Kelio, in Iter int ei'prc- |
tat ion of Judith, the leading char- i
! acter in "Granite," the lOnglish
| Club play which is to he presented
! to the campus February 28, will
! have an immense amount to sav, ,
I '
hut little to do. The character of
| Judith, whom Clemence Dane por- I
' trays as rough, sullen, and yet pas
j sionately dinging, is extremely j
j difficult and calls for a very dra- ;
1 niatie stage, presence with few,
hut significant, actions.
The stormy and rocky character
of the island, Lundy, has moulded
I her character, and although she is
j a woman who aspires to love and
life, she is chained to the soil and (
a barren existence. She is fearless
, enough to tempt fate, brave enough
| to take what it offers, and appears j
I as the personification of crushed
happiness.
The tremendous feeling, and j
overwhelming emotions of Judith
! give her the strange passionate
j character almost typical of the
| lironte heroines. Instead of choos
ing commonplace characters for ,
this melodrama, Clemence Dane
has produced strong passionate
middleclitss people who react t<> j

nature, instead of civilized society.
Critics differ as to whether the
Nameless Man, played by Bob
C'atheart, is really the devil in per
son or not, lint Judith is led to be
lieve lie is and so bargains her
life away to him. Her moods are
subservient to his suggestions. She
feels —and he executes her un
spoken will, distorting her inten
tions, and carrying her half-ex
pressed wish to unwelcome ful
fillment.
Cathcart's performance, as a
veritable symbol of evil, will make
or break the play. He furnishes
the all-important atmsophere, his
devil's laugh should make the audi
ence uneasy. He is the spirit of
the devil himself, come to life. At
first just a starved, frozen lump of
humanity, lie changes to plan and
covet for himself. He fulfills the
devil's bargain, serving up to a
point but always just on the wrong
side of achievement.
Although always in the back
ground. and with little to say, the
devil is invariably present in most
of the scenes, and Judith is un
consciously influenced in all her
actions and thought by him.

' trays as rough, sullen, and yet pas
j sionately dinging, is extremely j
j difficult and calls for a very dra- ;

The stormy and rocky character
of the island, Lundy, has moulded
I her character, and although she is
j a woman who aspires to love and
life, she is chained to the soil and (
a barren existence. She is fearless

I as the personification of crushed
happiness.
The tremendous feeling, and j
overwhelming emotions of Judith
! give her the strange passionate
j character almost typical of the
| lironte heroines. Instead of choos
ing commonplace characters for ,
this melodrama, Clemence Dane
has produced strong passionate
middleclitss people who react t<> j

nature, instead of civilized society.
Critics differ as to whether the
Nameless Man, played by Bob
C'atheart, is really the devil in per
son or not, lint Judith is led to be

life away to him. Her moods are
subservient to his suggestions. She
feels —and he executes her un
spoken will, distorting her inten
tions, and carrying her half-ex
pressed wish to unwelcome ful
fillment.
Cathcart's performance, as a
veritable symbol of evil, will make
or break the play. He furnishes
the all-important atmsophere, his
devil's laugh should make the audi
ence uneasy. He is the spirit of
the devil himself, come to life. At
first just a starved, frozen lump of
humanity, lie changes to plan and
covet for himself. He fulfills the
devil's bargain, serving up to a
point but always just on the wrong
side of achievement.
Although always in the back
ground. and with little to say, the
devil is invariably present in most
of the scenes, and Judith is un
consciously influenced in all her
actions and thought by him.
