## 
### 
Two powerful and hard-lighting
quintets came together last ninlil
when Sequoia 1 defeated the Phi
Betes ::o to 27 in intramural play
and the result was an intramural
••lassie, exciting, fast, rough, hotly
contested, but with plenty of team
play. Nip-and-tuck was the word
all the way through with the Phi
Betes holding an 18-13 lead at half
time.
"Swede" Polmberg of Sequoia
led the scorers with Ipoints and
sank the winning basket from mid
court to round out a nice evening.
Van Ktten looked good for Phi
Betes.
Fisher showed the way to LI
Toro by ringing up l. r > digits and
the clubmen I rimmed -Zeta Psi '35-7
for the championship of League 5.
Alpha Tan Omega and Delta Kappa
Lpsilon failed to show up for the
third scheduled game.
