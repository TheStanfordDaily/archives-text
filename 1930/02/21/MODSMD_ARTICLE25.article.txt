right of a man and his wife tu
be demonstratively affectionate
in the'gloom of a tnovie thea

vindication by a Chicago jury.
l'cter and Ruby Dogert, man
and wife, had gone to the Craw
ford Theatre and while there did
engage in what has come to be
known, even in courts of law,
as necking. There is a certain
group of citizenry which frowns
(in such things, and the first thing
the DorcHs knew the manage
nicn' had passed the word along
that the Dogerts must never
darken the door of the theater

Mrs. Dogert sued the theater
and got a judgment of $800.
which was set aside. She sued
again and yesterday the jury
awarded her $1,250.
