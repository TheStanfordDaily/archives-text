MEN AND MACHINES. By Stuart
Chase. Macmiltan. 1929.
Tlio.se readers who habitually
avoid scientific and philosophic
literature as a matter of principle
to save themselves from boredom,
or an over-

taxing of the
brain, will do
well to aban
don Ibis prin
ciple in the
case of "Men
a n (I ;\1 a -
<• hi n e s
Though< 112 u I
and deep, yet
written with

an easy, rarely stimulating style,
ii is neither boring nor burden
some.
"Men and Machines" is a bril
liant, comprehensive, philosophic
discussion ol' I lie v effects of ma
chines upon modern life -its civili
zation and its ideals. Mr. Chase is
well known to the American busi
ness man, as the author of "The
Tragedy of Waste," and "Your
Money's Worth"; books that place
him in the front rank as a statis
tician and economist. Willi "Men
and Machines" lie has not only
strengthened his claim for distinc
tion in Ibis field, but has proved
himself llie possessor of a racy,
keen, provocative style, unusual in
writers of this type of non-fiction.
A practical man, the author or
ganizes his material so skillfully
and with such graphic emphasis
thai the man on the farm or the
man in the subway lollows it with
ease, lie does not Wander in use
less speculation. He has :» definite
aim, and he does not swerve from
it. Machines are the outstanding
phenomena of the modern age.
Civilization of today lo be under
stood must be viewed in 1 lie light
of the challenge which the mech
anical environment offers to hu
man nature. Mr. Chase makes an
invaluable contribution, therefore,
in the concrete and powerful pic
ture which he presents of llih man
machine relationship. He is not an
optimist, lie neither defends nor
attacks. He sees conditions as they
are, yel insists that, creative effort

| alone will he found (lie real source
1 of hope and power for the civiliza-
I ion and culture of the future.
The facts are sufficient. Mr.
Chase does not need to advance
spectacular contentions in order to
insure having his hook read. It
will he read for the soundness and
! interest, the direct cheerful effi
ciency of the pages—exactly as the
| author intended. —M. L. R.
MR. MULLINER SPEAKING. By
P. G. Wodehouse. Doubleday,
Doran Co. New York: 1930.
Here we find again all P. 0.
Wodehouse's well-known charac
ters: beautiful young men, sartori
j ally perfect, even if a trifle simple:
I Ambroses, Algernons, and Archi
balds. The whole flock of them ap
; pear in "Mr. Mulliner Speaking,"
| and they are still as amusing as
\ ever.
| Mr. Wodehouse's hooks are as
| easy and light* reading as will ever
be found, but there is nothing flat
I or lifeless about them. Ilis latest
book proves no exception to this.
1 The various escapades of certain
; love-sick young men are scream
-1 ingly funny.
In this book Mr. Mulliner enter
tains the company at Angler's Itest
, with episodes from the life of his
| numerous nephews, nieces, and
cousins. All the Mulliners, no mat
ter how remotely removed from
the main branch, are singularly
'gifted, it seems, with Beauty and
Breeding. These gifts, however, do
not prevent them from getting into
| absurd predicaments or devaslal
j ing love affairs. The Mulliners are
| never unhappy and always am us-
Mr. Wodehouse has a very de
cided ability to make people laugh,
lie constantly uses expressions and
words which are impossible In
read witli a straight face, lie has a
special genius for depicting atro
cious small boys and stolid, aristo
cratic butlers. Perhaps his utter
absurdity is responsible for his
success, for nobody can resist ab
surdity when it is dressed up with
Wodehouse's own peculiar manner
of expression. —N. J.
