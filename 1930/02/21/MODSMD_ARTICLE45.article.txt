## MORE ABOUT THE "STARVING BULGARIANS" 
### 
The Editor, Sir: ;
In reference to the editorial on
the starving Bulgarians appearing
in the Daily of Wednesday morn
ing, it is certainly true that if the
assignment of funds to be collected
were universal to colleges of the
country one would respond more .
willingly. However, it seems to me
that if one is minded to be philan
thropic he need not he bothered by
some petty disagreement. Very few
co-operative actions have had the
absolute support of the partici

pants.
"In group action," someone has
said, "the individual must nearly
always restrain certain of his ac
tions and opinions." The achieve
ment, if constructive, will be
greater than that of the individual
alone, or "many minds are better
than one." "Quarreling over laths
never built cities." And so ad infini
tum. â€”"Interested."
