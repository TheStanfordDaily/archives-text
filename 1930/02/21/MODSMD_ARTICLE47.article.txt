Petition or no petition, Coach
Husky Hunt's players are deter
mined to end the Blue and Gold
monopoly of basketball games
which has withstood lite Cards'
most vicious assaults for the past
live years without exception.
And if the pep displayed in this
week's practice session means any
thing, Hunt's five is quite likely
to turn the trick. The Cards have
been working overtime since the
recent Oakland downfall, on of
fense and defense and in convert
ing free throws. Yesterday's spir
ited srimmage was the last prac
tice of the season, the players be
ing scheduled to take things easy
today to store np plenty of steam
for tomorrow's 1 ;♦:!<> climax against
the Bears.'
Bears Fired Up
Consequently, the game is ex
pected to be the thriller of the
v»ar, as Nibs Price's men are also
Jh'ed up for forty minutes of hectic
play. Not only are the Hears
atlxious to keep their five winters'
string of victories over the Cards
intact, hut a win may give the
Berkeley quintet a tie with the
Trojans for conference honors, pro
vided that U.C.L.A. unexpectedly
upsets Troy this week-end.
One reason why Hunt is looking
forward to the tilt with optimism
is that his regular defensive com
bination, Captain Rothert and Mike
Reynolds, has been showing up
well during the past few scrim
mages. Rothert had his first bad
night of the year last Saturday,
which accounted for an over-abun
dance of sucker shots by Wils
Tripp, Hear forward. The Card
mentor has a hunch that it was
Ilothert's final off evening, as well.
Long John at Center
Long .John McCandless will start
at center as usual, and if the elon
gated pivot man taps in close shots
as he has at times this season, Ihe
stage will be all set for the Cards'
first Big Series frolic since 1925.
However, if Long John fails to
find his eye, Bud Hawkins will see
action during a major part of the
evening's fracas. Although Haw
kins can not be counted on to lo
cale the hoop with any sort of
regularity, he is, certain to speed
up the Cards' floor game. In fact,
it was Hawkins' work that threw
a scare into the Cal boys during
the second half of last week's tilt.
Dynamic Pair
lied Berg and Don Tyler, small
est, yet most dynamic players, on
the Stanford squad, will open at
forward. Both of these men hound
the ball most lenweiously and übi
quitously, while Berg is the team's
long-shot artist. The redhead, who
will be playing bis last, game for
1 tie Kami institution, has featured
in every game to date.
Nibs Price i* planning to start
t he same combination that trounced
Stanford in their last engagement,
though there is a possibility of
Davis getting the call over Coffield
at guard. Besides Trip]), the Cards
will be out to bottle up Pursel, who
leads the Conference in flipping
baskets through the net.

atlxious to keep their five winters'
string of victories over the Cards
intact, hut a win may give the
Berkeley quintet a tie with the
Trojans for conference honors, pro
vided that U.C.L.A. unexpectedly
upsets Troy this week-end.
One reason why Hunt is looking
forward to the tilt with optimism
is that his regular defensive com
bination, Captain Rothert and Mike
Reynolds, has been showing up
well during the past few scrim
mages. Rothert had his first bad
night of the year last Saturday,
which accounted for an over-abun
dance of sucker shots by Wils
Tripp, Hear forward. The Card
mentor has a hunch that it was
Ilothert's final off evening, as well.
Long John at Center
Long .John McCandless will start
at center as usual, and if the elon
gated pivot man taps in close shots
as he has at times this season, Ihe
stage will be all set for the Cards'
first Big Series frolic since 1925.
However, if Long John fails to
find his eye, Bud Hawkins will see
action during a major part of the
evening's fracas. Although Haw
kins can not be counted on to lo
cale the hoop with any sort of
regularity, he is, certain to speed
up the Cards' floor game. In fact,
it was Hawkins' work that threw
a scare into the Cal boys during
the second half of last week's tilt.
Dynamic Pair
lied Berg and Don Tyler, small
est, yet most dynamic players, on
the Stanford squad, will open at
forward. Both of these men hound
the ball most lenweiously and übi
quitously, while Berg is the team's
long-shot artist. The redhead, who
will be playing bis last, game for
1 tie Kami institution, has featured
in every game to date.

Husky Hunt's players are deter

monopoly of basketball games
which has withstood lite Cards'
most vicious assaults for the past
live years without exception.
And if the pep displayed in this
week's practice session means any

to turn the trick. The Cards have
been working overtime since the
recent Oakland downfall, on of
