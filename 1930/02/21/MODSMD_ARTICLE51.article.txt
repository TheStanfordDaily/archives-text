# JOHNNY, THE GIANT KILLER.
## STANFORD FAVORED TO BEAT CALIFORNIA IN SWIM MEET A WEEK FROM SATURDAY 
### BY REID R. BRIGGS Feg Murray, '16 
Thirteen unlucky points! That's J
just what Stanford expects to leave :
for California in the annual big!
swimming meet Saturday, March i
J. When the Golden Bears come
down to Encina pool next week, !
the Cardinals plan* to give them j
the severest drubbing the U.C. j
mermen have had for a long time.
The Stanford varsity should j
take first and second place in t
every event. And the Redshirt J
yearling squad will try to emulate 1
their big brothers.
The varsity will enter the meet j
j with every man of the 1929 squad,
j and a bunch of flashy swimmers l
j from last year's freshman team.
Reggy Harrison's performance in
; pre-season trials indicates that
! this will be the best season of his
! career. The veteran senior sprinter
has been doing the 100-yard free
■ style event in about 54 seconds j
j quite consistently. It isn't a faint;
j hope to expect a new coast record j
j from him next week.
Another sprinter is John McKel- j
| vev, sophomore. He won the j
i Pacific Association junior 100-yard j
free-style at the Olympic Club this j
i week, and closely presses Harrison '
l in that event. In the 50-yard sprint j
! he shows promise, doing it. daily j
i under 25 seconds. Ward Woods and j
i John Trotter are two men from !
last year's freshman sprinters, who j
will back up Harrison and McKel- i
vey. Woods captured third in the ]
j P.A.A. race won by McKelvey.
Austin Clapp, premier middle- j
! distance swimmer in the United j
' States, and 192S Olympic Games
star, is making the exceptionally ;
; fast time of 5:03 in tlie 440-yard '
| free-style. Very few men in the i
i country can equal that pace. In the j
I 220 he swims close to record time 1
| in practice competition. Last week- j
I end lie captured first in that event j
| at the senior Pacific Association j
j championships in San Francisco, j
j His time was 2:24.1! minutes,
j Second place in that same race
i went to another Stanford sopho
i more, Frank Booth. This pair of
! Clapp and Booth ought to win
i plenty of first and seconds for the i

Cards in this year's meets. Both !
of them have been swimming back-j
stroke this season, and are able to j
click off Ihe 100-yard distance in
the fast lime of 1:05 minutes.
Ogden Driggs has been Stanford
mainstay in the hack-stroke and '
middle-distances for the last three 1
years, but Coach Ernst Brandsten
this year plans to nse him in t lie
50-yard sprint, as well. His stamina
and speed will make a strong bid
for firsts in the California meet.
In the breast-stroke Brandsten
has two swimmers who would
warm the heart of any coach —
Ferd Fletcher and Whitey Burns.
These boys alternately trim each
other in practice races, and next
week's meet will furnish plenty of
splashing in this event. California
lias nothing to equal Fletcher's
time of 2: iiS in the 200-yard breast
stroke. In the 100 Burns is a bit
stronger. As for medley relay men
—they're a pair of knockouts!
In diving,. Pete Desjardins is
rounding into the form which made
him three-year national champion,
and won the Olympic title in 1928.
He showed his ability in the inter
class meet two weeks ago, leaving
no doubt in spectators' minds that
he should have any difficulty, in
defeating any other college diver
in the United States. Ed Tlirond
son practices daily with Pete, and
shows his usual precision in knif
ing the water. Last year he did il
to win t lie Coast championship.
This year ihe team of Desjardinsg
and Throndson could be counted"
oil to knock off first and second
against about any collegiate squad
you might name.
The medley relay, always an ex
citing contest, will be a headline!'
this year, with Reggy Harrison
doing the free-style work, Whitey
Burns as breast-stroker, and Aus
tin Clapp back-stroking. In the 200-
yard free-style relay, Brandsten
has a group of speedy swimmers
to choose from: Ogden Driggs,
Reggy Harrison, Austin Clapp,
Frank Booth, John McKelvey, Bar
rett Brown, John Trotter, and
Ward Woods.
