# STANFORD MEETS ST. MARY'S NINE; FAVORED TO WIN
## Teams in Conference Tilt Tomorrow Afternoon At Moraga Field 
### Howard Moore 
Although Stanford's varsity nine
didn't give its new uniforms a
very good initiation at Wednes
day's encounter with the Santa
Clara diamond men, Coach Harry
Wolter's ball artists are raring to
burst forth in the Saint Mary's
baseball park tomorrow afternoon
and make up for the Bronco de
feat-
Breaks were decidedly against
the Redshirts last Wednesday.
Loomis pitched a three-hit game
and the only bauble in the fielding
was of the type that borders, be
tween a tough-luck error and a too
hard-hit grounder.
At 2:30 o'clock tomorrow after
noon. Stanford plays her third con
ference tilt, and if the Moraga
school doesn't get too much help
from Lady Luck, the Cards ought
to win. Wolter lias a good pitching
staff, and his men have displayed
plenty of hitting power. Taylor will
start on the mound with Hardy on
Ihe receiving end. The infield and
outer garden positions will be
filled by the usual line-up.
St. Mary's Good
St. Mary's boasts of a sure con
ference winner, but on the surface
of things the Gaels seem to have
little else than a good catcher and
a well-balanced twirling staff. Con
-lin or Hamilton, probably the lat
ter, will be in the box for Moraga,
and both have two years of ex
perience.
Butch Simas, captain<hf the bas
ketball team, may catch, but
chances are that a substitute will
be behind the platter. Armand
Seghetti will be on first, and
Valim, Thomas, and Neeley, all
newcomers, will be at second,
third, and short, respectively. Ack
erman and Stennett, football stars,
will play out in the pastures with
Ragus, another new name to the
box scores.
The Stanford line-up: Taylor p.
Hardy c, Good ell lb. Churchill 2b,

Although Stanford's varsity nine
didn't give its new uniforms a
very good initiation at Wednes
day's encounter with the Santa
Clara diamond men, Coach Harry
Wolter's ball artists are raring to
burst forth in the Saint Mary's
baseball park tomorrow afternoon
and make up for the Bronco de
feat-
Breaks were decidedly against
the Redshirts last Wednesday.
Loomis pitched a three-hit game
and the only bauble in the fielding
was of the type that borders, be
tween a tough-luck error and a too
hard-hit grounder.
At 2:30 o'clock tomorrow after
noon. Stanford plays her third con
ference tilt, and if the Moraga
school doesn't get too much help
from Lady Luck, the Cards ought
to win. Wolter lias a good pitching
staff, and his men have displayed
plenty of hitting power. Taylor will
start on the mound with Hardy on
Ihe receiving end. The infield and
outer garden positions will be
filled by the usual line-up.
St. Mary's Good
St. Mary's boasts of a sure con
ference winner, but on the surface
of things the Gaels seem to have
little else than a good catcher and
a well-balanced twirling staff. Con
-lin or Hamilton, probably the lat
ter, will be in the box for Moraga,
and both have two years of ex
perience.
Butch Simas, captain<hf the bas
ketball team, may catch, but
chances are that a substitute will
be behind the platter. Armand
Seghetti will be on first, and
Valim, Thomas, and Neeley, all
newcomers, will be at second,
third, and short, respectively. Ack
erman and Stennett, football stars,
will play out in the pastures with
Ragus, another new name to the
box scores.
