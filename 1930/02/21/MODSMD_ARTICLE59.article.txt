# CARD FROSH WILL TANGLE WITH U.C. BABES TOMORROW
## Previous Scores Point To Fight For Yearling Series Win 
### Stewart Crawford 
Meeting the California freshmen
in the deciding lilt of their series,
the Card babe quintet will tangle
with the Bear Cubs at 0:45 tomor
row night in the Stanford Pavilion
in the preliminary to the varsity
contest.
Coach Jimmy Bradshaw put his
outfit through a brisk workout tli,is
afternoon in preparation for the
encounter, which from all pre-game
dope will be about as hard-foughl
as any yearling battle that lit"
fans have witnessed in Ihe Farm
Pavilion. The Card babes took a
: nip-and-tuck affair,from the U.C.
freshmen by one point early in the
season, only to be downed by a
33 to 25 count when they journeyed
to the Oakland auditorium to meet
the Blue and Gold last Saturday.
In this contest, the Stanford
cagers looked good individually,
but failed to work together, and
seemed to lack the punch to take
advantage of the scoring oppor
tunities that they had in the first
I half. Bradsliaw believes that due
to the poor start of bis outfit, the
Bear Cubs became confident and
proceeded to walk away with the
ball game. The U.C. yearlings are
out to revenge last year's defeats
at the hands of Bradsliaw's outfit,
when Stanford took two one-sided
victories from the Berkeley year-
I lings.
Man for man, the two teams are
evienlv matched,# both physically
' and in basketball ability. The Card
guards are slightly bigger men,
while in Ihe forward territory Cali
fornia has the edge in size. Their
center has been taking the tip-olf
away from Edelen, pivot man for
the Farm five.
Hancock and Tway will start at
guard for Stanford, with Edelen at
center, Palmer playing one for
ward, and either Cordry or Meade
at the other.
