# SENIOR, FRESHMAN NINES PLAY FIRST CLASS TILT TODAY
## 
### 
I With hastily organized teams,
and no practice, but plenty of de
termination, freshman and senior
interclass baseball nines are set for
the opening game of the class
tournament this afternoon when
they meet each other on the fresh
man diamond.
The first-year men have a couple
of days' head start in their or
ganization over their opponents
and boast a 15-man squad, but the
greater experience of the seniors
will probably make up for their
late start.
Starting at 4:1." this afternoon,
the game will be seven innings in
length. It is the first of a six-game
series which will determine the
-interclass championship. Sopho
mores will cross bats with the jnn
-1 iors in the second game Monday.
