In 1927 there were 1500 men
studying forestry in the 2d schools
giving degrees in this subject.
There were also 50 additional
schools giving courses in forestry.
An adequate training in techni
cal or applied forestry cannot be
secured in less than four to six
years. In addition to the technical
work in the schools, comparable to
the training of an engineer, much
first-hand experience in the woods
must be secured during summers
or by apprenticeship after college.
Oregon State College lias a well
recognized school of forestry, giv
ing a four-year curricula in log
ging engineering, lumber manufac
turing, and technical forestry, each
of which lead to the degree of B.S.
in forestry. The universities of
California, Washington, Washing
lon State, Idaho, and Montana,
have either forestry schools or de
partments. Leading graduate
schools are to be found at Yale,
Harvard, and Syracuse.
Of the GOO billion feet of stand
ing timber in the United States
more than one-half is located in
the states of Oregon, Washington,
and California. Oregon alone has
one-fifth of the standing timber in
the United States.
To care for the National Forests
there was in 1026 a force of 4,089
men, of whom 1,630 were techni
cally trained in forestry. Today tlie
number of men employed by the
private timber companies, the rail
roads, and the state greatly ex
ceeds the number employed in the
national service.
Training in forestry leads to the
business administration, promo
tion, conservation, lire protection,
and grazing development of the

I National Forests, or to the logging
i and manufacturing, replanting, and
1 lire protection of the timber lands
: of private companies. In addition
35 states employ large forces of
foresters in conservation, fire pro
i tection, and education of the pub
i lie. Research is engaged in by all
; agencies, and extensive programs
I of planting and cultivation of tiin
j ber-producing lands are being un*
j dertaken by public and private
I groups.
With the exception of the Chief
| Forester, the administrative posi
| tions in the Forest Service of the
! Department of Agriculture in
j Washington, D.C., and in the dis
j triet offices, pay from $3,800 to
I $6,000. Supervisors of field work
| get from $2,700 to $3,900, junior
j foresters from $1,860 to $2,400,
I rangers from $1,020 (assistant
' rangers) to $2,400 (senior rangers).
| Salaries of corresponding positions
|in private companies are some
j what higher. A State Forester gets
from $3,000 to $6,000, and his as
i sistants from $1,800 to $3,600.
Specialization in either the tech
â–  nical or business administration
j phases of forestry is common, both
J branches demanding a high de-
I gree of technical training and ad
ministrative ability. A good phys
j ique is necessary, 40 to 60 per
t cent of tlie time ot' even adminis
i trative officers being spent in the
; field. A fairly long period of ap
! prenticeship in the field is to be
! expected.
i Best reading references on for
| estry as a vocation are: "The
| Training of a Forester" by Gifford
: Pinchott (1914), and "Forestry as
! a Profession" by E. A. Sherman of
| the Forest Service (1927).
