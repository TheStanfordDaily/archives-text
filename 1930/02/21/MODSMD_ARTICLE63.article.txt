# EXPECT FAST TIMES IN PRACTICE TRACK MEET AT OLD OVAL
## 
### 
Another fast meet should result
this afternoon when Dink Temple
ton trots his athletes out on the
Old Oval at 4 o'clock.
Storms and Parker should have
their usual battle in the mile.
Parker showed so much improve
ment last week over the week be
fore that he should give Storms a
good race. The time, in the event
of warm weather, should be close
to 4:30.
Ilables and Dyer ran a 10 flat
10(1 last night, and should repeat
this afternoon on a dry track.
Morrison is in shape to take a
bit off his 440 time of last week,
though he will not have the compe
tition of Eastman, since the fresh
men meet Menlo and Modesto
Jaysees tomorrow morning.
Dowell should come up in tlie
broad jump, though he lias been
beaten pretty consistently by both
Duller and West in practice.
The Cards' greatest weaknesses
at present are in the high jump,
pole vault, and javelin, so the en
tries in these events will be closely
watched for improvement.
