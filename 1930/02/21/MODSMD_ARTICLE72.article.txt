### 
Stanford fathers are not the only
ones to he ensnared by "Professor
Bush's" fradulent impostures, ac
cording to reports received at the
Dean of Men's office yesterday.
The "professor" swindled so
many parents of students at
Thacher School, in southern Cali
fornia, that a circular letter was
finally sent last January to all
those connected with the institu
tion, warning them of his activi
ties. The "professor" was described
as a "rather gay, intelligent, and
well-educated man, with a slight
foreign accent, between fifty-five
and sixty years of age."
He.had cailed on parents of the
! boys of the school in Oregon, Colo
! rado, Minnesota, and Boston, Mas
j sacliusetts, the letter stated, pos
| ing under the names of Richard
I Fry, Augustus Fry, and Dr. Peters,
| and declaring that he had a sick
| wife and was temporarily in great
' need.
