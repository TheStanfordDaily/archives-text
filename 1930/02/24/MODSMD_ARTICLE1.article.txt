MOSCOW, 1;.5.5.11., Feb. 23. (/P)
Coincident with the celebration
today of the twelfth anniversary of
the founding of the Ked Army, So
viet newspapers and political lead
ers renewed the loud cry of "war."
They appealed to the country to be
on guard against the menace from
imperialistic powers which are pic
tured as jealous of the Soviet's eco
nomic and industrial progress.
Communist authorities here ap
pear to entertain genuine fear that
the Soviet's European neighbors in
tend, in concert, to inaugurate
either economic, measures against
their government, or a direct mili
tary attack. This war scare has be
come immeasurably intensified by
the present campaign abroad
against the Soviet government for
its attitude respecting religion.
Hits Capitalism
"All the forces of reaction
throughout Hi" world are mobilized
against the Soviet Union, which
is going full speed ahead toward
Socialism," declares lzvestia in a
llaming front page editorial. "The
Pope, the Archibishop of Canter
bury, the Fronch police, the Eng
lish die-hards, social fascists, for
eign counterfeiter's of soviet money,
and the German bourgeoisie have
united into one holy union to
launch new bandit attacks upon
our country."
Pravda says the present anti-
Soviel campaign abroad is unpre
cedented in its fury, hatred, extent,
and forms and is the; precursor of
an armed attack by the capitalistic
states.
Playing to the same tune of war,
K. 10. Voroshiloff, who replaced
Leon Trotzky as head of the Red
Army, warns the country that the
Red Army must ever be ready to
repel foreign invasion. He calls at
tention to the fact. that, foreign
armies, including Ihe American,
have grown enormously in recent
years.
