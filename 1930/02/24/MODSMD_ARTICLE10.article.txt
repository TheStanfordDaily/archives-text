# ARLISS FREQUENTLY TAKEN FOR DISRAELI SAYS MISS HOWELL
## 
### Ruth Miner 
"George Arliss is so linked with
his portrayal of Disraeli both on
the stage and in talkies that, some
people have confused him with the
English hero," said Maude T.
Howell, '10, stage manager to I lie
player, and campus visitor for the
past week.
"An American girl who was trav
eling abroad saw the statue of Dis
raeli in Westminster Abbey and
exclaimed happily, 'How very nice
of the English to put a memorial
to George Arliss' here, even before
he dies!'
"Another instance i heard of was
of a woman who went into a Lon
don bookstore and asked for the
'Life of George Arliss by some
Frenchman,' confusing it with
Maurois' 'Life of Disraeli.'
"His wife travels with him most
of the time. She played 'Mrs. Dis
raeli' on the stage with him five
years, before they were together
in the movie. He likes Hollywood,
too, but I think he will go back
on the. stage; soon because of course
he played there lirsl and longest.
He is in London now and is looking
for a new play."
Miss Howell will go to Cannel
the first of the week but will re
turn to the campus before she
leaves for Los Angeles, which is
her home when she is not on tour.
