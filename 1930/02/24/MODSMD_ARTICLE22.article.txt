In direct contrast to Lawrence
Tibbett, who achieved liis world
reputation without crossing the
boundaries of his native America,
Mme. Sigrid Onegin comes to Stan
ford as an international artist by
birth and association.
Born in Sweden of a French
mother and a German father, she
was later in childhood taken to
Paris, where she studied at the
convent of the Sacre Coeur. Thus
as a child she could speak three of
the six languages she now sings.
She made her debut in Germany
and was soon singing opera
throughout Central Europe. In 1920,
appearing at Munchen, she con
tracted a bad case of sunburn on
the afternoon of one of the perform
ances. At the theatre she put the
makeup on over the sunburn and
became violently ill. The attending
physician, Dr. Penzoldt, won her
favor, and in 1922 she married him.
Since then she has sung opera
and concerts in Europe and Amer
ica, this 19c!0 tour being her sixth
season in the United States and
her second visij. to' the Pacific
Coast.
