# UNFORTUNATE, BUT UNAVOIDABLE DELAY
## 
### 
When the storm of controversy broke over the tenure of office
of ( oach I*.. I'. limit, Stanford basketball mentor, the Daily editori
ally uracil the Hoard ol Athletic ( ontrol to take immediate and de
risive action on the matter. Such a course was the onlv one which
seemed fair to ('oach I lunt and to those who seek to shift his duties.
1 hursday evening the l!oard met and considered the petitions
which had been signed by <554 students. Instead of taking immediate
and decisive action, the Hoard referred the matter to a committee
on appointments.
Ihe Daily has investigated thoroughly the reasons for this
delay, and has found that the Hoard was justified in its move. Rigid
rules of procedure precluded the possibility of prompt action.
Action by the Hoard must be reviewed bv I'resident Wilbur and
by the Hoard of I rustees before it becomes final. I Hat regulation is
bard and fast, and could not be disregarded even in a matter of the
importance of this one.
I he Daily has concluded, therefore, that the Hoard of Athletic
('ontrol cannot be censured for the delay which has resulted. The
question of promptness was entirely bevoud the Hoard members'
â€¢ ontrol.
I lie Daily still insists, however, that fairness and good taste
demand that no unnecessary delay be tolerated. The matter must be
rushed to a conclusion with all speed possible.' The present delay
cannot be helped, but the ponderous administrative machinery which
caused it should be made to roll with alacritv.
