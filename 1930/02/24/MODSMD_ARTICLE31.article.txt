Perhaps ii would lie going a little too far to speak of lalior or
gnnizations, farmers, and nianu facturers as criminals, but I lie pres

sions of useful industrial training to California's 7000 felons conies
very near placing' them in the category of criminal accomplices.
It is a well known fact that the less social and industrial train
ing a convict has, the more frequently he appears at the gates of
penal institutions for anti-social behavior. Most prisoners are be
hind the walls because of industrial, physical, or social defects. Any
rational system of state correction should include practical training
in the means of making an honest and respectable living as well as
1 lie removal of such physical or other difficulties from which the
prisoner may suffer.
Representatives of the labor organizations, farmers, and manu
facturers are in Sacramento now struggling to prevent the special
legislative committee from recommending *Mc inclusion of sound
industrial training in the program of prison reform. Thev are
heartily in favor of compulsory education and physical exercise for
the inmates of San Uncut in and I olsom, but condemn any attempt
1o have the convicts learn to be useful citizens by instructing them
in industrial production.
The opposition conies because they do not want industrial or
agricultural competition. I hey would sacrifice social health for a
modicum of financial gain. They would release the convict to prey
once more upon society, for that is his only alternative when he can
do nothing except menial, degrading work.
What the released prisoner needs more than anything else is a
chance to redeem his self respect, and he can do that only by fitting
into the economic and social order with as little friction as possible,
lie is already handicapped sufficiently by the stigma his imprison
ment places upon him.
Modern production methods have done much to create social
problems. It is time industrialists begin to realize their social re
sponsibility and forego small selfish profits in order that societv
nia\ solve some of those problems.
