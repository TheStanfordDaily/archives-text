BROKEN DISHES. At the Presi
dent Theatre, Sati Francisco
A typical Henry DulYy Players'
sketch of hectic life in I he great
American home, "Broken Dishes"
carries one through a satisfying'
evening of divert isement. An over
abundance of mental strain is not
necessary to enjoy the plot, yei
the jocosity, i lie tomfoolery of
slapstick is missing.
Tlie inimitable Percy Pollock as
Cyrus Bumpsted swings the com
edy along in all its ramifications
of character study. Dominated
throughout his life by Spouse Jen
ny IJumpsted (Miss Alma Chester),
Mr. Humpsted lives under the con
tinual exemplary shadow of one
Chester Armstrong, the man of
millions Jenny scorned in favor
of $20 a-week Cyrus, ;i grocery
clerk.
The action transpires in the
Humpsted living room in :i small
mid-western home. Cyrus is late
for dinner. He'd promised to uel
home early, so his family could go
to I he movies. Late, he must run
the gamut of Mother Humpsted's
fiery emotions. I lis only bit of com
fort is Daughter Klaino ((J race
Stafford). To the movies the fam
ily finally goes. Father and
daughter are lel'l to do the dishes.
Now dishes play :i major part in
the vehicle for Jenny Hnmpsled
always maintained that she'd "nev
er have a dirty dish in her house."
lint somehow the dishes never gel
done on that eventful eve.
So the play swings under way
portraying kind, generous Papa
Humpsted ruled in every respect
by his tyrannic wife. Elaine's se
cret lover, a delivery boy, is :in
other element in the stageplay.
Before the evening of tragi comic
adventure has passed, the Great
God Chester Armstrong appears to
utterly disrupt a clandestine mar
riage and incidentally jolt Mama
Humpsted off her throne of domi
nance.
Pollock captures comic honors
with his thorough, convincing
character presentation. His man
nerisms, speech, and minute ges

• tures are oT the comedian supreme
willi little searing spots here and
there of .subtle tragedy.
j Tilt) Duffy I'layei'H, in thin ster
ling production, bring together a
character group, unified yet indi
vidualistic;. Sit through two hours
of (|iiifi, rippling humor in the
strained domicile of Cyrus Hump
sled, if you would spend an eve
ning of real yijoynient. You won't
find any great fundamental moral
lesson Itj be packed away; and
promptly discarded; but you will
peek into an evening of Humpsted
i life. And you'll like it.

HOT FOR PARIS—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
"Hot for Paris" is little more
than a hodge-podge of low liiiino'
for broad-minded collegians. Fvi
denlly someone got hold of a hack
copy of "College Life" and wrote
the plotless story.
Hut il isn't what a cruel reviewer
said il was a college boy's idea
of Paris. Why have such a low
opinion of college boys? The play
has no pretensions and consequent
ly doesn't offend tenderly nurtured
I natures. As a compendium of ri
bald and racy rib-ticklers, "Hot for
Paris" is a partial success.
In loss-sophisticated circles il
might be considered quite naughty
The censor was saving with his
blue pencil and some wicked sinii
-1 lies remain to stimulate gallery
snickers. Fifi Dor,say rolls her eyes
after the best French manner and
makes us wonder why Lafayette
left home.
11 is well-known among the un
traveled thai French girls are in
discreet. This picture confirms the
1 rumor. Hut as Philip Space is com
ing hack, it would he unethical to
elaborate further on Urrupean in
j discretions here.
Hreathes there a, man with soul
so dead, who never to himself hath
i said, "I can't .enjoy a low joke." If
there be such then mark him well,
you'll find him at the New Stanford
/
Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday of
