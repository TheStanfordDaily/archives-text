# HULME BELIEVES PROPOSED HONOR CODE AMENDMENT WOULD RESULT IN FRICTION
## 
### BY RAWSON HOLMES 
This is Ihr firs! of a scries of opinions on I In' proposed amendment to the
Honor Code which will establish'!) system of optional proctors, by those men
7 {'lio are best able to com prehend Ihe sit nation, namely professors who Imre
Inri/e / lasses.

"I <lo not Hi ink liiiif the proposed
amendment to the Honor Code will
â– solve the problem of cheating at
examinations," said Kdward Muslin
Hulme, professor of history, recent
ly in an interview for the Daily.
"If a student, gets up during an
examination and requests the in
structor to provide a proctor, there
are quite likely to be a great many
others in the class who will not
want one and friction may there
fore result. If, 011 the other hand,
the instructor requests a proctor
the same friction may occur be
tween him and the students, and
perhaps as a consequence he will
not be able to get along as well
with the class as before.
Honor Code Weak
"Logically, the Honor Code
seems to me weak," Professor
Hulme continued. "There are only
two types of students," he pointed
out, "those who do not cheat and
those who do. The former will not
cheat under any circumstances,
honor system or no honor system.
Students who do cheat will do so

despite the honor system.
"To my mind, a solution to the
problem is to give examinations
that. are so broad in their scope
that a thorough knowledge of the
question will be necessary to an
swer it, and cheating will be of
little avail. With the type of ques
tion that calls for dates and figures
it will always be possible to profit
through illegal means; but if the
question covers a large field, a stu
dent will have to be well prepared
to answer it, and underhand meth
ods v/i 11 not aid him very much."
