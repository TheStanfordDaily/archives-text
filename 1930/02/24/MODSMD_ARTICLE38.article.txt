# QUAD PICTURES DUE AT OLD UNION NOW
## 
### 
Proofs for Quad pictures should
be returned to the desk in the
Y.M.C.A. lobby in the Old Union
at thr> earliest possible date, as
the editorial office is very anxious
to begin new work which is being
delayed by the absence of several
Quad proofs. Someone will be at
the desk from !t until 12 and I
until r> o'clock daily,
