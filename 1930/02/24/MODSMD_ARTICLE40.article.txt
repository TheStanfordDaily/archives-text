Speed -speedand more speed!
And more speed in a Washington
football team means, among other
L! ings, a turf field. So a turf field
it will he next. fall.
Just another evidence of a new
Husky gridiron era. Lighter uni
forms, less danger of injury, and
a generally beneficial psychological
effect on the players—thai, in
short, is what a turf field signifies
to coaches of the West and Middle
West's greatest football teams.
But when the board of control
passed the measure calling for this

| expenditure last night, it did not
add a financial burden to I lie
A.S.U.W. merely for the sake of
j the demon, "speed."
The transformation in 'appear
ance of the stadium field from ils
present mud-topped surface to a
pleasing green, bounded by a while
cement wall, is not hard to ima
gine.
But more pleasing still is the
financial consideration llial after
its original planting, the turf sur-'
face will cost only about one-thir l
as mudi for upkeep as the present
j barren field.
