# LIQUOR ROOT OF EVIL "Movie Stars Bad People" JANITOR IS AUTHORITY
## 
### 
"Liquor is the root of all evil"
was the opinion expressed by j
Sandy McGregor, garrulous Encina
Hall janitor, in a special interview
last night. McGregor has long
been known by occupants of the
third floor at Encina as an author
ity on all important questions, es
pecial lV prohibition and Hollywood
movie stars.
I McGregor stated that during the
'thirty years ho spent in the army
before deciding to lend his invalu
able aid to Stanford, he did not
touch one drop of liquor. "And
look," he added, "bow much good
jit did me." McGregor reached the
coveted rank of sergeant.
According to McGregor, drink
| ing among students is very com
| mon. He claims that university
I students drink more than Holly
| wood movie stars. "Unless drink- j
I ing stops at once something is go
ing to happen," was his ominous
j declaration.
Upon being questioned as to his
! opinion of 111" success of prohibi
, tion, McGregor stated, "I think thai
| prohibition has stopped everyone
from drinking except university
I students and movie stars." Mc-1
Gregor, like President Hoover,
thinks that "liquor and prosperity
cannot go hand in hand." The for
| mer added to this the thoughtful
'opinion that "liquor and gasoline j
do not mix." "Especially at college
1 and in Hollywood," he added.
McGregor's last statement was,
"Hollywood movie stars are bad i
people."
