THE SKY'S THE LIMIT
11' anyone, three years ago, had
said ihiit a loss of (iffy feet in the
shol pin would be good for nothing
holler than a third place in a dual
meet, all within earshot would have
yelled for strait jackets and the
I/added cell. Hut exactly that cata
clysmic situation looms as a pos
sibility when the Cards open their
drive for J 930 track and field hon
ors against the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club here next Saturday.
In one of these informal af
fairs held on the Old Oval last
Friday, Harlow Rothert and
Captain Eric Krenz wanned
the heart of Dink Templeton
by whirling the 16-pound pel
let out some 50 feet B'/ 2 inches
and 50 feet 7/ 2 inches, respec
tively. Astounding perform
ances for this early in the sea
son! And then, along came
Herman.
Herman is none other than Her
man Brix, former University of
Washington weight star a man
who is reaching his athletic peak
after leaving college. Competing
for the L.A.A.C. on Saturday in the
Southern California A.A.r. relay
carnival, he got his shoulder un
der the bronze missile, and when
that spherical body hit the ground,
it was jusl 51 feet 7 inches from
where it started.
Rothert, Krenz, and Ihix are all
compel ii ive athletes. They are ai
their best when the going gets
tough. If weather conditions are
lair, next Saturday's meeting
should he a classic.
Incidentally, never before
have so many great shot-put
ters appeared at one time on
the Pacific Coast. It is getting
to the point now where an as
piring weight-thrower might as
well forego asking for a suit
if he can't make the dust fly
4G or 47 feet out. Up at the
University of Washington is a
youth named Jessup who beats
49 feet without much trouble.
Over at California Coach Walt
Christie is exulting over the
showing of n husky yclept De
Berry, who is throwing the
thing around 47 feet. That
wouldn't get a first place in a
Western dual meet against any
one, although three years ago
it could be counted upon for
five points in the old digit col
umn. Down at U.S.C. they have
three possibilities in Hall,
Stewart, and Kline, but none
of them have as yet gone over
47 feet.

ances for this early in the sea
son! And then, along came
Herman.
Herman is none other than Her
man Brix, former University of
Washington weight star a man
who is reaching his athletic peak
after leaving college. Competing
for the L.A.A.C. on Saturday in the
Southern California A.A.r. relay
carnival, he got his shoulder un
der the bronze missile, and when
that spherical body hit the ground,
it was jusl 51 feet 7 inches from
where it started.
Rothert, Krenz, and Ihix are all
compel ii ive athletes. They are ai
their best when the going gets
tough. If weather conditions are
lair, next Saturday's meeting
should he a classic.
Incidentally, never before
have so many great shot-put
ters appeared at one time on
the Pacific Coast. It is getting
to the point now where an as
piring weight-thrower might as
well forego asking for a suit
if he can't make the dust fly
4G or 47 feet out. Up at the
University of Washington is a
youth named Jessup who beats
49 feet without much trouble.
Over at California Coach Walt
Christie is exulting over the
showing of n husky yclept De
Berry, who is throwing the
thing around 47 feet. That
wouldn't get a first place in a
Western dual meet against any
one, although three years ago
it could be counted upon for
five points in the old digit col
umn. Down at U.S.C. they have
three possibilities in Hall,
Stewart, and Kline, but none
of them have as yet gone over
47 feet.

THE SKY'S THE LIMIT
11' anyone, three years ago, had
said ihiit a loss of (iffy feet in the
shol pin would be good for nothing
holler than a third place in a dual
meet, all within earshot would have
yelled for strait jackets and the
I/added cell. Hut exactly that cata
clysmic situation looms as a pos
sibility when the Cards open their
drive for J 930 track and field hon
ors against the Los Angeles Ath
letic Club here next Saturday.
In one of these informal af
fairs held on the Old Oval last
Friday, Harlow Rothert and
Captain Eric Krenz wanned
the heart of Dink Templeton
by whirling the 16-pound pel
let out some 50 feet B'/ 2 inches
and 50 feet 7/ 2 inches, respec
tively. Astounding perform
