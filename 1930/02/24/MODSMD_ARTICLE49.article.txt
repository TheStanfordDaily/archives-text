### Ted DeMotte 
Despite cold weather and stiff
breezes, Dink Templeton's track
and field men managed to turn in
some pretty fair times and dis
tances in their meet Friday after
noon, with several of the perform
ers showing marked improvement
I over last, week's work.
For the first, time I his season,
I Harlow Rolhert competed in a Fri
day meet, and won ihe shot with
a heave of 50 feet SVsj inches on
his lasl put. Krenz shoved the iron
ball fi(J feet 7% inches on his lasl
j fry to take second. Krenz did not
exert himself to win the discus at
110 feet 4 inches, while Rotherl
surprised by taking second with a
nice toss of 142 feet 2 inches.
Card stock in the high jump took
a sudden rise when Allen took lirsi
with a leap of (I feet Vt inch. Last
week he tied with Madison at f>
feet 10 inches. Madison's best leap
Friday was 5 feet 8V& inches.
Hec Dyer finally succeeded in
b< tiling Les llahles in the sprints,
hut he had to run the 100 in even
time to do it. Dyer also took the
220 in a close finish with Johnny
Morrison in 22 1-5 seconds. Mor
rison, Shove, Ha hies, and McDer
mott finished the 440 in the order
named with the time 51 seconds
fiat. Morrison loafed most of the
way, but put on a sprint to pass
Shove on the final stretch. All of
the runners were probably under
52 seconds, which makes relay
prospects good.
Storms Wins
Storms again took the mile from
Parker in 4:3tj 3-10, Parker showed
a good finish, however, and was
close to the winner at the tape.
His time was about 4:38. The two
milers entered the B,SO instead of
running their regular race, and Bob
Brown showed plenty of speed in
winning from Walt Cooper in
2:02 4-"). Atkinson did not run.
Rothert threw the javelin 17.1
feet 11 inches in his first attempt
of the season. He is believed cap- j

able 01 200 feet with ;i few weeks,
of practice, and may he entered in :
that event now that lie is through ,
with liia basketball duties. Gold
smith's best effort in (lie spear- i
tossing - , was 161 feet. |
