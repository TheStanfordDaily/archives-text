SHANGHAI, Feb. 23. (/P) â€”Initial
showing of Harold Lloyd's first
talking motion picture, "Welcome
Danger," by the International Set
tlement Foreign Theatre last night
resulted in a demonstration by 350
Chinese students in tlie audience.
The students handled tlie theatre
manager roughly, demanded their
money back, and one of them
hurled a giant firecracker into t lie
center of the theatre, causing a
near-stampede.
A portion of the film depicting
alleged underworld life in San
Francisco's Chinatown, in which
Chinese opium smugglers were por
trayed, caused tlie displeasure of
the students, who charged the pic
tun; was "unfriendly and deroga
tory to the Chinese people."
Police dispersed Hie demonstra
tors, who had asked and obtained
a refund of their admission price,
and arrested the ringleader, who
was said to be a scenario writer
for a Chinese motion picture com
pany.
As a result, possibly, of the pub
licity, large audiences today wit
nessed the film, which was shown
in two foreign settlement theatres
