# THREE BRANDSTEN-TRAINED DIVERS HAVE COPPED COVETED OLYMPIC CHAMPIONSHIP
## 
### BY REID BRIGGS 
Quite a few years ago a chap
named Brandsten won the national
diving championship of Sweden.
He was a good diver, and he was
looking for opportunity. He came
to the I'nited States and got a job
as swimming coach al the Univer
sity of California.
Before long Ernst Brandsten had
become one of the outstanding wa- 1
tei sports coaches on the Pacific
Coast. In 1918 he came to Stan
ford. He didn't stop there, but has j
since then become a nationally
known authority on swimming and
diving. For the last eight .years his J
Stanford varsity teams have de
feated California in Ihe big an
nual swimming meet of the Pacific
Coast.
Divers Brandsten has trained
have had a corner on Olympic
championships ever since Clarence
Pinkston won first at the flames in
1920. Stanford started a run then
thai continued when Al White and
Dave Fall took first and second
respectively al the Olympics of
11)24, and was still going strong
when Pete liesjardins came back
from Amsterdam two years ago

with another first prize.

Brandsten conceived the idea of i
practicing dives over a .sand pit j
instead of over a pool, thus elim- j
inuting a great many of the dan-j
gers which formerly accompanied
diving instruction. That idea is 1
now used all over ihe world. The j
1 Stanford coach designed the div- j
; ing equipment which is now the !
Olympic (lames standard and used |
wherever divers compete.
Evidence of the wide esteem in '
which Ernst Brandsten is held !
among swimmers and divers is !
shown by his position on the water j
sports rules committees of both j
the A.A.C. and National lntercol- j
legiate Association.
But t he coach is a good-natured, j
modest man. He has a ruddy face \
and pleasant smile which inspire j
the men under him to give their j
utmost efforts. He is unassuming l
and likes to have his boys call 1
him Ernie. Every afternoon he is '■
at Enciini pool, training sons of the I
Stanford Red into one of the finest
swimming teams in the I'nited
States.

Coast. In 1918 he came to Stan
ford. He didn't stop there, but has j
since then become a nationally
known authority on swimming and
diving. For the last eight .years his J
Stanford varsity teams have de
feated California in Ihe big an
nual swimming meet of the Pacific
Coast.
Divers Brandsten has trained
have had a corner on Olympic
championships ever since Clarence
Pinkston won first at the flames in
1920. Stanford started a run then
thai continued when Al White and
Dave Fall took first and second
respectively al the Olympics of
11)24, and was still going strong
when Pete liesjardins came back
from Amsterdam two years ago

with another first prize.
Designs Board
Brandsten conceived the idea of i
practicing dives over a .sand pit j
instead of over a pool, thus elim- j
inuting a great many of the dan-j
gers which formerly accompanied
diving instruction. That idea is 1
now used all over ihe world. The j
1 Stanford coach designed the div- j
; ing equipment which is now the !
Olympic (lames standard and used |
wherever divers compete.
Evidence of the wide esteem in '
which Ernst Brandsten is held !
among swimmers and divers is !
shown by his position on the water j
sports rules committees of both j
the A.A.C. and National lntercol- j
legiate Association.
But t he coach is a good-natured, j
modest man. He has a ruddy face \
and pleasant smile which inspire j
the men under him to give their j
utmost efforts. He is unassuming l
and likes to have his boys call 1
him Ernie. Every afternoon he is '■
at Enciini pool, training sons of the I
Stanford Red into one of the finest
swimming teams in the I'nited
States.
