### 
Rain ayrt soggy diamonds pre
vented the St. Mary's - Stanford j
baseball game scheduled for Sat
urday afternoon. Early Friday J
morning, Stanford ollicials were
notified that the Moraga field,
where the game was originally to :
take place, would be impossible for
play and the game was called for ;
the Stanford diamond instead, but 1
Friday night rains put the local
ball orchard in just as bad shape
as lhe Gael diamond.
The B.A.C. will arrange today for
a futured ate for the lilt, possibly
on Wednesday, March 5. It is j
hoped that the three-game series j
may he completed before the Fas- j
ter vacation during the latter part
of March.
Stanford's next game, weather i
and field permitting, will be Wed-;
nesday al St. Mary's, but the two'
nines may cross bats on the Stan- !
ford ball park in case the local '
i
field is in better condition.
