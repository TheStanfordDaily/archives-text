# WIN EXTENDS U.C. MONOPOLY TO 17 BIG TILTS IN ROW
## Hunt Surprises Fans With New Lineups During One-Sided Tilt 
### Stephen Dietrich 
Willi the curtain of basketball
activities on the Farm fell ihe
Cardinal cagers' last hopes of fam
ing the Golden Bear on the hard
wood in 19:50, when California's
smooth-functioning quintet invaded
tile Stanford Pavilion on Saturday
evening to out.score Coach Musky
limit's cellar champions 41 to 2.~>.
Although the win failed to land
I'.C. on a par with the Trojans for
( outeronce honors, as Troy cinched
j ihe Southern Division title by
trouncing I'.C.L.A. on the same
night, il extended the Blue and
Gold monopoly of Big Series lilts
to seventeen straight victories dur
ing the past seven years, three of
said spectacles being snatched by
Cal this very winter.
At the same time, Saturday's
grand hoop linale precluded any
chance of senior students on the
I"arm witnessing a Bear defeat in
a court battle during their under
graduate days. For the Card cagers
have come out second best to their
Berkeley rivals ever since Hum
took over the leins as head basket
ball mentor four seasons ago.
Tyler Stars
As for the downfall if self, Stan
ford was out of the running front
the opening whistle, displaying its
usual slow-braking brand of ball
except for a few minutes in the
first half, when Don Tyler, regular
forward, was injected into the fray.
In fact, this same Tyler kept his
fellow Cards moving about al a
fair clip in tli" second period until
he was forced to tire sidelines on
personal fouls.
California, with its first, string
on the lloor, started fast, and in
â– no time ran up a lead of 8 to 1
over Hunt's new and novel mixed
Big Series lineup of regulars and
substitutes. By half time the Bear
five had increased its margin to
21 to 13, despite timely shots by
Tyler and Red Berg.
The last half was all California,
the Bear marksmen locating the
basket with ease, while the Card
offense seemed too befuddled to
pierce its opponent's defense". At
any rate, Stanford's number of
sucker shots was limited to paltry
dozen at best.
Hunt Surprises
About the only thrill the small
rabid crowd of sleepy onlookers
got in the last stage of the slaugh
ter, when Coach Hunt trotted out
a combination of giant bonecrush
ers, a quintet of robust-enough
looking stalwarts to make even a
crowd of fqotball spectators gasp.
Nibs Price retaliated, however, by
shoving in every man 011 the bench
down to the mascot.
Individually, the Cards played a
middling country game of ball, but
thev failed to click together as a
point-garnering unit. Tyler was as
outstanding as any player on the !
floor, and was high-point man for '
the home team with 11 tallies.!
Berg, at the other forward berth, !
played his regular spectacular floor
game. Captain Rothert and Mike j
Reynolds looked good on defense at i
times, though they were sucked out ;
of position 011 far too numerous oc-;
casions.
Four of the Cards were playing!
their last game for dear old Stan- '
ford IT., incidentally: Berg, for-j
ward, McCandless, center, Rothert, !
guard, and Rowley, guard.
Bears Off Form
Although the Bears managed to j
spray the hoop for 41 points, they j
could just, as well have extended
their total to 60, had they tapped
in half their set-up shots. At that, 1
Wilson Tripp and Kent Pursel j
swished six and five tries through ;
the net, respectively, and tied for j
high-scoring honors with 12 points.
Captain Ten Evck was decidedly'
off form, and tossed away enough I
chances to win the game by him- ,
self.
