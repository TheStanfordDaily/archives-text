Commander Richard E. Byrd, who has made extensive explorations of Antartica during the past year, is
now on his return voyage to the United States. In a flight over King Edward VII land he discovered a
new island and 14 peaks. Upper picture taken near the South Pole is typical of the territory over which
he flew. Below is the plane used in his flights.
