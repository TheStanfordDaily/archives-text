# DESERT, MOUNTAIN SCENES BY AMELIA WHITE ON EXHIBIT
## 
### 
Taking the place of William
Hyde Irwin's exhibit of European
and Algerian landscape paintings,
a new collection of paintings by
Amelia Glasgow White, of San
Francisco, are now on exhibit at
the Thomas Weltoa Stanford Art
Gallery.
Mrs. White, a woman of some
sixty years of age, lias been paint
ing for many years, but she recent
ly discarded all her past works and,
convinced that her age and past
artistic achievements would have
no influence on her future paint
ings, definitely changed her style
and interpretation of all her paint
ings. Her talent is revealed in
desert scenes in centra! and south
ern California. She uses oils as
her medium, and although painting
I with only the pastel tints, her pic-
I tures, decorative rather rather than
j realistic, reflect much spirit.
Other changes soon to be effect
ed consist in the addition of sever
al of the larger paintings from the
Stanford Museum to the gallery,
i with the intention of making the
museum solely a place of natural
history subjects, and the gallery a
place for paintings and art objects
alone.
