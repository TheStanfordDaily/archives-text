drew J. (Bossy) Gillis, "bad boy
mayor" of Newburyport, Mass., is
j en route to San Francisco tonight

The one-time service station oper
ator and sailor, who after becom
ing mayor of Newburyport. served
i part of his first term in the city
bastile for various infractions of
! Massachusetts law, placed himself
on the matrimonial market yester-
J day with the assertion, "it's a great,
break for some girl."
"I've made up my mind to marry
and, having heard go much about
! the beautiful girls in California, I
came out here to pick a wife." Gil
lis still was lying in bed in his
stateroom when he unfolded the
purpose for his westward voyage.
No Blondes Wanted
The mayor proved himself no
gentleman—at least by Anita Loos'

I standard in the next breath, how
ever: "Blondes won't do."
"Blondes? I'nder no eireuin
' stances. In the first place, it. is my
observation that, they are not good
housekeepers, and in addition they
| go to bridge teas," the mayor de
clared. "And no wite of mine is
going to be a bridge tea hound."
In further conversation Gillis
proved himself fair-minded within
the limitations he set: "I've de
cided to give all the brunettes and
redheads, who can qualify as good
lookers, an even chance."
Gillis said he would spend a
week in San Francisco, where he
will arrive tomorrow, looking over
the prospects there. As to Holly
wood, "I'm saving the girls there
for reserve."
The Newburyport mayor describ
ed his own qualification for the
wife-hunt as: "Aged 33, healthy as
they make them, and a darn fine
fellow."
