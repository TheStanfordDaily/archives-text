### 
WASHINGTON, I'd.. 24 (/P).â€”
( liarlfs Evans Hughes ascende.d to the
chief justiceship of the United States
today in an atmosphere in which there
was mingled gladness for his coming
and sadness for the serious illness of
his predecessor, William Howard
Taft.
A simple oath of office administered
in the dignified chamber of the court
made him the eleventh in the historic
succession of chief justice since John
Jay, in 1789. As was the first chief
justice, Mr. Hughes is from New
York.
Unperturbed by the realization that
he was about to reach the pinnacle
post of his distinguished career, he
entered the cozy room where the jus
tices put on their robes to sit on the
bench a few minutes before the usual
110011 meeting hour. There his asso
ciatcs greeted him warmly.
The group stood informally around
the table where they lunch each day
tin' court is in session, while the ve
nerable Justice < )liver Wendell Holmes"
administered the oath of allegiance to
the constitution. Mr! Holmes' voice
quavered slightly. Ile will be 89 years
old next mouth and is the oldest mem
ber of the court.
