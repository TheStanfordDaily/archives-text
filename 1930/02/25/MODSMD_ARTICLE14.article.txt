# HOOVER ASKS CURTAILING OF GOVERNMENT OUTLAY TO FORESTALL TAX RAISE
## Legislative Leaders at Breakfast Table Confronted by Mellon With Dwindling Treasury Fund; Hoover Will Not Enter Tariff Row 
### 
IIfASIJINGTON, Feb. 24. (A 3 ) —Attention of the tariff-troubled Repub- j
lican congressional leadership was directed by President Hoover j
today to the necessity of keeping government expenses down.
At breakfast in the White House, the President confronted his legis- i
lative chieftains with Secretary Mellon and the dwindling treasury j
balance, lie gave notice that there could be no more extra appropria- !
tions without a corresponding raise in taxes.
Summarizing bills now before Congress calling for additional govern
ment. outlays, the President warned that they would call for more than
$1,500,000,000 and would mean a 40 per cent increase next vear in taxes

He shut the door to all except
those involved in Hie business im
provement program.
Work Continues
So far as the Republican spokes
men at the Capitol are concerned,
they are going ahead working on
the tariff bill with the understand
ing that Mr. Hoover is going to
take no hand in the dispute over
rates. Speaker Longworth, who
was not in the city in time for the
breakfast, disclosed this after a
luncheon at the White House.
Longworth conceded after the
conference that perhaps the
House Republican tariff bill bad
gone beyond Hoover's recommenda
tions in some respects. But, he
said, in nearly 25 years' experi
ence in the House lie had found
that tariff hills always expanded
when they were being written.
"What the President is trying to
do," lie said, "is to restore himself
in the confidence of some of liis
Republican leaders. Congress never
bad the slightest thought of au
thorizing the appropriations out
lined in the White House state
ment. ,or doing anything that would
create a deficiency in the national
treasury."
Another Democrat of the Senate
appropriations committee, Senator
M.cKellar, of Tennessee, referred
to the conference"as "all poppy
cock."
"It is simply the setting up of a
straw man," said McKellar, "to be
knocked down. Hills for large ap
propriations are always introduced
but Congress doesn't appropriate
more than we can afford. It's an
attempted scare. It's all poppy
cock."

"What the President is trying to
do," lie said, "is to restore himself
in the confidence of some of liis
Republican leaders. Congress never

create a deficiency in the national
treasury."
Another Democrat of the Senate
appropriations committee, Senator
M.cKellar, of Tennessee, referred

cock."
"It is simply the setting up of a
straw man," said McKellar, "to be
knocked down. Hills for large ap
propriations are always introduced
but Congress doesn't appropriate
more than we can afford. It's an
attempted scare. It's all poppy
cock."
