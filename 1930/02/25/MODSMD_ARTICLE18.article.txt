# ANTI-RELIGIOUS RUSS ACTIVITY ROUSES BRITISH
## Prime Minister Expresses English Interest; Not Ready for Action Russian Recognition Does Not Affect Position 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 24. (A 3 )— Prime
Minister Mac Donald, in a letter
made public today, said the British
government was much concerned
about a<ntj-religious activities in
the Soviet I'nion but could not say
what it could do until it had all
the facts.
The letter, an answer to an un
named correspondent regarding re
ligious affairs in Russia, was made
public by the press department of
the Labor party.
It specified that news from Riga,
Latvia, should not be believed un
til corroborated and added that
many statements from that source
had been proved false.
"The history of religion in Rus
sia, however," the letter continues,
"is unfortunately full of records of
persecution. Persecution has never,
in one way or another, been absent
from Russian religious life, and
the revolutionary mentality which
generations of oppression have;
created has alPthe characteristics
of narrowness and violence of pur
pose."
The Prime Minister continues
that to his colleagues and himself
religious persecution is hateful, but
lie says that isn't, Ihe question at
issue. It is rather, "have we con
sidered what we can do?"
Diplomatic recognition of Rus
sia, said the Premier, was decided
purely on practical and political
grounds and without reference to
internal beliefs or policies. He add
ed that Russia had been recognized
for general good, however intri
cate and troublesome immediate
problems might be.
"To outlaw a country is not to
make it amenable to world opinion
but the opposite," be said. "Even
now you must see that the tone and
temper of the agitation are harden
ing rather than softening the heart
of the Russian government and
giving it the opportunity of per
suading its own people—however
erroneously—that this is all a part
of the conspiracy of other govern
ments to bring a war against the
Soviet government."
