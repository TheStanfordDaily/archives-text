# BASEBALL GAMES HANG FIRE UNTIL WEATHER CLEARS
## 
### 
Present weather conditions point
to another postponement in the
varsity baseball schedule. Coach
Marry Welter's diamond artists
have a game listed with the Saint
Mary's nine tomorrow afternoon,
but unless a blistering sun appears
to evaporate the swamps on the
Moraga and local diamonds, there
will be no game for the Red shirts
until the Santa Clara conflict on
Saturday.
The Saint ball park has been
completed only recently and al
though the contest is supposed to
bo played there, lack of a good
drainage system will probably
leave the Gael field in worse con
dition than the Stanford hall orch
ard. In that case the Cards will do
the entertaining, provided the var
sity diamond is playable.
No arrangements have been made
for the playoff of last Saturday's
scheduled Card-Gael ball game.
