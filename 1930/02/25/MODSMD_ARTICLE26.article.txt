Chautemps. new French premier, will
stake the life of his untried ministry
on a reform in budgctry methods, and
probably will retain almost without
alteration the naval policy of his
predecessor, Andre Tardieu.
I he statement of ministerial policy
was ready today in rough draft for
presentation to the cabinet council. At
3 p. m. tomorrow it will be read to
the chamber of deputies and a vote of
confidence asked on the strength of
its provisions.
There was some doubt to the
outcome of the poll on confidence in
j the new government was highly im
i probable, unless a great many oppos
ing deputies should abstain from vot
! ing. A more prevalent impression
seemed to be that ( hautcmps would
emerge from tomorrow's battle with
a slender majority of about twent>
votes as compared with 50 or 70 Tar
dieu usually was able to muster.
in his treatment of the budget
( hautcmps proposes to employ money
to be pa id by Germany to France to
balance the budget and reduce taxa
tion proportionally, t heron, minister
of finance in the Tardieu cabinet re
fused to do this, and on a trivial de
tail of policy, brought about the fall
of the entire cabinet.
The ministerial declaration said
to be comprehensive and clear touch
ing upon all the questions before par
liament. The discussion of foreign
policy particularly is lengthy, review
ing the work of the Hague rcpara
tions conference and the situation at
