# WHERE THE WINDS OF FREEDOM BLOW

/hi Power I'osl, thai mile-high colossus of tlie yellow journals,
printed, the other day. an interview with Stanford's Dean Mary
\ ost, who stopped in the ( olorado capital on .her way to the na
tional conference of deans of women in Atlantic ("its - , X. J.
Said Miss Yost : "You would he surprised if you knew how
often I serve as a balance wheel to prevent too nianv rules."
If we only knew! Surprises are so thrilling.
( ontinued Miss Yost: "In the time I have been there, no re
quest the women students have made has been denied."
I low true! Since Miss Yost has been at Stanford (and long
before she came, probably) the Stanford women have never made
a request that any church deacon would have denied. The Stanford
women just aren't built that way.
The great exception and the great triumph for the freedom of
the Five Hundred is, of course, the smoking privilege. Concern
ing this boon to womankind Miss Yost said: "Xow the girls who
wish may smoke in their rooms, just as do the men students. Prac
tically the same regulations apply to both groups."
Thank goodness-Denver knows that Stanford is progressive'!
Hut Denver should also be informed of other features of Stan
ford's super-system of handling its feminine contingent. There is
ilie lock-out, for instance. It is nice and progressive, too.
The fair Kobleites and the fair Kowites go to San Francisco.
They dance up there, and have the best time. Then at the witching
hour of 12:30 they embark on that breath taking ride to the Farm,
risking life and limb to save themselves from the most dreadful of
fates —the lockout. All girls who stay out after 1 :30 o'clock are
officially bad at Stanford, you know.
And wouldn't Denver—the I'osl in particular—be overwhelmed
if it knew the greatest boon to Stanford's women—five dollars and
Miss Yost's telephone number in every co-ed's hand bag?
In conclusion Miss Yost tells the waiting Denver public 111 is:
"We must develop initiative, the ability to stand alone, and a sense
of group responsibility."
Yes, Yes ! And again ves!
