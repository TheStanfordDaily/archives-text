# ORGANIZED POLITICAL DISCOURAGEMENT
## 
### 
Stanford's political maze will be brought out once again today
for the amusement of campus residents. As a means of entertain
ment, the present system of elections is perfect; but as a means of
accomplishing the purpose of selecting student officers, it is an un
qualified failure.
Last Tuesday's game of political mimicry will have to be re
peated for the third time. The revote which was supposed to finally
elect officers resulted in the announcement that a revote on the basis
of the previous revote would be necessary to determine the wishes of
ihe campus electorate. It seems obvious that anyone with even a
tendency toward rationality must come to the conclusion that the
method now employed is ready for a thoroughgoing revision.
Constitutionally organized as they arc at the present time, elec
tions seem to be nothing more than a series of political hurdles for
the candidates to surmount, and an attempt to discourage as demo
cratically as possible the mass of students from voting. ()f course
the system was not designed with these objects in view, but it is
evident, that the necessity of several revotes to elect a candidate
operates to discourage an increasing number of voters from going
to the polls.
In the proposed plans for constitutional revision suggested at
the first meeting of the revision committee was a contemplated
change to preferential voting. The desirability of some method of
securing the election of an officer at one balloting is becoming more
obvious as the plan in vogue continues to bungle along.
The adoption of preferential voting at the next general election
would at least please a considerable number of the student group,
unless a revote on the proposed change should be required. A com
mittee should be appointed immediately by the Executive Commit
tee to investigate ihe possibilities of the suggested overhauling and
a manipulation proof system offered to the students at the annual
Spring elections.
