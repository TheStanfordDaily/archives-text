HUMANITY UPROOTED. By Mau
rice Hindus. New York: Jona
than Cape and Harrison Smith,
1929. At Stanford Bookstore.
Maurice Hindus was born in Rus
sia, later came to America, and
then returned to his native land
with an open mind and discovered
there "Humanity Uprooted." in fact,
only an open mind can comprehend
Russia today. John Dewey says in
his introduction, "To read lliese
pages with sympathy is to travel
the road of a liberal education."
"Humanity Uprooted" describes
an experiment in modernity. Rus
sia, from a stage considerably be
hind Western civilization, has
thrown herself into the air, turned
topsy-turvy, and landed gasping,
exulting, far ahead of contempor
| ary intellectual orthodoxy. The
| very primitiveness of Old Russia,
i making her simple, deep, and not
up to the intricacies of modern
times, has been the foundation of
j a. piercing analysis which lias
brought fundamentals to the fore
i and laid hare the poison of un
i thinking conformity. Russia is
jStartllngly modern, even to the
: youth of America with Bohemia
i leanings. "The so-called revolt of
! the younger generation in America
; and in Europe is a good-humored
| caprice, almost a childish jest,"
! the author tells us, compared to the
; passionate defiance of Russian
! youth. Religion is thrown aside, of
j ficially denied. Private property,
! and the whole instinct of personal
! aggrandizement, have been tram
; pled—may be completely stamped
out. Woman is jerked from degra
; dation and set up very nearly as
man's equal in every respect. Mar
riage seems on the way to be abol
j ished, and even now has been let
i down to a place subordinate to na
tural love and revocable choice.
! And tlie family—that; most stable
pillar among World institutions
i is itself shaking and no longer con
! sidered impregnable to Change.
We are left with a deep sym
pathy for the Russian people if
not for their cause —world revolu
i tion. We carry away a horror of
tradition, a respect for revolt, an.l
vivid impressions of a book excel
lently written afid thoughtful
I enough to go from its immediate
! subject—a nation of people —into
the universal realm of social philo
! Sophy. —F. T.

( At last we can welcome a really
finished production of a musical

comedy in colored talkies —"Sally."
Some pictures this year have had
Rood singing, some good dancing,
ethers unusual ensembles and
choruses. But "Sally" is a combina
tion of all these things good enough
to run lor weeks and weeks in San
Francisco and elsewhere.
There is Marilyn Miller, Joe E.
Brown, and Alexander Gray; with
this cast no picture could go
wrong. Marilyn Miller is a new
kind of "it" girl—she has "these,
them, and those"; at dancing, sing
ing, acting, or jus! looking wonder
-1 ul, it is all one to her.
Alexander Gray has a fine voice,
unusually good. Biit Stanford
theatregoers will probably like him
for another reason . . . because,
although the hero, with lots of
dinero and all that goes with it,
he is not too darn good-looking. He
is pleasant, but not the usual chis
eled perfection.
As for Joe E. Brown, anyone who
has once seen him knows what he
is like, and will probably be caught
going to "Sally" before long, just
to see Brown again. —W. 11. (J.
STREET OF CHANCE—At The
Varsity Theatre.
This Arnold Rotlistein inspired
crime picture is distinctly super
ior. (Jumbling, the cream of human
l'oihles, is its theme.
The story pleasantly reiterates
what everybody knows. The most
fascinating sport, in the world
doesn't pay. No it, doesn't. Not
eveh when the men's council
doesn't find you out. Why, before
you know it, you do such thought
less things as to leave the wife
alone for a few minutes while you
go out and phone your mother. And
the little woman doesn't see you
again for three days.
And then your brother who lives
in the sticks, say San Francisco,
(uraes to the Street of Chance with
two lady companions, his wife and
Lady Luck. Like other little broth
ers he won't listen to reason, and
in the end cleans you and your
underworld cronies until it is
necessary to raise the price of
Scotch in Detroit. A lead slug in
your stomach will cancel your
debts. Your friends will provide the
lead slug.
William Powell has the lead and
gives a creditable performance,
which means nothing of course.
Kay Francis, the best-dressed wo
man in America, is more attractive
but less-competent than ever. May
be there is a moral in that too.

The story pleasantly reiterates
what everybody knows. The most

eveh when the men's council
doesn't find you out. Why, before
you know it, you do such thought
less things as to leave the wife
alone for a few minutes while you
go out and phone your mother. And
the little woman doesn't see you
again for three days.
And then your brother who lives
in the sticks, say San Francisco,
(uraes to the Street of Chance with
two lady companions, his wife and
Lady Luck. Like other little broth
ers he won't listen to reason, and
in the end cleans you and your
underworld cronies until it is
necessary to raise the price of
Scotch in Detroit. A lead slug in
your stomach will cancel your
debts. Your friends will provide the
lead slug.
William Powell has the lead and
gives a creditable performance,

HUMANITY UPROOTED. By Mau

Maurice Hindus was born in Rus
sia, later came to America, and
then returned to his native land
with an open mind and discovered
there "Humanity Uprooted." in fact,
only an open mind can comprehend
Russia today. John Dewey says in
his introduction, "To read lliese
pages with sympathy is to travel
the road of a liberal education."
"Humanity Uprooted" describes
an experiment in modernity. Rus
sia, from a stage considerably be
hind Western civilization, has
thrown herself into the air, turned
topsy-turvy, and landed gasping,
exulting, far ahead of contempor
| ary intellectual orthodoxy. The
| very primitiveness of Old Russia,
i making her simple, deep, and not
up to the intricacies of modern
times, has been the foundation of
j a. piercing analysis which lias
brought fundamentals to the fore
i and laid hare the poison of un
i thinking conformity. Russia is
jStartllngly modern, even to the
: youth of America with Bohemia
i leanings. "The so-called revolt of

choruses. But "Sally" is a combina
tion of all these things good enough
to run lor weeks and weeks in San
Francisco and elsewhere.
There is Marilyn Miller, Joe E.
Brown, and Alexander Gray; with
this cast no picture could go
wrong. Marilyn Miller is a new
kind of "it" girl—she has "these,
them, and those"; at dancing, sing
ing, acting, or jus! looking wonder
-1 ul, it is all one to her.
Alexander Gray has a fine voice,
unusually good. Biit Stanford
theatregoers will probably like him
for another reason . . . because,
although the hero, with lots of
dinero and all that goes with it,
he is not too darn good-looking. He
is pleasant, but not the usual chis
eled perfection.
As for Joe E. Brown, anyone who
has once seen him knows what he
is like, and will probably be caught
going to "Sally" before long, just
to see Brown again. —W. 11. (J.
STREET OF CHANCE—At The
Varsity Theatre.
This Arnold Rotlistein inspired
crime picture is distinctly super
ior. (Jumbling, the cream of human
l'oihles, is its theme.
The story pleasantly reiterates
what everybody knows. The most
fascinating sport, in the world
doesn't pay. No it, doesn't. Not
eveh when the men's council
doesn't find you out. Why, before
you know it, you do such thought
less things as to leave the wife
alone for a few minutes while you
go out and phone your mother. And
the little woman doesn't see you
again for three days.
And then your brother who lives
in the sticks, say San Francisco,
(uraes to the Street of Chance with
two lady companions, his wife and
Lady Luck. Like other little broth
ers he won't listen to reason, and
in the end cleans you and your
underworld cronies until it is
necessary to raise the price of
Scotch in Detroit. A lead slug in
your stomach will cancel your
debts. Your friends will provide the
lead slug.
William Powell has the lead and
gives a creditable performance,
which means nothing of course.
Kay Francis, the best-dressed wo
man in America, is more attractive
but less-competent than ever. May
be there is a moral in that too.

HUMANITY UPROOTED. By Mau
rice Hindus. New York: Jona
than Cape and Harrison Smith,
1929. At Stanford Bookstore.
Maurice Hindus was born in Rus
sia, later came to America, and
then returned to his native land
with an open mind and discovered
there "Humanity Uprooted." in fact,
only an open mind can comprehend
Russia today. John Dewey says in
his introduction, "To read lliese
pages with sympathy is to travel
the road of a liberal education."
"Humanity Uprooted" describes
an experiment in modernity. Rus
sia, from a stage considerably be
hind Western civilization, has
thrown herself into the air, turned
topsy-turvy, and landed gasping,
exulting, far ahead of contempor
| ary intellectual orthodoxy. The
| very primitiveness of Old Russia,
i making her simple, deep, and not
up to the intricacies of modern
times, has been the foundation of
j a. piercing analysis which lias
brought fundamentals to the fore
i and laid hare the poison of un
i thinking conformity. Russia is
jStartllngly modern, even to the
: youth of America with Bohemia
i leanings. "The so-called revolt of
! the younger generation in America
; and in Europe is a good-humored
| caprice, almost a childish jest,"
! the author tells us, compared to the
; passionate defiance of Russian
! youth. Religion is thrown aside, of
j ficially denied. Private property,
! and the whole instinct of personal
! aggrandizement, have been tram
; pled—may be completely stamped
out. Woman is jerked from degra
; dation and set up very nearly as
man's equal in every respect. Mar
riage seems on the way to be abol
j ished, and even now has been let
i down to a place subordinate to na
tural love and revocable choice.
! And tlie family—that; most stable
pillar among World institutions
i is itself shaking and no longer con
! sidered impregnable to Change.
We are left with a deep sym
pathy for the Russian people if
not for their cause —world revolu
i tion. We carry away a horror of
tradition, a respect for revolt, an.l
vivid impressions of a book excel
lently written afid thoughtful
I enough to go from its immediate
! subject—a nation of people —into
the universal realm of social philo
! Sophy. —F. T.
