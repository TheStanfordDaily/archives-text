# "TREAT AN EX CHEATER THE SAM AS A CARD CHEATER," SAYS PROFESSOR BROWN

### BY RAWSON HOLMES 
77lis is the second of a series of opinions on the proposed amendment lo ■
\ the Honor Code which will establish a system of optional proctors, by those \
\ men who are best able to comprehend the situation, namely professors who j
I have Uinje classes.

There are only two methods of
handling the examination problem,
in the opinion of Harold Chapman
Brown, Professor of Philosophy, as
expressed to a Daily reporter re-
I cently, when questioned on the
'proposed amendment to the Honor
Code; an absolute proctor system
or a pure 1 lonor ('ode.
"There should be no intermedi
ate route," Brown stated. "Wo
1 should elthec- keep to the present
j honor system and build up a strong
feeling against cheating among the
I students, or turn to a method simi
lar to ihe complete proctor type,
as used at the University of Colum
bia, with proctors who are neither
faculty members nor students,
j strictly policing all examinations.
! The latter would be terrible."
In order to make the present sys
tem carry more weight, Professor
Brown suggested that a "gentle
manly code" might be built up
j among the students, bv which any
one seen cheating at an examina
' tion would be treated hv his friends
as an outcast.
"1 can seo no difference between
the man who cheats at an examina-
I tion and the man who cheats at
golf or cards," lie continued. "When
we find a man tricking us at a
game of cards we do not play with
him again. If students were to treat
I anyone who used underhand meth
ods at an examination in the sattle
manner, there would soon be no
cheating.
"Tin 1 Honor Code will never be
enforced by expecting students to
i report violations to the faculty,"

for not doing so. However the same j
result would he obtained by a
' common feeling against violators j
on 1 lie part of the students. Per- j
haps tiiis feeling might be ex- I
pressed by the various living ;
groups and fraternities taking
away,certain privileges from the}
offenders."
