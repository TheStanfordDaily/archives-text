Well, it's been a long time. Per
sonally, we wish it were longer.
We don't HAVE to dish up this
stuff for youse mugs, and don't you
forget it, either.
Ii jusl began to look like there
never WOULD be another CAB
BAGE column. At least we thought
so. Who'd have guessed that, the
editor would have raked up that
old story about us?
Anyhow, there's not a word of
truth in it, and besides . . .
on, ALL RIGHT, WE'LL WRITE
YOUR "GOLDARN" COLUMN.
We confess that the urge to
come back was strong last quarter,
when they had that. Monster School
Spirit Rally at. the Engineering
Corner ('member, fellers?). But.
somebody else "boosted" this as
well as we ever could have done.
And the leash began to chafe
when the Executive Committee
killed the carefully planned new
magazine of Comment, Contribu
tion, and Controversy but sot, en
thusiastically behind the drive for
relief of the students of Bulgaria.
(It. seems they haven't got :t
Union building in Bulgaria . . .
Well, then they haven't got a Cel
lar. Every rose has its thorn.)
So now that the Election Com
mittee has gone and done il again,
and the erstwhile local stage lias
gone in for fairy stories, and the
"promising" basketball team has
taken seven or eight on the but
ton . . .
WELL, HERE WE ARE.
Don't say we didn't warn you.
But you asked for it.
. . . Just, like the ancient llsher
man who rubbed the stone jug and
made a wish. He got a (l/ j nii, it
seems, but after awhile lie wished
to hell he'd kept his hands in his
pockets.
All right, now, let's cut out all
this fooling, fellas.
Let's be funny, fflo on, be
funny!)
. . . AW, SOME OTHER DAY.
