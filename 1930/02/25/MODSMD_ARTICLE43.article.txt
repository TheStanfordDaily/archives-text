# ALUMNI CLUBS PLAN TO RALLY TOGETHER ON FOUNDERS' DAY
## 
### 
Ahuouneements of Founders' Day
programs which are being planned
by Stanford Alumni Clubs through
out the country are being received
daily at the office of John E. Mc-
Dowell, alumni secretary. McDow
ell has accepted invitations to he
the guest speaker at three clubs in
the Pacific Northwest. On March 8
he will be with the Portland club,
on March 10 he will be in Spokane,
and on March 12 he will address
the Seattle "association.
Founders' Day falls on Sunday,
March i), this year, arid most of the
programs are being held on or near
that day. Besides those clubs which
are having formal programs, there
are numerous places where there
are no alumni associations, where
Stanford men and women will
merely get together in friendly
groups, and talk over old times. It.
is this type of celebration which
is particularly in keeping with the
spirit of the day, and which thÂ°
Alumni Secretary's office seeks K>
further.
The San Francisco club is hold
ing a luncheon at the Palace Hotel
on March 4. when Dr. Alonzo E.
Taylor of Stanford University, and
Hugh Brown, '96, will speak.
