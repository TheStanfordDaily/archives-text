# THAT "DINK" AND HIS GANG MAY LAUGH

(Daily Northwestern Editorial)

A conspicuous news story in the
i Ohio State Lantern, official student
newspaper of Ohio State liniver-
I sity, throws light on the state of
! morals jind standards at that en-
I lightened institution of learniug.
A so-called Purity League has
! been formed by about thirty mem
| hers of the track squad, headed by
I Frank I), llays, star track perform
j er. Among its other officers is
Joseph A. Ujhelyi, football star,
and Gborge S. Simpson, nationally
known sprinter. Its purpose is to
eradicate "the folly of bad lan
guage" among members of the
track squad in the dressing room
and on the field. The society does
not believe that track men should
cuss as they work out any more
than they should when thoy are
home eating dinner Willi their
mothers.
At the quadrangle track meet
held here in Rvanston last Satur
i day, George Simpson was head of a

| special committee to enforce the
bo-swearing rule on the trip. We
* do not know, of course, how suc
cessful lie was, but we venture to
say that when Zack Ford beat him
|a couple of times in the forty-yard
j dash he came close to abandoning
his no-cussing crusade.
In all seriousness, however, there
I is a lot to be said tor a policy of
i moderation in swearing, as in all
; other things! Very frequently when
j college men get together there is
I much unnecessary cussing much
that is neither colorful nor a con
! tributioh to the subject of discus
sion at the moment. It is our be
| lief that if a man can cuss effec
tively, if there is something to be
gained by it, sitcli practice is justi
! fied. But on no other grounds is it
! just I fled.
