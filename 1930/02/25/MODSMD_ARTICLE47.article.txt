SPEAKING OF MINOR SPORTS
Now that California lias adminis
tered its yearly hardwood drub
bings to the Farm hardwood actors
and tin; last ball has swished
through the Pavilion nets I'or the
year 19150 A.1)., the honest sports
loving tuition payers about these
parts have already turned their
attentions, between divot-digging,
to the cinder path, ball park, ten
nis court, aquatic pool, and other
springtime athletic arenas.
The hard, long, cold, lean
winter is over!
Which was muchly so, as
far as sporting pastimes cn the
campus is concerned. The
spring days may be long, but
they cannot possibly be so
lean.
Vet, although the cage para
phernalia is already tucked
away betwixt mothballs, most
harassing memories of the hoop
season just ended linger on.
In fact, said reminiscences are
of the rankling, griping sort.
Not that the campus citizens give
a rap because their varsity cagers
failed to startle the nation witll
unbeatable exhibitions. Hut the
fact that Stanford l r . once again
•graces the Conference cellar is
unexpectedly obnoxious.
The honest gentry agree that, a
team is likely to have an off season
now and then, and thai its basket
looping representatives might,
through tough breaks, happen to
score only 5G2 points to I heir op
ponents' 575 and drop 7 out of !l
conference court battles.
But they likewise calculate
that such happenings formulate
a very, very bad habit, when
allowed to continue in the
same general direction year in
and year out. Especially, with
material as promising as that
on the Farm.
For although Ihe Cards of 1030
failed to function smoothly as a
unit, they individually came
through with some outstanding
performance*.
Among Hie best was Red Berg,
smallest man on the squad. Red
was without doubt the most con
sistent, as well, and turned in a
flashy exhibition 'of ball-hawking
during every game of the cold
spell, both in the matter of floor
work and timely basket-connecting.
Caddy Works, head U.C.L.A.
mentor, was high in his praise
of the übiquitous redhead,
when the Bruins invaded the
Farm three weeks ago. singling
Berg out as the classiest player
on the floor.
Paired with "the Grange of the
hardwood" was Don Tyler, dyna
mic forward. Tyler arid Berg were
ihe "spark plugs" of the Red Ma
chine, and whenever t hey were out
of ihe lineup, said machine began
to miss most hopelessly.
Then there was Vance Fawcett,
heralded last winter as a sure all
roast prospect; Long John Mc-
Candless, tap-in artist and high
scorer of (lie season; Mike Rey
nolds and Harlow Rothert, as good
a defensive combination as any on
ihe coast; Bud Hawkins and Milt
Rowley; and a horde of others.
It is no wonder Nibs Price
told the DAILY reporter that,
before the 1930 season got un
der way, he thought Stanford
was certain to clean up!
As 'someone articulated the
other day: "Since basketball
on the Farm is degenerating
into a minor sport, it would be
wise and profitable if the
B.A.C. converted the Pavilion
into an ice-hockey rink during
the winter months, replacing
the hardwood with slabs of
frozen water. Then, perhaps,
the students would take some
interest in winter athletic
events."
At any rate, spring is at hand
and the campus citizens are
showing signs of life once
more.

Paired with "the Grange of the
hardwood" was Don Tyler, dyna
mic forward. Tyler arid Berg were
ihe "spark plugs" of the Red Ma
chine, and whenever t hey were out
of ihe lineup, said machine began
to miss most hopelessly.
Then there was Vance Fawcett,
heralded last winter as a sure all
roast prospect; Long John Mc-
Candless, tap-in artist and high
scorer of (lie season; Mike Rey
nolds and Harlow Rothert, as good
a defensive combination as any on
ihe coast; Bud Hawkins and Milt
Rowley; and a horde of others.
It is no wonder Nibs Price
told the DAILY reporter that,
before the 1930 season got un
der way, he thought Stanford
was certain to clean up!
As 'someone articulated the
other day: "Since basketball
on the Farm is degenerating
into a minor sport, it would be
wise and profitable if the
B.A.C. converted the Pavilion
into an ice-hockey rink during
the winter months, replacing
the hardwood with slabs of
frozen water. Then, perhaps,
the students would take some
interest in winter athletic
events."
At any rate, spring is at hand
and the campus citizens are
showing signs of life once
more.

SPEAKING OF MINOR SPORTS
Now that California lias adminis
tered its yearly hardwood drub
bings to the Farm hardwood actors
and tin; last ball has swished
through the Pavilion nets I'or the
year 19150 A.1)., the honest sports
loving tuition payers about these
parts have already turned their
attentions, between divot-digging,
to the cinder path, ball park, ten
nis court, aquatic pool, and other
springtime athletic arenas.
The hard, long, cold, lean
winter is over!
Which was muchly so, as
far as sporting pastimes cn the
campus is concerned. The
spring days may be long, but
they cannot possibly be so
lean.
Vet, although the cage para
phernalia is already tucked
away betwixt mothballs, most
harassing memories of the hoop
season just ended linger on.
In fact, said reminiscences are
of the rankling, griping sort.
Not that the campus citizens give
a rap because their varsity cagers
failed to startle the nation witll
unbeatable exhibitions. Hut the
fact that Stanford l r . once again
•graces the Conference cellar is
unexpectedly obnoxious.
The honest gentry agree that, a
team is likely to have an off season
now and then, and thai its basket
looping representatives might,
through tough breaks, happen to
score only 5G2 points to I heir op
ponents' 575 and drop 7 out of !l
conference court battles.
But they likewise calculate
that such happenings formulate
a very, very bad habit, when
allowed to continue in the
same general direction year in
and year out. Especially, with
material as promising as that
on the Farm.
For although Ihe Cards of 1030
failed to function smoothly as a
unit, they individually came
through with some outstanding
performance*.
Among Hie best was Red Berg,
smallest man on the squad. Red
was without doubt the most con
sistent, as well, and turned in a
flashy exhibition 'of ball-hawking
during every game of the cold
spell, both in the matter of floor
work and timely basket-connecting.
Caddy Works, head U.C.L.A.
mentor, was high in his praise
of the übiquitous redhead,
when the Bruins invaded the
Farm three weeks ago. singling
Berg out as the classiest player
on the floor.
