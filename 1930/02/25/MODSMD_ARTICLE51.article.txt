# TARS OF THE RING
## Tom Sharkey Was the Nearest to Championship; Jack Has Only Two Men to Whip for Title 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Two Sharkeys, both sailors —I
Tom and Jack! The Old-Timer and !
the Modern, the rough, tough old '
battler who fought 'em all and for;
very, little money, and the young \
gladiator of this day and age who
fights maybe twice a year, and i
never for less than a guarantee off
$100,000!
These modern purses would have j
seemed like a dream to old Tom j
Sharkey. Why, I doubt if he was j
paid $100,000 for all of his fights
put together, and he battled four !
world's champions, Sullivan, Cov- |
bett, Pitzsimmons, and Jeffries ]
(the last three each twice), and j
also met such tough hombres as j
Joe Choyinski three times, Peter I
Maher twice, and Gus Ruhlin three :
times, not to mention Tommy j
Ryan (in an exhibition) and Joel
Goddard and Jack Monroe. The 1
Jeffries-Sharkey return fight of 25 j
rounds at Coney Island in 18911. ,
which the sailor came so close to]

| winning, was one of live ring j
! classics of the aiges. The stout- j
! hearted tar, over whom Jeffries i
j
; towered like a big grizly hear, had
J three ribs broken in that contest, I
i but forced the fight every bit of I
I the way. He only stood JUSy> and j
fwas the nearest "near-champion"
in the history of the ring.
Jack Sharkey, a former sailor
i like Tom, but Lithuanian instead
I of Irish, stands a fine chance of j
accomplishing what Tom failed to I
I do; i.e., win the world's heavy- j
I weight title. All Jack has to do is j
| to heat Falling Phil Scott at Miami,
j then defeat Max Schmeling this I
i summer, and the title is his. But
! then, that may not he so easy, at j
i that. Jack has met all the best i
I heavies of the time except the two ;
I just mentioned, and Tunriey and
! Paulino. Did I hear someone with!
ja fine Italian accent, suggest that j
i maybe Primo Camera will heat I
j Jack to that title?

i maybe Primo Camera will heat I
j Jack to that title?

Two Sharkeys, both sailors —I
Tom and Jack! The Old-Timer and !
the Modern, the rough, tough old '
battler who fought 'em all and for;
very, little money, and the young \
gladiator of this day and age who
fights maybe twice a year, and i
never for less than a guarantee off
$100,000!
These modern purses would have j
seemed like a dream to old Tom j
Sharkey. Why, I doubt if he was j
paid $100,000 for all of his fights
put together, and he battled four !
world's champions, Sullivan, Cov- |
bett, Pitzsimmons, and Jeffries ]
(the last three each twice), and j
also met such tough hombres as j
Joe Choyinski three times, Peter I
Maher twice, and Gus Ruhlin three :
times, not to mention Tommy j
Ryan (in an exhibition) and Joel
Goddard and Jack Monroe. The 1
Jeffries-Sharkey return fight of 25 j
rounds at Coney Island in 18911. ,
which the sailor came so close to]

| winning, was one of live ring j
! classics of the aiges. The stout- j
! hearted tar, over whom Jeffries i
j
; towered like a big grizly hear, had
J three ribs broken in that contest, I
i but forced the fight every bit of I
I the way. He only stood JUSy> and j
fwas the nearest "near-champion"
in the history of the ring.
Jack Sharkey, a former sailor
i like Tom, but Lithuanian instead
I of Irish, stands a fine chance of j
accomplishing what Tom failed to I
I do; i.e., win the world's heavy- j
I weight title. All Jack has to do is j
| to heat Falling Phil Scott at Miami,
j then defeat Max Schmeling this I
i summer, and the title is his. But
! then, that may not he so easy, at j
i that. Jack has met all the best i
I heavies of the time except the two ;
I just mentioned, and Tunriey and
! Paulino. Did I hear someone with!
ja fine Italian accent, suggest that j
i maybe Primo Camera will heat I
j Jack to that title?
