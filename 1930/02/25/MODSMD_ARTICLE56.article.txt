## Norm Horner, Last Year Pitching Hash, Is Big Prospect

I
(Special to The Daily)
BERKELEY, Feb. 24â€”Aided by
I a new baseball diamond on South
j west Field, Coach Clint Evans lias
i started whipping the California
i baseball team into an outfit that
| looms as one of the most formida
i ble college nines on the Pacific
i Coast.
j Perhaps the most scintillating
; prospect on the entire California
[roster is a .pitcher, Norm Horner,
I who startled diamond circles iih a
| sophomore last year, with his liigli
i class twirling. Horner achieved the
j brilliant record of eight victories,
j one tie, and no defeats, and with
I the added experience gained,
j should be a hard man to heat liiis
j year.
Burgett Bats .513
In addition to Horner, Bill Bur
! gelt, an outfielder, is another good
looking prospect. Burgett clouted
| the apple for an average of .513
j last season, including a large num
\ her of extra-base blows, and should
be almost as good this year. Al
most as good, because a record of
over .500 in batting is almost im
possible to maintain in any league.
1 The other pastimers who are
I back for more competition are
J Captain Lee Valianos, shortstop;
Harry Butler, hard-hitting third
baseman; Harold "Doc" Swenson,
being groomed to fill in at second
i base; and Marshall Ricksen, an
other hard-hitting outfielder who
I got his first collegiate experience
I last season.
New Men Good
From the freshman squad, sev
| eral promising men have graduated
to the varsity, including Joe
i Schmidt, catcher; Ed Kirwan, an
! outfielder, perhaps better known
! as Lee Eisan's understudy on the
football team; Henry Glaister, a
j third-baseman, and Theodore Nix,
| a pitcher.
I Six men were lr >st from last.
! year's varsity, with the list led by
! Robert Stevenson, who has signed
| with the Oakland Club of the
| Pacific Coast League. The other
| regulars who were lost are Charlie
I Schmidt and Earl Jacobsen, both
pitchers; Walt Wyatt, catcher;
Claude Wilson, outfielder; and Mel
Devore, second-baseman.
