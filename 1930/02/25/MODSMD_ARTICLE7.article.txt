# DYED COAL, CORN-TASSEL SILK, ILLUSTRATE CHEMISTRY LECTURE
## 
### 
Everything from hub-cap,s to
artificial Hi Ik made up the exhibi
tion which Dr. 11. E. Howe, editor
of the Journal of industrial and
Engineering Chemistry, look out of
a little black bag to illustrate his
lecture on "Chemistry in the New
Competition" at the Chemistry
Duilding yesterday afternoon.
"An example of the 'new compe
tition'," Dr. Howe said, "lies in
trademarking coal by dyeing it an
ultra-marine bine to distinguish it
from the brands of competitors.
The color is inexpensive and does
not impair the qualities of the fuel.
Another example is in the manufac
ture of artificial silk from different
substances such as corn-stalks, flax,
wheat-straw, and even wood."
The hub-cap that he showed was
coaled with a layer of chromium,
the hardest metal known, three
milllonths of an inch thick. "Re
sides being durable, chromium
takes a coat of paint better than
any other metal. Hence it is espe

cially valuable for trimming and
finishing automobiles," lie con- j
tinued.
Other articles whose roinposi- I
tion is synthetic and of otherwise I
useless waste materials, which lie j
exhibited, were rubber, lumber, ;
sugar, artificial alcohol, buttons.!
and cellophane. "Cellophane is the !
trade name of a transparent ma j
ierial which, dyed various colors, j
is rapidly supplanting paper as a
wrapper. More than . r >o miles of!
this is converted daily into cover
ing for American 'hot dogs'."
The lecturer stressed the fact i
that "the competitive work going j
on in industrial chemistry by net- i
ting the public to take up one thing !
is paving the way for further pro-|
duction of new things from old ma- j
terials."
Dr. Howe is oil a lecture tour
which has carried him through
most of the western states; he will ,
soon return to his home in Wash
ington, D.C., by way of Arizona,
Texas, and Missouri.
