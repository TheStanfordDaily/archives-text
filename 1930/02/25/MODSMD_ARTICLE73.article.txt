# STANFORD ROUGH GOES FOR CANDY; NEGLECTS TEETH
## 
### 
That the Stanford student spends
: between two and three dollars a
'year on candy at the Union Store j
! and consumes from fifty to sixty
' five-cent candy bars was brought
! to light yesterday when a Daily re-1
porter investigated the list of sales
made out by W. it. Gunther, man
ager of the store. This list is for a !
period of twelve months, and there- j
â€¢ fore includes the summer quarter j
registration.
The craving for candy on the j
i Farm exceeds that for any other
commodity sold at the store. Dur
j ing the past year 190,500 bars have
been sold. Chewing-gum rates next
j in popularity, with 219,500 sticks
; sold in a year. This would allow
! each student about sixty sticks.
Ice-cream cones do not enjoy the i
favor of candy and chewing-gum, j
as only 75,000 per year are pur-1
chased in the Cellar. However, of!
the items noted, the most unpopu-!
lar seem to be the tooth-brushes;
and dental cream. According to j
Mr. Gunther's record, 20G4 tooth-j
brushes and 3192 tubes of dental j
cream were sold.
