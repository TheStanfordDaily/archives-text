# WARREN ALLEN WILL GIVE THIRD LECTURE OF SERIES TONIGHT
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, will give the third of a
series of lectures on "The Elements
of Music" tonight at 7:30 in the
Little Theatre. His topic will be
"Melody as the Historical Basis of
Harmony and the Development of
Both in the Early Church."
Allen will discuss the influence
of the Hebrew, Greek, and Roman
in the early Christian music, and
melody as a communal privilege in
the early church. Believing that
the effect of religious folk-songs
on musical art accounts in part for
the music of today, he will outline
the development of liturgy, rites,
and ceremony, and discuss the
adaptability of the plain chant for
prose texts, their mystic spiritual
character and rhythmic freedom.
The points of the lecture will be
illustrated by appropriate songs,
given by Siernon Muller and Lewis
Newbauer, tenors; and Waldo Fer
gason and Charles Weesner,, basses.
Among the selections will be "Kvrie
Eleison," "Ave Maria Stella," and
"Adoramus Te."
This lecture is a continuation of
the two given last quarter on the
composition, purpose, and elements
of melody. The series has been
planned by the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises for the purpose of giv
ing those who are interested in
music an opportunity to learn some
of its characteristics, since Stan
ford has no musical department.
