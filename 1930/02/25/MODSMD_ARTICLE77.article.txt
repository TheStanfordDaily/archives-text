# SIGRID ONEGIN LIKES HER COFFEE BLACK, AND "HOT AS HELL"
## 
### 
"If you want to know my one
crowning vice," says Sigrid One
gin, contralto who is to appear at
the Stanford Pavilion Saturday
night at 8:15, on the fourth of the
student concert series program,
"it's coffee.
"I must have my two cups every
morning. I take it very black. As
the saying goes, 'Noir comme le
(liable, doux comme l'amour, et
chaud comme renter.' That means,
'Lllack as the devil, sweet as love,
and hot as hell.'
"And to think at one time coffee
drinking was considered on a par
with drunkenness or any other dis
solute pastime! You remember jn
Bach's Kaffee Cantata how the
soprano sings. 'Oh, how sweet the
coffee tastes?' Poor girl! I would
have rebelled, too, if rny father had
forbidden me to drink coffee.
"No, I don't believe in prohibit
ing people from doing things. It is
going about the matter in the
wrong way, psychologically. That
is why I think tiie father in Bach's
Cantata would have been much
wiser had he stood by his daughter
with a two-gallon pot of coffee and
told her she must drink every drop.
But then we should never have
had a Kaffee Cantata by Bach,
should we?"
Described us tall, dark, with a
(â€¢harming dignity of manner, Mine.
Oncgin says she loves out-of-door
sports, especially golf and swim
ming. Although admiring the inde
pendence of modern women, she
as an individual does not smoke. .
Tickets for her concert on Satur
day night are on sale at the
A.S.S.IT. office of the Old Union
and at Dodson's in Palo Alto for
$1, $1.50, and $2.
