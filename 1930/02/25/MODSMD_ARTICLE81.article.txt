# INTERCLASS BASEBALL SCHEDULE POSTPONED
## 
### 
Owing to the heavy rainfall
which made play almost impossible,
the scheduled interclass baseball
game between the sophomore and
junior nines which was to have
been played yesterday afternoon
was postponed to March 7 by
Coach Murray Cuddeback.
If the rain does not continue too
long the freshmen and juniors will
cross bats with each other Thurs
day afternoon.
