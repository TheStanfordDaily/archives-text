## Plea of Premier Chautemps For Naval Delegation Ignored by Opposition Tardieu's Chances Appear Quite Excellent as Briand Scorns Appointment 
### 
PARIS, Feb, 2;". (A') â€”France's!
new left-wing government met de
feat. today at its first appearance
before the Chamber of Deputies
amid a bitter attack from the oppo- j
sit ion.
Premier Camille Chautemps, de-I
spite iiis pleas that it was import- i
ant for France to send a delega- j
t ion back to the London Naval I
Conference quickly, was beaten on
the crucial vote of confidence by a |
margin of 12 votes, 289 to 277. J
For the third lime in the history j

of the third j
republic, the
chamber re
fused to give
the incoming
ministry a
chance and, |
after cheer- !
in K' former |
Premier Tar- !
dieu on his |
entrance, I
t. a un ted
Chan temps |
for having j
caused tli e
downfall of
his predeees- I

sor in order to "give the radical- |
socialist party a chance to get gov-!
ernmental portfolios."
Tardieu or Briand?
The general opinion in Paris to- j
night was that Andre Tardieu or
Aristide Briand would be called by j
President Doumergue to form a j
new government.
Briand, however, already has j
made known his disinclination to
accept the premiership in any gov
ernment, though willing to take ]
the post of minister of foreign af- j
fairs.
Former Premier Tardieu there-1
fore appears to have an excellent j
chance of going back as premier |
before the chamber that defeated I
liim by live votes a week ago.
The voting took place amid great I
excitement, both inside and out
side the Palais-Bourbon where the j
chamber sits.
The entire center and the right I
remained solidly behind former j
Premier Tardieu, who yesterday j
persuaded his group of l>4 deputies |
not to give their confidence to the ;
new government.
Acrid Discussion
The tone of discussion was acrid j
in the chamber. When Chautemps j
asked for support in order to send j
a French delegation back to Lon-|
don, the opposition shouted him
down will) the retort, "What about !
Tardieu? lie was there before you
stabbed him in the back." The j
Chautemps cabinet was one of the j
shortest-lived in French parliament
ary history, lasting only five days, j


Briand
