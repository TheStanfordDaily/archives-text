BUIONOS All! IOS, Feb. 2f>. (/P) —
There arc; fourteen girls of mar
riageable age on the lonely South
Atlantic Island, Tristan da (Tinha,
which is ho far removed from the
rest of the world tluit a ship conies
but once a year.
There are 21 young men of mar
riageable age from wliicih those
fourteen girls may i>i<-k husbands.
Those not. chosen, through neces
sity, probably will remain bache
lors, since few ever leave the
island, and few come there to live.
157 On Island
Rev. Philip Lindsay, who has
just, come here from three years
spent in mission work on the
island, and whose mot Inn* lives at
St. Albans, Vt„ says lt>7 inhabit
ants live on Tristan da Chunha
with almost unbelievable sinipli
< ity.
They still dress after the early
Victorian manner, and doubt, the
existence of airplanes and automo
biles, of which he has told them.
They cannot even understand how
men can ride bicycles, the like of
which they have never seen.
The community, which is self
governing and communistic, has

l but one firearm, an old blunder- \
! buss. There is no currency, and i
j alcohol is unknown. No doors have |
| locks and there is no crime.
The principal crop is potatoes ■
They used to raise wheat but rav- j
ages of swarms of rats prevented
! success of the croo and now the
! Islanders eat potatoes and such
| fish as they can catch. Every man
i works liis own potato patch and j
i does his own fishing. There are i
j some cattle and sheep.
Intermarriage Harmless
Lindav says the predominant j
characteristics of the people are
I their good humor, simplicity, and |
industry. Though they have greatly I
| intermarried their mental sound !
J liess has not been affected. They j
j love sports, and play football and i
(Ticket according to their own j
rules. Running and jumping races 1
also are frequent.
Tristan da Cunha is a British j
possession settled about 1810 by i
English. Some Americans, Scot- i
J tish, Italians, and South African
negroes since have gone there.
White characteristics prevail.
There are three islands in the
group.
