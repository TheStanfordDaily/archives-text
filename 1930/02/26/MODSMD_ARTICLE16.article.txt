### 
| WASHINGTON, Feb. 25. (A*) —President Hoover directed tlie demand
l'or government economy to the people today in an appeal that they
"support" Congress.
Hoover's statement said he hoped "that the people at home will
I realize that the government cannot undertake every worthy social,
economic, military and naval expansion, increases in pay to govern
ment employees, expanded pension systems, or public improvement
projects, and will support, the members of Congress in their co-operation

• with the administration to hold
! down these new proposals for ad
ditional expenditures."
White House Statement
The White House statement was
coincidental with heated discus
sion in the Senate over the pur
poses of Monday's breakfast con
ference between President Hoover
and the Republican Congressional
leaders, which resulted in the de
mand for government economy.
Senator Glass, Democrat, Virginia,
told the Senate that Congress has
pared down the recommendations
of President Hoover for appropria
tion by $20,000,000 so far this
season. He added:
"There is no amateur who has
the remotest knowledge of the
legislative processes of Congress
who could not have told the Presi
dent that he was setting up a
st raw man merely for the purpose
of knocking liiin down."
Senator Watson, of Indiana, the
Republican leader, asserted in re
ply that the Monday White House
parley was urged by House leaders
with a view to bringing pressure
1 to bear "to stem the tide" for ad
ditional appropriations. In his
statement, made at the regular
i Tuesday press conference, Presi
i dent Hoover said:
i "We have enough resources to
take care of the budget and such i
j necessities as marginal cases of j
disability among veterans and the j
speeding up of public works that |
we have undertaken to assist em- |
! ploy men t. and some proposals of j
lesser importance, but this is no j
, time for general expansion of pub- j
lie expenditures."
