### 
If Jupe Pluvius keeps up
the good work Lagunita will
open Saturday, the gods-that
be stated yesterday.
Although the surface of
Lake Searsville is still five or
six feet from the top of the
dam, so that no water is being
derived from that source,
enough water is flowing into
Lagunita through the stream
that empties into it, to bring
the level up to the floats —
"providing," says Ed Thrond
son, boa t house employee,
"that the sun does not come
out, and work overtime, or
some other change does not
occur." At, present about two
feet of water are necessary to
raise the floats from the mud,
Throndson declared.
