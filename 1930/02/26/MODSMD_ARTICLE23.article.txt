Vasquez Returns
President Vasquez, who took ref
uge in the old Santo Domingo
fortress yesterday, returned today
to the presidential mansion. His

The insurgent movement so far
j has been free from excessive vio

character of a revolutionary at
; tempt to overthrow the Vasquez
j government. Jts leaders have de
| manded that the presidential elee

this demand would go far to calm
them. As they control the principal
cities of the republic, except, the
capital they are in a position to
Enforce the acceptance of their
will.
