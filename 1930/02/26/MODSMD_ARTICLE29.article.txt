# JUST AN OLD SPANISH CUSTOM

### 
Modern advertising has spread its posters and messages over
the entire world, and there probably isn'l a small boy on this conti
nent who doesn't know that many people would walk a mile for a
certain brand of cigarette, or that even if blindfolded, veteran
smokers recognize their tasty blend.
While advertisers spend their time and money thinking np new
ideas to intrigue the public taste and pnrse, a certain group of real
estate agents in the southern part of the state has invented a scheme
which takes first prize in Ingenuity.
In order to create the old world atmosphere, relics of the Span
ish past, along the rugged California coast line, these same agents
have constructed ruins of old adobe huts and battered remnants of
Pueblo houses to be built on the subdivision â€”giving that old his
torical touch which will doubtless prove irresistible to lot hunting
( ali format's fresh from the most eastern parts of the nation.
Motion pictures have indeed influenced the growth of said
southern part of the state, but it is going pretty far to be recreating
history and background in the effort to make California more ( ali
fornia than it already is.
