MACBETH —Ralph Chesse's Mar
ionette Playhouse.
Ralph Chesse's marionettes, the
"tinymit.es" of San Francisco, in
the past few months have essayed
roles from many authors Hugeue
O'Neill, Moliere, Anatole France,
Oscar Wilde, Fhakespeare, and a
variety of others playing every
thing in the gamut of drama I'rom
comedy to tragedy.
Now it is Shakespeare's "Mac
beth" that is being presented
through the medium uf these versa
tile puppets. II is not. the complete
"Macbeth" that Chesse is offering
but only some eleven scenes se
lected from the tragedy. However,
so carefully have these eleven
scenes heen chosen that the con
tinuity of ihe play is maintained
quite well.
The marionettes, the scenic ef
fects, and the lighting are beyond
criticism. The degree of reality
which is attained hy Chesse in his
puppets, not more than 12 inches
tall, and 1n his stage settings, is
astonishing. Stage proportion has
heen so skillfully planned and exe
cuted that one feels somewhat of
a shock at the end ol the perform
ance when he realizes the actual
size of the marionettes and their
surroundings.
Of the ll scenes presented,
the two in which the witches ap
pear and the banquet, scene are the
most, effective. Due to the very na
ture of their handling, marionettes
are ideally suited to the portrayal
of Ihe supernatural. Accordingly,
in the two witch scenes they dance
weirdly in the woods and aboul the
cauldron and disappear into the air
in truly magical fashion. Hy intro
ducing a ghost, in the banquet
scene, Chesse obviates the neces
sity of attempting to have the pup
pel representing Macbeth make
known through his actions alone
the presence of Banquo's spirit.
Reading the lines of the play was
not done as well as the actual tech
nical part of the production- the
scenic effects, etc. Ralph Chesse's
Macbeth is convincing, but Leslie
Chesse's interpretation of Lady
MacHet.li is too docile for this al
most-Machiavellian character.
Marionettes and sets were en
tirely constructed by Ralph Chesse.
The Chesse Playhouse, located at
notj Merchant Street, San Fran
cisco, is an interesting and satis
fying experiment in the presenta
tion of serious drama and as such

I is deserving of success. Its next
{production will be "The Moore's
j Legacy" which is scheduled to he
gin March lit. Performances are
I given every Thursday, Friday, and
I Saturday night. —F. A. W.
! THE APES. By Eden Phillpotts.
New York: The Macmillan Co.
1929.
{ "The A pes" is a fable which
i tells of the suggestions made many
i thousands of years ago by a su
| prenie council of'monkeys, consisf-
I ing of the seven wisest members
j of the iribe. For the betterment of
I their race they suggest such things
! as the cultivation (if bananas, the
{eating of meat, the construction of
I houses on the ground, courtship in
j stead of seizure of the female, use
jof poison in warfare, and Hie or
ganization of an army inspired by
{ patriotism.
! /eb, youiigesl of the council, sug
j gests a policy of kindness, and
I hints lit the possibility that the ape
is not the ultimate niasterwork of.
I nature. I lis views are met with ex-
I treme hostility on the part of the
i tribe, ;tiid lie is condemned To the
! deal li rock for heresy.
| As lie is about to be executed
! there appears tin* form of a man,
! who says that he is the descendant
jof (lie ;ipe. lie outlines sonje of
j the results of the innovations just
suggested, and says that his race,
too, thought itself the darling of
crea lion.
/eh is saved from death, and the
tribe splits between his followers
and those who advocate war. Many
generations later a man is actu
ally seen, but, instead of being the
| kind creature expected by the apes,
' he kills them.
j The attitude of the reader to
j ward such a book as "The Apes"
[depends, obviously, upon his like
! or dislik" of tile ideas presented.
While there is nothing particularly
wrong in tlient they are, at pres
ent., rather commonplace. "The
i Ajies" contains nothing worthy of
| parl icula r comment.
Eden I'hillpolts has indulged in
j a type of fiction which seems to he
j something of a weakness among
i English authors of the twentieth
century. Wells and Shaw have
] tried the same variety of work
with, in my opinion, very little suc
! cess. The annoying "creative evo
lution" theory of the latter, as
shown in "Back to Methuselah," is
l an outcome of attempts at this kind
. of work. —E. E. W.
