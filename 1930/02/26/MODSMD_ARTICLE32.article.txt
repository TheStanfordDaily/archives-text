## THEN THE WINDS DO BLOW 
### 
The Kd it or, Sir:
The Daily yesterday turned ils
editorial eye on the five-hundred,
and in no uncertain words inferred
that inaclivity on the part of (lie
women whs (lie cause of the pres
ent system of A.YV.S. regulations.
For (lie benefit of (lie campus at
large, perhaps a little more insight
into what (lie statements Miss Yosl
made really mean, would shed li.nln
on the controversy.
While it is true as Miss Yost
said "In the time I have been
there, no request (In- women stu
dents have made has been denied"
that statement, like many an
other made in newspapers, only
lells half the story and infers that
the women have asked ONLY for
what they have received.
The whole question centers down
to a very fine distinction over (he
word "request." While if is very
(rue that no request officially made
to the administration has been de
nied, there have been requests as
numerous as the day is long for
extension of the lock-nut rules, and
for greater freedom for the women.
These requests have been made
unofficially informally and AS
SUCH have been denied, so ohvi
ously NO judicial group with any
intelligence would submit official
requests which have been infor
mally discussed beforehand.
"Where (he winds of freedom
blow" may sound Ironical in (In
case of women's regulations, but
there ip no such (hinp, as personal
freedom in a social group. Worfien's
[colleges over (lie country have

1 rules as strict or even stricter than j
those here and while it may be j
said that Stanford men are basking j
in the light winds of freedom —
perhaps a littl" more regulation of
the Cardinal roughs might not be ;
amiss. —Stanford
