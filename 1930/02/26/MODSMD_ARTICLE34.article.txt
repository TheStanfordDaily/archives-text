### BY PHILIP SPACE 
Well, we got by the first day.
Maybe we'll get back into ilie
swing of this funny business. But j
that vacation made us pretty rusty,
I or m least that's as good an ex
cuse as any.
The set for "Granite" is said to i
he well fortified.
We hope this will not be neces
-1 sary for the audience.
I
We don't want to seem critical,
| but isn't the Dramatic Council
treading a little on the sacrile- j
| gious, serving ham on Fridays?
j Players on the new campus golf \
j course were astonished to see a 1
big Bulgarian drive down the fair- \
way.
These solicitors are everywhere! 1
Euphronia, by the way, thinks
that a niblick is a small morsel.
i
And a hunker is a local politi
cian.
HUMOR NOTE
The third class election in two
weeks was held on the Quad yes-j
i l< iday, getting badly in the way of j
pedestrian traffic, but otherwise
causing little comment.
This department takes occasion
right here and now to spike that
rumor that the basketball team is
I entering the national tournament.
It's not the national tournament,
at all, but the weekly "Believe It
or Not" contest.
After all, 17 straight losses 1o a j
single team is something of which
j not every college can boast.
Chaparral's next number is True I
I Confessions.
Now maybe we'll find out Who
1 Burned the Bonfire.
Or who invented the women's
j lockout rules.
