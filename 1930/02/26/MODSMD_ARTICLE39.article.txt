Lift. STOREY STARTS PETITION
.Vlr. Ripley will no doubt be .star
tled dear (Hit ot liis rompers when
In' hears of I In* latest Believe It
Or Not, which teat tires none ot her
than our own Dr. Thomas Andrew
Storey, director of physical educa
iion on tlie Farm, as the hero.
For on close investigation of one
ol those many rumors that have
been final ing about the rumpus of
late, the Daily reporter gobbled up
a real scandalizing scoop late yes-
It rday afternoon.
It seems that said athletic
lord of Stanford U. has been
circulating a petition in and
about the B.A.C.'s fine brick
mansion—to be signed by mem
bers of the Farm coaching
staff.
What is more, a large number of
the sports mentors have already
scribbled their.John llenrys on the
written plea. And not only once,
but three times! Tin; coaches are
taking no chances of having their
names lost in some wayside waste
basket, as did the fickle students
not so long ago.
However, the scoop is not as im
portant as il lirst seems. For the
signed plea only pertains to the
ITiiled States' adherence to tiie
World Court.
Vet, it is a Miracle of Sports,
coming from Dr. Thomas An
drew Storey. Perhaps he is
riot so adverse to petitions af
ter all!
EVEN "AVIATOR" KRENZ
Speaking ol rumors, there was
one of a false nature sent out on
the press wires from Fresno the
other day, staling that the Stanford
li. A.<'. is scheduled to meet on
Saturday next to pass on the Farm
track team's entry in the Raisin
Day Relays.
No such gathering of the ath
letic lords lias been slated, and,
what is more, it is ample dinero
to a doughnut's hole that Air. Rob
ert n. Templeton's track and field
performers will tiot take part in
the annual Raisin Day festivities.
For Stanford has a most
gruelling clash on the cinder
paths that very afternoon with
Washington. As the Fresno af
fair is scheduled to be run off
in the evening (the spectators
would shrivel lip right along
with the grapes in the day
time), the Farm athletes would
have to fly ciown to the Raisin
City immediately after chasing
around the campus oval with
the Huskies.
Even "Aviator" K ren ?. would
balk at that!
PROFESSIONAL CARD PLAYER
Among the latest old-timers to
visit his alma mater is Clarence
"Cookie" S.vpher, captain of the
Cardinal baseball nine two years
ago, who arrived <>n the campus
two days ago.
After leaving the unsubsi
dized sanctions of the Farm,
Mr. Sypher turned pro, join
ing the Mission Coast League
ball club along with Ernie
Nevers, '27.
Last, year he performed behind
the plate for Hollywood, while this
year lie lias signed with Wichita,
in the Western circuit.
Air. Sypher told the Daily re
porter yesterday that he expects
to pack up his toothbrush some
time this week-end and depart for
the Wichita training camp down
in out hern Texas.
•He said training. Yet, we
have our suspicions—with beer
and pretzels across the border
but eight miles from camp
headquarters.
