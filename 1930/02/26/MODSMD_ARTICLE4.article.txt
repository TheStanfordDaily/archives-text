# VOTE TO KEEP CONCERT SERIES
## Ex Committee in Favor of Rentention if Profitable 
### 
"Keep the annual A.S.S.U. concert
series as long as it is financially prac
tical'' was the concensus of opinion
at the Executive Committee meeting
last night.
The committee went on record as
favoring the general policy of hold
ing the concerts annually, providing
that a large deficit was not incurred
by so doing, it was argued that it
was worth a small output on the part
of the Associated Students to have
good musical entertainments given on
the campus. A second motion was
passed authorizing the arrangement of
a program for next year subject to
the approval of the A.S.S.L'. student
manager.
The appointment of a committee to
plan a mural decoration for the A.S.
S.r. Council Room was recommended.
