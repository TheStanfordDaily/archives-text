# "THE DRIVE'S THE THING"..
## Lusty Tee Shot Over-compensates Extra Putts; Length Of Drive May Matter More Than Placing 
### Feg Murray, '16 
A lusty tee shot more than makes
up for a couple of exlra putts ai
the previous green, and that is why
long drives are always interesting.
A good sock down the fairway is
worth two into the bush, also, but
some don't, much care where they
go, as long as they go far. And the
argument as to who hits the longest
ball is as endless as the one about
"who won the war?," the Tolleys,
Mitchells, Halls. Augustuses, Cam
bers, Cullanes, Braids, and Browns
all having plenty of backers, with
this cartoonist knowing better than
to try to get mixed up in the de
bate.
There are, on record, a dozen or
more drives of more than 400
yards, so you duffers who hit them
250 needn't get a bit puffed up.
Why, Glenna Collett and other
girls have driven 300 yards! Then
there are a lot of trick drives, too,
that went for unbelievable dis
tances, such as from the top of
skyscrapers, from the wings of
planes, from a mountain peak in
Ranier National Park, from the toy
of the pyramids, and into passing
automobiles, trains, and even air-
I planes!

; Whereas men like Jess Guilford
("the Boston Siege Gun") Cyril
j Tolley, Bobby Jones, and Francis
Brown are consistently long driv
ers, others happen to have condi
tions exactly right, get a good long
wallop with the wind on a down
hill hole, the ball bouncing on
| frozen ground or an exposed rock,
and, zingo! another 400-yard drive
\ goes into the record books'. Charley
Hall, of Birmingham, Ala., gave
the little white pellet a 500-yard
ride once, but who ever heard of
I a man accidentally driving more
than 300 yards backwards?
That's just what D. R. Russell of
Edinburgh did, when he waggled
furiously (and carelessly) and hit
the ball on a backward swing in the
Braids tournament in 1913, causing
the pesky pill to jump a fence be
hind the tee and roll a long, long
ways down hill! D. 11. Anderson
made his one-armed drive of 300
j yards at the Joliet Country Club
'in 1!) 10, and Helen Hicks proved,
in a test at Pinehurst last year,
that one doesn't, actually have to
see the ball, as long as the head is
anchored the right position, to
drive a satisfying distance.

There are, on record, a dozen or
more drives of more than 400
yards, so you duffers who hit them
250 needn't get a bit puffed up.
Why, Glenna Collett and other
girls have driven 300 yards! Then
there are a lot of trick drives, too,
that went for unbelievable dis
tances, such as from the top of
skyscrapers, from the wings of
planes, from a mountain peak in
Ranier National Park, from the toy
of the pyramids, and into passing
automobiles, trains, and even air-
I planes!

; Whereas men like Jess Guilford
("the Boston Siege Gun") Cyril
j Tolley, Bobby Jones, and Francis
Brown are consistently long driv
ers, others happen to have condi
tions exactly right, get a good long
wallop with the wind on a down
hill hole, the ball bouncing on
| frozen ground or an exposed rock,
and, zingo! another 400-yard drive
\ goes into the record books'. Charley
Hall, of Birmingham, Ala., gave
the little white pellet a 500-yard
ride once, but who ever heard of
I a man accidentally driving more
than 300 yards backwards?
That's just what D. R. Russell of
Edinburgh did, when he waggled
furiously (and carelessly) and hit
the ball on a backward swing in the
Braids tournament in 1913, causing
the pesky pill to jump a fence be
hind the tee and roll a long, long
ways down hill! D. 11. Anderson
made his one-armed drive of 300
j yards at the Joliet Country Club
'in 1!) 10, and Helen Hicks proved,
in a test at Pinehurst last year,
that one doesn't, actually have to
see the ball, as long as the head is
anchored the right position, to
drive a satisfying distance.

A lusty tee shot more than makes
up for a couple of exlra putts ai
the previous green, and that is why
long drives are always interesting.
A good sock down the fairway is
worth two into the bush, also, but
some don't, much care where they
go, as long as they go far. And the
argument as to who hits the longest
ball is as endless as the one about
"who won the war?," the Tolleys,
Mitchells, Halls. Augustuses, Cam
bers, Cullanes, Braids, and Browns
all having plenty of backers, with
this cartoonist knowing better than
to try to get mixed up in the de
bate.
