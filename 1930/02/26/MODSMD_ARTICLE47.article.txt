# START OF MURAL CAGE TITLE PLAY SET FOR TONIGHT
## Breakers Meet Sequoia at Pavilion; El Toro Plays El Cuadro 
### 
Breakers and Sequoia 1 will tan
gle in the Pavilion tonight at eight
o'clock in what should be the fea
ture contest of first round playoffs
of intramural basketball leagim
champions. At seven o'clock in the
Pavilion Beta Theta Pi will meet
the Cardinal Independents, while
El Toro takes on El Cuadro at the
same hour in the gym.
Sequoia's quintet, winners of a
relatively strong league, concluded
the preliminary season in a blaze
of glory, overwhelming Delta Chi,
second-place winners, 37-S, Monday
night. The ball team's closest game
was with the Phi Betes, Sequoia
winning out 30-27 after trailing by
two points with only a minute and
a half to go. The hall men rely
heavily on "Swede" Palm berg,
clever ball-handler, and on the
speed of their forward line com
posed of Palmberg, Branson, and
Trimmingham.
Breakers Fast Team
Breakers beat out. Theta Chi in
the first game of the season to dis
pose of their strongest league op
position. Stan and Joe Cook and
Cai'lsmith, small but fast: forwards
who are deadeyes at locating the
hoop, have provided most of the
scoring for the club five. Breakers
are well-fortified at the guard posi
tions with Kyte and Bogue defend
ing the bucket.
Cardinal Independents opened
the season looking like world
beaters, but after running up high
1 scores against their first two op
ponents suffered a relapse from
which they have yet to emerge.
Despite this slump the Cardinals
are expected to defeat the Beta
i Theta Pi five which barely arrived
(at the top of a weak league. Getts,
former Occidental star, is the lead
ing light, of the Card quintet, al
though he is well-supported by po
tentially superior basketball play
j ers as Romig, Case, and Harrison.
El Toro Favored
| El Toro should find lift ie diffi
â€¢ culty in disposing of El Cuadro.

The Bulls sling a mean basketball
and in the preliminary contests
disposed of the fairly strong quin
tets representing Zeta Psi and
Delta Kappa Kpsilon. Toro boasts
victories over both the San Jose
State reserves and first string in
practice games. Hubbard and
Brown, formerly of San Jose State
and the Livermore Cowboys re
spectively, comprise an unusually
strong duo at the guard positions,
i while the forward line is well taken
care of by Reed, Fisher, and C'ran
dall.
Sigma Chi, one of the strong
contenders for the University
championship, draws a bye in the
first round of the playoff. The
Sigma Cliis will meet the winner
of i lie El Cuudro-El Toro game in
the next round.
