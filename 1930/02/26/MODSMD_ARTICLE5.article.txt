# WARREN D. ALLEN TALKS ON MELODY AS HARMONY BASIS
## 
### 
Rhythm to the average person
means measures, bars, ami often
Heavily emphasized heats," said
Warren 1). Allen, I'Diversity organ
ist, who lectured last, night on
"Melody as the Historical Basis of
Harmony," the third talk in the
series on llie Elements of Music.
"That beautiful rhythm is pos
sible without measures, is shown
in the old Gregorian music," lie
continued, "which was written be
fore measured music was discov
ered. This music is composed to
fit the Biblical verses or prose for
which it is intended, and a greater
appreciation of melodic line is
therefore gained without bars. Of
ten melody suffers at the chopping
effect of bars."
Church music today is coming
into a new era, Allen believes, and
more of the Plain Songs, and those
without acconipaninn n! are being
introduced. This is a step from
])iist, religious music when the
Church seemed to regard a quartet
choir as the last word. Harmony
us we know it lias been developed
almost entirely in the Christian
civilizations.
After plain chants, singing in
parts became a favorite indoor
sport among the ancients, and they
sang in fifths, rather than the
thirds which are so common today.
This polophony led into measured
music, and a metric chant. The ef
fect of measured music was great,
and much triviality is due Jo this.
However, without this new intro
duction, the music of Bach and
Handel, and later composers would
not have been possible.
