# DINK RELYING ON HIS CINDER MEN TO COP MEET FROM L.A.A.C.
## Card Track Team Weak in Field; Stout Battle in Weights Expected 
### 
So long accustomed to having
most of the points cinched in the
field events, Coach Dink Temple
ton will face a strange situation
when his men take on the Los An
geles Athletic Club tracksters at
the Stadium Saturday afternoon.
For the lirst time in a number of
seasons, Templeton linds a real
weakness in his entries in the field
events, and will have to rely on
liis cinder men to win the meet.
Brix Favored
In the shot, Herman Brix of the
club must be favored over Krenz
ami Hot hurt because of his mark
of 51 feet 7 inches last Saturday
in tin; South. Krenz is pretty sure
to break 51 feet Saturday, while
with a week's hard work, Ilothert
should make about the same dis
tance. Hoth Rothert. and Krenz
were pretty close to 51 feet last
Friday and were handicapped by
the cold weather. Third place
should be better than 51 feet.
In the discus, Krenz, Rothert, and
Grey will have their hands full
winning from Brix and Bud Hou
ser. llouser, who formerly held the
world's record for the discus at
158 feet, is always a dangerous
competitor, though lie joined the
club so recently that nothing is
known of his form this season.
Krenz should win, with Brix, Hou
scr, Rothert, and Grey have bet
tered 140 feet this season, while
Krenz tosses the platter beyond
the 150-foot line with great regu-
Broadjump Good
Should Dowell get into form, the
Cards have a good chance to score
a sweep in the broadjump, for both
Butler and West have been con
sistent above the 23-foot line.
Dowell jumped 22 feet 9 inches
Friday, and should have little dif
ficulty in adding a few inches to
that mark Saturday. Allen anu
Madison will be lucky to take bet
ter than a third in the high jump,
as Keefer and Gill have already
done 0 feet 2 inches. Allen's mark
of (I feet Vt inch last Friday is the
best made here so far, but lie is
improving rapidly.
Fred Sturdy, formerly of Yale,
flew across the continent the other
day and will be on hand to help
take points for the club in the
vault. It"he has not had time .to
get in form, Graham of the club
should take care of first place, as
he lias already climbed 13 feet 1
inches. Berry and DeGroot of t lie
Cards can figure no better than
third.
Sweep in Javelin
A clean sweep in the javelin
looms for L.A.A.C. with DeMers,
Eaton, and Hoover entered. About
thi! only hope for Stanford in this
ov*Mit is Rothert, who luis not had
time to practice throwing so far,
lint who looked go,od last Friday
with a loss of 174 feet. Goldsmith
is a good competitor and might sur
prise.
in tlu; field events then, on the
biisis of the above "dope," the
Mercury athletes will score 33
points to the Cards' 21, which is a
big handicap to make up on the
track. However, since club teams
are nearly always out of condition
early in the season, Templeton's
men have a good chance to win
the majority of points in tlie tracK j
events on superior condition.
