# HONOR AND SUSPICION SHOULD NOT BE COMBINED IN EXAMINATIONS. SAYS TREAT
## 
### BY RAWSON HOLMES 
This is thi' third of a series of opinions on the proposed amendment to the
Honor Code which will establish a system of optional praetors, by those men
who are best able to comprehend the situation, namely professors who have
lan/e classes.

"I do not like any method of giv
ing examinations that combines
honor and suspicion," commented
Payson Jackson Treat, Professor
of History, to a Daily reporter,
when questioned as to the merits
of the proposed amendment to the
Honor Code, which if passed would
establish an optional proctor sys
tem.
"We should either keep to the
honor system, pure and simple, or
adopt an absolute proctor system,"
Professor Treat declared. "The
combination, in my opinion, would
be pernicious. To have good faith
in one classroom and proctors in
another, would be highly imprac
tical. Personally, I think it would
be a pity to lose the hue feature of
Stanford life that the Honor Sys
tem now is; but if it is found to
be unworkable, a complete super
vision by proctors is the alterna
tive.
"The conduct of examinations on
the basis oL' faith and integrity is
too valuable to lose without a

, shooting and thoughtful students
and not by the faculty.
"How should the students make
this struggle? 1 remember the in
stance some years ago of a girl i
who stood up during an examina
tion and bravely said, 'There is
cheating going on in this room.' j
Not only did it stop immediately,
but the man who had been the
cause of her action later thanked
j her for it and asked her to report |
him to the instructor. When she i
refused to do so, he turned in his
own name. * j
"Rapping on the desk with a pen
cil would have produced the same
effect," the professor concluded. "A
cheater is naturally a coward. If
he were not, he would not cheat."
