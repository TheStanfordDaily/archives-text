ARCHLAST EIGHT—The Modem Shoe |
A certain young man attached to the
diplomatic corps of a European na
tion makes it a point to be well
dressed at all times. He is familiar
with style ideas on both sides of the
Atlantic. A shoe which he regards
with favor is this neat, rather con
servative British oxford model —
called the Warwick. Selz has pro
duced this style in imported leathers
and has added the Archlast feature
For comfort.
We have it—
in imported Black Calfskin
at $8
