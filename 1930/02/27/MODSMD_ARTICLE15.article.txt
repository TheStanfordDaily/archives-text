# COLLAPSE OF CHAUTEMPS MINISTRY BRINGS TARDIEU BACK AS FRENCH PREMIER
## Doumergue's Selection Follows Advice of Poincare; Ministers in New Government to Comprise Members of Moderate Element 
### 
I IJAKIS, Feb. :!(i. (/p) Andre Tardieu was hoisted back into I Ik* political
I saddle today by President Gaslon Doumerguo who followed 11k* advice
I ol' Raymond Poincare and summoned him to jeform the eabinet over
j thrown on February 17.
i The first announcement of progress was that Aristide Briand, veteran
| foreign minister, had agreed to retain liis portfolio and collaborate in
j the selection of a government to replace the cabinet headed by Camille

v Chautemps which was denied a
! vote oL' confidence yesterday.
II was generally assumed thai
the Tardieu-Poincare conferences
which were going on this evening
would result in the selection of a
list of ministers representing all
moderate elements in the chamber
of deputies, hut with some repre
sentatives of the parlies of the
right.
Gauntlet Thrown
Such a list, it was pointed out,
would amount, to the throwing
down of a gauntlet to (lit! parties
of Ihe left represented by Chau
(emps, Edouard Herrint, and Kdou
-1 aid Deladier. Should the cabinet
j which Tardieu is trying to form
win its necessary vote of confi
dence in ihe chamber, France
would have a moderate conserva
tive government. If it is over
thrown, it was predicted tonight
that President Doumergue again
would have to look to the left.
Tardieu was entrusted with the
task after he first had refused and
nominated Poincare. But the latter
told lh<! President his health was
still too precarious from the effects
! of recent, operations to permit him
If) assume the burdens of the pre
miership. He, therefore, urged that
Tardieu should be called upon once
more, promising to collaborate with
him and on this basis was made
the special mesenger of the Chief
Executive to notify the Premier
elecl of his designation.
It was acknowledged that a cabi
ne'j| under Poincare would have
been received with less resentment
on the part of the left groups be
cause "The Saviour of the Franc"
had nothing to do with the defeat
of I lie Chautemps list. On the con
trary, Tardieu was held responsible
for yesterday's outcome and he can
expect little or no help from the
left groups despite the presence of
IJriand in his cabinet.
