# BREAKERS FIVE DOWNS SEQUOIA
## El Toro, Cardinals Also Win Mural Tilts 
### 
Pulling a brilliant fourth quarter
comeback to overcome a four-point
lead Breakers defeated Sequoia
30-24 last night in the first round
of intramural basketball champion
ship play. In the other two first
round games El Toro downed El
Cuadro 40-13, and the Cardinal In-
dependents took a 40-12 victory
from Beta Theta Pi.
Outcome of the Breakers-Sequoia
contest was in doubt, until the last
two minutes of play when Stan
Cook broke away for a shot under
the bucket to give the clubmen a
one-point lead and followed this by
converting two free throws. Kyte
pushed another field goal through
the hoop as the final whistle blew.
Feliz and Mundt at guards for
Sequoia played outstanding games.
Krause Stars
Going on a one-man shooting
spree Bob Krause accounted for|
eighteen points as 101 Toro defeat
ed El Cuadro 40-13. Although clear-
ly outclassed, El Cuadro put up a
good game, the work of Boyd at
guard standing out in particular.
Playing their best game since
the start of the season Cardinals
downed Beta Theta Pi 40-12. Getts,
stellar center for the Independent
five, hounded the ball all over the
court, and took high-scoring honors
with 12 points.
