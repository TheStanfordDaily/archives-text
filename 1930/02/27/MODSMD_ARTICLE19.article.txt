Startling With ils chill stone ef- i

play "Granite,",to be given on the

mysterious background necessary j
for the melodrama.
The men behind the scenes have >
created :i stern fortress-like room I
with (i massive fireplace and a
granite hewn stairway. Tim bare, J
i old atmosphere is typical of the ■
influence of the Island, and al 1
though I lie room is liveable, it pre-j
sents still the aspect of its earlier |
days and looks almost hewn out of j
the granite itself. It is believed that j
the present occupants probably
roofed over an old stone castle
whose roof and beams have fallen j
in, rotted by the fierce storms so,
common oil the, rocky island.
Storm Adds Suspense
A storm on the coasts of the j
island during the play furnishes aj
wild eerie atmosphere, and the
sound of the surf pounding against
the rocks, atid the wind moaning
around the granite cliffs creates i
high suspense. A very melodra
matic scene is played by Katherine
Kcho during the storm, when she
contemplates selling her soul to

tlm Devil.

is given by the ingenious fireplace.
The windows are mere slits and
were used as peek-holes in the old
lortn ss. The firelight itself seems
to change with the atmosphere <>t
the play. "Homey" at first, and
then changing as though under an

Many Colors Used

purple, and light violet will mix to
give the rich and yet barren set
ting of the hewn granite walls. The
lighting effects are being worked
cut by Joe Gordon, stage electri
cian, and his assistant, Jack Gal
hraith.
The costumes of the play are in
the period, about a hundred years l
ago, and are very simple in line
and fashion. They are made from i
coarse homespun material and are
suitable to farmer folk who make
their living from the soli.
