# THE 						LONG AND SHORT OF IT

While it has been pretty definitely established in the minds of
most people that there can be no compromise between the Honor
( ode and a proctor system, the fundamental question of the Honor
t ode is still raised by many on ihi> campus who believe that the
idea can never be made practical.
At the I niversity of California there are those of the same mind,
apparently, lo them the Daily California}! says this: "( )ur theory
of the Honor System is that it may work no better, but certainly
no worse, than the method ot proctor patrol. Experience elsewhere
has proved that as many cheat under either plan of control and
about as many are caught. If from a practical standpoint they are
on a par. the logical view is that the I lonor System is better because
it gives the majority of students, who do not cheat, an opportunity
to be trusted. While perhaps not the foundation of student gov
ernment, it adds a further and most important element to the items
under student jurisdiction."
Stanford men and women who believe the Honor Code is a
failure, are privileged to think as they choose, of course, but they
should consider carefully the ideas presented by the Californian
before they pull their house of cards down over their ears.
I lie Honor Code at Stanford may not be perfect—far from it
in tact —and it should not be maintained simply because it is an
ideal. I Jut students of this I niversity should think long and seri
ously before they advocate the abolition of a system of convenience,
and honor, for one of inconvenience and pressure, when, in the
end, such a substitution is likely t«> effect no real change in student
conduct.
