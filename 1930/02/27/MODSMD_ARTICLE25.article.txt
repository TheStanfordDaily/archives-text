I hat Stan lord s ( cllar has become a gathering placc for campus
social affairs i> the latest announcement of its director. Miss Etta \
1\ 11 finely. It has become so popular that students are even forsak- !
ing the Stanford Library to stud\ amidst the odors of steaming
coffee and toasting bread. We may next expect the successful
holding of rallies there.
All this advancement to the cause of the I nion has been ac
complished by the recent deluge of ten cent tickets, to be used at the
discretion ot the receiver during the slack hours of Cellar trade. |
The tickets offer a ten-cent discount to the user.
There is no doubt, but that the attempts to gather the loose ends |
of the campus social affairs together in the Cellar are interesting j
experiments. Ilowever, when there are so few really choice booths'
at the ( cllar available and these well-lighted cells are usually occu
pied by nocturnal students, it does seem a shame to those in other
receptacles—who would like to see what they convey to their
mouths—that Miss I landy does not oiler 4 o'clock tea service and
o'clock demi-tasse to the inhabitants of the library. We are sure
ihe enterprise would be a profit to Miss I landy's Cellar, if not an
aid to the time-wastrels attempting to studv.
