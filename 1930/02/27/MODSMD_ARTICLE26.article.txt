# CONFECTIONERY AND STUDIES

"College life i> like the innocent little prune whip."' declares the I
I Diversity of California at Los Angeles Daily Bruin. The southern
journal further declares the froth of the prune whip is more inter
esting than the actual prunes which make up the concoction.
According to the Daily Bruin, the froth consists of proms, moon- :
light nights, pretty women, debonair men, nice clothes, shinv road-j
-tcrs, and everything nice rolled into one. 112 >n the other hand there
is the black and pruney part. The prunes are those "who study and 1
really gain academic knowledge. They are the intellectuals."
I lowcver. the whip soon turns to a weak and watery consistency,
while the unassuming prune remains substantially the same, says
the Bruin. j
Perhaps, the Bruin someday might find the happy medium and I
obtain a new concoction. At Stanford some students have been
able to achieve this happy medium and remain free of both the
gooey froth and the black pruney substance. I nfortunately. how
ever. the. great majority is to be found divided into one class or the
other.
