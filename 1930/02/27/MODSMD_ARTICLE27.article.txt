THE LIFE OF NAPOLEON. By
Dimitri S. Merezhkovsky. E. P.
Dutton & Co., New York. 1929.
To the sun does .Merezhkovsky
I compare Napoleon. Ilis symbolism
likening the emperor's career to
! the course ol' the sun, Merezhkov
i sky divides his "Life of Napoleon"
I into six parts: chiwn, sunrise, noon,
I eventide, sunset, and night.
Napoleon here is the man of vic
i tories, but also the man of peace.
All of his campaigns are under
| taken in the interest, of lasting
I peace. Peace for his own people
| and for all Europe is what this sol
dier desires; this soldier who re
lies on war to attain all his ends,
who even declares on one occasion:
I"I owe my power to my fame, and
my fame to my triumphs. IVly vic
tories made me what I am, and by
them alone can I retain power."
Merezhkovsky reveals him as a
lover of peace, versed in only one
1 means of gaining its blessings
war.
The author does no! seek to ex
' cuse Napoleon for his weaknesses
or to exonerate him from responsi
bility for the fearsome conse

( quencea of those weaknesses —only
to show that, "the scourge of Eu-
I rope" was a misunderstood man,
I who, given the opportunity by
j Prance and by her neighbors,
might have brought about the gold
en age of peace for which his peo
: pie yearned.
Merezhkovsky casts Napoleon in
j the role of a fatalist and a seer
: who knows his own destiny -what
| he does, he does because be re
members his future and what he
| must do. After Waterloo the au
thor writes, "He understood now,
> remembered that life is but a
! dream, ever repeating itself
throughout eternity; life's cycle is
like that of the sun: dawn, sun
rise, noon, eventide, sunset —
1 night."
This portrayal is no more ac
i curate, perhaps, and far less com-
I prelum,sive, undoubtedly, than most
I of the other volumes already writ
j ten concerning Napoleon. However,
■ this work, it is safe to hazard, be
cause of its analytical and imagi
native nature and because of the
author's interpretative skill, is far
more interesting than the majority
of them. —F. A. W.

THE LIFE OF NAPOLEON. By
Dimitri S. Merezhkovsky. E. P.
Dutton & Co., New York. 1929.
To the sun does .Merezhkovsky
I compare Napoleon. Ilis symbolism
likening the emperor's career to
! the course ol' the sun, Merezhkov
i sky divides his "Life of Napoleon"
I into six parts: chiwn, sunrise, noon,
I eventide, sunset, and night.
Napoleon here is the man of vic
i tories, but also the man of peace.
All of his campaigns are under
| taken in the interest, of lasting
I peace. Peace for his own people
| and for all Europe is what this sol
dier desires; this soldier who re
lies on war to attain all his ends,
who even declares on one occasion:
I"I owe my power to my fame, and
my fame to my triumphs. IVly vic
tories made me what I am, and by
them alone can I retain power."
Merezhkovsky reveals him as a
lover of peace, versed in only one
1 means of gaining its blessings
war.
The author does no! seek to ex
' cuse Napoleon for his weaknesses
or to exonerate him from responsi
bility for the fearsome conse

( quencea of those weaknesses —only
to show that, "the scourge of Eu-
I rope" was a misunderstood man,
I who, given the opportunity by
j Prance and by her neighbors,
might have brought about the gold
en age of peace for which his peo
: pie yearned.
Merezhkovsky casts Napoleon in
j the role of a fatalist and a seer
: who knows his own destiny -what
| he does, he does because be re
members his future and what he
| must do. After Waterloo the au
thor writes, "He understood now,
> remembered that life is but a
! dream, ever repeating itself
throughout eternity; life's cycle is
like that of the sun: dawn, sun
rise, noon, eventide, sunset —
1 night."
This portrayal is no more ac
i curate, perhaps, and far less com-
I prelum,sive, undoubtedly, than most
I of the other volumes already writ
j ten concerning Napoleon. However,
■ this work, it is safe to hazard, be
cause of its analytical and imagi
native nature and because of the
author's interpretative skill, is far
more interesting than the majority
of them. —F. A. W.
