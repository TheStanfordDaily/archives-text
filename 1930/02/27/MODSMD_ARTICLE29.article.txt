# Campus Opinion
## KEEP THE CHANGE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Late last quarter I had the honor
of writing a letter to Campus
Opinion which, I am indirectly ad
! vised, the editor found so intensely
, interesting that he decided to keep
1 it solely for himself. At first, of
course, such a flattering gesture on !
| his part rather tickled me; but, on i
| reflection, J became slightly piqued I
that my golden words did not ap
pear in print. The editor, however,
observing the example of some of
! the haughty great of the past in
dealing with insignificant inferiors,
continued to lam me with chunks j
of silence. Long, indeed, has my
(lushed spirit languished, bul now, 1
i the evident liberality of the pres- j
| ent editor (take it, dear fellow; !
j no extra charge! ) impels me to j
try again.
My letter, as I recall, begged for j
the insertion of a little more in-j
j telligence into fraternity and sor-1
ority rushing. In fact, I referred to '
the pledging season as an annual |
j insanity. The dear editor, I grant !
you, being ;t proud Greek, sus !
peeled that these statements were!
not being presented from bis point
of view. Whereupon he exhibited a
phenomenon which, complains I
President Wilbur, is too often j
characteristic of fraternity men j
who are suddenly confronted bv ;
criticisnis that smack of truth: I
j "drawing in under the shell and j
beginning a form of internal com- j
bustion."
The major part of by epistle, j
however, was modestly devoted to j
praising an article by another, and 1
urging others to read it. I refer to j
an fssay by Francis Theresa !tus j
sell in the latest issue of the J
Sewanee Review, a high-grad" j
quarterly to be found in the main j
section of our library's periodical !
room. Mrs. Russell, one of Stan- j
ford's conspicuously scholarly fac- j
ulty members, and herself a soror- j
ity woman, presents quite a thor-1
ough analysis of Greek letter or- !
ganization, past and current. She
hints that fraternities are now on!
a false basis, and that their failure ■
to admit it presages downfall. I
Fraternities, the author offers,!
got their start during the Victorian
period, when young people were ro- i
mantic and sentimental instead of ,
c ynical. They also acquired enough j
snobbishness at their inception to j
keep them from later admitting un !
pleasant things about themselves.!
Ultimately, they have developed)
an acute case of hypocrisy that j
may turn out to he fatal.
It seems to me that freshmen |
and other prospectives should read
the article. It is entitled "Our Vic- 1
torian Greeks." I submit, as I did
before, that a rushee should be j
credited with brains and given a
chance to, realize that there is
more to "going row" than being
able henceforth to show Sally some
mysterious letters with bright jew
els about them.
Hopefully, and with utmost re
spect, —A. Luninus, '20.

the walks are hard enough to navi- I

gooks who park their cars in the }

to the Encina Commons. God knows j
the walks are hard enough to navi- I

The Editor, Sir:
Late last quarter I had the honor
of writing a letter to Campus
Opinion which, I am indirectly ad
! vised, the editor found so intensely
, interesting that he decided to keep
1 it solely for himself. At first, of
course, such a flattering gesture on !
| his part rather tickled me; but, on i
| reflection, J became slightly piqued I
that my golden words did not ap
pear in print. The editor, however,
observing the example of some of
! the haughty great of the past in
dealing with insignificant inferiors,
continued to lam me with chunks j
of silence. Long, indeed, has my
(lushed spirit languished, bul now, 1
i the evident liberality of the pres- j
| ent editor (take it, dear fellow; !
j no extra charge! ) impels me to j
try again.
My letter, as I recall, begged for j
the insertion of a little more in-j
j telligence into fraternity and sor-1
ority rushing. In fact, I referred to '
the pledging season as an annual |
j insanity. The dear editor, I grant !
you, being ;t proud Greek, sus !
peeled that these statements were!
not being presented from bis point
of view. Whereupon he exhibited a
phenomenon which, complains I
President Wilbur, is too often j
characteristic of fraternity men j
who are suddenly confronted bv ;
criticisnis that smack of truth: I
j "drawing in under the shell and j
beginning a form of internal com- j
bustion."
The major part of by epistle, j
however, was modestly devoted to j
praising an article by another, and 1
urging others to read it. I refer to j
an fssay by Francis Theresa !tus j
sell in the latest issue of the J
Sewanee Review, a high-grad" j
quarterly to be found in the main j
section of our library's periodical !
room. Mrs. Russell, one of Stan- j
ford's conspicuously scholarly fac- j
ulty members, and herself a soror- j
ity woman, presents quite a thor-1
ough analysis of Greek letter or- !
ganization, past and current. She
hints that fraternities are now on!
a false basis, and that their failure ■
to admit it presages downfall. I
Fraternities, the author offers,!
got their start during the Victorian
period, when young people were ro- i
mantic and sentimental instead of ,
c ynical. They also acquired enough j
snobbishness at their inception to j
keep them from later admitting un !
pleasant things about themselves.!
Ultimately, they have developed)
an acute case of hypocrisy that j
may turn out to he fatal.
It seems to me that freshmen |
and other prospectives should read
the article. It is entitled "Our Vic- 1
torian Greeks." I submit, as I did
before, that a rushee should be j
credited with brains and given a
chance to, realize that there is
more to "going row" than being
able henceforth to show Sally some
mysterious letters with bright jew
els about them.
Hopefully, and with utmost re
spect, —A. Luninus, '20.
