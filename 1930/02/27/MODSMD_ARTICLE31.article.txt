DAILY blurb on tomorrow night's
play:
". . . sound of the surf breaking
against rocks and the wind moan
ing around the granite cliffs tunes
the audience to a high tension for
the expected melodramatic happen
ing."
What'll you bet?
But at least they'll writhe in
their seals.
Remember, this is in the luxuri
ously appointed Stanford Assembly
Hall.
I 'listing heroes: the backstage
guy who does the "moaning around
the granite cliffs."
It would be cruel to say that lis
tening to the play caused him to
moan.
"Granite" is hailed as a "drama
of t lie soil."
Good, clean soil, however.
The only questionable scene, ac
cording to another' DAILY story,
is described thusly:
. . she has a particularly good
scene in which she dresses up to
show off a new dress only to be
bewildered when Judith, becoming
jealous, makes her take it off."
We LiKE that "bewildered."
But perhaps we misunderstood.
We don't get these liner things of
life. We're just an old block of
Lundy granite, I hat's all.
