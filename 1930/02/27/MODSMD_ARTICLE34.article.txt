Although fists are expected to
Ily thick :iikl fast during all seven
torrid hunts between the Stanford
and California pugilistic- teams in
the Oakland Auditorium tomorrow
nighl, tin* feature ring engagement
is likely to he the last on I In; card.
For, to climax the evening of
amateur break-polishing bellig
erency, two football gladiators,
Pete Heiser and Carl Handy,
are scheduled to pummel each
other through two or more
rounds.
'I lull is, unless one of them turns
"Hi •" he ;i Fainting I'liil in dis
guise or I In 1 other is a small edi
tion of Primo Camera.
Or they may even knock
each other out simultaneously,
as each packs the kick of a
mule in his dukes!
The Berkeley fighter, who, by
the way, is next year's Cal varsity
gridiron captain, is said to have a
handy assortment of right hooks
and left jabs, which he demon
strated quite effectively only last
week-end against a big bruiser
Irom Davis Farm.
On Ihe other hand, Mr. Heiser
is a newcomer in this fisticuff rack
el, sill hough lie has already proven
thai lie can take care of himself
out in pigskin circles.
In fact, tomorrow's formal
encounter will be the stalwart
Farm lad's debut in the boxing
business. And last Friday's
workout was the first time he
ever exchanged blows—legiti
mately on a toped-in squaYe of
canvas.
However, lie has been sparring
around a lot since then with Mes
sers Harry Maloney, Myron Schall,
and Nulhin Voight, big gnus of the
local socking industry, and will be
all set to give and take plenty of
punishment tomorrow night.
Air. Glenn Scobey Warner, head
man of football activities about
these parts, was heavyweight cham
pion at Cornell during his under
graduate days. Perhaps Pete is
destined to follow in the Old Fox's
footsteps.
At any rate, Mr. Heiser will
be a candidate for one of Ed
gren's Miracles of Sports if he
comes out on top tomorrow.
For champion prize fighters, as
a rule, are not made in a single
week!

encounter will be the stalwart
Farm lad's debut in the boxing
business. And last Friday's
workout was the first time he
ever exchanged blows—legiti
mately on a toped-in squaYe of
canvas.
However, lie has been sparring
around a lot since then with Mes
sers Harry Maloney, Myron Schall,
and Nulhin Voight, big gnus of the
local socking industry, and will be
all set to give and take plenty of
punishment tomorrow night.
Air. Glenn Scobey Warner, head
man of football activities about
these parts, was heavyweight cham
pion at Cornell during his under
graduate days. Perhaps Pete is
destined to follow in the Old Fox's
footsteps.
At any rate, Mr. Heiser will
be a candidate for one of Ed
gren's Miracles of Sports if he
comes out on top tomorrow.
For champion prize fighters, as
a rule, are not made in a single
week!
