When the Golden Rear comes to
Rncina pool at 1 o'clock Saturday
i afternoon he will probably be shiv
j ering pretty freely. And not. with
out reason, for "the Cardinals are
expected to give the Bear his
twelfth annual tubbing.
Since that spring day in 1919
when Stanford varsity teams start
ed this long winning streak, they
have amassed 514 points to the lt>7
I counts earned by California swim
mers. With its strongest team in
several years, Stanford is favored
| to take first and second places in
every event Sal urday.
In the varsity contests, it will be
largely a question of battling be
tween Stanford swimmers, with
only the leavings going to the
Berkeley boys. Reggy Harrison set
a new Coast record in the 50-yard
sprint in the 1929 California meet,
and may lower that this week, but
under pressure from John McKel
vey. Card sophomore., rather than
l'rom any Bear splasher.
Sophomores Duel
Two Stanford sophomores will
vie for honors in the 220-yard free
style. Austin Clapp, Olympic Games
i star, and Frank Booth are due to
capture the first two places in that
event.
In the 100-yard breaststroke the
dueling will be between Ferd
Fletcher and Whitey Burns. Burns,
a junior, set the present Coast rec
. ord in this event at the California
meet last year. Fletcher is a fast
man from the 1929 Stanford fresh
man squad.
Diving fans will see another pair
of Stanford stars go through their
paces. Pete Desjardins, Olympic
champion, and Ed Throndson, who
last year defeated Wally Colbath,
national intercollegiate titleholder,
will try to excel each other in skill
and precision.
Frosh Events Close
Alternating with the varsity
events, the yearling contests will
furnish more' competition, with
less stellar performance. Tuppy
Gardner is the outstanding swim
mer on the Stanford freshman
team. He swims tiie 220-yard free
style, which happens to be the
event of Bill Houston, U.C.'s star
freshman. That race should be a
nip-and-tuck battle in the meet.
The only other California year
ling merman about whom much is
known is Fred Kothe, who was a
speedy sprinter for the Olympic
Club. Against him Ma sura Naka
yama and Sid Mitchell will furnish
strong competition.
Admission to men and women
students will be 25 cents on pre
sentation of student body card.
General admission will be 50 cents.
