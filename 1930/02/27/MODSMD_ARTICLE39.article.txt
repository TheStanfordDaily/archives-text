# THE 						BOSTON BONE-CRUSHER
## Eddie Shore, King of the Puck Chasers, Draws Crowds, Razzberries, and the Money for the Bruins 
### Feg Murray, '16 
What is it about these Boston
|
boys that makes New Yorkers boo
I them so? The old "Bronx Cheer"
is given with great gusto and aban
don when Jack Sharkey comes to
town, and when Eddie Shore of
the Boston Bruins blows in to
Madison Square Garden the rasp
berry chorus is terrific. Both are
great box-office attractions, partly
| because of their ability, partly be
cause of their unpopularity. As
"The Great Gobbo," Sharkey, says
"800, sucker, boo! I'll have plenty
of your money in my pocket when
1 leave here. So razz me all you
want to!"
Eddie Shore is the Babe Ruth
of Hockey, the King of the Puck
Chasers, the idol of some fans, just
a bum to some others. The greatest
box-office magnet in the history of
professional hockey, he draws
crowds 1(i the rinks as Ruth draws
them to the ball parks, and nine
times out of ten lie gives them
something to cheer about or razz
him for, too. If lie starts down the

I ice, there is a loud chorus of
I mingled boo's and "Attaboy's." If
; he doesn't lake the puck himself
i but passes it to a teammate, re
maining back where good defense
players are supposed to spend most
of their time, you hear one hockey
nut calling him "yaller" while an-
I other remarks, "smart player, that
j Shore."
He is a smart player, Shore is,
j and fast as a streak of lightning
: on skates. "The Galloping Cobweb"
they used to call him, and yet no
cobweb could ever lie as rough as
this Boston Bruiser is. Formerly
the bad man of hockey, he spent
j only 96 minutes in the penalty box
j last season as against 290 minutes
j during the two previous seasons.
' And just the other day he and his
j little pals, the Boston Bruins,
I played a whole game without a
; single penalty!
j Shore gets about .$15,000 a sea
i son for bumping Rangers, Senators,
Maroons, and other players around.
He joined the Bruins in 192(>. and
j is thirty years old.

I them so? The old "Bronx Cheer"
is given with great gusto and aban
don when Jack Sharkey comes to
town, and when Eddie Shore of
the Boston Bruins blows in to
Madison Square Garden the rasp
berry chorus is terrific. Both are
great box-office attractions, partly
| because of their ability, partly be
cause of their unpopularity. As
"The Great Gobbo," Sharkey, says
"800, sucker, boo! I'll have plenty
of your money in my pocket when
1 leave here. So razz me all you
want to!"
Eddie Shore is the Babe Ruth
of Hockey, the King of the Puck
Chasers, the idol of some fans, just
a bum to some others. The greatest
box-office magnet in the history of
professional hockey, he draws
crowds 1(i the rinks as Ruth draws
them to the ball parks, and nine
times out of ten lie gives them
something to cheer about or razz
him for, too. If lie starts down the

I ice, there is a loud chorus of
I mingled boo's and "Attaboy's." If
; he doesn't lake the puck himself
i but passes it to a teammate, re
maining back where good defense
players are supposed to spend most
of their time, you hear one hockey
nut calling him "yaller" while an-
I other remarks, "smart player, that
j Shore."
He is a smart player, Shore is,
j and fast as a streak of lightning
: on skates. "The Galloping Cobweb"
they used to call him, and yet no
cobweb could ever lie as rough as
this Boston Bruiser is. Formerly
the bad man of hockey, he spent
j only 96 minutes in the penalty box
j last season as against 290 minutes
j during the two previous seasons.
' And just the other day he and his
j little pals, the Boston Bruins,
I played a whole game without a
; single penalty!
j Shore gets about .$15,000 a sea
i son for bumping Rangers, Senators,
Maroons, and other players around.
He joined the Bruins in 192(>. and
j is thirty years old.
