## Saturday's Recital Offers Classic Selections 
### Ruth Miner 
Closely identified with practi
i cally every program of Sigrid One-
I gin, contralto who is to appear at
the Stanford Pavilion Saturday
night at 8:15, is her interpretation
of Schubert's "Der Erlkoenig."
The grim, fantastic tragedy of
; the song, which she will sing in a
i Schubert group with "Der Musen-
J sohn" (Goethe) 'and "Rastless
Liebe" (Testa), gives opportunity
for full emotional reading, accord
ing to press reports.
In regard to Schubert's, Haydn's,
j and Mozart's compositions, from
all three of which she will sing on
j Saturday, the New York American
I said:
"It was an artistic solace to hear
| Mozart treated with such fluency
j and finish as Mine Onegin put in
j several examples last evening, and
j to have Haydn and Schubert songs
' sound as though the performer
! considered them a labor of love
I and not merely a matter of adding
! a serious aspect to the program."
Lieder Singer
Mine Onegin's greater love lias
! always been for lieder singing, she
! has said, and to this end she lias
| devoted all her efforts, making an
( exhaustive study of the three great
I composers of the lied â€” Schumann,
j Schubert, and Franz.
Among Schubert's songs, sli"
ranks "Der Erlkoenig" as one of
j the greatest examples of the ro
! mantic school, which the music and
i the text are wrought in sympathy,
j li was written when the composer
| was IS and the now-famous classic
j was refused by one of the l'ore
' most publishing houses.
