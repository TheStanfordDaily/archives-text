# L.A.A.C HAS EDGE OVER CARD SQUAD IN COMING MEET
## Majority of Stanford's Points Must Come In Track Events 
### Ted DeMotte 
Wet weather and ineligibility are
likely to play havoc with the Card
tracksters when they meet the Los
Angeles Athletic Club here Satur
day afternoon. Since the clubmen
apparently have a majority of the
points in the field events sewed
up, it will be up to the Stanford
trackmen to overbalance that weak
ness with most of the points from
the cinders.
Dyer will have to be at bis best
to take Ray All' of the club in the
sprints. All' was junior A.A.If.
champion in the dashes last year,
and has made a fast start toward
another successful season. Prob
ably Dyer and All" will split tin*
points in the, sprints. Howell and
Giberson should grab most of the
other points. Paddock probably
will not compete.
Morrison, Shove, and Hables are
I likely to score a clean sweep for
Stanford in the 440. L.A.A.C.'s best
440 men were beaten by an Occi
dental College runner in almost 52
seconds, which will not figure
against t lie Cards. Neirsbach of the
club lias not' vet run the SBO as
fast as lias Atkinson of the Cards
this season, but it will be a close
race. Dick Wright may be another
Stanford entry in the SSO.
If Parker has been able to get
into condition, he will have a good
chance to win the mile. Burton of
the club is reputed to be a strong
runner, but he has not competed
in a meet this season.
Podge Smith will be up against
some of the champion hurdlers of
a few years ago in Maxwell, Grum
bles, and Pomeroy. Smith, how
! ever, should take both hurdles, for
he has slightly better pre-season
times. Nisbet, Bruginan, and Men
denhall will be lucky to score
against the club trio in the barrier
(•vents, though Nelson may place
in the lows.
Unless someone breaks a leg,
Stanford should win the relay. Last
Friday, handicapped by a cold day,
I four Card runners, Morrison, Shove,
j Hables, and MacDermott, ran a 51
fiat quarter to a blanket finish. It
j is a certainty that L.A.A.C. will be
unable to put a team on the track
that equals the Cardinal quartet in
speed.
Figuring on a rather optimistic
basis, L.A.A.C. would win by a mar
gin of a point or two. In such a
close meet, however, ability to win
odd points is usually a deciding
factor, and a single point for a
stray third place may swing the
balance to victory or defeat.

close meet, however, ability to win
odd points is usually a deciding
factor, and a single point for a
stray third place may swing the
balance to victory or defeat.
Wet weather and ineligibility are
likely to play havoc with the Card
tracksters when they meet the Los
Angeles Athletic Club here Satur
day afternoon. Since the clubmen
apparently have a majority of the
points in the field events sewed
up, it will be up to the Stanford
trackmen to overbalance that weak
ness with most of the points from
the cinders.
Dyer will have to be at bis best
to take Ray All' of the club in the
sprints. All' was junior A.A.If.
champion in the dashes last year,
and has made a fast start toward
another successful season. Prob
ably Dyer and All" will split tin*
points in the, sprints. Howell and
Giberson should grab most of the
other points. Paddock probably
will not compete.
Morrison, Shove, and Hables are
I likely to score a clean sweep for
Stanford in the 440. L.A.A.C.'s best
440 men were beaten by an Occi
dental College runner in almost 52
seconds, which will not figure
against t lie Cards. Neirsbach of the
club lias not' vet run the SBO as
fast as lias Atkinson of the Cards
this season, but it will be a close
race. Dick Wright may be another
Stanford entry in the SSO.
If Parker has been able to get
into condition, he will have a good
chance to win the mile. Burton of
the club is reputed to be a strong
runner, but he has not competed
in a meet this season.
Podge Smith will be up against
some of the champion hurdlers of
a few years ago in Maxwell, Grum
bles, and Pomeroy. Smith, how
! ever, should take both hurdles, for
he has slightly better pre-season
times. Nisbet, Bruginan, and Men
denhall will be lucky to score
against the club trio in the barrier
(•vents, though Nelson may place
in the lows.
Unless someone breaks a leg,
Stanford should win the relay. Last
Friday, handicapped by a cold day,
I four Card runners, Morrison, Shove,
j Hables, and MacDermott, ran a 51
fiat quarter to a blanket finish. It
j is a certainty that L.A.A.C. will be
unable to put a team on the track
that equals the Cardinal quartet in
speed.
Figuring on a rather optimistic
basis, L.A.A.C. would win by a mar
gin of a point or two. In such a
close meet, however, ability to win
odd points is usually a deciding
factor, and a single point for a
stray third place may swing the
balance to victory or defeat.
