# PROFESSOR OWENS UNOFFICIALLY SAYS STORMS INELIGIBLE
## 
### 
Allan Storms, transfer student
whose running in track has been
the sensation of the Friday meets
this quarter, will be ineligible for
this season, according to the state
ment of William B. Owens of Stan
ford, president of the Pacific Coast
Conference. Owens said that the
I case of Storms' eligibility had not
' come before him officially, but that
he had had correspondence on the
matter which showed that the lit
tle track star would be unable to
compete for the Cards.
Storms registered at U.S.C. and
later transferred to a junior col
lege, where lie secured most of the
credit he used to gain registration
here. It had been hoped that the
fact that he did not transfer di
rectly from U.S.C. would allow him
to compete here this year. How
ever, according to Conference
rules, the time he spent at South
ern California costs him a year
of varsity competition.
The ruling of the Conference is
a serious blow to the Cardinal
hopes in Hie U.S.C. meet, as Storms
has given promise of more than
being able to fill the place left
, vacant by the graduation of Alex
McKinnon. Storms' times this year
in the 88<> and the mile, at 1:58 3*5
and 4:35 2-5 respectively, were
'about, good enough to repeat the
performance of McKinnon last
'year, and his loss probably will be
keenly felt in every meet this year.
