# FROSH TRACKSTERS TO MEET ALAMEDA ALL-STARS MARCH 1
## 
### 
Providing there is a lull in the
j present storm, the Stanford fresh-
I men will make their delayed debut
i against the Alameda County All
- Stars in a track mej't on the Old
i Oval Saturday morning. Weather
i indications are none too favorable,
! and Hill Ellington, freshman coach,
expressed some doubt that his
tracksters would be able to open
the season this week either.
The yearlings have had little or
no opportunity to work out this
week. The soggy pits and slippery
j runways have prevented any of
j the jumpers from practicing. Those
who have been trying to keep in
condition on the track have been
forced to run in steady down
pours.
The Alameda County All-Stars,
! whom the freshmen are scheduled
! to meet, are a collection of the
; best high school track men from j

Ihe East Bay region. Emil Lamar,
coach at Berkeley High, is gath
ering the team from the Berkeley,
Alameda, Hayward, San Leandro,
and Piedmont high schools. Word
received from him last evening
stated that he expected to have
his men selected by today some
time.
Last year the Stanford freshmen
met a collection of these Alameda
County All-Stars and defeated
them, 84 to 158. This was in mid
season, however. The freshman
team this year has not yet tried
its strength in an outside meet.
