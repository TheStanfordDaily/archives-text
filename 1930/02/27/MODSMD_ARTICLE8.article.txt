# RYAN LABORATORY CONCENTRATES ON HIGH VOLTAGE TRANSMISSION
## 
### BY VERN CORDRY 
How In Kiivt' money and increase
efficiency in Hie construction of
power transmission lines lias long
been a problem confronting power
companies in the transmission of
"white coal" made by their hydro
electric power plants in the moun
tains to communities hundreds of
miles away, says Harrison J. Ryan,
director of the Ryan High Voltage
Laboratory.
To this problem the laboratory
is turning its attention to deter
mine the ideal diameter for power
conductor cables suitable for use
on commercial 220,000-volt high
tension lines, used in long distance
transmission. Various types and
sizes of cables will be tested and
their relative efficiencies tabulated.
Difficult Problem
The problem is llie difficult one
oi finding the point of maximum
efficiency itij transmission. There
is a point for each size of conduc
tor where additional power will be
largely thrown off into space. While
transmission lines can be made

J largo enough to allow very little
! loss, the great cost of large lines
j and towers to cafry their heavy
weight would counteract any sav
' ing in power losses.
I That this is a very real problem
j in the development of the nation's
I power resources is shown by the
I fact that conductor cables for a
! 200-mile power line carrying 220,000
'volts contain more than three niil
' lion pounds of copper and cost
'nearly $500,000. ICighl structural

Towers Constructed
Ten commercial type steel tow
i era have been erected adjacent to
the laboratory and specimen con
' ductors are being hoisted into place
for the experiment which will be
started within a fortnight.
Since the Ryan laboratory is
equipped to deliver power up to
1,200,000 volts, tests at even higher
Voltages than are used on the or
dinary commercial lines may be
made iu later experiments.
