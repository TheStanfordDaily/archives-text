# TAFT SUFFERS RELAPSE, FEAR DEATH HOURLY
## Physician States No Hope For Former President’s Recovery Is justifiable Breathing Becomes More Difficult; Circulation Is Slow; Heart Weakens 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 (/P).—
Death drew closer to William How
ard Taft tonight while this capital,
wherein his accomplishments as presi
dent and chief justice had won him
the world's respect, sadly awaited the
inevitable.
Time and again the physicians who
have been attending him since his col
lapse had been by his bedside. Re
lapses had been followed by partial
rallies, lint I )r. Francis i\. Hagner
said "there is no hope for his recov
ery: any improvement will only he
temporarily."
At the best the former president
has been given but a short time' to live.
His breathing is constantly more dif
ficult, his blood circulation is at low
ebb, his heart may give way at any
time and he can take very little nour
ishment.
\gcd 72, la ft suffered his serious
breakdown late in January and re
signed from the chief justiceship as
a result on February 3. That same
day he was brought hack to Washing
ton from Ashcvillc, X. C., where he
had been seeking to recupe. He was
pronounced "a very ill man'' then. For
a week or so an improvement in his
condition was reported every day.
Then the physicians for some time
said he was "unchanged." Finally, re
lapses began to recur and those close
t<> him have feared again and again
that the end was imminent. He has
been holding on to life by a slender
thread, however, and there was no
saying tonight just how long lie would
be able to endure the strain.
