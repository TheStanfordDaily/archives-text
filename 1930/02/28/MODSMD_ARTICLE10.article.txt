# CONSTITUTIONAL REVISION BODY FACES DIFFICULT TASK-COTTRELL
## 
### BY ELIZABETH CLARKE 
California's slain constitutional!
revision commit tec laces the prob
lem of giving to the people of !
counties a structure of government '
and the right to operate to fit the I
particular needs of each county.
The needs were summarized fov
lOdwin Attgell Cottrell, professor of !
political science and a member of j
the committee, yesterday.
"One of the chief problems of
county government, is to arrange i
for changes in the procedure and
salary of county offices that now j
necessitate bringing up 500 or ROO ,
detailed bills for consideration at
every meeting of the state legisla- j
lure," saifl Cottrell. "At present,
before any change in salary or the
number of men employed by coun
ty officials may be effected, a bill
must be presented.
"Work in state offices varies .
to the size of the county," Cottrell
continued. "Each county now em- \
ploys 75 men regardless of county {

population which ranges from 24:! j
on up.
"Farmers now control the legisla
tion in. the State of California, due
to the conflict of jurisdiction and
function in management and opera
tion of the metropolitan units. Two
thirds of the representalives lo the
state legislature are from rural
portions of the state.
"The home rule provision of 101 I !
grants county charters, iis in Los
Angeles, and city-county charters, i
as in San Francisco. Practically j
all have city charters. Hy this sys-j
teni, there may be any number of
taxing units superimposed upon
every county," Cottrell explained, j
"In San Mateo county alone there
are 72 different divisions for lax-
Ing.
"The revision committee is pro
vided for by legislature wliicti
names a commission to examine
all matters pertaining to home rule
j Bob Cathcart will portray the
Nameless Man, who is the mystical
J center of all action and whose sup
posed identity as the Devil causes
the tragedy and horror in the play.
Cathcart played the character of
Werle in "The Wild Duck" by lb
! sen. which was given on the cam
i pus last year.
Tom Watt, who has the part of
half-brother to Jordan and protec
tor of Judith, is familiar to cam
• pus audiences as Garry in last
year's junior opera, "Moving On."
He has also played the part of
! Jimmie Chard in "The Devil and
the Cheese." Although he has not
; previously been seen on the Stan
tord stage. Ray Lindraan has had
considerable theatrical experience
with the Pasadena Playhouse. He
i will be seen as Prosper's brother,
! Jordan, the island despot,
i Lucile Morgan, who was seen in
) the part of Thora in "The Ivory
I Door," will play the ingenue role
once again. As Penny Holt, she will
portray a young girl of fifteen. The
kindly philosophical clergyman is
j played by Douglas Gregg, known for
his work in "The Ivory Door,"
> "Moving On," and the Big Game
; Gaieties.
