"To determine the supply of wa
ter now available in the gravels

mountains and San Francisco bay
in Santa Clara county," is the ob

; proposed to be undertaken by com

Santa Clara county, as defined by
I Professor C. F. Tolman of the
Stanford department of geology.
A serious water shortage exists,
according to Professor Tolman,
and it is important to ascertain the
! exact areas in which the water
I famine is most acute. In order that
the communities may make any
