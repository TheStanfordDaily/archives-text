# GRADUATE STUDENT DEVELOPS NEW METHOD OF MAKING PAPER
## 
### PHILLIP HUMPHREYS 
I'tili/.ing materials heretofore re
igarded as waste, Carlyle Harmon, a
graduate student working in chemical
research, has developed a method of
making paper and wall hoard from the
hark and waste slabs of redwood
which were formerly burned at the
lumber mills in order to dispose of
them.
"In logging operations, approximate
lv 50 per cent of the redwood tree
is left in the forest and .W per cent
of the logs taken to the mill C
wasted,'' Harmon said yesterday in
an interview with the Daily. I he
process was originally conceived as a
| means to prevent the terrible waste
which has prevailed in \ears past. It
is directly in line with the national
policy of conservation of natural re
sources."
Harmon has samples of wall-board
and paper that he has made which
arc of better quality than the same
articles made from spruce or hemlock

, pulp, which is the usual .source ol 111 -
! terial for paper-making. "Whether or
not tin- proji-ct will he commercially
j feasible remains to he tested,' he said.
I'lie new paper is especially adapted to
the production ol paper hags and the j
! like.
"The sourer of material," Harmon |
i pointed out, "is unlimited. Ihe Itiin
her companies are reforesting their
â–  lands as fast as the timber is cut.
i Kcflwoi.nl trees grow very rapidly,
'comparatively: from 50 to 75 years
' is enough for the trees to reach a
.i/c satisfactory for lumbering. Both
' natural and artificial reforestation
keeps the. supply nearly equal to the
demand.
"Redwood contains tanic acid which j
may lu commercially valuable in the
tanning of leather," he declared.
Harmon has flour his undergraduate
work in chemistry at Stanford and is
now working for his doctor's degree,
tisintf this experiment as a basis for
his thesis.
