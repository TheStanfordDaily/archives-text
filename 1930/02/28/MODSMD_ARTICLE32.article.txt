# THE 						TEAPOT TEMPEST
## 
### 
.If you read that quaint Daily column %i which the pulsating j
vibrations of campus opinion are recorded, you know that a private
war of words is being waged.
( )ne belligerent is none other than a former editor of this great
lamily journal. I lie other is a young man who picked a hone with
the ex-editor because a certain campus opinion letter failed to appear ■
in print.
1 he good humor which oozed from each epistle indicates that j
neither combatant is taking himself too seriously. That is good.j
because the Daily enters the spirit of the war, and isn't taking it
seriously either.
Newspaper men form a clannish tribe, however, and the Daily
cannot resist rising to protect the memory of one whose word wast
law in its editorial sanctum in the dim. distant past.
I n the first place, there are several very good reasons why an!
editor may refuse to print contributions to his paper, lie mav be!
limited when it comes to space ; lie may see libelous material in the j
communication; he may honestly feel that good taste requires its I
suppression; he may honestly believe that it is poor judgement to I
arouse a hue and cry when such a hue and cry can't possibly bring j
about any good but will probably cause needless pain or embarrass-!
merit.
And after all. as the Daily pointed out yesterday, it is the edito-,
rial prerogative to withhold anything'—even for no better reason:
than just plain oneriness.
Let it be said —and hastily—that this prerogative is seldom if!
ever exercised for the last mentioned reason.
I nfortunately most people interpret every act of a newspaper
on the grounds that the editor is influenced by the fact that he is a
member of a fraternity, or lives in a hall, or comes from l-os An- 1
geles, or prefers blondes, or likes spinach.
Really, von know, editors aren't such terrible fellows. They may
present that appearance, but one who perpetually sits on a powder
barrel is likely to become haggard.
