# THE 						PROHIBITION STEED BUCKS
## 
### 
Dry "bronco-busters." after ten years of trying to break the
once meek steed, prohibition, are discovering, much to their surprise
and dismay, that the steed not only refuses to break, but is rapidly
becoming more wily. It's bucking now, more than ever, threatens
to unseat the once confident riders.
Not the least significant of recent trends was the granting to
wets the privilege of appearing before the I louse Judiciary Commit
tee last week to present their case. Dry opposition is becoming bet
ter organize!. Wet voices arc becoming more vociferous. Wet
statements are getting more confident. Ihe one weak point is that
the opposition has so far failed to agree on what shall be set up to
replace present prohibition, should the Volstead Act or the Kigh
leenth Amendment be repealed.
I'ractically the only reply which the dry contingent can make to
charges of drinking in high places, graft in the enforcement ranks,
corruption in office, and the wide-spread moral degeneracy of both
youth and old age is that the wets are dirty muckrakers. They have
apparently forgotten that such tactics were the strongest lever used
to secure the passage of dry laws. 'I'hev have completely reversed
their position, and muckraking has the advantage of easy proof.
In the days of the saloon, each corner was an argument; now
practically every road-house, hotel, and slums district is also an
argument, but in the opposite direction. Muckraking gets public
attention; the quoting of statistics does not.
What the exact opinion of the country at large is. no one can
say. The public spoke once and declared for complete aridity.
Whether it has changed its mind since, that time is impossible to
determine without putting the issue to a vote. Now the only guides
are the harangues of the advocates pro and con.
C ertainly it is time that something is done to throw uncolored
light on the situation so that some thought may be given to other
pressing problems. l»oth cases have been eloquently presented. It
is now time to call for a verdict.
A nation-wide poll of some twenty million voters is being made
by the Literary Digest in order to discover as nearly as may be pos
sible the sentiment of the electorate. No section of the country will be
disregarded; no class will be denied the right to express an opinion.
Mthough such polls in the past have been extremely accurate in
predicting the result of presidential elections, it is doubtful that the
present one will indicate very much.
With the present wet improvement in organization and propa
ganda, it is to be expected that the anti-prohibitionists will stir
themselves and cast a ballot while the drys will sit tight. Nothing
official will be achieved by the result, but it will form the basis on
which the country may build a few theories, using as material
something more closelv resembling facts than does over-worked
hot air.

With the present wet improvement in organization and propa
ganda, it is to be expected that the anti-prohibitionists will stir
themselves and cast a ballot while the drys will sit tight. Nothing
official will be achieved by the result, but it will form the basis on
which the country may build a few theories, using as material
something more closelv resembling facts than does over-worked
hot air.
Dry "bronco-busters." after ten years of trying to break the
once meek steed, prohibition, are discovering, much to their surprise
and dismay, that the steed not only refuses to break, but is rapidly
becoming more wily. It's bucking now, more than ever, threatens
to unseat the once confident riders.
Not the least significant of recent trends was the granting to
wets the privilege of appearing before the I louse Judiciary Commit
tee last week to present their case. Dry opposition is becoming bet
ter organize!. Wet voices arc becoming more vociferous. Wet
statements are getting more confident. Ihe one weak point is that
the opposition has so far failed to agree on what shall be set up to
replace present prohibition, should the Volstead Act or the Kigh
leenth Amendment be repealed.
I'ractically the only reply which the dry contingent can make to
charges of drinking in high places, graft in the enforcement ranks,
corruption in office, and the wide-spread moral degeneracy of both
youth and old age is that the wets are dirty muckrakers. They have
apparently forgotten that such tactics were the strongest lever used
to secure the passage of dry laws. 'I'hev have completely reversed
their position, and muckraking has the advantage of easy proof.
In the days of the saloon, each corner was an argument; now
practically every road-house, hotel, and slums district is also an
argument, but in the opposite direction. Muckraking gets public
attention; the quoting of statistics does not.
What the exact opinion of the country at large is. no one can
say. The public spoke once and declared for complete aridity.
Whether it has changed its mind since, that time is impossible to
determine without putting the issue to a vote. Now the only guides
are the harangues of the advocates pro and con.
C ertainly it is time that something is done to throw uncolored
light on the situation so that some thought may be given to other
pressing problems. l»oth cases have been eloquently presented. It
is now time to call for a verdict.
A nation-wide poll of some twenty million voters is being made
by the Literary Digest in order to discover as nearly as may be pos
sible the sentiment of the electorate. No section of the country will be
disregarded; no class will be denied the right to express an opinion.
Mthough such polls in the past have been extremely accurate in
predicting the result of presidential elections, it is doubtful that the
present one will indicate very much.
