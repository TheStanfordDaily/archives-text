EAST OF SUEZ—At the Geary
Theatre, San Francisco.
Sinuous, rustless, beautiful, with
a, husky voice that, thrills even
when ragged and iiarsh, and ;i i'ace
whose fired mouth and eyes accuse
life of injustice, mid yet defiantly
ask fur stili one more cliance at
happiness -Lenore I'iric gives an
unforgettable interpretation of the
role of the half-caste Daisy in
"l<]ast of Sue/."
The play is typical Somerset
Maugham work, with its plot de
veloped on the theme of the de
basement of human emotions
"somewhere east of Suez, where
the best is like the worst" where
conventions, loyalty, and decency
go by the board under the un
leashed violence of oriental na-
I tires.
Lenore I'lrie does not raise the
character of Daisy to great heights.
Especially in the tense scenes, Daisy
is nothing more than a hysterical,
self-willed, uncontrollable woman,
a. creature dominated solely by her
physical self. Yet. Lenore ITirit
put s a peculiarly gripping quality
of power into her portrayal of this
character. She shows her as hope
lessly and voluntarily degraded,
with no attempt at justifying her
to the audience, or giving the im
pression of a hitter conflict be
tween a higher and lower nature
(like that seen in the Sadie
Thompson of "Rain") which would
appeal to the compassion of the
audience. Nevertheless it is per
haps this unrelieved degradation
of Daisy and her ruined life that
more than anything else gives the
play its moving strength.
The ability cf Lenore TTlric is a
rather subtle, puzzling thing. It is
not in the high-pitched scenes,
where she is frenzied and sobbing,
and paces the stage, or throws her

| self on a couch prostrated with !
• motion that she is ul her best. j
Rather it in the lines thai she
.speaks in ;i dull, weary voice, tone
lessly, or lines that she givey with
o flat, emotionless finality that re
j veal the real art of which she is
capable. Here she is superb.
As sordid incident after incident I
is built up in the life of the half-
I caste whose love for the best
friend of her English husband
wrecks three lives —a feeling of i
growing depression pulls at Ihe
, spectator. Then "China claims her
own," the lin.il curtain fails, and
| the audience files out, slowly, made !
silent by the drably powerful real
ism of the play. Not even the sur- ,
passingly beautiful stage settings,]
or l lie very finished performance 1
'of Ihe supporting east is sufficient!
to offset llh* sheer heaviness of the
tragedy. —M. L. R.

life of injustice, mid yet defiantly

happiness -Lenore I'iric gives an
unforgettable interpretation of the
role of the half-caste Daisy in

The play is typical Somerset

Lenore I'lrie does not raise the

Especially in the tense scenes, Daisy
is nothing more than a hysterical,
self-willed, uncontrollable woman,
a. creature dominated solely by her
physical self. Yet. Lenore ITirit
put s a peculiarly gripping quality
of power into her portrayal of this
character. She shows her as hope
lessly and voluntarily degraded,
with no attempt at justifying her
to the audience, or giving the im
pression of a hitter conflict be
