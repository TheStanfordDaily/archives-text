The Editor, Sir:
It liiis been commonly thought
j by some gentle souls around these
parts that the dead should be
I treated with respect. But apparent

I truistic folks and there are occa-
I sions when even the dead must

So the old editor of Volume 7(1
| pulls himself out of his mouldy
! grave and rises to answer "A. hum
nus, '29," who yesterday wrote a
; Campus Opinion in your very esti
mable and readable sheet (lake it,
| dear fellow editor; no extra
I charge). To read "A. Lumiius'"
- letter makes this old ghost almost,
I wish lie were back in the DAILY
! shack, dying of "internal combus
t ion."
Let us refresh our memory. It
i seems as if this self-styled guard-
I ian of freshman souls in the mat
-1 ter of fraternity pledging was
rather hesitant about signing his
| Irue name to his masterpiece.
; Surely, Mr. Editor, he is not afraid
of an editorial ghost? Now, as we

j Law gr. 42U Enc.ina 14(18," also ,
secretary of the Executive Com-'
lmitt.ee, also a signer of the Ex
Committee's intelligent resolution,
j condemning the "deplorable Stan
; ford spirit" last quarter.
Mr. Hume's big gripe is that at
j the time of sorority pledging lie
i sent in a letter to the editor of
Volume 7(>, and said letter was j
withheld from publication. Now
just between you and me, Mr. Edi
tor, this Mr. Hume was trying to
'steal some of the thunder credited
'to Winston Norman, that jolly Old
Boy of Chaparral, who achieved i
(considerable fame on this campus |

by his "Ruble Hasttile" Bullsesßion.
Hut the difference between Mr.
Norman's article and Mr. Hume's
diatribe, was that Mr. Norman
could write. Also, Mr. Editor, you
ljuow that Mr. Hume is a debater
of some note, and lie had not been
in a debate for Home time, and all
debaters just have to blow off peri
odically. Hut that is just between
you and me.
After all it Is very easy for you
and me, Mr. Editor, to understand
that the Daily editor is the sole
judge of that which goes into the
Campus Opinion column, but of
course Mr. Hume is a member of
the Executive Committee —
Mr. Hume accuses us (editorial)
of being so proud of our Greek re
lationship that when we received
his letter we "drew under our shell
and began a form of internal com
bustion"because his letter "smacked
of the truth," Now if we wanted to
be nasty, we might point out the
silliness of Mr. Hume's charges for
he asserts that we continued to
"lam him with chunks of silence"
after we had begun the process of
"internal combustion." Hut such
acts are not natural according to
the laws of physiology or physics,
Mr. Hume.
We might also answer Mr.
Hume's charges by pointing to our
policy that Volume 7f! was run as
an A.S.S.I*. paper, and not as a
llall, or a Row, paper; by pointing
out that Hie activities of fraterni
ties were frowned upon editorially
more than once. We say we might
mention all these things, if we
wanted to be nasty, but as we don't
we'll roll iii) again in our shrouds
and sink into oblivion until some
other "A. Humnus" kicks out. tomb
