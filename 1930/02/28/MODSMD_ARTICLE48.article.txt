# WRENN PRESENTS MATERIAL ON FUNCTION, TRAINING, EMPLOYMENT OF ENGINEERS
## 
### BY ROBERT VAN ETTEN 
(Editor's Note. — 'litis is the eighth of a scries of weekly articles to be
published in the Stanford Daily concerning vocational fields open to eallcye
graduates. Material in this article was presented to a Daily reported by C.
Gilbert IVrcnn, secretary of the Committee on I'ocational Guidance, for
further information or personal discussion, sec ll'rcnn between one and two
o'clock daily in the Registrar's office.)

In this article the numerous
branches of engineering will be con
sidered as a single science and will
be considered in its three aspects—
the function, training, and employment
of engineers. Additional information
relative to engineering study may be
found in several research articles pub
lished in "The Journal of Engineering
Education" for December, 1925, and
September, 1926.
Functions of Engineering
Modern engineering developed from
the first use of engineering principles
in military operations. Civil engineer
ing, tlie first division to be recognized
as a branch separate from the military,
was established in 1852; mining engi
neering in 1871; mechanical in 1880;
electrical in 1884; and chemical in
1908.
The attitude of Dean Theodore
Hoover is that the. functional aspect
of engineering is of more importance
than the traditional classification. Each
historical branch of this science em
bodies these functional operations: (1)
research and invention, (2) valuation
and management, (3) design and con
struction, (4) operation and produc
tion, and (5) sales and distribution.
Of 3,000 engineers studied in 1925,
two years after graduation, 16 per
cent were in administration and sales,
12 per cent in teaching and research,
and 00 per cent in technical engineer
ing work. Of a comparative group
live years out of college, 49 per cent
were in executive management and
sales work.
Engineering Training
Of freshmen entering engineering
study, according to a recent study
covering 23 institutions, 33 per cent
were eliminated during the college
course because of scholastic failure.
Only 38 per cent graduated. The im
portance of a sound foundation in
mathematics is evinced in that a large
percentage of those entering college
with conditions in mathematics failed
to survive the first year.
Training required in the 169 engi
neering schools of this country ranges
from the more common four-year un
dergraduate course to the six years of
study required at Stanford. Ilere en
gineering training is not specialized
until the graduate years. Of 180 units,
00 units of humanistic studies and 20
units of electives are allowed. Only
25 units of strictly engineering courses
are required of undergraduates.
A recent, study of several thousand
engineering graduates showed that 80

[ per cent thought their cultural sub
jects well worth the study, and 25
per cent considered them indispensible.
| Fifty-one per cent believed serious
I omissions of commercial and business
| subjects had been made in their col
; lege course.
Employment
Eighty-two per cent of a group of
i engineers studied had been in engi
j neering work continuously since grad
; nation. Seven per cent began such
j work and then changed; while 11 per
| cent had been in non-engineering work
I continuously after completing their
; studies.
| Only 16 per cent secured their jobs
j through family connections, advertise
j meat, and employment agencies.
! Twenty-one per cent were solicited by
j their employers, 32 per cent located
! jobs through their college faculty and
| alumni, and 31 per cent through pcr
j sonal solicitation. On a scale of 10,
| most employers give a weight of five
! to scholastic grades, three to faculty
| recommendation, and two to personal
j interview.
Median salary of 7.200 graduates
I on graduation was $1,476, of those out
of college two years $2.100, out live
i years $2,860, out 10 years $4,000, and
| out 30 years $7,700. The median in
i conic of engineering teachers out of
| college 30 years was $5,700, of which
I $1,500 was earned outside of salary.
I The lower limit of the upper 25 per
! cent of all graduates was $15,000
i salary.
