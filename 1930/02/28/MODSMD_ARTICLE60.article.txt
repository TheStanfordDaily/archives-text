A Toss-Up At Best
If the skies haven't oozed
»too much since the Daily was
put to bed last night and the
clouds refrain from dribbling
at the chin long enough to
day for the numerous lakes in
the Stadium to dry up into
mere puddles, the Stanford-
L.A.A.C. cinderpath struggle
will be run off per schedule,
according to Mr. Don E. Lie
bendorfer, chief blurb manu
facturer for the B.A.C.
Postponement of the anticipated
clash would he most disappointing.
Only intramural track meets should
be put off on account of wet weather.
\nd said delay by the elements
would do anything but enhance live
( ardinal'> chances in a future per
formance with the old timers from
l.os \ngcles. I'or these club outfits
seem to grow in size and strength
every day.
The L.A.A.C. head men en
ticed Fred Sturdy, ex-Yale
pole vaulter, to fly across the
continent for to m or r o w's
meet. In another week, they
might see fit to charter a
whole air derby of champions
out to the Farm!
It looks like everybody and his
brother is gunning for Mr. Robert L.
Templeton this spring. The many jeal
ous coaches about the land unani
mously agree that the local mentor
has been Lord of the Oval long
em )Ugh.
Which is strange, to say the least,
as Mr. Tcinpleton's proteges are likely
to he the underdogs in a number of
track duals this year.
Tomorrow's cinder skirmish
is no exception, even though
Mr. Braven Dyer and a raft
of other southern sports
scribes have conceded the
meet to Stanford by anywhere
from one-half to three-quar
ters of a point margin.
At any rate, Tiik Daily, being a
conservative sheet, dopes the meet a
toss-up at best. "Dink" will come out
on top, provided he gits the breaks
and some of his neophytes deliver the
goods. Otherwise, chalk one up for
the hoary grayheards.
Perhaps Two New Records
Although most of the advance bal
lyhoo concerning tomorrow's season
track opener has been about the shot
putting trio and how Messrs Harlow
Rothert, Herman Prix, and Eric
Krenz are going to toss the bronze
pel let clear out of the Stadium, an
other strong arm event may actually
steal the show.
In other words, when Eric
C. W. Krenz and Bud Houser
start flipping the discus about,
a new world's record might
very easily go by the boards!
The veteran Houser, former record
holder, always chucks best when the
going gets toughest, while the Farm
weight heaver is due to land the dis
cus out around the 170-foot mark.
On his lirst toss of the season the
other day, Houser sailed tlie platter
out some 145-odd feet.
Last spring Krenz became
world champion of the discus
event with a meager flip of
163 feet. Since then he has
had his mind set on 170 feet.
"If I fail" to toss the discus out
that far, it is quite likely that Here
La Horde will."
Vet, with all his confidence, Krenz
is not over-nonchalant about tomor
row's workout. Taking on I'rix and
Houser in one afternoon is no light
lask.
No wonder the curly-headed
Dutchman hasn't been able to
gulp down his usual l'J lbs. of
potatoes at each meal of late!

pel let clear out of the Stadium, an
other strong arm event may actually
steal the show.
In other words, when Eric
C. W. Krenz and Bud Houser
start flipping the discus about,
a new world's record might
very easily go by the boards!
The veteran Houser, former record
holder, always chucks best when the
going gets toughest, while the Farm
weight heaver is due to land the dis
cus out around the 170-foot mark.
On his lirst toss of the season the
other day, Houser sailed tlie platter
out some 145-odd feet.
Last spring Krenz became
world champion of the discus
event with a meager flip of
163 feet. Since then he has
had his mind set on 170 feet.
"If I fail" to toss the discus out
that far, it is quite likely that Here
La Horde will."
Vet, with all his confidence, Krenz
is not over-nonchalant about tomor
row's workout. Taking on I'rix and
Houser in one afternoon is no light
lask.
No wonder the curly-headed
Dutchman hasn't been able to
gulp down his usual l'J lbs. of
potatoes at each meal of late!

A Toss-Up At Best

put to bed last night and the
clouds refrain from dribbling
at the chin long enough to
day for the numerous lakes in
the Stadium to dry up into
mere puddles, the Stanford-
L.A.A.C. cinderpath struggle
will be run off per schedule,
according to Mr. Don E. Lie
bendorfer, chief blurb manu
facturer for the B.A.C.
Postponement of the anticipated
clash would he most disappointing.
Only intramural track meets should
be put off on account of wet weather.

would do anything but enhance live
( ardinal'> chances in a future per
formance with the old timers from
l.os \ngcles. I'or these club outfits
seem to grow in size and strength

The L.A.A.C. head men en
ticed Fred Sturdy, ex-Yale
pole vaulter, to fly across the
continent for to m or r o w's
meet. In another week, they
might see fit to charter a
whole air derby of champions
out to the Farm!
It looks like everybody and his
brother is gunning for Mr. Robert L.
Templeton this spring. The many jeal
ous coaches about the land unani
mously agree that the local mentor
has been Lord of the Oval long
em )Ugh.
Which is strange, to say the least,
as Mr. Tcinpleton's proteges are likely
to he the underdogs in a number of
track duals this year.
Tomorrow's cinder skirmish
is no exception, even though
Mr. Braven Dyer and a raft
of other southern sports
scribes have conceded the
meet to Stanford by anywhere
from one-half to three-quar
ters of a point margin.
At any rate, Tiik Daily, being a
conservative sheet, dopes the meet a
toss-up at best. "Dink" will come out
on top, provided he gits the breaks
and some of his neophytes deliver the
goods. Otherwise, chalk one up for
the hoary grayheards.
Perhaps Two New Records
Although most of the advance bal
lyhoo concerning tomorrow's season
track opener has been about the shot
putting trio and how Messrs Harlow
Rothert, Herman Prix, and Eric
Krenz are going to toss the bronze
