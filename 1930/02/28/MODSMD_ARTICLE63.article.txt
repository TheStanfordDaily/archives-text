# Cardinals Are Underdogs On Track Tomorrow
## L.A.A.C. ATHLETES HOLD EDGE OVER CARD CINDERMEN Houser May Not Compete; Templeton Discards Starting Blocks 
### Ted DeMotte 
Though Boyd Comstock's L.A.A.C.
trackmen are slight favorites to
win the meet when they encounter
the Cards in the Stadium tomorrow
afternoon, hopes of a Cardinal vic
tory rose last nigh! with the re
port that Hud Houser was unlikely
to compete for the Mercury in the
discus event. Houser's almost cer
tain three points might very eas
ily be the track meet. Whether-or
not he competes, the meet will
probably be so close that anything
may happen.
Latest reports from.the south
land indicate that while Burton of
the club has a good reputation as
a mile and 880 man, he has not
run in a meet this year, and must
therefore he a very dark horse in
I tomorrow's struggle. Critics in Los
Angeles are giving the mile to
Parker of Stanford, and most, of
them are giving the meet to the
Cards by a margin of about a
point, which is as close as a track
meet can be without a tie. Also,
none of the critics make their pre
dictions without plenty of reserva
t ions.
Club Has 37-Man Team
Coach Boyd Comstock of the
Mercury announced yesterday that
thirty-seven men would probably
make the trip to Palo Alto for the
meet. His best sprinters will be
Bay All - , junior A.A.C. champion in
the dashes, and Howe, a young I
' sprinter who has not had much
chance to show his wares so far.
; None of the club 440 men can be
figured to cause much trouble l'or
1 Johnny Morrison, though they may j
take a third either from Shove or j
Hables. Chapman >s the best bet ;
of the Mercury in the 440.
Henry Chauca, an Indian from
the Sherman Institute, has been
favored to take the two-mile from
Brown of the Cards. Chauca is used
to longer distances, and there is a J
question as to whether he will be i
able to set a pac! last enough to j
win. If Brown is able to keep close j
to Chauca, he has' a very good j
chance to outsprint the Indian at j
the tape. Dink says that Brown j
doesn't know his pace, and that, he
can run the two-mile faster than
' he has so far.
Cards Not To Use Blocks
Because of the, uncertainty of the
starting block situation, Templeton
will not use blocks for his sprinters
and hurdlers tomorrow as he had |
planned earlier in the season. Tem- j
pleton still thinks that there is I
some mix-up in the East, and .that |
the blocks will be found legal.
Berry looked good in the pole I
vault last night, and seems to be I
getting out of his slump of the past j
few weeks. He will have little |
chance of better than a third if j
Sturdy of the club is in shape, and j
lie may have trouble scoring at all,
since Comstock is bringing one of
the Smith boys with him. The
Smith brothers, as they are called,
are usually good for L'{ feet in the
vault.
Uothert. and Krenz took a short
workout in the shot last night, and
both tossed the ball past the fifty
toot line. The best throw was made
by Rothert at about . r >() feet t!
inches. All but the warming-up
tosses went past the forty-nine-foot
line. Brlx, of the club, is favored
to win the event, but no one will
he greatly surprised if either Krenz
or Rothert takes first. If the gal
lery of spectators at the practice
last night is any criterion, the shot
put will be the big attraction of
the meet Saturday, and it. certainly
should he the feature competition
of the season in the shot.
Altogether, every event with the
exception of the javelin has possi
bilities of upsets, and it would be
a rash dopester who would try to
pick place-winners.
