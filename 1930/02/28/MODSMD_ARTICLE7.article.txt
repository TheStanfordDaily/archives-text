# TARDIEU FAILS TO REORGANIZE FRENCH POLITY
## Gap Widens Between Left And Right Parties in French Chamber Herriot Refuses Support For New Ministry 
### 
PATHS, Feb. 27. (/P)â€”The gap i
I between the policies of the dead- !
locked right and left parties in the !
French Chamber oL' Deputies wid
ened today as former Premier An- i
<lre Tardieu attempted to reassem- |
I ble a government to succeed the
i short-lived Chautemps cabinet.
The defeat of Chautemps still
rankles in the minds of the powci- j
ful left groups, particularly the j
radical-socialists, who are the j
largest single party in the chain- j
! her, and their opposition became |
open and decisive today.
Herriot Declines Aid
Working with the aim of form- j
ing a "wide concentration cabinet," j
Tardieu attempted to bring the
radical socialists into tlie fold by j
offering the Ministry of Foreign |
Affairs to former Premier Edouard |
1 Herriot. Herriot, however, holding |
Tardieu responsible for the defeat j
of Camille Chautemps and backed
by his party's refusal to cede the J
Ministry of the Interior to another
party, refused tlie post and pledged
I his entire party against Tardieu.
Even the acceptance of the Min
istry of Foreign Affairs by Aristid?; j
Briand, announced at Tardieu's j
headquarters tonight, does not j
greatly mitigate Tardieu's diffi- ,
culty. A solid left, the radical-so-j
eialists, socialists, and communists,
; will probably In; arrayed against
the center and right coalition.
The political crisis is almost cer- I
j tain to last for several days. It is ;
' not only a ministerial crisis, but a
light that has brought the chief
political divisions in France head- j
011 against one another.
