WASHINGTON, I'cli. 27 I/P).â€”
| Secretary Wilbur's advisory commit- I
; tcc on radio education has found that |
one of the chief objections to micro- :
| phonic instruction i-* that "educational {
! broadcasts, sandwiched in between j
sales talks on cigarettes and lip sticks, !
need to be so sugar-coated they lose j
most of their educational value."
The committee, composed of educa- |
tors, radio officials and prominent !
broadcasters, has been given the task j
iof evolving methods for tlie promo- j
tion of educational broadcasting to !
schools and classrooms throughout the j
country.
Summarized, the objections raised lo 1
radio as a medium of bringing educa- ;
tion to adults are :
The average person does not want |
education and resents the implication i
! that be needs it: the effects of educa- j
' tional talks are largely passive; radio j
talks encourage the fallacy that listen- j
' ing signifies the acquisition of learn- !
ing, and the radio bars all teachers ex- |
cept those who have good delivery.
