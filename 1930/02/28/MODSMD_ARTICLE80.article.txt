third, and went down for a count of
three from a hook to the head. Shar
, key was warned for hitting low. and
; Scott went down again for a count of
six after a left to the body. Another

after helping Scott to his corner for
an examination. The crowd went into
an uproar as the fight was halted. The
Briton manifested agony, but resumed
the fight. After a few more punches
with the Englishman tiring rapidly,

Risko of Cleveland and Victorio Cam
