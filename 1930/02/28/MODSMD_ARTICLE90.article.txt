## 
### BY RAWSON HOLMES 
This is Ilw fifth of a series of opinions on Ihe proposed amendment to tin
Honor i ode uliieh will establish a system of optional proctors, by those men
u'lio are best aide to comprehend the situation, namely professors who han
larye classes.

"I would halo to see the Honor
Code go the \v ty of the many other
Stanford traditions that have fallen
into disrepute," commented Henry
Stow Anderson, Assistant Profes
sor of Economics and Assistant Di
rector of Citizenship, to a Daily re
porter yesterday.
"Before any change is to be ef
fected." Anderson declared, "an
investigation should be made as to
whether the proportion of students
: who cheat in examinations is large
enough to warrant it. IL' such is
found to be (lie case, drastic ac
tion should of course be taken. Hut
I am in absolute agreement with
j Professor Morn-son, that a compro
mise measure would be impractical.
"Personally, I have never had
any Honor Code violations in my
own classes brought to my atten-

I tion," he continued. "It does not
| necessarily follow that there lias
I been no cheating going on. how
' ever.
"Of course it. must be remem
bered that even with the proctor
system, some dishonestly written
papers may occur," he staled. "Un-
I less examinations are given accord
■ ing to the ancient custom in China,
1 whereby students were clad in
loose-fitting robes that could be
j easily searched, and put into sepa-
I rate cells before being given their
| questions; it is almost, impossible
j to stop all forms of cheating.
"Personally, I would be extreme-
I Iv sorry to see stalking proctors
I take the place of mutual trust be-
Mween faculty and students, that
1 constitutes such a line part of Stan
: ford life at the present, time," Pro
| fesosr Anderson concluded.
