### BY PHILIP SPACE 
What with our long absence, we
haven't published our daily laugh
at the expense of the local theatri
cal ad writers.
But, bo it known, "The Sky Hawk
j is—
"The talking screen's most
brilliant thrill-tilled llying I'ea
| ture to date.
A drama you will honestly
| want to see twice!
Enough thrills to satisfy any
! excitement-seeker.
Don't Miss This!
Fox Movietone's Gilt to the
Air-Minded Age in this Spec
tacular Drama of Daring Bird
lnen."
The same picture, advertised in
j the Palo Alto Times was:
a breath-taking drama en
twined with the most beautiful
love story ever seen in talking
I pictures.
Damning with faint praise.
Say, what'dya suppose they're
{trying to do —KID us?
We saw a talking picture the
other night and it wasn't very good
I at all.
j There must be some mistake.
. . . because there was "Burning
, Up," with Richard Arlen. It must
i have been great. The ad said so —
"Richard Arlen as 'Suicide'
I Larrigan is Great!
It. is Fast —and How!
A Brilliant Comedy!
Action — Romance!
Don't Miss This One!"
i Beside all this the Stanford Dra
| matie Council's ad seems almost
1 diffident,
"Granite WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
become the STANDARD by which
the EXCELLENCE of future STAN
! FORD PRODUCTIONS will be
JUDGED." (Caps are NOT ours.)
' Also:
{ "This play will become a classic
of I lie Stanford Theatre, and as
feucli deserves your support."
No doubt.
Whistling in the dark?
THINGS WE DON'T CARE
TO KNOW
"What became of King Stephen.
Who killed "Cock Robin."
What happened to the Cavalier
of Ripafratta.
The exact hardness of Old Lundy
! Granite.
