## Rothert Takes Shotput in Duel With Krenz, Brix; Three Better 51 Feet Smith, Dyer Score Double Wins; DeMers Victor in Javelin With 211 Feet 
### Ted De Motte 
Piling up an early lead in the
shot put and on the track, Dink
Templeton's squad of track and
field artists managed to nose out
the powerful L.A.A.C. team in
meet at the Stadium Saturday by a
(1914 to <il% score. The outcome of
the meet was in doubt to the final
event, the relay, which went to the
Cards after a thrilling finish,- in
which Morrison barely missed be
ing "picked" at the tape by Worden
of the Club. All of the times were
good, considering the soft condi
tion of the track.
Stanford led from the first event
when Parker, after trailing Burton
of the Club most of the way, un
corked a strong finish around the
last turn to win by a margin of
fifty yards. Wright was not in con
dition, and lost a close finish to
Goodheart of the Mercury for third.
The time, 4 minutes 3(1 1-5 seconds,
was Parker's best of the season.
Dyer Takes Sprints
Dyer took both sprints from the
Mercury in even times, with the
Cards scoring all tho points in the
furlong. Alt', favored by many to
take the 100 from Dyer, could get
110 better than third in that race.
Giberson took second in the 100
and third in the 220, showing plen
ty of promise. Morrison finished a
yard back of Dyer in the 220 after
taking the 440 in 50 4-5 seconds.
Shove and Hables took second and
third to shut out the clubmen.
Brix was the victim of an upset
when Rothert tossed the shot 51
feet 8 inches for first place. On
his last put,'Rothert. sent the shot
eight inches past the 51-foot line.
Krenz followed with a toss of 51
feet 1-S of an inch. Brix then made
his final effort, the "oall sailing out
51 feet 4% inches for second place.
It was the first time in track his
tory that all three places in a dual
meet had been over 51 feet, and is
a record equaled only by the com
petition at the 1928 Olympics.
Roger Smith proved himself an
able successor to Ross Nichols
when he ran away with both hurdle
races. His time in the highs was
15 3-10 seconds, and in the lows he
made the exceptionally fast time
of 24 5-10 seconds. The club team
had not been willing to concede
either first to Smith, boasting as it
did, such great hurdlers as Pome
roy, Maxwell, and Grumbles. Both
of Smith's wins were clean-cut,
with little doubt as to the winner
from the start. Nisbet of the Cards
surprised with a third place in the
highs after a layoff of nearly three
weeks.
The 880 and the two-mile were
easy for the clubmen, who took
first and second in both. Niersbach
took first, while Lovejoy, former
Trojan, had too much for Atkin
son's fighting finish and took sec
ond. with the Card runner third.
After Brown had apparently beaten
off the challenge of Chauca and his
Indian teammate Elmo, the latter
cut loose with one of the best
sprints ever seen here to come up
from third place around the last
turn and pass the leaders. Brown
slowed up and was passed by
Chauca before he could gather
again for a linal effort, finishing
third.
Captain Eric Krenz came back
strong to win t lie discus with a
near-record heave of 160 feet 1V&
inches. Grey took second with 144
feet (i\i> inches, and Brix nosed out
Jones of the Cards for third at
142 feet S J ,4 inches.
Walker, who had been reported
suffering from an injured back,
seemed all right in taking first in
the broadjump with a leap of 23
feet !) inches. After barely fouling
a 24-foot jump, Butler of the Cards
had to be content with second at
23 feet t>'i inches. Dowell showed
that he is returning to his c/ld-tiine
form by leaping 23 feet 5>4 inches,
after fouling on a 21-foot jump. Al
len of the Cards went into a four
way tie for first, in the highjump
af (i feet 1-16 of an inch. None of
the Stanford vaulters were able to
clear 12 feet, and the Mercury took
;i clean sweep with Sturdy and
Graham in a tie for first at 13 reel.
Smith of the club took the odd
point at 12 feet.
Another club sweep was regis
tered in the javelin, when DeMers
tossed the spear 211 feet 3 inches,

followed by Eaton at I!>7 feet 3V\
inches, and Hoover at 1!)3 feet IVa
j inches. None of the Card spearmen
were able to throw to the 170-foot
i mark.

Dyer Takes Sprints
Dyer took both sprints from the
Mercury in even times, with the
Cards scoring all tho points in the
furlong. Alt', favored by many to
take the 100 from Dyer, could get
110 better than third in that race.
Giberson took second in the 100
and third in the 220, showing plen
ty of promise. Morrison finished a
yard back of Dyer in the 220 after
taking the 440 in 50 4-5 seconds.
Shove and Hables took second and
third to shut out the clubmen.
Brix was the victim of an upset
when Rothert tossed the shot 51
feet 8 inches for first place. On
his last put,'Rothert. sent the shot
eight inches past the 51-foot line.
Krenz followed with a toss of 51
feet 1-S of an inch. Brix then made
his final effort, the "oall sailing out
51 feet 4% inches for second place.
It was the first time in track his
tory that all three places in a dual
meet had been over 51 feet, and is
a record equaled only by the com
petition at the 1928 Olympics.
Roger Smith proved himself an
able successor to Ross Nichols
when he ran away with both hurdle
races. His time in the highs was
15 3-10 seconds, and in the lows he
made the exceptionally fast time
of 24 5-10 seconds. The club team
had not been willing to concede
either first to Smith, boasting as it
did, such great hurdlers as Pome
roy, Maxwell, and Grumbles. Both
of Smith's wins were clean-cut,
with little doubt as to the winner
from the start. Nisbet of the Cards
surprised with a third place in the
highs after a layoff of nearly three
weeks.
The 880 and the two-mile were
easy for the clubmen, who took
first and second in both. Niersbach
took first, while Lovejoy, former
Trojan, had too much for Atkin
son's fighting finish and took sec
ond. with the Card runner third.
After Brown had apparently beaten
off the challenge of Chauca and his
Indian teammate Elmo, the latter
cut loose with one of the best
sprints ever seen here to come up
from third place around the last
turn and pass the leaders. Brown
slowed up and was passed by
Chauca before he could gather
again for a linal effort, finishing
third.
Captain Eric Krenz came back
strong to win t lie discus with a
near-record heave of 160 feet 1V&
inches. Grey took second with 144
feet (i\i> inches, and Brix nosed out
Jones of the Cards for third at
142 feet S J ,4 inches.
Walker, who had been reported
suffering from an injured back,
seemed all right in taking first in
the broadjump with a leap of 23
feet !) inches. After barely fouling
a 24-foot jump, Butler of the Cards
had to be content with second at
23 feet t>'i inches. Dowell showed
that he is returning to his c/ld-tiine
form by leaping 23 feet 5>4 inches,
after fouling on a 21-foot jump. Al
len of the Cards went into a four
way tie for first, in the highjump
af (i feet 1-16 of an inch. None of
the Stanford vaulters were able to
clear 12 feet, and the Mercury took
;i clean sweep with Sturdy and
Graham in a tie for first at 13 reel.
Smith of the club took the odd
point at 12 feet.
Another club sweep was regis
tered in the javelin, when DeMers
tossed the spear 211 feet 3 inches,

followed by Eaton at I!>7 feet 3V\
inches, and Hoover at 1!)3 feet IVa

were able to throw to the 170-foot
i mark.
Piling up an early lead in the
shot put and on the track, Dink
Templeton's squad of track and
field artists managed to nose out
the powerful L.A.A.C. team in

the meet was in doubt to the final
event, the relay, which went to the
Cards after a thrilling finish,- in
which Morrison barely missed be
ing "picked" at the tape by Worden
of the Club. All of the times were
good, considering the soft condi
tion of the track.
Stanford led from the first event
when Parker, after trailing Burton
of the Club most of the way, un
corked a strong finish around the
last turn to win by a margin of
fifty yards. Wright was not in con

a record equaled only by the com

Roger Smith proved himself an
able successor to Ross Nichols
when he ran away with both hurdle
races. His time in the highs was
15 3-10 seconds, and in the lows he
made the exceptionally fast time
of 24 5-10 seconds. The club team
had not been willing to concede
either first to Smith, boasting as it
did, such great hurdlers as Pome
roy, Maxwell, and Grumbles. Both
of Smith's wins were clean-cut,
with little doubt as to the winner
from the start. Nisbet of the Cards
surprised with a third place in the
highs after a layoff of nearly three
weeks.
The 880 and the two-mile were
easy for the clubmen, who took
first and second in both. Niersbach

Trojan, had too much for Atkin
son's fighting finish and took sec
ond. with the Card runner third.
After Brown had apparently beaten
off the challenge of Chauca and his
Indian teammate Elmo, the latter
cut loose with one of the best
sprints ever seen here to come up
from third place around the last
turn and pass the leaders. Brown
slowed up and was passed by
Chauca before he could gather
again for a linal effort, finishing
third.
Captain Eric Krenz came back
strong to win t lie discus with a

feet (i\i> inches, and Brix nosed out
Jones of the Cards for third at
142 feet S J ,4 inches.
Walker, who had been reported
suffering from an injured back,
seemed all right in taking first in
the broadjump with a leap of 23
feet !) inches. After barely fouling
a 24-foot jump, Butler of the Cards
had to be content with second at
23 feet t>'i inches. Dowell showed
that he is returning to his c/ld-tiine
form by leaping 23 feet 5>4 inches,
after fouling on a 21-foot jump. Al
len of the Cards went into a four
way tie for first, in the highjump
af (i feet 1-16 of an inch. None of

shot put and on the track, Dink
Templeton's squad of track and
field artists managed to nose out
the powerful L.A.A.C. team in
meet at the Stadium Saturday by a
(1914 to <il% score. The outcome of
the meet was in doubt to the final
event, the relay, which went to the
Cards after a thrilling finish,- in
which Morrison barely missed be
ing "picked" at the tape by Worden
of the Club. All of the times were
good, considering the soft condi
tion of the track.
Stanford led from the first event
when Parker, after trailing Burton
of the Club most of the way, un
corked a strong finish around the
last turn to win by a margin of
fifty yards. Wright was not in con
dition, and lost a close finish to
Goodheart of the Mercury for third.
The time, 4 minutes 3(1 1-5 seconds,
was Parker's best of the season.
Dyer Takes Sprints
Dyer took both sprints from the
Mercury in even times, with the
Cards scoring all tho points in the
furlong. Alt', favored by many to
take the 100 from Dyer, could get
110 better than third in that race.
Giberson took second in the 100
and third in the 220, showing plen
ty of promise. Morrison finished a
yard back of Dyer in the 220 after
