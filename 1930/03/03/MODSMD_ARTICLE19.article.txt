# ONEGIN DISPLAYS FLEXIBILITY AND WIDE RANGE OF VOICE IN RECITAL
## 
### BY CATHERINE SPAULDING 
Coming up to all expectations,
! Sigrid Onegin thrilled an enthusi
| astic audience in the Pavilion Sat
â–  urday night, her interpretation of
Schubert's "Der Erlkoenig" rank
| ing as one of the finest things given
i on the campus this year.
Her exceptionally wide range of
I tone, and the astonishing fiexibil
' ity of voice enabled her to sing
j Rossini's Aria trom "II barbiero de
i Siviglia" in its original contralto
key, and she charmed an apprecia
! tive audience with her selections
j of Mozart and Haydn. To call
1 Madame Onegin a contralto would
j be an unwarrantable limit since
| she trills, sings fioratura, and ac
i eomplishes- other feats trespassing
' the domain of the coloratura
I singer.
From her many requests, Mad
amu Onegin chose the Gypsy Son*;
! from Carmen, and put such feeling
and acting it no the selection that
ii was possible to picture the debut
which she made in that role with
Caruso. She also sang a Students

Love Song, which was taken from
;m old German folksong. She eon-!
eluded her program with an infor
j mal goodbye song using English
' words of her own to the tune of
! an old folksong.
Pianist Good
Hermann Rentier at the piano
1 gave a good accompaniment and
his solos were well received by the
audience. He showed excellent |
technique and feeling in "Span-1
; ischer Tana." his own composition, j
; lie gave as his encore Rachmanin- i
| <;fl"s "Prelude in C Sharp Minor." !
Leaving directly after the con- |
1 cert for Los Angeles, Sigrid Onegin j
; will continue her concert series in ,
j the South. This is the sixth Ameri- j
1 can season for the singer, and al-1
' though her American tours are de- j
voted exclusively to recital appear- j
an<<s, in Europe she appears regu
larly each season in the opera
houses of Berlin and Vienna, and is
in demand for appearances in the
opera houses of other continental
musical centers.
