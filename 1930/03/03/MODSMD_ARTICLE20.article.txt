# TAFT LINGERING NEAR DEATH AS VITALITY EBBS
## Former President's Strong Physique Clings to Life In Slowly Losing Battle Bedside Bulletins Report Wane of Two-Day Rally; Condition Grows Weaker 
### 
i WASHINGTON, March 2. (A 3 ) -
William Howard Taft continued to
linger near death today while dis
ease slowly sapped the resistance
! of a powerful physique that with
stood the rigors of forty years of
service to the nation.
The bulletins from the bedside
|of the distinguished patient re-
I corded a slow decline from a rally
which in the last two days had
brought relief, feeble flashes of the
good humor that had left an in
delible imprint upon the minds of
the American people during a long
career.
Twice in the day, his physicians
called, and each time they left the
sick room saying that his condi
tion had not changed since last
night. At that time he had been re
ported weaker than earlier yester
day, when, he rallied sufficiently to
recognize those about him and to
speak to them in a wisp of a voice.
To those who visited him in the
sick room, however, the patient,
seemed weaker, as if the vitality
which had bolstered him so long
were slowly crumbling.
