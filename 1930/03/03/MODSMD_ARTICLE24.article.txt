# DISTRUST IN THE HIGH PLACES
## 
### 
There arc many who doubt the wisdom and sincerity of Idaho's'
Senator Borah, one of the most bitterly criticized of this country's;
statesmen.
15ut in a radio address Saturday evening Senator Borah said
some things that seemed both wise and sincere. He was discussing I
the London naval conference, in which millions are pinning their
hope for a new era of peace for the World.
"If these governments and their representatives do not suffi
ciently realize at this time the necessity of taking some risk in order
to lift this weight of armaments from their peoples, I venture to!
sr.v that in due time they will have ample notice of their mistake."
the Idaho lawmaker warned.
"Hut the world at this time is more heavily armed than at the
beginning of the World War." lie continued. "I insist there can be j
no security under such circumstances. This condition of affairs is!
bound to create the same suspicion, the same uneasiness, and the!
same distrust, and in the end the same result. . . . Indeed, what?
in the last analysis, is at the bottom of this hesitancy to reduce
armaments, if not distrust:"
This distrust of which Senator Borah speaks, is it the distrust of
millions who are staggering under the titanic cost of armaments; i
of the millions whose blood will be spilled on the world's next j
battlefields ?
Xo, these millions—European and American, Occidental and j
Oriental—are praving sincerelv that the London Conference will
succeed.
Where, then, is this distrust being bred?
Where else but in the places higher up? The. silk-hatted diplo-I
mats and the be-medalled naval officers of one nation distrust the j
silk hatted diplomats and the be-medalled naval officers of the '
.
other nations. It is not the people, it is those who make wars from
behind shiny mahogany desks and in obliquely couched "notes" to j
other powers.
When he said "that in due time they will have ample notice of j
llieir mistake."' the western statesman sounded a note of warning j
that the delegates to the London Conference will do well to heed, j
The world docs want peace, and if the diplomats gathered there j
in London do not secure peace, they will be guilty of one of the i
greatest crimes ever committed. i
