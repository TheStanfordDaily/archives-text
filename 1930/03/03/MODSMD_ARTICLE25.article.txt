# FOR THE FIVE-HUNDRED
## 
### 
A proposed amendment to the new A.W.S. constitution will be
brought before the women's living groups tonight for discussion.
This amendment, if passed, will enlarge the membership of the
legislative, body known as Women's Conference by ten women.
These ten women, five sophomores and five juniors, will sup
posedly represent the interests of their respective classes and serve
as ;i unit to tie up women's class activities to the regular A.W.S.
duties. The imposing number of TK\ has been suggested as the
strength in numbers will encourage those who might otherwise be
silent, to speak their minds concerning the legislative problems.
A "younger" viewpoint is desired.
The motive behind this amendment, class unity, is certainly a
worthy one. Classes are indistinct groups at Stanford until the last
quarter of the senior year when the spirit of .good old '00 is
rejuvenated from its three-year lethargy and thrives in the Com
mencement air. Hut the unification of classes might well take place
under A.S.S.I*.
The Daily asys whether the addition of ten more women to a
legislative body of twenty-two is going t»> affect this purpose of
class unity. Will this group in any way give the class angle on
matters or will a group of thirty-two simply be a large and cum
bersome legislative body—still representing the living groups as
Women's Conference does now?
I he Daily asks whether the addition of ten 11 Tore women to a
that the addition of SIX members, three sophomores and three
juniors, is quite adequate. And. in order to put any life into this
amendment, if it is passed, it will remain the responsibility of the
A.W.S. president and her advisors to make these new members an
effective link between AAV ,S. and the classes. Otherwise six or ten
new members will be merely figureheads—so many more people who
have to attend meetings.
