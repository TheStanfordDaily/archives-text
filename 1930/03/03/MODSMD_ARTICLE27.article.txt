GOD'S MAN. By Lynd Ward. |
Plimpton Press, Norwood, Mass.
1929.
Habitually books are thought of
as purely mental phenomena: ap
preciation of an ordinary book is
dependent on the quality und de
gree of mental effort involved
alone.
The catch lies in I lie effort part.
Really good books are worth it, of
course. However, sometimes there
is a need for spiritual stimulation
that books are too heavy and too
solid to satisfy, even while works
of art and music are too intangible.
It. is a familiar feeling. A few
weeks ago a book called "God's
Man" was published that is nearer
the answer to this need than any
thing I have seen of books.
"God's Man" lias no predecessor
in the novel field. It is dime in
wood-cuts, and from cover to cover
there are perhaps four printed
words. The wood-cuts represent
a sequence of external incidents
in the life of an artist, and are i
grouped under five headings • —
"The Brush," "The Mistress," "The !
Brand," "The Wife," and"The !
Portrait." These titles are the sole
guide to the reader's interpreta- ;
tion. Beyond that he wanders in a
maze of speculation and even after
turning over the last page, can
only ask "What does it all mean?"
In this lies the unique fascination
of tlie book. It is conducive of more '
thought at less effort than any
ordinary novel ever published.
The simplest cuts are the most
powerful. There is one which
shows a narrow street in a great
metropolis. The walls of the build- j
ings rise sheer and windowless, ob- !
scured by dark shadows. In the j
middle of the street, the figure of j
the artist —the sole figure in the
picture — staggers forward with
bowed bead, his size dwarfed by |
the buildings. A merciless white- .
ness of light around this form i
throws into full relief all its pitiful
abjectness. A pigmy himself, be- t

i fore him his shadow stretches out
in gigantic outline —like a symbol
of the block guilt that is to lie
across the path of his life.
The starkness of such a picture
grips the imagination far more ef
fectively than the most eloquent
word descriptions of human sin
and suffering.
All through this remarkable book
the beauty of the plates engrosses
the eye, while their mystery chal
lenges tlie mind. "God's Man" can
be taken up again and again, and
each time the story will seem a
little different, the amazing faces
and hands will have a new mean
ing. It is an incomparable book
for a dull hour.

DEVIL MAY CARE —At the New
Stanford Theatre.
And now we have Napoleon talk
ing! For Itamon Novarro's latest
picture, "Devil May Care," is laid
in the stirring Napoleonic era at
the time of the Emperor's depar
ture to Elba.
Almost any of these
! times is sure of a success. There
is a certain glamour about Bona
' parte-which never fails to fire the
imagination. With the added sup
port of Ramon Novarro's beautiful
voice and some very excellent set
tings, "Devil May Care" does more
than achieve this success.
Novarro plays the role of Ar
mand, an officer the Emperor.
When Napoleon is in Elba, his of
ficers plot for his return. The con
spiracy is discovered, and Armand
is forced to hide from t lie Royal
| ists. There are of course many nar
row escapes, thrilling rides on
horsebacks, and a beautiful royal
i ist heroine. The heroine is lovely
but is handicapped by a voice that
is not so lovely. Novarro manages
to make up for any lack in this
respect. His quality and manner of
! singing is probably of the best ever
heard on the silver screen.
