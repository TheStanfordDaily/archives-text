# Campus Opinion
## THANK YOU DEAR, ETC. 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
May it please tlie editorial prero
gative: One More Word on Eniry.
It was a trifle disheartening to a
believer in the dignity and excel
lence of the ex-editor's I.Q. to dis
cover that as a method of justify- |
ing one of his erstwhile policies he j
intimates that A. Lumnus is some
what of a rogue and an imbecile. 1
1 daresay his conclusions are cor
rect, but they are not reasonably
arrived at nor in point.
More as a matter of questioning
the accuracy of the mood in which
Mr. Emry wrote his letter, than as
a personal retaliation, 1 beg to
make several observations. I wrote
my original letter not at the time
of sorority rushing: I wrote it
after sorority rushing was all done.
I did not sign the Ex Committee's
intelligent resolution condemning
the "deplorable Stanford spirit":
the signing was erroneously re
ported as unanimous, for I was not
even present at the meeting which
concocted it. If Mr. Emry will refer
to the official minutes for Novem
ber 12, 1029, instead of to the tiles
of the sometimes-mistaken Volume;
Tf», he will find this to be true.
As for attacking a ghost, 1 can
only plead that it is often done.
A wrong, if a wrong, does not im
prove wiih time. A mule has been
known to save its kick for seven
years. An elephant, goes the legend,
may harbor its wrath for more
than a decade. Then why should
Mr. Emry be astonished that 1,
alson an animal, should nurse my
vexation for a matter of months?
My motive in withholding my ac
tual name was somewhat trite, but
true: I wished to avoid the annoy
ing accusation, which someone is
ever willing to make, that the
writer merely seeks individual pub
licity and wants his name in the ,

paper. Mr. Emry, however, did not j
balk at announcing my name him- j
self, and then proceeding-with the j
accusation.
I'll admit that Mr. Emry quoted j
the bawl-out correctly, though I j
think lie took rather unfair advan- i
tage of me in telling everyone that I
1 came from South Dakota. And 1
apologize for being a debater, al- i
beit. has-been.
Mr. Emry veers toward the point
when he remarks that it is very
easy for him and the present edi
tor to understand that "the Daily
editor is the sole judge of that
which goes into the Campus Opin- '
ion column." That is also very easy !
for ME to understand, Mr. Emry. |
Youl taught it to me. But what 1
You taught it to me. But what 1
all the time is whether or not he
SHOULD BE the sole judge; espe
cially when his judgment suspi
ciously resembles whim, and he :
neglects, as you neglected, to give
warning that Campus Opinion will
henceforth be censored. The pres
ent editor has the better of you in j
'his respect. (Take it dear, etc.)
1 hope, Mr. Emry, you will be- j
lieve me sincere in stating that I
recognize that an editor is custom
arily a mucli-misunderstood per
son. He necessarily wearies of lis- 1
tening to advice from people who
know one-tenth as much about his
job as he does. However, other
people are sometimes misunder
stood. too. May 1 not wish, then,
that the mud we have mutually
thrown contains no rocks? Ten i
years hence or twenty, we may not
feel obliged to notice the taunts of
others, but now youth must have
its fling. Perhaps, after all, we are
not such bad fellows!
Respect fully,
Robert, A. Hume,
unofficially and alone.

rect, but they are not reasonably
arrived at nor in point.
More as a matter of questioning
the accuracy of the mood in which
Mr. Emry wrote his letter, than as
a personal retaliation, 1 beg to
make several observations. I wrote
my original letter not at the time
of sorority rushing: I wrote it
after sorority rushing was all done.
I did not sign the Ex Committee's
intelligent resolution condemning
the "deplorable Stanford spirit":
the signing was erroneously re
ported as unanimous, for I was not
even present at the meeting which
concocted it. If Mr. Emry will refer
to the official minutes for Novem
ber 12, 1029, instead of to the tiles
of the sometimes-mistaken Volume;
Tf», he will find this to be true.
As for attacking a ghost, 1 can
only plead that it is often done.
A wrong, if a wrong, does not im
prove wiih time. A mule has been
known to save its kick for seven
years. An elephant, goes the legend,
may harbor its wrath for more
than a decade. Then why should
Mr. Emry be astonished that 1,
alson an animal, should nurse my
vexation for a matter of months?
My motive in withholding my ac
tual name was somewhat trite, but
true: I wished to avoid the annoy
ing accusation, which someone is
ever willing to make, that the
writer merely seeks individual pub
licity and wants his name in the ,

paper. Mr. Emry, however, did not j
balk at announcing my name him- j
self, and then proceeding-with the j
accusation.
I'll admit that Mr. Emry quoted j
the bawl-out correctly, though I j
think lie took rather unfair advan- i
tage of me in telling everyone that I
1 came from South Dakota. And 1
apologize for being a debater, al- i
beit. has-been.
Mr. Emry veers toward the point
when he remarks that it is very
easy for him and the present edi
tor to understand that "the Daily
editor is the sole judge of that
which goes into the Campus Opin- '
ion column." That is also very easy !
for ME to understand, Mr. Emry. |
Youl taught it to me. But what 1
You taught it to me. But what 1
all the time is whether or not he
SHOULD BE the sole judge; espe
cially when his judgment suspi
ciously resembles whim, and he :
neglects, as you neglected, to give
warning that Campus Opinion will
henceforth be censored. The pres
ent editor has the better of you in j
'his respect. (Take it dear, etc.)
1 hope, Mr. Emry, you will be- j
lieve me sincere in stating that I
recognize that an editor is custom
arily a mucli-misunderstood per
son. He necessarily wearies of lis- 1
tening to advice from people who
know one-tenth as much about his
job as he does. However, other
people are sometimes misunder
stood. too. May 1 not wish, then,
that the mud we have mutually
thrown contains no rocks? Ten i
years hence or twenty, we may not
feel obliged to notice the taunts of
others, but now youth must have
its fling. Perhaps, after all, we are
not such bad fellows!
