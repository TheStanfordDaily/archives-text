# TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY AT STANFORD..
## FROM THE DAILY PALO ALTO OF MARCH 3, 1905 
### 
i On March 1 Mrs. Jane Lathrop
[ Stanford, widow of United States
i Senator Stanford and founder of
I Stanford University, died ;it 31:40
| o'clock at the Moana Hotel in Ho-
I nolulu. Suspicious circumstances
1 surrounded the death. She was
taken ill at 11 o'clock and said:
"I have been poisoned!" Her last
I words were "This is a horrible
death to din!"
Mrs. Stanford went to Honolulu
j February 21 because of an attempt
made in San Francisco to poison
! her. Investigation of this case was
being carried on by the San Fran
cisco police at. the time of her
death.
Before retiring, Mrs. Stanford
took a dose of bicarbonate of soda
which she purchased in San Fran
cisco. It was reported that the
i soda contained strychnine, but th"
report could not be verified.
On Hie afternoon of her death
Mrs. Stanford went to a picnic and
ate heartily. She ate no dinner,
however, and retired about llÂ» o'-
clock. At II o'clock a guest of the

hotel who occupied an adjoining
room heard Mrs. Stanford groan
ing, and running to the room found
her lying on the floor. Dr. H. Hum
phreys was summoned immedi
ately and finding Mrs. Stanford in
convulsions applied the quickest
remedy, but it was impossible to
save her life.
Mrs. Stanford's condition seemed
to indicate strychnine poisoning
and between convulsions sin* said
that it was the second time an
attempt had been made to poison
her.
President David Starr Jordan
and Timothy Hopkins sailed im
mediately for Honolulu to bring
the remains back to Stanford to
be buried in the Mausoleum with
tliosi> of her husband and son.
