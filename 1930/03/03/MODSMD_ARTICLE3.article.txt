# WOMEN DISCUSS A.W.S. CHANGES
## Living Groups to Bring Up Revision Tonight 
### 
Proposed A.YY'.S. constitutional
changes which would add junior
and sophomore class representa
tives to Conference and thus co
ordinate women's class activities
with A.W.S. will be discussed at
house meetings tonight.
Conference members will be in
structed tonight by their living
groups on this matter together
with that of a change in the com
position of Round Table and will
vote on the amendment at a meet
ing Wednesday, a unanimous de
cision being necessary lor it to
pass Conference.
In accordance with the provi
sions of the constitution, Professor
E. A. Cottrell of the Political Sci
ence department has approved the
change as satisfactory for the cam
pus.
At present, Conference is a leg
islative body representative of liv
ing groups: the ten sorority presi
dents, the head of the Commuter
i Club, the Roble president, and in
I addition two seniors and three jun
j ior« from the Hall. •
New Representatives
Under the proposed system sen
' iors would be represented by liv
| ing groups, and juniors and soplio
! mores by classes, so that Roble's
j representation as a living group
would correspond to that of the
houses in being composed entirely
of seniors. Five members elected
, at. large from each of the two
S classes would also be included, in
j an effort to make class organiza
tions more consistent from year to
j year and to make them the con
i necting link of classes with A.W.S.
Sophomores would be given rep
| resentation on Conference for the
I first time, in order, according to
\ Edith Jayne, head of the constitu
l tional committee, to secure the
| sophomore viewpoint and to give
i second-year women experience in
student government:.
Three changes in the composi
tion of Round Table, discussion
group of activity leaders, have also
been recommended by the com
mittee. The president of Roble
Club and the woman member of
Dramatic Council are proposed as
additions to the membership, while
after this year women's editor of
Quad would no longer serve.
