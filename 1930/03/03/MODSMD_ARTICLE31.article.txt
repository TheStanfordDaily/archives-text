Dramatic Note:
The drier the bread, the more
applesauce.
And, by the way, did you ever
notice the striking similarity be
tween "applesauce" and "applause."
We hope we will not have to
say any more about this matter.
... If you know what we mean.
Daily Picture ('aption:
COAST STEAMER PAST
AGROUND ON PEA
COCK SPIT
At last, a mucilage that sticks!
Rare, but effective.
A humble occupation, indeed, for
| such a proud bird.
Of course, the difficulty comes
'in getting the peacocks to spit.
Union coffee was at last resorted
to.
DAILY want ad:
For Rent â€”Pleasant sunny room
near bath. Outside entrance.
Quiet. Call Uryant St.
Well, maybe it's all right, but it
looks funny.
Pretty vague, if you ask us.
Of course there is much to be
said for a bath with an outside en
trance.
But we don't see how the land
lord can guarantee quiet in a bath
tub.
And then JUST how near is this
| "pleasant sunny room" to the bath?
!
I Is it across the street, or next
| door?
And is the view good?
It must he, or they wouldn't hint j
j at it in the advertisement.
