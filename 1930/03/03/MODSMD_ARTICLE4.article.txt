# NEW MINISTRY HAS APPROVAL OF DOUMERGUE
## Second Cabinet by Tardieu Awaiting Confidence From Deputies Many Parties Represented In New Government 
### 
PARIS, March 2. (JP) —Premier j
Tardieu's second cabinet was of- j
ficially constituted and approved i
by President Doumergue this morn- i
ing and he will introduce it to the !
Chamber of Deputies Wednesday.
| If he gets a vote of confidence he i
j will probably send the French dele- j
gation back to the London Naval |
Conference Thursday. He himself, |
j however, may have to postpone his I
i departure.
All the groups in Parliament ex- j
cept the Socialists and Commun- !
ists, are represented in the new j
ministry. There are even a cabinet i
i minister and an under secretary of i
■ state from the radical Socialist j
; party, whose leaders, Camille Cliau- j
j temps, Edouard Herriot, and Edou- j
j ard Daladier, are bitter enemies of i
j Premier Tardieu.
' The general impression in parlia- j
j mentary circles is that though Tar- i
| dieu has not been wholly success- !
| ful in forming the cabinet of "wide '
j Republican concentration" he* de- I
| sired, his second ministry is one of j
I the most representative from the I
parliamentary viewpoint that has
governed France in recent years.
Owing to the general public dis- !
satisfaction with the two recent |
political crises, the ministry has a i
good chance of weathering the j
storm in the chamber Wednesday. I
