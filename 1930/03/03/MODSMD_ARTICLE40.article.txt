AN EYEFUL AT THAT
Winning a track meet by less
tluin two yards to spare is an un
usual event on the Farm, home of
national champions, world record
holders, and Mr. Robert L. Tern
pleton.
Vet, that is exactly what
happened on Saturday last,
when Stanford U. upset the
favored L.A.A.C. cinder patri
archs. In fact, it was a free-for
all right up to the last lap of
the relay, until Long John Mor
rison came to life on the home
stretch to outgallop the old
timers' anchor man to the tape
by said 72-minus inches.
Which was quite different from
lust year's debacles, usually cinched
by the home boys long before the
relay was even considered.
And what is more, several
other oval engagements are
likely to be decided by a cou
ple of inches this spring.
At least, that is the humble opin
ion of Mr. Walt Christie and Dean
Cromwell, coaches of the Golden
Hear and Trojan, respectively, both
of whom mingled .with the common
spectators at Saturday's matinee.
However, these scouting, pro
letarian mentors may be most
unpleasantly surprised on the
second and third week-ends in
April. For Stanford's weak
events —the distance jaunts,
javelin, and pole vault —will
not be so anaemic on those oc
casions!
Human After All
Byt the way, the Daily reporter
"was astounded to see several of
the faculty athletic advisors
"whooping it up" as the relay men
battled for first-place honors.
These erudite schoolmasters
have professed with indifference
that they do not give a rap whether
Stanford U. wins or not.
But when it looked as though
Morrison was about to be
picked by the L.A.A.C. anchor
man, they forgot all about
pedagogic manners, waving
their hats and caps, yelling vo
ciferously, and jumping up and
down on the Stadium seats
like collegiate schoolboys!
Tight As Well As Fickle
Yet, the campus fans are becom
ing tighter than Scotchmen in the
matter of applauding. It seems as
though an athlete has to break a
world record, at least, to get any
sort of an ovation from the rabble
in the stands.
Although Harlow Rothert,
Herman Brix, and Eric Krenz
all put the shot out past the
51-foot mark during Saturday's
festivities, the multitude kept
on munching peanuts as though
nothing out of the ordinary
was taking place.
And when Eric C. W. Krenz
hurled the discus into the ozone
for 160 feet, one and one-half
indies, the crowd didn't even so
much as let out a squeak.
Which feat of Mr. Krenz was the
most outstanding of ihe day, the
second farthest toss in the history
of platter flipping.
It is interesting to note that
Mr. Krenz used an L.A.A.C.
discus on every try. Now, per
haps, the scandalmongers down
around the land of Troy will
stop chattering their line of
petty slander about the Farm
Dutchman using trick para
phernalia to establish his un
usual marks!
