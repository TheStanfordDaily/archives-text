### Reid Briggs 
Stanford varsity swimmers Sat- |
urday afternoon decisively defeat- !
ed the University of California j
mermen in Encina pool. The Cards j
won both free-style and medley i
relays and took the first two places ;
in every other event, winning 02 j
to 13.
Three Pacific Coast intercolle
giate records were broken. Austin
Clapp in the 220-yard free-style cut
more than six seconds from the j
former record held by Ogden j
Driggs. The new time is 2 minutes I
20.6 seconds. In the next event j
Frank Booth bettered another j
Driggs record, navigating the 100-
yard back-stroke in 1 minute 6.2 i
seconds. i
Harrison Breaks Record
Wally O'Connor's old record of
56 seconds for the 50-yard sprint
fell before Reggy Harrison's de
termined dash. But it was the hard ■
pressing of John McKelvey ot
Stanford that forced Harrison to j
cover the distance in 55.2 seconds. ;
Another close contest was the ]
100-yard breast-stroke, in which ,
Ferd Fletcher narrowly touched ;
out Whitey Burns, who made the j
present record in that event at the
California meet last year. Burns'
time then was 1 minute 12.4 sec
onds, just one second faster than
Fletcher's time yesterday.
Captain Ed Throndson took the
diving contest easily. The real
struggle was l'or second place, be
tween Bill Campbell, Stanford
sophomore, and Dempsey, U.C.'s
best diver. It was close, but Camp
hell's superior performance won.
U.C. Frosh Win
While the Stanford varsity
demonstrated clear superiority
throughout, the freshman meet
was closely contested from start
to finish. The Bear cubs downed
the Card yearlings by the narrow
margin of one point, 38-37.
The. relays were divided, with
Stanford dropping the free-style
but capturing the medley race. The
Redshirt 'babes took four first
places to the Bears' two, but lost
the majority of the seconds. Tuppy
Gardner in the 220 and Captain
Brad Pease in the back-stroke were
responsible for two firsts for the
Cards. Two more came when Art
Simons took the breast-stroke and
George Fraser won the diving con
test.
