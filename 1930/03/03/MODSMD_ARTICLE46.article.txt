# Danny McAuliffe Won Twenty-One Fights, Was Kay-oed, And Became One of the Country's Finest Jockeys
## 
### 
To look at " him, you'd never
j dream that he was a reckless rider
of galloping thoroughbred- horses,
! much less an ex-prizefighter. His
| cherubic countenance belies the
fact that lie won twenty-one pro
fessional fights as a flyweight boxer
before being knocked out, and then
took up the career as a jockey,
i And, since serving his apprentice
' ship, he has won many times more
i than twenty victories in the saddle,
j and has also been knocked out in
a bad spill that nearly ended his
racing days.
Danny McAuiiffe is his name,
and he rides for the Belair Stud,
j and he knows how to boot 'em
( home in front, too. T remember his
| swell ride on Flying Gal, in the
i Schuylerville Stakes of five and a
i half furlongs at Saratoga last sum
mer, when he put up one of the
strongest finishes of his career to
bring the daughter of Sir Galahad
3rd and Filante in ahead of W. R.
I Coe's Conclave.
McAuiiffe is twenty-seven years

old, even if he looks fifteen. Ten
years ago he was a promising box
er. After' once kissing the canvass,
however, lie decided to look for
further fields of endeavor, and a
New Orleans sportsman gave him
the chance to be a jockey. All of
this happened in Kentucky, which
is Danny's home state.
McAuiiffe came east in 1925 to
ride under the care of Sunny Jim
Fitzsimmons who trains for the
Belair Stud, the Wheat ley Stable,
H. W. Maxwell, and other private
• owners and big stables, and made
' good with a bang. In fact the be-
I loved Fitz simply raved about his
I work and predicted a bright fu
ture for him, which little predic
tion Danny more than verified. Mc-
Auiiffe has courage, brains, a good
seat, good hands, and lives a clean
life; whrtt more can a jockey have?
One of his biggest triumphs was
winning the Flash Stakes at Sara
toga in 1927 on Distraction, but he
has many other "million - dollar
rides" to his credit.

mer, when he put up one of the
strongest finishes of his career to
bring the daughter of Sir Galahad
3rd and Filante in ahead of W. R.
I Coe's Conclave.
McAuiiffe is twenty-seven years

old, even if he looks fifteen. Ten
years ago he was a promising box
er. After' once kissing the canvass,
however, lie decided to look for
further fields of endeavor, and a
New Orleans sportsman gave him
the chance to be a jockey. All of
this happened in Kentucky, which
is Danny's home state.
McAuiiffe came east in 1925 to
ride under the care of Sunny Jim
Fitzsimmons who trains for the
Belair Stud, the Wheat ley Stable,
H. W. Maxwell, and other private
• owners and big stables, and made
' good with a bang. In fact the be-
I loved Fitz simply raved about his
I work and predicted a bright fu
ture for him, which little predic
tion Danny more than verified. Mc-
Auiiffe has courage, brains, a good
seat, good hands, and lives a clean
life; whrtt more can a jockey have?
One of his biggest triumphs was
winning the Flash Stakes at Sara
toga in 1927 on Distraction, but he
has many other "million - dollar
rides" to his credit.
