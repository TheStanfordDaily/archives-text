### 
Two eminent basketball artists
by the names of Joujon-Roche and
Bowers spelled disaster for El Tori)
as Sigma Chi nosed out the club
men 21-19 in a hectic, hard-fought
contest played in the pavilion Fri
day afternoon. By virtue of this
victory Sigma Chi will meet the
winners of the Breakers-Cardinal
engagement in the finals of the in
tramural basketball championships.
Prospects looked dubious for the
fraternity five as the final quarter
started with El Toro holding a 17-
14 lead. Undaunted,, the Sigm,-i
Chis produced a spectacular spurt,
Bowers sinking two beautiful long
shots and Joujon-Roche sneaking
under the bucket for a set-up and
making good a free throw. El Toro
was held to two free throws in this
final period.
Expert Defensives
Expert defensive work by both
teams kept down the score. Sigma
Chi started off with a rush, making
five points before the clubmen
broke into the scoring column. At
the close of the first quarter, how
ever. the fraternity men led only
by 6-5. Half-time score favored El
Toro 11-10.
In addition to playing a bang-up
game at guard, Joujon-Roche took
high scoring honors with 11 points.
Crandall proved El Toro's big gun
on offense, contributing four field
goals to the cause. Hubbard and
Brown played their usual effective
game at guard for the clubmen
and forced the Sigma Chis to do
their shooting at long range.
The Cardinal - Breakers contest,
postponed from Friday, will be
played in the pavilion tonight at
seven.
