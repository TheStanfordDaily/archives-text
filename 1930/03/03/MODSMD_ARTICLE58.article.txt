Winning but two of the seven
bouts from California Friday
night in the Oakland Auditorium.
Stanford boxers fell before the
onslaught of the Bears in the sec
ond meeting of the two boxing
squads. Two weeks ago, the Card
boxers won from their rivals by
the same score.
Fred Johnson, Stanford light
heavy, scored a technical knockout
to win his bout from George Gar
ner, veteran Berkeley battler. Gar
ner, coast collegiate champion in
the light-heavyweight division for
the past two seasons, discovered
that Johnson packed too much
dynamite in his right hand, and
although the Bear scrapper had
been the favorite because of his
superior experience, Johnson's
hand was raised in the second
round.
