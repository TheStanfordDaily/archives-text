formula, to find any happiness in
i such a desolate spot.
Direction Excellent
The moment when Judith exhorts
(he powers of darkness to bargain
with her was pervaded with an
eerie spirit and is one Helvenston
can well be proud of. The artistry
of Helvenston's direction was ap
; parent in a series of striking stage
pictures, and the production
throughout revealed his undeniable
ability.
Stover's set of the Lundy ex
castle room was formidable and |
| gave an impression of massiveness
j and age. The fire's shadows were
j a very nice piece of work. Joe Gor
' don's lighting was excellent. A fit
ting atmosphere for the play was
provided by a nineteen-piece Stan
ford orchestra, directed by Daniel
■ Bryant.
The remaining four characters
were not consistently even in their
interpretations. Lucile Morgan as
! Penny with her naturalness was
refreshing, although she slipped in
and out of her character. Tom Watt ,
j managed to get into his role thor
oughly by the third act, and did
it very well from then on. The wed
ding scene was particularly good.
Ray Lindman certaintly looked the
part, hut his voice belied liis harsh
and strong appearance. Douglas
Gregg spoke his brief piece as the
clergyman quite well.
Perhaps it is a little hard to
blame these actors for being un
convincing in "Granite," as it was
, only by the most remarkable dis
play of talent that Miss Keho and
Cathcart made their parts real and
living. When one is called upon to
, say such lines as "You're a man of
granite, Prosper," the equivocal
meaning is much too clear to pass
unnoticed by Stanford roughs or
Little Theatre audiences in New
, York City.
1 Probably the outstanding result
of Friday night's performance was
the realization that Clemence Dane
should have revised and simplified
the play built on the old theme of
"sell yourself to the devil and you'll
pay the price"—but it remains to
the prestige of Stanford dramatic
talent that even with such an un-'
wieldy vehicle, there were two pej 1 -j
I formances which were more than
worthy of the professional stage.
