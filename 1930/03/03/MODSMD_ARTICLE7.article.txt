# CATHCART, KEHO SCORE IN GRANITE
## Helvenston Production of Tragedy by Dane Is Well Received 
### Sylva Weaver 
Rising through the mystic mists
clinging to the island of "Granite,"
and holding together an unusual
but essentially unreal play, were
the remarkable performances of
Katlierine Keho and Robert Cath
cart in the English Club presenta
tion of Clemence Dane's tragedy
last Friday night.
Miss Keho revealed unknown
depths of dramatic power in the
role of Judith, and showed a new
versatility in the wide emotional
range called for in the sudden
transformations from submissive
sweetness to stormy passion. It will
be long months before those who
witnessed the soul-struggle of a
passionate nature —repressed by
the shadows ot" stony granite and
the dominating influence of her
husband —will forget Katherine
Keho in this characterization. It is
destined to rank with her portrayal
of Maggie Wylie as one of the high
lights of the Stanford stage.
Cathcart in Uncanny Part
Robert Cathcart put conviction
and life into a difficult role, and to

ure combining both human and
superhuman elements, showed real

To Harold Helvenston's credit
was the creation of an atmosphere
in which the natural surroundings
of the granite isle mingled with

of tlie sea and the winds convinced j
the audience thoroughly that one
would have to sell one's soul to the
