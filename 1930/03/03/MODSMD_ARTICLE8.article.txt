# NUTCRACKER SUITE TO BE THEME FOR DANCE PRODUCTION
## 
### 
Interpretation of the moods ex- J
pressed in music rather than pan-i
tomime of any sort will be brought j
out in the Dance Drama to be given J
Thursday night in the Assembly j
Hall by the dance composition j
class.
The program will consist of ten I
separate or small group numbers !
and the final act which is to be J
given to the "Nutcracker Suite" by |
Tschaikowsky. The interpretation i
given the suite will be that of the j
composer, although it will be j
worked out according to individual j
ideas. The individual numbers will j
all be original compositions |
worked out by members of the j
class.
Costumes for the drama will be j
impressionistic instead of realistic, |
according to Annie Lou Carmi- j
chael. The desired effect will be J
obtained by using characteristic |
line and color instead of detail.
Those in charge of the drama I
are: dance committee, Beth Pink- i
ston; costumes, Annie Lou Carmi-;
chael; programs, Marienne Smith;
publicity, Aline Lissner; music, i
Frances Sanford; stage, Gladys
Crofoot.
