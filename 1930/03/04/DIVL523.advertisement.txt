All Talking - Singing with an All Colored Cast
Clap yo' hands! Slap yo' thigh! "Hallelujah" is here. It is amazing
beyond mere description. King Vidor brings to you in his startling
talking and singing picture the soul of the colored race. Come to
the New Orleans cabarets, the revivalist meetings, the cotton fields,
vividly pictured with thrilling dialogue and song.
