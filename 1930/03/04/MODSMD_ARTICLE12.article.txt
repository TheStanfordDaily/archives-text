### BY PHILIP HUMPHREYS 
Clinical and research work in
| the Stanford-Lane Medical School
is heing held to a, minimum hy
cramped facilities, according to Dr.
William Opliuls, dean of the school,
; who discussed the situation in an
interview for the Daily, Friday.
"For a number of years, depart
ment heads have complained of
| restricted conditions under which
i work has had lb be done," Dr.
I Opliuls said. "Mill il is impossible;
to make any extensive additions;
j without financial aid from some
outside source. The University has,
! not sufficient funds to permit a 1
! building program which would !
modernize the whole hospital
; plant."
The building which houses the ,
| medical school was built in ISS2
land ad(led to in IK!i4, was one of
the few large buildings which sin-
I vived the earthquake in I!MM>. It is
la class "C" building, with walls of
I brick and interior construction of
I wood.
Dr. Opliuls emphasized the ne- 1 '

eessity for greater capacity in the
hospitals, lie declared that many
patients who were in need of treat
ment were refused admission din
ing Hie last three or four years
due to lack of space. "The new
building which is under construc
lion at the present time will re
lieve the congestion temporarily,
but il is only a question of time
until the new annex to the hospital
is overcrowded, - lie declared.
Asked about the possibility of
taking up research work in the
eallcer euro developed by Doctors
Coffey and Dumber, Dr. Opliuls
stated that while the present facili
ties limited the amount of research
which could be done now, any ma
jor problems which presented them
selves would he given considern
t ion.
"Our principal need is space. I>ul
until some far-reaching develop
ment, now unforeseen, occurs, we
must continue under present un
satisfactory conditions," Dr. Opliuls
concluded.
