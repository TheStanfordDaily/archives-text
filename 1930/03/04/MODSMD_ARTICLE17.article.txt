# MORE RESEARCH NEEDED TO AID WAR ON DISEASE, ASSERT HUMBER, COFFEY
## Discoverers of New Cancer Cure Enthusiastic Over Opportunities Available to New Generation of Students in Western Universities 
### BY MILTON SILVERMAN 
I IT is to the group of young men and women who are now beginning
J their work in scientific investigation that the world of medicine looks
! for its future perfection. In this era of modern methods and technic, of
| overnight discoveries and astounding new theories, the present genera
tion of students holds in its power the entire future of curative and
preventative medicine.
This is the message of the two men, Dr. Walter Coffey and Dr. John
Humher, who have brought forth the most sensational discovery of

recent years—tin; proposed supra
renal injection for the cure of can
cer.
Into the very workshop of these
men wo went, among the hundreds
of patients who were crowding the
inlinitesimally small clinic at the
Southern Pacific Hospital. There
was not (lie feeling of excitement,
iini the air of intense expectation
there thai one might anticipate. In
stead, each of the waiters was
quiet, or perhaps a bit bored, but
on every face was written in 1111-
mistakabie characters — hopeless
ness.
Patients "Uninterested"
None of the patients exhibited
any of the animation that has
swept through the entire medical
profession. Hearing the indelible
signs of the ravages of the disease,
they seemed to be only slightly in
terested. To them, the new injec
tions were but one more thing to
be tried. They had used all the
other "sure cures for cancer," and
now lliis new method had appeared,
to bo just another with no greater
chance for success.
But as the morning went on, the
droning voice of an interne began
calling, in strict alphabetical order,
names of the waiters —two hundred
and fifty of them. As each was
called, from some spot in the wait
ing room arose a patient, hurrying
more to prevent any delay to the
doctors than to reach the mystify
ing hypodermic needles any sooner.
No Rest for Workers
Bach stripped off his coat, rolled
up liis sleeves, and moved into the
operating room. There was no well
ordered idleness here. The patient
held forth his arm to the first nurse,
who waited with the ever-present
cotton and bottle of alcohol. Then
another, working as surely and rap
idly as a machine, took his arm
and injected into it a few cubic
centimeters of a transparent brown
liquid—suprarenal extract.
And that was all —for the pa
tient. He was through until next
week. But Hie doctors and the
nurses and lli" internes seemed to
be working day and night without
a single pause for food or sleep.
Hour after hour they stood there,
bathing arms, sterilizing instru
ments, filling them with the pre
cious fluid, and injecting each pa
tient an unbelievable series of
automatic gestures.
In the midst of the packed room
stood a stocky man, arrayed in the
stained, rumpled gown that repre
sented long hours of work. Dasli
ing back and forth, questioning
one, directing another, aiding in
;ui injection, sweeping into pages
of clinical records, dashing to a
U lephone, ordering more supplies
that was Dr. llumber.
Then there was a heavy, gray
haired man who went back and
forth between the clinic and his
office in the main hospital. Just
"lit of a conference of railroad
directors, he could have appeared
no differently. Immaculate suit,
while vest, perfectly adjusted tie,
he seemed to have no place in the
clinic that, protected by half a
dozen body guards, was Dr. Coffey.
Future in Research
ISul Dr. Coffey worked, and Dr.
Unniber worked, and the nurses
and then the internes worked, and
between them all, they produced an
atmosphere that is comparable to
but one thing that of a news
paper office twenty minutes before
press time.
Between dashes and injections,
they found time to answer our
questions, mincing them between
five or six other conversations.
"Research holds the greatest fu
ture for medicine. Every doctor
should develop it. The future of
our war against disease depends
<m the work that research scien
tists can accomplish.
Hospitals Co-operate
'"I his work, here, is only an ex-,
periinent. We have strong hopes
for its success, but we can promise
nothing. In a month or so, we
should know more."
"The staffs at the California and
Stanford hospitals could do this
work equally well. Each has al
ready offered us its complete co- i
operation. We could drop out now,
and they could go on*without us.
"Stanford, you know, has re- j
nmrkuhie facilities at hand —some
of the biggest men in the world
are on its staff today. We don't 1
ha ve to go East for co-operation—
and I don't see why Westerners
should ,uo East to study.
"What we want is time to gather j
and analyze our results. Then, if
we have anything, we can look for
ward to the development of our 1
methods."
