# MORE RESEARCH NEEDED TO AID WAR ON DISEASE, ASSERT HUMBER, COFFEY
## Discoverers of New Cancer Cure Enthusiastic Over Opportunities Available to New Generation of Students in Western Universities 
### BY MILTON SILVERMAN 
I IT is to the group of young men and women who are now beginning
J their work in scientific investigation that the world of medicine looks
! for its future perfection. In this era of modern methods and technic, of
| overnight discoveries and astounding new theories, the present genera
tion of students holds in its power the entire future of curative and
preventative medicine.
This is the message of the two men, Dr. Walter Coffey and Dr. John
Humher, who have brought forth the most sensational discovery of

recent years—tin; proposed supra
renal injection for the cure of can
cer.
Into the very workshop of these
men wo went, among the hundreds
of patients who were crowding the
inlinitesimally small clinic at the
Southern Pacific Hospital. There
was not (lie feeling of excitement,
iini the air of intense expectation
there thai one might anticipate. In
stead, each of the waiters was
quiet, or perhaps a bit bored, but
on every face was written in 1111-
mistakabie characters — hopeless
ness.
Patients "Uninterested"
None of the patients exhibited
any of the animation that has
swept through the entire medical
profession. Hearing the indelible
signs of the ravages of the disease,
they seemed to be only slightly in
terested. To them, the new injec
tions were but one more thing to
be tried. They had used all the
other "sure cures for cancer," and
now lliis new method had appeared,
to bo just another with no greater
chance for success.
But as the morning went on, the
droning voice of an interne began
calling, in strict alphabetical order,
names of the waiters —two hundred
and fifty of them. As each was
called, from some spot in the wait
ing room arose a patient, hurrying
more to prevent any delay to the
doctors than to reach the mystify
ing hypodermic needles any sooner.
No Rest for Workers
Bach stripped off his coat, rolled
up liis sleeves, and moved into the
operating room. There was no well
ordered idleness here. The patient
held forth his arm to the first nurse,
who waited with the ever-present
cotton and bottle of alcohol. Then
another, working as surely and rap
idly as a machine, took his arm
and injected into it a few cubic
centimeters of a transparent brown
liquid—suprarenal extract.
And that was all —for the pa
tient. He was through until next
week. But Hie doctors and the
nurses and lli" internes seemed to
be working day and night without
a single pause for food or sleep.
Hour after hour they stood there,
bathing arms, sterilizing instru
ments, filling them with the pre
cious fluid, and injecting each pa
tient an unbelievable series of
automatic gestures.
In the midst of the packed room
stood a stocky man, arrayed in the
stained, rumpled gown that repre
sented long hours of work. Dasli
