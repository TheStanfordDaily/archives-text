Independents a 2(>-1 r> victory over
Breakers in a semi-final intramural
basketball game played last night
in the Pavilion. The. Cardinals will
meet Sigma Chi tonight at seven
in the Pavilion to determine the
University championship.'
The Cardinals started slowly,
trailing 7-.'! at the end of the first
quarter; but. their greater steadi
ness soon enabled them to take a
lead which was never seriously
disputed. Ward Smith, sinking four
field goals and three free throws,
took high-scoring honors with 11
points, besides putting up a strong
game at guard.
Urea Iters' greater speed proved
more of a handicap than a help to
them, as they often lost passes by
traveling too fast to handle! them.
Joe Cook led i lie Breakers scorers
with five points, but failed to loop
his usual quota of shots.
Defensive work of Harrison,
Ward Smith, and Celts, Cardinal
guards and center, frequently ap
proached the sensational. On sev
eral occasions one of these, three
alone broke up the two- and three
man offensive swept down the
court by the I beakers' speedy for
ward line of Joe Cook, Stan Conk,
and Carlsmith.
Both quintets missed many shots
and the game was unusually rough.
The Cardinals should meet
stronger competition tonight when
they go up against Sigma Chi. The
winner of this contest will gain pos
session for one year of the l>. (J.
Balfour basketball trophy.
