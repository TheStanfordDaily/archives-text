EVANSTON, 111., March
(/P) â€”The firemen rushed to
Mrs. John W. Dahlstrom's
apartment, for she had called
them.
They had their funny hats
on, and they carried axes and
extinguishers. They stomped
into the presence of Mr. and
Mrs. Dahlstrom, ready to do
or die, if need be, for dear old
E.K.I).
"Do you," in quired Mrs.
Dahlstrom, "put out things?"
"We put out fires," said the
firemen.
"Put him out," she said,
pointing to Mr. Dahlstrom,
who sat quietly in the corner.
A corncob pipe hung desultor
ily from his mouth. From time
to time lie inhaled deeply, and
then permitted the smoke to
siip in lazy spirals from a cor
ner of his lips.
"He's no fire," said the fire
men.
"Maybe not," said the lady,
"but I'm firing him now. He
sits around all day Sunday
jufrt smoking. If you've a
spark of energy you will ex
tinguish him from my pres
ence."
Dahlstrom in bis chair in
haled deeply. He seemed in
deep thought.
The firemen gave Mrs. Dahl
strom a hurt look and stomped
away.
"We do not put out hus
bands," said the firemen.
