## 
### 
"The government of the United
Stales should not recognize Russia J
because of the utter intolerance
displayed by the Soviet govern- .
ment," stated Charles I). Hurrey, j
national secretary of the Commit
tee on Friendly Relations, who ar
rived on the campus from New '
York yesterday, to a Daily reporter.
"Recognition of the Soviets would (
mean the recognition of a govern
ment, far more tyrannical than that
of the czarist regime. England re
grets that she ever made negotia- !
t ions wit h I he country."
Hurrey is secretary of a society I
which aids in the placing and ad
vising of foreign students in t hi:,
country. Due to the nature ol his
work, lie has spent much time in
making observat ions.
"Frankly, I believe that today
students will find more basis for
inspiration in studying in this conn
try," Hurrey remarked when asked
concerning the feasibility of Ameri
cans finishing their education in I
Europe. "Whereas Germany used ,
to attract many, we find that now
many students are coming here ;
from Germany, however, Prance
continues to draw.
"Tim trouble, is, we have been!
out for dollars instead of cultural
relations in this country," the secre- 1
tary remarked. "However, in the'
near future, I hope to see a real '
exchange of students between na
tions. A tremendous increase has!
been made recently in the ex
change of professors between Eng
land and this country. Due to the j
Commonwealth Fund and others,
numerous British students havo en
tered our universities. There is an
influx of Latin Americans. Soviet I
Russia has sent live men to study
here. If I were going into a foreign
country, I should certainly spend a
year in one of its universities. Ihe j
trouble with the United States is i
that she is too high hat in her edit
cat ion."
