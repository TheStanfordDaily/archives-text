# HAS STANFORD COLLEGIATE FOOLS?

That locally famed publication of William l\. Hearst, the San
Francisco Call-Bulletin, discusses editorially "The College Fool"
through selected quotations of Brother Leo of St. Mary's College.
It seems that college "lads" go to the movies and are very much
annoyed by what they call the misrepresentation of the screen. "Yet
when it comes to misrepresenting true college life," says Brother
Leo. "the movies are not the only offenders. Every college suffers
somewhat from the misguided enthusiasm of the family fool. Ile it
is who manifests bis loyaltv bv being loud-mouthed, who advertises
bis academic status bv extremely dirty trousers, who professes his
faith in higher education by using the language and the intonations
of a tenderloin t<»nt.
"Amateur philosophers have sometimes wondered wny there is
such a demand for college 'stickers,' why gummy pennants are dis
played on windshields and suitcases. It may not be entirely exact
to sav that such informational devices are unnecessary. The college
family fool needs a sticker to prove that he attends an institution of
higher learning. Mis manners don't show it, bis language doesn't
show it; bis range of interests doesn't show it; so he flaunts a label
in sheer self defense."
Says the llearst journal. "In other words, the college fool, like
most others, is self-made." To which may be added a statement that
public organs are apparently more interested in exploiting the un
usual and bizarre aspects of college than they are in giving the public
at least a little information based on fact.
Coupled with the statements of Brother Leo, a quotation attrib
uted to William Berryman Scott, professor of geology at Princeton
and for forty-seven years a member of the faculty, makes the mod
ern collegian also a modern paradox. Says Professor Scott, "It
would have been unthinkable to have demanded so much work from
the undergraduate of twenty-five years ago as is required of him
today."
And so the controversy rages on! College is both a good and a
bad place. Let each choose according to his taste. But then, as that
quaint old saving goes, some people's taste is all in their mouths.
