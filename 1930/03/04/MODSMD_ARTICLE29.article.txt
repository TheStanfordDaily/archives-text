# AGAIN, IN ALL THINGS PROPORTION

### 
Two hundred and fifteen dollars' worth of groceries have been
made possible for the starving Bulgarians by the recent drive for
funds conducted on this campus. The Daily congratulates the
A.S.S.I', committee for successfully accumulating $215 of the $500
quota set by optimistic souls.
In spite of such a congratulatory sentiment, however, the Daily
again urges. "In all things proportion." The Bulgarian drive un
doubtedly served a worthy purpose, but, as is often the case, enthu
siasm proved to be bigger than common sense—half a thousand
dollars was entirely too much to expect.
There have been many other unreasonable "Bulgarian" drives in
the past and there will be many in the future, until Stanford has a
< ommunity Chest.
The matter of worthiness goes unquestioned. It is the matter of
system, good judgment, and appropriateness that is challenged.
