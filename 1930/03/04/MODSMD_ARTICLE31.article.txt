MOUNTAIN CITY. By Uptorl Sin
clair. New York: Albert and
Charles Boni. 1930.
Mountain City is a story of (lie
rise of Jed Rusher, child of ;i poor
family of farmers, to (lie position
of rich capitalist. As one would ex
pect, Sinclair lets slip few oppor
tunities for arraignment of the eco
nomic system of the world.
Rusher's one purpose in life is
the acquisition of money, lie at
tracts the attention of a wealthy
advocate of the single tax, and in
this manner gains entrance to the
home of a wealthy family. Having
overheard <i conversation concern
ing the smuggling of precious gems
from Europe, lie secretly informs
the government and is paid the in
former's share of the line —$20,(100,
which makes it possible for him
to secure options on oil land.
When Rusher discovers that the
very naive and childish grand
daughter of his employer is expect
ing an illegitimate child, he pre
tends to ihe family that he is its
father, and marries the frightened
girl. The family assists him in the
securing of the oil field, and his
unscrupulous methods finally make
him one of the masters of the oil
industry.
All this provides opportunity for
rather interesting expositions of
the evils of financial operatives,
with occasional information con
cerning the methods of newspaper
editors %vho live upon the proceeds
of blackmailing.
The socialistic propaganda which
Sinclair always makes a vital part
of his novels is rather tiresome,
and, of course, weakens any artis
tic value which they might have.
Moreover, Mountain City fails,
in so far as 1 am concerned, to
inspire any great fear or detesta
tion of those things which it at
tempts to attack.
Sinclair obviously wishes to show
the horrors of exploitation of men

i and resources by the few who are j
in control. But, though Rusher's
; victories come a hit too easily, J (
can only admire his devotion to liis
ideal. While l do not. sympathize
with this ideal of becoming im- '
mensely wealthy, it obviously j
I makes Rusher happy to accumu
late his many millions. His under
lings are not completely unhappy,
tliny lack his high position because
tliey have not his determination.
Sinclair has not written a good
novel, though Mountain City is en
tertaining and interesting; and he
has caused the system which he i
attacks to appear, not a loathe- \
; some crime' against civilization, «
but n playground tor characters
who are better qualified for suc
■ cess in their chosen field than are j
their fellows. —E, E. W.
HALLELUJAH —At the Varsity. ,
I Splendid as Hallelujah is,- it falls
j short of the epic nature of its con
ception.
j The malady is not a specific i 1
I thing hut a general weakness. Even |
I now it is strong, but it, is not as j
great as the heroic dream of what
it might have been.
The play is not bungled by poor
i acting. Nina Mae McKinney, an!
emotional actress of great beauty j
and ability, plays an exceptional !
I role well. Daniel H. Haynes, in the I
leading role, does magnificently.
I The story is a passionate, al
most, terrible thing. But it is not
overdone, and is not marred by
sentimentality until the picture is i
| almost over. We can not be con
; vinced of such lenient justice in
:the South.
One need not seek further for
i the origin of jazz. The picture is a
j continuous surge of rhythm, well
| sung by trained negro voices. Irv
-1 ing Berlin has faithfully repro
! duced the native negro melodies
in his adaptations for Hallelujah.
