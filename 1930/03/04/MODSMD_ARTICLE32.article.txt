The Editor, Sir:
Women's debating at. Stanford is
on t ho uphill grade. More women
are trying out now than have
hitherto. This quarter a regular
varsity debate squad has been se
lected which is working and ob
taining credit just as do the men.
Those women who are in debating
find it a mental stimulation as
well as a means of public speak
ing training and all-around good
fun. There are plenty of other
women on the campus who would
enter debating if the general in
terest on 1 he part of the; other
students would be increased. It is
a big thrill to battle with wits pro
viding there is an audience .of
something other than empty chairs.
Stanford women in debating are
"getting on Hie boat"! With the
co-operation of the campus, some
thing can certainly come of it. At;
the University of California, wo
men are allotted equal funds with
the men by the action of the Asso
ciated Students. A California wo
man's team is planning to go to

New York next year to debate with
Columbia and Radcliff and other
women's universities.
Here at Stanford, the women are
granted an absurdly small appor
tionment which limits them to
nearby intercollegiate debating
only. The U.S.C. debate is the
farthest from home they can get
upon the available funds. What is
more, Stanford women are develop
ing an easy, amusing style of de
bate that not only can give an
intelligent argument upon the sub
ject at hand, but can afford "what
listeners there be" an enjoyable
evening. California, on the other
hand, is still in the stage of formal,
pedagogical, statistical argumenta
tion. Yet they get cash, and Stan
ford does not. What's wrong with
this picture?
What's to be done about it? First
give the present debaters some
high-powered support. Second,
make it worth the while of more
women to enter debate by showing
interest. Third, get some action
| from the A.S.S.U.
