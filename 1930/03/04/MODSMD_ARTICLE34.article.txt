# TRADITIONS BEGIN TO FALL AT CORNELL

In years gone by, Cornellians
were noted for their respect of
tradition. All rules and regulations
pertaining to undergraduate beha

il be hoped that the student body
will perceive its thoughtless disre

ing tradition, ?ind in the future ob
serve the demands of this custom.
