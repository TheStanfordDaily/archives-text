thirteen unlucky points j
Last week a .sports writer on ih" |
Dally California n, one Wully |
Schmidt, '31, stormed over a story j
in the Stanford Daily about the |
Card swimming team. The I.e. en- j
itiusiasl wfiil so far as to quote I
1 lie first paragraph of the Daily i
story:
"'Thirteen unlucky points!
That's just what Stanford ex
pects to leave for California in
the annual swimming meet
March 1. The Cardinals plan
to give the severest drubbing
the U.C. mermen have had for
a long time. The Stanford var
sity should take first and sec
ond place in every event. And
the Redshirt yearling squad
will try to emulate their big
brothers.' "
Said Mr. Schmidt, '31: "The
writer of that story, Reid It. Briggs,
seems to think rather highly of
the Stanford swimming team."
In Encina pool Saturday the
Stanford swimming team tub
bed the Golden Bear very thor
oughly.
Continued Wully, 'HI: "The meet
will be the closest between the two
schools in a long time."
The score was 62 to 13: un
lucky points!
Again Mr. Schmidt., '31.: "Ii ap
pears that Mr. Briggs has not even
east an eye on the California team
this year."
Stanford took every first and
second place, won both free
style and medley relays.
The Bear yearlings had the fight
of their lives in the freshman
meet, and barely escaped with the
victory. 38 to 37.
Winds up the Berkeley oracle:
"California also lias a water polo
team thai understands the object
of the game. ,Jt would indeed be
odd if the Bears should hand their
Redshirt rivals a beating."
Yes, odd indeed. The Bears'
best come down to the Farm
for their second immersion
next Saturday, when varsity
and freshman water polo
games are scheduled. Life pre
servers will be on hand, Mr.
Schmidt! —Reid Briggs.
