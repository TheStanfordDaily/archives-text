### 
i
Complete revision of fees and |
playing privileges on the new Stan- i
ford golf course including the abo- j
lit ion of monthly and quarterly j
memberships to take effect next ;
quarter will be made at the meeting j
of the Board of Athletic Control j
Thursday night.
The edict was handed out yes- J
terday by Graduate Manager Al !
Masters who presented the free
transferring of membership cards j
between the students, complaints |
from outside members, and a j
steady deficit as the chief factors j
that caused the necessity for a new
system of fees and privileges.
The revision was thoroughly dis
cussed at 1 lie last meeting of the
hoard and Thursday night's meet
ing will merely go through the for
mality of voting, and of straighten
ing up a few minor points.
Privileges for Outsiders
"Stanford students rightly be
lieve that the course is for them
selves and tli" faculty," said Mas- |
ters, "but they must remember that j
without subscriptions from outside j
members, there would have been I
no course. Consequently a few !
privileges must be granted to these !
members just as holders of stadium !
scrip have privileges on football
games."
Masters pointed out that the out
side members had complained that
students crowded ihe links and
forced the outsiders to sandwich
in their play at odd times. This
will be done away with by a new
system entitling the outside mem
bers first privilege to sign up on a
time chart between Monday and
Friday of each week l heir preferred
hours of play on Saturdays and
Sundays. The students will fill in 1
at all other times during those ,
days.
To raise added revenue, the stu-;
dent monthly and quarterly mem-j
berships will be discontinued and
students will he required to pay j
Ihe $1.00 green fees on week days j
and $2.00 fees on Saturdays, Sun- I
days, and holidays. Masters intends j
to propose a coupon book also, al- I
lowing students twenty-five rounds i
of golf, no matter what day of the
week, for $20.00. ll is believed that
the increase of fees will cut down
on the number of student golfers'
on the links each day, as well as
provide more funds.
Deficit of $650
"The course represented an out
lay of $155,000," Masters stated,
" and this must be paid back in
ten years. At present, with only j
fifty operating days, there is a
deficit of $650. Since there is an
annual upkeep costing $50,000,
gross receipts must necessarily to
i ta I $65,000; and this is not possible
under the present system of fees."
In addition. Masters said there
was to be an increase in green fees
for outside players unaccompanied
by members, students, or faculty,
of $2.n0 on week-days and $4.00 on
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
The new system will only be on
trial during the spring quarter, ac
cording to Masters, and further de-
I velopments with the wearing off of
i the novelty of the new course may
[ necessitate another revision nexl

under the present system of fees."
In addition. Masters said there
was to be an increase in green fees
for outside players unaccompanied
by members, students, or faculty,
of $2.n0 on week-days and $4.00 on
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.

Complete revision of fees and |
playing privileges on the new Stan- i
ford golf course including the abo- j
lit ion of monthly and quarterly j
memberships to take effect next ;
quarter will be made at the meeting j
of the Board of Athletic Control j
Thursday night.
The edict was handed out yes- J
terday by Graduate Manager Al !
Masters who presented the free
transferring of membership cards j
between the students, complaints |
from outside members, and a j
steady deficit as the chief factors j
that caused the necessity for a new
system of fees and privileges.
The revision was thoroughly dis
cussed at 1 lie last meeting of the
hoard and Thursday night's meet
ing will merely go through the for
mality of voting, and of straighten
ing up a few minor points.
Privileges for Outsiders
"Stanford students rightly be
lieve that the course is for them
selves and tli" faculty," said Mas- |
ters, "but they must remember that j
without subscriptions from outside j
members, there would have been I
no course. Consequently a few !
privileges must be granted to these !
members just as holders of stadium !
scrip have privileges on football
games."
Masters pointed out that the out
side members had complained that
students crowded ihe links and
forced the outsiders to sandwich
in their play at odd times. This
will be done away with by a new
system entitling the outside mem
bers first privilege to sign up on a
time chart between Monday and
Friday of each week l heir preferred
hours of play on Saturdays and
Sundays. The students will fill in 1
at all other times during those ,
days.
To raise added revenue, the stu-;
dent monthly and quarterly mem-j
berships will be discontinued and
students will he required to pay j
Ihe $1.00 green fees on week days j
and $2.00 fees on Saturdays, Sun- I
days, and holidays. Masters intends j
to propose a coupon book also, al- I
lowing students twenty-five rounds i
of golf, no matter what day of the
week, for $20.00. ll is believed that
the increase of fees will cut down
on the number of student golfers'
on the links each day, as well as
provide more funds.
Deficit of $650
"The course represented an out
lay of $155,000," Masters stated,
" and this must be paid back in
ten years. At present, with only j
fifty operating days, there is a
deficit of $650. Since there is an
annual upkeep costing $50,000,
gross receipts must necessarily to
i ta I $65,000; and this is not possible
under the present system of fees."
