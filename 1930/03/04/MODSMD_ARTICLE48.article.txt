Meet. Mr. Sol "Happy" Furth,
| track captain of New York Vniver
| sity and high-scorer for his college
j in the Indoor 1.C.4-A. meet in 192S
! and 1929. As this is written before
Ihe 1930 Intercollegiates, it is too
early to state whether or not Hap
py Furth has exceeded Ihe scoring
record of eighteen points set by
Bruno Mills of Princeton in his
three years of competition (1923-
25), but as Furth scored eight
points in the 192N indoor meet and
nine last year, his chances are cer
tainly more than good.
On "Washington's Birthday, the
chunky N.Y.I', captain journeyed
to Schenectady to compete in the
Union College indoor meet. There
i he set a new world's record for the
j 70-yard low hurdles, and made a
j new track record for the 70-higli
j hurdles. The remarkable part
| about this performance is that
; Sol's legs are just about two-thirds
i as long as Thompson's, for the Yio

i short as his name. But he is mus
cular, quick as a cat, and has a
wonderful competitive spirit. Any
coach will tell you that these quali
ties go a long ways to make up for
a lack of height or reach in track
