# GREAT MORAL COURAGE ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS OF HONOR SYSTEM-R.L. GREEN

### BY RAWSON HOLMES

I his is the sixth of ii series of opinions on the' proposed amendment to Ihe
| llonor Code which will establish a system of optional proctors, by those men i
j who are best abb* to comprehend the situation, namely professors who liare I
I lanje classes.

"In order to make the Honor
Code a successful instrument in
frustrating dishonestly written ex
amination papers, it must be treat
ed as a militantly lived-up-to tra
dition," Professor Emeritus llufus
L. Green, who was one of the moti
vating powers in the original adop
tion of the Code, stated in an in
terview with die Daily yesterday.
"Until you have a majority of
the students supporting the report
ing of violations, there will be no
reporting; and until you have in
fringements of the honor system
reported, cheaters will be unre
strained in their activities," Pro
fessor Green declared.
"There are very few places in
the country where the system has
functioned successfully," he com-

I mented. "Physical courage is a]
very common characteristic among !
us. Because of il our race has ex- '
isted and overcome the hardships
of pioneer life in the early days of ;
| this country's making. But, as j
civilization develops there becomes ■
less need for physical courage and j
more and more need for moral J
bravery. Moral courage is, how
| ever, a scarce commodity in the
| world, because of the strong ten- I
j dcncy to uniformity; in dress,
I thought, and actions, especially
'among the young people of the
day.
"It is a difficult feat to stand up
against one's associates," the pro
fessor emeritus continued, "espe
, dally when the action carries an
emotional resistance. Hence it will

always lie hard to gel students to
report cheaters —and thereby re
si rain dishonesty through the
honor system. And, since our hon
ors and scholarships are awarded
according to scholastic records, the
honest students suffer.
"I believe the proposed amend
ment establishing an optional proc
tor system might be worth trying
as a modification of the present
system," lie concluded. "It will de
pend of course on the support it
obtains from the student body. If
the students have enough moral
courage to put. it over, it will be
successful. If not, it will fail in the
same manner that the present sys
tem has. As to the various objec
tions that have been raised in re
gard to it; no principle of action
that attempts to guide human af
fairs is perfect. All we can do is
to find the solution to our prob
lems that best adapts itself to the
particular conditions and functions
most successfully at I lie time."
