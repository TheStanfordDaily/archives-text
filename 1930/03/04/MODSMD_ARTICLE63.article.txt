# MANY PECULIARITIES OF FISH DESCRIBED BY ALBERT HERRE
## 
### 
"No human being, even it' gifted
with an insane imagination, could
conceive of the vast numbers of
weird, grotesque, or 'impossible'
shapes which are actually found
among living fishes," said Dr. Al
bert W. Herre, curator of natural
history in the Stanford Museum.
A typical fisli is cold-blooded,
breathes by means of gills, lays
eggs for production of its young,
and lives entirely in the water. It
has a bony skeleton, supporting an
elongated body covered with scales,
and fins for steering, balancing, and
propulsion but uses its tail mostly
for die latter.
There are, however, many varia
tions. For instance, tlie lungfish
has limblike fins and practical air
breathing lungs; certain sharks
bring forth their young alive; the '
sturgeon has cartilage for frame-|
work; the catfish has no scales; j
the climbing perch can climb trees, !
and the flying fish can rise out of!
the water for gliding flight. In fact, i
it has been estimated that there j
are about 13,000 different existing |
species.
The Department of Ichthyology !
at Stanford is particularly rich in j
fishes of North America and tliej
Pacific Ocean," said Dr. Herre. |
"Lately we have been adding from |
tile South Seas and Tropical Isl- j
amis and are .it present busy tabu- j
lating and studying a collection i
made during a cruise there last ,
year."
