I
| The proverbial gossip who hissed
j "Mood will tell; just look at his
father!" was scientifically correct.
Such was proved by Dr. Jon Alfred
Mjoen, Norwegian biologist, in his
j lectures here yesterday.
I Speaking on "Criminal and Gen
| ins as a Biological' Problem," Mjoen
'said: "One can't expect a second
! generation of Napoleons or Goethes,
i unless genius marries into a family
! of good stock. Every child has two
j parents; lie inherits neither the
I characteristics of the father nor of
j the mother," he continued, "but of
J the general stock of the family."
The old adage, "Don't marry a
I maid, if she's the only good maid
| of the breed," was strongly upheld
I by Mjoen. His charts and statistics
j and slides all went, to show that
' great ability does not disappear
j with the correct biological circum
! stances.
"Marry so that your children
j may inherit character and strong
j will, not intelligence alone," he ad
j monished. "Keep up the good stock
; in your own family. Although this
I old idea lias been lost in our mod
j ern universities and schools and
' libraries, the basic fact back of it
i is sound and should be followed,
j "No inherited quality can be lost,
i It ahyavs comes out again when
| least expected. Environment," he
j explained, "may have a great deal
! to do with the development of men-
I tal traits, but inherited character
■ istics cannot disappear; they must
return, and do."
