# EVIDENCE LOST IN LIQUOR TRIAL AS GALLON BLOWS UP
## 
### 
OAKLAND, March 4. (A 3 )â€”
The breaks came the way of
John Kruzevich, on trial today
in Police Judge Howard L.
Bacon's court for illegal pos
session of liquor.
The evidence, a gallon jug
of wine seized in his home last
February, reposed on the
clerk's desk and was about to
be identified and classified by
the prosecution.
A terrific bang that could be
heard throughout the building
startled the courtroom and a
gleam of hope appeared in
Kruzevich's eyes as the wine
quickly disappeared into the
carpet.
"Charge dismissed for lack
of evidence," said the judge
as he wiped traces of the
claret from his vest.
