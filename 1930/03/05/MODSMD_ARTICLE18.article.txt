# EVERY STANFORD WOMAN SHOULD FEEL RESPONSIBILITY, SAYS DYMENT
## 
### BY ANN ADAMS 
"Stanford is limited to 500 wo
men! There tire perhaps 500 more
who would like to be Stanford stu
dents. When one stops to think
about it, what a sense of responsi
bility it should give each Stanford
girl," stated I)r. Bertha Stuart Dy
ment, Medical Adviser and Director
of Physical Education for Women,
in an interview for the Daily yes
terday.
Sleep Needed
"If she fails to make good, she
lias taken the place of someone
who might. Probably each girl en
ters with a serious purpose back
of her desire for a college educa
tion. Does she keep that purpose?
Or does her ambition wane under
the strain of living up to the social
demands?
"Is rating socially more import
ant than rating scholast icallv ?
With continual demands made
upon her by sorority sisters to rate
high in campus activities," she con
tinued, "can she keep her first,
high ambition?
"Women students are quite as
capable of carrying a heavy col
lege schedule as the men," she
said. "Yet if the social pressure is
extreme, the temptation is great to
get through with a minimum of
work. Every girl who does this is

! not making good from the stand- j
point of the University, and she is
I keeping someone out who might |
I make good. To do hard work and
| to keep tit one needs sleep.
' "One of the chief faults of the
i woman's life on the campus," Dr.
I Dyment went on, "is that each one
1 tries to get along on far too little j
j sleep. This is especially true in j
' the dormitories which are the j
J noisiest places on t lie campus, j
Many girls have no respect for j
each other's study hours but waste 1
j time talking and chatting.
Oregon Compared
"In the dormitories at the Uni- j
I versity of Oregon," she continued, j
i "there is much stricter regulation |
of the corridors than in the proctor |
system used here. Lights are put j
out at midnight and contrary to
the custom here it is a rare occur
rence for tlie girls to stay up until
one or two in the morning. During |
the growing period girls should
have nine hours' sleep. »
i "If social activities keep a girl !
up until :» a.m. on Friday and Sat- !
unlay nights and occupy her on |
i Sundays, she is going to take the j
first three or four days of the week
to recuperate, to be ready for the
next week-end," she concluded,
j "What about studies then?"
