## 
### 
"Neither people nor kings are
rich enough to reward all the devo
tions which are given rise to by
the supreme struggle," said Marcel
Bouteron, in praise of Balzac, in
bis lecture last night in the As
sembly Hall. Bouteron took, as the
highlight of his talk, Balzac's strug
gle to write a novel worthy of his
hero, Napoleon.
The lecturer, speaking entirely
in French, dealt with the Battle
of Wagram and reviewed the vari
ous chapters of Balzac's works in
which are found the bits that make
up the epic of Napoleon's life. ,
Being librarian in the institute
of France, and custodian of the
Spoelbercli de Loverjoul collection
at C'hatitilly, Bouteron visited the
Hoover War library and other col
lections there.
"The general atmosphere of Stan
ford, witli its peaceful, academic
cloisters, reminds me of All Souls
College, Oxford. I greatly admire
it. Stanford gives an impression
almost fairy-like," lie said.
