Walsh Opposes Increase
Senator Walsh of Montana, act
I ing Democratic leader, had taken
j up the opposition to a proposal of
Senator Smoot, Republican, Utah,
to increase the existing levy on
Cuban Raws from 1.76 to 2 cents a
pound and had concluded his pre
sentation when the recess motion
was put.
Senator Harrison, Democrat, Mis
sissippi, whose proposal to retain
the existing sugar duties was ap
proved, 48 to 38 several weeks ago,
originally proposed postponement
of the sugar contest. He said there
apparently had been "some dicker
ing around" on the duty and be
did not propose to let such an im
portant amendment go through
without adequate debate.
