\nd the I ).\i i.y has been exceptionallv stupid in thinking that the
1 :.!() lockout rule for women is a relic of the days when the problem
of a durable corset stay was really a pressing one.
Such, at least, are the inferences which one may draw from the
fatements made bv Dr. I'ertha Stuart Dvment, medical advisor and
director of physical education for women, in an inspiring interview
granted the Daily. Dr. Dyment's views may be read in their en
tirety in other columns of this morning's paper.
Certain portions of her comment, however, deserve being twice
in print : "lu the dormitories at the I'niversitv of ( )regon there is
much stricter regulation of the corridors than in the proctor system
used here. I .ights are put out at midnight and contrary to the custom
here it is a rare occurrence for the girls to stay up until one or two
in the morning. During the growing period girls should have nine
hours sleep."
< )regon must he a perfectly lovely place. The co-eds there can
just grow and grow. Come to think of it, that's what Stanford
needs—more girls who really grow. It's so stimulating to see girls
grow.
Dr. Dvment continues: "If the social activities keep a girl up
iiniil 3 a.m. on Friday and Saturday nights, and occupy her Sundays,
she is going to take the first three or four days of the week to
recuperate, to be ready for the next week end, what about the studies
then ?"
Yes, ves, what about the studies then? There ought to be an
editorial in that idea for someone.
