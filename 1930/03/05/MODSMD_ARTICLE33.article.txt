# FAIR PLAY IN EXAMINATIONS
## 
### 
Xow that Stanford's winter quarter is wearing to a damp and
unpretentious close, the Daily wonders if certain members of the
faculty will maintain their traditional policy in giving final examina-
Thc lUn.v does not set itself up as qualified to judge those of
the academic sphere, but it feels called upon again to risk that odious
epithet, "sophomoric," bv suggesting at least one change in the pro
cedure in administering the questions which the optimistic believe
:ire a test of knowledge.
I or instance, there are the big hearted faculty members who
idvr courses that require one and two hour finals. These gentlemen
are accustomed to mount the platform, where they assume a bene
ficent smile and announce that the questions are quite extensive and
instead of two hours, the class can have nil morning to answer them.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is a favor, just think, a whole morning
hi which to answer a two hour final!
It is all very fine, but what about those unfortunates who have
tniol/irr two hour final, scheduled to begin immediately after the
first two hour period is over?
That insignificant fact apparently does not enter the calculations
of those big hearted gentlemen of the faculty. If you were unwise
enough to take a course that meant another final that morning, it is
just unfortunate.
'flu's charge is not aimed at the whole faculty—just at a small
group, who are imbued with the idea that their courses are the only
ones being given in the I 'niversity.
It is a small matter, perhaps, from a faculty point of view, but to
the student it assumes real importance, because such unfairness may
easily spell nothing less than a flunk out. And after all, this business
of staving in school is taken seriously bv some.
