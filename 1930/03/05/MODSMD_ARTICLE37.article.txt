LADIES OF THE JURY—At the
Alcazar Theatre. San Francisco
From the moment that Mary Bo
! Lund sweeps into the courtroom
with the magnificent poise and as
surance belonging to the American
woman of w-ealth, charm, and an
unquestioned social position the
j audience starts to laugh, and
throughout tlie entire performance
, of tiiis exuberant and refreshing
j play the end of one laugh is only
1 the beginning of another.
Mrs. Livingston Baldwin Crane
| (Mary Boland) is one of those de
lightful women who are their most
} dazzling and charming selves in a
: situation which they absolutely
know nothing whatever about. Mrs.
! Crane lias never served, on a jury
before, and consequently throws
the trial into a succession of up
heavals that are outrageously di
verting. The acme of sophistica
tion personally, she combines all
• the glittering unconcern, the
suave, airy carelessness that is the
j prerogative of a woman on the very
top rung of the social ladder, with
an infections naivete which simply
! plays havoc even with the most
•j drab juries and most staid of
judges.
The acting and personality of
Mary Boland in the role of Mrs.
Livingston Baldwin Crane can be
scarcely too highly praised. Her
vitality, her graciousuess, her
genius for comedy make the play
it could stand on her perform-
I anco alone. She has a. quality of
| stimulating and breezy charm and
I a sympathetic good hutnor that has
J the audience ai her feet, and keeps
it there before she has been two
minutes on I he stage.
"Ladies of the Jury" is frankly
a farce. It reaches no height, but
what il intends to do, it does very
thoroughly: namely, to poke de
served fun at the fallacies of that
| great. American institution — the
i jury. Slapstick, uneven, and a lit-
I tie vulgar in parts, il nevertheless
! contains more than one shrewd and
j telling hit at the procoedure of the
courtroom, and the state of en
lightenment of the average citizen.
As a revelation of human nature,
the play is really priceless. Through
the machination of an incredibly
ingenious, if exaggerated plot,
every member of the jury in this
extraordinary murder case is made

I to portray a different level of social j
j life. The pretty, hard-boiled chorus
girl, the dreaming poet, the bel
ligerent female moral-uplifter, the
inevitable Babbitt of real estate,
patriotism, and flowery words, the
flaming-haired and hot-headed Irish
i woman, are all acted with such in- I
: tedious naturalness that they seem I
to be people that you rub up !
against in everyday life.
Mary Uoland, an excellent sup
porting cast, and a clever plot are
three very good reasons why "La
dies 1 of the Jury" is a play that won't
disappoint you if you want to be
j amused. And of these three rea-
I sons, Mary iioland is the most im
portant. —M. L. R.
SHORT STORIES OUT OF SO-!
VIET RUSSIA. Translated by
John Cournos. New York: E.
P. Dutton. 1929.
This collection which has escaped j
from the Land of Make-Relieve j
into the Land of Every-Day is of
gripping, tragic stories, a satire,
and an idyl. Above all, these arc
tales of 11iimaii naure and of lint
conflicts of the human soul. There
are swift impressions of the suffer
ing in a northern night in June, of
j Bret Marie heroism in the wilder
! m-ss, of scarcely mortal endurance,
and of infinite unmeant cruelty.
As an example of these tales is
"Other Eyes" by Glieb Aleksev. In
ii a peasant is chopping down a
tree in the forest. All his life he
lias chopped down trees and worked
in his garden. This tree, however,
falls on him and wounds him mor
tally. lie is lying, pinned under the
great tree, when day dawns. Cross
bills are hopping about iri the tops
' of the fir trees picking at the cones.
For the first, lime the peasant sees
these things. Then he thinks of his
long life which lias been wasted for
j lie had never thought before.
Here and there are bits of philo
sophy and wisdom —"At last, Doc
tor Voskresensky was convinced
how much nunc clever he was than j
I. He began to be bored speaking I
In me." And "She died from ty
phoid, but. the significance of her I
life was that she had managed to
[ live out her role in life."
These stories consider an inci
dent, a trait, or a situation. They
are true examples of the short
si ory, which is the portrayal of a
, single thought. —E. P.
