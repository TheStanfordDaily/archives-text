## THE 						EXPENSIVE GAME OF GOLF 
### 
: Tlie Editor, Sir:
It seems only a short time until
the same golf course may be closed
to the student golfer of limited
j finances. Golf on the campus, we
were at first foolish enough to be-
I lieve, could be made possible at a
rate which would insure a reasori-
I able return to the course and stil!
be low enough In permit the aver
age student an opportunity to play
j the game.
We can appreciate the attitude
lof the B.A.C. to make the course
j pay for itself ;is it goes along. The
present $650 deficit in fifty days
( is no doubt due in no small meas
j ure to the rains wliieli have neces
| s.'irily kept the divot-digger off the
j links. The transfer of cards is a
I problem which we can also appre
-1 ciate and should be eliminated.
1 However we still feel that it is
I rather pinching the fellow who
I can't afford too much for his golf.
! Under the new plan a golfer who
has time for only nine holes will

i feel t.lio cost, too prohibitive. After
iill the course, it seems to me, is
or rather should he for (lie stu
dents as much as possible. The ob
ject should be to Rive the students
the opportunity to avail themselves
of the use of the course for a
minimum of expense. In the long
inn if is other student activities
which give the 8.A.0. its revenue
j and make it possible for the i'».A.(\
to put money into a course.
In writing this letter I realize
1 that there are without doubt many
angles of this problem which I
haven't seen which the B.A.C.
would have considered before mak
ing their decision. You may just
consider this the plaintive lament
of an ardent and rabid golf bug.
1 am looking forward to the Spring
Quarter experiment in fees and
memberships on tiie golf course,
hul I fear that 1 shall have to
watch in the gallery and not as an
ambitious nihlic swinger.
Sincerely,
! One of the Hundred-and-Tenners.

In writing this letter I realize
1 that there are without doubt many
angles of this problem which I
haven't seen which the B.A.C.
would have considered before mak
ing their decision. You may just
consider this the plaintive lament
of an ardent and rabid golf bug.
1 am looking forward to the Spring
Quarter experiment in fees and
memberships on tiie golf course,
hul I fear that 1 shall have to
watch in the gallery and not as an
ambitious nihlic swinger.
Sincerely,
! One of the Hundred-and-Tenners.
