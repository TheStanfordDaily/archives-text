# NEW PLAYHOUSE REPLACES FAMOUS OLD ORPHEUM THEATRE OF SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### BY WILLIAM GRACE 
i Four walls and three plaster
J gods that is all that remains of
I the old Orphoum theatre in San
j Francisco. But built up inside, in
the past six months, is a newer and
'
finer playhouse, Erlangers Colnm
i bia Theatre, which will open with
Madge Kennedy in "The Perfect
; Alibi," on Monday night.
Ever since June liO, IBS 7, when
; the original Orpheum lured th<
public with Itosner's Electric Or
chestra, of Budapest, that theatre
lias entertained San Franciscans at
! the same old site on O'Farrell
> street. Though the buildings have
yielded to the ravages of progress
j or earthquakes, a new one has al
j ways replaced it -phoenix-like, on
j the same spot- until last year,
when it "went dark" and lost the
| name of Orpheum.

"Folded up" by the talkies, the
old stager is coming back under a
new name in the finest garb to
heat the audibles by showing 111«•
highest class of drama produced
in America. "Alibi" will be fol
lowed by George M. Cohan's new
est play, "Gambling," written and
played by himself. Then the Ben
Greet Shakespearean troop, Otis
Skinner, William Gillette, and
D'Oyly Carte company of Gilbert
and Sullivan operas.
Designed by G. Albert Lans
burgh, who was also architect for
the Martin Beck theatre in New
i York, Warner Brothers Theatre dn
i Hollywood, and a string of nearly
i forty Orpheum theatres, including

] the one being remodeled now, the
new playhouse is planned with an
intimacy that is revolutionary. It i
is just the antithesis of the As
sembly Hall. The last row of or
chestra seats is only 37 feet from
the stage, and the boxes are so
designed that they have full and
easy view of the stage. The horse
shoe circle on the second floor has j
only seven rows of seats, and leads [
to the refreshment room on the
foyer, where one can have an ice
or glass of soda between acts.
Blue, gold, and beige is the color
scheme carefully followed in walls, |
murals, drapes, and decorations. Al

finishing touches on his four mur

the managers and owners of th<
new playhouse, and the impres

whom David Belasco first got his
start as an usher in San Francisco.
