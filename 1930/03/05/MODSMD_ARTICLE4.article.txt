Eggs! Yellow blotches on
tlu> dignity of sponsorial vests
- thus the most, thrilling chap
ter in the history of Encina
crime was unfolded late Mon
day night.
The august body of peace
protectors was enjoying ice
cream, during a recess in the
fortnightly session, when the
deadly barrage started. Eric
Krenz, better known for his
prowess inside the cinder oval,
was philosophically consider
ing some weighty problem,
when the lirst missile sailed
through the open window and
perched upon his brow. Eggs
of doubtful age followed in
quick succession.
Phil Moffatt's agility on the
gridiron failed to save him
from becoming one of the tar
gets. Virgil Dowell, Cardinal
broad-jumper, took off on a
long leap for the door and
safety, but encountered an
egg in mid-air. Merle Emry,
former Daily editor, in the
act of laughing at his unfor
tunate comrades, was neatly
clipped on the cheek.
It remained for John Mor
rison, track star, to make a
successful dash from the as
sailed room in pursuit of one
of the three fleeing figures
seen outside the hall. The
chase was joined by James
Buscli, former baseball man,
and the two finally cornered
their man in the basement,
where he was found hiding in
a closet.
With astonishing celerity of
procedure, the alleged throw
er was brought to justice and
sentenced to 180 hours' work
at the Convalescence Home,
with the provision that his
two accomplices would each
be permitted to serve 60
hours of the sentence.
