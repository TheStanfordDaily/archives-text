SOPHS TO THE RESCUE!
To the aid of sinking ath
letic crafts, foundering in the
bottomless deep of defeat as
their graduation-riddled hulls
hee! far over, must come a
corps of gap-pluggers in the
persons ot aspiring sophomore
athletes. When the sophs fail
to render the proper assist
ance, the craft is more than
likely to go down. That being
the case, it appears that Skip
per Templeton's majestic ship
is likely to remain seaworthy
for another year at least, if
the performances of various
second-year men in the L.A.A.C.
meet last Saturday are any
criterion.
Topping tiie list, of sparkling ex
hibitions are those >112 Jlaiph Giber-
Kon, stocky sophomore sprinter,
who was more or less personally
responsible for holding Ray Alt',
Hie Winged Mercury dash ace, to
one lone point in the two sprint
affairs, and thus upsetting the cal
culations of the experts who had
Alt' billed for two second places at.
ilit* worst. Gibersort, his driving
style contrasting sharply with
Dyer's easy gliding, finished a bare
yard behind the blond Cardinal
filer in the century, and made
Johnny Morrison step to keep him
out of second place in the furlong.
Tab the youth to make trouble for
Messrs. Maurer, Draper, et al, of
11.5.C.
The fact that Eric Krenz tossed
the discus over 160 feet to win the
event somewhat overshadowed the
performance of George Grey in Ink
ing second place. Grey, who will be
n big help to Ternpleton when he
attains his full growth, twirled the
Creek platter some 144 feet him
self, and worse marks than that
have been known to take a place
in tlie 1.C.4-A. meet.
Next in line was the feat of
Wally Rutler in leaping over 2:'.
feet <! inches to cop second in the
broad jump behind Walker of the
Southerners. Inasmuch ;is Butler's
best as a frosh was under 22 feet,
the improvement is little short of
sensational.
Two other second-year men
also broke into the point col
umn during the afternoon. Bob
Atkinson, running against two
experienced men in Niersbach
and Lovejoy, former Trojan
half-milers, trailed the former
closely for the best part of the
two laps and was "picked" for
second place by Lovejoy only
in the last hundred yards. Ike
Hables, closing fast in the
homestretch, slipped into third
place in the quarter-mile to
shut out the boys from the
Southland in the event, and
then came back to overcome
a two-yard handicap in the re
lay and finish his lap a yard
in front. Possibilities galore,
men. —Dick Friendlich.

style contrasting sharply with
Dyer's easy gliding, finished a bare
yard behind the blond Cardinal
filer in the century, and made
Johnny Morrison step to keep him
out of second place in the furlong.
Tab the youth to make trouble for
Messrs. Maurer, Draper, et al, of
11.5.C.
The fact that Eric Krenz tossed
the discus over 160 feet to win the
event somewhat overshadowed the
performance of George Grey in Ink
ing second place. Grey, who will be
n big help to Ternpleton when he
attains his full growth, twirled the
Creek platter some 144 feet him
self, and worse marks than that
have been known to take a place
in tlie 1.C.4-A. meet.
Next in line was the feat of
Wally Rutler in leaping over 2:'.
feet <! inches to cop second in the
broad jump behind Walker of the
Southerners. Inasmuch ;is Butler's
best as a frosh was under 22 feet,
the improvement is little short of
sensational.
Two other second-year men
also broke into the point col
umn during the afternoon. Bob
Atkinson, running against two
experienced men in Niersbach
and Lovejoy, former Trojan
half-milers, trailed the former
closely for the best part of the
two laps and was "picked" for
second place by Lovejoy only
in the last hundred yards. Ike
Hables, closing fast in the
homestretch, slipped into third
place in the quarter-mile to
shut out the boys from the
Southland in the event, and
then came back to overcome
a two-yard handicap in the re
lay and finish his lap a yard
in front. Possibilities galore,
men. —Dick Friendlich.
