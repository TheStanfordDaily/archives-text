## DEFEAT CARDINAL INDEPENDENTS IN HARD FIGHT, 28-21 Victors Gain First Leg on L. G. Balfour Trophy; Bowers Stars 
### Robert Van Etten 
With each man playing an in
spired game Sigma Chi's intramu
ral basketball quintet downed
Cardinal Independents 28-21 in the
Pavilion last night to win the Uni
versity championship. By this vic
tory Sigma Chi gained the first leg
on the L. C. Balfour basketball
trophy, permanent possession or
which goes to any three-time win
ner.
Imbued with a fighting spirit
from the start of the contest until
the final whistle, the fraternity five
crashed through a hitherto impreg
nable Cardinal defense to establish
a lead which the frenzied last-min
ute efforts of the Cards could not
overcome. Special honors go to
"Whitey" Bowers, speedy forward,
whose deadly accurate shooting
placed him at the top of the
scorers with 13 points.
A tight defense offered by the
Sigma Chi quintet prevented the
Cardinals from making good many
follow-up shots, a practice which
in the past has added much to
their score. Playing a slow-break
ing offense, the Independent team j
was rarely able to work the ball j
in under the bucket.
In the first few minutes of play j
Sigma Chi gained a lead which was
never overcome. Outcome of the
contest was in doubt, however, un
til the closing moments of the
third quarter when three shots by
Joujon-Roche and a long toss by
Bowers increased the Sigma Chi
margin from 10-15 to 24-15. Score
at half time favored the fraternitlv
men 12-9.
Scoring in the last period was
even, with thÂ° Cardinals convert
ing two free throws and hooping
a field goal while Sigma Chi added
two more field goals to their total.
Individually the Cardinals put up
a great game, although their team
! work was not equal to the. task of
[ penetrating the Sigma Chi defense.
Harrison played a spectacular
j game at guard, frequently drib
-1 bling around several opponents,
i Getts hounded the ball all over the
I
court, although his scoring was re-
I stricted to two beautiful shots from
{ the sidelines.
