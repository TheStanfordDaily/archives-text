# STANFORD BOTANIST TO SEEK PLANTS IN LOWER CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
Specimens of plant life on the
peninsula of Lower California will
be collected by Dr. Donald A.
Johansen, research student in the
Department of Botany, who plans
to leave for there today. Edgar
Baxter of U.S.C. will accompany
him on the trip, which is under
the auspices of the National Re
search Council.
The two men intend to gather
certain rare species for the Dudley
Herbarium of Stanford and the
New York Botanical Gardens and
will be gone six or seven weeks.
The west coast and cape region
of Lower California which they
plan to visit are largely uninhab
ited and destitute of such con
veniences as banks, country stores,
and service stations. Certain sup
plies will have to be taken along
and such money as will be needed
must be in the shape of Mexican
silver of small denominations since
it is often difficult there to get
change for even 50 cents Mexican.
