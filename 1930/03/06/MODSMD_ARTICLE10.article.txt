## 
### BY RUTH MINER 
For Joseph Ponalidine, traveling
I manager for I in; Kedroff quartet,
which is to appear at the Stanford
: Pavilion Monday night at 8:15 on 1
the students' concert series, work
is not just a matter of getting the
non-Knglish-speaking members of ,
! the Russian ensemble to their con- I
' certs on time.
Weeds must also be included in
Hie scheme of tilings. Last season
I Professor Constantin Kedroff, the i
basso profunda, on a country hike I
! in I'Jast Aurora, New York, dlscov
ered some tall, wooly weeds which i
I struck his fan< y. So as the twenty,
j first piece of luggage the weeds i
| were c arried throifgh Buffalo, Chi
cago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Win
, nipeg, Seattle, and Salt Francisco,
! and finally reached Paris at the
i end of the season. I
I. K. Denisoff, first tenor, is a
great lover of hikes and is deter- ;
mined to find woods and birds
everywhere, while T. K, Kasakoff, |

second tenor, roams the city taking
snapshots of the most interesting
sites. Professor N. N. Kedroc, bari
tone, leader and founder of the
Quartet, finds in chess a love sec
ond only to his music, according
to press reports.
"They are delightful human be
ings, these Russians," writes the
'Carmelite,' "with something child
like and fresh about them even
when they are most urbane. We
hear of the charm of their response
to the landscape of tin; peninsula.
'Would you be so kind and let us
get out of the car here just for a
moment? We should like so much
to climb the ience to see that
strange flower over there?' The car
stops. Four quartetists negotiate
the fence, approach the blossom,
exclaim at its beauty, and return
as happy—or rather, merry—as
youngsters."
Seats for the concert are on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office and at Dod
son's for $1, $1.50, and |2.
