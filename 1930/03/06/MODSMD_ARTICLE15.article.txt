"The greatest contribution to
music of the reformation period is i
■the reflection of human suffering j
j as shown in Handel and Bach," j
; said Warren 1). Allen, University
j organist, in his lecture last night,
I on the two composers. He was as
l sisted by Waldo Furgason, bari-
J tone.
Bach is not I lie dry pedant which !
, he is commonly thought to be, ac- \
cording to Allen, but shows human, j
j subtle, and poetic qualities. He is j
j prophetic of modern music, as i
| shown in Chopin, and of the mod-j
I ern dissonance in the passion "St. J
i Mathews," which vas played by A!- j
; len to illustrate tliis point.
Bach and Handel show a siini- j
j larity in their compositions which!
were written to show technique,!
but are widely different in their j
1 greater works. Handel shows an j
Italian influence which depends j
upon a solo melody in most works, i
j Bach, however, is not satisfied j
I with one melody, but weaves nu-!
1 merous melodies around the solo. !
His music is interesting without!
I the principle melody. Allen con-1
trusted "Largo" as written by Han- j
del and as probably would have j
j been written by Bach.
