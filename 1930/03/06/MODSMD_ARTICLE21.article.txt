PARIS, March 5. (/P) â€”Latest es
i timates of the dead in the floods
| which have swept southern and
central France place the total at
300, and the material losses prob
ably will be near one billion francs
($40,000,000).
The number of dead will not be
| definitely known until the ruins of
| crumbled houses have been cleared j
j away.
Towns are devastated, their j
i houses and other buildings totter- i
| ing. Householders have been swept j
! away wtih their homes; thousand's j
j of others have been rescued from
| roofs and tree tops. In the import
ant wine-making regions a thick j
i brown slime covers the soil, and j
! it is feared the effects on the vine- !
1 yards will be disastrous.
The rivers Tarn and Correze re
j ceded today, but the Garonne, the
j Orbiel and some lesser streams
j rose, giving new threats to prop
i erty and life.
