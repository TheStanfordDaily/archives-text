# THE 						INNER QUAD FOR GRADUATION
## 
### 
The senior class proposal to hold graduation exercises in some
place that has greater seating capacity than the Memorial Church
is one which should receive general support.
(objections will prohahly be raised to the idea on sentimental
grounds, the church having long been the heart of the Stanford
campus from the standpoints of geography, romance, and fame.
And such arguments are not to be easily discounted. After all.
tradition has associated the church with Stanford weddings and
Stanford graduations for a great many years.
Arguments on the other side, however, seem to definitely out
weigh whatever sentiment that may arise against the proposal. The
Memorial Church, however beautiful, is entirely too small for such
a function.
Kacli year hundreds of friends, and even relatives, of the grad
uating seniors are unable to witness the ceremony simply because
of the limited space. And even though the university graduation
mav not mean what it once did, it is still an important occasion—
important to the principals and their friends and kinsmen, at least.
The Inner Ouad, directly in front of the entrance to the church,
is the most appealing of the suggested substitutes. The seating
capacity there would be almost unlimited, and its proximity to the
mosaic facade of the church should satisfy those who would object
to removing the ceremony entirely from that building.
