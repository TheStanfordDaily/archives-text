# STANFORD'S CULTURE SUFFERS FROM LACK OF SUPPORT
## 
### 
The A.S.S.l'.'s contribution to the cultural background of the
3,000-odd students who attend the I'niversity is on the verge of
being discontinued, unless the students, who are members of the
A.S.S.I'., support the Concert Series. By sale of more than $300
worth of tickets to the KedrofT Quartet performance here Monday
night, the present deficit: of the Series m<ly be covered and the
Scries saved for another year.
This sale can be accomplished only through the attendance at
ihe concert of tlie students themselves. If the students have the
opportunity to hear the concert they should do so, for a lack of
support at Monday night's concert will lead to definite action which
may banish such a worthwhile institution from the campus.
Regardless of the fact that the Kxecutive Committee may con
sider the Series to be of such value to the students as to warrant
payment of the deficit from the student body treasury, it is almost
needless to point out that the concerts would continue to lose in
patronage and in interest. An organization supporting itself to a
large extent would naturally be ready to take immediate advantage
of the best talent that was offered. A wholly subsidized series
would be content to take the cheapest.
The salvation of the Series can be accomplished only through
the attendance of the students themselves. If there is a large group
<ui this campus that honestly believes in the cultural worth of the
Series —believes in it enough to attend the KedrofT presentation
ii can be saved. This concert Monday night is of vital importance
as far as the continuation of the series is concerned.
