# STORM CLOUDS IN THE PHILIPPINES
## 
### 
Ten thousand .Manila high school students are demonstrating j
I\vo aspects of the Filipino campaign for insular independence. ()ne I
of those aspects definitely indicates that there is firm ground for ;
nationalistic contentions, hut that other as definitely points to the
necessity for further training in the observance of legal and demo
cratic. methods of attaining desired ends.
.Manila students are staging a city-wide strike because they feel
that one of the \merican teachers insulted the Filipino race in !
reprimanding several students for misconduct, according to press i
dispatches from the Islands. Their resentment is indicative of an (
intense nationalism which is certainly a strong argument for inde
pendence. But their method of solving the problem confronting
them proves that peaceable and democratic training has not yet pro- j
gressed far enough to warrant the granting of complete self-govern-!
ntent for some time to come.
After all. the only hope for F'ilipino independence is to prove.
1o the people of the I'nited States that the race is fitted to cope
with the problems of democratic government. They cannot possibly
build sympathetic public opinion in the States by resorting to vio
lence or mob tactics of any kind. Attempts to force the issue will
find opposition solidified. Education aiming at the creation of a
sympathetic attitude here is the only avenue open; rioting defeats
the purpose of an entire race.
