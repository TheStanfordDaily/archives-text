LACQUER LADY. By F. Tennyson I
Jesse. McMillan Co. New
York. 1930.
Ancient Burma in :ill its splen- \
dor is the setting of this internal- 1
ing story by P. Tennyson Jesse.
The book tells of Burma under its
last two greal native rulers, King
Mini loon ami King Thibaw of Kip
ling fame, ending with the British
conquest. These historical events
are woven into a story of the life
of the lacquer hidv, the daughter
ol an Italian and a Burmese half- i
caste.
Pahn.v, I he lady, is firsl seen al
school in England, she then re-!
turns to Burma where she becomes j
I lie favorite of Thibaw's chief 1
queen, Supaya hit. Intrigues at tbe I
gorgeous courl of Mandalay are !
thick and furious. I^itll(> Panny at
llie center of lhem, plays the role '
of so many other women in history
by causing the downfall of the
royal family in her pursuit of re
venge. In so doing she inadvertedly
pulls the scheme of her own life
into ruins.
Miss Jesse lived for many years
in Burma collecting material for
her story. Her sources are authen
tic and one may rely in her facts.
Her desertions of Mandalay are i
vivid and beautiful.
Miss Jesse lias presented some 1
very remarkable characters. Very
living characters they are. In fact ;
at times their silly, shallow im- ]
pulses are almost too sordid, too j
real to be pleasing. "Lacquer
Lady" cannot be called a pleasing
book. It is not pleasant to see
dainty little Panny lose her glam- j
our and become a fat, near-sighted j
old lady. That is life, however, arid j

(Miss Jesse, in spite of (lie fantasy
Of the Eaßt, lias painted renlity.
"Lacquer Lady" is not a great
'book; it lias no profoundness of
; thought; (tarries no message, but
it is good presentation of a fasei
i mating history. —N. J.

LACQUER LADY. By F. Tennyson I
Jesse. McMillan Co. New
York. 1930.
Ancient Burma in :ill its splen- \
dor is the setting of this internal- 1
ing story by P. Tennyson Jesse.
The book tells of Burma under its
last two greal native rulers, King
Mini loon ami King Thibaw of Kip
ling fame, ending with the British
conquest. These historical events
are woven into a story of the life
of the lacquer hidv, the daughter
ol an Italian and a Burmese half- i
caste.
Pahn.v, I he lady, is firsl seen al
school in England, she then re-!
turns to Burma where she becomes j
I lie favorite of Thibaw's chief 1
queen, Supaya hit. Intrigues at tbe I
gorgeous courl of Mandalay are !
thick and furious. I^itll(> Panny at
llie center of lhem, plays the role '
of so many other women in history
by causing the downfall of the
royal family in her pursuit of re
venge. In so doing she inadvertedly
pulls the scheme of her own life
into ruins.
Miss Jesse lived for many years
in Burma collecting material for
her story. Her sources are authen
tic and one may rely in her facts.
Her desertions of Mandalay are i
vivid and beautiful.
Miss Jesse lias presented some 1
very remarkable characters. Very
living characters they are. In fact ;
at times their silly, shallow im- ]
pulses are almost too sordid, too j
real to be pleasing. "Lacquer
Lady" cannot be called a pleasing
book. It is not pleasant to see
dainty little Panny lose her glam- j

old lady. That is life, however, arid j
