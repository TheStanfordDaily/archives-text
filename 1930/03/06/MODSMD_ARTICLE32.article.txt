# LARGE-SCALE ATHLETICS CAUSE BREAK

(THE DE PAUW EDITORIAL)

In taking steps to break athletic
relations with Butler, tlie DePauw
committee lias accomplished what
seems to he the only remedy for a
situation that has been growing
steadily worse in the last l'ew
years. Feelings between the two
schools were none too good at the
time of the break in 1927, when
purely financial considerations
caused the cancellation of athletic
engagements; since then the
breach has been steadily widening
and the renewal of relations with
the Indianapolis school has only
served to intensify the feeling of
animosity between the two cam
puses.
There was a time when DePauw
and Butler were natural rivals;
then they were two schools of prac
tically the same temperaments, at
tempting to do about the same

I tilings in the fields of education
and athletics. Since the attempt
of Butler to enter into athletics on
a large scale any basis of natural
rivalry has been completely de- (
stroved and DePauw authorities do |
not feel that under the present
conditions the two schools should
compete.
It has been stressed in the letter
j from the athletic committee to But
â€¢ ler authorities that the break is a
friendly one; that the break should
I come in this manner is the only j
way to prevent embarrassing diffi- j
culties in the future. If time should
prove to cool off the feeling exist
ing between the two campuses, and
if once more DePauw and Butler
might compete on a basis more :
nearly approaching that in the i
past, perhaps relations may be j
| again restored.
