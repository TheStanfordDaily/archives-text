Today's cleanest thrill is offered
| in an interview in the University
of Washington Daily. It seems that
the Washington campus has four
tall columns. One of them was
knocked over in a high Wind.
Now go on with the story:
". . . 'It was Loyalty that
i fell today,' said Prof. Meany,
! . and these others are Industry,
Faith, and Efficiency. . . . One
time, when tin; columns were
I up in their original place, this
last one —efficiency—fell down.'
"Prof. Meany gazed at the
I column again as the lowering
sun cast, a faint red glow over
the shaft. His face changed to
I a serene smile, as he raised
his head. 'Even though this
| column has fallen,' he mused,
'the spirit of Loyalty which ii
symbolizes will stand, forever,
in the Life of Washington. The
Columns will stand always.' "
Fancy writin', we calls it.

Just think Mli.il it must bo to
have something; like those Columns
to inspire you all the time!
It's pretty funny that the Loyal
ty one should fall down so soon
after the Bagshaw business, how
ever.
And Efficiency doubtless took its
tumble about Ihe time thai Presi
dent Suzzallo moved out.
If we only had some Ideals down
in this "neck o' th' woods"!
Something fine and uplifting, like
an elevator in Encina Hall.
Did you ever live on the fifth
floor?
Speaking of Encina reminds us,
that eggs are now at a premium
in local food shoppes.
The demand is said to exceed
the supply.
And there is an unprecedented
call for RAW eggs.
These Health Faddists!
In fact, Encina Store is said to
he concocting a Sponsor Special.
Local cooking note: The
freshmen iit Encina Hull, Stan
ford University, have discov
ered a delightful new "goodie"

which is declared to create a j
striking effect both internally
and externally, if is a sort, of
»>gg omelet, hut is spread on
the pan by a new culinary trick
known as "flinging."
Bring the sponsor to a boil.
Serve on the vest.

You know, it's remarkable how !
much they can find to do out at :
that old Convalescent Home. '

Speaking of Encina reminds us,
that eggs are now at a premium
in local food shoppes.
The demand is said to exceed
the supply.

call for RAW eggs.

You know, it's remarkable how !
much they can find to do out at :
that old Convalescent Home. '
Today's cleanest thrill is offered
| in an interview in the University
of Washington Daily. It seems that
the Washington campus has four
tall columns. One of them was
knocked over in a high Wind.
Now go on with the story:
". . . 'It was Loyalty that
i fell today,' said Prof. Meany,
! . and these others are Industry,
Faith, and Efficiency. . . . One
time, when tin; columns were
I up in their original place, this
last one —efficiency—fell down.'
"Prof. Meany gazed at the
I column again as the lowering
sun cast, a faint red glow over
the shaft. His face changed to
I a serene smile, as he raised
his head. 'Even though this
| column has fallen,' he mused,
'the spirit of Loyalty which ii
symbolizes will stand, forever,
in the Life of Washington. The
Columns will stand always.' "
Fancy writin', we calls it.

Just think Mli.il it must bo to
have something; like those Columns
to inspire you all the time!
It's pretty funny that the Loyal
ty one should fall down so soon
after the Bagshaw business, how
ever.
And Efficiency doubtless took its
tumble about Ihe time thai Presi
dent Suzzallo moved out.
If we only had some Ideals down
in this "neck o' th' woods"!
Something fine and uplifting, like
an elevator in Encina Hall.
