OUT OF A LENGTHY SLUMP
Now that the varsity baseball
dub is off to its best start in mod
ern times, the fans about these
liiirts are beginning to show signs
of interest in the national pastime.
The peanut-cracking multi
tude that cluttered up the
bleachers of the old campus
ball park last Saturday was
the largest to witness a chuck
ing contest on the Farm, aside
from the annual world series
with Cal, since the days when
Ernie Nevers used to win his
no-hit games by slamming out
a home run or two.
Last year at this time, anywhere
from fifty on down to zero spec
tators flocked to i lie grandstand,
usually to sleep through a comedy
oi errors. Frequently, only llie
players and managers were pres
ent to razz the umpire.
It must be remembered, however,
that no student admission price
was charged last Saturday. In l'act,
sen Is will be provided free and
gratis to all games but the [I.e.
engagements tliis spring.
Not that the B.A.C. moguls
are getting at all big-hearted.
It is merely their subtle way
of drumming up trade and an
honest effort to raise college
baseball out of its slump into
minor sport circles during the
past decade.
Yet, if as good a brand of base
ball as was played last week-end
continues to be dished out in the
luture, it won't be long before the
sport-loving students gladly fork
over a quarter or so for an after
noon's diamond entertainment.
For although handicapped by
the loss of Captain William
Laird, the nine actually shows
promise of professional talent,
and the players are displaying
as much pep as a bunch of
rookies trying to break into
the big time.
It looks as though Coach Harry
M. Welter lias one of the best col
lege pitchers on the coast in the
personage of one Perry Taylor.
Taylor was too erratic last
spring to last more than one
or two innings at best. The
ball club nearly went on the
rocks financially recouperating
its stock of balls, which he so
wildly tossed over the grand
stand.
Now he is the best, bet among
tlie moundsmen, having won two
out of three starts to date and last
ing t lie full nine innings on each
occasion, including last Saturday's
deciding Santa (Mara series game.
Rudy Rintala, soph slugger,
has blosomed out into the
team's leading hitter. He takes
a healthy cut at the horsehide
every time he gets up at bat.
Last week-end Babe Rintala
merely socked one over the
fence for a home run and
clouted out a three-bagger.
Another likely youth is Dykes
Johnson, regular shortstop. John
son made a couple of sensational
plays against Santa Clara, spear
ing a hot grounder over second
base with one hand on the dead
run in the third frame. Later he
snagged in a line -'rive that was
labeled for a sure two bases.
At any rate. Wolter's nine is
way up in the Conference
standings, wh : ch have not ad
vanced very far due to the re
cent downpours, and we look
for the boys to clean up on
California. That would be most
unusual and quite as welcome
as a basketball win over the
Blue and Gold.
