# OLYMPIC CLUB IS DOPED TO DEFEAT CARD TRACK TEAM
## 'Come Through' Ability of Men Will Again Be Put to Test 
### 
For the second time in two
weeks, the Cardinal track and field
team will meet an aggregation of
stars doped to overwhelm them in
the field when they take on the
Olympic Club at the Stadium Sat
urday afternoon. And for the sec
ond time, also, Templeton must
rely on "come through" perform
anced by his track men to have a
chance to win the meet. Last Sat
urday, the weakness of the Cards
in the field was clearly shown when
L.A.A.C. scored 2() 1 ,4 points out of
the total of 54 in the six field
events, despite Rolhert's upset of
Brix in the shot.
Former. wearers of the Cardinal
are likely to spell defeat for the
Stanford team Saturday, both on
the track and in the field. Ward
Edmonds will vault against his old
enemy, Jack Williams, but this
time as a teammate. Stanford's
only chance is l'or Berry to take a
third over Guerrera of the Club.
Coggeshall, Filmer, Marty, and
Levy of the club should have little
trouble annexing the points in the
high jump, for all of them are 0
feet 2 inch jumpers, or better,
while none of the Card entries have
done better than 6 feet 1. Kim
Dyer of the Winged '(),' and a
Cardinal mainstay in llie broad
jump two years ago, leaped 24
feet a month ago and should win.
Martin of the club lias also made
24 feet, and did his best jumping
j when he won his event at the
Fresno Relays at only a little less
than 25 feet.
Peters, Olsen, and Curtis expect
to sweep the javelin. However,
Dink may have Rothert throw, as
he will not have to fear the club
men in the shot. He should take a
third at least, though lie would
have no chance against Peters if
advance reports are correct. Unless
Biff Hoffman has done a lot of
work in secret on the shot and
discus, the Cards should sweep
both events.
