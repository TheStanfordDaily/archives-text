## 
### 
A Hit a very creditable opening
performance, the freshman track
loam lias now turned its attention
to the next meet which happen** to
he with the Sacramento Junior Col
lege, coached by Ted E. Shipkey,
a former Stanford star,
in the meet with the Alameda
County All-Stars last Saturday,
Coach Hill Ellington discovered
point possibilities that he did not
know existed; consequently he will
send his men against the more ex
perienced junior college men with
more assurance than previously
displayed.
However, the woeful weakness
still remains in the javelin. It' Ted
Shipkey has imparted to his men
any of the knowledge of spear-tos
sing which he acquired while com
peting for the Cards, his team has
nine points practically cinched be
fore the meet begins. Gerald Dunn,
who can throw the javelin close to
170 feel, has been the latest frosh
prospect in this event to be ruled
ineligible, leaving but one man
with more than a week's experience
in this event.
Bill Hates, who has been tossing
the spear for only two weeks, was
kept out of the last meet by in
juries and may not be back throw
ing this week either. That leaves
but two men, Irving Tway and
.Reginald Meade. They just report
ed this week from basketball.
