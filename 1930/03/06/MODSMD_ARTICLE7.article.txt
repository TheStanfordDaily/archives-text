# Ex-President Taft Continues To Gain In Battle For Life
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 5. (A 1 )â€”
The condition of former Chief Jus
tice Taft was slightly improved
today.
The former chief justice spoke
to his nurse this morning and ap
peared to have continued the
slight improvement which during
the past few days had caused some
of the fear that; death was immi
nent to dissipate. The attendants,
however, said there had been noth
ing to indicate any error in the
verdict by his physicians that his
case was hopeless.
The physicians, Dr. Francis R.
Hagner and Thomas A. Clayton,
did not make their usual visit late
last night. It was the first time
that they had failed to call late at
night since last Wednesday when
it was thought that Mr. Taft could
live only a few hours.
