the shoe
called "Deivin"
Here is an oxford that has caused quite a
commotion in our Men's Shop during the
few days since its arrival. We arc inclined to
be somewhat nonchalant about striking new
footwear styles here at SommerSc Ivautmann,
because, as you no doubt know, the arrival ot
distinctive new models is an everyday occur
ancc. But when this oxford, called Dclvin,
was unpacked even our unruffled attitude
was challenged ... for here is a custom last
.with the same fine lines as our highest priced
footwear, fashioned, of very fine grade calf,
(black or tan), and finished oft with a real
craltbmaiA t . an J only ?io.
