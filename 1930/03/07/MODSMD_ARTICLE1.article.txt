# 'RED THURSDAY' MASS UPRISING SWEEPS NATION
## Nearly 100 Jailed in New York as Paraders Riot; Many Sent to Hospital Washington Police Employ Tear Gas Bombs, Night Sticks to Disperse Mob 
### (By Associated Press 
On historic old Boston Common, in
tiic newer campus Martins of Detroit,
on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the
high iron fence that surrounds the
White House grounds, in New York's
Union Square facing the Tammany
wigwam, in the hills of Seattle, and in
the roaring canyons of Chicago, tens
of thousands of Americans gathered
on "Red Thursday.''
Some of them were in jail today,
and some in hospitals. Hundreds
nursed lacerated scalps, black eyes,
bruised noses. And the rest, thou
sands on thousands, had gone peace
fully back to flats and bungalows, en
joying the exhiliation of having seen
"a real show."
With nearly 100 injured and almost
as many arrested, including William
Foster, presidential candidate of
the Workers' Communist party in
1928, New York's demonstration was
the biggest.
In Detroit 12 were reported injured
and 23 arrested. A crowd estimated
by Detroit police at 100,000 jammed
into the Campus Martins and Cadil
lac Square, backing up into Wood
ward avenue half a mile from city
hall. Two thousand police finally
cleared them out —partly by running
busses and street cars through the
mobs.
In Washington, the police used a
tear gas bomb and their night sticks
to disperse a smaller crowd that gath
ered outside the White House grounds.
Twelve were arrested.
In Cleveland 3,000 paraded to the
city hall, and 15,000 more gathered in
public square. Mounted police charged
in and broke up the demonstration.
There were also peaceful demon
strations ir. Chicago, Baltimore, Char
lotte, N.C., Oakland, Calif., Houston,
Texas.

On historic old Boston Common, in
tiic newer campus Martins of Detroit,
on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the
high iron fence that surrounds the
White House grounds, in New York's
Union Square facing the Tammany
wigwam, in the hills of Seattle, and in
the roaring canyons of Chicago, tens
of thousands of Americans gathered
on "Red Thursday.''
Some of them were in jail today,
and some in hospitals. Hundreds
nursed lacerated scalps, black eyes,
bruised noses. And the rest, thou
sands on thousands, had gone peace
fully back to flats and bungalows, en
joying the exhiliation of having seen
"a real show."
With nearly 100 injured and almost
as many arrested, including William
Foster, presidential candidate of
the Workers' Communist party in
1928, New York's demonstration was
the biggest.
