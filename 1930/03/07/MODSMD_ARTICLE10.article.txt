# HACKETT SKETCHES HISTORY OF DOMINICAN INSURGENT MOVEMENT
## 
### BY RAWSON HOLMES 
i The recent insurgent movement
I in the Dominican Republic and vir
i tual overthrow of the Vasquez gov
ernment. was outlined to a Daily
j reporter yesterday by Charles Wil
son Hackett, acting professor of
i Latin American History, as one
i 1 hat had a purely constitutional
I and peaceful ending.
"President Mora,do Vasnne/, whs
! n very unpopular executive," I'ro
! fessor Hackctt staled. "The people
i put up with him, however, hoping
| that, they would be rid of him at
t the end of his constitutional term
! this year. When he announced his
I intention to re-enter his name on
the presidential ballots next May,
! it was the 'straw that brokA the
camel's back'.
"Every part of the country
turned agains' him with the ex
ception of a single fort in the capi
tal, Santo Domingo," he continued.
"The movement was so popular
that only a few skirmishes oc
curred and no blood was shed. Vas-

I quex sought refuge in the Ameri
j can legation, where our minister
1 acted as a mediator between him
j and the leaders of the insurgent
j movement.
"According to the Dominican
constitution, in default of the presi-
I dent, and the vice-president the
| executive office is exercised hy the
' Minister of the Interior. Under the
I arrangement agreed upon the vice
president formally resigned and
President Vasquez, on the plea of
i ill health, asked for an indefinite
; leave of absence from the country,
j At the same time he appointed a
cabinet headed by the leader of
the insurgents, Goneral Rafael Es
! trella Urena, who, as Minister of
j the Interior, automatically suc
ceeded as constitutional acting
president. Meanwhile Vasqticz re
mains theoretically constitutional
president during his leave of ab
sence. Thus the arrangement, re
mains perfectly legal."
Because of the de jure status of
the new regime, Professor Hackett
pointed out that no embarrassing
question arose concerning recogni
tion by the United States,
if the new government had come
into power by unconstitutional
methods our Latin American policy
would have prohibited such action.
"General Urena is a very able
man," lie concluded. "Although
only thirty-eight years old, he has
served as minister of justice and
public instruction and as minister
to France. For awhile he served
under the Vasquez administration,
but in recent years has been a
leader of the opposition to him."
