# DANCE DRAMA IS WELL RECEIVED
## "Nutcracker Suite" Shows Pleasing Continuity 
### Catherine Spaulding 
Displaying an appreciation for
the natural dance, a large audience
enjoyed the annual dance drama
given last night by the dance com
position class under the direction
of Cecelia Mclntyre.
The 13 solo and small group
dances were tlie most outstanding
and the."Storm Wave" done by
Beth Pinkston to the music of
"Peer Gynt Suite" by Grieg showed
excellent technique and interpreta
tion. A grotesque by Victoria
Schuck, "The Cuckoo Clock," was
well worked out and interpreted
the natural dance in one of its dif
ferent moods.
"Natoma Dagger Dance" by
Catherine Musante, fantastic in
lighting and costume effects, and
"Lament" by Marienne Smith were
striking character dances con
trasted by the lighter interpreta
tions of "Petit Point" and "Bo
Peep" done to the music of Aren
sky and Debussy.
The dances in the"The Nut
cracker Suite" by Tschaikowsky
showed nice continuity, and the
moods of the music were well in
terpreted, seldom slipping into
pure pantomime. Dorothy Kimber
lin, as the little girl, and Elizabeth
Ann Lynch, the nutcracker, were
charming in their roles of make
believe. Interesting dances in the
suite were "Dance of the Sugar
Plum Fairy," "Arab Dance," and
the finale "Waltz of the Flowers."
The dark background and the
lighting used throughout was very
effective and set off (lie impres
sionistic costumes well.
