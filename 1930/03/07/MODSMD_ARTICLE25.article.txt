# JOHN BUELNA, MENLO RESIDENT, RECALLS FIRST FOUNDERS' DAY
## 
### BY RUTH ROSS 
Among the lew who remember the
first Founders' Day, which is to he
commemorated tomorrow, is John
Ituclna, of Menlo Park, who was em
ployed as a workman in the construc-
I tion of the University in 1891. liuelna
was horn in 1844, on the old Rancho
San I'rancisequito, which is now part
<>112 the L Diversity on the Menlo side
of the San l ; rancis(|tiito neck.
In talking to a Daily reporter yes
terday, ltuelna told of his experience
working on the concrete-mixing when
the Memorial Arch was being built.
Fifteen years later he was working in
Woodside when the earthquake came,
and heard the loud noise that reached
him from Stanford which signified the
j falling of University buildings, includ
ing much of his own work, lie rc-
J members very little of the Stanford
family, excepting that he used to see
Senator Stanford riding in his coach,
while Mrs. Stanford and I.eland Stan
ford, Jr., rode together in another
c< tacli.
The most vivid recollections of the

region that Buclua retains air those j
connected with the mysterious French- j
man, l'eter Coutts, who owned most ,
of the land the campus is on now. !
liuelna says that the harm was greatly !
improved when Coutts bought it from ,
the Spanish, since the Frenchman;
. built lakes and gardens. Rumor has it. j
that Coutts was exiled from a Kuro- '
j pcau country for theft, and was snd- j
denly loreed to leave here to escapel
1 his pursuers. Nevertheless, liuelna '
maintains that "lie was a line fellow j
I to know," in spite of his reputation.
Buclua tells of the laborers who j
worked for the Frenchman. Coutts
paid them by the day, observing their
presence at the beginning and end of
each day. Consequently it became the
custom to appear in the morning and
evening, and spend the rest of the day
as one pleased.

Buclua tells of the laborers who j
worked for the Frenchman. Coutts
paid them by the day, observing their
presence at the beginning and end of
each day. Consequently it became the
custom to appear in the morning and
evening, and spend the rest of the day
as one pleased.

Among the lew who remember the
first Founders' Day, which is to he
commemorated tomorrow, is John
Ituclna, of Menlo Park, who was em
ployed as a workman in the construc-
I tion of the University in 1891. liuelna
was horn in 1844, on the old Rancho
San I'rancisequito, which is now part
<>112 the L Diversity on the Menlo side
of the San l ; rancis(|tiito neck.
In talking to a Daily reporter yes
terday, ltuelna told of his experience
working on the concrete-mixing when
the Memorial Arch was being built.
Fifteen years later he was working in
Woodside when the earthquake came,
and heard the loud noise that reached
him from Stanford which signified the
j falling of University buildings, includ
ing much of his own work, lie rc-
J members very little of the Stanford
family, excepting that he used to see
Senator Stanford riding in his coach,
while Mrs. Stanford and I.eland Stan
ford, Jr., rode together in another
c< tacli.
The most vivid recollections of the

region that Buclua retains air those j
connected with the mysterious French- j
man, l'eter Coutts, who owned most ,
of the land the campus is on now. !
liuelna says that the harm was greatly !
improved when Coutts bought it from ,
the Spanish, since the Frenchman;
. built lakes and gardens. Rumor has it. j
that Coutts was exiled from a Kuro- '
j pcau country for theft, and was snd- j
denly loreed to leave here to escapel
1 his pursuers. Nevertheless, liuelna '
maintains that "lie was a line fellow j
I to know," in spite of his reputation.
