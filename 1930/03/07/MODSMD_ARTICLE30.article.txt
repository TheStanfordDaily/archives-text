Stanford calls itself one of the leading lights in the educational
firmament. Ilut of its more material lights—those of street illumina
tion—Stanford can he no braggart.
The winds of freedom may blow here on the barm, but very

I'.ven Jonah probably possessed a lanthorn when lie took his
famous ride down a whale's gullet, and having such illumination he
had ilie advantage over denizens of this campus who fare forth
alter midnight. I "or Jonah was able to inspect with ease the endo
derniic wallpaper of his abdominal stateroom, while Stanford auto
mobilists and pedestrians must trust to instinct or a sixth sense if
thev have any interest in their immediate surroundings for most
of Stanford's street lights are conspicuous bv their darkness after
\ > o'clock.
Perhaps Jonah wasn't bothered with 11 nam ial matters which
tend to restrict the pocket book, but even id" he had been it seems

Stanford's lack of readv cash probably can be cited as one of
the reasons why complete darkness encompasses the campus during
Ihe early morning hours. Hut such economy is achieved at the
expense of running into telephone poles and stepping in mud pud
dies—mishaps which, after all, might result seriously.

lights strikes a responsive chord in the powers that be, the I ).\ll.n
wishes to entreat that its plaint not be taken too seriously.
This does not applv to the Cactus Hardens.
