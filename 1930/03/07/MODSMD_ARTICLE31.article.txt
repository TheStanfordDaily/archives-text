# "LET 'EM PARADE"
## 
### 
11l the dilemma facing the police forces of a good part of ihe
world in the unemployment demonstrations staged yesterday, the
stalement made bv Chief ot Police William J. Quinn, ot San
Francisco. reveals a keen knowledge of mob psychology.
"Sure, let em parade." sUvs the chief. "Nobody has asked lor
a police permit to parade, but anybody who wants to parade in San
Francisco may do so if he creates no disturbance and violates no
laws." The police chief even offers the Communists in the city a
mounted police escort if they want it.
This method of allowing rioters to blow oil "unemployment
steam brings to mind the radical meetings in Hyde Park in Lon
don. I nmolested by authorities, the so-called critics of the gov
ernment talk by the hour to mass meetings, and the government
goes peacefullv on with it- business, while the wind goes out of
radical sails.
The policv of repression in regard to demonstrations and up
risings often encourages and crystallizes feeling which is indefinite
;md incoherent. In regard to this police method the executive secre
tarv of the Socialist party yesterday made a statement asserting
that police brutality in dealing with unemployment demonstrations
was fanning "the now dormant but extensive dissatistaction with
the present industrial system."
Discontent with conditions is being voiced in many parts of the
world, although the real causes of the seething unrest are varied.
Nationalist feeling in India is placing the liritish government in a
critical economic situation, and the cry for independence sweeps
over the Pacific from the Philippines. These demonstrations have
their root- deep in political, economic, and social conditions.
The unrest in the I'nited States probably traces back to the
economic conditions and the recent Wall Street crash. However,
the Communists need not make themselves martyrs to the cause of
economic discontent for the nation, one-hundred and ten million
individuals, is feeling the effects of the Wall Street disaster.
This sentiment i- again expressed by San Francisco's chief when
he says to the press: "I am in full sympathy with all good men out
of work." \nd indeed the Communistâ€”all of San Francisco's
might do well to think twice before they demonstrate a dissatisfac
tion for which they may have just cause in some parts of the world
but an economic situation which shows its American lend' ncv
in its very democratic way of hitting everyone
