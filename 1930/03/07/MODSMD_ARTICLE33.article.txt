## SOMETHING ABOUT THE CONCERT SERIES 
### 
The Editor, Sir: t
Tt. is indeed disheartening to
learn from the editorial section of
1 his morning's daily, Iha 1 culture
at Stanford is sadly on Hie wane,
due -to lack of support of the
A.S.S.T. concert series. However,
it might be pointed out that pos
sibly there is something more back
of this indifference than mere boor-,
ish lack of appreciation of the j
"finer things of life."
The people who run the concert
series have been very diligent in j
securing artists with high-sounding
names and nation-wide reputation.
But this, unfortunately, is nol
enough; there is also need of hav
ing a program presented by the
musician or group of musicians
scheduled to appear. The sad li'uth
of the matter is, apparently, that
ihese good people (i.e., the artists)
psycho-analyze their audience, for
the purpose of deciding what sort
of program would be most appro
priate. The results are most, disas
trously inaccurate. The keen dis
appointment expressed by 1 hose
who attended the Zimbalist recital
is indicative of this.
Also, we must take our orches
tras and soloists whenever Ihey
find it convenient to come, whether
it be on Monday, Tuesday, or Sat
urday 11 igilt. Hence it is often im
possible for students to attend a

i recital, and Situ Francisco attrac
tions which can be arranged and
planned for in advance are given
preference over the local presenta
t ion.
It might hp added that the Pa
vilion is large and draughty; the
seating arrangement is very poor;
the seats themselves are hard and
uncomfortable; the acoustics are
very poor; et cetera, at least "ad
plenit udinem."
This letter is not intended as a
jcomplaint against the concert
series or its managers. It will he
noted that all of the difficulties
named are beyond the control of
those who are connected with the
enterprise.
However, most certainly they
j would do better to leave out of
'their pleas for support the familiar
! plaint that vigorous and hearty
co-operation with the concert series
is the only possible means of sav-
I ing culture and civilization at Stan
lord. If the concert series cannot
stand on its own merit, it is not
contributing enough to lhe aes
thetic well-being of the student
â€¢body to warrant the wepl-for con
i 11 ibutions.
| Al any rate, the bewailing of a
lost culture seems to be a most
ignoble and unfitting means of
raising the annual hue and cry for
i support.
