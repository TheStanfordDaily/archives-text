# WE'RE SORRY, MR. MASTERS
## 
### 
The lOditor, Sir:
Vow that we. ilip taxpayers of
Stanton! University, have found
out j11sI why the campus golf
course w;is built., it seems only
proper that we should apologize
for our past thoughtlessness in fre
quenting the M.A.C.'s exclusive
country club. We really didn't,
know, Mr. Masters, that when all
the agitation was going on for a
campus golf course that the Lords
of Stanford Sport $ were merely
looking for a new way to make
money. Honest, Mr. Masters, we
thought that the eourse was being
built for us from the proceeds of
football games so that when w<
needed a little refreshing we could
shoot a round of golf.
But we see now that we were
mistaken, and we humbly beg your
pardon for making ourselves ob
noxious on your fairways. We do
hope you will accept our apology,
especially since because of our im
prudence you have been forced to

i perform (lie unpleasant task of
publicly announcing that the Stan
ford student body is the undesired
element of the course membership.
Hut we realize our mistake now.
We are sorry that we have mis
handled our membership cards,
Mr. Masters. I-Jut you know, Mr.
Masters, we are a very large group
and such abuses do creep in now
and then. We were trusting that
; the Hoard of Athletic Control would
have enough foresight and ability
to guard against Hiings like that,
because they certainly can watch
the morals of their looUball tickets.
But again we were mistaken. It
just seems that we will never
learn to understand and appreciate
the work of the B.A.C.
Hut in closing" we again plead
ihat you forgive us for our giddi
ness. I'm sure we won't let il hap
pen again, especially this spring
quarter.
Faithfully yours,
