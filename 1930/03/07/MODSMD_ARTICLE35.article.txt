# THE 						HIGH PRICE OF OMELETS

The Editor, Sir:
In regard to tlve recent Encina
egg-throwing festival in which the
sponsorial dignity was supposedly
infringed, it seems that the pen
ally dealt out of ISO hours or
of labor to the three guilty ones

i without thought of the financial or
scholastic situation of the culprits,
was entirely too harsh. Such an ex
treme sentence would not have
been given if the eggs were thrown
at someone else instead of the high
and mighty sponsors.
