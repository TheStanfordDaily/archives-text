A recent study of 1,000 Stanford
alumni and undergraduates showed
that investment banking and adver
tising stood high among business
vocations both in the interest and
participation of' Stanford men. A
brief survey of the vocational pos
sibilities of each of these occupa
tions follows:
Investment Banker
The investment banker is more
than a mere salesman of stocks
and bonds. He provides capital for
business expansion and helps to de
velop sound business enterprise.
Only secondarily is he a salesman
of securities to individuals and in
stitutions.
However, a college man entering
this vocation will doubtless start
as a salesman, for such experience
is esential training, regardless of
what other background he may
have. Mortality in these early years
is high, only 20 to 25 per cent sur
viving the first five years. Some of
those who drop out enter allied
vocations such as banking and in
surance.
Average salary for the beginner
is from $1200 to $1800. At the end
of the five-year period salaries
average $4000 or better for those
who survive (1927). At the 30- to
15-year levels salaries are often
found ranging from $8,000 to
$15,000.
Training should include not only
strong emphasis upon business and
economic subjects, but should
cover many cultural studies, for a
wide range of knowledge and cul
ture is essential in making contacts.
Some test of one's interest and
ability may be had by acting as
"runner" for a, banking house dur
ing summer vacations.
Essential personal qualifications
for an investment banker have
been given as:
1. A personality that attracts
people and a desire to work with
people.
2. An intelligent interest iu
financial matters.
The capacity for hard and
persistent work.
4. Scrupulous honesty.
Advertiser
Three main branches of adver
tising are: (1) the advertising
agency, (2) advertising depart
ments of manufacturing, mail or
der, and retail houses, and (3)
space selling for magazines and
newspapers.
Work in the advertising agency
is most, specialized. There a. man
may he a copywriter, a salesman,
a research man, a printing and cu

[ graving man, etc. The advertising
manager for a manufacturing or
selling concern must be familiar
with and proficient in nearly all
; of the above functions. He must be
able to write copy, to know when
it is well-executed, and to plan a
program over a long period. In the
third type of work salesmanship is 1
most pronounced.
In all branches training should
certainly include background and
; fundamental courses such as are
I found in the economics depart-!
ment, followed by special work in j
advertising. In this department ex
cellent training may be had in the
J colleges of commerce at the Uni
! versity of California and the Uni
versity of Southern California. Ex
j perience and aptitude gained in <â– 
college in writing, managing, and I
i selling provide a good background.
Requirements for the vocation
include the ability to write, to
create, the ability to sell and to
make contacts with people, and
ability to work under a strain amid
I severe competition.
Salaries start low, copy writer,
technical man, or salesman earning
, only $25 to $30 a week at the start.
The salary limit depends very de
cidedly on the man, ranging from
$5,000 for the average good man up
to $100,000 for the exceptional.
