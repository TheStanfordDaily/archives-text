# QUARTET OFFERS RUSSIAN SONGS
## Years of Practice Achieve Perfect Harmony 
### Ruth Miner 
With years of practice toward
achieving their sole aim, that of
the perfection of a group of trained
singers with a unity of interpreta
tion, the Kedroff Quartet, expon
ents of Russian church and folk
music, will appear in the Stanford
Pavilion Monday night at 8:15
o'clock.
Three Russian groups of four
numbers each will be given on the
program Monday â€” one of com
posers, one of folk-songs, and one
of art songs. The fourth group will
include numbers by non-Russian
composers, Kucken, Zeller, and J.
Strauss. "What's Fit for a Youth?"
poem bv Tolstoi, set to music by
Tcherenpnin, and"The Song of the
Hindu Merchant," from Rimsky
Korsakov's opera, "Sadko," are
among the selections for the first
group, those by Russian com
posers.
"When a Stanford University
audience, ever restless and blase,
remains seated to demand more
than one encore at the end of a
program, the entertainers may feel
that the highest possible tribute
has been paid to them," said the
Palo Alto Times review of the
Kedroff concert last March, when
the quartet appeared here under
the auspices of the Committee on
Public Exercises.
"What the Flonzaley Quartet has
done for chamber music, and with
stringed instruments, the Kedroff
gentlemen have accomplished with
the human voice" is the character
ization from the New York Tele
graph. "At times, the most minute
observation, right at the stage,
could not disclose which voice be
longed to any of the singers. The
result is a blending of the tones, a
set of nuances which is beyond
comparison."
Seats are still available at the
A.S.S.U. office in the Old Union
and at. Dodson's in Palo Alto for
$1, $1.50, and $2.
