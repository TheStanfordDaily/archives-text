# FEUD FLAMES ANEW Old-Timers Will Play Ball "WANT TO GET EVEN"
## 
### 
An old feud, after having lain dor
j mailt for several years, has broken
i out again.
i The class c.ii '99 has challenged the
| combined classes of '97, '98, and '00 to
ja game of baseball at 9:30, the mcirn
j ing of University Day, April 19. ( "We
j want to get even with those classes
J before we die," said a representative
of '99.
Through some "monkey business"
in official circles (John E. McDowell
serves as secretary for both '99 and
'00) the classes of '98 and '00 ac
cepted the challenge before it was
formally issued. The class of '97 was
not far behind, so the conflict seems
inevitable.
All members of '99. who arc on the
1 campus, arc to play during the game,
and the competition for the position
of shortshop is keen. The other
classes are permitted the same privi
lege, only not more than nine men
may play at any one time.
The game is to be played on the
sunken baseball field, and the dia
mond will be reduced from regulation
size. A soft ball will lie used. Ar
rangements are being made for seat
ing the spectators (and substitute
players) who are expected.
