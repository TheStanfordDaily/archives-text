HALLELUJAH
Mr. Robert L. Templeton
and his crew of cinder cham
pions are doomed to go down
to an ignoble defeat tomorrow
afternoon!
None other than Dapper
Charlie Hunter, collector of
antique ex-collegians and
promising prep school track
performers, has boldly an
nounced this gloomy oracle.
In fact, Mr. Hunter has nonchal
antly predicted that his old-time
wearers o| the Winged "()" are go
ing to trounce the Cardinal stalwarts
by a score of 77 to 54. At least, he
allowed the press to quote him as
such the other day.
Not that Dapper Charlie is
trying to kid the public into
believing that he is a brave
man. For very few, if any,
martyrs in the history of oval
battles have boasted as strong
a following to back up their
revelations.
et, this is not the first time Dap
per Charlie has turned prophet. He
has invaded the Farm for the past
several years with verbal vocifera
tions of how his Post Street patri
archs would romp away from the
â€¢ animal boys.
Unless our memory fails us.
Dapper Charlie proved to be
a sham seer on more than one
occasion!
I lowever, it doesn't take a prescient
mind to see that said prophet is not
shooting off his mouth on far-fetched
chances of victory ibis spring.
Any sane and rational man
couldn't help but shout hal
lelujah, etc., after glancing
over his Olympian flock. And
it is no wonder that Mr. Rob
ert L. Templeton has failed to
retaliate with reams of op
timistic babble.
Last Saturday the local speedsters
nosed out the L.A.A.( . by a bare two
yards to spare. The Olympic Club
has a better balanced outfit than the
graybearded clan from Troy, and is
exceptionally strong in those events
which loom up most anaemic in the
harm lineup.
\mong the most outstanding per
formers for the Winged () are Russ
Sweet, who clipped off a 9:2 cen
tury dash last season; I 'ill Sforie, for
,incr Card quarter miler; Larl Fuller,
Olympic Games two lap runner; Har
ry farter. ex-Bear star miler; Ward
Ldnionds, pole vaulting and hurdling
ace; and . . . well, why mention them
all.
This handful of athletes alone is
enough to make any competitor shiver
and offers an excellent excuse for the
tuition payers ot good old Stanford
I', to shudder when they think of Mr.
Robert L. I empleton's chances to
morrow.
At any rate, the relay is
quite likely to decide the win
ner, provided that a few of the
old timers are slightly out of
condition. If so, the Cardinal
four-lap men will have to get
off their lards and Long John
Morrison can not afford to get
some shut-eye on the home
stretch. For Dapper Charlie
says his relay quartet is good
for 3 minutes and 22 seconds
at least. Which is 6 seconds
faster than Long John and his
cohorts turned in last week
end.
