Coach Hill Ellington will be able
to send his frosh into 1 his meet
with a certain amount of assurance
as 1 <> their capabilities. The meet
last week demonstrated that, he can
now count on points in practically
the two-mile and the javelin. In
every event, with the exception of
the long grind his men are as yet
untried and in the latter event no
man has presented himself who
has had any previous experience in
the art of spear-tossing.
Ellington lias four pretty fair
sprinters in Twelvetmes, Fowler,
Ward, and Gillette. With Eastman,
Fullenwider, Naylon, and Hunter
running as they did last Saturday
against the All-Stars, he has noth

races, Herbert lias been running
the hurdles in good style, and so
(lift track events appear to be well
taken care of.
A weakness in'(lie field-was re

pective broad-jumpers were un
covered. J'.ill Willard surprised to
leap better than 21 i'eet, and Don
Uhukman and Jack: Twelvetrees
were close to that mark.
Sam ('lark is the lone vault,er but

trio composed of Hlackman, dyne,
and Lewis, who are clearing
heights from 5 feet <i inches up to

Laborde and Gray in the weights
means a certain It! points.
After the meet tomorrow the
