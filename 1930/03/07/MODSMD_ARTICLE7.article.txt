# FLIER LOCATES WRECKAGE OF LOST AIR LINER
## W.A.E. Transport Sighted In Isolated Canyon Near Lake Arrowhead Pilot and Companion See Bodies of Passengers 
### 
LOS ANGELES, March 6. (/P) —
Strewn wreckage of a Western Air
Express tri-niotored transport,
which disappeared twelve days ago
with its crew of three in the snow
hound San Bernardino mountains
was found late today in an iso
lated canyon by Dudley Steele, one
of a group of airplane pilots search
ing for the lost ship.
Steele, head of the aviation de
partment of the Richfield Oil Com
pany, flying with Miss Juanita
Burns of Los Angeles as an ob
server, sighted the wreckage in a
canyon iive miles northwest of
Coxey's ranch and about twenty
miles from Lake Arrowhead on the
eastern slope of the mountains.
As his open cockpit plane sped
over the mountain peaks, a dab of
brilliant red on the ground caught
his eye. He circled the precipitous
peaks and as he approached the
spot again both he and Miss Burns
saw the wreckage.
Miss Burns said she saw the
block letters "W A E" on a wing
which had been wrenched from the
fuselage. The wing was caught on
one of the canyon sides. Deep down
in the ravine, she saw the fuse
lage, all of it burned except about
four feet of the tail group.
In a third dive over the canyon,
Steele and Miss Burns saw some
bodies caught in the heavy brush.
They were unable to cut the speed
of their ship sufficiently to count
the number but Miss Burns said
there were at least two bodies
inert.
