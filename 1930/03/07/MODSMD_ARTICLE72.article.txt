track team when Charley Hunt
brings his Winged "O" aggreguiit
of stars to the Stadium tomorh)
afternoon, for few critics have i; r
the nerve to pick the Cards to i
It w ill ho the nat ional A.A 1
champions against the I.e. 1 !

who contributed some of the Ca^ 1
points in tin* 1.C.4-A. meet, will I

Dyer twice in the 100, has yet
heat the lanky Card in the I'urhAi
Dyer took Sweet in the dual n>-
with the club last year in the
and repeated in the P.A.A. me.
later in the year. Sweet won il

Sweat vs. Dyer
Dyer, however, with another vf-rt
of experience back of him, slion
win both sprints if he is able i
get a fair start. Sweet lias not V>
competed in a. meet this sea si >
while Dyer ran the sprints in ey
times on a wet Stadium track la-
Saturday. It is unlikely that mo
rison will run the L'2o 1 his lifti
as he will have his hands full y
ing to win the relay for the
nal. GJberson and llowell will ha\

itzen of the club. t *
Despite the fact that Raster, o,
the club has been credited avit
faster times than Smith, the lait<
is favored in the high hurdles 'in
cause of better condition. W't r
Edmonds beat Smith last year (
the lows, but Smith has improve 1
, so rapidly that he should win. r?<-
I son and Nisbet are the oti.er Card ■

If either Carter or Baker

fering from a bad cold which am I
handicap him in the meet. In.

Fuller Runs 880

In the event of warm fvealfc. ,
Morrison will have to In a( ;,u j[! 1

Hubbard of the club in the ?i<>.
Hubbard has already done r,n |] ; >i ,
this year, and <has been busy Ir|i.i
ing for the meet for a long t iin-■.
Shove should take third, and mit lit '
surprise with a second. Ike Ha!»l< o
is just beginning to round jjito
form and may be expected to l"
battling it out with the leader.* '
Bob Brown will be up

runners as Fraser, I looper, Char). .
and Hose entered for the Winf< I
j "O." Fraser ran a !):. r >7 eight !*i «■
, last Sunday .it Kezar in a tjiiiv
trial, which is better than Brow i,
has done so far. Charles is li-jn
ing hard and will be remembetv 1°
as a Stanford two-miler of a
seasons past. Hooper is a five-mi j" .
so.he is unlikely to notice a triu
two miles.
Hot Relay Scheduled < k
Hunter is saving Bill Storie
the relay, evidently with the iut-i
tion of insuring a win in that ev-'n
Storie would be a cinch to takf
point at least in the 440. bill ,li
may mean five points in Hie rein
running against, men who hav> VfJ
ready had stiff competition in fli
quarter. Storie was one of the Jur;,
stars in the best relay team tli
Stanford has ever had. and is'.il
ways at his best, in tough si ' i
Fuller, Hubbard, and Tatuni niak. .
u)) Ihe balance of the club r- I.
team, and all are capable of 51 1(1 i
or better i?i 440. Fuller is sl7t r
to run the anchor lap against
rison, and if he is able to R<«t aw
with a lead, Morrison will have l \
work cut out for him. '
With a decided advantage in/I .
field events, the club will have i
better than even chance to w
the meet if its athletes are in hi
shape at all. However, past rec<*r»
show that club teams, especially i
the early season, are seldom in on
dition. and any breaks or the nfei
should co to the rollerian . .X-
