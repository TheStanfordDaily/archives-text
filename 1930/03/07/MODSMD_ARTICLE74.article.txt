## Tennis Successes of Hunter Attributed by Anderson to Smashing Forehand Drive 
### Feg Murry, '16 
Eight years ago a 28-year-old
- stalwart bv name of Francis T.
I *
i Hunter won the C.S. national in
| door tennis championship, dei'eat
j iug Prank T. Anderson, the defend
; ing tit leholder. An account of the
j tournament says, "Hunter un
covered many times a terrific fore
j hand drive that Anderson was un
! able to cope with." Now in 1930,
j this same Prank T. Anderson, writ
-1 ing about this same Francis T. Hun
ter. on the occasion of Hunter's
winning his second national indoor
singles title, finds Hunter's victory
due mainly to his bombarding rip
snorting forehand drive.
It seems that the Mighty Hunter
of New Rochelle has kept that
booming forehand in operation and
has won many matches with it
here and abroad. Hunter may be
; equipped with a limited assortment
'of strokes, he may be a fading
veteran who has seen his best days,

| but no one can deny that he lvas
gone a long way on the road to
tennis success with that, one wea
pon of his, his bludgeon called
"Forehand Drive," ably assisted by
185 pounds of bone and muscle, un
limited confidence, a stout heart,
and a courageous and serious de
sire to conquer.
Would the United States have
retrieved the Davis Cup in Paris
last July had Hunter been chosen
to play in the singles instead of
George Lott? 1 think so, as Â«h>
i many others. Hunter had played
well against Germany the week
before, and could certainly have
done as well as Lott did against
; the French.
