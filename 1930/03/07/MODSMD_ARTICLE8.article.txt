# PAVILION CHANGED INTO GREAT CASTLE FOR MILITARY BALL
## 
### 
In an atmosphere of a medieval
castle ballroom, with the knights
of-old scheme prevailing through
out the Pavilion even to the extent
of including the dance programs,
the first notes of the orchestra will
open the Military Ball given by
Scabbard and Blade, at 9 o'clock
tonight.
Elaborate tapestries will adorn
the walls to add to the transforma
tion, while soft colored lighting
will complete the effect of the last
all-campus dance of the quarter.
Programs will be of black suede
leather, with a knight in armor em
bossed in silver on the cover. On
the shield he carries is the insignia
of Scabbard and Made in gold.
Refreshments will rival the
feasts of the old warriors of the
middle ages, according to Marron
Kendrick, general dance chairman.
