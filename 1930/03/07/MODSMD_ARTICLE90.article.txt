# MEN'S REST HOME FUNCTIONS AS STUDENT INFIRMARY ON UNIVERSITY CAMPUS
## 
### BY STEWART CRAWFORD 
| Along 1 lie row of homes on Al-
I varado Street is one that looks no
different from the others, hut is doing
j a great service to the university, and
I is known to comparatively few stu
j dents on the campus. It is the Stan
i forfl ,Men's Rest Home.
Here one may iind students who
j are tired out from the bustle of col
lege life, bothered with illness not
severe enough to require hospital
care, or convalescing after an opera
tion. Mrs. Morrison, who donated her
home for this purpose, cares for the
patients, and makes them feel that
they are in a real home, so different
from life in a college dormitory or
fraternity house.
The Men's Rest Home is the re
sult ol a movement of the Stanford
Mother's Club, who established it two
years ago as an experiment to demon
strate to Stanford the need of an in
| tirmarv 011 the campus. At that time
| the university could not afford to
I build such an institution, so a group
of six Stanford mothers decided to
finance the movement. When Mrs.
Nellie Morrison offered her hgmc and
her time to the cause, the movement
was under way.
j

Today the home is well established,
and all who have been there are en
thusiastic about its value, though per
haps comparatively few students know
what it is really accomplishing. The
I niversitv has recognized its impor
tance, and the Student Guild makes
the same arrangement for paying the
expenses of students in the home, as
they do in student hospital cases. The
Mother's Cltth has established a fund
which provides for those who are not
able to pay their expenses.
It has come to be the general opin
ion among students that there is too
1 much red tape involved in gaining en
trance to the home, according to Mrs.
Edwin J. Thomas, chairman of the
Rest Home Committee. This is not
| the case, however; in fact the pro
cedure for gaining admittance is very
simple. One has only to call Dr. Tor
res' of the University health service,
j or it not able to reach him, may call
Mrs. Morrison at 536 Alvarado, and
' she will decide whether or not he is
really too sick to stay there.

| Along 1 lie row of homes on Al-
I varado Street is one that looks no
different from the others, hut is doing
j a great service to the university, and
I is known to comparatively few stu
j dents on the campus. It is the Stan
i forfl ,Men's Rest Home.
Here one may iind students who
j are tired out from the bustle of col
lege life, bothered with illness not
severe enough to require hospital
care, or convalescing after an opera
tion. Mrs. Morrison, who donated her
home for this purpose, cares for the
patients, and makes them feel that
they are in a real home, so different
from life in a college dormitory or
fraternity house.
The Men's Rest Home is the re
sult ol a movement of the Stanford
Mother's Club, who established it two
years ago as an experiment to demon
strate to Stanford the need of an in
| tirmarv 011 the campus. At that time
| the university could not afford to
I build such an institution, so a group
of six Stanford mothers decided to
finance the movement. When Mrs.
Nellie Morrison offered her hgmc and
her time to the cause, the movement
was under way.
j

Today the home is well established,
and all who have been there are en
thusiastic about its value, though per
haps comparatively few students know
what it is really accomplishing. The
I niversitv has recognized its impor
tance, and the Student Guild makes
the same arrangement for paying the
expenses of students in the home, as
they do in student hospital cases. The
Mother's Cltth has established a fund
which provides for those who are not
able to pay their expenses.
It has come to be the general opin
ion among students that there is too
1 much red tape involved in gaining en
trance to the home, according to Mrs.
Edwin J. Thomas, chairman of the
Rest Home Committee. This is not
| the case, however; in fact the pro
cedure for gaining admittance is very
simple. One has only to call Dr. Tor
res' of the University health service,
j or it not able to reach him, may call
Mrs. Morrison at 536 Alvarado, and
' she will decide whether or not he is
really too sick to stay there.
