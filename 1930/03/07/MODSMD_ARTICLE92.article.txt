# COMMUNITY BETTER THAN CLASSROOM ACTION IN HONOR CODE, SAYS ROBINSON
## 
### RAWSON HOLMES 
This is the seventh oj a series of opinions on the proposed amendment to
i the Honor Code which will establish a system of optional proctors, l<\ these
! men who ore best able to comprehend the situation, namely professors who
' have large classes.

j Community action rather than class
] room action is the better line of ap
proach to the Honor Question, in the
opinion of Edgar Eugene Robinson,
professor of American history and di
| rector of citizenship, as outlined to a
| Daily reporter recently.
"You ask my opinion on the Honor
! System," said Professor Robinson.
| "Of coursc I believe in 'honor' among
the students. 1 believe in their hon
! csty, fairness, sense of justice, and
i their clear-headedness, even in their
! attitude toward the cheater, the liar,
and the cynic.
"On the whole, the attitude of mind
| is wholesome," he continued. "There
! is some low living hereabouts, not in
! the major moralities, perhaps, but in
j the lesser things that make life often
I seem mean and not worth while. But
[ the sum total of what we term the
| civilized attitude is very evident on
this campus.
"Since the establishment of the citi
zenship department in 1923, 3,100 stu
dents have taken the course. Out of
that number less than half a dozen
cases of cheating have been brought
to my attention. Perhaps, if there is
an increase of this dishonesty in the
later college years something is wrong
with the community.
"I have been told ot the student
who, when caught stealing examina
tion papers out of the instructor's of
fice the night before the examination,
said : 'Why that isn't included in the
Honor System!' Such a point of
view calls for community action, not
classroom action."
Professor Robinson then pointed out
that there were two aspects to the sit

uation; first, the problem of classroom
conduct, and second, the problem of
community laxness. "When the second
is solved the lirst will disappear," he
declared. "Yet we talk almost en
tirely of the first.
"As to the 'system'," Professor
Robinson concluded, "1 am not so sure.
As an occasional device, perhaps, but
always in the back ground. The best
comment on a system would be its
observance. We want no student po
lice. Let honor be taken for granted
in all things, in the classroom, in the
library, on the field, and in social rela
tionships."

Professor Robinson then pointed out
that there were two aspects to the sit

conduct, and second, the problem of
community laxness. "When the second
is solved the lirst will disappear," he
declared. "Yet we talk almost en
tirely of the first.
"As to the 'system'," Professor
Robinson concluded, "1 am not so sure.
As an occasional device, perhaps, but
always in the back ground. The best
comment on a system would be its
observance. We want no student po
lice. Let honor be taken for granted
in all things, in the classroom, in the
library, on the field, and in social rela

"Since the establishment of the citi
zenship department in 1923, 3,100 stu

that number less than half a dozen

an increase of this dishonesty in the
later college years something is wrong
with the community.
