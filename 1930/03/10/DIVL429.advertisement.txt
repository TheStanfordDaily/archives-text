Harnessing Niagara Falls
to the washing machine
Cheaper power! Groping after this modern
touchstone to wealth, deluded inventors slaved
over perpetual motion machines ... informed
inventors evolved the turbine.. .broad visioncd
men harnessed the rush of waters ... engineers
raised pressures and temperatures to produce
more power without corresponding increases
of cost.
While, step by step, this progress has taken
place, the many men who have contributed to
it could not know what far-reaching results it
would have. Now the ultimate boons grow
clear. Water power development becomes a
national policy, steam bids fair to rival water
power for cheapness, economically produced
power brings more plentiful goods, lights houses
and hauls crowds in cities, is carried to rural
sections to lift washday drudgery from farm
women's shoulders.
Among the many industrial victories that arc
behind this revolution, none is more important
than wider knowledge of piping materials and
better materials. One of the highly prized
chapters of our history is the contribution that
Crane research and valve engineering has made
to the general advance. The results of this
research are embodied in a Crane book, Pioneer
ing in Science. It is a fascinating story of engi
neering development and a valuable reference
work for engineering students. A request will
