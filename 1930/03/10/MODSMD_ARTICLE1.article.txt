# BALL TEAM IN 5-4 WIN FROM MOHAN NINE
## Johnny Hunken Saves Day For Cards With Flashy Back-to-the-Wall Catch Loom is Turns m Good Job Of Pitching; St. Mary's Score Runs on Errors 
### Howard Moore 
Timely hitting and two costly
Car-1 errors enabled Stanford's
baseball varsity to nose out the St.
Mary's nine here Saturday after
noon by a score of 5-4. Loomis
proved effective throughout most
el the game, and practically all of
the Moragans' tallies came on Card
errors.
The Redshirts grabbed off an
early lead in the first frame when
Goodell walked and scored on Uin
ta la's fluke double to left. The
Moraga nine knotted the count with
a marker in the third canto when
Hamilton singled and came all the
way around on two errors and a
passed ball.
St. Mary's shoved over another
in the next inning by a walk, a
passed ball, and an error; and the
Cards regained the lead at. I! to 2
in their half of the fourth on two
successive hits by Hunken and
Hardy, followed by an error and
Kelly's double to left field.
The Saints tied tilings up for a
second time in the fifth, scoring
once on Neely's infield hit and
Seghetti's triple to deep center, but
Wolter's men went ahead again in
their section of the inning when
Kintala walked, took second on a
sacrifice, and scored on Seghetti's
error.
Churchill was given a free ticket
10 start the eighth and was brought
around on Johnson's infield hit and
a passed ball. The Gaels staged a
belated ninth-inning rally pushing
over one count on Valim's single
and Goodell's bauble. Seghetti had
the fans gasping when with one
man on the bags, he poled out a
terrific fly to left field which Hun
ken barely caught backed up
against the fence.

Timely hitting and two costly
Car-1 errors enabled Stanford's
baseball varsity to nose out the St.
Mary's nine here Saturday after
noon by a score of 5-4. Loomis
proved effective throughout most
el the game, and practically all of
the Moragans' tallies came on Card
errors.
The Redshirts grabbed off an
early lead in the first frame when
Goodell walked and scored on Uin
ta la's fluke double to left. The
Moraga nine knotted the count with
a marker in the third canto when
Hamilton singled and came all the
way around on two errors and a
passed ball.
St. Mary's shoved over another
in the next inning by a walk, a
passed ball, and an error; and the
Cards regained the lead at. I! to 2
in their half of the fourth on two
successive hits by Hunken and
Hardy, followed by an error and
Kelly's double to left field.
The Saints tied tilings up for a
second time in the fifth, scoring
once on Neely's infield hit and
Seghetti's triple to deep center, but
Wolter's men went ahead again in
their section of the inning when
Kintala walked, took second on a
sacrifice, and scored on Seghetti's
error.
Churchill was given a free ticket
10 start the eighth and was brought
around on Johnson's infield hit and
a passed ball. The Gaels staged a
belated ninth-inning rally pushing
over one count on Valim's single
and Goodell's bauble. Seghetti had
the fans gasping when with one
man on the bags, he poled out a
terrific fly to left field which Hun
ken barely caught backed up
against the fence.
