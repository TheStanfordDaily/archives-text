"I shall keep on playing tennis
for years and years," said Helen
Wills Moody with a pleasant smile
on the subject of the possible con
flict between marriage and tennis.
"I shall always keep up my interest
in tlie game," continued the world's
champion woman player in an in
terview last Friday afternoon be
fore she entered the match which
opened her 19.10 tenuis season.
"1 hope very much 1o play in the
European tournaments this year
but as yet I have no definite plans,"
she went on sincerely. "If I play
at Wimbledon and in France this
summer, 1 will play in the Ameri
can championship. However I don't
want to have so long a season as
I did last year. Five months is too
long.
"The Eastern tournaments?"
Well, I have to go East for a week
in the latter part of April as there
is going to be an exhibition of my
sketches in the Grand Central Gal
leries. I'm not sure whether I'm
going East for tennis; in fact, I
haven't made up my mind."

The California girl's blue eyes j
smiled when she was asked about
Stanford. "Of course, I don't know
Stanford very well," she admitted, !
"but to me it is tl)p ideal place for
sports. It should be the sporting;
University. The splendid climate 1
lends itself wonderfully to ath- !
letics. I don't see why every single j
woman student shouldn't take up
one sport which she likes.
"Oh yes, I approve moat heartily j
of athletics for women, and the j
movement is growing over the i
world. I believe people should do
what they want, to most, but do
think the American college girl :
could do lots more in athletics. All '
of them could have a little tennis,
a little golf, or swimming. A smat- j
terlng of each kind of sport gives
pleasant recreation for week-ends."
The girl who has been called '
America's tennis queen and Who
now answers to "Mrs. Moody" as
the court plays are called, believes
in the value of extra-curricular ac
tivities. "There are lots of things

in college besides learning," she
said. "AH the things you do, you
can carry on after college. Dra
matics, journalistic activities, and
the executive positions give you
an interest in and make you feel a
part of college which is lacking it'

Perhaps the nicest tribute to the
tennis star's personality, during the
few hours she was here, were the
crowds of lint l children who liter
ally mobbed her as she was leaving
the courts last* Friday. These chil
dren were armed with old tennis
balls, notebooks, and pieces of
paper "for Helen" to sign. They
clamored and surged about her as
the crowd was leaving the stands.
