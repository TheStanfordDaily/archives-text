lii discussing Stanford's attempt to raise several million dollars
lor the purpose of carrying on a program of improvement in the
School of Medicine, the Sun l'runcisco Chronicle calls attention to
a situation which has long been a handicap lo the University's
progress.
"Stanford suffers under a false legend of great wealth," says
the Chruiiiclc. "Dazzled by the original Stanford gift, the world
has ever since assumed that the university rolls in money. The truth
is that Stanford University is very poor. The original gift was a
large one for its time, but it is practically all Stanford has ever had,
and the funds left after the plant was provided are inadequate for
the needs of a present-day large university. Stanford is seriously
cramped for lack of money."
The Chronicle' is speaking particularly to the outside world, of
course, and not to those immediately connected with the University.
But the message is one which those of the Farm itself will do well
to hear.
For the outside world is not alone in sulTering under the halluci
nation of Stanford's opulence. Stanford men and women them
selves, having heard vaguely of the original fortune, subscribe to
the popular theory that the University is a veritable Scrooge when
it assesses its various and sundry fees, charges, and lines upon the
embattled student body.
'I his "-Mjakc Checks Payable to Stanford University" business is
tough, but there is no other way out.
