# THIS BUSINESS OF GRADES
## 
### 
Three weeks from today the majority of Stanford students, who
apple-polish, phi bete, or browbeat their instructors into awarding
them with passing grades, will again be back ou the Farm after a
week's vacation.
During this period of leisure, the more serious-minded will try
to select their spring quarter coursesâ€”the others won't make defi
nite plans until they have been attending this and that class for some
days after registration.
A comprehensive analysis of students attending this institution
would probably show that the courses they register for, in the end,
arc those in which they are the most proficient.
The present system of grading now causes a student to further
proceed into interests he has mastered. It does not encourage the
seeker of learning to probe into the dark, and sometimes difficult,
unknown. A perfect system would attempt to evade this condition.
