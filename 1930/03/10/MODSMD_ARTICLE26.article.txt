# THE 						EDUCATED CLASS IN GOVERNMENT
## 
### 
Last week Allen Fox, potent New York Republican party
worker, made a serious charge against the educational system of
American universities. 1 le claimed that the educated class in Amer
ica is more responsible for bad government than is any other group. |
< >n the same radio program, Marion Dickcrman, New York expo- !
nent of Democratic principles, stated that America's greatest politi- !
eal menace "is the successful business man who thinks himself !
above politics and then attempts to pull political strings behind the
scenes.''
In England the educated classes govern, not in order to make a j
living, but for the honor of being in the governmental service. !
I pper class Englishmen have achieved such material success as j
they consider sufficient and have devoted themselves to the social 1
and political problems of the nation. On this side of the Atlantic {
there seems to be no conception of duty to the state after one has !
acquired a competence. A son now sets out to pile the dollars higher !
than his father had succeeded in doing, rather than setting out to j
make for himself a place of honor in the public service.
A collegiate debate on political issues causes not a ripple on the
complacent bosom of American public opinion, while last week the
maiden speecli of Rudolph Churchill, son of the famous Winston j
Churchill, in the Oxford Union echoed up and down the Island.
Perhaps the explanation lies in the fact that developing America |
felt more keenly the need of building the material foundation for j
upper class government and, of course, the necessity for govern- J
incut is not great in a pioneering, agricultural nation. With the |
country assuming international responsibilities, with a great indtis- ;
trial population rapidly growing, and with the huge increase i?i the j
number of financially independent citizens, it is certain that the
time has arrived when more attention must be directed toward the !
organization and control of American society.
Princeton has taken another step toward the realization of the [
Wilsonian dream of a university wherein the "air of affairs should j
be admitted to all of its classrooms." Its new School of Public and
International Affairs has already a building and a faculty. Last
week the National Alumni Association began a campaign to raise a
$J,000,000 endowment foV the new department.
Perhaps other American educators tvill soon emerge from their
academic shells, and in addition to teaching students how to get on
well with themselves, will give some instruction in the necessary art
of getting on with their fellows.
Stull meeting today at 1 tl? o clock.

A collegiate debate on political issues causes not a ripple on the
complacent bosom of American public opinion, while last week the
maiden speecli of Rudolph Churchill, son of the famous Winston j
Churchill, in the Oxford Union echoed up and down the Island.
Perhaps the explanation lies in the fact that developing America |
felt more keenly the need of building the material foundation for j
upper class government and, of course, the necessity for govern- J
incut is not great in a pioneering, agricultural nation. With the |
country assuming international responsibilities, with a great indtis- ;
trial population rapidly growing, and with the huge increase i?i the j
number of financially independent citizens, it is certain that the
time has arrived when more attention must be directed toward the !
organization and control of American society.
Princeton has taken another step toward the realization of the [
Wilsonian dream of a university wherein the "air of affairs should j
be admitted to all of its classrooms." Its new School of Public and
International Affairs has already a building and a faculty. Last
week the National Alumni Association began a campaign to raise a
$J,000,000 endowment foV the new department.
Perhaps other American educators tvill soon emerge from their
academic shells, and in addition to teaching students how to get on
well with themselves, will give some instruction in the necessary art
of getting on with their fellows.
Stull meeting today at 1 tl? o clock.
Last week Allen Fox, potent New York Republican party
worker, made a serious charge against the educational system of
American universities. 1 le claimed that the educated class in Amer
ica is more responsible for bad government than is any other group. |
< >n the same radio program, Marion Dickcrman, New York expo- !
nent of Democratic principles, stated that America's greatest politi- !
eal menace "is the successful business man who thinks himself !
above politics and then attempts to pull political strings behind the
scenes.''
In England the educated classes govern, not in order to make a j
living, but for the honor of being in the governmental service. !
I pper class Englishmen have achieved such material success as j
they consider sufficient and have devoted themselves to the social 1
and political problems of the nation. On this side of the Atlantic {
there seems to be no conception of duty to the state after one has !
acquired a competence. A son now sets out to pile the dollars higher !
than his father had succeeded in doing, rather than setting out to j
make for himself a place of honor in the public service.
