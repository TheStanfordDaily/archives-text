THE GREAT MEADOW. By Eliza
beth Madox Roberts. New York,
The Viking Press. $2.50
The Great Meadow is a chronicle
of pioneer life in American history
at the time of the Revolution. The
narrative is simple. It. concerns
Diony Hall and Berk Jarvis, who
marry and leave Virginia, the home
| of their birth, to settle in the glam
orous "Kentuck." In these years
i Kentuck belonged to the Indians,
who would not see this fertile land
fall into the hands of the white
men without a bitter struggle, and
the young Diony and Berk are
forced to bear the brunt of this
hatred of the red men, because
they are among the earliest pio
neers to pierce a way into the
igreat meadbws of this western
wilderness.
But far more is included in this
novel than a mere account of an
unending warfare with Indians,
united with an equally hard fight
against the terrific hardships of
breaking a way across an untrav
eled country, and establishing a
home in an obscure, remote, and
treacherous land. All of this is
only the framework, a splendid and
engrossing theme, on which the
author builds a. beautiful structure
of idealized human character and
human motives. The important
thing is first of all the revelation
of how noble and fine men and
women can be when the terrific
test of such an environment as
I confronts a pioneer, the pain, the
ceaseless work, the deprivation,
lays bare human nature in all its
aspects.
With this as its prime object, the
book is centered on Diony, who is
the ideal of all pioneer women —
far-sighted, strong, brave, and a
lover of the beauty and promise
of the soil. This Diony is a beauti
i fully delineated character. The
author shows how this woman, who
on the outside is one among all of
| the other pioneer women, like
them in their inarticulateness, in
their attention to the material and
physical things .of their life, is
nevertheless in her inner being
sensitive, idyllic, with an intense
and subtle response to life con
stantly rushing over her.
The idealism contained in this
character makes the hook an in
spiring one. It should be read
slowly, for it has a slow rich effect
that seems to pour over one very

quietly until one is imbued through
out his spirit with a sense of rev
erence for the heroism and crude
magnificence of the pioneers who
fought for Kentucky.
Elizabeth Madox Roberts is con
sidered one of America's superior
writers, and in her latest novel is
found abundant justification for
this claim. She is in no sense of
the word a popular author, for to
begin with her field is far too lim
ited: she writes about mountain
people, poor and unlettered, and
although she knows her subject
with piercing intimacy, neither this
knowledge, nor the lyrical prose
perfection with which she discloses
it will suffice to make it of vital
interest to the majority of the
leading public. Yet no one who
would claim to any real familiarity
with modern American literature
should neglect to read "The Great
Meadow"; from it a fair idea of
the value of the stream of con
sciousness style in writing may be
gleaned as Miss Roberts may be
conceded a true master at this far
too often abused style in the nov
els of today.
