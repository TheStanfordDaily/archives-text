# ANNIE CHRISTIE—At the New
## 
### 
Stanford Theatre.
"Veil, Ay bam; talk now!"
Eager audiences at the New
Stanford this week will look for
something like this when Greta
Garbo makes her first audible ap
pearance in the flickers. They will
he disappointed. Only at intervals
is lier accent noticeable, and she
plays the part of a Swedish person
anyway, so everything is just
dandy.
Her first talkie, "Anna Christie,"
is an excellent piece of screen
work besides ushering in her vocal
career. Shure, an' it's got a real ol'
Irish lover, who's lookin' for the
hand an' heart of ye! And the old
Swedish daddy, who shakes his fist
off in the general direction of some
water, and hisses: "l)af ol' dabil
sea!" But despite the dialect and
tinge of hokum, Metro's handling
of "Anna Christie" shows fine dis
crimination, superb photography,
and excellent, t-ound engineering.
Almost stealing the picture away
from Miss Garbo herself is Marie
Dressier, whose portrayal of the
sodden, wharf-woman is worth the
price of admission. All in all, a
good fifty-cent's worth. —J. T.
