## BEAUTY IN A DUNGEON 
### 
The Editor, Sir: i
My hostess invited me to go with j
her to the Dance Drama last eve
ning, and 1 am wondering if you
would allow nie space In the Daily
in which to thank the University
and the dance composition class
for the very delightful evening
which 1 enjoyed.
If "a thing of beauty is a joy i
forever" 1 shall have a sense of |
joy, at least, as long as the mem- j
ory of that entertainment shall i
last.
Having hever attended a Dance
Drama before, 1 was thrilled, de
lighted, and surprised. I had no
idea so much could be expressed
in the dance, and in such a won
derful and beautiful way. Had the
people of Palo Alto realized what
they were missing I am sure every
seat would have been taken.
We happened to have a flash
light and could study the program i
between the numbers, but people
all around us were lighting
matches in order to do so. 1 asked )
a student, who sat next to nie,
why tlje lights were not turned on 1
between the numbers. She said, i
"This whole program was worked
out in a dungeon and 1 guess they |
forgot the audience needs the lights ;

to see the program."
"IN A DUNGEON"? This morn-1
ing we took a ride about Palo Alto 1
and the Campus and I asked espe
cially to see the "dungeon." I saw
it. The less said about, it the bet
ter, 1 guess. They are going to '
have a new building soon, I under
stand.
To think that such a beautiful
Dance Drama could be worked out
in such a building is a surprise to
me. The dance composition class j
is to be complimented upon their j
splendid entertainment and accom- '
plishment. A marked improvement !
will be made, I am tiure, when they (
have a lit building and environ- ]
ment in which to do their work.
I should like to suggest to the !
class that next year, when they i
put on such a line entertainment, i
they ask a reasonable admission
price. Nowadays, people don't ap- j
preciate what they get for nothing,
as a rule.
1 am going back home tomorrow
and shall take with me many happy
memories of my visit here, and (
not the least of them will be the i
Dance Drama.
Thanking you again for the kind- j
liess shown me, 1 beg to remain,
Yours very truly,
—Mrs. F. E. Dibly

to see the program."
"IN A DUNGEON"? This morn-1
ing we took a ride about Palo Alto 1
and the Campus and I asked espe
cially to see the "dungeon." I saw
it. The less said about, it the bet
ter, 1 guess. They are going to '
have a new building soon, I under
stand.
To think that such a beautiful
Dance Drama could be worked out
in such a building is a surprise to
me. The dance composition class j
is to be complimented upon their j
splendid entertainment and accom- '
plishment. A marked improvement !
will be made, I am tiure, when they (
have a lit building and environ- ]
ment in which to do their work.
I should like to suggest to the !
class that next year, when they i
put on such a line entertainment, i
they ask a reasonable admission
price. Nowadays, people don't ap- j
preciate what they get for nothing,
as a rule.
1 am going back home tomorrow
and shall take with me many happy
memories of my visit here, and (
not the least of them will be the i
Dance Drama.
Thanking you again for the kind- j
liess shown me, 1 beg to remain,
Yours very truly,

The Editor, Sir: i
My hostess invited me to go with j
her to the Dance Drama last eve
ning, and 1 am wondering if you
would allow nie space In the Daily
in which to thank the University
and the dance composition class
for the very delightful evening
which 1 enjoyed.
If "a thing of beauty is a joy i
forever" 1 shall have a sense of |
joy, at least, as long as the mem- j
ory of that entertainment shall i
last.
Having hever attended a Dance
Drama before, 1 was thrilled, de
lighted, and surprised. I had no
idea so much could be expressed
in the dance, and in such a won
derful and beautiful way. Had the
people of Palo Alto realized what
they were missing I am sure every
seat would have been taken.
We happened to have a flash
light and could study the program i
between the numbers, but people
all around us were lighting
matches in order to do so. 1 asked )
a student, who sat next to nie,
why tlje lights were not turned on 1
between the numbers. She said, i
"This whole program was worked
out in a dungeon and 1 guess they |
forgot the audience needs the lights ;

to see the program."
