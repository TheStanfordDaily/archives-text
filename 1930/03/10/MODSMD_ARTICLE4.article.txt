# STANFORD BAND TO GIVE FIRST SPRING RECITAL ON SUNDAY
## 
### 
Stanford and Palo Alto residents j
will hear the Stanford Band in its
first spring concert under unusual
circumstances next Sunday after
noon when the full 104-piece band ,
will ptiy a varied program in the I
Oval directly in front of the Quad.
According to Director Ernest '
Whitney Martin, the players "will
be located in the lowest part of!
the grass section of the Oval, thus j
faking advantage of the ampithea- ;
tre effect and permitting people to
remain in their automobiles along [
the edge and enjoy the concert. The j
band has never given an outdoor -
concert before, so next. Sunday's j
program will be a decided novelty, j
Ranging all the way from "Danza 1
Yaqui," a native American dance '
of the warlike Yaqui tribe of Mex- j
ico, to "Valse Triste" by Sibelius, I
the program, which will start at j
2:30 o'clock, will offer considerable
variety. Many pieces never before i
presented at Stanford are on the
list, among them "El Condor Pasa,"
Inca Peruvian dance, and "Solinger
Schuetzen Marsch" by von Blon.
