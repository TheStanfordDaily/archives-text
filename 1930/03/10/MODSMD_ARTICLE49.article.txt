### Rawson Holmes Stewart Crawford 
Some of the strengths and weak
nesses of the late William Howard
Taft were sketched by Edgar Eu
gene Robinson, Professor of Amer
ican History and Director of Citi
zenship yesterday, following the
former president's sad passing.
"William Howard Taft came 1o
the presidency twenty-one years
ago, as was said at the time, better
prepared by public service than
most of his predecessors," Profes
sor Robinson stated, "tie was one
of the group of men called into the
national service by President Mc-
Kinley, among whom he and Elihu
Root were outstanding.
"His training was not the type
for the office of president, however,
as soon came to lie realized," the
professor continued. The president
must be an efficient administrator,
a national spokesman, and a party
leader. Taft was none of these.
"His party went to pieces in
Congress, and later in the country.
The questions underlying this
break were those now pressing
upon national attention, but which
were pushed aside by the years of
the War and its aftermath.
"Hilt all who knew him. even
slightly, felt the 'bigness' of the
man. It was not a matter of physi
cal size, although that had a part
in it. He was jovial: he was safe.
"At New Haven early in 1920 a
great public meeting was held in
memory of Theodore Roosevelt,
who had just passed away. Taft
was the speaker. He sketched the
career of Roosevelt down to .1908.
Then he said 'Of the years that
follow it is not for me to speak.'
"Modest, tactful (with one not
able exception), fair, seldom
aroused to tremendous effort, the
regard of the American people for
this gracious gentleman has in
creased steadily from his presi
dency to his recent death."

With the passing of William 1
Howard Taft, ex-president and for
years Chief Justice of the Supreme
Court, among those recalling the
accomplishments of the man who
did so much for the judicial prog
ress of this country is Arthur M. i
Cathcart, professor of law, who
gives the view of a fellow lawyer.
"I have a very high opinion of
Taft," lie said, "and it seems to
me that his strength has not been
fully appreciated. He was popular,
and his likable personality was ap- j
predated generally, but not every
one fully realized how important to
the judicial history of the United
States his decisions have been. 1
"In IS9S, as Circuit Judge, he
passed judgment on the United
States vs. Allystone Pipe Company
case, which is unquestionably the
ablest, most comprehensive deci- I
sion that has ever been rendered
by any judge on contracts and com
binations in restraint of trade. This
opinion was one of the very im
portant early judicial constructions
of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.
"One of Taft's outstanding char
acteristics as a jiidge was his judi
cial poise. He can't be classified
either as a conservative or as a i
radical progressive. For example,
lie stood with the minority in up
holding minimum wages for wo- I
men, but was one of the majority
in the recent O'Fallon Rate Case. 1
"His greatest service as chief
justice was hip. leadership of the
campaign to reform our outworn
system of judicial procedure, rte
was the inspiration of the move- '
ment."

accomplishments of the man who

"I have a very high opinion of
Taft," lie said, "and it seems to
me that his strength has not been
fully appreciated. He was popular,
and his likable personality was ap- j
predated generally, but not every
one fully realized how important to
the judicial history of the United
States his decisions have been. 1
"In IS9S, as Circuit Judge, he
passed judgment on the United
States vs. Allystone Pipe Company
case, which is unquestionably the
ablest, most comprehensive deci- I
sion that has ever been rendered
by any judge on contracts and com
binations in restraint of trade. This
opinion was one of the very im
portant early judicial constructions
of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act.
"One of Taft's outstanding char
acteristics as a jiidge was his judi
cial poise. He can't be classified
either as a conservative or as a i
radical progressive. For example,

men, but was one of the majority

Some of the strengths and weak
nesses of the late William Howard
Taft were sketched by Edgar Eu
gene Robinson, Professor of Amer
ican History and Director of Citi
zenship yesterday, following the
former president's sad passing.
"William Howard Taft came 1o
the presidency twenty-one years
ago, as was said at the time, better
prepared by public service than
most of his predecessors," Profes
sor Robinson stated, "tie was one
of the group of men called into the
national service by President Mc-
Kinley, among whom he and Elihu
Root were outstanding.
"His training was not the type
for the office of president, however,
as soon came to lie realized," the
professor continued. The president
must be an efficient administrator,
a national spokesman, and a party
leader. Taft was none of these.
"His party went to pieces in
Congress, and later in the country.
The questions underlying this
break were those now pressing
upon national attention, but which
were pushed aside by the years of
the War and its aftermath.
