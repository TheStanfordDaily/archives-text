# HONOR WITHOUT A SYSTEM IS CODE OF THE LAW SCHOOL, SAYS DEAN KIRKWOOD
## 
### BY FRITZ GOODWIN 
J his is Ihr eighth of a series of opinions on the proposed amendment to the
Honor Code which will establish a system of optional proctors, by those men
'who are best able to comprehend the situation, namely professors whet hare
large classes.

"Honor without any particular
system has been the code of the
Stanford Law School," stated Dean
Marion It. Kirkwood in a recent
interview concerning: the much-dis
cussed present Honor System.
"The Honor System is much
older in the Law School than in
the University in general, having
come into use over 2f> years ago.
In all that time there have been
only occasional breaches of con
duct. In my period of service in
the school, 1 have never lound any
thing to lead me to believe that the
system did not work, and work
very well.
"The excellent functioning of the
Honor System here can be attri
buted to tradition more than any
other factor. In the earlier days
the law students took what may
have been an unjustified pride in
the fact that they were almost the
only ones in the I'niversity taking
examinations without supervision.
The jealousy with which they re
garded their honor spirit has car
ried over to the present day.

"A general greater maturity of
students may partially explain the
tact that the Honor System has
worked so well in the Law School.
Law examinations are usually long
and afford ample opportunity for
cheating, but the underlying spirit
among the students condemns the
man who takes unfair advantage.
"Before any changes are mad"
in the present Honor System, it
would seem wise to first conduct
an investigation to discover just
where the greatest number of vio
lations occur. It has always been
ray personal belief that perhaps
breaches are more common in large
classes of first- and second-year
students than in advanced and
smaller classes.
"The proctor system would be a
possible solution in those classes
in which tlie investigation showed
( heating to lx j most frequent," Pro
fessor Kirkwood concluded. "Per
sonally. I cannot believe that the
Honor System as a whole can be
condemned, or that a change is
necessary throughout the Univer
sity."
