### BY PHILIP SPACE 
Stanford's unemployed did not
join in Thursday's World-Wide
demonstration.
They just went right on playing
bridge.
Wondering when the old man
was goin' to send that check.
My, we'd no idea some of our
friends were so important till we
looked in at the Horse Festival
Friday night!
The common herd wore inxedos.
For it's not everybody that has
an Army suit.
THANK G— D!

I We'd hardly know there WAS a
Military Department here if it
weren't for the Horse Festival. And
for windy days after a rain.
You know, things are pretty dead
around this campus. The Ex Com
mittee hasn't passed a resolution
for a long time.
Not only that, but some A.W.S.
constitutional changes were actu
ally defeated.
Come, come, girls. Everybody
knows constitutions hereabouts are
not fun at all unless they're altered
a couple of times a year.
Tell you what, though. We
certainly miss the Daily's print
j ing those: "I hereby nominate
Joseph Enblesby McPifflehei
raer for the office of sophomore
representative to tlie Executive
Committee of the Associated
Students of Stanford Univer
sity, California. Signed, this

day of our Lord, Monday, the
30th of February.—Jeffrey F.
] )inghat."

A few dozen of those, and the
Daily wouldn't have to print a thing
about the subtleties of the latest
dramatic masterpiece.

And that's all right with us.

Or, paraphrasing Bret Harte:
"Which 1 rise to remark
(and my language-is plain)
That for things that are dull
And for tricks that are vain
The puffing o? bum plays is
worst, which
The same I stoutly maintain."
