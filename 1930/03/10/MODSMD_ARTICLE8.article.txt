"It in very probable that India,
in the near future, will obtain her'
independence," predicts Kay Lai
Dixit, personal friend of Mabatma
Ghandi, the Indian Nationalist lead
er who framed the ultimatum of
March 11 to the British government
demanding Indian independence.
Dixit, who is a student here from
Buland, India, continued in a per
son interview with the Daily yester
day. "There is an awakening going
on everywhere in India.
"Passive resistance is far super
ior to force because it shows the
strength of the Oriental mnid," the j
Hindu remarked concerning Glian
di's methods. "It lias been very ef- j
fective »t Bardoll, where the Brit-j
ish government has yielded.
"India will split up for the time,
but later she will unite under one
ting. There will be bloodshed at
first but it will lead somewhere;
under the British government we
would never change.
"I am fully convinced that flhnn- j

di will fight with only peaceful
measures," Dixit stated. "If the
boundary of violence is broken, he
will retire. I have never met a
leader whose frankness is so child
like as Ghandi's. His greatest, aim
is to gain freedom for India with
all peaceful measures. He has been
working hard to teach the masses
what freedom means."
As an example of the British at
titude, he cited the government's
attitude toward the caste system.
"The British authorities have not
tried to remove the caste system
because of their fear that the Hin
dus would become united. The
caste system, as it is today, has
long been fought by the educated
classes. The British passed the law
prohibiting child marriage merely
to satisfy the educated classes in
India.
"We are against the British gov
ernment, but we are not against
Englishmen. However, under the
present system, we can not pro
gress."
