# RESCUERS SAVE 88 WORKERS IN OHIO MINE FIRE
## Blaze Starts When Trolley Is Short Circuited as Mine Car Jumps Track One Dead; Others Unhurt; 137 Miners at Work as Flames Are Discovered 
### 
STEL'BENVILLE, Ohio, March
10 (/P). Imperiled by burning timbers
and falling coal, rescue squads went
into the flame-swept Wolf Run mine
of the Warner Collieries near Am
sterdam, Ohio, today and brought 88
men to the surface, one of them dead
from smoke fumes and the others un
harmed.
The only fatality among the men,
who for hours were trapped behind a
lire wall that cut off the main entrance
to the mine, was a man who suffered
from asthma and could not survive the
smoke. He was Paul Borkowski, 65.
The lire started on the north side
of the mine about 2 p.m. It was said
to have been caused by a short circuit
when a mine car jumped the track and
pulled off the trolley.
Reports indicated there were 137
miners in the workings when the
flames broke out. Five of the men
rushed through the tire and escaped
trough the main entrance. They were
only slightly hurt.
Thirty-five others reached safety
through an opening on the south side
of the mine, leaving the remainder
trapped, with the east opening as the
best possible means of escape.
A few hours later 26 miners, pro
tecting themselves with sheets of
canvas from the flames that were eat
ing their way about them, were found
at the edge of the lire area. They
were carried out on a hoist that had
been partly damaged by lire. None
had been seriously hurt.
