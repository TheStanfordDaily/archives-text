Held within the ocean's arm,

Seals us to her loyal service
By tfte spirit she imparts.
Stand we then in saluation,
Love for thee shall never fail;
Hail to thee, Oh Alma Mater,
' Hail, hail, hail!
! Queen of all the lovely valley
Holding court in cloistered halls,
1 Welcoming th«' winds of Freedom,
Quick to rise when duty calls,
Stanford rules and serves su
premely,
Holding high the torch of truth,
In her name we wage our battles,
Hers the honor, ours the truth.
