# BLACK RAY TO BE WEAPON IN BOOTLEG FIGHT
## 'Washed' Alcohol Exposed Before "Black Light" Beams Is Claim Secret Developments Told At Medical Academy 
### 
NEW YORK, March 10. (A 3 )â€”A
new possibility for aiding prohibi
tion enforcement by using "black
light" to detect indelible identifica
tion marks in bootleg alcohol was
proposed here tonight.
The method would enable prohi
bition officers to take liquor made
from redistilled commercial alcohol
and, no matter how many times it
had been "washed" by the boot
logger, identify the place where the
original alcohol was manufactured.
The secret and the scientific de
velopments making it possible
were explained to the Society of
Medical Jurisprudence tonight, at.
the New York Academy of Medi
cine by Dr. Herman Goodman, a
member of the Academy. "Black
light" is ultra violet from which
the visible rays are filtered by a
special glass. Objects in this in
visible beam become luminous by
fluorescence.
Dr. Goodman filled two pitchers
with water and into one dropped
a dust fleck of a harmless chemical
common in chestnuts. It caused no
change in appearance of the water
in ordinary light, but. when the
pitchers were set under the invis
ible ray, the chestnut, water was a
brilliant electric blue.
"Alcohol," said Dr. Goodman,
"can be marked in the same way
with this chemical. It will show blue
whenever placed under these rays.
No amount, of distilling will get rid
of the telltale color, for one part
in five million of the chestnut stuff
is sufficient.
