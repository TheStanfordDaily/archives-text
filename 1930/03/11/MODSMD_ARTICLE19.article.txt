! "Mussolini has dramatized Ili
Fascist movement," said Professor
! Marbury Ogle of the Classical Lit
i erature Department, today, in an
interview on Kalian Fascism.
"There is a vision there of the
glory that was Home. Whether the
Kamo is worth the candle cannot
he determined until some economic
pinch conies. The Fascist regime,
on the surface at least, has brought
order out of chaos. It seemed after
the war that Italy was doomed.
Cities are now cleaner, sanitary
i arrangements are enormously Im
j proved, law and order are higher
! than in this country.
"As far as any tail-minded ob
| server can see, Italy lias also im
proved in morale. It is wrong t<Â»
say that the whole thing Is simply
a material Improvement. On the
debit side of the question, Ibe suc
cess of the Fascist regime has been
won at the expense of what we
should cull a democratic ideal.
Mussolini is quite trank about it.
He claims that democracy has
proved ii failure. The only question
is, can a regime demanding abso

lute obedience from the individual,
exist? Only time can tell."
According to Professor Ogle
Italy's foreign policy is very ques
tionable. lie said, "One secret of
the dictator's success is his empha
sis on a strong national movement.
This may have serious portent or
il may be only for the unification
of Italy. On all sides there are pre
parations for war.
"You must, remember," he con
tinued, "that Italy is a small coun
try dependent on foreign exports.
Population is at the saturation
point yet both Church and State
advocate, large families. Coloniza
tion is the only peaceful means to
relieve the pressure but Italy has
lew colonies. Many of Mussolini's
opponents feel that, like most dic
tators, he may appeal to war if the
economic crash does come.
"No one knows what will happen
if Mussolini falls. Possibly the
Fascists are too well organized to
have it make any difference. Any
leader must appeal to the imagina
tion of the people as Mussolini lias
done and, who knows, such a
leader may arise."
