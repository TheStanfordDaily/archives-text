I ovcring walls, Hour, ceiling, and
even the light fixture, several genera
tions of Stanford students have made
the pen filling station in the Library
send the odor of Waterman's ink sev
eral feet from the door of this fa
mous room, and have made the inte
rior resemble an enlarged edition of
scribbliugs and drawings found on
lecture notes. Famous autographs, ex
clamations, and written conversations
can be found on the spaccs of white
wall between spots.
Among those represented are Cara
Bow, Martha (identity unknown),
Kay Lyman VVibur, Dean Culver, and
Joe Zilch of Poltuwatamic Tech.

"Well, it looks like Fin due to roll,
fellows," speaks the handwriting on
the wall, and in ink of a more recent
vintage, is "Well, I only went on pro."
