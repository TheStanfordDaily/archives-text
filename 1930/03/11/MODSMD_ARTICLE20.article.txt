# BIDS OPEN SOON FOR ROBLE GYM
## Construction Should Start Within Three Weeks 
### 
Contractors' bids for the new Ro
blc gymnasium will be open in about
a week when the plans will be com
pleted, according to the architects.
Building will start in a minimum of
three weeks after bids are let out and
the gym should be finished in Novem
ber.
i The gym is to face Roblc 11 all and
will run from Dr. Dyment's present
office across the turf hockey field.
New turf hockey fields are planned
between the new building and Euca
lyptus avenue. Where the old gym
nasium is now ten new tennis courts
modeled after the varsity courts will
be built, extending across the old
courts, and a practice field for golf is
also scheduled.
Three swimming pools are in the
plans, for instruction, diving, and rec
reation. The diving pool will be 60
by 35 feet and the other two 75 by
.35 feet. Bleachers for meets will be
placed in the swimming yard, which
will Ik- surrounded by a wall.
Downstairs, in the gym, the fac
ulty offices will be off the main en
trance on the left and to the right are
the medical adviser's office and the
health service rooms. These rooms arc
to be complete with special rooms for
nose and throat and minor surgery.
In the physical therapy room the new
zoolites and ultra-violet equipment
which was installed this year will be
placed.
'I lie building is to be built around a
patio which will liavc a fountain, and
since a kitchenette and lounge go off
the court it will probably be much
used for such social occasions as teas
and gatherings at inter - collegiate
meets and play days. The sophomore
women have voted to furnish the
kitchenette, getting dishes and other
things not included in the budget al
lowed for the gym.
A small game room for squash and
handball, the large gym floor, and the
dance studio are also on the lir.st floor.
On the second are the sun porches and
the archery court.
