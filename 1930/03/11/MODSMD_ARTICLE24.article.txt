# ENGINEERING SCHOOL TO HELP STUDENTS FIND EMPLOYMENT
## 
### 
lii order to assist undergraduate j
engineering students to employ their |
summer vacations most profitably and I
to co-ordinate more efficiently the j
work of the various agcncics of the I
University dealing with employment j
problems of graduate engineers, the j
President ol the University and the ]
Board of Trustees have sanctioned
the formation of a standing faculty
c ommittee on employment activities in
tlie School of Engineering.
The school has announced that en
gineering students interested either in
summer employment or permanent po
sitions should fill out blanks to be ob
tained in Dean Hoover's office some
time before spring vacation.
This policy, it is expected, will pre
vent serious employment problems
here that have arisen at several large
technical schools in the Kast. Also the
new committee believes that the men j
who know both the students and the j
work can most efficiently assist under- !
graduates in the School in choosing j
summer work that will be most prof- :
itable to them professionally.
The new committee, it is announced,
is not intended to replacc existing or
ganizations or individual activities, but
will serve as a co-ordinating factor in
bringing into most effective co-opera
tion all of the available employment
activities of the University. In par
ticular the new body will co-opcrate
with the Appointment Office.
