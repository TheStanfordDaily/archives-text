# TRACK AND THE STADIUM
## 
### 
Although nothing' has been done in official channels, it seems likely
lhat Stanford will soon he the proud possessor of the \\ est's greatest
t;idium 1 Of>.ooo wild-eved foothall maniacs may be able to watch
the Warner machine instead of a mere 88,000.
from one point of view that news seems good; from another
point of view it arouses misgivings.
If the additional seats will, even in a small way, alleviate the
pressing Uig (lame ticket market and give pasteboards to a few more
deserving alumni and students, the project should be greeted with
rhapsodies of joy.
The possible joker, however, lies in the fact that the running track
will be removed from the stadium, if this expansion program is car
ried iint. According to the plan, a small stadium will be built on the
i-Id oval, and track meets will be held there.
\pparently, the only question is one of track. Certainly the
move will be good for football —and for the football fan. But
nothing should be done, it' such action will shunt track out of its
; ightful place as a leader among collegiate sports here.
1 112 this proposed "smaller" stradium for track spectators will be
.-imply large, then well and good. J>ut if football and the football fan
;in tn be bettered at the expense of track and the track fan, then the
project should be defeated.
Track may not be the business proposition that is the gridiron
; nine, but as a clean sport for sportsmen it knows no peer. I lere at
Stanford, Dapper Dink Templeton has turned out great Cardinal
teams, and nothing should be done to hinder his or their progress.
