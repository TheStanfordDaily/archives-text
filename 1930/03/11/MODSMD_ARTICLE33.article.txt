### 
Italy's famed Benito, wielder of the political blackjack on llir
hoot-shaped peninsula, has suddenly become concerned for the safety
ni" football players. At a conference with Italian football referees
recently he urged them to exert themselves and keep the ardor of
the athletes "within chivalrous limits."
Fair play in the field (if sports is quite another thing from fair
plav in government. An athlete has every right to the greatesi
i onsideration; he should he prevented from playing roughly when
off for a touchdown.
The opposing teams will have every freedom necessary to bring
n game to a conclusion so long as there are no tactics used which
would result in the loss of a single man from the ranks of the military
service.
Benito has only paternal concern for those who have not opposed
his regime; these and these only are worth protecting. What hap
pens to one who dares offer intelligent criticism of his government is
of interest also, hut that is a concern of an entirely different variety.
There must be fair play in sports, decrees the dictator; hut in
Italy fair play in politics is quite another thingâ€”as it is in America.
