CORONET. By Manuel Komroff.
Coward-McGann, Inc. New York,
1930. Sold at the Stanford Book
store.
"Engineer, com poser, painter,
journalist, editor, motion picture
critic, traveler," He. —thus Kom
roff is described in the publisher's
blurb on the book flap of his latest
novel. The tale is one of aristo
cracy—its influence and decline,
pictured from the early part of the
seventeenth century until the be
ginning of the twentieth. The coro
net, a masterpiece of line gold, in-
Jaiil with precious stones, stands
as a symbol of power and wealth,
hill il also represents the evil and
loss of a sense of values which is
ajit to accompany excessive author
ity. Through countless numbers of
hands it passes, playing its influ
ence on the long line of characters,
standing as an emblem of the pa
trician order.
Most interesting is the number
of historical characters brought
into the story, ami, also, the method
of weaving their power ami influ
ence into the main theme. The ac
count of Napoleon's army marching
to Moscow, its activities there, and
ils aftermath of hunger, poverty,
and colli, is exceedingly well done.
Chopin's death, and the influence
of a lovely Wattenu fan are also
well handled. Characters unique
and vivid abound, hui the wily lii
tle apprentice, Rocco, who later
ruins the honorable goldsmith's
trade by establishing a stockyard
across tiie street from each estab
lishment, seems to be the mosi at
tractive.
One feels, at various limes in
llie story, that Mr. Komroff may

I have been overpowered by his plot. ,
j There are so many characters, ho I
■ many incidents, so many scenes, j
that tlie handling sometimes be- !
awkward. Perhaps the story !
should have been enlarged into two I
volumes, or possibly several inci
dents, interesting as they are,
should have been entirely omitted.
; As the book stands, however, some
| spots seem sketchy, while others]
are verbose —filled with 'tits de
i tails, to use Abbe Dimnet's ex*
; pressive phrase, which destroy a
certain uniformity a good book
must have. The novel's good quali
fies, however, overcome this ob-'
j jection. —H. S. E.
HUNTING TIGERS IN INDIA—At
the Varsity Theatre.
i Pinkertou started it.. Then came
! the magic lantern and the stereop
' (icon. "Simba" of silent and sacred
memory followed. And now, "in
dorsed by leading colleges and pro- j
duced under the auspices of the
American Museum of Natural Ilis
lory"- they needn't have told us,
conies "Hunting Tigers In India."
To think that. Senator Stanford j
started il! Foresighted as he was, j
lie couldn't have foreseen this.
The cause of sugar-coated educa
tion has always been dubious. See
litis :ill<l ii becomes unattractive.
You will be is wearied ;is if you
bad gone on the journey.
And Hie intelligence of the ele
phants gives you an inferiority
complex.
II is mi educational picture. The
only thing worth remembering is
the religion episode, an excellent j
argument for continuing British
t control in India. B. P.
