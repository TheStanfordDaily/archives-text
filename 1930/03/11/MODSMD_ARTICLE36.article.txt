## THE 						ETIQUETTE OF SELLING 
### 
The F.ditor, Sir:
A gentleman refrains from criticiz
ing ladies (openly), but for poor
souls who cringe under the wrath of
femmes your columns should he a
safe outlet for views.
Just another gripe—this time the
bookstore. A new quarter's due soon
with certain business for it. Maybe
we wouldn't mind being held under a >
monopoly if its service were gullible, I
hut it's rather a source of indigestion
to face some of the ladies who wait |
on us. It's the height of something- I
or-other to have to stand in line for |
hours to spend money, then to he
cared for by a person whose attitude
is of doing one a favor in waiting on j
him. Jt may be that the rush at the [

'beginning of the quarter is hard on
the ladies, but for some, the effects
seem to linger all quarter—it seems
to be a tough job for some of them
to wait on us at any time, though
they're paid to do just that. Probably
their salaries aren't enough for them
to keep an car-to-car grin on their
faces, nor do they have to "Oh-thank
vou-Sir" us; but surely they're being
paid enough to warrant a little more
willing and non-condescending service.
A qualification—it is a pleasure to
give money to some of our bookstore
ladies. Perhaps they'll help us by
giving a course in "The Etiquette of
Bookstore Selling to the Needy."
For a pleasant start to next quarter.
