# Cabbages and Things
## 
### BY PHILIP SPACE 
Tn ease you have missed us |
tlie lust couple of days, look
in the back issues which you
have been so carefully keeping.
You will find "Cabbages" neat
ly tucked away and folded in
three parts under the latest
unnecessary defense of the
Honor Code. Or smothered by
the dust arising from "Invest
ment Hanking, Advertising Are j
Well Paid, But Difficult Pro
fessions."
But, nevertheless, this is a Daily '
column, and as such will make you !
choke on your I'nion Coffee each |
morning.
At least, it won't be hard to do
THAT.
On 1 his. the lasl day of the Stan- I
ford Daily-except-on-Saturday-Sun- j
day-1 lolidays-and-Finals Week, ,we j
suppose we ought to sort of sum up i
the winter quarter. You never can
tell—we might not return in the 1
spring. Laguriita is so templing,
and examinations so dull (and so i
I
are wo).
And if we can persuade
enough of youse guys to lake
the water cure for scholastic i
worries maybe we can lower !
the class average enough to i
pass ilia! particular ex.
Legs afe long, but frosh are j
fleet ing.
. . . Well, so long, "me hear- t

ties," we trust that next week's
handwriting on the blackboard
doesn't prove to be the hand- |
writing on the wall.
It's been so pleasant here, break- !
ing through ihe red tape into green |
pastures.
And, finally, in passing:
An advertisement in a local
theatre informs us of "Fairy Tales |
for Children in the Stanford As- !
sembly Hall."
What? Another play so soon? |
Yeh, YOU know the one we mean,
Prof. !
Tint summing up the winter quar
ter is, somehow, pretty futile. A 1
friend of ours did it best when lie
said, with a sigh of relief—"Well,
spring is here!"
But when w- think of that rush
ing season coming up ... !
j
not to mention spring politics.
Sometimes it just doesn't seem
worthwhile going on.
We understand Hie sponsors, by
the way, have helped some of Ihe '
freshmen to earn 1 heir way through I
school.
A helping hand, that's Ihe upper
classman always.
Eggstains are SO hard to remove.
