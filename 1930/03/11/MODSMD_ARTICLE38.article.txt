# ALUMNI BACK TO COLLEGE MOVEMENT BEGINS
## 
### 
A college for the alumni, an educa
tional innovation which is Raining a
foothold in the minds of educators all
over the .nation, is gradually coming
into being. Lafayette College la>t
year founded an alumni college and
this year plans to make it a permanent
institution.
Alumni return to the campus for a
week or two during the year to keep
abreast of events at the scene of their
undergraduate days. Hesides offering
a continuance of adult education and
an opportunity for relaxation, the
alumni college will present a partial
solution to the problem of what to do
with one's leisure time, supporters of
the movement say.
One of the outstanding criticisms of
a college education is that the gradu
ate begins to forget and retrogress al
most as soon as he gels his diploma

I and leaves the university.
Formation of a post-graduate scliool
such as an alumni college will serve
to keep the college graduate interested
iin learning and self-improvement. It
will afford him an opportunity to ex
ploit any after-college ambitions he
may have had hut which he was pre
j vented from using by the lack of an
outlet.
Habits of study and the desire for
betterment are not dropped immedi
ately upon graduation by the student
Who is really interested in furthering
his education. He will welcome a
chance to keep in touch with his alma
i mater both in an academic and activity
way such as is offered in an alumni
! college. Education, long attacked for
it-< sluggishness in making progressive
steps, has a chance here to answer to
its critics.
