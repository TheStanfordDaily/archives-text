(lie statement made by Doctor Mar
gery Bailey, Professor of ( Knglisli,
•in: interview on the ' Honor CVjfde'ycs
tei^iay.
Miss llailey went on <to .give., her
view on . the subject that h;is bteii
under discussion on the' cam|*is- by
flaying, "There. arc too maily ■ forms
of cheating to make a proctor system
valuable or even possible. The prac
tice of copying themes either from an
individual or from the -stock jn a
house library cannot be checked by the
proctor system. Nor can it stop the
wholesale theme composing by which
some qf our students make a living.
Grades of Cheating
"There are varying grades of using
other people's ideas for 'original re
ports'l— from copying Arnold or Maz
litt .wholesale down to making ex
cerpts frojn their essays without dis
tinct reference... Getting other people's
ideas—which means.absorbing without
giving credit and passing on other's
ideas as one's own, is to my mind a
much worse practice than cheating on
a test.
"It yiay be said that the present
system puts too much responsibility
for catching the cheater on the pro
fessor. Under the accepted system of
education, that is where it belongs.

lie is a,t least not made a complete
Tool, "lie is,''when in spite of proc
tors and watching, cheating occurs
after all. Under the honor idea, the
'professor's dignity, and the student's
jlecency arc both taken for granted.
.Remedies Suggested
• "Possibly two changes would cre
ate a good .effect not in the 'honor
system' but in the general educational
process. •
"1. i lold classes only in small groups
(never - more than 50) so that the
teacher .could know his group and cor
rect his own papers. He would not
have to ask petty, brief questions, but
those of a caliber demanding reason
and information's a basis. The cram
mer and cheat can never get along in
such examinations.
"2. Exercise care in the preparation
of examination questions. If any pro
fessor is so lazy as to use year after
year the same set of questions, what
can he expect? Nothing but the con
temptuous taking advantage on the
part of his students; he invites it.
This is true of true-false examina
tions, or sheets on which blanks are
to be filled in. A student aware that
he sat in the class of such a lazy and
ineffectual fellow would be lacking in
elemental human wits if he failed to
take scornful advantage of the per
son's bad habits."
