TOO MUCH GRAVY
That the rich diet of athletic
performances that has been
offered to Stanford students
has dulled their sense of ap
preciation for tasty morsels is
only too apparent after the
lethargic manner in which the
spectators at last Saturday's
track meet greeted the marks
of Eric Krenz and Harlow
Rothert in the weight events.
Krenz, throwing the shot fart hot'
thiiti lie had ever thrown it before,
won the event with a toss of 51
l'eet 7 1 inches, ;in<l Rothert took
second place with a heave of 50
I'eet !t inches. Vet when the silver
throated Don Lieb mdorfer trilled
ihis news out to the assembled
multitude, which was fairly size
able as track crowds go, there
wasn't a ripple of applause. And
■when Krenz stepped out to twirl
the discus some 155 feet or more,
the silence was deafening.
We wonder if the students real
ize Dial Messrs. Krenz and Rothert
are the only two men now enrolled
in an American university that
have ever beaten 50 feet in the shot
put, to say nothing of 51 feet; that
their performance on Saturday,
made anywhere but in the Stanford
Stadium, would have literally "laid
'em' ill'the aisles," and that there
are about six collegians in the
country thai can throw the 1(5-
pound pellet past the 47-fooi mark.
We wonder also if they remem
ber that it wasn't so long ago when
the world's record in the discus
was only 154 feet, and that, while
some three or tour gentlemen have
topped that mark once in their
career, no one throws the platter
as far as Krenr: does with his con
sistency.
Just what future generations
of Stanford students will do
when the line of great weight
men the Cardinal has had runs
out is problematical, but we
wager the time will come when
they will condescend to favor
with a cheer a mark of 46 feet
in the shot or a toss of 145 feet
in the discus.
