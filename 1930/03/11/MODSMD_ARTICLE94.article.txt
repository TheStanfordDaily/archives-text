# Hec Dyer Runs Hundred Yard Dash In 9.7 sec.
## 
### 
Running the 100-yard dash in
0 7-10 seconds at truck practice
last night, Hec Dyer served notice
on the Trojans that he would be
very much iu the competition for
points when the Cards meet Couch
Dean Cromwell's men in the Stmtii
April 12. His time was the best
that has been made on the Stan
ford track this season, and is bet
ter than Wyckoff of the Trojau.s
has made so far.
Each year for the past three sea
sons, the .Trojans have had the
meet won on paper, only to-see
their hopes gradually fade as the
time for the contest approached.
Each year. Dink Templet on has de
veloped enough men to take Crom
well's aggregation, and as the time
for the meet conies closer, Temple
ton becomes more and more opti
mistic over the prospects.
Further encouragement in the
Cardinal camp was furnished by
the news last night that I'ercili-
Minntti would be able to start
throwing the javelin at once. I lis
best mark of 19S feet. II inches
last season will be a good starting
point for furthei improvement, and
his return to practice should ma
terially strengthen the Cards for
the coming, meet, llis arm has been
slowly mending since lie injured it
before the 1.C.4-A. meet last year,
and he has not thrown for several
months in order to be sure that lie
would not suffer further injury
to it.
With good weather in prospect
for the next four weeks the squad
should be in the best of shape for
the meet. Cooper's .showing in the
meet with the Olympic Club seenis
to show that Dink has found the
right event for him.
