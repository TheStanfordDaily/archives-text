Today, in a locked room in the Crane labora
tories, can be seen a chcrry-rcd bar of metal.
In a specially devised air-tight cylinder, under
constant temperature of 1600° F., at fixed
stress, it is being given the 1000 hour " flow"
test. At the same temperature, at various
stresses, it will be given the same test for the
same time-period.
The tests arc being made at the request of an
oil man who has asked for valves for an exper
imental still, to operate at 1500° and 2500
pounds. Can he have them? At the end of the
exhaustive tests, Metallurgist L. W. Spring
will be able to tell him, exactly,authoritatively.
Since the first Crane chemical and testing
laboratory was founded in 1888, thousands
of similar questions so vital to safe and eco
nomical industrial progress, have been asked
and answered. The contribution made by
Crane metallurgists to scientific knowledge
of the reaction of metals under high pressures
and temperatures is known and respected
throughout the world, is familiar to every oil
man who has used the cracking process and
every engineer who has to do with piping.
