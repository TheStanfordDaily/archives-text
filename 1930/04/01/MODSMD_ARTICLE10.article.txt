# STANFORD STUDENTS REDISCOVER SPECIES OF FORGOTTEN FISH
## 
### 
Acting upon information found in
the files of the 11.8. biological sur
vey of 1801 two Stanford students,
Joseph H. Wales and George S.
Myers, spent the vacation redis
covering a certain species of min
now which inhabit the warm
springs of Death Valley and the
Ainargosa Desert and which have
been forgotten for almost forty
years.
The species, which is now almost
extinct, was originally described
and named in 18M by Dr. C. 11.
Gilbert, a former head of the
Zoology department, at Stanford. It
was named Empetrichthys Merri
ami in honor of Dr. C. Hart Mer
riam, who was a member of the
survey.
