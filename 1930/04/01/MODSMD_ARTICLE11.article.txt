When tin* Registrar's Office
' closed last night HoliB students had
! enrolled, which is seventy-five
' more than on the same day last
! year, when the number was 299;}.
Yesterday's registration was ro-
I maskable for promptness and com
pleteness. The larger proportion of
students finished the routine in the
forenoon, and of the total number
j taking out books only 41) still had
| unfinished details to be adjusted
at the end of the flay. Last year
there were 141.
The explanation lies largely in
the fact that most of those regis-
I tering are old students returning,
i according to Registrar J. Pearce
j Mitchell. The spring quarter, he
j explains, is a bad time of the year
j for students to enter the Univer-
I sity by transfer from other col
| leges, and no new Lower Division
! men are admitted to the University
j in the spring quarter.
