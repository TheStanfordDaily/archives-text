# DINK TEMPLETON DENIES REPORTS OF CANCELLED TRACK MEET WITH U.S.C.
## "As Far as I Know the Meet Is Officially On," Says Mentor, in Regard to Location Fight; "I May Run Down with Masters to Look Over the Tracks" 
### 
I
II WORTS from Los Angeles that the Stanford-Southern California
j track meet, scheduled for April 1~, would probably be cancelled be
! cause of the inability of athletic officials of the two universities to
I agree on a site for the contest were met last night by Coach Dink
j Templeton of the Cardinal tracksters with the remark that, "as far as
| 1 know, the meet is officially on."
An Associated Press dispatch of yesterday from Los Angeles stated
j that Templeton's failure to put in an official appearance in the South
i land yesterday to look over proposed siles for the meet was a strong

indication that, the clash to decide
I lie cinderpath supremacy of the
Pacific Coast would probably be
called off. To this, Templeton would
make no reply other than the state
ment that he "might run down with
Al Masters to look over the tracks."
The bone of contention appears
to be the refusal of Gwynn Wilson,
U.S.C. graduate manager, to stage
the meet anywhere but in tlie
South. The Los Angeles Coliseum
track is undergoing repairs, hence
is unavailable, and the Occidental
College track, considered the best
of the other ovals in Southern Cali
fornia, lias not met with the ap
proval of the Cardinal authorities,
who wish the meet to be held here.
Wilson's objections to the last pro
posal are that four out of the last
live Stanford-U.S.C. "meets have
been held here, and that the coming
meet will be the Trojans' only op
portunity to appear before their
home supporters, inasmuch as they
met California at Berkeley, and
must come north again in May for
the Pacific Coast Intercollegiates
here.
Meanwhile, the trackmen of both
instntutions, unmindful of the con
flict that waged over the scene of
their duel, continued working out
in preparation for the meet.
