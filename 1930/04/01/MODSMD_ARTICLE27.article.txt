# WOMEN'S GYM WILL NOT BE COMPLETED UNTIL NEXT WINTER
## 
### 
Although it seems certain thai
the women will eventually have a
! new gymnasium, the question of
■ when is still uppermost. The latest,
j report from the architects, Hake
'well and Weihe, indicates that it.
I will be some time, at least, a month,
I before ground will be broken, since
the drawings have not yet been
I sent. out. for figures. If Almon K.
! liotli. Comptroller, returns to the
j campus Friday, it is probable that
I the figures will be let. then.
Since it will take some eight
! months once ground is broken he
i fore it. will be possible to use th<»
gymnasium, the prospects of being
in it before next winter cyiarter are
very slight. Although three swim
tiling pools will be built along with
the gymnasium, tennis courts are
being left until the structure i.i
completed.
The gymnasium is to I'aee Uoblc
Hall, and will be built where the
grass hockey field is. Plans for s<»v
era I new grass hockey fields hive
I been- made and these will alf.o be
! used for basket hall.
