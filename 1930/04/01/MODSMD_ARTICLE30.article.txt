# THE
						S.P. SHOULD ACT
## 
### 
The tragedv which occurred last week at the Palo Alto station
makes one wonder it' the Southern Pacific Company will ever he
brought to the realization that the archaic facilities it has provided
here are :t menace to public safety as well as an insult to a progres
sive city.
If the Southern Pacific cannot see its way clear to build a re
spectable depot it is bad enough, but when the company does not
provide for ordinary safety, it is deserving of the severest censure.
\nd it is obviously unsafe to permit the large crowds of com
muters, who utilize the S.P., free range of the station platform and
the double tracks when dozens of trains thunder through Palo Alto
daily.
Last week's tragedy is only one of several others which have
occurred during the last few years. It should inspire the Southern
Pacific to action.
A picket fence betweeiLthe two tracks and a pedestrian subway
would remove all danger. The cost would be small when it is com
pared with the loss of even one life.
