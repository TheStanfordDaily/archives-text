# SPRING'S FIRST ELECTION
## 
### 
The first of the spring crop of elections will make its debut
Thursday morning when nominations for the new Women's Council
are held. The earlv date has been set so that the incoming president
(if A.YV.S. will have more than a few hours in which to prepare for
the national conference which is to he held in Wyoming in a few
weeks.
This election, besides determining those who will hold the reins
of the women's government for the next year, will be the first real
test of the new A.W.S. constitution. It will inaugurate the system
of preferential voting orr a scale which will have some significance
as the last A.W.S. election was settled without any resort to the
second or third choices.
The most startling innovation of the new system is the possi
bility of a Women's Council consisting of five new and inexperi
enced members. Whether it will become a tradition that the junior
members of the Council remain to hold the senior offices of the
executive group is a question that only next Tuesday's election can
solve. In view of the year's experience in the work, it would seem
desirable fo have someone behind the governmental helm who was
thoroughly acquainted with the problems to be met. I lowever, the
\.S.S.I", offices are held without previous experience.
As there remain but two days before the nominations, now is
the time for all good Stanford women to start thinking politically
and consider the possibilities for the officers to handle their affairs
next year. Now is the time for the Five Hundred to show their
preference.
