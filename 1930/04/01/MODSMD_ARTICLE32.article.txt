# IS BURON FITTS BEING WRONGED?
## 
### 
It is a sad commentary on American politics that ihe sudden
zealousness of Mr. Huron Fitts in the Julian oil mess has caused
many to doubt the motives which inspired Los Angeles' district
attorney.
It is remembered instantly that Mr. Fitts looks with covetous
eves upon the gul>ernatorial seat now occupied bv his former chief,
C. C. Young. The Doubting Thomases see in Mr. Irills'1 r i11s' zeal evi
dence that he realizes the value of publicity in furthering his political
aims.
As a matter of fact, one seems justified in wondering why Fitts
waited until such a propitious time to spring his sensational list of
indictments on the dear public. At best it seems to be a very happy
coincidence â€”for Mr. Fitts.
It is possible, even probable perhaps, that the information which
led to tlu*e numerous indictments came to Mr. Fitts' hands only
recently. It is possible that the proximity of these indictments and
the race for governorship is a coincidenceâ€”a real one.
If such is the case and if Mr. Fitts' motives are only those which
should motivate an earnest public official in the pursuit of his duties,
then Los Angeles' district attorney is being done a real injustice.
Cranting that Mr. Fitts is being done an injustice, upon whom
should he place the blame? Certainly not upon those who doubt.
Mr. Fitts should place the blame for his dilemma upon men of his
own ilk -public servants. The "dear public" has learned to distrust
every move and every statement of the men of its choice. Experi
ence has made "the j>eople" sadder and wiser.
