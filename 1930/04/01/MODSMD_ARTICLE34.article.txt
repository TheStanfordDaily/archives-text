THE WOMAN OF ANDROS—By
Thornton Wilder. New York:
Albert and Charles Boni. 1930.
An island of Greece, during the
long period of decline which l'ol
! lowed the greater days of Attic
j glory, is the setting of Thornton
Wilder\s most recent novel. A style
! similar to that, which lent an atraos
, phere (if serenity and peace to "The
l Bridge of San Louis Hey" is well
1 fitted to the scene of this novel
I of characters and ideas.
The woman of Andros is Chrysis,
la talented hetaera, who leads bril
' liant conversations of the young
men who gather at, her banquets.
Clycerium, her sister, secretly
meets Pamphilius and, at the close
iof the novel dies in childbirth.
(This tragedy, however, only height
lens the impression of serenity of
j those whose aim is to "praise all
living, the blight and the dark."
The emphasis, throughout, is
; upon tone and upon ideas. In both
i attempts at artistry the author is,
in large measure, successful. Every,
•thing is touched with beauty and
with peace.
The Woman of Andros might
well be compared to Donn Byrne's
Messer .Marco Polo. Ii excites in
; the reader of modern American fic
j tion the same feeling of surprise
and pleasure. Beauty, seen through
the mists of antiquity, is not usual
j among the mass of realistic novels
which arg printed annually. It is not
in the current of literature, but it
is none the less pleasing and it
may well serve as something of a
balance. II shows, at any rate, that
the cult still survives.
Alst) pleasing is the fact that a
modern could so well have caught

the ancient spirit of acceptance of
fate and the enjoyment of life as it
is found. Tile characters are in
teresting and are completely in ac
cord with the atmsophere in which
they live.
The Woman of Andros, then, is
not of great creative value; it is too
mature, too completely resigned to
be greatly inspiring. Tt is a beauti
ful tale. —E. E. W.
THE COHENS ANDTHE KELLYS
IN SCOTLAND—At the Var
sity Theatre.
A Jewish-Irish "comedy," with
the locale in Scotland, and made
by Universal. Any customer think
ing uj) a worse situation sets a
pass to see the embalmed whale!
Just to prove how bad the com
bination can be, such a picture is
offered to a supposedly intelligent
audience at the Varsity. A very
few lines and spots in this opera
even approach what we might term
"funny." For instance, one of the
big laugh moments is when Cohen
leans over and Kelly hits him with
a golf stick. A panic! And naturally
the producers had to use the big
tag-day-in-Rdinburgh wheeze. A
natural! Of course, Cohen and
Kelly are always lighting. Gee, it's
funny! You get dialect from the
opening shot (a fake scene in a
train) to the end (when Cohen and
Kelly are fighting. You see they'd
made up and then they start fight
ing again). If you can thing of any
more hackneyed ingredients to mix
into this mess, you will find them
in "The Cohens and Kellys in Scot
land."
A great picture for the first week
of a dandy spring quarter!
