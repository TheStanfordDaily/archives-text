Well, niosl of youse bright and
shining mugs are buck again, ready
for whatever the Administration
and the I'nion litis served up for
you. The stauneliest. digestions will
; fare the best.
Tuition remains the same, but
i the Cellar is now charging an extra
nickle for butter for a buttered
snail.
And what is called "coffee" for
I lack of a better name is still a
dime.
; News note:
The Navy will soon start work
ion a new two-deck battleship.
Collar Note: The waiter will soon
| start work on a three-decker sa-nd
wich.

Hot weather is said to have han
dicapped the baseball team in the
r.S:C, series.

Those of our avid readers who
couldn't make head nor tail out of
the "Cabbage" column appearing
just before vacation had nothing
on "ye author." Our comments made
even less sense than usual. But
we cannot be expected to know
when the type will be used for
juggling purposes by "the boys in
the backroom" â€”the jolly fellows!
Daily motto:
"See what the boys in the Back
Room will have."
We'll try to have some sequence
for Our Public after this, if nothing
else.
