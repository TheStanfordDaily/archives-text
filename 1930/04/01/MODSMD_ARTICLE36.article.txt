# GERMAN PHYSICIST WILL LECTURE ON ATOMIC PROPERTIES
## 
### 
T)r, Otto Stern, professor of phys
ical chemistry and director of the
| Physico-chemical Institute of the
, University of Hamburg, Germany,
one of the world's leading physic
; ist.s, Mill give a lecture in Room
370, Physics liuilding, at 4 o'clock
{tomorrow afternoon, to which all
interested are invited.
Professor Stern's talk will be on
the deflection of atomic rays by
| magnetic fields. This is a subject
in which he is particularly an au
thority, his work having proved
I that isolated atoms have magnetic
'properties as predicted by recent
J studies of atomic structure.
