# Baseball Varsity Breaks Even On Tour
## CARD NINE BOWS TWICE TO U.S.C., DEFEATS U.C.L.A. Trojans Take Conference Lead; Wolters' Men Drop to Third 
### 
After dropping; two tilts to the
league-leading Trojans lust Tuesday
and Wednesday, Stanford's base
ball varsity ran away from the
U.C.L.A. ball-tossers in a double
header Saturday and managed to ,
make a .500 percentage out of 4 the
week's play in t lie Southland.
Perry Taylor hurled the little
pellet for the Cards in the first
contest against Southern California
under a blistering sun, and was
nicked for ten hits, eight runs, and
the old ball game. Kelly made the
only tally for Stanford in the eighth
frame when he reached first on Wil
cox's error and came around on hits
by Taylor and Churchill.
U.S.C. Wins 8-0
Troy took the second tilt by
ngain making eight markers off
Looinis this time, and keeping the
Cards scoreless. Welter's men
stacked the bags with none away
in the first inning, but failed to liif j
in the pinches. Both Rintala and
Kelly, conference leading batters,
went hitless against tlie Trojan
moundsmen.
Don Story clamped down hard in
the first game with the Bruins and
allowed only four hits while his
teammates batted the ball all
around the lot, including a circuit
cloul by Campbell, to bring in six
tallies. U.C.L.A. scored its fwo runs
when Hunken stumbled in running
after Urubaker's long flv with one j
man on, and the hit went for a ;
homer.
Taylor Homes
The Westwood team came back
strong in the second encounter bat
ling in four digits, including three
home runs off Leverenz in the first
two cantos, but Taylor was rushed
into the fray and held off the oppo
sition with only one hit during the
rest of the day. The I'.C.L.A.;- dia
mond, like Santa Clara's, is one of
these fenceless affairs, and Taylor
realized his ambition by lofting out
;i long blow between the fielders
for ;i four-base jaunt. A triple by
Hunken, Kelly's double, and numer
ous singles added to the general
merriment and the Cards went j
home happy with a grand total of i
thirteen runs.
