# HIGH HOPES FOR 1932...
## Watch These Boys Rise Higher to Fame! Nelson Has Beaten Bob King, and Spitz Looks Good to U.S. 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Here are a couple of lads whom i
Uncle Sam should he right glad to
have around in 10H2 when the tenth
Olympic Games occur in Los An
geles. One is a senior in high
school, I lie other a sophomore in
college, so there is no reason why
they shouldn't be in rare form two
years hence. The two laddies in
question are both high jumpers
(and when I say "high" 1 mean
just that!), one of whom has
cleared G feet 4Vi inches, the other
two and a quarter inches higher.
Now the number of athletes in
this country who have jumped over
a cross bar at a height of six feet
five inches or better from the
ground is limited, and you can
count the six-foot-six jumpers on
the fingers of your two hands, and
not use your thumbs either. So it
is remarkable when seventeen-)
year-old George Spitz of Flushing
High School throws his body over
a wooden crosspiece at a distance
of fi feet 4*/2 inches from tlie floor
level (lie jumped indoors) and also i
when Bert Nelson of Butler TTni- 1
versity clears <5 feet 6% inches,]

I also indoors, but from a dirt floor.
Now, "Spit" is it horrid word but
it's worse on the end of your cigar;
but "Spitz" is no horrid juniper,
and he's better right now than 110
end of "leapers" who have repre
sented America in past Olympic
games.
Spitz is the National Junior In
door champion while Nelson is the
National Junior outdoor champion,
and beat King, Olympic titleholder,
in the Millrose games last month in
New York. Both should improve
upon their best, marks out-of-door.m
this spring and summer.
j The world's record in tlv? high
jump is held by Harold Osbom, at
6 feet B*4 inches, made in 1924.
I remember vividly the time George
Horine. of Stanford University,
broke the long-standing resold of
,6 feet 5% inches, set by Sweeney
in 1895. Horine leaped 6 feat 0
and a fraction in 1912, and a little
later cleared 0 feet 7. .Then his
; arch-rival from the University of
j California, Eddie Beeson, took the
record away from him in 1914 with
la jump of 5-16 of an inch higher.

broke the long-standing resold of
,6 feet 5% inches, set by Sweeney
in 1895. Horine leaped 6 feat 0
and a fraction in 1912, and a little
later cleared 0 feet 7. .Then his
; arch-rival from the University of
j California, Eddie Beeson, took the
record away from him in 1914 with
la jump of 5-16 of an inch higher.

Here are a couple of lads whom i
Uncle Sam should he right glad to
have around in 10H2 when the tenth
Olympic Games occur in Los An
geles. One is a senior in high
school, I lie other a sophomore in
college, so there is no reason why
they shouldn't be in rare form two
years hence. The two laddies in
question are both high jumpers
(and when I say "high" 1 mean
just that!), one of whom has
cleared G feet 4Vi inches, the other
two and a quarter inches higher.
Now the number of athletes in
this country who have jumped over
a cross bar at a height of six feet
five inches or better from the
ground is limited, and you can
count the six-foot-six jumpers on
the fingers of your two hands, and
not use your thumbs either. So it
is remarkable when seventeen-)
year-old George Spitz of Flushing
High School throws his body over
a wooden crosspiece at a distance
of fi feet 4*/2 inches from tlie floor
level (lie jumped indoors) and also i
when Bert Nelson of Butler TTni- 1
versity clears <5 feet 6% inches,]

I also indoors, but from a dirt floor.
Now, "Spit" is it horrid word but
it's worse on the end of your cigar;
but "Spitz" is no horrid juniper,
and he's better right now than 110
end of "leapers" who have repre
sented America in past Olympic
games.
Spitz is the National Junior In
door champion while Nelson is the
National Junior outdoor champion,
and beat King, Olympic titleholder,
in the Millrose games last month in
New York. Both should improve
upon their best, marks out-of-door.m
this spring and summer.
j The world's record in tlv? high
jump is held by Harold Osbom, at
6 feet B*4 inches, made in 1924.
I remember vividly the time George
Horine. of Stanford University,
broke the long-standing resold of
,6 feet 5% inches, set by Sweeney
in 1895. Horine leaped 6 feat 0
and a fraction in 1912, and a little
