# MASTERS STARTS NEW SYSTEM OF GOLF LINKS FEES
## Quarterly Cards Replaced By Transferable Scrip Of 25 Rounds 
### 
Transferable scrip for twenty
dollars and entitling their holders
to twenty-five rounds of golf re

quarterly card system of fees on
the Stanford golf course this quar
ter, stated Graduate Manager Al
Masters yesterday. Faculty mem
bers only will be allowed to buy the
quarterly cards at twenty dollars,
an increase of five over last quar
ter.
The new system is principally to

011 the number of students on the

direct result of complaints of the
outside members of the links. The
scrip will be transferable among
the students and faculty, but will
he confiscated if transferred to out
siders, and will not be replaced in
case of loss.
"The purpose of the transferable
scrip," said Masters, "is to allow
fraternity houses and other groups
to purchase the rights to play on
the course and re-distribute them
to players, and in this way greatly
cut down on the individual cost to
individual golfers."
Regular green fees to the stu
dents and faculty of $1.00 on week
days and $2.00 on Saturdays, Sun
days. and holidays will continue.
Outsiders accompanied by mem
bers, students, and faculty will be

and $4.00.
Outside members will have Ihe

lowing. after which time students
