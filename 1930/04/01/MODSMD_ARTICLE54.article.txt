# INTERCLASS TRACK MEET, IRISH MARATHON SCHEDULED FOR 2:50
## 
### 
Track funs will probably have
tlieir last chance to see the Stan
ford varsity in action before the
California meet when the annual
interclass meet and Irish Marathon
is run off this afternoon at the
Stadium. The interclass will start
at 2:50 o'clock, with the marathon
the last event on the program. An
admittance charge of twenty-five
cents will be made.
Morrison vs. Eastman
Many thrilling performances
should result from (lie meet. Mor
rison will have his first real test
of the year in the 440 when he
meets Ben Eastman, phenomenal
freshman runner. Eastman ran the
440 in 48 2-5 seconds last Saturday,
which is about as nood as Morrison
lias ever done, and better than his
time this season by a second. Since
Morrison has been content to loaf
around the oval and win his races
in the final stretch, his perform
ance against Eastman will be an
indication of what may be expected
in the meet with U.S.C. Incident
ally, Eastman's time is the best
reported in the United States this
yea r.
Krenz and Itotliert will have
their usual shot-putting duel. Roth*
ert's best mark of the season, 51
feet 8 inches, is just one-half an
inch better than that made by the
big track captain, and either man
is likely to better his mark to win.
George Grey will try to pass the
150-foot mark in the discus, though
lie does not figure to win the event
from Krenz, who tossed the platter
166 feet. Itotliert and Jones will
both try to equal the mark made
by Hall in the Cal-U.S.C. meet last
Saturday, which was about 149
feet.
Parker May Win
Parker will have a chance to re
venge himself on Storms for the
defeats handed him in the mile,
ond Neikirk and Atkinson will fight
it out in the 880 with Naylon and
Fullenwider of the frosli.
Prizes have been offered by
merchants of Palo Alto for the win
ners of the novelty stunts that are >
a regular feature of the interclass 1
and marathon. These include a bi
cycle race, three-legged race,
chicken race, steeplechase, and a
sack race. Because of a protest by
the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, the greased pig
race has been eliminated from the
list.
The Irish Marathon, which is re
lay race in which four teams of
twenty-four men each compete, is

exciting events iu track. The lead

ways iu doubt up to the last lap.
