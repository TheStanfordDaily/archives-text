# SENATOR WINS APPLAUSE WITH DRY LAW RAP
## Maryland Democrat Scores Wets For "Running With Crowd To Be Re-elected" Senate Chamber Startled; Demonstration of Crowd Ends Brookhart Heckling 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 1 iff*).—
Warned of defeat for his attacks on
tlir dry law. Senator Tydings, Demo
crat, Maryland, was applauded en
thusiastically from the galleries in
the Senate today as he shouted he
would continue to light a "cause which
is simply dragging the United States
and all its traditions and philosophy
down into the mire of crime and cor
ruption and hypocrisy.
The Maryland wet was replying to
Senator Brookhart, Repulican, lowa,
a dry, who had warned Tydings that
his former colleague, Senator Bruce,
Democrat, Maryland, had been retired
to private life at the la.-.t election after
making wet speeches.
"If I can pay that price to render
some slight service to my country,"
Tydings declared, "at least I will not
l>e running with the crowd just to get
re-elected."
The Maryland wet and the lowa
dry had heen exchanging pointed re
marks for more than an hour in the
first prohibition debate in the Senate
in weeks, after Tydings undertook—
with displays of a series of charts
bearing tables of statistics —to drive
what he termed "the bunk" out of
prohibition.
The demonstration from the crowd
ed galleries startled the meager mem
bership on the floor, ended the heck- j
ling by Brookhart, and brought a
warning from the presiding officer
that any other such outbreak would
result in the clearing of the galleries.
Challenging the Tydings figures on
the effect of the prohibition law, Sen
ator Brookhart contended that sta- j
tistics showing increases in drunken- j
iless were faulty because they included !
figures for cities which were dry be- i
fore national prohibition went into cf- I
kcl.
