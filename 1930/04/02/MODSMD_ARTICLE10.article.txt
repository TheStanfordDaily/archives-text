characteristics, apparently caused orig
inally by the drinking of poisoned liq
uor, tonight had placed about seven
victims in nearby hospitals, with prob
ably as many more receiving treatment
in their homes and farms hereabouts
in the hill country.
Dr. W. 11. Effrtrec, community phy
sician, who was called upon to cope
with the epidemic, was seeking to de
termine definitely the cause of the ill
ness. whether the disease was com
municable, and how much the "stuff"
cost. It is said to be had in large
quantities.
The greater part of the victims lost
the use of their feet and legs, and
most of Ihem told Dr. Kffrtrcc that
their illness had followed the drink
ing Di alcoholic liquor. Several vic
tim:-,, however, including a chiropodist,
felt that it was "athlete's foot" which
was the cause of their complaint.
