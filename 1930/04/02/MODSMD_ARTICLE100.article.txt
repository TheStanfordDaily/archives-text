SAN FRANCISCO. Anril 1. (/}>)â€”
Three hundred and sixty-three days
advance notice of an earthquake
went unheeded just a quarter of a
century ago. It got only a tiny
jnention in Ihe local press although
the prediction had the weight of
scientists at the University of Cali
fornia behind it.
But larger type was used a year
later to give to the world word that
the prophecy had been fulfilled and
that in the earth disturbance and
conflagration which swept San
Francisco more than 500 lives were
lost and property damage of $400,-
000,000 done.
In the University bulletin issued
April 8, 1005. based on the research
work of Professor Vance C. Os
inont, if was stated that the San
Francisco bay region was subsiding
at an appreciable rate, there being
proofs in evidence that disclosed a
submergence of four feet in "very
recent times."
The deductions were that "gradu
ally this region will sink, so that
the future may hold in store for
dwellers in the bay region a series
of experiences of more than pass
ing interest."
The series began at 5:13 a.m.,
April 6, 1906, and when the dozen
of shocks had ended,, downtown
San Francisco was in ruins.
