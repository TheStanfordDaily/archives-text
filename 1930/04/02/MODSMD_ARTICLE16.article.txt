LONDON, April 1 (A i ). —Japan lias joined thp American-Jiritisli cou
sortum for naval disarmament, thereby assuring the basic success of the
London conference with at least a three-power treaty.
A five-power agreement still hangs in the balance. Both Foreign Min
ister Briand of France and Prime Minister Mac Donald of Great Britain said
<♦-tonight that the gulf was narrowing

rapidly on the security issue. But even
with that chasm bridged, an old terror
-Franco-Italian parity—still threat
ens difficulties.
The Japanese government's favor
able reply to participation in a five
year limitation program proposed by
the United States and Great Britain
was received by the Japanese delega
tion early this afternoon. A formal
answer to Secretary Stimson and
Prime Minister Mac Donald i.i ex
pected tomorrow morning.
Important reservations will be at
j tached to the Japanese acceptance, but
I they affect the principles of national
naval ratios rather than the limitation
of five-year construction programs,
j Stimson and Mac Donald are highly
I pleased because the long weeks of
delicate negotiations with Tokyo fi
nally are ready to be crowned with
success, and in their elation they re
doubled their efforts to extend the
three-power understanding to an all
j embracing live-power agreement.
