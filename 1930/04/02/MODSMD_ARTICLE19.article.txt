## 
### 
"II is niy hope that at some fu
tlire lime there will he created a
chair of religion at Stanford where
the interest of God may he secu
larized —a chair dissociated from
piety, dissociated from the church,
from any organizations of the
church." Such was the statement
made last, night by I)r. G. A. Johns
ton Ross, acting chaplain of tin;
University, in his address on"The
Christian Preface to Morals," the
first of the tenth series of Wei:l
Memorial Lectures.
"If ignorance of the origins of
Christianity is prevalent, how can
il persevere? Why does not the uni
versity treat the beginnings of
Christianity as a secular subject,
treat it as mechanics or the his
tory of Rome. Jesus is not, taught
as a secular being," Dr. Koss con
tinued. "nor Paul as a founder of
Western civilization, greater than
Alexander."
Youth finds it exceedingly hard
to grasp the set of elements In the

background of Christianity. It is
skeptical," he said, "of the value
and truth of history, and upon his
tory is based the real difference be
tween religion and Christianity."
"I believe that youth will, and
indeed is already beginning to re
turn to a belief in God, a belief
in the works and words of Jesus,"
Dr. Ross stated.
"In discussing Christianity as a
preface to morals, creation, and
evolution appear as but a polished
sheen on ignorance, We feel his
mind in ours, his love becomes our
encouragement, he controls all
from within, becomes our hope,
our judgment, our salvation. We
cannot name it, this power, we
only know that we are undergirt
with il in a difficult and unstable
world."
Tonight Dr. Ross will continue
his series of lectures, speaking on
"Christian Conduct" at 7:30 in the
Assembly Hall. The lectures are
open to the public.
