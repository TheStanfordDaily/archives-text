of Stanford University, will bo re
membered as at one time a resi
dent. of Irvington, during the period
lliat he was professor of Biology

lures of Jordan carrying one of his
babies on one shoulder and on the

making his way down the old board
walk to the college. In tliose days
he was a reasonably good teacher
and a mighty line baseball player."
Professor Jordan's comment on

hear my ability vouched for. There
arc some around here who seem to
think I never could play baseball."
Asked il lie was not at one time a
high-jumper, he admitted that he
was, "We weren't so particular in
those days," he said, "but I jumped
somewhere around live feet and a
half something like that."
