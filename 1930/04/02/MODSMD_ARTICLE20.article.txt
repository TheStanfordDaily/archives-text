Many New Players
The cast is remarkable as featur
ing players most of whom are new
to the Stanford stage. Catherine
Crary, who plays Gerda, a girl of
IS, has a charming, impudent part
and works together with her broth
er, Sholto, played by Ruhland Isaly,
whose young ideas form a large
part <>l the play. The two are sure
to bring down the bouse with their
intriguing antics, and their actions
in the high society are most un
sophisticated.
Catherine Crary was seen in one
of the features of the last Football
Gaieties, but both Crary and Isaly
will make their debut since neither
have played before the campus in
box-office plays before.
Douglas Gregg will play the role
of George Brent, the master of the
house and the father of two chil
dren, a part calling for a subtle
and suave personality. Gregg is
well-known to campus audiences,
having previously played in "Ivory
Door," "Moving On," "Granite," and
Big Game Gaieties.
Tully as "Ciccly"
Playing Cicely, George Brent's
second wife, Dorothy Tully will
portray an adventurous, attractive
woman, half delighted and half
frightened at her own indiscretions
(which worry her husband for fear
they will involve him in a scandal
which would reflect on him). She
is known to the campus for her
work in "The Adding Machine," in
which she played the character
part, of a woman of the streets.
Rodney Masters will lit/portrayed
by Edwin Gerhardt, who is also
new to the campus stage. Masters
is a rather forward amorous man
who would run away with almost
anyone's wife if she was to his lik
ing. He attempts an intrigue with
Cicely.
Julia Cragworthy, who likes what
she likes and talks when she
pleases, is to be played by Emme
line Nollen, another newcomer to
the stage. Julia believes in acting
"natural."
An older Englishman, Eustace;
Babbit, pays some attention to
such things as families and their
trees â€”knows lots of people and
their habits. Gaillard Fryer will
piav the part.
Two English Characters
Hubert Chain is to play Claud
Eccles, an Englishman in love with
Priscilla, who is an attractive Eng
lish sportswoman who lapses at
times into a decided baby talk.
Betty Davidson is lo play Priscilla.
Sibyl Blaitli, to be portrayed by
Margery Thomas, is a. young wo
man fond of hunting, tea, dancing,
and gossip.
Hiram J. Walkin is lo he por
trayed by Ray Lindman who is
known as Jordan in "Granite."
The two character parts will be
played by Catherine Musante as
the Italian maid, and Robert Nich
ols the butler. Catherine Musante
was seen in "The Mistress of the
inn."
The play will be given as an
entertainment for University Day
as well as a regular play and will
be the only one given this quarter,
besides the Junior Opera. It will
also be given on the day of the
California-Stanford track meet.
