# COMMON SENSE AND TEXTBOOKS
## 
### 
With llit* beginning of each new quarter one wonders if some
-.yslem could not be devised by < iod or Man whereby a semblance
of co-ordination might be effected between faculty members and
I lie Stan ford I >ookst< ire.
Kadi quarter professors mount the platform, look into a sea
of eager upturned faces, and blandly order their students to buv
this text or that one. This text or that one is vitally necessary for
a proper appreciation of the course, they say. Assignments are
made; warning is issued that an examination will be held over the
reading for the first week.
I'roinptly these seekers after knowledge race to ihe Uookstore.
\fter waiting in line for the small matter of 30 minutes or so
they learn that the required text has been sold out —was sold out,
probably, after the first half-dozen students called. An order is
placed for the necessary book. After periods ranging from four
days to three weeks, the thing arrives, and the student begins his
studies.
Whether Mookstwrc officials and instructors realize the fact or
not, it is somewhat difficult to properly study for a course without
a textbook—especially when the library contains two which are for
tlie use of a class of seventy-five. More than one hapless individual,
not possessed with the wings of the wind, has failed to arrive at
the. Ilookstore on time, and has suffered for his lack of speed by
failing a course—even "rolling" out of school.
The awkward thing about the situation is that apparently nothing
can be done about it. Xaturally, no professor has sufficient clnir
voynnce to accurately foretell just how large his class will be; and
naturally the I'ookstore cannot be expected to stock up on huge
quantities of books for which there may be no call.
lint the problem would be answered, in a measure, if faculty
members would make a real effort to see that the I'ookstore has a
reasonable stock before the assignment is made. And it would be
answered further if professors, upon finding that it is impossible
for their students to secure the required texts, would make some
allowance for that fact, and not expect the obviously impossible
feat of thoroughly knowing the contents of a book which is impos
sible to secure.
