# U.C. GUARDS STANFORD'S AXE
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening hundreds of ("niversity of California stu
dents will frenziedlv parade in the (ireek Theatre when ihe Stanford
Axe is unveiled at the rally for the Bear crew.
In the early 1900's some California rooters managed to kidnap
lite huge Stanford axe from its guardians. Since that time, Stan
fordites have been able to view Ihe fabled weapon only by attending
the rallies at Berkeley.
Numerous attempts, to rescue the instrument have gone for
naught. Despite their successful retention of ihe axe, the Califor
nians are losing confidence in their ability to retain possession.
When it is taken from the vaults of a I'erkelev bank Thursday, it
will be conveyed to the Creek Theatre in an armored car with a
Irong freshman convoy, instead of the usual guard.
"We can naturally expect some designs on the part of Stanford
students, but they will no doubt prove as ineffectual as lhcy have
in the past years if freshmen do not relax their vigilance during
transportation," is the lastest pronunciamento from officials in
charge.
Stanford students might raid the procession and recover the axe,
but those participating would not receive the ovation from their
schoolmates that might be expected. Stanford has progressed with
out ihe axe for so many years that its return probably would not
mean much.
