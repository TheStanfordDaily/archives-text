ROF J E'S END—At Curran Theatre,
San Francisco.
If genuinely enthusiastic ap
plause from the audience counts for
anything, "Rope's End," the drama
now playing at t lie Curran Theatre,
promises a long run. With the ex-
I eeption of a very few slow moments
in the lirst act, this production
holds the spectator's interest from
i start to finish.
The play is well-written and very
ably acted. Nothing more could be
asked of Noel Madison, the star,
and Hugh Huntley and Ktlgar Bar
i rier did exceptionally good pieces
J ol work. Hui for that matter tin;
: whole cast was excellent.
i Hope's End is advertised as a
j "thriller." It could hardly be called
j that, but it. does offer no small
i amount of tense drama. The reac
tions of tlie various characters to
j the situations presented are realis
j tic and keep the interest of the
audience at a high pitch. A "perfect
crime" lias been committed. The
audience knows who the murderers
jure and why they killed from the
i lirst lines spoken. So the drama is
I entirely concerned with the grue-
I someness of the supper given by
j the murderers as part of their plan,
and the means by which their guilt
i is discovered.
i All in all, "Hope's End" is an ex
cellent psychological drama.

PARIS BOUND—At the Erlanger's
Columbia, San Francisco.
Madge Kennedy is an utDrly
; charming woman as well as a con
summate actress in "Paris Bound."
The play itself, with its soph'islica
i tion, its brilliance, its delicacy, is
; an excellent vehicle for Madge Ken
j nedy's abilities, and she uses the
{opportunities afforded in it to the
fullest.
Marriage and love, from the mod
! ern point of view, against a shift
i ing background of idealism and
cynicism is the theme of the play.
| The first act shows a young man
! and woman on the day of their
' wedding, romantically playing with
j those modern stock phrases of free
i dom and tolerance in marriage. The
I last act reveals this marriage ap
parently wrecked—and loyalty, de
j cency, and faithfulness are the by
j words used bitterly by the wife,
i who, according to her father-in-law,
wise with the disillusioned wisdom
I that came with a similar experi
ence —has become a vain and l'ool
, ish woman, deliberately blind to
' the difference between love and
mere physical attraction.
"Sex takes a very high and dis
; honorable place among the other
forms of intoxication —but it. is not
i everything," declares this father
j in-law.
Madge Kennedy plays the part
ot the young wife, Mary Hutton,
j giving si portrayal that, is at the
i same time sophisticated, appealing,
lovely. Her voice is clear, and
' sweet, with delicate and poignant
inflections, which allow her to make
her smallest line significant. Among
the supporting cast, Richie Ling
i is most notable, although William
! Har.ley, Miss Kennedy's lead

' ing man, Barbara Hastings, and
Jo Wallace give exceptionally skill
ful performance**.
The smoolliness anil finish in tlie
producton of the play is a real joy
; to witness in itself. There is ap
parently not a (tingle vulnerable
point; (he settings are charming;
l the entrances are effective (parti
cularly those of Madge Kennedy,
which are real works of art), and
there is no lag in the interest. In
a word, "Paris Bound" is one of
those rare plays where genuine
depth of plot is just sufficiently
disguised under smart dialogue and
"modernity" to achieve a really fine
balance. —M. L. It.
YOU CAN ESCAPE. By Edward H.
Smith. MacMillan, New York.
1929. At the Stanford Book
store.
Ever since Orestes and Iphigenia
made their escape from Aulis, and
Theseus unraveled the labyrinth,
the world has admired :in escaper
"as a symbol of breaking his own
ineluctable bondage, his vassalage
j to life and dealh."
i The tradition of elusive rogues
has come down through history un
broken. We recall Casanova and
Cellini. And perhaps Napoleon's
escape from exile is the most, stir
ring incident of his entire career.
There is a small library of "es
cape literature." Must of it. deals,
however, with the non-criminal.
"You Can Escape" is a modern col
lection of modern escapes. It plots
the best ways in which desperate
men have recently escaped from
the worst places.
The only conclusion to be drawn
from the book is that "You Can
Escape" from any prison on earth.
And the Inw of escape is this:
Where there is a will, there is a
way.
There is also an ideal escaper. i
Nothing daunts him. He is an ego-!
list and an optimist. Obstacles
make no impression upon him. He
disarms watchfulness l>y breaking
no rules and making no blunders. 1
Most important of all he is able to
arrange for his safety after his
escape. This tie does through
money and friends. With both of
these escape is not. impossible.
Finally through constant dili
gence the weak spot in the walls
of routine is discovered. Then be'
waits for night and storm to con- I
ceal liis break for liberty which he j
must, preserve by hiding, often for
the rest, of his life.
Man's desire for freedom must
be taken as a by-product of his in
stinct for self-preservation. To get
out of prison, the prisoner will en
dure everything and dare anything.
There seems to be no limit to his
capacity. No prison can hold him.
"You Can Escape" makes no
claim to literary distinction. It j
claims to be nothing more than "a j
series of stories, thrilling, interest- j
ing, and of considerable criminolo
gical and penological significance."
And as a practical handbook i'or
the prospective escaper it would
seem excellent. A volume in every
penitentiary might relieve the
prison congestion problem.
