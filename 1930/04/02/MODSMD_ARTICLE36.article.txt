## REFLECTION ON AN URBAN SCENE 
### Philip Space 
, The day was fair
j In Union Square.
Haze filled the
j San Franoisco air.
' On four sides lay
The buildings gray.
The grass was green
Across the way.
The benches low
I Were placed— just, so —
And lined the pathways
Row l>y row.
A motley crowd
Sat tired —or bowed.
A small sign said:
"No Dogs Allowed."
1 To dignify
I The scene, a high
And solemn column
Pierced the sky.
The living lumps
1 Who crouched iri clumps
Did not much care what might br
' Trumps.
Vet ilint most dull

A beauty
i linden iahie.
| Rut few were buoyed
: Or overjoyed,
For most of them were
Unemployed.
A few waxed hot
' Concerning what
Was what in news
; And what was not.
; A few told bales
1 Of wornout. tales.
A few attended
To t heir nails.
A small child ran a
' Way from Anna.
A fa I man peeled
A large banana.

I
And some In bide
The time, relied
On papers that were

And one, instead
Of reading led
The lit I If; sparrows
