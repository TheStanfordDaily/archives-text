# CODE ENFORCEMENT NEEDS SUPPORT OF STUDENTS-COTTRELL

### Leonard Kullmann 
"1 believe thoroughly in Hip
Honor Code if the students have
courage enough to enforce it," Pro
fessor Edwin A. Cottrell declared
yesterday in an interview for the
Daily. "However, no such code will
work if the students regard it as
"ungentlemanly" to report the vio
lations of the Honor System which
come to their attention.
"In tlie course of my experiences
at Stanford," Cottrell continued, "I
have seen attempts to secure exam
ination papers before a test; we
likewise have had ten books stolen
from the Political Science Library;
and there have been several cases
of direct cribbing, word for word,
from other papers and from the.
textbooks during the course .of an
examination.
"Such violations of the code of
honor would not have been pos
sible had the students co-operated
in a. whole-hearted fashion in an
attempt lo eliminate such proceed
ings from their midst," Cottrell
stated. "In the final analysis, tin*
enforcement of the honor code
rests upon the shoulders of the
students."
The proposal to straddle the
question of keeping the present
system by providing for the op
tional use of proctors will not help,
but will instead break down the
honor code entirely, Cottrell be
lieves.
"i believe in a code of honor for
the students, and I believe it. will
work," Cottrell concluded, "but il
will work only when the students
cease "winking" at I lie violations
of the agreement."
