# EFFICIENCY IN INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION CAUSES UNEMPLOYMENTâ€”REYNOLDS
## 
### Jack Jernegan 
Increased efficiency in industrial
i production is the cause of the pres
j ent unemployment situation in the
United States. Business is taking
seriously the idea of personnel im
provement for efficiency and the
result is an army of unemployed.
Such was the statement made by
i ('. N. Reynolds, associate professor
of sociology, in commenting upon
the problem of idle workers, which
was brought sharply into notice by
the nation-wide unemployment
demonstrations recently.
"The present situation is differ
ent from all previous unemploy
ment troubles because it is asso
ciated with increased production,"
Professor Reynolds said. "Labor
saving research lias reduced the
size of the personnel in industries,
and the curve of production has
| gone up while the curve of unem-
I ployment has gone down."
The whole thing is a new phase
of the Industrial Revolution, Pro
fessor Reynolds believes. Man
power is being refined and speeded
up.
"In manufacturing industries
there is an unusual percentage of
men over 40 in the ranks of the
unemployed," he declared. "This is
the result of the speeding-up pro
cess which demands younger men.
The older men. who are honestly
trying to support their families, arc
especially bitter with regard to the
situation."
According to Professor Reynolds
there are two lines which may be
followed to remedy conditions. One
I is to continue as President Hoover
| is now doing, accepting the present
| American system, as the best we
| know of, and to try to patch it up,
I stabilizing production and employ
ment. The other line is the Social
istic one on the order of the Rus
sian experiment. He considers our

own system to be safer and more
likely to succeed.
"I doubt if there will bo any re
sults from agitation through demon
strations. It may tend to stimulate
legislators a little, but that is all,"
the sociologist said with regard to
the parades and mass meetings at
the demonstrations recently. "The
parades are caused partly by hon
est discontent at a condition which
has endured for several years and
partly are the result of agitation,
principally Communistic. Commun
ism acts as a catalyzing agent."
