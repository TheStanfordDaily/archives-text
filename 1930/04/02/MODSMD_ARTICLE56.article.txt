Dr. Otto Stern, who is to a
lecture at 4 o'clock this afternoon in
room 370 in the physics building, is
professor of physical chemistry and
director of the Physico-C'hemical In

The talk will be open to the public
and anyone interested is invited.
Dr. Stern will speak on the dellcc

on which subject he is an authority.
In his research work he has proved
that isolated atoms have magnetic
properties. This fact was suggested by
previous studies of atomic structure.
