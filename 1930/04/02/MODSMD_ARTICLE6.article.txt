# "WITCH DOCTOR" IS POTENTIAL FACTOR IN LIVES OF HAITIENS

### 
WASHINGTON - . April I (A').— \
land where the witch doctor's mumbo
jumbo is a potent national force waits
the inquiring minds of President Hoo
ver's commission to suggest future re
lations with llaiti.
Descended from African slaves who
revolted against their French masters
and swept the island free of all white
men, the Haitiens have drifted in two
directions.
The more ambitious have become the
aristocratic ruling ruling class of the
seaport cities. The peasantry has
drifted inland, fringed on the south by
primitive hill folk. The result has
been the establishment of a caste sys
tem as severe as any of the middle
ages.
I he black republic is old among the
countries of the world. Columbus
landed there and pined in jail in Santo
Domingo. Pizarro and Cortes swag
gered in the streets before they set
out to carve new empires.
Under a virtual American protecto
rate since 1 15, the island has been
comparatively peaceful: down through
the centuries it had splashed the pages
of history with bizarre reading. To
ward the close of the eighteenth cen
tury, black voodoo rites were revived.
I he republic was founded in I'JO.?,
and revolution followed revolution
until the events which brought about
the landing of American marines in
1015.
President Louis Borno, past. 50, a
graduate of the University of Paris,
now heads the llaitien government.
He long has been in public affairs of
the island.
The Hoover commission is to deter
mine when and how the United States
shall withdraw from the island.
Headed by W. Cameron Forbes of
