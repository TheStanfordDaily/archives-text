# FROSH TRACKSTERS PREPARE FOR TILT WITH PREP STARS
## Card Yearlings Expected To Score Triumph Saturday 
### 
Showing possibility of setting a new
i high-point score record against the
California freshmen in the dual meet
j set for later in this month, the Stan
j ford yearling track and field team has
I buckled down to work in preparation
| for the meet with the San Francisco
11 i?4h School All-Stars which will be
held here Saturday. Judging by the
times and distances hung up by the
prep school stars in their elimination
heats held Inst week, the frosh should
have little difficulty .in turning back
j the All-Stars.
| Presenting remarkable strength in
i the 4-40, B<SO, shot put, discus throw,
and high jump, with better than aver
age performers in the other events,
the present freshman squad is expect
ed to furnish many stars for the var
sity next season, and should find few
obstacles in the way of an undefeated
record for the present season.
Javelin Weak
With the eligibility of Dunn, newly
discovered spear-tosScr, a doubtful
matter, coupled with the fact that the
Blue and Gold babes boast of two
expert javelin tosscrs having already
thrown the old Roman weapon better
than 180 feet, at present the javelin
j appears to be the sole weakness of the
| first-year team. In Bates, husky ceu
.( ter of the yearling football team, how
lever, may lie the solution to the prob-
I leni of securing points in this event,
ill* this lad with the titian locks can
Hing a javelin as well as he spiraled
a football last fall, all will be well.
In the person of Don Backman,
j frosh high - jumper, the answer to
j Dink's prayer for another king of the
| jumping pit may be answered. Black
mail two weeks ago won the high jump
lin the meet with the St. Ignatius
i freshmen with a leap of 6 feet :i 4 inch,
'and in the interclass struggle of yes
'j terday bested the varsity men with
I a.similar performance. Such pcrform
j anccs stamp this young man as a ris
} ing track star. . . .
With sure point-winners in the per
! sons of Kastman in the 220 and 440,
Thorny Rogers in the quarter, La
| Borde and (irey in the weights, Her
| bert in the hurdles, kullen wider and
I Naylon in the half-mile, and Hunter

in the mile, the members of the year
ling team will hear watching in the
future.

Javelin Weak
With the eligibility of Dunn, newly

matter, coupled with the fact that the
Blue and Gold babes boast of two
expert javelin tosscrs having already
thrown the old Roman weapon better

.( ter of the yearling football team, how

Hing a javelin as well as he spiraled
a football last fall, all will be well.
