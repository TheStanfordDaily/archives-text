# U.C. TRACKSTERS ENTRAIN TONIGHT FOR WASHINGTON
## Christie Unsettled Over Which Men to Take Against U.W. 
### 
BERKELEY, April !. (TP)—'Twen
ty-two track and field athletes,
Ihree managers, Coach Walter
Christie, ;ind Charles Volz, trainer,
will leave the University of Cali
fornia tonight 011 the "Cascade" for
Seattle to meet the University of
Washington team on their indoor
track Saturday evening. They will
arrive tomorrow evening at. !t:4* r »
o'clock, stopping at, the Olynipia
Hotel.
The fact that his squad is closely
limited has given Coach Christie
furiously to think, and to date he
lias been unable to determine just
who will make the trip north. Point
winners were so far and few be
tween against the Trojans that they
stand out in bold relief above the
rest, of the squad and hence will
probably be automatically booked
for the train ride. But how to se
lect the rest of the squad without
leaving possible dark horses at.
home is the question about which
Christie's problem revolves.
The pole vault, results were the
surprise of last week's debacle,
with Hill Koblick and Everett
Scrivner both sluit out in favor of
a libber, lanky vaulter named
George Pool who wasn't figured at
all but who took a third place at
13 feet. Neither of the other two
Bears has cleared much better than
12 feet six inches. Pool may have
•
been jumping 'way over his head,
figuratively as well as literally, and
may not repeat again this season.
Captain AI Pogolotti's time in the
hurdles was a rift in the gloom for
Bear followers. "Pogy" did the high
sticks in 14 7-10, which is probably
the best time of the season any
where in the country—one-tenth of
a second slower than the record. Tn
the lows he was hot on the heels
of Carls of the Trojans, who was
clocked at 23 0-10.
Mossman in the mile, Henderron
in the two-mile, Zelman in the SBO,
Sparks in the sprints, Deßerry in
the weights, Churchill and Curtice
in the javelin, Bias in the broad
jump, and Rice in the high jump—
these are the chief Bear prospects
as revealed by Saturday's meet.

as revealed by Saturday's meet.
BERKELEY, April !. (TP)—'Twen
ty-two track and field athletes,
Ihree managers, Coach Walter
Christie, ;ind Charles Volz, trainer,
will leave the University of Cali
fornia tonight 011 the "Cascade" for
Seattle to meet the University of
Washington team on their indoor
track Saturday evening. They will
arrive tomorrow evening at. !t:4* r »
o'clock, stopping at, the Olynipia
Hotel.
The fact that his squad is closely
limited has given Coach Christie
furiously to think, and to date he
lias been unable to determine just
who will make the trip north. Point
winners were so far and few be
tween against the Trojans that they
stand out in bold relief above the
rest, of the squad and hence will
probably be automatically booked
for the train ride. But how to se
lect the rest of the squad without
leaving possible dark horses at.
home is the question about which
Christie's problem revolves.
The pole vault, results were the
surprise of last week's debacle,
with Hill Koblick and Everett
Scrivner both sluit out in favor of
a libber, lanky vaulter named
George Pool who wasn't figured at
all but who took a third place at
13 feet. Neither of the other two
Bears has cleared much better than
12 feet six inches. Pool may have
•
been jumping 'way over his head,
figuratively as well as literally, and
may not repeat again this season.
Captain AI Pogolotti's time in the
hurdles was a rift in the gloom for
Bear followers. "Pogy" did the high
sticks in 14 7-10, which is probably
the best time of the season any
where in the country—one-tenth of
a second slower than the record. Tn
the lows he was hot on the heels
of Carls of the Trojans, who was
clocked at 23 0-10.
Mossman in the mile, Henderron
in the two-mile, Zelman in the SBO,
Sparks in the sprints, Deßerry in
the weights, Churchill and Curtice
in the javelin, Bias in the broad
jump, and Rice in the high jump—
these are the chief Bear prospects
as revealed by Saturday's meet.
