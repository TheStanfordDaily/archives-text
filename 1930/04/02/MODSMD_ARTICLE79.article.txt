TROY TRIUMPHANT???
A once-mighty Golden Bear,
beginning to roar like the
grizzly of old that was the ter
ror of the cinderpath reared up
on its hind legs last Saturday
to claw at a powerful Trojan
and received a belt on the
chops that not only knocked it
bowlegged but also gave notice
that Gloomy Dean Cromwell's
charges are absolutely the ne
plus and ultra when it comes
to dual meets during the year
1930.
To use a hackneyed phrase, if
wasn't, so much what the Trojans
dfd as the way they did it. The
score of was bail enough, but
ii was the times that accompanied
tin- tanning of the Bear's hide that
makes April 12 take on a Cardinal
and Gold tinge.
Wykoff's performances, bettering
even time in the dashes, were ex
peeted, but who thought that Sni
der, Troy's second-best javelin
tosser, would throw the spear 1!I7
leei ? Or that. Carls, rated second
to his teammate, Ernie Payne,
would step the low hurdles in 23.9
seconds? Or that the Trojans had
three two-milers who could beat
Or that Halstead would run
4:24 in the mile? Or a lot. of other
things, sucli as a trio of quarter
milers capable of clipping 50 sec
onds in the one-lap event, and a
couple of 24-foot broad-jumpers?
(>h, sure, there had been rumors,
hut up until this year, Troy had a
habit of doing big things on paper
in March and considerably less in
April on t lie field.
Apparently this year is the mil
leninm. Certainly no coach could
hope for a better-balanced bunch of
performers than the one that took
thirteen out of fifteen first places
and tied for another against the
Hears. The first place they lost was
in the high hurdles, where Captain
Pogolotti of the Bears just did nose
out Jeddy Welch of the Cromwell
ian clan, and had to run 14 7-10
seconds to do it. The tie resulted
in the high jump, where Van Osdel
of the Trojans, a consistent G-foot
tliree leaper, obviously had an off
day and went out at 5 feet 11
inches. Every other first place went
to U.S.C. with marks and times
calculated to make the head reel.
It does not seem humanly
possible to assemble a bunch
of athletes who could hope to
take the measure of the great
Trojan machine in a dual meet.
The intercollegiates are a dif
ferent matter —but then, April
12 is still in the future and
there's many a slip.
