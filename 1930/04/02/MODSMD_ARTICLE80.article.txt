# Cards To Meet Gaels In Double Header
## BASEBALL TEAMS PLAY ON MORAGA DIAMOND TODAY Stanford Varsity All Set To Go Against Strong St. Mary's Nine 
### 
Straight, from two defeats and two
victories during its tour to the south,
Stanford's baseball varsity took a light
workout today preparatory to a double
header scheduled for this after
noon against *St. Mary's on the Mo
raga diamond. Rain had previously
postponed the two contests between
the Cards and the Gaels, and the two
game date was set now to enable Stan
ford to close the baseball season with
the last of a three-game scries with
California as well as to avoid future
"conflicts.
Saints in Cellar
At present the Saints are fighting
hard with L'.C.L.A. to keep out of the
cellar in the conference standings, tlie
Gaels having won or lost all of their
games but one so far by a one-run
margin. The Moragans' one confer
ence win has been over Santa ( lara
which in turn is the only team which
has yet defeated the league-leading
Trojans, so the Red and Blue tossers
are by no means a weak outfit. Cali
fornia defeated them 4 to 3 and I to
I. .wheezing through the latter game
by two fluke homers on a fenceless
field.
The Redshirts have played once
against the Gaels, a 5 to 4 narrow
squeak played three weeks ago which
the. Cards barely pulled out of the
fire when Ilunken backed up to the
fence and stabbed at Seghetti's fly as
the hall was sailing over the enclosure.
The team appears in fine shape in
spite of the Hollywood environment
during the past week, with only one
casualty, Goodell having broken a
thumb in the first game against U.S.C.
All four of the regular twirlers may
see action today, although Coach
Harry VVolter may be able to scrape
through with only two.
