# WARNER RETURNS TO STANFORD; SPRING FOOTBALL STARTS AT 4 O'CLOCK TODAY
## 
### 
With the return yesterday of
Glenn Scobie "Pop" Warner from
the East, once again will Stanford's
| football mentors assemble the
I Cardinal horde and begin the task
of rebuilding a great football team
'al the first official practice session
I of spring quarter scheduled for 4
o'clock this afternoon.
j Warner returned from Absecon,
i New Jersey, where he had attended
! a meeting of the Football Rules
Committee of the National Collc
j giate Athletic Association, and im
I mediately issued the call for prac
! tice. And next year in addition to
j the usual formidable schedule of
games with Pacific Coast teams
the Old Fox faces contests with
Dartmouth College and the Cni
| versify of Minnesota.
Fourteen vaksity men, half of
them regulars, will be lost through
graduation. Captain "Mush" Mulh-r,
and Johnny Preston, will be miss
ing from the starting lineup at end;
little Walt Heinecke, All-American
center, will be gone from the cen
ter of the line; "Bull" Driscoll
leaves a gap at guard; and Herb
I Fleishhacker, Lud Frontrup, and
Chuck Smalling will be the regu
lars leaving the backfield. in addi
tion there are Steinbeck, Klabau,
| Forster, and Ingram, linesmen',
. Worden, end, and Marks and Crary,

backfield, that will be lost.
Captain Hay Tandy, who returned
to school this quarter following an
operation, will he in his old posi
tion at tackle with iiogue, Thomp
son, Doufo, and Grey fighting for
the other tackle post. "Chang" Art
man will return in the fall and pro
vide still more competition. Hardin,
Dawson, Reiser, and Wilson will
light it out for the guard berths
with a chance of Miller returning
in the fall to see some action.
Perry Taylor seems the logical
choice to play the pivot position
next year although he is busy with
baseball at present. Mar Albertson
and Milligan will provide the neces
sary impetus to Taylor to keep
down the job. Tow-headed Phil
Neill appears a cinch for one of
the flanks with K. Albertson,
Bush, Wittenau, and Craig hot-foot
ing it for the other extremity.
The signal-calling job looks wide
open for some newcomer unless
Warner decides to change a half
into a quarterback. Right now it
looks like a toss-up between Hardy,
Marks, and Targhetta of last year's
freshman team.
Many Halfbacks
As usual, there is a wealth of
halfbacks with liothert and Molla!t
leading the list. It is also rumored
that the flashy Moffatt may call the

plays next fall. Clark, Winnek,
Oaglieri, Itintala, Lambert, Ketron,
|and possibly Afflerbaugh will be on
i hand to lote the ball and block up
| passes.
If Simkins' trick knee heals suf
ficiently, t lie big pass-t lirower will
lie seen and seen plenty on the field
next October at fullback, and there
is always the blond thunderbolt,
Hillman, to plow through) the line
if needed. Then there is Allen,
i Murphy, Baker, and Stevens of the
I yearlings to fall back on.
