# AUSTRIANS DESIRE GERMAN ALLIANCE DECLARES SOKOL
## Tendency Toward Union Is Checked Only by Treaty of 1918 
### Keith Collins 
"Thorn is a strong tendency
among the Austrians to unite with
Germany, but this tendency is
chocked by I lie peace treaty of
I!tl8 which practically forbids the
joining of Austria to Germany."
A. 10. Sokol, assistant in German
instruction at Stanford, made this
statement yesterday to a Daily re
porter.
"This tendency is only natural,"
ho continued, "since at least D")
per cent of the inhabitants of Aus
tria today are Germans. What is
now Austria was really part of the
Holy Roman Umpire of the Ger
man Nation. This can best be un
derstood by a glance into the his
tory of Germany.
"In 180.0, Emperor Francis re
scinded his title as ruler of all of
Germany and confined himself to
the ruling of Austria by becoming
Emperor of that country. Austria
hut also a great number of Slavic
then comprised not only German
and Hungarian people.
"About 1815 the German tribes
tried to reunite and the German
part of Austria was included in
ihe proposed union. Prussia and
Austria stood as the foremost Ger
man countries at t his time, each
trying to gain the chief interest in
the new government. This led to
war between Prusia and Austria in
18151. Prussia won and in 1871 the
German empire was formed under
Prussian rule. The Austrians were
excluded from the new government.
"in 1918 the German part of Aus
tria seceded from the remaining
part in order to join with Germany.
The peace treaty, however, forbade
this union and even forbade their
calling the new country German-
Austria.
"That the Austrians should wish
to unite with the German Republic
is only natural since Germany is
really tlie Austrians' 'own mother
country."
Professor Sokol states that he
will give a course on Austria next
