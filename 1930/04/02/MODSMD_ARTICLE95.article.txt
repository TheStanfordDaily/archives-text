### BY JOE CARROLL 
This is the cii/htli of a series of articles by Joe Carroll on th'unjs to see
antl do around Shin ford uhich no Stanford man or teaman can afford to
miss.

Stanford's favorite charity, the
Stanford Convalescent Home, is
one of the places that should be
visited more often by students of
litis University. Its growth has
been intimately connected with
Stanford and Stanford people. Last
! year the students contributed over
$3200 to its support. This sum kept
three children in the Home for a
year. As there are forty-five chil
dren under the care of the Home,
litis contribution has been helpful,
states Dr. J. P. Mitchell, Registrar,
who is Secretary-Treasurer of the
Stanford Convalescent Home.
Regular visitors' hours are from
to I o'clock on Saturday and Sun
day afternoons. These hours are
lor persons who are visiting the
"children. Visitors to the Home are
welcome at any time. The rest
period is from 1 to o'clock every
afternoon, so the best time to visit
is between •! and -1 o'clock.

There are two ways of going to
I he Home. Alt easy walk is by way
of the Stanford Tomb, taking the
road past the cactus gardens and
across the fields, keeping the old
red dairy barn of the Palo Alio
Stock Farm on the left. Perhaps
the best way, however, is to drive
up the highway to San Franeisquito
Creek and take the road leading
in to I he main entrance of the
I lome.

earthquake, when il was torn al

The Convalescent Home now
handles about 45 children, at a cost
of $40,000. Willi the Babcoek unit
