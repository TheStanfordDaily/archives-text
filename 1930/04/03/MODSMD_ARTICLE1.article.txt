;i 11 >I < 'onl;iii. Saint Mary's twirlers,
;iml the ('aids' inability to hit the
hall lost two games for Stanford's j
baseball varsity at Moraga yester- I
day afternoon when Wolter's men
lost a doubleheader to Slip Madi- |
gan's cohorts.
Looniis was nicked for ten hits I
in the first encounter and the Gaels |
succeeded in shoving seven tallies i
across tlic pan while Noonun do
nated four measly bingles and J
whitewashed the ltedshirts. Taylor]
started the second fracas and after j
the Saints hud garnered seven >
runs by four safeties and numerous I
I
errors and walks, Wolter sent in |
Caddell who lasted out the remain
der of the seven-inning tilt without
further mishap. The Cardinals man
aged to worm three markers from j
Conlan, two in the first canto and j
the last, in a belated seventh-inning j
rally.
Four doubles, all from St. Mary's j
battel's, featured tlie 1 o'clock con
test. The Gaels made one tally in J
the first when Neely drew life on
Johnson's error and scored on a j
passed ball. Two more came In the j
filth when Noonun hit safely and
scored on Stennett's single. Sten- j
nett in turn crossed the platter on ;
a sacrifice fly. The seventh ushered i
in three more when Beasley sin-j
gled and went to third on a sacri-j
lice. Noonun drew life on Kelly's I
error. Beasley scoring. Stennett ■
singled and both tallied on Neely's |
double. The linal marker came in i
the next frame when Gardiner j
walked and scored on Beasiey's
double.
Start Well
Stanford started out well in the j
nightcap, Johnson reaching first on •
a fielder's choice, and Rintala's
homer scored the Card shortstop]
ahead of liini. Madigan's crew re- I
taliated in their half of the inning
with four counters; Neely walked,
Seghetti singled, Perotfi walked,)
and Sinias reached the bags on i
('tilshaw's error, two of the Gaels j
scoring on a wild pitch and an j
error and the others on Beasiey's j
double.
The ltedshirts donated three '
more to the Saint cause in the]
fourth canto, Conlan and Neely j
gelling free tickets and ringing the
bell on Seghetti's triple, who later |
came in on Taylor's bobble. Stan- i
ford made the last run of the day
in tlie seventh when Johnson got j
to (irsl on a fielder's choice, took i
second on Mears' hit, and scored ]
on Neely's boot.
Beasley was the star of the day, !
gleaning two doubles and two sin-j
gles during Hie course of the after- ;
noon out of seven times at bat. I
Kintala was the heavy sticker for]
Stanford, grabbing a single in the :
first till and a homer and single in
the linal game.
The double defeat shoved the j
Cards into a .500 percentage while]
California, by virtue of a fi-2 vie-!
lory over Santa Clara yesterday, j
v.enl into a tie with U.S.C. at the
top of Hie standings. Gaddy, Bronco j
pitcher, was the sensation of the j
contest with four bits out of four, j
