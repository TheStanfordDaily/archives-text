# COSGRAVE WINS PRESIDENCY OF IRISH REPUBLIC
## Ministry Loses Vote After Light Continuous Years Of Public Work Old Age Pensions Cause Fall of Cabinet 
### 
DUBLIN, April 2. (/p) —William
T. Cosgrave was re-elected presi
dent. of the executive council of
l lie Irish Free State tonight. The
vote in the Dail Eireann was 80 to
65 in his favor.
Mr. Cosgrave thus will resume,
after the brief interval of five days,
the important post which lie held
since 1!>22. •
When his ministry fell lasl week
it had achieved a record for long
evity among European cabinets by
virtue of its eight years of con
tinuous service. It lost by only two
votes when that slender majority
of the national legislature favored
extension of old age pensions, a
measure which the president op
posed as constituting too great a
burden on the present finances of
the country. At that time it was
predicted that Cosgrave would be
returned to office.
The president of the Irish Free
State is not a president, in the
American sense but. functions more
like a premier in a parliamentary
government. All ministers are cho
sen by the Dail Eireann, the chief
legislative body, and must be mem
bers of that body and are respons
ible to it.
The first casualty in the ballot
ing was Eamon de Valera whose
election was proposed by Sean T.
O'Kelly, acting leader of the Fianna
Fail party during the absence of
hi.; chief in the United States. He
was supported only by his own
party which mustered 54 votes
while 5)3 deputies ranged them
selves against him.
