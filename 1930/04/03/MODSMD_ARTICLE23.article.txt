## Government, Acting on Counsel's Suggestion, Sends Case to Highest Court of Land Without Waiting For District Body's Consideration 
### 
117 AS lIINCTON, April 2. (/P) To hasten final ending of the protracted
| litigation arising out of the leasing of the naval oil reserves, the
Government today asked the Supreme Court to decide the appeal of
1 Albert 13. Fall from liis conviction on the charge of accepting a bribe
] from Edward L. Dolieny without waiting for the Court of Appeals of
j the District of Columbia to pass on it.
The former Interior Secretary was convicted in 1929 of accepting
$100,000 from Dolieny as an inducement for awarding him a lease on

â™¦the Elk Hills Naval Reserve in
California and contracts for tlie
construction of storage tanks at
Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.
lie appealed recently, asking the
; District of Columbia Court of Ap
-1 peals to set aside the verdict on
! the ground that the evidence
j showed he lacked authority to
! make the contracts and lease; that
i lie had been acquitted of conspir
acy to defraud the United States;
; that the trial judge had improperly
| excused one of the jurors, had im
; properly admitted certain evidence
I offered by the Government, and
j had wrongfully exluded certain evi
| dence lie sought to offer.
To save approximately one year,
j Owen J. Roberts and At lee Pome
| renc, counsel for the Government,
: petitioned the Supreme Court to
i pass on these questions without
\ waiting for the District Court of
J Appeals to do so. They stated to
| day that the case was bound to
i reach the Supreme Court regard
; less of any decision the Court of
J Appeals might make and suggested
! there was no reason for awaiting
I action by the lower courts.
