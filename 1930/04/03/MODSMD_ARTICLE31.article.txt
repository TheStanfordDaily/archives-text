# CHANGE ETERNAL
## 
### 
I he old order changeth.
And so it is on the Daily. The masthead this morning tells its
own story. Leonard I'artlett, one time managing editor, has become
associate editor; led DeMotte, late of the copy desk, now occupies
the post left vacant by llartlett. This shift in personnel came to
pass with the resignation of Kenneth Mansfield, associate editor.
Mansfield's presence will be missed in the Daily office, lie
has been a steady worker and an excellent writer. The Daily
wishes him success in the opportunity which has come his wav,
making necessary his resignation.
Another name will be missed from the masthead today—that
of Stephen Dietrich, sports editor, who was forced to resign because
of impending graduation. Robert Van Ftten will don the toga
dropped by Dietrich.
And farther down the line four new meteorites scintillate in
the Daily firmament—Fritz Coodwin, Jack Jernegan, Stewart
Crawford, and Drew Pallette have risen from the reportorial realm
to copy editorships.
In the same breath Volume 77 laments the passing of the old
and welcomes the coming of the new.
