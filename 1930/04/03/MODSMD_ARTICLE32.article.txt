# THE 						PRESS AND THE SENATE
## 
### 
I lie fifty-year-old privilege accorded newspapermen of going
on the floor of the Senate was recently denied by that body when
ihe rules committee defeated a resolution to allow press association
representatives the right of the floor. The privilege was rescinded
lr.st year when the I'nited I'ress secured for its member newspapers
ihe results of the secret votes upon the confirmation of Customs
Judge Lenroot and former Secretary of the Interior Roy O. West.
The general public probably is not interested in whether news
men have access to the Senate floor. Such interest might be ani
mated, however, if it were realized that it is only by cornering
Senators in their seats or offices that '"inside" information on slight
of hand politics can be learned by the press. It is more than a mere
means of convenience.
\nd one is inclined to shudder a bit upon thinking of just what
our lawmakers might do if the public were not informed, through
the press, of what transpires in the Senatorial sanctum.
