# THE
						COURSE OF EMPIRE

The mythical "man in the street," accustomed to viewing rosy
rheeked beauties in more or less seductive poses on the magazine
rovers at his favorite newsstand, no doubt paused to wonder yes
terday when ihere appeared an emaciated male face below close
( ropped hair on the cover of a national magazine of affairs. A naked
son of "Mother India," Mahatma (iandhi, had made the front page
once more.
' To most Americans he is but an Asiatic fanatic kicking up some
kind of a ruction in a far-away land : but to Englishmen he symbol
izes the potential power of a nationalistic India, a threat to British
industrial well-being which is showing signs of decay.
(iandhi's program of civil disobedience to British rule as a
means of accomplishing a bloodless revolution has three phases:
economic, religious, and political. I lis aims are likewise three: the
downfall of machine industry and the development of fireside manu
facturing, a Christlike relief of the poor which has a slightly com
munistic caste, and an independent India, free from Occidental
cultural and economic domination.
Should all India adopt the Mahatma's scheme, British economic
power in the land would wane, paving the way for native political
control, and one of the keystones in the imperial arch would
crumble.
But India and her bloodless revolutionist are not the only situ
ations causing insomnia in London. There is the rapidly spreading
premonition that England's economic decline since the war is not
temporary, but a tendency which will continue for years. The
recent unsuccessful attempt to found a new political party to spon
sor an Imperial Tariff wall is an indication that Englishmen feel
1 heir commercial supremacy is threatened and that a sense of inse
< uritv is pervading the I 'nited Kingdom.
I nfeeling stockbrokers in London are advising their clients to
sell holdings in British home industries and to invest in the securi
ties of \nierican or colonial enterprises. The reasons given for thus
hifting investments are that the English chaos is permanent and
1 hat the future of American industrialism is based on economic,
climatic, and political advantages not possessed by the British Isles.
Admirers of the British contributions to modern civilization
bewail the signs of decay becoming apparent in the imperial and
commercial arches which span the world. Others, more optimistic,
c laini that England, like Rome, has served western culture well and
is passing on to fresh hands the torch of human progress.
