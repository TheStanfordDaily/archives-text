JUNE MOON—At the Geary'Thea
tre, San Francisco.
"New York's greatest laugh sen
t sal ion!"
"By America's foremost humor*
' ists!"
Even with those publicity mill
i stones tied around its equator,
i "Jun« Moon," comedy-satire of
Ring Lardner and George S. Kaut
i man, playing at the Geary Theatre
in San Francisco, is no disappoint
ment. Maybe the Geary's blurbists
■ didn't leave their typewriters long
J enough to see the show.
I If they hadn't denied themselves
that pleasure perhaps they would
| have played up "June Moon" for
what it, really is a splendid con
j giomeration of broad humor, Soulli
! of-Market sfiphistication, and acid
| satire. >
The show is funny enough, and
l merciless in its irony. "Laugh sen
! sations" aren't t hat.
The plot of "June Moon" isn't
I new, but cloaked under Lardner's
! brilliant dialogue the plot doesn't
| amount to much anyway. It deals
J with the small-town bumpkin—a
i small spark in the General Elec-
I trie's Schenectady .plant who goeji

. 1o the bin city, and lands in the,
! big money of Tin Pan Alley as the j
'author of ga-ga song lyrics. He
I fulls into the toils of a "bad wo
man" (to use his own phrase); is I
j rescued from her clutches in the j
i nick of time, and falls into the !
arms of the sweet and pure country
lass, whose shining goodness had i
; been forgotten in tlu* blinding glare
of the bright lights.
But don't hold the plot against
the show. Vou'd enjoy the thing if >
l it had no plot.
The cast is excellent. Cleve j
I Moore is a priceless hero —half j
jackass and half intensely human — i
I spouting Lardner nonsense. Edith |
Van Cleve, as the disappointed,

character are a wondrous combina
tion of humor and cynicism, tinged 1
