Tlre Editor, Sir: I
Now thai the balmy, sleepy days j
of spring are here, and Lagunita's \
placid waters are lapping - our minds j
to rest it may be out of harmony
to call attention to the altogether
disheartening situation existing in
the observance of the Honor Code.
It is indeed a regrettable question, j
•How much longer are sensible ;
Stanford men and women going to
tolerate the farce which occurs at j
the end of each quarter? Yes, how
much longer Khali we pretend that j
the Honor Code is being respected
as it should be. Reports and cam
pus talk of last, quarter's finals tell
of much open cheating, students
; held back from reporting violations
j because of student disapproval, and
j even professors giving up in dis
| gust. That we have lost our grip
j where our honor holds is evidenced
i by the suggestion that we prop the
! Honor Code with the Proctor Sys
tem. Yet with these facts before
i us a vote would no doubt show
that the majority of students want
I the Code, to some it means a great
'deal. Despite this desire for reten
| tion campus leaders and the ad
j ministration surely have recog
j nized that each quarter is bringing
i new evidence of a growing disre
spect and indifference toward the
j Honor Code.
J We are faced with this situation
j because the average Stanford stu
dent has limited his support of the
Code to a mere observance. There
the cheater is robbing his fellow
students; true he is cheapening
himself, and also true is it that he
is weakening the Code of the stu
dent body; yet let a student move
to report the violator and many
who are presumably supporters of
the Code will immediately brand
the reporter as being a certain spe
cies of poultry—that seemingly all
inclusive campus term of disap
proval. With such a group attitude
can we expect to check th<> gradual

"INCONSISTENCY AND HYPOCRISY"

I weakening of (.lift Code? Group i
! opinion especiaHy amongst stu
dents supercedes any other, regula
tions, and no Honor Code or sys- '
tern can be enforced with an atti- !
tude of indifference and toleration, ;
a toleration which is almost a
quasi-recognition of cheating.
What have we here but the rank- ■
lest inconsistency and hypocrisy?
! We pledge ourselves to uphold the '
I Code with one hand, and with the
other we blind our eyes to those
who are undermining its founda-1
1 1ion. If we see a man robbing an- |
I other we report it, yet. when a stu-:
dent is seen robbing his fellow i
i students of grades by taking unfair '
j advantage we look the other way.
This regrettable situation then j
only can be corrected when those!
of us who want, the Code wake up i
j and help enforce it. as well as oh- i
i serve it. We have heard in the i
past and no doubt will hear in the ;
future of the comparative success
of the Code. Now let us throw
away the rose-colored glasses and j
clearly look at the facts. Sensible,
logically minded Stanford men and
women must realize that until tliey
help to enforce as well as observe
the Honor Code we will continue
to witness the growing indifference
toward its observance and increas
ing toleration of its infraction.
The matter will not' be settled by
resolutions or committee action.
With no attempt at heroics we
must realize that the moral leader
ship must be taken by everyone
who sincerely wishes to see the
Honor Code remain at Stanford.
Violators must be ostracized not by
some f-ouncil but by student opin
ion. Until this opinion understands
that a pledge to support the Code
means not only a pledge to observe
it, but likewise a pledge to enforce
it, we cannot logically expect to
improve the acknowledged unsatis
factory situation.
Sincerely yours, H. E. W.
