A lady friend of ours (Oh yes
we liave, too!) says thin column
hasn't been very funny recently.
Strange—we had noticed Hi" same
thins! Must he a coincidence of
some sort. It's a pretty small world,
alter all.
For instance, we shouldn't say
anything about the Cellar, or refer
to their high prices or their low
coffee. "Everybody knows all about
that already," our "fair reader"
pouts.
Well, all right. Far he it from us
to go around pointing out the ob
vious. And besides, as we have
been told by "faculty folk" a dozen
times if we've been told once, it's
not polite to point.
"Older heads are wisest, my son.
They know what is good for you.
And if you take your Citizenship
and pay your bills maybe you'll be
a Dietician someday, or even an
International President of Rotary."
Gosh! D'ya suppose we could?

—maybe . . . if we moved in the
right circles . . .

j Hut, referring back to our initial
paragraph, did you ever try to be
j funny? That is, outside of the time
j when you were over at Uncle Hen's
; house for a party and you had to
recite "Casey at the Bat."
Well, try it sometime.

Of course, the dramatic publicity
always furnishes something.

Speaking of two of the charac
ters in tlie newest masterpiece, the
pulT says: . . the two are sure
If) bring down tlie house with their
intriguing antics."
Well, we OUGHT to have some
sort fo a vaudeville in the spring.

, And if they bring down the house
maybe we'll £et another one.

Then the folks at our Tuesday
; evening lectures can be more com
| fortable.

i Also: ". . . both will make their
I debut since neither have played
I before the campus in box office
! plays before."
Well, no wonder. There haven't
i BEEN any box office plays for
j awhile.

j dren, a part calling for a subtle

As any father will tell you.

j "... he is well known to cam-
I pus audiences, having played in
I "The Ivory Door," "Granite" . .
Well, that's a sort of fame, all
right.

titled for the present local dra
