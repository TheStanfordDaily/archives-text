OAKLAND, April 2. (IP)â€”Mills
College women want to learn their
lessons from a professor with "vi
tality and force," one who "under
stands his students," a question
naire circulated by the Mills Col
lege Forum revealed. The student
psiper commented that such an
ideal pedagogue was not to be
found on the Mills campus, al
though the ideal embodied charac
teristics of many of the faculty
members.
