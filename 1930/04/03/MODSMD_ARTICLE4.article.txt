# SPEAKER URGES UNSELFISHNESS
## "Love Is Higher Than Law" Says Dr. G.A.J. Ross 
### 
The goal of Christian conduct, ac- |
cording to Dr. (i. A. Johnston Ross, j
is the willing service to one's sell and j
to one's fellow men and the joyous j
translation of Christ's teachings tor]
others. The second of the three lcc- i
tures given this week in the tenth |
series of West Memorial Lectures was |
presented last night in the Little The- j
atre upon the much-pondered question j
of "Christian Conduct."
"Christ, God of ineffable name, as i
the ultimate judge, is found in the j
background of Christian action, and as j
a forceful motivating power. Jle has [
become as symbol," Dr. Ross contin- j
lied, "as sacrament, as agent, and im
planted in the heart of man for all
time.
"The popular mind confuses religion
and morals. It can readily understand j
only life disciplined by standards, by ,
statute piled upon statute. Indeed, this !
whole nation," lie asserted, "seems un- J
able to rise above the idea of obedience !
to law â€”seems unable to grasp the j
power of freedom in Christ, freedom I
from law, and friendship with God. j
free from law.
"Love is higher than statutory force. I
'Love makes laws obsolete, and obc- |
diencc a joy.' This free, happy joy- ]
ousness is greater than obedience to ]
statutes alone. This phase of ethics j
is so Utile understood today."
Dr. Ross will speak tonight in the ;
Little Theatre at 7 :30 o'clock on "The 1
Christian and His Future." The lee- |
ture will be open to the public.
