THOSE I N ELIGI BLES
Old Man Ineligibility may prove
a sharp thorn in the hoped-for rosy
fnt urn dI Stanford's track and Held
squad. For of "Dink" Templeton's
flowering athletes one of the fair
i i buds is definitely unable to
compete, while there are grave
doubts concerning the fate of an
other full-bloomed star.
Out of the somewhat depres
sive atmosphere of Tuesday's
iriterclass meet the work of
two men—Allan Storms and
Les Hables—shone in particu
lar. Storms, a junior college
transfer, at one time attended
U.S.C. for a brief few weeks,
and thus, by dictum of the gods
that be, is ineligible to com
pete until next season. The
still doubtful status of Hables
will be determined at a meet
ing of the Eligibility Commit
tee tomorrow morning. •
Were these two allowed to com
in the (111211 struggle with I T .S.(
pe|e, Stanford's chances of victory
would be greatly enhanced.
The gaping hole left in the ranks
of Cardinal distance men by the
graduation of "Iron Man" Alex Mc-
Kinnon would be nicely filled by
the ineligible Mr. Storms. There
is something peculiarly similar in
the mental attitudes of Mr. Storms
and llie departed Mr. MeKinuoii.
Both have an obsession, amounting
:timost to a mania, for feeling the
little white string stretched across
the end of each race break under
the pressure of their manly chests.
And both are well equipped with
that intestinal fortitude which is
a vital part of the makeup of any
successful trackman.
Storms might well cut a consid
erable swath in the stack of points
the Trojans expect to pile up in
the mile and half-mile events. His
times at 4:30 1-5 and 2:00 2-5
i hulked up in Tuesday's class meet
are not to he sneezed at, particu
larly considering the fact that his
nearest competitor in each race
was solely interested in who took
second place. It seems certain that
Ibis sawed-off running fool Avill
collect a goodly number of points
for Stanford in his senior year.
"Abe" Hables ci/ished the
spotlight during winter quarter
when he won the 100-, 220-,
and 440-yard dashes all on the
same afternoon in the annual
intramural meet. Hables, a
born athlete who would rather
run than eat, at any rate he
does like to run, just about
pushed Morrison over the line
in the interclass 440 event
which was won in the decided
ly speedy time of 48 3-5 sec
onds.
If Hables is declared eligible,
dopesters who Jiave already figured
the coming Stanford-U.S.C. battle
had better sharpen their pencils,
get out another piece of paper, and
start all over again. For the dark
l aired streak should beat out any
thing that Troy can offer in the
(.ne lap dash and add three more
points to the Cardinal total. And
should the final outcome of the
meet upon the relay, the music of
llables' heels on the cinderpath
would blend most melodiously with
ihe efforts of Templeton's baton
passing quartet.
