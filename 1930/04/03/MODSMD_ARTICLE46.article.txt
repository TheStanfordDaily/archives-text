# INTERCLASS BALL TEAMS TANGLE IN TWO GAMES TODAY
## 
### 
Traditional class rivalries will
be in evidence this afternoon when
seniors and juniors will clash on
the varsity diamond in the long-
I delayed interclass baseball playoff.
I while at the same time '31 meets
'33 in another game of the national
pastime on i lie freshman field. Both
tilts are scheduled to begin at 4:15.
No favorites can be named for
today's contests since none of the
squads have had much previous ex
perience playing together. The
freshman nine is made up mostly
of members of the regular yearling
team.
Tomorrow the juniors will cross
bats with tlie sophomores, and on
Monday sophs and seniors will play
the final game of the class series.
