## Babe's Salary Has Mounted From $600 For His First Season To $80,000 For This Year's Playing 
### Feg Murray,'16 
Did you know that $80,000 a year j
is $519.40 a game (if you play in j
every game)? If I knew that I had \
$1(50,000 coming in for the next two j
years, I'd have so much less to j
■worry about! Yea, verily, any bird
who can draw down a salary of j
$739,397 for the years 1914-1931 in-!
elusive for playing a game is pretty i
hot stuff, and must deserve all he
can get. Babe's salary has steadily ;
moved up from $000 a season, with
Baltimore in 1914, to $80,000 with
New York for 1930 and '31. and if j
you think that isn'i pretty fair for
a hoy who first learned his base- j
ball in an orphan asylum, why
you've been brought up on Horatio!
Alger and can't see that "Ruth is
stranger than fiction!"
In spite of the risk of boring
you with statistics, especially at !
