## Mysterious Peter Coutts Was Innocent of Wrongdoing 
### Ruth Ross 
That the mysterious Frenchman
who lived on tht; campus before the
Stanford family came here was not
tin; thief he was rumored to be is
proved in an article in the lllus-
I rated Review for December 1U25,
by Dr. K. M. Pallette. In a recent
article in the Daily, reference was
made to tlie popular belief that
l'eter Coutts had stolen money
from France after the Franco-Prus
sian war and had to flee the coun
try. That lie was not a thief, but
was a political exile, is the state
ment made by his family, who are
attempting to eradicate his former
reputation.
Dr. Pallette, in his article, tells
of Peter Coutts' granddaughter who
now lives in southern California.
She says that the Frenchman's
name was Paulin Caperon, and
that, liis flight from France was
due to liis opposing Napoleon ill
in "La Liberte," a magazine which
lie edited and published. He came
to America, where lie settled on
this campus, called it "Ayershire
Farm," and built gardens, lakes,
and the tower which still stands.
Caperon later returned to France,
where lie died.
li is given as proof of his inno
cence of theft that he had no trou
ble returning to his native country,
and that after he returned he still
had enough money to buy a large
estate.
