### 
SAN FRANCISCO, April 2. (/P)—
Joseph Bennett, citizen of the
world, worked seven long years to
steal little by little —a cement
mixer standing on a vacant lot at
Stanford and Brannan streets, and
all to no avail. A nightwatchman
arrested him recently just as he
was attacking the remains of the
mixer with a hammer and a screw
driver.
"Do you mean to tell me that for
seven years you have been remov
ing that, machine a piece at a
time?" Police Judge Joseph H.
Golden asked him.
"Sure," was the unabashed reply.
"Why didn't you pick on some
thing more in ratio with your pro
fession?" asked the judge.
"Small things please small
minds," Joseph came back.
Whereupon the judge sentenced
Bennett to i! 0 days in the county
jail.
