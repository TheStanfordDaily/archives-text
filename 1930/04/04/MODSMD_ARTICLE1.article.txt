Howard J. Conn of Stanford, who

hold Hie affirmative side of the
question, "Resolved: That the for

"The individual student has been

"Present, grading methods are

ing the system in general. "In the
words of Nicholas Murray Butler,
education is not supposed to teach
a man how to make a living, but
how to live," he continued, in refer

"The system of mass production
decried by the affirmative is not an
evil, and therefore cannot be in

"There is a definite need for

argued Beli, who recently placed

The affirmative arguments were
held invalid by Hell since they did
not consider the educational sys
