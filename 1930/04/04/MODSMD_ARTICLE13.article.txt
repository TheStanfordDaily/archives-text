## Tenth Season of Memorial Lectures Ends 
### 
"Whatever interest Ihe Christian
may have in a future, in either
earth or heaven, rests in the out
come of Hie inner traffic of his
own mind with the God of the in
eftable name," said Dr. (j. A. John
ston Ross in his lecture last night
on "Christian Destiny." The end
of the Christian's yearning for a
life beyond death is in tlie King
(loin of God. In this one phrase is
wrapped up all that could he de
sired a fellowship of man with
man, and man with God.
"We believe in life after death
because, we believe in God," Dr.
Ross continued. "Christ gave his
life, to further (lie fulfillment of.
God's end —he shrank, from dying
as any strong-minded man would,
lie was not spared doubt, even a<
the end, yet beyond all of that was
a deep faith.
"What becomes of I lie ilesh, we
know, and can hardly think about—
flesh and blood cannot inherit the
kingdom of God they are laid
aside for good and all at death
Science," he stated, "even ques
lions whether anything, body or
soul, can remain after death.
"But a belief in God. iu his ever-)
present bounty, based on an ac ,
tual friendship and fellowship with
us holding within it the element
of eternity, can overcome even
t hi*."
In conclusion, Dr. Ross quoted
Dr. Henry Norris Russell: "Wheth
i r we base our belief on the fact
that Jesus believed in God, or on
the fact that Jesus was just, we
have abundant grounds for our own
faith. In Thy hands, Oh Lord, I
commend my spirit."
