## 
### 
California look I.lu! axe away
I'roni Stanford April Jo, JBIW, ai ;i
baseball game hold at Sixteenth
and Folsom Street, Grounds in San
Francisco.
Though now thought of in con
ned ion willi loot hall, the ;i x< • rose
to prominence in the intercollegiate
baseball series with the Univet'Hity
of California during the season of
18!>!>.
Stanford was now out. for re
venge, having lost previous games.
Two days before flic seeond game
;i mammoth rally was held "on the
Farm." This wms Thursday, April
13. The object of the rally was to
arouse, interest in tin! game the
following Saturday. Material was
collected for Ihe largest bonfire
ever built, on the campus, lip to
this time the axe bad been used
symbolically only, in the well
known axe yell which was origi
nated in IS!>6 (Will Irwin. 'HO, is
generally credited ns its author).

Stanford used the yell exclusively
' until tlie Big Game of 1S!)0. which
California won its first football
victory over Stanford, it was now
decided th;il the axe take definite
form. An immense broadaxe was
imported from San Francisco, on
which was painted a red block "S."
The weapon was shaped like a
| huge tomahawk, and had ten-pound,
fifteen-inch blade. It hod been
; dulled hy the several defeats of
the season, but a new start was to
be made. Beside the bonfire in the
centeifield territory of the baseball
diamond, Fjrank English, '01, now
a San Francisco attorney, gave a
| legal and literary recital of the
cau. es <il the dullliffes of the axe.
It was unanimously resolved to
! sharpen the blade in order" to hew
! out a victory the following Satur
day. Billy Erb, yell leader, sharp
ened the axe on a grindstone turned
by English. An effigy of a Untver-
sity of California sympathizer be
ing discovered, the edge must be
tested. The "hoodoo" was brought
before a chopping block in tlie cir
cle of firelight. As the man of straw
knelt before the altar, the red axe
kissed the block, and the culprit's
wooden head fell to earth. Amid
wild cheering the body was thrown
into the bonfire. The tested weapon
was turned over to Captain
Loughced, who made a short speech
i of acceptance. Then followed a war
dance around the huge bonfire, to
the sharp staccato of "Give 'em
the Axe," chanted by hundreds of
wildly cheering voices. The base
ball team, placed in an old wagon,
was pulled by students around the
blazing mass. The rally was a huge
success. The axe was created.
Saturday, April 15, 18!)!t, the sec
j ond baseball game was played
I against the University of Califor
nia. But Stanford fared no better
than it had the week before. The
Bears won again, this time by a
nine-to-seveu score. By virtue of
] this victory California won the
'series tor that year. But of more
lasting significance tlian the loss of the
i baseball championship was the sub
sequent loss of the axe. Three Stan-
I ford men had privately taken the axe
I to the game, at the Sixteenth and Fol
i som Street grounds in San Francisco.
lAt the game the axe was paraded
I around the field to a huge wooden
'block of deep blue, in front of the
' Stanford rooters.
!
After the game, the Stanford stu
j dents quickly scattered, and Billy Frb
I gave the axe to Carl Hayden to carry
i back to Palo Alto. Havdeu and three
i defenders hail no sooner securely
; fastened themselves to the axe when
the enemy surruonded them in large
numbers. Paul Castlethum of Cali
i l'ornia (now a physician in San Fran
i cisco), secured possession of the axe
in the ensuing melee and immediately
'broke away from the scuffle.
The Stanford men gave pursuit, but
it looked as though the Californians
; had a clear field ahead. Among the
! group was Frank Strout, a Stanford
j hurdler, now manager of a San Fran
j cisco mining company. Strout mingled
! unchallenged with the crowd. Think?
| ing he was a California man, Bill
1 Drum passeil the axe over to him.
i At an opportune moment, Strout broke
away from the unsuspecting Califor
nians and ran like a frightened deer,
lie was immediately pursued by the
1 astonished Berkeley collegians, and
i Jimmy Hopper, their great quarter
; back and now a well known novelist,
| brought him down with a beautiful
| flying tackle.
The axe was retaken, and the Berkc
j leyites continued on their way. That
I Saturday night the axe was safely
reposing in a Berkeley hiding place.
For the second time since its
loss a Stanford man, Harry I)ut
ton, had hold of the axe, by asking
, to carry the axe on horseback at
1 the head of a rally procession. But
ton was awaiting the first oppor
| (unity to make his escape, but
j California students crowded around
janil he was forced to give up the
i prize.
Another attempt was made by
Duttou to get the axe from the
; Chi Psi house by pretending he
j was a painter. The fioax was dis
covered. Another raid on the Chi
Psi house by Stanford men fol
lowed, but relations were so
strained that a joint committee de
cided that California should keep
the axe, and since then attempts
to recover it here have been un
successful until last night.

which was painted a red block "S."
The weapon was shaped like a
| huge tomahawk, and had ten-pound,
fifteen-inch blade. It hod been
; dulled hy the several defeats of
the season, but a new start was to
be made. Beside the bonfire in the
centeifield territory of the baseball
diamond, Fjrank English, '01, now
a San Francisco attorney, gave a
| legal and literary recital of the
cau. es <il the dullliffes of the axe.
It was unanimously resolved to
! sharpen the blade in order" to hew
! out a victory the following Satur
day. Billy Erb, yell leader, sharp
ened the axe on a grindstone turned
by English. An effigy of a Untver-
sity of California sympathizer be
ing discovered, the edge must be
tested. The "hoodoo" was brought
before a chopping block in tlie cir
cle of firelight. As the man of straw
knelt before the altar, the red axe
kissed the block, and the culprit's
wooden head fell to earth. Amid
wild cheering the body was thrown
into the bonfire. The tested weapon
was turned over to Captain
Loughced, who made a short speech
i of acceptance. Then followed a war
dance around the huge bonfire, to
the sharp staccato of "Give 'em
the Axe," chanted by hundreds of
wildly cheering voices. The base
ball team, placed in an old wagon,
was pulled by students around the
blazing mass. The rally was a huge
success. The axe was created.
Saturday, April 15, 18!)!t, the sec
j ond baseball game was played
I against the University of Califor
nia. But Stanford fared no better
than it had the week before. The
Bears won again, this time by a
nine-to-seveu score. By virtue of
] this victory California won the
'series tor that year. But of more
lasting significance tlian the loss of the
i baseball championship was the sub
sequent loss of the axe. Three Stan-
I ford men had privately taken the axe
I to the game, at the Sixteenth and Fol
i som Street grounds in San Francisco.
lAt the game the axe was paraded
I around the field to a huge wooden
'block of deep blue, in front of the
' Stanford rooters.
!
After the game, the Stanford stu
j dents quickly scattered, and Billy Frb
I gave the axe to Carl Hayden to carry
i back to Palo Alto. Havdeu and three
i defenders hail no sooner securely
; fastened themselves to the axe when
the enemy surruonded them in large
numbers. Paul Castlethum of Cali
i l'ornia (now a physician in San Fran
i cisco), secured possession of the axe
in the ensuing melee and immediately
'broke away from the scuffle.
The Stanford men gave pursuit, but
it looked as though the Californians
; had a clear field ahead. Among the
! group was Frank Strout, a Stanford
j hurdler, now manager of a San Fran
j cisco mining company. Strout mingled
! unchallenged with the crowd. Think?
| ing he was a California man, Bill
1 Drum passeil the axe over to him.
i At an opportune moment, Strout broke
away from the unsuspecting Califor
nians and ran like a frightened deer,
lie was immediately pursued by the
1 astonished Berkeley collegians, and
i Jimmy Hopper, their great quarter
; back and now a well known novelist,
| brought him down with a beautiful
| flying tackle.
The axe was retaken, and the Berkc
j leyites continued on their way. That
I Saturday night the axe was safely
reposing in a Berkeley hiding place.
For the second time since its
loss a Stanford man, Harry I)ut
ton, had hold of the axe, by asking
, to carry the axe on horseback at
1 the head of a rally procession. But
ton was awaiting the first oppor
| (unity to make his escape, but
j California students crowded around
janil he was forced to give up the
i prize.
Another attempt was made by
Duttou to get the axe from the
; Chi Psi house by pretending he
j was a painter. The fioax was dis
covered. Another raid on the Chi
Psi house by Stanford men fol
lowed, but relations were so
strained that a joint committee de
cided that California should keep
the axe, and since then attempts
to recover it here have been un
successful until last night.
