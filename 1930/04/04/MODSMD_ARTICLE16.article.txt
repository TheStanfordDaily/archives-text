# AGED HIEROGLYPHICS TAKEN FROM DESKS

### 
Years of history have gone down
to tattered shavings during the
last week when the desks of the
Little Theatre were scraped to re
move their accumulated inscrip
tions.
The histrionic meeting place has
been cleaned up generally for fu
ture theatricals and use an a class
room. Not only was the furniture
sandpapered and shellacked but
also light globe replaced, accord
ing to Roy 11. Button, superintend
ent of grounds and buildings.
