! he Stanford Axe is Stanford's own once more.
While the Blue and Gold horde literally slumbered on if
feet last night, a band of twenty intrepid wearers of the
Cardinal whisked the precious implement from under thr
nose of the Berkeleyans in whose possession it had rested
since that fatal day in 1899, and brought it back to the
Stanford campus.

A fake newspaper camcra with
an ink bottle for a lens and a home
made tear bomb were the hooch
pulled over and thrown into the
eyes of the Californians. While
part of the twenty men rode a
guards on the armored car that
was conveying the axe from thr
Greek theatre, scene of the Bear'*
annual axe rally, to the Berkeley
bank where it was kept sequel
- a group of pseudo-photogr?
phers occupied the crowd's atten
tion with their apparent efforts to
get a picture. Then, flash! a tea'
bomb burst in the midst of the
startled Berkeleyans, a surge of
Stanfordites closed around the cus
todian of the axe as he attempted
to step from the car, and the axn
was gone before the Californians
realized what had transpired,
Now the Weapon lies safe in the
vaults of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
The rtews of the steal spread like
a prairie grass blaze. Prom a hun
dred sources in the bay city, the
story came that the axe had bee"
recovered. But not until those
twenty hardy souls made their ap
pearance on the campus and led a
mass of shouting, cheering Star
fordites in a triumphant parade
past Row and Hall was it accepted
Prom the newspaper office o f
the Qally Californian last
came congratulations on there
covery of the axe and the detail*' l
story of how it was accomp! ished
Following is the order of events ir«
the Cardinal triumph and the Ca! 1
fornia catastrophe.
The axe was taken from the Firs'
Berkeley Branch of the America 1
Trust Company at approximately
seven o'clock last night. According
to bank officials, a receipt for thr
axe had previously been give"
them, supposedly by its outgoing
custodian. Merely as a courtesy to
the Californians, an armored car
was loaned to them by the bank. ;
The axe was taken to the rally,
surrounded by the usual freshman
guard.
At the rally, Norman Horner, '31, !
and varsity baseball pitcher, was;
named new custodian of the axe, I
which was put into the armored (
car while the rest of the rally pro- ;
gram went on.
On the return to the bank, the |
car started so quickly that the en
tire freshman convoy was unable
to keep up with it. It reached the
bank with only a small guard, and
backed up to the curb next to an- j
other car containing, to all appear- |
ances, a group of news photogra- j
phers trying for a picture. The en- j
tire proceeding was held up while J
the fake picture was snapped, the
delay allowing the Stanford men
to get to their previously assigned i
positions. As Horner, axe in hand,
stepped out of the car, an arm i
went around his neck, dragged him
back, and while a tear bomb, sud
denly thrown, scattered the crowd j
in fear, the axe was torn forcibly
from him.
A shout by one of the Stanford
men drew the attention of the j
crowd, who, thinking he had the
axe. surrounded him while the men j
with the axe made a slick getaway.
At midnight, reports had it that
fifteen carloads of California stu
dents had left Berkeley, Stanford i
bound.
