# THE 						ANNUAL FRATERNITY TEST
## 
### 
\\ ednesday noun denizens of Fncina will make their annual trek
beneath the arching elms along Stanford's most historic thorough
fare, Lasuen, to those venerable dwellings with various combina
tions (if Greek characters upon their doors.
And when that trek begins Stanford's fraternities and fraternity
government will be subjected again to the annual test of rushing—•
a test which they failed dismally last spring.
Illegal rushing is bad enough at any time in the course of human
events, but during that formal period when fraternity man and
yearling nugget are supposed to meet under well-regulated auspices,
illegal rushing is even less tolerable.
< )ne of the chief aims of those who first nurtured the idea of
Stanford's deferred rushing was to relieve the frosh of the emo
tional wear and tear that goes with high-pressure rushing. I "or
that reason it was arranged that entertainment of the first-year
men was to be carried on only under prescribed conditions.
During the two-week formal period the freshmen undergo
enough pressure even with the system functioning as it should
1 unction. I hat is why additional pressure of illegal rushing during
that time is especially undesirable.
I'lie collapse of the system last spring brought thinking fra
ternity men to the realization that drastic reform was vitally neces
sary. A sincere effort has been made this year to remedy the situ
ation, and much has been accomplished. The conduct of fraternities
up to this time has been by no means perfect, but it has been tre
mendously better than it was during the same period in 192 ( ). And
that improvement, to those who desire to see common sense and
fair play predominate, has been encouraging.
l!ut 110 one should be lulled into complacency by this apparently
satisfactory state of affairs. The system is put under infinitely
;jrenter stress and strain during the two weeks of formal rushing
than it is at any time during the year.
Stanford's fraternities connot afford to permit a repetition of
the fiasco which broke last year. Fairness to the fraternities them
selves and fairness to the freshmen demands that there must be no
such repetition.
I)raslic and instant punishment is the only panacea.
