HONEY—At The New Stanford. !
"Honey" is comedy of the best 1
high school variety. "Come Out of
the Kitchen," on which "Honey"
is based, lias been a favorite with
high school junior classes for the
last decade.
Needless to say, the original
masterpiece lias paled before time,
Kleig lights, and "live great song
hits." With Hie exception of a
"Hallelujah" episode the singing is
atrocious.
S keels Gallagher, Lillian Roth,
Zaxu Pitts, what's-her-name, Lilr I
lian's mother, and a child actress j
share the comedy responsibilities]
of the performance. All of those |
ac<|iiil IhemseivuK well.
The chief virtue of the picture is j
thai for the most part ii doesn't j
take itself seriously. When it fails
to keep good faith with this re-J
solve il flops.
Nancy Carroll and Stanley Smith
provide a minor strain very minor j
and a considerable strain. Moth are
supposed to take themselves seri
ously. Nancy being a beauty is for
given. Thumbs down on Stanley.
The rest of the hill is excellent.

SO LET'S BE GAY—At the Alca
zar Theatre, San Francisco.
"So Let's Me (lay" is 1 lit* sort of
play that inevitably draws good
houses. Meaning of course that il
is risque. Not too obviously risque
-bill with ils dialogue well
sprinkled with racy repartee and
with more than one scene whose
implications are hroadminded.
Violet, Heming in her role as the
charming divorcee of the play, daz
zles the audience very successfully.
She has an amazing flashing smile,
and a gorgeous sense of humor,
and she glitters all over the stage,
throughout the play, while the rest
of the cast, enthusiastically plays
up to her.
This co-operation among the ac

tors is one of the best points of
the performance. They seem to get i
huge personal enjoyment, out of ;
the lines and situations, as if they
were on the inside (if some out
rageously funny joke on each other. !
The exuberance and fineness,
which the leading characters put \
into their acting, doubles the origi
nal vivacity and sparkle of the ;
play.
The extreme novelty of the ini- j
tial situation is well-handled. Mrs. j
Houcicault, a wealthy, eccentric
old lady, lias discovered that her!
granddaughter is madly in love)
with a professional lieartbreaker. '
The clever old sinner sends for the
most fascinating woman she knows
In take this man away from Dier
dre. lint the charming Kilty Ihown
arrives to find thai this man is the
husband she had divorced three
years before.
The situation is curiously ironic.
"Well, let's bo gay about it," sug
gesl.s Kilty Urown. And so the
house-party which Mrs. .Moncicault
has assembled plunges into ils
rather strenuous hut. extremely di
verting gayet y.
The role of Mrs. Houeicaull is i
superbly played. Next to thai of
Kitty Mrown j! is the lies! role of
the play. Townley Town is all thai
a magnificent, long-legged English
man should be particularly when
lie grows amorous. Virginia Valli
in the pari of Dierdre is more el'- j
fective as an ornament than as an
act ress.
"So Lei's It'* flay" is a froth of
smart lines and flippant, amusing
attitudes- a froth which very nice
ly covers up the brittle superficial
ity of lie* worldly social circle with
which the play is concerned. It is
light, brilliant, and fact. You will
like il both for the distinguished
leading lady and for all its lovely, i
clever repartee the kind one al
ways wants to remember, and
never can. —M. L. It.
