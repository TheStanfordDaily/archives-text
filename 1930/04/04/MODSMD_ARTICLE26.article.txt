HONEY—At The New Stanford. !
"Honey" is comedy of the best 1
high school variety. "Come Out of
the Kitchen," on which "Honey"
is based, lias been a favorite with
high school junior classes for the
last decade.
Needless to say, the original
masterpiece lias paled before time,
Kleig lights, and "live great song
hits." With Hie exception of a
"Hallelujah" episode the singing is
atrocious.

Zaxu Pitts, what's-her-name, Lilr I

of the performance. All of those |
