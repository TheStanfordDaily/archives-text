# MADGE KENNEDY FOUND AS CHARMING BACKSTAGE AS BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS
## 
### BY WILLIAM GRACE 
Few things in the interviewer's I
experience are more disappointing j
than to see an actress in a play,
go backstage, and find her entirely
different, robbed of her glamorous j
charm. If she seems "out of char- j
acter," she is like a puppet hang- j
ing from its strings.
None who talks to Madge Ken
nedy, playing ibis week in "Paris
Bound" at the Columbia in Sun
Francisco, will feel that she is less
keen a wit off the stage than when
speaking the author's lines before
the footlights.
This popular comedienne, with
gray eyes and beautiful bands, re-'
ceived us in her dressing room and
explained bow disappointed she
was l hat. she would probably not
be here for Ihe hig Meet on April
1!Â». "I don't know which school Ii
would pull for," she said. "My lead
ing man, William llanley, is a Cali
fornia man, but I think Stanford
men are awfully nice. Two of them
came up to see me ibis afternoon.:

"Speaking of colleges, do you.
know that there is no audience be
fore which I would rather play
than u college audience? I have
appeared in college towns iill over
the country, :md they seem to be
much more Inoadminded, .sympa
thetic, ami good-humored. I have
enjoyed coining to the Pacific Coast
to play this spring, and look for
ward to coming hack next year j
from New York." Miss Kennedy ;
liuk completed her last play for
tliis visit. She did "The Perfect
Alibi" in San Francisco and Los
Angeles last month.
Horn in Chicago, Miss Kennedy I
early moved to a ranch near River
side, California. Her education was
cut short when she left after her
lirsl year of high school to study
art. Her first work on the stage
was as a leading lady. From this
scoring start, ul the age of 17, she
has continued, always playing the
leading role. Seven of her shows
have played year runs, including
"Paris Hound."
