# SIDELINE SLANTS...

### 
Yielding first place on Saturday's
sports schedule to their yearling
brethren, the varsity track and
field men will spend a quiet after
noon at home preparing for next
week's tilt with Bean Cromwell's
widely heralded Trojans.
Cutting seconds off the best
lime of his NN(i, mile, and two-mile
runners by next Saturday is the
lask confronting Stanford's non
chalant track mentor. Records set
up in competition in these events
by I'.S.C.'s squadron of distance
men bode exceeding ill for the
Redshirts' chances of picking up
more than a point or two from the
wreckage.
U.S.C. Two-Milers Good
Sli 141n encouragement given to
varsity two-mile aspirations when
Nlines broke the tap in 9:f>9 in the
recent interclass meet fades into
insignificance when compared with
the efforts of Troy's trio of eight"
lap men. Al Berkeley last Aveek
Kitzmauriee, Daniels, and Patter
son, all of Southern California,
crossed the line in less than !l:5li,
with Fitzmauriee running U:r»4 4-5.
Bob Brown, forced out of the in
terclass race with a pulled muscle,
still appears Templeton's best bet
for the two-mile grind. Brown lias
vet to run Hie race of which he is
capable, and with proper inspira
tion might pull a Frank Merriwell
to smear the dope bucket all over
Ihe ovt^l.
Trojan Milers Favored
Chances Of an unexpected Cardi
nal victory in the mile are so slim
as to appear practically invisible,
with I'arker and Cooper going up
against cliff Halstead and Hansen.
Ilalstead surprised last week to
heat out "Spud" Mossman, Califor
nia's premier distance man, in
4:25 2-5- approximately eight sec
onds faster than the best time
made by Parker this year.
A glance at the two-lap event
completes the sad story. Atkinson,
who has yet to rut two minutes,
meets MeGeagh and Burke, both
consistent at 1:59. Here, however,
a faint ray of hope gleams through
the darkness, for the Stanford half
miler, a sophomore with a world of
light, is gaining speed and experi
ence every day. Unless Atkinson is
taken seriously enough by Crom
well so that the Trojans employ
some of their highly scientific
"boxing" tactics, the Card sopho
more may yet prove the dark
horse of the meet.
