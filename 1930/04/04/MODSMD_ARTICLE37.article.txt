### Howard Moore 
.Tourneying across the bay, Stan
ford's baseball varsity will invade
the Berkeley campus tomorrow
slight underdogs to capture the
first of a three-game series with
the California nine. The game is
scheduled for 2;:i0 o'clock on llil
gard Field.
Not since 1027 have the Cardi
nals won a game from the Blue
and Gold ball artists and it has
been live long years since the
Cards have won the annual series.
Not since the day when "Strong
arm" Ernie Nevers went the full
nine innings against the Bears and
homed in t lie last of the ninth
to win the game and present the
trophy room with a battered but
much-prized baseball has Berkeley
known the taste of the citron in
losing two out of three.
Horner To Pitch
Sending bis pitching ace" and
leading moundSman of the confer
ence last year into the box, Coach
Clint Evans will rely on Norm
f-lorner to turn in his fourth con
secutive victory over the Cards.
And Bill Burgett, Bear right fielder
and leading batter of last year, is
counted on to head California's
famous ninth-inning rallies.
In spite of Horner's string of
victories in the past, Stanford fans
remember with delight how Wel
ter's men finally succeeded in
knocking him out of the box in the
last game of the series a year ago
and only a fast double play by
Chili Valianos, present Bear cap
tain, saved the day for Berkeley.
The Redshirts enter the game
doped to lose, but California has
won all her games but two by a
one-run margin and most of those
by ninth-inning scpieezes; so the
Cards have more than a good
chance to scrape through with a
Bear scalp.
Mears To Start
Wolter plans to start a compara
tively new combination in the in
field tomorrow with Jim Mears on
first, Cutshaw on the keystone
sack. Red Berg in the hot corner,
and Johnson at short. Mears and
Berg played in the second St.
Mary's game last Wednesday, both
fielding flawlessly and Mears bat
ting 1.000. Hunken, Rintala, and
Campbell will cavort in the outer
gardens with Hardy behind the
plate. Yard Loomis is still slated
to start in the box unless bis back
is still bothering him, in which
case Story will get the call.
