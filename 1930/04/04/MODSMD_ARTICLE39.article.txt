# DEMPSEY BACK AGAIN?
## FROSH TRACKMEN DOPED TO TRIM SAN FRANCISCO ALL-STARS HERE TOMORROW 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Furnishing tlie only track compe
tition scheduled for the campus
this week-end, the Stanford fresh
man track team will meet the San
Francisco All-Stars on the Old Oval
track tomorrow morning at 10:30
o'clock. This will be the last con
test for the yearlings before they
engage the California freshmen in
the annual "Little-Big Meet" just
one week from today on the Berke
ley track.
The All-Stars' best chance t.o
pick up points tomorrow seems to
bo in the sprints. John Buchanan,
Poly captain, runs t lie hundred in
10 1-5, Jack Twelvetrees of the
freshmen lias equalled that time
once this season but has been
beaten twice in much slower time.
Bennett and Gunther of the prep
team have run in 10 2-5 which is a
trifle faster than Leonard Ward
and Don Blackmail have been run
ning.
In the 220 Ben Eahtman should
win easily if he runs. Ward will
have to battle it out with the All-
Star sprinters for second. Undoubt
edly Eastman, Rogers, and Murray
will make it a Clean sweep in the

[ quarter-mile as they have been
doing all season.
! Frank Fullenwider and George
<,Naylon have been staging neck
and-neek races and should cop the
| half-mile in easy fashion. If Bob
i llitnter is running, the frosh should
take a first in the mile. Without
| him in the race the four-lap event
should develop into quite a battle
between Mires of the freshmen
; and Hanson, Novitskv, and Mayer
of the All-Stars.
Here La horde and Nelson Gray
1 should place first and second in
I the shot although "Horse" Homel
j of the All-Stars lias tossed the 12-
j pound pellet 51 feet 3 inches, which
> is only slightly short of the marks
made this season by the two frosh.
Schmidt of the All-Stars has
thrown the discus in the neighbor
hood of 130 feet but this should
i not be quite good enough to pre
vent La horde and Gray from pick
ing up another eight points.

once this season but has been
beaten twice in much slower time.
Bennett and Gunther of the prep
team have run in 10 2-5 which is a
trifle faster than Leonard Ward
and Don Blackmail have been run
ning.
In the 220 Ben Eahtman should
win easily if he runs. Ward will
have to battle it out with the All-
Star sprinters for second. Undoubt
edly Eastman, Rogers, and Murray
will make it a Clean sweep in the

[ quarter-mile as they have been
doing all season.
! Frank Fullenwider and George
<,Naylon have been staging neck
and-neek races and should cop the
| half-mile in easy fashion. If Bob
i llitnter is running, the frosh should
take a first in the mile. Without
| him in the race the four-lap event
should develop into quite a battle
between Mires of the freshmen
; and Hanson, Novitskv, and Mayer
of the All-Stars.
Here La horde and Nelson Gray
1 should place first and second in
I the shot although "Horse" Homel
j of the All-Stars lias tossed the 12-
j pound pellet 51 feet 3 inches, which
> is only slightly short of the marks
made this season by the two frosh.
Schmidt of the All-Stars has
thrown the discus in the neighbor
hood of 130 feet but this should
i not be quite good enough to pre
vent La horde and Gray from pick
ing up another eight points.
