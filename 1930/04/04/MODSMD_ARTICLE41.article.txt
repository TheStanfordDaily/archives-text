# CARDINAL NETMEN CLASH WITH BRUIN TEAM HERE TODAY
## Stanford Meets Berkeley Clubmen in Matches There Tomorrow 
### 
Frank Ragan's varsity racketeers
are favored to whip some boys
from U.C.L.A. on the local courts
this afternoon at H:3O and .send
them back home.
The Bruins' main threat is in
their lirst doubles team of Dwoikin
and Robbins, the former a ranking i
state player, and the latter a for-'
mer Pacific Coast boy's champ. Al- j
though the Stanford racket men j
have been practically idle Ibis
week, they will have several dou
bles combinations in good form,
'due to tournament, competition due
ling vacation. Hall-Easton and
Weesner-Driscoll have been Ra
gan's hook-ups for some time now, ;
and seem likely to play today. lOas
ton, Hall, and Plymire will play
I lie singles, in the order named.
The Cards' heaviest workout of'
the week-end will probably come
tomorrow morning on the Berkeley
Tennis Club courts in Berkeley.
California's former star, Edward
Chandler, leads a powerful battle
front of clubmen against six Stan
ford singles players and three dou
bles teams.
