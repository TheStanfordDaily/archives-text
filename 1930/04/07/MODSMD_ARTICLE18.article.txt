### 
"Give 'em the Axe," famous Stan
ford yell, rang out with its original
meaning for the first, time in over
30 years when 2000 Cardinals ral
lied before the Library Friday
morning to celebrate the return oL'
the historic weapon. Paul Speegle,
yell-leader, opened the rally with
tiie "Axe Yell," and then proceeded
to introduce the 21 heroes who cap
tured the axe at a rally on the
Berkeley campus Thursday night.
Each of the 21 was introduced
in his turn, and each received an
individual, ovation. Robert Loof
bourow, one of (lie ringleaders in
the capture, made a short speech,
expressing tlie joy he and liis fel
lows felt at having succeeded in
bringing the axe back to Stanford.
"I find myself at strained rela
tions with myself this morning,"
began Dr. Robert E. Swain, Acting
President of the University, when
introduced by Speegle. "I have had
previous personal connections with
the Stanford Axe, having been a
member of the famous rally in San
Francisco in 1599 and witnessed
the disturbance leading to the Cali
fornia capture. Naturally, 1 feel
greatly elated at seeing the axe
now returned to this campus.
"California and Stanford are at
present on the most friendly terms
in their history. Yes, even after
last night the two universities are
on friendly terms. In fact, Stanford
finds herself at peace with the
world this morning," Dr. Swain
concluded.
Donald Evans, '22, and former
student body president, was pres
ent at the rally and spoke briefly.
"There is a certain something in
the yells this morning, and these
guys put it. there," he said, indi
cating the 21 rescuers on the Li
brary steps. "They have won the
gratitude of every Stanford alum
nus from the White House to San
Quentin.
"Previously, regardless of vic
tory or defeat, California has had
the satisfaction of possessing tin-
Stanford Axe," Evans continued.
"Now what will Cal have for snfneo
after their losses to Stanford? '.Ve
have demonstrated definitely the
triumph of brain over brawn. But.
let us pause in our jubilance to
think a moment of poor Mr. Hor
ner, who finds himself the holder
of the obsolete title of 'Custodian
of the Axe.'"
