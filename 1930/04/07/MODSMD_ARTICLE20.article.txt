### 
To obtain complete enumeration j
of all residents of this district, all ;
Stanford students whose legal resi- j
deuce address is that of the Uni- j
versity campus are requested to j
fill out individual census slips, i
which may be obtained at the
registrar's office this week.
Students whose legal address is
elsewhere, but where there is no j
one at home to give the census- i
taker the information desired, are I
also asked to till out the individual j
pink blanks.
