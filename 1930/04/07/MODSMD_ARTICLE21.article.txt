# PRESS SLOW IN OLDEN DAYS OF '99; AXE STORY ONE WEEK LATE
## 
### 
"California has stolen tlie axe!"
The news spread like wildfire over
the Stanford campus April 15, 1899.
Four days later, on April IH. the
fact was casually mentioned in the
editorial column of the Daily Palo
Alto.
This handling of the momentous
event stands in direct contrast
with the appearance of an extra
edition of the Daily on April 4,
19110, less than two and one-half
hours after the axe was stolen from
California.
The Daily Palo Alto was in 1899
edited by Everett W. Smith, pres-
I ent professor of journalism at Stan
! ford.
On April 14, 1899, the Daily Palo
Alto printed a story about a rally
I the previous night, in which the
i Stanford Axe had played an import
ant part.
The next day, Saturday, April 15,
California defeated the Cardinal
baseball team at Sixteenth and Fol
som streets in San Francisco. What
was more important was that Cali
fornia rooters at the game seized
the opportunity to lake possession
of the Stanford Axe.
In Monday's paper, April 17. there
was a story on "Stanford Loses the
Series." which surprisingly made
no mention of the theft of the axe.

I Editorials in tlie issue were de
voted to a sophomore-freshman do- j
i bate, the musical clubs, and a Stan- i
: ford alumni paper.
The next day the editorial col-1
! unin was Riven over to a discussion I
of campus dramatics and musical
activities, and still there was no
mention of the axe. In the "Special
Notices" column was the following
item: "Lost —at the baseball rally,
a gold watch chain. Finder please I
return to Ed Oilman, Delta Upsilon
i house."
Finally on April 1!) the editorial
high moguls seem to have received
I a rumor of the axe controversy and |
given it slight mention in the edi
torial column. "From the San Fran- ,
i cisco morning papers it is learned j
that Track Manager Franklin has
received word from here that if the
axe which we them' on last ;
Saturday and failed to take from
them on Monday is displayed at
the Field-day next. Saturday said
Field-day will be promptly called
off. We rlo not know whether they !
intend to display the axe or not. j
.... We do not know what the j
present possessors of the axe in- i
i tend to do with it "
Then the following day the axe |
question was discussed for the first !
time in the news columns, five days |
after the story really "broke."

"California has stolen tlie axe!"
The news spread like wildfire over
the Stanford campus April 15, 1899.
Four days later, on April IH. the
fact was casually mentioned in the
editorial column of the Daily Palo
Alto.
This handling of the momentous
event stands in direct contrast
with the appearance of an extra
edition of the Daily on April 4,
19110, less than two and one-half
hours after the axe was stolen from
California.
The Daily Palo Alto was in 1899
edited by Everett W. Smith, pres-
I ent professor of journalism at Stan
! ford.
On April 14, 1899, the Daily Palo
Alto printed a story about a rally
I the previous night, in which the
i Stanford Axe had played an import
ant part.
The next day, Saturday, April 15,
California defeated the Cardinal
baseball team at Sixteenth and Fol
som streets in San Francisco. What
was more important was that Cali
fornia rooters at the game seized
the opportunity to lake possession
of the Stanford Axe.
In Monday's paper, April 17. there
was a story on "Stanford Loses the
Series." which surprisingly made
no mention of the theft of the axe.

I Editorials in tlie issue were de
voted to a sophomore-freshman do- j
i bate, the musical clubs, and a Stan- i
: ford alumni paper.
The next day the editorial col-1
! unin was Riven over to a discussion I
of campus dramatics and musical
activities, and still there was no
mention of the axe. In the "Special
Notices" column was the following
item: "Lost —at the baseball rally,
a gold watch chain. Finder please I
return to Ed Oilman, Delta Upsilon
i house."
Finally on April 1!) the editorial
high moguls seem to have received
I a rumor of the axe controversy and |
given it slight mention in the edi
torial column. "From the San Fran- ,
i cisco morning papers it is learned j
that Track Manager Franklin has
received word from here that if the
axe which we them' on last ;
Saturday and failed to take from
them on Monday is displayed at
the Field-day next. Saturday said
Field-day will be promptly called
off. We rlo not know whether they !
intend to display the axe or not. j
.... We do not know what the j
present possessors of the axe in- i
i tend to do with it "
Then the following day the axe |
question was discussed for the first !
time in the news columns, five days |
after the story really "broke."
