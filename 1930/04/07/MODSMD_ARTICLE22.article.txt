# AXE CAPTORS DISCLOSE INSIDE STORY OF RECOVERY
## 'TWENTY-ONE' GIVE FIRST AUTHENTIC STORY FOR DAILY Secrecy and Perfect Timing Brings Success to Card Band; Each Car, Each Man, Has Definite Duty And Destination; Miller Throws Bomb 
### 
(Editor's Note: The first authentic and authorized story of the
ixc return to Stanford by the twenty-one Sequoia stalwarts is printed
in this morning's edition of the Daily. It was written especially for the
Daily and compiled in collaboration by the twenty-one heroes at a
meeting held Saturday night.)

Determined to recover the Stanford axe sooner or later,
a small group of Sequoia men were organized by Don Kropp
four years ago.
Unsuccessful attempts by this aggregation during the last
three years were organized and enthusiastic ones, but each

• was frustrated by some develop-
I ment arising during the course of
; action.
In 1927 Moroni Jameson actually
carried the axe into Ihe Berekely
| bank, but so completely surrounded
was he by California men that es
cape with the cherished trophy
was impossible.
Fate would have it in 1928 thai,
the axe custodian, after being
tackled by Stanford attackers,
should fall on top the traditional
implement, it was this lucky tum
ble which saved the axe once again
for Cal. Delay in wresting the wea
pon from its guardian gave time for
j nearby frosh to surge forward and
I protect the cherished weapon.
Participants in the 1928 struggle
were Moroni Jameson, Setli Mc
i Kenna, Phil Duncan, Ross Fields,
j Obie Banks, George Brummel, Joe
i Bridges, Nordi Nordheim, Bob
| Loofbourow, Jim Purcell, Johnny
| O'Sullivan, and Don Kropp.

J ford men were recognized. Plans

| realization, of their plans for the
j return of the axe to Stanford.
Secrecy has been strictly main
tained by the band of twenty-one.
| Organized by Kropp, the deter
-1 mined few adopted a policy of con
! tinued silence concerning their
| plans. They deemed it vitally neces-
I sary that little be known of their
| actions if the hallowed adaga was
j ever to be returned to the Farm.
Last Tuesday a secret meeting
of (lie twenty-one was called by
j Kropp. Ringleaders were chosen,
| plans wore outlined, and a lino of
j action formulated.
The group planned to recapture
the axe on the steps of the Amen
can Trust Company bank at Berke
ley after its return by armored car
I from the rally in the Greek Thea
j tre. Men were to be stationed bo-
I tween the bank door and tho
j armored car to prevent entrance
into Hie bank. To effect, a quick,
getaway it was deemed essential
to have a speedy automobile close
by and ready for instant use. The
camera ruse was the solution.
Thursday morning the idol was
thoroughly familiarized to the
twenty-one before they departed
for Berkeley.
At 4:30 Thursday afternoon three
cars slipped quietly away from the
S'lnnfonl Mausoleum—the final meeting place of the plotters -and
l,i ailed fi !* I'erkeley, for ( al, and for the axe.
Kach car had a definite destination and function.
Frio Mill's car went directly to Alston Way, east of Shattuck >
\ venue. There the occupants immediately joined the Calilorniaj
frosli in their march to ilie hank to get the axe.
I»err\ l.iken's machine was driven directly to South I'erkelry,
parked, and ils occupants hastened to the < ireck Theatre.
kropp and lames Trimmingham drove directly 1o Oakland,,
Killed a lluick roadster from the llert/. drive-yonrself service.!
Kropp parked his car two blocks from the hank and then joined ,
Trimmingham in the rented car.
The whole situation was minutely surveyed. Care was laken i
1o avoid the hank environs so that suspicion would be averted.
During the rally at the (ireek 'I jieatre the members oil the j
twenlx one band present cautiously edged their way to the heart of j
ihe bowl <-0 tliev could be near the axe at the cessation o! the allair.
Ten minutes before the rally closed, five Stanford men secretly j
left the (ireek Theatre. They were the feka camramen- Kny i
Walsh and Warren (iage, the driver of the rented car—Jim Trim
iiMngiiam. and \rt Miller and Don Kropp. I hey drove to the bank, j
backed the car onto the sidewalk, and rigged up a camera in the!
rumble seat.
Miller and Kropp rode back to Sather dale to awail ihe de
parture of the armored car. When it was seen to leave, Ihe two
men "tore back" to the bank.
Plans Complete
M iller, who plaved the role of bombist, concealed the "pineapple
under coat and planted himself at the entrance ot the hank.'
Kropp parked his car at the rear of the camera car and in such a
way that he could follow closely behind and ward off anv cars
that might threaten to overtake the machine racing away with the
recaptured axe. After placing his car in position, Kropp. general
supervisor of the plan, joined the cameramen to ascertain that
everything was ready for action.
The Stanford men moved nervously in their positions as they J
impatientlv awaited the armored car. It was not long before a
black, steel-covered Studebaker hove into sight. It carried the axe.
Norm I lorner, an armed guard, and a driver.' Stanford men hang I
ing on the car were Howard Avery, Eric Hill, Loofhourow. and
lerrv Mettman. All the remaining twenty-one took positions around
the armored car and near the hank door. To allow ample time tor
these maneuvers the fake cameramen were loudly demanding, "Let*-
have a good shot at the axe!
Freshmen Pose
Freshman guards, pleased at the chance for phot< raphic puh
lirity, eagerly fell for this ru-e. They politely drew back to '"have
their pictures taken." Contrary to popular belief, Horner did \( >'l
yield lo the camera ruse. He remained within the armored car.

An overloaded shot of flashlight powder was discharged with a
I blinding flash and a whitish puff, jnst as Norm Horner, axe ens-1
| todian, stepped from the car.
Scarcely had Horner touched the sidewalk than Howard Avery
dropped from the top of the car upon the body of the unsuspecting
'custodian, wrenched the axe from Homer and passed tlu* implc- i
tnent through several hands to Loofbourow. Hill and ttcttman ;
i then dosed in on Horner simultaneously in an effort to quell the j
furiously battling C'alifornian.
Loofbourow, meanwhile, tucked the treasured axe beneath his,
weater and calmly walked through an opening made for him in
the crowd by Stanford men. Few suspected that under Hob's j
brown sweater lay hidden that precious trophy which California 1
had 7.( lonely guarded for thirty one years. He slowly walked t<> ;
the t unera car, got in. and away went the machine, driven by,
Trimmingham.

Just .'is 11 ic camera car whirled away. Miller dropped a tear
bomb directly in front of the bank. I lie crowd scattered as tlie
odoriferous fumes began to penetrate the air. Avcrv. the original
attacker of I lorner. was swept into the bank by a pushing, clamor
ing mob of vengeful Californians. They thought ho had the axe.
I ndaunted bv numbers, Mill and IVttman rushed to the aid of the
confederate. Luckily, fumes of the lear gas crept into the bank,
filling the air with the sickening odor. The three Stanfordites
escaped through the crowd.
During the bombing confusion the armored car was thoroughly
ransacked by Kropp and Miller to make sure that no hoax had
been imposed upon ilie Stanford raiders.
Exits Blocked
Ferrino and his men. having completely blocked every avenue
of exit from the vicinity, materially delayed word of the axe theft
from being spread through T'erkcley.
