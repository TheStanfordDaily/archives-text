(Editor's Note: The first authentic and authorized story of the
ixc return to Stanford by the twenty-one Sequoia stalwarts is printed
in this morning's edition of the Daily. It was written especially for the
Daily and compiled in collaboration by the twenty-one heroes at a
meeting held Saturday night.)

Determined to recover the Stanford axe sooner or later,
a small group of Sequoia men were organized by Don Kropp
four years ago.
Unsuccessful attempts by this aggregation during the last
three years were organized and enthusiastic ones, but each

• was frustrated by some develop-
I ment arising during the course of
; action.
In 1927 Moroni Jameson actually
carried the axe into Ihe Berekely
| bank, but so completely surrounded
was he by California men that es
cape with the cherished trophy
was impossible.
Fate would have it in 1928 thai,
the axe custodian, after being
tackled by Stanford attackers,
should fall on top the traditional
implement, it was this lucky tum
ble which saved the axe once again
for Cal. Delay in wresting the wea
pon from its guardian gave time for
j nearby frosh to surge forward and
I protect the cherished weapon.
Participants in the 1928 struggle
were Moroni Jameson, Setli Mc
i Kenna, Phil Duncan, Ross Fields,
j Obie Banks, George Brummel, Joe
i Bridges, Nordi Nordheim, Bob
| Loofbourow, Jim Purcell, Johnny
| O'Sullivan, and Don Kropp.

j return of the axe to Stanford.
Secrecy has been strictly main
tained by the band of twenty-one.
| Organized by Kropp, the deter

I sary that little be known of their

j ever to be returned to the Farm.
Last Tuesday a secret meeting
of (lie twenty-one was called by
j Kropp. Ringleaders were chosen,

The group planned to recapture
the axe on the steps of the Amen
can Trust Company bank at Berke
ley after its return by armored car
I from the rally in the Greek Thea

I tween the bank door and tho
j armored car to prevent entrance
into Hie bank. To effect, a quick,
getaway it was deemed essential
to have a speedy automobile close
by and ready for instant use. The
camera ruse was the solution.
Thursday morning the idol was
thoroughly familiarized to the
twenty-one before they departed
for Berkeley.
At 4:30 Thursday afternoon three
cars slipped quietly away from the
