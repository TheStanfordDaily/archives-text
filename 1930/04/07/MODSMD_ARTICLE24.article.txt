# POOR OLD CAL

### 
K oaring through llic night over J Crist Hay sideroads; carrying
ilicir prize hack through the gates from whence it came 31 years
ago, an intrepid hand of 21 C ardinal patriols made history for their
\lma Mater —carved large niches for themselves in Stanford's
Mali of Fame.
They returned with the most precious treasure!
I!y cunning and hy daring they rescued the Stanford Axe from
alien hands that had held it for three decades! The Stanford A.ve!
Think of il !
I or 31 years Sons of Stanford's Red have smarted under Cali
fornia taunts; for 31 years they have endured the ignominy of
frustration. That all is ended now.
II is ended because of the ingenuity and the intrepidity of this
< ardinal crew. All honor shall he theirs, lor all time they shall
he remembered here on the harm.
Dedicate Ihe Quad to them; banquet them; cheer them; carve
their names on the. sandstone walls of the Library .... give 'em
the joint if they want it.
They are heroes, and Stanford is proud of them.
* *
So for 31 years now California vest buttons have been endan
gered bv ever swelling California chests; for 31 years now IJerkelev
throats have been sore from singing praises of themselves; for 31
ears those l'.lue and Cold men have strutted and preened.
Kven when Stanford had made over those California "Wonder
'IVams" into California blunder teams; even when the P.ig Meet
had become scarcely a t good warm-up for the Cardinal stalwarts,
the Berkeley gang would not quit their praising and their strutting
and their preening. The Axe was still theirs.
Hut no more.
\nd this sudden deflation of California chests has proved a hit
too much, apparently. \t least it has proved too much if the splut
tering pen of William L. Hudson, editor of the Daily Californian,
i - any criterion.
Air. I ludson got all fussed up Thursday night when he heard the
news, lie just grabbed his typewriter and burned those big Stan
ford bullies to a frazzle. Ile pounded the keys fmaybe he beat his
poor worried head against the wall) and sang his hymn of hate
to the keys' staccato rhythm.
This is his editorial:
HATE STANFORD!
Stanford is likely to wake up on a different campus
this morning. The clever boys who stole the Axe may
have returned to paint the town red, but they may find
the place painted Blue and Gold before the night is
over.
Hate Stanford! Catch the euphony of that sentence,
notice its essential accuracy! Hate Stanford ! Repeat it
over and over in your mind; formulate it with your
lips! HATE STANFORD!
We have always had a notion as to the sort of people
that inhabit the God-forsaken campus 40 miles south,
and our notion is now confirmed. The rally committee,
though it may have erred in allowing the armored car
to be too far in advance of the scanty freshman guard,
cannot be blamed for being routed by the most care
fully planned racketeer robbery in local history. Stan
lord, despairing of an honest burglary, imported Chi
cago methods. Tear bombs may be fair piay at Stanford
—but then, that is Stanford! HATE STANFORD!
We are nurturing one especial animosity, and that
is for Stanford. And we won't be very sorry if the
Stanford boys find their Quad a deserted ruin this
morning, and the campus returned to the desert from
which it came.
If Stanford gets satisfaction out of this, O.K. So
do we out of HATING STANFORD!

California will play Stanford in baseball tomorrow.
Norm Horner will be on the mound, as scheduled. The
whole team needs all the support that the student body
can give it. It is up to every Californian to be there!
* & >i«
California men and women should he proud of their Mr. Iftul
on. He's a great little hater, even for Berkeley.
Mr. Hudson just hates and hates—and then hates some more,
fe hates Stanford ... he hates red . . . he hates the Quad . . . he
lates Stanford . . . he hates red . . . Ciee! hut it's fierce.
Mr. Hudson hates tear bombs and "racketeer" methods, lie
asts aspersions at Stanford sense of fair play.

Apparently Mr. Hudson forgets the armored cars and the bank
vaults and the gangs that California used in keeping the Axe.
Racketeer methods to deal with racketeers, Mr. Hudson, lust
a little game of tit for tat.
"Ilate Stanford" is a good lille for an editorial, but the Daily
likes ' 'I '<tor OM (a 1 better. Il has euphonv, too. \nd delightful
rhythm. And such accuracy.

It was a different California spirit from Mr. I ludson's that con
ceived the Rears'action in connection with the stolen trophies. The
Daily congratulates the I'erkeleyitos on their stand. It is sports
manlike.
* * *
Shed a tear for Mr. Horner. You know—the Mr. Horner. His
tongue was more glib at the rally than his acts were quick later on.
I»tit then, it wasn't all sadness for Mr. Horner. His fund of infor

POOR OLD C AI.!
K oaring through llic night over J Crist Hay sideroads; carrying
ilicir prize hack through the gates from whence it came 31 years
ago, an intrepid hand of 21 C ardinal patriols made history for their
\lma Mater —carved large niches for themselves in Stanford's
Mali of Fame.
They returned with the most precious treasure!
I!y cunning and hy daring they rescued the Stanford Axe from
alien hands that had held it for three decades! The Stanford A.ve!
Think of il !
I or 31 years Sons of Stanford's Red have smarted under Cali
fornia taunts; for 31 years they have endured the ignominy of
frustration. That all is ended now.
II is ended because of the ingenuity and the intrepidity of this
< ardinal crew. All honor shall he theirs, lor all time they shall
he remembered here on the harm.
Dedicate Ihe Quad to them; banquet them; cheer them; carve
their names on the. sandstone walls of the Library .... give 'em
the joint if they want it.
They are heroes, and Stanford is proud of them.

So for 31 years now California vest buttons have been endan
gered bv ever swelling California chests; for 31 years now IJerkelev
throats have been sore from singing praises of themselves; for 31
ears those l'.lue and Cold men have strutted and preened.
Kven when Stanford had made over those California "Wonder
'IVams" into California blunder teams; even when the P.ig Meet
had become scarcely a t good warm-up for the Cardinal stalwarts,
the Berkeley gang would not quit their praising and their strutting
and their preening. The Axe was still theirs.
Hut no more.
\nd this sudden deflation of California chests has proved a hit
too much, apparently. \t least it has proved too much if the splut

HATE STANFORD!
Stanford is likely to wake up on a different campus
this morning. The clever boys who stole the Axe may
have returned to paint the town red, but they may find
the place painted Blue and Gold before the night is
over.
Hate Stanford! Catch the euphony of that sentence,
notice its essential accuracy! Hate Stanford ! Repeat it
over and over in your mind; formulate it with your
lips! HATE STANFORD!
We have always had a notion as to the sort of people
that inhabit the God-forsaken campus 40 miles south,
and our notion is now confirmed. The rally committee,
though it may have erred in allowing the armored car
to be too far in advance of the scanty freshman guard,
cannot be blamed for being routed by the most care
fully planned racketeer robbery in local history. Stan
lord, despairing of an honest burglary, imported Chi
cago methods. Tear bombs may be fair piay at Stanford
—but then, that is Stanford! HATE STANFORD!
We are nurturing one especial animosity, and that
is for Stanford. And we won't be very sorry if the
Stanford boys find their Quad a deserted ruin this
morning, and the campus returned to the desert from
which it came.
If Stanford gets satisfaction out of this, O.K. So
do we out of HATING STANFORD!

California will play Stanford in baseball tomorrow.
Norm Horner will be on the mound, as scheduled. The
whole team needs all the support that the student body
can give it. It is up to every Californian to be there!

POOR OLD C AI.!
K oaring through llic night over J Crist Hay sideroads; carrying
ilicir prize hack through the gates from whence it came 31 years
ago, an intrepid hand of 21 C ardinal patriols made history for their
\lma Mater —carved large niches for themselves in Stanford's
Mali of Fame.
They returned with the most precious treasure!
I!y cunning and hy daring they rescued the Stanford Axe from
alien hands that had held it for three decades! The Stanford A.ve!
Think of il !
I or 31 years Sons of Stanford's Red have smarted under Cali
fornia taunts; for 31 years they have endured the ignominy of
frustration. That all is ended now.
II is ended because of the ingenuity and the intrepidity of this
< ardinal crew. All honor shall he theirs, lor all time they shall
he remembered here on the harm.
Dedicate Ihe Quad to them; banquet them; cheer them; carve
their names on the. sandstone walls of the Library .... give 'em
the joint if they want it.
They are heroes, and Stanford is proud of them.

So for 31 years now California vest buttons have been endan
gered bv ever swelling California chests; for 31 years now IJerkelev
throats have been sore from singing praises of themselves; for 31
ears those l'.lue and Cold men have strutted and preened.
Kven when Stanford had made over those California "Wonder
'IVams" into California blunder teams; even when the P.ig Meet
had become scarcely a t good warm-up for the Cardinal stalwarts,
the Berkeley gang would not quit their praising and their strutting
and their preening. The Axe was still theirs.
Hut no more.
\nd this sudden deflation of California chests has proved a hit
too much, apparently. \t least it has proved too much if the splut

HATE STANFORD!
Stanford is likely to wake up on a different campus
this morning. The clever boys who stole the Axe may
have returned to paint the town red, but they may find
the place painted Blue and Gold before the night is
over.
Hate Stanford! Catch the euphony of that sentence,
notice its essential accuracy! Hate Stanford ! Repeat it
over and over in your mind; formulate it with your
lips! HATE STANFORD!
We have always had a notion as to the sort of people
that inhabit the God-forsaken campus 40 miles south,
and our notion is now confirmed. The rally committee,

to be too far in advance of the scanty freshman guard,
