SALVAGING OLD AGE. By Lillien
J. Martin and Claire de Gruchy.
Macrriillan Company, New York.
1930.
"Old age . . . tliiH state is sup
posed to descend upon a person
in the night . . . when he wakes
up on his sixty-fifth birthday, he
is old." Ii i« this traditional belief
thai Dr. Martin and her group of
San Francisco co-workers wish to
combat.
Dr. Marl in is a former professor
of psychology at Stanford and is
at present an emeritus professor
of thai department. Since her re
tirement in lUlti sin? lias been very
active in San Francisco social wel
fare work.
"The tragedy of old age," she
states, "is its unhappiiiess . . . when
we have arrived at the place of
looking at old age as a period of
life rather than a bodily condition,
I we shalf give if the intelligent and

_ ■
| careful study thai we have applied
ito other such periods, infancy,
childhood, adolescence, etc., that
is, as a period with its own strug
! gles,. its aspirations, and its ac-
I complishinents."
The study of over two hundred
old people forms the basis for the
I information presented.' Her knowl
edge of psychology makes it, pos
j Bible for her to interpret the feel
ings and problems of these people.
Although the subject of the book
| is probably not especially enticing
to most people, I)r. Martin's many
! anecdotes should make it interest
ing for students interested ill hu
man nut lire.
The book is written in a calm,
I sincere, and unprejudiced manner
in fact, its style and contents are
i indicative of its very subject —
! which is not strange in view of
I lie fact that Dr. Martin is herself
j seventy-eight.
