Now that (filching the Chappie
j opener) the hullabaloo of Thurn
j day night has subsided to a calm
i sense of. bliss and contentment
with all the world, this seems a
particularly welcome and joyous
Occasion for us to begin our mis

Nonnan had a little axe,
He kept it in a vault;
Norman had a little axe:
It, isn't Norman's fault!
There was a man from our town,
And lie- was wondrous wise;
He took along a tear-bomb,
And put out Berkeley's eyes.
j (if course they got them back
again,
Tint brain had conquered brawn;
Their eyes were hardly useful
then:
You see, the axe was gone.

Little Norm Horner
: Hits in a corner,
All broken-hearted and blue.
He isn't so dumb;
You Cal fellows, come,
Isn't that what you're all doing,

Little Mister MufJ'-it
Must be in a huff —it
Seems-so, at least, to me;
For no spider spied him
'Or sat down beside- him,
Hut twenty-one Cards on ft spree.
If I were Sir Muif-it
In, such a big huff, it
May be unkind, but I say,
I'd go to the corner
: And sit with Jack Horner,
| And wither and wither away.
