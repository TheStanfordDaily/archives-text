# NEW EXPERIMENTAL GARDEN CONDUCTED FOR DISEASE STUDY
## 
### 
Something different in experi
mental gardens is being conducted
by James McMurphy, associate
professor of botany, across from
the physics building. The distin
guishing feature of the garden is
the possibility of studying plant
diseases in all their stages, because
of the mild weather of this region.
"Ordinarily most botanical speci
mens have been only preserved
'and do not afford means of study
ing the progressive parasitic
growths." said McMurphy. "In this
garden plants merely have to be
brought in and closely observed
from time to time for signs of dis
ease."
There are planted in the plot all
the common gardening plants from
blackberries to garlic and many
trees. One of the trees, an apri
cot seedling, is particularly inter
esting. On it have been grafted
sprigs of peach, almond, and half
a dozen different varieties of plums
and prunes. A cherry branch has
been grafted to it several times,
but unsuccessfully, since the union
is not strong enough. All in all
I more than 400 different kinds of
plants are represented in the plot.
McMurphy is officially appointed
I by the University to watch out for
and prevent diseases of campus
flowers and shrubbery.
