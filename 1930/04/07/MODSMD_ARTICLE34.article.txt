## 
### 
Stanford's- freshman ball slug
gers felt the sting of defeat for
the first time Saturday afternoon,
when the California Cubs adminis
tered to htme a <â€¢ to 1 defeat on
the Stanford varsity field. Both
1 teams played heads-up ball, but
! California's lead, seized in the first
l inning, was too much for the Cards
! to overcome.
In the first inning the Hears
started scoring by converting one
hit into four runs. Kuechler, who

started on the mound for Stanford,
hit Sanchez, the first man to face
him, and the Cubs began to pile
up the runs. Johnson relieved
j Kuechler in the box at the start
!ot the second inning. Straight
| through to the ninth inning, John
son held the California batters at
1 bay, striking out eight men during
the entire game.
i It was in the third frame that
1 the Card yearlings came to life at
i the bat and scored their single
marker of the contest. Throughout
the game, the Stanford freshmen
had difficulty in connecting with
Saunders' offerings, and after the
third made no serious threats.
