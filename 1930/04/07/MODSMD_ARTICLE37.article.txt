Track, baseball, swimming, ten
nis, golf, in fact all the multitude
of spring sports have been relegat
ed to the back ground in favor of
that noblest sport of all axe steal
ing.
Although not on the listed sched
ule of legitimate athletic activity,
more interest was aroused in this
sport last Thursday night than in
the last ten Big Games combined.
Qualifications necessary for
success in this occupation are
numerous and varied. The var
sity axe-stealer must be an all
round athlete, possessing the
speed of a trackman, the de
ception and skillful thinking of
a "Pop" Warner quarterback,
and the punch of a heavy
weight boxer. This, plus de
termination and persistence,
and victory is won.
The suggestion of llie Palo Alto
Times that perpetrators of the
recent successful raid should be
granted honorary advanced degrees
is not without merit. But it is
hardly on the right track, for the
heroic twenty were not engaged
upon a scholastic but an athletic
venture.
Successful culmination of years
of careful planning ending with a
raid brilliantly executed in a man
ner which would do credit to a
Chicago "master mind" gangster
relieving a bunk of its gilt-edged
securities —should certainly not go
unrewarded.
What is more suitable than
that our varsity axe-stealers
should receive the customary
award of Block "S" letters?
As to the suggestion that the
axe should annually be placed in
possession of the Big Came winner
—never! For such action would
sound the death-knell of the most
fascinating game in Stanford-Cali
l'ornia competition.
Stanford has the axe, and the of
fensive is now up to California.
Let the wearers of the Blue and
Cold take their turn at staying up
nights contemplating the vision of
successful robbery.
The axe is Stanford's, arid
Stanford will keep the axe for
many long years. For the tal
ent that overcame bank vaults
and armored cars can keep an
axe as well as get one.
