## 3000 WATCH AXE FEUD CARRIED TO CALIFORNIA FIELD Bitterly Fought Game Won By Ninth-Inning Rally As Horner Stars 
### Howard Moore 
Two out in the last of the ninth
] and a one-run lead.
i Such was the situation when
California staged its usual ninth
| inning rally to shove across two
i tallies and win, by a score of 7
to fi, Hie first game of the annual
I Card-Bear three-game series. Over
3001) jammed into South Field in
, Berkeley, the largest crowd ever
: to witness a Pacific Coast Confer
| ence game.
The contest, was bitterly fought
throughout, California drawing up
| an early 4 to 1 lead only to have
tho Cards apparently win the game
| by piling up a <1-5 advantage by the
ninth inning. Cheer leading, card
board axes, jeering, hooting, and
j several fights were all in the day's
| work, as well as many evidences
: of unsportsmanship.
Cards Score First
The Cards drew first blood in
the first canto, Cutsluiw receiving a
I free ticket and traveling around on
| a passed ball and two sacrifice hits.
California retaliated with their first
marker, Kirwin walking and scor
; ing on two errors.
Berkeley made three more in the
| second frame when Horner singled
and Kirwin drew life on Berg's
| error. Williams walked and Horner
' scored on a passed ball, Kirwin
| and Williams crossing the platter
lon Burgett's hit. In the eighth
| chukker, Kirwin singled over short,
went, to second on a sacrifice, and
scored on Burgett's safe bingle.
Rintala Doubles
Stanford made two runs in the
I sixth. Story walking and scoring
i on Mears' hard liner to Horner,
! and the Card first-sacker ringing
the bell on Rintala's double to cen
ter. Another came in the seventh,
Hunken getting a free pass, going
i to third on Hard's pop bunt, and
sneaking across the plate on But
i ler's bad throw to Smith.
i The Cards went into the last in
i ning one run behind, but Churchill
| reached first on a fielder's choice
' and scored on Hardy's double to
Tight that Burgett booted. Hardy
tallied on Berg's single.
Then came the fateful rally. Cad
i dell struck out two pinch hitters
j and Horner sent up a high fly to
J right field. The ball dropped sate
and Kirwin and Williams walked
to fill the bags. Butler poled out a
| single to left, scoring Horner and
| Kirwin, and the game became his
j tory.
Rintala and Hardy were Stan
-1 lord's heavy men with the willow,
each getting two hits during the
fray. All credit, however, must go
to Horner, who pitched under what
must have been a terrific strain as
; well as hit safely three times out
I of five trips to the pan.
