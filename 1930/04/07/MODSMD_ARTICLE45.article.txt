# DINK DISSATISFIED WITH PROSPECTS FOR U.S.C. MEET
## Stanford Needs Practice And All the Breaks With Trojans 
### Bob Van Etten 
As yet far from satisfied with
prospects for the forthcoming dual
i meet with U.S.C., Templeton plans
j a busy week for his track and field
athletes before they climb on the
train for Occidental Thursday
; night.
All that Stanford needs to win
Saturday's engagement is to get
all the breaks. And getting all the
breaks in a track meet is some
; thing just about as rare as shoot
i ing three consecutive holes in one.
Dealing the expected final blow
to faint hopes that. Les Hables
might be able to compete this year,
i the Eligibility Committee last Fri- '
day disallowed Hables' application
for reinstatement. With this act
Stanford's chances for a second
place in the 440 are just about
wiped out, although Johnny Mor-
I rison is due to revenge his defeat
last year at the hands of Williams,
and place ahead of the speedy
Trojan quarter-mile trio.
Another Battle of the Century
is expected in both the 100 and i
220-yard events when Hec Dyer
meets Frank Wykoff, fourth-place
winner in the 100-meter event at
the last Olympic Games, who is
credited with more than one !• 3-5
race in the short dash. Wykoff, al
, though generally favored to "take"
the Card Sprinter in the century,
i will find his work cut out for him,
for Dyer has been showing remark
able development in getting away
from his starting blocks. The fur
long is anybody's race, and should
be run well under 22 seconds.
Dyer's strong finish gives him a ,
| slight edge, alt hough Wykoff has
made better time so far this year.
Templeton's chief troubles still
j appear the distance events. It is in
the 880, mile, and 2-mile grinds
that miracles must be performed
if the Trojans are to be downed.
