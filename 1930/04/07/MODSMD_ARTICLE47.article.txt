# EASTMAN STARS IN FROSH VICTORY OVER S.F. TEAM
## 
### 
Led by the Hying spikes of Ben
Eastman, the Stanford freshman
track team performed in sparkling
fashion to swamp the San Fran
cisco All-Stars beneath a 79 to 43
score. At that it was the closest
i meet the yearlings have had to
date.
It was "Bangs" Eastman who
j again turned in the most outstand
ing performance. He raced through
the quarter-mile in 48 1-5 seconds
and thereby lopped a fifth of a
second off his previous record. This
young sensation has now run the
two fastest four-forties recorded on
the coast this season and has al
ready stamped himself as one of
the greatest freshman quarter
milers in years.
Though none as remarkable as
that of Eastman's there were many
other good marks made in the
course of the meet. Here Laborde
j tossed the shot 4ii feet 11 inches.
Gray was right behind with 40
feet S inches. Both of these marks
are in the neighborhood of Eric
Krenz's freshman record.
Half-Mile
George Naylon managed to lunge
across the line a trifle in advance
of his running-mate, Frank Fullen
wider, to win the half-mile in the
fast, time of 2:01 4-5. Bob Hunter,
i frosh miler, had been ill and was
unable to run in his customary
; form. Lynch of Mission High won
the four-lap race in the good time
i of 4:4:1 3-5, and was closely fol
lowed by Mayer of Mission and
Novitsky of Poly High to make it
a clean sweep for the All-Stars.
Individual high-point honors
among the freshmen were shared
by three men, each of whom won
two events. Besides the shot La
borde won the discus with a throw
of 140 feet. 2 inches. Don Blackmail
maintained his consistensy in the
high jump by jumping 6 feet %
; inches and then won the broad
jump with a leap of 21 feet OVfe
inches. Alden Herbert took the high
, hurdles in 1G 3-5 seconds and the
lows in 25.9 seconds.
John Buchanan, capiain of the
Poly High team, led the All-Stars
in scoring. He won a close hun
dred in 10.3 seconds and ran off
with the two-twenty in 22.3 sec
onds. He also ran the last lap on
t he winning relay team. This relay,
however, was less of a race and
i

i more of a test of the untried•fresh
! man mile team which had not run ■
that distance prior to the meet. |
The All-Star team was composed of i
eight men, each of whom ran a
! two-twenty, while the yearlings ran
' four men, each of them running a
, J lour-forty.

Led by the Hying spikes of Ben
Eastman, the Stanford freshman
track team performed in sparkling
fashion to swamp the San Fran
cisco All-Stars beneath a 79 to 43
score. At that it was the closest
i meet the yearlings have had to
date.
It was "Bangs" Eastman who
j again turned in the most outstand
ing performance. He raced through
the quarter-mile in 48 1-5 seconds
and thereby lopped a fifth of a
second off his previous record. This
young sensation has now run the
two fastest four-forties recorded on
the coast this season and has al
ready stamped himself as one of
the greatest freshman quarter
milers in years.
Though none as remarkable as
that of Eastman's there were many
other good marks made in the
course of the meet. Here Laborde
j tossed the shot 4ii feet 11 inches.
Gray was right behind with 40
feet S inches. Both of these marks
are in the neighborhood of Eric
Krenz's freshman record.
Half-Mile
George Naylon managed to lunge
across the line a trifle in advance
of his running-mate, Frank Fullen
wider, to win the half-mile in the
fast, time of 2:01 4-5. Bob Hunter,
i frosh miler, had been ill and was
unable to run in his customary
; form. Lynch of Mission High won
the four-lap race in the good time
i of 4:4:1 3-5, and was closely fol
lowed by Mayer of Mission and
Novitsky of Poly High to make it
a clean sweep for the All-Stars.
Individual high-point honors
among the freshmen were shared
by three men, each of whom won
two events. Besides the shot La
borde won the discus with a throw
of 140 feet. 2 inches. Don Blackmail
maintained his consistensy in the
high jump by jumping 6 feet %
; inches and then won the broad
jump with a leap of 21 feet OVfe
inches. Alden Herbert took the high
, hurdles in 1G 3-5 seconds and the
