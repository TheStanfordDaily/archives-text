# U.C.L.A. VARSITY BEATS STANFORD TENNIS TEAM, 5-3
## Plymire, Weesner, Driscoll Winners in Games Played Friday 
### Sked Peck 
Whether the varsity tennis team
; had not yet recovered from the of
! l'eets of racketeering with tear
bombs the night before, or whether
j they suffered from lack of practice,
iis anybody's guess; but r.C.L.A.
I found a sadly off-form teaiu on the
j local courts Friday afternoon, and
; delivered a big upset to win three
matches out of five.
| Harry Plymire, third singles, and
i Chuck Weesner and Larry Dris
| roll, second doubles, came through
with the only wins of the day. Ted
East (an and Larry Hall lost first
and sAcond singles to Dworkin and
] Lewis, and, teamed together,
j dropped the first doubles to the
same pair. All the matches were
closely contested, and the meet
dragged along until six o'clock.
Both East on and Hall showed
flashes of normal form at times,
hut netted many easy shots and
were poor on placements. How
irver, Dworkin and Lewis are no
i inconsiderable competition, al
though they bowed to Meulheisen
and Meunch, respectively, of Cali
fornia last Thursday at Berkeley.
Dworkin played one of those tire
less, teasingly-steady games that
i most easily throw an opponent off
! his game. Easton, as is his cus
j torn, dropped the first set in a
| hurry, but failed to come back
j strongly enough to pull out the
| second. Hall took the second set
from his youthful opponent, Lewis,
but lacked steadiness in the third.
All four of thesv men appeared
tired in the first doubles tilt, al
| though they came through with
brilliant rallies occasionally.
Following are the complete re
j suits: First singles, Dworkin de
feated Easton. 6-1, second sin
gles, Lewis d. Hall. <1-4, 3-6, 6-4;
third singles, Plymire d. Itobbins,

Whether the varsity tennis team
; had not yet recovered from the of
! l'eets of racketeering with tear
bombs the night before, or whether
j they suffered from lack of practice,
iis anybody's guess; but r.C.L.A.
I found a sadly off-form teaiu on the
j local courts Friday afternoon, and
; delivered a big upset to win three
matches out of five.
| Harry Plymire, third singles, and
i Chuck Weesner and Larry Dris
| roll, second doubles, came through
with the only wins of the day. Ted
East (an and Larry Hall lost first
and sAcond singles to Dworkin and
] Lewis, and, teamed together,
j dropped the first doubles to the
same pair. All the matches were
closely contested, and the meet
dragged along until six o'clock.
Both East on and Hall showed
flashes of normal form at times,
hut netted many easy shots and
were poor on placements. How
irver, Dworkin and Lewis are no
i inconsiderable competition, al
though they bowed to Meulheisen
and Meunch, respectively, of Cali
fornia last Thursday at Berkeley.
Dworkin played one of those tire
less, teasingly-steady games that
i most easily throw an opponent off
! his game. Easton, as is his cus
j torn, dropped the first set in a
| hurry, but failed to come back
j strongly enough to pull out the
| second. Hall took the second set
from his youthful opponent, Lewis,
but lacked steadiness in the third.
All four of thesv men appeared
tired in the first doubles tilt, al
| though they came through with
brilliant rallies occasionally.
Following are the complete re
j suits: First singles, Dworkin de
feated Easton. 6-1, second sin
gles, Lewis d. Hall. <1-4, 3-6, 6-4;
third singles, Plymire d. Itobbins,
G-4, r>-7. 6-3; first, doubles, Dworkin
and Lewis d. Easton and Hall, S-G,
4-6, 6-2; second doubles, Weesner
and Driscoll d. Robbins and Stru
ble, 6-3, 3-6, 6-4.
