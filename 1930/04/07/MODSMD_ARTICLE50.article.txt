# Card Invaders Divert U.C. Mob To Campanile As Axe Departs
## 
### 
Stanford men. mixed together with (he Californians, raised
, their voices in protest against the axe theft from "(hose
guys from Stanford."
Surf that the axe was in Stanford's possession, the Cardinals
raised the cry, "Let's go up to the < anipanile and organize a pursuit
party!" The idea spread contagiously. "Campanile!" shouted the
mob, and up to the familiar spot of the I'.erkeley campus a thou
sand ( alifornians rushed.
Ruse Successful
This second ruse delayed immediate pursuit of the ear which
was racing toward the upper hay regions as 1.1 I as six sturdy
cylinders could carry it.
COntrary to reports, no Stanford student- were In Id n hostages
' by the ( a 1 i fornians.
l ifty minutes after the firsl uproar, the historical Stanford axe
was safe in the hands of a jubilant mob o! ' ardinals. It had been
speeded from Ilerkelev to Oakland to Milpitas across the Alyiso
cutoff 1o Mayfidd and then through tlie main entrance to the
1 campus.
The four in the car were driver, l.oofbourow,
Walsh, and Cage.

(These colorful incidents were veUiteil to a P ill.) reporter by
members of the Sequoia "twenty one" band that journeyed to
licrkcley and made the Im/fiest \\leal in Stanford < idifornia his
tory. )

On tho trip In I',(Holey tlie entire pnrty of would bo tliicvos
were jubilant and gay. Tlioy foil certain of success—almost cock
sure..
Street-corner cops wore kidded nnnicn ifully ; motor patrolmen
gayly greeted.
In ( )akland the trip was nearly postponed for another year
when one member of the raiding party saw a bewitching flapper
who gave him thai "come hither look.

For TToward Avery, that 190-pounder who jumped on 1 Tomer's
neck, the recovery of the Stanford axe was a family affair. JI is
mother bad been on the campus back in '<) ( ) when the California™
first obtained posse ;ion of the trophy. The first thing-he did on
his return Thursday evening was telegraph the glad tidings to his
mother.
"The closest jam in all my life"—that's the way Avery de
scribes his feelings when he was pushed into the Berkeley bank
bv the surging mob of bloodthirsty I'ears. Luckily, the tear gas
brought an imminent slaughter to an abrupt close.
A University of California professor of chemistry is re
ported to have thusly addressed his class Friday evening:
"Gentlemen: Recent events have shown the advantages
of chemical warfare."
With the treasured axe safely reposing in liis car, Jim Trim
niinghain roared out of the Berkeley hank vicinity so fast that
Warren < iage nearly fell out backwards. Gage's downfall was
prevented I>\ Kay W alsh who grabbed his partner by the leg.
A vote of thanks to < )akland, Berkeley, San Leandro, and way
points police and traffic officers was extended by the band of
"twenty-one. Xot a copper was in sight.
Jim Triinniint>ham, "the pride of Sunol racing circles," piloted
the roadster which speeded the precious axe back to the Farm.
Jim, who had never before heard the siren of a pursuing speed
cop, found last week a happy combination of luck and bad luck.
Twice lie \\ ;is stopped Monday. Hut Thursday night, when speed
was the order of the day, no John Law appeared on the scene.
A record of Trimmingham's speed record shows the fol
lowing times:
Telegraph Avenue—62 miles per hour
East Fourteenth Street in Oakland —73 miles per hour
Straight-away near Alvarado—B6 miles per hour
The "twenty one," after returning the rented car to Oakland,
w ere stopped at Dumbarton I 'ridge on their way home by irate Cal
supporters. The Blue and Cold behemoths refused to allow the
Stanfordites to pass by. Little Don lvropp, after arguing for a few
moments, stepped into his sedan and "gave er the g!ts." lie went
through.
Three other Stanford cars, following suit, rushed the passage
way. They were met with stones an dbrickbats. Several broken
windshields resulted—but the boys got through.
W hen the Stanford men reported the injuries caused by the
( alifornians a mob of Cardinals hastened to Dumbarton where the
Bears were quickly sent growling on their way home. Several
fistic engagements were reported.
Sequoia Mali was the scene of the first axe display after it was
brought onto the campus. A howling, shouting gang of Sequoia
men welcomed home the captors.
If any bill was ever more justified, the claim of $18.70
paid by the "twenty-one" for car rental should be recognized
by the Ex Committee.
Fear concerning the legality of the claim has been ex
pressed. The "twenty-one" didn't have an authorization for
the $18.70.
Trials and tribulations of the famous are many.
I lob Loofbourow. pursued by an insistent and determined
woman reporter irom a ST. newspaper, found it necessary to
leap out of a window'of the Mining Building to escape the in
creasing demands of the female.
Early Friday morning found the steps of Sequoia lined with
cameramen and newspaper reporters. All demanded "scoops, and
individual pictures of Loofbourow and Kropp.,
A special meeting of the "twenty-one" was held early Friday
morning. 4 A.M., to be exact. A "21 or none motto was adopted
by the baud concerning publicity.
Icrrv Bcltman, the Bull Montana of the "twenty-one," is re
ported to have left seven Cal Frosh in a perturbed and agitated
state. Ile snarled at them.

Not a blow was exchanged between members of the "twen
ty-one" and Californians. "Everything went too fast for any
fistic action," one of the band reported.
lini I'ursell, a member of the 1927 attempted raid, grabbed a
ribbon off the axe at that time but couldn't get anything more, lie
was one of the men who handed the axe to the vault custodian.
(ilen Brunson. after making sure that the Stanford car was
speeding awa\ with the axe, jumped up on the armored car and
harangued the Cal multitude with an impassioned plea .of "get
back that axe." t*
1 le even chased a California!! and accused him of taking the axe.
Ed Soares, another member of the intrepid gang, rode
through Berkeley most of Thursday evening with the Univer
sity of California Rally Committee searching for the axe.
The American Trust Company bank officials here suggested
t<> the Berkeley branch that they transfer the funds advanced by
C.C. for a vault in which to safeguard the treasured trophy. Their
demands were refused.
Howard Averv was almost thrown out <>t the (ii'cek I heat re
at Berkeley, lie ignited an old broom and was merrily keeping
time with it while the Californians were religiously singing their
livnm.
