# MAY TAKE 100 YEARS BUT AXE WILL BE RECOVEREDâ€”--SIBLEY, U.C.

; "California surely will attempt |
l to recover the Stanford Axe. It ;
I may take another :i 1 years and it i
I may take 100, but eventually the!
I feat will he accomplished." Such I
is the opinion of Robert Sibley,
I California '03, executive manager
> of the California Alumni Assoei-1
j ation, expressed Saturday morning:
; when he called at the Administra-;
i tion Building to congratulate Jack
| McDowell, '01, Alumni Secretary,!
j on the recapture of the famed sym
bol, and to pay his compliments to i
j Dob Loofbourow, one of Stanford's
heroic raiders,
I Sibley was tin first to advocate
I the use of tho Axe as a Big Game
; trophy when in 1924 as editor of
j the California Monthly, alumni pub
; licatiou, he printed an editorial]
| urging that as a solution of the I
j increasingly difficult problem of
, retaining the venerable weapon.
"This idea grew out of a con- j
'vernation with Eddie O'Neil, famed
California alumnus and now pro
fessor emeritus of chemistry
there." said Sibley. "I was severe
ly criticized at the time by mem
bers of the Association who were
in school at the time the Axe was
secured and the suggestion came 1
lto nothing.
"l'ete Kaarsburn. famous full

| buck of that memorable to o
! game, wrote me about the; editorial
i and stated that lie was opposed to
, the idea of making a Big Game
I trophy of the Axe.
"It is my opinion that some pol
icy should be enunciated settling
I the status of the symbol because
i the rivalry for its possession has
already entered the armored car
and tear bomb stage. I am afraid
that if the competition continues,
someone will be seriously injured,
i There is always the danger that
some over-enthusiastic raider will
| resort to the use of dynamite.
"Stanford's recovery of the Axe,
however, was a cleverly planned
and executed exploit, demonstrat
ing a marvelous spirit of rivalry
i between the two institutions and
j California's reprisal indicated a re
vival of fine competitive spirit. The
taking of trophies from Kncina. gym
! is to be regretted, but they certain
ly will be returned."
When questioned regarding the
I attitude California would take con
cerning the Use of their Golden
Bear as a Big Game trophy to
compt nsate Stanford for hazarding
the Axe, should that be done, Sib
-1 ley said, "I should not like to take
it upon myself to express an opin-
ion, but I shall suggest the idea at
a .meeting tomorrow and shall be
glad to report to Stanford the
reaction of California students and
alumni.
"However, I personally believe
that the affair should center strict
ly around the Axe. The Axe has
acquired a common ownership val
ue by virtue of California's long
possession and would make a
splendid trophy. Impressive cere
monies of presentation could be
arranged to follow each Big Game."
