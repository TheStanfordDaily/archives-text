It lias been proposed that Stanford put up its Axe as a l>ig
Game trophy, to be kept by the winner of the annual Card-Hear
football classic.
'I lie Stanford student body should consider well this plan
before acting favorably upon it.
'J he Axe is not and never was a trophy to be passed from
hand to hand. It is a symbol of Stanford just as Cardinal is a
symbol of Stanford. Ihe Axe and Stanford are inalienable.
It is no more reasonable to put up the Axe as a Big Game
trophy than it would be to put up the Cardinal colors as the
spoils of victory.
I !ie Axe is Stanford's Axe. It is not and never was Cali
fornia s. If the ancient weapon, returned home after 31 years,
were disposed of according to this proposal, it would be a game
of "Heads 1 win, tails you lose." California would be the win
ner; Stanford the loser.
II men and women here on the Farm are inclined to treat
this matter seriously, they should propose that California put up
her Golden Jiear along with the Cardinal Axe as a Dig Game
trophy. Would not that be more equable, more reasonable?
Xo matter what is done, the wishes of that intrepid band of
21 should have much weight in governing the decision. If a
tradition is to be originated in this connection, those who made
possible such a tradition should be consulted.
Xo spirit of collegiate animosity dictates the Daily's stand in
this matter; nor any idea of sophomoric rivalry. It is simply
common sense.
