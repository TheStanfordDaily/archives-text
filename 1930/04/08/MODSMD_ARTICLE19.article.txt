# PHI BETA KAPPA TO HEAR GEOLOGIST ON RECENT DISCOVERIES
## 
### 
Inaugurating a series of infor
j mal meetings, the Stanford chapter
J of Phi Beta Kappa will convene in
i the Men's Faculty Club at 7:30
| o'clock Thursday to hear an ad
dress by Mailey Willis, Professor
Emeritus of Geology, on his recent
geological explorations in Africa.
The meeting will be the first
of a group of activities planned by
the chapter in an attempt to make
the society a more active force in
University life, according to Pro
fessor Samuel S. Seward, vice
president, of the organization. It
has been felt that the society has
come to symbolize the granting of
scholastic honors only, and the
present movement is an attempt to
give an active meaning to its mem
, hers while they are in the Univer
jsity. Professor Seward stated.
Phi Beta Kappa way originally
I founded as an association of a few
| students who came together in
j campus life through debating and
j other similar activities, Seward de
-1 dared. There was no intention at
I the time to make it an honor-grant
ing organization.
There has been a general move
ment throughout the country dur
ing the last few years to bring the
organization back to its original
fellowship basis. This movement
! culminated at Stanford in the re
i vision of the Chapter's constitution
| last year, granting more power to
j Ihe undergraduate members, and
j making it possible to elect them
j earlier in their junior and senior
! years.
