### 
nOMIJAY, India, April 7. (A>) â€”Three of Mahatma Gandhi's chief lieuteu
ants in his civil disobedience campaign against the Indian govern
ment, and many local leaders and volunteers in different Indian districts
were under arrest tonight as the aftermath to the Mahatma's overt
violation of the salt, monopoly on Dandi Beach yesterday.
The Nationalist leader himself remained at liberty, and in spite of a
scuffle that took place between his followers and the police near Dandi

<s>today, announced lie would como
I in person tomorrow to collect salt
with (lie volunteers.
Humors in Bombay nave the im
pression that Gandhi's arrest was
imminent, and that he might be
taken into custody when he goes
! to Aat tomorrow.
Several minor encounters oc
;( lu red at widely scattered points
between Gandhi followers and the
police, but there were no disorders
on a large scale. The only situation
that threatened danger was a clash
between police and workmen in
the Mysore gold mines, near Ban
galoge, which was not directly con
nected with the civil disobedience
I campaign.
Casualties
There were 50 casualties in the
i clash. Striking workers, who num
ber (5,000 in all, stoned officials and
were fired upon by the police. A
squadron of (lie Mysore lancers and
police reinforcements were dis
i patched to the mines, which are in
| southern India.
The first judicial sentence of any
severity that has been passed on
violators of the sail monopoly was
meted out today at Madiad, one of
, the towns where Gandhi stopped
on his march from Ahmadabad to
j Dandi.
A magistrate there imposed
terms of two years' imprisonment
and fines of 500 rupees (about
$100) on three of Gandhi's ablest
i aides, who broke the law by col
lecting salt in the Kaira district.
Today was Gandhi's weekly
1 period for silence and meditation.
He was therefore not present when
the police made a descent upon
volunteers collecting salt on the
beach at Aat, but came down soon
afterward from Dandi, which is
slose by.
