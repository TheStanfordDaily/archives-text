# SAUTER DEFEATS ST. IGNATIUS HANDBALL CHAMP 21-5, 21-11
## 
### 
John Sauter, stellar Card hand
ball .sia r, yesterday defeated Cle
cach, the St. Ignatius College
champion, on (he St. Ignatius
courts, in straight sets by a score
of 21-5, 21-11. This match is the
first of a series of special encount
ers to determine the individual
championship of the three institu
tions of Stanford, St. Ignatius, and
the University of California.
Although Sauter won the first
two sets, Ciecach requested a third
set which Sauter won, 21-7. Since
the matches were played on the
Grey Fog courts, Sauter's victory
came as a surprise since he had
been defeated by Ciecach last quar
ter on neutral .ground, but shows
that Sauter was severely handi
capped by illness during the hand
ball encounter of the past season.
Sauter will meet Murray, sensa
tional St. Ignatius freshman, in a
special match some time this week.
