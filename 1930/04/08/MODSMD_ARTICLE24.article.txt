# HISTORY OF RELIC HAS NEW ADDITION
## 
### 
Julius Peterson, former foreman !
of the Stanford forge, claims that [
the Stanford hxh had a more un
usual origin than is generally he- j
Moved. Tile accepted version is that
K. I<\ Weisshaar purchased the wea
pon in San Francisco for the spe
cial purpose of making it a symbol
for the axe yell, hut according to
Peterson, who was on the campus
in the early days, the blade was !
found in the late '80's by workmen I
digging a pipeline between the j
Quad and Iloble, having probably '
been dropped there In pioneer '
times by lumbermen.
The boss of the workmen gave |
the axe to Peterson who kept it I
in his forge for a time until it
was stolen one night by students,
to be brought out again in '.'lO for
the now famous rally on the site
of the Library.
