\'alu rally enough the L niversity of California partisans have |
l< lit their whole-hearted support to the proposal that Stanford do-|
nate its Axe as a l»ig (lame trophy.
I lie plan is a splendid one -from the California point of view. I
lint looking at it from a Stanford angle, the proverbial horse as- |
sumcs a different hue.
Ihe reasons for this change of color are all too ohvious. Some !
were stated in yesterday's issue of this newspaper; others may he
found in the multitude of campus opinion letters which have
poured into the Daily office.
Student sentiment seems definitely opposed to the proposal ;
alumni opinion promises to he of the same tenor; and now that
the historic "( ommittee of 21' has come out with the express wish
that the ancient weapon he kept as a perpetual Stanford emblem,
there can be no doubt as to which course to take.

II is interesting to note the arguments advanced by Robert Sib- |
ley. executive manager of the California Alumni Association, who J
has long favored the plan of using the Axe as a trophy.
Mr. Sibley is undoubtedly sincere in his stand, as he advocated
such a move even before Stanford regained its own. l>ut granting
bis sincerity, it is hard to follow Mr. Sibley's arguments, now that
the Axe has been brought back where it belongs.
Says California's alumni manager: "The Axe has acquired a
common ownership value bv virtue of C alifornia's long posses
sion. . . .
Would Mr. Sibley be of the same mind if someone had stolen
<ash or securities from him and managed to keep them for three
decades? One hardly thinks so.
Dr. R. C. Sproul, who is to be next president of the I'nivcrsity
of California, made a typical California rejoinder when asked his
opinion of the plan to have the (iolden l'»ear placed upon the sacri
ficial altar along with the Axe.
"It would be far too complicated," he declared.
Which is a very nice way of saving that Californians have'
sense enough to keep their emblem for themselves.
