# MODESTY AMONG HEROES

Twenty-one or nothing.
That was the unselfish policy formulated hy Stanford's hrainy |
gang of axe-snatchers shortly after they made their victorious re
turn to the campus.
It was agreed hy the raiders that all photos should lie group
ones, that publicity should stress group action and not individual
glorification.
It was a noble idea, difficult, of course, to execute in all its
ramifications, but carried out by members of the twenty-one as
faithfully as possible.
The brains back of the coup and the ringleaders of the episode
turned the spotlight of publicity upon confederates who played
minor roles in the most spectacular drama ever staged in Pacific
â€¢ oast intercollegiate history.
Secretly and silently the twenty one Stanford students planned
Ihe momentous "steal" from I'erkeley; modestly and humbly they
are accepting the thanks and praise of all Stanford.
