THE BLUE GHOST—At the Presi
dent Theatre, San Francisco.
A ureal deal of horse play, good-
I humored hoax, and laughs made
: "The Blue Ghost" a hit willi the
extremely youthful audience which
i attended its first performance,
I "Mystery," however, is not the
play's long suit. It is a much bet
ter comedy than it is a thriller,
"The Blue Ghost" is spookiuess
in mass production. Quantities of
; ghosts, murders, secret passages,
| and dark rooms are turned out in
i every scene, and the action is fairly
j lively. Practically every mystery
i gag In the show business is pulled
off at some time or other, while
i some of the old standhys> such as
| sudden extinguishing of all the
| lights, or long, shuddering screams
i from hidden pasageways, are half
'the plot. And yet even this doesn't
keep you from having not there-
I molest idea of what is going to
| happen next and since something
j very vigorous always does happen,
| you stay awake.
j The play is a merry-go-round
j of strange disappearances, and
stranger re-appearances—going at
i a very rapid rate. Any five minutes
of this nightmare never misses in
| eluding at least half the following:
ja weird, blue spectre-skeleton
| ing around a dark room; the hero
! ine being stabbed or gagged or
j chloroformed, and shrieking for
j Frank, while Frank plunges in and
j out of trick entrances; Inspector
| Wise magnificently doing the
| wrong thing; and the darkey ser-
I vant of the play yowling agoriizedly
i that, he is being killed.
Then there is a slit-eyed, claw
, lingered fiend who creeps around
the stage and is responsible for
j some bona-fide heart-stops in the
j audience. As to acting, however,
I the negro Jasper is the best of the
cast. Mis dialogue is exceptionally
clever, and his clowning is the fea
ture of the play.
Don't be misled by the advertise
ments. "The Blue Ghost." is rip
roaring enough, but you don't have
to be blas6 to find if not in the
least blood-curdling. M. L. 11.

THE BLUE GHOST—At the Presi
dent Theatre, San Francisco.
A ureal deal of horse play, good-
I humored hoax, and laughs made
: "The Blue Ghost" a hit willi the
extremely youthful audience which
i attended its first performance,
I "Mystery," however, is not the
play's long suit. It is a much bet
ter comedy than it is a thriller,
"The Blue Ghost" is spookiuess
in mass production. Quantities of
; ghosts, murders, secret passages,
| and dark rooms are turned out in
i every scene, and the action is fairly
j lively. Practically every mystery
i gag In the show business is pulled
off at some time or other, while
i some of the old standhys> such as
| sudden extinguishing of all the
| lights, or long, shuddering screams
i from hidden pasageways, are half
'the plot. And yet even this doesn't
keep you from having not there-
I molest idea of what is going to
| happen next and since something
j very vigorous always does happen,
| you stay awake.
j The play is a merry-go-round
j of strange disappearances, and
stranger re-appearances—going at
i a very rapid rate. Any five minutes
of this nightmare never misses in
| eluding at least half the following:
ja weird, blue spectre-skeleton
| ing around a dark room; the hero
! ine being stabbed or gagged or
j chloroformed, and shrieking for
j Frank, while Frank plunges in and
j out of trick entrances; Inspector
| Wise magnificently doing the
| wrong thing; and the darkey ser-
I vant of the play yowling agoriizedly
i that, he is being killed.
Then there is a slit-eyed, claw
, lingered fiend who creeps around
the stage and is responsible for
j some bona-fide heart-stops in the
j audience. As to acting, however,
I the negro Jasper is the best of the
cast. Mis dialogue is exceptionally
clever, and his clowning is the fea
ture of the play.
Don't be misled by the advertise
ments. "The Blue Ghost." is rip
roaring enough, but you don't have
to be blas6 to find if not in the
least blood-curdling. M. L. 11.
MONTANA MOON—At the New
Stanford Theatre.
| "Montana Moon" is living proof
j that the old-lime romantic drama
I is not quite dead. The plot is rather
| hopelessly flimsy and improbable
j the kind usually found in musical

I comedies. But those who like ro
mance, Joan Crawford, good come
dians, and beautiful photography
will get a good evening's entertain-
I meat out of this picture.
('lil'l Edwards and Benny Hubin
furnish the comedy, and, as usual, j
} do a very efficient job of it. Audi- J
j ences who see "Montana Moon" ,
will not soon forget the patent 1
I medicine seller portrayed by Ru- •
bin, or Sam, not to mention little
Sam, equine characters feelingly j
| spoken of by Cliff Edwards.
The music of the piece is of the j
first order, always logical. An ex- i
j cellent men's chorus sings two!
numbers rich in melody. And the 112
theme song is a lovely thing. Cliff
Edwards is there with his ukulele,
'and Joan Crawford's voice is as i
pleasing ever.
The star is her usual self, at
times piquant, at others alluring,,
'sophisticated, vibrant. Johnny Mack I
Brown, ori the other hand, gives aj
! most disappointing performance.;
But perhaps he should not be ,
i blamed for it, because lie had very i
little to work with. From the story j
j one gathers that a cowboy is aj
j rather slow-moving gentleman with
j a southern accent who uses bad j
i grammar. —V. 15.
