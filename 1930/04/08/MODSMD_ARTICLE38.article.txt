Epic events should call l'ovlh
epics. So far no one has written a
saga of the Axe. But here are a
! couple of printable verses to "A
Son of a Ganibolier."
The first is to he sung as a chant
with solos:
All:
I Oh there's a road to Berkeley
As plain as plain can be.
Mr. Horner:
And if you want to see a wreck
Just take a look at me.
The Hoys:
For we have been to Berkeley
And brought the Axe back home.
Mr. Hudson:
And that is why we Hate and Hate
"Ye Author":
And why WE write this pome.
The other verse has, perhaps,
| more value for practical use:
Oh here's to Norman Horner
The Guardeen of the Axe

' He swore he'd keep it safe and
sound
—and other funny cracks.
And here's to California
Where the color of life is blue. I
Now Stanford's got the Stanford
axe
What will poor Berkeley do?

tional story tells of California's :
frantic search.
And there was a little space left
before the ails.
