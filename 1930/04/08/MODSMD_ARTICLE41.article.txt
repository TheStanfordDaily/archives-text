spending iiiÂ»- winter, tells the
story:
"His life's dream realized,
lloom Dm mm passed joyfully
away, not out, early this morn
ing when news reached him
of sturdy Stanford's stalwart
recovery of Old Brawn the
Axe. He started to chortle
with great, triumphant glee,
and continued to laugh up
roariously, though dead.
"Imagine our embarrass
ment ! As a consequence, we
are forced to bury the old
codger in the red, red sod
under the boathouse pier.
However, his battling warrior
spirit will return with every
Stanford-California conflict.
"'Keep it up, boys!' were
bis last words, 'you are world
beaters'. "
