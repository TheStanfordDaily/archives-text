# FROSH TO ELECT CAPTAIN TONIGHT FOR MEET FRIDAY
## 
### 
Coach Bill Ellington's freshman
track squad will gather in Room 45
of the Board of Athletic Control
Building tonight at 7:30 to elect
a captain who will lead the year
lings against the California fresh
men in their annual meet on the
Berkeley oval Friday afternoon.
The California-Stanford freshman
meet Friday promises to he one of
the best in recent years and may
perhaps develop into as close a bat
tle as that of last year when the
Card babes won 60 to 65. Two of
the strongest yearling squads ever
to represent either institution will
be facing each other. On the basis
of past performances the Stanford
team has been installed a slight
favorite to win, but both teams
have been winning the practice
meets by top-heavy scores.
