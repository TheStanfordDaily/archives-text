# Cards, Trojans Doped On A Par in Field
## STANFORD FIGURED STRONG FAVORITES IN WEIGHT EVENTS Dope Sheet Grants Cards 28-26 Edge in Field; U.S.C. Dangerous 
### Bob Van Etten 
Men to participate in the U.S.C.
and California freshman meets will
be named by Coach Dink Temple
ton at a meeting of varsity and
freshman track squads to be held
at 7:30 tonight in Room 40 of the
Board of Athletic Control Building.

Field events, long the stronghold
of Cardinal supremacy can hardly
be depended upon for material as
sistance in taming the Trojans at
Occidental next Saturday, for both
squads appear about evenly pro
vided with talent for the proceed
ings inside the oval.
Although well-fortified in the
weights by the ever able Messrs.
Krenz and Kothert, Templeton's
men face enormous difficulties in
the pole vault, javelin, and high
jump. Only in the broad jump does
there appear an even chance for
the Redshirts to collect a majority
of points.
An attempt to forecast results
of the six field events, basing con
clusions almost entirely on past,
performance, results in getting the
Cardinals off to a meagre lead of
2S to 20 points.
Continuing their assaults on the
existing world's record in the shot
put, Rothert and Krenz are cer
tain, barring the possibility of
breaking their business arms, to
place one, two, probably in the
order named. Interest in this event,
aside from the chance of a new
world mark, centers largely in the
duel between Herb Fleishhacker
and flail of Southern California.
Hall lias made the best record to
date, heaving the iron ball 48 feet
10VL- inches against California, but
Herb's deep and abiding intention
of besting his Trojan rival may
cause an upset. Call it Stanford 8,
U.S.C. 1 in this event.
Krenz Safe in Discus
World's champion Eric Krenz
should successfully hold off any
assaults on his laurels and add five
more points to the Stanford total
in the discus. The battle for second
place will again find Hall, who is
credited with a 148-foot, toss, com
ix ting against. Grey and Rothert
of the Cards. Grey, an up-and-com
ing discus man, has bettered 150
feet in practice, and should nose
out his Trojan rival, while Rothert
has an even chance of sneaking
one over and giving the Cardinals
a clean sweep. Again call it Stan
ford 8, U.S.C. 1.
With both Snider and Mortenson
heaving the spear beyond the 190-
foot mark, Stanford's chances in
the javelin appear decidedly slim.
Mortenson, however, is favoring a
bad shoulder, while Snider last
week against L.A.A.C. went into a
slump with a slightly over 180 feet
his best effort. Rothert, who tossed
the Greek weapon 178 feet in the
intorelass meet, is capable of get
ting one out far enough to collect
a second. Goldsmith, the remaining
Card spear-tosser. will have to add
a good many feet to his best dis
tance to get in the money. Give
Stanford 3 and U.S.C. <i.
A peculiar situation exists in the
high jump. Van Odsel, who three

weeks ago was reported as clear
ing (i feet 7% inches against Cali
j fornia, could negotiate nothing
; higher than 5 feet 11 inches, which
jliis teammate Hill a:so cleared.
| Stanford's trio of high-jumpers, Al
i lan, Madison, and French, have at
' various times flirted with G feet
j but can hardly he called consistent
J at this height. Allowing Van Odsel
I a first, and dividing the remaining
i points, Stanford collects 3 and
! U.S.C. 6.
Duel in Broad Jump
In the broad jump Dowel 1 of
Stanford and Barber of Southern
California should put on an inter
i esting duel. Barber's best season
mark of 24 feet 2% inches is only
an inch or so farther than Powell's
greatest effort to date. West, al
though his record this year has
I been poor, is a dangerous competi
tor, and may easily jump into the
money. (Jive Stanford 5, and IT.S.C.
i 4.

If Hubbard and Livingston of
Southern California can duplicate
their 1?. feet 6 inch and 1". feet
3 inch vaults made against Cali
fornia the Trojans -will capture
first and second in iliis event,
i Berry, Templeton's best bet with
the elongated toothpick, has much
difficulty in getting over 13 feet,
while DeGroot has yet to attain
I this heightâ€”l for Stanford and 8
for U.S.C.
A survey of the track events in
' tomorrow's Daily will complete the
I forecast.
