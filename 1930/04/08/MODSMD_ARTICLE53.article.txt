# HE STOLE THE SHOW...
## Little John Risko Back Into Picture After Moral Victory Over Campolo, South American 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Down at Miami, where, Sharkey
and Scott put on their Flop'of the
Century on Fehruhry 27, the best
fighter on the card was none other
than our old friend Rubbery Blub*
bery Jawn Risko, Cleveland baker
boy, and only recently barred from
fighting Victorio Campolo in New
j York because —lieh, heli, heli! —he
| wasn't PIG enough! Johnny, being
:a little fellow and only standing
; five feet ten and one-half inches,
land weighing one hundred and
ninety pounds, was no fit match
{for Campolo, the South American
| string-bean, who outweighed him
I some thirty pounds anil stood a
mere eighrt inches taller. At least
I that's what Boxing Commissioner
William Muldoon said, and what
the Czar of Boxing decrees usually
I goes as a law around the Metro
polis, even though the eommis
| sioners are not supposed to be
| matchmakers.
But what happened? Matchmaker
; Tom McArdle of the Garden was
| peeved and put the match on as a
semi-final to the Scott-Sharkey
J thing in Florida. It will go down

|in history as a draw, bul the boxing
! writers were unanimous in declar
ing Risko the winner, many giving
him all but the lirst and last
rounds. The big Argentine forgot
all the boxing he knew as Johnny
began to wallop him with lefts and
rights, and the plump baker boy,
who is one of the few heavyweights
around who has the idea of giving
the fans a run for their money,
j far outshone the evening's head
liners. Risko, thought, to be all
through after his technical K.O. by
; Schmeling, and bis defeats by
I Tuffy Griffiths last year, jumped
back into the heavyweight picture
by his astounding battle against
the tall Gaucho.
Wonder what Muldoon thinks
now after Risko has shown the
'world that he is plenty big enough
for Campolo or any other giant. I
bet lie could beat Camera right
j now, before breakfast! Hut it was
ridiculous?, wasn't it, to bar poor
j little Johnny, who had only de-
I feated Paulino, Sharkey. Godfrey,
I Von Porat. and Maloney, from fight
ing that big boy in New York! Ileh,
I heh, heli!
