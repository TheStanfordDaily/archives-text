through a still workout yesterday
in preparation for today's game
with the I'.C.L.A. nine scheduled
lor 3:15 o'clock ,on the local dia
mond. The contest will be the
third and last between the two
teams, the Cardinals having won
the two previous encounters down
south.
Ai present the Urnins are undis
puted custodians of the Conference
cellar with a percentage of .250.
Westwoud has defeated Santa
Clara twice, which in turns is the
only aggregation that lias beaten
U.S.C., so by that analysis I'.C.L.A.
is not as weak as it seems. The
Cards hatted in ti-2 and 13-4 vic
tories over the southerners, and
should repeal with a third triumph, j
but no baseball game can be doped
out beforehand until t he* last man
is out.
Wolter plans to shift the teams
about, largely due to the gap left
in center Held by ltintala's inability
to play. The big sophomore
sprained his. leg sliding into sec

; and will be out for a few days.

Nothing daunted by California's 1
"Christmas gift." Wist Sitfunlay,
Stanford's baseball varsity went
through a still workout yesterday
in preparation for today's game
with the I'.C.L.A. nine scheduled
lor 3:15 o'clock ,on the local dia
mond. The contest will be the
third and last between the two
teams, the Cardinals having won
the two previous encounters down
south.
Ai present the Urnins are undis
puted custodians of the Conference
cellar with a percentage of .250.
Westwoud has defeated Santa
Clara twice, which in turns is the
only aggregation that lias beaten
U.S.C., so by that analysis I'.C.L.A.
is not as weak as it seems. The
Cards hatted in ti-2 and 13-4 vic
tories over the southerners, and
should repeal with a third triumph, j
but no baseball game can be doped
out beforehand until t he* last man
is out.
Wolter plans to shift the teams
about, largely due to the gap left
in center Held by ltintala's inability
to play. The big sophomore
sprained his. leg sliding into sec
| ond base in the California game
; and will be out for a few days.
■ "lied" Berg will patrol the center
i garden and Perry Churchill will
i take over the hot corner. The rest,
i of'the infield and outfield will be

'the usual lineup. Four of the
pitchers will see action during to
day's till, Leverenz probably gut
ting the first call, with Story,
Loomis, and Caddell going in later.
The only other casualty to the

right hand. Undoubtedly Taylor's
