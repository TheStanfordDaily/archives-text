Mr. and Mrs. Calvin Coolidge will abandon the little two-family house where they have resided for
many years to take up more spacious quarters in a 16-room mansion known in Northampton, Mass., as
"The Beeches." The estate has nine acres, an outdoor swimming pool and tennis courts. The house
contains four baths, an elevator and telephone connections on each floor.
