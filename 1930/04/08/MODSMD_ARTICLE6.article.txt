# DAILY SPONSORS "DOPE" CONTEST
## 
### Grenville Jones 
Whether Stanford or U.S.C. wins
Saturday's dual meet will be settled
down at Occidental. Can "Dink"
pull a miracle, or will the Trojans'
flock of champions smother the
Redshirts? What do you think?
Prophecies optimistic and pessi
mistic, biased or impartial, will be
gratefully received by the Daily's
Sports Department. What we want,
are dope sheets.
Efforts of campus predictors will
not go unrewarded, for substantial
prizes are offered by Palo Alto
merchants to the most accurate
guessers. First prize of a pair of
English shoes, retailing at $10 or
more, will be presented by Plielps-
Terkel to the winning prophet. A
five-dollar money order is offered
by Itoos Brothers to the second
best guesser.
Women's Prize
For the fair sex, a special prize
of a three-pound box of chocolates
is offered by Wilson's. And winning
this prize does not. eliminate the
deserving co-ed from receiving con
sideration in awarding the first and
second prizes.
All registered students, with the
exception of those on the Daily
staff, and faculty members may
enter this dope contest. Score
counts first. In case of agreement
on the final score, students most
accurately predicting place-winners
will receive the prizes.
Dope sheets indicating winners
of all three places in each event
must be in the mail, addressed to
the Sports Editor, Stanford Daily,
or delivered to the Daily office, by
noon, Friday.
