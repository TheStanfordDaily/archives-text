sponsored by its sports department. Predictions of the meet should
give the complete list of places in each event in order to qualify for
the prizes, and must be in the mail or delivered to the Daily office by

announcement of the contest. Most of I hem favor the Trojans, while a
few optimistic souls give Stanford the edge by a slim margin. The

> following is a sample dope sheet

predicts a Trojan triumph by 41

the predictions submitted. His
guess is:

Maurer (SC); 220—Wykoff (SC),

The winners will be rewarded

pair of ten-dollar English shoes
donated by Phelps-Terkel. Second
prize is offered by Roos Brothers
and consists of a five-dollar money
order. The fair sex will not go un
rewarded, for not only do they get
a chance to win the first and sec
ond prizes, but Wilson's is donating
a three-pound box of chocolates ex
clusively for their benefit.
All registered students except
those on the Daily staff are eligible
to compete, as well as faculty mem
bers. Score is counted first, but in
case of agreement on the point
total, those most accurately pre
dicting place-winners will be judged
successful.
