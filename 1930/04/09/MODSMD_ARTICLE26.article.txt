LANSING, Mich., April 8. (/?')
A dead man may not vote legally in
the state of Michigan.
A resident of Owosso, ill in a
hospital, sent for an absent voter's
ballot, marked it, and had it mailed
to the city clerk. He died before
yesterday's city election. The clerk
of Shiawassee county asked the <it
torney general whether the vote
could be counted. Attorney General
Brucker ruled that a man's ballot
can not be counted in an election
held after he is dead.
