# USE A GRAIN OF SALT

### 
With the Axe furore still raging, a large portion of the male !
contingent of Stanford's student hody is getting set to work up a'
great lather over that colossal tribulation which besets fratcrnitv
men and freshmen each springâ€”rushing.
This Axe business, incidentally, came as a great boon to rushers
and rushees. As a topic of conversation, during painful dinner
and luncheon dates, it will be immense, even exceeding llie weather
or the athletic prowess of brother Zilch.
\s the < ireek brethren already know, and as the yearlings will
soon learn, rushing is the most heinous crime ever perpetrated upon |
suffering mankind. When someone discovers the secret of perpetual i
motion, it would be swell if be could, at the same time, turn in a!
system whereby freshmen might be pledged without the aw fill |
formula which is now the vogue.
Seriously (and. paradoxically ), the best advice which the Daily!
can presume to offer to inhabitants of Kncina I iall is to avoid too '
much seriousness in this tiling. After all, fraternities and rushing
are not life and death matters.
Don't swallow everything you hear, whether it be for or against
fraternities; whether it be for or against any particular fraternity.
I se your own eyes and vour own mind. It is your college life, re
member. Map it out for yourself.
