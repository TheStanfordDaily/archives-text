College men of high intellectual and moral qualities are being
-ought by the Department of Justice for positions in the prison |
-f-rvice of the government, according to a recent announcement
issued from W ashington. The task of guarding recalcitrant mem
bers of the human race and administering to their welfare is to he
made a recognized profession, if somebody will recognize it as
ltdi. Superintendent of Prisons Sanford Bates is hiring college
••raduates to this occupation by dignifying it as a profession.
Besides getting .S|f)2o per year to start as a guard, the college
graduate will get a broad socialized viewpoint on penology. There
are also guard positions paying as high as $2100. If enough train
ing is acquired, the government will someday promote the guards to
executive positions which carry remunerations varying from $2100
to $7000 per year. There are allowances which add to the total
yearly salaries.
With Stanford poised and ready to eliminate the Lower Division 1
right off the collegiate map, the announcement of Mr. Bates' comes j
as good news. Dr. W ilbur and the Board of Trustees are uudoubt (
i dlv immersed already in the discussion of plans lor the founding j
of :t graduate school for prison guards.
( )ne difficulty presents itself, however, in the high cost of elec
iric chairs and machine guns for a well equipped laboratory.
