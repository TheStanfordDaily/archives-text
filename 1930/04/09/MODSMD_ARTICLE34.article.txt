# CALIFORNIA'S REACTION

I or the benefit of those who have subscribed to the vapid theory
that the Stanford Axe should be turned into a trophy for the Big
Came winner, the Daily is printing today the following editorial
from its transbay contemporary, the Daily (alifoniian:
"Suggestions have been many as to what Stanford should do j
with the Ax. Some, we are sorn to say, are reported of the lips I
of Californians.
"If the Stanford students decide they would like to place the
\x as a trophy for the Big (lame or the baseball series, that is a
matter for them to propose. The answer of our Executive Com-;
mittee should, of course, be 'No!'
"But when men in more or less responsible positions on this
campus take it upon themselves to make such a suggestion they
are being, to say the very least, unrepresentative. According to
newspaper accounts, several men of differing prominence have been
quoted to the effect that Stanford should put up the Ax as a Big
Came trophy. I wen if this were a good proposal, which it is not,
the presentation of it hv any ' alifoniian is neither sportsmanlike or
tactful. And, in all events, the students should be the ones consulted
on the matter.
"For .31 years the Ax has stood for something more than the!
winning of a football game, has held a place dearer to C alifornia
hearts than any mere trophy could hold. It has been a symbol, and j
its yearly vision has been a hallowed occasion. Now it is gone, but
for it to be relegated to the same category with the meaningless bits |
of silverware given as prizes for winning games would be a tragic
insult to its grand history.

will be. And its taking should honor its memory: the splendid past
should be repeated when Californians some day restore the \x to
the campus which has become home to it. But a mere trophy chang
