The Editor, Sir:
The brilliant suggestion of some
\ bright minds of (lie Stanford stu
dent body tluit OUK Axe, that most
1 precious emblem of Stanford Spirit,
i he donated as a trophy to be award
| nil to Hie winner of ihn Big (lame
is not only the most ridiculous hut
also the shallowest thought yet
j produced hy this University.
I In Hit- first place, the Axe js OUR
1 Axe, not theirs, and rightfully be
longs right here in Palo Alto. He
! cause it has been so long absent
i from its natural habitat in no way
I reduces OUIt right to its owner
j ship.
j The esteem and spirit which
Mhe Axe represents was clearly
demonstrated by the events of last
Thursday nighl. Yet it is suggested
] that this symbol in which Stanford
; Spirit reaches its apex shall be re
j linriuished to our arch-enemy. Does
j any sane-minded Stanford cohort
| really feel that we should sacrifice
our most inspiring token simply
to make an ostentation of good
: sportsmanship thai would probably
| he unappreciated by all parties
concerned? Shall we take a step
that may he regretted by genera
j lions of Stanfordites for genera
tions to come? Shall we cheapen
the value of the Axe until it is
j practically worthless? Are we
j afraid lhal we cannot bold the Axe
j against future; attacks that have
already been promised in no 1111-
certain terms? And by what right
: shall we who are now students at
[ Stanford pass upon the final dis
j position of the Axe? lias not every
i Stanford alumnus just, as much
right to be heard on this vilul fjues-
I tion ?
Let us not act hastily and un
wisely. W. E. Keepil.
j The Editor, Sir:
What's all this noise about put
ting the axe up as a Hig (J utile
trophy? After it lias been the ambi
tion of every red-blooded Stanford
man for the past thirty-one years
! to regain the axe, why should we
! immediately put it up as a symbol
I of victory and give Cal a chance
! to win it back at the next Hig
! (lame? The axe never did legally
i belong to (California. They stole it
J from us. We merely regained what
; was rightfully ours, and did it in a

clcan, sportsmanlike manner, even
though California lias accused as
of using "Chicago methods." (Sure
ly, tear gas bombs don't sound
nearly so Chicago-like as armored
cars.)
From California's point of view,
putting the axe up as a trophy
would he just, like saying, "Heads
I win! tails you lose." They have
everything to gain and nothing to
lose by such a proposition. I don't
mean that we should act as they
have, and guard the axe like a
miser does his sack of gold, but let
them meet us half- way. We don't
have to put if up as a trophy un
less we want to, and we can keep
il as long as they did if we use
our heads as well as the fellows
who captured it.
If the ('alifornians want to show
more sportsmanship than some of
their mem hers have already done
in raiding our trophy room, and if
they want us lo he so big-hearted,
let them put up the golden bear
as a wager against the axe in the
next Iiik Came. If we win the bear,
we'll paint it red. If they win the
axe, they can paint it tiny color
they darned please. Then in suc
ceeding games let both bear and
axe. he put up :is trophies and the
winners take both. We have just
as much right to their hear as they
have to our axe even though they
did have unlawful possession of it
for thirty-one years.
It should he further agreed that
the losers must escort the trophies
across the field and deliver them
to the victors.
Yours for belter sportsmanship,
An Oidtimer.
The Kdil.or, Sir:
The men who captured the Stan
ford Axe certainly should be re
warded. Any reward that we might
offer would not he great enough,
but the alumni, students, and Board
of Athletic Control might show
their appreciation in a small way
by arranging to give all the fellows
who actually took part in captur
ing the axe, a life membership in
the Alumni Association and a gen
erous number of complimentary
]>ig Game tickets for life. (In fact,
they deserve the whole stadium.)
Yours until Cal gets the Axe
hack. â€”F. L. Johnson.
