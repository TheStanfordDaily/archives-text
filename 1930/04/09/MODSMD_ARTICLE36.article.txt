They're off!
The annual Greens Picking Sea
! son hits started.
Cellars are being fixed with ac
commodations for certain of the
brothers.
Ami for other purposes.
The B tas are understood to have
put in a new Yale lock.
But they'll have lo pel along
I without ihe Interfralernity Conn
nil I his year.
That sterling hody is out to stop
this doggone illegal rushing. Y( js
sir.
What a misfortune it is that the
bright California sun makes dark
glasses necessary!
Signs of Spring:
The Dekes speaking to pritty
j near everybody.
And the big athletes yetting out
tiieir circle letters and the ping
! pony racquets.
And we can just see Ihe
scene in Any Tong this week:
"Yon see thai modes! big fella
over in the corner?" Brother
Twerp will say to a wide-eyed

I freshman, "Well, he didn't ex
actly get Hie axe, but he was
the first man to shake the
hands of the guys who did!"
That'll mean another pledge for
the house.
Notice
I'hi flamma Delta announces the
re pledging of (Jorge Hoodie, '30.
, And all Toyon Hall is broken
hearted.
And lonely.
Let's see—isn't there some sort
;of an election coming up this
j spring ?
We have SUCH an unreliable
memory!
Lest the Row be unduly disturbed,
this department will NOT conduct
' its Fraternity verses litis year—the
| "Variations on Favorite Themes."
After all, who cares about the
whole business?
Of course the folks hack in
Cobb's Corner expect you to do the
, right thing, you Men of !
Don't under any circumstances,
make up your own mind.

Mother knows best.

| We hate them.
We hate them and their red tile
roofs;
We hate the dirty grey of their
stone slabs;
We hate their silly smirking
smiles
And their raucous, triumphant.
shouting;
Oh, God,
We hate them!
We hale them!!
WE HATE THEM!!!
Hut let them snicker;
Let them gloat, ah, yes, indeed;
Hut yield we not to base and
I utile weeping,
And- moaning;
Let us be proild.
Let us be haughty and disdainful,
Disgustedly tolerant of their
puny pride.
Today
They triumph.
It may be one, it may be a hun
dred,
II may be a thousand years . . . .
And then .... and then ....
Hut let us be proud;
It was nothing but an axe.
We were tired of the damn thing
anyway.
We didn't want their silly trophy.
Nevertheless,
Hate Stanford!
j Hate! Hate!
HATE!
