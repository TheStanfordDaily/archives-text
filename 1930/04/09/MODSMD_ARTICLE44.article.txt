## 
### 
Football und track evidently do
not furnish enough thrills for Hay
Dawson, letterman on this year's
varsity foul ball team and member
of the i rack squad. Ray is now
sporting crutches around the Quad
as ii result of a basketball game
played with a fcolf ball the other
day. Reaching for a golf bull from
the railing of the Sigma Nu porch,
Dawson turned his foot back, se
verely spraining his ankle.
