# Cards Doped To Win U.S.C. Meet By One Point
## VICTORY SATURDAY HANGS ON SECOND AND THIRD PLACES Sprints and Hurdles Will Be Close; Relay May Decide Contest 
### Robert Van Etten 
Thirty-two varsity track men
were named by Coach "Dink" Tern
pleton last night to oppose U.S.C.
at Occidental Saturday afternoon.
Those making the trip will be:
Allen, Atkinson, Berry, Brown,
Brugman, Butler, Cooper, DeGroot,
Dowell, Dyer, Fleishhacker, French,
Giberson, Goldsmith, Grey, Hables.
Howell, Johns, Krenz, McDermott,
Madison, Morrison, Nash, Nelson,
Nisbet, Nunes, Parker, Rothert,
Shove, Smith, West, and Zuger.

the short dash, hut Dyer, always

the 220. In the battle for third
place Giberson will have his hands

.Morrison must give their best, ef

Give C.S.C. 5, Stanford 4 in the
100, and reverse that for the 220.
The 440, long Stanford's strong
event, will find Morrison, Shove,
and McDermott opposing a strong
trio in Williams, Woessner, and
Pearson of the Trojans. Morrison
is favored to gain revenge for his
defeat by Williams in last year's
meet, while Shove is a likely man
to collect third place. Call it Stan
ford 6, U.S.C. 3.
Cards Poor in 880
Atkinson, Templeton's lone hope
in the 880-yard event, will have to
pull a movie stunt to beat out Mc- i
Geagh and Burke, both consistent
at under two minutes. Atkinson, a
fighter with a world of intestinal
fortitude, has been troubled with
a bad leg. but if he can avoid tying

Cards Poor in 880
Atkinson, Templeton's lone hope
in the 880-yard event, will have to
pull a movie stunt to beat out Mc- i
Geagh and Burke, both consistent
at under two minutes. Atkinson, a
fighter with a world of intestinal
fortitude, has been troubled with
a bad leg. but if he can avoid tying
up lie might turn out to be the
fair-haired lad of "Dink's" squad.

U.S.C. S, Stanford 1.
Hurdles to Smith
Contrary to violent protestation
from the sunny Southland, Podge .
Smith is favored to beat out Welch

the low sticks. Nisbet, a fast j
sprinter, lias greatly improved his I
hurdling form and should be good j
for third in each race. Stanford 6,
U.S.C. 15 in both cases.
