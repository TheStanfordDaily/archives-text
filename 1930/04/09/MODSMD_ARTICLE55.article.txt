# STANFORD YEARLING TRACKSTERS DOPED TO DEFEAT CALIFORNIA CUBS FRIDAY
## 
### BY WILLIAM- FRENCH 
Stanford's lons siring of fresh
, man truck victories in the annual
: "Litl le-Big Meet" appears destined
i to be increased by one when the
| California Cubs and the Cardinal
| yearlings meet Friday afternoon
on the oval at Berkeley.
I Either Harry Bell or Merv Hobos
i son of California should take the
hundred. Only inches have sepa
rated them in their races this year
i and they have been travelling the
; distance in about 10.1. Denny Ward
] and Jack Twelvetrees have been
beaten regularly in much slower
J time than that.
In the 22n the Stanford babes
likewise seem due to lose eifcht
1 points to Bell and Robosson, both
| of whom have stepped the furlong
; in 22.K seconds, unless Ellington
j chooses to run Ben Eastman in
I this race. None of tin* other Stan
-1 ford runners have gotten under 2:!
1 seconds.
The quarter-mile should lie one
I of Kastman's usual walk aways.
| The best Berkeley freshman, Her
' man Albers, has run the distance
: in 51 1-5, which is a full three sec
i onds slower than Ben's best time.
In t lie 880 Frank Eullenwider
j and George Naylon should grab
j first and second place with very
j little trouble. They have been ruu
; ning in better than 2:02 and stand

i tin excellent chance of cracking two
flat Friday. The veal race will he j
tor third place between West and '
Smith of the Cal t'rosh and Mires
of Stanford, who have been run
ning the 880 in around 2:00.
The California Cubs lKive a line
miler in Frank Lucas who has a
record of 4:3:5 4-5. Hob Hunter ran
lie four laps in 4:30 before he was
taken sick, but he can hardly be
expected to get better than a sec
ond now, with Sindell of California
probably grabbing off the third.
The high hurdles should go to
Alden Herbert of Stanford, who
tops the high barriers in around
1,0.5. Folda of Stanford has an ex
cellent chance of taking second as
the leading California freshman, 1
Anderson, lias a record of but 17 1-5
seconds. The low hurdles should
develop into a great race between
Jim Brophy of California and Her
bert, as both are capable of 25
seconds in the lows and have been
constent at around that time. Folda
should take third place.
The two-mile is a toss-up, since
neither team has had any competi
itiou in this event. The Stanford
J freshman relay team should take
J the mile baton-passing race as the
! Bears lack good quartermilers.
