# GOLF MEN WANTED FOR CLASS TOURNEY
## 
### 
Still more men are needed to
compete in the interclass golf
tournament, according to Manager
Max Winter. Although entries in
the open individual tourney are
coming in, several classes lack the
necessary ten men before a class
can be a place-winner.
Men are urged to turn in their
scores for thirty-six holes if only
for the benefit of the class. Medi
ocre players should not hesitate to
play, says Winter, for each class
must have ten men regardless of
how good or bad the players are.
