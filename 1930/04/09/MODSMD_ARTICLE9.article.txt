# LANDING SPEED OF AIRPLANES WILL BE ASCERTAINED HERE
## 
### 
Experiments to determine the
j exact landing speed of airplanes
] will be conducted sometime within
1 the next few days by Professor
Elliot G. Reid, of the aeronautics
j department, aided by Captain John
IA. Mcßeady, of transcontinental
flight fame, according to an an
! nouncement made by Reid yester
i day.
j Mcßeady, who graduated from
! Stanford in 1012, was at the Palo
1 Alto School of Aviation flying field
j early yesterday afternoon to make
arrangements tor the experiments.
: He flies a Lockheed "Sirius," pow-
I ered with a 452 horsepower "Wasp"
j engine, which plane, Reid said yes
! terday, is almost an exact replica
lot' the one flown by Lindbergh.
Reid plans to paint a portion of
I the landing wheels white and to
j take high-speed motion pictures of
the plane as it lands. With the
speed of the exposures known, the
definite landing speed of the plane
I can be computed to an exact, de
j gree, according to Reid.
