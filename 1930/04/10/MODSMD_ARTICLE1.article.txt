# U.C. DOES NOT FAVOR IDEA OF AXE AS TROPHY
## John Reynolds, President Of A.S.U.C., Announces Stand of California Trophies Are Returned To B.A.C. Building; To Be Examined Today 
### 
California will not favor making
thu axe a Big Game trophy, even
it' Stanford should decide to make
it one, according to a telegram
from John A. Reynolds, president
of the California student body, re
ceived by Stanford Steinbeck,
A.S.S.I', president, yesterday after
noon.
Following is the telegram:
Contrary to the sentiment i
expressed in the Stanford Daily
and elsewhere, the students of
the University of California do
not now and never will favor
making the axe a Big Game
trophy. If Stanford does not
dare to display the axe at a
rally as we have, we feel sure
that there will be left enough
men at California to go and
get it.
John A. Reynolds
President A.S.U.C.
In reply to Reynolds' message,
Steinbeck wired yesterday:"The
Stanford student body has not yet
decided what it will do with its
recently recovered stolen property."
"In view of the outcome fo recent
Big Games," stated Steinbeck in
reference to the remarks of the
California president, "we are not
surprised that. U.C. and Mr. Rey
nolds do not favor making the axe
a Big Game trophy. Further we
would like to know if lie is expect
ing an increased enrollment, as he
did not have enough men to keep
the axe."
The trophies taken by Berkeley
invaders from the Stanford B.A.C.
building the night of the axe theft
were returned by mail yesterday,
according to Don Liebendorfer,
publicity director. The package
containing the trophies was not
thoroughly examined yesterday af
ternoon, but apparently the trophies
were all enclosed and in good con
dition. They will be examined by
B.A.C. officials this morning.
The following letter was re
ceived yesterday:
Dear President Steinbeck:
Thank you for taking the trouble
to send me such interesting tele
gram. 1 am glad that you were able
to recover the axe in a fair and
sportsmanlike manner without dis
turbing the relationship between
the two universities.
With all good wishes, very sin
cerely yours, Ray Lyman Wilbur.
