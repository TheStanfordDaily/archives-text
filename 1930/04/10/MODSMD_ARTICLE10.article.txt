Hackctt was asked his opinion of
the present-day conditions in the thea
tre. His reply, in part, was "The spo
ken drama is by no means dead! And
never will be! Of course, it is true
at the present time that it is tcmpo
rarily sidetracked, due to the novelty
and popularity of the talking pictures
and other conditions brought on by
unions and lack of good plays.
"Drama as an institution is too
tirnily fixed in the hearts of the pub

lic to ever allow it. to pass out of
{ existence," he went on. "No matter
how much the talking pictures are
[ perfected, they will always be mcchan
| ical and unreal, and can never rcpro-
I ducc stage action and speech with the
j freedom of the actor in person."
in discussing dramatics at Stanford,
) lie continued, "I think Stanford i>
I particularly to be commended for the
I way it has recognized the importance
i of the drama as an educational and
I moral factor. Interest in collcgc dra
matics here is splendid; the high class
: type of plays that arc being produced
and the excellence of ihe productions
have made Stanford dramatics famous
throughout the country."
While in college at the University
i of Michigan, Hackctt. member of the
class of '98, organized and became the
| first leading man of the famous Michi
gan Cutncdx Club.
