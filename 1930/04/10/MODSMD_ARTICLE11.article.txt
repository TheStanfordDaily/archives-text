# CULTURE IS HIT IN CARD, D.U. DEBATE
## Denver Speaker Contends European Criticism Is Justified 
### 
"European criticism of American
culture is based upon their own as a
standard, and is therefore unjustified,"
stated J. W. Botasof of Stanford in
last night's split-team debate with the
University of Denver. With Edwin
Lawrence Gcrhardt of Stanford and
Dan Williams of Denver, Botasof
defended American culture on the neg
ative side of the question, "Resolved,
That the foreign criticism of Ameri
can culture is justified."
James E. liednar of Stanford, joe
Lohman, aud Charles McLaughlan of
Denver presented the affirmative argu
ments. Lohman, first speaker, pointed
out that Americans exclude from their
materialistic civilization other neces
sary features which must be mingled
with materialism in order to maintain
intellectual culture in religion, science,
and aesthetics.
"The primary aim of America is to
get rich," charged Bcdnar in the af
firmative attack. "The American never
forgets his money-making, even in his
recreation." McLaughlan based his ar
guments on the fact that the nation is
unbalanced in its culture, and has
retrograded from its former ideals
of democracy and equality.
"George Bernard Shaw, one of the
outstanding European critics of Amer
ica, admits in the first sentence of his
criticism that he has never been to
America," said Williams. Gcrhardt
supported American culture on the
grounds that it is best adapted to the
realization of American ideals.
