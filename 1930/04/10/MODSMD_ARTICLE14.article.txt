# WENIG SELECTS COMMITTEE ON SENIOR FINANCE
## Bartlett, Treasurer of '30, Is Named Chairman Of Group Location of Graduation May Be Changed 
### 
Herb Wenig, president of the
Senior Class, has announced the
appointments to the Senior Finance
Committee of which Leonard Bart
lett, class treasurer, is chairman.
The following will serve on the
committee: Lucy Hitter, Alexander
Morris, Marianna Evans, Warren
Wilson, Carl Conradi, Robert Haw
ley, Donald Youngreen, Stephen
Clark, Ansel Williams, Anthony
Mulvey, Edward Field, and Wil
liam Simon.
This committee will collect class
dues, the exact amount of which
is still undecided since the location
of the commencement exercises
will determine the expense. It is
feared that the Chapel which has
heretofore been used will be too
small to house the friends and re
lations of such an unusually large
class and the Pavilion, Stadium,
and Memorial Court have been sug
gested as substitutes.
