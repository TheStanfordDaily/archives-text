## 
### 
SPOKANK,-Wash., April 91 (/P).—
The census was taken today in the
"jungle" down by the railroad tracks—
the more or less temporary abode of
those itinerants who travel trains
without tickets.
The job was done with the aid of
the leader of the "jnuglc" inhabitants,
who stopped a light, made the 15
others line up. and insisted upon polite
answers to questions by special cen
sus deputy ( harlcs Louckes.
Louckes, vouching for the story,
s;iifl the leader had had a tine record
in the army. Census rules forbade an
nouncement of his name.
