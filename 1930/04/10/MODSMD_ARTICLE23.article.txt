## 
### BY HOWARD MOORE 
Nine newcomers to the Stanford
'stage will be presented to the cam
pus when Noel Coward's sophisti
cated comedy of modern English
life is given on April 1!» under the
| direction of Harold Helvenston.

Idea."
The action centers about the two
j youngest peoplo in the piny, the
i brother and sister, whose conti
nental training forms a sharp eon
l trust, to the conventional society
I life of the English estate. Ruhland
! Isaly, appearing for the first, time
i in campus theatricals, plays the
j part of the brother, and Catherine
I Crary, who was seen in the 1!)2!)
Gaieties, portrays the sister. Moth
j roles call for a spontaneity of re
partee and action, and a quick
wittedness that distinguishes these
roles in modern comedies. Ingeni
ous schemes and clever carrying
out of young ideas of alleged un-

I sophisticated children form the
main outlines of the play;
Douglas Gregg will take the part
of the husband around whom the
i web of young ideas is placed. As
George Brent, father of Gerda and
Sholto, he is continually torn be
tween the memories of the charm

mother, and his second wife, Cicely.
Dorothy Tully in tho role of
Cicely will make her second ap
pearance on the Stanford stage,
having previously played in "The
Adding Machine," presented last
i summer quarter. She portrays an
I adventurous, attractive woman,
half-frightened and half-delighted
at her own indiscretions, while her
husband worries for fear they will
involve her in a scandal and reflect
;upon him.
The other lead. Brent's first wife,
will be filled by Marjorie Robinson,
i another new player. Her part is
tiiat of a novelist in Italy who lives
a rather unconventional continental
