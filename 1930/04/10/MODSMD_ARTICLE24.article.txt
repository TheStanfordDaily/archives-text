### Bob Van Etten 
Cardinal rooters will gather
at 6:45 o'clock tonight at the
Palo Alto depot for an all-Uni
versity rally as the track team
entrains to meet Southern
California.

j Carrying with them the best,
wishes and fondest hopes of the
entire student body, U2 members
; of the IJKSO track and field varsity
I will climb aboard a special section
jof the Sunset Limited at seven
j o'clock tonight to invade the cita-
J del of Troy. Accompanying the
; team will be Coach "Dink" Temple
i ton, Trainer Harry Maloney, Sen
ior Manager Robert Hell, and Jun
ior Manager Tom Melgaard.
Alter being installed at the Hunt
! ington Hotel Friday morning, the
Cardinal squad will drive to Eagle
Rock and hold a light workout on
the Occidental oval to acquaint,
themselves with any unusual lea
tures of this track.
At U:3O Saturday afternoon (lie
starter's gun sending the mile run
ners from their marks will open
tiie curtain on what promises to
be the greatest dual meet in Pacific
Coast Conference history.
Cards Have Chance
Despite the pessimistic outlook
generally held for chances of a
| Stanford win, "Dink" Templeton,
master strategist of track and lield,
jwill leave absolutely no stone un
turned in his efforts to squeeze out
I victory. And it is 011 "Dink's" al
most miraculous ability to produce
unsuspected talent plus the deter
mination and competitive spirit of
the Redshirt squad that the Car
dinal supporters are basing their
hopes.
Despite the possibility that tin-
Occidental track may be slow, it is
certain that records made Saturday
afternoon should more than favor
ably compare with the results of
1 any dual track encounter of this
I year. In nearly every event men of
[exceptional ability will be forced
j to do their utmost to nose out their
j strongest competitors.
In the two sprint battles between
j W.vkoff and Dyer—alone wort h the.
j price of admission —even time is
J certain to be badly battered. Given
j good weather and track conditions
j world marks may be equalled or
'bettered by either of these men.
Morrison Favored
Running against a fast field Mot
I rison will have to cut. 4!) seconds,
j fair time in any company, to cap
-1 turo his expected win. While world
records are in 110 danger in tin
longer distances, probable times of
better than 1:58, 4:2."), and 9:66 in
the 880. mile, and two-mile event. ,
respectively, maintain the excep
tional note of the Cardinal Trojan
lilt.
Superior times are again almost,
certain in both hurdle races. Smith
and Welch in the high sticks, and
Smith, Carls, and Payne in the
lows have frequently run 15 flat, and
little more than 24 flat, in the re
j spective distances. The winner of
each of these events should break
the tape well under these times.
Competing against Herman Brix,
who will make exhibition tosses,
Rot hen or Krenz may get the shot
out far enough to add a world rec
ord to the afternoon's festivities.
In the discus, with the threat of
Boh Hall's 148-foot record, Krenz
may throw his pet weapon out of
the lot to accomplish his ardent in
tention of bettering his own world
mark. •
Trojan Hurlers Strong
Three javelin men capable of
hurling the spear beyond the 19fl
mark, a high-jumper credited with
having cleared (! feet 7 inches, five
men capable of better than 2?> feet
(i inches in the broad jump, and a
10-foot-6-inch pole-vaulter complete
the list of stellar performers.
And then the relay. Templeton
has set his heart on winning this
event. Should the meet, hinge on
the baton-passing quartets, count
on the winner crossing the line
under 3:17.
