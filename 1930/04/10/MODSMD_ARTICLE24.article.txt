at 6:45 o'clock tonight at the
Palo Alto depot for an all-Uni

entrains to meet Southern
California.

wishes and fondest hopes of the
entire student body, U2 members

be the greatest dual meet in Pacific
Coast Conference history.
Cards Have Chance
Despite the pessimistic outlook
generally held for chances of a
| Stanford win, "Dink" Templeton,
master strategist of track and lield,
jwill leave absolutely no stone un
turned in his efforts to squeeze out
I victory. And it is 011 "Dink's" al
most miraculous ability to produce
unsuspected talent plus the deter

the Redshirt squad that the Car
dinal supporters are basing their
hopes.
Despite the possibility that tin-
Occidental track may be slow, it is
certain that records made Saturday
afternoon should more than favor
ably compare with the results of

I year. In nearly every event men of
[exceptional ability will be forced
j to do their utmost to nose out their
j strongest competitors.
In the two sprint battles between
j W.vkoff and Dyer—alone wort h the.

J certain to be badly battered. Given
j good weather and track conditions

'bettered by either of these men.

Superior times are again almost,

Smith, Carls, and Payne in the
lows have frequently run 15 flat, and
little more than 24 flat, in the re
