11 is not often (h'tl a newspaper is pleased to correct an error;
but in tliis case the Daily is not embarrassed. It is pleased, even
happy, l<» broadcast the following message sent yesterday by John
\. Reynolds, president of the Associated Students of the I niver
silv of California, to Stanford Steinbeck, local student executive:
"( outran - to the sentiment expressed in the Stanford
Dailv and elsewhere, I want to tell you that the students of
the I Diversity of California do not now and never will favor
making the axe a I'ig flame trophy, 1 112 Stanford does dare to
displav the axe at a rally as we have, we feel sure that there
will be left enough men at California to go and get it."
John A. Reynolds,
President A.S.I\C.
One is inclined to believe thai that is pretty emphatically that.
Stanford Steinbeck replied in this vein:
"Stanford student body has not yet decided what it will
do with its recently recovered stolen property."
Steinbeck is right. Cardinal students have not decided as to
just what course shall be taken in the final disposal of the historic
weapon.
I'ut Cardinal students iviil decide—and soon. Their decision
will be that the Axe shall remain where it belongs—on the Stanford
campus. Such a statement is more than a mere prophecy. It is
almost a certainty.
Ii is even more of a certainty now that Mr. Reynolds has given
vent to his suppressed emotions.
Stanford student sentiment has aligned itself with the proposi
tion of keeping the \xe : alumni support has apparently been thrown
the same way; now even California has expressed itsell emphatic
ally as disfavoring the trophy idea.
Is there any other course open?
