# GANDHI TWISTS THE LION'S TAIL
## 
### 
Mahatma (iandhi, that wizened little leader of Indian masses,
continues to plague the llritish lion with insistent campaigns for
independence.
(iandhi apparently learned a lesson of non-violence from the
Indian Mutiny of 1857. Results of that disastrous internal dis
turbance, though far-reaching in effect, failed to shake the dee])
English foothold in that ancient country.
Civil disobedience, not rebellion, is < iandhi's recourse, lint care
ful as he is to suppress his hosts of followers, at times he finds his
cohorts unruly, unmanageable. And in such a state of restlessness
the Indian hordes find themselves this week. To afford ample pro

arms into India.
Native Indians view with bitter nationalistic distaste the deep
entrenchment of (ireat I Britain in land snatched by John Hull from
contemporary European competitors in the race for colonial posses
sions.
Disinterested observers cannot fail to note that India has mate
rially profited under English rule. A country, once dominated by
autocratic,warring rajahs, has been welded into a compact admin
istrative unit. Creat public improvements have been instituted.
Education, always a dangerous weapon to place at the disposal of
a freedom-clamoring people, is being offered inereasedly to more
and more of the countless illiterates. I'ritain appears truly bene
ficent in her stand.
All of which means little to (iandtfi and his colleagues. Most
nationals tend to scorn the best alien government in the world to be
ruled bv the worst of home administrators. Nationalism is a
deeply-ingrained human attribute.
Hut (iandhi and his mobs are weak against the might and
resources of a great world power. India's hope for independence in
the dim, distant future lies solely in her ability to produce Indian
leaders capable of competing on a par with her present J'.uropcan
