A HISTORY OF THE JEWS—By
Paul Goodman. New York: E.
P. Dutton & Co., Inc. $1.50.
Tin- history of ;i race which,
though il lias been despised for
many centuries, has never failed to
provide tlie world with influential
i leaders and which has, without
i doubt, played an interesting part
iin the development of our civiliza
tion.is a subject, which arouses the
'curiosity of the reader,
j Dr. Goodman has, however, given
| barely more than an outline of
j facts and, though the work may
well be of value to students of the
subject, if is low in literary value.
In the preface he states: "The
Jews are one of the very rare races
with a definite mission in the de
velopment of mankind a mission
uf which the actors are conscious,
if, at times, unwilling agents, des
j tilled to play the part of historic
| advocates for the freedom of the
human conscience, in contravention
of their own jeafous and uncom
promising adherence to ethical
Montlieism and to the moral pur
pose of human life the imperish
able Jewish contributions to the
foundations of civilization."
This sentence is one of the few
definite statements of his own
opinions which the author makes
in the book. It shows rather well
with the not uncommon paradox
of a group which is forced by cir
cumstances into comparative liber
alism.
Also paradoxical is the way in
which, like the early Christians,
the Jews remained united and
throve under persecution—a perse
cution directed upon them by a re
jligion which had for its god a Jew.
l)r. Goodman has held to his ideal
of impartiality in many respects,
lit is, perhaps, because of this ideal
that he has presented little but
bare facts.
At one point, however, he calmly
j slates as fact the statement, that
Judaism was "a religion which, in-
I conte.st.ably the purest: and highest
jof antiquity, embraced within its
range the whole of mankind."
As regards the "moral purpose
of human life" mentioned in the
preface, the Jewish religion was
more pure than that of the Greeks,
and more unified. But "highest,"

I especially in an artistic view, is a
very doubtful superlatives and is
out of place in a history.
In general, however, the hook
may he said to be an excellent out
line of .Jewish history which leaves
iL the reader to make his esti
mate of the importance and value
of the race which passed on to
Christianity the depressing funda
mental of Occidental sects, "moral
! purpose of human life." TO. W.
1 HIGH SOCIETY BLUES—At the
New Stanford Theatre
For once, Janet Gaynor is not
j the pleasing little wench who is
hoisted from rags to riches; con
sequently, Charles Farrell cannot
help her. Aside from these start
ling innovations, the story of "High
I Society Blues" follows well-trodden
paths. In fact, every now and then,
someone says it is "just like a
storybook" and there is a whole
I song to I hat effect.
Charlie and his family are just
home folks from Fremont, newly
! rich, trying to get sociable with
! Janet and her family, the snobs
who own the estate across the
| road. That is, all but Janet. She
isn't a snob. She and Charlie get
along quite well, even though Janet
is engaged to a count. It fakes a
lot of ukelele playing, singing, and
liquor judiciously introduced to
the count's insides to persuade
Janet that she should elope with
Charlie on the night that her en
gagement, to the count is to be
announced. However, Charlie's sis
ter falls for the count, who is
rather a nice fellow anyway, and
Charlie and Janet make their re
spective fathers and mothers for
get the business and social quar
rels and everybody is happy.
There are a few good song num
bers, notably "High Society Blues"
and "I'm On The Market For You,"
which have a certain something in
the melody, as well as clever words.
Janet and Charlie are their usual
charming selves. That rare trouper,
Louise Fazonda, does a memorable
hit as the old-fashioned mother who
just doesn't know bow to dress, or
be anything but herself. Joyce
Compton, a newcomer, to the re
viewer at least, is both decorative
and intelligent in her role,
