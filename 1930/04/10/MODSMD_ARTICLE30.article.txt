j I lie Editor, Sir: j
It tins been suggested that Slan-'
, ford's Axe be put up as a trophy!
for future Big Games. The sugges-j
lion, we understand, enmes from I
our friends in Berkeley (of course), j
who ought to have thought of lliat i
j.'ll years ago. But it reaches our I
ears thai certain Stanford men
have actually seriously entertained j
I the proposal. While we do not wish j
to he tagged with high-schoolish i
spirit or over-venomousness toward >
California, we helieve thai Ihe sug-j
j gestion is entirely opposed to lliej
wish of the majority of the Stan-,
ford student body.
It is unnecessary to dwell long J
ion the fact that the Axe is a St.au
j ford symbol, and always has been,
since the inception of the idea. To
directly change ils significance in
I such it way would be a violation
not only of good taste (in Stanford
j mouths at least.) but also of the
j hopes and aspirations of those who !
in these :il years have plotted the
I return of tin; Axe. No ('aiifornian
| (seftsti stricto) would think of plac
ing Ihe Golden Bear up as a trophy
to be lost hy someone running to
ward the wrong goal. It is a mons
| Irons thought to the Berkeleyite, j
1 and well it should be.

| There is (he commendable argu
j ment that making of it a trophy
i will prevent future bloodshed!?)
[over the Axe. This scarcely holds
water. We do not believe thai Blue
• Boys of Berkeley will resort, to
| machine guns and dynamite, de
j spile their hymn of hate. (Univer
sity students are occasionally cred
•; ited with a little sense.) And we
jalso doubt that new guardians of
■the Axe being themselves so well
j versed in the arts of friendly de

I chance at the Axe in the future.

:It has been the heart of Stanford's

Axe. Yet with the Axe itself up
as a trophy, we DARE any son of
the Cardinal to yell at the Stanford
varsity, "Give 'em the Axe!"
So let ns hark to those who for
years have sallied forth (o
Berkeley in attempts to bring home
, the Axe. Do they say, "Give 'em
the Axe"? Yes, but in another way!
Let Berkeley put up the Golden
Bear as a trophy for the Big Game,
let's buy us a thousand-dollar lov
