And so, with a tear in our
voice, we recite, gently but
firmly—
ONCE in a GARDEN
B. H. N. Rwanson
(From College Humor)
T II E It 10 was shadow-talk
anions (lie flowers; the night
breeze came up the gravel path
and moved among them. Little
jets of perfume rose and fi>ll
l'rom the jasmine as silently as
did I lie silver thread of water
in the fountain. The grass was
marbled with colored ligliis
j l'rom the dance. (Jay voices
fluttered out like moths to the
darkest corners of the garden.
There was a very discreet
moon. Somewhere, not so far
away, trees stirred in each
other's arms wilh little drowsy
murmurs.
What was her face like? It
was, 1 am certain, the sum of
every delight -even though the
eyes, the hair, the mouth, all
elude me. Bui do the features
of first loves ever come clear?
I am nol ail old man. hill I

have said goodby In enough of
young happiness to he jealous
of what remains. You say I am
sentimental. You are too, if you
an> honest with yourself.
No deep satisfaction can last.
The impermanence of love, I lie
sadness of it, is its charm. The
emotion you now experience
is (lie sweetest —it will never
come again. There are all kinds
of love, but this same love
never will greet you twice.
Happiness is a, cup diluted
for the old, full and strong for
the young. You cannot ask the
moon to stand still. Keep close
to you what you have known.
Put in your heart what you live
in your garden tonight—you
are going to need it.
Tomorrow 1 may be in love
again ... I may think noth
ing like it could ever have hap
pened before. But the thoughts
of another garden will sting
my eyes. It will be sweet tin 11
to know there is real warmth
in dreams.

That cert'nly brings the ol'
lump to the throat.
