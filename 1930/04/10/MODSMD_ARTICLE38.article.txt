Trekking northward to (he Berke
ley campus, Coach Bill Ellington's
red-shirted freshman track aspir
ants will devote tomorrow after
noon to their annual task of sub
jugating the Golden Bear Cults.
Not since 192H have the Cardinal
yearlings failed to take l the measure
«.f their California rivals, although
last year only the sensational ef
forts of "Ike" llaldes in the, relay
enabled the Stanford first-year men
to pull out of the fire a (ifi-Ofi vic
tory.
Tomorrow another Cardinal
triumph is expected, for it is
doubtful that At Ragan's hope
fuls have been sufficiently
steeped in California atmos
phere to "Hate Stanford" with
the fervor necessary if they are
to wrest unexpected points
from Ellington's promising ath
letes.
The curious parallel existing be
tween freshman and varsity suc
cesses in dual track competition
with California is most illuminat
ing. Beginning in 1 i>24 each squad
lias since achieved an unbroken
string of conquests of their ancient
rivals.
Tomorrow's varsity is no
stronger than today's freshmen.
Thus it, is that the efforts of
Messrs. Eastman, Laßorde, Cray,
Naylon, and Fullenwider to men
tion only a few -in tomorrow's
meet will be watched with an eye
to their future possibilities.
Continuing the long line of
great Cardinal quarter-milers
Captain Ben Eastman looms as
perhaps the greatest of them
all. Eastman's 48 1-5 mark
made last Saturday in the 440
is the fastest time recorded in
American intercollegiate com
petition this year. Under the
tutelage of "Dink" Templeton,
this youthful runner should
some day shatter the long im
pregnable world mark in his
event.
Picked as successors to the
mighty Krenz and Rothert, Laßorde
and Gray will have their hands
full if they are to equal or surpass
the careers of hteir predecessors.
And yet it will not come as
any particular surprise if these
two tomorrow wipe from the
books Krenz's records, estab
lished four years ago, in the
shot and discus.
Particular interest will be at
tached to the half-mile, which Nay
lon and Fallen wider are expected
to run in close to two minutes.
Not since the days of Bill Richard
son has Stanford had an 880 man
callable of cutting 1:57. Properly
developed, these two freshmen
should add welcome strength to
Cardinal half-mile prospects.

Captain Ben Eastman looms as
