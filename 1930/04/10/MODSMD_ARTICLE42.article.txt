# THE 						TROJAN THUNDERBOLT...
## Borah, Paddock, Drew, and Parsons Have All Been U.S.C. Men; Now Comes Wykoff with Guyer, Maurer, Draper, All Good Runners 
### Feg Murray, '16 
It is taken for granted among the
colleges and universities that com
pete with the University of South
ern California in track and field
contests, that the Trojans will ill
ways have a good sprinter. And,
more often than not, they will have
a great sprinter, one who can con
sistently run 10(1 yards in 9 4-5 sec
onds or better. Kight now the fair
haired speed-body at U.S.C. is
Frank Wykoff, who lias run the
century in 9 3-5 seconds several
times, and who was the outstand
ing man in the final Olympic try
outs in 1928, winning three heats
and the finals of the hundred meter
run in the record-equaling time of
10 3-5 seconds.
Before Wykoff, who recently
transferred to U.S.C. from Glen
dale Junior College, Coach Dean
Cromwell had Charley Borah as
his sprinting Ace. Borah's perform
ances in the 1927 1.C.4-A. meet at
Philadelphia are still talked about
when track fans gather and discuss
great sprinters. Charley won the
100 in 9 8-10 that day, and the 220
in 20 9-10, to break Bernie Wefers'
long-standing record. Wefers him
self was kind enough to say that

Borah was the greatest sprinter;
his eyes had ever seen.
Before Borah, the Trojans' "Fast- i
est Human" was Charley Paddock, ;
whose name has been synonymous j
with sprinting records, rows with |
the A.A.and engagements to!
various beautiful ladies for ten j
years or more. Paddock, Borah, and j
Wykoff were all members of the |
U.S. Olympic team in 1928.
Back around 1912 came one of
the smoothest-running sprinters of
all time to U.S.C. His name was j
Howard Drew, a negro athlete who
was as white as they make 'em,
and his running was the personifi-'
cation of grace and rhythm. As a <
student at Springfield, Mass. High :
School lie had won the 1912 and
1913 National championship, and 1
have seen him coasting in the last ,
50 yards of a 21 1-5 220! What a ;
marvel he was!
Charley Parsons, National cham
pion in in 1905, was a great old war i
horse, a consistent 9 4-5 man and '
a splendid all-around athlete. The;
spectacular Waldo Throop was an- 1
other Trojan who could step some, ;
and now, besides Wykoff, they have
Guyer, Maurer, and Draper, all
first-class sprinters.
