# U.S.C. IS STIFFEST FOE OF STANFORD WATER POLO MEN
## Larry Harris, Ward Woods Will Fill Places of Driggs, Parker 
### Reid Briggs 
Although Coach Ernst Brandsten
feels certain of victory for the
Stanford swimming team in the
Minor Sports Carnival in Los An
geles Friday and Saturday, he be
lieves that the water polo contests
will be very close.
Stanford's most formidable op
ponent will be whose polo
ists are among the best on the
Pacific Coast. Ordinarily the Cards
would be expected to take the Tro
jan seven without much difficulty.
This quarter, however, two new
players will be in the Cardinal
line-up, Larry Harris and Ward
Woods. These guards will take the
places of Ogden Driggs and Tru
man Parker, both of whom were
graduated last quarter.
Harris and Woods were main
stays on last year's triumphant
freshman water polo team, and with
Whitey Burns will constitute a neat
brickfield. The regular forward
line-ui) will present Austin Clapp,
Frank Booth, and Reggy Harrison.
Nort Thronton will be on goal
guarding duty for the .Cardinals.
Strongest threats on the IT.S.C.
squad are Bela Kendall,'Jack Sault,
Carlos Schussler, and Oscar Sim
mons. The Card poioists are ex
pected to repeat their recent over
whelming win over California,
when they beat the Bears 11-1.
U.C.L.A.'s Bruins will probably
prove good game for the Bear-tam
ing Cards, also.
The swimming meet is scheduled
for 2 o'clock Friday, to be followed
by water polo elimination games
at 8 o'clock. The polo final game
will be played Saturday morning at
HI o'clock. All contests will be in
the Trojans' tank.
