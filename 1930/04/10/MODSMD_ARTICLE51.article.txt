## Mitchell Explains Grading System To Be Adopted Here Next Fall 
### 
Next year students will get more
made points with their grades, as
ilie result ol' faculty action just
completed, hut it won't make any
great difference except, possibly
with those students who get D's
Students will receive more gradt
points, hut it will take more to
graduate and in the end graduation
requirements will be the same a.s
now and the Bawl-out will look the
.same.
Uy the new system, which goes
into effect with next autumn quar
ter, the number of grade points foi
A, 13, (', and I) will be 4, 15, li. and
3 instead of J, 2, 1, and t), as they
are now. The chief effect of the
new method will he to mark a
difference in students' records be
tween I) iiiid failure or condition.
At present a I) ranks no higher
than a complete failure, both re
cording iij zero in grade points,
while under the new plan a D will
mean one grade point. The same
benefit will be gained in removing
a condition, which now rates noth
ing, but hereafter will add one
grade point for every unit of con
ditioned work made up.
"The new system of grade points
is not intended to make graduation
either harder or easier," says Regis
trar J. Pearce Mitchell. "So far as
we can determine by studying the
records of former students it will
have little effect in that respect.
"Under the system that, goes into
effect next year 180 units and DGO
grade points will be required for
graduation, 22 grade points a quar
ter will be required to keep a stu
dent off probation, and 15, after the
first two quarters, to avoid disquali
fication."
