### W.A. Roberts 
Thai no horse meat is dispensed
to the row and that "the meat sold
is 'AT steer beef of the highest
quality" was the statement made
yesterday by Jack Mustain, head
of the meat department of the Stu
dents' Co-operative Purchasing As
sociation.
Although Mustain deals with ;54
Row organizations and supplies
meat for 900 people, the quantity
consumed is quite astounding. Ac
cording to Mustain 15 beeves, 40
lambs, 15 calves, and 50 hogs meet
the frying pans and ovens of the
fraternities and sororities during
the course of a month. Besides
this, the Row consumes 15,000 hot
dogs and little pork sausages per
month, Mustain stated. And for
those that are statistically minded,
i f might be added that these hot
dogs if placed end to end would
stretch around a 440-yard track two
and one-half times.
Figures indicate that ham and
eggs and bacon and eggs must be
quite popular for there are 100
hams and 200 sides of bacon and
30 cases of eggs used monthly;
this means that. 10,800 eggs are
used every thirty days, in other
words the daily per capita con
sumption amounts to 12 per person.
Rushing brings sleepless nights
and plenty of overwork for Mus
tain. "And the worst of it is," lie
says, "is that they all insist on !
having the best."
