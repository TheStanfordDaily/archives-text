# CARD TOSSERS OUT TO UPSET HORNER'S HOODOO AS PITCHER
## 
### 
Fresh from the third straight
j victory over U.C.L.A., Stanford's
baseball varsity settled down yes
terday to serious practice for the
second Card-Bear diamond clash
slated for Saturday afternoon on
South Field in Berkeley. The Bears
I took the first encounter last week
! end by a spore of 7 to C, and the
| Cardinal nine is out to even the
j series.
Two California pitchers have
j long been a. hoodoo to Coach Wol
! ter's cohorts. (Jus Nemechek start
j ed a string of live victories way
! back in 11)27, winning two out of
| the three games. The Bear mentor
| slipped up and put in Jacobsen for
| the third tilt and the Cards man
â–  aged to bang out five runs in the
| sixteenth inning of that game to
hang up the last victory that Stan
ford baseball teams have been able
J to worm out of the Blue and Gold
| tossers.
Nemechek took three straight in
1928, and then graduated to have
Norm Horner pull the same stunt
in 1929. The ex-custodian of the
, axe has started out the same way
, this year and Coach Clint Evans
will probably give him a chance to
get his fifth consecutive win Satur
j day.
Perry Churchill showed up pret
! ty well at a new position at third
base in the Bruin clash Tuesday,
! and Wolter plans to convert the
j second sacker into chief guardian
1 of the hot corner against U.C. Cook,
who played first base last year,
| and has been out for practice since
; the start of this quarter, may start
in the field Saturday, and Kintala
I is back in the game again after
j nursing a sprained leg received in
I the last California tilt.
