# ROBLE SLEEPS OUTSIDE Five Frosh For Fresh Air OUT UNDER THE MOON
## 
### 
Hoble girls may not sleep undei
fhe stars!
That, at least, was the lessor
five freshmen learned this week. At
ten-thirty Monday night they tare
fully carried their mattresses and
blankets out onto the upper porch
in the hack of the Hall, sneaked
under the covers and fell asleep,
never dreaming anyone could find
fault with so harmless a scheme.
At one-thirty the ringleader of
the group was roughly shaken by
the shoulder. She awoke to find a
sophomore woman whose room
opens onto the porch hovering over
her, a picture of horror and dismay.
"What in the world are you all
doing?" the soph gasped.
"We WERE trying to sleep," the
freshman answered with a feeble
attempt at sarcasm.
"Oh, but don't you know it would
count as an overnight lockout
arid not a technical one either â€”to
lie found here. You must come in
at once before anyone sees you."
And so the disgruntled freshmen
smuggled the mattresses in a win
dow and down the silent corridors
to their rooms, bemoaning the se
verity of A.W.S. rules.
