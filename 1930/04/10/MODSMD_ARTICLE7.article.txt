# SEC'T WILBUR'S OIL POLICY HIT BY U.S. COURT
## Justice Bailey's Decision May Force Reopening Of Oil Lands Government May Carry Its Case To High Court 
### 
| WASHINGTON, April 9 (/Pi. â€”
| Secretary Wilbur's methods in carry
j iiiK out President Hoover's oil conscr
j vation policies were disapproved today
j by the District of Columbia Supreme
| Court.
Likelihood that government lands,
| closed to drilling for gas and oil by the
Secretary of tbe Interior, would again
j be open to prospectors resulted from
i Justice Jennings Bailey's order dircct
j ing Wilbur to reinstate two applica-
I tions to search for oil and gas.
Justice Bailey, in granting a man-
I damus against the Interior Secretary,
' held, in effect, that neither the Presi
j dent nor the cabinet officer had power
! to close entirely public lands to per
| mits to drill for oil and gas.
One case was brought by Richard
j D. Vedder, of California, and the
I other by Roy C. Barton, of New Mcx
(ico.
j The government noted an appeal of
| the orders and the Supreme Court may
pass upon the question before it is
i finally settled.
President Hoover's announcement
last March that immediate steps were
i to be taken to conserve oil and gas on
i public lands was followed by a ruling
by Secretary Wilbur, under which the
majority of about 20,000 pending pcr
! mits were revoked.
Since that time a virtual ban lias
been placed also on requests for the
issuance of new permits.
Justice Bailey held the granting of a
, permit request was discretionary with
the Secretary of the Interior but that
. the discretion was not absolute.
