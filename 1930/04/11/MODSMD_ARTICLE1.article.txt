# CALIFORNIAN IN PLEA TO LIMT FILIPINO INFLUX
## Welsh Believes California Unemployment Due to Migration From West Requests Same Restrictions For Filipinos, Chinese, Mexicans, And Japanese 
### 
WASH INC.TON, April 10 (/P).—
Relief from unemployment conditions
ereated in liis state through influx of
IMiilippiue laborers was asked today
by Representative Welch, Rcpuhlicati,
California, before the House Immigra
tion Committee at the opening of hear
ings mi his bill to restrict Philippine
immigration.
Asserting that there were in Cali
fornia 60,000 Filipinos, who, lie said,
had entered all kinds of labor and busi
ness at wages for which the white
workers could not compete, Welch
said a deplorable unemployment con
dition had arisen.
Me asserted California sought the
same relief from this third phase of the
Western immigration situation which
had been granted in the Chinese and
Japanese exclusion acts.
V. S. McClatchy, California news
paper man, representing the California
Joint Immigration Committee, reiter
ated this request that Filipinos be
placed under the same immigration re
strictions as apply to Japanese and
Chinese.
McClatchy quoted statements from
American and Philippine leaders to
support his view that exclusion of the
would be to the best inter
ests ni" both countries.
McClatchy told the committee it was
conceded that Philippine immigration
should be stopped, saying there were
two alternatives—independence or ex
clusion.
Welch said Californians favored re
striction of both Mexican and Philip
pine immigration. He said there was
no racial prejudice against the Fili
pinos, adding that in the facc of the
labor situation created by the presence
of Filipinos it was felt that Califor
nia, Oregon, and Washington had a
right to ask for government protec
tion against undesirable immigration
just as England grants her Pacific
colonies by excluding immigration
from India.
lie characterized Filipinos as an
"unassimiliablc race" that is driving
the people to desperate unemployment
ci mditions.
