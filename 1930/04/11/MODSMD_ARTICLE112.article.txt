# ENGINEERING SCHOOL INSTALLS MATERIAL TESTING APPARATUS
## 
### 
1 esting materials In compression,
i tension, and bending is the junction of
the new Universal Testing Machine
j recently installed in the laboratories
jof the School of Knginecriug. Accord-
I ing to Charles Moser, prolessor oi civil
j engineering, the apparatus will test up
jto 200,000 pounds. The machine will
j handle specimens of concrete, steel,
I and wood for compression and tension
| tests up to the length of 12 feet, and
j for bending it will handle specimens
j up to 16 feet in length.
Professor Moser stated that the ma- i
i chine is of the "three rotating screw
l type" having an autographic recorder
lof both loads and deformations. The
| instrument is auto-driven and possesses
i six speeds which range from eight
! inches per minute down to five hun
j dredths of an inch per minute,
j The first research work with, the i
I new machine will commence shortly. 1
Mr. Miller and Mr. Burke, under the
j supervision of Professor Moser, will
' test cables that have been discarded in
I the oil fields to determine their ntilitv.
