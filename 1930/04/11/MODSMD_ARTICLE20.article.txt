TEPIC, Mexico, April 10 (A*).â€”
An American air man, Lieut. H. YY.
Lucas of Los Angeles, narrowly
missed spying out tlie camp of the
kidnapers of J. E. Uristow, American
mining man, and indirectly aided in the
negotiations which finally resulted in
Bristow's release for 3,000 pesos.
The story of how Lieut. Lucas, a
former navy flier, narrowly missed
sighting the bandits in their hidden
volcanic lair with Bristow was re
vealed by piecing together the accounts
of Bristow and Lucas after the Amer
ican mining man had been released in
the town of Ahuacatlan.
Lucas, who pilots a passenger plane,
said that while flying between Tcpic
and Mexico C ity he decided to try to
locate the kidnapers. J1 e spent twenty
minutes circling over Ceboruco vol-'
cano but failed to locate it although
he learned later he had been close to it.
