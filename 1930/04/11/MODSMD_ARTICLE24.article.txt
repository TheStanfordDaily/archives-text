# '500' SHOWN TO BE LESS STUDIOUS THAN WOMEN IN EASTERN SCHOOLS
## 
### BY CATHERINE SPAULDING 
Tlu: l ive I lundt'ed arc not studiously |
inclined. At least the time survey i
wliieli is being conducted on llie cani-
Ihis shows that Stanford women, from
the group selected, '-pend some live
hours less per week than the coeds of j
the University of Chicago and the
students of Vassar and Alt. I lolyoke.
and at least nine hours less than
those of Bryn Mawr in academic work.
The average, taken from a representa
tive group, shows 14.9 hours spent in
classes per week, and IN.O hours on
study.
However. Stanford coeds manage to i
get some sleepâ€”the average being 6.?.5
hours per week or a little more than
nine hours a day. The time spent in J
outdoor exercise is very small, totaling
three and otic-half hours a week. Since |
the group included some Lower l)i
vision women who arc required to
spend four hours a week, very little
exercise is shown in the Upper J)i- I
vision.
Almost a movie apiece i- indicated
per week, and some 5..? hours are spent
in activities. Nine out of 25 went to
church oticc a week, hut here the fresh- j
men were greatly in the majority, hav
ing seven of the nine.
Comparisons between the charts

were made and ii was noticeable that
only 5 out of the 25 spent their time
in activities over the average. Activi
ties were counted as committee and
club work or meetings, play rehearsals,
and publications work. Those who
spent over the average in activities
showed less than average sleep, and
those who spent more time in study
ing show more than average in sleep.
The time study is being made lor
purposes of information and i-> to be
continued this quarter. U.S.C., U.C.,
and San Jose State are also conducting
a similar study, following the practice
carried on in the Kastcrn colleges a
few years ago. A .new group of charts
is to be given out within the next few
weeks, and. following the checking of
those, general questionnaires will be
formed.
Among the smaller items to be
checked will be the amount of time
spent in sleeping in the daytime, eating
outside of meals, card games, sun bath
ing. and reading for pleasure.
The study is being carried out by a
committee appointed by Hetty Aldcn,
composer! of: chairman. Catherine
Spauldiug, Mary Rochcfort, Jean
Marquis, and Carol Shriver. It is be
ing conducted under the auspices of
the Y.W.C.A.
