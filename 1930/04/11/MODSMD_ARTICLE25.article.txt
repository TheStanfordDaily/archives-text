# CARD TRACKMEN EN ROUTE TO SOUTH DETERMINED ON DESTROYING TROJAN HOPES
## Stanford Squad of Untried Talent Rated Underdogs Against Proven Ability of Greatest Team Ever to Wear the Colors of Troy 
### BOB VAN ETTEN 
Determined to aehievc the impossible, 32 men, the cream of Stanford's
1930 crop of track and field athletes, left Palo Alto last night set upon once
again destroying Trojan dreams of unchallenged track supremacy.
Under the careful direction of Coach "Dink" Templcton and Trainer
Harry Maloney the Cardinal varsity will commence its assault on the reputedly

Unbeatable Trojans at 2:30 tomorrow
afternoon at Patterson Field, the Occi
dental oval.
With a Southern California victory
already written "in the books" by the
majority of dopestcrs, Tcmplcton's
men will have t<> improve their great
est efforts if they are to wrest victory
from the Sons of Troy.
Arrayed against the Cardinals is one
of the greatest collections of track and
field stars that was ever gathered under
the banner of a single university.
Against this group of tried and,tested
men Stanford sends a squad composed
in part of equally experienced athletes,
but in the large of men potentially
great but having not yet proven them
selves against stiff competition.
Individual Stars
True strength of the Southern Cali
fornia squad lies not in their individual
stars, but in the wealth of supporting
talent amassed in each event. First
places should be almost evenly di
vided between the competing teams,
with Stanford a slight favorite to cop
the majority of individual wins. To
gain the extra points, however, nearly
every Cardinal entry must beat out
one or two Trojans of marked ability.
In the sprints, for example, Wykofi
is backed up by Maurer, Guycr, and
Draper, all consistent at 10 Hat and
22 flat in the century and furlong.
To break into the scoring column Gi
bcrson and Howell must do some tall
stretching.
So well provided with 440 men is
Cromwell, that the question of select
ing his three entries will be a delicate
one. Williams, Pearson, Wocssuer,
and McGeagh all run close to SO sec
onds or better, presenting somewhat
of a task for any of Stanford's quar
ter-milcrs except Morrison.
Trojan Milers Good
In the longer distances Halstead
and Hansen in the mile, and Fit/.-
mauricc, Patterson, and Daniels in
the eight-lap event have already proved
their class by nosing t>ut "Spud" Moss
man, California's highly touted miler,
and shutting out Henderson of U.C. in
the longer grind.
Welch, Carls, and Payne in the
hurdles present a formidable trio. A 1
though Podge Smith is favored to
capture one or both of the hurdle,
events, Nisbct, Nelson, and Hrugnian
must travel fast to step into the
money.
Inside the oval, only in the shot and
discus do the Trojan leaders fail to
be backed up by unusual talent. Hob
Hall looms as the sole U.S.I . hope in
the weight events, and even he ma>
be shut out by Flcishhacker in the.
shot and Grey and Rothert in the
discus.
Van Odsel, Cromwell's most incou
sistent high-jumper, is supported by
Stewart and Norcross, both capable
of Riving Allen, French, and Madison
a battle. In the bamboo event, Hub
bard and Livingston are both capable
of better than 13 feet, a height as yet
attained only with difficulty by Berry,
Stanford's leading vaulter.
Broad Jump Is Toss-up
A real battle is in store in the broad
jump where Paul and Barber com
pete against Dowcll. West, and Put
icr, with all five capable of leaping
beyond the 2.5 ft. 6 in. mark. In the
