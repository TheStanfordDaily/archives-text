## 
### 
Last night a doughty hand of Cardinal trackstcrs, headed hv
their doughty leader. Robert Lyman Templeton, left I'alo \lto on
a great adventure.
'I hey are to storm the reputedly impregnable gates of Troy;
dies are out t<» heal the unbeatable legion of Dean Cromwell.
11 is a big order. Stanford may win tomorrow, but the chances
of victory are slim—terribly slim.
\\ ith the scales standing as they do just now. the weight heavily
in the side of the southerners, a victory would he great.
lint win or lose, Stanford men and women have the satisfaction
•it knowing that the Cardinal's Templeton coached squadron will
fight against odds to a hitter end. The team has always done that
against S. C.'s sterling track and field men; and the team will do it
again tomorrow.
Stanford men and women may know, 100, that the Cardinal
team, coached by Templeton, will in winning or losing, make manv
more points than it would without "I Jink's" guiding hand. Temple
ton makes athletes. Templeton makes points. Templeton "smart
ness" means to the Cardinal track squad, just what W arner "smart
ness" means to the C ardinal gfid squad.
And so. without knowing what the outcome will be down there
on the Occidental track tomorrow, the Daily congratulates Temple
ton and his men. It will he a great victory or a great defeat.
