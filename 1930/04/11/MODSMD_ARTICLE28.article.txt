# THE 						ROBLE CRIMINAL CODE
## 
### 
Yesterday's Daii.y carried the ] »athetic tale of five Stanford
students —feminine in sex, of course, who were denied the boon of
leeping out under (iod's heaven because of another stupid Roble
ruling.
The quintet of Roblites, freshmen who were, still laboring under
the illusion that at Stanford they could live like human beings,
narrowly missed an all-night lockout while sleeping on the upper
porch in the back of the 11 all.
Staying out after 1 :30 a. m. and walking in the hills at any
hour in parties of less than four (or is it six?) have long been
recognized as social crimes at Stanford. And this fresh-air offense
has probably long been on the Roble criminal code, but few were
aware of that fact.
To correct this general ignorance the Daii.y wishes to state
again Stanford women do not sleep out on porches at night and
commune with nature, not if they are imbued with the correct tone,
anyhow.
