If figures of prohibition polls taken among the students of east
ern and middle western universities and colleges are anv indication
of true student opinion, then the institutions of high learning must
appear as saloons to the rest of the country.
The collegiate press, in keeping with its more professional con
temporary. has taken sides in the prohibition controversy. With the
results of these polls before them, the newspapers on the wet side
have gleefully seized upon the figures to refute arguments of noted
educators at the recent Senatorial investigations, who maintained
lhat the liquor problem does not constitute a serious question since
only a small minority of students do any drinking.
The figures, as reprinted from the I Diversity of Wisconsin's
"The Daily Cardinal," a wet publication, are: "The total vote re
turned was 22,2K2, of which 11,1(>7, or just over one-half, were
for modification; 5/>Bl for repeal; 4/)00 for strict enforcement and
834 for continuation of present conditions."
These journals do not stop to consider that perhaps the polls
failed to represent the typical student's opinion of the matter. The
votes were conducted by those with an axe to grind (no pun).
They were frankly hopeful of ballot returns to indicate that stu
dents were dissatisfied with prohibition.
Muvbe students are dissatisfied with prohibitionâ€”maybe they
aren't. In any event, straw votes constitute no reliable means of
securing an opinion on anything.
