WINTER SONATA. By Dorothy
Edwards. Dutton Co., publish
ers. 1930.
Novels arc sometimes written very
successfully without heroes, or uitli
oul heroines, hut a novel completely
without a plot is a litlle harder to ac
cepl. "Winter Sonata" not only lias
neiilier hero nor heroine, hut appar
ently lacks the slightest vestige of a
plot.
Here is what the author does: she
takes six characters all of them
young people -and draws slow vague
portrays of eaelt of them, never at all
definite about anything they feel or
think. This vagueness is one of the
chief points in the author's style, al
lowing her to end the book with the
characters seemingly in exactly the
same place at which they started
after two hundred pages in which the
only things worthy to be called inci
dents are the walks which the charac
ters all have a habit of taking. The
background for the story is a little
New England village, where the onl>
diversions are going for walks in the
aiternoons and mornings, and 'gather
ing in little groups to sing or talk in
the evenings.
With such material, most modern
authors would indulge in a profound
psychological study of these charac
ters, tracing all their thoughts, explain
ing all their reactions with tortuous de
tail. But Dorothy Edwards has a
method all her own. She employs a
style that is so simple, so free from
any adornment, so without emphasis,
that it lias a curious resemblance to
very, very early literature, that is still
quite undeveloped. However, its ab
sence of all plot or dramatic implica
tions deprives it of any force.
It is a very restful book, and a not
too demanding reader might appreciate
its serenity, and find it a welcome
change from the too brilliantly com
plex novels which even the youngest
writers are turning out today. Un
doubtedly there is a rare beauty in
many of the passages on natural scen
ery, which the author handles with a
skill that is surprising, since she re
fuses to depart from the one or two
syllabled word and short simple sen
tence "idea of her style.

JEWS WITHOUT MONEY. By

'"Jews Without Money," the remark
able autobiography of a boy who some

i how managed to learn the two j»reat
lessons of the sidewalks of .New York:
"I low to Me lough, and Mow to Be
lender," is a revelation of Kast Side
life in which the tender spots as well
as the calluses are uncovered.
I h cause one Jevv embodies so com
pletely every experience, ambition,
emotion that his people have known
, since the days of Abraham, Michael
(iold acquaints the reader with the
Jewish nation complete. Hut it is the
Jewish nation of the Kast Side, the
| million Jews who hate America, who
j admire America "ii is America that
has taught the sons of tubercular Jew '
isli tailors how to kill."
These Jews, with their desire for
, beauty, are lixed as inescapable to their
present surroundings as to their past
history the noise, always noise, tilth,
yelling, talk of tall tenements rising
above a choked street, "a tenement
canyon hung with lire' escapes, bed
clothing, and faces."
Michael (iold presents his "Poppa,"
■ who came to America as a young im
migrant to lind that it " 'was not a land
of fun. It was ;i Land of Hurry-Dp.
There was no gold to be dug in the
streets here. Derbies were not fun
ha Is for holidays. I hey were work
bats.'" And drawn with sure lingers
is the picture of "Motnma," who "was
a buttinsky," who "tried to 'reform' ,
everybody, and fought people because ,
they were- 'bad'," who was no longer
grieved when she found that only I
l hristians had been killed in a railroad
accident but who, paradoxically!
enough, befriended (ientile and Jew
alike. "She was always apologetic 1
about this. 'These are not like other
('hristians,' she would say, 'these art'
' good people.' I low could she resist
another human being in trouble?' 1 "'

lowing her to end the book with the
characters seemingly in exactly the
same place at which they started
after two hundred pages in which the
only things worthy to be called inci
dents are the walks which the charac

background for the story is a little
New England village, where the onl>
diversions are going for walks in the
aiternoons and mornings, and 'gather
ing in little groups to sing or talk in
the evenings.
With such material, most modern
authors would indulge in a profound
psychological study of these charac

ing all their reactions with tortuous de
tail. But Dorothy Edwards has a
method all her own. She employs a
style that is so simple, so free from
any adornment, so without emphasis,
that it lias a curious resemblance to
very, very early literature, that is still
quite undeveloped. However, its ab
sence of all plot or dramatic implica
tions deprives it of any force.
It is a very restful book, and a not
too demanding reader might appreciate
its serenity, and find it a welcome
change from the too brilliantly com
plex novels which even the youngest
writers are turning out today. Un
doubtedly there is a rare beauty in
many of the passages on natural scen

skill that is surprising, since she re
fuses to depart from the one or two
syllabled word and short simple sen
tence "idea of her style.

ing in little groups to sing or talk in
the evenings.
With such material, most modern
authors would indulge in a profound
psychological study of these charac
ters, tracing all their thoughts, explain
ing all their reactions with tortuous de
tail. But Dorothy Edwards has a
method all her own. She employs a
style that is so simple, so free from
any adornment, so without emphasis,
that it lias a curious resemblance to
very, very early literature, that is still
quite undeveloped. However, its ab
sence of all plot or dramatic implica
tions deprives it of any force.
It is a very restful book, and a not
too demanding reader might appreciate
its serenity, and find it a welcome
change from the too brilliantly com
plex novels which even the youngest
writers are turning out today. Un
doubtedly there is a rare beauty in
many of the passages on natural scen
ery, which the author handles with a
skill that is surprising, since she re
fuses to depart from the one or two
syllabled word and short simple sen
tence "idea of her style.

JEWS WITHOUT MONEY. By

'"Jews Without Money," the remark
able autobiography of a boy who some

i how managed to learn the two j»reat
lessons of the sidewalks of .New York:
"I low to Me lough, and Mow to Be
lender," is a revelation of Kast Side
life in which the tender spots as well
as the calluses are uncovered.
I h cause one Jevv embodies so com
pletely every experience, ambition,
emotion that his people have known
, since the days of Abraham, Michael
(iold acquaints the reader with the
Jewish nation complete. Hut it is the
Jewish nation of the Kast Side, the
| million Jews who hate America, who
j admire America "ii is America that
has taught the sons of tubercular Jew '
isli tailors how to kill."
These Jews, with their desire for
, beauty, are lixed as inescapable to their
present surroundings as to their past
history the noise, always noise, tilth,
yelling, talk of tall tenements rising
above a choked street, "a tenement
canyon hung with lire' escapes, bed
clothing, and faces."
Michael (iold presents his "Poppa,"
■ who came to America as a young im
migrant to lind that it " 'was not a land
of fun. It was ;i Land of Hurry-Dp.
There was no gold to be dug in the
streets here. Derbies were not fun
ha Is for holidays. I hey were work
bats.'" And drawn with sure lingers
is the picture of "Motnma," who "was
a buttinsky," who "tried to 'reform' ,
everybody, and fought people because ,
they were- 'bad'," who was no longer
grieved when she found that only I
l hristians had been killed in a railroad
accident but who, paradoxically!
enough, befriended (ientile and Jew
alike. "She was always apologetic 1
about this. 'These are not like other
('hristians,' she would say, 'these art'
' good people.' I low could she resist
another human being in trouble?' 1 "'

WINTER SONATA. By Dorothy
Edwards. Dutton Co., publish
ers. 1930.
Novels arc sometimes written very
successfully without heroes, or uitli
oul heroines, hut a novel completely
without a plot is a litlle harder to ac
cepl. "Winter Sonata" not only lias
neiilier hero nor heroine, hut appar
ently lacks the slightest vestige of a
plot.
Here is what the author does: she
takes six characters all of them
young people -and draws slow vague
portrays of eaelt of them, never at all
definite about anything they feel or
think. This vagueness is one of the
chief points in the author's style, al
lowing her to end the book with the
characters seemingly in exactly the
same place at which they started
after two hundred pages in which the
only things worthy to be called inci
dents are the walks which the charac
ters all have a habit of taking. The
background for the story is a little
New England village, where the onl>
diversions are going for walks in the
aiternoons and mornings, and 'gather
ing in little groups to sing or talk in
the evenings.
