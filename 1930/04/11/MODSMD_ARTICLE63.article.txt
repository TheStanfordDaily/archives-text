# WILLIS SEES WHITE AFRICAN FARMER IN EXTINCTION PROCESS
## 
### 
"Africa is an empty continent;!
full of blacks. It is a rich continent; j
yet full of poverty, Ldving condi
tions are extremely luxuriant; and
yet there is probably more misery ;
and unemployment than in any j
j other part of the globe. It is a con- I
I tlnent of tremendous resources; |
and yet the white man loses money. |
It is these contrasts that makes !
Africa so fascinating."
Thus Dr. Bailey Willis, Professor j
Emeritus of Geology, summed up ;
his impressions of the continent in I
which he recently conducted a j
year's expedition for the purpose |
of studying the general causes of !
earthquakes, to the Stanford chap- i
ter of Phi Beta Kappa at a meeting j
in the Men's Faculty Club last !
; night.
"The outlook for the white man
I in Africa is very serious," declared I
i Professor Willis. "The negro can |
be taught to do anything the white
man can do, and he can do it so
much cheaper that big companies ;
will buy raw products from him. ;
In fifty years there will probably j
not be a white farmer left in trop- j
ical Africa. As an administrator j
and a eivilizer the white man will !
remain, but as a settler his posi- j
tion is untenable."
