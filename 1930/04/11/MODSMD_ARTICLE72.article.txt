# "BEEG STRONG MEN GET BEEG MONEY THESE DAYS"..........
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY, '16 
The jolly old sport of wrestling
j seems in for a bit of a revival,
j Perhaps these old eauliflowered
| ears of mine do distinguish a slight
tintinnabulation of the bally-ballv
hoo in those reports about the im
portation of Mr. (Kappa Kappa)
'Gama to these shores next fall, but
just the same the "beeg strong
fellahs" are making more dough
than the Sharkeys, Sehmelings, aijijl
Scotts, year in and year out. They
make it in small chunks, to he
sure, but they perform anywhere I
from two to tive nights a week.
Wrestling has always been a
sport among men ever since Cain
and Abel grappled with each other
on the greensward of .The Garden
of Eden. Most of«tlu» strong men i
of antiquity were great wrestlers,
and from the records of the first.
Olympic games we get accurate
accounts of the deeds of the mat
champions as far back as 77« B.C.
The first great champion, who, nil

less the records were grossly exag
gerated, could easily pull an arm
off of Dick Shikat or Gus Sonnen
; berg, was Milo of Crotona, hero of
J six Olympic. games. He was unde-1
: fcated for more tlian twenty years,
iti both wrestling and pankration,
and, so the story goes, trained by j
carrying around a young calf. As j
the calf grew up, the wrestler grew i
stronger, until finally Milo was ac- i
| tually packing around a, full-grown
] ox on his back for exercise! Quite j
! an appetite, had this guy Milo, too. j

lie ate all of a four-year-old heifer ;
one day, according to an ancienl
epigram, which, my hearties, is
quite a meal . . . and also quite
i an epigram!
it is a far cry from Milo and his
ox to Shikat, Sonnenberg, (Jama,
J and the "bull" that makes up the]
j ballyhoo for a championship match
today, but probably there was more 1
i than one claimant for the title in
i ancient Greek times, even as there !
j is now. Remember how St rangier I
j Lewis and Joe Steelier each claimed |

' U)p world's heavyweight title for
throe years, until finally they got
together in February I!)2<S, Lewis
winning, only to lose his title later
on lo Dynamite (Jus Sonnenberg,
former Dartmouth and Detroit foot
hall player? Dick Shikat, Philadel
! pliiu German, is recognized in some
i places, New York and Philadelphia,
anyway, as the present titleholder.
; Me is a very busy athlete, and his
! manager and backers claim that
Son nen berg, a so-called "trust"
wrestler, will not meet him.
