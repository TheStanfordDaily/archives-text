# Horner to Face Card Nine in Second Game of Series
## VARSITY JOSSERS CONCEDED CHANCE TO DEFEAT BEARS Wolter To Give Loomis Another Chance at U.C. Batsmen 
### Howard Moore 
Once again, Stanford's basebal
varsity will face Little Norm lloi
! ner of California when Coacl
Harry Walter's ball-fossers journe*
Over to Berkeley tomorrow tor tin
second tilt of the annual Card Reai
three-game scries. Going on tin
slab on Southwest Field at :'.:l
sharp, I lie well-known custodian o
the axe handle will endeavor u
pitch his way to his fifth consecu
live victory over the S!anl'or<
l'orc;es.
Last week the Berkeley (wirier
who led the Conference pitcher
last year and bids fair to repen
this season, managed to srpiee/i
out his fourth straight win by ;
shaky ninth-inning rally thai nel
■ted the Hears two runs and a ?-i
ball game. Last year Horner star!
Ed out with it 7-2 walkaway, bn
just won by a whisker in the olhe
two battles by scores of -1-2 am
•9-8. In the third fracas, the Card:
I finally managed to knock the Hint
and Gold moundsman out of tin
box, but he received credit, for th<
victory anyway. Two and threi
years ago when Gus Nemechel
pulled the same trick, winning (i\•
out of five games, the Hears wot
by narrow margins. If Home
pitches with a horseshoe in hi
pocket tomorrow, the Cards are ii
I for another beating, hut they an
by no means the underdogs.
Play at Berkeley
In fact tiie only edge that tin
I IT.C. outfit has, is the advantagi
'of playing on their own field am
of greatly less distraction from tin
| fans. And if Junior managers oi
j the Hear team keep the crowd
J from drooling out over the foul 1 in<
land into the field, maybe the Red
: shirts will have a chance to sua?
a few of those foul flies that go
lost in the midst of the mobs las
Saturday.
Approximately 200 Stanford sli
(dents were in the howling jam o
11,000 people that saw the game ,
week ago, the largest crowd ii
history, but now that the axe epi
sode is cooling a. bit, there wil
probably be a smaller attendant
another item in favor of Wolier'
men.
The Cardinal mentor is playin
a new infield, one that showed u
well against IJ.C.L.A. Tuesday a
; ternoon, and one lhat should g
I great tomorrow. Mears will be o
'first, Cutshaw on the keyston
! sack, Churchill in the hot cornel
and Johnson at short, ilunken an
Rintala will patrol the left an
center sections of the outer gai
| dens, willi either Herg, Cook, o
| Campbell in the right wing.
Hardy will be behind the bo
; and Loomis is slated to start o
I the mound with the entire pile!
ing staff ready to go in at the lin
indication of weakening.
Smith Bear Catcher
Hattling Joe Smith will be recei
ing Horner's curves tomorro\
while the usual IT.C. infield of Wi
liams, Captain Valianos, Swensoi
land Hutler will handle the positioi
'starting from first to third. Glai
ter, Kirwin, and Burgett will roa
the cornfields.
Since the game is practically
I toss-up, and the yellow bear Zer
line sign may have its lies
chopped off, it is interesting
wonder what sort of a game w
be played here on Big Meet I)i
if the teams are one up. Suffi<
it to say, the deciding war won
draw the crowd, certainly not Dii
Templeton's annual farce on tl
cinderpath. Maybe a diamond con
be rigged up inside the stadium
accommodate the multitude. An
way KFRC wouldn't have to wi
its "mike" to the backstop as it lu
to up at Berkeley.
