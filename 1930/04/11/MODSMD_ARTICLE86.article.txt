Step R I IGHT up, folks. For a
paltry sum you can see THE
GREATEST — abloute-lee THE
greatest animal show on earth!
The finest collection of wild and
woolly track men ever seen under
canvas—gathered from the far
corners of the earth regardless of
expense! See the FIERCE TRO
JAN! Neither walks, talks, eats,
nor sleeps, but crawls on his stom
ach like a REP-TIILE! See him
devour the Stanford Cardinal BE
FORE YOUR VERY EYES! Step
right up folks—your money re
funded if the Cardinal gets rough.
For "Dapper Dink" Templeton,
Stanford's Merlin of the Track and
Field, will he 011 hand ;it Occidental
prepared to mystify, startle, sur
prise, and stupefy supporters of
Die mighty Trojans.
Not that Dink makes any pre
tense of being able to draw rabbits
oitt of a bat.
But when it comes to the art of
extracting points out of the thin
air Templeton is a past master.
And he'll have to bo . . .
For if a majority opinion is to
be trusted, Stanford i: NOT doped
lii win tomorrow.
Great!
This is the fourth consecutive
year thai I'.S.C. has been favored
to triumph over the Cardinal
I racksters.
Take a look at the past scores:
1020 (S) 7*l, (USC) 57
1 028 (S) 77, (CSC) r>4
1027 tsi 7ft, (i'so r»<;
You never can tell from whence
Templeton will gather points. It
will not surprise us overmuch to
pick up a Sunday paper and read
a headline ot the effect that '-HAR
LOW ROTHERT CAPTURES LOW
HURDLES IN U.S.C. MEET" or
"FLEISHHACKER RUNS GREAT
RELAY LAP TO CINCH MEET
FOR CARDS."
Frank Wykoff, Cromwell's travel
ling track assistant, won't have
any time to deliver pep talks to'
Maurer whilst ambling down the
st might a way.
All Wykoff has to do tomorrow
is reach the tape ahead of H< c
Dyer. Not only once, but twkQ.
And Dyer has his own thoughts
about that. Have you ever seen a
scared jackrabbit run?
If, as Maxwell Stiles of the Los
Angeles Examiner depicts, Bob
Hall, Trojan weight man, bites his
lip until it bleeds as he envisions
his ideal discus tosser, Clarence I
"ibid" Houser, Mr. Hall stands a |
good chance of losing bis entire'
lower jaw should be bend his gaze
100 avidly upon Eric- Krenz.
However, if Mr. Hall's abilities
in tossing the shot approach his
reported prowess in "tossing his
proud head," it will be a sad day
for that mediocre trio of weight
men, Rothert, Krenz, and Herman
Hrix.
With all due allowances for the
publicity bureau of the Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce and corres
ponding additions to wailings and
hair-tearings of Gloomy Dean Crom
well, the impression persists that
the Trojans have a fair track team.
In fact, without casting any as
persions on the veracity of various
southern news agencies, it is a
fairly safe bet that the Trojan
"cripples" will be able to navigate
minus their crutches on Saturday.
But what of it? HATE SOUTH
ERN CALIFORNIA! Catch the
euphony, the essen Anyway,
who's got the axe?
