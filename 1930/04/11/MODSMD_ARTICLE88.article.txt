# Babes Favored to Beat Cub Tracksters
## RECORDS SURE TO FALL IN LITTLE BIG MEET TODAY Eastman Certain To Set New 440 Mark; Shot Record Unsafe 
### Bill French 
Coach Bill Ellington and his
freshman track team will meet
in the Union where lunch will
be served to the squad at
11:15. The bus will leave there
for Berkeley at 12 o'clock.

Record-shat I ering performances
are expected when the Stanford
and California freshman track
and field squads go into action in
their annual meet which starts at
2 o'clock this afternoon on the
California oval. Two of the strong
est yearling squads ever to repre
sent cither institution will be com
peting with the Cardinals favored
to will by in points or so.
Captain Hen Eastman will not
only be leading his team in its at
tempt to make it seven straight
track victories in seven years for
Stanford's freshmen, but will also
be leading the assault on the stand
ing meet records. The present
quarter-mile mark is 50 3-5 sec
onds set last year by "Ike" Hables.
In every meet ibis season Eastman
has bettered that time. His best
time of 48 1-5 made last week is
over two seconds faster than the
record.
Half-Mile Record Secure
George Naylon and Frank Ful
lenwider, Stanford's pair of half*
toilers, have an excellent chance of
(tracking even time in their race,
but Elmer Hoyden's old record of
1 :57 1-5 will probably not be en
dangered. There is a chance that
California's miler, Frank Lucas,
might crack "Spud" Mossman's rec
ord of 4:20.7 made in 1028. Lucas
ran the first race of the season in
4:-10. He cut that down to 4:3(5 and
last week ran the four laps in
4::!.'! I-."). With Bob Hunter of Stan
ford, who has run in 4:39, pushing
him, Lucas may lop another three
or four seconds off his time.
Ken Churchill may see this
year's crop of California frosh
javelin-tossers break his record of
187 feet 11 'i inches. John Kearney
has thrown the spear 185 feet 7 1 / &
inches, and Jim Miles has thrown
it 183 feet 10. Either one of these
boys is liable to add the two or
three feet necessar yto displace
the record.
Charles Vantress of California
has already pole-vaulted 12 feet 5
inches which is an inch higher than
Ned Johns' "Little-Big Meet" mark
of 12 feet 4 inches set last year.
Vantress has been consistent at
close to this height all season and
should establish u new record.
Blackman After 2 Marks
There is a possibility that Bob
King's freshman record of G feet
2 inches in the high jump may join
the discard. Don Blackman of the
Card yearlings has been consistent
at 0 feet and slightly above. Black
man has a chance to shatter the
broad jump record, too. The pres
ent mark is 22 feet 4 inches. He
has leaped 21 feet 10 inches on sev
eral occasions.
Stanford's incomparable pair of
freshman weight-tossers may break
one and possibly two records. Last
week Here La horde put the shot
40 feet 11 inches, which mark ex
ceeds Eric Krenz's record fo 46
feet 8 1 /2 inches made in l'J27. Nel
son Gray pushed the pellet out to
40 feet 8. Both of them should re
peat and even better their own
best marks of the season.
