"The most widespread criticism of
student government in the colleges of
the country is its lack of continuity,"
said Dean Mary Yost, who returned
recently from the Deans' ( oiifercncc
in Atlantic City, where the problems
of living group distribution and self
government were discussed, in an in
terview for the Daily.
"This lack of continuity is caused
by an almost 100 per cent turnover
in the student officers who must spend
a great part of their year in office
learning the ins and outs <>t" their po
sitions," continued Miss Yost. "It is
very difficult under these conditions to
have a purposeful policy worked out.
"The principles of student govern
ment were the subject of common in
terest in the convention," said Miss
Yost. " The specific regulations always
grow out of the local conditions, but
there are. certain difficulties which arc
faced by college deans over the coun
try. The first is the difficulty of find
ing the rightful place of self-govern
ment in the administrative system, and
the second is to find some method
whereby the continuity of student gov
ernment can bo made effective so that
there can be real progress.
"One of the greatest problems con
fronting the deans is the lack of un
derstanding among the students as to
the real meaning of self-government
as a condition where the students can

do as they please, without any feeling
of responsibility to the university or
to the group outside. The student
leaders usually are interested in only
one part of a community administra
tion and before they have time to see
the organic whole, their tenure of of
fice is finished."
Miss Yost left Stanford February I
and went to Denver, and from there
to New York. She visited V'assar,
New Haven, RadelifTe College in Bos
ton where she was particularly inter
ested in the Judge Baker Clinic which
studies juvenile court work. In Phila
delphia she was entertained by the
Stanford Club under the direction «»»"
Harriett Warrell, and in that city she
visited Dr. Marion Kay, who was di
rector at Stanford last summer quar
ter.
Alter the Conference, where Miss
Yost was the head of one of the four
individual discussion groups into which
the deans were divided, she went to
New York, where a tea was given her
by the Stanford Club at the Pauhel
lenic Hotel. On her return to the cam
pus through ( hicago, she went by way
of Ann Arbor where "the new wom
en's Union League building is a monu
ment t<» what women can really do if
they want to." According to the wom
en's dean it is one of the loveliest club
houses in the country, and il is used
by the men as much as h\ the women.
