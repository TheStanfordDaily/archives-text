Pipes save no
midnight oil
IF PIPES made the man, anybody
at all could rise in the world just
by smoking a few pounds of Edge
worth. But pipes do not make the man.
Men make the pipe—most men do.
Somewhat depends on the individual,
more on the pipe, and the tobacco is
most important of all. Things must
be congenial.
Edgeworth is a congenial tobacco,
cool, slow-burning, fully flavored.
Edgeworth has poise, kindly good
nature, real tobacco personality —
Edgeworth welcomes new friends.
Many a good man has been pledged
to pipes by Edgeworth alone.
Like to meet Edgeworth? Just ask
with the coupon—and the postman
will bring your first few pipefuls of
the genuine, three years seasoned if
it's a day. Our treat, if you please.
Others have found Edgeworth and
quit their discontent.
So may it be with you!
