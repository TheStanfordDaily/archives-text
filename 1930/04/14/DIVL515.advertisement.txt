Cupol as controlled
from the laboratory
White hot rivers of metal, pouring from big
cupulas in Crane foundries, are even more
thoroughly analyzed, more carefully watched,
than the drinking water pouring from a faucet
in a well-ordered city. 1
#
Because correct chemical ingredients in valve
metals are as essential to absolute safety and
right functioning of a piping installation as
pure water to human health, Crane Co. has
always maintained laboratory control of its
cupolas.
This means that experts in the metallurgical
and physical testing of metals are responsible
for the quality of every valve and fitting turned
out. It means that tensile strength, yield point,
elongation, and reduction of area of test bars
taken every hour of the day's run are known to
laboratory and cupola chemists.
it means that constantly, as the metals pour
out, the proportion of silicon, manganese, car
bon,phosphorus,calcium, pure iron, are known
and uniformly maintained. It means immedi
ate correction of any variation and rejection of
faulty materials.
From specifications of raw materials to final
installation, Crane Co. knows its products and
what they will do. How Crane Co. developed
the background for this knowledge makes an
absorbing story. It is titled Pioneering in Science.
You are cordially invited to send for your copy.
Aside from its interest, you will find it a splen
