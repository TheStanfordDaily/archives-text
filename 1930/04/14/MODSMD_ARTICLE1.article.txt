ford Airport, 11 *â€¢11 ry Michaels,
Stanford senior, and William Dohr
lnann .of San Francisco cheated
dealh in a spectacular parachute
jump Saturday.
Colliding in mid-air, the two
planes were disabled when their
wings locked and shattered. The
wrecked machines hurtled to the
ground, while their pilots, escaped
death by parachutes, which opened
alter a drop of about 500 feet. A
strong wind carried the pair to
ward the bay, and by shortening
tile shrouds of the chutes in mid
air, they landed safely in the
marshes that border the Leslie
Salt. Works near the flying field.
1 loth planes were Curtiss-Wright
ships from the Berest'ord port.
Michaels Cut
Slight, injuries were suffered by
both men. Michaels was cut by
shattered glass from his goggles as
lie leapt, and Dohrmann sprained
his ankle and was cut and bruised
in landing. They are amateur pilots
of about thirty-live hours' flying ex
perience. Michaels obtained most
of his training at the Palo Alto
School of Aviation on the campus.
Thus, the "Caterpillar Club" has
gained two new members. The or
ganization is made up of men who
have cheated death by leaping to
safety in parachutes. Dohrmann,
a I'niversity of California gradu
ate. is the son of A. B. C. Dohr
mann of San Francisco. Michaels,
son of C. F. Michaels of Atherton,
