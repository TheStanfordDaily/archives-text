# CAMPUS SPEED VIOLATORS ALL TELL SAME STORIES SAYS DAVIS
## 
### BY WILLIAM WALLS 
"Golf engagements, lock-out
• rules, tardiness to class or meals
| constitute the majority of excuses
i which students give wlien stopped
| for speeding, stated Gordon
I Davis, campus day cop, who hegan
j his jolt about a month ago stopping
j violators of the University speed
laws.
"Most of the excuses, each of
which seems to vary but little
from the type, sound rather silly
! when heard from the second to the
j ninety-ninth time," stated the cam
pus nemesis in an interview with
j the Daily yesterday.
"However," Davis stated, "all the
Stanford students with whom I
have come in contact have been
good sports. 1 have never yet found
one to talk hack and none have

complained of a raw deal or of
(.rouble caused for nothing."
When asked about drinking
among students the Farm's shep
herd answered, "I have yet to see
a student under the influence of
liquor at (he wheel of a. car."
Davis said be bad been warned
by (he Palo Alto police that he
would be snowed under with viola
tions. but he has not found it so.
He seems to think that several
habitual violators make all the
trouble and it is these which cause
the police t<> think that all Stan
ford drivers are alike.
"There are also many high
school youths and people from the
city who, thinking they are emu
lating students, 'whoop if up' and
otherwise cause a disturbance, thus
giving Stanford a bad name."
