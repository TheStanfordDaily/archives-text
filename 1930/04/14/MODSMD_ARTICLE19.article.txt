# MODERN POETRY IS KIND BEST LIKED BY STANFORD STUDENTS
## 
### 
"Modern poetry," says Mrs. Eliza
| both Anderson, who is in charge \
! of tin; non-textbooks in the Book
j store," is perhaps more popular
| with Stanford students than any |
other type of literature."
Mrs. Anderson believes that peo
i pie are realizing more and more
1 the importance of books and that,
in spite of the fact that there have
| never been so many lending libra-.
| lies, the number of people who are
I buying their own books for per-
I sonal use is increasing proportion-!
lately. She believes that reading,
j creates a desire for more books
| and that this is responsible in part
i for the great increase in the num-i
j her of books sold. In furnishing
j good books in inexpensive editions,
I the Bookstore is tilling an inipor
; tant place in campus life.
