DOS ANGELES, April I.J.
j (Special to the Daily) Exceeding
I the expectations of even their most
ardent supporters, the Trojans
I overwhelmed Dink Templeton's
j hard-lighting Cardinal track and
| field team N4 to 47 at Patterson
1" ield, Occidental College, yesterday
afternoon.
Undiscouraged by the heavy lead
j amassed against them, the Red
j shirts grabbed a large share <>I the
I glory when Stanford's relay team
upset predictions to beat out Crom
| well's hitherto undefeated quartet
j in the world record breaking time
of three minutes, fifteen arid two
fifths seconds.
Trojans Score
j Three clean sweeps were scored
I by the Trojans in the half-mile, the
javelin, and the low hurdles, in the
latter race, Stanford expectations
were blasted when Podge Smith, a
favorite to take this event, tied up
only a short way from the start,
while A 1 Nisbet, who was running
in second place, lost his stride on
approaching the final barrier.
Hec Dyer stole the show as far
as individual honors were con
I eerned, beating the highly touted
I Wykoff in the hundred and lying
the Trojan sprinter in the furlong.
World records were approached in
eaclr event, Dyer winning the cen
tury in nine and three-fifths sec
onds and running the two-twenty in
twenty-one and two fifths. Maurer
and Guyer placed third respective
lly in the two dashes.
Dyer Stars
Southern California started
I promptly their task of handing thr
Cardinals their worst beating since
I the advent of Templeton as track
coach, when Halstead outsprinfed
his teammate, Hansen, to win the
] mile in 4:24:2. Bob Brown placed
j third after holding second place
I until the hall-way mark of the final
i lap.
Johnny Morrison did the ex
jpected, winning the quarter from
j Williams in the fast time of IX:;!,
! while Ike 1 tables fought hi ; way
into third place. In one of the
closest races of the day, Welch

I sticks, with Stokes capturing third
'position. The time was 15 seconds

; hand trick when Parker and Nunc..
| fought their way into second and
I third place in the mile, upsettini

and brilliant race, setting a slow
pace and then sprinting Parker ofi!

Cromwell's trio of halfmilei ,
j Burke, llalstead. and McGcagh,
