What docs a college president do all day long?
Most undergraduates do not know. To them, lie is nothing J
more than an occasional topic for hull sessions or a dark, forehod
ing figure into whose gloomv ahode misdoers go to receive heavy
punishments for trifling offenses.
Dean Max McC'onn of l.ehii-h I'niversitv in a recent article iu
the Xorlh American Review portrays the college president as a
harrowed executive plying "a dangerous trade." holding down a
"man killing job."
\n average presidential day, according to Dean Mc( nun:
"When he arrives at his office at ') :30 the architects are waiting
for him with plans for the new botanical greenhouses . , . an en
larged swimming pool ... a new set ol roads and walks on the
South Campus, All these projects will cost more than previously!
estimated, hut siirelv in view of their obvious desirability the presi
dent can find the money.
"Next conies the alumni secretary with the preliminary layout
of a 'drive' for an additional ten millions of endowment. . . .
"Then perhaps the dean slips in with a particularly nasty case
of student discipline, a case which must be handled firmly in the
interest of student morale, yet discreetly if the name of the uni
versity is not to be smirched. . . .
"After the dean. Assistant l'rofessor Jones, with the double
purpose of pleading for an increase in salary and sowing innuendoes
against the head of bis department, whose responsibilities, it may
h( inferred, could be infinitely better discharged by l'rofessor Jones
himself.
"|ones eventually thrown out, but is promptly succeeded by
the director of athletics, with a subtle plan for so handling Sub
freshman Day that it will attract the largest number of desirable
football candidates without appearing to seek that end or drawing
animadversions from the Carnegie Foundation.
"Meanwhile the president's secretary has brought in the morn
ing's mail, including, besides seven questionnaires and ten advertise-'
incuts .... three complaints from parents of the faculty instruction
and unjust treatment their sons are receiving, two explosions from
alumni who are rabid because the team lost the last big game, and
a postal card from A Citizen and Taxpayer' denouncing the whole
institution as a sink of ini<|uitv and a breeder of irrcligion and !
sedition.''
