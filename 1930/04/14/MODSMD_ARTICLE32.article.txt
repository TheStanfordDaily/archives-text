YEAR IN, YOU'RE OUT. By Sam-I
. uel Hoffenstein. Horace Live
right, New York, 1930. At the
Palo Alto Book Shop
This new volume of verses by j
the author of "Poems in Praise of I
Practically Nothing" will prove (lis- I
appointing to those who gasped '
and shrieked over the earlier book, j
To one who missed the Injurious j
experience of the other volume,
"Year In, You're Out" may per- :
haps he amusing. The very title of '
the hook reveals its weakness, a I
forced attempt to live up to the!
shocking and humorous tone of its j
predecessor.'
Hoffenstein mingles the serious;
with the comic and the pseudo
comic, in such a way as to test the j
leaders' versatility. This failure to j
establish a mood may account in j
part for the fact that his serious j
poems are not moving and his com- '
ic ones are not funny. However, j
he was obviously not destined for
the realms of higher poetry; and
equally obviously lie has written J
out his strain of audaciously enter-'
taining verse.
"Year In, You're Out" is feeble; ;
it lacks the last-line punch, of
"Poems in Praise of Practically
Nothing." But in justice let us say
that there are redeeming phrases,
lines, even whole stanzas. Coup
lets, Itare, Medium, and Well-Uone
is one section of the book which !
provides real amusement. II con
tains one poem entitled "Spiritual I
Ke'fised" with the first line,
"Swoop low, sweet Spiril of St.
Lou," >
i
which has the perfect, last line for
which Hoffenslein (and Dorothy
Parker) became famous. There
are, in the course of two hundred
and twenty-two pages, one or two!

observations such us iliis:
"Utile by little we subtract
Faith and Fallacy front Fact,
The Illusory from the True,
And starve upon the Residue."
If you find a few of these worth
the struggle through the inetaphys- i
ical wanderings of a vague mind,
then you will read "Year In, You're
Out."

YEAR IN, YOU'RE OUT. By Sam-I
. uel Hoffenstein. Horace Live
right, New York, 1930. At the
Palo Alto Book Shop
This new volume of verses by j
the author of "Poems in Praise of I
Practically Nothing" will prove (lis- I
appointing to those who gasped '
and shrieked over the earlier book, j
To one who missed the Injurious j
experience of the other volume,
"Year In, You're Out" may per- :
haps he amusing. The very title of '
the hook reveals its weakness, a I
forced attempt to live up to the!
shocking and humorous tone of its j
predecessor.'
Hoffenstein mingles the serious;
with the comic and the pseudo
comic, in such a way as to test the j
leaders' versatility. This failure to j
establish a mood may account in j
part for the fact that his serious j
poems are not moving and his com- '
ic ones are not funny. However, j
he was obviously not destined for
the realms of higher poetry; and
equally obviously lie has written J
out his strain of audaciously enter-'
taining verse.
"Year In, You're Out" is feeble; ;
it lacks the last-line punch, of
"Poems in Praise of Practically
Nothing." But in justice let us say
that there are redeeming phrases,
lines, even whole stanzas. Coup
lets, Itare, Medium, and Well-Uone
is one section of the book which !
provides real amusement. II con
tains one poem entitled "Spiritual I
Ke'fised" with the first line,
"Swoop low, sweet Spiril of St.
Lou," >
i
which has the perfect, last line for
which Hoffenslein (and Dorothy
Parker) became famous. There
are, in the course of two hundred
and twenty-two pages, one or two!

observations such us iliis:
"Utile by little we subtract
Faith and Fallacy front Fact,
The Illusory from the True,
And starve upon the Residue."
If you find a few of these worth
the struggle through the inetaphys- i
ical wanderings of a vague mind,
then you will read "Year In, You're
Out."
