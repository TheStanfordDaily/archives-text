### 
"Happy Days" almost fools you.
For a while you are sure that it |
it going to have a plot—and then .
it i urns out to be just another re
viii' after all. Still, it is one of the :
better revues. A dozen or so of the !
real favorites of the screen Met to
gether, and have such a Rood time
themselves that you sit there and
with them as well as at them
—and enjoy yourself hugely. Will
Rogers, Victor McClaglen, and Jim
f'orbett are outstanding in this ;
good-natured, exuberant group.
The snappiest: number in the!
show is the "I'm on a Diet of Love" !
song and dance feature, in which j
two newcomers —a blonde of dyna
mic cufeness, and a handsome hoy
with a very nice voice- prove to
be a team worth seeing.
Janet Uaynor and Charles Far
rell do a (harming love song to
gether giving the picture the need
ed romantic appeal. For the most i
past, "Happy Days" is simply a
clever, peppy ensemble of dialogues i
and solos by famous stars in a very j
informal mood, Interpreted by the 1
usual dazzling chorus work of tal
ented and beautiful choruses. The 1
tap dancing is particularly good -I
some of the hoofers are genuine:
