Well, children, here is a trio of
touching heart ballads to keep yon
aesthetically nourished till Wed
nesday:
FRUSTRATED
1 told myself this morning,
"Since love is growing cold,
'Twere better that 1 leave her;
She can be kindly told."
I told myself this morning
(It seemed the only way),
"Tomorrow 1 shall leave her" . . .
But she left nie today!

DISCOVERY
Look: what is this I've found? A
lock of hair;
Your lovely hair, that has not
any peer.
Just see how smooth il is, how soft,
how fair!
1 should rejoice tntflml this sou
venir.
â€¢
But no: I'm sad, and sad I shall re
main.
1 love your hair, sweetheart; but
though I stoop
To call it beautiful, I still maintain
1 do not like to find it in my soup.

"GIFTED CHILDREN" OR
"VARIATION ON A
POPULAR AIR"
(Dedicated to Dr. Lewis Madison
Terman)
I'm a genius, aren't we all?
Just a genius, but aren't we all?
In my dreams
Each night, it seems,
Ambition comes to call.
I can vision statues tall
(But derision if I fall!) . . .
Fame's ideal,
But then it isn't real,
And I'm a fool, . . . but aren't we
all?
