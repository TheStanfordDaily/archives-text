When college trncksters from nil
over tin* country make the annual
trek hi Cambridge near the end ol'
next month for the Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association of
America's annual blowont, it looks
as if the Templeton-Cromwell-
Christie combination is in for an
other big year.
The virile West will combat llio
effete East again, and barring
broken legs and train smashes, the
Occident should make off with the
title for another twelve months.
For seven times out of the last
mglit years, Western teams have
euptured the crown anil the Card
inal will probably net its fourth
straight title this year, followed
closely by Southern California with
California trailing not far to the
rear.
Eastern track authorities are
getting hot under the collar
to say the least at this seem
ingly endless bunch of shot
putters, discus men, broad
jumpers, pole-vaulters, javelin
tossers, and high-jumpers, and
even went so far as to threaten
to split the 1.C.4-A. into two
sections—track and field—but
nothing has been done as yet
about the situation.
This year, however, the West
will bring along some real track
stars in addition to its usual quota
of lield men. Dyer and Wykol'f will
carry on their pet feud and ought
to finish one-two in the sprints.
Then there's Guyer and Maurer of
S.C. and Giberson and Howell of
Stanford to till the bill.
Morrison should garner , a couple
of digits in the one-lap race and
Williams and Pearson of the Crom
well aggregation and Shove and
1 tables of the Redshirts may go
along to swell the western entries,
liurke of the parched Southland
may snag some points in the 880,
and his teammate Jlalstead and
Spud Mossman of California will
uphold the Pacific Coast: in the
mile, both having run the four cir
cuits under 4:2S last week against
very little competition. The two
mile is sadly lacking in Western
men, but the lanky Spud may run
llic ::r#2o yards instead of the mile,
and if so should bear up pretty
well.
Up to now we'll concede that
an Eastern team has a chance
to win, but when the field
events are considered from a
Western standpoint, the meet
does take on the aspect of be
ing a very icy foray. Krenz is
a cinch in the discus and Roth
ert and Krenz will take nine
points in the pellet-heaving
contest. Hall of U.S.C. ought
to grab a point or so in both
events, and Curtice and Church
ill of Cal and Mortenson of the
Southerners ought to have
things their way in the Greek
war event.
Although no Westerner k is espe
cially gifted with the elongated
bamboo, some of the four tbeti that
cleared 13 feet 3 inches down
South Saturday should lake a few
markers. King's record in the
spring event will hp endangered by
Van Osdel of S.C., who leaped up
(! feet 5% inches over the week
end, and Stewart .is go ml for a
place if he repeats with G feet 4
inches. Paul, Barber, and Dowell
all floated out over 24 feet into the
ozone at the IT.S.C. meet and that's
a broader jump than most. Eastern
ers can negotiate.
And a word about the stick
races. Here we have Podge
Smith battling with Welsh,
Carls, and Payne of Southern
California, and Captain Al
Pogolotti of the Bears. How's
a self-respecting Hahvad man
going to break into that bunch?
Too bad there isn't a mile re
lay; perhaps the Cards could
place in that too?

jumpers, pole-vaulters, javelin
tossers, and high-jumpers, and
even went so far as to threaten
to split the 1.C.4-A. into two
sections—track and field—but
nothing has been done as yet
about the situation.
This year, however, the West
will bring along some real track
stars in addition to its usual quota
of lield men. Dyer and Wykol'f will
carry on their pet feud and ought
to finish one-two in the sprints.
Then there's Guyer and Maurer of
S.C. and Giberson and Howell of
Stanford to till the bill.
Morrison should garner , a couple
of digits in the one-lap race and
Williams and Pearson of the Crom
well aggregation and Shove and
1 tables of the Redshirts may go
along to swell the western entries,
liurke of the parched Southland
may snag some points in the 880,
and his teammate Jlalstead and
Spud Mossman of California will
uphold the Pacific Coast: in the
mile, both having run the four cir
cuits under 4:2S last week against
very little competition. The two
mile is sadly lacking in Western
men, but the lanky Spud may run
llic ::r#2o yards instead of the mile,
and if so should bear up pretty
well.
Up to now we'll concede that
an Eastern team has a chance
to win, but when the field
events are considered from a
Western standpoint, the meet
does take on the aspect of be
ing a very icy foray. Krenz is
a cinch in the discus and Roth
ert and Krenz will take nine
points in the pellet-heaving
contest. Hall of U.S.C. ought
to grab a point or so in both
events, and Curtice and Church
ill of Cal and Mortenson of the
Southerners ought to have
things their way in the Greek
war event.
Although no Westerner k is espe
cially gifted with the elongated
bamboo, some of the four tbeti that
cleared 13 feet 3 inches down
South Saturday should lake a few
markers. King's record in the
spring event will hp endangered by
Van Osdel of S.C., who leaped up
(! feet 5% inches over the week
end, and Stewart .is go ml for a
place if he repeats with G feet 4
inches. Paul, Barber, and Dowell
all floated out over 24 feet into the
ozone at the IT.S.C. meet and that's
a broader jump than most. Eastern
ers can negotiate.
And a word about the stick
races. Here we have Podge
Smith battling with Welsh,
Carls, and Payne of Southern
California, and Captain Al
Pogolotti of the Bears. How's
a self-respecting Hahvad man
going to break into that bunch?
Too bad there isn't a mile re
lay; perhaps the Cards could
place in that too?

When college trncksters from nil
