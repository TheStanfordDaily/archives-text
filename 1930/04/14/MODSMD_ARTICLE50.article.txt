# Cardinal Nine Drops Close Tilt To Horner, 3-2
## BEARS WIN SERIES AS WELL AS NINTH STRAIGHT VICTORY U.C. Moundsman Gets Fifth Consecutive Triumph; Berg Hits Triple 
### Howard Moore 
Norm Horner dished up his
usual assortment of horseshoes,
wishbones, and swastikas to win
the annual serins and his fifth
straight and the Hears' ninth
straight victory over Stanford's
baseball varsity Saturday after
noon on Southwest Field, Berkeley,
by a score of :! to 2. Conceding a
real honest triumph of 7 to 2, won
by the little Culifornian last year,
Saturday's tilt makes the fourth
hair-breadth wheeze that the Cards'
Nemesis lias slipped over.
In all fairness, however, the Blue
and Cold ball-t.ossers played good
ball and fairly earned the victory,
but it cannot be denied that the
Berkeley team received a large
share of the breaks. Ilanl hit halls
had an uncanny way of bouncing
jusi right and once when a Card
runner was on third, Swenson
throw wild to Williams, but "the
ball bounced three times perfectly
and landed squarely into the first
, sacker's mitt.
Cards Score First
Stanford drew first blood in the
fourth canto, when Cook walked,
stole second, and tallied on Hun
ken's single over third. The Beat's
retaliated with a pair of markers
in the fifth, and the Cards were
lucky to escape with only two.
Swenson singled with one away,
took si cond ou a wild pitch, and
scored , on Horner's bingle over
first base. Kirwin doubled down
third, scoring Horner. Williams
was out bunting a third strike, and
Butler walked. Both advanced on
Hardy's wild peg to Cook, and Bur
get t was purposely walked to till
the bags, but Glaister popped out
to end the inning.
The Cards evened the count in
the seventh, Hardy getting, a one
bagger and crossing the plate on
Berg's triple to right, but Califor
nia made the winning run in their
half of the inning when Kirwin was
| hit by Caddell and scored on But
]< r's safe 4 blow to center.
All the moundsmen turned in
creditable performances, Horner
in particular pitching with his cus
tomary coolness, allowing only six
scattered hits and one free ticket.
Perhaps the best individual play
of the game was Hunken's spec
tacular catch of Smith's long drive
to left field in the sixth inning.
