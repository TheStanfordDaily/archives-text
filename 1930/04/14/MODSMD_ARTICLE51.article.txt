# BALANCING THE GOB'S ACCOUNT
## Sharkey to Represent U.S. in International Combat with Million Dollar Title at Stake 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Jack Sharkey, the naturalized |
Lithuanian, being a very patriotic!
young man, and quite willing to
fight Germans in peace or war,
should be at his very best against
Max Sclnneling when they meet ;it
the Yankee Stadium in July. He
should be, you understand, but
there are a lot of reasons why he
probably won't be. lie's that kind
of fighter. You never can figure
him out.
But, as I said, being patriotic
aird quite willing to represent the
U.S. in an international combat, 1
with a title worth a 1
couple of million dollars at stake,
he should not object to us doing a
little mental arithmetic over his I
record, listing the plus and minus;
achievements which we find there,
always rAnembering that there is
a IKS. in plus ami another one in
minus!
The in and out qualities of the
Boston Gob are well known to all

I followers of things Untie. He looks
like ;i million dollars one fight, find
terrible in (he next. Lucky for
liim that in his last brawl lie
looked pretty punk, for now it. is
lis iurn to put. on a classy exhibi
tion. You'd think, wouldn't you,
with the long sought after heavy
weight championship within his
grasp, and being chosen as the best
heavyweight in these United States
1o represent it against the best
heavyweight in Europe, that Shar
key would turn in an inspired fight?
Sure you would, but look what be
â– did against lli'sko and Heeney in
1 192S when a clean-cut victory
against; them would have assured
him a title bout with Gene Tunney!
Then there's this little matter of
idleness. Schmeling has been idle
since he beat Paulino last June.
lllit Maxie lias fought .'!5 rounds
since a year ago last January to
Jack's 2i;. So you see, they've both
been idle. Now which one is going
! to become the Idol?
