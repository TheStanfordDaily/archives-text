The Stanford freshman track

"Little-Big Meet" with the Califor
nia freshmen, victor by 07% points
to 63%.
As was expected the Cardinal
yearlings scored heavily in the
! field, running up 36% points to
: 17% for California in these events,
j but they failed to hold their own
;on the track and were outscored

; from the first event right up until
the last, the discus, with Here La
i horde and Nellie Gray, took the
first and second places necessary
| to win the meet.
Frank Lucas of California won
the mile as expected. His time of
4:33.C was excellent considering

j behind Klippell of California.
