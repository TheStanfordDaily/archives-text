# U.C. CUBS LOSE TO CARD FROSH IN MEET, 67-63
## Eastman, Van Tress, And Kearney Make New Meet Records Cardinals Score in Field Events, Lose Track 
### Bill French 
The Stanford freshman track
team, favored to win by 15 points,
was glad to settle for a lour-point
margin and came out of the annual
"Little-Big Meet" with the Califor
nia freshmen, victor by 07% points
to 63%.
As was expected the Cardinal
yearlings scored heavily in the
! field, running up 36% points to
: 17% for California in these events,
j but they failed to hold their own
;on the track and were outscored
: 4(> U> 32 there. Stanford was behind
; from the first event right up until
the last, the discus, with Here La
i horde and Nellie Gray, took the
first and second places necessary
| to win the meet.
Frank Lucas of California won
the mile as expected. His time of
4:33.C was excellent considering
I that no other runner was within
! 100 yards of him. Bob Hunter, who
i was figured to take second, was
| lucky to set third. He was well
j behind Klippell of California.
Bears Win Hundred
The hundred was run true to
j form. Bell of the Bears won by
j inches from his teammate, Robos-
I son in 10 3-10 seconds. Jack
Twelvetrees was third. Captain
I Ben Eastman sped to an easy vic
tory in the quartermile. His time
i of 40 2-5 seconds lowered the pre
! vious meet record one second. Al
-1 hers and Neuhaus of California
| tied for second in the 410, shutting
I Rogers and Murray out of some ex
j petted points.
j Stanford made a clean sweep in
I tiie highs. Bert Foldt pulled soine
| what of a surprise in finishing
j ahead of Alden Herbert. Plumb
| took the third and the time was
| 16.7 seconds. Naylon, Mires, and
i Fullenwider finished the half-mile
i in that order, making it another
i sweep for the Cards. The time was
] 2:0o.
Lucas came back in the two-mile
'to win his second race. He took it
easy knd did not open up until the
| lasi lap. His time was 10:40.5. Sin-
I dell and Denhardt, also of Cal
ifornia, took second and third. Jack
Twelvetrees led most of the way
in the two-twenty, but in the last
' Field events went about as ex
peeled, with the Cards cleaning up
in the shot and the discus,, but
being heavily outscored in the re
maining events. Only two incites
separated I lie winner from third
place in the broad jump, with all
place-winners bettering 24 feet.
Berry cleared thirteen three in the
pole vault to work into a quadruple
lie with Troy's trio, llothert was j
unable to break into the Trojan
combination of Mortensen, Snider,
and Beatty in the javelin, which 1
was won at 201.a feet. Van Osdel
cleared six feet five and five-eighths
inches to take the high jump with '
Stewart in second at six feet four. \
Madison and Allan of Stanford tied
with Norcross for third place.
Sensational efforts of the Card- i
inal baton passing quartet, Shove,
Howell, Hables, and Morrison, pro- i
duced tite new world's record. |
Shove and Burke raced neck and j
neck to the end of the first lap. ,
Howell ran under fifty flat, but lost j
several yards to Woessner, Hables
did the best quarter of his career I
lo catch Pearson, and Morrison, \
starting on even terms with VVil- J
liams, passed his opponent on the j
final surve lo win by six yards.

The Stanford freshman track
team, favored to win by 15 points,
was glad to settle for a lour-point
margin and came out of the annual
"Little-Big Meet" with the Califor
nia freshmen, victor by 07% points
to 63%.
As was expected the Cardinal
yearlings scored heavily in the
! field, running up 36% points to
: 17% for California in these events,
j but they failed to hold their own
;on the track and were outscored
: 4(> U> 32 there. Stanford was behind
; from the first event right up until
the last, the discus, with Here La
i horde and Nellie Gray, took the
first and second places necessary
| to win the meet.
Frank Lucas of California won
the mile as expected. His time of
4:33.C was excellent considering
I that no other runner was within
! 100 yards of him. Bob Hunter, who
i was figured to take second, was
| lucky to set third. He was well
j behind Klippell of California.
Bears Win Hundred
The hundred was run true to
j form. Bell of the Bears won by
j inches from his teammate, Robos-
I son in 10 3-10 seconds. Jack
Twelvetrees was third. Captain

i in that order, making it another
i sweep for the Cards. The time was

Lucas came back in the two-mile
'to win his second race. He took it
easy knd did not open up until the

I dell and Denhardt, also of Cal
ifornia, took second and third. Jack
Twelvetrees led most of the way
in the two-twenty, but in the last
' Field events went about as ex
peeled, with the Cards cleaning up
in the shot and the discus,, but
being heavily outscored in the re
maining events. Only two incites
separated I lie winner from third
place in the broad jump, with all
place-winners bettering 24 feet.
Berry cleared thirteen three in the
pole vault to work into a quadruple
lie with Troy's trio, llothert was j
unable to break into the Trojan
combination of Mortensen, Snider,

was won at 201.a feet. Van Osdel
cleared six feet five and five-eighths
inches to take the high jump with '
Stewart in second at six feet four. \
