# KELLOGG PROGRAM PLEASES AUDIENCE IN PAVILION FRIDAY
## 
### 
Although Charles Kellogg por-
I formed â€¢ marvelous feats with his
j bird-voice, it was his personal
charm and the experiences he told
! that fascinated a small audience of
j children and adults last Friday
i night at the Pavilion.
Among the rare and varied ex
periences he recalled were those
among the Digger Indians, who
used "radio" communication by
i means of drumming on hollow
I trees tuned to other distant trees.
lie also demonstrated the primitive
! "radios" made of gourds and conch
| shells. It is Mr. Kellogg's opinion
Ithat there are more things under
j stood by the animal and the primi
tive than can he explained by mod-
I ern science. He explains this on
! the basis of tuned vibrations.
This same explanation makes
| possible the mysterious fire-walk
j ing of the natives whom he watched
marching slowly over white-hot
stones in the Fiji Islands, he be
lieves, and il is this fearless har
mony which protects liirn from the
ra 11 lesnake.
The nature-singer was introduced
by Hugh Uarrett Dobbs, captain of
'the "Ship of Joy" and friend of
j radio fans who tune in on the
I llappytime hour over KPO.
"Dobbsy" was enthusiastically
[greeted by the audience to whom
! lie was presented by M. A. Harris
i of Atherton, who arranged the pro
gram.
