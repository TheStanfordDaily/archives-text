### 
IfARROGATIC, Teiui., April 1-1
(/P). â€”With Clay McCarroll, student
body president, already under $1,500
bond on rioting charges, injunction
proceedings were in prospcct today in
an effort to restrain two dismissed pro
fessors and McCarroll from "interfer
ing further" in agitating a strike of
boys and girls attending Lincoln Me
morial University.
The student strike followed de
mands fur a reorganization of the
university and an investigation to de
termine why the institution is not ac
credited by southern and national edu
cational bodies.
J. R. Ketroti, university trustee, said
he would request the injunction against
Professors M. (i. Miller and K. V. N.
Oilier and McCarroll in the Tazewell,
Tcnn., courts. Jle also said lie would
institute court action to evict the two
professors from campus houses.
Possible suspension of students who
persist in remaining out of classes has
been discussed by Judge J. H. S. Mor
isoti, acting president. Leaders claim
a majority of the 400 students arc
supporting the strike, but their state-
J incuts have been disputed by authori-
I ties.
