# U.C. PROFESSOR SAYS NEW FIND IS NOT PLANET
## Astronomer Believes Body To Be Either Comet Or Asteroid Lowell Object Has Strange Orbit—Leuschner 
### 
BERKELEY, Cal., April 14 (/P).—
Contradicting astronomers of Lowell
Observatory that a new planet had
been discovered, Professor A. O.
Leusclmer, director of the Students'
Observatory, University of California,
yesterday said it was not a planet, but
may be an asteroid or a comet, travel
ing in a cigar-shaped orbit.
Basing his belief 011 data from Low
ell and Swarthmorc observatories,
Professor Leusclmer said, in part:
"The object discovered, instead of
being Planet 'X,' as at first thought,
may be a large asteroid lately dis
turbed in its orbit by close approach to
major planets, such as Jupiter; or it
may be one of the many long-period
planetary objects yet to be discovered,
or it is believed it may be a comet.
"Even though the Lowell discovery
is not Planet 'X,' it still is of great
significance because it extends the lim
its of the solar system. At its great
est distance the. object is some 40,000,-
000,000 miles from the sun, if the
Swarthmorc computations arc correct.
No other planetary bodies except com
ets arc known to reach such distances.
"If not a comet, the Lowell object
would be the first planetary object to
have such a highly eccentric orbit. Jt
will require observation over a number
of years and a very accurate orbit to
enable observers to find it again when
it returns after several centuries. At
the present time the object is receding
from the sun and will gradually di
minish in brightness beyond the power
of the largest telescopes."
