# ORDERS FOR SENIOR PROGRAMS DUE AT BOOKSTORE FRIDAY
## 
### 
Orders for Senior programs and
announcements must be placed at
the Stanford Bookstore before Fri
day, April IX, according to Merle
Kinry, chairman of the Program
Committee. Programs will cost one
dollar, and a time limit for order
ing has been set, since the orders
are filled in the Kast and sufficient
time for their shipment must be
allowed.
Sample covers of black leather
are on display at the Bookstore
now. The program will contain a
schedule of the events of Senior
Week, and is dedicated to David
Starr Jordan, whose autographed
portrait will appear in the book.
Announcements will probably
cost ten cents apiece.
