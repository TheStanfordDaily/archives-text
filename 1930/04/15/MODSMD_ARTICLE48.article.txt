THE HIDDEN CITY. By Phillip
Gibbs. New York: Doubleciay
Dorari. 1930.
Host-war London John Jevons
found hr be strewn Willi the l;n-«*r
!il«'d souls of those struggling in
the joyless ronl'nsioii. There was a
young movie actor who had at
tempted suicide, a hored matron of
tin* notiveau riche taking drugs to
on lin her harassed nerves, a inor
hid, disconsolate playwright, among
the inhabitants of this city of itn
healthy minds. Seldom did the doc
lor administer more than etindy
pills. A confidential attitude was
his thermometer; sincere philan
thropy replaced the professional
sang I'roid; reassurance and en
conrageinent were his medicine's.
IVlaladjustmenl of young and old,
resulting from war conditions, is
the loom on which Ili«* course of
I lie lives of John and his sister
are woven. The sister falls in
love willi tlio handsome actor, al
though he is several years her
junior, while the sympathetic doc
tor fails to maintain his disinter
estetl interest and grows lo love
Cynthia lOytle. Now as the end ap
proaches Komeo is given almost
unbelievable promotions and the
lovely Cynthia leaves a bridegroom
in I lie lurch when In we learn
that these two were made for one
another so leaving lite Jevons to
continue their work ittilluinUetl and
unaided. •
