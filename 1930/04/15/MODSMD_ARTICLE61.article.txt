However, Stanford enthusiasts
who become unduly depressed wn
rfn.oltectiny the final score of the
Trojan meet can find a world of
consolation in individual efforts of
jl number of Templeton's leading
i.mderpath artists.
Most outstanding, front any point
ill' view, wsis the record-breaking
relay. Proper iippreciation of tin*
peed with which tlie Cardinal
baton passers circled the oval can
be gained only when ii is realized
I bat the average time for each of
He- Stanford quarter niilers was
"ts.hii seconds.
Unfortunately, no official times
were kept for each lap of the re
lay. Unofficial times, gathered from
several sources, were caught as
follows: Shove, 49 flat; Howell,
•>U 2-5; Hables 48 2-5; and Morrison
47 2-5.
Much credit for the new record
is due to "Ike" 'Hables. who, alter
taking a good third in the -I HI yard
dash, ran a I'llll second faster in
Hit' relay than ever before in his
life iu make up eight yards on I'ear
on, a fair quarter miler himself,
and start Johnny Morrison oil with
a meagre I wo-yards sepa rat ing liini
l rum Vic Williams, (lie Trojan
anchor man.
Additional glory was gained by
Hec Dyer, whose 9 3-5 victory in
the one-hundred-yard dash and
2\ 2-5 tie with Wykoff in the fur
long stamp him as not only the
greatest sprinter ever to compete
for Stanford but as one of the lead
ing dash men of the world. Dyer,
after getting off to a perfect start
in the century, was almost caught
by Wykoff at the seventy-yard line
but spurted ahead to win by a good
Iwo yards.
"Red" Horry, Templeton's hard
working pole vaiilter, (•nine through
in line fashion In tie with Hubbard,
Livingston, and Clilenlzos sit 1•'
feet inches. In attaining this
height Horry cleared three inches
higher than he has ever accom
plished before and a good nine
inches above the height at which
he has iu the past been consistent.
Results of the broad jump filled
with disgust Virg Dowell, whose
24 feet 1 3 a inches leap gained him
only a third place. One of DowelPs
jumps carried him beyond the 24
tret 5 inch mark but he fouled by
less than an inch, and the distance
was not allowed. All of Virg's leaps
were close to 24 feet or better,
while Paul and Barber, who jumped
24 feet 3 w z inches and 24 feet -&
inches respectively, bettered 23
feet 5 inches on only one of. their
attempts. J
Herman Hrix, giant L.A.AC
weight man, who entered the shot
piii unattached in the hope of in
• -reusing his •"»- foot I inch record
made last week, had an oil day and
failed to toss the iron ball beyond
ihe f>(i loot murk.
More than one hundred Stanford
indents appeared in lhe grand
,< land at I'alterson Field to cheer
the-Cardinal athletes. The Hunt
ingtou, headquarters for Temple
ton's track and field leant, proved
111e Mecca for Stanford alumni on
the morning of the meet. Itoss
\i* hols, track captain in I!• Hi>. and
"Hud" Spencer, who captained Hie
i iDlinal squad in IH2S were among
past Stanford track and Held stars
