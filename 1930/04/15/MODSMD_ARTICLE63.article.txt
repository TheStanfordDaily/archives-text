# Cards Heavy Track Favorites Over U.C.
## TEMPLETON MEN, CALIFORNIA WEAK IN SAME ENTRIES Pogolotti, Smith in Sticks, Parker and Mossman, Two Mile, Close 
### 
Not in the least discouraged by
the severe defeat suffered ill the
bauds id' I'.S.C., Coach "Dink"
Templet oil's track and field squad
is spending this week preparing a
warm reception for the California
team at the annual Hig Meet to be
held in the Stanford Stadium Sat
urday afternoon. Seeking revenge
in Ihe clash with wearers of the
Mine and Hold is somewhat in the
class of despoiling an infant of its
guniilrops, for early season hopes
of California supporters for a glori
ous track season have been, haillv
da in pencil by results of meets to
dale.
Comparative scores give Stan
lord a heavy margin. Considering
the results of dual meets with
I'.S.C. wherein the Trojans
trounced Wall Christies hopefuls
to the tunc of I«lf. lit; as. against
their SI 17 defeat of Templeton's
men, Stanford should win by some
•Hi points. It is, however, highly
possible that the Ueilshirls may
take the measure of their Cali
fornia opponents by an even great
er score t lian Kfi-45.
Weak in Same Events
A glance sit | lie situation makes
this consideration clear. Stanford
Weaknesses, exposed by Cromwell's
Trojans, are in about the same
events' as California's unprotected
spots, with the important differ
ence that the California prospects
are much more feeble.
For example, take a look sit the
half-mile, low hurdles, broad jump,
and pole vault, events in which
Southern California scored 32% of
a total of ::ti points. Against Ilie
Hears Stanford should sweep the
broad jump, place first and tie for
second in the bamboo event, lake
sit least second and 4 third in the
barrier race and take two of three
places in the 880.
In addition to the broad jump,
the Cards are almost certain to
place one, two, three in the 440
and discus, with a good chance of
also sweeping the shot put and high
jump. Only in the javelin does
California appear to have a eliatide
lo collect the full nine points.
Christie Lacks Reserves
Lack of supporting material is
the chief handicap of Coach Wal
ter Christie. Mossman, /oilman,
I'ogololti, and either Curtice or
Churchill should capture firsts, in
the mile and javelin, and are quite
likeh to take the SMI, 2mile, and
one or both of the hurdle races,
hut California men capable of plat
ing second to any of these are
hard to linil except among the
spear-tossers.
