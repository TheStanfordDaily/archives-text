# WINNING WESLEY...
## Cleveland's Prodigy Is Primed for a Big Season With The Indians, Profiting by His Hard Bumps of 1929 
### Feg Murray, '16 
The greatest pitching find of l!»2!i
was young Wesley Ferrell of the
Cleveland Indians. In 192 She was
just another pitcher with Torre
Haute of the "Three-Rye" league,
now he's known as a star with a
first division club, and seems to
have the brightest future of any
young lnirler in the majors.
Lsist season the phenomenal Fer
rell won more than twenty games,
and more than twice as many
games sis be lost, having a better
won and lost percentage than such
famous hurlers as Swede Walberg,
Firpo Marberry, (Jeorge Pipgrass,
10(1 Morris, George Utile, Waile
lloyt, iiud many others. He learned
ja lot in his first major league sea
son. and should ho ;i much-im
proved pitcher in 1 H.'IO. Last spring
he reported as a rookie with blind
ing speed, but nothing else, and,
after getting away with a couple of
mop-up games, was permitted to
start, won his contest, and. so the
hovs ssi.v, got an enlarged cranium
over his success. Veteran Ameri
can League batters began to study

'his stuff, and before long lie real
ized that pitching In the majors
wasn't such a cinch after all. After
some hard bumps lie began to
listen to advice from the coaches,
and set about to learn a change
of pace.
Hv July Ferrell was the Ace of
jtlie Indians, and is the man gen
erally given credit for landing
Cleveland in third place. (Hut don't
forget certain gentlemen named
Fonseea, Averill, Sowell, etc., also.)
Soon after Christmas Wes and his
brother Kick, who is a catcher for
the Hrowns, and a third brother,
who plays in the outfield for Mem
phis, got busy in the backyard of
their home in Gilford. North Caro
lina. Wes wasn't satisfied with his
slow ball and worked hard and
faithfully with his brothers to per
j feci it. Now, according to reports
from New Orleans, Ferrell is there
like a million dollars, so keep your
eyo on the Indians this season!
