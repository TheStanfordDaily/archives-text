I Although the Cards have lost
two games and the annual series ;
| to both California and the Trojans,
Coach Hairy Wolter's men are j
) pointed for both frays and are d«
termined to upset.. the dope bucket
and scramble the Conference stand
ings as much as possible,, Stanford
has no chance of winning the title,
bill ran do much to put either the
Bears or Troy out of the running
or send the two nines into a lie for
the championship.
Sam Harry's Southerners have
lost but one game so far, while
Clint Evans' Berkeleyit es have
dropped two, but the Hears have
I but two games to play, while the
| Trojans have ten uncompleted con
gests on their schedule. The two
, games will be hard, but playing on
their own grounds, the Cardinals!
should have a slight edge in both
, of t hem.
The Blue and Cold sluggers have
been lucky to wheeze through the
! last nine (ills aguinsl Waller's eo
i liorts and arc long overdue for a
tumble. Horner lias hoodooed (lie
i Cards for five straight games, hut
! four of Mis victories have been slim
I —very slim.
{ Troy has Iwo clean cut triumphs

i S-l gallics, hut both lilts were
i played under a blistering sun and
I under the eyes of rabid fans, fans
I that rival the crows that, turn out
