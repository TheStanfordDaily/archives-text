# WARNER INTRODUCES FORMATION "C" IN PRACTICE; OVER 100 OUT
## 
### 
With more than inn men report
inn on the varsity Held three times
:i week, spring football practice is
well under way. Cavorting on I lie
field llllder I he tutelage of Coach
"Pop" Warner ami his corps of sis
Hista 111s sire the makings of what
may well be the greatest Stanford
footliaJl eleven ever to trot onto
a gridiron.
While not abandoning the old
reliable "A" formation, Warner is
at present stressing what he terms
the "balanced line" > formation, a
lineup somewhat similar to Inst
fail's formation "H." In the "bal
anced line" formation there are
always three men on either side of
the center with the ends playing
out a yard or two from tackle. The
gaps between end and tackle are
filled by the halfbacks, who play
fairly close into the lino.
Adapted to Passing
This lineup, designated to be
used against a six-man line de
fense which has its "roving" con
tor playing on defense as part of
the backfield, can be used effective
lv enough against the conventional
seven-man line. In the present era
of numerous :ind fancy pass plays,
however, the six man defense is
being used by the majority of col
lege elevens, and it is against that
sort of lineup that the "balanced
line" formation is • particularly
adapted.
With those r< nisiining from this
year's varsity strengthened by ad
ditions from the I!i2!i Grsiy squad
and last fall's freshman eleven,
Warner linds himself provided with
a wealth of material with which to
build the groundwork of the 1!)!!(!
squad. Al this early date no selec
tions c;in he made, and the only
men almost certain to hold their
places on the lirsl-slling eleven
are Captain Kay Tandy at right
tackle, and I'hil MolTatt. fleet half

Stanford football suit exists at

by knee injuries sustained i• i early
season frames insl year. Sinikins

upon Ills injured knee.
Coinpetiiion i'or the vacant tackle
berth is particularly fierce. Dick
Hogue, who held down the position
last fall, will have u fight on his
hands to keep out id' the lineup one
"Red" Hand, husky tackle from
Sacramento Junior College. In ad

While not abandoning the old
reliable "A" formation, Warner is
at present stressing what he terms
the "balanced line" > formation, a
lineup somewhat similar to Inst
fail's formation "H." In the "bal
anced line" formation there are
always three men on either side of
the center with the ends playing
out a yard or two from tackle. The
gaps between end and tackle are
filled by the halfbacks, who play
fairly close into the lino.
Adapted to Passing
This lineup, designated to be
used against a six-man line de
fense which has its "roving" con
tor playing on defense as part of
the backfield, can be used effective
lv enough against the conventional
seven-man line. In the present era
of numerous :ind fancy pass plays,
however, the six man defense is
being used by the majority of col
lege elevens, and it is against that
sort of lineup that the "balanced
line" formation is • particularly
adapted.
With those r< nisiining from this
