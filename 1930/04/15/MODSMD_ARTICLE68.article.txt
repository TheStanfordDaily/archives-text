# TENTATIVE TENNIS PLANS MADE FOR INTERCLASS MEET
## 
### 
Representatives of the freshman,
sophomore, and junior classes
niacin tentative plans for the inter
class tennis tournament at a meet
ing in the Encina Gym yesterday
afternoon. Men to be selected for
the class teams were discussed and
eligibility rules announced. All men
registered in the University are
eligible to play for their respec
tive classes provided they will not
compete in the California freshman
or varsity matches this year.
No decision was made on the
number of matches to be played in
each encounter, since it was
thought that classes with one out
standing star would have an ad
vantage in a five-match meet, while
a seven-match system would make
it difficult to play off the tourna
ment in time. Owing to the ab
sence of the senior representative
it was decided not to take a vote
until later.
From advance appearances the
sophomores and seniors have a de
cided edge on the other two classes
in the way of material. Keith Gled
hill, national junior champion, will
probably compete for the sopho
mores and is almost certain to win
any matches in which he plays.
The seniors have no conspicuous
star but boast several strong play
ers from the varsity squad.
