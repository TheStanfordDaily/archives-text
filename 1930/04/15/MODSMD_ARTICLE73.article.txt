# U.S.C. RAZZED BY STANFORD MAN; COLORS SIGNIFY TOMATO OMELET '
## 
### BY DICK FRIENDLICH 
That august institution, the Uni
versity of Southern California, is
the object of some plain and fancy
"ribbing" in an article which ap
peared in the April issue of Game
| and Gossip, a Los Angeles publica-
I tion dealing with West Coast sport
ing activities. The article, entitled,
"What I think of U.5.C.," and
signed, "A Stanford Man," sardon
ically delineates the Methodist
stronghold, exactly as every Stan
i ford man hopes it really is, and
with sufficient basic truths to make
any Trojan stand off and take; a
good look at himself and his Alma
Mater.
Nothing that is Southern Cali
fornian escapes the biting wit of
the author, from the Trojan colors
of red and gold, which "represent
a tomato omelet —or maybe the to
! ma to omelet represents the Trojan
i colors," to those patterns of sophis
| tication, the average U.S.C. men,
i whom the writer disposes of by the
! withering assertion that they "hori-
I estly dress worse than Cal men."
From the U.S.C. band —"nothing
1 like it since th 6 Boston Mas
j sacre— —" the anonymous satirist
j hops blithely to the student publi
cation, the Daily Trojan, which
'"embodies all the elements of Col
j lege Humor, the Chamber of Com
jmerce Bulletin, Film Fun, the
I American Weekly, and the Peoria
I Publicizer. The staff masthead
I reads like a New York directory.
' They have a Telephone-Answering
Editor, a Wastebasket Editor, a
Tradition-Enforcing Editor, to say

I nothing of the Chief-Editor, or the I
Supreme-Chief-Editor."
"U.S.C. men razz the Stanford !
men behind their hacks and how j
to them in their presence . . . Stan
lord men razz the U.S.C. men all
the time. ..."
Then there is some interesting j
physiological data anent the Tro-1
jan co-ed. "Figuratively, they ex-1
'cell. . . . But I'll wager iron that |
if you put a stethoscope to the head !
of the average co-ed, you'd hear
the sound of a sea-shell."
And lastly the curriculum gets
1 a few digs in the ribs, not unde
servedly. "One of the popular |
courses is called 'Orientation' con-1
sisting of instructions to freshmen j
—what to expect from college, how
to use the library, how to do root
ing section stunts, etc. ... A few i
excerpts from the official catalogue
follow:
'Philosophy 150 —Problem of Evil
in Literature ■
'Physical Education 11>—First'
Aid. Emergency treatment
for fainting, shocks, wounds,
hemorrhages and poisons.
'Physical Education 1)7 —Advanced
Folk Dancing.'"
i Head it if you can. It will warm j
| your blood, as it must have warmed j
! the blood of U.S.C. men, but in a I
(slightly different fashion.
