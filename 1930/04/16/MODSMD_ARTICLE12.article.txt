# CONTRASTS FEATURE OF "IDEA" SETS
## English Country Manor, Italian Villa To Be Scenes of Action 
### 
Laid in (wo contrasting Euro
j pean settings, Noel Coward's com-|
edy, "Tim Young Idea," will be pre- i
1 rented here Saturday in the Assem
| bly Hall.
j The two sets, designed by Fred- i
| erick Stover, technical director ol'
i dramatics, represent the entrance
hall to an English country manor,
! and the living room of an Italian ;
! villa on the Riviera. The contrast !
iof the two scenes is brought out i
in the action of the play as well
| as the color and nature of the two
settings. They are being built by
the student class in theatre work- i
shop.
The time of the play is modern, ;
j with the first two acts nl the coun- ;
I try manor of George Brent, played ;
j by Douglas Gregg, during the fox- ]
j hunting season in England. Brent's
j relations with his second wife are j
I severely disrupted by the presence
! of iiis two children who come to:
! live with him after a separation of
! many years. Dorothy Tully plays
j Cicely, the second wife, and Patty
I Edwards and Ruhland Isaly char-
I acterize Gerda and Sholto, Brent's
! children.
"The Young Idea" is one of Cow-'
: ard's most brilliant works and is i
j typically English, containing hu
! mor and burlesque as well as com
! plicating and amusing comedy situ-
I ations. A steady fire of action main-
J tains a high plane of dramatic ten
; sion throughout tlie play.
Other members of the cast are j
| Emeline Nollen, Marjorie Robinson,
' Betty Davidson, Margery Thomas, j
■ Gaillard Fryer, Edwin Gerhardt,
i Hubert. Chain, Ray Lindman, Cath
j erine Musante, and Robert Nichols. |
! The play is directed by Harold Hel- |
■ venston, and will be the only dra-
I matic event this quarter other than
i the Junior' Opera. J
