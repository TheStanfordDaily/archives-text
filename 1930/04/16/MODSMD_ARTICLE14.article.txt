# G.O.P. LEADERS RESENT HOOVER LEAGUE STAND
## President Makes Plea For World Court in D.A.R. Capital Address Senate Dislikes Agitation Created on Issue 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 15 (/P). -
1 President lloover's plea for Ihe
! League Court in an address to the
j Daughters of the American Revolu
tion was characterized by Senate ad
ministration leaders today as a "trial
| balloon which did not rise from the
i ground."
There was deep resentment among
I tlx- stalwart Republicans in the Senate
i that the President should have chosen
i what they regard as an inopportune
time to drag the League Court from
j the limbo of discredited issues.
The defeat of Senator Dcneen of
; Illinois in (lie Republican senatorial
i primary by Mrs. Ruth 1 lamia McCor
miek on the League Court issue is too
fresh in the minds of Republican lead
ers to have that issue injected into
other campaigns.
In fact, Republican leaders want to
i avoid the League Court issue in the
: campaigns this year. They believe that
the League Court issue is best left
alone.
This resentment on the part of Re
publican leaders must naturally be con
lined to private conversation, but it is
' none the less real and deep. They fear
, that agitation of the League Court
1 issue can only result in defeat of other
Republican candidates, just as it van
| cjuished Dcneen.
I The President's afterthought phrase
that the United States "some time"
will become a member of the League
! Court was disputd by anti-court Sena
tors. That time, they agreed, is far
, oti, despite the President's optimism.
1 Court ratification is not coming up
I at this session, and few are sanguine
; enough to predict that it will be con
sidered seriously at the session start
j i.ng next December.
