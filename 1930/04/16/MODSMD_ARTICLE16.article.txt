# WORK ON GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN NEXT SPRING
## 
### BY WILLIAM GRACE 
Work 011 t lie largest suspension
bridge in the world, the Golden
(Wile Bridge, is scheduled to star!
early next spring, and in five years'
time it is hoped thai the $,'50,000,000
toll structure will be open to traffic.
Plans for the bridge have been
sent to the War Department, at
Washington, D.C., for approval.
Present indications are that ap
proval will be granted, in which
case a bond issue is lo be voted
on in September by the counties
forming the Golden Gate Bridge
and Highway District. These coun
ties are: San Francisco, Marin,
Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino, and Del
Norte.
760 Feet Above Water
From Fort. Poinl, San Francisco,
on the Presidio grounds, the! 10-
fool roadway will reach across In
a single span lo Dime Point, Marin
county. This 4200-foot arch will
hang from three-foot steel cables
between two towers, 760 feet high.
The bridge's height of 225 feet
over the channel will easily clear
the tallest ships' masts, and alto
gether, from plaza to plaza, the
length will be 8500 feel.
The depth of the Golden Gate be
tween Fort Point and Dime Point
averages MOO feet. Because of this
fact, and because of the swift cur
rents which run through the Gate,

I Army engineers agree that demoli
j tion of the bridge in time of war
: would not impede navigation.
Sixteen holes were drilled this
! winter, some of them down to 140
feet, testing the rock for founda
tions at either end. Professor An
drew ('. Dawson, of the University
of California, reports that rock for
Hie north pier and anchorage, and
for the south pier, is very strong.
| The south anchorage is on serpen
line rock of low tensile strength,
so that the anchorage will have to
; depend on dead load.
Strauss Is Chief Engineer
Joseph 15. Strauss, graduate of
; ijhe University of Cincinnati, is
chief engineer of the new bridge.
In he tlrst developed the prin
ciple of the Strauss type of trun
nion bascule bridge, and has since
designed the. Dongvlew-Hainier
I bridge in Washington, the Inde
pendence bridge at Kansas, and
I about four hundred others. Ife is
(consulting engineer for the Arling
ton Memorial bridge across the
I Potomac, and for a new $75,000,000
'bridge in New York.
With tJie Golden Gate Bridge's
completion San Francisco will have
i the Redwood Empire in easier ac
j cess, and thousands of "north bay
boarders," who commute to the
city every day, will be saved the
I slow ferry trip to work.
