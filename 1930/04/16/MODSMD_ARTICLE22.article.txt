By Milton Silverman
S;tn Francisco and all California j
paid homage to one ol' its great
citizens, Alfred Hertz, for fifteen i
years director of the San Francisco |
Symphony Orchestra, who last j
| night retired amid the applause of j
i a grateful audience of 10,000 music J
I lovers who crowded into the Civic j
Auditorium. The throng, occupying !
every available seat, heaped upon !
the bowed shoulders of the direc* 1
tor its grateful praise.
We visited Hertz in his dressing j
I room before the concert. He was as |
| nervous and as frightened as a ;
I schoolboy on his day of graduation, j
| but when we spoke to him of his j
| appearances on the Stanford cam-l
j pus he became once again the pro
i ducer of great music. He regretted
I exceedingly that he will no longer
i be able to direct his orchestra as
;he has done in the past at the
I Founders' Day concerts.
But lie assured us that his visits j
'to Stanford will not cease. Then, i
I dropping his role as schoolboy, lie j
I walked out before the audience and !
| began (lie ceremony that each of ,
j his listeners felt was meant only
I for himself. No music of fantastic i
I ritual did lie play, but the exquisite I
j singing melody that is Brahms.
Hertz chose the symphony in C
minor and put in it a bit of the
; artistic talent that has endeared
| him to the hearts of generations of
j Stanford students. Appearing with l
| Hertz was Yfihudi Menuhin, the j
| young maestro.
