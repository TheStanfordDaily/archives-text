# A 						GAME OF TIT-TAT-TOE
## 
### 
When the inimitable W ill Rogers branded present day Ameri
rans as the best "conferences" in the world, he struck home to the
American public. Long weary delays characterize, public life, and
often times the public interest which has lagged hopefully through
months of inactivity is worn down from sheer waiting, and dies
from forlorn despair of any action.
Stanford, as one would expect from such a prominent Univer
sity, is particularly adept in this American game of "let's not de
cide now, conferences are such jolly fun." He fore any action can
be taken an idea has to wade through discussions, committee meet
ings, and arguments, ad infinitum.
The most glaring Stanford case of the American disease is the
pitiable and sad plight of the Women's Gymnasium. The ground
still lies as unbroken as it has lain these long and wearv thirty-nine
years—while Stanford has been "in conference." Kven Mother
Nature has been subjected 1o the great American business man's j
refuge.
Kor nearly a year now the plans for the new gym have been the 1
subject of round .table discussions. According to the A. W. S.
report on the Gymnasium, "meeting with Dr. Dyment, the A. W. S.
committee discussed the merits of the looker and basket systems, in
order to decide which to install . . . Letters were written to schools
using both systems." ()f course, this is only one example of what
has been going on for eleven months now.
The patience of the women is just about exhausted. When the ;
I'. A. ('. voted $225,000 to the women last June, great cheers went
ii]) from generations of Stanford women who believed that at last
there would be an edifice worthy of the name of Stanford tit
into the architectural scheme of things. The plans were to be ready i
in the early summer. Time went bv. The plans were to be ready
in the early fall, the. early part of winter quarter, and at the end of
last quarter, the I)afi.v wondered if the announcement that the
ground was to be broken on April Ist was an April Pool joke. It j
was. And not a very funny one at that.
The women want their gymnasium and they want it as soon as 1
possible. They are pretty tired of conferences and announcements.
They want a little action. The A. \Y. S. report states that the pla'ns -
are now in the hands of contractors, and after they have been ex
amined by the Comptroller, "if they are not over the amount sup
plied by the P>. A. I . it is expected that work will begin shortly
after the Ist of May."
()f course it is such nice spring weather that it must be difficult
to withstand the sirocco charms for more conferences. Pi lit the
ground still lies unbroken. And it's up to Dr. Dyment, Helen
Masters Hunting, and to Mr. Roth and the contractors to see that
ihe ground is broken.

The most glaring Stanford case of the American disease is the
pitiable and sad plight of the Women's Gymnasium. The ground
still lies as unbroken as it has lain these long and wearv thirty-nine
