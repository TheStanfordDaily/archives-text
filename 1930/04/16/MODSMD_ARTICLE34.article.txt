I Those who enjoy negro dialed

ful variation from a lime worn
I heme, will surely like "OP King j
David iin* tin* Philistine Hoys." I
i W rill en hy ltoark Bradford, who
j gave lis "Or Man Adam an' liis
j Chillun," the hook describes, in
t good old darky language, more j
! about biblical characters who
I throw oil' their traditional robes
jfind "gallivant around Homethln'
; awful."
' The stories are told by Brad
i ford's liell-raising preacher, who is
j llrm in his convicrion that David,
j Said, and all the resl were us hu
man as Old Black Joe. Big doings
i Willi (lie Philistine boys keep
ibings humming in Hie borne town.
Saul does a line job of kinging, and
then David steps up and shows
what a real man can do. And that j
girl Ruth and her impudent tongue,
"that good-looking Esther," and old j
'Queen Jezebel all come in for their!
j share in the yarn. Throughout. Ihe j
book walks the All-powerful, mun-j
aging things with His master-mind,;
| making people do just those things'
lie plans, making their lives fol-i
low just the pattern lie sets for
t hem.
"'I got. my own way er doin' •

I But de next time you goes flsliin'
; for buffalo fish, don't try to ketch !
him wid- a worm. And likewise, I
J don't try to ketch no catfish wid
I cawnmeal. A good fisherman knows j
what kind er bait to use, I don't j
keer is he fishin' for fish or is he ,
j fishin' for sinners. You got to use i
Ide right kind er bait on 'em.' "
I The drawings by A. B. Walker
i add to the gaiety of the tales and i
j the delightful characters and Brad-j
ford's manner of narration make '
! the book a happy transcription of
| Negro folklore, full of laughter, yet j

THREE AGAINST THE WORLD.
By Sheila Kaye-Smith. New
York: E. P. Dutton and Co.
1929. At the Stanford Book
store.
Ii is tragic when I lie Three are
against the world, hut in Hook Two
when the world is against the
Three it is more tragic and far
more convincing. What Willi over
drawn characters, over-long descrip
tions, many coincidences, and an
apparently mechanical plot, one
feels il is high time things should
become convincing.
Sheila Kaye-Smith seems to have
been too confident in her ability to
poriruy characters and scenes in
English country life, for there is a
feeling of having-heard-that-hefore
which simply does not appear in a
work of art. Although this genre
has been repeated often, it; can be
done yet, if adequately handled. II
is interesting lo note that this hook
appeared in England in 1914 under
the title, "The Three Furlongers."
This fact might, account for many
tilings about the book; for instance,
a different, point of view. Perhaps
I his might, also account, for the
detailed recitation of the numerous
dreams contained therein.
Tony Strife, with whom the third
Furlonger, Nigel, falls in love, is
an attractive, although somewhat
unreal, liltle person with a spotless
code of honor. When Nigel was re
turning from prison, he saved Tony
from being kidnaped—'"That, night
as she knelt, by the bed, she added
to her prayers a stiff petition that
she might 'meet Mr. Smith again.'"
Such was Tony until she grew up
and lost that charming part of her
self.
The two brothers and the sister
are very well depicted and are
quite consistent, the characters be
ing the more commendable in that
each has a quite separate individu
ality, thus making it more natural
that they should stick together.
Forgetting the unfavorable early
impressions, one remembers the
book as a beautiful picture of the
three loyal Furlongers—the Un
dauntables. It is the loyalty of these
three that, in spite of everything,
makes the book "bang together."
