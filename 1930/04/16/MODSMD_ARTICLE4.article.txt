# JAPANESE CABLE "DON'T COME" TO BASEBALL TEAM
## 
### 
The proposed baseball trip to
Japan was definitely canceled
yesterday when Manager Stan
ford Stcinbeck received a cable
gram from the athletic director
of Waseda University that the
tour was impossible. No other
reason was given; the cable
simply said, "Sorry, we cannot
have your baseball team this
year."
T he only game with a Nippon
ese team that the Cards may
play is a tentative post-season
affair here sometime in May
with the Kansai University nine.
