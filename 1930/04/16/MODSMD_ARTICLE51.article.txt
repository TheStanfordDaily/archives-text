## "TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALL PARK" 
### 
Witliou! Hi«* least exaggeration,
Stanford fans ciin liail their base
bull park as Hit* best, from both
player and spectator standpoint, ol'
any in Hit- I'acilic Coast Inicreolle
Hate Baseball Associa I ion.
Santa (Mara could have a Rood
ball Held. It would Ik* p«»mhilil<' to
remove the )> l« *a <* 11 * * t*H from center
li«ld and tin' ditch from the right
paHlui-H.
Getting rid of the prune
throwing kidfc who arc on hand
lor every diamond encounter
would be a different proposi
tion, however.
Out at West wood in Los An
gcles, tli«* Bruins hav«* the founda
tion of u line playing Held. At
present it is in the condition
Known as "half-completed."
There are no fences around the
out til-Id, and a Texas-leaguer goes
lor a four-hase clout. However the
Brains are going. I lnmigh the awk
ward process of moving, and bet
ter things should appear next sea
son.
riQvard liekl, at U.S.C., is prob
ably the worst in tl\t* league. The
city is' building up about ii every
day.
The girls' fencing team (the
same as was pictured so vivid
ly in late riewsreels)' practices
out in left field. Rather divert
ing. - '
Paralleling the left field foiil line
at 'a spot whei'e a good outfielder
oftinies snags foul halls, stands a
huge wphden building "which might
be a barn, or a stable for t he. mili
tary units.
And one more for the poor left
fielder. The Trojan track runs
diagonally across tlie'lotat a short
distance behind third base.
And Trojan trackmen are always
practicing.
Besides .-1 few It'ees, jumping and
vaulting pits, .and the ever-present
i mining track, the cenfer-fielder
has plenty pi" wide open space to
cliase fly balls.
Right field is a revelation.
Of course it's a sun field. Im
mediately behind the fielder,
Trojan heavyweights toss the
discus and iron pellets. Spears
men vie for records there.
Then, too, a visiting player may i
Jose his shoes and have to trek
hack to the hotel in his spikes. ,
Mather disconcerting.
■ . -
Now at California, they have a
new ball park. The Held is called
South Park, and it is very hard to
get in and out of this ball park.
_ :
The wily managers have but
two one-man entrances; as
suredly it cuts down on the j
help, and it's merely a matter
of hours to get to the showers
after the game.
Of course the small police force
easily handles the crowds. A player j
may have difficulty forcing his way 1
through the mobs to first or third
base, but officials can always limit
a base blow into the crowd for
two bases.
Ilillgarde field was high up on a
hilltop, hut South I'ark is far under
a mob.
No wonder that teams playing I
here function under such a great
strain. The diamond must seem
ultra large to them.
