Light workouts an* the on lor for
1 11 is week as Stanford's squad of
track and Held athletes are pre
paring to reach peak form for their
antnuil meet with California in the
Stanford Stadium this Saturday
afternoon.
Inasmuch as most of Templelon's
squad appear chiefly interested in
their prospects of toppling ihe
Trojans when the two teams meet
in the California Intercolle
giutes on May It), it is difficult to
deiermine in just what frame of
miiid the Kedshirts will take on
their ancient rivals from Berkeley.
And ;is mental attitude has a
great deal to do with actual per
formance- look what David did to
Goliath the problem of doping
place-winners resembles, more
lhull usually is the case, the game
of drawing numbers out of a hat.
Cards Sure to Win
Only one thing appears abso
lutely certain—Unit Templeton's
men will win their sixth conseciu
tive victory from the Golden Bear!
And almost equally certain is the
'prediction that Coach Walt Christ
! tie's collection of cinderpath per
formers will improve their best
| times and distances under stress
of competition with the hated! ?)
Presenting their greatest strength
on the track, the Bears should col
lect 33 of 72 points in events ex
clusive of the relay, which can well
ibe conceded to the world's cham
pion Cardinal baton-passers.
Dyer Heavy Favorite
j llec Dyer, by virtue of his de
feat of Wykoff, Troy.'s fleetest run*
ner, is practically a cinch to gather
| ten points for his alma inater.
i Fighting for second place will be
California's best bet, Wilson, who
is fairly consistent at 10 flat, Giber
j son and Howell of the Cards, and
Sparks, Bisbee, and Barlow of the
i Bears. Give Wilson second in the
century and Sparks second in the
| 220, and Stanford collects 12 points,
I California, iij.in the dashes.
Running against Morrison, Ha
j hies, and either McDermott, Shove,
or Howell in the 440, California
can present only one man, Johnson,
who lias approached 50 flat for the
j one lap event. Unless one of the
'Cardinal quarter-milers falls down
! Stanford should collect all nine
digits in this event.
880 to Zellman
In the half, Zellman, who has
I shaded 2 minutes, is favored over
'Atkinson and Cooper, the Redshirt
! entries, with Wright of the Bears
likely to collect the third position.
(Give Stanford 3, California (», in
! the 880.
"Spud" Mossman packs too much
' speed for Brown and Wright in
the mile and should take first with
out much difficulty. Novo, another j
coming Bear runner, looks good for
i second, (live Stanford 1, California
| 8,
Even should Mossman attempt
two races .John Parker, Stanford's
leading two-mile man, should break
the tape. Henderson, California's
regular eight-lap runner, should ha
figured for second ill the very like
ly event that Mossman does not
attempt an "iron man" stunt, with

! Nunes capturing third t! for Stan
i ford, 3 for California,
i Hurdles Close
] In what will probably bo the
| most spec tacular raccs of the after
! noon, Pogolotti of California will
i try to take the measure of Podge
j Smith in the hurdles. Pogolotti, by
j virtue of his record of 14.7 seconds
j in the high sticks and 24.3 in the
| lows, will enter both events as
i favorite. Smith, however, is deter
j mined to redeem bis shutout by
IT.S.C. in the low hurdles and it
seems certain that only a few
inches will separate the two rivals
as they reach the tape.
Little support has as yet been
given the Bear hurdler by his team
mates, and A 1 Nisbet of Temple
ton's squad should gather third
places in both barrier races. Allow
ing Pogolotti a possible double win
Stanford should collect 8 and Cali
fornia Ui in the two hurdle events.
Thus, at the conclusion of the
track events Stanford should lead
39 to 33. Five more points from
the relay give the Cardinals a 44
to 33 advantage.
Possible results of the field
events will b< j considered in tomor
row's article.
