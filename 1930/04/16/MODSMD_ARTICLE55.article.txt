# BILL AND MICKEY
## Walkers Are Outstanding in Every Kind of Sport; Mickey Twice Champ, Bill Star Pitcher 
### Feg Murray, '16 
There have been, and are, many
Walkers in the world's history
(not counting sleep-walkers and
jay-walkers) and the realm of
sports is full of the clan at the
present time; 1 don't mean those
birds who amble around a running
track, heel-and-toe fashion, with
elbows out and hips swinging like
a hula dancer in an earthquake,
either!
Let's see. There is Mickey
i Walker, world's middleweight
champion. Then there is Bill
Walker, left-handed pitcher of the
Giants, who was the most effective
hurler in the National League last
1 season. And George Herbert
! Walker, donor of the Walker Cup,
which is competed for by the very
'best "gentlemen amateurs" of Eng
land and America every year.
Cyril Walker, too. He won the U.S.
j open golf championship in 1924,
beating a Mr. Jones, of whom you
have heard. Not forgetting Jimmy
Walker, Mayor of New York City,
who fathered the present boxing
law in force in the Empire State,
i and gave New York a chance to
i enjoy Sunday baseball, too.

Other Walkers are Curt Walker,
an outfielder of the Reds, Frank
Walker, a former (Jitint, who \v;is
labelled baseball's champion busi
ness man because lie sold himself
to John McGriiw and pocketed the
'I purchase price, and One "Goat"
Walker, of the Montgomery ball
club of the Southeastern league,
who got into the limelight in 1927
by playing every position on the
diamond in the last game of the
season. And also Archie Walker
; who was once a lightweight con
; tender.
Mickey Walker is one of those
rare birds who outgrew one title
and won another. Now he's after
the light-heavy crown, after occupy
ing the welter and middleweight
| thrones. It doesn't seem so long
jago that lie was going to fight
i Benny Leonard. Now he's mixing
i with the Lomskis, Loughrans, and
iso forth. He'll be beating Primo
Camera next year.
i Pill Walker came to the Giants
j from Denver in 1928. Last season
he won 14 games and lost 7, holding
his opponents to an average of
3.08 earned runs per nine-inning
i game.

! Walker, donor of the Walker Cup,
which is competed for by the very
'best "gentlemen amateurs" of Eng
land and America every year.
Cyril Walker, too. He won the U.S.
j open golf championship in 1924,
beating a Mr. Jones, of whom you
have heard. Not forgetting Jimmy
Walker, Mayor of New York City,
who fathered the present boxing
law in force in the Empire State,
i and gave New York a chance to
i enjoy Sunday baseball, too.

Other Walkers are Curt Walker,
an outfielder of the Reds, Frank
Walker, a former (Jitint, who \v;is
labelled baseball's champion busi
ness man because lie sold himself
to John McGriiw and pocketed the
'I purchase price, and One "Goat"
Walker, of the Montgomery ball
club of the Southeastern league,
who got into the limelight in 1927
by playing every position on the
diamond in the last game of the
season. And also Archie Walker
; who was once a lightweight con
; tender.
Mickey Walker is one of those
rare birds who outgrew one title
and won another. Now he's after
the light-heavy crown, after occupy
ing the welter and middleweight
| thrones. It doesn't seem so long
jago that lie was going to fight
i Benny Leonard. Now he's mixing
i with the Lomskis, Loughrans, and
iso forth. He'll be beating Primo
Camera next year.
i Pill Walker came to the Giants
j from Denver in 1928. Last season
he won 14 games and lost 7, holding
his opponents to an average of
3.08 earned runs per nine-inning
i game.

There have been, and are, many
Walkers in the world's history
(not counting sleep-walkers and
jay-walkers) and the realm of
sports is full of the clan at the
present time; 1 don't mean those
birds who amble around a running
track, heel-and-toe fashion, with
elbows out and hips swinging like
a hula dancer in an earthquake,
either!
Let's see. There is Mickey
i Walker, world's middleweight
champion. Then there is Bill
Walker, left-handed pitcher of the
Giants, who was the most effective
hurler in the National League last
1 season. And George Herbert
