# TWO TOUGH TILTS SLATED FOR CARD BASEBALL VARSITY
## Ball Tossers Meet U.S.C. Squad Here Friday, U.C. Saturday 
### 
Taking the field ibis week for the
; two hardest games of the season,
! Stanford's baseball varsity is favored
Ito win both encounters, the lust on
| Friday afternoon against the I niver
; sity of Southern California ball artists,
■ and the second on the following after
i noon when the (joldeu Hears journey
'down to the Farm. Both games will
j lie the last of the respective tlirec
j game series and will wind up the
I Stanford year with the possible c.\
jception of a post season tilt sometime
in May against the Kansai I'niversit v
1•/ ' i
nine from Japan.
The Trojans have two Card scalps
to their credit, but Wolter's men re
: I use to concede that Coach Sam Barry
has the better aggregation. Although
the southern outfit grabbed both
! contests by substantial scores of K-l
and 8-0, the Rcdshirts were undoubt
! edlv handicapped by conditions at Bo
vard field when the two nines fought
j it out for the Conference lead.
As an article in an adjoining col
umn will testify, Troy's battleground
is by far the worst in the Conference
loop. Both squads were constantly
| harassed by the numerous ditches,
; barns, track pits, hurdles, and what
j hot scattered about the field as well
ias by the mental hazard of having
| Morteuson and his cohorts throwing
javelins hither and you. And undoitbt
j edlv, when a team is used to such a
! system, it will bear up better under the
(strain. Then, too, the raucous cries of
j the rabid fans were disconcerting,
I And the Cards managed to hit the
! oversized town on a particularly
! warmish day, the thermometer wilt
ing around DO.
Over at Berkeley, the loyal Bcrke-
Icyitcs have cheered on their new
"hero," Norm Horner, with great
• gusto, hut unfortunately carried out
the plan of "hating Stanford" with
equal vociferousness. The crowds also
i have persisted in drooling out as
much as six feet inside the foul line
and jibed the forlorn Kcdmen until
l said Cardinals waxed wroth, and that
only made matters worse.
i But sitting in his own dugout. Coach
Harry \\ oiler has an excellent chance
; of seeing his batsmen trim the oppo
sition. Nine straight contests have the
Bears taken, tive of them by Little
i Norm Horner, and with the lithe
right-hander pitching on Saturday, the
; Stanford pastimers are in a lighting
mood to stop the hoodoo for once and
all and apply thf well-known axe to
the jinx.
