### BY PHILIP HUMPHREYS 
Hack in tlio "go.id old days", when
Stanford was young and the students
wore plug hats and painted railway
stations, a young man from Indiana
registered in the new University.
The other day that "young man"
revisited the campus, lie is Daniel
W. Murphy, '92. one-time assistant
professor of physics and teacher of
Nay Lyman Wilhur, Herbert ( lark
Hoover, and others whose names have
since become well known.
"There was oik; house, or rather
house and store combined, in Palo Alto
when I came," Murphy said. "It was
located about where the S. P. and
University Avenue intersect. On the
Campus then were the Inner Quad
rangle, the Museum, and Kucina and
Noble Mails and the 'camp.' The
latter must he mentioned because many
noted men lived there."
Murphy came to Stanford as a
senior from the University of In
diana when Dr. David Starr Jordan

' came to I'alo lake i>\cr the |
I guiding reins of the University at the |
| request of the Stanfords. "In '92, I
there was a class of 29 graduates, in- I
; chiding two women," he said.
"When the University was opened,';
I was given the job (if furnishing the j
j faculty with provisions and groceries," ,
Murphy went "This service was
necessary, owing to the fact thai there j
] were uo stores nearby. ( onsequcntlv,
iit was necessary to make frequent j
'trips to San hraucisco to obtain sup-'
| plies."
After bis graduation, he was given j
a position in the physics department, i
i where lie remained until 191K). when !
he entered engineering work for the I
federal government. |
" The railroad station at Palo Alto I
was nothing more than an open shed in ,
the early days, and it wasn't long un- j
til it was painted red. However, there
| weren't many questions asked, and no
bod\ ever really knew who pcrptrated
j the 'outrage'."
