# 'STICKER' CUSTOM OF CARS CARRYING ALUMS CONTINUES
## 
### 
"Hello Alumni â€” Hop In!"
Once again the campus will
be deluged with the little red
and white windshield stickers,
a sli can stickers, window
stickers, and what have you.
The signs are originally in
tended for automobiles as a
courtesy to the graduates who
will he returning to the cam
pus this week-end for the
tenth annual University Day
on Saturday.
The stickers are an ancient
institution and have led-quite
a checkered career. Once
some campus wit pasted one
on a Ford, vintage unknown,
that squatted halfway up the
row with no engine, one seat,
and the tonneau half full of
spring rains. It. is said that a
sticker blew out on Lagunita
one year, and near-sighted
"grad" almost drowned.
The emblems may be had
today at the A.S.S.U. office,
the Alumni Secretary's office,
the Daily office, the Cellar,
and the Bookstore.
