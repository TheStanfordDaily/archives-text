# HEARST WITH A MUSKET
## 
### 
Despiie ilie lustiest jingo piffle of the Hearst press and other !
'100 per cent American" agencies in this country, the London Xaval !
conference has at last made definite progress.
Thinking Americans who stand for World decency and peace •
are thankful for t his progress. This is especially true of Young'!
America—the America in the colleges and universities of the conn- j
fry; the young men who will shed their blood and sacrifice their '
lives if another useless armed struggle casts its blight upon man
Kind.
Ii i> true, probably, that the agreements reached at London will !
not definitely insure international tranquility, lint these agree-j
nieuts are steps: and no matter how small, they are steps in the 1
right direction.
M -
Somehow or other it must be done.
\ow comes the World Court —another step. President IToover,
to use the words of a Washington correspondent, "has accepted the |
gauge of battle thrown down by World Court opponents .... lie'
will try to check the trend against the court."
That too, is good news to thinking Americans who stand for
world decency and peace. The World Court, like the London par- j
ley. may not definitely insure the peace of nations, but ii also will !
be a move toward the finish of useless slaughter and inhuman j
cruelty.
I hit before the Cnited States enters the court, proponents of ■
ihe issue will be forced to wade through the welter of rotten jingo- j
ism loosed on the London conclave by the Hearsts and iirisbanes i
and the Senate "leaders" of the nation.
I
( )nc way to shut off this onslaught would be to pass that hypo- j
fhetical law forcing the men of the nation over 40 years old to
carry tbe muskets and operate the machine guns and throw the
hand grenades in future conflicts. That would include the I learsts j
and lirisbanes and the senate, "leaders."
Such a proposition has long been considered in the limbo of !
vapid philosophy. I 'tit why should ii be? Certainlv it provides
that wars would be fought by those who want them, and not by I
those who yet have their lives to live, and want to live them away ,
from the shadow of conflict.
