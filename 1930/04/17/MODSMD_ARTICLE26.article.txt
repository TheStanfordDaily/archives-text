# STANFORD'S CHARITY

Far brick nnums the high eucalyptus trees stands lite Stanford
( onvalescent Nome. In the ten years of its existence it has come
to he a symbol of a Stanford spirit of charity. It is one of the most
effective charities in the San ITancisco Community Chest. It is a
worthy tribute to the founders of a I niversitv which has its own !
existence in the memory of a child.
Ihe ( onvalescent Home is truly Stanford's Own. It is just as j
much a part of the I niversitv as the rounded arches of the CJuad, j
or the Axe which has so recently returned to its real home. From j
a mere summer camp in the old white rambling house of the Stan- \
fords in 1920, the I lome has grown to such size that il now com |
prises four building units and cares continually for forty-five I
i hildren. There is a permanent waiting list for places. There is :
room for eightv children but inadequate funds to run at full capa- !
i ity.
I his morning's Daily reports the selection of men and women!
who will be responsible for the student drive this year. Iri a three- ;
day campaign for funds, these students will aid very materially to j
the caring of the children who grow tall and strong in the warm ;
Palo \lto sun. These students have a responsibility toward Stan j
ford in the competent discharge of their duties.
I he organization of the Drive is complete, but the responsibility
does not rest alone with the committees who will be speaking and
collecting money from the students. The responsibility lies with!
every individual Stanford student to do his share, no matter how i
small, toward supporting a charity which is an integral part of the !
I 'niversitv.
( harity drives may come and go but the one appeal which strikes i
a deep response from Stanford men and women is that of the ( on- i
valescent I lome. It is the one drive in the year which the students !
can be expected to support and to support one hundred per cent. It 1
i> one of the finest manifestations of Stanford spirit.
