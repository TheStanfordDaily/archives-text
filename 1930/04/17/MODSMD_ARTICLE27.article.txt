# THESE FOOTBALL RECEIPTS
## 
### 
Football season is not so far distant that something can not be ;
said about the sport and still be timely, especially with spring prac
tice in session. Neither is it out of season to say that match-making
graduate managers are continually on the look-out for encounters
which will bring profits. It is this watchfulness on the part of
Stanford general managers that has built up the near-to-a million
dollar fund from football receipts each year.
The desire for more money has struck the eastern universities |
and one outspoken institution comes to the fore and demands that
football schedules be so arranged as to permit the attraction of
larger crowds and consequent increase in returns.
The Harvard Crimson of that renowned Cambridge institution,
demands the rule permitting Harvard elevens to indulge in out-of
town games only once a year, be repealed. The Crimson would like
the additional pleasure of seeing the fame of Harvard gridsters
spread far and wide bv matching contests with elevens in remote and
far distant quarters of the country.
Stanford managers and those of other institutions will readily j
admit that football is "Big Business". They rightly assume so, fori
it is the receipts garnered by football that pay the expenses of other
collegiate sports.
