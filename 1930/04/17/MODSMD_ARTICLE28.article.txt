MANDARIN THEATRE, San Fran
cisco.
A real Chinese theatre, wiili
.queer Orientals .speaking in their
j own tongue, rather bewilders Ihe
•casual Saturday night playgoer.
The Sail I'Tauciscan who wanders
i in and has not Ihe good fortune to
| find beside him a friendly inlerpre
-1 ier is limited to an entirely exter
! nal appreciation of gorgeous col
j or.s, and to a fascination hy the
I human nature of the audience.
A merely-American spectator
does decidedly Imve ihat feeling
external. A foreigner in Sail I'Yaii
i cisco's Chinatown. The adorn on
'the stage do not convince; lliey
j do not seem to live. To n wholly
uninitiated critic of their drama ii
j seems almost worthless as int**r
preiive art; as though Ihe players
jare puppets, speaking in Chinese
1 squeaks, merely reminding their
deeper audience of a mythology,
an epic perhaps, which is rem em
; hereil and loved. The acting is
! crude, and its value, if any, must
he in symbolism or suggestion. The
| story does not progress noticealtfy;
| the infidel mind is templed to
doubt whether there is a story. A
radical change of characters and
scene late in the evening leaves
; one uncertain whether he wit
i nesses another act or a new play.
: Hut there is more to the play
j than the players. There in silk and
embroidery, coloring, and resplend
j enf Oriental costumes which are
i graceful and charming. The music
' is rendered informally and spas
modically hy a Chinese orchestra

(sitting cm Hie stage beside the
i actors. It has the monotony and
1 minor harmony nl' old Indinii .songs
and I lie somewhat wild, 11 ♦»«••-» ntrn I -
j li/i'd sound Hinging of bagpipes,

audience stimulates interest and

THE LIGHT CM- WESTERN
STARS—At the New Stan
ford.
"Sweet" Mars' Brian, K'ichard Ai
Icn, i*iHmi.' 11 aninuinitiop to iptell a
Haitian rehcllioii, and all the other
appurtenances of a Western movie
unites iu bringing to an end the silence
once regarded as characteristic of
< iod's great open spaces.
There were also hoof-beats, though
it did sound lor all the world as ii the
hosseij were running around on ihc !
Hoor of the- Paramount studio. They
made a sound as hollow as the vil
lain's laugh, and man ! what a villain
ready to step right back into an Old
Gold advertisement, lint believe me,
he got bis.
Miss Brian arrives from the Kast
(to take over her nmrdAed brother's
ranch, not to teach school), and if
it hadn't been for Arlen's timely ap
pearance, the villain wftuld have got
more than her ranch, but trust Xanc j
Grey to see"that all turns out well in
the end. —M. S.
