# SHELL-CASTING MACHINE OF NEW DESIGN BUILT AND TESTED IN ENGINEERING SHOP
## 
### BY WILLIAM WALLS 
| Designed to eliminate the tre
mendous expense of forging plants'
| worrh several million dollars, a
'centrifugal casting machine for the
i moulding of hollow steel shells has
been completed and partially test
ed in the mechanical engineering
i shop after two yeans of effort.
According to H. S. Taylor, in- j
j structor in mechanical engineering
j assigned to the project by Dean j
I Hoover, head of the mechanical
i engineering school, the apparatus
I will revolutionize the making of ex- !
] plosive projectiles.
"The idea of centrifugal machines
is not new, as a horizontal type is.!
now used in the manufacture of
j pipe. But the vertical set-up is
| novel since it is capable of making
hollow castings without the use of
; cores," Taylor stated.
"When a cup of coffee is stirred I
j the liquid is thrown toward the out- j

( side. This mechanism, by revolving
!at a higMi rate of speed, achieves
the same result," lie explained.
"When molten steel is run in, the
metal covers the insides and bot
toms of the mould much in the j
same form as a vase or glass. By I
controlling the speed of the motor!
I the device is capable of making j
the desired depth of inside cavity,
1 any excess metal running out the!
; top,"
All machine work has been done '
here and everything is the product j
,of University shops with tin- ex
ception of one piece too large to'
be handled with available appara
; 1 us.
The device, which is capable of 1
i handling a number of problems be
i side the one for which it is de
signed, is run by a nine-horsepower i
i motor with a speed range of from
(750 lo 1200 revolutions per minute.
