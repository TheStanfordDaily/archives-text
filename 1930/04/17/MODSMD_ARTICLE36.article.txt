# DUST FLIES ON QUAD Rubbernecks Get Treated "FEMMES" BEAT RUGS
## 
### 
Siglif -seers were given an un
usual idea of Stanford the other
day when as a large group of them
were entering the Memorial Court,
some of the feminine members of
the class in theatre workshop were
beating large rugs in the middle of
the lawn.
The rug-beaters were garbed in
various derivations of-'overalls and
quite unrecognizable through the
grime on their faces. Everything
front spring housecleaning to the
necessity of earning money for
Easter bonnets was suggested by i
the onlookers as a reason for the |
industry.
It might also be fine training for
housewives.
