# LAGUNITA RISES
## 
### 
All the gloomy weather a few
days ago only made a difference of
two inches in the level of Lagunita.
A greater rise in the level of the
lake was prevented because the
inlet was closed last quarter to pre
vent overflow, and it was not, re
opened to accommodate the recent
deluge.
