Baseball, long a waning sj>«»rt at
Stanford lias enjoyed its most suc
cessful season in years as far as in
terest from the fans are concerned.
In fact the third and final clash he
twecn the Card nine and the (ioldcii
Hears Saturday aftei'tioou bids lair to
draw the crowd rather than Temple
ton's animal monotonous crush of
» hristie's California tricksters.
More than 3,000 saw the open
ing Card-Bear clash two weeks
ayo on the Southwest diamond
in Berkeley, the largest crowd in
Coast Conference historq.
Not since the gay nineties have
cheer leaders appeared on a ball
park, nor have as many as 500
Stanford students taken the
trouble to cross the bay to see
the ancient and honorable past
time in all its glory.
Not only that hut KKk't even took
the trouble to rig up a "mike" on the
backstop screen and put the battle on
the a jr. Small lights were the order
of the day and extra police and fire
men reserves were called out to pre
vent any possible riots, Jeers, cat
calls, hoots, yells, cheers, squabbles,
and boos were heard front all sides
and members ot the teams threw in a
few arguments for good measure.
Sure, the axe was responsible
for the mob scene, but the game
was so close and so bitterly
fought that a week later, after
the axe episode had all calmed
flown, the same crowd of howl
ing maniacs were out in full
force to see an even harder
fought contest. And now the B.
A. C. has put up extra bleachers
clear out to left and right field
on the local diamond in anticipa
tion of Stanford's largest crowd
in history.
The varsity lost both encounters to
their Nemesis, Norm Horner, as you
remember, tlie gentleman that was lelt
bultliug„. the well known handle one
line Thursday ni.nht a little while back.
Ilorner took three straight last year,
has two so far this season, and Satur
day he goes into the box in hopes of
heaping,further insult upon the Cardi
nals as well as of breaking the record
of (ins Neinechvk.
The doughty Gus pitched five
consecutive games against the
Redshfrts a few years back and
won them all which, added to
Mr. Horner's string, makes a
nice total of ten —out of eleven
meetings.
The baby Cardinals will be lighting
out the third «nd deciding tilt with the
licitrs Cubs day after tomorrow over
at Berkeley. Moth the Cubs and the
yearlings have one victory, and Cudde
back's men are making the trip deter
mined to break the two year jinx on
the freshman teams.
Two years ago llornev pitched two
of the three games for the Bear Cubs
and won both and the series. Last
veur the Card babes lost a pair and the
series to Nix, the C. I . tnoundsman,
but the I'/3.? ball tossets are set to
duplicate the feat of the IWO team
and bring home the bacon for the first
lime in three years. Howard Moore.

Stanford lias enjoyed its most suc
cessful season in years as far as in
terest from the fans are concerned.
In fact the third and final clash he
twecn the Card nine and the (ioldcii
Hears Saturday aftei'tioou bids lair to
draw the crowd rather than Temple
ton's animal monotonous crush of
» hristie's California tricksters.
More than 3,000 saw the open
ing Card-Bear clash two weeks
ayo on the Southwest diamond
in Berkeley, the largest crowd in
Coast Conference historq.
Not since the gay nineties have
cheer leaders appeared on a ball
park, nor have as many as 500
Stanford students taken the
trouble to cross the bay to see
the ancient and honorable past
time in all its glory.
Not only that hut KKk't even took
the trouble to rig up a "mike" on the
backstop screen and put the battle on
the a jr. Small lights were the order
of the day and extra police and fire
men reserves were called out to pre
vent any possible riots, Jeers, cat
calls, hoots, yells, cheers, squabbles,
and boos were heard front all sides
and members ot the teams threw in a
few arguments for good measure.
Sure, the axe was responsible
for the mob scene, but the game
was so close and so bitterly
fought that a week later, after
the axe episode had all calmed
flown, the same crowd of howl
ing maniacs were out in full
force to see an even harder
fought contest. And now the B.
A. C. has put up extra bleachers
clear out to left and right field
on the local diamond in anticipa
tion of Stanford's largest crowd
in history.
The varsity lost both encounters to
their Nemesis, Norm Horner, as you
remember, tlie gentleman that was lelt
bultliug„. the well known handle one
line Thursday ni.nht a little while back.
Ilorner took three straight last year,
has two so far this season, and Satur
day he goes into the box in hopes of
heaping,further insult upon the Cardi
nals as well as of breaking the record
of (ins Neinechvk.
The doughty Gus pitched five
consecutive games against the
Redshfrts a few years back and
won them all which, added to
Mr. Horner's string, makes a
nice total of ten —out of eleven
meetings.
The baby Cardinals will be lighting
out the third «nd deciding tilt with the
licitrs Cubs day after tomorrow over
at Berkeley. Moth the Cubs and the
yearlings have one victory, and Cudde
back's men are making the trip deter
mined to break the two year jinx on
the freshman teams.
Two years ago llornev pitched two
of the three games for the Bear Cubs
and won both and the series. Last
veur the Card babes lost a pair and the
series to Nix, the C. I . tnoundsman,
