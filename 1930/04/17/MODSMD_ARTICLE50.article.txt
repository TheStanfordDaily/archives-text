# Cards Have Big Edge Over U.C. In Field Events
## BEAR'S STRENGTH REST IN JAVELINS THROWING EVENT Curtice, Churchill, Bias Are Superior to Any Stanford Tosser 
### Bob Van Etten 
Trial runs over two-thirds nor
mal distances hold lasl night indi
cated thai Stanford distance men
will be in lop condition for the
liitt Moot on Saturday afternoon.
Particularly encouraging was John
Parker's running of six hips in
7:15.2. Parker was very closely fol
lowed across the line by bis'
"shadow," Nunes,
Continuing the doping for the
Cardinal-Hear annual track and
field compel ilion, Stanford, alter
shading Christie's men on the
track, by a possible score of 41 t:o
1 .'{!», should (dean up heavily inside
the oval.
The situation in the weights
closely resembles the lineup in Ihe
Cardinal-Trojan battle, with De-
Berry, California's leading per
former in the shot and discus, en
deavoring to do as well as his
Southern California counterpart',
Hob Hall. Considering past achieve
ment!! plus the fact that Deßerry
broke a blood-vessel in his hand in
i the meet against Washington and
i may not he in the best possible
condition Saturday, it appears
highly doubtful lliai the Blue and
Gold weight ace will offer much
competition to Krenz, Rothert,
Grey, and Fleishhacker. Deßerry's
best chance to pick up a point is
in the shot-put-, where bis mark of j
47 feet six inches favors him over I
Herb Fleislihacker for third place.
; In the discus, a clean sweep looms
for the Cardinals, as Deßerrv has
never thrown further than i:!f> feet,
while Krenz, Rothert, and Grey i
should all be capable of better than
140 against the Bears. Give Stan
ford 8, Capifornia 1 in the shot,,
and Stanford !), California 0, in (lie
discus.
Bears Sweep Javelin
Stanford superiority in the
weights is matched by California
performance in the javelin. Cur
tice and Churchill, both frequently!
tossing the spear beyond the 200-
foot marker, are a cinch to place ;
one, two, while Hias, recently fam
ous as a substitute relay man, looks
good to nose out Zuger or Gold- i
smith for third place. Give Stanford
0, California it in this event.
With Bias and Lom capable of
2o feet, Stanford's broad-jumping
trio of Dowell, Butler, and West,
will "have to exert themselves if
they are to shut out the Bears.
Considering past records, however,
the Cards should perform this little
i feat and add nine more points to t
Ihe Stanford total.
A close battle looms in the high
jump. Under stress of competition
Madison and Allan cleared (i feet
1 inch against the Trojans, a height
which if repeated should win for
them in the California meet.
Jacklevitch of the Hears last year
i succeeded at this height, but lias
not bettered six feet as yet this
year. Rice, against Southern Cali
fornia, leaped r> feet 11 V& inches.
Figure Stanford for 8 points in the
high jump, California 1.

Trojan-Bear meet, but has not done
better than 12 feet (! inches since
then. DeGroot and Johns of Stan
ford are fairly consistent at 12
feet (! inches. Give Stanford <>, Cali

Bears Sweep Javelin
Stanford superiority in the
weights is matched by California
performance in the javelin. Cur
tice and Churchill, both frequently!
tossing the spear beyond the 200-
foot marker, are a cinch to place ;
one, two, while Hias, recently fam
ous as a substitute relay man, looks
good to nose out Zuger or Gold- i
smith for third place. Give Stanford
0, California it in this event.
With Bias and Lom capable of
2o feet, Stanford's broad-jumping
trio of Dowell, Butler, and West,
will "have to exert themselves if
they are to shut out the Bears.
Considering past records, however,
the Cards should perform this little
i feat and add nine more points to t
Ihe Stanford total.
A close battle looms in the high
jump. Under stress of competition
Madison and Allan cleared (i feet
1 inch against the Trojans, a height
which if repeated should win for
them in the California meet.
Jacklevitch of the Hears last year
i succeeded at this height, but lias
not bettered six feet as yet this
year. Rice, against Southern Cali
fornia, leaped r> feet 11 V& inches.
Figure Stanford for 8 points in the
high jump, California 1.

of California, cleared 13 feet in the
Trojan-Bear meet, but has not done
better than 12 feet (! inches since
then. DeGroot and Johns of Stan
ford are fairly consistent at 12
feet (! inches. Give Stanford <>, Cali
