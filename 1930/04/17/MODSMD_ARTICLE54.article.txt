# McCABE CONTINUES TO RETAIN CAMPUS TENNIS, GOLF TITLE
## 
### 
Colonel Warner MeCabe, king of
the campus cadets, may once again
boast that no student has ever
beaten him at either of his favorite
sports, tennis or golf; for the
Colonel won the third and decisive
game of his match with Bill Morf,
who challenged his boast, 5 and 4,
on the Stanford course last week
end.
li almost ' looked as though Ihe
Colonel would have to admit de
feat at Morf's hands, when the
student won the second game of
the match from him by one hole.
However, the Army held its own,
and McCabe's score* in the last
game proved-his superiority.
The Professor of Military Sci
ence and Tactics, Who is a most
familiar figure on the Stanford
links, claims that the course is the
best he has ever pla,yed, even if it
is* efiuek full of hazards.
