# COP GRIEVED OVER GIVING PAL GLOVER 'BUM DECISION' TAG
## 
### 
"I'll have to give you a bum de
cision ; but this lime I won't be
i able -lo change it," said Sergeant
j L. IT. Orieb of the Palo Alto traffic
j squad as lie presented Fred Glover,
â–  frosli featherweight boxer, with a
ticket for speeding.
Grieb and. Glover met last fall
al a Stanford boxing tournament.
Through an error by the referee
Glover almost lost a medal and a
decision for a bout which he had
really won. Grieb was acting as
judge and he corrected the error
just in time to prevent the medal
from being given to the wrong
man. Glover and the officer became
good friends.
Then last' Sunday Grieb caught
the boxer speeding and, although
'it grieved him terribly, he was
forced to effect a "pinch." Grover
paid a line of $7.50, but he and
Grieb are still "pals" in spite of it.
