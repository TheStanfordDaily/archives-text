Straight from a litinl giimo Willi
the University of California, the
Trojan nine invades the Karni to

.willi Coach Harry Welter's stal
| wails scheduled for '■'>: I■' o'clock
!on Ihe local diamond. The game
will he I lie Ihi I'd and last of Ihe
j annual series between Troy and
'the Cards, U.S.C. having already
| won the first Iwo lilts mid the
I series.
The Bears and Trojans play to
day lit Berkeley in it game that
j may decide the Conference, and
collided with playing tomorrow on
ii strange diamond, ' Sam Harry's
j men ought to conic out oil tile
short end of the score against
| Stanford, At least the Southerners
are not favorites to take the game.
Southern California has been af
flict ed nil season with a greon in
fleltl, but an excellent trio of outer
'gardeners, a fine catcher, and' a
j pair of good twirlers has put Troy
| far up in the Conference standings.
Arbelbide, Shepard, Wilcox, and
Mplildr jj 1: i y the inside positions in
the order named, while Hill, Mail
by, and Hoswell, all experienced
j men, cavort in the pastures. Cap
| tain Joe Ward will appear behind
| the hat, "While George SuUierlen
: or George Williamson, whichever
i does not pitch against California
| today, will hurl the ball for Troy
! tomorrow.
Leverenz to Pitch
Coach Wolter plans to start
> "Levy" Leverenz in the box for
Stanford with Spud Hardy on the
i receiving end. This battery suc
j ceeded in striking out fourteen men
jin the TT.C.L.A. encounter last
1 week, and if Leverenz can fool
i Barry's crew with his side-arm
outcurve tomorrow, the other
I seven Cards in the field will have
! a quiet afternoon.
Ralph Cook will assume the
I duties around first base, Max Cut
shnw will handle the keystone
sack, Perry Churchill will be in the
! hot corner, and Dvkcs Johnson will
cover the short patch. Johnny llun
ken, Rudy Rintala, and Red Berg
are slated to patrol the cornfields.
Trojan batsmen are the chief
I threat in tomorrow's encounter, all
I of the Southerners, especially big
' Garrett Arbelbide, being able to
| swnl the horseliide with gifted
i ability. Stanford men shouldn't
t have a hard time reaching the
) bags, hut poor base-running lias
j been a glaring weakness all year.
Although Southern California
won the first two tills by the ex
pansive margins of <S-1 and 8-0, the
frays were much closer than the
scores indicate. Stanford succeeded
in putting men on Ihe bases almost
every inning, once stacking the
bags with none out, but always the
J men died <>n the sacks.
