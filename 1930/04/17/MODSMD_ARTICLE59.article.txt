in the matches thai come Saturday i
morning at 10 o'clock on the Berke

drawn, il should be drawn on the!
Berkeley side of ihe net. There is

California over Ted Easton, on the i
basis of comparative scores in the i

likewise figured to cop the first |
doubles from Easton and Hall, for <

Hears these Iwo matches, tlioy need ;
only one more to win the meet j
to 2. They have little chance in the :
second doubles for the probable
combination of Ludlow-Mani's is 1101
to be rated with Weesner and Oris
coll.
Second and third remain, j
If the Cards, can take tlu'.ni both,!

takes one, they win by ; Ibe same I

There is a possibility that Harry
Plymire may supercede Captain
Larry Hall at second singles
against Bob Muench of California.
That would practically assure Hall
a win over Captain McKee of Cali
fornia in the third singles; and the
result of the matches would hinge
on Plymire's outcome with Meunch.
The Card husky has a game that j
is potentially equal to the Cali-!
fornian's, and if he is at the top of I
his form, he is capable of pulling
out the match.
