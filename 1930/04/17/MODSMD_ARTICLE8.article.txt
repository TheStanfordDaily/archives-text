# THOMPSON TO TAKE PART IN "YOUNG IDEA"
## Margery Robinson Gives Up Play Role Because Of Illness Helen Thompson Will Play Jennifer Brent 
### 
Necessitating a last-minute
change in (lie cast of "The Young
Idea," the illness of Margery Rob
inson has prevented her from play
ing Jennifer Brent, and the part
will be taken by Helen Thompson,
veteran campus actress.
Miss Thompson has appeared in
many Stanford productions, includ- i
ing "Expressing Willie," "The I
Devil in the Cheese," and the Foot
ball Gaieties of 1928 and 1929. She
is also co-author of this year's
Junior Opera, "Mardi Gras."
"The Young Idea," sparkling j
comedy by Noel Coward, will be |
presented in the Assembly Hall j
Saturday night, and is directed by |
Harold Helvenston. Jennifer is the j
first wife of George Brent and the j
plot of the comedy is laid around !
the estrangement and reconciliation !
of the couple. Brent is played by |
Douglas Gregg, whose record in I
local dramatics is long and com- !
mendable. Gerda and Sliolto, taken !
by Patty Edwards and Ruhlaiul j
Isaly, are the youthful plotters try-!
ing to restore domestic peace to j
their parents.
Fast Comedy
Mixed into the plot is a fast- '
moving theme of humor and satire
on present-day Britishers and Eng- j
lish customs. Coward's sophisti- ;
cated sense of comedy is well-ex- i
pressed in this work. Country life j
somewhere near London is de- j
picted in the first two acts, with ■
the scene changing iw the Italian
Riviera for the third.
Additional laughs are provided j
by Gaillard Fryer and Emeline Nol- !
len in the parts of Eustice Dabbitt
and Julia Cragworthy, two rather
elderly and outspoken Britons. Hu
bert Chain as Claude Eccles and
Betty Davidson as Priscilla Hartle
berry further provide amusement
in a human and entertaining plot., j
The cast also includes Catherine j
Musante, Edwin Gerhardt, Margery
Thomas, Itay Lindman, and Robert i
Nichols. The sets for the produc- j
tion are designed by Frederick !
Stover.
