Offering Noel Coward's English
comedy, "The Young Idea," the Dra
matic Council will present the first
play of the spring quarter tomorrow
night in the Assembly 11 all.
In a humorous and human way, the
play deals with the family difficulties
of an English land-owner. The scenes
are laid in England and on the Italian
Riviera, and a steady lire of comedy
is kept up throughout the three acts.
Direction of the production is by Har
old Helvenston, and the sets are de
signed by Frederick Stover.
I'laying the leading roles are Doug
las Gregg, Pattj Edwards, and Ruli
land Isaly, as George I.!rent, and his
two children, Gerda and Sholto.
Brent's first wife, Jennifer, is por
trayed by Helen Thompson, and his
second wife, Cicely, by Dorothy Tully.
I lie domestic entanglements resulting
from his divorce from Jennifer fur
nish the plot, in which is mixed an
amusing picture of rural British life
among the land-owning, fox-hunting
gentry.
