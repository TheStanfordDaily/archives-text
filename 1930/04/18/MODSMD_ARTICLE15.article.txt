# CARD DEBATERS LOSE TILT WITH CHINESE TEAM
## Stanford Is Represented By Wenig, Kimpton, And Lowe Audience Awards Decision To Harvard Duo 
### 
" 'All men arc alike, but in habits
11icv differ widely'â€”that is the ground
[on which the comparative merits of
! American and Chinese philosophies of
I life may he reconciled," said Pardee
Lowe of Stanford in last night's de
i bate with the Chinese Debating Coun
j cil of Harvard University. The Chi
nese team was awarded an audience
| decision of 150 to 133.
Victor K. Kwong and Peter K.
i Kiang were the speakers for the Chi-
I ncsc Council, while Herbert Wenig
land Lawrence Kimpton upheld Ameri
' can ideals for Stanford. Pardee
j Lowe, as an American citizen of Chi -
i ncsc ancestry, delivered the first
Stanford rebuttal in place of Kimp
ton. Ihe ( hinese had the affirmative
side of the question, "Resolved: That
the ( hinese philosophy of life is more
I conducive to human happiness than the
American." Professor Payson J.
I reat of the History Department
acted as chairman.
Old Concept False
"The old conception was that all
| Chinese were laundrymen or chop
sucy merchants," began Kwong, first
affirmative speaker. "This was due to
i' in' '')iit'!c.t with the wealth
i-ijltnri: and civilization
1 which has given to the world many of
the fundamental discoveries and in
ventions. The chances of satisfying
i desires and achieving happiness arc
i very small under the American philos
ophy of materialism, which is an end
less process of 'keeping tip with the
I Joneses.' Happiness may be better
I attained under the Chinese philosophy
| of controlling inward desires."
"()nly dead ancestors are consid
i ered live issues under the Chinese
| philosophy, contended Kimpton. "The
keynote of our philosophy is youth,
reveling in power and control, while
i the happiness of China is that of an
j old man."
Art of Living Taught
" I he art of living is taught by the
1 great Chinese philosophers," argued
Kiang in behalf of his native ideals,
"rile intrinsic values of life arc or
ganized by ( hinese philosophy, and
: the relationships of life are stressed.
! While here you have the solution of
poverty in homes for the poor, in
< hina we have the prevention through
i our philosophy of sharing. The young
people of America are on the go. That
is a line spirit, but they do not know
where to stop.''
"( hinese lite presents a picture of
resignation," stated Wenig. "The Chi
nese condition is more a philosophic
hypnotism than happiness. The Amer
ican philosophy is superior because, it
lias made us a free people. The Chi
nese speakers tonight have truly shown
us that 'beyond the mountains there
arc other people.' Their mission has
been a success in creating a feeling
of greater understanding and fellow
ship toward China here at Stanford."
"( hinese civilization has had the
j honor of 'given the axe' quite thor
oughly by the gentlemen of Stanford
: tonight, modestly concluded Kwong,
last speaker of the evening.
