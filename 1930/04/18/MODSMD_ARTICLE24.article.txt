### BOB VAN ETTEN 
With both squads primed to achieve their best efforts oi the season, tin
curtain rises tomorrow afternoon at 1:45 in the Stanford stadium on the
thirty-seventh annual Stanford-California Big Meet.
Injuries may affect the work of three men formerly expected to hgure
in the meet. Don Nelson, Cardinal low hurdler, is suffering from leg injuries
sustained when be knocked over a hurdle in practice this week, and may not

be able to run his event. Spencer Bis
by, California clash man, is nursing a
pulled musclc but is expected to com
pete, while Deßerrv, Christie's lead
ing weight man, has been taking thine
easy since he broke a blood vessel in
the meet with Washington two weeks
ago.
Reports drifting down from Berke
ley indicate that the Bears intend to
pile up at least 50 points during the
afternoon. "Dink" Templeton, coach
of the Stanford track and field atb
letes, declines to make a definite pre
diction as to the score, but intimates
that the California spikesters may
catch the Cards napping and make a
substantial dent in the scoring column.
High Score Safe
Past records would indicate that
the Redshirt squad should lead then
rivals by close to thirty points when
tabulation of the afternoon's work is
completed, although there i-> little
chance that last year's high score of
points will be equaled or bet
tered.
Despite overwhelming prospects of
a Stanford victory, however, track
fans are assured of startling perform
ances in nearly all events, with a num
ber of individual duels adding spier
t<> the program.
Records Doomed
Existing Big Meet records seem
doomed to be shattered in a majority
of events. Only Bill Richardson's
1:53.8 half-mile run in 1926, Hank
Coe's 9:38.2 two-mile record set in
1929, Ward Edmonds' 13 ft. 7 in
vault in the 1928 meet, and Bob King
6 ft. 57/g in. jump, also in 1928, appeal
safe from the onslaught of the galax ,
of exceptional talent appearing in to
morrow's meet.
The world-record run of Temple
ton's quartet of baton-passers in la .1.
week's competition with Southern
California makes it appear certain
that these same men will wipe from
the boards the existing Meet rec
ord* of 3:19 set bv Babcock, Stone
Richardson, and Miller in 192.<
In the shot put Harlow Rotherl,
consistent this year at beyond the 50-
foot mark, should better hi> own Stan
ford-California record .of 49 ft. 11' .
in. made last year. Should Captain
Eric Krcnz get out a good toss in
the discus tomorrow, lie is certain to
improve on the present mark of 15b ft.
2 in. and might achieve his ambition
of bettering his world record.
Dyer Sure to Win
Despite lack of outstanding cotnpe
tition, llec Dyer may improve on flu
present record of 9.8 seconds for the
100-yard dash which lie holds joint!}
with Barber of California. Then is
also a possibility that the fleet Red
shirt will run under Morris Kirksev's
1923 record of 21.4 in the 220.
At least one Big Meet mark should
be bettered when Pogolotti and Podg<
Smith meet in the two hurdles rac<
Pogolotti, dark-haired captain of tlv
Bear squad, ran the high sticks in
14.7 to defeat Welch of the Trojans,
