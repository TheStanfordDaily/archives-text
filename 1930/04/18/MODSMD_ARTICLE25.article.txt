I' K'IN( ETON, N. J., April 1 7.—(/P) j
—College baseball, suffering for years ;
from a decline brought about by lack j
of interest, is now convalescent and j
soon may be restored to its former j
health and vigor, thinks Charles W. j
Kennedy, president of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association.
Dr. Kennedy is sponsor of a plan to :
have coaches sit in the stands during ,
college baseball games while their j
teams carry on without benefit of their 1
counsel on the bench. Much of the I
renewed interest in the college sport is !
caused by this innovation in the opi-1
nion of the Princeton board chairman, j
"J am sure it will work out satis
factorily," said Dr. Kennedy. "I have [
not yet seen a game played under the :
new Conditions, for Princeton does not (
open its league schedule until May, '
but the scheme has worked well in the j
few games in which it has had a trial." i
