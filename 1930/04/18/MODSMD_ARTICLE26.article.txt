NKW YORK, April 17.—(A 3 ) —
Rumors of plans for a merger of
Montgomery Ward & Co., and Sear
Roebuck & Co., were revived in Wall
Street today, although such rumors
have been discouraged in the past by
officials of the two companies.
Another rumor, in which Wall
Street was keenly interested, was to
the effect that a merger of Montgom
ery Ward and the J. C. Penney Com
pany is being discussed, but this too,
was discouraged at the Penney offices. !
\ merger of J. C. Penney Company I
with Sears Roebuck was considered a J
few months ago, but it was finally an- j
nounced that after a thorough study
of the situation, it had been determined ,
that such a combination would be un
economical.
