# THE 						ANCIENT FEUD
## 
### 
Tomorrow the Cardinal of Stanford and the lilne and Gold of
California will pass another milestone in ancient rivalry when the
track and licld teams of the two institutions meet on the greensward
and the cinders of the Farm's great stadium.
It will be the thirty-seventh Big Meet, and it will decide again
the track and field supremacy of Hear and Card.
For thirty-seven years now Stanford and California have been
settling that supremacy. Sometimes it has been the Cardinal, and
ometimes it has been the Mine and < lold who won. I Wit win or lose,
the old rivalry is always there.
And so it will be tomorrow. The stars and the dopesters fore
tell an overwhelming Stanford victory. Only a miracle of sport
will save the stalwarts of venerable Waif Christie when they meet
the team of the Cardinal's youthful Templeton.
IJnt in spite of the forecasts of the stars and the dopesters, vic
tory will be sweet to Sons of the Stanford Red; and defeat bitter
to those Men from Berkeley. That's the kind of rivalry this is.
That's the way it's been these thirty-seven years. But with that
recent affair of the Axe. the aged rivalry reached a new pitch of
intensity. Stanford's recapture of that ancient weapon marked a
new era of spirit on the l : arm and in Berkeley town.
May that spirit continue here and across the Hav for three times
thirty-seven years.
