# SERVICE WITH A SMIRK
## 
### 
In view of the nifty service being rendered by those who officiate
behind the lending desks in the Stanford Library, the Daily wishes
to print the following suggestions for the conduct of those who
desire to secure reading matter:
1. Approach the desks on tip-toe, using as much care and quiet
ness as possible, so as not to disturb the men at work.
2. Stand on the left foot for fifteen minutes, while waiting to
be noticed.
3. Stand on the right foot for fifteen minutes.
4. Salaam thrice.
5. Assume a proper hang-dog look, denoting the realization of
your complete insignificance in the presence of a person of superior
rank.
(>. Cough slightly.
7. Cough again slightly.
8. Shuffle your feet again.
9. If no one notices you after this process, alternate shuffling
and coughing at regular intervals.
Do not despair if at first: you are not noticed. ITave patience.
Remember that you are dealing with very busy men.
Yesterday one person, the only customer at the desk, waited ten
minutes before one of the five assistants attended to his wants.
And service with a smile! Well, we should say so.
< )f course the boys are great bidders and pretend to be a bit out
of patience with the world in general. JUit they are only fooling.
I lonestly.
The Dait.y recommends that Dr. Wilbur and Dr. Swain and
other of the lesser dignitaries of the Cniversity go around and get
a little coaching from these library chaps on the correct way to meet
ihe public. Drs. Wilbur and Swain are entirely too informal and
obliging.
Men in responsible positions should really be dignified, you
know.
