# D.A.R. FINGER IN THE PIE

Mrs. Charles Brand, whoso greatest claim to fame seems to he
that she is the wife of a minor Ohio representative, spoke to assem
bled ladies of the D.A.R. Wednesday. In effect she informed them
that President Hoover does not know what he is talking about.
Said Mrs. Brand: "In this time of unrest over the world when
work is heing done to drag the United States into a tangle of
Kuropean politics hy way of the League of Nations, or by way of
t'ne World Court or any consultation pact, or by any means, little
or big, slight or important, tÂ« get us involved in European diplo
macy or in Kuropean offensive or defensive operations, it is healthy
for us to look back to the days of our revolutionary fathers and
mothers when our flag was born."
Isn't that a progressive, a constructive twentieth-century stand?
It is unfortunate that Mrs. Brand and others of her ilk don't live
hack in the day* of "our revolutionary fathers and mothers when our
flag was born."
People, such as Mrs. Brand, who have a superabundance of
regard for the "good old days" should, to be consistent, light their
houses with tallow candles, provide their husbands with rapiers, and
keep armed retainers.
The Daughters of the American Revolution organization will do
veil to remember the ridiculous situation in which it found itself
through its blacklists.
