THE CAR OF CROESUS. By Ern
est Poole. The MacMillan Com
pany. New York, 1930. At the
Palo Alto Book Shop.
Ernest. Poole's latest book, Tlie
Car of Croesus, is slightly different
from liis former novels. Mr. Poole
Is .still romantic, hut he stages liis
latest romance in metropolitan New
York rather (linn in llm usual rural
setting. The Car of Croesus was
originally published as a series of
short stories in tlie Ladies' Home
Journal. Thai is enough said, if
you happen to agree with Christo
pher Morley's opinion of the
"Ii.H.J." In spite of its binding in
novel form, The Car .of Croesus
remains a spries of stories loosely
joined by lwo principal characters
and an automobile.
The story of an automobile rent
ed by a, Russian refugee prince and
Chicago dress-buyer lo whomsoever
it may please (at $100 per hour)
offers great opportunities for
studies in human nature and its
purposes, whether sinister, pathe
tic, or humorous. However, Mr.
Poole fails lo seize these opportuni
ties. Two of the incidents, one con
cerning the marriage of a racketeer
(See Daily Californian for defini
tion) and the other relating the
intricacies of a woman's political
campaign, are interesting; but
even in these the author seems to
fail to get the most, out of his situ
ation.
A lew clever characters and some
amusing situations, these make
The Car of Croesus readable light
fiction. But never,, does Mr. Poole
succeed in uniting interesting in
cident with interesting character
in order to make even one good
story, which might redeem the en
tire book. —J, R.
THE HOUSE OF THE VANISH
ING GOBLETS. By The Eding
tons. The Century Co., New
York and London. 1930.
The Edingtons, authors of "The
Studio Murder Mystery," locate
their latest thriller in "our own
famous Winchester mystery house"
near San Jose. And so of course
all good Stanford people should im
bibe these '500 pages of nice juicy
murders and confusing clues—be
sure not to forget that jeering red
cherry that the peevishly vindica
tive murderer left as a souvenir
after each murder —if only to be
loyal.
But come, our reading is making
us morbid and different, much too
analytical. As an ordinary mystery
story The Edingtons' latest work
is within the pale. If the clues
sometimes mount with rapidity to
such numbers as to become tire
some, the perfect setting offered
for mystery in this Winchester

I house with its gruesome rumors
I balances such weakness.

ELIZABETH SLEEPS OUT—at
the Alcazar Theater, San Fran
cisco.
I To those who are in search of a
I slightly salacious play let this be a
! warning. Jn spite of its title, "Kliza
jbetli Sleeps Out," is more or less strict
ily moral. More or less because there
j are certain events that might be mis-
I construed but nevertheless prove to be
| absolutely proper. one of
5 the generously built, spinster Tweedies,
! goes on a party with a young man and
| does not return until the next morning
and then a little the. worse for wear,
j It was a good parly, liquor., madhouse,
land all the trimmings, but when it is
t known that her escort was her nephew
j Worthington, even the other Tweedies
arc satisfied.
j The Tweedies are described by
I Elizabeth as fur-hearing animals that
jdo not bear young. The oldest was
• married once for three weeks how
icver, and there is a young and beauti
! ful Tweedie niece from somewhere or
j other. The niece nearly creates a scan
| dal in the family by falling in love at
| one glance with a creature who ap
-1 pears to be Crumble Parlor's assistant
j deputy mortician. He turns out t«» be
a multi-millionaire though, and every
body is happy.
-Marion Lord plays the title role and
j is as funny as ever as the large mid
j Victorian spinster. Miss Lord togeth-
Icr with her two ample sisters have
j some very ludicrous scenes and bal
| mice the stage nicely. Frank Da
! rien as the family lawyer from the
firm of Appleway, Appleway, and
i Plunkett makes the most of a good
| character role. Lurene Tuttle is a
very pretty ingenue, and let us not
forget Vane, the butler, who believes
that discretion is the better part of
buttling.
"Elizabeth Sleeps Out" is a typical
Duff} play. The lines are funny, the
situation amusing. The plot is not
trite yet not startlinglv new. There is
110 suspense; the atmosphere is al
ways pleasant. The actiiffi runs
smoothly. There Is no great acting
and no great heights are reached, but
: it is all very level and entertaining.
