# EDITORS SCORE 'SPACE GRAFTERS'
## Journalism Schools Draw Fire at Press Meet 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 17 (A y ). —
Criticism of the work of schools of
journalism, warning against unjust le
gal censorship of newspapers, and cau
tion against permitting press agents to
"graft space" in news columns and
thus mislead readers marked the open
ing session here today of the annual
conference of the American Society
of Newspaper Editors.
Sam M. Williams, editor in-chief of
the St. Paul Dispatch and the St.
Paul Pioneer Press, presenting the
report of the Committee on Schools
and Departments of journalism for
George B. Armstead, managing edi
tor of the Hartford Courant, the com
mittee chairman, bluntly told the edi
tors that the schools of journalism
were not accomplishing their purpose
and turning out successful newspa
permen.
" I lie schools of journalism them
selves arc remiss." Williams said, "for
the unsatisfactory product that is be
ing foisted upon the newspapers. We
have found that many of the gradu
ates of the schools of journalism have
selected that course as the easier way
of getting through college and in our
own offices we have found that only
one out of twenty graduates of the
schools make good."
The report presented by Williams
urged that schools of journalism be
made graduate institutions and said it
was a mistake to push trade school
subjects into an academic college cur
riculum.
W illianis expressed the opinion that
to<) many students were being ac
cepted in journalism classes and that
stififer standards must be established
and more selection of students exer
cised to improve the conditions in
schools of journalism. He told the
editors that, judging from the jour
nalism graduates, the University of
Missouri was turning out more fin
ished newsjKiper workers than any
other school.
