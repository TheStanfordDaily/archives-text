ECCE HOMO
j Now this here is a college man;
Renowned since picture shows !
began
For childish pranks and foolish '
ways,
For walking always in a, daze,
For wearing pants which point both
ways
(For which, they say, poor papa
pays),
For swiping all his roommate's
clothes,
' His ear . . . what else God only '
knows,
For putting on a "mucker pose,"
For hissing actors off the stage,
For starting in to rant and rage |
Just like a monkey in a cage
When everything is not just right.
Indeed, you could not call him
bright;
He just reverses day and night; j
He's always up to something dumb, ;
Like chasing women, or with some
Obscene, lewd language raising hell
With all, one deems polite and swell.
In some night (dub till one or three i
Or four or five or six bells he
Sops up bad booze and makes
whoopee
And tries to be depraved and wild;
In short, he's neither sane nor mild.
(Hocus-pocus, tidley-wink,
And it: you think I lie,
You can go to any show,
And see the same as I.)
