# KINKY KATRINKA IS BACK! BIG PYTHON RETURNS TO BEACH
## 
### 
LONG BEACH, April 17. (/P) â€”
Katrinka, 30-foot Sumatra python,
A.W.O.L. since Saturday night, is
home again.
The snake disappeared Saturday j
night from her cage in a conces- :
sion on the water front. Fifty dol- !
lars was offered for her return.
Searchers poked, none too enthusi- j
nstically, into holes and corners of j
ihe pier. She was not found. Then '
a publicity hoax was suspected.
Today noon bathers saw her, 1
curled on the rocks of the new i
Rainbow Pier. She was asleep, di
gesting the 60-pound live pig fed
her a day before her escape. Twen
ty-five men carried her on their
shoulders along the amusement
zone back to her cage. Katrinka
will not have a chance to go ad
venturing again.
