## 
### 
ADRIAN, Mich., April 17.— (/P)~
The retiring disposition of 1.. !•". Root,
is famed over N'enawee County. Mr.
Knot has spent most of his life trying
to be inconspicuous, consequently he
I is bit put out today to find his name
! in the papers.
Mr. Root was seated quietly at the
1 corner table ol a Democratic dinner
here last night, contentedly pulling a
| cigar, which, since lie disdains to reach
publicly for smokes, lie had brought
j from his own private stock.
At the high point of the speaking, a
loud blast shook the listeners from
their lethargy and Mr. Root disap
peared in a cloud oi smoke. There
were cries of "bomb,'' "Republican
plot," and "lire."
Soon Mr. Root was hauled from his
' overturned chair beneath the table and
i became the center of attraction. Order
was restored, but Mr. Root had to
! make a speech.
"Doggone it,' said Mr. Root, "look
at my eyebrows, burned right oft !
When I catch the fellow that slipped
that loaded cigar in my private stock,
he'll pay for making me notorious like
this."
