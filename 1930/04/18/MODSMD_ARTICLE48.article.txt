# REDMEN MAY HAVE HARD BATTLE WITH MINNESOTA ELEVEN
##

\V!kmi Stan ford's football varsity
i journeys baek to the wheat field of
New Scandanavia to play the Univer
sity of Minnesota stalwarts on Oc
tober 11, Warner may find a hard team
or just a mediocre outfit.
But when one remembers such All
- Americans as Joesting, Tanner, and
Nagurski, thoughts trickle over that
the Gophers will by no means be even
a hard foe—they'll lie potential victors.
Of course such stars as the above men
were turned out in the regime of Doc
Spears, now head mentor at Oregon,
and maybe Coach Fritz Crisler won't
, be able to duplicate the rotund Spears
—at least not in 1 lie first year.
Jack Manders, big sophomore full
back, is the outstanding man at pres
! ont on the Minneapolis squad with
Pete Somer turning in good perfor
mances at quarter and a little open
field running on the side. McDougal
is the best halfback, speed being his
main asset. Tanner is coaching the
line and is fast rounding into shape a
number of good prospects including
Reihsen, Stein, Boland, and John
stone.
