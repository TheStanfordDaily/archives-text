WHAT A WEEK-END!
Faint whispers of the call to
study still trickling weakly through
the consciences of those hardened
scholars who have not yet taken !
the count from the languid atmos
phere of spring on the Stanford
campus will receive the knockout
blow with a contemplation-of the
calendar of sports events planned i
for this afternoon and tomorrow, j
For sport dishes calculated to suit i
die taste of every fan will he laid out ;
in abundance befitting a holiday in the j
ancient Roman coliseum.
Of principal interest to students
and the horde of alumni pouring j
in to celebrate the annual Home- !
coming is the Big Meet. On the ,
Stanford oval tomorrow afternoon ;
will compete stars of international ;
prominence. Harlow Rothert, |
mighty shotput tosser; Captain |
Eric Krenz, holder of the world's I
discus championship; Hec Dyer, 1
whose sensational defeat of Wy- j
koff in the southland stamps him
as a coming champion; the Cardi- |
nal relay quartet, recent smashers
of a long-standing world's record;
Curtice and Churchill, javelin
throwers whose spears dig into the !
turf beyond the 200-foot mark on
nearly every toss; Pogolotti,
whose double contest with Podge
Smith looms as the closest battle
of the afternoon; these and lesser j
lights will put on performances !
with more than the appeal of the !
most spectacular eight-ring cir- j
cuses.
Opportunities galore to view their |
favorite pastime hammer on the doors j
of those who look upon baseball as i
the national game. At the Stanford !
diamond this afternoon Coach W<>l- 1
ter's sluggers tangle with the Trojans, j
present favorites to capture the con- ,
ference title. At the same time in ■
Berkeley Stanford's yearlings meet
the Bear Cubs in the deciding contest
of their series.

Unusual play looms when the
class of '99 meets the combined
talent of '97, '98, and '00 on the
sunken diamond at 10 o'clock to
morrow morning. Heroes of the
diamond of thirty years ago will
show that they retain much of
their old skill in what promises to
be a sizzling battle from start to
finish.
In the feature baseball event of all,
the Cardinal varsity will attempt to
break a long string of California vic
tories on the varsity diamond follow
ing the Big Meet. Norm Horner,
credited with an unconscious assist in
the recent axe episode, has already
taken two hard-fought victories from
the Redshirts on the Berkeley field,
hut Wolter's men are primed to give
the Bear hurler lots of trouble in to
morrow's encounter.
Tennis fans may make the trek
to California tomorrow morning
when Captain Larry Hall and his j
racquet-swinging teammates at
tempt to finish a somewhat incon- j
sistent season with a victory over
the Blue and Gold tennis men.
