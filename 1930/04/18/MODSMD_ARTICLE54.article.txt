# THE 						ELEPHANT'S TWO FOXES ...
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Connie Mack is older than John
j McGraw, and has been managing base-
I ball teams longer, yet he hasn't won
|as many pennants. Maybe that's why
I he didn't retire at the end of last sea
j son, when lii> ambition of fifteen years
j was realized and he again led his team
i Connie 1 s team repeated in 1910, '11,
j '13, and 14, so he probably sees no
! reason why the present ' champions
| shouldn't he good for another year at
â–  least. The A's on paper appear
I stronger than last year, and should

be good for at least 100 victories in
1930.
, Sammy Hale has departed, and "Old
Man. River" Quinn lias about reached
the end of the trail, but Mack has for
tified his catching staff with Wallic
i Schang, and his infield with Kric Mc
! air and Dib Williams, and he also has
j Jim Keesey to fill in at first, and has
. added Leroy Mahaffey to his pitching
I staff.
I As everybody knows, the team of
; Dykes, Bolev, Bishop, and Fox on the
!
,
i
;
!

'inner defense, Simmons, Haas, Miller, J
and Summa in the outfield, Cochrane
and Perkins behind the hat, and Grove,
Walberg, Earnshaw, Khmke, Rommel,
and Shores in the box, is just about
the best combination in either league,,
and Connie is much too smart to waste j
any time in changing a lineup that was
good enough to win the pennant by {
an eighteen-game margin and the
world series with only the loss of one ;
contest.
I And now we come to that young i

fox, Jimmy I'oxx, a twenty-two-year
old wonder who can catch, play third
base or first, and whose batting aver
age has never been below .313 since
he joined the Athletics as a kid of
seventeen back in 1923. "Home Run '
Baker discovered Foxx, and although
the figures are not at hand, I'm sure
that Jimmy the Kid has already hit
more home runs than his discoverer.
''Home-Run" Roxx made 33 circuit
clouts last season, 13 in 1928, and 3 in
1927.
