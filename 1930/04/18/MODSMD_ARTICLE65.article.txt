Miners off duty are shown gathered around the head of the 600-foot counterbalance railway which leads down a steep slope to the main entrance of the Carbonado, Wash.,
coal mine in which seventeen men lost their lives in an explosion last Saturday even ing. The men are waiting for news from the searchers in the shaft.
After going down the 600-foot counterbalance railway the miners traveled- along a rock tunnel and down another counterbalance before reaching the Douty vein of
of coal where the blast occured. United States, and county officials, as well as miners' representatives were attempting to find a cause for the explosion which killed the
men and burned their bodies badly. Men working in other sections of the mine were endangered by the gas formed by the explosion but escaped without injury when the
gas was sucked from the shaft and workings. â€”Associated Press Photograph.
