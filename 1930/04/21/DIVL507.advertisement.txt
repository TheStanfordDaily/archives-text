Somewhere the right
pipe anil the right
tobacco are waiting
JUST for YOU
CARRY ON, man; never say die, don't
give up the ship, and all that sort
of thing. Somewhere the right pipe and
the right tobacco are waiting—just for
you. Carry on! Find 'em!
The trick is to find both—to find,
for instance, the pipe with just the
shape and weight, just the balance and
size and "grip" that suit you. No easy
job—but it's your job, and the world
is full of pipes.
The tobacco problem is easier, for we
can help you there, not only with the
suggestion that Edgeworth very prob
ably is the tobacco you are looking for,
but also with some Edgeworth. The
Edgeworth will smoke mpst benignly in
your tentative pipe, and it will smoke
there several times. We mean every
word: several good heaping pipefuls of
Edgeworth, a generous packet of abso
lutely genuine Edgeworth, all free and
for nothing if you'd like to try it. Done?
Then the coupon, please.
