# TOYON CLUB TO VOTE ON LIVING GROUP CHANGE
## Propose to Put Members Of Seven Eating Clubs Exclusively in Toyon Change to Go into Effect October 1st if Plan Is Approved by University 
### 
Members of Toyon Club will vote
tomorrow evening on the proposal
thnl Toyon liall be reserved exclu
sively for members of the seven
eating clubs beginning with next
lull quarter, according to Fletcher
I>n 11 on, chairman of the hall coun
cil. Balloting will take place from
7 to 10: HO o'clock.
Sponsors of tlie plan declare that
"the congeniality of dormitory life
would be promoted, and the demo
cratic ball spirit of Stanford im
proved, il Toyon were given over
to the exclusive use of the mem
bers of the seven existing eating
clubs. Experience has since demon
strated that living together as w.ell
at> eating together can be con
genial, and that much of the at
tractiveness of life in the halls is
lost through geographical separa
tion of groups of men who are na
turally congenials in the various
clubs."
Under ihe proposed plan, which
will go into operation October 1,
il approved, the rooms in Toyon
would be given over to Breakers,
HI Campo, HI Capitan, 101 Cuadro,
101 Tigre, El Toro, and Los Arcos
clubs for distribution to their
members. Toyon Club would then
be the aggregate of the eating club
members, and the Council would
remain the same, excepting that
independents remaining in the hall
would not be represented. Inde
pendent men living in Toyon at.
present would continue to hold
their room rights.
The final decision on the pro
posal will rest with the University
administration, although Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, president, and Dr.
Robert 10. Swain, acting-president,
have voiced their approval of such
a move, Dutton states. The plan
has been accepted by all seven of
the clubs. The proposal that, the
rooms be allotted in sections to the
separate clubs was voted down at
a meeting of their representatives
last week.
"The eating clubs feel that it
will strengthen them individually,
and Toyon Hall as a unit," Dutton
stated in regard to the proposal.
