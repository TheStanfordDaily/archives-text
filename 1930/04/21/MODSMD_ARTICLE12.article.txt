# AUDIENCE IS AMUSED BY 'YOUNGIDEA'
## Noel Coward Play Source Of Enjoyable Evening; Gregg Outstanding 
### Sylva Weaver 
Although consistently uneven in
j tone and characterization, "The
! Young Idea" provided an enjoyable
i evening for the large audience of
j students and home-coming alumni
l in the Assembly Jlall last Saturday
] night. The light comedy rose to
i comic heights spasmodically. Sev
eral distinctly good performances
: kept the action moving along.
First honors go to Douglas Gregg
who put an understanding sym
pathy into his role. Although called
| upon to read decidedly facetious
I lines, Gregg managed to make his
! characterization truly convincing.
| His performance during the chil
| dren's enthusiastic description of
the trip to Italy was one of the
finest bits in the show.
Edwards, Isaly Good
Patty Edwards and Ruhland Isaly
as the two children put an admir-
I able restraint in their spontaneous
i precocity but their interpretations
J lacked t he smoothness which comes
j with more experience. They were
I youthfully refreshing and worked
j together well. They show great
I promise for future dramatic produc-
I tions.
Dorothy Tully's lovely voice add
| fed immeasurably to a rather color-
Mess role, although her characteriza
tion lacked the vivacity and force
it might have had. Helen Thomp
son put spirit and personality into
Ja role she had studied for three
j days, and she deserves much credit
| for it.
Betty Davidson as Priscilla
j scored one of the evening's suc
! cesses in her "beautiful but dumb"
role. Her performance was con
i sist.ently good. Margery Thomas
and Hmmeline Nollen played their
! '
' short parts nicely.
Gaillard Fryer lived up to the
'expectations of his "Mistress" per
formance and put life into a brief
I part. Edwin Gerhard! lacked a
sense of reality as Roddy, and Hu
| bert Chain spoke his lines without
; much zeal. Ray Lind 111 an was well
! suited to his role although his in
j terpretation was spotty. Catherine
i Musante shone in her small part ,
j The butler gave his role a very un
usual interpretation.
Stover's sets were nice although
; not exceptional. The Brent, home
in England gave a varied and ef
| fective selection of entrances.
'Helen Thompson's "scarlet over
jails" jarred on the usual Helven
j ston pictorial effects but the lial-
I inn villa had a continental alnios
: pliere.
Helvenston's direct ion was slight
ly uneven. The second act which
commenced with a decided im
pression of a too-crowded stage eul
! minuted in one of the highest
comic effects Gerda's and Sholto's
J rushing out with Cicely's suitcases,
j lielvenston brought out a good
; deal of comedy in the second scene
iof Act II with the children and
Priscilla. The lighting here was ex
cellent.
The tempo lagged perceptibly at
moments, and the English accents
were of all varieties. Despite the
actors' tendency to say their
speeches and then drop out of their
characters, several even perform
ances and tin 1 lines themselves held
the comedy's unity. The sad truth
of it is that the "Young Idea" fell
in line with its name and proved
;i little more amateurish than most
Stanford product ions.
Tlu- orchestra added a pleasingly
professional touch, and it is hoped
that Speegle's plea for a new
"home for aged horses" has ma
il rial response. If the clamor of
; < ene changing was an indication
of Stanford's dramatic handicaps,
it must have been easy for the
alumni to realize the real need for
;i new theatre.
Incidentally, the Stanford roughs
presented an amusing proof to the
alumni that college students are
really air-minded individuals. One
of the cunning little airplanes even
went so far as to jeopardize the
safe dntmatic enjoyment of the act
ing president of the I'nlversity.

eral distinctly good performances

First honors go to Douglas Gregg
who put an understanding sym
pathy into his role. Although called

I lines, Gregg managed to make his

Edwards, Isaly Good
Patty Edwards and Ruhland Isaly
as the two children put an admir-
I able restraint in their spontaneous
i precocity but their interpretations
J lacked t he smoothness which comes
j with more experience. They were
I youthfully refreshing and worked
j together well. They show great
I promise for future dramatic produc-
I tions.
Dorothy Tully's lovely voice add
| fed immeasurably to a rather color-
Mess role, although her characteriza
tion lacked the vivacity and force
it might have had. Helen Thomp
son put spirit and personality into
Ja role she had studied for three
j days, and she deserves much credit
| for it.
Betty Davidson as Priscilla
j scored one of the evening's suc
! cesses in her "beautiful but dumb"
role. Her performance was con
i sist.ently good. Margery Thomas
and Hmmeline Nollen played their
! '
' short parts nicely.
Gaillard Fryer lived up to the
'expectations of his "Mistress" per
formance and put life into a brief
I part. Edwin Gerhard! lacked a
sense of reality as Roddy, and Hu
| bert Chain spoke his lines without
; much zeal. Ray Lind 111 an was well
! suited to his role although his in
j terpretation was spotty. Catherine
i Musante shone in her small part ,
j The butler gave his role a very un
usual interpretation.
Stover's sets were nice although
; not exceptional. The Brent, home
in England gave a varied and ef
| fective selection of entrances.
'Helen Thompson's "scarlet over
jails" jarred on the usual Helven
j ston pictorial effects but the lial-
I inn villa had a continental alnios
: pliere.
Helvenston's direct ion was slight
ly uneven. The second act which
commenced with a decided im
pression of a too-crowded stage eul
! minuted in one of the highest
comic effects Gerda's and Sholto's
J rushing out with Cicely's suitcases,
j lielvenston brought out a good
; deal of comedy in the second scene
iof Act II with the children and
Priscilla. The lighting here was ex
cellent.
The tempo lagged perceptibly at
moments, and the English accents
were of all varieties. Despite the
actors' tendency to say their
speeches and then drop out of their
characters, several even perform
ances and tin 1 lines themselves held
the comedy's unity. The sad truth
of it is that the "Young Idea" fell
in line with its name and proved
;i little more amateurish than most
Stanford product ions.
Tlu- orchestra added a pleasingly
professional touch, and it is hoped
that Speegle's plea for a new
"home for aged horses" has ma
il rial response. If the clamor of
; < ene changing was an indication
of Stanford's dramatic handicaps,
it must have been easy for the
alumni to realize the real need for
;i new theatre.
Incidentally, the Stanford roughs
presented an amusing proof to the
alumni that college students are
really air-minded individuals. One
of the cunning little airplanes even
went so far as to jeopardize the
safe dntmatic enjoyment of the act
ing president of the I'nlversity.
