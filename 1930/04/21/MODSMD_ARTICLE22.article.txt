# AITKEN TO TALK ON ASTRONOMY
## Noted Scientist To Speak Here Tomorrow Night 
### 
Dr. Robert (i. Aitken, astronomer
iiml associate director of Lick Observ
atory, Mount Hamilton, will speak in
the Stanford Assembly Hall tomorrow
evening at 7:,?() o'clock. "Recent Dis
coveries in Astronomy" will be his
topic.
Aitken will tell of the recent dis
covery at the Lowell Observatory of
an object which gives promise of be
ia trans-Neptunian planet. He will
also speak of Dr. Trumper's work at
the Lick Observatory on the star clus
ters of the Milky Way. The latter,
according to Aitken, has a significant
bearing upon current theories of the
dimensions of our stellar system, and
must be considered in connection with
Hubble''* work at Mount Wilson on
the extra-galactic nebulae, and with
Shaplcy\ work at Mount Wilson* and
at Harvard on the globular cluster.
