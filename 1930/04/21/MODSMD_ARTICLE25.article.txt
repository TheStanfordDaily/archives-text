# REDSHIRTS SET 3 NEW MARKS IN TRACK MEET
## Stanford Takes Expected Victory Over Berkeley Cinder Team, 83 to 48 Unbeatable Form Showed By Krenz and Rothert In Discus, Shot Events 
### Bob Van Etten 
r l liree Rip Meet records were
broken, all by Cardinal athletes, as
Stanford's track and field team
came through in expected fashion
Saturday afternoon to win their
seventh consecutive meet from
California by a score of 8:5 1 15 to
47 14-15.
Flirting constantly with world's
record distance, Captain Erie
Krenz moved his Big Meet discus
record out to 161 feet V 2 inch. Hal
low Rothert added more than a
foot and a half to his last year's
mark in tlie shot put, setting the
new record of 51 feet 10% inches
The third record was established
by the Cardinal relay team whicb,
although not pressed, covered the
four laps in 3:18.7, slightly under
the 3:19.0 time run by Babcock,
Storie, Richardson, and Miller in
192G.
A fourth record was equalled
when Hec Dyer stepped the 100
yard dash in 9.8 seconds, tying the
mark which lie holds jointly with
Barber of California.
Hoped-for new records in the
dashes and hurdle races were not
achieved, due chiefly to the usual
breeze hitting the runners on the
straightaway, and, in the sprints,
because of lack of competition for
Dyer.
Firsts About Even
Victory for Stanford resulted
largely from second and third place
strength ,as the Cardinals and
Bears very nearly evenly divider!
firsts, Stanford collecting eight, and
California seven. Five clean sweeps
were taken by Coach "Dink" Teni
pleton's men, in the 100, 220, shot
put, discus, and broad-jump. Call
fornia gathered all nine points in
the javelin.
Curly-haired "Spud" Mossman
proved California's hero of lb'-
dual encounter, pulling the old
"iron man" stunt to win both mile
and two-mile races. Mossman out
distanced Bob Brown by twenty
yards in the shorter grind to break
the tape in 4:28.4 and half an hour
later bested Johnny Parker in the
final sprint of the eight-lap event.
Only one of the featured hurdle
duels between Captain A 1 Pogolotti
of California and Podge Smith of
Stanford provided the expected
thrills. Smith, after getting off to
a good start in the low sticks race,
held this lead until after crossing
the last hurdle, but the Bear cup
tain, a faster sprinter, caught his
rival at the tape, the two men end
inK in a dead heat. In the. high
sticks Pogolotti won by five yards
from Al Nisbet, who barely nosed
out Smith for second place. Neithei
race was particularly fast, the
times being 24.<i and 15.4, respec
tively.
Mossman had too much speed tot
Brown in the mile, and pulled away
from the Card runner at the star'
of the final lap. Brown met a dial
lenge from Novo in the finish
sprint, but outdistanced him and
took second.
Crossing the line behind the fly
ing heels of Hec Dyer, Howell and
Giberson made it a clean sweep for
Stanford in the century. Bisbee of
i California pulled up at the finish
but was too late to nip any of the
Card sprinters.
Johnny Morrison broke the tape
in a slow 440 followed by Maynor
1 Shove. Johnson of California out
sprinted Ike Hables to take third
i place. The time was 49.2 seconds.
In the two-mile Mossman broke
tin; tape for his second victory in
i9:51 closely followed by Johnny
Parker. Henderson, reputedly the
best California distance man,
faded in the last lap and Nunes
1 took third with thirty yards to
spare.
After being passed by Cooper
within 220 yards of the half-mile
; finish Zellman outsprinted the Card
! 880 man to win in 1:57.9. Cooper
and Atkinson put up a great battle
to beat out Wright of the Bears
for second and third place.
Clean Sweep
| Stanford collected their second
clean sweep on the track when
Dyer led Giberson and Howell
across the line in 21.8 seconds in
the 220. A full five yards separated
Howell from the nearest Bear
; sprinter.
With Smith and Pogolotti eon
eluding their low hurdles hostilities
in a tie, Nisbet sneaked in for the
extra point. Seven false starts put
all the hurdles men on edge.
Meeting no competition from
j California, the Cardinal relay quar
tet barely bettered the Big Meet
record, running more than two
seconds slower than they did
: against Southern California. Mc-
Dermott gave Hables a two-yard
lead on Bondschu, Hables increased
; the lead to fifteen yards, Shove
passed the baton to Morrison 40
j yards ahead of Lucas, and Mor
rison breezed across the line a good
50 yards in front of Johnson.
Krenz tossed the shot 51 feet 2%
inches to place second to Rothert,
while Fleislihaeker collected third
with a put of 4G feet 1 /s inch. In
the discus Rothert threw 148 feet,
8% inches for second place, while
Grey's 138 feet won him third.
Churchill and Curtice came
through with tosses beyond 20(1 feet
to place one, two, in the javelin,
while Akers got off a heave of ISO
I feet 10 1 /2 inches to collect the lone
i digit. Goldsmith, Stanford's leading
i entry, threw 17!) feet 9*4 inches.
Rice of California jumped G feet
j Vj- inch to win the high jump with
Madison, Allan, French, Jackle
vifcli, and Enright of the Bears, ty
ing for second at 5 i'eet 11 inches.
In the pole vault Pool cleared 1"
feet for first, place with Koblick of
1 California and Johns and DeGroot
tying for second at 12 feet t! inches.
| Berry, who against U.S.C. cleared
j 13 feet 3 inches, went out at the
i twelve and a half foot mark,
j Stanford's broad-jumping trio of
Dowell, West, and Butler, placed
one, two, three, in their event, with
Dowell winning at 24 feet 11 Vft
j inches. Bias, the best California
I jumper, leaped 22 feel 10 inches.
