## Stanford Takes Expected Victory Over Berkeley Cinder Team, 83 to 48 Unbeatable Form Showed By Krenz and Rothert In Discus, Shot Events 
### Bob Van Etten 
r l liree Rip Meet records were
broken, all by Cardinal athletes, as
Stanford's track and field team
came through in expected fashion
Saturday afternoon to win their
seventh consecutive meet from
California by a score of 8:5 1 15 to
47 14-15.
Flirting constantly with world's
record distance, Captain Erie
Krenz moved his Big Meet discus
record out to 161 feet V 2 inch. Hal
low Rothert added more than a
foot and a half to his last year's
mark in tlie shot put, setting the
new record of 51 feet 10% inches
The third record was established
by the Cardinal relay team whicb,
although not pressed, covered the
four laps in 3:18.7, slightly under
the 3:19.0 time run by Babcock,
Storie, Richardson, and Miller in
192G.
A fourth record was equalled
when Hec Dyer stepped the 100
yard dash in 9.8 seconds, tying the
mark which lie holds jointly with
Barber of California.
Hoped-for new records in the
dashes and hurdle races were not
achieved, due chiefly to the usual
breeze hitting the runners on the
straightaway, and, in the sprints,
because of lack of competition for
Dyer.
Firsts About Even
Victory for Stanford resulted
largely from second and third place
strength ,as the Cardinals and
Bears very nearly evenly divider!
firsts, Stanford collecting eight, and
California seven. Five clean sweeps
were taken by Coach "Dink" Teni
pleton's men, in the 100, 220, shot
put, discus, and broad-jump. Call
fornia gathered all nine points in
the javelin.
Curly-haired "Spud" Mossman
proved California's hero of lb'-
dual encounter, pulling the old
"iron man" stunt to win both mile
and two-mile races. Mossman out
distanced Bob Brown by twenty
yards in the shorter grind to break
the tape in 4:28.4 and half an hour
later bested Johnny Parker in the
final sprint of the eight-lap event.
Only one of the featured hurdle
duels between Captain A 1 Pogolotti
of California and Podge Smith of
Stanford provided the expected
thrills. Smith, after getting off to
a good start in the low sticks race,
held this lead until after crossing
the last hurdle, but the Bear cup
tain, a faster sprinter, caught his
rival at the tape, the two men end
inK in a dead heat. In the. high
sticks Pogolotti won by five yards
from Al Nisbet, who barely nosed
out Smith for second place. Neithei
race was particularly fast, the
times being 24.<i and 15.4, respec
tively.
Mossman had too much speed tot
Brown in the mile, and pulled away
from the Card runner at the star'
of the final lap. Brown met a dial
lenge from Novo in the finish
sprint, but outdistanced him and
took second.
