# THE
						DAILY EXPERIMENTS WITH BEAUTY
## 
### 
Daily readers will be surprised as they peruke the news over
coffee and snail this morning to perceive, on the front page, the
pulchritudinous physiognomy of a sweet southern belle, in the place
ol more usual pictures of debaters or halfbacks or statesmen or
shifts or steam shovels.
I he momentous decision to replace utility with beauty, in one
i Hie at least, was arrived at only after a long and stormy conference
of the editorial board. Half of the local llorace (ireelevs stood
• taunchly for utility; half favored the frivolity of beauty.
I bus it seemed that the lovelier things of life might be swamped
b\ crass reality. I'ill a new champion of beauty rode into the field,
in the person of Charley, the Daily's somber philosopher of the
back room., Charley's staunch defense turned the tide, and Daily
i eaders got beauty.
It's a great journalistic experiment.
