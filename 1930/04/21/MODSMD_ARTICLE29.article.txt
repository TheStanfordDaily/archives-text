# NOT THE BILTMORE
## 
### 
Stanford men live in two of the finest dormitories to he found
anywhere. Tovon and liranncr Malls represent the acme of com
fortable living (jnarters. Few rules or restrictions hind those; who
"live there. Inhabitants are free to do as they please.
I lilt now and then hall men have grown somewhat lax in caring
for ihe excellent abodes placed at their disposal. Appreciation of
itch facilities should not be overshadowed by indifference. These
costly structures are offered at dirt-cheap rates; inhabitants at
Toyon and Brainier, believe it or not, get their money's worth.
< arelessness and heedless attitudes in maintenance of these halls
is too evident to go without comment. Cigarettes have burned deep
v cars into the shiny surfaces of hallways. Windows are often shat
tered during rough moments of uproarious horseplay. Doors are
continually slammed with panel-smashing violence.
Water fights periodically convert neat passageways into sloppy
puddles. Last fall practical jokers turned fire hoses on in Brainier
and Toyonâ€”and forgot to turn them off.
I I all men, though not expected to maintain the gentility of wood
land nymphs, might be more considerate of the place they call home.
I hey're the hotels de luxe of the campus. Biltmore antics aren't in
order.
