I lie Ihiily Califoniiun points out tlint a remit Atlantic Monthly
Article states lliat college should not altempt to replace ihe parental
guidance.
Says the Calif or nian: ''Women are sheltered as long as they
remain in their homes and after college days most of them are re
quired to tight their own battles without previous experience. I Di
versity life should he a transition period where self-confidence and
independence are gained." And the. Californwn mentions further
"the petty rules and regulations imposed by the universities in the
form of requirements for signing out and signing in."
The Herkeley newspaper is unjust. It forgets what splendid
training that signing business is to college girls who get a job some
where and punch a time-clock. There's hardly any difference.
