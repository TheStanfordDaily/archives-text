CHRISTINE AND OTHER
STORIES. By Julian Green.
Harper and Brothers, New York,
1930. At the Stanford Book
store.
"Beautv has always moved ine to
I
! the strongest and tile 11,mst diverse
, feelings. The result is a sort of in
i ternal struggle which makes me pass
in the space of a single moment from
i joy to desire and from desire to de
spair. I'or that reason I hope, and
at the same time fear, to disover that
! beauty which will torment and delight
! me . . ." Thus did Christine's strange,
1 almost supernatural heauty affect tin
boy. Willi a fervor surpassing lii
thirteen years, he loved the little girl;
but the mystery of her, why she was
I always silent and kept upstairs in her
j room, was never explained. When she
was taken away, ill, the boy forgot.
The whole affair seemed like a dream.
"The human heart is indeed strange."
This, the title story, gives the tone
: which prevails to a greater or less
; degree throughout the book. Four
j beautiful, yet terrible tales. "Levia
j than" concerns the efforts of the smug
sea captain to pry into the life of the
] lone, silent passenger on his freighter.
I Driven by the captain's incessant <|ues
tinning, the man comes to believe he
I lias committed a murder and in the
j throes of confession, dies.
I I lie author seems to be more at
| home in the medium of the longer
short story. "The Keys of Death," a
I story of the homicidal mania of a boy
j against the repulsive, detestable Jalon,
a man who hangs parasitically to the
j boy s household, shows better work
-1 manship than any of the other tales.
I he word pictures, the poetic cadence
of the prose, approach stylistic per
fection. "Rather than remain in that
; house where darkness is shut up if
it were a treasure, I prefer to walk
outside in the burning air which dries
the grass and stifles the flowers, under
' that copper sky which receives its
I light from un invisible sun and devas
tates the earth."
i .

In "The Pilgrim (if the Earth,"
Green tells us, by means of a diary
and some letters, the story of Daniel
O'Donavan who was "touched by
grace" which acts "according to the
character of the person who receives
it. It converts the gentle by persua
sion ; it strikes down the proud and the
violent."
These stories leave one with a sense
of futility. They are too big to grasp
immediately. They are the sort one
finds one's sell pondering over months
later, li you like your fiction tied
up in a nutshell, with an ending that
leaves you satisfied for all time, don't
read "Christine."
—L. R.
SHE COULDN'T SAY NO—At The
California Theatre, Mayfield.
Warner Brothers are so coy.
They do the cutest things. Just to
be different.,' they leave the title of
"She Couldn't Say No" in all the
pfire virginity of the author's con
ception, and change the plot into
the usual mess of underworld, show
world, and society world.
Not one of the funny lines or
situations or characters of' Char
lotte Greenwood's stage vehicle re
main. Instead, we have a piano
pound ar in love with a show girl
who is in love with a gangster who
is in love with a society dame who
doesn't treat liirn a bit nice. Every
thing is quiet, quite too touching,
and everyone's heart, breaks three
or four times and Winnie Lightner
wastes her talents on such price
loss antiques of the dialogue-writ
ing game as "Us life, Jerry; it's
life."
In spite of all this, Winnie can
still sing, and we don't care how
often. The "Bouncin' the Baby
Around" number, put. on with all
the Lightner pep, was enough to
make up for the rest of the show.
.However, we hope the girl gets a
better break in the way of stories
next time. —L. It.
