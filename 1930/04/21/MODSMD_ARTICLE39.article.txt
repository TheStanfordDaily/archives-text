# JOHN LAW WOULD PINCH NOISY FORD
## 
### 
As a climax to the usual back-1
stage excitement, last Saturday
night, the campus cop tried to
pinch one of the most, important 1
members of the east.
The sound of a motor car added
to the tensity of certain dramatic
moments in the play. This noise i
was furnished by a Ford of many
seasons which was parked just out- I
side of the stage door over a care
fully arranged "mike."
The stage hands operating the \
amplifier were restrained from
murder with difficulty when the
over-zealous official tried to insist
on placing a ticket for parking on I
the Quad on the histrionically in-i
dined Ford.
