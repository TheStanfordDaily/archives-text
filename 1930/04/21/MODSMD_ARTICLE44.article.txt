They can hang the dunce's
cap on Mr. Norman Horner,
late custodian of the wood
chopper's weapon, but as an
exponent of the hurler's art,
he is there some three ways
from the jack, and several hun
dred patient souls who sat
through Saturday's baseball
game will testify to that effect.
The gentleman who was left hold
ing tiie handle a scant two weeks
ago received tiie high sign from
(Mint Evans, California coach, in tiie
eighth frame of Saturday's fracas,
when Stanford was in the throes
of an incipient rally at the expense
of Max Moody, a lantern-jawed
left-hander then occupying the
mound. Horner's appearance on (lie
sidelines to warm up was the oc
casion for much derogatory com
ment anent his axe-holding ability,
or lack of it. That the remarks got
under his skin was evidenced by
the vicious way he was swinging
tljem in to his catcher, with sun
dry accompanying grimaces.
Jim Mears' single over first base
was the signal for Moody's exit and
Horner's entrance into the fray, it
was also the signal for Stanford's
array of hitting talent to roll over
and say "uncle." With the Horner
teeth gritted and the Horner jaw
set, firm, the pride of the Bear
mound corps set Cutsliaw and John
son down on strikes, lost, control
for a moment to hit Churchill in
tiie ribs, and then got rid of Cook
on an easy roller. The Cards' half
of the ninth produced a single and
a walk, but that was all. The Hor
ner aplomb remained undisturbed,
and the Horner escutcheon, as far
as its record against Stanford
baseball teams is concerned, un
tarnished.
While the post-mortems are
flying hither and yon, it might
not be amiss to say a word in
praise of the courageous per
formance of Podge Smith, the
Cards' slender barrier artist,
in coming back Saturday after
noon after a disappointing
showing in the high hurdles to
tie Al Pogolotti of the Bears
in the low sticks. This in the
face of the fact that the lows
are supposed to be Pogolotti's
event and that Smith nicked
the seventh hurdle and nearly
broke stride. The time of 24:6
was nothing to sneeze at,
either. —Dick Friendlich.

ago received tiie high sign from
(Mint Evans, California coach, in tiie
eighth frame of Saturday's fracas,
when Stanford was in the throes
of an incipient rally at the expense
of Max Moody, a lantern-jawed
left-hander then occupying the
mound. Horner's appearance on (lie
sidelines to warm up was the oc
casion for much derogatory com
ment anent his axe-holding ability,
or lack of it. That the remarks got
under his skin was evidenced by
the vicious way he was swinging
tljem in to his catcher, with sun
dry accompanying grimaces.
Jim Mears' single over first base
was the signal for Moody's exit and
Horner's entrance into the fray, it
was also the signal for Stanford's
array of hitting talent to roll over
and say "uncle." With the Horner
teeth gritted and the Horner jaw
set, firm, the pride of the Bear
mound corps set Cutsliaw and John
son down on strikes, lost, control
for a moment to hit Churchill in
tiie ribs, and then got rid of Cook
on an easy roller. The Cards' half
of the ninth produced a single and
a walk, but that was all. The Hor
ner aplomb remained undisturbed,
and the Horner escutcheon, as far
as its record against Stanford
baseball teams is concerned, un
tarnished.
While the post-mortems are
flying hither and yon, it might
not be amiss to say a word in
praise of the courageous per
formance of Podge Smith, the
Cards' slender barrier artist,
in coming back Saturday after
noon after a disappointing
showing in the high hurdles to
tie Al Pogolotti of the Bears
in the low sticks. This in the
face of the fact that the lows
are supposed to be Pogolotti's
event and that Smith nicked
the seventh hurdle and nearly
broke stride. The time of 24:6
was nothing to sneeze at,
either. —Dick Friendlich.
DAT OL' DAVIL HORNER
They can hang the dunce's
cap on Mr. Norman Horner,
late custodian of the wood
chopper's weapon, but as an
exponent of the hurler's art,
he is there some three ways
from the jack, and several hun
dred patient souls who sat
through Saturday's baseball
game will testify to that effect.
