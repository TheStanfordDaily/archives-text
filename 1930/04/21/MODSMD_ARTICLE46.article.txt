# Cardinals Drop Out Of Baseball Pennant Race
## STANFORD WHIPS U.S.C. NINE; LOSES TO BEAR VARSITY Leverenz Stars For Card Tossers; Rintala Hits Homer 
### 
Stanford finished off the Con
ference baseball season last week,
; defeating (lie league-leading Tro
jan nine 4-2 on Friday, and drop
ping the tenth straight contest to
the Golden Bears following the Big
Meet Saturday afternoon by a score
of 6 t0,3,
"Levy" Leverenz turned in one
of the prettiest pitching exhibi
tions seen around these parts for
some time when lie held Southern
California batters, famed for hard
hitting, to only three hits. Arbel-
I bide, Ward, and Wilcox, leading
Conference sluggers, looked like a
group of substitutes against the
solemn Card chucker.
i Even with the "limps" on their
side, the Trojans were able to
, glean only two markers, both in
the last inning when Hanby singled,
Abel hide was safe on an error,
Ward walked, and Hanby tallied on
Wilcox's sacrifice and Arbelbide on
a wild pitch. Base Umpire Erie had
an off (lav in the field, making sev
eral bad decisions. In one instance
he called a Stanford man out. then
! safe, and then he reversed his de
cision again to call an out. Erie's
judgment called forth a howl of
protest from the fans especially
when it. developed that Shepard,
Trojan second-baseman, had drop
ped the ball during the shuffle.
Tight Ball
' Stanford tallied once in the
third, sixth, seventh, and eighth
I cantos. Singles by Johnson and
Churchill and a Trojan error made
one run and Rintala and Cook
tripled in separate innings, botli
! crossing the plate later on sacrifice
flies. Berg made the other marker,
scoring on a squeeze play when
j Cutsliaw bunted down the first-base
i line.
: California's coach, Clint Evans,
i pulled a "Husky" Hunt and started
j his second-string lineup in the
Bear-Card clash, but pulled them
I out in a hurry when the youngsters
tailed to score after three innings.
Then Glaister walked and Butler
was safe on an error, both scoring
a moment later on Kirwin's hot
single down third.
Wolter used three pitchers in
the sixth frame in a vain attempt
to retire three California men. Cad
dell had gone in for Story in the
fourth chukker but blew up two
innings later. Butler reached sec
ond when Churchill muffed his
high fly in front of the plate and
the next three men walked forcing
in Butler. Taylor went in and suc
ceeded in walking two more across
the platter. Loomis took his place
and after one more had tallied on
an infield out, the Cards finally
came in to take up their bats.
Rintala homed over the left
field wall to score Cook ahead of
him in the seventh, and Berg's
fly bounced over the fence off
(Jblister's glove in the next canto
to score the Cards' third run. Hor
ner was sent in at that stage of
the game to hold down the Red
shirts from then on, although a
ninth-inning rally almost material
ized. Leverenz, after a hard game
the day before, was sent on the
mound in the ninth inning and af
ter Horner reached first on an
error and Glaister walked, the
Stanford ace disdainfully struck
out the next three men.
The Bears used three pitchers,
for the first time in five years. 'Way
back in 1925, Ernie Nevers and
his cohorts slammed out eight runs
in two innings to ring up the last
series won by Stanford and knock
three California twirlers out of the
box.
Coach Wolter used all five of bis
moundsmen, but. Loomis was not
taken from the slab because of any
weakness displayed; be was forced
out of the game after Mears had
been sent in to pinch-hit. for him.
The Card-Bear clash merely dupli
cated the rather skimpy U.C. vic
tories that have gone before. Theo
retically, the contest should have
been won by the Redsliirts by a
score of 1 to 0, eight of the nine
runs made during the game being
unearned.
