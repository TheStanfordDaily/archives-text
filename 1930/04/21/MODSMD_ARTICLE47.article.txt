# Drawings To Be Made For Class Tourney
## Interclass Tennis Schedule Made Today by Bugge And Managers 
### 
Schedules for matches in the
coining interclass tennis tourna
ment will be definitely decided this
afternoon at 5 o'clock when man
agers of the class teams will meet
with Coach Elwyn Bugge in the
Encina Gym to draw for opponents
and dates. Play is expected to start
within the next two days.
Teams-are not yet complete, so
it is difficult to predict with any
degree of certainty the strength of
the four squads, but. at the present
time the sophomore and senior ag
gregations appear the most formid
able. The second-year men have an
outstanding star in Keith Glediiill,
national junior champion, who is
considered one of the. best players
in tiie University. He is counted
upon for a victory in one singles
and one doubles match out of every
meet, which would give the sophs
quite a start to begin with, since
they would only have to take one
more match to win each meet. Sup
porting Gledhill will be Hickman,
runner-up in the interclass singles
championship held last fall. Other
members of the squad as an
nounced tentatively are Forney,
Robinson, and Johnson.
Against the one sophomore star,
the seniors can muster an array of
strong netmen who look at least
as strong as any squad which can
be formed to oppose them. John
Wheatley, varsity captain last year,
and Ralph McElvenny, former var
sity star, head the list. They are
graduates but are eligible to com
pete for tiie class of 1930. McKellip,
Miller, Sorenson, Ricketts, and Er
-1 in, make lip a good list of varsity
candidates from which to choose
the class squad.
Neither junior nor freshman
teams are yet filled in. and so noth
ing can he said of their potentiali
ties.
