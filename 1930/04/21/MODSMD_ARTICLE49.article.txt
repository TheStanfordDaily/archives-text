Edmonds Likely Winner
Right now Edmonds appears
slated to ride through to the finals
in (lie upper bracket, but Heliman
will undoubtedly give him a hard
battle and has an excellent chance
to defeat the lanky captain. Mc-
Naughton and Hawley will be in
for a tough afternoon's work, with
the former holding a slight edge.
It looks like Thompson or Steven
son in 1 lie lower bracket finals, the
t latter being favored because of ex
perience. Goldwater and Eberhart
are perfectly capable of taking
their matches, however, and either
may finish in the money.
