## 
### 
Stanford freshman ball tossers
were unable to stem the tide of
tiie Bear Cub attack on the Berke
ley field last Friday, and lost the
deciding game of llie Little Big
Series 4 to 0. Johnson, pitching for
the Card yearlings, allowed only
six hits throughout the game, but
was given poor support by the out
field.
Saunders twirled the victory for
California, allowing only three
safeties, and striking out six bat
ters, to Johnson's ten. Stanchez,
Bear shortstop, got a home run in
tiie fifth inning, driving in Saun
ders ahead of him. Johnson con
nected for a three-bagger but the
Stanford frosli lacked the batting
punch to convert the score.
Summary: R. H. E.
California 4 6 0
Stanford 0 3 3
Saunders and York; Johnson and
Livermore.
