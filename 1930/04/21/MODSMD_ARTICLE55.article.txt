# "OLD FOX" SCORED ON BY PROWLERS
## 
### 
"Pop" Warner, Stanford's "old
fox," was, for once, literally
"caught napping" last. Friday
night. While the famous mentor
was sleeping soundly some un
known person or persons removed
a set of tools, a trouble light, and
a tire pump from his car which
was parked in the garage adjoin
ing his residence.
