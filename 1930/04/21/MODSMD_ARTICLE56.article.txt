# NINETY-NINERS LOSE BALL GAME TO '97, '98, '00, IN ALUMNI CONTEST
## 
### 
Experience beat out youth Sat
urday morning when the combined
classes of '97, '98, and '00 defeated
a baseball outfit made up of mem
bers of the class of 1899 in a rip
snorting tussle on the sunken dia
mond by a score of 8 to 5.
Dr. Robert Eckles Swain twirled
for the "ninety-niners" and pitched
good ball until he blew up in the
third inning, allowing four tallies.
His mean drops and spit-balls had
the old-timers guessing in tlie first
two cantos, when only two runs
were made.
Although the '99 aggregation lost
the battle, it took first prize in the
"boobing-the-umpire" contest. Dr.
Frank Angel, professor emeritus
of psychology, had such a hard
time coping with the jibes and pro
tests on the part of the "young
sters" that he flourished a six

' shooter for protection.
"That's an old '99 trick," was the
scornful remark of Ray Weldon,
'98, and varsity pitcher in under
graduate days, as he listened to
the various derogatory remarks
from the "ninety-niners."
Dean George Bliss Culver, '07,
was chief yell-leader for the com
bination team contingent and got
over a few choice shouts for his
I outfit.
