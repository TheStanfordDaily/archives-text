# EASTER MORNING AT THE STANFORD CONVALESCENT HOME
## Convalescent Home Children, Who Celebrated Easter Yesterday, Watch the "Runabout" Children Gather Eggs Hidden by Stanford Students 
### BY CATHERINE SPAULDING 
"I hope I get, a blue egg," grinned |
a freckled face chubby boy. "Blue's
my favorite color," he added. His
blue eyes followed the Convale-'
scent Homo children who were
hunting Easter eggs which had
been hidden in the bushes by Stan
ford co-eds from the Chi Omega
house.
"1 found a snail; does that
count?" called a little girl dressed
in a bright pink Easter dress -one
of the many that had been sent by
a group of Stanford alumni women. 1
i The boys had all received new
blouses and the children who could j
not get up had been given Easter
baskets filled with bunnies and
chicks. Their beds had been !
wheeled out on the open sun porch
and they were all eagerly watch
ing the children who were hunting
; eggs.
Finally, with the assistance of
those who had hidden the eggs, j

| most of them were found, and the
prize, a great, big, real-looking
chicken, went to Juliet who had
found thirteen. All (he others re
ceived yellow Easter chicks.
Acting upon a few very-well-cov
ered hints, little Rose, who had
i found eleven eggs, ran up to the
porch where the "lied" children
were watching the "runabouts." She
let each child choose an egg, until
they were all gone. Then she ran
back to recover her hat, which she
had left with a startled co-ed, com
manding, "Here —mind this!"
Onlookers were given no peace,
i Requests of "Be a horsey" were
finally yielded to, and three Stan
lord women were soon running
around to the cries of "giddap"—
(but no "whoas.")
Other watchers curiously ques
tioned some of the children. When
asked if they saw tlie planes flying
Saturday, one small boy shouted,
j "My brother counted in the nine- !

I ties," ami others nodded affirma
i tively.
"Is she your mother?" asked an
other child, pointing to an embar
rassed Stanfordite who was carry
ing a small child. The infant em
phatically denied the charge, before
the "mother" had been given a
chance.
The "runabout" children had
been making Easter eggs in school
i and all of the white or red eggs
were ornamented with a large
block "S." Other indications of a
lively Stanford spirit were given
; when some of the children sang
"Come Join the Band."
"Happy Easter," "Come see us
again," and much hand-waving sent
the visitors away. Anyone is wel
, come at the home after 3 o'clock,
according to Mrs. Spandy, director.
Stanford will have a chance to see
the children during the drive to be
made May 7 !) for the Convalescent
! Home.
