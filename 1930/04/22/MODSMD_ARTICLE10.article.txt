# ENCINA CLOSED TO FRATERNITY MOBS BY SPONSORS' RULE
## 
### 
Instigated by the fraternity spon
sois, <>t whom there are fourteen, the
I tn ina Mall sponsors called a meeting
last night at which it was unanimous
1> decided* that the group was opposed
to any entrance into the hall by fra
ternity men during these last hours
of men's rushing. It was also agreed
to stop any wholesale entrance into
the hall like that which incurred last
year's violations.
Although this mobbing of the ball
by great numbers of fraternity men
which occurred last rushing season
was very open and above board, nev
ertheless it was ethically against all
rub sand regulations of the interfra
tcrnity agreement. "Ibis action taken
by the board of sponsors was taken
in hope of averting any similar ac
tion ihi.s -cason.
