### 
MINNEAPOLIS, April 17.
Engaged? "Well, she's ;im aw
fully nice kid," said John
Holmes, freshman ;il Hie Uni
versity of Minnesota, when lie
spoke of Dolores Salzar, dark
eyed Spanish dancer, whom
John's mother claims is on her
son's trail.
Mrs. Holmes quoted the
dancer as saying, "I'll follow
John to the ends of the earth."
She vigorously asserted that
she would never allow her son
to many at such an early age.
It all began when John was
a life guard at one of Hie
beaches in California, name
unpublished. "We were aw
fully good friends, but not too
intimate," he says.
John, according to Hie "Min
nesota Daily," found attend
ing classes far from pleasant,
and was almost certain that
the young lady was mistaken
if she thought she was going
to marry him.
