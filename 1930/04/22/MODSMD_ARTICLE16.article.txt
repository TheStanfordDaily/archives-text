j J death in i lie Ohio penitentiary here late today when fire swept a

died while penned in the old cell

went, into the prison at 7 o'clock.
Colonel llaubrick assumed charge
of the National Guard.
At 8 p.m., prisoners and guards
succeeded in getting into tier No.

found nothing but dead. The con
victs went to work dragging the
dead from the cells and passing
{hem down the tier steps. Other
bodies were lowered by ropes from
the windows. The prison yard now
was covered with dead and dying.
Most of the men brought from
this tier had met death by smoke.
A few were burned.
Firemen continue to labor on the
top of the G and H cell blocks.
The fire had practically died out
but much smoke still curled from
the ruins.

dying were on all sides and he ex
pressed the fear the death toll
would be even greater.
The flames continued to blaze
near the west gate at p.m.
tonight, Eastern standard lime.
Firemen drove them back a little,
but a stiff westerly wind fanned
tin; flames and drove them through
(i and 11 blocks, where some sixty
men were trapped, convicts and
guards and firemen were making
valiant efforts to get into these
blocks.
A company of regular army sol
diers reached the scene and were
assigned to duty on the main gate.
Prison officials said this heavy
guard Avas placed on the gate be
cause they feared some of Hie con
victs loose in the prison yard
would be driven insane by the ex
citement and mfght make a break
for liberty.
An Associated Press staff man
inside the walls counted ninety
bodies completely covered with
blankets as though dead. The floor
of (he hospital basement was cov
ered with men, many of them dead
or dying, and at least fifty were on
the floor of the main hospital, some
of them apparently lifeless. Physi
cians in white were working with
water-soaked handkerchiefs over
their noses so dense was the
smoke.
Miss Thomas, when asked for
an estimate of the number of dead,
replied "we have no idea."
