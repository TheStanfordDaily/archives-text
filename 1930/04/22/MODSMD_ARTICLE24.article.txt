# YOST DEPLORES SO-ED SMOKING
## Overstimulation, Smoking, And Noise Evils 
### 
" 'The new woman does not ask
others to emancipate her, but she
emancipates herself'," quoted Dean
Mary Yost in talking before Roble
Club last night. "During my trip East
I saw your group in comparison with
other similar groups. I realized that
Stanford gives her women the most
social freedom of all resident colleges
and, I shall be frank with you, I saw
that we have not solved many of the
resultant problems as well as some
other groups.
"A college living group is something
more and different than the sum of
the individuals living in it. Most of

our mistakes and problems come from
not realizing this. The two biggest
specific problems that you have to
j solve are the matters of noise, over
stimulation, and smoking. There is
too much carelessness shown toward
the prevention of fires that come from
smoking, not enough self control is
j being exercised in the number of ciga
rettes smoked, and many of you are
being hypocritical with your families
in the matter. Your hall is run by self
government; it is up to you to show
yourself capable of exercising this
privilege."
