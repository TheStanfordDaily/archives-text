# YOST DEPLORES SO-ED SMOKING
## Overstimulation, Smoking, And Noise Evils

j " 'The new woman does not ask
j others to emancipate her, but she
I emancipates herself'," quoted Dean
! Mary Yost in talking before Ruble
j ( lub last night. "During my trip East
I I saw your group in comparison with
j other similar groups. I realized that
I Stanford gives her women the most
| social freedom of all resident colleges
and, I shall be frank with you, I s&w
j that we have not solved many of the
i resultant problems as well as some
j other groups.
"A college living group is something
I more and different than the sum of
I the individuals living in it. Most of
i . ®
our mistakes and problems come from
j not realizing this. The two biggest
i specific problems that you have to
j solve are the matters of noise, over
stimulation, and smoking. There is
j too much carelessness shown toward
the prevention of (ires that come from
| smoking, not enough self control is
j being exercised in the number of ciga
j rettcs smoked, and many of you are
j being hypocritical with your families
in the matter. Your hall is run by self
government; it is up to you to show
j yourself capable of exercising this
! privilege."
