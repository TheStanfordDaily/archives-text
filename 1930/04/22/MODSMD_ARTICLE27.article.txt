# SENATE VOTES FOR STRINGENT IMMIGRANT BAN
## National Origins Basis Of Restriction Repealed By Count of 39 to 34 New Amendment Slashes 30,000 Off European Annual Immigration 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 21 (A').
I lie Senate today voted for repeal ol
the national origins basis for restric
tion of immigration which went into
effect last July 1.
An amendment by Senator Norbeck,
Republican, South Dakota, to the llai
ris immigration bill providing for re
peal of the national origins provision
and further restricting immigration
was approved by a vote ot 39 to .34.
President Hoover recommended rr
peal of the national origins provision
a year ago but Congress then refused
to act upon it.
I he hill by Senator Harris, Demo
crat, Georgia, proposing to apply quota
restrictions to immigrants from Cen
tral and South America, must still be
approved by the Senate and acted upon
by the House.
Under the Norbeck amendment, an
nual immigration from Kuropean
countries would be pared down from
150,000 to 120,000, but the old quota
basis allowing Germany and the Scan
dinavian countries a larger percentage
of the quotas would go back into ei
feet.
An ammendment bv Senator Allen,
Republican, Kansas, to provide for se
lective immigration by the United
States under the direction of four
cabinet officers, was defeated. The
vote was 11 to 55.
An amendment by Senator Black,
Democrat, Alabama, to bar all immi
gration for three years, beginning Jan
nary 1 next, also was defeated. The
vote was *37 to 29.
A substitute for the Harris measure,
offered by Senator Bingham, Rcpubli
can, Connecticut, and placing onh
Mexico of the 19 Pan-American coun
tries under the quota law, then was
rejected, 55 to 11.
The Bingham proposal would have
given Mexico a permanent quota of'
2,'>00 immigrants and two transitional
quotas of 11,021 and 6,901, respec
tively, for the next two fiscal years.
