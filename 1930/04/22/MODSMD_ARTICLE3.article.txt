# INSECT WARFARE BROUGHT AGAINST MOSQUITO HAZARD
## 
### 
Few of the mosquitoes now
plaguing the campus are local,
according to It. 10. Huckley, of
ficial appointee for mosquito
abatement on the University
grounds.
Collections made show a
majority of the marsh varie
ties with only one or two out
of forty common to those
which might breed here. These
few are those which arose be
fore the swamps in this lo
cality could be oiled, action
delayed by lale rains of the
season.
The Mosquito Abatement
Commission of this district,
which extends from San Fran
cisquito Creek to Mountain
View, is attempting control on
ibis side of the bay and will
be assisted next year with the
plowing up of marshes, al
ready oiled, to bo done by the
Alviso Salt Co.
Also next year a commis
sion already formed across the
bay will probably be with
funds to carry on a more ex
tensive campaign which will
somewhat benefit this district.
