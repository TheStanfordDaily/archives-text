# THE 						ODOR OF DEAD FISH
## 
### 
Meoause the Daily published the story of Toyon Club's vote
on the proposal to make Toyon 11 all exclusively a habitat for mem
hers «»f eating clubs, the opinion has been voiced in certain circles
lhat this newspaper is taking an unfair, unjust, discriminatory |
(etc.) stand.
Such an opinion is hard to understand when the Daily did
nothing more than publish a legitimate piece of campus news —the i
purpose of this newspaper is, after all, 1o do just that.
And, ii might be added, the Daily intends to go on doing just [
that.
If proponents of the proposal desired no publicity they should!
have been secretive enough to insure themselves against it. When
a thing becomes news, it follows naturally that the thing will be |
treated as such bv newspapers.
I'.efore complaints are uttered there should be something of
which to complain. I'eople who mouth empty charges have minds j
a small as their accusations.
Ilehind the whole thing lingers the odor of that antique dead i
Ii h, the so-called I lall-Wow division. In that connection the Daily I
Vv'ill again point out that it is neither "llaii" nor "Row." It is a
Stanford I niversity publication, and functions as such.
The Daily has lambasted fraternities and the Interfraternity
< ouncil ; ii has that same right (and intends to exercise that right |
n the occasion arises) in important matters concerning the mvthical
"I fall" element.
As a matter of fact, the Daily believes that the present plan is j
one for the men involved to decide as they see lit. The club men <
and the uon club men are the only one who will be affected.
If there remain any of those who believe that a newspaper's
publication of news lias worked an injustice, they will lind the I
' 'ampus ()piuion column of the Daily open to them.
