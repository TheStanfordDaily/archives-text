THE NEW MOON—At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.
Once or twice in a lifetime you
see u show which has that rare '
thing called magic. You never lor- j
get it.
"The New Moon" lias this magic :
—a quality very hard to describe,
yet l'fli in every scene, and heard !
in every song in this glamorous and !
charming musical comedy. A magi
cal voice—that of Perry Askam's
singing melodies like "Lover Come
Back To Me," and "Marianne" —
and settings of magical beauty—the !
open deck of the good ship New !
Moon in late afternoon, or the !
stately charm of the grand salon !
of New Orleans French mansion—
give the show this quality perhaps, i
Hul every detail of the skilfully j
integrated succession of marvelous j
songs and superbly trained chor- I
uses that move on and off the stage j
so swiftly anil smoothly also has j
its part in building up to this ef- ;
feet. You leave the theatre in a j
kind of glow with the splendid j
rhythm of "Stout Hearted Men," •
"The New Moon's" most stirring i
piece, still pounding in your ears!
ami I lie magnet ism of Perry Askam j
si ill before your eyes.
"Magnificent" applies to Perry j
Askam's voice and appearance, I
both with equal aptness. His voice j
in richness and trueness is almost, j
more than a musical comedy dei
serves. He is utterly sure that his j
audience is at his l'eet. adoring him j
every moment. Hul why shouldn't |
he be? That is exactly where the |
audience is—and it. never misses I
an opportunity to let Askam know j
it.
Josephine Houston, the leading i
lady, with the fragile delicate beau- j
ty of a cameo, has a little difficulty i
in being as haughty as the spirited ;
scenes of her role demand (the |
scene in which she orders her j
lover to be thrashed, for instance) j
hut. her voice never disappoints." i
"The New Moon's" dramatic ac
tion moves along the romantic
grooves of love, courage, and ad
venture proscribed by musical
comedy convention —gloriously im
possible, of course, but excellent ,
entertainment. The idea of a ship \
lull of sailors and a. cargo of mar
riageable maids provides an extra- j
ordinarily good medium for gay,
clever chorus work, with choice in
terludes of nonsense contributed :
by the comedian, Charles Boyle,
who, together with the villain, is
responsible for the best pieces of
acting in the production.

| LADIES OF LEISURE—At the
New Stanford.
"Lailies of Leisure" i.s one of the
I most satisfying movies of iliis
! year.
Perhaps tlie outstanding feature
jof tin* picture is the clever dia
i logue. Lowell Sherman and Mario
j Prevost prove themselves thor
oughly capable of handling this
banter.
Ralph Graves is better than usual
j and Barbara Stanwyck exception
j ally pleasing.
| The plot is thoroughly ordinary
i but is saved by the refreshing di
j rection. Even the inevitable mo
' ment when the socially elect
| mother begs the misunderstood
J model to nobly surrender the dar
| ling of both their hearts is half
j convincing.
j "THE BISHOP MURDER CASE"—
At the Varsity Theatre, Palo
Alto.
| Philo Vance is in town again,
i suave and sophisticated, in the
j person of Basil Hath hone. "The
| Bishop Murder Case" finds the
I famous detective faced with a still
j more puzzling set of murders than
j ever before in his career. The plot.
|is replete with thrills and horror
| and eccentric characters, but it
I lacks tiie logic of the book. The
j east is well-chosen hut a few of the
I minor characters, notably Pardee
j and Drucker, are overdrawn and
'detract from the realism of the
j picture, though they lend to its
; weird terror.
| Those who read the original S. S.
Van Dine novel will perhaps be a
i little disappointed in the picture.
The psychological motive for the
murders, as explained in the book
by Vance, is entirely omitted. Per
haps too long speeches are taboo
!in the talkies, but several loose
'ends are left dangling as a result.
The substitution of Hathbone for
William Powell as Vance is to be
| deplored for it destroys the con
tinuity of the series of pictures,
but the role is well done. Sergeant
Heath and Mrs. Drukker in par
titular are excellently portrayed,
and the settings are all that could
i be desired for a "mystery thriller."
On the whole, the picture is one
of tiie best of its type thus far pro
duced. The story is unique and
well worked out. Suspicion shifts
to each member of the cast in turn,
but the real murderer is a total
surprise as the plot unfolds. Do not
miss it.

thing called magic. You never lor- j
get it.
"The New Moon" lias this magic :
—a quality very hard to describe,
yet l'fli in every scene, and heard !
in every song in this glamorous and !
charming musical comedy. A magi
cal voice—that of Perry Askam's
singing melodies like "Lover Come
Back To Me," and "Marianne" —
and settings of magical beauty—the !
open deck of the good ship New !
Moon in late afternoon, or the !
stately charm of the grand salon !
of New Orleans French mansion—
give the show this quality perhaps, i
Hul every detail of the skilfully j
integrated succession of marvelous j
songs and superbly trained chor- I
uses that move on and off the stage j
so swiftly anil smoothly also has j
its part in building up to this ef- ;
feet. You leave the theatre in a j
kind of glow with the splendid j
rhythm of "Stout Hearted Men," •
"The New Moon's" most stirring i
piece, still pounding in your ears!
ami I lie magnet ism of Perry Askam j
si ill before your eyes.
"Magnificent" applies to Perry j
Askam's voice and appearance, I
both with equal aptness. His voice j
in richness and trueness is almost, j
more than a musical comedy dei
serves. He is utterly sure that his j
audience is at his l'eet. adoring him j

j "THE BISHOP MURDER CASE"—
At the Varsity Theatre, Palo
Alto.
| Philo Vance is in town again,
i suave and sophisticated, in the
j person of Basil Hath hone. "The
| Bishop Murder Case" finds the
I famous detective faced with a still
j more puzzling set of murders than
j ever before in his career. The plot.
|is replete with thrills and horror
| and eccentric characters, but it
I lacks tiie logic of the book. The
j east is well-chosen hut a few of the
I minor characters, notably Pardee
j and Drucker, are overdrawn and
'detract from the realism of the
j picture, though they lend to its
; weird terror.
| Those who read the original S. S.
Van Dine novel will perhaps be a
i little disappointed in the picture.
The psychological motive for the
murders, as explained in the book
by Vance, is entirely omitted. Per
haps too long speeches are taboo
!in the talkies, but several loose
'ends are left dangling as a result.
The substitution of Hathbone for
William Powell as Vance is to be
| deplored for it destroys the con
tinuity of the series of pictures,
but the role is well done. Sergeant
Heath and Mrs. Drukker in par
titular are excellently portrayed,
and the settings are all that could
i be desired for a "mystery thriller."
On the whole, the picture is one
of tiie best of its type thus far pro
duced. The story is unique and
well worked out. Suspicion shifts
to each member of the cast in turn,
but the real murderer is a total
surprise as the plot unfolds. Do not
miss it.
THE NEW MOON—At the Curran
Theatre, San Francisco.
Once or twice in a lifetime you
see u show which has that rare '
thing called magic. You never lor- j
get it.
"The New Moon" lias this magic :
—a quality very hard to describe,
yet l'fli in every scene, and heard !
in every song in this glamorous and !
charming musical comedy. A magi
cal voice—that of Perry Askam's
singing melodies like "Lover Come
Back To Me," and "Marianne" —
and settings of magical beauty—the !
open deck of the good ship New !
Moon in late afternoon, or the !
stately charm of the grand salon !
of New Orleans French mansion—
give the show this quality perhaps, i
Hul every detail of the skilfully j
integrated succession of marvelous j
songs and superbly trained chor- I
uses that move on and off the stage j
so swiftly anil smoothly also has j
its part in building up to this ef- ;
feet. You leave the theatre in a j
kind of glow with the splendid j
rhythm of "Stout Hearted Men," •
"The New Moon's" most stirring i
piece, still pounding in your ears!
ami I lie magnet ism of Perry Askam j
si ill before your eyes.
"Magnificent" applies to Perry j
Askam's voice and appearance, I
both with equal aptness. His voice j
in richness and trueness is almost, j
more than a musical comedy dei
serves. He is utterly sure that his j
audience is at his l'eet. adoring him j
every moment. Hul why shouldn't |
he be? That is exactly where the |
audience is—and it. never misses I
an opportunity to let Askam know j
it.
Josephine Houston, the leading i
lady, with the fragile delicate beau- j
ty of a cameo, has a little difficulty i
in being as haughty as the spirited ;
scenes of her role demand (the |
scene in which she orders her j
lover to be thrashed, for instance) j
hut. her voice never disappoints." i
"The New Moon's" dramatic ac
tion moves along the romantic
grooves of love, courage, and ad
venture proscribed by musical
comedy convention —gloriously im
possible, of course, but excellent ,
entertainment. The idea of a ship \
lull of sailors and a. cargo of mar
riageable maids provides an extra- j
ordinarily good medium for gay,
clever chorus work, with choice in
terludes of nonsense contributed :
by the comedian, Charles Boyle,
who, together with the villain, is
responsible for the best pieces of
acting in the production.
