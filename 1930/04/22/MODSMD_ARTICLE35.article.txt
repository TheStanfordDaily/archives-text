# Campus Opinion
## A 						QUESTION OF PANTS 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last December some bright-eyed
individual felt, called upon to let
ihe world know that. Stanford was
more or less in the hands of the
female of the species. Consequent
ly, the following contribution to
"Time":
"Upon the Stanford campus wo
men swarm." Whoops . . . "The
Stanford Employment Office and
Dining Halt system are chiefed and
staffed by women . . . and in every
nook and cranny of Stanford, wo
men secretaries write, type, talk,
and phone."
What the author of the above
piece of feminine propaganda for
get. to add was that. most, of the
offices now being run by women
in this University, are in rather
bad shape. Witness t lie Union and
Encina dining halls, the Dean of
Men's office, and the appointment
office.
And now we have a bid for the
honors of asininity from another
source, lint let nie quote more from
"Time." "At the head of all is a
most remarkable superwoman, Miss
Helen Ella True, 'de jure' Secre
tary to the President, but 'de facto' i
President of Stanford in the ab
sence of Dr. Wilbur. . . . She knows
instantly every well of informa
tion that affects or may affect the ;
University. Is there an unwise
movement developing in the stu
dent. body? She touches invisible
button number one and the matter
ends. Does a faculty member spon
sor a doubtful local issue? Invisi
ble button number two avoids the
difficulty . . . then work is n tri
umph for mankind."
Miss True became quite thor
oughly riled last Thursday when
some tolerant young Christian gen
tlemen came into the President's ,
office and said that those horrid <
old hoys over in Toyoii were giv- *
inK a dance 011 Good Friday. "Hor
rors," quoth Miss True, "there is
one button that I forgot to push";
and in lieu of a back fence sh<' im
mediately ran across to Dean Mary
Yost's office and between the two
of them it was decided that the
dance would jus! have to he called
off.
It made no difference to them
that some one hundred couples
cared not a whit whether it was
Good Friday or not, that an orclies- j
tra had been hired, all arrange
ments made, and several other odd
things done that are simply not
changed in a day.
But did they .succeed in calling
off the dance? Not by a long shot,
sonny boy, for they raise virile men
over there in Toyon who are not
to hi- bluffed I»V people who d<t loVe

to push those cute little buttons.
Dean Mary and Miss True found
that it is a far cry from dictating
to Stanford's somewhat servile
womanhood and trying to tell sohip
of lhe men what, they should do.
The upshot of it all was that Doc
tor Swain returned to the; campus
Friday morning and decided the
issue fairly and squarely. Toyon
had its dance all right and Toyon
men give thanks not especially that
the dance was held hut that there
was somebody on this campus big
enough and broad-minded enough
to understand that circumstances
do change all things.
The moral of this dissertation is
the age-old piece of wisdom that
the men are supposed to wear the
pant.s. Thanks, —M. A. F.

most remarkable superwoman, Miss
Helen Ella True, 'de jure' Secre
tary to the President, but 'de facto' i
President of Stanford in the ab
sence of Dr. Wilbur. . . . She knows
instantly every well of informa
tion that affects or may affect the ;
University. Is there an unwise
movement developing in the stu
dent. body? She touches invisible
button number one and the matter
ends. Does a faculty member spon
sor a doubtful local issue? Invisi
ble button number two avoids the
difficulty . . . then work is n tri
umph for mankind."
Miss True became quite thor
oughly riled last Thursday when
some tolerant young Christian gen
tlemen came into the President's ,
office and said that those horrid <
old hoys over in Toyoii were giv- *
inK a dance 011 Good Friday. "Hor
rors," quoth Miss True, "there is
one button that I forgot to push";
and in lieu of a back fence sh<' im
mediately ran across to Dean Mary
Yost's office and between the two
of them it was decided that the
dance would jus! have to he called
off.
It made no difference to them
that some one hundred couples
cared not a whit whether it was
Good Friday or not, that an orclies- j
tra had been hired, all arrange
ments made, and several other odd
things done that are simply not
changed in a day.
But did they .succeed in calling
off the dance? Not by a long shot,
sonny boy, for they raise virile men
over there in Toyon who are not
to hi- bluffed I»V people who d<t loVe

to push those cute little buttons.
Dean Mary and Miss True found
that it is a far cry from dictating
to Stanford's somewhat servile
womanhood and trying to tell sohip
of lhe men what, they should do.
The upshot of it all was that Doc
tor Swain returned to the; campus
Friday morning and decided the
issue fairly and squarely. Toyon
had its dance all right and Toyon
men give thanks not especially that
the dance was held hut that there
was somebody on this campus big
enough and broad-minded enough
to understand that circumstances
do change all things.
The moral of this dissertation is
the age-old piece of wisdom that
the men are supposed to wear the
pant.s. Thanks, —M. A. F.
The Editor, Sir:
Last December some bright-eyed
individual felt, called upon to let
ihe world know that. Stanford was
more or less in the hands of the
female of the species. Consequent
ly, the following contribution to
"Time":
"Upon the Stanford campus wo
men swarm." Whoops . . . "The
Stanford Employment Office and
Dining Halt system are chiefed and
staffed by women . . . and in every
nook and cranny of Stanford, wo
men secretaries write, type, talk,
and phone."
What the author of the above
piece of feminine propaganda for
get. to add was that. most, of the
offices now being run by women
in this University, are in rather
bad shape. Witness t lie Union and
Encina dining halls, the Dean of
Men's office, and the appointment
office.
And now we have a bid for the
honors of asininity from another
source, lint let nie quote more from
"Time." "At the head of all is a
