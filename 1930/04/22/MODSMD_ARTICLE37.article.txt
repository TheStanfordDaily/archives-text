# FARCICAL ELECTION!
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Toyon Club is holding a farcical
election which deserves the critical
attention of the administration as
well as that of all the hall men.
The object of this burlesque is to
determine whether or not the mem
hers of Toyon Club wish to hand
their hall over to the eating clubs.
Because of the fact that the ma
jority of those eligible to vote art
eating club members the election
is even now predestined to suc
cess for the seven eating clubs.
If the administration O.K.'s the
results of this election if is doing
an injustice to all hall men who
are not members of these altruistic
organizations. Under the none too
subtle veil of desiring "to improve
the democratic hall spirit," these
clubs are seeking immediate room
lights for all of their members,
present and future. If Stanford bad
sufficient dormitory facilities to
house all non-fraternity men such
a plan would perhaps be feasible;
at present, however, there are only
a fraction who are fortunate
enough to get into the desirable
balls, Toyon and Rranner. If this
plan goes through, the non club

| men, Toyon !»«• iiix (Closed to them,
(will have. lo wait even longer than
they now do for their room rights.
I Let tlie Administration, if it
: wishes to discriminate against the
I hall men who are unwilling for
i financial or personal reasons to
join the eating, clubs, or who are
j unwanted by them, validate the ie
suits of Toyon's election. Such a
J move would not only he successful
Ily discriminate hut il would ult
imately change the present ynited
spirit among hall men to one of
factional rivalry among eating clnh
[and non eating club members.
