The theme of the Blighted Bud,
or Love's Young Dream turned
into a nightmare, is a common one
! among our brothers, the Serious
| Poets. Now a Funny Man is not
! supposed to have an aching heart
land a busted lute; but just take a
peep at these heart-rending hits
of blubbering ('member "Laugh,
, Clown, Laugh'*?):
TO THE COLLEAGUE OF
A BANKRUPT ENTERPRISE
I
I Hand in hand, with chilbd sus
pense impending
We mark the death-flame of an
other sun,
Children both, so stupidly pretend
ing
That what is over with has Jiiml
begun.
.
Side by -side, we harbor from each
other
What we within ourselves cannot
conceal;
' I am I, and you are not another: |

Hut what of that? Are not your
kisses real?
—2—
| Heaping moist tributes on a dead
love's grave,
I walk sequestered ways, to weep ;
alone;
j To mind myself of all the wounds
you gave,
j Ami turn my heart into a block
of stone.
Thus always is the battle's after-'
ma th;
| But do not feel puffed up because
I cried.
Achilles sulking by himself iu
wrath '
( Grieved not for Brjjseis, but for
injured pride.
—Darrell Amyx.
