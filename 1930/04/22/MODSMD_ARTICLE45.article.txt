Shed a tear for "Podge" Smith,
curly-haired timber topper of the
Cardinal track squad. For Podge's
1 roubles are just beginning.
Stepping into tlie shoes of lilt- long
!iiu* of superb Stanford hurdlers start
ing with l.auc Falk and including
"Swede" l.cistner, Ross Nichols, ami
Ward Edmonds, Podge at the start of
the season found himself faced with
the stijTcst competition ever met by
any of the hierarchy of Cardinal har
rier men.
And against these prominent
rivals Templeton's frail hurdler
has acquitted himself with great
est honor. Meeting L. A. A. C.'s
triple threat of Pomeroy, Max
well, and Grumbles, Podge walked
off with a double win, although
not without being given a stiff
battle by these former college
champions. One week later Smith
added three more scalps to his col
lection, capturing two firsts from
the Olympic Club's classy hurd
ling trio, Kaster, Edwards, and
Edmonds.
In a bad slum]) at the start of spring
quarter, Podge uevcrtF less battled to
a tie in tin- high sticks with Jeddy
Welch, Southern California's great
iinport and conqueror of Captain Al
phonse Pogolotti. One week Smith,
alter taking a poor third in the high
hurdles, came back in the low sticks
to-give Pogolotti the race of his life,
tying the California captain jn the
excellent time of 24.6 seconds.
But truly there is no rest for the
wicked. For this Saturday Podge
meets the toughest assignment of
his hurdling career when he runs
against Steve Anderson, great
speedster of the Husky squad. We
have it on good authority that the
Card hurdling hope does NOT put
himself to sleep by counting sheep
jumping over a fence.
Seven days elapse, and Podge once
again finds himself lined up beside
California's Captain Pogolotti for an
other double duel in the P.A.A. meet
at Kezar stadium. Then a week of
grace, and on May 15 and 16 the
blond hurdler has both Pogolotti and
Welch on his hands in the •California
Intercollcgiates to be held on tin-
Stanford oval.
Hostilities come to an end for
Podge at the 1.C.4-A. get-together
on May 31 with only Pogolotti,
Welch, and the best of the Eastern
hurdlers to be met. After that
Podge can hang up his spikes for
a year and spend the interim jump
ing over fences.
