# Card Track Men To Meet Huskies
## WASHINGTON TEAM WILL APPEAR HERE IN SATURDAY FRAY Anderson, Kiser, Jessup Chief Luminaries of Seattle Outfit 
### Bob Van Etten 
With California scaips once again
tucked neatly under their belts, Mr.
Robert l.yinan Templeton's coterie of
track and field luminaries will devote ,
this week preparing for the little so
cial call to be made at the Stanford
stadium Saturday afternoon by the
Washington Huskies.
Not that Coach Edmundson's I'.V.D. j
battalion are traveling all the way |
down from Seattle just to pour tea :
for the Cardinal trackmen. In fact,
reports emanating from the Husky j
campus would indicate that "Dink's"
boys may have something of a battle
i.ii their hands to walk off with the j
majority of points.
Of the Washington performers sev- !
era I have attained national renown in
past seasons, and there is no reason to
believe that the abilities of these men
have in any way slackened this year.
In fact, with the .first glimmerings of
spring finally appearing about the
green fields of the damp northland,
the Huskies have emerged from their i
indoor oval into open air with results |
most encouraging to their Washington j
supporters.
Anderson Best
Hard-worked Podge Smith meets
perhaps the greatest hurdler in the j
country in the person of "Steppin"'!
Steve Anderson, N.C.A. champion of j
1929, who runs the high sticks in less j
than 15 flat and cuts under 24 seconds !
in the low barriers. The great Ander- !
son is well supported in the 220-yard j
race by Whiting, who tied Pogolotti j
when the Bears and Huskies clashed i
at Seattle.
Completing the long list of way
above-avcrage milers against whom
Bob Brown has had to run all season,
Washington presents Mr. Rufus Kiser,
distance man par excellence, who cov
ers the four laps in 4:19 on an indoor
track, and one Mr. Rhuddv, who has
a well-established habit of placing a
close second to Mr. Kiser, a feat
which he accomplished even when
competing against "Iron Man" Moss
man of the nearby institution at Ber- ,
keley. Should Brown manage to break
into this combination he will deserve
all the credit he gets.
Jessup Puts Shot
Offering the Stanford weight twins,
Captain Eric Krenz and Harlow Ro
thert, their first real competition since 1
the L.A.A.C. meet, Coach Edmundson
will bring along Paul Jessup, 6 foot
8 giant who frequently tosses the shot
beyond the 50-foot mark. Jessup is
even more dangerous in the discus,
where his 150-odd-foot throws appear
very likely to cut the Cards out of
their customary second place in the
event which Captain Krenz likes best
next to the shotput.
While welcoming Mr. Jessup as a
good fellow and a worthy opponent,
Captain Krenz and Mr. Rothcrt
would hardly burst into unrestrained
weeping should the Washington giant
sprain a thumb or something and be j
unable to make the trip. This unchar- ;
itable attitude results not from any i
desire to rest from their labors, but |
because the Cardinal weight man J
would he deeply interested in compct- (
ing in the Fresno relays Saturday j
light.
Fresno Offers Refused
Offers have been made by the offi
•ials handling the Fresno West Coast I
Relays to transport the entire Stan
ford and Washington track teams to
he southern city by airplane, follow-j
ng their dual affair, in order that
he\ might offer additional competi
ion to the three-cornered battle i
unong California, U.S.C., and the j
Olympic Club. These offers have been !
"cfused by those controlling the des
tinies of both track squads, since ob
viously one hard meet a day is enough
lor almost any track man.
However, an offer of transportation
s still open to any of the individual !

| Stanford track stars who wish to take
a shot at competing twice in less than
i six lmnrs. Both C aptain Kretiz and
Mr. Rothcrt are among those who
look upon this proposition in a very
kindly light. Hence the gripe at Jes
i sup's prowess; for if forced to ex
tend themselves against the Husky
weight man the Cardinal duo may not
i feel quite capable of again taking
down the line the Trojan jaw-setting
| tooth-grinder Hob Hall.

Steve Anderson, N.C.A. champion of j
1929, who runs the high sticks in less j
than 15 flat and cuts under 24 seconds !
in the low barriers. The great Ander- !
son is well supported in the 220-yard j
race by Whiting, who tied Pogolotti j
when the Bears and Huskies clashed i
at Seattle.
Completing the long list of way
above-avcrage milers against whom
Bob Brown has had to run all season,
Washington presents Mr. Rufus Kiser,
distance man par excellence, who cov
ers the four laps in 4:19 on an indoor
track, and one Mr. Rhuddv, who has
a well-established habit of placing a
close second to Mr. Kiser, a feat
which he accomplished even when
competing against "Iron Man" Moss
man of the nearby institution at Ber- ,
keley. Should Brown manage to break
into this combination he will deserve
all the credit he gets.
Jessup Puts Shot
Offering the Stanford weight twins,
Captain Eric Krenz and Harlow Ro
thert, their first real competition since 1
the L.A.A.C. meet, Coach Edmundson
will bring along Paul Jessup, 6 foot
8 giant who frequently tosses the shot
beyond the 50-foot mark. Jessup is
even more dangerous in the discus,
where his 150-odd-foot throws appear
very likely to cut the Cards out of
their customary second place in the
event which Captain Krenz likes best
next to the shotput.
While welcoming Mr. Jessup as a
good fellow and a worthy opponent,
Captain Krenz and Mr. Rothcrt
would hardly burst into unrestrained
weeping should the Washington giant
sprain a thumb or something and be j
unable to make the trip. This unchar- ;
itable attitude results not from any i
desire to rest from their labors, but |
because the Cardinal weight man J
would he deeply interested in compct- (
ing in the Fresno relays Saturday j

unong California, U.S.C., and the j
Olympic Club. These offers have been !
"cfused by those controlling the des
tinies of both track squads, since ob
viously one hard meet a day is enough
lor almost any track man.
However, an offer of transportation
s still open to any of the individual !

| Stanford track stars who wish to take
a shot at competing twice in less than
i six lmnrs. Both C aptain Kretiz and
Mr. Rothcrt are among those who
look upon this proposition in a very
kindly light. Hence the gripe at Jes
i sup's prowess; for if forced to ex
tend themselves against the Husky
weight man the Cardinal duo may not
i feel quite capable of again taking
down the line the Trojan jaw-setting
| tooth-grinder Hob Hall.
With California scaips once again
tucked neatly under their belts, Mr.
Robert l.yinan Templeton's coterie of
track and field luminaries will devote ,
this week preparing for the little so
cial call to be made at the Stanford
stadium Saturday afternoon by the
Washington Huskies.
Not that Coach Edmundson's I'.V.D. j
battalion are traveling all the way |
down from Seattle just to pour tea :
for the Cardinal trackmen. In fact,
reports emanating from the Husky j
campus would indicate that "Dink's"
boys may have something of a battle
i.ii their hands to walk off with the j

Of the Washington performers sev- !

believe that the abilities of these men
have in any way slackened this year.
In fact, with the .first glimmerings of

beyond the 50-foot mark. Jessup is
even more dangerous in the discus,
where his 150-odd-foot throws appear
very likely to cut the Cards out of
their customary second place in the
event which Captain Krenz likes best
next to the shotput.
While welcoming Mr. Jessup as a
good fellow and a worthy opponent,
Captain Krenz and Mr. Rothcrt
would hardly burst into unrestrained
weeping should the Washington giant
sprain a thumb or something and be j
unable to make the trip. This unchar- ;
itable attitude results not from any i
desire to rest from their labors, but |
because the Cardinal weight man J

Fresno Offers Refused
Offers have been made by the offi
•ials handling the Fresno West Coast I
Relays to transport the entire Stan
ford and Washington track teams to
he southern city by airplane, follow-j
ng their dual affair, in order that
he\ might offer additional competi
ion to the three-cornered battle i
unong California, U.S.C., and the j
Olympic Club. These offers have been !
"cfused by those controlling the des
tinies of both track squads, since ob
viously one hard meet a day is enough
lor almost any track man.
However, an offer of transportation
s still open to any of the individual !

| Stanford track stars who wish to take
a shot at competing twice in less than
i six lmnrs. Both C aptain Kretiz and
Mr. Rothcrt are among those who
look upon this proposition in a very
kindly light. Hence the gripe at Jes
i sup's prowess; for if forced to ex
tend themselves against the Husky
weight man the Cardinal duo may not
i feel quite capable of again taking
down the line the Trojan jaw-setting
