# MORE WORLDS TO CONQUER
## Helen Wills Moody and Bobby Jones; Which of These Flashes Will Be Uncle Sam's Greater Champion 
### Feg Murray,'16 
j Who will win the more titles,
Helen Wills Moody or Bobby
Jones? So far, the little lady from
Berkeley is three up on the gentle
j man from Atlanta, Georgia, sub,
I but some day the Queen of Tennis
j is going to find that the cares and
| duties of being a wife and mother
I will interfere with winning tourna
■ ments, and though she will prob
ably still be playing and winning
! twenty years from now, so, too,
| will Emperor Jones, and there are
| likely to be many more young net
I stars who will come up in that
i time who can beat Mrs. Moody that
j there are golfers who can defeat
I the wizard of Atlanta. But if I'm
wrong, don't sue me, for Mrs.
Bundy and Mrs. Wightman have
kept up their tennis remarkably
over two decades. But so have
golfers like John Ball, Jr., who won
i the British amateur in 1888 and
also in 1912, and J. H. Taylor,
1 Harry Vardon, and Sandy Herd,
whose stretch of professional vic
tories covers nearly a third of a
century.

This tabulation does not take
into consideration Walker Cup or
Wightman Cup competition, or
minor tournaments, which, perhaps,
just fall shy of being as classy as
a national open or amateur cham
pionship. The golfer lias four major
crowns to shoot at each year, if
you don't count the French tourna
ments as major ones. The tennis
player, even including the French
hard court championship, has only
three major titles to go after in
one year. There was no Olympic
.tennis in 1928.
Helen won the U.S. singles cham
pionship in 1923, '24, '25, '27, '28,
and '29, and probably would have
A\on in *2(1 had not illness forced
her to remain out of the competi
tion. She won the last three Wim
bledon championships, 1927, '2S,
and '29, the last two French, and
the Olympic title in 1924.
Bobby won the U.S. amateur
championship in 1924, '25, '27, and
'28. He won the U.S. open in 1923,
'2(!, and '29, and the British open
in 1926 and 1927. Besides this he
was runner-up in the U.S. amateur
in 1926, and lost the U.S. open
crown after a playoff in 1925 and
1929. Helen Wills was runner-up in
the I'.S. singles in 1922.

Bobby won the U.S. amateur
championship in 1924, '25, '27, and
'28. He won the U.S. open in 1923,

was runner-up in the U.S. amateur
in 1926, and lost the U.S. open
crown after a playoff in 1925 and
1929. Helen Wills was runner-up in
the I'.S. singles in 1922.
