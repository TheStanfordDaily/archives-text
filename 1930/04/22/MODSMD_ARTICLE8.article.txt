# TOYON VOTES ON NEW HALL PLAN TONIGHT
## Independent Occupants Of Dormitory Not To Be Disturbed, Dutton Plan To Go Into Effect At Start Of Fall Quarter 
### 
Declaring that the new, Toyon I
Hall plan had been "wilfully mis- i
represented," proponents united
last night to clarify the issues in
volved.
"There is absolutely no intention I
of taking away the rights of inde- j
pendent men now living in Toyon," |
declared Fletcher Button, president j
of Toyon Hall. "Independents will {
retain their individual room rights
until .graduation."
"The rather small attempt to di- I
vide hall men on this issue is j
doomed to deserved failure," added 1
tiurnell Gould, one of the sponsors ;
of the plan which was officially \
drawn up last quarter by Temple- j
ton Peck, former editor of the i
Daily. j
"Club men and independents are j
not at odds," declared Gould. I
"There is no treason why they
should be. The proposal that the
seven eating clubs take over Toyon
is a progressive step in the tradi- j
tion of the halls to maintain a J
democratic spirit at. Stanford."
Facts revealed last night show j
that Breakers, El Campo, Los j
Areos, 131 Capital!, and El Cuadro I
voted unanimously for the new j
measure. El Tigre gave a 3 to I <
majority for (.he plan, and El Toro's I
vote was favorable, 4 to 1.
Approved by the administration j
and the clubs, the Toyon Hall plan j
is scheduled to go into effect with j
new room rights for the autumn
quarter. Toyon Club will vote to- j
night on the proposal from 7 to i
10:30, though the decision will not j
constitute an official determina- |
tion.
