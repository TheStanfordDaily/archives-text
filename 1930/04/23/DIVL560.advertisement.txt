A PRICELESS GIFT
FOR YOU
Sometimes an extra few minutes seem as an hour, particularly
when there is someone ill or in pain. We have all had that
experience at times. At such times, "Service" is "A Priceless
Gift." How many times you have been willing to pay most
anything if he "would only hurry with the medicine," or per- j
haps it was only a package of razor blades or a box of face
powder?
Our Special Delivery Service has eliminated the necessity of
that worry and anxiety. It is a priceless gift to you. We appre
ciate your order whether large or small. We deliver to the
Campus, Free, from 8 A.M. to 9 P.M.
