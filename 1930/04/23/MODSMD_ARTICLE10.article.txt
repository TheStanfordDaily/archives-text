j Ihe signing of the treaty was en
acted under mellow sunshine which
j streamed through the four tall win
clows of (Jucen Anne's drawing room
iof old Si. James' I'alace. English
springtime had replaced the fogs of
January, prevailing when the coniVr
; ence opened, and outside the palace

in the disarmament movement was
quietly announced by Prime .Minister
Mac Donald, the chairman, who stood
in front of Ihe great red .chair at the
center of the conference table and
I said:
"We have now reached ihe moment
for signing the treaty."
Then Colonel Stimson as head of
the American delegation, first, as sign
ing was in alphabetical order, walked
to the table, sealed himself across
from Mr. Mac Donald, and dipped his
slender golden pen into a silver inkpot
of (Jueen Anne's time. Boldly he
wrote "Henry L. Stimson'' opposite
die first seal, from which a blue
ribbon ran through a long row of
similar spots of wax. Each signature
was Idled in opposite the individual
seal of the delegate signing. The other
Americans followed, making no nour
ishes byt signing in simple, legible
autographs: Charles <â€¢. Dawes,
Charles F. Adams, Joseph T. Rob
inson, David A. Reed, I lugh Gibson,
and Dwight \\ . Morrow.
