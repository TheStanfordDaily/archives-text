### BY RAWSON HOLMES 
Optimism characterizes the alti
tude of Professor Yatnalo Ichi
haahi, History, toward the. results
of the Loudon Naval Conference
which wound up its fourteen weeks'
session yesterday with the signing
of a treaty limiting and reducing
the three greatest navies of the
world and restricting the action ol
the two next in importance.
"Imperfect as (In* treaty may be,
I can not but feel optimistic, in re
gard to the achievements of the
Conference, taken as a whole,"
Professor Ichiliashi declared. "It
is a definite step forward from the
Washington Treaty, in that it not
only extends the 'naval holiday'
during which no new capital ships
may he built for live years, but it
means the scrapping of nine of
those existing at the present time,
and definite limitation in all other
categories of the naval strength of
the I'nited States, Great Britain,
and Japan."
"Along with limitation, 1 see the
sign of the restoration of the good

feeling between the United States
j end Great Mritain, whieh was so
t sadly ruptured at the Geneva Con
ference," the professor continued.
I "The same may be said of there
I lations between the two powers and
(Japan. After all, international good
feeling is the goal lying at the
; foundation of all attempts at dis
a rma ,".i cut.
"The tragic part of the confer
ence was the complete failure of
Italy and France to come to an
i agreement, except in regard to the
huinanization of submarines. The
moral effect of this misfortune can
not fail to he detrimental to the
i two countries concerned. It. is also
1 n source of anxiety to Great
Britain, since she is esentially. a
Kuropean power."
A more complete evaluation of
the achievements of the conference
by Professor Ichiliashi, who was
the confidential secretary to the
Japanese senior delegate at the
Washington Conference, will ap
pear, after study of the contents
of the treaty, in tomorrow's Daily.
