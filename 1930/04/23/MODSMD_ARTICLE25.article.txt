# COME ONE, COME ALL, AND BRING $5.00

Yesterday morning's Daily spurned "Ihe working man's paper"
.-'IkI turned "capitalistic" when it carried the first of its perennial
societv columns —a provisional list of candidates for June gradu
ation. \o clii|tie was catered to, unless one might call the Economics
Department a clique with all its future prominent bond salesmen,
in case anyone should luirl the charge of "Row vs. 11 rill" favoritism
ii is pointed out that special care was taken to print all the names
in alphabetical order.
When the I'niversity gives its annual party in the. Memorial
( hurcli the morning of June 17, it hopes to have as many seniors
present as possible, for the more graduates, the greater number of
future wealthy alumni who might possibly be interested in a New
I heater, a new dormitory, or better coffee for the I nion. In addi
tion, the Daily is anxious to "cover" the party and obtain as com
plete a guest list as possible.
I lowever. all seniors desirous of attending this auspicious affair
must signify intention <»112 doing so before May () for on that date
the imitations are withdrawn by the Registrar's office, and unless
a person is on the list he is automatically "bonged" from attending
the cap and gown slumming party. The object for the closing of
the application date is to facilitate the printing of the diplomas—
diplomas which have Latin phrases on them, diplomas which are
smudgy, and just diplomas.
\s in all cases there is a joker, for on May () the Registrar's
fl'lice will send out official invitations "requesting your presence
and $5.00" to cover the cost of removing the smudge spots to those
cniors who have filed their graduation application.
Tuesday, May (>, is your last chance to get your name in this
erstwhile paper and so the seniors should sign the "blue" card signi
fying their desire to graduate before that dale. The Registrar's of
lice, the Daily, and $5.00 will do the rest.
