# RISING BLOOD PRESSURE
## 
### 
Macadamized wrinkles in campus roads recently were ironed
out to permit the egress of the University's vehicular traffic with as
much smoothness as was possible. \o effort was spared by the
authorities in repairing the streets.
Now the advantage to be gained from all this work and energy
apparently is to be lost with the apparent purposeful scattering of
broken glass by vandals. That this nuisance is sure to aggravate
campus motorists cannot be denied. Imagine the comments that
might be uttered by an irate motorist when his tire blows out at the
corner of Lasuen and Santa Teresa streets. All this rising blood
pressure because of a bit of small glass.
Although it may not be generally realized, purposeful scattering
of glass on any road is a violation of the' California State Motor
Vehicle \ct. University officials should endeavor to apprehend
these culprits and prevent this nuisance. If such action is impos
sible, provision should be made to have the streets swept clear of
glass.
All of this is a matter of marked triviality, of courseâ€”to every
one but those who have to buy new tires.
