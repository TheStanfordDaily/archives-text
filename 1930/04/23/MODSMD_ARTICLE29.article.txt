THE CRIMINAL CODE—At the '

The heavy irony of the play lays ;
1 hold of one in the prologue, grow-1
ing more oppressive as the play ,
unfolds, until the final curtain finds
; one shaken up, wondering just how
, close to actuality is this sl.ark reve- '
lation of the inhumanity of prison j
life, and the warped justice of the j
criminal code. Raw scenes of the '
i prison mess hall, and jute mill, and
the prison "dungeon"—in which :

were half cattle, half machines —in ;
which a man is put. through the j
third degree, a "squealer" is mur- j

' scene in which the shuddering hor- j
vor of a siren screams out the es- j
cape of a prisoner who has stabbed j
his guard—all of these grip and I

QRAWNEY WYCHERLEY. By Wil
lard Connely. Charles Scrib
ners Sons. New York. 1930.
For more than a century the
'writers of the Restoration and
| their works have been almost com- (
i pletely neglected, or, at. most, they
'have beerf dismissed with a casual
statement that the period was li
centious and not worthy of note. 1
Ho, despite the fact that nearly
i everyone mentioned in the encycio- I
j pedia is now having his biography
i written, it is very encouraging that
the life of Wycherley should have
i been made available to the ad- i
| mirers of the Restoration and its !
j comedies.
! Connely has done no exceptional
| piece of work, but. he has allowed
i the amusing people of the period i
land a fair share of their witty re-j
| marks to combine in an interesting j
j and charming background to the
i life of Wycherley.
Connely does not attempt to
.criticize the works of the author
and there was no reason that lie I
j should do more than tell of there- j
| ception afforded them by the Lon-
I don audience of thai time. The
i most, annoying thing in the work is
I the frequently reiterated idea ex
pressed in the final paragraph: "He j
j was a great lover if only he had
(ever loved."
This statement, in addition to I
being somewhat obscure, has no
i reason for inclusion in the book.
Wycherley could hardly, to be sure, |
he imagined to have suffered long
from romantic love; but there is
ino reason to state this fact in a
manner which implies that the
' lack was unfortunate. His readers,
] at any rate, would not. still he en
' joying The Country Wife if Wych
erley had loved very seriously.
In other respects, however, Mr.
j Connely does all that can be ex
pected. His book is one which has
j been long needed by students of
| the writers of the comedy of man- i
Iners, and its appearance is another
j indication of the fact that, though
I our period may not equal the!
I achievements of the Restoration, it
j may, at. least, restore the works of |
I that period to their proper place
|in English literature. —E. E. W.

QRAWNEY WYCHERLEY. By Wil
lard Connely. Charles Scrib
ners Sons. New York. 1930.
For more than a century the
'writers of the Restoration and
| their works have been almost com- (
i pletely neglected, or, at. most, they
'have beerf dismissed with a casual
statement that the period was li
centious and not worthy of note. 1
Ho, despite the fact that nearly
i everyone mentioned in the encycio- I
j pedia is now having his biography
i written, it is very encouraging that
the life of Wycherley should have
i been made available to the ad- i
| mirers of the Restoration and its !
j comedies.
! Connely has done no exceptional
| piece of work, but. he has allowed
i the amusing people of the period i
land a fair share of their witty re-j
| marks to combine in an interesting j
j and charming background to the
i life of Wycherley.
Connely does not attempt to
.criticize the works of the author
and there was no reason that lie I
j should do more than tell of there- j
| ception afforded them by the Lon-
I don audience of thai time. The
i most, annoying thing in the work is
I the frequently reiterated idea ex
pressed in the final paragraph: "He j
j was a great lover if only he had
(ever loved."
This statement, in addition to I
being somewhat obscure, has no
i reason for inclusion in the book.
Wycherley could hardly, to be sure, |
he imagined to have suffered long
from romantic love; but there is
ino reason to state this fact in a
manner which implies that the
' lack was unfortunate. His readers,
] at any rate, would not. still he en
' joying The Country Wife if Wych
erley had loved very seriously.
In other respects, however, Mr.
j Connely does all that can be ex
pected. His book is one which has
j been long needed by students of
| the writers of the comedy of man- i
Iners, and its appearance is another
j indication of the fact that, though
I our period may not equal the!
I achievements of the Restoration, it
j may, at. least, restore the works of |
I that period to their proper place
|in English literature. —E. E. W.
THE CRIMINAL CODE—At the '
Geary Theatre, San Francisco, i
Ah grim and hard as the massive i
grey prison wails of its amazing |

the spectator with a knot some- j

there a long time.
The heavy irony of the play lays ;
1 hold of one in the prologue, grow-1
ing more oppressive as the play ,
unfolds, until the final curtain finds
; one shaken up, wondering just how
, close to actuality is this sl.ark reve- '
lation of the inhumanity of prison j
life, and the warped justice of the j
criminal code. Raw scenes of the '
i prison mess hall, and jute mill, and
the prison "dungeon"—in which :
! prisoners are treated as if they
were half cattle, half machines —in ;
which a man is put. through the j
third degree, a "squealer" is mur- j

' scene in which the shuddering hor- j
vor of a siren screams out the es- j
