THE CRIMINAL CODE—At the '
Geary Theatre, San Francisco, i
Ah grim and hard as the massive i
grey prison wails of its amazing |
sets, "The Criminal Code" leaves I
the spectator with a knot some- j
1 where inside —a knot; which stays i
there a long time.
The heavy irony of the play lays ;
1 hold of one in the prologue, grow-1
ing more oppressive as the play ,
unfolds, until the final curtain finds
; one shaken up, wondering just how
, close to actuality is this sl.ark reve- '
lation of the inhumanity of prison j
life, and the warped justice of the j
criminal code. Raw scenes of the '
i prison mess hall, and jute mill, and
the prison "dungeon"—in which :
! prisoners are treated as if they
were half cattle, half machines —in ;
which a man is put. through the j
third degree, a "squealer" is mur- j
I dered at; the hands of one of his
■ former pals—and one tremendous j
' scene in which the shuddering hor- j
vor of a siren screams out the es- j
cape of a prisoner who has stabbed j
his guard—all of these grip and I
; challenge one. It is not. a comfort- j
I able play — hut fascinating and ab- |
: sorbing to a degree seldom ex- !
j perieuced.
| The sets are triumphs of imagin- 1
j alive artistry, although almost '
i over-effective. Two hours of star- 1
I ing at those bare, leaden-hued i
! walls, incredibly high and thick, I
| and of seeing faces only in a green
; ish light that gives them a peculiar j
ashen color, gets under one's skin, i
i There are bitter lines in this I
| play. "An eye for an eye, and a i
tooth for a tooth" is the tirst com-
I mandment of the Criminal Code" —j
i the Bible of the whole justice sys- i
| tern —and the integrity of this
! great American institution is not
to be violated even though it
I means sending an innocent man to
the unspeakable hell of a prison's
jute mill for ten years. Perhaps if
is an exaggeration, a sentimentali
zation —perhaps the touch about
the prisoners gambling for the
sugar that is doled out to them
once a week, and the line "Oh God,
I I'd sell my soul for ham and eggs"
| —is obvious —yet it is moving none
| the less.
The superb acting of Arthur
| Byron keeps the play at a terrific
| pitch of interest. His slightest
i movement, (to the lighting of his
j eternal cigar) and every inflection
lof his brusque voice—as he jerks
out lightning questions, or thun
ders at or pleads with a prisoner—
is in perfect character.

i His performance in the scene in
I which he tries to force the name j
j of the man who killed the squealer |
| from the boy who saw the crime is ;
1 the high mark of tin* play in point I
of dramatic strength -and makes
| the spectator forget everything in
the world hut the battle of wills of
I these two men. —M. L. R.
QRAWNEY WYCHERLEY. By Wil
lard Connely. Charles Scrib
ners Sons. New York. 1930.
For more than a century the
'writers of the Restoration and
| their works have been almost com- (
i pletely neglected, or, at. most, they
'have beerf dismissed with a casual
statement that the period was li
centious and not worthy of note. 1
Ho, despite the fact that nearly
i everyone mentioned in the encycio- I
j pedia is now having his biography
i written, it is very encouraging that
the life of Wycherley should have
i been made available to the ad- i
| mirers of the Restoration and its !
j comedies.
! Connely has done no exceptional
| piece of work, but. he has allowed
i the amusing people of the period i
land a fair share of their witty re-j
| marks to combine in an interesting j
j and charming background to the
i life of Wycherley.
Connely does not attempt to
.criticize the works of the author
and there was no reason that lie I
j should do more than tell of there- j
| ception afforded them by the Lon-
I don audience of thai time. The
i most, annoying thing in the work is
I the frequently reiterated idea ex
pressed in the final paragraph: "He j
j was a great lover if only he had
(ever loved."
This statement, in addition to I
being somewhat obscure, has no
i reason for inclusion in the book.
Wycherley could hardly, to be sure, |
he imagined to have suffered long
from romantic love; but there is
ino reason to state this fact in a
manner which implies that the
' lack was unfortunate. His readers,
] at any rate, would not. still he en
' joying The Country Wife if Wych
erley had loved very seriously.
In other respects, however, Mr.
j Connely does all that can be ex
pected. His book is one which has
j been long needed by students of
| the writers of the comedy of man- i
Iners, and its appearance is another
j indication of the fact that, though
I our period may not equal the!
I achievements of the Restoration, it
j may, at. least, restore the works of |
I that period to their proper place
|in English literature. —E. E. W.
