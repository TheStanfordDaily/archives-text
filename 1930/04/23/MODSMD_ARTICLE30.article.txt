GASTRONOMIC ATTRACTIONS

| Tlie Editor, Sir:
It now appears that the eating
clubs are voting themselves into!
exclusive resident control of Toyon
Hall. A noble act. You see the!
clubs cannot compete with the row j
in securing aspiring young fresh- I
men so they must get a citadel as
an added attraction, it, is rather j
difficult for the clubs to survive on |
gastronomic enticements alone so !
living quarters must be furnished. ,
It. doesn't matter that at present j
the eating clubs get much more j
than the proportionate share of j
rooms in both Toyon and Branner, j
they want an exclusive hall to pro- j

jtnote the congeniality and foster ;
the democratic spirit of liiill life, i
'A splendid notion.
Hut being curious I should like 1
to know by what right have the [
Seating clubs, or the members of
! Toyon Club, or the residents of
Toyon Mall to vote on a proposi- !
| iion which affects n greater mini-|
| ber than they? If anyone is to
: vote the entire number of men stu
i dents should and not just 1-10 of
(the total number.
It is nice of the clubs to conde- j
! scend to let the present inhabitants i
i to remain there until they gradu- j
j ate. â€”W. D. '31. j
