LUMBRICUS TERRESTRIS
1 should not like to be a worm,
And eat my way through miles
of dirt,
However much my entrails hurt.
It would be tough without a shirt
With coughs and colds to gasp
and sqirm,
And constantly to be alert
Against each death-producing
germ.
It would not be what I would term
A joy, I hereby do assert,
Declare, and solemnly affirm,
To bravo the boggy ground un
girt.
Forgive me if I'm somewhat curt;
I am no thick-skinned pachyderm:
Have I not ample cause to blurt,
"I should not like to be it worm"?
—Darrell Amyx.
