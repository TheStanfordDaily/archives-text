IS BASEBALL KING?
Many handicaps thrown in the
way of mural baseball this season
have led 10 numerous defaults by
various outfits. The past two days
have failed to see a single game
played, all having been forfeited,
and unless some of the teams
show up this week, baseball will
probably be relegated to a second
ary position in the intramural
spo"l program. Yet it is not hard
lo see why interest in the great
American game has waned.
One of the chief obstacles in the
way of the mural games is the
hard-hearted appearance of the dia
monds. To the casual observer, il
would seem that the present play
ground had formerly been tin- kit<•
of a quarry, for stones are scat
it red in prodigous quantities about
the fields.
The infields are great equalizers
of men —for one person is as Rood
as another in guessing Where the
pesky pill is apt to bounce next.
Ah for the outfields —if a fly-chaser
permits the horsehide to drift over
his head, the hit is good for numer
ous bases while all hands search
lor the lost spheroid.
Rushing season, too, has taken
its toll of men, and tin* annual
frenzies of the Greek-letter men
have detracted from the interest
in the game. Few have turned out
'Hiring the past two weeks of the
.season, although since approxi
mately three weeks of play yet re
main, many of the houses may yet
appear for their games later in the
chedule.
A year ago, two leagues were ar
ranged with competition in soft
ball and hard-ball groups, and they
were hard-fought throughout. In
1 lie hard-ball tilts. Delta Chi copped
i lie crown after a tough tussle with
the Toro tossers in the final game.
This year, however, there are but
the hard-ball games, and much
sentiment has been expressed in
favor of the two types of game, it
is said that because many of the
living groups cannot find space to
practice for the usual hard-ball
tills, and because of difficulty in
obtaining enough gloves, mitts, and
the like to go around, the soft-ball
lilts are better adapted to the
needs of some of the local athletes.
Yet, by the time the play-off for
1 lie mural title has rolled around,
the boys acquire a little teamwork
and the championship games are
well worth the attention of any
sport-minded fans in this institu
-1 ion.
Many unusual plays, decisions,
and records are hung up in these
mural games. Harlow Rothert, shot
put and discus ace, set a record
for Ripley to copy. According to a
Daily reporter of the 1927 season,
Rothert twirled for Encina II dur
ing his freshman year, and in one
inning "lie fanned six men, all of
whom reached first base due to er
rors on the part, of either the
catcher or the first baseman. Six
runs were scored against Rothert,
all of them unearned." Believe it
or not!
In spite of the handicap, bow
ever, the mural baseball games
continue to function, and many
covetous eyes are fastened upon
the stalwart twirier moulded in
bronze who represents the Univer
sity championship, and who is dis
played at Encina Gym store.

OKEH ANTHEM
WASHINGTON, April 22. (/P)—
The Linthicum bill to designate
"The Star-Spangled Banner" as the
national anthem was passed by the
House and sent, to the Senate.
IS BASEBALL KING?
Many handicaps thrown in the
way of mural baseball this season
have led 10 numerous defaults by
various outfits. The past two days
have failed to see a single game
played, all having been forfeited,
and unless some of the teams
show up this week, baseball will
probably be relegated to a second
ary position in the intramural
spo"l program. Yet it is not hard
lo see why interest in the great
American game has waned.
One of the chief obstacles in the
way of the mural games is the
hard-hearted appearance of the dia
monds. To the casual observer, il
would seem that the present play
ground had formerly been tin- kit<•
of a quarry, for stones are scat
it red in prodigous quantities about
the fields.
The infields are great equalizers
of men —for one person is as Rood
as another in guessing Where the
pesky pill is apt to bounce next.
Ah for the outfields —if a fly-chaser
permits the horsehide to drift over
his head, the hit is good for numer
ous bases while all hands search
lor the lost spheroid.
Rushing season, too, has taken
its toll of men, and tin* annual
frenzies of the Greek-letter men
have detracted from the interest
in the game. Few have turned out
'Hiring the past two weeks of the
.season, although since approxi
mately three weeks of play yet re
main, many of the houses may yet
appear for their games later in the
chedule.
A year ago, two leagues were ar
ranged with competition in soft
ball and hard-ball groups, and they
were hard-fought throughout. In
1 lie hard-ball tilts. Delta Chi copped
i lie crown after a tough tussle with
the Toro tossers in the final game.
This year, however, there are but
the hard-ball games, and much
sentiment has been expressed in
favor of the two types of game, it
is said that because many of the
living groups cannot find space to
practice for the usual hard-ball
tills, and because of difficulty in
obtaining enough gloves, mitts, and
the like to go around, the soft-ball
lilts are better adapted to the
needs of some of the local athletes.
Yet, by the time the play-off for
1 lie mural title has rolled around,
the boys acquire a little teamwork
and the championship games are
well worth the attention of any
sport-minded fans in this institu
-1 ion.
Many unusual plays, decisions,
and records are hung up in these
mural games. Harlow Rothert, shot
put and discus ace, set a record
for Ripley to copy. According to a
Daily reporter of the 1927 season,
Rothert twirled for Encina II dur
ing his freshman year, and in one
inning "lie fanned six men, all of
whom reached first base due to er
rors on the part, of either the
catcher or the first baseman. Six
runs were scored against Rothert,
all of them unearned." Believe it
or not!
