# Stanford Track Stars To Fly To Fresno Meet
## MINDED CARDS MAY BE ENTERED IN RAISIN CLASSIC Templeton Believes Track Team Should Down Washington 
### Bob Van Etten 
SEATTLE, Wash., April 22. (/P)—
Washington's track team suffered
a serious blow today when Captain
Steven Anderson, national A.A.U.
and national collegiate hurdles
champion, turned his right ankle
during a trial run a few hours be
fore the team was to leave for a
meet with Stanford Saturday. An
derson, however, left Seattle to
night with the other 21 track ath
letes. Click Clark, Hysky trainer,
said there was a slight possibility
that Anderson's ankle would heal
before Saturday, permitting him to
compete in the dual meet.

From scraps of earnest conver
sation circulating about the seat
of vantage, located next to the
practice oval, from which Mr.
"Dink" Templeton, coach of the
Stanford track and field team,
gazes with carefull dissimulated in-,
teres! upon the (tapers of his ath
letes, one gathers a strong impres
sion that "Dink's" boys have be
come decidedly air-minded.
AI any rate, the proposal of cer
tain officials of the West Coast Re
lays to transport a few individual
stars by airplane to Fresno to com
pete against the present list of not
able entries seems to appear to
many of the Cardinal cindermen in
much the same light with which a
small boy views the attractions of
a roller-coaster at an amusement
park.
Negotiations Under Way
Negotiations now being made by
Robert Bell, manager of the Stan
ford squad, will probably result in
having a number of the Redshirt
trackmen climb aboard a plane or
two following Saturday afternoon's
contest with Washington with the
Raisin City as their destination.
Among those planning definitely
to take the trip, provided always
that transportation comes through
as expected, are Harlow Rotliert
and Les Hab-les, while Captain Erie
Krenn, Her, Dyer, Herb Fleish
hacker, and several others need but
little encouragement to join the
parade. Rothert will compete in his
particular specialty, the shotput, in
which he will find Herman Brix and
Bob Hall as his chief opponents,
while Hables plans to enter the
featured 100-yard sprint event. Any
of the Stanfordites who do enter
the meet will compete unattached,
as Stanford is not officially repre
sented.
Good Watches
Apparently the umpty-odd-jewel
wrist watches offered by those
managing the Fresno Relays to the
lucky winners of each event pos
sess a strange appeal for the Red
shirt track and field artists, de
spite the fact that Maynor Shove,
who collected one last year as a
reward for his share in winning
the mile relay, claims that his
alarm clock concluded its brief
career as a tlmpiece and went on
an indefinite layoff only a few
miles beyond the Fresno city limits.
In all fairness to the managers of
the relays, however, it must be said
that other of the Stanford watch
winners did receive timepieces
which have served them with all
the faithfulness of Old Dog Tray.
Just what effect all this enthu
siasm for the San Joaquin valley
will have on the Cardinal-Husky
track meet scheduled this Satur
day afternoon is difficult to deter
mine. Coach Templeton, although
not underrating the proven
strength of the Washington squad,
believes that his men will success
fully take the measure of the Seat
tle spikesters.
Stanford Favored
Going back to comparative
scores, we find that Washington
downed the California Bears 74-55,
which makes Stanford about nine
points stronger than the Huskies.
And an analysis of entrants in each
events makes this margin appear
just aboi»t it.
On the track Stanford may be
outscored heavily. Pendleton, who
takes care of the sprints for Coach
Edmundson, should give Dyer
something of a battle in the 220,
and can be counted on to break
into the scoring column in both
dashes. Hartley, consistent at 4
seconds for the 440, may give even
Johnny Morrison trouble, although
both Morrison and Shove should
show the Husky quarter-miler their
heels at the tape.
Rufus Kiser, probably the best
miler on the coast, will double in
the 880 as well, Kiser has run 45)
seconds flat in a 440 and ran the
first half of his 4:19 mile against
California in 2:04, so that his
chances of capturing a double win
appear most excellent. Washington
also boasts a couple of two-milers
who took the measure of Hender
son of the Deal's and ought.to offer
Parker and Nunes a world of com
petition.
Anderson Double Winner
As far ns the hurdles are con
cerned, 10 points can be chalked
up for the Huskies before tlie
events are run. Steve Anderson,
captain of the Washington squad,
stands out as the greatest barrier
man in the country, and has
equalled world's record time in
the high sticks in practice on sev
eral occasions. Pressed by the
valiant Podge Smith, Anderson may
set a couple of Stanford track rec
ords during the afternoon.
Inside the oval, events take on a
much brighter Cardinal hue. Paul
Jessup, despite his 50-foot puts,
will probably have to be content
with a third place in the shot
against Rothert and Captain Krenz,
although in the discus he is likely
to push one out far enough to grab
a second. Adams, a javelin-thrower
of no mean ability, just about com
pletes- the Husky roster of out
standing field performers. A pre
ponderance of points in the broad
jump, high jump, and pole vault,
plus the customary live dibits from
the relay, should give the Cards
another victory.

not underrating the proven
strength of the Washington squad,
believes that his men will success
fully take the measure of the Seat
tle spikesters.
Stanford Favored
Going back to comparative
scores, we find that Washington
downed the California Bears 74-55,
which makes Stanford about nine
points stronger than the Huskies.
And an analysis of entrants in each
events makes this margin appear
just aboi»t it.
On the track Stanford may be
outscored heavily. Pendleton, who
takes care of the sprints for Coach
Edmundson, should give Dyer
something of a battle in the 220,
and can be counted on to break
into the scoring column in both
dashes. Hartley, consistent at 4
seconds for the 440, may give even
Johnny Morrison trouble, although
both Morrison and Shove should
show the Husky quarter-miler their
heels at the tape.
Rufus Kiser, probably the best
miler on the coast, will double in
the 880 as well, Kiser has run 45)
seconds flat in a 440 and ran the
first half of his 4:19 mile against
California in 2:04, so that his
chances of capturing a double win
appear most excellent. Washington
also boasts a couple of two-milers
who took the measure of Hender
son of the Deal's and ought.to offer
Parker and Nunes a world of com
petition.
Anderson Double Winner
As far ns the hurdles are con
cerned, 10 points can be chalked
up for the Huskies before tlie
events are run. Steve Anderson,
captain of the Washington squad,
stands out as the greatest barrier
man in the country, and has
equalled world's record time in
the high sticks in practice on sev
eral occasions. Pressed by the
valiant Podge Smith, Anderson may
set a couple of Stanford track rec
ords during the afternoon.
Inside the oval, events take on a
much brighter Cardinal hue. Paul
Jessup, despite his 50-foot puts,
will probably have to be content
with a third place in the shot
against Rothert and Captain Krenz,
although in the discus he is likely
to push one out far enough to grab
a second. Adams, a javelin-thrower
of no mean ability, just about com
pletes- the Husky roster of out
standing field performers. A pre
ponderance of points in the broad
jump, high jump, and pole vault,
plus the customary live dibits from
the relay, should give the Cards
another victory.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 22. (/P)—
Washington's track team suffered
a serious blow today when Captain
Steven Anderson, national A.A.U.
and national collegiate hurdles
champion, turned his right ankle
during a trial run a few hours be
fore the team was to leave for a
meet with Stanford Saturday. An
derson, however, left Seattle to
night with the other 21 track ath
letes. Click Clark, Hysky trainer,
said there was a slight possibility
that Anderson's ankle would heal
before Saturday, permitting him to
compete in the dual meet.

From scraps of earnest conver
sation circulating about the seat
of vantage, located next to the
practice oval, from which Mr.
"Dink" Templeton, coach of the
Stanford track and field team,
gazes with carefull dissimulated in-,
teres! upon the (tapers of his ath
letes, one gathers a strong impres
sion that "Dink's" boys have be
come decidedly air-minded.
AI any rate, the proposal of cer
tain officials of the West Coast Re
lays to transport a few individual
stars by airplane to Fresno to com
pete against the present list of not
able entries seems to appear to
many of the Cardinal cindermen in
much the same light with which a
small boy views the attractions of
a roller-coaster at an amusement
park.
Negotiations Under Way
Negotiations now being made by
Robert Bell, manager of the Stan
ford squad, will probably result in
having a number of the Redshirt
trackmen climb aboard a plane or
two following Saturday afternoon's
contest with Washington with the
Raisin City as their destination.
Among those planning definitely
to take the trip, provided always
that transportation comes through
as expected, are Harlow Rotliert
and Les Hab-les, while Captain Erie
Krenn, Her, Dyer, Herb Fleish
hacker, and several others need but
little encouragement to join the
parade. Rothert will compete in his
particular specialty, the shotput, in
which he will find Herman Brix and
Bob Hall as his chief opponents,
while Hables plans to enter the
featured 100-yard sprint event. Any
of the Stanfordites who do enter
the meet will compete unattached,
as Stanford is not officially repre
sented.
Good Watches
Apparently the umpty-odd-jewel
wrist watches offered by those
managing the Fresno Relays to the
lucky winners of each event pos
sess a strange appeal for the Red
shirt track and field artists, de
spite the fact that Maynor Shove,
who collected one last year as a
reward for his share in winning
the mile relay, claims that his
alarm clock concluded its brief
career as a tlmpiece and went on
an indefinite layoff only a few
miles beyond the Fresno city limits.
In all fairness to the managers of
the relays, however, it must be said
that other of the Stanford watch
winners did receive timepieces
which have served them with all
the faithfulness of Old Dog Tray.
Just what effect all this enthu
siasm for the San Joaquin valley
will have on the Cardinal-Husky
track meet scheduled this Satur
day afternoon is difficult to deter

Stanford track and field team,
gazes with carefull dissimulated in-,
teres! upon the (tapers of his ath
letes, one gathers a strong impres
sion that "Dink's" boys have be
come decidedly air-minded.
AI any rate, the proposal of cer
tain officials of the West Coast Re
lays to transport a few individual
stars by airplane to Fresno to com
pete against the present list of not
able entries seems to appear to
many of the Cardinal cindermen in
much the same light with which a
small boy views the attractions of
a roller-coaster at an amusement
park.
Negotiations Under Way
Negotiations now being made by
Robert Bell, manager of the Stan
ford squad, will probably result in
having a number of the Redshirt
trackmen climb aboard a plane or
two following Saturday afternoon's
contest with Washington with the
Raisin City as their destination.
Among those planning definitely
to take the trip, provided always
that transportation comes through
as expected, are Harlow Rotliert
and Les Hab-les, while Captain Erie
Krenn, Her, Dyer, Herb Fleish
hacker, and several others need but
little encouragement to join the
parade. Rothert will compete in his
particular specialty, the shotput, in
which he will find Herman Brix and
Bob Hall as his chief opponents,
while Hables plans to enter the
featured 100-yard sprint event. Any
of the Stanfordites who do enter
the meet will compete unattached,
as Stanford is not officially repre
sented.
Good Watches
Apparently the umpty-odd-jewel
wrist watches offered by those
managing the Fresno Relays to the
lucky winners of each event pos
sess a strange appeal for the Red
shirt track and field artists, de
spite the fact that Maynor Shove,
who collected one last year as a
reward for his share in winning
the mile relay, claims that his
alarm clock concluded its brief
career as a tlmpiece and went on
an indefinite layoff only a few
miles beyond the Fresno city limits.
In all fairness to the managers of
the relays, however, it must be said
that other of the Stanford watch
winners did receive timepieces
which have served them with all
the faithfulness of Old Dog Tray.
Just what effect all this enthu
siasm for the San Joaquin valley
will have on the Cardinal-Husky
track meet scheduled this Satur
day afternoon is difficult to deter
mine. Coach Templeton, although
not underrating the proven
strength of the Washington squad,
believes that his men will success
fully take the measure of the Seat
tle spikesters.
Stanford Favored
Going back to comparative
scores, we find that Washington
downed the California Bears 74-55,
which makes Stanford about nine
points stronger than the Huskies.
And an analysis of entrants in each
events makes this margin appear
just aboi»t it.
On the track Stanford may be
outscored heavily. Pendleton, who
takes care of the sprints for Coach
Edmundson, should give Dyer
something of a battle in the 220,
and can be counted on to break
into the scoring column in both
dashes. Hartley, consistent at 4
seconds for the 440, may give even
Johnny Morrison trouble, although
both Morrison and Shove should
show the Husky quarter-miler their
heels at the tape.
Rufus Kiser, probably the best
miler on the coast, will double in
the 880 as well, Kiser has run 45)
seconds flat in a 440 and ran the
first half of his 4:19 mile against
California in 2:04, so that his
chances of capturing a double win
appear most excellent. Washington
also boasts a couple of two-milers
who took the measure of Hender
son of the Deal's and ought.to offer
Parker and Nunes a world of com
petition.
Anderson Double Winner
As far ns the hurdles are con
cerned, 10 points can be chalked
up for the Huskies before tlie
events are run. Steve Anderson,
captain of the Washington squad,
stands out as the greatest barrier
man in the country, and has
equalled world's record time in
the high sticks in practice on sev
eral occasions. Pressed by the
valiant Podge Smith, Anderson may
set a couple of Stanford track rec
ords during the afternoon.
Inside the oval, events take on a
much brighter Cardinal hue. Paul
Jessup, despite his 50-foot puts,
will probably have to be content
with a third place in the shot
against Rothert and Captain Krenz,
although in the discus he is likely
to push one out far enough to grab
a second. Adams, a javelin-thrower
of no mean ability, just about com
pletes- the Husky roster of out
standing field performers. A pre
ponderance of points in the broad
jump, high jump, and pole vault,
plus the customary live dibits from
the relay, should give the Cards
another victory.
SEATTLE, Wash., April 22. (/P)—
Washington's track team suffered
a serious blow today when Captain
Steven Anderson, national A.A.U.
and national collegiate hurdles
champion, turned his right ankle
during a trial run a few hours be
fore the team was to leave for a
meet with Stanford Saturday. An
derson, however, left Seattle to
night with the other 21 track ath
letes. Click Clark, Hysky trainer,
said there was a slight possibility
that Anderson's ankle would heal
before Saturday, permitting him to
compete in the dual meet.

sation circulating about the seat
of vantage, located next to the
practice oval, from which Mr.
