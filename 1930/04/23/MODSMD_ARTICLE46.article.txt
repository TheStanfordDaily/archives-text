# Stanford Track Stars To Fly To Fresno Meet
## MINDED CARDS MAY BE ENTERED IN RAISIN CLASSIC Templeton Believes Track Team Should Down Washington 
### Bob Van Etten 
SEATTLE, Wash., April 22. (/P)—
Washington's track team suffered
a serious blow today when Captain
Steven Anderson, national A.A.U.
and national collegiate hurdles
champion, turned his right ankle
during a trial run a few hours be
fore the team was to leave for a
meet with Stanford Saturday. An
derson, however, left Seattle to
night with the other 21 track ath
letes. Click Clark, Hysky trainer,
said there was a slight possibility
that Anderson's ankle would heal
before Saturday, permitting him to
compete in the dual meet.

From scraps of earnest conver
sation circulating about the seat
of vantage, located next to the
practice oval, from which Mr.
"Dink" Templeton, coach of the
Stanford track and field team,
gazes with carefull dissimulated in-,
teres! upon the (tapers of his ath
letes, one gathers a strong impres
sion that "Dink's" boys have be
come decidedly air-minded.
AI any rate, the proposal of cer
tain officials of the West Coast Re
lays to transport a few individual
stars by airplane to Fresno to com
pete against the present list of not
able entries seems to appear to
many of the Cardinal cindermen in
much the same light with which a
small boy views the attractions of
a roller-coaster at an amusement
park.
Negotiations Under Way
Negotiations now being made by
Robert Bell, manager of the Stan
ford squad, will probably result in
having a number of the Redshirt
trackmen climb aboard a plane or
two following Saturday afternoon's
contest with Washington with the
Raisin City as their destination.
Among those planning definitely
to take the trip, provided always
that transportation comes through
as expected, are Harlow Rotliert
and Les Hab-les, while Captain Erie
Krenn, Her, Dyer, Herb Fleish
hacker, and several others need but
little encouragement to join the
parade. Rothert will compete in his
particular specialty, the shotput, in
which he will find Herman Brix and
Bob Hall as his chief opponents,
while Hables plans to enter the
featured 100-yard sprint event. Any
of the Stanfordites who do enter
the meet will compete unattached,
as Stanford is not officially repre
sented.
Good Watches
Apparently the umpty-odd-jewel
wrist watches offered by those
managing the Fresno Relays to the
lucky winners of each event pos
sess a strange appeal for the Red
shirt track and field artists, de
spite the fact that Maynor Shove,
who collected one last year as a
reward for his share in winning
the mile relay, claims that his
alarm clock concluded its brief
