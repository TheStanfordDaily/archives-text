# THE 						PILOT OF THE YANKS
## Bob Shawkey and His Yankees Must Win Two-Thirds Of Their Games to Reach the World's Series 
### Feg Murray, '16 
"It was an ancient mariner, and
he stoppeth one of three." —But
that veteran sailor, Robert, Shaw
key, who is managing the New
York Yankees this season, has got
to do better than that —he's got to
stop at least two of every three op
ponents or he and his boys won't
beat out Connie Mack and his A's
for the 1930 American League pen
nant. A little simple arithmetic will
show that two-thirds of 154 games
is 102 2-3, and last season the Ath
letics won 104 contests, so this An
cient Mariner had better just go
along with the idea in mind of
making it three out of three and
'.then there'll be no dead albatross
I to hoodoo the good ship on its long
voyage to Pennantville.
Bob Shawkey, so it seems, has
I made himself popular with the
j members of the team. He was given
! the job of managing, shortly after
the lamented death of the very suc
cessful Miller Huggins. I see no
| reason why he shouldn't also make
! himself popular with the fans of

New York. He was for many years
a star pitcher for the team he now
bosses, and in two seasons, espe
cially, made enviable records. In
191(5, his first lull year as a Yan
kee, lie won twenty-two games and
lost only fourteen, and also had
the enviable earned run average of
2.21. In two other seasons he won
as many as twenty contests, and
in 1923 he won a world series game
from the Giants, beating Jack Scott
8 to 4
But to get down to the present,
with the Red Shirt of Shawkey fly
ing at the masthead of the Yankee
ship as it embarks on its 1930
cruise. Bob the Gob used to mix
his pitches with brains, and it is
taken for granted that he will be a
thinking manager, and that, the
Yankees will follow him as their
leader as readily as they followed
his style lead years ago when he
introduced the red shirt into base
ball. There's a "key" in the name
of Shawkey. Will it. open the door
to a world series for the Yankees
next fall?
