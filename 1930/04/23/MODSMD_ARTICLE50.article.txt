# MOSSMAN ELECTED HEAD OF CALIFORNIA TRACKMEN FOR 1931
## 
### 
The sorrel-topped Everett "Spud"
Mossman was elected to lead the
1931 Bear tracksters at a recent
banquet of the California track men
at the Athens Club in Oakland.
Mossman was the "iron-man" of
the Big Meet last Saturday when
he won both the one-mile and two
mile runs.
The new captain broke the Card-
Bear record in the mile in his
freshman year and also won the
two-mile. Last year he turned in a
victory in the two-mile and was
undefeated on the coast in that
event.
