## 
### 
The picture of David Starr Jor
dan to be used in the Senior Pro
gram which is dedicated to him is
one that, has never before been
photographically reproduced for
the general public. It was painted
three years ago by Mrs. Winifred
Rieber as one of a series of por
traits of twenty-four international
figures which Mrs. Rieber hopes to
hang in one of the halls at Geneva
in the future.
Mrs. Rieber, wife of Dean Rieber
of r.C.L.A., has just authorized the
use of the picture by the Elliot
Company, which is publishing the
Senior Programs. The only previ
ous photographic copies have been
presented to President Hoover,
Secretary Wilbur, and other inti
mate friends of Dr. Jordan.
