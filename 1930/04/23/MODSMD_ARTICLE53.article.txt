# STUDENTS ASKED TO CALL FOR REBATES
## 
### 
Students who have not collected
their rebates from purchases made
at Stanford Bookstore last fall
quarter, and which were due the
first part of the winter quarter, are
urgently requested to call for those
rebates. It. is not too late yet to
get them, but the Bookstore is com
piling the rebates for the winter
quarter and wishes to finish pay
ment on uncalled-for fall quarter
rebates.
