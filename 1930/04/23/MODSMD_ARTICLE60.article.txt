# MODERN ADMINISTRATION EFFICIENCY IS PART OF SCHOOL OF BUSINESS TRAINING
## 
### BY H.B. CRISWELL JR 
(Editor's Note: The following Is
the .second of a series of articles
011 tiie Business School arranged
by the Editor in response to nu
merous inquiries, "chiefly from
undergraduates, about this new
and little-known part of the Uni
versity.)
The science of administration
lias multiplied and projected man's
power many-fold. Caesar was con
sidered a remarkable general lie
cause lie could direct the move
ment of 20,000 or 1)0,000 men at
one time. In fact, lie overcame
some 50,000 Helvetians by using
the principle of "pyramiding," or
delegation. He did not command
1)0,000 men. He commanded about
(». his lieutenants. His lines of com
munication were dependable, and
lie knew the ability of his aides.
Hence he had a machine, where the
barbarians had an unco-ordinated
series of small armies which Cae
sar crushed one at a time.
Today the science of organiza
tion and management lias advanced
until one man can direct; the move
ments of millions of men as easily
as Caesar did thousands; he can
control and direct the movement
of planes in the sky, or ships at.
sen on the other side of the globe.
And in industry a »ingle man can
sit at a control board and control
and time the movements of several
thousand parts through an automo
bile or watch factory.
A tractor plant at Peoria is some
!) miles in circumference. With less
than perfect co-ordination, thou
sands of dollars worth of machine
time would be lost by some ma
chines waiting for others. Without
good organization, parts could be
as hopelessly lost as a misplaced
volume in a large library. Philo
sophically, it is a monument to t lie
administrative power of man that
pinion No. 172!), produced on one
side of the plant, will ultimately
join together, at exactly Hie cor
re< t moment and place, gears No.
100 and No. S7ii, which may be
produced two miles away.
A few people are endowed with
(hi! type of master-brain which can
visualize anil comprehend the in
terrelationship of several thousand
parts or workers. Such minds are
rare. But there are aids to compre
hension which anyone can learn to
apply that enable an ordinary clerk
to run the entire process, just as
there are slide rules used in ma
chining steel that determine auto
matically for any piece of stock
the 13 cutting variables, speed,

I lubrication, depth of cut, etc. One I
of the greatest control devices is !
the Gantt Chart, a graphic repre
sentation of the situation both !
within the factory and throughout
every phase of the business at any !
moment. It is simple in principle, 1
yet it tells at one glance what it '
would take a volume to tell in
words —a volume a high executive
I would never get time to read. Many
high executives misdirect their at
tention, spending their valuable
time on trifles while crucial mat- 1
ters go neglected.
j Master Gantt Chart, a Gantt
Chart of (Jantt Charts, is a trouble
spotter. It shows which depend- ;
cnts are abnormal and need execu- !
five attention. It sifts the serious
situations from the important, it
'discloses relationships that may be
storm signals, as, high inventory
during falling commodity prices
and fluctuating money rates. At a I
glance the chief executive can
know exactly how much certain de
partments will have to speed up
to make delivery on time and pre- 1
vent loss of orders or litigation,
I how much advertising allowances
will have to be increased to extend
j sales through anticipated depres
sion sufficiently to maintain capa
city production, how much collec
tions will have to be increased to
meet the excess demands without
additional financing, etc.
The Graduate Business student
must know not only how to organ
ize such control schemes, dispatch- <
ing boards, and the like, but lie j
must have the accounting and sta
tistical science that will enable him 1
to interpret tlie result's. He must j
also.be familiar with the principles j
1 of arranging his machines and lay- ;
ing out a factory for maximum ef- I
. ficiency, through straight-Jine flow j
of work, etc.
In the r.s. Patent Office mere
rearrangement of desk sequence,
avoiding back-tracking and un
necessary handling, increased out- |
put ;!() per cent, enabling some dei
partments to catch up for the first,
time in years and release valuable I
j ideas to the world promptly.
The course is given by Professor |
Paul E. Holden, who had a part in
Hoover's study of "Waste in In- j
dustry," which lias already saved
over a billion a year. Professor >
i Holden, along with other noted
management engineers, lias done
much toward the introduction of
American methods into Europe and
Japan. The course is valuable train
ing in proper brain habits for at
tacking unfamiliar problems, as
well as for information.
