## 
### BY WILLIAM GRACE 
A lung slorm of applause, Ili«• cur
tain rose and fell, a second Mini
third curtain <•;< 11, and I'« rry Askain
had won over a packed liou.se of
tirsl nighters al the Curran theatre
in Siin Francisco Sunday.
Singing the leading role in "New
Moon," which has just completed
;i len-week run in Los Angeles,
Perry Askum will he remembered
;is the red-cloaked, woman-stealing
sheik in "The Desert Song," which
played in Sun Francisco last year.
Bin and strung, with dark, curly
hair and a smiling face, lie lias a
voice and a personality which
would make anyone his friend. We
found him backstage after t lie show
grinning at a crowd of fans waiting
as be peeled off his makeup. We
had guessed right about his being
a football player -and Santa Clara
was the school.
"I was a neighbor to Stanford lor
three years," he explained. "Left
school to sttidy music in Italy, but
the War interrupted that." He saw
service after l!) 14, but was reluc
tant to say much about it. Born ill

Seattle, Washington, lie later
moved to Mountain View, which is
now his home.
. "My father was a coroner, but
somehow that work never appealed
to me. I started acting while a slu
denl at Santa Clara, and for that
reason I think college dramatics a
great tiling. I have heard about the
work at Stanford, and would like
to see some of the productions if
my own plays did mil interfere.
That is the only trouble about this
stage business I missed the Big
Meet, and I usually am busy during
the football games."
Perry Askam is another veteran
of the boards who believes that
talkies will never supplant the
stage.
"Drama is an art," he assured us.
"People want their favorites in
pern Oil, to lie able to encore them.
Personally, I prefer making pic
tures to acting; the life is so much
more regular. Talkies are a fine
thing for small towns, as they show
feature actors at prices within
reach of everyone."
