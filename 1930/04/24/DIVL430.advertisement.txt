Jantzen
Monochromes
i
An inspiration in color harmony—the
new Jantzen Monochromes!
The uppers repeat in a lighter, softer
tone the alluring shade of the jaunty
skirt and trunks. For a smart accent,
Jantzen adds a woven belt and buckle
with a hairline stripe for color harmony.
For all its two-piece appearance, this is a
one-piece suit with the true Jantzen
swimming comfort and freedom.
You may choose Jantzen Monochromes
with either regulation or sun back. Both
styles fit perfectly—smoothly in front—
snugly to the back—at sea or on shore.
And this fit is permanent—thanks to the
marvelous elasticity of the famous Jant
zen Stitch. New colors and models now
on display—see them !
