# DISCARDING OF 4-YEAR COURSE COMES SLOWLY
## Wilbur Believes Change To More Advanced College Program Will Take Time President's Annual Report Praises High Quality Of Faculty, Student Body 
### 
Declaring Stanford has a strong
tendency to develop upper-division
and graduate and professional
work, President Hay Lyman Wil
bur in bis annual report says he
believes general acceptance of the
University ys a more advanced
school will not come quickly.
In the report, released yesterday,
the President says:
"For a long time the four-year
college course will find some place
in American education. No doubt
some institutions, with the usual
reluctance for change . . . will
continue to insist upon if as the
basis of all culture and education.
Ii is difficult even for those who
are in the midst of the strong
tides of education which are flow
ing to sense the shifting of basic
standards which has come into
American life with the wide distri
bution of wealth and of educational
opportunity."
In commenting on the last de
cade of administration policies,
President Wilbur declares the gen
eral effect "lias been to advahce
the prestige and reputation of the
University and to offer real oppor
tunity to aspiring students.
Advanced Students
"There has been a strong ten
dency for the University to de
velop its upper-division and gradu
ate work and its professional
schools. This lias been made pos
sible through a faculty of excep
tional strength and because stu
dents had adequate opportunities
for sound preparatory work in
many other institutions, lu general,
our students come at a somewhat
more advanced stage and stay with
us for longer periods.
"In other words, Stanford Uni
versity is gathering together a
faculty and a student body of high
quality doing more and more work
of university grade. As the ele
mentary work of the University is
absorbed by other institutions, its
resources, although limited, can be
most effective in going forward
from the high position already at
tained."
The report contained a brief sur
vey of research work now in prog
less at the University, and re
ported on many matters of admin
istrative detail. Appended to the
President's message to the Hoard
of Trustees were reports from the
Treasurer, Comptroller, Dean of
Men, Dean of Women, and from
other University officials.
Members of the faculty may ob
tain their copies of the report by
calling at the President's office.
