# ICHIHASHI HAILS LONDON PARLEY ACHIEVEMENT AS FORWARD STEP
## 
### BY RAWSON HOLMES 
| "A definite forward slop toward
Him realization of disa nna imut,
i from which the nations of the
world may advance in the future."
Such, in brief, is the evaluation of
the London Naval Conference and
its accomplishment.*;, given to a
Daily reporter yesterday by Pro
fessor Yamato Ichihashi, who was
j the confidential secretary to the

considerably larger. The ratio of
