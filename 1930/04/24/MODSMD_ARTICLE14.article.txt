# ICHIHASHI HAILS LONDON PARLEY ACHIEVEMENT AS FORWARD STEP
## 
### BY RAWSON HOLMES 
| "A definite forward slop toward
Him realization of disa nna imut,
i from which the nations of the
world may advance in the future."
Such, in brief, is the evaluation of
the London Naval Conference and
its accomplishment.*;, given to a
Daily reporter yesterday by Pro
fessor Yamato Ichihashi, who was
j the confidential secretary to the
I Japanese Senior delegate at the
{Washington Conference in 1921.
j "With the London Naval treaty
as a base, we may be able to keep
on advancing the cause," Profes
sor Ichihashi stated. "In 1936 the
I nations may decide to extend the
present 'naval holiday,' during
which no new capital ships may be
built, I uiii optimistic over the
treaty, not so much from its pres
-1 ent aspect, hut from its possible
'future."
Provisions Compared
Comparing the provisions of the
treaty with the proposals of the
United States at the outset of the

Washington Conference, the his
tory professor pointed out that the
total tonnage of the so-called!
"auxiliary craft" (cruisers, destroy
ers, .mil submarines) allocated to
the United Slates is slightly
smaller; that to Groat Britain
slightly larger; and that to Japan
considerably larger. The ratio of
lli" United States, Great Britain,
and Japan, has changed from {j-Jj-H
to iimo.
Total tonnages of the three
navies are subdivided into the vari
ous categories, the ratio of com
parative strength ranging from
10-10-10 iii submarines to iO-S.l-t1.02
in standard cruisers. These dif
ferences, Professor Ichihashi point
ed out, afford an opportunity for
propagandists to seize upon cer
tain sets of figures lo forward the
public, interpretation of the. treaty
along whatever line they particu
larly desire.
In explaining the slight differ
: ence in tonnage of the United
I States and Great Britain Professor
! Ichihashi pointed out the extreme
! difficulty of obtaining a "yard
j stick" capable of measuring mathe
| matically exact parity.
Nine Ships Scrapped
"The great achievement of the
j Conference is in the scrapping of]
i nine capital ships and the declara- |
tion of a live-year naval holiday j
during which no more may be built
| or replaced," Professor ichihashi
! declared. "When it is considered ,
: that each ship of this type repre- !
! sents an expenditure of between
40 and 50 million dollars, the im
portance of this achievement is !
realized.
"The sad part of the Conference J
was the failure of France and Italy !
| to come to an agreement. The pe- i
culiar characters of the two gov-|
eminent,s probably had a great deal j

to do with I his. The unfortunate
part of the affair is that it given
France an excuse for building up
her militaristic attitude, which is
a serious threat to the harmony of
I Europe."
Delegates Were Aloof
Contrasting the London with tin*
I Washington Conference, ichihushi
I commented on the difference in
I diplomatic proceedings. "At Wash
' ington, drama and color marked j
| the whole conference, beginning
j with the sensational opening speech
j of Hughes and contiuing through
■ out the entire session. At London,
the situation was entirely different.
; Everyone entered the proceedings
with a decided aloofness, which it
took many weeks to break down. At
Washington, the American delega-1
tion seised the leadership at the !
very outset. At London there was
no one who -could be called the i
dominant force. The avenues open j
to publicity at the London Confer- :
ence through the radio were not to
be found at nil iit Y^ashington.
