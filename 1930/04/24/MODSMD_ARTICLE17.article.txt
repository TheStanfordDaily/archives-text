### 
CHICAGO, Apr JI 121!. (/p) Jack
Dempsey is going to Africa to hunt
| l)ig game.
Apparently postponing whatever
i plhiis lie liatl of a ring comeback
| attempt, tlir "Manassa Mauler" has
j accepted the invitation of George
K. Get/., Chicago millionaire sports
| man and big game hunter, to try
his aim at lions and tigers in the
African wilds next winter.
Dempsey plans to take boxing
gloves and other ring accoutre
ments alotiK, however, for condi
tional workouts and to teach the
savages the manly art of defense.
"Maybe I'll find a new heavy
weight champion on one of our
safaris," Dempsey bantered. "Who
can toll? Anyway, I hope I don't
miss my aim at any lions. It's
tougher to aim and miss at a lion
than it is to miss lire at some
heavyweights, you know."
Many of the former champion's
friends believe his trip to Africa
will definitely close liis ring career
If it hasn't already been closed.
