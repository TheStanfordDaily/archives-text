# PRINTERS ACCEPT DAILY CHALLENGE TO GAME, MAY 18
## 
### 
"Whereas the Daily has
made several black and ut
terly false statements con
cerning the Press, which
statements have greatly ired
the aforesaid Press but not
one whit chagrined the above
mentioned Press, the Stanford
University Press does hereby
acknowledge the Daily's chal
lenge to a baseball game and
feels itself forced to put the
Daily in its proper place. But
since the Press thinks it neces
sary for the Daily to spend
more time in practice before
its team can even offer any
competition to the Press vet
erans, the Press does hereby
reset the date for the game
for Sunday, May 18."
In such u manner did the
typesetters flaunt their defi
ance before the pen-pushers of
the University's daily blurb.
Rumors lutve it that the Press
gang are dickering with sev
eral sand lot teams for ring
ers and that negotiations are
under way for a practice game
with the University of Cali
fornia Press nine.
