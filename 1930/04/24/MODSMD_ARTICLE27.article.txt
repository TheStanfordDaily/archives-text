()ne is nstonished that the administration of a large, and sup
posedly progressive, university should he so shoft-sighted as to lay
down such a regulation.
In the first place, it is entirely alien to modern ideas of free
peech and thought to thus throttle even a small minority. This is
especially true in the case of a university, where independent thought
is supposed to he fostered.
In the second place, it is stupid to think that such a procedure
will in anyway discourage these collegiate Reds. People of that
stripe thrive on suppression. And certainly no sane individual could
entertain serious fears of what danger lies in the activity of youthful
adherents to Communism. It is ahsurd to think that the product of
any modern American university would he a party to the more
violent tenets of the Communistic faith.
It is had enough when Whalen's Irish cops use medieval argu
ments against New York's ignorant anarchists; hut when a great
university utilizes the same tactics (in a more suave manner), the
limit ol retrogression seems to have been reached.
