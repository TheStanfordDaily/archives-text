Amherst <■ ollege, whose outstanding alumnus at the present
time is former i'resident Calvin Coolidge, has startled the collegiate
athletic world with the: adoption of a single standardized letter award
for all major and minor sports. The Massachusetts institution
adopted this move in order that more interest might be created in all
lines of athletic, competition.
I nder the new plan the Amherst ping-pong players are given the
same rating as those brutes who tuck a football under their arms
and rush up and down the gridiron. Imagine strong, virile he-men
routing into the ranks of athletes via the ping-pong route.
Mere at Stanford general interest in athletics is created through
ihe operation of the intramural sports program. The great number
of teams in intramural contests indicates the success of the Stanford
plan. I here is no need to rate all sports on a par in order to stimulate
greater interest.
Inauguration of the intramural system might work more of a
reform in the student sentiment at Amherst than would the obviously
unequal system of distributing standardized awards. There is a
linyt to the number of students who can participate in Amherst
ports. \t Stanford there is no maximum. The more, the merrier.
