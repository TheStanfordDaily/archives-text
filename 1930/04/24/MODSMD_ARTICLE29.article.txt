# OUR ROWDY SONGS
## 
### 
Within the next two weeks the Vssociated Students' committee
appointed to probe into thp welfare and misdeeds of sharps, flats,
and melodies in Stanford songs, will peal forth with revisions of
I resent musical compositions.
Organized to determine suitable songs for Stanford throats to
< hortle, the committee has succeeded in finding selections with origi
nal words and tunes to replace some of the existing compositions.
In addition, an original song telling of the recovery of the Stanford
Axe has been discovered and will be published if it is adopted bv
the Executive Committee.
I his move on the part of Stanford to better its songs is part of
a general movement that has swept the universities and colleges
throughout the country. Such famed pieces as "hair I larvard" and
the Alma Mater of Cornell, with their adopted tunes but original
lyrics, are examples of the former trend of collegiate song manu
facture. The original college song which has gained most favor is
probably the I Diversity of Wisconsin's "On Wisconsin."
However fruitful these trends might be, if is hoped that the tra
ditional rowdyism of college songs is not forsaken for uninspiring
hymnals which require experts to sing.
