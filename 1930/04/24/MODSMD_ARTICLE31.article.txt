LET'S GO. By E. J. Rath. G. How
ard Watt, New York, 1930. At
I the Palo Alto Bookshop.
j "Let's Go" should he a Rood
book. In tin' IntndH of another an
thor, il might have clicked. In its
present slate, ii misses I lie frothy
effervescence necessary to this
type of light fiction quite el'f'ec
lively.
Ilut.li has good material, but ii is
badly bundled. To be successful, a
novel of plot and action must, like
a good stage farce, get off to a
| swift, start, hit the high spots,
j avoid loiifc explanations, and above
all, keep up the tempo. The diti
! logue should snap, be sweetened
j and brightened by well-timed wise
i cracks.
! "Let's Go" lias none of these
prerequisites. The opening is very
I slow; practically one-third of the
hook is spent in explanation of
background material. This exposi
tion is necessary to motivate the
I story, but ii could have been boiled
1 into one elm pier. Any facts left
| over could very easily have been
disposed of by occasional reference
i in the progress of the plot.
i After things do begin to pop,
they sound like wet firecrackers.
The love interest, is very artificial
1 and, although there is a perfectly
good reason for it.and il helps the
plot along very materially, ii seems
extraneous. The tempo is entirely
too slow, the conversation is un
convincing, and the style at limits
reaches the depths of dime novel
; iniquity.
As for the plot, it concerns two
l sailors, a girl (but. only ONE of
them is in love with her, my dears),
j several millionaires, a newspaper
[reporter, and the fastest boat, in
the world, the "Let's Go," a slim,
trim craft which goes 10.3 miles an
hour when it is merely loping
! along, according to our cialcula
| tions. Sandy, who invented tlie en
| gine and designed the boat, tries
desperately to gel several speed
, demon bankers to back him, but
! they all hoot and jeer. Therefore

[Sandy turns pirate. With llie help
of lii.s little boat, he can slip up
to one of the millionaires' yachts,
grab llih bankroll, and be far away
before anybody realizes anything
has happened. After leading every
one a merry chase for a few days,
lie lias the moneyed Shy locks eat
s ipg out of his hand. Then lie be
> comes a hero for having rescued
'one of the Wallstreeter's family
I from ;i sinking yacht, arriving on
the scene of the catastrophe almost
| before the radio message is out.
| And ho Sandy gets pardoned, gels
the money, and gels the girl.
Okeh if you're not particular how
! you kill lime, —L. It.

{YOUNG EAGLES-—At the New
I Stanford Theatre.
A smooth, sweet romance, gar
! Dished with a couple of air duels
"that keep your eyes open, and
I topped off by some clever "We're

! served tip lo you in this aviation
thriller.
i The young hero right at the start
I brings down the German ace in a
(spectacular battle in the clouds.
! Then it is the German ace's turn,
i and in a battle equally spectacular
- or rather identically spectacular,
I the handsome Hun triumphs over
| the brave American. My iliis time
i they are the best of pals.
Young Eagles is a nice 'piece of
; war hokum. Charming Jean Arthur
| is such a clever spy that you don't,
j find out until the end of the pic
ture whether she is working for
j the Germans or for the Allies. She
has them both fooled. And Buddy
Rogers looks as boyishly attractive
as ever except in his aviation
helmet which simply ruins him.
Hut (lie performances in the air
duels are really good, both from
a dramatic ami technical stand
jpoinl, while many smash-ups. and
