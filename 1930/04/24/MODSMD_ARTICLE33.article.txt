j children in 1918, the Stanford Con
valescent Home is caring today for
45 convalescent children which arc
I sent down from San Francisco un
der the supervision of the Stanford
! Hospital.
i Although the Home has a capa- i
city for 80 children, there arc now
only 20 in the bed unit and 25 run
: a bouts. The old Stanford home is
used for the bed unit, and the new
Auxiliary Board unit which was j
I recently completed is used for the j
run-abouts.
Besides the Stanford house and ;
; the Auxiliary Board unit, there are ;
the McLaughlin and the Babeock
j units. On Labor Day a year ago i
1 the cornerstone was laid for the 1
i newest unit. This building is now i
, complete with an up-to-date school i
room where the children have J
regular hours, a small dentist of-j
flee, and a large ward. In the base- '
menl a miniature gymnasium lias ;
been fitted out.
Formerly children were sent to |
the Home for a period of one week. |
This time lias been extended from I
a week to a month, three months,!

and indefinite periods. The chil
dren are now kept until they are
well enough lo return to their
homes. In most cases I his time is
less than a year.
All types of cases are sent to the
Home: children needing a special
diet, those who are convalescing
from operations, anemic children,
and others. There is a separate
ward for those who have been
there only a little while, and the
