BRING ON THE TROJANS
Those in (-lose touch with the
Stanford track and field squad can
not avoid the conclusion that al
least a fair percentage of Mr. Tein
pleton's hoys give only a very in
finitesimal damn just how badly,
if at. all, they heat the Husky
spikes!ers day after tomorrow af
ternoon. This apathetic mental at
tilude extends also to the P.A.A.
meet on the following Saturday,
one gathering the impression that
there would he few tears shed hy
the Cardinal athletes should St. Ig
natius or the Italia Virtus Sporting
<'luh collect a plurality of the
points.
This deplorable situation results
not from any wearying of tramp
ing down the cinders, leaping
through the ozone, or hurliny im
plements of various size and de
scription through space but from
an ardent desire to revenge their
sole defeat, administered some
weeks ago by Coach Dean Crom
well's educated Trojans.
Two opportunities for the Cardi
nals to enjoy the always pleasant
feeling arising from watching
Southern California place second
loom in the California intercollegi
aies, which, hy the way, contrary
statements notwithstanding, will he
held at the Stanford Stadium on
Friday and Saturday, .May It; and
17, and in the 1.C.4-A. at Boston
on May 30 and 31.
And in both of these gatherings
chances of the Redshirts to taste
revenge are excellent. Although
the team as a whole will receive
considerable aid in achieving their
ambition to tak more points than
the men of Troy from California
javelin, distance, and hurdle stars
who should cut heavily into the
Trojan monopoly of these events,
a number of individual scores re
main to be settled without outside
assistance.
Virg Dowel], for example, si ill
retains grave doubts that either
Air. Caul or Mr. Harbor of Crom
well's crew, particularly Mr. !3ar
her, is honestly superior to him as
a broad-jumper. Howell's team
mates, "Hutler and West, too, are
loath to believe that the Trojan
jumpers could ever do it again. ,
Podge Smith, considering the
matter calmly and without the
nervous strain of carrying a whole
track meet on his shoulders, ar
rives at the conclusion that since
he tied Mr. Welch in the high
sticks, and later tied California's
captain, Pogolotti, in the lows,
there is no real reason why he
shouldn't exert himself a trifle
more and beat the two of them in
both hurdles races.
Johnny Parker, hard-working ;
two-miler, has been figuratively
kicking himself for the past, two -
weeks because he didn't wear out
Air. Daniels before the latter pulled
his inspired final sprint. If either
Mr. Daniels, Mr. Patterson, or Mr.
Fitzmaurice, leading exponents of j
tin! Trojan practice of passing out
at the close of every race, ever i
again manages to run more than a ;
mile against the Cardinal athlete,
John will make no mistakes on that
occasion. —Hob Van Etten.

Air. Caul or Mr. Harbor of Crom

captain, Pogolotti, in the lows,
there is no real reason why he
shouldn't exert himself a trifle
more and beat the two of them in
both hurdles races.
Johnny Parker, hard-working ;

kicking himself for the past, two -

Air. Daniels before the latter pulled
his inspired final sprint. If either
