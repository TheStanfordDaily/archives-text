## Herbert "Shucks" Pruett, Southpaw Pitcher Known as "Babe Ruth's Nemesis," Joins N.Y. Giants 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Tlio addition of the man once
known as "Babe Ruth's Nemesis"
1 it/the pitching stall' of I lie Giants
gives tlie New Yorkers three star
| southpaws in I'ruett, Walker, and
Hubbell, but will not entitle the
McGrawites to any cheering at the
I expense of Col. Rapport's $S0,0U()
beauty, unless the two New York
teams meet in the next world
series, Herbert "Shucks" I'ruett
may be poison to the Bambino, but
i< remains to be seen how much
his southpaw slants will mystify
the Messrs. Hornsby, O'Doul, Her
man, Stephenson, Cuyler, Waner,
and so on. Hut at any rate Pr.uett is
a hard-working young man who
may win a lot of games for the
Giants, and the fact that he once
fanned Ruth eleven out of the first
thirteen times that he faced him,
and that when he was just out of
Missouri University, makes him all
the more interesting.
Pruett pitched for the Browns in
1!)22, '2M, and '24, with Oakland in
11)2") and '2ii, and the Phillies in
1927 and '2S. Last season he joined
the Newark Club of the Interna- j
tional League in June, and at the
time he quit in September lit l i
ranked first among that circuit's j
pitchers in earned run rating, and
second in won and lost percentages.
All this time baseball, to I'ruett, â– 
has been a means of earning money
to enable him to study medicine, j
He has been a student at Rush I
Institute, Chicago, and at Wash-|
ington and St. Louis universities, j

and lasl winter engaged in clinical
I work in various' hospitals in tin*
| Mound City.
liiih will pitch for the Giants at
{least one year, that is, if he can
' contribute substantially to the suc
cess of the McGraw cause, and,
; after about one more year of study,
will tack an M.I), onto his name,
1 hang out his shingle, and cpiit
baseball for good. Pruett does not
understand why tlx; Giants, who
i waived on him along with 14 other
| major league clubs, in 1028 when
the Philies sold him to Newark,
should now want him back at a
nice salary. But he has looked
good in almost all his spring train
ing appearances, and now, at '
| twenty-nine, he is, perhaps, on the
I threshold of his greatest season.
I rather imagine some National
League clubs are going to need u
jdoctor this season after Herbert
'Pruett, the former Missouri Tiger,
gets through with them.
