# Student Conduct Commendable Say Stanford Deans In Reports
## 
### 
That. (Ik; conduct of Stanford
students generally is commendable
is the gist, of reports by tlie Com
mittee on Student Affairs, and the
Dean of Men and Dean of Women,
released yesterday.
But spring was the season for
such misconduct which occurred
last year, reports Dean of Men
George B. Culver.
"The autumn and winter quar
ters proved unusually free from
disturbing factors of student mis
conduct," Culver's message said,
"but tlie latter part of Ilie spring
quarter revealed several group and
, individual situations which were
j exceedingly troublesome."
i Dean of Women Mary Yost re-
I vealed no misconduct on the part
j of the "500" during the last colle
i giate year.
"Hell week" was briefly discussed
by the Dean of Men's report as fol-
I lows:
"Unsatisfactory conditions at
j Stanford in connection with 'hell
week' are not widespread, but they

are bad enough to demand the at
tention that should come from
proper publicity and discussion,
j especially by fraternity alumni.
"During the year one fraternity
man and one club man were, prop- j
i erly, so resentful concerning the,
low moral tone of some of the cere
monies preceding the more formal
exercises that they refusd to pro- j
ceed with the affair, and fell it,
(their duty to lay the matter before
this office."
| Culver, in discussing student
health, said: "Homesickness among
i students is a much more real and
j vital concern than most of us
i realize. One of its alleviations is
lan occasional visit as a guest in I
| some real home. . . . Personally, I
find that entertaining students in
one's own home is a matter of far
reaching benefit and importance. It
'is a custom which 1 wish were !
i somewhat more in vogue, for I be
lieve il would prove of mutual bene-!
1 fit both to the hosts and their
| guests."
