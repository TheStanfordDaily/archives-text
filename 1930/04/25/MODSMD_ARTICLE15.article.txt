# NORTHERN CALIFORNIA DUE FOR TOTAL ECLIPSE MONDAY MORNING
## 
### 
Beginning at 10:58 Monday morn
ing ;i 11 (1 lasting until II :')♦!, portions
of California extending in a line
about JIOOO feel wide from the
Coast just north of Mt. Tamalpais
to the eastern boundary at Honey
Lake will be in partial darkness as
a total eelipse easts a shadow over
that area.
In the vieinity of Palo Alio, the
eclipse will not approach closer to
totality than 9S per cent; however,
the shadow will last, for nearly an
hour, according to information
Kiven out at the office of Professor
S. 1). Townley, of the department
of astronomy.
The Lick Observatory lias set up
instruments at Comptonville, which
is on the line of the shadow, in
order t«> get photographic results
of the phenomena. Since the pain
of the shadow cyn be allocated
wit.li accuracy only up to IftOO feet,
the cameras will be plaeed at the
vertices of a huge triangle in such
a way that at least two of the
cameras will be under the total

shadow. Excellent, results are ex
pected, according to the informa
tion given out.
While the total shadow crosses
California, in about eight minutes
traveling ai the rate of Mo miles]
per minute, the moon will cover j
i part of the. surface of the sun for |
1 a period of approximately an hour. [
j The path of the eclipse starts sev-j
j <«ral hundred miles southwest of I
j San Francisco and leads northeast-|
I erly across California near Napa, I
' Marysville, and (irass Valley.
In collaboration with the astro- I
I nomical observatories, Captain A. 1
!W. St evens, with the Army Air |
| Corps, now stationed at Sacrumen-1
| to will attempt to photograph the
eclipse from an altitude of 15,000 '
|or 20,000 feet. Stevens is noted fori
I his remarkable success In aerial i
i photography. Frequently, the cone!
of the shadow falls in reach the j
| earth and the higher altitude
| should provide excellent results, ac
i cording to Brigadier General Wil
liam E. Glllmore, in charge of the
Air Corps at Mather Field.

of California extending in a line
about JIOOO feel wide from the
Coast just north of Mt. Tamalpais
to the eastern boundary at Honey
Lake will be in partial darkness as
a total eelipse easts a shadow over
that area.
In the vieinity of Palo Alio, the
eclipse will not approach closer to
totality than 9S per cent; however,
the shadow will last, for nearly an
hour, according to information
Kiven out at the office of Professor
S. 1). Townley, of the department
of astronomy.
The Lick Observatory lias set up
instruments at Comptonville, which
is on the line of the shadow, in
order t«> get photographic results
of the phenomena. Since the pain
of the shadow cyn be allocated
wit.li accuracy only up to IftOO feet,
the cameras will be plaeed at the
vertices of a huge triangle in such
a way that at least two of the
cameras will be under the total

shadow. Excellent, results are ex
pected, according to the informa
tion given out.
While the total shadow crosses
California, in about eight minutes
traveling ai the rate of Mo miles]
per minute, the moon will cover j
i part of the. surface of the sun for |
1 a period of approximately an hour. [
j The path of the eclipse starts sev-j
j <«ral hundred miles southwest of I
j San Francisco and leads northeast-|
I erly across California near Napa, I
' Marysville, and (irass Valley.
In collaboration with the astro- I
I nomical observatories, Captain A. 1
!W. St evens, with the Army Air |
| Corps, now stationed at Sacrumen-1
| to will attempt to photograph the
eclipse from an altitude of 15,000 '
|or 20,000 feet. Stevens is noted fori
I his remarkable success In aerial i
i photography. Frequently, the cone!
of the shadow falls in reach the j
| earth and the higher altitude
| should provide excellent results, ac
i cording to Brigadier General Wil
liam E. Glllmore, in charge of the
Air Corps at Mather Field.
