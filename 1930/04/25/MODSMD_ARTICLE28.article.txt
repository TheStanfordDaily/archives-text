# PLANS DISCUSSED FOR COMBINING ALL CHARITY CAMPAIGNS
## 
### 
The Charity Drives Committee,
appointed by the Ex Committee to
discuss plans for combining iill the
charity appeals made on this cam
pus into one large, concentrated
drive, met last, night with lid ward
Jones, chairman, in charge.
Several possible plans were
brought up for consideration. Ii i
felt, that because a great deal of
the student's time is wasted in the
many drives that are conducted
during the year a single large con
tribution, which would be divided
among the various groups, will
solve the problem. Representatives
from the Convalescent Home drive,
the Red Cross, the Tuberculose
Seal drive, and the L.W.C.A and
the Y.M.C.A. gave reports.
The members of the committee
are Hetty Alden, Betty Clarke, Rob
ert Clarke, and James Bednar
