# A 						LOCK-OUT TRAGEDY
## 
### 
I lie stringent lock-out rules imposed upon Stanford women
were responsible for another near fatality Wednesday evening.
A freshman girl lies terribly injured today in the Palo .Alto
hospital; her escort missed a similar fate only because of some
whimsy ol chance. Their demolished automobile is a piece of
worthless junk, after having carried them to the verge of destruc
t ion.
All this because Stanford women have learned that those who
stay awav from their living quarters after the prescribed time are
subject tc» no uncertain penalty.
This Stanford man and this Stanford woman were hurrying to
the campus to avoid the consequences of a lock-out. The hour was
10:15; Koble 1 fall must be reached hv 10:30. The consequence
was hurry—and ahnost death.
Wednesday night's near tragedy is not the first which has re
filled in similar circumstances. Hardly a quarter passes but some
Indent driver, racing camptisward to save his companion from the
dreaded lock-out, meets disaster.
Mecause none of these have been fatal, no real steps are taken
to relax the stringency of existing regulations, and to evolve a more
reasonable and human system. Wednesday's was only one case out
of many; only one mishap out of many mishaps.
Wednesday afternoon two changes were made in the women's
lockout rules' at a meeting of Women's Conference. These minor
shifts are a step in the direction of reasonableness : a step away from
\ ictorianism.
I Jut they are only a small step.
( an'i some change be made that will end this situation?
The Daily does not advocate the abandonment of women's reg
ulations altogether. I Wen though sane and desirable, such a move
would be out of the question in the light of existing conditions, hard
and fast conventions, and accepted custom.
Uut surely it is not out of the question to ask that, some sort of
a compromise be reached whereby the unreasonable 1 :30 and 10:30
rules can be stricken from the code, and more rational hours sub
stituted for them.
It goes without saying that such a move would not altogether
eliminate this business of hurrying to the campus at the of life
and limb. As long as theVe is a deadline at all, there will be those
who are tardy. Uut such a move would eliminate a considerable
amount —even eliminate by far the greatest portion of these lag
gards. ' .
Stanford's women's regulations are, compared to the regulations
at women's colleges, very'liberal. Uut it hardly seems necessary
for the 1) a 11, y to point out that Stanford is not a women's college.
The Daii.y is not going to add up the merits of freedom by non
regulation and freedom by regulation. They seem only too clear.
'I here must he a happy medium.
What ihe Daily would like to point oui is that Stanford on one
hand is extending academic equality to its women students and on
the other hand is extending social inequality.
I uesdav evening members of A.W.S. meet for their annual in
lallation of officers. This question should furnish ample food for
thought at that gathering.
