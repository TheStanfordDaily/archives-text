# THE 						GREATER STANFORD

tanford spirit is an intangible clement of the University's life.
It rises and falls with Stanford events. It rings in the cheers on
the football field, and it floats into the sunset fire with the echoes
of the hvnin. Il is revealed by such symbols as the Axe and the
Bonfire, and il calls men and women home to Stanford after they
have scattered over the four corners of the globe.
One of the finest examples of real Stanford spirit that has been
seen for many months occurred on the campus last Saturday when
Mrs. Herbert Hoover, with characteristic graciouancss, opened her
home to the returning alumni of her class. Coffee was served to
the ninety eighters on the high terrace of the Hoover home, and
was followed by a class meeting permeated with the same loyal
pirit that prompted the first lady of the land to entertain her class
mates.
To those who have been in Washington and experienced the
I loovers' hospitality and friendliness, this act of Mrs. Hoover's may
come as 110 surprise. The President and his wife, as someone has
ii aptly put it, have carried the spirit of Stanford into the White
House, and all the members of the vast and growing body of the
Stanford family find a cordial welcome under the Hoover roof.
Undergraduate life i> filled with excitement and forms the basis
of many glowing "tales of the good old days" in later years. Under
graduates often think that they are leaving their college days forever
when Commencement comes. In truth they arc leaving the scene of
their college life to take their places in the larger group of Stanford
men and women over the world whose thought ever wander back
to the arches of the Ouad and its red tile roofs. This larger group
is made up of Stanford people who love the University and in whom
the spirit is ever warm and responsive. It is this spirit of the greater
Stanford that is so beautifully exemplified by the recent gracious
hospitality of Stanford's most honored daughter.
