GOOD BYE TO ALL THAT — By
Robert Graves. Jonathai/Cape
& Harrison Smith. New York.
1930.
True to the idea in the tide of
( his uutobiography, "Good bye in
; All Thai," Robert (Jraves says,
j "Tills is a story of what 1 was, not
■ vvlial I am." An<l Willi this retro- I
, spective vii'W lie (ells much more
' clearly than in his uncouth and "in- j
creaaingly crabbed" verse what :
manner of man lie has been, and
what sort of world he has inhab
' ited.
j German on his father's side and
Saxon on his mother's, (lie now
thfrty-lhree-year-old Graves lells of
the boy Graves who grew up to be |
shy, awkward, and independent, un '
popular at school because of his
dislike of authority and "unwil
' lirigness to conform to gentlemanly
i t radit ions."
Tie finished school at C.barler
house and was lo enter Oxford in 1
October, lie was not eager to go. j
! War broke out. and so he enlisted. ;
The discipline wits stiff; gradually !
Graves learned to conform and was j
accepted us a. "good, il not particu !
iaily smart soldier." Severe wounds !
1 by a shell led to his being reported
"died of wounds" bill ;it the time !
of the Armistice lie was in iOng
land in command of a camp at i
Khyl.
The year l!il!t found Graves mar j

rit'd and living in a cottage at tlie
bottom of John Masefleld's garden
in the midst of a pout-war poets'
colony. And finally he went to Ox
l'ord. Hnt the Graveses were very
poor: four children were horn ami
"il took time to learn to he provi
dent." Once T. E. Lawrence, a close
friend, shut out Hie wolf from the
home of t.lie young poet l>y sending
him a copy of his "Seven Pillars
of Wisdom" marked "Please sell
when read," which brought over
:H)(> pounds. Then followed several
moves, including a brief sojourn
in Egypt.
Last May Graves and his wife
jiarted. The book ends with an epi
logue to Laura Hiding, with whom
he is now in partnership in the
Seizin Press. The epilogue lias
neither Hie directness, or explicit
liens of the rest of the autobio
graphy.
For, indeed, (he story I old is ex
traordinary not. so much for the
eveuts as for its manner "cool, de
taclied, straightforward." From Eng
land comes noise of tumult, as the
hook is read -tumult brought on
imil only because of the revelations
of "things that are not talked
about" but more for the calm de
tachment, hard to separate from
irony, "with which Graves has re
viewed such sanctities as the Eng
lish code of the gentleman, both in
the public school and in its child,
the officers' mess." B. |~ B.
