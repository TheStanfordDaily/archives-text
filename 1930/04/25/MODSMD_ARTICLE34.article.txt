Carrying nut the Eating Clubs'
recently proposed plan to make
Stanford safe for Democracy, we,
in all sincerity, propose to go even
further. Our contribution to this
noble ideal is that the Stanford
Eating Clubs be granted exclusive
room rights to the fourth and fifth
floors of Encina, llall. This will
make possible a close, brotherly
spirit among the members of the
aforementioned clubs. The simple,
homelike surroundings will realize
their purpose—Democracy. The lo
cation will afford tint members bet
ter opportunity to extend the bond
of brotherhood to those freshmen
unaccustomed to eating club ideals.

humbly call to your attention these
numerous advantages of the fourth
and 11 fMi floors of Encina as against
exclusive rights in Toyon. If your
