PRAYER AT TWILIGHT
(To be hummed softly through
the adenoids)
God, give me women that are
bright,
Or dumb, or mediocre;
And will) complexions dark or
light.,
Or brown, or even ochre.
Since I love Love, and Love is
blind,
I know that I could love 'em;
Ood, give me women . . . any
kind . . .
Rut give me plenty of 'em.
â€”Darrel Amyx.
