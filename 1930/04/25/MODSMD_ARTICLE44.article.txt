A TRIFLE PREVIOUS*?
While the West Coast's track ex
perts are vieing with each other
iri unanimously awarding the IC4A
title for this year to either Stan
ford or Southern California,
one might do well to remember
that the East will also have a team
or two entered in the intercollegi
ate classic at Boston next month.
To be sure, no squad from the At
lantic Seaboard figures to outscore
either of the Wests leading en
trants, there are luminaries in
track and field events returning to
the scene of conflict to make it de
cidedly interesting.
The aforesaid exports are look
ing forward avidly to the next
meetings of Frankie Wykoff of
CSC and our own Hec Dyer, in lite
California intercollegiate* and the
Eastern meet, where they will de
ride, to all intent, the sprinting
championship of the nation.-
In the heat of argument they
overlook one or two slight, details.
First, a, certain Mister Wildermulh
of Georgetown, and a certain Mr.
Kent, of Colgate .will he among
those present at the Eastern meet.
Wildermuth led Dyer to the tape
in the century last year, and Kent
fliil the same thing in I lie furlong,
incidentally stepping the distance
in 21.1 seconds while doing so. To
add to the festivities, Daley of
Holy (Toss, one of the top flight
sprinters of the country, who took
third behind Dver in flu* 1929 hun
dred, will also he on deck.
Then there is the matter of the
quarter-mile. Bowen oC Pittsburgh,
last year's winner in 48.4, will toe
the starting mark once again, as
will St. Clair of Syracuse and
Swope of Dartmouth, third- and
fifth-place winners respectively.
The West expects to cut a wide
swath in the point column via the
hurdle events, but are seemingly
oblivious to the fact that McCoy of
Pennsylvania, third-place winner
in the highs, and Kieselhorst of
Yale, victorious in the lows in the
1929 meet, will again be on hand.
As for Ihe distance events, the
half, mile, and 2-mile, where South
ern California, at least, hopes#to
score, seven out of 15 point-win
ners are to run again this year,
hast year only one Westerner, Car
tel- of California, was able to get a
place, and that a fourth, in those
events.
The field events seem to he a
trifle more favorable to the Pacific
Coast, although Hedges of Prince
ton and Berlinger of Penn, who
finished one-two in the high jump, i
will compete once more. The jave- j
lin was swept, by the West last
year, and three of the five place- |
winners, Churchill and Curtice of
California and Mortensen of Troy,'
return. Krenz and Rothert of the j
Cards will of course be on hand,
and so will Paul of USC and Dow- j
ell of the Cards, who took third j
and fourth, respectively, in the j
broad jump. But the hammer throw
will of course go to the East, Paci- j
tie Slope athletes beinn' unfamiliar ,
with t li e event, and the pole vault-,
ers, ,Edmonds, Sturdy, and Wil
liams, are gone, leaving the field j
an open one. The West should and j
probably will win the affair,, but
it seems a trifle previous to award I
it to I hem in April .
