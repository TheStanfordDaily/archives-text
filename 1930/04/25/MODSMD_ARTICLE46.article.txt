# Cardinals Face Washington
## TOMORROW'S TILT PROMISES TO BE CLOSE ENCOUNTER Morrison On Injured List; Anderson Definitely Will Not Run 
### Bob Van Etten 
I Hearing every appearance oi
{ what is known in sporting cicrles
'ms ;t "notural," the Husky-Cardinal
| truck tilt will get under way in the
1 Stanford Stadium tomorrow after-
J noon al 2 o'clock.
The Huskies, 22 of I horn, looking
i;i fine shape, and determined to
demonstrate that their railroad
j fares were not paid in vain, arrived
i at Palo Alto yesterday afternoon.
' Only Captain Steve Anderson,
' speedy hurdles champ, appears nn
| able to compete. Anderson, shortly
| before leaving Seattle, turned his
ankle on a soft spot on the Wash
j ington track, and some sort of a
I miracle will he required to put the
i Husky captain in condition to run
i tomorrow.
Morrison Out
Five certain points for Stanford
faded into thin air with the news
that Johnny Morrison, stalwart
Cardinal quarter-miler, will in all
probability he unable to run against
Washington. Morrison pulled a
muscle in practice Wednesday af
ternoon, but did not realize the seri
ousness of his injury until exam
ined by the doctor yesterday.
Absence of Morrison from com
petition should both make the meet
more close and add Ihe 440 to the
list of featured events. Talbot Hart
ley, leading Washington quarter
miler, was doped by his teammates
to give Long John a real battle,
and may be able to nose out Shove
and Hables to take a first .
Duel in Sprints
Real competition for Hec Dyer
looms in the 220 where Pendleton
is expected to fully press the
blonde Redshirt. Pendleton has not
run up to expectations this year,
but last year broke the tape in 21.1
seconds in the furlong.
A lot of attention will be directed
toward Paul Jessup, giant Husky
weight man, who is out to upset
the Rothert-Krenz monopoly in
both shot and discus. Jessup is
credited with practice marks of
51'9" and 159 feet in the two events
respectively, distances which would
make the Cardinal duo hump to in
sure wins in their pet events. The
presence of Jessup places the three
leading college weight performers
in competition, and the winning
marks may easily be new world's
records.
With Anderson not running,
Podge Smith will still find some
thing of a battle on bis hands to
dispose of O'Neill in the high hur
dles and Whiting in the low sticks.
Whiting in the Washington-Califor
nia meet tied Pogolotti for second
in the long race.
Mile Conceded
Rufe Kiser, already conceded the
mile, will attempt to complete a
good day's work by breaking the
tape in the 880. Kiser should run i
1:58 or better in the half, a time
which will win for him unless
Cooper continues his steady im
provement. Gonsechi and Mantle,
two other Huskies who are sup
posed to be able to run two laps
in less than 1:59, will make things

interesting for Cooper and -Atkin
son as well as the spectators.
.Just what Cram and Haynes,
Washington two-milers, can do on
an outdoor track is not known, lint
inasmuch as they have covered this
distance 011 a 220-yard indoor oval
in close to ten minues they ought .
to give Parker and Nunes some
thing of a workout.
Coach Edmundson brought his
22 spikesters to the stadium yes- '
terday afternoon in order that they
might acquaint themselves with the >
Stanford oval. Another light work
out will be held by the Huskies 1
sometime today. Complete satisfac
tion with .the track was expressed
by the Washington squad, although
the gale sweeping down the
straightaway came as an unpleas
ant surprise. J

Duel in Sprints
Real competition for Hec Dyer
looms in the 220 where Pendleton
is expected to fully press the
blonde Redshirt. Pendleton has not
run up to expectations this year,
but last year broke the tape in 21.1
seconds in the furlong.
A lot of attention will be directed
toward Paul Jessup, giant Husky
weight man, who is out to upset
the Rothert-Krenz monopoly in
both shot and discus. Jessup is
credited with practice marks of
51'9" and 159 feet in the two events
respectively, distances which would
make the Cardinal duo hump to in
sure wins in their pet events. The
presence of Jessup places the three
leading college weight performers
in competition, and the winning
marks may easily be new world's
records.
With Anderson not running,
Podge Smith will still find some
thing of a battle on bis hands to
dispose of O'Neill in the high hur
dles and Whiting in the low sticks.
Whiting in the Washington-Califor

in the long race.
Mile Conceded
Rufe Kiser, already conceded the
mile, will attempt to complete a
good day's work by breaking the
tape in the 880. Kiser should run i
1:58 or better in the half, a time
which will win for him unless
Cooper continues his steady im
provement. Gonsechi and Mantle,
two other Huskies who are sup
posed to be able to run two laps
in less than 1:59, will make things

interesting for Cooper and -Atkin
