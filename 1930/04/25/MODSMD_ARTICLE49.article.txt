# SPEEGLE PREDICTS END FOR STUDENT ROOTING SECTIONS
## 
### 
That rooting sections will sooi
disappear and college enthusiasm
'will be paid for at the gates ol
bigger and better stadiums is the
gist of an interview of Paul Spee
gle, Stanford yell-leader, published
in the San Francisco Call-Bulletin
last night.
"I can't see how rooting section*
can last much longer the way
things are going now," Speegle i.«
reported to have said. "The grow
ing popularity of football and its
commercial value, combined with
tlx l enormous alumni association
members are eventually going to
force the students right back into
, classes."
Speegle is quoted as saying that
j yell-leading is the "toughest job
on the campus" as the rooting sec
tion is quick to find excuses tc
■ razz the leader. The article states
1 that Speegle received his "biggest
thrill leading the 'Axe' yell at the
; impromptu rally the morning after
the trophy had been tear-bombed
away from California."
