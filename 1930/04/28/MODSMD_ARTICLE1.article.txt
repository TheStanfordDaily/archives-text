I niversity, petition the President
of the A.W.S. to call a women's
assembly immediately after the in
stallation banquet, on Tuesday,
April 211, tor the purpose of sug
gesting modifications which would
place the lockout system on a more
reasonable basis."

in the women's regulations at pres
ent provides that all houses of
residence for women shall close at
