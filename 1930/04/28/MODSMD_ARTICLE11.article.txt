## Sperry, Soloist, Displays Range; Novelties Are Well Received 
### John Jernegan 
Before a very small but appre
ciative audience the Stanford Glee
Club, assisted by Austin W. Sperry,
guest soloist, presented "what was
announced as its last Home Con
cert Friday night in the Assembly
Hall. Gaining much applause in all
three sections of the well bal
anced program, solo, club ensem
ble, and novelty skits, the club
members did some excellent sing
ing and presented music of a high
order.
The club ensemble scored hits
with its rendition of Forsyth's "Old
King Cole," a humorous piece made
more effective by some action, and
the finale from"The Gondoliers"
by Sullivan. "Passing By," a charm
ing love song by Purcell, and "Mai
den Fair, O Deign to Tell" by
Haydn were delightfully rendered,
and were well received by the
audience. Schumann's "Die bei
den Grenadiere" was given with a
great deal of spirit.
Sperry Soloist
Presenting an unusual type of
song in "Quand le Roi part aux
combats" by Koeneman, Austin W.
Sperry, baritone soloist, displayed
good range and volume. His ability
was even more marked in his last:
two numbers, "Eri tu clie macchia
vi" by Verdi, and "Pregunte a las
Estrellas" by Hague, the latter be
ing particularly popular with his
hearers.
The most popular part of the pro
gram, judging by applause, was
the Cardinal Quartet composed of
Ralph Wallace, George McKee,
Adelbert Culling, and John Hune
ktj.. Comical pieces such as one
about the "Monkey and t lie Ba
boon's Sister" and an imitation of
an old-style phonograph record
tickled the audience's sense of
humor and brought the singers
back for encores. Other novelty
numbers were a violin quartet,
Steven Barrett, Frank Lee, AV'il
liam Poynter, and Robert. Sutro,
and tap dancing by Leo Matesky
and Fred Peatman.
