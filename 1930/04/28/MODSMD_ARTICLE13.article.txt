# TOTAL ECLIPSE COMES AT TEN THIS MORNING
## Airplanes To Be Used To Aid In Securing Exposures Many Observatories Send Expeditions 
### 
Preparations for photographing
1 lie total eclipse which occurs in
California this morning have as
sumed the aspect of carefully
planned military operations in
many respects. Airplanes, cameras
(hat look like machine guns, and
tents have been assembled in parts
of the state where the path of to
tality passes.
Along the path of the eclipse
shadow which extends from the
coast of California just north of
Mt. Tamalpais across the state, in
a northeasterly direction toward
Honey Lake, there may be found
the observation camps of Lick Ob
servatory, IVTt. Wilson Observatory,
Johns Hopkins, Allegheny Ovserva
tory, and others.
About 1') o'clock, Pacific Stand
ard Time, a dark notch will appear
on the western edge of the sun.
This notch will grow in size until,
about an hour later, the sun will
be nearly or quite obliterated, ac
cording to the observer's position.
By noon, the sun will be complete
ly clear, according to the calcula
tions of the observers. At Palo
Alto, totality approaches 98 per
cent, and in San Francisco, 99 per
cent.
Use Smoked Glass
Those who expect to view the
eclipse are warned to use smoked
glass or heavily clouded camera
film to prevent injury to the deli
cate tissues of the -eye. Even 1)9
per cent totality leaves enough
light exposed to cause injury to
eyes, if some protection is not used,
according to astronomers.
Every picture secured of the
corona which appears over the rim
of the moon contributes to the evi
dence sought in connection with
the constitution of the corona.
Heretofore, little has been definite
ly determined concerning the com
position of the sun, although spec
troscopic study has shown that in
addition to the familiar compon
ents of aiu, there occur gaseous
iron, aluminum, calcium, and other
metals. The intense heat of the
solar globe precludes the possi
bility of existence of any of tlie
elements known on the earth in
S( did form.
Working on the Theory of sun
spots, meterologists from the Uni
versity of Santa Clara have pre
dicted that the eclipse will occur
when the sky is cloudy. In an ef
fort to overcome such a difficulty,
airplanes from Mather Field have
been secured to carry observers
and cameras to a height of 20,000
feel to procure records of the
eclipse. It is admittedly difficult to
he in just the right position to
secure good exposures, when the
shadow travels at the rate of 25 or
30 miles per minute; but any
['banco is worth taking when it is !
estimated that another eclipse of j
Die nature of the present one will :
not occur for at least another bun-!
lied years.
