# THREE GOOD OPINIONS, AND TRUE

Is it possible that the world is becoming convinced that col
legiana is not another name for torrid nether regions?
I hnrsday the Daily reported the opinions of three well <juali
fied observers ol American college youth; and all three pointed out
that the men and women in universities are essentially- law abiding
;ind good citizens.
(ieorge iHiss Lnlver, Stanford's dean of men; Miss Mary Yost,
dean of women here; and Dean Thomas Arkle Clark, of the Uni
versity of Illinois, are the three in question. Surely no trio could In*
Jonnd better equipped to plumb the depths of student moral con
ditions.
Dean Culver, in his annual report, indicated that conditions,
dunng the past year, had been generally satisfactory. Dean Yost
revealed no misconduct on the part of the "500" during the last
collegiate year.
Dean ( lark, of Illinois, knocked a prop or two from under crit
ics of collegiate youth with the following statement: "We admit that
some students drink at Illinois, but we contend that they make more
fuss about it than their predecessors, and that the drinkers are not
only fewer in number but are less harmful to themselves and others.
I lie students are merely reflecting their home environment and there
is admittedly some violation of the liquor law in the nation ; this is
also true of schools."
You could, of course, take these opinions and add to them ten
tunes ten thousand other opinions of a similarly valid nature, and
till the righteous critics—whose knowledge of college comes ex
clusively from a perusal of Ihe l'lastic Age —will go right on
crit ieizing.
lint if such opinions are broadcast long enough they are bound
to sink into a few thick skulls.
