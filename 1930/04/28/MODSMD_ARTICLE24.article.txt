# BIGOTRY AND JINGOISM
## 
### 
'\ lie League of American L'en W omen has stepped forward now
to take its place alongside the D.A.R. and the Ku KJux Klan.
Religious bigotry and jingoism are discouraging anywhere, in
this so-called age of advancement: hut they are more than discour
aging in such an organization as that of the women writers.
It seems that politics and religion were allowed to step into the
League of \merican l'en Women, forcing withdrawal of Kathleen
Xorris from the race for the national presidency. Mrs. Xorris, a
C atholic and a noted advocate of peace, was the subject of an
anonymous letter to the League, and has declined to run.
Ouite rightly Xorthern California branches of the League have
registered a vigorous protest against this monstrosity. The League
was organized for women who have distinguished themselves in the
literary field. It is both ridiculous and unjust to permit either poli
tics or religion to enter its affairs.
The fact that writers, as a class, are supposed to he markedly
liberal makes the whole situation seem impossible. In.the interests
<>112 democracy and toleration, the League should make haste to rec
tify this blunder.
