# THE 						RACE THAT NEVER ENDS

### 
In lliis era of speed and competition the modern press peers into
every nook and cranny of the world in search of that lucrative
something called news.
Rear Admiral I'yrd, recently returned from South Pole explora
tions, was exceeded in lines of newspaper space during 1928-30 only
by the President of the I'nited States. For more than two years
the Xnv York l imes carried daily stories on the activities of the
iivrd expedition. Forty-seven other newspapers published similar
reports.
The return of I'yrd heralded careful preparations by all news
agencies concerned. All wanted to score a "scoop." Several mil
lion readers must he shown pictures of the man about whom they
had read during the last two years. Byrd was photographed as he
stepped ashore at Duncdin, \.Z. The mad dash was on.
Pictures were taken by ship to Cristobal, flown to Honduras, to
Miami, and from there to New York. First to reach Manhattan
was an Associated Press motorcyclist bearing the precious photos.
And early the next morn an anxious world was greeted by "ex
clusive" photos depicting an intrepid explorer coming ashore from
his ship.
