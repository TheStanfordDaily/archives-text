PRIVATE LIFE OF LADY HAM- i
ILTON. By Albert Flament.
Louis Carrier & Co., publishers. |
At the Stanford Bookstore.
In depicting the life of Lady i
Emma Hamilton, Flament lias i
painted a glorious picture of this
woman whom Romney called the
"Dfvine Lady." Her career was as
rapid as the resplendent rise and
fall of a skyrocket leaving a trail
of shimmering sparks in its wake.
Her glorious adventure reads like
a novel. The author with his (inely
chosen phrases has made of her a
very real person instead of a vague
character out of the pages of his
tory.
To think that a humble daugh
ter of a lowly English blacksmith's
daughter could rise to the rank of
wife of the ambassador from Eng
land to the Two Sicilies and, by i
the grace of her close friend, j
Queen Maria Carolina of Naples, I
and by tin* power of Admiral Nel- j
son, become queen and mistress of
the Mediterranean —is scarcely be
lievable. But added to a great
beauty she had a fine voice and a
talent, for assuming attitudes which
charmed all who saw them. It is
evident that she had insurmount- '
able courage and skill in learning j
tricks of speech and charming j
ways which would advance her in
the eyes of those she deemed vital I
to her career. As Flament, so aptly >
put it, "She loved painting because |
she loved herself and because j
painters had always sought her :
out."
She was an adventuress, it i? !
true, and she caused the greatest j
scandal in all Europe by her flaunt- ,
ing of Nelson's wife on their tri
umphal return to England, in which J
her own aged husband, Sir William ;
Hamilton, was calmly dropped into !
the background. But her interven- i
tion and power with the Queen of j
Naples saved the English fleet. She
was adored by the British sailors
throughout their expedition in the 1
Mediterranean against this little j
obscure officer. Lieutenant Bona
parte, who through his genius and
courage was becoming more of a I
menace each day. And it was rec- j

| ognized by everyone that thid love
! ly creature w;is the inspiration aid
j mistress of Nelson, this ambitious
j man sprunK from small beginnings.
Flament characterized her thus,
j "Emma rapidly acquired a kind of
celebrity among these youths who
dreamed of glory, these old men
who had not known how to attain
it. They came to study her face,
to go forth then and dream of her
a little and attempt to capture on
canvas or in their writings some
i reflexion of her guileless eyes in
| whose depths was mirrored the
mystery of deep waters."
In writing of the two renowned
lovers, Flament spoke of them ;is,
"These two adventurers of the
sublime were worthy of each other.
They played the game which
makes and breaks the careers of
men."
Then Trafalgar came and the
j heroic death of Nelson cut. off the
I years of happiness the skyrocket
i began to fade arid disappear from
sight.
"The Private Life of Lady Ham
ilton," which is a translation from
the French, is a beautifully done
biography. Its descriptions of the
well-known characters and the set
tings in which they moved are very
| fine. With c lean deft, strokes, with
(artistic mastery of the psychology
jot' the heart of woman, Albert Pla
j ment has drawn against a color
i ful background (lie picture of this
j woman among women.

LADIES LOVE BRUTES—At the
New Stanford Theatre.
Just why ladies love brutes of
, the George Bancroft type we can't
say, or rather won't say.
j A triangle with children to com
: plicate the situation isn't exactly
(novel. Those who like thrilling se
quences and"he" men will no doubt
jbe able to appreciate the encoun
j ters of George Bancroft with gang
sters and meanie contractors.
Mary Astor is sufficient reason
'for a triangle, and Frederic Marsh,
' as her husband, further occasion.
You may enjoy this show. There
! are worse ways of spending two
i hours. —B. P.
