The Editor, Sir:
It is about time to call attention
to several lamentable occurences
that happen all too frequently in
I the balls. The practice embraces
i all of the living groups but being
| interested only in Toyon Hall I
shall limit myself to it.
1. Too much damage is (lone to
| the hall by certain irresponsible
i students.
'2. Too many gramaphones and
radios are left running after 8:30.
3. Too many d â€”n fools drink too
j much and raise hell when the rest
i want, to work.

4. Too little interest shown by
the committee in bringing the
above offenders into line.
Therefore I suggest that these
imbeciles be kicked out of the Hall
and deprived of their room rights;
a little backbone and intestinal
fortitude is required by ihe Com
mittee, but make one example and
the rest would come to time.
Everything to the contrary some
lof us ARE here to study; we pay
for our rooms and we expect the
i other men in (he hall to behave like
gent lemen.
Yours truly, John R. Uplon.
