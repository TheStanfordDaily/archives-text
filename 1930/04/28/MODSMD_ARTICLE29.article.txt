# A 						TRIBUTE TO SWEETNESS AND LIGHT
## 
### 
' Thp Editor, Sir:
Your correspondent' with a few
other men went to the women's
debate the other evening hoping to
be highly amused at the rostrum
I antics of the opposing feminine
j speakers. But. to our dismay, we
found that, the debate was entire
j ly different from what we had an
ticipated. We found that the girls
j had no use for drinking-water; re
i sorting instead to the inhalation
'of their corsage of roses whenever
' ihey needAd mental inspiration. We
(discovered too that, in keeping
| with such esthetic surroundings,
i they handled tlie entire subject of
Women, Marriage, and the Home
with a vitality and delicacy that
dwarfs the recent efforts of most
of our masculine debaters. The only
description tit, for these excellent
speeches seems to be Matthew Ar-
I nold's well-abused phrase—Sweet
ness and Light.
With (he formation by Mr. Emer

son of the Stanford Debating
Union on the celebrated Oxonian
plan and with the recent revival
of I lie women's debating organiza
tion, Wranglers, l lie Campus can
expect from now on excellent de
bates from both sexes. It is to be
hoped that more members of (lie
student-body, as well as their
friends from Palo Alto, will see
that it is worth their while to at
tend these debates. What enjoy
ment the Stanford Roughs would
have experienced tlu j other eve
ning when they heard the two
charming Stanford speakers en
thusiastically reply, "Most, women
at Stanford, including ourselves,
want to get married!"
Since it is only fair to pay trib
ute where tribute is due; this bit
ter is written in appreciation of
this splendid work done by the
women debaters and their coach,
Mr. Hen Duniway.
Sincerely yours,
A Mere Male Debater.
