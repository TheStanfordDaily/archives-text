# GONE, BUT NOT FORGOTTEN

The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford Glee Club lins made
its farewell appearance on the
Stanford campus. As ('. Albert Kall
mann, director, pointed out at the
concert Friday evening, an organ
ization which receives no financial
support from the University cannot
afford to make appearances on i lie
campus when the net return is a
deficit.. Last year the club's home
concert was attended by only a
handful; this year there were
scarcely 200 people in the audi
torium, counting ushers and urtists.
ll is difficult to understand the
i apathy of the campus community
toward the glee club. Friday's eon
■ cert was far superior to a number

of programs given before capacity
audiences in the Assembly Hall
and Pavilion by tired-out. Metro
politan. stars with sore throats.
Even the presence in the chorus
of a member of the famous Twentv-
Onc failed to attract an audience.
Therefore the glee club is through,
so far as we on the campus are
concerned. In the future we shall
have to go to San Francisco to hear
them. But at least they will be
mourned, by the 200 if by no one
else; and the sad part of it all is
that I lie great majority of Sinn
ford residents will never know
what they have missed by letting
this organization slip out of the
life of the campus.
