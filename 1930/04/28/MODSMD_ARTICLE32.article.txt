A TALE OF SALTY WISDOM
J Once, as I wandered by the sea,
i Reflecting deeply, silently,
' I saw an aged sailor there,
i Perched 011 a rock all bleak and
bare,
I On which incessantly lie sat,
And sat, and sat, and sat.
| He did not move, he did not stir,
- And (other tales with mine concur)
In nothing else was he bedight
j Except his heard of snowy white;
Yes, clothed in nothing else but
t hat,
He sat, and sat, and sat!
He seemed to me exceeding queer,
if not plain daft., that wild-eyed
seer,
i That strange old man upon the
rock:
1 Why was it that, as if to mock
The elements, that madman sat,
> And sat, and sat, and sat?
At last my curiosity
: Became so great it conquered me;
Alas, I simply could not bear
1 To leave that old man sitting there
Without inquiring why he sat,
And sat, and sat, and sat.
So then, with visage set and
g r i m,
I resolutely asked of him
By what fell fortune, chance, or
fate
lie had been forced, till soon or
late,
Clothed in his nakedness, to sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit.
He grinned at me, and then lie
laughed;
(That made me certain; he WAS
daft!)
He shrugged his shoulders with a
wink,
And asked me, "Well, what do you
think?
Can't you imagine why 1 sit,
j And sit. and sit, and sit?"
In ignorance 1 shook my head.
"Since you're so curious," he said,
"I'll make a bargain: if you guess
I'll give you twenty dollars . . . ves,
If you can tell me why I sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit.
"But if you fail, then you agree
To pay the same amount to me.
And I, in turn, will let you know
The secret which intrigues you
so . . .
That is, the reason why I sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit."
I made affirmative reply,
(Then withdetermination I
Bethought me long and learn
edly . . .
But could not, for the life of me,
Discover why it. was he sat,
And sat, and sat, and sat.

At. six o'clock 1 knew no more
Than I had known six hours before.
I gave it up. "You strange old man,"
I said, "Please tell me, if you can,
The reason why it is you sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit."
The old man's reason, it appears,
Was that for five-and-twenty years
He'd made his living betting fools
Like me, and other simple tools,
That they could not guess why
he sat,
And sat, and sat, and sat.
I went away a wiser lad;
He'd gypped me out of all I had.
We learn to mind, from all such
snares,
Our own, not other folks' affairs,
And not go asking why they sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit.

Discover why it. was he sat,
And sat, and sat, and sat.

At. six o'clock 1 knew no more
Than I had known six hours before.
I gave it up. "You strange old man,"
I said, "Please tell me, if you can,
The reason why it is you sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit."
The old man's reason, it appears,
Was that for five-and-twenty years
He'd made his living betting fools
Like me, and other simple tools,
That they could not guess why
he sat,
And sat, and sat, and sat.
I went away a wiser lad;
He'd gypped me out of all I had.
We learn to mind, from all such
snares,
Our own, not other folks' affairs,
And not go asking why they sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit.

A TALE OF SALTY WISDOM
J Once, as I wandered by the sea,
i Reflecting deeply, silently,
' I saw an aged sailor there,
i Perched 011 a rock all bleak and
bare,
I On which incessantly lie sat,
And sat, and sat, and sat.
| He did not move, he did not stir,
- And (other tales with mine concur)
In nothing else was he bedight
j Except his heard of snowy white;
Yes, clothed in nothing else but
t hat,
He sat, and sat, and sat!
He seemed to me exceeding queer,
if not plain daft., that wild-eyed
seer,
i That strange old man upon the
rock:
1 Why was it that, as if to mock
The elements, that madman sat,
> And sat, and sat, and sat?
At last my curiosity
: Became so great it conquered me;
Alas, I simply could not bear
1 To leave that old man sitting there
Without inquiring why he sat,
And sat, and sat, and sat.
So then, with visage set and
g r i m,
I resolutely asked of him
By what fell fortune, chance, or
fate
lie had been forced, till soon or
late,
Clothed in his nakedness, to sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit.
He grinned at me, and then lie
laughed;
(That made me certain; he WAS
daft!)
He shrugged his shoulders with a
wink,
And asked me, "Well, what do you
think?
Can't you imagine why 1 sit,
j And sit. and sit, and sit?"
In ignorance 1 shook my head.
"Since you're so curious," he said,
"I'll make a bargain: if you guess
I'll give you twenty dollars . . . ves,
If you can tell me why I sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit.
"But if you fail, then you agree
To pay the same amount to me.
And I, in turn, will let you know
The secret which intrigues you
so . . .
That is, the reason why I sit,
And sit, and sit, and sit."
