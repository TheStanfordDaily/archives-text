With the winding up of spring
sports except for a few track meets
and some rip-snorting barnyard golf
tussles, football again becomes
the topic of the day. Sundry ques
tions of which team lias ilie best
prospects, what's the schedule of
games, and who is returning, fill
the air.
Prominent among teams that
"Pop" Warner's stalwarts will meet
in the fall, and perhaps the most
formidable foe the Cardinals will
face will he the University of South*
era California. At least the game is
sure to draw a full stadium. The
Itedshirts will be on the warpath
to avenge the 10-0 and 7-0 defeats
handed out by the men of Troy in
the last two years, and the South
erners will battle just as hard to
hang up their third straight tri
umph.
More than 100 men turned out
in answer to Coach Howard Jones'
call for spring practice three weeks
ago but the squad is now down to
50. Thirteen lettermen are retu, n
ing, taut only three regulars: Arbel
bide, end; Pinckert, half; and
Shaver, fullback. The other eight
all graduate, and then there are
ten first-string reserves, all letter
men, that have played their last
game for Troy.
Jones faces his hardest task in
rebuilding a line. Tappaan, an All-
American, and Steponovich ar.e
gone from the Hanks, leaving Arbel
bide a cinch for one post, and Wil
cox, Sparling, and Jnrich to battle
for the other. Jim Stewart, a new
man with plenty of speed, may see
action.
Anthony and Ho If, regular
tackles, are lost, with Bob Hall and
Tay Brown, a sophomore, left as
leading candidates for tlx; posi
tions. Armistead and Plaehn, of the
1933 squad may also grab posi
tions. Regular guards Barrager and
Galloway will he missing, Bak?>r,
their place-kicker, and Gentry or
Shaw remaining as the likely pair
to start games next autumn. Big
George Dye is gone from the pivot
position, Williamson alone standing
out to take over the job.
Saunders, Edelson. Mortens&n,
and Hill played their Inst game
against Pittsburgh, but Jones is
not worried over his backfield. He
has a sweet combination in Duf
field, Aspit, Pinckert, and Shaver, (
and there's Musick, Mallory, and
Moses to fill out. Orv Mohler, quar
terback, and Kirkwood, half, of
last year's freshman squad, are the j
best prospects for the backfielti 1
from the yearling crop.
Just 13 lettermen back —will that j
prove to be Troy's wooden horse?
Warner has 17 lettermen back, only
4 more, but the Cardinal squad ap- (
pears better balanced. The* Trojans •
have a gold mine in the backfield,
but the line looks weak with little
reinforcement in sight. Out of IS
missing lettermen, 11 are linemen.
But Papa Jones and the Adminis
tration have an uncanny way of
finding football stars, and somehow
or other, S.C. will probably be
right in the money when Septem
ber 15 rolls around.
Mr. Jones, by the way, is taking
no chances of balling up a title as
he did last year by scheduling hard
games with Stanford and California
one week apart; this year he has
them well-spaced. The Trojans
start the season on September 27
and play U.C.L.A., Oregon State,
Washington State, snd Utah Aggies
in succession. Then comes the Stan
ford tilt on November 8. Hawaii
playes them the next Saturday,
then a week of rest, ending up with
Washington on November 29. and
Notre Dame on December 6. Ail
games will be in the Coliseum ex
cept the Troy-Card clash which is
scheduled for the Stanford stadium.

Warner has 17 lettermen back, only

Mr. Jones, by the way, is taking
no chances of balling up a title as
he did last year by scheduling hard
games with Stanford and California
one week apart; this year he has
them well-spaced. The Trojans

YACHT RACE WiNNER
SAN FRANCISCO, April 27. (/P)
The power yacht Sevelyn entered
by Paul F. Johnson of the Balboa
Yacht Club, tonight was declared
winner of the Long Beach-San
Francisco race for the Sir Thomas
Upton trophy.
With the winding up of spring
sports except for a few track meets
and some rip-snorting barnyard golf
tussles, football again becomes
the topic of the day. Sundry ques
tions of which team lias ilie best
prospects, what's the schedule of
games, and who is returning, fill
the air.
Prominent among teams that
"Pop" Warner's stalwarts will meet
in the fall, and perhaps the most
formidable foe the Cardinals will
face will he the University of South*
era California. At least the game is
sure to draw a full stadium. The
Itedshirts will be on the warpath
to avenge the 10-0 and 7-0 defeats
handed out by the men of Troy in
the last two years, and the South
erners will battle just as hard to
hang up their third straight tri
umph.

in answer to Coach Howard Jones'
call for spring practice three weeks

their place-kicker, and Gentry or
Shaw remaining as the likely pair
to start games next autumn. Big
George Dye is gone from the pivot
position, Williamson alone standing
out to take over the job.
Saunders, Edelson. Mortens&n,
and Hill played their Inst game
against Pittsburgh, but Jones is
not worried over his backfield. He
has a sweet combination in Duf
field, Aspit, Pinckert, and Shaver, (
and there's Musick, Mallory, and
Moses to fill out. Orv Mohler, quar
terback, and Kirkwood, half, of
last year's freshman squad, are the j
best prospects for the backfielti 1
from the yearling crop.
Just 13 lettermen back —will that j
prove to be Troy's wooden horse?
Warner has 17 lettermen back, only
4 more, but the Cardinal squad ap- (
pears better balanced. The* Trojans •
have a gold mine in the backfield,
but the line looks weak with little
reinforcement in sight. Out of IS
missing lettermen, 11 are linemen.
But Papa Jones and the Adminis
tration have an uncanny way of
finding football stars, and somehow
or other, S.C. will probably be
right in the money when Septem
ber 15 rolls around.
Mr. Jones, by the way, is taking
no chances of balling up a title as
he did last year by scheduling hard
games with Stanford and California
one week apart; this year he has
them well-spaced. The Trojans
start the season on September 27
and play U.C.L.A., Oregon State,
Washington State, snd Utah Aggies
in succession. Then comes the Stan
ford tilt on November 8. Hawaii
playes them the next Saturday,
then a week of rest, ending up with
Washington on November 29. and
Notre Dame on December 6. Ail
games will be in the Coliseum ex
cept the Troy-Card clash which is
scheduled for the Stanford stadium.
