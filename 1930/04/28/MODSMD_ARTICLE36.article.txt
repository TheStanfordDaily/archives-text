# Card Trackmen Rout Huskies With 96-35 Score
## REDSHIRTS MAKE 5 CLEAN SWEEPS, 11 FIRST PLACES Krenz Bests Washington Giant Discus Tosser In Close Duel 
### 
Just a snarl, a baring of a fang
or two, and the Husky threat was
ended as Stanford's track and field
team turned back the invaders
from the north by a score of 96-35 j
j in the Stadium Saturday afternoon. |
But not without causing more i
I than one scare was the Washing- |
ton squad routed. Threatening the j
supremacy of World's Champion j
! Fric Krenz, big Paul Jessup, Husky j
j weight king, treated spectators to I
i a discus-tossing duel never before j
I equalled. In this battle of giants,
Jessup placed only three
feet behind the Cardinal captain's!
1 til-foot 7%-inch toss, which in turn j
was but two feet short of his world j
record mark. All of the Husky's J
throws reached the 1 oil-foot mark
I or beyond, while Krenz got off a
! second toss which raised dust from
the 160-foot line. Rothert placed |
third at 141 feet 5 inches, twenty j
l'eet short of the winning distance, i
Shot Put
Putting the shot 50 feet BV6 I
! inches, far enough to win nine out I
I of ten meets, Jessup could gather I
only a third place in the cannon |
ball tossing event. Krenz again j
nosed out his northern foe with a J
mark just x /z inch better, made on j
one of his last puts, while Rothert j
clicked through with a beautiful J
toss of 51 feet 4% inches to collect j
his customary five points.
Running exactly the race fitted •
to his style, Ike Hables beat out j
his teammate Maynor Shove by a t
foot to capture the 440-yard event, j
Ike ran easily on the backstretch,
trailing Shove and Hartley by sev
eral yards, and then cut loose with
a beautiful sprint on the final
curve. Hartley, Washington quar-1
i ter-miler who was favored to win I
his race with Johnny Morrison out, j
ran himself out to take the lead
from Shove on the curve and fin
ished a poor third. Hables' time j
of 49.5 seconds was excellent con-1
■ sidering the gale blowing down the
' straight a way.
Nisbet Sits Down
Clean sweeps scored by the Cards !
; in the 100-yard dasfi, low hurdles, •
javelin, polo vault, and broad jump j
presented Washington with a ban- j
dicap too great to overcome. In tlie I
220-yard dash and high hurdles the I
Redshirts would in all likelihood ;
have again collected all three |
places except for the fact that Tem- !
pie ton entered only two men in the I
furlong, saving Howell for there- j
! lay, and ihat Al Nisbet chose the I
: portion of track between the third !
| and fourth hurdles as a spot on 1
which to sit down and view the j
scenery.
Only four first places were avoii '
,by the Seattle spikesters, in the I
mile, half-mile, 2-mile, and high j
jump. Rufe Kiser, the gentleman I
with the "peculiar hip motion, won]
the mile as lie pleased in 4:24.2 j
with his teammate Rhuddy close j
behind. Bob Brown ambled in to i
take third about (50 yards behind i
Kiser. Thirty minutes later the j
Washington distance star returned !
to capture the BSO in 1:57.4 with i
Gonseiche and Mantle making it. a j
clean sweep for the Huskies.
A sprinting finish by Uaynes, who j
broke the tape in 0:50.(1, provided !
what little interest there was in i
the eight-lap grind. Johnny Parker I
could nor cope with, the Husky's!
final spurt, but took second ahead 1
of Cram of Washington.
Hec Dyer and Podge Smith won j
their two races with little diffi- :
culty. Dyer took the hundred in 9.9
followed by Giberson and Howell, i
and ran the furlong in 21.7 with ■
Giberson four yards ahead of Pen-1

dleton, Washington hope. Smith
took the high sticks in 15.3 with
Brugman nosing out O'Neill, while
Smith, Nisbet, and Gordon placed
one, two, three in the low hurdles
with the time 25.1 seconds.
A certain novelty was added to
the afternoon's proceedings when
Stanford swept the javelin and
pole vault. Bramel, better known
as a swimmer, tossed the spear 183
feet 7 inches to capture his event
followed by Goldsmith and Rintala.
Red Berry's J 2-foot, (i-inch vault
won him the bamboo event with
Johns and DeGroot clearing 12 feet
to shut out the Husky vaulters.
Dunn of Washington negotiated
0 feet % inch to take the high
jump with Madison and Allen tying
for second at T> feet 11. All three
