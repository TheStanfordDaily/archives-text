Speaking or Spring,
one simply must have Reis
Jimoants and Jimshirts . . .

If you're an addict of Jimpants and
Jimshirts you will say, naturally, that
one must have them all the year
'round...But we're speaking now to
those chaps who have never experi

colorful, comfortable underwear...
And we repeat, right now is a
splendid time to start the good habit.
