Three Cheers, the Hero!
Joseph Doke is here pictured as he sauntered off the field one
memorable November day in 1898. Joe scored three touchdowns
and his perspiry mustache was twitching with pride as he realized

Mustaches may no longer be in vogue, but the same spirit in Stanford
athletics and other activities still prevails. In line with such, the
Stanford Daily maintains, now as then, a complete carrier service
lo distribute the paper daily on the Campus and in Palo Alto. It is
true thai circulation and the expenses that go with it have increased
eight-foldâ€”but the Daily is proud of the fact that it alone on the
Coast maintains this service.
