# CHINESE BANDITS MURDER 1000 INHABITANTS; LOOT, BURN IN NORTHERN TOWN
## Outlaws Use Machine Guns to Mow Down Residents; Troops of Nationalist Government Unable To Check Widespread Banditry 
### 
I SHANGHAI, April (yP) â€”Bandits armed with machine guns mas
sacred 1,000 residents of Kingsuchen, northern Kiangsu province,
j Saturday, it was learned today. One thousand captives were carried
I off with loot of the city which was burned.
This latest massacre by bandits who have recently slain thousands
in other sections of China took place within 100 miles of Nanking, seat

i>ol' the Nationalist government,
whose troops have not shown them
selves capable of coping with wide
spread banditry.
The countryside about Kingsu
clien was ravaged and peasants
were tortured. Mounted upon
horses, the bandits dashed into the
town, posted machine guns, and
! mowed down the helpless inhabit
ants, afterward looting their homes
before setting tire to them.
Two priests were kidnapped by
brigands who sacked the city of
Sientaochen, fifty miles northwest
of Hankow. The, priests were at
tached to (he mission established
by the Chinese Mission Society of
St. Columbans, Neb. Most of the
personnel of the mission are Irish
born priests. Other priests and sis
ters of the mission were believed
safe, while four American sisters
were reported to have tied to Han
yang.
Hope was felt that twenty-five
foreigners immured in the bandit
besieged c ity of Kauchow were still
safe. A telegram received by pro
vincial authorities at Canton from
the commander of the Chinese de
fending troops asked that "addi
tional forces be sent to assist in
clearing out the reds" who have
surrounded the city for seven
weeks.
