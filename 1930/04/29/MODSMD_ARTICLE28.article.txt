# ACTION AT LAST
## 
### 
Stan ford s lock-out situation is to be aired at last.
\i least it will be aired if a petition, signed by more than 50
eo-cels, is given the serious consideration il deserves.
I he petition, started and circulated in Roble Hall over the
week-end, asks for % the calling of an assembly of women students
alter ihe installation banquet tonight. The purpose of this assem
bly will be to discuss existing conditions and ''bring this growing
dissatisfaction to the attention of the administration."
Jl is good that the women have taken the initiative in this mat
ter. ()nly by open and frank discussion will this matter be brought
lu any definite conclusion.
I he Daily has long believed that the present rules are archaic,
and have outlived their usefulness. And the Daily is not alone,
Slorms of criticism have ever surrounded the women's regulations,
At times this dissatisfaction with the rules imposed on the women
has reached active heights, and in between these periods there has
been a smouldering desire for change. For as many years as the
women have had student government, one of the main objects of
each administration has been the loosening of the regulations. And
the lockout rules remain, firmly embedded in the social scheme of
things, although there have been some slight advances in the last
ten years.
Of course, California had the Axe for thirty-one years—and
the women have been clamoring for a new gym for thirty-nine
years, so in due process of time the Five I lundred may possibly
be rewarded with success.
The 1 :30 regulation should be changed to 2:30. Two-thirty i<
a much more sensible, convenient, and safe time. Jt has all the
advantages of one-thirty with none of its disadvantages. For the
following reasons:
1. Dancing in the city ends at 1 o'clock and by far the greatei
number of one-thirties are taken to go to the city. One-thirty
originally had justification in the days when the students used te
come home on the theater train and the social life tised to hum or
the campus. In the days of Cardinal automobiles, the one-thirty
regulation on week-ends is an actual danger to students' lives.
2. \ 2:30 rule would eliminate the present wholesale staying ii
Palo Alto. The Dean's office is besieged with letters from Pair
Alto people complaining about Stanford women coming in at late
hours, and although such an act is regarded as "against the spirit
of the rules," said "spirit" certainly offers no deterrent to queening
ro-eds.
3. Two-thirty presents a good opportunity to keep the womer
on the campus. One of the main objections to Stanford's socia
life is that it takes the students away from the campus. A 2 :3C
rule would make it possible for the women to come back to Roble
and ihe houses after dates.
4. One-thirty is simply an arbitrary placing e)f a time limit, se
that two-thirty, while just as arbitrary, fits the facts of social life
much better. Two-thirty would simply recognize and make the
most of existing conditions.
5. While the Daily doesn't believe in women's regulations any
way, it realizes that it is impossible to carry out its theories in
practice. "A spirit of equality must be preserved in the Univer
sity," said Mrs. Stanford in her last address to the Board of
1 rustees, and as the Daily pointed out last Friday the University
is handing out academic equality and social inequality to its women
students. There is a relic of Yictorianism and the double standard
in the present regulations which Stanford as one of the most liberal
universities in the country should not tolerate.
There are many objections which will be raised to these reasons
lor change. The administration no doubt has all the reasons for
the present lockout hours neatly catalogued and at its finger tips
from the long period of its opposition to change. A few of the
objections are: the difficulties of locking the houses as two-thirty
is so very late, the presence of two and a half hours after campus
dances, and the disturbances of staying up until two-thirty in Roble.
ihe Daily, while realizing these objections, doesn't feel they are
as valid as the reasons for changing the rules.
There has been a pretty conception of lockout rules as the
champion of the moral tone and morality of the women, but it's
almost too obvious to be mentioned that morality and timepieces
were not created inseparable in the eyes of God. Little Sally can
be just as wicked at two in the afternoon as two at night. The
"dangerous hour" can hardly be determined.
()ne of the greatest reasons for the present regulations has ever
been the anxious worry of parents over their daughters. If the
parents only knew the real and serious dangers attendant on the
driving down the highway to make lockout rules, they would be
only too eager for change. A mother of a senior woman said re
cently that she hoped she never heard of her daughter racing to
make Palo Alto e>n the crowded highway by 1 :30. In this instance,
it might be well to remember that the administration recognizes the
true situation on I »ig flame night and extends later leave for that
occasiefli.
It is high time for the 1 :30 regulation to go the way of all
antiquated rules. Two-thirty is more sensible, more convenient,
safer, and has all the advantages with none of the disadvantages
of 1 :30. An intelligent view of the situation should make this verv
clear.
Tonight is a propitious time for this discussion. There will be
present Dr. Swain, Dean Mary Yost, arid Miss Betty Alden, the
three individuals in whose hands lies the power to make or break
this progressive move.
