ONE LOVELY MORON—By Lucian ;
Cary. Doubleday, Doran Com
pany, New York, 1930. At the
Palo Alto Bookshop.
"Ono Lovely Moron" is a. high
kicking, last-moving concoction of
cocktails, co-eds, professors, night
clubs, roulette wheels, gangsters, '
and all the rest of the things that \
' the talkies adore. Par from being J
trite, however, these Ingredients
merely add to the tang of this
, highly spiced, bubbling romance
iof youth.
i Of course when Prexie'Berenson,
profesosr of applied psychology, to |
! find out whether his daughter,
Brenda Berenson, was really a
j moron or not, it was Michael's j
'business to find out. Michael was
flit-" person of whom everyone asked
'advice. Michael had told Gudrid and
! Sigrid, Prexie's other daughters, !
) how to get their men. Michael
knew how to calm irate parents !
who thought (lie university was ai
hotbed of crime and sin, love, and
scandal. "Love and scandal are
i synonymous in Minnewaska."
Imagine Professor Torr's elation
'to discover that Brenda is the girl i
he had accidentally shot in the leg 1
while conducting a "controlled ex- :
pertinent" with a revolver-in the
woods; the girl whom lie thought
so intelligent; the girl who thought
it was better "to swear and be i
thought vulgar than to (try and he .
a nuisance that everybody wanted
to send home"; the girl who didn't
' like professors because of their at
titude toward women.
A rather bookish young man,
' Michael had never had much fun.
Even as a child he had been an in
fant prodigy. So when Michael be
gan to have fun, he had it. He
learned to dance; he took Brenda
to a wicked, wicked roadhouse; he ,
i shot his way out. of the mess when
the roadhouse was pinched, and
got. his picture in the paper just
j when the university wanted money
from the state legislature, and lost .
i his job and obtained a better one
and married Brenda.
All old stuff, but quite entertain
ing in this presentation. Lucian
Crary begins at the beginning, ends
j at the end, hits the high spots in
the middle. His style snaps with
the staccato beat of a riveting ma
chine. His characters are all slight
ly niad. The plot is far from brain-1
taxing. In addition, the author
knows his youth. He penetrates be
j neath the frothy flippancies to show
the why and the wherefore, the
philosophy, if you can call it that,
of his characters' lives. Audrey
! expresses things perfectly when
she says, "Mostly you can't tell

.
'older people anything, even when ;
you trust them. Because you have j
to begin with the facts ot' life and j
educate them lo a point, where |
■ they'll understand what you're tell- |
ing them."
A good book to read when you
'want to he amused without much '
| exertion. —L. R.
SONG OF THE WEST—At the
California Theatre, Mayfield.
"Song of the West" pulls things
apart and puts them together again
according to a very old formula — j
| two pals in love with a gal. Rut, j
strangely, il is exactly the type of I
plot desirable in this sort of pic
ture —a dashing, colorful tale of
early days in the West.
John Holes is in much better i
i form t bun usual. He has learned a
j good deal about restraint in acting
| and vice production since "The
Desert Song" and "Rio Rita." No
j where in the picture are we dis- !
turbed by his former theatricality
of gesture.
Joe E. Brown was very amusing, ;
as always. His rendition of "The i
Bride Was Dressed in White"'was
; one of the best shots in the show.
"Song of the West." is good en
j tertainment. It reaches no heights,
descends to no depths, has lots of I
hokum which for once is well
placed, inoffensive. —L. It.
FREE AND EASY. At the Var
sity Theater
l.augli, clown, laugh! is the theme
lof this latest picture of Buster Kea
ton; and have you ever seen Buster j
' laugh } He just can't do it. Instead
lie simply stands there with a miser
ably helpless expression and as final
touch lie closes his eyes in grief. This
is the end, however, and one should
always start at tHe beginning.
The beginning is in a small Kansas
.town. The usual pretty girl wins a
beauty contest and the usual ambitious
mother insists on taking her offspring
to Hollywood to crash into the movies.
I Buster is the manager and he goes
through his usual routine of solemn
falls and unconscious wisecracks.
Buster is really very funny, the '
laugh this time is on the audience. I
Besides Blister has a voice and can !
actually dance in spite o( his ridiculous '
costumes and enormous shoes.
Anita Page is the usual pretty girl ;
and makes a very nice job of it. She
'■doesn't quite break into the movies
but manages lo marry the leading man !
which is almost the same tiling. Her \
large mother and Buster both get cast I
in a fantastical comedy, though, which I
gives us a chance to see some chorus J
girls and hear a few songs. These ,
latter additions do not help the show'
[much.
