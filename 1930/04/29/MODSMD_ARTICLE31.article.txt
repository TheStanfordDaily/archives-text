## A 						JOURNALISTIC ORACLE SPEAKS 
### 
\ The Editor, Sir:
I rise to take exception to the
editorial in Friday's Daily entitled
"A Lockout Tragedy," which as
cribes all responsibility for the
Portola Road accident last Wednes
day to the stringent enforcement
; of the women's lockout regulations.
The inference of the article is
that, the regulations should there
lore be modified.
Undoubtedly both occupants of
the demolished car were fully
aware of the; 10:30 rule when they
left the campus. They knew ap
proximately ihe hour at which they
i would have to leave from their
, destination in order to return in
time. For some reason they either
j chose to delay or were delayed,
i They also knew when they started
| out. what the consequence of viola
tion of the dead-line rule would be.
I They knew that justifiable tardi
ness due to causes entirely out of
■ their control would be dealt with
leniently; that the worst penalty
l that, could be dealt, the girl would
be temporary suspension of privi
leges.

' This is not the first occasion
when the Daily lias laid responsi
bility for early-morning accidents
to the lockout rules. It would he
just, as logical to condemn theatri
cal performances for commencing
promptly because ticket-holders are
sometimes killed in the rush to get
there on time.
Regardless of the respective
| merits of rigid as against, lenient
regulations for women students, it
I is apparent (hat the Daily must use
I a sounder line of argument and one
| more presentable to the college
public if its words are to be read
i as anything but a series of empty
j ravings. The Daily must give its
} readers credit for somewhat less
| susceptibility to editorial hooey
I than Mr. Hearst considers Ameri
can readers in general to have.
I think the student -in the street,
if you Avill permit me, views the
I Daily's latest outburst merely as
! an attempt to ballyhoo an alleged
j "cause" in which not even the prin-
I cipals concerned are sufficiently
interested to act.
