ODDS AND ENDS
Offering a most pleasant diver
sion to students weary of planing
their noses to tin* grindstone in
preparation for customary mid
quarter examinations, the tennis
division of Stanford's hard-working
physical educationTiepartment: pre
sents the annual mixed-doubles ten
nis tournament.
As is indicated in another column
of this paper, all students regis
tered in the University during
spring quarter are eligible. This
concession opens the lists to var
sity racquet-wielders, freshman
squad placement-shot artists, and
women court game champions, with
fast and scintillating tennis to be
expected as the finals are ap
proached.
Apparently determined to leave
their marks in the annals of Car
dinal sports history before collect
ing the vigorously pursued sheep
skin and departing hence, Stan
lord's linest, the reputed high and
mighty Seniors, are well on their
way toward walking orf with inter
class athletic honors for the fiscal
year 1929-150.
Present standings of the four
classes show the graduate-elects
well in the lead with 18 points,
followed by the lowly frosh with
13 markers, the juniors with 11 !/•»,
and the sophs holding undisputed
possession of the cellar with r*
meagre 9J/2 counts.
Should the senior soccer satel
lites, who devoted yesterday after
noon to taking in the yearling in
terelass hopefuls 2-0, knock over
the winner of the junior-sophomore
hoot fracas, a possibility l'ar from
improbable, they will rank as
mathematical chanfpions for this
year.
For five points added to their
present 18 would give the degree
takers a total which the freshmen
would be incapable of equalling,
even should the first-year men win
top honors in tennis, the final event
on the interclass sports program.
American National Game
Baseball, which, according to Don
Marquis, noted author, originated
in Ireland in the Dark Ages with
(lie first world's championship be
ing played between King Arthur's
Camelot White Sox and Timothy
O'Meara's Dublin Athletics, ap
pears on the downward slide for
lair.
Either that, or else the far-famed
Stanford roughs have degenerated
into a bunch of tea-drinking parlor
athletes who are thoroughly famil
iar with the intricacies of contract
bridge but don't know a bunt from
a fungo.
Certainly intramural baseball, ex
pected to be one of the most, hotly
contested events on the yearly
sports program, has turned into a
farce of the first water.
Of 52 games scheduled to date
30 have been forfeited, with an in
crease in the number of defaults
occurring each week. Twenty-twc
of 52 games played amounts to a
percentage of .423, a fair batting
average in any league, but nothing
at which point with pride as an
expression of the relation between
games played and games defaulted,
Of 32 teams entered in competi
tion, 15 have yet to play a game.
Either Stanford living groups are
populated with men who automati
cally duck at the crack of a bat
on a hard hall, or else the disinter
ested spirit which looks on non
chalantly as ihe Cardinal baseball
varsity concludes its fourth con
secutive series with California
without winning a game is rapidly
reaching the very core of the grand
old game.
