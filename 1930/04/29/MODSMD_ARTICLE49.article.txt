# Card Trackmen In P.A.A. Meet
## HEAVY SCHEDULE IS ENTERED INTO BY STANFORDITES Dyer-Sweet Sprint Duels Will Be Feature Of Saturday Meet 
### Bob Van Etten 
Having conclusively slaved off
the attack of the Washington Hus
kies on the home grounds, Stan- ',
ford's track and field team will
seek new fields to conquer this Sat
urday afternoon when they journey ,
to Sun Francisco to compete in the
Pacific Athletic Association meet
at Kezar Stadium.
A consideration of the meet
schedule entered into by Coach 1
"Dink" Templeton's ambitious 19:!0
track squad leaves one with a
strong impression ol' similarity be
tween the Cardinal track program
land the choice list of opponents
ordinarily selected by Notre
Dame's football eleven. Four meets
in four weeks is something of an
assignment for even a squad of
spikesters fortified with such con- ,
! sistent and work-loving performers
las the invaluable Messrs. Krenz,
Rothert, and Dyer.
Featuring the necessarily light
i workout of the Redshirt trackmen
! yesterday afternoon was a bitterly
fought shot put ting duel waged be
tween Herb Fleishhacker and Here
Laßorde, hefty freshman weight
man. Under stimulus of competi
-1 tion plus unusually deep interest
j on the part of Coach Templeton
| both shotputters heaved the iron
! ball beyond the 40-foot mark, with
Laßorde winning by a few inches.
While plans for the P.A.A. meet
on Saturday have yet to emerge
i from their present highly unsettled
[condition, it would appear that
I Stanford's c hief competition will
come from the Olympic Club. Stan
i ford already holds a decision over
I the clubmen, gathered in an early 1
season meet and, despite the im
proved condition of a number of
I Charley Hunter's athletes, notably
Edwards, Ward Edmonds, and Rus-
I sell Sweet, the Cardinal stands an
I excellent chance of repeating.
Hopes of importing Frank Wy
kolT. Southern California speedster,
! from Los Angeles to compete un-
I attached in the sprints having
fallen through, interest in the
! dashes will center on the Hec
Dyer-Russell Sweet duels. Dyer, on
performances this year, is a heavy
favorite to cop both races, and un
less he gets lost in the dense fog
j which frequently settles about Hie
! Kezar oval, Hector should win ten
! points for his alma mater.

urday afternoon when they journey ,
to Sun Francisco to compete in the
Pacific Athletic Association meet
at Kezar Stadium.
A consideration of the meet
schedule entered into by Coach 1
"Dink" Templeton's ambitious 19:!0
track squad leaves one with a
strong impression ol' similarity be
tween the Cardinal track program
land the choice list of opponents
ordinarily selected by Notre
Dame's football eleven. Four meets
in four weeks is something of an
assignment for even a squad of
spikesters fortified with such con- ,
! sistent and work-loving performers
las the invaluable Messrs. Krenz,
Rothert, and Dyer.
Featuring the necessarily light
i workout of the Redshirt trackmen
! yesterday afternoon was a bitterly
fought shot put ting duel waged be
tween Herb Fleishhacker and Here
Laßorde, hefty freshman weight
man. Under stimulus of competi
-1 tion plus unusually deep interest
j on the part of Coach Templeton
| both shotputters heaved the iron
! ball beyond the 40-foot mark, with
Laßorde winning by a few inches.
While plans for the P.A.A. meet
on Saturday have yet to emerge
i from their present highly unsettled
[condition, it would appear that
I Stanford's c hief competition will
come from the Olympic Club. Stan
i ford already holds a decision over
I the clubmen, gathered in an early 1
season meet and, despite the im
proved condition of a number of
I Charley Hunter's athletes, notably
Edwards, Ward Edmonds, and Rus-
I sell Sweet, the Cardinal stands an
I excellent chance of repeating.
Hopes of importing Frank Wy
kolT. Southern California speedster,
! from Los Angeles to compete un-
I attached in the sprints having
fallen through, interest in the
! dashes will center on the Hec
Dyer-Russell Sweet duels. Dyer, on
performances this year, is a heavy
favorite to cop both races, and un
less he gets lost in the dense fog
j which frequently settles about Hie
! Kezar oval, Hector should win ten
! points for his alma mater.
