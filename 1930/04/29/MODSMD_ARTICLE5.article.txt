# "SOL" SUFFERS TOTAL ECLIPSE
## Students Travel North To Path Of Totality 
### 
While scientists ' were anxiously
awaiting rifts in the clouds over their
carefully selected observation points,
! the "Daily" eclipse party took advan
tage of clear skies at a point some 50
| miles northwest of Sacramento yestcr
j day to witness the total eclipse of the
I sun.
Leaving the campus at 5 o'clock in
| the morning, the "Daily" observers ar
' rived at 9 o'clock in the vicinity of
I Yolo, which point was chosen by
J chancc. A half hour was spent in
| reconnoitcring for a vantage point,
J and with a few minutes to kill, they
I returned to Woodland for breakfast,
j To observe the "ripple shadows" which
j are seen on white surfaces in the path
lot* total eclipse only, a member of the
j party "picked up" a napkin from the
coffee shop.
Kcpiippcd with Woolworth dark
I glasses which had to be smoked, they
] returned in time to sec the first star
j appear in the leaden sky. Chickens in
i the nearby barnyards went to roost as
| the black shadow of the total eclipse
j swept over the Sacramento Valley at
j nearly .30 miles a minute.*
As the shadow approached the ob
| servers, the hills beyond it grew light
j again. At the moment of total eclipse,
j the phenomenon could be watched
j with the naked eye and the corona was
plainly visible surrounding the outline
of the moon. Almost immediately, the
I crescent of solar lijjit reappeared on
j the opposite side and the shadow sped
lon toward the Sierras. Absorbed in
! watching the eclipse, the amateur ob-
I servers forgot to look for the ripple
shadows on the pilfered napkin.
As the countryside regained its nor
â€¢ mal aspect, a rooster crowed, and
j motorists who had stopped to watch
! the eclipse threw awaj their smoked
(glasses and film negatives and went on
j their way.
