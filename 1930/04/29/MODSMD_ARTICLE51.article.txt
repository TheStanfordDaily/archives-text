# SPEAKING OF HOMERS...
## Chuck Klein, Outfielder of the Phillies, Threatens Babe Ruth's Record; Ott Also Out to Cop Title 
### Feg Murray, '16 
About 3,000 years ago their lived
a blind poet who has been de
scribed more than once as the
"First Sports Writer." When I
mention his name —and it; was
Homer —you will readily see what
connection he has with Messrs.
Ruth, Klein, Ott and Co. The word
"Homer" probably means nothing
hut a 4-base wallop to many ball
players and fans, but the ancient
Greek of that nam:', whose stories
of stirring bouts between the
Greeks and Trojans of old have
never been surpassed by modern
fight writers, wrote a bit about a
ball game, too, although there was
no actual mention of a circuit clout
i in the story, in the Odyssey, the
blind bard sings of a game.between
Princess Aanagalla of Corcyra and
her handmaidens, in which "Tost
and retost, the ball incessant flies."
But now to get down to the busi
ness at hand. Chuck Klein, 24-year
old star outfielder of the Phillies,
threatens to break Babe Ruth's

major league home run record of ;
sixty this season. Last year, you j
will remember, Klein broke Rogers j
Hornsby's National League record j
by hitting out forty-three four-base i
hits. Mel Ott, of the Giants, tied j
the Rajah's record, and his New!
York teammates claim that he j
would have beaten out Klein had j
not the Philly pitchers walked him :
the last half a dozen times that;
they faced him. Klein got off first j
in the 1930 home run derby, but 1
Ott soon caught up with him.
Ruth, Klein, and Ott are not j
alone in the quest for homer lion- j
ors. A 1 Simmons, Dale Alexander, ,
| Lou Gehrig, or Jimmy Foxx might ,
surpass the Babe at his specialty, !
while Hack Wilson (who hit seven- j
ty home runs in 1928 and 1929 to- i
getlier), Lefty O'Doul, and Hornsby (
himself can he counted on to fur- |
nisli lively competition for Klein
and Ott. Hornsby has hit 27S bom- i
i ers (not counting 1930), while!

About 3,000 years ago their lived
a blind poet who has been de
scribed more than once as the
"First Sports Writer." When I
mention his name —and it; was
Homer —you will readily see what
connection he has with Messrs.
Ruth, Klein, Ott and Co. The word
"Homer" probably means nothing
hut a 4-base wallop to many ball
players and fans, but the ancient
Greek of that nam:', whose stories
of stirring bouts between the
Greeks and Trojans of old have
never been surpassed by modern
fight writers, wrote a bit about a
ball game, too, although there was
no actual mention of a circuit clout
i in the story, in the Odyssey, the
blind bard sings of a game.between
Princess Aanagalla of Corcyra and
her handmaidens, in which "Tost
and retost, the ball incessant flies."
But now to get down to the busi
ness at hand. Chuck Klein, 24-year
old star outfielder of the Phillies,
threatens to break Babe Ruth's

major league home run record of ;
sixty this season. Last year, you j
will remember, Klein broke Rogers j
Hornsby's National League record j
by hitting out forty-three four-base i
hits. Mel Ott, of the Giants, tied j
the Rajah's record, and his New!
York teammates claim that he j
would have beaten out Klein had j
not the Philly pitchers walked him :
the last half a dozen times that;
they faced him. Klein got off first j
in the 1930 home run derby, but 1
Ott soon caught up with him.
Ruth, Klein, and Ott are not j
alone in the quest for homer lion- j
ors. A 1 Simmons, Dale Alexander, ,
| Lou Gehrig, or Jimmy Foxx might ,
surpass the Babe at his specialty, !
while Hack Wilson (who hit seven- j
ty home runs in 1928 and 1929 to- i
getlier), Lefty O'Doul, and Hornsby (
himself can he counted on to fur- |
nisli lively competition for Klein
and Ott. Hornsby has hit 27S bom- i
i ers (not counting 1930), while!
| Ruth's record is .old.
