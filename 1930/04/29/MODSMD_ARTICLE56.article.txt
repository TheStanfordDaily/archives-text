Heralded as tlio closest and most
nutstanding golf match of the year,
(Varner Edmonds and Malcolm Mc-
NJaughton will tee off at 1:3() o'clock
I his afternoon for the first IS holes
nf their scheduled" 3G-hole match
in tlie Stanford open semi-finals.
Richie Stevenson and Sandy
Thompson are the other pair that
will play in the semi-final flight.
The concluding holes will be played
Thursday.
Greatest interest centers in to
day's and Thursday's match as the
winner will prohably be crowned
king of Stanford's golfers, neither
Stevenson nor Thompson being
considered a match for either of
the other two. By a strange fate
of drawings, practically all of the
best niblick-swingers in the Uni
versity drew places in the upper
bracket, so the winner of the l'ray
will have had no set-ups through
out the tourney.
McNaughton defeated James Ilea
1 up in the 18-hole first-round
matches, and then downod John
Butts 2 and 1 in the 18-hole second
round tilts. Both Rea and Butts are
prominent campus golf men, but
McNaughton scored the most crush
ing victory of the tourney when he
set. hack Stuart Hawley, ranking
freshman and leading qualifier,
and 8.
Edmonds took his first- and sec
ond-round matches from Quint
Wood and Don Clark by scores of
!} and 4 and 3 and 2, respectively.
Then he defeated Herman Hellman,
third ranking man on the Cardinal
squad in the quarter-finals, 4 and 3.
11' McNaughton plays his brilliant
game, undoubtedly he will he up at
the end of today's first half of the
match, but if lie makes anywhere
near the usual medal score of Ed
monds, the lanky Card captain, will
probably finish the day in the lead.
McNaughton holds the course rec
ord with a (if), two under par, but
Edmonds, who has* never broken
75, is considered the most consist
ent; player on the team.
