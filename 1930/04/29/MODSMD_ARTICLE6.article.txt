## 
### 
According to word l'rotn the Palo
J Alto Hospital received last night,
Esther Scott, is allowing slow
'though steady progress in recover
ing from injuries suffered in an
automobile accident last Wednes
day. While refusing to predict liow
long it would be before Miss Scott
would be able to walk again, never
theless considerable satisfaction
was expressed by hospital attend
ants at the progress which had
j been shown to date.
Miss Scott, was injured on Wed
nesday night when the car in which
she was riding collided with a par
tially-concealed telephone pole on
the I'orloia Road. She sustained a
'fractured pelvis and severe (Ills
i and bruises. It was at first thought
that she had also suffered a frac
tured skull, but examination dis
pelled this fear.
