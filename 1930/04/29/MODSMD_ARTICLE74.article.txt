Heed, alias John Bridges, alias Al- I
len Hart, who is being held on a j

the way of the southern authori- (
ties.
A week ago "Brother Bridges" i
arrived on the Stanford campus and 1
went to the Delta Upsilon house
where his knowledge of fraternal
secrets established him as a
"brother." After cashing a $19.50
check at the Stanford Bookstore j
and buying a $50 watch from a
j jeweler in Palo Alto, he made the
mistake of attempting to aid the i
D.U.'s in their rushing. Their sus
picions were aroused by numerous
little inconsistencies in his frater
nity history. Their suspicions were I
confirmed when a member of the i
Delta Upsilon chapter at California '
was introduced to Bridges and re
membered seeing the imposter pos- j
ing as a Delta Tau Delta on the j
California campus. "Brother Bridg- !
es" departed without hesitation.
It was in his activities as a !
"brother" at Oregon State College I
that the "racketeer" was definitely j
found (nit and placed under arrest j
for passing bad checks. !
