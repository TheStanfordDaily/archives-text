# CHINESE ACTOR, FAMOUS FEMININE IMPERSONATOR, APPEARS IN S.F.
## 
### BY PHILIP HUMPHREYS 
When Mei Ban Fang appeared
on the stage of the Great China
theatre at. 63G Jackson street, in
San Francisco for the first, time,
instead of being greeted with en
thusiastic applause of an American
audience, he was met only with a
deep silence. Such is the manner
of according appreciation and re
spect of a Chinese audience.
Mei Lan Fang, probably the fore
most actor of China, is known as
the "idol of five hundred million
people." His chosen line is female
impersonation, and it is in such a
character thai he is appearing in
the city. He came to San Francisco
from New York on April 20.
In the play, the title of which he
would not disclose, Mei took the
part of a wronged woman and gave
the character a genuineness noth
ing short of inspiring. The severe
punishment for infringement of the
strict laws against immorality in
some parts of China, brought the
woman and her lover before the
tribunal, presided over by an in
exorable judge. The court ordered
that the woman be shot by the hand

, of her own lover. The grief-stricken
I father begged and was then grant
ed permission to consign his tiny
child to the same fate us its
I mother's.
In strange contrast with the
American technique of stage pre
sentation is that of the Orientals.
Property men in shirt-sleeves stray
purposelessly about the stage until
they are needed to perform their
various duties. The orchestra sits
on the platform at one end of the
stage in solemn immobility; the
! members smoke cigarette after
| cigarette, and lazily draw a how j
across their stringed instruments, j
Meanwhile the audience sits quiet-j
Hy. |
Americans would never attend a j
theatre to hear drama presented in
a language wliieli they, til best, only (
partly understood. Not so here. j
.This play, written and spoken in
; Cantonese, was presented lo peo
ple, the majority of whose lan
i guage is the Mandarin dialect.
The Great China theatre was
I filled with peopleâ€”men, women,
land children. Mei's fame is strong.
