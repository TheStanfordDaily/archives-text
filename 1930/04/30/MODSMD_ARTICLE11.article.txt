lii spite oL' the fact that the
lockout rules have not yet
been extended, "cactus-garden
ing," as the Women's Council
will have it, and other moon
time activities are in for a bin
night two weeks from now.
Saturday morning—May 17, to
be exact —is the time of the
big blowout when oscillatory
exercises and various clinches
"du col" are scheduled to con
tinue well into the wee sma'
hours before dawn.
All this because for the first
time in history, a campus
dance will last until after 1
a.m. The Ex Committee last
night voted to allow the Jun
ior Prom to continue from!♦
o'clock Friday night, May 10,
until 2 a.m.
