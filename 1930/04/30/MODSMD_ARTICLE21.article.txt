; view given the Daily, stated tlmt
in spite of the non-spectacular re
| suits of the Conference, it undoubt
edly marks a step forward in naval
disarmament, and better world re
, hit ions.
"To many observers of interna
i tional relations." said Sprout," "the
jireaty which has emerged finally
from the London Naval Conference
| confirms to an unfortunate extent
j doubts and skepticism expressed
j even before the conference con
j veiled some three months ago.
"In a word, the treaty provides
| for some reduction in the capital
j ship Btnuigt.il of the British, Anieri
! can, and Japanese navies. The
I United Status agrees to scrap
three, the British five, and the
Japanese, one, ships in this class.
With respect to cruisers, destroy
ers. submarines, and other auxiliary
craft, these same states have
reached limitation agreements

I which, however, accomplish little
j actual redact ion."
lie added that, "the Italians and
! French failed to reach any agree
ment as to limitations upon con-
I struction, but joined the other
: states in a declaration of principles
which purport to accomplish a "hu
i manizat.ion" of submarine warfare.
In view of experience during the
[World War one may question the
j effectiveness of this part of the
| treaty, beyond being, a peacetime
gesture, of international good-inten-
I t ions.
"As a result of tint French and
Italian failure, to join in tint limita
tion agreement, the British have
believed it necessary to protect
their interests by inserting an
1 article permitting the signatory
states to increase proportionately
their naval establishments in the
j opinion of one or more of their re
spective governments such increase
i seems to be warranted by the build
ing program of noil-signatory states
1 —obviously France and Italy. Thus
it is possible for one of tlie latter
! to vitiate much of the substance of |
j the treaty.
"Much can be said for the French j
position. Their belief in the neces-
I sity of positive engagements l'or j
guaranteeing the maintenance of ;
world peace is not an unreasonable j
i attitude, especially in view of
French experience during the past !
i century. Their unwillingness to
1 agree to virtual inferiority, in the I
name of parity, to Italy, is all the i
| most understandable in view of the j
unyielding position of Mussolini's j
government.
"The Italians have neither the
resources nor the credit necessary
to build up a naval force compe*
I tent to challenge the British or
the French in the Mediterranean.
Their African dependencies are
scarcely an economic asset to be
protected at great cost, and their
commerce beyond Gibraltar and
Suez has been, and inevitably will
continue to be, at t lie mercy of j
the greater naval powers in tlie j
event of war. It is not wholly clear |
what the Italian government hopes j
to accomplish by its present naval l
policy."
Mac Donald Praised
Sprout concluded, "On the other j
j hand, the London treaty seems I
1 likely to improve the relations of
the British, American, and Japa- >
nose peoples. Students of public i
j affairs note and appreciate the un- i
tiring energy and good fai.tli which
have characterized the efforts of
Mac Donald, NVakatsuki, and Stim
-1 son; and to these it seems;
only fair to add the name of
Briand, than whom perhaps no >
I greater advocate of world peace i
lives today. Even the partial sue*
| cess of the conference bids fair to
, induce more friendly co-operation
than did the uncompromising fail
ure of the Geneva Conference in I
1!)27, and sjome observers predict !
that the treaty will serve as a dis
tinct. stimulus to the general dis
| armament efforts of the League,;
which have made so little progress
of late.
"Finally, it must be remembered
that, tile treaty is not yet law. liach j
of the signatory states must, ratify
the work of its delegates. As to the
"United States, it. is certainly to be

: states in a declaration of principles
which purport to accomplish a "hu
i manizat.ion" of submarine warfare.
In view of experience during the
[World War one may question the
j effectiveness of this part of the
| treaty, beyond being, a peacetime
gesture, of international good-inten-
I t ions.
"As a result of tint French and
Italian failure, to join in tint limita
tion agreement, the British have
believed it necessary to protect
their interests by inserting an
1 article permitting the signatory
states to increase proportionately
their naval establishments in the
j opinion of one or more of their re
spective governments such increase
i seems to be warranted by the build
ing program of noil-signatory states
1 —obviously France and Italy. Thus
it is possible for one of tlie latter
! to vitiate much of the substance of |
j the treaty.
"Much can be said for the French j
position. Their belief in the neces-
I sity of positive engagements l'or j
guaranteeing the maintenance of ;
world peace is not an unreasonable j
i attitude, especially in view of
French experience during the past !
i century. Their unwillingness to
1 agree to virtual inferiority, in the I
name of parity, to Italy, is all the i
| most understandable in view of the j
unyielding position of Mussolini's j
government.
"The Italians have neither the
resources nor the credit necessary
to build up a naval force compe*
I tent to challenge the British or
the French in the Mediterranean.
Their African dependencies are
scarcely an economic asset to be
protected at great cost, and their
commerce beyond Gibraltar and
Suez has been, and inevitably will
continue to be, at t lie mercy of j
the greater naval powers in tlie j
event of war. It is not wholly clear |
what the Italian government hopes j
to accomplish by its present naval l
policy."
Mac Donald Praised
Sprout concluded, "On the other j
j hand, the London treaty seems I
1 likely to improve the relations of
the British, American, and Japa- >
nose peoples. Students of public i
j affairs note and appreciate the un- i
tiring energy and good fai.tli which
have characterized the efforts of
Mac Donald, NVakatsuki, and Stim
-1 son; and to these it seems;
only fair to add the name of
Briand, than whom perhaps no >
I greater advocate of world peace i
lives today. Even the partial sue*
| cess of the conference bids fair to
, induce more friendly co-operation
than did the uncompromising fail
ure of the Geneva Conference in I
1!)27, and sjome observers predict !
that the treaty will serve as a dis
tinct. stimulus to the general dis
| armament efforts of the League,;
which have made so little progress
of late.
"Finally, it must be remembered
that, tile treaty is not yet law. liach j
of the signatory states must, ratify
the work of its delegates. As to the
"United States, it. is certainly to be
hoped that a minority group of!
Senators will not obstruct this j
achievement of tlie Hoover admin
istration."
