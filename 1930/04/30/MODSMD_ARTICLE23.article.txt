"We must preserve the spirit and
practice of orderly government,"
said Acting President. Robert K.
Swain la.st night at the installation
banquet for the new Women's
Council in the Union. "The whole
structure of student government
will crumble if disorderly methods
which do not come through the
legit iniate organs of student gov
ernment. are used.
"We mustn't let the Honor Code
become a. code of dishonor," con
tinued Dr. Swain, and in touching
the problems which come up be
i fore student groups, he urged pa
tience. "Formidable problems often
arise and settle themselves in two
or three weeks. The students should
listen to all slides of a question in
fairness and think of the interests
of the University as well as their
I own desires."
The work of the past year was
summarized by Benetta Merner, re
tiring president of A.W.S., who
