# WOMEN FAVOR AMENDMENT OF LOCKOUT RULES
## Change Of Attitude Toward Question Is Advocated By Cushing And Alden Many Desire Week Night 11:30 Lockout Instead Of 10:30 'Expediency' 
### 
"Consider Stanford as a com
munity and not a boarding school"
was the pica put before Ihe women
students last night by Maxine
Cashing at the special assembly
after t lie Associated Women Stll
dents' installation banquet. The a.>
serubly was the result of a petition
signed by 50 women students seek
ing to "bring the growing disssati :
faction with the present system of
lockout rules to the attention of
the administration."
A change in the attitude toward
the lockout rules was the keynote
of the message given to the group
of 250 women who gathered in
Room 214. "We must change our
attitude from the conception of the
rules as the champion of morality
to rules of expediency. Dignity,
simplicity, and expediency should
be the criterion for the women's
regulations," said Miss Gushing.
Two-Thirds Favorable
Betty Alden, newly elected presi
dent of A.W.S., declared she be
lieved that two-thirds of the women
students favor revision of the pres
ent rules. Maxine Gushing was of
ficially delegated at the mass meet
ing to present the vote taken on
the four questions to the joint meet
ing of Women's Council and Con
ference which is to be held next
week. Miss Alden will give Un
vote results to Dean Mary Yost this
afternoon. The ballots were not.
counted.
Specifically, as the representa
tive of the group of women who
signed the petition requesting Ihe
assembly, Maxine Gushing de
dared:
1. That since there is avoidance
of present rules, resulting in com
plaints from hostesses concerning
all-night guests, the 1:30 o'clock
week-end lookout, rule should be
changed to 2:30 o'clock.
2. That, in order to provide for
the present lack of any late leaves
during the week, a number of 2:30
o'clock leaves during the week
should he allowed, the. number ami
representation to be decided by
Conference.
3. That there is no reason for an
arbitray 10:30 o'clock week-night
regulation since an 11:30 would be
more expedient.
Possible objections against the
change were outlined and refuted.
The first, that living groups would
have to remain open until 2:.'10
o'clock, causing added expense,
should be no objection since at the
University of Chicago there are no
regulations and an efficient key sys
tem is used. *
If the administration approved
the changes it would be a formal
recognition of the modern social
trend toward liberalism, it was
said. However, the administration
can not stop the social trend and
rules should be made reasonable
enough to be observed, Miss Gusli
ing stated. Comparison with other
colleges is not advisable since some
are more liberal and some more
strict. Utiles should suit the com
munity, it was pointed out.
