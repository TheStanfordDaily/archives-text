# HOPE FROM PRINCETON
## 
### 
I ho West in general and Stanford in particular have been ex
onerated. From suave Princeton's suave and oddly shaped Priiicc-
Umian comes a clarion call of hope to benighted Westerners.
1 he West and Stanford have a right to be elated. To be noticed
(and commended) by I'rinceton —where men wear spats and carry
sticks—can mean but one thing ;it can mean only that advancement
has been made. There's still hope, boys.
Says the Princctonian:
"Easterners all too often conceive of the West as provincial and
perhaps a bit backward. This is unfortunate; it is unjust. Type
four inches high in the Stanford (C'al.) Daily 'Axe Fxtra' goes far
in refuting so unfounded a charge.
"Undoubtedly many universities, if they had a strangle-hold on
the presidency, would be likely to rest a bit on their laurels. Not
so Stanford. It is proverbial that elephants have prodigious memo
ries; Stanford is not to be outdone. 31 years ago the sacred Axe,
symbol of Stanford prowess, was stolen by California; since 1X99
lias Stanford nursed this grudge in vain. i»ut did Stanford quit?
I'crish the thought. <)n the momentous evening of April third,
accounts were squared—a glorious 'twenty-one,' with a plan which
has been four years in preparation, completely baffled the California
guardians of the trophy and whisked it back to a rightly jubilant
Stan ford.
"This event far surpasses the only other comparable historical
occurrence. W hen the Ark of the Covenant was finally restored
after 20 years to the Israelites, they played only a passive role;
Stanford took the initiative. Perhaps the Philistines were less for
midable than the men from the University of California. Perhaps
we have here an example of the power of man through evolution to
rise to even greater heights."
