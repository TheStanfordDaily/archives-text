### 
For more than thirty-six years, the Mayo Brothers, famed Roch
ester curists, have been laying aside one-half of their earnings. To
day a fund of $18,000,000 has accumulated. "Holy money'' the
physicians call it. It will not go to Mayo heirs but will be used for
the perpetuation of the great work in medicine the two brothers
have pursued.
All of this will go to the Mayo Foundation for Medical Edu
cation and Research, connected with the I "niversity of Minnesota.
This was founded in 1915 with a gift of $1,500,000.
Foremost practitioners for decades, the Mayos have skillfully
carved niches of fame for themselves in the field of medicine. They
have Iniilt Rochester into the greatest clinical city in the world.
To it each day come hundreds of sufferers.
In returning their accumulated wealth to the field from which
they gained it.the Mayo brothers are doing a valued work in t,he
advancement of healing. (ireat is the debt the world owes the
Mayos for their work of charity, of healing, but not content are
these brothers. Their great work will go on years after their names
are onlv memories.
