# THESE SMOKING CO-EDS
## 
### 
The good old days of the past when women were supposed to
avert their eyes upon seeing an exposed bicep are recalled with the
news that 44 of the 400 women at Bucknell I niversity have been
placed on social probation for six months because they admitted
to smoking in their rooms.
These up-start Western universities arc crude. Yes, ma'am,
they are down-right crude. The co-eds ride broncos without side
saddles, and smoke just like anything. They're not so refined as
those of I'ucknell where "darn" darn near merits a girl's expulsion
from school.
"Young woman, go West," shall be the inspiration of the femi
nine Horace (irecleys. If a girl can't truthfully sign a pledge
promising not to smoke in her living quarters, she had better come
West.
Bucknell authorities probably took a great deal for granted in
denying smoking co-eds the right to walk with men on the campus
or to make dates for the next six months. However, what can be
expected from a university where the women don't ride bucking
horses or smoke?
