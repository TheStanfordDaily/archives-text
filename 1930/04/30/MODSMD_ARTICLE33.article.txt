ARMS AND THE MAN—At Erlart
ger's Columbia Theatre, San
Francisco.
"Arms and the Man" 1s a play
j that furnisher one wilh it surprise
— and quite a pleasant one. It is a
'beautiful proof that Bernard Shaw
| doesn't, have to he saved for middle
' age, hut has something to offer
evHti for thrill-loving, suspense
craving collegfe students.
It was almost a shock to find,
! oneself hanging on every linn of
this play. The famous Shaw humor
has not been overrated, judging l>y
(lie fun and wit which lie in "Arms
land the Man." The lines and situa
tions are full of humor that, is live
-1 ly, human, and exciting. The Shaw
i irony is another pleasant surprise,
ilt is unmistakably there a gener
i oils coating applied to ideals of
war, romance, chivalry, and honor:
ideals exploited a dextrous,
quaint comiealness which makes
this irony easy to take without dim
ming its strength. There is ex
hilarating quality infused into the
lines that grows upon the spectator
| until the play seems to rush by,
coming far too quickly to the final
curtain.
| "Arms and the Man" is admir
able entertainment just from the
(dramatic point of view—wit»h its
many amusing, tangled situations,
quick action, and a tingling "some
thing-is-going-tn-happen" ;t tmo s -
! phere which never lags.

I But the real excellence is to be
[found in the acting. Each of the
! characters has extracted every pos
sibility of interest and humor which
! bis role allows—and then has dou-
I bled this sum through the appeal
j of bis own personality. These Eng
j lisli actor's have a technique and a
diction all their own, and there is
! nothing comparable to it. Barry
I Jones, in the leading role, gives
such an utterly engaging perform
-1 ance that one's appreciation of it
: is a lit11(» distracted hy thoughts of
how charming he must be in real
! life. Hilda Case, the heroine, suc
i coeds in creating a wonderful first
j impression by her initial appear-
J ance in a stiffly demure 18th cen
tury nightdress, a billowing white
I affair, which left only her bead and
hands visible. In the next act she
! turns out to be an exceptionally
, pretty and winning girl. She saves
soldiers' lives and llirts with suit
! ors with equal adeptness.
Bill we do not want to be mis
; understood. "Arms and the Man"
|is typically Bernard Sliaw —and
| this inevitably means a certain
j amount of moralizing, although in
I this ease the dose is fairly light.
■Yet if it is only the formidable
aroma of "highbrowishness" which
i is attached to Shaw's name itself
thai will defer you from seeing this
play -you are making a mistake.
You will relish ii without even
realizing that il IS highbrow.

ARMS AND THE MAN—At Erlart

"Arms and the Man" 1s a play
j that furnisher one wilh it surprise
— and quite a pleasant one. It is a
'beautiful proof that Bernard Shaw

' age, hut has something to offer
evHti for thrill-loving, suspense
craving collegfe students.
It was almost a shock to find,
! oneself hanging on every linn of
this play. The famous Shaw humor
has not been overrated, judging l>y
(lie fun and wit which lie in "Arms
land the Man." The lines and situa
tions are full of humor that, is live
-1 ly, human, and exciting. The Shaw
i irony is another pleasant surprise,
ilt is unmistakably there a gener
i oils coating applied to ideals of
war, romance, chivalry, and honor:
ideals exploited a dextrous,
quaint comiealness which makes
