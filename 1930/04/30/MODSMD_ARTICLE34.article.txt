i Will someone please explain why
. the driveway in front of Branner
Hall is no longer to be used for
parking?
A recent article in the Daily
i quotes Roy H. Button, 5.8., (Super
intendent of Buildings) as having
said that the new parking restric
tion has for its purpose the pro
tection of the graveled walks lead
-1 ing to the halls. Well enough, I
isay; protect, the walks and the
} gravel by all means! But the drive
! way in front of Branner could
I hardly he called a graveled walk,
i In fact, it is no sueli thing. It. is
i very obviously a driveway intended
! for automobiles, and as such is a

(natural and convenient parking;
: place for cars of Branner residents
i and for commercial vehicles mak
! ing deliveries.
| So why close it to parking? Such
i a restriction seems very useless
'and removes what lias been a great
| convenience to the residents of
i Branner. Of course, it lias enabled
Mr. Button to add three shiny new
I signs to our ever-growing assort
fmcni. And that's nice. "Scenic or j
isign-ic?" Mr. Button was asked, j
"There's always room for more," j
sent hack Button as he placed a !
j"KERP OUT" sign over the Hoover i
home chimney. "Just getting ready [
for Xnias, you know," lie smiled
up at, us warmly as he fell down I
I the chimney. -'JWi.
