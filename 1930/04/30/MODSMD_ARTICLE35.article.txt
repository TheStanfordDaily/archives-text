# APPRECIATION OF SERVICE

### 
The Editor, Sir: j
i In the midst of a quarter during i
which most, of us are afflicted with j
an excessive amount of vitality and !
good spirits, 1 do not wish to ap- |
pear hypochondriacal, but it does '
seem that the time is ripe for a
more general recognition among
I students of the campus facilities!
that are available for health pro
jection. In this connection 1 wish
I to call attention to the Stanford
(Men's Rest Home, and to the kind
| officos of its director, Mrs. Mor-
I rison.
Most of us know from personal 1
! experience (lie difficulty and dis
tress which accompanies the effort
i to take proper care of minor indis
positions and cumulative fatigue in
I either dormitory or fraternity j
I house. We also know the serious j

results Dial ;illpikl ji hitherto al
most necessary neglect.. Of course,
cases of an obviously serious na
ture are usually referred to the
hospital without delay, but there
are many minor disabilities which
are neglected. It is these that the
Rest Home is especially fitted to
serve. It would be an excellent pro
vision if every living group had an
individual or a committee respons
ible for the prompt report, of such
cases, or at least for encouraging
the public recognition of the pro
visions that have been made for
health protection.
This letter has been written in
an attempt to express my apprecia
tion of the service the Rest Home
has done for me, and in the belief
that a wider recognition of its pur
pose and facilities will be beneficial
to all. 1,. P. Ilerrington.
