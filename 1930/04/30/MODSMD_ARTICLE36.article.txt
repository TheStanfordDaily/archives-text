# CONSIDERS IT UNJUST

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Judging by your editorial of the
28th inst. on "Bigotry and Jingo
ism" you. advocate liberality, so I
trust, you will consider and publish
remarks differing with yours -or
write another.
1 never joined the K.K.K. nor the
A.P.A. (American Protective Asso
ciation) but I consider it unjust
i to connect K.K.K. with the D.A.K.
and religious bigotry in this case
nn<l undoubtedly its membership is
in harmony and sympathy with
) Mrs. Morris and her stand for
i world peace and law enforcement,
and would not oppose her on ac
count of her religion. | happen to
i he a Methodist, in touch with the
people and leaders, and I have
heard any but the most kindly ex
pressions of appreciation and ad
miration.
You close your editorial Willi the
i statement that writers are sup
! posed to be "markedly liberal"
j some are remarkably liberal like

itlu» Russian Communists and iltose
wliri join the Hearst. Publication,
j combination and the wet associa
tion of ant is in the rebellion
! against the t'.S. Constitution and!
incidentally to counteract the ef
fect of every laudable effort of
j President Hoover and thus mini-i
j mi/.e his popularity in furtherance
i of their plan to run and elect. their
Uvet combination candidate.
There is a pleasing sensible tone j
lo the preceding editorial and com
ment about the drinking student
| reflecting their home environment.
As there are more than ten times
! more in college now than before
| prohibition prevailed, probably the
drinkers referred to would not have 1
! been here if the "good old days" j
■ had continued.
Please reconsider your remarks
about "righteous critics" —it is anti
prohi propaganda reiterated to (lis- ,
' credit prohibition and justify their
"Whisky Rebellion." Prohibitionists
j resent their slurs against the mod
-1 ern young people.
