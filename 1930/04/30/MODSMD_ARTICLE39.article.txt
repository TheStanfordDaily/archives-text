TROY AGAIN?
The thirst for revenge on the
men of Troy which the Stan
ford track team is hoping to
quench at the California Inter
collegiate Meet here on May 16
and 17 is apt to go unslaked
until the IC4A meet for the j
simple reason that several ath
letes from the University of
California and UCLA will also
be entered in the State ruckus.
This may not look so simple on
paper, but a perusal of the
times and distances hung up
by the Bears and Bruins re
veals the not so cheerful in
formation that they are likely
to cut out more potential Stan
ford point-winners than Tro
jans.
Of course, several events, among (
them I In- shot, discus, quai ler-mile,
and broad jump, will be fought out j
solely by Curds and CSC men. Dean
Cromwell's men will probably gel I
f.'iil out of points in the javelin by i
Curtice and Churchill of ('alitor-j
uia, uml u I'c wmore in lite «lis- ,
tanees by Mossinun and Zellman
of the Hears, but otherwise it will
be up to Stanford to stop the Card
inal and Cold standard-bearers.
Take the sprints for example. ■
I'CLA will enter si trio of runners ;
in Hill, Smith, and Locked who do
not. figure to beat either Dyer or;
WykolT, but might conceivably out- |
step Ciberson, llowell, Maurer, and
Cuyer for the other places. Locked,
in particular, has a murk of 21.5 to ;
bis credit in the li'JO, which is fancy
stepping, calculated to press the
Curd flyer and the Clendale express [
to the limit.
The hurdles should be classic
affairs, with Pogolotti of Cal,
Smith of Stanford, and Welsh,
Payne, Stokes, and Powers of j
USC topping the barriers. Oh
yes—and a fellow named
Knight from UCLA who has
done 24.2 in the low sticks,
which might mess up the dope
materially.
UCLA has one other entrant
whose past performances entitle '
him to consideration —Malhaupt,
good for six feet one inch in the
high jump. He and Rice of Cali
fornia don't, figure to bother Van
Osdel and Stewart of Southern
California, but, they will prove an
awful nuisance to Madison and
Allan of Stanford. The same thing
goes for I'ool of California in the
pole vault, who is likely to cut in
behind the Trojan vaulters ahead
of Berry of Stanford.
All of which means that sev
eral decisions rendered in the
Stanford-USC meet will have to
be reversed in favor of Temple
ton's men, or the Trojans will
hang another victory on their
belt, already heavy with too
darn many pelts.

simple reason that several ath
letes from the University of
California and UCLA will also
be entered in the State ruckus.
This may not look so simple on
paper, but a perusal of the
times and distances hung up
by the Bears and Bruins re
veals the not so cheerful in
formation that they are likely
to cut out more potential Stan
ford point-winners than Tro
jans.
Of course, several events, among (
them I In- shot, discus, quai ler-mile,
and broad jump, will be fought out j
solely by Curds and CSC men. Dean
Cromwell's men will probably gel I
f.'iil out of points in the javelin by i
Curtice and Churchill of ('alitor-j
uia, uml u I'c wmore in lite «lis- ,
tanees by Mossinun and Zellman
of the Hears, but otherwise it will
be up to Stanford to stop the Card
inal and Cold standard-bearers.
Take the sprints for example. ■
I'CLA will enter si trio of runners ;
in Hill, Smith, and Locked who do
not. figure to beat either Dyer or;
WykolT, but might conceivably out- |
step Ciberson, llowell, Maurer, and
Cuyer for the other places. Locked,
in particular, has a murk of 21.5 to ;
bis credit in the li'JO, which is fancy
stepping, calculated to press the
Curd flyer and the Clendale express [
to the limit.
The hurdles should be classic
affairs, with Pogolotti of Cal,
Smith of Stanford, and Welsh,
Payne, Stokes, and Powers of j
USC topping the barriers. Oh
yes—and a fellow named
Knight from UCLA who has
done 24.2 in the low sticks,
which might mess up the dope
materially.
UCLA has one other entrant
whose past performances entitle '
him to consideration —Malhaupt,
good for six feet one inch in the
high jump. He and Rice of Cali
fornia don't, figure to bother Van
Osdel and Stewart of Southern
California, but, they will prove an
awful nuisance to Madison and
Allan of Stanford. The same thing
goes for I'ool of California in the
pole vault, who is likely to cut in
behind the Trojan vaulters ahead
of Berry of Stanford.
All of which means that sev
eral decisions rendered in the
Stanford-USC meet will have to
be reversed in favor of Temple
ton's men, or the Trojans will
hang another victory on their
belt, already heavy with too
darn many pelts.

TROY AGAIN?
The thirst for revenge on the
men of Troy which the Stan
ford track team is hoping to
quench at the California Inter
collegiate Meet here on May 16
and 17 is apt to go unslaked
until the IC4A meet for the j
simple reason that several ath
letes from the University of
California and UCLA will also
be entered in the State ruckus.
