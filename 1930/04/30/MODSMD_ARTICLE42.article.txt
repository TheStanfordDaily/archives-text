# Many Stanford Ineligibles Enter P.A.A. Meet
## FARM GRIDSTERS ENTERED IN 440 RELAY SATURDAY Hables, Storms, Kazanjian, Patton, And Four Frosh To Participate 
### Bob Van Etten 
Four men who once packed the |
pigskin for "fop" Warner's Card- |
inal varsities will enter the special |
football 440-yard relay race, ex-|
pected to be one of the major at j
tractions of the I'.A.A. meet to be ;
held in Kezar Stadium, San I'Yan- ;
cisco, at 2 o'clock Saturday alter-
I noon. To uphold the Stanford stand- |
1 anl, Coach "Dink" Templeton has j
selected Fleishhacker, Rothert, i
Frentrup, and Moffatt. Should these I
men show the same ability in pass- j
ing t.he baton as in handing the
football around, a Cardinal victory i
is to be expected, although if St. j
Ignatius enters their quartet of l
men, all said to be capable of 10 ,
' fiat in the hundred, that will be an j
equine of a different light wave- j
length.
Many Ineligibles
Accompanying the full strength j
of the varsity track and field squad, j
Stanford's more prominent ineligi- ]
bles will be seen in action Saturday J
a ft ernoon.
Hables, who al the Fresno j
Relays beat, out Russell Sweet, !
| Olympic Club ace, for second place !
behind the flying heels fo Frank!
WykolT, will again compete in the ;
century, and may enter the 440 in j
addition if lie feels strong enough j
after the exertion of running the j
numerous heats of the short race, j
Allan Storms, whose eligibility i
> would have garnered many a point
for the Cardinals in the distance j
'events, expects to enter the 880, j
; and may attempt an "iron man" |
I stunt to include the mile in his I
I afternoon's program.
Kazanjian Enters
"Casey" Kazanjian, perhaps i
I Stanford's oldest athletically ac- j
I
tive alumnus, will be on hand to
i take part in the ceremony of giving '
the 56-pound weight a ride. In this j
event Kazanjian may enjoy the j
j company of Rothert, Krenz, and j
1 Fleishhacker, all of whom possess .
at least y slight desire to find out !
officially just how far they can toss j
the mammoth Iron ball.
Rob Patton, former L.A.A.C. !
1 representative and a transfer from j
California, is entered in his pet i
| event, the hop-step-and-jump. Last j
| year Patton placed second to Kelly, j
I Olympic Club hop-stepper who won
t this event in Hie National A.A.TT. j
' meet.
Four members of the freshman j
squad, Ben Eastman, Here La-
Borde, Nelson Gray, and Lloyd Aus-1
tin will also compete unattached, i
With Morrison still favoring his in- '
jured muscle and nof expecting to !
run Saturday, Eastman should bo j
a favorite to cop the one-lap event, ;
although lie will meet plenty of :
, competition from the Stanford var- j
sity quarter-milers, Maynor Shove
and Ike Hables. Gray and Laßorde !
| will enter the shot and discus, j
| while Austin, who has recently,
j been clearing 12 feet, will compete
! in the pole vault.
"Freak" Events
As is customary in A.A.U. meets, i
which are designed to uncover
Olympic Games material, a number |
of "freak" events—freak in the I
sense that, they are not on the pro- j
! gram of dual intercollegiate meets'
—will be included. In addition to
the 56-pound weight throw and the j
j hop-step-and-jump, the six-mile run, j
j hammer throw, and 440-yard low !
hurdles will be run off during the j
: afternoon. Nunes is the only Card- j
j inal entered in the six-mile event, ;
while the hammer throw and 440- j
j yard hurdles race are devoid of i
i Cardinal entrants.
Rothert and Krenz, who are con-1
sidering a trip south to compete in ;
I the Southern Division of the A.A.U. |
meet on May 10, will in all proba- j
bility enter only one of the weight 1
I events each, Rothert, tossing the
shot, and Krenz throwing the (lis
ins. Krenz, who has been "hot"
j since his famous duel with Paul
Jessup, has designs on his own
I world's record, and may get, the
platter off for a new mark in the
P.A.A. meet.
