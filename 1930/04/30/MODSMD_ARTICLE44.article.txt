# RUTH THROUGHOUT THE AGES
## Ever Since Pharaoh's Daughter Found The Babe In The Bullrushes He Has Been a Topnotcher 
### Feg Murray, '16 
| Once upon a time, about 4,000 j
| years ago, I'luiraoh's daughter
j found the Babe in Ihe bullrushes in
j Egypt and took him to the King's
• court, where he grew up to be aj
i left-handed pitcher. "Can't some
| thing be done about this?" asked i
I Pharaoh. "Tut, Tut," replied his
j daughter, "give the kid time. He
I takes a nice cut at the ball and Ii
I shouldn't be surprised if we could
use him in the outfield some day.
I Maybe in the series between the
I Isis Cream-cones and the ITottot
I I Joggis. Eh, Pop?"
j So little Ruth-ank-amen became
j known as the Colossus of Clout,
] and the Ancient Egyptians came
| from as far away as Alexandria
I (which was in the National
I League), on loot, on camels, in
:"their chariots (15c first mile, fie
| for each additional quarter-mile),
j and even by the subway, to fcee the
| noble Babe slam the sacred onion.
; Now it came to pass that one
j Kneehigh, the Flea-bite, bearing
| envy in his heart against the great
| Colossus, did hatch an evil plot to
■ belittle him in the eyes of the

• Egyptians and especially to lnimili- !
ate him before the Pharaoh and his ;
daughter. Now it so happened that ;
, two African princes, named Amos j
'n' Andy, were wont to play a game >
wherein they did roll two small
cubes upon the floor, snapping their ;
: fingers meanwhile and saying, '
"Come seben," "Little Joe," and \
the like. So Kneehigh, the Fleabite, 1
I did bribe Amos 'n' Andy to instruct i
the Battering Rameses in the art j
of playing this game called African ;
Golf. The Babe liked the game full
well and sat up all the night before :
the crucial series playing it.
And it came to pass that when j
Ruth-ank-amen did come to bat
; with a man on third and one run
needed to win the game, all he
'could see were black spots before
his eyes, and 10, the pitcher beaned j
him with a fast, ball. But it so hap
pened that there was a fly at that ,
moment besting on the Babe's
forehead, and the insect, a sacred
one in Egypt at the time, was killed
by the ball. "A sacrifice fly!" cried
out the umpire. "See, it was on his
j Temple!"
j Then he ran home to his mummy.
