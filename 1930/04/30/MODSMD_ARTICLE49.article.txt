## Thompson Trails Stevenson 4 Down In Other Golf Semi-Final Match 
### 
Hampered by a heavy wind, and 1
slightly conscious of the gallery, |
Warner Edmonds and Malcolm Me- ,
Naußhlon failed to play up to their I
usual standard in the first IS holes j
of their scheduled Hli hole semi-j
finals match of the Stanford open
played yesterday. Edmonds finally I
finished 2 up on his opponent, after j
a iiip-aiKl-tuck ba-tti<* all tiie way I
around. At the same time Richie |
Stevenson came'out \ up on Bill 1
Thompson in the first half of the |
other semi-final contest.
Edmonds and McNaughtoni played |
around in estimated scores of S2 j
and .S"», respectively, accurate j
scores being impossible to compute j
due to the numerous conceded 1
putts and unfinished holes. This is j
tar below the 7. r > or .7♦» that the two
usually make. McNaughton far out- j
drove his opponent, getting off sev
eral drives of between and MOO
yards', but his opponent had much !
the better of him in approaches and
put ts.
Edmonds Makes. Drive
McNaughton took the. lead on the
second hole when Kdmonds topped
his second shot into a tree. The
count was evened on the third, Mc-
Naughton three-putting for one
over par. The next two were halved
in fives, and McNaughton regained
a one-hole advantage on the sixth
making a beautiful brassie shot to
get on the green in two. Again the
score tied up on the seventh, when ,
McNaughton drove under a tree
and couldn't get a full swing at the
ball. The lanky Card captain got
into a lot of trouble on the eighth
and conceded it alter faking five
shots oil a par three hole.
He came right back to knot
things again on the ninth, Mc- i
Naughton shooting short on Ihe ap- ;
proach. Edmonds took the lead for [
the first time on the eleventh, his
opponent taking three putts. The
tally squared up very promptly on
the next hole when Edmonds had
a little engagement with a trap. !
Driving into a regular gale on the
twelfth, McNaughton got, into the ;
rough and a trap in succession and
his opponent grabbed the lead
again.
Edmonds increased it to two up
on the thirteenth in spite of a long
drive by McNaughton, when Ed- 1
monds laid his second shot IS
inches from the cup for a birdie.
McNaughton cut the had to all
even winning the next hole, halving
the fifteenth, and getting a par on |
the sixteenth. Edmonds took a one- j
up lead on the short seventeenth,
when McNaughton topped his ap
proach, and finished out two up. j

making a beautiful brassie shot to
get on the green in two. Again the
score tied up on the seventh, when ,
McNaughton drove under a tree
and couldn't get a full swing at the
ball. The lanky Card captain got
into a lot of trouble on the eighth
and conceded it alter faking five
shots oil a par three hole.
He came right back to knot
things again on the ninth, Mc- i
Naughton shooting short on Ihe ap- ;
proach. Edmonds took the lead for [
the first time on the eleventh, his
opponent taking three putts. The
tally squared up very promptly on
the next hole when Edmonds had
a little engagement with a trap. !
Driving into a regular gale on the
twelfth, McNaughton got, into the ;
rough and a trap in succession and
his opponent grabbed the lead
again.
Edmonds increased it to two up
on the thirteenth in spite of a long
drive by McNaughton, when Ed- 1
monds laid his second shot IS
inches from the cup for a birdie.
McNaughton cut the had to all
even winning the next hole, halving
the fifteenth, and getting a par on |
the sixteenth. Edmonds took a one- j
up lead on the short seventeenth,
when McNaughton topped his ap
proach, and finished out two up. j

scores being impossible to compute j
due to the numerous conceded 1

McNaughton took the. lead on the
