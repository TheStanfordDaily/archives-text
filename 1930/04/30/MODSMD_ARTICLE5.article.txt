# WHAT A GAME! SIGMA KAPPA VS. BREAKERS TODAY
## 
### 
The Daily's hot yarn today on
intramural bascbalj panics bears
the staggering announcement that
Sigma Kappa is to clash with the
Breakers on diamond 2. At first
the hard-boiled gang on the Daily
copy desk thought it was a mis
take, but the Kappa Sigs are also
entered, so the story is appearing
in the original—per "Tex" Cran
dall, intramural manager.
Jt seems that someone signed
up Sigma Kappa on the mural
list in the Kucina Ciym and the
sisters were duly entered to play
on league 3 — along with the
D.U.'s, Breakers, Betas, Sigma
Nus, and the A.K.k.'s. So far
they've defaulted all their games.
At any rate it's a good thing if
they don't meet the Breakers.
