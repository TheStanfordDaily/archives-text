Royal Coachmans and Cray Hack-j
les out of the moth balls and to i
limber up your favorite rod. If is
the initial day of trout season in
California.
According to the reports from!
the Fish and (lame authorities all â– 
streams in the vicinity will be open i
with the exception of Pescadero I
and Butano creeks. Fishing in the i
Sierra streams is still pretty much j
of a gamble due to high water, the i
reports indicate. "Buy your li- I
cense," is the advice offered by the j
authorities as wardens will be j
patroling the coast streams finite j
carefully.
