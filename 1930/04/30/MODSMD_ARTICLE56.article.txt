# HOUSES ON CAMPUS WILL BE EQUIPPED WITH FIRE ESCAPES
## 
### 
Nineteen fraternity and sorority
houses on the campus are being
equipped with metal lire escapes
this week by a contract awarded
through the Corporation Yard to
the Michel and Pfeffer Iron Works.
Those houses owned by Stanford
will be equipped by the University,
installations on organization-owned
to be financed independ
ently.
According to Fire Chief R. E.
Dugan, a year ago letters were sent
asking the societies' co-operation.
Replies received from a majority
were in l'avor of the project and
it was decided to make the installa
tions mandatory. "This is because
the houses are constantly being
converted into three-story buildings
by using the attics," explained
Dugan. "State law provides that all
non-private residences of three
story height must be equipped with
outside metal escapes."
The new equipment will be of
two kinds, a ladder type for the
fraternities, and with the exception
of one house, a stair-and-ladder
type for the women. Manzanita
Hall, although not now being used
for living quarters, is also to be
outfitted.
