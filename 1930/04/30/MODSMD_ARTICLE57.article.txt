## 
### 
First doubles honors in the jun
ior-freshman interclass tennis
matches which are being played
this week went to the upperclass
men yesterday afternoon when Wil
bur Cox and Phillip Niederauer of
the juniors defeated Jack Pike and
Robert Moore, yearling netmen,
G-0, 0-2.
The veteran '31 combination had
too much experience for the frosh
players, who made the contest
somewhat closer than the score in
dicates, however. Cox and Nieder
auer have been playing together
for years and are slated to play
first, doubles for the varsity next
year.
Probably because of the high
wind which made playing difficult,
no other matches were run off yes
terday. Three tilts are still to be
played in the junior-frosh meet,
while sophomores and seniors are
scheduled to clash this week. All
matches in these two class contests
must be finished by next Friday,
according to Coach Elwyn Bugge.
