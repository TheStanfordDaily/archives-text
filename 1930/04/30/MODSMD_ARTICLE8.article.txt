# TRADITIONS TO BE FOLLOWED IN GRADUATION
## Limited Seating Capacity Of Church Makes New Site Desirable Alternative Suggestions For Exercises Vetoed 
### 
Acting as the'official representa
tive of the Administration, the Com
mittee on Public Exercises has op
posed all suggestions for a change
in the location of Commencement
exercises, if was declared yester
day.
Professor Edgar E. Robinson,
Chairman of the Committee, in a
message presented yesterday after
noon before the Senior Week Com
mittee, brought forth the reasons
for the Administration's stand on
Commencement. These reasons
were based on two main premisesâ€”
expense and tradition.
Substitutes Urged
At a meeting of the Senior Class
held last, month, ytrenuous objec
tions were made to the limited seat
ing capacity of the Church, which
under ordinary graduation condi
tions will allow only two additional
seats to each candidate for a de
gree. Members of the class sug
gested at that time that, the Pavil
ion, the Stadium, and the Inner
Quad be considered as substitutes.
According to Professor Robin
son, careful examination Avas made
of these sites. Each would offer
seating facilities for a greater num
ber than can be accommodated in
the Church. But, he claimed, the
cost of providing Commencement
in these places would range from
$600 to $1900 in addition to the
usual graduation expense.
Although it. was pointed out that
the Senior Class would be willing
to consider payment of these addi
tional costs out of its own funds,
Professor Robinson stated that
Commencement, together with the
Baccalaureate Service, is strictly
an official act of the University
authorities. These two exercises
are unlike the other affairs of Sen
ior Week which are quite properly
the work of the class. Believing
that Commencement is of greatest
interest to those actually taking
degrees, and to their families, he
continued, the Committee has more
and more each year tended to con
line attendance to those persons
and their families.
Since this year only graduates
and members of their families will
be provided admission, the Com
mittee believes that each student
who is actually present at Com
mencement this year will have for
his or her use two and possibly
three tickets.
"The Stanford Commencement in
the Memorial Church (not in the
Union Court or the Inner Court or
the Assembly Hall, as the present
generation may not remember) is
a memory cherished by many Stan
ford graduates who have partici
pated," said Professor Robinson.
"Unlike other universities, we have
this beautiful center for our com
munity life. Once a year it becomes
the particular point, of interest to
those graduates who remain to re
ceive their diplomas from the hand
of the President of the University.
On such a day, when the final bene
diction of the University is given,
the ceremony is for the participant
and not for the general public."
