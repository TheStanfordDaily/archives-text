# STANFORD SORORITIES SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, BELIEVES DR. MOSHER
## 
### 
"The sorority should no longer ex
ist at Stanford." This is the sugges
tion of Dr. ( lelia I). Mosher, Pro
fessor Kuieritus of Personal Hygiene,
and former Medical Adviser of Woin
i('ii, in the annual report of the Depart
nient of Physical Kducatiou for
| Women, published last week.
"Although suggesting this drastic
'change," said Dr. Mosher, "I wish to
pay tribute to the delightful friend
! ships and the important part played by
j the sororities in the early days of the
University. Bnt conditions have
ichanged. At Stanford today, with the
j high degree of selection, practically
I all the women are sorority material.
J Therefore, the arbitrary taking of
some and rejection of others by the
sorority group represents an artificial
selection.
"The sororities have grown until
their members outnumber those not
chosen. The women not selected often
! develop mental conditions which are
|*lilhcult to correct. Socially, ibis art
ificial distinction not only influences
the life here at Stanford, but some
-1 times follows the woman socially and
| psychologically after she leaves the
I niver.sity.
1 "The increasing demands of the ccn-

Itral organizations on the local chap
ters, while well inlentiotied, make
' undue inroads on the already overfull
lives of the sorority women, to the
consequent detriment of their health.
" The evils of the rushing season -
over excitement, loss of sleep, over
eating, and its interference with aca
demic work bring their large <|Uota
of victims to the Medical Adviser's
â–  oflice for help, brcnuentlj the chap
ters push their members into too many
i outside activities, which may be for
the glory of the organization, but im
pair health and academic work.
"Although active members of .the
sororities often recognize many of
these undesirable conditions, they do
not remedy the situation, because of
j the overwhelming pressure of their
well-organized alumnae, who from a
i distance fail to realize our changed
. conditions.
"We who are here in close contact
with the everyday life in the Univer
sity, although just as loyal as ever,
recognize, that the sorority should no
longer exist at Stanford."
Dr. Mosher, a member of Kappa
Alpha Thcta, was graduated from
Stanford in 18W. She received her
M l), degree from Johns Hopkins Uni
versity in 1900.
