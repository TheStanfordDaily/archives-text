### 
CJTANKOKI) women as represented at,the A.W.S. meeting Tuesday
|Â° night are unanimously in favor of some change n the present lock
out system, according to ballot results compiled yesterday. Ninety
| per cent of those who admitted avoiding the 1:30 lockout by staying
! overnight, off the campus would have returned if there had been a 2:30
o'clock regulation. Sixty per cent of the 81 who voted had avoided the
rule. Only three women did not favor the 2:110 o'clock week-end pro
j posal. Oikc of the three suggested a 2 o'clock leave and two favored

>1:30 o'clock without qualifying
their stand. Sixty-three per cent fa
vored a straight 2:HO o'clock and
others were for some regulations
between classes.
The midweek proposal of 11:30
o'clock instead of the present 10:30
o'clock was approved by all but
eleven. Seven of these wanted
10:U0 o'clock giving health as the
reason, and others wanted some
i regulation of underclassmen or
j freshmen and a 10:30 leave with
;a 12 o'clock ratio was suggested.
Midweek late leaves of some
kind were unauimously favored al
-1 though the variety of opinions on
i this subject was great. Most of the
I voters wanted a ratio for 2:30
leaves to be determined by Con
i t'erence.
Suggestions regarding lockout
j administration favored very em
| pliatically a 30-minute leeway
which would cover the whole quar
] ter and therefore put the lockout
system on a basis of a total minute
tardiness during the quarter in
stead of the number of lockouts.
Along with this a desire for less
red tape in the system was ex
pressed.
I That lockouts should be handled
by living groups working under a
central A.W.S. committee ot' lock
| out chairmen, was approved to take
the place of the present system of
Council supervision.
A report of the ballot was given
to Dean Mary Yost yesterday and
Conference will take action upon
(lie matter at the meeting next
Wednesday. It is expected that liv
ing groups will hold discussions of
the question during Monday house
meetings in order that their Con
ference members will be able to
Kive a representative opinion. All
action taken by Conference must
be approved by the administration
in older to become effective.
