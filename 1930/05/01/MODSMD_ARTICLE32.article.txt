Something new and different in popular government was Iried
I uesday evening at the special women's assembly—something of
which Jefferson and I'ryce never heard.
\ poll was taken. A very good poll. F.vervone voted. The bal
lots were properly marked and cast.
I hen the ballots were not counted.
To hold an election and not count the ballots is surely a depar
ture from the orthodox in the theory of democracy.
I 'ut its good practice. It would be good practice, too, for
novelists to write 90,000-word volumes and cast them into the fire
before anyone read them. And'scientists could laboriously conduct
experiments and chuck the steaming test tubes out of the window.
( )h. well, such is life—and femininitv.

Anyhow, there was a vote taken. \nd it was in order. That
was something.
Tuesday night at the installation of the new A.W.S. officers, 1
Dr. Swain said this: "We must preserve the spirit and practice of
orderly government in student affairs. What I refer to especially
is a certain petition, of no authorized leadership and promiscuous
signing, which was circulated over the campus recenllv and given
widespread publicity over the country."
In such a statement Dr. Swain's attitude is understandable, and
thoroughly justified. Ile has made it clear that lie. was not referring
to the recent women's petition asking for an airing of the lockout
situation.
I lie women s petition was a model of regularity and orthodoxy.
It serves as an opportunity to learn whether or not student govern
ment means anything.
The present agitation for revision of Stanford's lockout rules
i entirely within the confines of student control, theoretically
-peaking at least. It remains to he seen just how successfully the
women will be able to exercise this theoretical control.
I he three proposals offer a tangible plan for agreement audi
difference; and if the living groups, through their Conference rep
resentatives, could indicate their stand on these three changes, the
whole opinion of the women could be much more adequately ex !
pressed when .Miss Yost meets with Women's Conference to con
sider the question next week.
\ reasonable outlook on the matter, taking into consideration
the I niversity's interests, the traditions concerning the established
hours, the parents' objections, the health and morality alleged to be I
regulated bv lockouts, and the reasonable grounds on which modi
fication can be asked, is highly desired.
The groups responsible for any changes that may be made will
not be liable to jump to any conclusions. It will he a seasoned rea- '
onablc judgment which will be the ultimate answer to the present
feeling for revision which the Daily believes is widespread among'
the Five Hundred.

Dr. Swain said this: "We must preserve the spirit and practice of
orderly government in student affairs. What I refer to especially
is a certain petition, of no authorized leadership and promiscuous
signing, which was circulated over the campus recenllv and given
widespread publicity over the country."
In such a statement Dr. Swain's attitude is understandable, and

I uesday evening at the special women's assembly—something of
which Jefferson and I'ryce never heard.
\ poll was taken. A very good poll. F.vervone voted. The bal
lots were properly marked and cast.
I hen the ballots were not counted.
To hold an election and not count the ballots is surely a depar
