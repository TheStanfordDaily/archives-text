# THE 						BABY'S GROWING
## 
### 
With the development of the Daily into a standard-sized news
paper furnishing an increased coverage of local events and of for
eign news through the medium of the Associated Press, there has
come, as in any other expanding body, the ever-present pangs of
painful growth. As the Daily grew, its revenue from circulation
• lid not increase. Student subscribers were receiving far more value
than student-body fees to this publication warranted.
Tuesday night the F.x ( ommittee recognized the augmentation
of the Daily and took steps to remedy the situation by granting an
additional ten cents from each student fee. The present inadequate
50-cent contribution was raised to 60 cents by the committee to care
for the Daily's expansion.
To provide for future development of the paper, the committee
went on record to have a fee of 75 cents taken from the student's
quarterly student-body contribution when the entire student fee
system is reapportioned.
Although the Daily may not sliow an immediate improvement
as soon as the increase in funds is received, the improvement in
the newspaper will be sure in its climb to a new high peak among
the leading college dailies of the country.
The I'.x Committee is to be commended in its foresight in aid
ing to improve the Daily, for the present and for the future.
The election of a king for the Masque Ball is something of a
campus joke—but it is a joke which should not be taken too much
as one. The election is more than a mere popularity contest. It has
a serious purpose behind it—the contribution to the Convalescent
Home fund. There are three entrants —good men and true —still
in the contest. Vote for one of them tomorrow. Each vote helps
the candidate, but it helps, also, a cause that is Stanford's own.
