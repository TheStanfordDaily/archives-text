SHIRT-TAIL AMD PIGTAIL, Non
chalant Adventures in Central
Asia. By Henry Alfred Schroe
der and Laurance Armistead
Peters. 1930. At the Palo Alto
Book Shop.
Henry Schroeder and Laurance
Peters, authors ol" Shirt-Tall and
Pigtail, are emphatically not just
two more Richard Halliburlons.
But then they conifi from Yale in
stead fo Princeton. The type is dif
ferent. These travelers have an in
tense dislike for the grandstand
playing, the self-exploitation, the
juvenile imaginings of Halliburton.
This distaste is revealed in several
cracks which just, miss being dirty.
Shirt-Tail and Pigtail, with all
its humor and lack of sonorous ap
peals to gods and goddesses, re
mains a more romantic book than
"little Dicky's" Royal Road to Ro
mance. These young graduates of
Vale travel in Communistic Russia,
Turkestan, and China. The very
names of the cities they visit
breathe romance: Titlis, Baku,

I Bokhara, Batoum, Samarakand,
j Osh, Tashkent, Karasnovodski, An
[dizhan, Kashgar; Try them aloud;
j I hey have a rich Eastern flavor.
Kashgar is the goal, the epitome
of all that is picturesque and Orien j
; tal. Because of a Chinese revoln- \
, tion, it is never reached. Unlike j
| Halliburton, these authors admit, |
I with a touch of humor and more j
than a little chagrin, their failure. I
Tills is an enlightening example j
I of what can he done with the travel !
hook. The authors of Shirt-Tail and j
j Pigtail strike the happy medium!
between Halliburton's inaccurate!
'and egoistic but amusing account \
|of personal prowess and the usual |
(traveler's dusty record of history J
|and description of places and monu- :
' men Is.
Shirt-Tail and Pigtail offers not j
a dull moment. The personalities of j
the writers are engaging; hut they I
do not depend on them for inter- \
lest. There is worthwhile informa- j
tion in this book, and there is;
[amusement by the hour.
