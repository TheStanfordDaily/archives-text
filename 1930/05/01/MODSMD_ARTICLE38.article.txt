Every year finds on the Cardinal
football schedule a game with
Stanford's jinx of jinxes—the Uni
versity of Washington. This year
"Pop" Warner's men will meet sev
eral old faces but playing under
an entirely new system on Satur
day afternoon, November 8, here on
the Farm.
Washington has long been a
sere point with the Redshirts.
Year after year the Huskies
will start out the season miser
ably. Week after week they
will lose to teams that Stan
ford has crushed, and Warner's
stalwarts will go into the game
heavy favorites to wade
through to victory. But the
Purple and Gold never fails to
throw a monkey wrench into
the Red machine. In 1926
Washington held the Cardinals
10-10 up to the last quarter.
The next year the Redshirts
got ninety-nine per cent of a
large number of breaks to
scrape through on a fluke win,
13-7.
Then followed what looked like
a scoreless tie until the second
half when the Husky defense wob
bled just twice to allow two com
pleted passes, and the Cards stag
gered off with a skimpy 12-n. Last
year was worst of all. Stanford
started out, willi a rush, grabbing
off a touchdown in the firsl four
minutes, and then jnsf wheezed
through the rest, of the game on
that six-point margin with" the
Northerners again doped to lose
by a. big score. Such palpitations
of the heart are getting very tire
ome. In l!i2">, by the way, Wash
ington did manage to win.
The boys up North tired of
their coach, Enoch Bagshaw,
last year, and proceeded to
oust him in the middle of the
season. Now they have Jimmy
Phelan, a pile-driver if ever
there was one, who comes
straight from Purdue. The
Boilermakers won the Big Ten
title last year for the first time
since that haughty decemvirate
was started way back in 1892.
That speaks well for James.
Phelan has worked his men hard
all spring and should produce a
greatly different effect. His is a
fast, dashing style, differing from
the old batter and smash of
"Maggy's" days. Undoubtedly Phe
lan will put the old wim and wigor
into his boys, but he'll be a genius
il he can turn out a championship
out fit in his first year.
Right now he is faced with three
big difficulties: to develop a fast,
clever backfield, to find a fast rov
ing center, and to teach old ends
new tricks—all before the last prac
tice on May 0. There is a wealth
of backfield material to work on.
The great Merle Ilufford, all-coast
halfback last year, has returned
for his second year, and the team
will be built around him. Johnny
Geehan and John Stombaugh are
both gone, but there is fleet-footed
Bob Buzzard, Bill Mittlestedt,
Erlckson. Robinson, Patrick, and
Woleott for halves, and Bill Marsh
and Culp for quarters. Gordie Jen
kins, ineligible last year, is the
leading candidate for fullback, fol
lowed by Ruse and Walsh.
Three lettermen return to
the flanks: Westerweller,
Squires, and Pautzke. Sam
Kraetz, last year's center, has
been shifted to guard while
Montgomery, Palmer, and
O'Brien are contending for the
other post. For centers, Phelan
has portly Don Bonamy, broth
er of the Bonamy of a few
years back, Howard, Welsh,
Landlauer, and Finn, but he is
far from satisfied with any of
them.
As a matter of fact, hard-hearted
Coach Jimmy is far from pleased
with anyone, except Mr. Ilufford
and his two tackles. His two
tackles, by the way, are plenty nice
even though big, big Paul Jessup
has departed from the field of glory.
One of 'em is Captain A 1 Holmes,
and the other wears the familiar
jersey number 33, made famous by
Wilson many years ago and carried
on by the present wearer now. In
troducing, folks, one of the best,
tackles on the coast Paul Schweg
ler.
The Huskies will blossom out
a la Stanford next fall with
gold helmets and purple mole
skins. Maybe Phelan and his
fourteen lettermen may be able
to dazzle Stanford into a de
feat, but it seems unlikely,
this aumtumn anyhow. But in
1931—watch out!
The next article will fake up the
prospects of Minnesota and Dart
mouth. —Howard Moore.
