from the sunny Southland to meet
llec Dyer in the 100- and 220-yard

yond Hip at present recognized
world's mark of 52 foe! and 11-lti

Move Shotput
Catering to expected interest of
| the spectators in this duel, those
managing the P.A.A. meet have
moved the shot-putters' scene of
activity from its usual location at
one end of the oval to a spot di
recently in front of the center of
the grandstand.
Attempts are being made to in
duce Dr. Paul Martin, Swiss dis
tance champion, who holds a deci
sion over Lloyd Hahn in the 1000-
meter race, to come from the East
to compete in either the mile or
half-mile. Should Martin accept the
P.A.A. offer he will leave Chicago
by plane tomorrow morning.
With the Olympic Club entering
! some fifty men and Stanford send
ing a squad of close to forty spike
jsters plus four unattached competi
tors and four or five freshmen, the
team battle for points narrows
down to the Cardinal and Winged
O almost exclusively. Men will be
entered by St. Ignatius, Santa
Clara, the Unione Sportiva Italia
Virtns, and the Humboldt Club, but
with the exception of the work of
a few outstanding stars, these or
ganizations are not expected to en!
very heavily into the scoring col
