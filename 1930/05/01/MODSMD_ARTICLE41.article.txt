## Helen Jacobs, Follower in Helen Will's Foosteps, Sails For Europe Ahead of Her Opponent 
### Feg Murray, '16 
They used to say that Helen
Jacobs always followed, in the foot
steps of Helen Wills. That's wh v <'
they called her Helen the Second.
She did just what the more famous
Helen did in many ways, and fol
lowed her career to the letter, as
winning first girls, then minor, then
major tennis tournaments was con
j cerned. She even wore an eyeshad'e.
j and went to the University of Cali-
I fornia, and so, of course, there was
| a little friction and coolness be
tween the two, and a raising of the
; eyebrows here and there when
! Helen the first demanded that an
j other California girl, not nearly so
| good a player as Helen the second,
be her Wightman Cup partner last
|yrar. It is on record that the Amer
ican team defeated the English
four matches to three, but had tho
two Helens teamed up in the dou
bles it might have been 5 to 2.
But, try as she might, Helen the
Second could never heat Helen the
First, and in the rankings released
by the U.S. Lawn Tennis Associa
tion last month, Helen Wills, of
Berkeley, Calif., was first, and

i Helen Jacobs, of Berkeley, Calif.,
second. Uut now Helen the Second
Has done something first. A couple
of weeks ago she sailed for Europe
in advance of Helen the First, who
is now married and probably won't
traipse around the country as much
as she did when she merely had to
attend classes at the University of
California.
So watch closely, folks, and see
if this is the Big Year for Helen
the Second. I'm not saying that she
will succeed to the throne now oc
cupied by Queen Helen the First.
It, may be some youngster like
Sarah Palfrey or Mary Greet who
will do that, eventually. But keep
| your eye on the husky Miss Jacobs
this year and you will see the best
tennis of her career to date, or I
i am badly mistaken.
A friend, a tennis fan with a
biblical turn of mind, suggests that
I draw Helen the Second wearing
a blazer jacket and call it "Jacobs'
coat of many colors." That's O.K.
hut supposing she follows Helen
the First's lead again, ventures
into matrimony, and become's
i Lott's wife?

tion last month, Helen Wills, of
Berkeley, Calif., was first, and

i Helen Jacobs, of Berkeley, Calif.,
second. Uut now Helen the Second
Has done something first. A couple
of weeks ago she sailed for Europe
in advance of Helen the First, who
is now married and probably won't
traipse around the country as much
as she did when she merely had to
attend classes at the University of
California.
So watch closely, folks, and see
if this is the Big Year for Helen
the Second. I'm not saying that she
will succeed to the throne now oc
cupied by Queen Helen the First.
It, may be some youngster like
Sarah Palfrey or Mary Greet who
will do that, eventually. But keep
| your eye on the husky Miss Jacobs
this year and you will see the best
tennis of her career to date, or I
i am badly mistaken.
A friend, a tennis fan with a
biblical turn of mind, suggests that
I draw Helen the Second wearing
a blazer jacket and call it "Jacobs'
coat of many colors." That's O.K.
hut supposing she follows Helen
the First's lead again, ventures
into matrimony, and become's
i Lott's wife?
