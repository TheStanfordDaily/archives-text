## 
### 
I Bids on t lit; heating, lighting,
i ventilating, and plumbing contracts
i for the new women's gymnasium
i will be opened today by Compt rol
ler Almon E. Roth. Although this
I contract cannot be awarded if the
! figures bring the total cost over
| $225,000, the bids must be in to de-
I termine the amount of money to
be obtained over the Board of Ath
! lot ic Control authorization.
It is estimated that the total
I cost of the structure will be ap
, proximately $25,000 in excess of
the sum authorized by the B.A.C.
j last year. The deficit will have to
be met by additional B.A.C. appro
priations or raised from other
j sources, Hot.li indicated. The exact
i cost of the gymnasium will not be
| announced until the figures are
â€¢ taken today on certain alternate
j propositions.
| Roth stressedJluii he is strongly
| opposed to any alterations of the
present plans in order to reduce
the construction costs to a figure
\ within the $225,000 B.A.C. authori
j zation. The plans as they are now
make up what is needed and want
1 od at Stanford and should not be
! changed, he believes.
