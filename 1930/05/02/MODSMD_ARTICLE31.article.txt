About 15l) track and field nth
Ictes, including all types from am
bitious hopefuls to tried and tested
champions, competing under Hi
colors of Stanford, Olympic Club,
St. Ignatius, Santa Clara, U.s.I.V ,
Humboldt Club, and unattached,
will don spikes tomorrow afternoon
to compete in the annual Pacific
Association of the A.A.IJ. meet be
ing held in Kezar Stadium, San
Francisco.
Regular events, including all of
those found in a dual intercollc
giate meet with the exception of
the two-mile run and relay, plus the
440-yard hurdles, hop-step-and
jump, and 56-pound weight, will
commence at. 2 o'clock. With a view
to the safety of the spectators, the
hammer throw will start at 12 noon,
while the somewhat dreary G-mile
race begins at 1:30, allowing
prompt arivals to be in on the
finish.
With the hodge-podge of orguni
zations represented in the meei
plus a fair number of unattached
athletes who should collect quite a
few points, it is impossible to pick
a winner. The Cardinal varsity up
pears a cinch to collect at least '&■>
points, and might easily raise thi
total to one in the neighborhood of
' 60 counts.
