# SMARTY, SMARTY HAD A PARTY

In he graduated in the Memorial Church, or not to be graduated
in the .Memorial Church.
I mil recently that seemed to he a question facing members of
the senior class of 1930.
Hut now the graduating class oi 1930 has been enlightened. It
is not a question lor the seniors at all. It is a question for the Uni
versity administration. And the I Diversity administration has an
swered that question—it favored the "to be" construction.
Seniors have been informed that graduation is a party to which
they are invited—not a party to which they invite others. That being
the case, it is not for members of '30 to say where the party is
being held. (Juests, after all, don't dictate to hosts. Rmily Post is
authority enough for that.
Such, at least, is the stand of the administration. It's their party
and they'll run it.
In spite of all this, however, some people obstinately continue to
think that the seniors are giving the party-—and these people don't
want it to be a case ot "Smarty, Smart}' had a party and nobodv
came but big, fat Smarty."
After all, one can't see one's self graduate. The pleasure of the
ceremony, to the seniors, is to have the people near and dear to
them witness the event. If the exercises are held in the Memorial
( lmrch, that pleasure is vastly diminished.
The Committee on Public Exercises has made a valid objection
to the proposal, perhaps, in pointing to the increased expense of
having the ceremony outside the traditional building. J kit surely
that objection will be met, if the senior class covers the extra cost.
Kven that should not be necessary. It is assumed that the addi
tional expense is entailed in providing seating facilities. The IJni
versity would be justified in such an investment. Certainly the need
is great —and the senior classes to come are not likely to shrink in
The seniors' stand in this matter has not been unreasonable or
unsound. Would it not be fairer for the I niversitv to give the thing
more consideration ?
After all, it is the seniors who graduate. If there were no sen
ior-- there could be no party. A well-regulated party must have guests
a- well as hosts. I wen Kmily Post will hack up that stand.
