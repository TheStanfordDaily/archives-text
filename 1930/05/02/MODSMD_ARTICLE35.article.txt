# SENILE SENTIMENTALITY
## 
### 
Fiery Hill Hudson, editor of Berkeley's Culifornian during the I
prist semester, sings his swan song in the final issue of his paper.
Thus does one-time editor Mudson sum up his foray into col
legiate journalism: "Once there was a young man who started out ■
a semester by thumbing his nose ;it everybody he saw. After several :
months he discovered that he had been gazing in the mirror all this :
time. We were that young man.
"We said about everything we have to say, which probably isn't i
very much. We've acted like a daily gas bag for an entire semester,
and now the bag i< pricked. Down we come in a parachute. And j
then we discover that the parachute hasn't opened."
That is the obituary of Mr. I fudsou.
We have disagreed violently with that gentleman more than ;
once. We have taken exceptions to what he said ; we have lambasted
him on occasion. Hut we are sorry to see him go.
In spite of "1 late Stanford" efforts (that was a mole hill moun- j
tain, anyhow) the Califnrnimi has been a good paper; Hill Hudson
has been a good editor.
Perhaps it is senile sentimentality; maybe it is because we are
getting old and are going to take a parachute jump ourselves before i
long, and be another pricked gas bag—but we are in a mellow mood. !
We are inclined to shed a tear or two for the past that is not yel
a past.
< )h. hell! Hudson's probably glad to get out. And we'll prob
ably be glad to get out, too.
