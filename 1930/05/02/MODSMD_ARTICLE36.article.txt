Though the Daily speak with the tongues of men and of angels,
and Stanford had not its campus charity, all journalistic effort
would surely he as sounding hrass or a tinkling cymbal. Maybe it
is anyway, but we like it. Tinkling cymbals always sound so well
at eight in the morning.
We have hope, too —hope that the alleged Stanford rough will
put on his party manners when the charitable co-eds descend upon
his living group in the annual student apjK-al for funds. And we
have faith in the inherent goodness of Stanford students that they
will go deep into their pockets for a I lome which stands as a living
tribute to the Lei and Stanfords" love for children.
Kings may rise and fall in a day, spring may have its regular I
lockout fever, campus drives may conic and go like, the roses of
Yesteryear, but the greatest of all yearly charity events is the three
dav era of cheerful giving which dawns upon this college community
next Mondav morning.
