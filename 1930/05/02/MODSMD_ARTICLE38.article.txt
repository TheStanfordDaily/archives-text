## TRADITIONAL TRADITION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Stanford Tradition is with us
again, Not about dinks, or hello's
or rooting suctions. This time it's
Commencement and the Chapel.
The front page of Wednesday's
Daily tells us, "TRADITIONS TO
BB FOLLOWED IN GRADUA
TION." Tradition is a line thing;
but when it presents itself as a
preventative to a change in proce
dure demanded by a change in the
times and condition it is a bit de
plorable.
That the Chapel is not large
enough to accommodate even the
families of the graduates seems to
be obvious. In response to an in
quiry to the Alumni Secretary re
garding the possibility of obtaining
a. third bid to Commencement in
June, I received the following reply
by letter from I he Secretary: "if
Commencement is held in the
Church it will be hopeless to expect
more than two tickets. Last year
there were not sufficient tickets to
supply all of the graduates and tne
same condition will exist this
year. . . ."
The solution seems to be to hold
Commencement at such a spot
which affords larger accommoda
tions than the Chapel. But no, says
I he Committee on Public Exercises;
tradition has erected its bulwark
about the Chapel and we must fol
low tradition.
That Commencement, in Ihe
Chapel is a glorious custom is in
disputable; but even be it ever so
beautiful the custom cannot keep
pace with the times. It was a tine
custom for our forebears to sally
forth in fine carriages drawn by
prancing horses; and yet the Com
mittee rides in automobiles, it was
a tradition based on the very foun
dation of family honor for a gentle-

I niiin to challenge liis enemy (o duel
1 arid then to repair to some secluded
spot and I hero each attempt to ex
terminate the other; but such pro
cedure today would find the parties
engaging n concrete suit at the ex
, pense 'of tlie State. It' we desire
to travel on the Ocean today we
take passage on a modern liner;
and yet three hundred years ago it
was the proper thing to travel on
the Mayflower. Why the difference?
Because the times have changed.
Times have changed here at
Stanford and yet some traditions
seem to go on forever. The tradi
tion of the Chapel began in IfMX
when ihe total number scheduled
lo receive degrees was bu! 421 and
the total enrollment in the Univer
sity was 1406. The present enroll
ment is .'5244 ; Ihe number scheduled
lo receive degrees in 1929 was 107G.
A bit of a change in conditions.
Hut tradition must, go on.
The holding of present-day Com
mencements in the Chapel seems to
me like an a I tempi to hold the Re
publican National Convention in
Boston's old Faneuil Hall. The old
Hall abounds with traditions of Tea
Parlies and gatherings of great
patriots; but Ihe Convention just
! wouldn't til therein; so the Con
vention goes elsewhere. And so at
Stanford: all those near to the
graduates and who wish to join
with them in their greatest Univer
sity event, just won't fit, into the
Chapel. But if tradition must pre
vail- if the Powers That Be so
decree--well, then, so it must be.
But, notice, reader, the people of
Iraq on the River Tigris still raise
their water for irrigation by means
of oxen-powered water wheels built
of poles and ox hide sacks. And
why? Tradition.
