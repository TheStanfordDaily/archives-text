# RULES CAN'T MAKE MORALS

### 
The Editor, Sir:
It' only the campus will under
stand that the big discussion of
women's rules in Stanford is not
only the expression ot' a minority,
but of an admittedly idealistic and
quite consciously radical minority,
much opposition and throwing up
of hands in holy horror will be
eliminated.
All of the women in Stanford —
even the greatest number, perhaps
—don't agree with us. What we are
proposing is a program which will
be only a step to an ideal which
recognizes emancipation of women
from a social point of view. The
fact is that Osburn's "social las" is
in operation in the world today as
regards the general attitude to
ward government, of women, and,
as college women, with more op
portunity for thought and discus
sion and expression than is the
privilege of most women, it; is our
sacred obligation to suggest and
point to ideals and ideas which
may lead to improvement of the
status of the individual.
What we believe is that women
should have the power of choice
and selection in following the
moral code, and allow the pleasure
pain pressure of society to operate
as it does in the case of men. Wo
men have begun to forget that they

| must continue to fight, for actual
i equality: wp have been coasting
j too long on the efforts of our pre
| ceding "women emancipators."
Toward this goal of individual
■ discipline, based on trial and error
i —which should he allowed only to
adults, however —we are suggesting
I reforms —not because the reforms
are our goals, but because we must
have something concrete before
any number of people will listen
: to us.
The newspapers will pin them
selves to these concrete details
which are suggested, and will pass
over as unimportant our main is
hues: the privilege of living as
adults, with individual differences
in opinion allowed to operate as
, far as is convenient .with society's
I pressure. Just because individuals
jaro so alarmingly similar in their
makeup, there is little fear that
they will step far from the beaten
| path conveniently blazed by our
predecessors. We aren't quite cer
i tain that our path wouldn't be less
circuitous and the end of 1 lie path
more worthwhile, but. that is ma
terial for another story.
What we object to, is this hand
to-mouth existence of living by the
day—rules for the present alone,
! with no goal or future aim to act as
jour guiding star. RULES CANNOT

j MAKE MORALS. Only freedom.(as
far as psychologists will allow us
to have freedom) can evolve a code,
based upon individual differences
in temperament, training. and
tastes. Let each woman decide
what she wants, and then slick to
it. because she is convinced it is
the best thing for her. Society
should affect us only to the point
of expedience not custom; and the
present status of women is an in
stance of the operation of custom
ary morality.

The Editor, Sir:
It' only the campus will under
stand that the big discussion of
women's rules in Stanford is not
only the expression ot' a minority,
but of an admittedly idealistic and
quite consciously radical minority,
much opposition and throwing up
of hands in holy horror will be
eliminated.
All of the women in Stanford —
even the greatest number, perhaps
—don't agree with us. What we are
proposing is a program which will
be only a step to an ideal which
recognizes emancipation of women
from a social point of view. The
fact is that Osburn's "social las" is
in operation in the world today as
regards the general attitude to
ward government, of women, and,
as college women, with more op
portunity for thought and discus
sion and expression than is the
privilege of most women, it; is our
sacred obligation to suggest and
point to ideals and ideas which
may lead to improvement of the
status of the individual.
What we believe is that women
should have the power of choice
and selection in following the
moral code, and allow the pleasure
pain pressure of society to operate
as it does in the case of men. Wo
men have begun to forget that they

| must continue to fight, for actual
i equality: wp have been coasting
j too long on the efforts of our pre
| ceding "women emancipators."
Toward this goal of individual
■ discipline, based on trial and error
i —which should he allowed only to
adults, however —we are suggesting
I reforms —not because the reforms
are our goals, but because we must
have something concrete before
any number of people will listen
: to us.
The newspapers will pin them
selves to these concrete details
which are suggested, and will pass
over as unimportant our main is
