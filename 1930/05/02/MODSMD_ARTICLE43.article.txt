THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND—At
the New Stanford Theatre.
As bizarre, unreasonable, and
fantastic as tiio.se dreams yon have
after consuming a welsh rabbit, or
lobster salad at midnight, "The
Mysterious Island" is worth seeing
if only for the psychological effect.
The picture fascinates from the
opening shot of Count Dakker's
sea, done in line technicolor, to the
gloomy, beautiful castle by the
final scene where the wizard scien
tist makes the weird submarine
creation about which the picture is
built his lornh, and sinks it to the

The scenes supposedly under the
depths of the sea, showing curious
sea life and sea formations, are
very absorbing, while impression
ist ically nothing finer could be
asked than the opening note —the
interior of the strange workshop of
the master-scientist, where huge
furnaces cast glimmering, livid
lights on half-naked bodies of work
men, and countless wheels turn in
flashing revolutions.
