# MULLER TO STUDY NEVADA AMMONITES
## 
### 
Siemon \V. Muller, instructor in
geology, will leave Monday on an
expedition to central Nevada and
later to Shasta county in Northern
California where he will gather
data on ammonites, a species of
prehistoric shellfish.
Last summer Muller and F. N.
Johnston went to Nevada and col
lected specimens of ammonites
valuable from a paleontological
standpoint.
The material for which Muller is
searching will be used by him in his
thesis for his doctor's degree. He is
now on a leave of absence from his
teaching duties.
