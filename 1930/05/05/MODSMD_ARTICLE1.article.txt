lIERALDED by posters, a campus parade, speeches from Stanford's
feminine contingent, and the active work of treasurers in the cam pus
living groups, the annual A.S.S.U. appeal for funds will swing into' action
today and culminate with Labor Day Wednesday night.
"We hope to get a contribution, 110 matter how much, from every
student in the University," said Irwin Warner, head of the men's drive,
last night. "Stanford is one of the few universities in the country which
has an opportunity for social work on its own campus."
Out of the $40,000 income for Ihe Home last year, the student drive
netted over $4,000. The Home's sources of income are three: interest
on the general endowment of $190,889, operating rceipts from the
parents of the children who can pay for part or all of their children's

care, and public contributions. Tho
latter named source includes dona
tions from the San Francisco and
San Jose Community Chests, stu
dents, Palo Alto, and individual or
ganizations.

will report to William Chatham, Jr.,
from the row to Jack McDowell and
Betty Clarke, and Itoble treasurers
