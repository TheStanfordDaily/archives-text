## Edmonds Loses 3 And 1 In Match For Title 
### 
Sinking several long putts in the
afternoon round to overcome a dis
advantage of 4 down, Richie Ste
venson pulled the unexpected to
defeat Warner Edmonds, 3 and 1,
yesterday, in the 36-hole finals of
the first annual Stanford open and
annexed the University golf cham
pionship.
Although out-driven by his op
ponent, during the morning round,
Kdmonds emerged from a nip-and
tiick bat He with a lead of three up
which lie promptly increased to
four 011 the first hole of the after
neon's play. During the morning,
the two golfers won and lost the
first thirteen holes, not a single
one being halved until the short
fourteenth.
Going to the twentieth hole with
a handicap of four down, Stevenson
staged a brilliant comeback to tie
the match on the thirtieth. He sank
a twentv-l'oot putt on the twenty
ninth to cut down the, lead by one,
and Edmonds obliged by three
putting on the thirty-first to send
Stevenson into the lead for the
, first time since the fourteenth hole
in the morning.
Ten-Foot Putt Birdie
The short thirty-second whs
halved in par threes, and the vic
tor sank a ten-foot putt for a birdie
on the thirty-third and led, 2 up.
| A ding-dong race up the hill on the
thirty-fourth saw Stevenson main
taining his two-hole advantage. He
J drove off info a tree but the ball
; bounced out into the fairway and
, a beautiful brassie shot, coupled
wiili Edmund's shot approach en
abled him to halve the hole.
The champion's tec shot, on the
j short thirty-fifth was long by tweii-
Ily yards, and Edmonds, just off
I the green, had an excellent chance
jto win the hole but dubbed a
| mashie shot, and Stevenson sank
!a seven-looter to win the hole and
! match.
Neither man turned in his usual
j medal standard, while only eight of
i the thirty-five holes played were
halved. A moderately high wind,
; however, hampered any excellent
; scores. About 150 viewed the aft.er
; noon round while Coach Garry Hen
net! served as judge.
