## 
### 
DKRMY, Conn., May 4. (/P) In a
case that rivalled the memorable
PoiiKhkeepsie Regatta of last year
in late starting, the varsity oarsmen
ot Yale have returned to their win
ning ways on the Housatonie.
In this ease the water got
smoother instead of rougher, and
nobody swamped, but crews and
oaiineij were handicapped consid
erably by the semi-darkness in
which the race was rowed.
It was through the last faint ra
diance of a sun that had already
set and,the feeble light of the moon
and stars that Yale went smashing
down the river, rowing faster and
faster, to beat Columbia's Pough
kcepsie champions by a length and
a quarter and Pennsylvania by
four lengths more.
