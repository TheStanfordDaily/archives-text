# ONE REAL ARGUMENT

I odav Stanford brains its annual campaign to secure funds for
the support of Stanford's charitable institution—the Convalescent
1 lome.
I lie Convalescent I lome campaign is a test that Stanford meets
each year. It is a test which Stanford has never failed; one which
Stanford must never fail.
In the work-a-day university world it is easy to forget unpleas
ant things. 11 ere in the cloisters of the Quad, and in the compla
cency of the Row and of the J (alls, Stanford men and women seem
far from poverty and 11 Itli and sickness.
It is only a few minutes, by roadster, to a different scene. I nder
leaden San hrancisco skies there is poverty and there is tilth and
there is sickness. In those surroundings the cloistered Quad seems
very far away.
It is not sentimentality to point out these things. It is cold, hard
truth. Stanford people should not close their minds to such truth.
I he money raised from the Stanford community goes to no
trans-I 'acitic isle to "save the' soul" of some brown-skinned savage
vho is perfectly healthy and perfectly happy. The money stays here
i.n the harm to bring health and happiness to some white-skinned
urchin whose very life depends upon it.
There will be this editorial in the Daii.y. and probably others;
there will be speakers at the living groups; there will be stickers on
collegiate windshields; and there will be all manner of efforts made
to foster this drive. s
All these things may help. F'ut an ocean full of editorial ink and
a sky full of oratorical wind make, small arguments when .compared
to the one real argument —that of visiting the i lome and seeing the
undeniable proof of w hat has been done and what is being done.
