# A 						DEFINITE STAND NEEDED
## 
### 
Apparently the most pressing necessity in this drive being made
by Stanford's Five Hundred for less rigid lockout regulations is
that the women band together and formulate their plans and desires;
so that something definite can be presented to those in whose hands
lies the power to solve the problem.
Tonight, being Monday evening, is the time when the various
living groups will hold their usual weekly meetings. Tonight, there
fore, is the time when each living group should discuss the problem
and develop some concrete stand.
If such a procedure is followed there will be, at most, twelve
different ideas as to what changes should be made. And twelve
ideas are easier to work with than 500 ideas.
Stanford women should realize that it will be impossible to
formulate a plan which will please everyone. ()nly by some such
arrangement of give and-take will the desired end be reached.
Stanford women have registered definite approval of the moVe
to reform the existing system. It now lies with them to act, and act
promptly; so that their demands will be given the attention they
deserve.
