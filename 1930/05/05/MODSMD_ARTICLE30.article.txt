# PARKING AND LIGHTING
## 
### 
Stanford's main, and incidentally darkest, thoroughfare was the
vcene of what might have been a serious early morning accident
recently when a ''road hog" forced the driver of another machine
into a parked automobile.
.Although no one was injured, the impetus of tiie crash was suffi
cient to render the two machines non-combatant for the next few
days.
Admitting that the person responsible for the accident failed
to pay the usual courtesy by not allowing room for passage of two
automobiles, it is almost needless to declare that proper street light
ing and control of parking oil Lasuen Street would abolish ;i seri
ous menace.
Constant lighting of the main campus roads at all intersections
and adoption of an ordinance permitting parking on only one side
of the street would keep narrow Lasuen Street-free from danger.
