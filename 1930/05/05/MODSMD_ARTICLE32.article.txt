MARY'S OTHER HUSBAND. At I
the President Theatre. San Fran- j
cisco.
The ingeniousness "I" ji very j
clever playwright's brain, turned j
on full force, was responsible for j
a top-notch comedy in Mary's Other
Ilusband.
The curtain fulls at, the end of-j
the first, act on a tableau that is a
classic. The Mary of the play is a ;
giddy young married woman whose \
wealthy uncle has dropped in for j
a most inopportune call. Mary!
makes her husband play the part
of a butler in his own homo to
give the right, atmosphere, but. a
curious I wist of circumstances
drives her to I he desperate yel im
perative resource of borrowing an
absolute stranger as a temporary
husband. This arrangement is car
ried on over a telephone, and the
most essential points of the in
struction are overlooked. Conse
quently the "Oiher Husband" not
only bursts in at entirely the wrong
moment, hut exuberantly embraces
the wrong wife.
Telling this episode flattens it
to nothing in comparison to its real
effect. It is a superb piece of
clowning, very forceful and clear
cut, in execution, so that ibis single
hilarious scene sticks in one's mem
ory as if it had been photographed
■—every detail of pose and expres
sion can he clearly recalled. This
is rare in a mere comedy. 4
Taylor Holmes does beautiful
work as the improvised butler. 11 is
facial expressions are a. whole
comedy, study in character, and
scenario in themselves- particu
larly liis grieved moments, lie has
a way, when his wife's schemes are
too much for him, of putting on
the lugubrious expression of a
damp owl which is somehow excru
ciatingly funny. The maid's sloppy
walk, shrugging shoulders, and
blas<s, nasal vulgarity constitutes
the best acting-of tin* play second
to that of Taylor Holmes.
"Mary's Other Husband" is an
unpretentiously light farce, whose
comedy is athletic and wholesome,

| without even the remotest glimmer
|of subtlety. It goes along in 1 itl l«*
rushes of excited, spontaneous lui
mor, which are unfortunately some
j times dragged into ruts of stilted
! buffoonery. These ruts are easily
I forgotten, however, and one leaves
tin? show with that warmly satis
fled feeling that Duffy plays are
I famous for.

THE BENSON MURDER CASE—
At the New Stanford Theatre.
Tin* renowned Philo Vance is
i with us once more. S. S. Van Dyne
| has indeed been a boon to the
II ired motion picture producer. By
(lint of turning out plots in rapid
| succession and witli great similar
ity, the same casts, off-stage tliun
j der and lightning, and all the other
: little helps to thrill and chill the
I movie public can be used over and
over again.
! ' William Powell, ever suave and
! calculating, quickly and easily
'solves the sudden but entirely ex
'peeled murder of Benson, whom
five people bad each planned to re
j move at the first opportunity. And
J thereby hangs the tale. A lonely
land stormy night, in the home of
I Benson, the unscrupulous stock
i broker who had ruined the five in
{the stock market crash that day,
furnishes the setting for this "thril
ler." And then the clock strikes,
'the shot is fired, and once again
' Philo Vance sets out to solve, with
j the help of innumerable, cigarettes,
j the eternal question, "Who perpe
trated the nefarious deed?"
I But never fear. Vance always
I gets his man. And the audience
i goes home with a feeling of great
i admiration for the exceedingly re
| markable skill of this well-known
I detect ive.
Jn spite of the fact that this is
one of the least interesting of Van
j Dyne's stories and that, due to the
{reproduction many of the lines were
lost, William Powell is always
! pleasant, to look upon and his fre
quent changes of attire provide
| many suggestions for all thus in
clined.
