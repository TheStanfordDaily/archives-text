MARY'S OTHER HUSBAND. At I
the President Theatre. San Fran- j
cisco.
The ingeniousness "I" ji very j
clever playwright's brain, turned j
on full force, was responsible for j
a top-notch comedy in Mary's Other
Ilusband.
The curtain fulls at, the end of-j
the first, act on a tableau that is a
classic. The Mary of the play is a ;
giddy young married woman whose \
wealthy uncle has dropped in for j
a most inopportune call. Mary!
makes her husband play the part
of a butler in his own homo to
give the right, atmosphere, but. a
curious I wist of circumstances
drives her to I he desperate yel im
perative resource of borrowing an
absolute stranger as a temporary
husband. This arrangement is car
ried on over a telephone, and the
most essential points of the in
struction are overlooked. Conse
quently the "Oiher Husband" not
only bursts in at entirely the wrong
moment, hut exuberantly embraces
the wrong wife.
Telling this episode flattens it
to nothing in comparison to its real
effect. It is a superb piece of
clowning, very forceful and clear
cut, in execution, so that ibis single
hilarious scene sticks in one's mem
ory as if it had been photographed
■—every detail of pose and expres
sion can he clearly recalled. This
is rare in a mere comedy. 4
Taylor Holmes does beautiful
work as the improvised butler. 11 is
facial expressions are a. whole
comedy, study in character, and
scenario in themselves- particu
larly liis grieved moments, lie has
a way, when his wife's schemes are
too much for him, of putting on
the lugubrious expression of a
damp owl which is somehow excru
ciatingly funny. The maid's sloppy
walk, shrugging shoulders, and
blas<s, nasal vulgarity constitutes
the best acting-of tin* play second
to that of Taylor Holmes.
"Mary's Other Husband" is an
unpretentiously light farce, whose
comedy is athletic and wholesome,

| without even the remotest glimmer
|of subtlety. It goes along in 1 itl l«*
rushes of excited, spontaneous lui
mor, which are unfortunately some

giddy young married woman whose \

a most inopportune call. Mary!
makes her husband play the part
of a butler in his own homo to
give the right, atmosphere, but. a
curious I wist of circumstances

perative resource of borrowing an
absolute stranger as a temporary
husband. This arrangement is car
ried on over a telephone, and the
most essential points of the in
struction are overlooked. Conse
quently the "Oiher Husband" not
only bursts in at entirely the wrong
moment, hut exuberantly embraces
the wrong wife.
Telling this episode flattens it
to nothing in comparison to its real
effect. It is a superb piece of
clowning, very forceful and clear
cut, in execution, so that ibis single
hilarious scene sticks in one's mem
