The Etlior, Sir: I
Modernized romance, as most of |
you know, basks in the pleasant i
i approval of the San Francisco au- i
| thorities. Public parking places are [
maintained in various convenient j
j spots where the kindly policeman |
i nightly beams his approval on the |
earnest young swains singing their I
1 hymn of love to the ladies of their i
choice.
Hut not so the Stanford authori- j
ties! Gentlemen of the old school i
are they—staunch exponents of the ;
1 quiet evenings on the old oaken !
! sofa, munching peanut brittle be
i fore the watchful eyes of a wary
housemother.
I Hence, witness their devotion to j
the finer things: Parked one spring j
j eve by Ihe side of our romantic \
i stadium, two young gentlemen |
sought to master the intricacies of j
ja secret initiation ceremony—be
lieve it or not —when their care
ful study was rudely interrupted
by the brusque voice of one fit' the j
lesser hirelings of our Paternal Ad- j
ministration. A demand was made j
that the gentlemen be on their way
—after a first, careful searching '
under seats, newspapers, and spare j
tire covers for women or liquor —;
; as the Administration has decreed j
I that as dusk creeps over the flam- !
i pus grounds no car shall be al- ,
! lowed to rest its weary tires off the j
I beaten track. Another time, re- j
i turning late from a show, I wit
nessed the strange spectacle of
this same officer flashing the pry- ;
ing beams of his spotlight hither;
and yon about the stadium grounds, j
while from various quiet nooks no j
; less than six cars "were emerging !

GENTLEMEN OF THE OLD SCHOOL

with great precipitation. And thus
I discovered Ihe Administration's
charming solicitude in detailing an
officer to drive from their retreats
all persons parked at night in se
cluded spots on this campus of
ours.
Musing on (he incident as 1
pursued my way back to my law
books, I sought, the various whys
and wherefores that might, per
haps, lead to such unheard-of rude
ness. At first came the thought
that Dean Culver, frightened into
action by the growing demand for
freedom now being made by our
co-eds, might have issued Ibis de
cree for the necessary protection
of his retiring and timid charges
among the male element. Yet
somehow the logic; of this assump
tion did not appeal to my sense of
justice. And now that, the real rea
son comes 1o me, I cry, Oh Wise
Administration! Oh noble guard
ians of those tried and true tradi
tions of the past!
For is it not clear that since th°
youth of today cannot seek "ro
mance" under the moon's baleful
beams (for surely they would not
go so far as to hie themselves away
from the campus), Ihey will most
surely return to the ways of their
fathers, seek out the simpler pleas
ures of home and fireside, and he a
credit to our Administration. Their
protection from "romance" in its
modern form is undoubtedly as
sured by this careful guardianship,
and so no longer need fond moth
ers fear for their darling boys. A
toast to the Administration, boys!
Drink 'er down!

with great precipitation. And thus
I discovered Ihe Administration's
charming solicitude in detailing an
officer to drive from their retreats
all persons parked at night in se
cluded spots on this campus of
ours.
Musing on (he incident as 1
pursued my way back to my law
books, I sought, the various whys
and wherefores that might, per
haps, lead to such unheard-of rude
ness. At first came the thought
that Dean Culver, frightened into
action by the growing demand for
freedom now being made by our
co-eds, might have issued Ibis de
cree for the necessary protection
of his retiring and timid charges
among the male element. Yet
somehow the logic; of this assump
tion did not appeal to my sense of
justice. And now that, the real rea
son comes 1o me, I cry, Oh Wise
Administration! Oh noble guard
ians of those tried and true tradi
tions of the past!
For is it not clear that since th°
youth of today cannot seek "ro
mance" under the moon's baleful
beams (for surely they would not
go so far as to hie themselves away
from the campus), Ihey will most
surely return to the ways of their
fathers, seek out the simpler pleas
ures of home and fireside, and he a
credit to our Administration. Their
protection from "romance" in its
modern form is undoubtedly as
sured by this careful guardianship,
and so no longer need fond moth
ers fear for their darling boys. A
toast to the Administration, boys!
Drink 'er down!
