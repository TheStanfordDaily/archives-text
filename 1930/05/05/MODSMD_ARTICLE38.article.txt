I gtM the gate, I ko( the gate from i
Claire!
All, she was wicked, cruel, and
unfair!
I got the gate, but really, I don't
care:

there.

A skunk's appeal, most people think, j

There once was a clever young bd.
Who could reel you off rhymes by
the yd.
When asked how he could,
He said, "Well, I'm Could,
And besides, rhyming isn't so bd.

nor get, to feeling blue

will clout mo,
or pour out my home brew?
