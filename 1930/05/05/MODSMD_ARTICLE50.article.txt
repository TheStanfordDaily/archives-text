# SEQUOIA I SCORES 8-0 VICTORY OVER ALPHA SIGMA PHI
## 
### 
Though the Alpha Sigma Phi nine
played good ball on the defense to |
hold the Sequoia 1 team to their j
lowest win of the season, the hall 1
men easily outclassed the fratern- 1
ity outfit by an 8 to 0 score on
the intramural diamonds Friday. !
Failure to hit nullified any threat J
by the Alpha Sis aggregation.
.Richard at .shortstop was out- i
standing for the Sequoia team, both i
in hitting and on the field, while!
the pitching of Trimminghani and
Spaght was good enough to blank
the fraternity nine. Baxter at sec- j
ond was the star for the Alpha !
Sigs, while Hibbard and Scatena on
the mound were responsible for the !
comparatively low number of ta 1 - 1
lies scored by the hall men.
Of the throe other scheduled con
tests, Sigma Alpha Epsilon won by I
default from Chi Psi, the Theta;
Chi vs. I'lii Delta Theta tilt was
