## 
### 
"Ballads are simple forms of
songs that can go on infinitely with
slight changes in the words of each
verse," explained Dr. Margery Bai
ley when she read ballads at the
benefit, bridge tea given Saturday
afternoon by Theta Sigma Phi, wo
men's national honorary journalis
tic society.
Dr. Bailey went, on to say that
songs are not strictly ballads, but
ballads sprung from simple forms
where a phrase repeated two or
three times developed into a dia
logue or a game, then a suggested
and later a complete story. The
story with its constant repetitions
was the essential tiling, Dr. Bailey
said, the song only serving to em
phasize the dramatic points ot the
narrative, nothing more.
Dr. Bailey gave the history of
the ballad, giving examples of each
period in its development. She be
gan with "Smoothing Iron" and
"Man John," an old idea which be
comes a little drama as the ballad
progresses. A narrative retrain she
gave called "Twa Sisters" was so
old that the same idea was found
in Hindu.
Dr. Bailey is a member of Theta
Sigma Phi and was the guest of
honor at their annual tea given for
the purpose of raising funds for
