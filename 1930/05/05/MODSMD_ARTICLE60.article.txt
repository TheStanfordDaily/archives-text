# JUNIOR-SENIOR TILT ON SOCCER FIELD TO DECIDE TITLE TODAY
## 
### 
Superior teaniplay is expected to
give the junior interc-lass soccer
eleven the class title for ibis year
when tliey meet the senior team
tliis afternoon at 4:00 o'clock in
the deciding contest of the series.
The seniors have displayed rather
more dash than the third-year men,
but the latter are more accustomed
to playing together, and boast an
array of lettermfin at least as long
as that of the seniors.
In the first game of the series
t lie freshmen wont down to defeat
before the class of '30 by a 2-0
score, while an apparently stronger
sophomore eleven took a 0-5 beat
ing at the hands of the juniors,
who gave evidence of considerable
power in that game. All dope thus
points to a victory for the 'ill ag
gregation, but interclass competi
tion is an uncertain thing and it is
quite possible that the seniors will
nose their rivals out.
