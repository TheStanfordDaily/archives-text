### 
I \|KW YORK, May 4. (#>) Flames, swept onward by a stiff spring
I br.eeze, wrought havoc today in widely separated sections of the East,
j A small fire that started in a wooden bridge at Nashua, N.H., gateway
| city to the Granite State, destroyed most of the southeastern section of
| the city, including at least 125 houses, several business establishments,
a church, and school.
On Long Island and Stat en Island, in New Jersey, Massachusetts, and
Rhode Island, destructive brush and forest fires baffled the fighting skill
of thousands of regular firemen and volunteers.
On Staten Island in New York harbor, brush fires cut a wide swath.
They burned 200 cottages ;it Oakwood Heights, making hundreds of

>persons homeless, and threatened
Rossville, Prince's Bay, and Pleas
ant Plains. Fire apparatus, ferried
over from Manhattan and Brooklyn
for the first time in 20 years,
reached its destination just in time
to save 5,000 bungalows at South
Beach from the flames.
Long Island Fires
The Long Island (ires, covering
an area estimated at 100 square
miles, were the worst in a quarter
century. The biggest one, believed
to have started from a burning lum
ber yard at Amityville, swept a sec
tion ten miles long and three miles
wide and sent, a huge column of
smoke a mile into the air, whence
it drifted out over the Atlantic.
Strung out. from Amityville 75
miles along the south shore of the
island to Southampton were innu
merable smaller fires, which threat
ened villages and were reported to
have burnt, several barns and
houses. Residents of Bayshore and
Babylon, enveloped by the dense
smoke, failed to catch a glimpse of
i the sun all day. Sixty-eight fire
j companies' fought in vain to stop
the fiery tide and aviators from the
Long Island flying fields flew over
the area surveying the damage.
Southern New Jersey was com
pletely enveloped in smoke from at
least a half dozen fires. In Atlan
tic county die worst fire for many
j years laid waste 1500 acres of scrub
oak and pine underbrnsh, destroyed
several small houses, and sent hun
dreds of families fleeing in fear
| from their homes.
