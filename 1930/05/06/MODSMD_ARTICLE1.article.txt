A.W.S. Letter
The following letter was sent out
by Associated Women Students to
be read at liousemeetings:
"To the President;
"Conference and Council are glad
to iiave you talk over the difficul
ties which you find in the present
lockout rules and the suggestions
that were brought, up in the mass
meeting. You will be called upon
to vote on the matter later when
Conference and Council have form
ulated the changes. In discussing
I lie question keep in mind:
"1. We are here at an educa
tional institution and cannot ask
the Administration to sanction any
changes which would tend to de
crease the efficiency of the Uni
versity.
"2. A big factor in our efficiency
at college and in our success after
college is our health. Therefore,
any change must be considered
from the point of view of its effect
on health not only of the individual
but of t lie living group.
A.W.S. is responsible through
I lie ('diversity to parents for the
social conduct, of the women. We
are also responsible for the good
name of the University."
The letter was not signed.
