# TORO BEATS THETA XI, 8 TO 7, TO COP TITLE OF LEAGUE II
## 
### 
In a closely contested game
which developed into a pitchers'
duel for the last three innings, the
El Toro nine eked out a 8 to 7 win
| over llie Theta Xi outfit on the in
tramural diamond yesterday to
cinch the title in League II. The
one-run lead that the hall men held
at the close of the fourth inning
proved to be the final count when
Bramel of Theta Xi and Hubbard
for El Toro began their pitching
battle to blank their opponents for
the rest of the contest.
Each team accounted for a home
run, Nutt of the fraternity men
getting his four-base bingle with
the bags loaded, while Parker Reed
registered the round-trip for El
Toro with one man on. Crandall of
the hall men also starred with a
three-base hit in the second inning.
Three other scheduled games
were defaulted when Theta Delta
Chi forfeited to Phi Sigma Kappa,
El Capitan failed to show for the
Kappa Alpha tilt, and the Haber-
dashery did not appear to play the
Delta Tau Delta, team.
Contests for tomorrow are as fol
lows: El Tigre vs. Japanese Club,
diamond 1; Alpha Tau Omega vs.
Kl Cundro, diamond 1!; Delta Up
silon vs. Beta Theta Pi, diamond 3.
