# HARLOW ROTHERT CALLS UPON STUDENT BODY TO STRENGTHEN HONOR CODE
## More Efficient Enforcement Should Be Effected or the Institution Should Be Abandoned Entirely, Declares Head of Men's Council 
### BY GALE D. WALLACE 
rpo STRENGTHEN the much-criticized Stanford Honor Code, weakened
by tlie decay of adequate support, each student should attempt to aid
in the formulation of a stronger policy of control.
This was the sentiment expressed yesterday by Harlow Rothert,
chairman of the Men's Council, law-enforcing body for men students.
Although admitting that the Men's Council does not welcome trials
of honor code violations, Rothert said "members of the Council feel
that the enforcement of the Honor Code on the part of the students is
too lax and they would welcome a strengthening of its support even

though it. would necessarily mean
an increased number of violations
reported and increased duty — a
rather distasteful one —of infliction
of penalties."
More efficient enforcement, of the
system should be effected or else
the Honor Code and what it stands
for should be abandoned, were the
two courses of action available,
Rothert declared.
"As long as the institution in
question is recognized and gener
ally accepted by the students,"
Rothert stated, "it ought to be car
ried out efficiently or else aban
doned altogether."
That the widespread "disregard
of the Honor Code in existence is
very undesirable" was recognized
as a flaw in the present system by
Rothert in commenting on the
Men's Council and its participation
in the enforcement of the Code.
Rothert appealed to the students
for more support in the matter of
enforcement. He declared: "A
stronger stand by the student body
would be of great assistance to the
Men's Council as an integral part
of student control.
"Disregarding the merits and de
merits of the Honor Code, the
Men's Council has an inherent in
terest in its enforcement," the
chairman stated. Rothert declared
that the Men's Council has ex
pressed a personal as well as an
official sentiment toward need for
a successful operation of the Code.
