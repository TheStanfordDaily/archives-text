# ROUGH PROFANITY AT EXAM CAUSES GRIPE BY CO-ED
##

Honor must govern Stanford
roughs in t heir language as
well as their
exam sessions, if a iWf?nt oc
currence, in which a Stanford
woman unfortunately heard,
blushed, and hollered, is any
criterion of behavior.
During an ex on the Quad
two men students found them
selves confronted with quite
unexpected questions. With
perfect synchronization they
reacted in the manner which
had been their wont since
their earliest training on the
campus.
"s&'t! â€¢?*<:'/,,! $*?&u 4'tcq !"
The woman gasped, glared,
and held- her peace momen
tarily, although the matter
was reported to father, who in
turn mentioned it to the Dean
of Men, demanding that the
offenders be severely repri
niadend,
Two blissfully ignorant men
were called to the Dean's of
fices to give an account of
the affair, and both have been
requested to make apologies
to the young lady whose ears
were assailed by the question
able expletives.
