# ARREST OF GANDHI IS NECESSARY MOVE FOR BRITISH CONTROL---TREAT
## 
### 
"The arrest of Mahatma Gandhi j
| was inevitable." So summed up yes
terday Dr. Payson J. Treat, profes-
I sor of Par Eastern history, the ac
tion of the Uritish Government in
j regard to the leader of the civil
t disobedience campaign causing so
much trouble in India.
"Gandhi had clearly violated the
I law establishing a salt monopoly
1 for the government and had incited
I his followers to similar disobedi
ence. The Uritish Government to
be a government must either en
i force its laws, repeal them, or for-
I
i feit the confidence of its popula-
I tion.
"The .salt lax is so tied into the
I revenue system of Uritish India.
I that any modification must be the
I result of careful consideration and
not of hasty action. The system of
salt tax has been in operation more
than lf>() years and there are li

censed manufacturers and licensed
(l< alers whose lawful interest must
lie considered before action is
taken.
"I'nder (lie existing system all
sail consumed in India is subject
In duty. Objection bad sometimes
been taken to the principle of tax
ing a prime necessity of life. The
existing tax is, however, a light
substitute for transit and internal
customs duties, all of which were
inherited by the British from native
rule. The mass of people could not
be taxed readily iu any other way.
Moreover, there is tin question that
the tax will be removed when
higher taxes on industry or in
comes can take its place.
"As to the arrest (if Uandhi it is
impossible to predict, what effect
it will have upon the campaign for
independence among his followers,"
l)r. Treat concluded.
