India's government, up to its neck in internal trouble, lias at'
last decided to play its trump and arrest Mahatma Gandhi, saint
like lea?ler of Indian millions.
I his course of action, seemingly taken as a last resort, may
emphasize npon Indian mobs the firm stand Britain is determined
to maintain in her wealthiest possession. Gandhi, or no Gandhi,
John Bull isn't going to toss away the fruits of decades' warfare
and internal improvement. â€¢
Violations of the government's salt monopoly have been one j
source of friction between Gandhi supporters and the British. And !
now Indian propaganda against foreign cloth threatens to disturb
the busy prosperity of Manchester, England's great cotton manu
facturing center.
Indian leaders may shout sedition to the skies. Such bothers
the stolid English merchant not a bit. lint when the saline streaks !
of troubled colonial affairs crocp into placid commercial life and!
threaten the security of John Hull's purse, we can expect hasty
governmental action.

inside of British prisons before. Two sons are serving terms for j
sedition.
Gandhi's incarceration may offer a temporary panacea, but it!
is doubtful whether Indian mobs will quietly disband through lack!
of leadership. More likely, the present civil disobedience campaign
may be dropped, to be supplanted by violent outbreaks of protesta- j
tion such as those which have swept India in the past.
