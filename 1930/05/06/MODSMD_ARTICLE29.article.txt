# VALUABLE VOCATIONAL INFORMATION
## 
### 
Air-minded beings, prospective medics, and barristers-to-be
might do well to flock to the Little Theatre Thursday evening and
get some first-hand information on their prospective careers.
Short talks are scheduled at that time by the vocational guidance
committee. Stanford representatives have been obtained. All of
the speakers have made notches in the fields of their chosen pro
fessions. Talks will be short and snappy.
Those unenlightened souls who, astride the fence, know not
what they would be, should take advantage of this "get wise" op
portunity and "listen in" Thursday night.
