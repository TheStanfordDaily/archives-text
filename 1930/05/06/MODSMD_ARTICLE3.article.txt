# PIONEER AVIATOR TALKS THURSDAY
## Captain John Macready To Outline Vocation 
### 
Captain John Macready, one of
the three men who will speak in
the Little Theatre Thursday night
for the Vocational Guidance Con
ference, is well qualified to talk on
the subject of commercial aviation
as a vocation. Graduating from
Stanford in 1912, Macrefdy was a
pioneer in the field of flying.
While at Stanford during his un
dergraduate days, Macready was
quite an athlete. He held the Pa
cific Coast lightweight boxing
championship for three years,
played soccer, and also was some
thing of a pole-vaulter.
An adventurous career has been
the experience of the veteran flyer.
A miner in Nevada, later justice
of the peace at Searchlight, Mac
ready has also taken a fling at cat
tle-ranching in Arizona.
Record Holder
In the field of aeronautics, Mac
ready lias several records to his
credit. In 1921, lie set <ht> world's
altitude record at 40,800 feet, which
was high flying for that day. In
1!)23 he made the first non-stop
coast-to-coast, flight, and he has
also seen service in the U.S. Army
Air Service. Several times the Cap
tain has been forced to take fo his
'chute in order to save his life, and
there are few experiences either in
the air or on land which have not
fallen to his lot.
Connected with the Shell Oil Com
pany since January, whore he is in
charge of the aeronautical division,
Macready lias also experimented
with new types of planes, and is
the author of several magazine
articles on the future of commer
cial aviation.
Besides Captain Macready, the
other speakers on Thursday's pro
gram will be Dr. Emmet Itixford of
the Stanford Medical School, and
Dan Evans, prominent San Fran
cisco attorney. >
