UNCLE SAM, In the Eyes of His
Family. By John Erskine. Bobbs-
Merrill Co. Indianapolis. 1930.
That lull, lanky gentleman with
' :i long coal, lop-hat, niul boots, the
i cartoonist's method of picturing
the ITnitHtl Slates, might have a
I private biography and character as
well as a public career, thinks
John Erskine. "f'nele Satn" is that
biography.
With this nucleus Erskine writes
1 a novel, the story of a man strange
ly resembling that character we all
know so well. It is a tale of a
typical American, and therefore
quite dry.
Sam is tlie youngest, in the fam
ily; from liis early school days he
j shows determination and a certain
: shrewdness that later make him :i
powerful business man. In his boy
hood years Sam exhibits that, qual
i ity present, in so many American
youths, idealism. He loves natural
beauty; after his school years are
■ over he leaves home and witli a
careless disregard for money he
lives the life of a peddler, traveling
| across the Middle Western states.
But his youth does not last, nor
does his idealism. That quality is
replaced hy ambition, and Sam he
roines money-mad and practical.
But. for all this, we love Sam, prob
ably because we see him every day.
i He has a gentle humour and a
t broad mind; he forgives easily.
Erskine presents Sam to us In
that charming and informal style
! for which he is famous. He has im
: proved greatly since "Sincerity,"
the first of his booys on modern
life. The story is not startling, hut
I it is true.
; This is hy no means his best
'book; "The Private Life of Helen
! of Troy" and "Galahad" rank above
Jit. His style lends itself better to
I those fascinating pseudo-historical
novels than it does to modern
! stories. Still, "Uncle Sam" is note
| worthy, and it. will be read with
relish by a class of people that did
| not like, his former books.
THE GREEN GODDESS—At the
California Theatre, Mayfield.
George Arliss . clicks again with
ia screen version of another of his
stage successes, "The Green God
j dess." In spite of years of service,
! the old thriller still remains good
j theatre, and furnishes the star with
one of his most fortunate roles.
! As the Rajah of Rukh, he presents
a perfect picture of the suave Asian
prince, polished and smooth on the
| surface, barbaric and hard at the
core; the individual who uses his
'unusual intelligence, sharpened by
European culture, to further uncon
j ventional ends.
i There can be no adverse criti
} cism of Arliss' acting; he is mas
j ter of his medium. Even in the
! more artificial, melodramatic mo
j ments of the piece, he brings a sin-
I eerily, a restraint, to his role that
I lends conviction.
The plot, follows the original Wil
i liam Archer play very closely. It
concerns the efforts of three Bng
' lish people, victims of an airplane
1 crash over the remote kingdom of
Rukh, to escape the vengeance of
the native prince who fosters a

(deep hatred, engendered by years
I of oppression, of Englund.
j "The Green Goddess" is good en
• tertainment; don't miss it.

PAY DAY—By Nathan Asch. Pay
son and Clark, New York, 1930.
At The Alcove Bookshop.
Jimmy wns caught in tin* swirl
of the city, lis nervous clatter
pressed in on all sides. Pay d;iy . . . j
! You felt free when you Rot out of
j the office. Hut it didn't last. long,
i The subway, people crushing
(against you, girls, soft, anil warm,
! you tried to pick up, but no go;
I yon were nothing, a bum, because
I you didn't have a Cadillac. Nothing
but a bum who tried to gyp his
mother out of the board money;
who tried to gyp his sister, hm
•Daisy said if you didn't, pay her
I back, no more loans. And that ten
I dollars you owed mother. A good
i scout, mother. You ought to slay
j home. A lot of dates with girls who
I didn't care. You slaved all week for
(thirty dollars. (Mr. Simson turned
down the raise, if you think you're
indispensable to this firm, Mr.
Cowan .... He'd show them
whether he was indispensable or
not. He'd walk out on them. He'd
show them.) And paid all your
debts and saved money for carfare
j and lunch and spent the rest, on a
l date; drunk, with some girl, down
'at Paddy's, or Hie Paradise ....
Nathan Asch's nervous, erratic
slyle is eminently suited to his snh
ject matter in "Pay Day,"the
chronicle of a day in the life of
Jimmy Cowan, the bank clerk who
i may some day be bookkeeper, and
perhaps cashier, if he stays with
the company long enough. The
author has presented a penetrating |
picture of this commonplace indi-1
vidual who follows the crowd, the
line of least resistance; makes good
i resolutions one minute and breaks
them the next; goes on a date with
j tlie lunchroom girl and gets drunk
when he doesn't, want to, just, be
! cause it's pay day.
If Jimmy Cowan is not a sympa-j
thetic character, lie is at. least, un
derstandable. He is the same per- j
son as the wage slave in Elmer
Rice's "Adding Machine." He is tlie
mob personified, the white collar j
man, tied to his job, restless, dis-J
! satisfied, always in the hopeless |
search for something different,!
; something to take away the drab i
I drudgery of everyday existence.
If there is any fault to be found. 1
|in the book, it is the matter of j
| style. Mr. Asch get s his effect, but 1
| it is to the reader's discomfort. At 1
j times, the heavy beat, of the sen-1
tences becomes so monotonous and
j depressing that, one longs for a
| little comic relief. —L. R.
j LOVIN* THE LADIES—At The,
Varsity Theatre.
| "Lovin' the Ladies" is based upon |
the somewhat ridiculous hypothesis
'that any two young people placed
in the right environment, will fall i
J in love. An interesting situation de
velops out. of this theory,
j Richard Dix in the role of an en
thusiastic and amorous electrician'
i gives a clever performance. R.K.O.

was not mistaken in securing him
j as their star. He has not. failed tt>
> please in any of his recent, pictures.
The play is based upon a rather
pleasing comedy, "I Love You," -by
William LeTlaron and is well
| adapted to the screen. The linos
are clever and there are no theme
songs.
The rest of the bill is poor but
'the main picture is well worth see
j ing. —B. P.
