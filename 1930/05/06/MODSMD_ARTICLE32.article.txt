The Editor, Sir:
Now that we members of this
year's Senior Horde discover our
selves in the predicament which is
typical of the kind graduating
classes for some years past have
confronted, what are we going io
do about it? Anything? Or will we
exhibit as did our perhaps more
worthy predecessors that lack of
initiative, and resultant shorn-lamb
t obeisance to tradition, to make the
annual Herculean sardines-in-t he
pretty-can act just, a whit more un
palatable for those who are most
i interested in Stanford and her
graduating classes?
The Memorial Chapel is indeed
a beautiful jewel, exquisitely set in
a much rougher and much less
aesthetic matrix: its splendidly
decorated walls and the sense of
serenity which it imparts to the
I student mind will certainly not be
forgotten. II was prepared for those
; who were to come: and its capa
city was considered to be much
more than ample; thus it proved
. . . for a time. Rut administrative
policy changed. Enrollment of un
dergraduates gradually expanded.
The Church didn't.
Instead, the discomforts of gradu
ating increased, with a resultant
dwindling in the comforts what
there were (if any). Now, reaction
lias set in. The question is one of
numbers: Two tickets? Three?
Four, or Five? dialing lack of ac
comniodations? Or an efficient al
leviation of the constrictions?
Why shouldn't the Senior Class
Gift be embodied in such parapher
nalia as are necessary for an ade
quate graduation ceremony exter
nal to the traditional "stamping
mill" (note: I did not say "stomp
|ilig"), viz., in the Memorial Court;
i or —if it rains—in the Pavilion? I
stand ready to back this suggestion
with five dollars, rather than the
one-fifty required. And 1 believe I
am not alone in such attitude.
1 feel certain that this matter
] will be given due consideration by
I proper Senior Class and University
bodies, and that a plan for the es
tablishment of a "Bigger and Better
Graduation Exercises Fund" will be
of prime importance, though per

city was considered to be much
more than ample; thus it proved
. . . for a time. Rut administrative
policy changed. Enrollment of un
dergraduates gradually expanded.
The Church didn't.
Instead, the discomforts of gradu
ating increased, with a resultant
dwindling in the comforts what
there were (if any). Now, reaction
lias set in. The question is one of
numbers: Two tickets? Three?
Four, or Five? dialing lack of ac
comniodations? Or an efficient al
leviation of the constrictions?
Why shouldn't the Senior Class
Gift be embodied in such parapher
nalia as are necessary for an ade
quate graduation ceremony exter
nal to the traditional "stamping
mill" (note: I did not say "stomp
|ilig"), viz., in the Memorial Court;
i or —if it rains—in the Pavilion? I
stand ready to back this suggestion
with five dollars, rather than the
one-fifty required. And 1 believe I
am not alone in such attitude.
1 feel certain that this matter
] will be given due consideration by
I proper Senior Class and University
bodies, and that a plan for the es
tablishment of a "Bigger and Better
Graduation Exercises Fund" will be
of prime importance, though per
haps to the present detriment of
j any actions toward furtherance of
J the Stanford Ideal of a real Campus
] Beautiful.
Yours most sincerely,
G. Elton Watson, '30.
