Believe it or not, Mr. Ripley,
the world's record discus throw
measures exactly 177 feet.
And the holder of said record is
none other than little Eric Krenz,
captain of Mr. Templeton's l!13li
truck and Held team, the same gen
tleman who holds the recognized
American discus mark of Hi.", feel
N% inches.
Yesterday afternoon in prac
tice Captain Krenz tried out a
double turn before releasing his
firm grip on his favorite wea
pon. The Cardinal weight king
got all his weight behind one
throw and, aided by the addi
tional momentum of an extra
turn, the four-and-a-half-pound
disc sailed out through space
to come to rest 177 feet from
the circle, according to Mr.
Templeton's trusty steel tape.
The joker connected witli this
almost incredible heave lies in the
fact that Krenz was using a Id-loot
6-incli circle from which to start
his discus on its record-breaking
flight. The double turn throw, al
though perfectly legitimate in it
self, is exceedingly difficult to con
fine within the limits of the ortho
dox S-foot. 2V&-incli circle.
Final tryouts for the 1932
Olympic Track and Field cham
pionships may be held in the
Stanford Stadium. Coach Harry
Maloney, president of the Pa
cific Association of the A.A.U.,
under advice of Al Masters,
chief mogul of the Stanford
8.A.C., tendered an invitation
to the American Olympic Asso
ciation offering the use of the
Stadium for these tryouts.
Jack Williams, prominent ex-
IT.S.C. pole-vaulter, and Bill Kob
lick, who clears the bar for the
University of California, had every
intention of playing Lloyd Austin,
Cardinal freshman vaulter, a dirty
trick at the Y.M.I, field day in
Fairfax last Sunday. After all three
had cleared 11 feet, Williams and
Koblick moved the bar up a foot,
instead of the customary six inches.
Unsuspecting, Austin ambled down
the runway, grasped the bamboo
firmly, and gracefully cleared 12
feet. Koblick, who has frequently
cleared 13 feet, and Williams, who
used fo warm up at that, height,
failed on all three attempts.

Final tryouts for the 1932
Olympic Track and Field cham
pionships may be held in the
Stanford Stadium. Coach Harry
Maloney, president of the Pa
cific Association of the A.A.U.,
under advice of Al Masters,
chief mogul of the Stanford
8.A.C., tendered an invitation
to the American Olympic Asso
ciation offering the use of the
Stadium for these tryouts.
Jack Williams, prominent ex-
IT.S.C. pole-vaulter, and Bill Kob
lick, who clears the bar for the
University of California, had every
intention of playing Lloyd Austin,
Cardinal freshman vaulter, a dirty
trick at the Y.M.I, field day in
Fairfax last Sunday. After all three
had cleared 11 feet, Williams and
Koblick moved the bar up a foot,
instead of the customary six inches.
Unsuspecting, Austin ambled down
the runway, grasped the bamboo
firmly, and gracefully cleared 12
feet. Koblick, who has frequently
cleared 13 feet, and Williams, who
used fo warm up at that, height,
failed on all three attempts.
