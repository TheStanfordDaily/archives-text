day afternoon when lliey battled
through the deciding game of the
class tournament without scoring a
point, the final whistle sounding
with I lie score at ()•<).
Both teams.played hard fast hall
and threatened to score a number
of times, but neither could quite
master the punch to put the ball
into the net. On the whole tlie
caliber of soccer displayed was
good, considering the time of year
and the fact; that the teams have
had little practice together. A
slight edge might lie conceded to
the ju'niors on account of tin* su
perior teamwork they used and be
cause I hey made ;i few inure
chancey ioj' goal shots than Iheir
i opponents.
After opening on even terms
with the fourth-year men, the '31
players gained the upper hand
when ihe game was a few minutes
old and appeared certain to score
at least once. They had a golden
opportunity when lltey were
awarded a foul chance, but the fast
blocking of Wlttanscli, senior
goalie, preserved the goal.
Toward the end of the lmlf the
senior eleven was definitely on the
defensive, but managed to hold off
the third-year men.
Eberhart of the juniors cut loose
' with a stellar offensive game in the
second half, and it was largely due
to him that his team threatened to
collect a goal several times in the
tirst part of the period. He played
hard, consistent, and last soccer.
A long kick out checked the jun
-1 ior attack after a few minutes and
! and Gibbs and Ward Smith got in
several nice kicks which came
within an ace of penetrating the
'31 goal defense and putting the
game on ice for the seniors. There
was an exciting melee in front of
the lift for awhile. Nothing came
dI it, however, anil the play eoii
tinued on even terms to the end
of the contest.
The result of the name was a
slight upset ot the dope, sillce 111• *
junior sQuad was expected to col
lect the victory by a fairly close
margin. Having a larne number of
varsity players on their roster, tin;
juniors had the advantage in team
play, but appeared to lack the
punch to collect a goal.
As the result, of the tie the sen
iors and juniors will divide the
points for first and second places
as awarded in the interclass rank
ings. Third place is also a lie be
tween the sophomores and fresh
men.
