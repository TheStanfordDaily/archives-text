## Cuccinello of Cincinnati Cinches Regular Position at Third Sack After Good Showing in Trial Period 
### Feg Murray, '16 
When (lie 1!»30 baseball season
! opened, the l'ans of Cincinnati were
I wondering who Dan Hawley was
| going to use at third base. The big
I manager had four possibilities, with
' Stripp and Cuccinello favored. But
Strip]) was hit in the leg with a
| line drive (tie day before the sea
i son opened, so the little Italian
j from Long Island City was given
the call on opening day. He got
1 himself a nice hit in liis first major
i league game, and, what is more,
j showed t lie fans some snappy field
ing. He hit safely again on April
1(1, couldn't connect in the third
game, smacked another single on
the eighteenth, and also on the
.nineteenth.
In the game at Cincinnati on the
j nineteenth, the fast-fielding of the
I little rookie third-baseman helped
put over a triple play on the cham
' pion Chicago Cubs." "Trt the third

• inning 'Root, was hit and English
walked. Blair lined to Frey, 1
pitcher, who threw to Cuccinello.
The latter tagged Root, and then
shot the ball to Ford, who touched
English for the final put-out of the j
season's first three-ply killing.
Tony's fielding has been great so j
far, not an error marring his ree- [
ord in his first two weeks' appear-j
i ance as a major leaguer? In his:
I next five games after t lie nine
' teenth of April, Tony got three
singles and a double, took part in"
two double plays, stole one base,
and also played second base in part
of one game. He used to play both
the keystone sack and the hot, cor
ner in his minor league days. He is
only five feet seven, and weighs
]55 pounds.
This young Italian-American was
born twenty-two years ago in As- j
! toria, Long Island. He showed so |

much as a sand lot player that, he
got a trial with Syracuse when he
was nineteen. Next year he batted
land league, and he spent most of
the 1928 season with Danville in
the Three-Eye league, again batting
.310. Last year Tony batted .358
for Columbus and slugged out fifty
six doubles, ten triples, and twenty
home runs.
